The Captain has been expecting orders ever since we  came here, six weeks ago; but possibly something may have been learned  of Sehi's characteristics, and there may be doubts as to the expediency  of taking under our protection a chief whose conduct appears to be  anything but satisfactory. On the other hand, it may be considered that  by so doing we may establish some sort of influence over the surrounding  tribes, and so make a step towards promoting trade and putting a stop to  these tribal wars, that are the curse of the country.\"    \"It would be an awful sell if they were to change their minds,\" Harry  exclaimed.    \"I should be sorry myself, Parkhurst, for you know I am a collector. But  I can tell you that you won't find it all sport and pleasure. You  will have no cool sea breezes; there will be occasion for continual  watchfulness, and perhaps long boat expeditions up sluggish streams, in  an atmosphere laden with moisture and miasma.\"    \"One expects some drawbacks, Doctor.\"    \"You will find a good many, I can tell you, youngster. Still, I hope  we shall go up; and I think that we shall do so, for it will be the  Captain's report that will help the authorities to decide whether to  appoint a Resident there or not.\"    A fortnight later a small dispatch boat steamed in and the news soon  spread through the ship that the Serpent was to ascend the river on  the following day. All was at once bustle and animation. Sailors like  anything for a change, and all were impatient at the long delay that had  occurred.        CHAPTER III.      The gunboat was a large one, and carried two midshipmen besides  Parkhurst and Balderson, who were, however, their seniors. The mess  consisted of the four lads, a master's mate, the doctor's assistant, and  the paymaster's clerk. In the gun room were the three lieutenants, the  doctor, the lieutenant of the marines, and the chief engineer. The crew  consisted of a hundred and fifty seamen and forty marines; the Serpent  having a somewhat strong complement. She had been sent out specially  for service in the rivers, being of lighter draught than usual, with  unusually airy and spacious decks, and so was well fitted for the work.  The conversation in the junior mess of the Serpent was very lively that  evening. The vessel since her arrival on the station had made two runs  between Singapore and Penang, but those on board had seen but little  of the country, and were delighted at the thought of a possibility of  active service, and the talk was all of boat expeditions, attacks from  piratical prahus, of the merits of the bayonet and rifle opposed to kris  and spear, and of sporting expeditions in which elephants, tigers, and  other wild beasts were to fall victims of their prowess.    \"You will find that you won't get much of that,\" the mate, who was  president of the mess, said, after listening to their anticipations  of sport. \"I have been on the west coast of Africa and know what it is  poking about in muddy creeks in boats, tramping through the jungle, knee  deep in mud, half the crew down with fever, and the rest worn out with  work and heat. I can tell you it is not all fun, as you youngsters seem  to think, but downright hard work.\"    \"Ah, well! any amount of work is better than standing here doing  nothing,\" Dick said cheerfully, for the mate was known as a proverbial  grumbler. He had been unfortunate, and, as is usually the case, his  misfortunes were in some degree due to himself, for he was fond of  liquor, and although, when on board, he took no more than his share, he  was often somewhat unsteady in his speech when he returned from a run  ashore; and although the matter was not grave enough for his captains to  report altogether unfavorably of him, it was sufficiently so for them  to shrink from recommending him for promotion, and in consequence he had  seen scores of younger men raised over his head. He had been for some  time unemployed before he had joined the Serpent, and had been appointed  to her only because Captain Forest, who was a friend of his family, had  used his interest on his behalf. He had, however, when he joined, spoken  frankly to him.    \"I have asked for you, Morrison,\" he said, \"simply for the sake of your  father; but I tell you frankly, that unless my report is a thoroughly  favorable one, you are not likely to be again employed. I was told that  there was nothing special against you, but that in no case since you  passed have you been warmly spoken of. It has been said that you know  your duty well; but they had privately learned that you were fond of  liquor; and although no charge of absolute drunkenness had been brought  against you, it was considered that you would not make a desirable  officer in a higher rank. Now your future depends upon yourself; if you  have the resolution to give up the habit, you may yet retrieve yourself.  If I find that you do so, I shall certainly take the opportunity of  giving you a chance to distinguish yourself, and shall strongly urge  your claim to promotion. If I am not able to do this, you must make up  your mind to be permanently put upon the shelf.\"    The admonition had not been in vain, and since joining the Serpent  Morrison had made a successful effort to break himself of the habit. He  had very seldom gone ashore, and when he did so, never went alone, and  always returned at an early hour, and without having taken more than he  would have done in the ordinary way on board. He had not, however, given  up his habit of grumbling, and his messmates were so accustomed to his  taking a somber view of everything that his prognostication as to the  nature of their work up the river had but little effect upon them.    \"What do you think, Sandy?\" Harry Parkhurst asked the Scotch assistant  surgeon.    \"I know nothing about it, except what I have read. They say that the  country is healthy; but it stands to reason that this cannot be so  while you have got rivers with swamps and jungles and such heat as this.  However, we have a good supply of quinine on board, and with that and  our allowance of spirits, I hope that we shan't, as Morrison says, have  half the ship's company down with the fever. It is all in our favor that  we have only just come out, for they say that newcomers can resist  the effects of these tropical rivers much better than those whose  constitution has been weakened by a residence in the country. As to the  sport, I have no desire to kill any animal that does not meddle with me.  My business is all the other way, and if any of you get mauled, I will  do my best to help the doctor to pull you through; but I am very well  on board the ship, and have no desire to go tramping about among the  swamps, whether it be to hunt animals or fight Malays.\"    \"You think that everyone should stick to his last, Sandy,\" Dick said  with a laugh. \"Well, I only wish there were more on board of your  opinion, for that would give more chances to us who like to stretch our  legs ashore for a change.\"    \"I can stretch my legs here if I want to,\" the Scotchman said quietly,  \"and am not anxious to do more. I suppose, if there are expeditions  against the Malays, I shall have to go with them; but the fewer of them  there are the better I shall be pleased.\"    The talk was more serious aft, where the doctor and first lieutenant  were dining with the captain. It ended by the latter saying, \"Well,  Doctor, if what your friend Hassan said be true, we are likely enough to  have our hands pretty full, and shall have to watch this fellow Sehi as  sharply as we do his neighbors. He is not under our protection yet, and  if he sends his prahus down the river to plunder on the coast, as Hassan  says, he is not the sort of character likely to do us credit, and  the position of a British Resident with him would be the reverse of a  pleasant one. However, we must hope that he is not as black as he is  painted. He has evidently put the other chiefs' backs up, and we must  receive their reports of him with some doubt. However, I have no doubt  that, if he turns out badly, we shall be able to give him a lesson that  will be of benefit to him.\"    The first day's voyage up the river by no means came up to the  anticipations of the midshipmen as to the country through which they  were to pass. The width of the river varied from a quarter of a mile to  three hundred yards; the banks on each side were lined with mangroves,  presenting a dreary and monotonous aspect. Progress was slow, the steam  launch going ahead and sounding the depth of water, the captain having  but little faith in the assertion of the native pilot that he was  perfectly acquainted with every bank and shallow. Being now the dry  season, the tops of many of these shoals were dry, and numbers of  alligators were lying half in and half out of the water, basking in the  sun.    Several of the officers who possessed rifles amused themselves by  shooting at these creatures, but it was very rarely that any attention  was paid to their firing, the balls glancing off the scaly armor without  the alligators appearing to be conscious of anything unusual. There was  more amusement in watching how, when the swell of the steamer rushed  through the shallow water and broke on the shoals, the reptiles turned  and scrambled back into the river, evidently alarmed at this, to them,  strange phenomenon.    \"I should not care about bathing here, Davis,\" Harry Parkhurst remarked  to the old sailor.    \"You are right, sir; I would rather have a stand up fight with the  Malays than trust myself for two minutes in this muddy water. Why, they  are worse than sharks, sir; a shark does hoist his fin as a signal that  he is cruising about, but these chaps come sneaking along underneath the  water, and the first you know about them is that they have got you by  the leg.\"    \"Which is the worse, Davis, a bite from an alligator or a shark?\"    \"Well,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7353"],[0,"Birds in Town & Village (#4)"],[1," my head, just brushing it with his wings, then  returned to his perch.  At intervals of a few moments he repeated this  action, and when I remarked that he probably resented the presence of a  stranger, Melford exclaimed, \"Oh, no, he wants to play with you--that's  all.\"    His manner of playing was rather startling. So long as I kept my eyes on  him he remained motionless, but the instant my attention wandered, or  when in speaking I looked at my companion, the sudden violent dash at my  head would be made.    I was assured by Melford that his birds never carried off and concealed  bright objects, a habit which it has been said the jay, as well as the  magpie, possesses.    \"What would he do with this shilling if I tossed it to him?\" I asked.    \"Catch it,\" he returned. \"It would simply be play to him, but he  wouldn't carry it off.\"    I tossed up the shilling, and the bird had perhaps expected me to do so,  as he deftly caught it just as a dog catches a biscuit when you toss one  to him. After keeping it a few moments in his beak, he put it down at  his side. I took out four more shilling pieces and tossed them quickly  one by one, and he caught them without a miss and placed them one by one  with the other, not scattered about, but in a neat pile. Then, seeing  that I had no more shillings he flew off.    After these few playful passages with one of his birds, I could  understand Melford's feeling about his free pet jays, magpies and  jackdaws; they were not merely birds to him, but rather like so many  delightful little children in the beautiful shape of birds.    * * *    There was no rookery in or near the village, but a large flock of rooks  were always to be seen feeding and sunning themselves in some level  meadows near the river. It struck me one day as a very fine sight, when  an old bird, who looked larger and blacker and greyer-faced than the  others, and might have been the father and leader of them all, got up on  a low post, and with wide-open beak poured forth a long series of most  impressive caws. One always wonders at the meaning of such displays. Is  the old bird addressing the others in the rook language on some matter  of great moment; or is he only expressing some feeling in the only  language he has--those long, hoarse, uninflected sounds; and if so, what  feeling? Probably a very common one. The rooks appeared happy and  prosperous, feeding in the meadow grass in that June weather, with the  hot sun shining on their glossy coats. Their days of want were long past  and forgotten; the anxious breeding period was over; the tempest in the  tall trees; the annual slaughter of the young birds--all past and  forgotten. The old rook was simply expressing the old truth, that life  was worth living.    These rooks were usually accompanied by two or three or more crows--a  bird of so ill-repute that the most out-and-out enthusiast for  protection must find it hard to say a word in its favour. At any rate,  the rooks must think, if they think at all, that this frequent visitor  and attendant of theirs is more kin than kind. I have related in a  former work that I once saw a peregrine strike down and kill an owl--a  sight that made me gasp with astonishment. But I am inclined to think of  this act as only a slip, a slight aberration, on the part of the falcon,  so universal is the sense of relationship among the kinds that have the  rapacious habit; or, at the worst, it was merely an isolated act of  deviltry and daring of the sharp-winged pirate of the sky, a sudden  assertion of over-mastering energy and power, and a very slight offence  compared with that of the crow when he carries off and devours his  callow little cousins of the rookery.    * * *    One of the first birds I went out to seek--perhaps the most medicinal of  all birds to see--was the kingfisher; but he was not anywhere on the  river margin, although suitable places were plentiful enough, and  myriads of small fishes were visible in the shallow water, seen at rest  like dim-pointed stripes beneath the surface, and darting away and  scattering outwards, like a flight of arrows, at any person's approach.  Walking along the river bank one day, when the place was still new to  me, I discovered a stream, and following it up arrived at a spot where a  clump of trees overhung the water, casting on it a deep shade. On the  other side of the stream buttercups grew so thickly that the glazed  petals of the flowers were touching; the meadow was one broad expanse of  brilliant yellow. I had not been standing half a minute in the shade  before the bird I had been seeking darted out from the margin, almost  beneath my feet, and then, instead of flying up or down stream, sped  like an arrow across the field of buttercups. It was a very bright day,  and the bird going from me with the sunshine full on it, appeared  entirely of a shining, splendid green.  Never had I seen the kingfisher  in such favourable circumstances; flying so low above the flowery level  that the swiftly vibrating wings must have touched the yellow petals; he  was like a waif from some far tropical land. The bird was tropical, but  I doubt if there exists within the tropics anything to compare with a  field of buttercups--such large and unbroken surfaces of the most  brilliant colour in nature. The first bird's mate appeared a minute  later, flying in the same direction, and producing the same splendid  effect, and also green. These two alone were seen, and only on this  occasion, although I often revisited the spot, hoping to find them  again.    Now, the kingfisher is blue, and I am puzzled to know why, on this one  occasion, it appeared green. I have, in a former work, _Argentine  Ornithology_, described a contrary effect in a small and beautiful  tyrant-bird, _Cyanotis azarae_, variously called, in the vernacular,  \"All-colored or Many-colored Kinglet.\" It has a little blue on its head,  but its entire back, from the nape to the tail, is deep green. It lives  in beds of bulrushes, and when seen flying from the spectator in a very  strong light, at a distance of twenty or thirty yards, its colour in  appearance is bright cerulean blue. It is a sunlight effect, but how  produced is a mystery to me. In the case of the two green kingfishers, I  am inclined to think that the yellow of that shining field of buttercups  in some way produced the illusion.    Why are these exquisite birds so rare, even in situations so favourable  to them as the one I have described? Are they killed by severe frosts?  An ornithological friend from Oxfordshire assures me that it will take  several favourable seasons to make good the losses of the late terrible  winter of 1891-92. But this, as every ornithologist knows, is only a  part of the truth. The large number of stuffed kingfishers under glass  shades that one sees in houses of all descriptions, in town and country,  but most frequently in the parlours of country cottages and inns, tell a  melancholy story. Some time ago a young man showed me three stuffed  kingfishers in a case, and informed me that he had shot them at a place  (which he named) quite close to London. He said that these three birds  were the last of their kind ever seen there; that he had gone, week  after week and watched and waited, until one by one, at long intervals,  he had secured them all; and that two years had passed since the last  one was killed, and no other kingfisher had been seen at the place. He  added that the waterside which these birds had frequented was resorted  to by crowds of London working people on Saturday afternoons, Sundays  and other holidays; the fact that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of pairs  of tired eyes would have been freshened and gladdened by the sight of  their rare gem-like beauty only made him prouder of his achievement.  This young man was a cockney of the small shop-keeping class--a  Philistine of the Philistines--hence there was no call to feel surprise  at his self-glorification over such a matter. But what shall we say of  that writer whose masterly works on English rural life are familiar to  everyone, who is regarded as first among \"lovers of nature,\" when he  relates that he invariably carried a gun when out of doors, mainly with  the object of shooting any kingfisher he might chance to see, as the  dead bird always formed an acceptable present to the cottager's wife,  who would get it stuffed and keep it as an ornament on her parlour  mantelshelf!    Happily for the kingfisher, and for human beings who love nature, the  old idea that beautiful birds were meant to be destroyed for fun by  anyone and everyone, from the small-brained, detestable cockney  sportsman I have mentioned, to the gentlemen who write books about the  beauties of nature, is now gradually giving place to this new one--that  it would be better to preserve the beautiful things we possess. Half a  century before the author of \"Wild Life in a Southern Country\" amused  himself by carrying a gun to shoot kingfishers, the inhabitants of that  same county of Wiltshire were bathed in tears--so I read in an old  Salisbury newspaper--at the tragic death of a young gentleman of great  distinction, great social charm, great promise. He was out shooting  swallows with a friend who, firing at a passing swallow, had the  misfortune to shoot and kill _him._    At the present time when gentlemen practise a little at flying birds, to  get their hand in before the first of September, they shoot sparrows as  a rule, or if they shoot swallows, which afford them better practice,  they do not say anything about it.          IV      Where the stream broadened and mixed with the river, there existed a  dense and extensive rush-bed--an island of rushes separated by a deep  channel, some twelve or fourteen yards in width from the bank. This was  a favourite nesting-place of the sedge-warblers; occasionally as many as  a dozen birds could be heard singing at the same time,"]]]
