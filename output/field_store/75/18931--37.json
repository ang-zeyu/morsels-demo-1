The family and descendants of Dugald Ciar Mhor lived chiefly in the  mountains between Loch Lomond and Loch Katrine, and occupied a good deal  of property there--whether by sufferance, by the right of the sword,  which it was never safe to dispute with them, or by legal titles of  various kinds, it would be useless to inquire and unnecessary to detail.  Enough;--there they certainly were--a people whom their most powerful  neighbours were desirous to conciliate, their friendship in peace being  very necessary to the quiet of the vicinage, and their assistance in war  equally prompt and effectual.    Rob Roy MacGregor Campbell, which last name he bore in consequence of the  Acts of Parliament abolishing his own, was the younger son of Donald  MacGregor of Glengyle, said to have been a Lieutenant-Colonel (probably  in the service of James II.), by his wife, a daughter of Campbell of  Glenfalloch. Rob's own designation was of Inversnaid; but he appears to  have acquired a right of some kind or other to the property or possession  of Craig Royston, a domain of rock and forest, lying on the east side of  Loch Lomond, where that beautiful lake stretches into the dusky mountains  of Glenfalloch.    The time of his birth is uncertain. But he is said to have been active in  the scenes of war and plunder which succeeded the Revolution; and  tradition affirms him to have been the leader in a predatory incursion  into the parish of Kippen, in the Lennox, which took place in the year  1691. It was of almost a bloodless character, only one person losing his  life; but from the extent of the depredation, it was long distinguished  by the name of the Her'-ship, or devastation, of Kippen.* The time of his  death is also uncertain, but as he is said to have survived the year  1733, and died an aged man, it is probable he may have been twenty-five  about the time of the Her'-ship of Kippen, which would assign his birth  to the middle of the 17th century.    * See _Statistcal Account of Scotland,_ 1st edition, vol. xviii. p. 332.  Parish of * Kippen.    In the more quiet times which succeeded the Revolution, Rob Roy, or Red  Robert, seems to have exerted his active talents, which were of no mean  order, as a drover, or trader in cattle, to a great extent. It may well  be supposed that in those days no Lowland, much less English drovers,  ventured to enter the Highlands. The cattle, which were the staple  commodity of the mountains, were escorted down to fairs, on the borders  of the Lowlands, by a party of Highlanders, with their arms rattling  around them; and who dealt, however, in all honour and good faith with  their Southern customers. A fray, indeed, would sometimes arise, when the  Lowlandmen, chiefly Borderers, who had to supply the English market, used  to dip their bonnets in the next brook, and wrapping them round their  hands, oppose their cudgels to the naked broadswords, which had not  always the superiority. I have heard from aged persons who had been  engaged in such affrays, that the Highlanders used remarkably fair play,  never using the point of the sword, far less their pistols or daggers; so  that                   With many a stiff thwack and many a bang,                     Hard crabtree and cold iron rang.    A slash or two, or a broken head, was easily accommodated, and as the  trade was of benefit to both parties, trifling skirmishes were not  allowed to interrupt its harmony. Indeed it was of vital interest to the  Highlanders, whose income, so far as derived from their estates, depended  entirely on the sale of black cattle; and a sagacious and experienced  dealer benefited not only himself, but his friends and neighbours, by his  speculations. Those of Rob Roy were for several years so successful as to  inspire general confidence, and raise him in the estimation of the  country in which he resided.    His importance was increased by the death of his father, in consequence  of which he succeeded to the management of his nephew Gregor MacGregor of  Glengyle's property, and, as his tutor, to such influence with the clan  and following as was due to the representative of Dugald Ciar. Such  influence was the more uncontrolled, that this family of the MacGregors  seemed to have refused adherence to MacGregor of Glencarnock, the  ancestor of the present Sir Ewan MacGregor, and asserted a kind of  independence.    It was at this time that Rob Roy acquired an interest by purchase,  wadset, or otherwise, to the property of Craig Royston already mentioned.  He was in particular favour, during this prosperous period of his life,  with his nearest and most powerful neighbour, James, first Duke of  Montrose, from whom he received many marks of regard. His Grace consented  to give his nephew and himself a right of property on the estates of  Glengyle and Inversnaid, which they had till then only held as kindly  tenants. The Duke also, with a view to the interest of the country and  his own estate, supported our adventurer by loans of money to a  considerable amount, to enable him to carry on his speculations in the  cattle trade.    Unfortunately that species of commerce was and is liable to sudden  fluctuations; and Rob Roy was, by a sudden depression of markets, and, as  a friendly tradition adds, by the bad faith of a partner named MacDonald,  whom he had imprudently received into his confidence, and intrusted with  a considerable sum of money, rendered totally insolvent. He absconded, of  course--not empty-handed, if it be true, as stated in an advertisement  for his apprehension, that he had in his possession sums to the amount of  L1000 sterling, obtained from several noblemen and gentlemen under  pretence of purchasing cows for them in the Highlands. This advertisement  appeared in June 1712, and was several times repeated. It fixes the  period when Rob Roy exchanged his commercial adventures for speculations  of a very different complexion.*    * See Appendix, No. I.    He appears at this period first to have removed from his ordinary  dwelling at Inversnaid, ten or twelve Scots miles (which is double the  number of English) farther into the Highlands, and commenced the lawless  sort of life which he afterwards followed. The Duke of Montrose, who  conceived himself deceived and cheated by MacGregor's conduct, employed  legal means to recover the money lent to him. Rob Roy's landed property  was attached by the regular form of legal procedure, and his stock and  furniture made the subject of arrest and sale.    It is said that this diligence of the law, as it is called in Scotland,  which the English more bluntly term distress, was used in this case with  uncommon severity, and that the legal satellites, not usually the  gentlest persons in the world, had insulted MacGregor's wife, in a manner  which would have aroused a milder man than he to thoughts of unbounded  vengeance. She was a woman of fierce and haughty temper, and is not  unlikely to have disturbed the officers in the execution of their duty,  and thus to have incurred ill treatment, though, for the sake of  humanity, it is to be hoped that the story sometimes told is a popular  exaggeration. It is certain that she felt extreme anguish at being  expelled from the banks of Loch Lomond, and gave vent to her feelings in  a fine piece of pipe-music, still well known to amateurs by the name of  \"Rob Roy's Lament.\"    The fugitive is thought to have found his first place of refuge in Glen  Dochart, under the Earl of Breadalbane's protection; for, though that  family had been active agents in the destruction of the MacGregors in  former times, they had of late years sheltered a great many of the name  in their old possessions. The Duke of Argyle was also one of Rob Roy's  protectors, so far as to afford him, according to the Highland phrase,  wood and water--the shelter, namely, that is afforded by the forests and  lakes of an inaccessible country.    The great men of the Highlands in that time, besides being anxiously  ambitious to keep up what was called their Following, or military  retainers, were also desirous to have at their disposal men of resolute  character, to whom the world and the world's law were no friends, and who  might at times ravage the lands or destroy the tenants of a feudal enemy,  without bringing responsibility on their patrons. The strife between the  names of Campbell and Graham, during the civil wars of the seventeenth  century, had been stamped with mutual loss and inveterate enmity. The  death of the great Marquis of Montrose on the one side, the defeat at  Inverlochy, and cruel plundering of Lorn, on the other, were reciprocal  injuries not likely to be forgotten. Rob Roy was, therefore, sure of  refuge in the country of the Campbells, both as having assumed their  name, as connected by his mother with the family of Glenfalloch, and as  an enemy to the rival house of Montrose. The extent of Argyle's  possessions, and the power of retreating thither in any emergency, gave  great encouragement to the bold schemes of revenge which he had adopted.    This was nothing short of the maintenance of a predatory war against the  Duke of Montrose, whom he considered as the author of his exclusion from  civil society, and of the outlawry to which he had been sentenced by  letters of horning and caption (legal writs so called), as well as the  seizure of his goods, and adjudication of his landed property. Against  his Grace, therefore, his tenants, friends, allies, and relatives, he  disposed himself to employ every means of annoyance in his power; and  though this was a circle sufficiently extensive for active depredation,  Rob, who professed himself a Jacobite, took the liberty of extending his  sphere of operations against all whom he chose to consider"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7026"],[0,"Children's Edition of Touching Incidents and Remarkable Answers to Prayer (#4)"],[1,"were well-meaning but deluded people. He was well versed in  all the subtle arguments of infidel writers, had studied the Bible quite  carefully, and could argue against it in the most plausible manner.  Courteous and kind to all, few could be offended at his frank avowal of  infidel principles, or resent his keen, half-jovial sarcasms upon the  peculiarities of some weak-minded, though sincere members of the church.      But Mr. Lowe saw and acknowledged the saving influence of the MORALITY  of Christianity. He had especially, good sense enough to confess that  the Sunday School was a noble moral enterprise. He was not blind to the  fact, abundantly proved by all our criminal records, that few children  trained under her influences ever grow up to vice and crime. Hence his  permission for his children to attend the Sunday School.    Among the many children who knelt as penitents at the altar in the little  vestry, one bright beautiful Lord's Day, were Sarah Lowe and her brother  and sister. It was a moving sight to see that gentle girl, with a mature  thoughtfulness far beyond her years, take that younger brother and sister  by the hand, and kneel with them at the mercy-seat--a sight to heighten  the joy of angels.    When the children had told their mother what they had done and expressed  a determination to try to be Christians; she, too, was greatly moved.  She had been early trained in the principles and belief of Christianity,  and had never renounced her early faith. Naturally confiding, with a  yielding, conciliatory spirit, she had never obtruded her sentiments  upon the notice of her husband, nor openly opposed any of his peculiar  views. But now, when her little ones gathered around her and spoke of  their new love for the Savior, their joy and peace and hope, she wept.  All the holy influences of her own childhood and youth seemed breathing  upon her heart. She remembered the faithful sermons of the old pastor  whose hands had baptized her. She remembered, too, the family altar, and  the prayers which were offered morning and evening by her sainted father.  She remembered the counsels of her good mother now in heaven. All these  memories came crowding back upon her and under their softening influences  she almost felt herself a child again.    [Illustration: It was a moving sight to see that gentle girl take that  younger brother and sister by the hand and kneel with them at the mercy  seat--a sight to heighten the joy of angels.]    When Mr. Lowe first became aware of the change in his children, he was  sorely puzzled to know what to do. He had given his consent for them to  attend the Sunday School, and should he now be offended because they had  yielded to its influence? Ought he not rather to have expected this? And  after all, would what they called religion make them any worse children?  Though at first quite disturbed in his feelings, he finally concluded  upon second thought to say nothing to them upon the subject, but to let  things go on as usual.    But not so those happy young converts. They could not long hold their  peace. They must tell their father also what they had experienced. Mr.  Lowe heard them, but he made no attempt to ridicule their simple faith,  as had been his usual course with others. They were HIS children, and  none could boast of better. Still, he professed to see in their present  state of mind nothing but youthful feeling, excited by the peculiar  circumstances of the last few weeks. But when they began in their childish  ardor to exhort him also to seek the Lord, he checked their simple  earnestness with a peculiar sternness which said to them: \"The act must  not be repeated.\"    The next Sunday the father could not prevent a feeling of loneliness as  he saw his household leave for church. The three children, with their  mother and Joseph, the hired boy, to drive and take care of the horse;  all packed into the old commodious carriage and started off. Never before  had he such peculiar feelings as when he watched them slowly descending  the hill.    To dissipate these emotions he took a dish of salt and started up the  hill to a \"mountain pasture\" where his young cattle were enclosed for  the season. It was a beautiful day in October, that queen month of the  year. A soft melancholy breathed in the mild air of the mellow \"Indian  summer,\" and the varying hues of the surrounding forests, and the signs  of decay seen upon every side, all combined to deepen the emotions which  the circumstances of the morning had awakened.    His sadness increased; and as his path opened out into a bright, sunny  spot far up on the steep hillside, he seated himself upon a mossy knoll  and thought. Before him lay the beautiful valley guarded on either side  by its lofty hills, and watered by its placid river. It was a lovely  picture; and as his eye rested upon the village, nestling down among its  now gorgeous shade-trees and scarlet shrubbery, he could not help thinking  of that company who were then gathered in the little church, with its  spire pointing heavenward nor of asking himself the question: \"Why are  they there?\"    While thus engaged, his attention was attracted by the peculiar chirping  of a ground sparrow near by. He turned, and but a few feet from him he  saw a large black snake, with its head raised about a foot above its  body, which lay coiled upon the ground. Its jaws were distended, its  forked tongue played around its open mouth, flashing in the sunlight  like a small lambent flame, while its eyes were intently fixed upon the  bird. There was a clear, sparkling light about those eyes that was fearful  to behold--they fairly flashed with their peculiar bending fascination.  The poor sparrow was fluttering around a circle of some few feet in  diameter, the circle becoming smaller at each gyration of the infatuated  bird. She appeared conscious of her danger, yet unable to break the spell  that bound her. Nearer and still nearer she fluttered her little wings  to those open jaws; smaller and smaller grew the circle, till at last,  with a quick convulsive cry; she fell into the mouth of the snake.    As Mr. Lowe watched the bird he became deeply interested in her fate.  He started a number of times to destroy the reptile and thus liberate  the sparrow from her danger, but an unconquerable curiosity to see the  end restrained him. All day long the scene just described was before  him. He could not forget it nor dismiss it from his mind. The last cry  of that poor little bird sinking into the jaws of death was constantly  ringing in his ears, and the sadness of the morning increased.    [Illustration]    Returning to his house, he seated himself in his library and attempted  to read. What could be the matter? Usually he could command his thoughts  at will, but now he could think of nothing but the scene on the mountain,  or the little company in the house of God. Slowly passed the hours, and  many times did he find himself, in spite of his resolution not to do so,  looking down the road for the head of his dapple gray to emerge from the  valley. It seemed a long time before the rumbling of the wheels was at  length heard upon the bridge which crossed the mountain stream, followed  shortly by the old carry-all creeping slowly up the hill.    The return of the family somewhat changed the course of his thoughts.  They did not say any thing to him about the good meeting they had enjoyed,  and who had been converted since the last Lord's day; but they talked  it all over among themselves, and how could he help hearing? He learned  all about \"how good farmer Haskell talked,\" and \"how humble and devoted  Esquire Wiseman appeared,\" and \"how happy Benjamin and Samuel were\";  though he seemed busy with his book and pretended to take no notice of  what was said.    It was, indeed, true then that the old lawyer had become pious. He had  heard the news before, but did not believe it. Now he had learned it as  a fact. That strong-minded man who had been a skeptic all his days, had  ridiculed and opposed religion, was now a subject of \"the children's  revival.\" What could it mean? Was there something in religion after all?  Could it be that what these poor fanatics, as he had always called them,  said about the future world was correct? Was there a heaven, and a hell,  and a God of justice? Were his darling children right, and was he alone  wrong? Such were the thoughts of the boasted infidel, as he sat there  listening to the half-whispered conversation of his happy children.    Little Ella came and climbed to her long accustomed place upon her  father's knee, and throwing her arms around his neck, laid her glowing  cheek, half-hidden by the clustering curls, against his own. He knew by  her appearance she had something to say but did not dare to say it. To  remove this fear, he began to question her about Sunday School. He  inquired after her teacher and who were her classmates, what she learned,  etc. Gradually the shyness wore away, and the heart of the innocent  praying child came gushing forth. She told him all that had been done  that day--what her teacher had said of the prayer meeting at noon, and  who spoke, and how many went forward for prayers. Then folding her arms  more closely around his neck, and kissing him tenderly, she added:    \"Oh, father, I do wish you had been there!\"    \"Why do you wish I had been there, Ella?\"    \"Oh, just to see how happy Nellie Winslow looked while her grandfather  was telling us children how much he loved the Savior, and how sorry he  was that he did not give his heart to his heavenly Father when he was  young. Then he laid his hand on Nellie's head, who was sitting by his  side, and said: 'I thank God that he ever gave me a little praying  granddaughter to lead me to the Savior.' And, father, I never in all my  life saw anyone look so happy as Nellie did.\"    Mr. Lowe made no reply--how could he? Could he not see where the heart  of "]]]
