All which commodities the sayd Thomas and William were  authorised by the owner in the letter before mentioned to barter and sell  away at Santa Cruz. And in lieu of such mony as should arise of the sale of  those goods they were appointed to returne backe into England good store of  Orchell (which is a certaine kinde of mosse growing vpon high rocks, in  those dayes much vsed to die withall) some quantity of sugar, and certaine  hundreds, of kid skinnes. For the procuring of which and of other  commodities at the best and first hand the sayd Thomas and William were to  make their abode at Santa Cruz, and to remaine there as factours for the  abouesayd M. Nicolas Thorne.    And here also I thought good to signifie, that in the sayd letters mention  is made of one Thomas Tison an English man, who before the foresayd yere  1526 had found the way to the West Indies, and was there resident, vnto  whom the sayd M. Nicolas Thorne sent certaine armour and other commodities  specified in the letter aforesayd.           *       *       *       *       *    A description of the fortunate Ilands, otherwise called the Ilands of    Canaria, with their strange fruits and commodities: composed by Thomas    Nicols English man, who remained there the space of seuen yeeres    together.    Mine intent is particularly to speake of the Canaria Ilands, which are  seuen in number, wherein I dwelt the space of seuen yeres and more, because  I finde such variety in sundry writers, and especially great vntruths, in a  booke called The New found world Antarctike, set out by a French man called  Andrew Thenet, the which his booke he dedicated to the Cardinall of Sens,  keeper of the great seale of France.    It appeareth by the sayd booke that he had read the works of sundry  Phylosophers, Astronomers, and Cosmographers, whose opinions he gathered  together. But touching his owne trauell, which he affirmeth, I refer to the  iudgement of the expert in our dayes, and therefore for mine owne part I  write of these Canaria Ilands, as time hath taught me in many yeres.      The Iland of Canaria.    The Iland of Canaria is almost equal in length and bredth, containing 12  leagues in length, touching the which as principall and the residue, the  Spanyards holde opinion, that they discouered the same in their nauigation  toward America, but the Portugals say, that their nation first found the  sayd Ilands in their nauigation toward Aethiopia and the East Indies.    [Sidenote: English men at the first conquest of the Canaries.] But truth it  is that the Spanyards first conquered these Ilands, with diuers English  gentlemen in their company, whose posterity this present day inioyeth them.  Some write that this Iland was named Canaria by meane of the number of dogs  which there were found: as for example, Andrew Theuet sayth, that one Iuba  carried two dogs from thence: but that opinion could I neuer learne by any  of the naturall people of the countrey, although I haue talked with many in  my time and with many of their children. For trueth it is, that there were  dogs, but such as are in all the Northwest lands, and some part of the West  India, which serued the people in stead of sheepe for victual. But of some  of the conquerors of those Ilands I haue heard say that the reason why they  were called the Canaria Islands is, because there grow generally in them  all fouresquare canes in great multitude together, which being touched will  cast out a liquor as white as milke, which liquor is ranke poison, and at  the first entry into these Ilands some of the discouerers were therewith  poisoned: for many yeeres after that conquest the inhabitants began to  plant both wine and sugar, so that Canaria was not so called by sugar  canes.    The people which first inhabited this land were called Canaries by the  conquerors, they were clothed in goat skinnes made like vnto a loose  cassocke, they dwelt in caues in the rocks, [Footnote: Many thousand  persons, including a colony of free negroes, still reside in cave dwellings  in the hill side.] in great amity and brotherly loue. They spake all one  language: their chiefe feeding was gelt dogges, goates, and goates milke,  their bread was made of barley meale and goates milke, called Gofia, which  they vse at this day, and thereof I haue eaten diuers times, for it is  accounted exceeding holesome.    Touching the originall of these people some holde opinion, that the Romans  which dwelt in Africa exiled them thither, as well men as women, their  tongues being cut out of their heads, for blasphemy against the Romane  gods. But howsoeuer it were, their language was speciall, and not mixed  with Romane speech or Arabian.    This Iland is now the principallest of all the rest, not in fertility, but  by reason it is the seat of iustice and gouernment of all the residue. This  Iland hath a speciall Gouernour for the Iland onely, yet notwithstanding  there are three Iudges called Auditours, who are superiour Iudges, and all  in one ioyntly proceed as the Lord Chanceller of any realme.    To this city from all the other Ilands come all such by appeale, as haue  sustained any wrong, and these good Iudges do remedy the same. [Sidenote:  Ciuitas Palmarum.] The city is called Ciuitas Palmarum, it hath a  beautifull Cathedrall church, with all dignities thereunto pertaining. For  the publike weale of the Iland there are sundry Aldermen of great  authority, who haue a councell house by themselues. The city is not onely  beautifull, but the citizens curious and gallant in apparell. And after any  raine or foule weather a man may goe cleane in Veluet slippers, because the  ground is sandy, the aire very temperate, without extreame heat or colde.    They reape wheat in February, and againe in May, which is excellent good,  and maketh bread as white as snow. This Iland hath in it other three  townes, the one called Telde, the second Galder, and the third Guia. It  hath also twelue sugar houses called Ingenios, in which they make great  quantity of good sugar. [Sidenote: The planting and growth of sugar canes.]  The maner of the growth of sugar is in this sort, a good ground giueth  foorth fruit nine times in 18 yere: that is to say, the first is called  Planta which is layd along in a furrow, so that the water of a sluce may  come ouer euery roote being couered with earth: this root bringeth foorth  sundry canes, and so consequently all the rest. It groweth two yeeres  before the yeelding of profit, and not sixe moneths, as Andrew Theuet the  French man writeth.    [Sidenote: The making of sugar.] Then are they cut euen with the ground,  and the tops and leaues called Coholia cut off, and the canes bound into  bundels like faggots, and so are caried to the sugar house called Ingenio,  where they are ground in a mill, and the iuyce thereof conueyed by a  conduct to a great vessell made for the purpose, where it is boiled till it  waxe thicke, and then is it put into a fornace of earthen pots of the molde  of a sugar loafe, and then is it carried to another house, called a purging  house where it is placed to purge the blacknesse with a certaine clay that  is layd thereon. Of the remainder in the cauldron is made a second sort  called Escumas, and of the purging liquor that droppeth from the white  sugar is made a third sort, and the remainder is called Panela or Netas,  the refuse of all the purging is called Remiel or Malasses: and thereof is  made another sort called Refinado.    When this first fruit is in this sort gathered, called Planta, then the  Cane field where it grew is burned ouer with sugar straw to the stumps of  the first canes, and being husbanded, watred and trimmed, at the end of  other two yeeres it yeeldeth the second fruit called Zoca. The third fruit  is called Tertia Zoca, the fourth Quarta Zoca, and so orderly the rest, til  age causeth the olde Canes to be planted againe.    [Sidenote: Wine.] This Iland hath singular good wine, especially in the  towne of Telde, and sundry sorts of good fruits, as Batatas, Mellons,  Peares, Apples, Oranges, Limons, Pomgranats, Figs Peaches of diuers sorts,  and many other fruits; [Sidenote: Plantano.] but especially the Plantano  which groweth neere brooke sides, it is a tree that hath no timber in it,  but groweth directly vpward with the body, hauing maruelous thicke leaues,  and euery leafe at the toppe of two yards long and almost halfe a yard  broad. The tree neuer yeeldeth fruit but once, and then is cut downe; in  whose place springeth another, and so still continueth. The fruit groweth  on a branch, and euery tree yeeldeth two or three of those branches, which  beare some more and some lesse, as some forty and some thirty, the fruit is  like a Cucumber, and when it is ripe it is blacke, and in eating more  delicate then any conserue.    This Iland is sufficiently prouided of Oxen, Kine, Camels, Goats, Sheepe,  Capons, Hens, Ducks, and Pidgeons, and great Partridges. Wood is the thing  that most wanteth: and because I haue particularly to intreat of the other  sixe Ilands, I leaue further inlarging of Canaria, which standeth in 27  degrees distant from the Equator.      The Ile of Tenerif.    The Iland of Tenerif standeth in 27 degrees and a halfe from the equator,  and is distant from Canaria 12 leagues Northward. This Iland containeth 17  leagues in length, and the land lieth high in forme of a ridge of sowen  lande in some part of England, and in the midst of the sayd place standeth  a round hill called Pico Deteithe, situated in this sort. The top of this  pike conteineth of heigth directly vpward 15 leagues and more, which is 45  English miles, out of the which often times"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8112"],[0,"Houses and House-Life of the American Aborigines (#4)"],[1,"Status of barbarism descent had become changed to the male  line among the Grecian tribes, with the exception of the Lycians,  and among the Italian tribes, with the exception of the Etruscans.  Between the two extremes, represented by the two rules of descent,  three entire ethnical periods intervene, covering many thousands of  years.    As intermarriage in the gens was prohibited, it withdrew its members  from the evils of consanguine marriages, and thus tended to increase  the vigor of the stock. The gens came into being upon three  principal conceptions, namely, the bond of kin, a pure lineage  through descent in the female line, and non-intermarriage in the gens.  When the idea of a gens was developed, it would naturally have taken  the form of gentes in pairs, because the children of the males were  excluded, and because it was equally necessary to organize both  classes of descendants. With two gentes started into being  simultaneously the whole result would have been attained, since the  males and females of one gens would marry the females and males of  the other, and the children, following the gentes of their  respective mothers, would be divided between them. Resting on the  bond of kin as its cohesive principal the gens afforded to each  individual member that personal protection which no other existing  power could give.    After enumerating the rights, privileges, and obligations of its  members, it will be necessary to follow the gens in its organic  relations to a phratry tribe and confederacy, in order to find the  uses to which it was applied, the privileges which it conferred, and  the principles which it fostered. The gentes of the Iroquois will be  taken as the standard exemplification of this institution in the  Ganowaman family. They had carried their scheme of government from  the gens to the confederacy, making it complete in each of its parts,  and an excellent illustration of the capabilities of the gentile  organization in its archaic form.    When discovered the Iroquois were in the Lower Status of barbarism,  and well advanced in the arts of life pertaining to this condition.  They manufactured nets, twine, and rope from filaments of bark, wove  belts and burden straps, with warp and woof from the same materials,  they manufactured earthen vessels and pipes from clay mixed with  silicious materials and hardened by fire, some of which were  ornamented with rude medallions, they cultivated maize, beans,  squashes, and tobacco in garden beds, and made unleavened bread from  pounded maize, which they boiled in earthen vessels, [Footnote:  These loaves or cakes were about six inches in diameter and an inch  thick] they tanned skins into leather, with which they manufactured  kilts leggins, and moccasins, they used the bow and arrow and  war-club as their principal weapons, used flint-stone and bone  implements, wore skin garments, and were expert hunters and  fishermen They constructed long joint tenement houses large enough  to accommodate five, ten, and twenty families, and each household  practiced communism in living, but they were unacquainted with the  use of stone or adobe brick in house architecture, and with the use  of the native metals. In mental capacity and in general advancement  they were the representative branch of the Indian family north of  New Mexico General F A. Walker has sketched their military career in  two paragraphs \"The career of the Iroquois was simply terrific. They  were the scourge of God upon the continent.\" [Footnote: North  American Review April No. 1873 p. 360 Note.] From lapse of time the  Iroquois tribes have come to differ slightly in the number and in  the names of their respective gentes, the largest number being eight,  as follows:           Seneca    Cayuga   Onondaga  Oneida   Mohawks   Tuscarora    1    Wolf      Wolf     Wolf      Wolf     Wolf      Gray Wolf    2    Bear      Bear     Bear      Bear     Bear      Bear    3    Turtle    Turtle   Turtle    Turtle   Turtle    Great Turtle    4    Beaver    Beaver   Beaver                       Beaver    5    Deer      Deer     Deer                         Yellow Wolf    6    Snipe     Snipe    Snipe                        Snipe    7    Heron     Eel      Eel                          Eel    8    Hawk      Hawk     Ball                         Little Turtle      These changes show that certain gentes in some of the tribes have  become extinct through the vicissitudes of time, and that others  have been formed by the segmentation of over full gentes.    With a knowledge of the rights, privileges, and obligations of the  members of a gens, its capabilities as the unit of a social and  governmental system will be more fully understood, as well as the  manner in which it entered into the higher organizations of the  phratry tribe, and confederacy.    The gens is individualized by the following rights, privileges, and  obligations conferred and imposed upon its members, and which made  up the jus gentilicium:           I The right of electing its sachem and chiefs        II The right of deposing its sachem and chiefs       III The obligation not to marry in the gens        IV Mutual rights of inheritance of the property of deceased  members         V Reciprocal obligations of help, defense, and redress of  injuries        VI The right of bestowing names upon its members       VII The right of adopting strangers into the gens      VIII Common religious rites        IX A common burial place.         X A council of the gens      These functions and attributes gave vitality as well as  individuality to the organization and protected the personal rights  of its members. Such were the rights, privileges, and obligations of  the members of an Iroquois gens; and such were those of the members  of the gentes of the Indian tribes generally, as far as the  investigation has been carried.    For a detailed exposition of these characteristics the reader is  referred to Ancient Society, pp. 72-85.    All the members of an Iroquois gens were personally free, and they  were bound to defend each other's freedom; they were equal in  privileges and in personal rights, the sachem and chiefs claiming no  superiority; and they were a brotherhood bound together by the ties  of kin. Liberty, equality, and fraternity, though never formulated,  were cardinal principles of the gens. These facts are material,  because the gens was the unit of a social and governmental system,  the foundation upon which Indian society was organized. A structure  composed of such units would of necessity bear the impress of their  character, for as the unit so the compound. It serves to explain  that sense of independence and personal dignity universally an  attribute of Indian character.    Thus substantial and important in the social system was the gens as  it anciently existed among the American aborigines, and as it still  exists in full vitality in many Indian tribes. It was the basis of  the phratry, of the tribe, and of the confederacy of tribes.    At the epoch of European discovery the American Indian tribes  generally were organized in gentes, with descent in the female line.  In some tribes, as among the Dakotas, the gentes had fallen out; in  others, as among the Ojibwas, the Omahas, and the Mayas of Yucatan,  descent had been changed from the female to the male line.  Throughout aboriginal America the gens took its name from some  animal or inanimate object and never from a person. In this early  condition of society the individuality of persons was lost in the  gens. It is at least presumable that the gentes of the Grecian and  Latin tribes were so named at some anterior period; but when they  first came under historical notice they were named after persons. In  some of the tribes, as the Moki Village Indians of Arizona, the  members of the gens claimed their descent from the animal whose name  they bore--their remote ancestors having been transformed by the  Great Spirit from the animal into the human form. The Crane gens of  the Ojibwas have a similar legend. In some tribes the members of a  gens will not eat the animal whose name they bear, in which they are  doubtless influenced by this consideration.    With respect to the number of persons in a gens, it varied with the  number of the gentes, and with the prosperity or decadence of the  tribe. Three thousand Senecas divided equally among eight gentes  would give an average of three hundred and seventy-five persons to a  gens. Fifteen thousand Ojibwas divided equally among twenty-three  gentes would give six hundred and fifty persons to a gens. The  Cherokees would average more than a thousand to a gens. In the  present condition of the principal Indian tribes the number of  persons in each gens would range from one hundred to a thousand.    One of the oldest and most widely prevalent institutions of mankind,  the gentes have been closely identified with human progress upon  which they have exercised a powerful influence. They have been found  in tribes in the Status of savagery, in the Lower, in the Middle,  and in the Upper Status of barbarism on different continents, and in  full vitality in the Grecian and Latin tribes after civilization had  commenced. Every family of mankind, except the Polynesian, seems to  have come under the gentile organization, and to have been indebted  to it for preservation and for the means of progress. It finds its  only parallel in length of duration in systems of consanguinity,  which, springing up at a still earlier period, have remained to the  present time, although the marriage usages in which they originated  have long since disappeared.    From its early institution, and from its maintenance through such  immense stretches of time, the peculiar adaptation of the gentile  organization to mankind, while in a savage and in a barbarous state,  must be regarded as abundantly demonstrated.
