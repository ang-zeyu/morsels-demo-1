My wily head      Wagered and lost is,            [_Staring before him._    And forfeit to him it will fall  Who has never learned to fear.

But that lesson was one never taught thee.      A fool, I forgot      The one great thing;      What thou wert taught      Was to love me,  And alas! the task proved hard.  Now how shall I teach thee to fear?    SIEGFRIED [_Seizes him._        Hey! Must I help thee?      What work hast thou done?    MIME        Concerned for thy good,      In thought I was sitting:  Something of weight I would teach thee.    SIEGFRIED [_Laughing._        'Twas under the seat      That thou wert sitting;  What weighty thing foundest thou there?    MIME            [_Recovering himself more and more._    Down there I learned how to fear,  That I might teach thee, dullard.    SIEGFRIED [_With quiet wonder._        This fear then, what is it?    MIME        Thou knowest not that,      Yet wouldst from the forest      Forth to the world?  What help in the trustiest sword,  Hadst thou not learned to fear?    SIEGFRIED [_Impatiently._        What absurd      Invention is this?    MIME            [_Approaching Siegfried with more and more          confidence._        'Tis thy mother's wish      Speaking through me.      I must fulfil      The promise I gave her:      That the world and its wiles      Thou shouldst not encounter  Until thou hadst learned how to fear.    SIEGFRIED [_Vehemently_        Is it an art?      Why was I not taught?  Explain: this fearing, what is it?

SIEGFRIED [_Musing._        Wonderful truly      That must be.      Steadfast, strong  Beats my heart in my breast.      The shiver and shudder,      The fever and horror,      Burning and fainting,      Beating and trembling--  Ah, how glad I would feel them,            [_Tenderly._    Could I but learn this delight!      But how, Mime,      Can it be mine?  How, coward, could it be taught me?    MIME        Following me,      The way thou shalt find;  I have thought it all out.  I know of a dragon grim  That slays and swallows men:  Fear thou wilt learn from Fafner,      When I lead to where he lies.    SIEGFRIED        Where has he his lair?    MIME        Neidhöhl'      Named, it lies east  Towards the end of the wood.    SIEGFRIED    It lies not far from the world?    MIME    The world is quite close to the cave.    SIEGFRIED    That I may learn what this fear is,      Lead me there straightway;      Then forth to the world!  Make haste! Forge me the sword.  In the world fain I would swing it.

SIEGFRIED        Artful tricks      The idler would play me;      He is a bungler;      He should confess,  And not seek to lie his way out.      Here with the splinters!      Off with the bungler!            [_Coming to the hearth._        His father's sword      Siegfried will weld:  By him shall it be forged.            [_Flinging Mime's tools about, he sets himself          impetuously to work._    MIME        If thou hadst practised      Thy craft with care,  Thou wouldst have profited now;      But thou wert far      Too lazy to learn,  And now at need canst do nothing.    SIEGFRIED        Where the master has failed      What hope for the scholar,  Had he obeyed him in all?            [_He makes a contemptuous grimace at him._        Be off with thee!      Meddle no more,  In case with the steel I melt thee.            [_He has heaped a large quantity of charcoal on the          hearth, and keeps blowing the fire, while he screws          up the pieces of the sword in a vice and files them          to shavings._    MIME            [_Who has sat down a little way off, watches          Siegfried at work._        Why file it to bits?      There is the solder  All fused, ready to hand.    SIEGFRIED        Off with the pap,      I need it not;  With paste I fashion no sword!    MIME        Now the file is ruined,      The rasp is useless;  Why grind thus the steel to splinters?    SIEGFRIED        It must be shivered      And ground into shreds;  Only so can splinters be patched.            [_He goes on filing with great energy._    MIME [_Aside._        I see a craftsman      Is useless here;  By his own folly the fool is best served.      Look how he toils      With lusty strokes;      The steel disappears,      And still he keeps cool.            [_Siegfried has blown the fire to a bright flame._        Though I am as old      As cave and wood,  The like I never yet saw!            [_While Siegfried continues to file the piece of          the sword impetuously, Mime seats himself a little          further off._        He will forge the sword--      I see it plain--  Boldly weld it anew.  The Wanderer was right.      Where shall I hide      My luckless head?  If nothing teaches him fear,  Forfeit it falls to the boy.            [_Springing up and bending down in growing          agitation._        But woe to Mime!      If Siegfried learn fear,  The dragon will never be slain;  And, if so, how gain the ring?      Accurst dilemma!      Would I escape,  I must find out some way  Of subduing the boy for myself.    SIEGFRIED              [_Has now filed down the pieces, and puts the          filings in a crucible, which he places on the fire._        Hey, Mime! The name!--      Quick, name the sword  That I have pounded to pieces.    MIME [_Starts and turns towards Siegfried._        Nothung, that is      The name of the sword;  'Twas mother told me the tale.    SIEGFRIED            [_During the following song keeps blowing the fire          with the bellows._        Nothung! Nothung!      Conquering sword!  What blow, I wonder, broke thee.      Thy keen-edged glory      I chopped to chaff;  The splinters now I am melting.      Hoho! Hoho!      Hohei! Hohei! Hoho!      Bellows blow!      Brighten the flame!      In the woods      A tree grew wild;  It fell, by my hand hewn down.      The brown-stemmed ash      To charcoal I burned;  Now it lies heaped high on the hearth.      Hoho! Hoho!      Hohei! Hohei! Hoho!      Bellows blow!      Brighten the flame!      How bravely, brightly      The charcoal burns!  How clear and fair its fire!      With showering sparks      It leaps and glows,--      Hohei! Hoho! Hohei!--  Dissolving the splintered steel!      Hoho! Hoho!      Hohei! Hohei! Hoho!      Bellows, blow!      Brighten the flame!      Hoho! Hoho!      Hoho, hohei! Hohei!      Nothung! Nothung!      Conquering sword!  Thy steel chopped to chaff is fused;      In thine own sweat      Thou swimmest now,    [Illustration: The forging of Nothung--See p. 34]            [_He pours the glowing contents of the crucible          into a mould, which he holds up._    But soon my sword thou shalt be!    MIME            [_During the pauses in Siegfried's song, still          aside, sitting at a distance._    The sword he will forge      And vanquish Fafner,  So much I can clearly foresee;      Hoard and ring      The victor will have;  How to win them both for myself!      By wit and wiles      They shall be captured,  And safe shall be my head.            [_In the foreground, still aside._    After the fight, when athirst,  For a cooling draught he will crave;      Of fragrant juices      Gathered from herbs  The draught I will brew for him.      Let him drink but a drop,      And in slumber  Softly lapped he shall lie:      With the very sword      That he fashioned to serve him  He shall be cleared from my way,  And treasure and ring made mine.            [_He rubs his hands with satisfaction._        Ha! dull didst hold me,      Wanderer wise!      Does my subtle scheming      Please thee now?      Have I found      A path to peace?            [_He springs up joyfully, fetches several vessels,          shakes spices and herbs from them into a pot, and          tries to put it on the hearth._    SIEGFRIED            [_Has plunged the mould into a pail of water. Steam          and loud hissing ensue as it cools._        In the water flowed      A flood of fire;      Furious with hate,      Grimly it hissed;      Though scorching it ran,      In the cooling flood      No more it flows;  Stiff, stark it became,  Hard is the stubborn steel;      Yet warm blood      Shall flow thereby!      Now sweat once again,      That swift I may weld thee,  Nothung, conquering sword!            [_He thrusts the steel into the fire, and blows the          bellows violently. While doing so he watches Mime,          who, from the other side of the hearth, carefully          puts his pot on the fire._        What does the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49525"],[0,"First Lensman (#4)"],[1,"    \"Well ... it's ... I'm a lip-reader, you know.\"    \"Sure. We all are. What of it?\"    \"It's only that ... well, I saw what you and Miss Samms said to each  other out there, and if that was lovers' small talk I'm a Venerian  mud-puppy.\"    \"_Lovers!_ Who the hell ever said we were lovers?... Oh, you've been  inhaling some of dad's balloon-juice. _Lovers!_ Me and that red-headed  stinker--that jelly-brained sapadilly? _Hardly!_\"    \"Hold it, Jack!\" The big officer's voice was slightly edged.  \"You're off course--a hell of a long flit off. That girl has got  everything. She's the class of the Reservation--why, she's a regular  twelve-nineteen!\"    \"Huh?\" Amazed, young Kinnison stopped drying himself and stared. \"You  mean to say you've been giving her a miss just because....\" He had  started to say \"because you're the best friend I've got in the System,\"  but he did not.    \"Well, it would have smelled slightly cheesy, I thought.\" The other  man did not put into words, either, what both of them so deeply knew  to be the truth. \"But if you haven't got ... if it's O.K. with you, of  course....\"    \"Stand by for five seconds--I'll take you around.\"    Jack threw on his uniform, and in a few minutes the two young officers,  immaculate in the space-black-and-silver of the Patrol, made their way  toward the women's dressing rooms.    \"... but she's all right, at that ... in most ways ... I guess.\"  Kinnison was half-apologizing for what he had said. \"Outside of being  chicken-hearted and pig-headed, she's a good egg. She really  qualifies ... most of the time. But I wouldn't have her, bonus  attached, any more than she would have me. It's strictly mutual. You  won't fall for her, either, Mase; you'll want to pull one of her legs  off and beat the rest of her to death with it inside of a week--but  there's nothing like finding things out for yourself.\"    In a short time Miss Samms appeared; dressed somewhat less revealingly  than before in the blouse and kilts which were the mode of the moment.    \"Hi, Jill! This is Mase--I've told you about him. My boat-mate. Master  Electronicist Mason Northrop.\"    \"Yes, I've heard about you, 'Troncist--a lot.\" She shook hands warmly.    \"He hasn't been putting tracers on you, Jill, on accounta he figured  he'd be poaching. Can you feature that? I straightened him out, though,  in short order. Told him why, too, so he ought to be insulated against  any voltage you can generate.\"    \"Oh, you did? How sweet of you! But how ... oh, those?\" She gestured at  the powerful prism binoculars, a part of the uniform of every officer  of space.    \"Uh-huh.\" Northrop wriggled, but held firm.    \"If I'd only been as big and husky as you are,\" surveying admiringly  some six feet two of altitude and two hundred-odd pounds of hard  meat, gristle, and bone, \"I'd have grabbed him by one ankle, whirled  him around my head, and flung him into the fifteenth row of seats.  What's the matter with him, Mase, is that he was born centuries and  centuries too late. He should have been an overseer when they built  the pyramids--flogging slaves because they wouldn't step just so. Or  better yet, one of those people it told about in those funny old books  they dug up last year--liege lords, or something like that, remember?  With the power of life and death--'high, middle, and low justice',  whatever that was--over their vassals and their families, serfs, and  serving-wenches. _Especially_ serving-wenches! He likes little, cuddly  baby-talkers, who pretend to be utterly spineless and completely  brainless--eh, Jack?\"    \"Ouch! Touché, Jill--but maybe I had it coming to me, at that. Let's  call it off, shall we? I'll be seeing you two, hither or yon.\" Kinnison  turned and hurried away.    \"Want to know why he's doing such a quick flit?\" Jill grinned up at her  companion; a bright, quick grin. \"Not that he was giving up. The blonde  over there--the one in rocket red. Very few blondes can wear such a  violent shade. Dimples Maynard.\"    \"And is she ... er...?\"    \"Cuddly and baby-talkish? Uh-uh. She's a grand person. I was just  popping off; so was he. You know that neither of us really meant half  of what we said ... or ... at least....\" Her voice died away.    \"I don't know whether I do or not,\" Northrop replied, awkwardly but  honestly. \"That was savage stuff if there ever was any. I can't see for  the life of me why you two--two of the world's finest people--should  have to tear into each other that way. Do you?\"    \"I don't know that I ever thought of it like that.\" Jill caught her  lower lip between her teeth. \"He's splendid, really, and I like him a  lot--usually. We get along perfectly most of the time. We don't fight  at all except when we're too close together ... and then we fight about  anything and everything ... say, suppose that that could be it? Like  charges, repelling each other inversely as the square of the distance?  That's about the way it seems to be.\"    \"Could be, and I'm glad.\" The man's face cleared. \"And I'm a charge of  the opposite sign. Let's go!\"           *       *       *       *       *    And in Virgil Samms' deeply-buried office, Civilization's two strongest  men were deep in conversation.    \"... troubles enough to keep four men of our size awake nights.\"  Samms' voice was light, but his eyes were moody and somber. \"You can  probably whip yours, though, in time. They're mostly in one solar  system; a short flit covers the rest. Languages and customs are known.  But how--_how_--can legal processes work efficiently--work at all,  for that matter--when a man can commit a murder or a pirate can loot  a space-ship and be a hundred parsecs away before the crime is even  discovered? How can a Tellurian John Law find a criminal on a strange  world that knows nothing whatever of our Patrol, with a completely  alien language--maybe no language at all--where it takes months even  to find out who and where--if any--the native police officers are? But  there must be a way, Rod--there's _got_ to be a way!\" Samms slammed his  open hand resoundingly against his desk's bare top. \"And by God I'll  find it--the Patrol _will_ come out on top!\"    \"'Crusader' Samms, now and forever!\" There was no trace of mockery in  Kinnison's voice or expression, but only friendship and admiration.  \"And I'll bet you do. Your Interstellar Patrol, or whatever....\"    \"Galactic Patrol. I know what the name of it is going to be, if nothing  else.\"    \"... is just as good as in the bag, right now. You've done a job so  far, Virge. This whole system, Nevia, the colonies on Aldebaran II and  other planets, even Valeria, as tight as a drum. Funny about Valeria,  isn't it....\"    There was a moment of silence, then Kinnison went on:    \"But wherever diamonds are, there go Dutchmen. And Dutch women  go wherever their men do. And, in spite of medical advice, Dutch  babies arrive. Although a lot of the adults died--three G's is no  joke--practically all of the babies keep on living. Developing  bones and muscles to fit--walking at a year and a half old--living  normally--they say that the third generation will be perfectly at home  there.\"    \"Which shows that the human animal is more adaptable than some ranking  medicos had believed, is all. Don't try to side-track me, Rod. You  know as well as I do what we're up against; the new headaches that  inter-stellar commerce is bringing with it. New vices--drugs--thionite,  for instance; we haven't been able to get an inkling of an idea as to  where that stuff is coming from. And I don't have to tell you what  piracy has done to insurance rates.\"    \"I'll say not--look at the price of Aldebaranian cigars, the only kind  fit to smoke! You've given up, then, on the idea that Arisia is the  pirates' GHQ?\"    \"Definitely. It isn't. The pirates are even more afraid of it than  tramp spacemen are. It's out of bounds--absolutely forbidden territory,  apparently--to everybody, my best operatives included. All we know  about it is the name--Arisia--that our planetographers gave it. It is  the first completely incomprehensible thing I have ever experienced. I  am going out there myself as soon as I can take the time--not that I  expect to crack a thing that my best men couldn't touch, but there have  been so many different and conflicting reports--no two stories agree on  anything except in that no one could get anywhere near the planet--that  I feel the need of some first-hand information. Want to come along?\"    \"Try to keep me from it!\"    \"But at that, we shouldn't be too surprised,\" Samms went on,  thoughtfully. \"Just beginning to scratch the surface as we are,  we should expect to encounter peculiar, baffling--even completely  inexplicable things. Facts, situations, events, and beings for which  our one-system experience could not possibly have prepared us. In fact,  we already have. If, ten years ago, anyone had told you that such a  race as the Rigellians existed, what would you have thought? One ship  went there, you know--once. One hour in any Rigellian city--one minute  in a Rigellian automobile--drives a Tellurian insane.\"    \"I see your point.\" Kinnison nodded. \"Probably I would have ordered  a mental examination. And the Palainians are even worse. People--if  you can call them that--who live on Pluto and _like_ it! Entities so  alien that nobody, as far as I know, understands them. But you don't  have to go even that far from home to locate a job of unscrewing the  inscrutable. Who, what, and why--and for how long--was Gray Roger? And,  not far behind him, is this young Bergenholm of yours. And by the way,  you never did give me the lowdown on how come it was the 'Bergenholm',  and not the 'Rodebush-Cleveland', that made trans-galactic commerce  possible and caused nine-tenths of our headaches. As I get the story,  Bergenholm wasn't--isn't--even an engineer.\"    \"Didn't I? Thought I did. He wasn't, and isn't. Well, the original  Rodebush-Cleveland free drive was a killer,"]]]
