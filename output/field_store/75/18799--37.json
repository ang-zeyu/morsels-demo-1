Such is the temporal order as we know it. Above  this is the intelligible world, the eternal order, \"the one-many,\"  das ewige Nu, the world in which God's will is done perfectly and  all reflects the divine mind. Highest of all is \"the One,\" the,  Absolute, the Godhead, of whom nothing can be predicated, because He  is above all distinctions. This Neoplatonic Absolute is the Godhead  of whom Eckhart says: \"God never looked upon deed,\" and of whom  Angelus Silesius sings:      \"Und sieh, er ist nicht Wille,    Er ist ein' ewige Stille.\"    Plotinus taught that the One, being superessential, can only be  apprehended in ecstasy, when thought, which still distinguishes  itself from its object, is transcended, and knower and known become  one. As Tennyson's Ancient Sage says:      \"If thou would'st hear the Nameless, and descend    Into the Temple-cave of thine own self,    There, brooding by the central altar, thou    May'st haply learn the Nameless hath a voice,    By which thou wilt abide, if thou be wise;    For knowledge is the swallow on the lake,    That sees and stirs the surface-shadow there    But never yet hath dipt into the Abysm.\"    In the same way Eckhart taught that no creature can apprehend the  Godhead, and, therefore, that the spark in the centre of the soul  (this doctrine, too, is found in Plotinus) must be verily divine.  The logic of the theory is inexorable. If only like can know like,  we cannot know God except by a faculty which is itself divine. The  real question is whether God, as an object of knowledge and worship  for finite beings, is the absolute Godhead, who transcends all  distinctions. The mediaeval mystics held that this \"flight of the  alone to the alone,\" as Plotinus calls it, is possible to men, and  that in it consists our highest blessedness. They were attracted  towards this view by several influences. First, there was the  tradition of Dionysius, to whom (e.g.) the author of the \"Theologia  Germanica\" appeals as an authority for the possibility of \"beholding  the hidden things of God by utter abandonment of thyself, and of  entering into union with Him who is above all existence, and all  knowledge.\" Secondly, there was what a modern writer has called \"the  attraction of the Abyss,\" the longing which some persons feel very  strongly to merge their individuality in a larger and better whole,  to get rid not only of selfishness but of self for ever. \"Leave  nothing of myself in me,\" is Crashaw's prayer in his wonderful poem  on St Teresa. Thirdly, we may mention the awe and respect long paid  to ecstatic trances, the pathological nature of which was not  understood. The blank trance was a real experience; and as it could  be induced by a long course of ascetical exercises and fervid  devotions, it was naturally regarded as the crowning reward of  sanctity on earth. Nor would it be at all safe to reject the  evidence, which is very copious,[19] that the \"dreamy state\" may  issue in permanent spiritual gain. The methodical cultivation of it,  which is at the bottom of most of the strange austerities of the  ascetics, was not only (though it was partly) practised in the hope  of enjoying those spiritual raptures which are described as being  far more intense than any pleasures of sense[20]: it was the hope of  stirring to its depths the subconscious mind and permeating the  whole with the hidden energy of the divine Spirit that led to the  desire for visions and trances. Lastly, I think we must give a place  to the intellectual attraction of an uncompromising monistic theory  of the universe. Spiritualistic monism, when it is consistent with  itself, will always lean to semi-pantheistic mysticism rather than  to such a compromise with pluralism as Lotze and his numerous  followers in this country imagine to be possible.    But it is possible to go a long way with the mystics and yet to  maintain that under no conditions whatever can a finite being escape  from the limitations of his finitude and see God or the world or  himself \"with the same eye with which God sees\" all things. The old  Hebrew belief, that to see the face of God is death, expresses the  truth under a mythical form. That the human mind, while still \"in  the body pent,\" may obtain glimpses of the eternal order, and enjoy  foretastes of the bliss of heaven, is a belief which I, at least,  see no reason to reject. It involves no rash presumption, and is not  contrary to what may be readily believed about the state of immortal  spirits passing through a mortal life. But the explanation of the  blank trance as a temporary transit into the Absolute must be set  down as a pure delusion. It involves a conception of the divine  \"Rest\" which in his best moments Eckhart himself repudiates. \"The  Rest of the Godhead,\" he says, \"is not in that He is the source of  being, but in that He is the consummation of all being.\" This  profound saying expresses the truth, which he seems often to forget,  that the world-process must have a real value in God's sight--that  it is not a mere polarisation of the white radiance of eternity  broken up by the imperfection of our vision. Whatever theories we  may hold about Absolute Being, or an Absolute that is above Being,  we must make room for the Will, and for Time, which is the \"form\" of  the will, and for the creatures who inhabit time and space, as  having for us the value of reality. Nor shall we, if we are to  escape scepticism, be willing to admit that these appearances have  no sure relation to ultimate reality. We must not try to uncreate  the world in order to find God. We were created out of nothing, but  we cannot return to nothing, to find our Creator there. The still,  small voice is best listened for amid the discordant harmony of life  and death.    The search for God is no exception to the mysterious law of human  nature, that we cannot get anything worth having--neither holiness  nor happiness nor wisdom--by trying for it directly. It must be  given us through something else. The recluse who lives like  Parnell's \"Hermit\":    \"Prayer all his business, all his pleasure praise,\"    is not only a poor sort of saint, but he will offer a poor sort of  prayers and praises. He will miss real holiness for the same reason  that makes the pleasure-seeker miss real happiness. We must lose  ourselves in some worthy interest in order to find again both a  better self and an object higher than that which we sought. This the  German mystics in a sense knew well. There is a noble sentence of  Suso to the effect that \"he who realises the inward in the outward,  to him the inward becomes more inward than to him who only  recognises the inward in the inward.\" Moreover, the recognition that  \"God manifests Himself and worketh more in one creature than  another\" (\"Theologia Germanica\"), involves a denial of the  nihilistic view that all the creatures are \"ein lauteres  Nichts.\"[21] It would be easy to find such passages in all the  fourteenth-century mystics, but it cannot be denied that on the  whole their religion is too self-centred. There are not many maxims  so fundamentally wrong-headed and un-Christian as Suso's advice to  \"live as if you were the only person in the world.\"[22] The life of  the cloistered saint may be abundantly justified--for the spiritual  activity of some of them has been of far greater service to mankind  than the fussy benevolence of many \"practical\" busybodies--but the  idea of social service, whether in the school of Martha or of Mary,  ought surely never to be absent. The image of Christ as the Lover of  the individual soul rather than as the Bridegroom of the Church was  too dear to these lonely men and women. Unconsciously, they looked  to their personal devotions to compensate them for the human loves  which they had forsworn. The raptures of Divine Love, which they  regarded as signal favours bestowed upon them, were not very  wholesome in themselves, and diverted their thoughts from the needs  of their fellow-men. They also led to most painful reactions, in  which the poor contemplative believed himself abandoned by God and  became a pray to terrible depression and melancholy. These fits of  wretchedness came indeed to be recognised as God's punishment for  selfishness in devotion and for too great desire for the sweetness  of communing with God, and so arose the doctrine of \"disinterested  love,\" which was more and more emphasised in the later mysticism,  especially by the French Quietists.    I have spoken quite candidly of the defects of Eckhart's mystical  Christianity. As a religious philosophy it does not keep clear of  the fallacy that an ascent though the unreal can lead to reality.  \"To suppose, as the mystic does, that the finite search has of  itself no Being at all, is illusory, is Maya, is itself nothing,  this is also to deprive the Absolute of even its poor value as a  contrasting goal. For a goal that is a goal of no real process has  as little value as it has content.\"[23] But, as Prof. Royce says,  mysticism furnishes us with the means of correcting itself. It  supplies an obvious reductio ad absurdum of the theory with which it  set out, that \"Immediacy is the one test of reality,\" and is itself  forced to give the world of diversity a real value as manifesting in  different degrees the nature of God. Those who are acquainted with  the sacred books of the East will recognise that here is the  decisive departure from real Pantheism. And it may be fairly claimed  for the German mystics that though their speculative teaching  sometimes seems to echo too ominously the apathetic detachment of  the Indian sage, their lives and example, and their practical  exhortations, preached a truer and a larger philosophy. Eckhart, as  we have seen, was a busy preacher as well as a keen student, and  some of the younger members of his school were even more occupied in  pastoral work.

About once a month I shod that horse, little thinking that he was to  carry me over my three years' imprisonment in just half that time. Yet  so it was. For talking now almost daily, in the hospital or in the  yard, with the Warden, he became interested in me, and in answer to his  inquiries I told him the whole story of my persecution, as I considered  it, my trial and my unjust and severe sentence. When he had heard all he  said:    \"You ought not to be here another day; you ought to go out.\"    The good chaplain also interested himself in my case, and after hearing  the story, he and the Warden took a lawyer named Bemis, into their  counsel, laid the whole matter before him and asked his opinion. Mr.  Bemis, after hearing all the circumstances, expressed the belief that I  might get a pardon. He entered into the matter with his whole heart. He  sent for my son Henry and my first wife, and they came and corroborated  my statement about the mutual agreement for separation, and told how  long we had been parted. Mr. Bemis and they then went to Governor  Briggs, and told him the story, and that I had served out half of  my severe sentence, and pressed for a pardon. The Governor after due  deliberation consented to their request. They came back to Charlestown  with the joyful intelligence. Warden Robinson advised my son, that  considering my present mental and physical condition, he had better  break the intelligence gradually to me, and so Henry came to me and  said, simply, that he thought he would soon have \"good news\" for me. The  next day I was told that my pardon was certain. The day following, at 12  o'clock, I walked out, after eighteen months' imprisonment, a free man.  I was in the streets of Charlestown with my own clothes on and five  dollars, given to me by the Warden, in my pocket, I was poor, truly, but  I was at liberty, and that for the day was enough.

I went at once to the Prisoners Home, where I was kindly received, and  I stayed there two days. The superintendent then paid my passage to  Pittsfield where I wished to go and meet my son. From Pittsfield I went  to Albany, then New York, and from there to Newtown N. J. Here I went  into practice, meeting with almost immediate success, and staid there  two months. It was my habit to go from town to town to attend to cases  of a certain class and to sell my vegetable preparations; and from  Newtown I went to Belvidere, stopping at intermediate towns on the way,  and from Belvidere I went to Harmony, a short distance below, to attend  a case of white swelling, which I cured.    Now just across the Delaware river, nine miles above Easton, Penn.,  lived a wealthy Dutch farmer, named Scheimer, who heard of the cure  I had effected in Harmony, and as he had a son, sixteen years of age,  afflicted in the same way, he sent for me to come and see him. I crossed  the river, saw the boy, and at Scheimer's request took up my residence  with him to attend to the case. He was to give me, with my board, five  hundred dollars if I cured the boy; but though the boy recovered under  my treatment, I never received my fee for reasons which will appear  anon. I secured some other practice in the neighborhood, and frequently  visited Easton, Belvidere, Harmony, Oxford, and other near by places, on  either side of the river.    The Scheimer family consisted of the \"old folks\" and four sons and four  daughters, the children grown up, for my patient, sixteen years old, was  the youngest. The youngest daughter, Sarah, eighteen years old, was an  accomplished and beautiful girl. Now it would seem as if with my  sad experience I ought by this time, to have turned my back on women  forever. But I think I was a monomaniac on the subject of matrimony.  My first wife had so misused me that it was always in my mind that  some reparation was due me, and that I was fairly entitled to a good  helpmate. The ill-success of my efforts, hitherto, to secure one,  and my consequent sufferings were all lost upon me--experience, bitter  experience, had taught me nothing.    I had not been in the Scheimer family three months before I fell in love  with the daughter Sarah and she returned my passion. She promised to  marry me, but said there was no use in saying anything to her parents  about it; they would never consent on account of the disparity in  our ages, for I was then forty years old; but she would marry me  nevertheless, if we had to run away together. Meanwhile, the old  folks had seen enough of our intimacy to suspect that it might lead to  something yet closer, and one day Mr. Scheimer invited me to leave his  house and not to return. I asked for one last interview with Sarah,  which was accorded, and we then arranged a plan by which she should meet  me the next afternoon at four o'clock at the Jersey ferry, a mile below  the house, when we proposed to quietly cross over to Belvidere and get  married. I then took leave of her and the family and went away.    The next day, at the appointed time, I was at the ferry--Sarah, as I  learned afterwards, left the house at a much earlier hour to \"take a  walk\" and while she was, foolishly I think, making a circuitous route  to reach the ferry, her father, who suspected that she intended to run  away, went to the ferryman and told him his suspicions, directing him  if Sarah came there by no means to permit her to cross the river.  Consequently when Sarah met me at the ferry, the ferryman flatly refused  to let either of us go over. He knew all about it, he said, and it was  \"no go.\" I had two hundred dollars in my pocket and I offered him any  reasonable sum, if he would only let us cross; but no, he knew the  Scheimers better than he knew me, and their goodwill was worth more  than mine. Here was a block to the game, indeed. I had sent my baggage  forward in the morning to Belvidere; Sarah had nothing but the clothes  she wore, for she was so carefully watched that she could carry or send  nothing away; but she was ready to go if the obstinate ferryman had not  prevented us.    While we were pressing the ferryman to favor us, down came one of  Sarah's brothers with a dozen neighbors, and told her she must return  home or he would carry her back by force. I interfered and said she  should not go. Whereupon one fellow took hold of me and I promptly  knocked him down, and notified the crowd that the first who laid hands  on me, or who attempted to take her home violently, would get a dose  from my pistol which I then exhibited:    \"Sarah must go willingly or not at all,\" said I.    The production of my pistol, the only weapon in the crowd, brought about  a new state of affairs, and the brother and others tried persuasion; but  Sarah stoutly insisted that she would not return. \"Now hold on,\" boys,  said I, \"I am going to say something to her.\" I then took her aside and  told her that there was no use in trying to run away then; that she had  better go home quietly, and tell the folks that she was sorry for what  she had done, that she had broken off with me, and would have nothing  more to do with me; that I would surely see her to-morrow, and then we  could make a new plan. So she announced her willingness to go quietly  home with her brother and she did so. I went to a public house half a  mile below the ferry. That night the gang came down to this house with  the intention of driving me away from the place, or, possibly, of doing  something worse; but while they were howling outside, the landlord sent  me to my room and then went out and told the crowd I had gone away.    The next morning I boldly walked up to Scheimer's house to get a few  books and other things I had left there, and I saw Sarah. I told her  to be ready on the following Thursday night and I would have a ladder  against her window for her to escape by. She promised to be ready.  Meantime, though I had been in the house but a few minutes, some one who  had seen me go in gathered the crowd of the day before, and the first  thing I knew the house was beseiged. Mrs. Scheimer had gone up stairs  for my things. I went out and faced the little mob. I was told to leave  the place or they would kill me. One of Sarah's brothers ran into the  house, brought out a musket and aimed it at me; but it missed fire. I  drew my pistol the crowd keeping well away then, and told him that if he  did not instantly bring that musket to me I would shoot him. He brought  it, and I threw it over the fence, Sarah crying out from the window,  \"good! good!\" The mob then turned and abused and blackguarded her. Then  the old lady came out, bringing a carpet bag containing my books and  things, asking me to see if \"it was all right.\" I had no disposition  to stop and examine just then; I told the mob I had no other business  there; that I was going away, and to my surprise, I confess, I was  permitted to leave the place unmolested.    It is quite certain the ferryman made no objection to my crossing, and  I went to Belvidere where I remained quietly till the appointed Thursday  night, when I started with a trusty man for Scheimer's. We timed our  journey so as to arrive there at one o'clock in the morning. Ever since  her attempt to elope, Sarah had been watched night and day, and to  prevent her abduction by me, Mr. Scheimer had two or three men in the  house to stand guard at night. Sarah was locked in her room, which is  precisely what we had provided for, for no one in the house supposed  that she could escape by the window. There was a big dog on"]]]
