Men-at-arms, with torches and spears, often had to march out from their  barracks to assail the snarling, yelping packs of savage animals that  hunger drove from the surrounding forests.    Paris of the twelfth century was typical of France itself, which was  harried by human wolves intent on rapine and wanton plunder. There were  great schools of theology, but the students who attended them fought  and slashed one another. If a man's life was threatened he must protect  it by his own strength or by gathering about him a band of friends. No  one was safe. No one was tolerant. Very few were free from the grosser  vices. Even in some of the religious houses the brothers would meet at  night for unseemly revels, splashing the stone floors with wine and  shrieking in a delirium of drunkenness. The rules of the Church  enjoined temperance, continence, and celibacy; but the decrees of Leo  IX. and Nicholas II. and Alexander II. and Gregory were only partially  observed.    In fact, Europe was in a state of chaos--political and moral and  social. Only very slowly was order emerging from sheer anarchy. We must  remember this when we recall some facts which meet us in the story of  Abelard and Heloise.    The jealousy of Champeaux drove Abelard for a time from Paris. He  taught and lectured at several other centers of learning, always  admired, and yet at the same time denounced by many for his advocacy of  reason as against blind faith. During the years of his wandering he  came to have a wide knowledge of the world and of human nature. If we  try to imagine him as he was in his thirty-fifth year we shall find in  him a remarkable combination of attractive qualities.    It must be remembered that though, in a sense, he was an ecclesiastic,  he had not yet been ordained to the priesthood, but was rather a  canon--a person who did not belong to any religious order, though he  was supposed to live according to a definite set of religious rules and  as a member of a religious community. Abelard, however, made rather  light of his churchly associations. He was at once an accomplished man  of the world and a profound scholar. There was nothing of the recluse  about him. He mingled with his fellow men, whom he dominated by the  charm of his personality. He was eloquent, ardent, and persuasive. He  could turn a delicate compliment as skilfully as he could elaborate a  syllogism. His rich voice had in it a seductive quality which was never  without its effect.    Handsome and well formed, he possessed as much vigor of body as of  mind. Nor were his accomplishments entirely those of the scholar. He  wrote dainty verses, which he also set to music, and which he sang  himself with a rare skill. Some have called him \"the first of the  troubadours,\" and many who cared nothing for his skill in logic admired  him for his gifts as a musician and a poet. Altogether, he was one to  attract attention wherever he went, for none could fail to recognize  his power.    It was soon after his thirty-fifth year that he returned to Paris,  where he was welcomed by thousands. With much tact he reconciled  himself to his enemies, so that his life now seemed to be full of  promise and of sunshine.    It was at this time that he became acquainted with a very beautiful  young girl named Heloise. She was only eighteen years of age, yet  already she possessed not only beauty, but many accomplishments which  were then quite rare in women, since she both wrote and spoke a number  of languages, and, like Abelard, was a lover of music and poetry.  Heloise was the illegitimate daughter of a canon of patrician blood; so  that she is said to have been a worthy representative of the noble  house of the Montmorencys--famous throughout French history for  chivalry and charm.    Up to this time we do not know precisely what sort of life Abelard had  lived in private. His enemies declared that he had squandered his  substance in vicious ways. His friends denied this, and represented him  as strict and chaste. The truth probably lies between these two  assertions. He was naturally a pleasure-loving man of the world, who  may very possibly have relieved his severer studies by occasional  revelry and light love. It is not at all likely that he was addicted to  gross passions and low practices.    But such as he was, when he first saw Heloise he conceived for her a  violent attachment. Carefully guarded in the house of her uncle,  Fulbert, it was difficult at first for Abelard to meet her save in the  most casual way; yet every time that he heard her exquisite voice and  watched her graceful manners he became more and more infatuated. His  studies suddenly seemed tame and colorless beside the fierce scarlet  flame which blazed up in his heart.    Nevertheless, it was because of these studies and of his great  reputation as a scholar that he managed to obtain access to Heloise. He  flattered her uncle and made a chance proposal that he should himself  become an inmate of Fulbert's household in order that he might teach  this girl of so much promise. Such an offer coming from so brilliant a  man was joyfully accepted.    From that time Abelard could visit Heloise without restraint. He was  her teacher, and the two spent hours together, nominally in the study  of Greek and Hebrew; but doubtless very little was said between them  upon such unattractive subjects. On the contrary, with all his wide  experience of life, his eloquence, his perfect manners, and his  fascination, Abelard put forth his power to captivate the senses of a  girl still in her teens and quite ignorant of the world. As Remusat  says, he employed to win her the genius which had overwhelmed all the  great centers of learning in the Western world.    It was then that the pleasures of knowledge, the joys of thought, the  emotions of eloquence, were all called into play to charm and move and  plunge into a profound and strange intoxication this noble and tender  heart which had never known either love or sorrow. ... One can imagine  that everything helped on the inevitable end. Their studies gave them  opportunities to see each other freely, and also permitted them to be  alone together. Then their books lay open between them; but either long  periods of silence stilled their reading, or else words of deepening  intimacy made them forget their studies altogether. The eyes of the two  lovers turned from the book to mingle their glances, and then to turn  away in a confusion that was conscious.    Hand would touch hand, apparently by accident; and when conversation  ceased, Abelard would often hear the long, quivering sigh which showed  the strange, half-frightened, and yet exquisite joy which Heloise  experienced.    It was not long before the girl's heart had been wholly won.  Transported by her emotion, she met the caresses of her lover with  those as unrestrained as his. Her very innocence deprived her of the  protection which older women would have had. All was given freely, and  even wildly, by Heloise; and all was taken by Abelard, who afterward  himself declared:    \"The pleasure of teaching her to love surpassed the delightful  fragrance of all the perfumes in the world.\"    Yet these two could not always live in a paradise which was entirely  their own. The world of Paris took notice of their close association.  Some poems written to Heloise by Abelard, as if in letters of fire,  were found and shown to Fulbert, who, until this time, had suspected  nothing. Angrily he ordered Abelard to leave his house. He forbade his  niece to see her lover any more.    But the two could not be separated; and, indeed, there was good reason  why they should still cling together. Secretly Heloise left her uncle's  house and fled through the narrow lanes of Paris to the dwelling of  Abelard's sister, Denyse, where Abelard himself was living. There,  presently, the young girl gave birth to a son, who was named Astrolabe,  after an instrument used by astronomers, since both the father and the  mother felt that the offspring of so great a love should have no  ordinary name.    Fulbert was furious, and rightly so. His hospitality had been outraged  and his niece dishonored. He insisted that the pair should at once be  married. Here was revealed a certain weakness in the character of  Abelard. He consented to the marriage, but insisted that it should be  kept an utter secret.    Oddly enough, it was Heloise herself who objected to becoming the wife  of the man she loved. Unselfishness could go no farther. She saw that,  were he to marry her, his advancement in the Church would be almost  impossible; for, while the very minor clergy sometimes married in spite  of the papal bulls, matrimony was becoming a fatal bar to  ecclesiastical promotion. And so Heloise pleaded pitifully, both with  her uncle and with Abelard, that there should be no marriage. She would  rather bear all manner of disgrace than stand in the way of Abelard's  advancement.    He has himself given some of the words in which she pleaded with him:    What glory shall I win from you, when I have made you quite inglorious  and have humbled both of us? What vengeance will the world inflict on  me if I deprive it of one so brilliant? What curses will follow such a  marriage? How outrageous would it be that you, whom nature created for  the universal good, should be devoted to one woman and plunged into  such disgrace? I loathe the thought of a marriage which would humiliate  you.    Indeed, every possible effort which another woman in her place would  employ to make him marry her she used in order to dissuade him.  Finally, her sweet face streaming with tears, she uttered that  tremendous sentence which makes one really think that she loved him as  no other woman ever loved a man. She cried out, in an agony of  self-sacrifice:    \"I would rather be your mistress than the wife even of an emperor!\"    Nevertheless,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4693"],[0,"Famous Affinities of History: The Romance of Devotion.

More fairly  should we wonder at the great measure of success which had already  been achieved. The leaven of a true Christianity was working in the  half-pagan populations. It had not yet completely reached the nobles and  the knights, or even all the ecclesiastics who served it and who were  consecrated to its mission. Thus, amid a sort of political chaos  were seen the glaring evils of feudalism. Kings and princes and their  followers lived the lives of swine. Private blood-feuds were regarded  lightly. There was as yet no single central power. Every man carried his  life in his hand, trusting to sword and dagger for protection.    The cities were still mere hamlets clustered around great castles or  fortified cathedrals. In Paris itself the network of dark lanes,  ill lighted and unguarded, was the scene of midnight murder and  assassination. In the winter-time wolves infested the town by night.  Men-at-arms, with torches and spears, often had to march out from their  barracks to assail the snarling, yelping packs of savage animals that  hunger drove from the surrounding forests.
