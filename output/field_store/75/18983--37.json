We stared hard at it, gathered  up the reins, examined the leash, scarcely believing the good luck of  having come on a hare at last. Then riding up closer and closer, with  our eyes on the white thing, it would turn out to be not a hare at all,  but a horse's skull. How annoying!    We would look at papa and Seryozha, thinking, \"I wonder if they saw that  I took that skull for a hare.\" But papa would be sitting keen and alert  on his English saddle, with the wooden stirrups, smoking a cigarette,  while Seryozha would perhaps have got his leash entangled and could not  get it straight.    \"Thank heaven!\" we would exclaim, \"nobody saw me! What a fool I should  have felt!\" So we would ride on.    The horse's even pace would begin to rock us to sleep, feeling rather  bored at nothing getting up; when all of a sudden, just at the moment we  least expected it, right in front of us, twenty paces away, would jump  up a gray hare as if from the bowels of the earth.    The dogs had seen it before we had, and had started forward already  in full pursuit. We began to bawl, \"Tally-ho! tally-ho!\" like madmen,  flogging our horses with all our might, and flying after them.    The dogs would come up with the hare, turn it, then turn it again, the  young and fiery Sultan and Darling running over it, catching up again,  and running over again; and at last the old and experienced Winger,  who had been galloping on one side all the time, would seize her  opportunity, and spring in. The hare would give a helpless cry like a  baby, and the dogs, burying their fangs in it, in a star-shaped group,  would begin to tug in different directions.    \"Let go! Let go!\"    We would come galloping up, finish off the hare, and give the dogs  the tracks, [9] tearing them off toe by toe, and throwing them to our  favorites, who would catch them in the air. Then papa would teach us how  to strap the hare on the back of the saddle.    After the run we would all be in better spirits, and get to better  places near Yasenki and Retinka. Gray hares would get up oftener. Each  of us would have his spoils in the saddle-straps now, and we would begin  to hope for a fox.    Not many foxes would turn up. If they did, it was generally Tumashka,  who was old and staid, who distinguished himself. He was sick of hares,  and made no great effort to run after them; but with a fox he would  gallop at full speed, and it was almost always he who killed.    It would be late, often dark, when we got back home.          \"ANNA KARENINA\"    I REMEMBER my father writing his alphabet and reading-book in 1871 and  1872, but I cannot at all remember his beginning \"Anna Karenina.\" I  probably knew nothing about it at the time. What did it matter to a boy  of seven what his father was writing? It was only later, when one kept  hearing the name again and again, and bundles of proofs kept arriving,  and were sent off almost every day, that I understood that \"Anna  Karenina\" was the name of the novel on which my father and mother were  both at work.    My mother's work seemed much harder than my father's, because we  actually saw her at it, and she worked much longer hours than he  did. She used to sit in the sitting-room off the zala, at her little  writing-table, and spend all her free time writing.    Leaning over the manuscript and trying to decipher my father's scrawl  with her short-sighted eyes, she used to spend whole evenings over it,  and often sat up late at night after everybody else had gone to bed.  Sometimes, when anything was written quite illegibly, she would go to  my father's study and ask him what it meant. But this was very rare,  because my mother did not like to disturb him.    When it happened, my father used to take the manuscript in his hand, and  ask with some annoyance, \"What on earth is the difficulty?\" and would  begin to read it out aloud. When he came to the difficult place he would  mumble and hesitate, and sometimes had the greatest difficulty in making  out, or, rather, in guessing, what he had written. He had a very bad  handwriting, and a terrible habit of writing in whole sentences between  the lines, or in the corners of the page, or sometimes right across it.    My mother often discovered gross grammatical errors, and pointed them  out to my father, and corrected them.    When \"Anna Karenina\" began to come out in the \"Russky Vyestnik,\" [10]  long galley-proofs were posted to my father, and he looked them through  and corrected them.    At first the margins would be marked with the ordinary typographical  signs, letters omitted, marks of punctuation, etc.; then individual  words would be changed, and then whole sentences, till in the end the  proof-sheet would be reduced to a mass of patches quite black in places,  and it was quite impossible to send it back as it stood, because no  one but my mother could make head or tail of the tangle of conventional  signs, transpositions, and erasures.    My mother would sit up all night copying the whole thing out afresh.    In the morning there would lie the pages on her table, neatly piled  together, covered all over with her fine, clear handwriting, and  everything ready so that when \"Lyovotchka\" got up he could send the  proof-sheets off by post.      My father carried them off to his study to have \"just one last look,\"  and by the evening it would be just as bad again, the whole thing having  been rewritten and messed up.    \"Sonya my dear, I am very sorry, but I've spoiled all your work again; I  promise I won't do it any more,\" he would say, showing her the passages  he had inked over with a guilty air. \"We'll send them off to-morrow  without fail.\" But this to-morrow was often put off day by day for weeks  or months together.    \"There's just one bit I want to look through again,\" my father would  say; but he would get carried away and recast the whole thing afresh.    There were even occasions when, after posting the proofs, he would  remember some particular words next day, and correct them by telegraph.  Several times, in consequence of these rewritings, the printing of the  novel in the \"Russky Vyestnik\" was interrupted, and sometimes it did not  come out for months together.    In the last part of \"Anna Karenina\" my father, in describing the end of  VRONSKY'S career, showed his disapproval of the volunteer movement and  the Panslavonic committees, and this led to a quarrel with Katkof.    I can remember how angry my father was when Katkof refused to print  those chapters as they stood, and asked him either to leave out part of  them or to soften them down, and finally returned the manuscript, and  printed a short note in his paper to say that after the death of the  heroine the novel was strictly speaking at an end; but that the author  had added an epilogue of two printed sheets, in which he related such  and such facts, and he would very likely \"develop these chapters for the  separate edition of his novel.\"    In concluding, I wish to say a few words about my father's own opinion  of \"Anna Karenina.\"    In 1875 he wrote to N. N. Strakhof:    \"I must confess that I was delighted by the success of the last piece  of 'Anna Karenina.' I had by no means expected it, and to tell you the  truth, I am surprised that people are so pleased with such ordinary and  EMPTY stuff.\"    The same year he wrote to Fet:    \"It is two months since I have defiled my hands with ink or my heart  with thoughts. But now I am setting to work again on my TEDIOUS, VULGAR  'ANNA KARENINA,' with only one wish, to clear it out of the way as  soon as possible and give myself leisure for other occupations, but not  schoolmastering, which I am fond of, but wish to give up; it takes up  too much time.\"    In 1878, when the novel was nearing its end, he wrote again to Strakhof:    \"I am frightened by the feeling that I am getting into my summer mood  again. I LOATHE what I have written. The proof-sheets for the April  number [of \"Anna Karenina\" in the \"Russky Vyestnik\"] now lie on my  table, and I am afraid that I have not the heart to correct them.  EVERYTHING in them is BEASTLY, and the whole thing ought to be  rewritten,--all that has been printed, too,--scrapped and melted down,  thrown away, renounced. I ought to say, 'I am sorry; I will not do  it any more,' and try to write something fresh instead of all this  incoherent, neither-fish-nor-flesh-nor-fowlish stuff.\"    That was how my father felt toward his novel while he was writing it.  Afterward I often heard him say much harsher things about it.    \"What difficulty is there in writing about how an officer fell in love  with a married woman?\" he used to say. \"There's no difficulty in it, and  above all no good in it.\"    I am quite convinced that if my father could have done so, he long ago  would have destroyed this novel, which he never liked and always wanted  to disown.                         (To be continued)          REMINISCENCES OF TOLSTOY (Part II.)    BY HIS SON, COUNT ILYA TOLSTOY    TRANSLATED BY GEORGE CALDERON    IN the summer, when both families were together at Yasnaya, our own  and the Kuzminsky's, when both the house and the annex were full of the  family and their guests, we used our letter-box.    It originated long before, when I was still small and had only just  learned to write, and it continued with intervals till the middle of the  eighties.    It hung on the landing at the top of the stairs beside the grandfather's  clock; and every one dropped his compositions into it, the verses,  articles, or stories that he had written on topical subjects in the  course of the week.    On Sundays we would all collect at the round table in the zala, the  box would be solemnly opened, and one of the grown-ups, often my father  himself, would read the contents aloud.    All the papers were unsigned, and it was a point of honor not to peep at  the handwriting; but, despite this, we almost always guessed the author,  either "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8159"],[0,"Wanderings in South America (#4)"],[1,", and  never rose more. He barked once, though not as if in pain. His voice  was low and weak; and in a second attempt it quite failed him. He now  put his head betwixt his fore-legs, and raising it slowly again he fell  over on his side. His eye immediately became fixed, and though his  extremities every now and then shot convulsively, he never showed the  least desire to raise up his head. His heart fluttered much from the  time he laid down, and at intervals beat very strong; then stopped for  a moment or two, and then beat again; and continued faintly beating  several minutes after every other part of his body seemed dead.    In a quarter of an hour after he had received the poison he was quite  motionless.    A few miles before you reach the great fall, and which indeed is the  only one which can be called a fall, large balls of froth come floating  past you. The river appears beautifully marked with streaks of foam,  and on your nearer approach the stream is whitened all over.    At first you behold the fall rushing down a bed of rocks with a  tremendous noise, divided into two foamy streams which, at their  junction again, form a small island covered with wood. Above this  island, for a short space, there appears but one stream, all white with  froth, and fretting and boiling amongst the huge rocks which obstruct  its course.    Higher up it is seen dividing itself into a short channel or two, and  trees grow on the rocks which cause its separation. The torrent, in  many places, has eaten deep into the rocks, and split them into large  fragments by driving others against them. The trees on the rocks are in  bloom and vigour, though their roots are half bared and many of them  bruised and broken by the rushing waters.    This is the general appearance of the fall from the level of the water  below to where the river is smooth and quiet above. It must be  remembered that this is during the periodical rains. Probably, in the  dry season, it puts on a very different appearance. There is no  perpendicular fall of water of any consequence throughout it, but the  dreadful roaring and rushing of the torrent, down a long rocky and  moderately sloping channel, has a fine effect; and the stranger returns  well pleased with what he has seen. No animal, nor craft of any kind,  could stem this downward flood. In a few moments the first would be  killed, the second dashed in pieces.    The Indians have a path alongside of it, through the forest, where  prodigious crabwood trees grow. Up this path they drag their canoes and  launch them into the river above; and on their return bring them down  the same way.    About two hours below this fall is the habitation of an Acoway chief  called Sinkerman. At night you hear the roaring of the fall from it. It  is pleasantly situated on the top of a sand-hill. At this place you  have the finest view the River Demerara affords: three tiers of hills  rise in slow gradation, one above the other, before you, and present a  grand and magnificent scene, especially to him who has been accustomed  to a level country.    Here, a little after midnight, on the first of May, was heard a most  strange and unaccountable noise: it seemed as though several regiments  were engaged and musketry firing with great rapidity. The Indians,  terrified beyond description, left their hammocks and crowded all  together like sheep at the approach of the wolf. There were no soldiers  within three or four hundred miles. Conjecture was of no avail, and all  conversation next morning on the subject was as useless and  unsatisfactory as the dead silence which succeeded to the noise.    He who wishes to reach the Macoushi country had better send his canoe  over-land from Sinkerman's to the Essequibo.    There is a pretty good path, and meeting a creek about three-quarters  of the way, it eases the labour, and twelve Indians will arrive with it  in the Essequibo in four days.    The traveller need not attend his canoe; there is a shorter and a  better way. Half an hour below Sinkerman's he finds a little creek on  the western bank of the Demerara. After proceeding about a couple of  hundred yards up it, he leaves it, and pursues a west-north-west  direction by land for the Essequibo. The path is good, though somewhat  rugged with the roots of trees, and here and there obstructed by fallen  ones; it extends more over level ground than otherwise. There are a few  steep ascents and descents in it, with a little brook running at the  bottom of them, but they are easily passed over, and the fallen trees  serve for a bridge.    You may reach the Essequibo with ease in a day and a half; and so  matted and interwoven are the tops of the trees above you that the sun  is not felt once all the way, saving where the space which a  newly-fallen tree occupied lets in his rays upon you. The forest  contains an abundance of wild hogs, lobbas, acouries, powisses, maams,  maroudis and waracabas for your nourishment, and there are plenty of  leaves to cover a shed whenever you are inclined to sleep.    The soil has three-fourths of sand in it till you come within half an  hour's walk of the Essequibo, where you find a red gravel and rocks. In  this retired and solitary tract Nature's garb, to all appearance, has  not been injured by fire nor her productions broken in upon by the  exterminating hand of man.    Here the finest green-heart grows, and wallaba, purple-heart,  siloabali, sawari, buletre, tauronira and mora are met with in vast  abundance, far and near, towering up in majestic grandeur, straight as  pillars, sixty or seventy feet high, without a knot or branch.    Traveller, forget for a little while the idea thou hast of wandering  farther on, and stop and look at this grand picture of vegetable  nature: it is a reflection of the crowd thou hast lately been in, and  though a silent monitor, it is not a less eloquent one on that account.  See that noble purple-heart before thee! Nature has been kind to it.  Not a hole, not the least oozing from its trunk, to show that its best  days are past. Vigorous in youthful blooming beauty, it stands the  ornament of these sequestered wilds and tacitly rebukes those base ones  of thine own species who have been hardy enough to deny the existence  of Him who ordered it to flourish here.    Behold that one next to it! Hark how the hammerings of the red-headed  woodpecker resound through its distempered boughs! See what a quantity  of holes he has made in it, and how its bark is stained with the drops  which trickle down from them. The lightning, too, has blasted one side  of it. Nature looks pale and wan in its leaves, and her resources are  nearly dried up in its extremities: its sap is tainted; a mortal  sickness, slow as a consumption and as sure in its consequences, has  long since entered its frame, vitiating and destroying the wholesome  juices there.    Step a few paces aside and cast thine eye on that remnant of a mora  behind it. Best part of its branches, once so high and ornamental, now  lie on the ground in sad confusion, one upon the other, all shattered  and fungus-grown and a prey to millions of insects which are busily  employed in destroying them. One branch of it still looks healthy! Will  it recover? No, it cannot; Nature has already run her course, and that  healthy-looking branch is only as a fallacious good symptom in him who  is just about to die of a mortification when he feels no more pain, and  fancies his distemper has left him; it is as the momentary gleam of a  wintry sun's ray close to the western horizon. See! while we are  speaking a gust of wind has brought the tree to the ground and made  room for its successor.    Come farther on and examine that apparently luxuriant tauronira on thy  right hand. It boasts a verdure not its own; they are false ornaments  it wears. The bush-rope and bird-vines have clothed it from the root to  its topmost branch. The succession of fruit which it hath borne, like  good cheer in the houses of the great, has invited the birds to resort  to it, and they have disseminated beautiful, though destructive, plants  on its branches which, like the distempers vice brings into the human  frame, rob it of all its health and vigour. They have shortened its  days, and probably in another year they will finally kill it, long  before Nature intended that it should die.    Ere thou leavest this interesting scene, look on the ground around  thee, and see what everything here below must come to.    Behold that newly-fallen wallaba! The whirlwind has uprooted it in its  prime, and it has brought down to the ground a dozen small ones in its  fall. Its bark has already begun to drop off! And that heart of mora  close by it is fast yielding, in spite of its firm, tough texture.    The tree which thou passedst but a little ago, and which perhaps has  laid over yonder brook for years, can now hardly support itself, and in  a few months more it will have fallen into the water.    Put thy foot on that large trunk thou seest to the left. It seems  entire amid the surrounding fragments. Mere outward appearance,  delusive phantom of what it once was! Tread on it and, like the  fuss-ball, it will break into dust.    Sad and silent mementos to the giddy traveller as he wanders on!  Prostrate remnants of vegetable nature, how incontestably ye prove what  we must all at last come to, and how plain your mouldering ruins show  that the firmest texture avails us naught when Heaven wills that we  should cease to be!      The cloud-capt towers, the gorgeous palaces,    The solemn temples, the great globe itself,    Yea, all which it inhabit, shall dissolve,    And, like the baseless fabric of a vision,    Leave not a wreck behind.    Cast thine eye around thee and see the thousands of Nature's  productions. Take a view of them from the opening seed on the surface  sending a downward shoot, to the loftiest and the largest trees rising  up and blooming in"]]]
