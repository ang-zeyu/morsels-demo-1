I have great reason to be grateful to the Africans themselves--to  cultured men and women among them like Charles Owoo, Mbo, Sanga  Glass, Jane Harrington and her sister at Gaboon, and to the bush  natives; but of my experience with them I give further details, so I  need not dwell on them here.    I apologise to the general reader for giving so much detail on  matters that really only affect myself, and I know that the  indebtedness which all African travellers have to the white  residents in Africa is a matter usually very lightly touched on.  No  doubt my voyage would seem a grander thing if I omitted mention of  the help I received, but--well, there was a German gentleman once  who evolved a camel out of his inner consciousness.  It was a  wonderful thing; still, you know, it was not a good camel, only a  thing which people personally unacquainted with camels could believe  in.  Now I am ambitious to make a picture, if I make one at all,  that people who do know the original can believe in--even if they  criticise its points--and so I give you details a more showy artist  would omit.        CHAPTER I.  LIVERPOOL TO SIERRA LEONE AND THE GOLD COAST.        Setting forth how the voyager departs from England in a stout vessel  and in good company, and reaches in due course the Island of the  Grand Canary, and then the Port of Sierra Leone:  to which is added  some account of this latter place and the comeliness of its women.  Wherein also some description of Cape Coast and Accra is given, to  which are added divers observations on supplies to be obtained  there.    The West Coast of Africa is like the Arctic regions in one  particular, and that is that when you have once visited it you want  to go back there again; and, now I come to think of it, there is  another particular in which it is like them, and that is that the  chances you have of returning from it at all are small, for it is a  Belle Dame sans merci.    I succumbed to the charm of the Coast as soon as I left Sierra Leone  on my first voyage out, and I saw more than enough during that  voyage to make me recognise that there was any amount of work for me  worth doing down there.  So I warned the Coast I was coming back  again and the Coast did not believe me; and on my return to it a  second time displayed a genuine surprise, and formed an even higher  opinion of my folly than it had formed on our first acquaintance,  which is saying a good deal.    During this voyage in 1893, I had been to Old Calabar, and its  Governor, Sir Claude MacDonald, had heard me expatiating on the  absorbing interest of the Antarctic drift, and the importance of the  collection of fresh-water fishes and so on.  So when Lady MacDonald  heroically decided to go out to him in Calabar, they most kindly  asked me if I would join her, and make my time fit hers for starting  on my second journey.  This I most willingly did.  But I fear that  very sweet and gracious lady suffered a great deal of apprehension  at the prospect of spending a month on board ship with a person so  devoted to science as to go down the West Coast in its pursuit.  During the earlier days of our voyage she would attract my attention  to all sorts of marine objects overboard, so as to amuse me.  I used  to look at them, and think it would be the death of me if I had to  work like this, explaining meanwhile aloud that \"they were very  interesting, but Haeckel had done them, and I was out after fresh-  water fishes from a river north of the Congo this time,\" fearing all  the while that she felt me unenthusiastic for not flying over into  the ocean to secure the specimens.    However, my scientific qualities, whatever they may amount to, did  not blind this lady long to the fact of my being after all a very  ordinary individual, and she told me so--not in these crude words,  indeed, but nicely and kindly--whereupon, in a burst of gratitude to  her for understanding me, I appointed myself her honorary aide-de-  camp on the spot, and her sincere admirer I shall remain for ever,  fully recognising that her courage in going to the Coast was far  greater than my own, for she had more to lose had fever claimed her,  and she was in those days by no means under the spell of Africa.  But this is anticipating.    It was on the 23rd of December, 1894, that we left Liverpool in the  Batanga, commanded by my old friend Captain Murray, under whose care  I had made my first voyage.  On the 30th we sighted the Peak of  Teneriffe early in the afternoon.  It displayed itself, as usual, as  an entirely celestial phenomenon.  A great many people miss seeing  it.  Suffering under the delusion that El Pico is a terrestrial  affair, they look in vain somewhere about the level of their own  eyes, which are striving to penetrate the dense masses of mist that  usually enshroud its slopes by day, and then a friend comes along,  and gaily points out to the newcomer the glittering white triangle  somewhere near the zenith.  On some days the Peak stands out clear  from ocean to summit, looking every inch and more of its 12,080 ft.;  and this is said by the Canary fishermen to be a certain sign of  rain, or fine weather, or a gale of wind; but whenever and however  it may be seen, soft and dream-like in the sunshine, or melodramatic  and bizarre in the moonlight, it is one of the most beautiful things  the eye of man may see.    Soon after sighting Teneriffe, Lancarote showed, and then the Grand  Canary.  Teneriffe is perhaps the most beautiful, but it is hard to  judge between it and Grand Canary as seen from the sea.  The superb  cone this afternoon stood out a deep purple against a serpent-green  sky, separated from the brilliant blue ocean by a girdle of pink and  gold cumulus, while Grand Canary and Lancarote looked as if they  were formed from fantastic-shaped sunset cloud-banks that by some  spell had been solidified.  The general colour of the mountains of  Grand Canary, which rise peak after peak until they culminate in the  Pico de las Nieves, some 6,000 feet high, is a yellowish red, and  the air which lies among their rocky crevices and swathes their  softer sides is a lovely lustrous blue.    Just before the sudden dark came down, and when the sun was taking a  curve out of the horizon of sea, all the clouds gathered round the  three islands, leaving the sky a pure amethyst pink, and as a good-  night to them the sun outlined them with rims of shining gold, and  made the snow-clad Peak of Teneriffe blaze with star-white light.  In a few minutes came the dusk, and as we neared Grand Canary, out  of its cloud-bank gleamed the red flash of the lighthouse on the  Isleta, and in a few more minutes, along the sea level, sparkled the  five miles of irregularly distributed lights of Puerto de la Luz and  the city of Las Palmas.    We reached Sierra Leone at 9 A.M. on the 7th of January, and as the  place is hardly so much in touch with the general public as the  Canaries are {14} I may perhaps venture to go more into details  regarding it.  The harbour is formed by the long low strip of land  to the north called the Bullam shore, and to the south by the  peninsula terminating in Cape Sierra Leone, a sandy promontory at  the end of which is situated a lighthouse of irregular habits.  Low  hills covered with tropical forest growth rise from the sandy shores  of the Cape, and along its face are three creeks or bays, deep  inlets showing through their narrow entrances smooth beaches of  yellow sand, fenced inland by the forest of cotton-woods and palms,  with here and there an elephantine baobab.    The first of these bays is called Pirate Bay, the next English Bay,  and the third Kru Bay.  The wooded hills of the Cape rise after  passing Kru Bay, and become spurs of the mountain, 2,500 feet in  height, which is the Sierra Leone itself.  There are, however,  several mountains here besides the Sierra Leone, the most  conspicuous of them being the peak known as Sugar Loaf, and when  seen from the sea they are very lovely, for their form is noble, and  a wealth of tropical vegetation covers them, which, unbroken in its  continuity, but endless in its variety, seems to sweep over their  sides down to the shore like a sea, breaking here and there into a  surf of flowers.    It is the general opinion, indeed, of those who ought to know that  Sierra Leone appears at its best when seen from the sea,  particularly when you are leaving the harbour homeward bound; and  that here its charms, artistic, moral, and residential, end.  But,  from the experience I have gained of it, I have no hesitation in  saying that it is one of the best places for getting luncheon in  that I have ever happened on, and that a more pleasant and varied  way of spending an afternoon than going about its capital, Free  Town, with a certain Irish purser, who is as well known as he is  respected among the leviathan old negro ladies, it would be hard to  find.  Still it must be admitted it IS rather hot.    Free Town its capital is situated on the northern base of the  mountain, and extends along the sea-front with most business-like  wharves, quays, and warehouses.  Viewed from the harbour, \"The  Liverpool of West Africa,\" {15} as it is called, looks as if it were  built of gray stone, which it is not.  When you get ashore, you will  find that most of the stores and houses--the majority of which, it  may be remarked, are in a state of acute dilapidation--are of  painted wood, with corrugated iron roofs.  Here and there, though,  you will see a thatched house, its thatch covered with creeping  plants, and inhabited by colonies of creeping insects.    Some of the stores and churches are, it is true, built of stone, but  this does not look like stone at a distance, being red in colour--  unhewn blocks of the red stone of the locality.  In the crannies"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/59"],[0,"Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting One's Reason and of Seeking Truth (#4)"],[1,"by means of which  geometers are accustomed to reach the conclusions of their most  difficult demonstrations, had led me to imagine that all things, to the  knowledge of which man is competent, are mutually connected in the same  way, and that there is nothing so far removed from us as to be beyond  our reach, or so hidden that we cannot discover it, provided only we  abstain from accepting the false for the true, and always preserve in  our thoughts the order necessary for the deduction of one truth from  another.  And I had little difficulty in determining the objects with  which it was necessary to commence, for I was already persuaded that it  must be with the simplest and easiest to know, and, considering that of  all those who have hitherto sought truth in the sciences, the  mathematicians alone have been able to find any demonstrations, that  is, any certain and evident reasons, I did not doubt but that such must  have been the rule of their investigations.  I resolved to commence,  therefore, with the examination of the simplest objects, not  anticipating, however, from this any other advantage than that to be  found in accustoming my mind to the love and nourishment of truth, and  to a distaste for all such reasonings as were unsound.  But I had no  intention on that account of attempting to master all the particular  sciences commonly denominated mathematics:  but observing that, however  different their objects, they all agree in considering only the various  relations or proportions subsisting among those objects, I thought it  best for my purpose to consider these proportions in the most general  form possible, without referring them to any objects in particular,  except such as would most facilitate the knowledge of them, and without  by any means restricting them to these, that afterwards I might thus be  the better able to apply them to every other class of objects to which  they are legitimately applicable.  Perceiving further, that in order to  understand these relations I should sometimes have to consider them one  by one and sometimes only to bear them in mind, or embrace them in the  aggregate, I thought that, in order the better to consider them  individually, I should view them as subsisting between straight lines,  than which I could find no objects more simple, or capable of being  more distinctly represented to my imagination and senses; and on the  other hand, that in order to retain them in the memory or embrace an  aggregate of many, I should express them by certain characters the  briefest possible.  In this way I believed that I could borrow all that  was best both in geometrical analysis and in algebra, and correct all  the defects of the one by help of the other.    And, in point of fact, the accurate observance of these few precepts  gave me, I take the liberty of saying, such ease in unraveling all the  questions embraced in these two sciences, that in the two or three  months I devoted to their examination, not only did I reach solutions  of questions I had formerly deemed exceedingly difficult but even as  regards questions of the solution of which I continued ignorant, I was  enabled, as it appeared to me, to determine the means whereby, and the  extent to which a solution was possible; results attributable to the  circumstance that I commenced with the simplest and most general  truths, and that thus each truth discovered was a rule available in the  discovery of subsequent ones Nor in this perhaps shall I appear too  vain, if it be considered that, as the truth on any particular point is  one whoever apprehends the truth, knows all that on that  point can be  known.  The child, for example, who has been instructed in the elements  of arithmetic, and has made a particular addition, according to rule,  may be assured that he has found, with respect to the sum of the  numbers before him, and that in this instance is within the reach of  human genius.  Now, in conclusion, the method which teaches adherence  to the true order, and an exact enumeration of all the conditions of  the thing sought includes all that gives certitude to the rules of  arithmetic.    But the chief ground of my satisfaction with thus method, was the  assurance I had of thereby exercising my reason in all matters, if not  with absolute perfection, at least with the greatest attainable by me:  besides, I was conscious that by its use my mind was becoming gradually  habituated to clearer and more distinct conceptions of its objects; and  I hoped also, from not having restricted this method to any particular  matter, to apply it to the difficulties of the other sciences, with not  less success than to those of algebra.  I should not, however, on this  account have ventured at once on the examination of all the  difficulties of the sciences which presented themselves to me, for this  would have been contrary to the order prescribed in the method, but  observing that the knowledge of such is dependent on principles  borrowed from philosophy, in which I found nothing certain, I thought  it necessary first of all to endeavor to establish its principles.  And  because I observed, besides, that an inquiry of this kind was of all  others of the greatest moment, and one in which precipitancy and  anticipation in judgment were most to be dreaded, I thought that I  ought not to approach it till I had reached a more mature age (being at  that time but twenty-three), and had first of all employed much of my  time in preparation for the work, as well by eradicating from my mind  all the erroneous opinions I had up to that moment accepted, as by  amassing variety of experience to afford materials for my reasonings,  and by continually exercising myself in my chosen method with a view to  increased skill in its application.        PART III    And finally, as it is not enough, before commencing to rebuild the  house in which we live, that it be pulled down, and materials and  builders provided, or that we engage in the work ourselves, according  to a plan which we have beforehand carefully drawn out, but as it is  likewise necessary that we be furnished with some other house in which  we may live commodiously during the operations, so that I might not  remain irresolute in my actions, while my reason compelled me to  suspend my judgement, and that I might not be prevented from living  thenceforward in the greatest possible felicity, I formed a provisory  code of morals, composed of three or four maxims, with which I am  desirous to make you acquainted.    The first was to obey the laws and customs of my country, adhering  firmly to the faith in which, by the grace of God, I had been educated  from my childhood and regulating my conduct in every other matter  according to the most moderate opinions, and the farthest removed from  extremes, which should happen to be adopted in practice with general  consent of the most judicious of those among whom I might be living.  For as I had from that time begun to hold my own opinions for nought  because I wished to subject them all to examination, I was convinced  that I could not do better than follow in the meantime the opinions of  the most judicious; and although there are some perhaps among the  Persians and Chinese as judicious as among ourselves, expediency seemed  to dictate that I should regulate my practice conformably to the  opinions of those with whom I should have to live; and it appeared to  me that, in order to ascertain the real opinions of such, I ought  rather to take cognizance of what they practised than of what they  said, not only because, in the corruption of our manners, there are few  disposed to speak exactly as they believe, but also because very many  are not aware of what it is that they really believe; for, as the act  of mind by which a thing is believed is different from that by which we  know that we believe it, the one act is often found without the other.  Also, amid many opinions held in equal repute, I chose always the most  moderate, as much for the reason that these are always the most  convenient for practice, and probably the best (for all excess is  generally vicious), as that, in the event of my falling into error, I  might be at less distance from the truth than if, having chosen one of  the extremes, it should turn out to be the other which I ought to have  adopted.  And I placed in the class of extremes especially all promises  by which somewhat of our freedom is abridged; not that I disapproved of  the laws which, to provide against the instability of men of feeble  resolution, when what is sought to be accomplished is some good, permit  engagements by vows and contracts binding the parties to persevere in  it, or even, for the security of commerce, sanction similar engagements  where the purpose sought to be realized is indifferent:  but because I  did not find anything on earth which was wholly superior to change, and  because, for myself in particular, I hoped gradually to perfect my  judgments, and not to suffer them to deteriorate, I would have deemed  it a grave sin against good sense, if, for the reason that I approved  of something at a particular time, I therefore bound myself to hold it  for good at a subsequent time, when perhaps it had ceased to be so, or  I had ceased to esteem it such.    My second maxim was to be as firm and resolute in my actions as I was  able, and not to adhere less steadfastly to the most doubtful opinions,  when once adopted, than if they had been highly certain; imitating in  this the example of travelers who, when they have lost their way in a  forest, ought not to wander from side to side, far less remain in one  place, but proceed constantly towards the same side in as straight a  line as possible, without changing their direction for slight reasons,  although perhaps it might be chance alone which at first determined the  selection; for in this way, if they do not exactly reach the point"]]]
