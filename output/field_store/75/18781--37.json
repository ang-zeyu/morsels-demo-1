Of two countries, with an  equal amount of population, the wealthiest and most highly civilised  will consume the greatest weight of soap. This consumption does not  subserve sensual gratification, nor depend upon fashion, but upon  the feeling of the beauty, comfort, and welfare, attendant upon  cleanliness; and a regard to this feeling is coincident with wealth  and civilisation. The rich in the middle ages concealed a want of  cleanliness in their clothes and persons under a profusion of costly  scents and essences, whilst they were more luxurious in eating and  drinking, in apparel and horses. With us a want of cleanliness is  equivalent to insupportable misery and misfortune.    Soap belongs to those manufactured products, the money value of  which continually disappears from circulation, and requires to be  continually renewed. It is one of the few substances which are  entirely consumed by use, leaving no product of any worth. Broken  glass and bottles are by no means absolutely worthless; for rags we  may purchase new cloth, but soap-water has no value whatever. It  would be interesting to know accurately the amount of capital  involved in the manufacture of soap; it is certainly as large as  that employed in the coffee trade, with this important difference as  respects Germany, that it is entirely derived from our own soil.    France formerly imported soda from Spain,--Spanish sodas being of  the best quality--at an annual expenditure of twenty to thirty  millions of francs. During the war with England the price of soda,  and consequently of soap and glass, rose continually; and all  manufactures suffered in consequence.    The present method of making soda from common salt was discovered by  Le Blanc at the end of the last century. It was a rich boon for  France, and became of the highest importance during the wars of  Napoleon. In a very short time it was manufactured to an  extraordinary extent, especially at the seat of the soap  manufactories. Marseilles possessed for a time a monopoly of soda  and soap. The policy of Napoleon deprived that city of the  advantages derived from this great source of commerce, and thus  excited the hostility of the population to his dynasty, which became  favourable to the restoration of the Bourbons. A curious result of  an improvement in a chemical manufacture! It was not long, however,  in reaching England.    In order to prepare the soda of commerce (which is the carbonate)  from common salt, it is first converted into Glauber's salt  (sulphate of soda). For this purpose 80 pounds weight of  concentrated sulphuric acid (oil of vitriol) are required to 100  pounds of common salt. The duty upon salt checked, for a short time,  the full advantage of this discovery; but when the Government  repealed the duty, and its price was reduced to its minimum, the  cost of soda depended upon that of sulphuric acid.    The demand for sulphuric acid now increased to an immense extent;  and, to supply it, capital was embarked abundantly, as it afforded  an excellent remuneration. The origin and formation of sulphuric  acid was studied most carefully; and from year to year, better,  simpler, and cheaper methods of making it were discovered. With  every improvement in the mode of manufacture, its price fell; and  its sale increased in an equal ratio.    Sulphuric acid is now manufactured in leaden chambers, of such  magnitude that they would contain the whole of an ordinary-sized  house. As regards the process and the apparatus, this manufacture  has reached its acme--scarcely is either susceptible of improvement.  The leaden plates of which the chambers are constructed, requiring  to be joined together with lead (since tin or solder would be acted  on by the acid), this process was, until lately, as expensive as the  plates themselves; but now, by means of the oxy-hydrogen blowpipe,  the plates are cemented together at their edges by mere fusion,  without the intervention of any kind of solder.    And then, as to the process: according to theory, 100 pounds weight  of sulphur ought to produce 306 pounds of sulphuric acid; in  practice 300 pounds are actually obtained; the amount of loss is  therefore too insignificant for consideration.    Again; saltpetre being indispensable in making sulphuric acid, the  commercial value of that salt had formerly an important influence  upon its price. It is true that 100 pounds of saltpetre only are  required to 1000 pounds of sulphur; but its cost was four times  greater than an equal weight of the latter.    Travellers had observed near the small seaport of Yquiqui, in the  district of Atacama, in Peru, an efflorescence covering the ground  over extensive districts. This was found to consist principally of  nitrate of soda. Advantage was quickly taken of this discovery. The  quantity of this valuable salt proved to be inexhaustible, as it  exists in beds extending over more than 200 square miles. It was  brought to England at less than half the freight of the East India  saltpetre (nitrate of potassa); and as, in the chemical manufacture  neither the potash nor the soda were required, but only the nitric  acid, in combination with the alkali, the soda-saltpetre of South  America soon supplanted the potash-nitre of the East. The  manufacture of sulphuric acid received a new impulse; its price was  much diminished without injury to the manufacturer; and, with the  exception of fluctuations caused by the impediments thrown in the  way of the export of sulphur from Sicily, it soon became reduced to  a minimum, and remained stationary.    Potash-saltpetre is now only employed in the manufacture of  gunpowder; it is no longer in demand for other purposes; and thus,  if Government effect a saving of many hundred thousand pounds  annually in gunpowder, this economy must be attributed to the  increased manufacture of sulphuric acid.    We may form an idea of the amount of sulphuric acid consumed, when  we find that 50,000 pounds weight are made by a small manufactory,  and from 200,000 to 600,000 pounds by a large one annually. This  manufacture causes immense sums to flow annually into Sicily. It has  introduced industry and wealth into the arid and desolate districts  of Atacama. It has enabled us to obtain platina from its ores at a  moderate and yet remunerating price; since the vats employed for  concentrating this acid are constructed of this metal, and cost from  1000l. to 2000l. sterling. It leads to frequent improvements in the  manufacture of glass, which continually becomes cheaper and more  beautiful. It enables us to return to our fields all their potash--a  most valuable and important manure--in the form of ashes, by  substituting soda in the manufacture of glass and soap.    It is impossible to trace, within the compass of a letter, all the  ramifications of this tissue of changes and improvements resulting  from one chemical manufacture; but I must still claim your attention  to a few more of its most important and immediate results. I have  already told you, that in the manufacture of soda from culinary  salt, it is first converted into sulphate of soda. In this first  part of the process, the action of sulphuric acid produces muriatic  acid to the extent of one-and-a-half the amount of the sulphuric  acid employed. At first, the profit upon the soda was so great, that  no one took the trouble to collect the muriatic acid: indeed it had  no commercial value. A profitable application of it was, however,  soon discovered: it is a compound of chlorine, and this substance  may be obtained from it purer than from any other source. The  bleaching power of chlorine has long been known; but it was only  employed upon a large scale after it was obtained from this  residuary muriatic acid, and it was found that in combination with  lime it could be transported to distances without inconvenience.  Thenceforth it was used for bleaching cotton; and, but for this new  bleaching process, it would scarcely have been possible for the  cotton manufacture of Great Britain to have attained its present  enormous extent,--it could not have competed in price with France  and Germany. In the old process of bleaching, every piece must be  exposed to the air and light during several weeks in the summer, and  kept continually moist by manual labour. For this purpose, meadow  land, eligibly situated, was essential. Now a single establishment  near Glasgow bleaches 1400 pieces of cotton daily, throughout the  year. What an enormous capital would be required to purchase land  for this purpose! How greatly would it increase the cost of  bleaching to pay interest upon this capital, or to hire so much land  in England! This expense would scarcely have been felt in Germany.  Besides the diminished expense, the cotton stuffs bleached with  chlorine suffer less in the hands of skilful workmen than those  bleached in the sun; and already the peasantry in some parts of  Germany have adopted it, and find it advantageous.    Another use to which cheap muriatic acid is applied, is the  manufacture of glue from bones. Bone contains from 30 to 36 per  cent. of earthy matter--chiefly phosphate of lime, and the remainder  is gelatine. When bones are digested in muriatic acid they become  transparent and flexible like leather, the earthy matter is  dissolved, and after the acid is all carefully washed away, pieces  of glue of the same shape as the bones remain, which are soluble in  hot water and adapted to all the purposes of ordinary glue, without  further preparation.    Another important application of sulphuric acid may be adduced;  namely, to the refining of silver and the separation of gold, which  is always present in some proportion in native silver. Silver, as it  is usually obtained from mines in Europe, contains in 16 ounces, 6  to 8 ounces of copper. When used by the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45303"],[0,"The Life of John Taylor (#4)"],[1," monuments,  inferior to her in size, called her daughters. Near by is Lowther  Castle with its beautiful park; Eden Hall, the seat of the ancient  family of Musgrave; Arthur's Round Table, and Shap Abbey, are also  within a radius of five or six miles.    It was in the midst of this splendid scenery, made doubly enchanting  by historic associations and the monuments of those weird people,  the Druids, that John Taylor spent the days of his youth, from his  fifteenth to his twentieth year; and no doubt these surroundings had a  powerful effect on his then forming character, and did much to develop  the poetical impulses of his mind, for the power of poetry was not  among the least of his natural gifts. Thence, too, comes the splendid  imagery so frequently dashed into his sermons and writings. It was  there he saw the \"water nymphs playing with the clouds on mountain  tops, frolicking with the snow and rain in rugged gorges, coquetting  with the sun and dancing to the sheen of the moon;\" [1] there, too, he  saw the drifting clouds wrapping mountain peaks in solemn gloom, while  the flower-flecked vale below was flooded with warm sunlight. These  scenes and the impressions they formed he treasured up, and afterwards  made them clothe in splendid drapery an eloquence which held thousands  enchanted by the magic of its spell.    The religious nature of John Taylor began early to develope. His  parents were members, nominally, of the Church of England, and he was  told that that Church was the true one, and that the \"Roman Catholics  were a dreadful set of fellows.\" Indeed, it may be said that part of  the Church of England's creed in those days, though unwritten, was  \"down with the Pope.\" He learned the catechism and the prayers of  the church. In a fine vein of satire he says: \"I repeated week after  week--'We have erred and strayed from Thy ways like lost sheep. * * *  We have left undone those things which we ought to have done; and we  have done those things which we ought not to have done, and there is no  health in us; * * * have mercy upon us, miserable sinners.'\"    He was baptized into the church when an infant; a god-father and  god-mother promised and vowed for him that he would renounce the  devil and all his works--the pomp and vanity of this wicked world,  and all the deceitful lusts of the flesh; that he should believe all  the articles of the Christian faith, and keep God's holy laws and  commandments, and walk in the same all the days of his life. \"How far I  have filled their pledges,\" he says, \"I must leave others to judge.\"    In childhood and youth he was naturally vivacious, and seems to have  had but little regard for the stiff formula of church creed, and was  without any definite idea of correct religious views; still he had a  deep reverence for God; with him it was an intuition, and he dreaded  nothing so much as offending Him.    When about sixteen he heard the Methodist doctrines taught, and as he  perceived more spiritual light and force in their teachings than in the  cold, set services of the Church of England, he became a Methodist.  He was strictly sincere in his religious faith, and very zealous to  learn what he then considered to be the truth. Believing that \"every  good and perfect gift proceedeth from the Lord,\" he prayed frequently  in private. Most of his leisure hours were spent in reading the Bible,  works on theology and in prayer. For the latter purpose he usually  resorted to secluded places in the woods and fields. The missionary  spirit about this time began to develop in him. He induced a number  of boys about his own age to join with him in secret prayer, but they  generally soon forsook him. He relates a circumstance that must have  occurred about this time, that still further gives evidence of the  missionary spirit working within him. Living in the same neighborhood  was an old gentleman whom he greatly respected; he was a good man,  a praying man, but he had a wife who did not want to pray, and also  interfered with his devotions. She was restless and turbulent, a kind  of thorn in his flesh. Under these circumstances he did not get along  very well, but it used to drive him to the Lord. After a while she  died, and he married again; this time to a very amiable lady. His wife  was so pleasant and agreeable, that the change in his circumstances was  very great. Being thus comfortably situated he became remiss in his  religious duties; and among other things gave way to the temptations  of liquor. Observing the course he was taking, young Taylor took up a  labor with him. He felt a little abashed on account of his youth, but  because of long friendship, and out of respect for the old gentleman's  many good qualities, he felt it his duty to call his attention to his  neglect of Christian precepts. He told him how he had seen him drunk a  few days previously, and how it had hurt his feelings, as his course  hitherto had been exemplary. The old gentleman appreciated the good  feelings, the respect and courage of his young friend, deplored his  weakness and promised amendment.    Young Taylor possessed a portion of the spirit of God and was very  happy. Manifestations of its presence were frequent, not only in the  expansion of his mind to understand doctrines and principles, but also  in dreams and visions. \"Often when alone,\" he writes, \"and sometimes  in company, I heard sweet, soft, melodious music, as if performed  by angelic or supernatural beings.\" When but a small boy he saw, in  vision, an angel in the heavens, holding a trumpet to his mouth,  sounding a message to the nations. The import of this vision he did not  understand until later in life.    At the age of seventeen he was made a Methodist exhorter, or local  preacher. His first appointment was at a small country town some  seven miles from Penrith. A brother in the same church accompanied  him; and when the two had walked about a mile from Penrith, young  Taylor suddenly stopped, overpowered by a peculiar influence, and as  he stood there in the road, he remarked to his companion, \"I have a  strong impression on my mind, that I have to go to America to preach  the gospel!\" At the time he knew nothing of America but what he had  learned in his geography at school; and emigration to that country had  not been thought of then by his family. So strong was the voice of the  spirit to him on that occasion that it continued to impress him as long  as he remained in that land; and even after he arrived in Canada, a  presentiment that he could not shake off, clung to him that he had some  work to do which he did not then understand.    At the age of twenty, having mastered the business of turner, young  Taylor left Penrith, and in the town of Hale started business for  himself, under the auspices of his father. Shortly after this, in 1830,  his father and family emigrated to Upper Canada, leaving him to dispose  of some unsold property and settle the affairs of the estate.    In about two years he completed the business entrusted to him and  followed them. While crossing the British channel the ship he sailed  in encountered severe storms, which lasted a number of days. He saw  several ships wrecked in that storm, and the captain and officers of  his own ship expected hourly that she would go down. But not so with  our young emigrant. The voice of the Spirit was still saying within  him, \"You must yet go to America and preach the gospel.\" \"So confident  was I of my destiny,\" he remarks, \"that I went on deck at midnight, and  amidst the raging elements felt as calm as though I was sitting in a  parlor at home. I believed I should reach America and perform my work.\"    Footnotes    1. From Taylor's Reply to Colfax.        CHAPTER III.    ARRIVAL IN CANADA--MARRIAGE--LEONORA--A MESSAGE FROM  GOD--INVESTIGATION--EMBRACES THE GOSPEL.    Landing in New York, he remained there and in Brooklyn and Albany a few  months before going on to Toronto, Upper Canada, where he was to rejoin  his parents.    After his arrival in Toronto he connected himself with the Methodists  in that city, and began preaching under the auspices of their church  organization. It was while he was engaged in this work that he met  Leonora Cannon, to whom he was married on the 28th of January, 1833.    Leonora Cannon was a daughter of Captain George Cannon (grandfather  of President George Q. Cannon) of Peel, Isle of Man. Captain Cannon  died while Leonora was yet in her girlhood; the old homestead in Peel  was rented to strangers, and she went to reside in England with a lady  named Vail. Later she became an inmate of Governor Smelt's family,  residing in Castle Rushen, Castletown, Isle of Man. Here she frequently  met with many distinguished people from England. Finally in the  capacity of companion to the wife of Mr. Mason, the private secretary  of Lord Aylmer, Governor General of Canada, she went to Toronto, and  being a devout Methodist, associated with that church and there met Mr.  Taylor, who became her class leader.    His first proposal of marriage was rejected; but afterwards, through a  dream in which she saw herself associated with him, she was convinced  that he would be her husband. Therefore, when he renewed his proposal,  he was accepted.    Refined both by nature and education, gentle and lady-like in manner,  witty, intelligent, gifted with rare conversational powers, possessed  of a deep religious sentiment, and, withal, remarkable for the beauty  of her person, she was a fitting companion to John Taylor.    Mrs. Taylor frequently accompanied her husband in filling his  appointments to preach on the Sabbath, and he often alluded to the  singular revelation he had received in his youth, about his having to  preach the gospel in America.    \"Are you not now preaching the gospel in America?\" Leonora would ask.    \"This is not the work; it is something of more importance,\" he would  answer.
