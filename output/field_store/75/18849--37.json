He remained leaning against the table, watching  Ransford write the cheque. And when Ransford laid the cheque down at the  edge of the desk he made no movement towards it.    \"You must see,\" remarked Ransford, half apologetically, \"that it's the  only thing I can do. I can't have any man who's not--not welcome to  her, to put it plainly--causing any annoyance to my ward. I repeat,  Bryce--you must see it!\"    \"I have nothing to do with what you see,\" answered Bryce. \"Your opinions  are not mine, and mine aren't yours. You're really turning me away--as  if I were a dishonest foreman!--because in my opinion it would be a very  excellent thing for her and for myself if Miss Bewery would consent to  marry me. That's the plain truth.\"    Ransford allowed himself to take a long and steady look at Bryce. The  thing was done now, and his dismissed assistant seemed to be taking it  quietly--and Ransford's curiosity was aroused.    \"I can't make you out!\" he exclaimed. \"I don't know whether you're the  most cynical young man I ever met, or whether you're the most obtuse--\"    \"Not the last, anyway,\" interrupted Bryce. \"I assure you of that!\"    \"Can't you see for yourself, then, man, that the girl doesn't want you!\"  said Ransford. \"Hang it!--for anything you know to the contrary, she may  have--might have--other ideas!\"    Bryce, who had been staring out of a side window for the last minute or  two, suddenly laughed, and, lifting a hand, pointed into the garden. And  Ransford turned--and saw Mary Bewery walking there with a tall lad, whom  he recognized as one Sackville Bonham, stepson of Mr. Folliot, a wealthy  resident of the Close. The two young people were laughing and chatting  together with evident great friendliness.    \"Perhaps,\" remarked Bryce quietly, \"her ideas run in--that direction? In  which case, Dr. Ransford, you'll have trouble. For Mrs. Folliot, mother  of yonder callow youth, who's the apple of her eye, is one of the  inquisitive ladies of whom I've just told you, and if her son unites  himself with anybody, she'll want to know exactly who that anybody is.  You'd far better have supported me as an aspirant! However--I suppose  there's no more to say.\"    \"Nothing!\" answered Ransford. \"Except to say good-day--and good-bye to  you. You needn't remain--I'll see to everything. And I'm going out now.  I think you'd better not exchange any farewells with any one.\"    Bryce nodded silently, and Ransford, picking up his hat and gloves, left  the surgery by the side door. A moment later, Bryce saw him crossing the  Close.          CHAPTER III. ST. WRYTHA'S STAIR      The summarily dismissed assistant, thus left alone, stood for a moment  in evident deep thought before he moved towards Ransford's desk and  picked up the cheque. He looked at it carefully, folded it neatly, and  put it away in his pocket-book; after that he proceeded to collect a  few possessions of his own, instruments, books from various drawers and  shelves. He was placing these things in a small hand-bag when a gentle  tap sounded on the door by which patients approached the surgery.    \"Come in!\" he called.    There was no response, although the door was slightly ajar; instead,  the knock was repeated, and at that Bryce crossed the room and flung the  door open.    A man stood outside--an elderly, slight-figured, quiet-looking man, who  looked at Bryce with a half-deprecating, half-nervous air; the air of a  man who was shy in manner and evidently fearful of seeming to intrude.  Bryce's quick, observant eyes took him in at a glance, noting a much  worn and lined face, thin grey hair and tired eyes; this was a man, he  said to himself, who had seen trouble. Nevertheless, not a poor man,  if his general appearance was anything to go by--he was well and even  expensively dressed, in the style generally affected by well-to-do  merchants and city men; his clothes were fashionably cut, his silk hat  was new, his linen and boots irreproachable; a fine diamond pin gleamed  in his carefully arranged cravat. Why, then, this unmistakably furtive  and half-frightened manner--which seemed to be somewhat relieved at the  sight of Bryce?    \"Is this--is Dr. Ransford within?\" asked the stranger. \"I was told this  is his house.\"    \"Dr. Ransford is out,\" replied Bryce. \"Just gone out--not five minutes  ago. This is his surgery. Can I be of use?\"    The man hesitated, looking beyond Bryce into the room.    \"No, thank you,\" he said at last. \"I--no, I don't want professional  services--I just called to see Dr. Ransford--I--the fact is, I once knew  some one of that name. It's no matter--at present.\"    Bryce stepped outside and pointed across the Close.    \"Dr. Ransford,\" he said, \"went over there--I rather fancy he's gone to  the Deanery--he has a case there. If you went through Paradise, you'd  very likely meet him coming back--the Deanery is the big house in the  far corner yonder.\"    The stranger followed Bryce's outstretched finger.    \"Paradise?\" he said, wonderingly. \"What's that?\"    Bryce pointed to a long stretch of grey wall which projected from the  south wall of the Cathedral into the Close.    \"It's an enclosure--between the south porch and the transept,\" he said.  \"Full of old tombs and trees--a sort of wilderness--why called Paradise  I don't know. There's a short cut across it to the Deanery and that part  of the Close--through that archway you see over there. If you go across,  you're almost sure to meet Dr. Ransford.\"    \"I'm much obliged to you,\" said the stranger. \"Thank you.\"    He turned away in the direction which Bryce had indicated, and Bryce  went back--only to go out again and call after him.    \"If you don't meet him, shall I say you'll call again?\" he asked.  \"And--what name?\"    The stranger shook his head.    \"It's immaterial,\" he answered. \"I'll see him--somewhere--or later. Many  thanks.\"    He went on his way towards Paradise, and Bryce returned to the surgery  and completed his preparations for departure. And in the course of  things, he more than once looked through the window into the garden and  saw Mary Bewery still walking and talking with young Sackville Bonham.    \"No,\" he muttered to himself. \"I won't trouble to exchange any  farewells--not because of Ransford's hint, but because there's no need.  If Ransford thinks he's going to drive me out of Wrychester before I  choose to go he's badly mistaken--it'll be time enough to say farewell  when I take my departure--and that won't be just yet. Now I wonder  who that old chap was? Knew some one of Ransford's name once, did he?  Probably Ransford himself--in which case he knows more of Ransford than  anybody in Wrychester knows--for nobody in Wrychester knows anything  beyond a few years back. No, Dr. Ransford!--no farewells--to anybody! A  mere departure--till I turn up again.\"    But Bryce was not to get away from the old house without something in  the nature of a farewell. As he walked out of the surgery by the side  entrance, Mary Bewery, who had just parted from young Bonham in the  garden and was about to visit her dogs in the stable yard, came along:  she and Bryce met, face to face. The girl flushed, not so much from  embarrassment as from vexation; Bryce, cool as ever, showed no sign of  any embarrassment. Instead, he laughed, tapping the hand-bag which he  carried under one arm.    \"Summarily turned out--as if I had been stealing the spoons,\" he  remarked. \"I go--with my small belongings. This is my first reward--for  devotion.\"    \"I have nothing to say to you,\" answered Mary, sweeping by him with a  highly displeased glance. \"Except that you have brought it on yourself.\"    \"A very feminine retort!\" observed Bryce. \"But--there is no malice in  it? Your anger won't last more than--shall we say a day?\"    \"You may say what you like,\" she replied. \"As I just said, I have  nothing to say--now or at any time.\"    \"That remains to be proved,\" remarked Bryce. \"The phrase is one of much  elasticity. But for the present--I go!\"    He walked out into the Close, and without as much as a backward look  struck off across the sward in the direction in which, ten minutes  before, he had sent the strange man. He had rooms in a quiet lane on the  farther side of the Cathedral precinct, and his present intention was to  go to them to leave his bag and make some further arrangements. He had  no idea of leaving Wrychester--he knew of another doctor in the city who  was badly in need of help: he would go to him--would tell him, if need  be, why he had left Ransford. He had a multiplicity of schemes and ideas  in his head, and he began to consider some of them as he stepped out of  the Close into the ancient enclosure which all Wrychester folk knew by  its time-honoured name of Paradise. This was really an outer court of  the old cloisters; its high walls, half-ruinous, almost wholly covered  with ivy, shut in an expanse of turf, liberally furnished with yew and  cypress and studded with tombs and gravestones. In one corner rose a  gigantic elm; in another a broken stairway of stone led to a doorway set  high in the walls of the nave; across the enclosure itself was a pathway  which led towards the houses in the south-east corner of the Close. It  was a curious, gloomy spot, little frequented save by people who went  across it rather than follow the gravelled paths outside, and it was  untenanted when Bryce stepped into it. But just as he walked through the  archway he saw Ransford. Ransford was emerging hastily"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5311"],[0,"Parnassus on Wheels (#4)"],[1,"sted.\"    I filled a sack with oats in the stable and Mr. Mifflin showed me  where to hang it under the van. Then in the kitchen I loaded a big  basket with provisions for an emergency: a dozen eggs, a jar of  sliced bacon, butter, cheese, condensed milk, tea, biscuits, jam,  and two loaves of bread. These Mr. Mifflin stowed inside the van,  Mrs. McNally watching in amazement.    \"I tank this bane a queer picnic!\" she said. \"Which way are you  going? Mr. McGill, is he coming after you?\"    \"No,\" I insisted, \"he's not coming. I'm going off on a holiday. You  get dinner for him and he won't worry about anything until after  that. Tell him I've gone over to see Mrs. Collins.\"    I climbed the little steps and entered my Parnassus with a pleasant  thrill of ownership. The terrier on the bunk jumped to the floor  with a friendly wag of the tail. I piled the bunk with bedding and  blankets of my own, shook out the drawers which fitted above the  bunk, and put into them what few belongings I was taking with me.  And we were ready to start.    Redbeard was already sitting in front with the reins in hand. I  climbed up beside him. The front seat was broad but uncushioned,  well sheltered by the peak of the van. I gave a quick glance around  at the comfortable house under its elms and maples--saw the big, red  barn shining in the sun and the pump under the grape arbour. I waved  good-bye to Mrs. McNally who was watching us in silent amazement.  Pegasus threw her solid weight against the traces and Parnassus  swung round and rolled past the gate. We turned into the Redfield  road.    \"Here,\" said Mifflin, handing me the reins, \"you're skipper, you'd  better drive. Which way do you want to go?\"    My breath came a little fast when I realized that my adventure had  begun!        CHAPTER FOUR      Just out of sight of the farm the road forks, one way running on  to Walton where you cross the river by a covered bridge, the other  swinging down toward Greenbriar and Port Vigor. Mrs. Collins lives a  mile or so up the Walton road, and as I very often run over to see  her I thought Andrew would be most likely to look for me there. So,  after we had passed through the grove, I took the right-hand turn to  Greenbriar. We began the long ascent over Huckleberry Hill and as I  smelt the fresh autumn odour of the leaves I chuckled a little.    Mr. Mifflin seemed in a perfect ecstasy of high spirits. \"This is  certainly grand,\" he said. \"Lord, I applaud your spunk. Do you think  Mr. McGill will give chase?\"    \"I haven't an idea,\" I said. \"Not right away, anyhow. He's so used  to my settled ways that I don't think he'll suspect anything till he  finds my note. I wonder what kind of story Mrs. McNally will tell!\"    \"How about putting him off the scent?\" he said. \"Give me your  handkerchief.\"    I did so. He hopped nimbly out, ran back down the hill (he was a  spry little person in spite of his bald crown), and dropped the  handkerchief on the Walton Road about a hundred feet beyond the  fork. Then he followed me up the slope.    \"There,\" he said, grinning like a kid, \"that'll fool him. The Sage  of Redfield will undoubtedly follow a false spoor and the criminals  will win a good start. But I'm afraid it's rather easy to follow a  craft as unusual as Parnassus.\"    \"Tell me how you manage the thing,\" I said. \"Do you really make it  pay?\" We halted at the top of the hill to give Pegasus a breathing  space. The terrier lay down in the dust and watched us gravely. Mr.  Mifflin pulled out a pipe and begged my permission to smoke.    \"It's rather comical how I first got into it,\" he said. \"I was a  school teacher down in Maryland. I'd been plugging away in a country  school for years, on a starvation salary. I was trying to support an  invalid mother, and put by something in case of storms. I remember  how I used to wonder whether I'd ever be able to wear a suit that  wasn't shabby and have my shoes polished every day. Then my health  went back on me. The doctor told me to get into the open air. By and  by I got this idea of a travelling bookstore. I had always been a  lover of books, and in the days when I boarded out among the farmers  I used to read aloud to them. After my mother died I built the wagon  to suit my own ideas, bought a stock of books from a big second-hand  store in Baltimore, and set out. Parnassus just about saved my life  I guess.\"    He pushed his faded old cap back on his head and relit his pipe.  I clicked to Pegasus and we rumbled gently off over the upland,  looking down across the pastures. Distant cow bells sounded  tankle-tonk among the bushes. Across the slope of the hill I could  see the road winding away to Redfield. Somewhere along that road  Andrew would be rolling back toward home and roast pork with apple  sauce; and here was I, setting out on the first madness of my life  without even a qualm.    \"Miss McGill,\" said the little man, \"this rolling pavilion has been  wife, doctor, and religion to me for seven years. A month ago I  would have scoffed at the thought of leaving her; but somehow it's  come over me I need a change. There's a book I've been yearning to  write for a long time, and I need a desk steady under my elbows and  a roof over my head. And silly as it seems, I'm crazy to get back  to Brooklyn. My brother and I used to live there as kids. Think  of walking over the old Bridge at sunset and seeing the towers of  Manhattan against a red sky! And those old gray cruisers down in the  Navy Yard! You don't know how tickled I am to sell out. I've sold a  lot of copies of your brother's books and I've often thought he'd be  the man to buy Parnassus if I got tired of her.\"    \"So he would,\" I said. \"Just the man. He'd be only too likely  to--and go maundering about in this jaunting car and neglect the  farm. But tell me about selling books. How much profit do you make  out of it? We'll be passing Mrs. Mason's farm, by and by, and we  might as well sell her something just to make a start.\"    \"It's very simple,\" he said. \"I replenish my stock whenever I go  through a big town. There's always a second-hand bookstore somewhere  about, where you can pick up odds and ends. And every now and then I  write to a wholesaler in New York for some stuff. When I buy a book  I mark in the back just what I paid for it, then I know what I can  afford to sell it for. See here.\"    He pulled up a book from behind the seat--a copy of \"Lorna Doone\" it  was--and showed me the letters _a m_ scrawled in pencil in the back.    \"That means that I paid ten cents for this. Now, if you sell it for  a quarter you've got a safe profit. It costs me about four dollars a  week to run Parnassus--generally less. If you clear that much in six  days you can afford to lay off on Sundays!\"    \"How do you know that _a m_ stands for ten cents?\" I asked.    \"The code word's _manuscript_. Each letter stands for a figure,  from 0 up to 9, see?\" He scrawled it down on a scrap of paper:      m a n u s c r i p t    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9    \"Now, you see _a m_ stands for 10, _a n_ would be 12, _n s_ is 24,  _a c_ is 15, _a m m_ is $1.00, and so on. I don't pay much over  fifty cents for books as a rule, because country folks are shy of  paying much for them. They'll pay a lot for a separator or a buggy  top, but they've never been taught to worry about literature! But  it's surprising how excited they get about books if you sell 'em the  right kind. Over beyond Port Vigor there's a farmer who's waiting  for me to go back--I've been there three or four times--and he'll  buy about five dollars' worth if I know him. First time I went there  I sold him 'Treasure Island,' and he's talking about it yet. I sold  him 'Robinson Crusoe,' and 'Little Women' for his daughter, and  'Huck Finn,' and Grubb's book about 'The Potato.' Last time I was  there he wanted some Shakespeare, but I wouldn't give it to him.  I didn't think he was up to it yet.\"    I began to see something of the little man's idealism in his work.  He was a kind of traveling missionary in his way. A hefty talker,  too. His eyes were twinkling now and I could see him warming up.    \"Lord!\" he said, \"when you sell a man a book you don't sell him  just twelve ounces of paper and ink and glue--you sell him a whole  new life. Love and friendship and humour and ships at sea by  night--there's all heaven and earth in a book, a real book I mean.  Jiminy! If I were the baker or the butcher or the broom huckster,  people would run to the gate when I came by--just waiting for my  stuff. And here I go loaded with everlasting salvation--yes, ma'am,  salvation for their little, stunted minds--and it's hard to make 'em  see it. That's what makes it worth while--I'm doing something that  nobody else from Nazareth, Maine, to Walla Walla, Washington, has  ever thought of. It's a new field, but by the bones of Whitman it's  worth while. That's what this country needs--more books!\"    He laughed at his own vehemence. \"Do you know, it's comical,\" he  said. \"Even the publishers, the fellows that print the books,  can't see what I'm doing for them. Some of 'em refuse me credit  because I sell their books for what they're worth instead of  for the prices they mark on them. They write me letters about  price-maintenance--and I write back about merit-maintenance.  Publish a good book and I'll get a good price for it, say I!  Sometimes I think the publishers know less about books than any  one else! I guess that's natural, though. Most school teachers  don't know much about children.\"    \"The best of it is,\" he went on, \"I have such a darn good time.  Peg and Bock (that's the dog) and I go loafing along the road on  a warm summer day, and by and by we'll fetch up alongside some  boarding-house and there are the boarders all rocking off their  lunch on the veranda. Most of 'em bored to death--nothing good to  read, nothing to do but sit and watch the flies buzzing in the sun  and the chickens rubbing up and down in"]]]
