Callippus (330 B.C.) used a cycle four times as long, 940 lunations,  but one day short of Melon's seventy-six years. This was more correct.    Eudoxus (406-350 B.C.) is said to have travelled with Plato in  Egypt. He made astronomical observations in Asia Minor, Sicily, and  Italy, and described the starry heavens divided into constellations.  His name is connected with a planetary theory which as generally  stated sounds most fanciful. He imagined the fixed stars to be on a  vault of heaven; and the sun, moon, and planets to be upon similar  vaults or spheres, twenty-six revolving spheres in all, the motion of  each planet being resolved into its components, and a separate sphere  being assigned for each component motion. Callippus (330 B.C.)  increased the number to thirty-three. It is now generally accepted  that the real existence of these spheres was not suggested, but the  idea was only a mathematical conception to facilitate the construction  of tables for predicting the places of the heavenly bodies.    Aristotle (384-322 B.C.) summed up the state of astronomical knowledge  in his time, and held the earth to be fixed in the centre of the  world.    Nicetas, Heraclides, and Ecphantes supposed the earth to revolve on  its axis, but to have no orbital motion.    The short epitome so far given illustrates the extraordinary deductive  methods adopted by the ancient Greeks. But they went much farther in  the same direction. They seem to have been in great difficulty to  explain how the earth is supported, just as were those who invented  the myth of Atlas, or the Indians with the tortoise. Thales thought  that the flat earth floated on water. Anaxagoras thought that, being  flat, it would be buoyed up and supported on the air like a kite.  Democritus thought it remained fixed, like the donkey between two  bundles of hay, because it was equidistant from all parts of the  containing sphere, and there was no reason why it should incline one  way rather than another. Empedocles attributed its state of rest to  centrifugal force by the rapid circular movement of the heavens, as  water is stationary in a pail when whirled round by a string.  Democritus further supposed that the inclination of the flat earth to  the ecliptic was due to the greater weight of the southern parts owing  to the exuberant vegetation.    For further references to similar efforts of imagination the reader is  referred to Sir George Cornwall Lewis's _Historical Survey of the  Astronomy of the Ancients_; London, 1862. His list of authorities  is very complete, but some of his conclusions are doubtful.  At p. 113  of that work he records the real opinions of Socrates as set forth by  Xenophon; and the reader will, perhaps, sympathise with Socrates in  his views on contemporary astronomy:--    With regard to astronomy he [Socrates] considered a knowledge of it  desirable to the extent of determining the day of the year or month,  and the hour of the night, ... but as to learning the courses of the  stars, to be occupied with the planets, and to inquire about their  distances from the earth, and their orbits, and the causes of their  motions, he strongly objected to such a waste of valuable time. He  dwelt on the contradictions and conflicting opinions of the physical  philosophers, ... and, in fine, he held that the speculators on the  universe and on the laws of the heavenly bodies were no better than  madmen (_Xen. Mem_, i. 1, 11-15).    Plato (born 429 B.C.), the pupil of Socrates, the fellow-student of  Euclid, and a follower of Pythagoras, studied science in his travels  in Egypt and elsewhere.  He was held in so great reverence by all  learned men that a problem which he set to the astronomers was the  keynote to all astronomical investigation from this date till the time  of Kepler in the sixteenth century. He proposed to astronomers _the  problem of representing the courses of the planets by circular and  uniform motions_.    Systematic observation among the Greeks began with the rise of the  Alexandrian school. Aristillus and Timocharis set up instruments and  fixed the positions of the zodiacal stars, near to which all the  planets in their orbits pass, thus facilitating the determination of  planetary motions. Aristarchus (320-250 B.C.) showed that the sun must  be at least nineteen times as far off as the moon, which is far short  of the mark. He also found the sun's diameter, correctly, to be half a  degree.  Eratosthenes (276-196 B.C.) measured the inclination to the  equator of the sun's apparent path in the heavens--i.e., he  measured the obliquity of the ecliptic, making it 23 deg. 51', confirming  our knowledge of its continuous diminution during historical times. He  measured an arc of meridian, from Alexandria to Syene (Assuan), and  found the difference of latitude by the length of a shadow at noon,  summer solstice. He deduced the diameter of the earth, 250,000  stadia. Unfortunately, we do not know the length of the stadium he  used.    Hipparchus (190-120 B.C.) may be regarded as the founder of  observational astronomy. He measured the obliquity of the ecliptic,  and agreed with Eratosthenes.  He altered the length of the tropical  year from 365 days, 6 hours to 365 days, 5 hours, 53 minutes--still  four minutes too much. He measured the equation of time and the  irregular motion of the sun; and allowed for this in his calculations  by supposing that the centre, about which the sun moves uniformly, is  situated a little distance from the fixed earth. He called this point  the _excentric_. The line from the earth to the \"excentric\" was  called the _line of apses_. A circle having this centre was  called the _equant_, and he supposed that a radius drawn to the  sun from the excentric passes over equal arcs on the equant in equal  times. He then computed tables for predicting the place of the sun.    He proceeded in the same way to compute Lunar tables. Making use of  Chaldaean eclipses, he was able to get an accurate value of the moon's  mean motion.  [Halley, in 1693, compared this value with his own  measurements, and so discovered the acceleration of the moon's mean  motion. This was conclusively established, but could not be explained  by the Newtonian theory for quite a long time.] He determined the  plane of the moon's orbit and its inclination to the ecliptic. The  motion of this plane round the pole of the ecliptic once in eighteen  years complicated the problem. He located the moon's excentric as he  had done the sun's.  He also discovered some of the minor  irregularities of the moon's motion, due, as Newton's theory proves,  to the disturbing action of the sun's attraction.    In the year 134 B.C. Hipparchus observed a new star.  This upset every  notion about the permanence of the fixed stars. He then set to work to  catalogue all the principal stars so as to know if any others appeared  or disappeared. Here his experiences resembled those of several later  astronomers, who, when in search of some special object, have been  rewarded by a discovery in a totally different direction. On comparing  his star positions with those of Timocharis and Aristillus he found no  stars that had appeared or disappeared in the interval of 150 years;  but he found that all the stars seemed to have changed their places  with reference to that point in the heavens where the ecliptic is 90 deg.  from the poles of the earth--i.e., the equinox. He found that this  could be explained by a motion of the equinox in the direction of the  apparent diurnal motion of the stars. This discovery of _precession of  the equinoxes_, which takes place at the rate of 52\".1 every year, was  necessary for the progress of accurate astronomical observations. It  is due to a steady revolution of the earth's pole round the pole of  the ecliptic once in 26,000 years in the opposite direction to the  planetary revolutions.    Hipparchus was also the inventor of trigonometry, both plane and  spherical. He explained the method of using eclipses for determining  the longitude.    In connection with Hipparchus' great discovery it may be mentioned  that modern astronomers have often attempted to fix dates in history  by the effects of precession of the equinoxes. (1) At about the date  when the Great Pyramid may have been built gamma Draconis was near to the  pole, and must have been used as the pole-star. In the north face of  the Great Pyramid is the entrance to an inclined passage, and six of  the nine pyramids at Gizeh possess the same feature; all the passages  being inclined at an angle between 26 deg. and 27 deg. to the horizon and in  the plane of the meridian. It also appears that 4,000 years  ago--i.e., about 2100 B.C.--an observer at the lower end of the  passage would be able to see gamma Draconis, the then pole-star, at its  lower culmination.[1] It has been suggested that the passage was made  for this purpose. On other grounds the date assigned to the Great  Pyramid is 2123 B.C.    (2) The Chaldaeans gave names to constellations now invisible from  Babylon which would have been visible in 2000 B.C., at which date it  is claimed that these people were studying astronomy.    (3) In the Odyssey, Calypso directs Odysseus, in accordance with  Phoenician rules for navigating the Mediterranean, to keep the Great  Bear \"ever on the left as he traversed the deep\" when sailing from the  pillars of Hercules (Gibraltar) to Corfu. Yet such a course taken now  would land the traveller in Africa.  Odysseus is said in his voyage in  springtime to have seen the Pleiades and Arcturus setting late, which  seemed to early commentators a proof of Homer's inaccuracy.  Likewise  Homer, both in the _Odyssey_ [2] (v. 272-5) and in the _Iliad_  (xviii. 489), asserts that the Great Bear never set in those  latitudes.

Confusion is apt to occur in English in the use of the words \"him, her,  it, them; his, hers, its, their\", e.g., \"John loves his brother and his  children.\" Whose children, John's or his brother's? \"The boys brought to  their fathers their hats.\" Whose hats, the boys' or their fathers'? \"She  gave her sister her book.\" Whose book? Her own or her sister's?    This confusion is avoided in Esperanto by the use of, the pronoun \"si\"  (\"sin\"), meaning \"himself, herself, itself, themselves\", and \"sia,\"  meaning \"his own, her own, its own, their own.\"    \"Si\" (\"sin, sia\") refers to the \"subject\" of the sentence in which it  occurs; therefore in the sentence \"John loves his brother and his son,\"  it must be \"Johano amas sian fraton kaj sian filon\" if it is his own  (John's) son, because John is the subject, but we must say \"lian filon\"  if the brother's son is meant. \"La knaboj alportis al siaj patroj siajn  cxapelojn\" means \"The boys brought to their fathers their own (the  boys') hats,\" because \"boys\" is the subject, but if we mean \"the  fathers' hats\" it must be \"iliajn cxapelojn.\"    \"She gave to her sister her book\" must be \"Sxi donis al sia fratino sian  libron\" if it were her own book, but \"Sxi donis al sia fratino sxian  libron\" if it were her sister's book. \"Li diris al si\"... means \"He  said to himself,\" but \"Li diris al li\" means that he said it to another  person.    \"Si\", \"sia\", can only \"refer to\" the subject, it cannot be the subject  itself or any part of it; therefore we must say \"Sinjoro P. kaj lia  edzino tre amas miajn infanojn\", because the subject is \"Sinjoro P. kaj  lia edzino.\"    \"Mem,\" self, is only used for emphasis, \"e.g.\", \"Mi mem,\" my (own) self.

The Ordinal Numbers, first, second, etc., are formed by adding \"a\" to  the Cardinal Numbers, as \"unua\", first; \"dua\", second; \"tria\", third;  \"kvara\", fourth; \"deka\", tenth; \"centa\", hundredth; \"mila\", thousandth.  The compound numbers are joined together by hyphens, and \"a\" is added  to the last, as \"dek-unua\", eleventh; \"la tridek-nauxa pagxo\", the  thirty-ninth page; la \"cent-kvardek-kvina psalmo\", the 145th psalm.  Being adjectives, the Ordinal Numbers take the plural \"j\" and accusative  \"n\" when necessary.    The Ordinals are used to tell the hour, as \"Estas la trio, horo\", It is  3 o'clock. The Cardinal Numbers are used for the minutes, as \"A quarter  past three\" is \"La tria horo kaj dek-kvin\"; \"Ten minutes to five,\" \"La  kvara horo kaj kvindek\".    Januaro estas la unua monato de la jaro, Aprilo estas la kvara, Novembro  estas la dek-unua, kaj Decembro estas la dek-dua. La dudeka (tago) de  Februaro estas la kvindek-unua tago de la jaro.

The names of certain quantities are formed from the cardinal numbers  by adding \"o\", as \"dekduo\", a dozen; \"dudeko\", a score; \"cento\", a  hundred; \"milo\", a thousand. These names, as well as names of quantities  generally, require to be followed by \"da\", of, as \"dekduo da birdoj\", a  dozen (of) birds, but \"dekdu birdoj\", twelve birds; \"dudeko da pomoj\", a  score of apples; \"cento da sxafoj\", or \"cent sxafoj\", a hundred sheep;  \"milo da homoj\", a thousand people; \"miloj da homoj\", thousands of  people.    When these expressions form the object of the verb, it is the name of  the number which takes \"-n\", not the noun which follows \"da\", as \"Li  acxetis dudekon da sxafoj\", He bought a score of sheep.    For \"firstly, secondly\", etc., \"-e\" is added to the number, as \"unue\",  firstly; \"kvine\", fifthly; \"deke\", tenthly. (See Lesson 12).
