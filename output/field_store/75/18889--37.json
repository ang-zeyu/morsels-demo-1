The Communists are distinguished from the other working-class parties  by this only: (1) In the national struggles of the proletarians  of the different countries, they point out and bring to the front  the common interests of the entire proletariat, independently of  all nationality.  (2) In the various stages of development which the  struggle of the working class against the bourgeoisie has to pass  through, they always and everywhere represent the interests of the  movement as a whole.    The Communists, therefore, are on the one hand, practically,  the most advanced and resolute section of the working-class  parties of every country, that section which pushes forward  all others; on the other hand, theoretically, they have over  the great mass of the proletariat the advantage of clearly  understanding the line of march, the conditions, and the ultimate  general results of the proletarian movement.    The immediate aim of the Communist is the same as that of all  the other proletarian parties: formation of the proletariat into  a class, overthrow of the bourgeois supremacy, conquest of  political power by the proletariat.    The theoretical conclusions of the Communists are in no way  based on ideas or principles that have been invented, or  discovered, by this or that would-be universal reformer.  They  merely express, in general terms, actual relations springing from  an existing class struggle, from a historical movement going on  under our very eyes.  The abolition of existing property  relations is not at all a distinctive feature of Communism.    All property relations in the past have continually been subject  to historical change consequent upon the change in historical  conditions.    The French Revolution, for example, abolished feudal property in  favour of bourgeois property.    The distinguishing feature of Communism is not the abolition of  property generally, but the abolition of bourgeois property. But  modern bourgeois private property is the final and most complete  expression of the system of producing and appropriating products,  that is based on class antagonisms, on the exploitation of the  many by the few.    In this sense, the theory of the Communists may be summed up in  the single sentence: Abolition of private property.    We Communists have been reproached with the desire of abolishing  the right of personally acquiring property as the fruit of a  man's own labour, which property is alleged to be the groundwork  of all personal freedom, activity and independence.    Hard-won, self-acquired, self-earned property!  Do you mean the  property of the petty artisan and of the small peasant, a form of  property that preceded the bourgeois form?  There is no need to  abolish that; the development of industry has to a great extent  already destroyed it, and is still destroying it daily.    Or do you mean modern bourgeois private property?    But does wage-labour create any property for the labourer?  Not  a bit.  It creates capital, i.e., that kind of property which  exploits wage-labour, and which cannot increase except upon  condition of begetting a new supply of wage-labour for fresh  exploitation.  Property, in its present form, is based on the  antagonism of capital and wage-labour.  Let us examine both sides  of this antagonism.    To be a capitalist, is to have not only a purely personal, but a  social status in production.  Capital is a collective product,  and only by the united action of many members, nay, in the last  resort, only by the united action of all members of society,  can it be set in motion.    Capital is, therefore, not a personal, it is a social power.    When, therefore, capital is converted into common property, into  the property of all members of society, personal property is not  thereby transformed into social property. It is only the social  character of the property that is changed. It loses its  class-character.    Let us now take wage-labour.    The average price of wage-labour is the minimum wage, i.e.,  that quantum of the means of subsistence, which is absolutely  requisite in bare existence as a labourer.  What, therefore, the  wage-labourer appropriates by means of his labour, merely  suffices to prolong and reproduce a bare existence.  We by no  means intend to abolish this personal appropriation of the  products of labour, an appropriation that is made for the  maintenance and reproduction of human life, and that leaves no  surplus wherewith to command the labour of others.  All that we  want to do away with, is the miserable character of this  appropriation, under which the labourer lives merely to increase  capital, and is allowed to live only in so far as the interest of  the ruling class requires it.    In bourgeois society, living labour is but a means to increase  accumulated labour.  In Communist society, accumulated labour  is but a means to widen, to enrich, to promote the existence  of the labourer.    In bourgeois society, therefore, the past dominates the present;  in Communist society, the present dominates the past.  In  bourgeois society capital is independent and has individuality,  while the living person is dependent and has no individuality.    And the abolition of this state of things is called by the  bourgeois, abolition of individuality and freedom! And rightly  so. The abolition of bourgeois individuality, bourgeois  independence, and bourgeois freedom is undoubtedly aimed at.    By freedom is meant, under the present bourgeois conditions of  production, free trade, free selling and buying.    But if selling and buying disappears, free selling and buying  disappears also.  This talk about free selling and buying, and  all the other \"brave words\" of our bourgeoisie about freedom in  general, have a meaning, if any, only in contrast with restricted  selling and buying, with the fettered traders of the Middle Ages,  but have no meaning when opposed to the Communistic abolition of  buying and selling, of the bourgeois conditions of production,  and of the bourgeoisie itself.    You are horrified at our intending to do away with private  property.  But in your existing society, private property is  already done away with for nine-tenths of the population; its  existence for the few is solely due to its non-existence in the  hands of those nine-tenths.  You reproach us, therefore, with  intending to do away with a form of property, the necessary  condition for whose existence is the non-existence of any  property for the immense majority of society.    In one word, you reproach us with intending to do away with your  property.  Precisely so; that is just what we intend.    From the moment when labour can no longer be converted into  capital, money, or rent, into a social power capable of being  monopolised, i.e., from the moment when individual property can  no longer be transformed into bourgeois property, into capital,  from that moment, you say individuality vanishes.    You must, therefore, confess that by \"individual\" you mean no  other person than the bourgeois, than the middle-class owner of  property.  This person must, indeed, be swept out of the way, and  made impossible.    Communism deprives no man of the power to appropriate the  products of society; all that it does is to deprive him of the  power to subjugate the labour of others by means of such  appropriation.    It has been objected that upon the abolition of private property  all work will cease, and universal laziness will overtake us.    According to this, bourgeois society ought long ago to have gone  to the dogs through sheer idleness; for those of its members who  work, acquire nothing, and those who acquire anything, do not  work. The whole of this objection is but another expression of  the tautology: that there can no longer be any wage-labour when  there is no longer any capital.    All objections urged against the Communistic mode of producing  and appropriating material products, have, in the same way,  been urged against the Communistic modes of producing and  appropriating intellectual products.  Just as, to the bourgeois,  the disappearance of class property is the disappearance of  production itself, so the disappearance of class culture is to  him identical with the disappearance of all culture.    That culture, the loss of which he laments, is, for the enormous  majority, a mere training to act as a machine.    But don't wrangle with us so long as you apply, to our intended  abolition of bourgeois property, the standard of your bourgeois  notions of freedom, culture, law, etc.  Your very ideas are but  the outgrowth of the conditions of your bourgeois production and  bourgeois property, just as your jurisprudence is but the will of  your class made into a law for all, a will, whose essential  character and direction are determined by the economical  conditions of existence of your class.    The selfish misconception that induces you to transform into  eternal laws of nature and of reason, the social forms  springing from your present mode of production and form of  property--historical relations that rise and disappear in the  progress of production--this misconception you share with every  ruling class that has preceded you.  What you see clearly in the  case of ancient property, what you admit in the case of feudal  property, you are of course forbidden to admit in the case of  your own bourgeois form of property.    Abolition of the family!  Even the most radical flare up at this  infamous proposal of the Communists.    On what foundation is the present family, the bourgeois family,  based?  On capital, on private gain.  In its completely developed  form this family exists only among the bourgeoisie.  But this  state of things finds its complement in the practical absence of  the family among the proletarians, and in public prostitution.

In half an hour we reached Sumner itself, where we stopped for a  few moments to change horses. There is an inn and a village here,  where people from Christchurch come in the warm weather for sea-air and  bathing. It began to rain hard, and the rest of the journey, some seven  or eight miles, was disagreeable enough; but it was the _end_, and that  one thought was sufficient to keep us radiantly good-humoured, in spite  of all little trials. When we reached Christchurch, we drove at once to  a sort of boarding-house where we had engaged apartments, and thought of  nothing but supper and bed.    The next day people began calling, and certainly I cannot complain of  any coldness or want of welcome to my new home. I like what I have  seen of my future acquaintances very much. Of course there is a very  practical style and tone over everything, though outwardly the place is  as civilized as if it were a hundred years old; well-paved streets, gas  lamps, and even drinking fountains and pillar post-offices! I often find  myself wondering whether the ladies here are at all like what our great  grandmothers were. I suspect they are, for they appear to possess an  amount of useful practical knowledge which is quite astonishing, and  yet know how to surround themselves, according to their means and  opportunities, with the refinements and elegancies of life. I feel quite  ashamed of my own utter ignorance on every subject, and am determined  to set to work directly and learn: at all events I shall have plenty  of instructresses. Christchurch is a very pretty little town, still  primitive enough to be picturesque, and yet very thriving: capital  shops, where everything may be bought; churches, public buildings, a  very handsome club-house, etc. Most of the houses are of wood, but when  they are burned down (which is often the case) they are now rebuilt of  brick or stone, so that the new ones are nearly all of these more solid  materials. I am disappointed to find that, the cathedral, of which I  had heard so much, has not progressed beyond the foundations, which cost  8,000 pounds: all the works have been stopped, and certainly there  is not much to show for so large a sum, but labour is very dear.  Christchurch is a great deal more lively and bustling than most English  country towns, and I am much struck by the healthy appearance of the  people. There are no paupers to be seen; every one seems well fed and  well clothed; the children are really splendid. Of course, as might be  expected, there is a great deal of independence in bearing and manner,  especially among the servants, and I hear astounding stories concerning  them on all sides. My next letter will be from the country, as we have  accepted an invitation to pay a visit of six weeks or so to a station in  the north of the province.          Letter IV: First introduction to \"Station life.\"      Heathstock, Canterbury, November 13th, 1865. I have just had the  happiness of receiving my first budget of English letters; and no one  can imagine how a satisfactory home letter satisfies the hunger of  the heart after its loved and left ones. Your letter was particularly  pleasant, because I could perceive, as I held the paper in my hands,  that you were writing as you really felt, and that you were indeed  happy. May you long continue so, dearest.    F---- says that this beautiful place will give me a very erroneous  impression of station life, and that I shall probably expect to find its  comforts and luxuries the rule, whereas they are the exception; in the  mean time, however, I am enjoying them thoroughly. The house is only  sixty-five miles from Christchurch, nearly due north (which you must not  forget answers to your south in point of warmth). Our kind friends and  hosts, the L----s, called for us in their comfortable and large break,  with four horses. Mr. L---- drove, F---- sat on the box, and inside were  the ladies, children, and a nurse. Our first stage was to Kaiapoi, a  little town on the river Waimakiriri, where we had a good luncheon of  whitebait, and rested and fed the horses. From the window of the hotel I  saw a few groups of Maories; they looked very ugly and peaceable, with  a rude sort of basket made of flax fibres, or buckets filled with  whitebait, which they wanted us to buy. There are some reserved lands  near Kaiapoi where they have a very thriving settlement, living in  perfect peace and good-will with their white neighbours. When we set  off again on our journey, we passed a little school-house for their  children.    We reached Leathfield that evening, only twenty-five miles from  Christchurch; found a nice inn, or accommodation-house, as roadside inns  are called here; had a capital supper and comfortable beds, and were  up and off again at daylight the next morning. As far as the Weka Pass,  where we stopped for dinner, the roads were very good, but after that  we got more among the hills and off the usual track, and there were many  sharp turns and steep pinches; but Mr. L---- is an excellent whip, and  took great care of us. We all got very weary towards the end of this  second day's journey, and the last two hours of it were in heavy rain;  it was growing very dark when we reached the gate, and heard the welcome  sound of gravel under the wheels. I could just perceive that we had  entered a plantation, the first trees since we left Christchurch.  Nothing seems so wonderful to me as the utter treelessness of the vast  Canterbury plains; occasionally you pass a few Ti-ti palms (ordinarily  called cabbage-trees), or a large prickly bush which goes by the name of  \"wild Irishman,\" but for miles and miles you see nothing but flat ground  or slightly undulating downs of yellow tussocks, the tall native grass.  It has the colour and appearance of hay, but serves as shelter for a  delicious undergrowth of short sweet herbage, upon which the sheep live,  and horses also do very well on it, keeping in good working condition,  quite unlike their puffy, fat state on English pasture.    We drove through the plantation and another gate, and drew up at the  door of a very large, handsome, brick house, with projecting gables and  a verandah. The older I grow the more convinced I am that contrast is  everything in this world; and nothing I can write can give you any  idea of the delightful change from the bleak country we had been slowly  travelling through in pouring rain, to the warmth and brightness of this  charming house. There were blazing fires ready to welcome us, and I feel  sure you will sufficiently appreciate this fact when I tell you that  by the time the coal reaches this, it costs nine pounds per ton. It is  possible to get Australian coal at about half the price, but it is not  nearly as good.    We were so tired that we were only fit for the lowest phase of human  enjoyment--warmth, food, and sleep; but the next morning was bright and  lovely, and I was up and out in the verandah as early as possible. I  found myself saying constantly, in a sort of ecstasy, \"How I wish they  could see this in England!\" and not only see but feel it, for the very  breath one draws on such a morning is a happiness; the air is so light  and yet balmy, it seems to heal the lungs as you inhale it. The verandah  is covered with honeysuckles and other creepers, and the gable end of  the house where the bow-window of the drawing-room projects, is one  mass of yellow Banksia roses in full blossom. A stream runs through  the grounds, fringed with weeping willows, which are in their greatest  beauty at this time of year, with their soft, feathery foliage of  the tenderest green. The flower beds are dotted about the lawn, which  surrounds the house and slopes away from it, and they are brilliant  patches of colour, gay with verbenas, geraniums, and petunias. Here and  there clumps of tall trees rise above the shrubs, and as a background  there is a thick plantation of red and blue gums, to shelter the garden  from the strong N.W. winds. Then, in front, the country stretches away  in undulating downs to a chain of high hills in the distance: every now  and then there is a deep gap in these, through which you see magnificent  snow-covered mountains.    The inside of the house is as charming as the outside, and the  perfection of comfort; but I am perpetually wondering how all the  furniture--especially the fragile part of it--got here. When I remember  the jolts, and ruts, and roughnesses of the road, I find myself looking  at the pier-glass and glass shades, picture-frames, etc., with a sort of  respect, due to them for having survived so many dangers.    The first two or three days we enjoyed ourselves in a thoroughly lazy  manner; the garden was a never-ending source of delight, and there  were all the animals to make friends with, \"mobs\" of horses to look at,  rabbits, poultry, and pets of all sorts. About a week after our arrival,  some more gentlemen came, and then we had a series of picnics. As these  are quite unlike your highly civilized entertainments which go by the  same name, I must describe one to you.    The first thing after breakfast was to collect all the provisions,  and pack them in a sort of washing-basket, and then we started in an  American waggon drawn by a pair of stout cobs. We drove for some miles  till we came to the edge of one of the high terraces common to New  Zealand scenery: here we all got out; the gentlemen unharnessed and  tethered the horses, so that they could feed about comfortably, and  then we scrambled down the deep slope, at the bottom of which ran a  wide shallow creek. It was no easy matter to get the basket down here, I  assure you; we ladies were only permitted to load ourselves, one with a  little kettle, and the other with a tea-pot, but this was quite enough,  as crossing"]]]
