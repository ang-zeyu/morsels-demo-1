Katydids, crickets, and  grasshoppers all have antennae, and all of these have ears definitely  located; hence their feelers are not for auricular purposes.  According to my logic those of the moth cannot be either.  I am quite  sure that primarily they serve the purpose of a nose, as they  are too short in most cases to be of much use as 'feelers,' although  that is undoubtedly their secondary  office.  If this be true, it  explains the larger organs ofthe male.  The female emerges from  winter quarters so weighted with carrying from two to six hundred  eggs, that she usually remains and develops where she is.  This  throws the business of finding her location on the male.  He is  compelled to take wing and hunt until he discovers her; hence his  need of more acute sense of scent and touch.  The organ that is  used most is the one that develops in the evolution of any form  of life.    I can well believe that the antennae are most important to a moth,  for a broken one means a spoiled study for me.  It starts the  moth tremulously shivering, aimlessly beating, crazy, in fact,  and there is no hope of it posing for a picture.  Doctor Clemens  records that Cecropia could neither, walk nor fly, but wheeled in  a senseless, manner when deprived of its antennae.  This makes  me sure that they are the seat of highest sensibility, for I  have known in one or two cases of chloroformed moths reviving and  without struggle or apparent discomfort, depositing eggs in a  circle around them, while impaled to a setting board with a pin  thrust through the thorax where it of necessity must have passed  through or very close the nervous cord and heart.    The moth is covered completely with silken down like tiny scales,  coloured and marked according to species, and so lightly attached  that it adheres to the cocoon on emergence and clings to the  fingers at the lightest touch.  From the examination of specimens  I have taken that had disfigured themselves, it appears that a moth  rubbed bare of down would seem as if covered with thinly cut, highly  polished horn, fastened together in divisions.  This is called  'chitine' by scientists.    The thorax bears four wings, and six legs, each having five joints  and ending in tiny claws.  The wings are many-veined membranous  sacs, covered with scales that are coloured according to species  and arranged to form characteristic family markings.  They are a  framework usually of twelve hollow tubes or veins that are so  connected with the respiratory organs as to be pneumatic.  These  tubes support double membranes covered above and below with down.  At the bases of the wings lie their nerves.  The fore-wings each  have a heavy rib running from the base and gradually decreasing  to the tip.  This is called the costa.  Its purpose is to bear  the brunt of air-pressure in flight.  On account of being compelled  to fly so much more than the females, the back wings of the males  of many species have developed a secondary rib that fits under  and supports the front, also causing both to work together with  the same impulse to flight.  A stiff bunch of bristles serves the  same purpose in most females, while some have a lobe extending  from the fore-wing.  As long as the costa remains unbroken to  preserve balance, a moth that has become entangled in bushes  or suffered rough treatment from birds can fly  with badly  damaged wing surfaces.    In some species, notably the Attacine group and all non-feeding,  night-flying moths, the legs are short, closely covered with long  down of the most delicate colours of the moth, and sometimes  decorated with different shades.  Luna has beautiful lavender legs,  Imperialis yellow, and Regalis red-brown.  The day-flying, feeding  group have longer, slenderer legs, covered with shorter down, and  carry more elaborate markings.  This provision is to enable them  to cling firmly to flower or twig while feeding, to help them to  lift the body higher, and walk dextrously in searching for food.  It is also noticeable that these moths have, for their size,  comparatively much longer, slenderer wings than the non-feeders,  and they can turn them back and fold them together in the fly  position, thus enabling them to force their way into nectar-bearing  flowers of trumpet shape.    The abdomen is velvet soft to the touch, and divided into rings  called segments, these being so joined that this member can be  turned and twisted at will.  In all cases the last ring contains  the sex organs.  The large abdomen of the female carries several  hundred embryo eggs, and that of the male the seminal fluid.    Much has been written of moths being able to produce odours that  attract the sexes, and that are so objectionable as to protect  them from birds, mice, and bats.  Some believe there are scent  glands in a few species under the wing scales.  I have critically  examined scores of wings as to colour markings, but never  noticed or smelled these.  On some, tufts of bristlelike hairs can  be thrust out, that give a discernible odour; but that this  carries any distance or is a large factor in attracting the sexes  I do not believe so firmly, after years of practical experience, as  I did in the days when I had most of my moth history from books.  I have seen this theory confounded so often in practice.    In June of 1911, close six o'clock in the evening, I sat on the  front veranda of the Cabin, in company with my family, and  watched three moths sail past us and around the corner, before  I remembered that on the screen of the music-room window to the  east there was a solitary female Promethea moth, that day emerged  from a cocoon sent me by Professor Rowley.  I hurried to the room  and found five male moths fluttering before the screen or clinging  to the wild grape and sweet brier vines covering it.  I opened the  adjoining window and picked up three of the handsomest with my  fingers, placing them inside the screen.  Then I returned to  the veranda.    Moths kept coming.  We began studying the conditions.  The  female had emerged in the diningroom on the west side of the  cabin.  On account of the intense heat of the afternoon sun, that  side of the building had been tightly closed all day.  At four  o'clock the moth was placed on the east window, because it was  sheltered with vines.  How soon the first male found her, I do not  know.  There was quite a stiff evening breeze blowing from the  west, so that any odour from her would have been carried on east.  We sat there and watched and counted six more moths, every one of  which came down wind from the west, flying high, above the  treetops in fact, and from the direction of a little tree-filled  plot called Studabaker's woods.  Some of them we could distinguish  almost a block away coming straight toward the Cabin, and sailing  around the eastern corner with the precision of hounds on a hot trail.  How they knew, the Almighty  knows; I do not pretend to; but  that there was odour distilled by that one female, practically  imperceptible to us (she merely smelled like a moth), yet of such  strength as to penetrate screen, vines, and roses and reach her  kind a block away, against considerable breeze, I never shall  believe.    The fact is, that moths smell like other moths of the same species,  and within a reasonable radius they undoubtedly  attract each  other.  In the same manner birds carry a birdlike odour, and  snakes, frogs, fish, bees, and all animals have a scent peculiar  to themselves.  No dog mistakes the odour of a cat for that of  another dog.  A cow does not follow the scent of horses to find  other cattle.  No moth hunts a dragon-fly, a butterfly, or in my  experience, even a moth of another species in its search for a  mate.  How male moths work the miracles I have seen them accomplish  in locating females, I cannot explain.  As the result of acts we  see them perform, we credit some forms of life with much keener  scent than others, and many with having the power more highly  developed than people.  The only standard by which we can determine  the effect that the odour of one insect, bird, or animal has upon  another is by the effect it has upon us.  That a male moth can  smell a female a block away, against the wind, when I can detect  only a faint musky odour within a foot of her, I do not credit.    Primarily the business of moths is to meet, mate, and deposit  eggs that will produce more moths.  This is all of life with those  that do not take food.  That they add the completing touch and  most beautiful form of life to a few exquisite May and June nights  is their extra good fortune, not any part of the affair of living.  With moths that feed and live after reproduction, mating and egg  placing comes first.  In all cases the rule is much, the same.  The  moths emerge, dry their wings, and reach full development the  first day.  In freedom, the females being weighted with eggs seldom  attempt to fly.  They remain where they are, thrust out the egg  placer from the last ring of the abdomen and wait.  By ten o'clock  the males, in such numbers as to amaze a watcher, find them  and remain until almost morning.  Broad antennae, slenderer  abdomen, and the claspers used in holding the female in mating,  smaller wings and more brilliant markings are the signs by which  the male can be told in most cases.  In several of the Attacine  group, notably Promethea, the male and female differ widely in  markings and colour.  Among the other non-feeders the difference  is slight.  The male Regalis has the longest, most gracefully  curved abdomen and the most prominent claspers of any moth I ever  examined; but the antennae are so delicate and closely pressed  against the face most of the time as to be concealed until  especially  examined.  I have noticed that among the moths"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4908"],[0,"Five of Maxwell's Papers (#4)"],[1,"to experimental  investigation; and by this theory nearly every known mechanical  property of gases has been explained on dynamical principles; so that  the properties of individual gaseous molecules are in a fair way to  become objects of scientific research.    Now Mr Stoney has pointed out[1] that the numerical results of  experiments on gases render it probable that the mean distance of  their particles at the ordinary temperature and pressure is a quantity  of the same order of magnitude as a millionth of a millimetre, and Sir  William Thomson has since[2] shewn, by several independent lines of  argument, drawn from phenomena so different in themselves as the  electrification of metals by contact, the tension of soap-bubbles, and  the friction of air, that in ordinary solids and liquids the average  distance between contiguous molecules is less than the  hundred-millionth, and greater than the two-thousand-millionth of a  centimetre.    [1] _Phil. Mag._, Aug. 1868.  [2] _Nature_, March 31, 1870.    These, of course, are exceedingly rough estimates, for they are  derived from measurements some of which are still confessedly very  rough; but if at the present time, we can form even a rough plan for  arriving at results of this kind, we may hope that, as our means of  experimental inquiry become more accurate and more varied, our  conception of a molecule will become more definite, so that we may be  able at no distant period to estimate its weight with a greater degree  of precision.    A theory, which Sir W. Thomson has founded on Helmholtz's splendid  hydrodynamical theorems, seeks for the properties of molecules in the  ring vortices of a uniform, frictionless, incompressible fluid.  Such  whirling rings may be seen when an experienced smoker sends out a  dexterous puff of smoke into the still air, but a more evanescent  phenomenon it is difficult to conceive.  This evanescence is owing to  the viscosity of the air; but Helmholtz has shewn that in a perfect  fluid such a whirling ring, if once generated, would go on whirling  for ever, would always consist of the very same portion of the fluid  which was first set whirling, and could never be cut in two by any  natural cause.  The generation of a ring-vortex is of course equally  beyond the power of natural causes, but once generated, it has the  properties of individuality, permanence in quantity, and  indestructibility.  It is also the recipient of impulse and of energy,  which is all we can affirm of matter; and these ring-vortices are  capable of such varied connexions and knotted self-involutions, that  the properties of differently knotted vortices must be as different as  those of different kinds of molecules can be.    If a theory of this kind should be found, after conquering the  enormous mathematical difficulties of the subject, to represent in any  degree the actual properties of molecules, it will stand in a very  different scientific position from those theories of molecular action  which are formed by investing the molecule with an arbitrary system of  central forces invented expressly to account for the observed  phenomena.    In the vortex theory we have nothing arbitrary, no central forces or  occult properties of any other kind.  We have nothing but matter and  motion, and when the vortex is once started its properties are all  determined from the original impetus, and no further assumptions are  possible.    Even in the present undeveloped state of the theory, the contemplation  of the individuality and indestructibility of a ring-vortex in a  perfect fluid cannot fail to disturb the commonly received opinion  that a molecule, in order to be permanent, must be a very hard body.    In fact one of the first conditions which a molecule must fulfil is,  apparently, inconsistent with its being a single hard body.  We know  from those spectroscopic researches which have thrown so much light on  different branches of science, that a molecule can be set into a state  of internal vibration, in which it gives off to the surrounding medium  light of definite refrangibility--light, that is, of definite  wave-length and definite period of vibration.  The fact that all the  molecules (say, of hydrogen) which we can procure for our experiments,  when agitated by heat or by the passage of an electric spark, vibrate  precisely in the same periodic time, or, to speak more accurately,  that their vibrations are composed of a system of simple vibrations  having always the same periods, is a very remarkable fact.    I must leave it to others to describe the progress of that splendid  series of spectroscopic discoveries by which the chemistry of the  heavenly bodies has been brought within the range of human inquiry.  I  wish rather to direct your attention to the fact that, not only has  every molecule of terrestrial hydrogen the same system of periods of  free vibration, but that the spectroscopic examination of the light of  the sun and stars shews that, in regions the distance of which we can  only feebly imagine, there are molecules vibrating in as exact unison  with the molecules of terrestrial hydrogen as two tuning-forks tuned  to concert pitch, or two watches regulated to solar time.    Now this absolute equality in the magnitude of quantities, occurring  in all parts of the universe, is worth our consideration.    The dimensions of individual natural bodies are either quite  indeterminate, as in the case of planets, stones, trees, &c., or they  vary within moderate limits, as in the case of seeds, eggs, &c.; but  even in these cases small quantitative differences are met with which  do not interfere with the essential properties of the body.    Even crystals, which are so definite in geometrical form, are variable  with respect to their absolute dimensions.    Among the works of man we sometimes find a certain degree of  uniformity.    There is a uniformity among the different bullets which are cast in  the same mould, and the different copies of a book printed from the  same type.    If we examine the coins, or the weights and measures, of a civilized  country, we find a uniformity, which is produced by careful adjustment  to standards made and provided by the state.  The degree of uniformity  of these national standards is a measure of that spirit of justice in  the nation which has enacted laws to regulate them and appointed  officers to test them.    This subject is one in which we, as a scientific body, take a warm  interest; and you are all aware of the vast amount of scientific work  which has been expended, and profitably expended, in providing weights  and measures for commercial and scientific purposes.    The earth has been measured as a basis for a permanent standard of  length, and every property of metals has been investigated to guard  against any alteration of the material standards when made.  To weigh  or measure any thing with modern accuracy, requires a course of  experiment and calculation in which almost every branch of physics and  mathematics is brought into requisition.    Yet, after all, the dimensions of our earth and its time of rotation,  though, relatively to our present means of comparison, very permanent,  are not so by any physical necessity.  The earth might contract by  cooling, or it might be enlarged by a layer of meteorites falling on  it, or its rate of revolution might slowly slacken, and yet it would  continue to be as much a planet as before.    But a molecule, say of hydrogen, if either its mass or its time of  vibration were to be altered in the least, would no longer be a  molecule of hydrogen.    If, then, we wish to obtain standards of length, time, and mass which  shall be absolutely permanent, we must seek them not in the  dimensions, or the motion, or the mass of our planet, but in the  wave-length, the period of vibration, and the absolute mass of these  imperishable and unalterable and perfectly similar molecules.    When we find that here, and in the starry heavens, there are  innumerable multitudes of little bodies of exactly the same mass, so  many, and no more, to the grain, and vibrating in exactly the same  time, so many times, and no more, in a second, and when we reflect  that no power in nature can now alter in the least either the mass or  the period of any one of them, we seem to have advanced along the path  of natural knowledge to one of those points at which we must accept  the guidance of that faith by which we understand that \"that which is  seen was not made of things which do appear.\"    One of the most remarkable results of the progress of molecular  science is the light it has thrown on the nature of irreversible  processes--processes, that is, which always tend towards and never  away from a certain limiting state.  Thus, if two gases be put into  the same vessel, they become mixed, and the mixture tends continually  to become more uniform.  If two unequally heated portions of the same  gas are put into the vessel, something of the kind takes place, and  the whole tends to become of the same temperature.  If two unequally  heated solid bodies be placed in contact, a continual approximation of  both to an intermediate temperature takes place.    In the case of the two gases, a separation may be effected by chemical  means; but in the other two cases the former state of things cannot be  restored by any natural process.    In the case of the conduction or diffusion of heat the process is not  only irreversible, but it involves the irreversible diminution of that  part of the whole stock of thermal energy which is capable of being  converted into mechanical work.    This is Thomson's theory of the irreversible dissipation of energy,  and it is equivalent to the doctrine of Clausius concerning the growth  of what he calls Entropy.    The irreversible character of this process is strikingly embodied in  Fourier's theory of the conduction of heat, where the formulae"]]]
