Doesn't he owe a duty to the public the  same as any other witness? If he is innocent he has nothing to fear; if  he is guilty--away with him! The French have no false ideas about such  things and at the same time they have a high regard for liberty. We  merely cheat ourselves into thinking that our liberty is something  different from French liberty because we have a lot of laws upon our  statute books that are there only to be disregarded and would have to be  repealed instantly if enforced.    Take, for instance, the celebrated provision of the penal laws that the  failure of an accused to testify in his own behalf shall not be taken  against him. Such a doctrine flies in the face of human nature. If a  man sits silent when witnesses under oath accuse him of a crime it is an  inevitable inference that he has nothing to say--that no explanation of  his would explain. The records show that the vast majority of accused  persons who do not avail themselves of the opportunity to testify are  convicted. Thus, the law which permits a defendant to testify in reality  compels him to testify, and a much-invoked safeguard of liberty turns  out to be a privilege in name only. In France or America alike a man  accused of crime sooner or later has to tell what he knows--or take  his medicine. It makes little difference whether he does so under the  legalized interrogation of a \"juge d'instruction\" in Paris or under the  quasi-voluntary examination of an assistant district attorney or police  inspector in New York. It is six of one and half a dozen of the other if  at his trial in France he remains mute under examination or in America  refrains from availing himself of the privilege of testifying in his own  behalf.    Thus, we are reluctantly forced to the conclusion that all human  institutions have their limitations, and that, however theoretically  perfect a government of laws may be, it must be administered by men  whose chief regard will not be the idealization of a theory of liberty  so much as an immediate solution of some concrete problem.    Not that the matter, after all, is particularly important to most of us,  but laws which exist only to be broken create a disrespect and disregard  for law which may ultimately be dangerous. It would be perfectly simple  for the legislature to say that a citizen might be arrested under  circumstances tending to create a reasonable suspicion, even if he had  not committed a crime, and it would be quite easy to pass a statute  providing that the commissioner of police might \"mug\" and measure all  criminals immediately after conviction. As it is, the prison authorities  won't let him, so he has to do it while he has the opportunity.    It must be admitted that this is rather hard on the innocent, but they  now have to suffer with the guilty for the sins of an indolent and  uninterested legislature. Moreover, if such a right of arrest were  proposed, some wiseacre or politician would probably rise up and  denounce the suggestion as the first step in the direction of a military  dictatorship. Thus, we shall undoubtedly fare happily on in the  blissful belief that our personal liberties are the subject of the most  solicitous and zealous care on the part of the authorities, guaranteed  to us under a government which is not of men but of laws, until one  of us happens to be arrested (by mistake, of course) and learns by sad  experience the practical methods of the police in dealing with criminals  and the agreeable but deceptive character of the pleasant fiction of the  presumption of innocence.          CHAPTER II. Preparing a Criminal Case for Trial      When the prosecuting attorney in a great criminal trial arises to open  the case to the impanelled jury, very few, if any, of them have the  slightest conception of the enormous expenditure of time, thought and  labor which has gone into the preparation of the case and made possible  his brief and easily delivered speech. For in this opening address of  his there must be no flaw, since a single misstated or overstated fact  may prejudice the jury against him and result in his defeat. Upon  it also depends the jury's first impression of the case and of the  prosecutor himself--no inconsiderable factor in the result. In a trial  of importance its careful construction with due regard to what facts  shall be omitted (in order to enhance their dramatic effect when  ultimately proven) may well occupy the district attorney every evening  for a week. But if the speech itself has involved study and travail, it  is as nothing compared with the amount required by that most important  feature of every criminal case--the selection of the jury.    For a month before the trial, or whenever it may be that the jury has  been drawn, every member upon the panel has been subjected to an unseen  scrutiny. The prosecutor, through his own or through hired sleuths, has  examined into the family history, the business standing and methods, the  financial responsibility, the political and social affiliations, and the  personal habits and \"past performances\" of each and every talesman. When  at the beginning of the trial they, one by one, take the witness-chair  (on what is called the voir dire) to subject themselves to an  examination by both sides as to their fitness to serve as jurors in  the case, the district attorney probably has close fit hand a rather  detailed account of each, and perchance has great difficulty in  restraining a smile. When some prospective juror, in his eagerness  either to serve or to escape, deliberately equivocates in answer to an  important question as to his personal history.    \"Are you acquainted with the accused or his family?\" mildly inquires the  assistant prosecutor. \"No--not at all,\" the talesman may blandly reply.    The answer, perhaps, is literally true, and yet the prosecutor may be  pardoned for murmuring    \"Liar!\" to himself as he sees that his memorandum concerning the juror's  qualifications states that he belongs to the same \"lodge\" with the  prisoner's uncle by marriage and carries an open account on his books  with the defendant's father.    \"I think we will excuse Mr. Ananias,\" politely remarks the prosecutor;  then in an undertone he turns to his chief and mutters: \"The old rascal!  He would have knifed us if we'd given him the chance!\" And all this time  the disgruntled Mr. Ananias is wondering why, if he didn't \"know the  defendant or his family,\" he was not accepted as a juror.    Of course, every district attorney has, or should have, information as  to each talesman's actual capabilities as a juror and something of  a record as to how he has acted under fire. If he is a member of the  \"special\" panel, it is easy to find out whether he has ever acquitted  or convicted in any cause celebre, and if he has acquitted any plainly  guilty defendant in the past it is not likely that his services will  be required. If, however, he has convicted in such a case the district  attorney may try to lure the other side into accepting him by making  it appear that he himself is doubtful as to the juror's desirability.  Sometimes persons accused of crime themselves, and actually under  indictment, find their way onto the panels, and more than one ex-convict  has appeared there in some inexplicable fashion. But to find them out  may well require a double shift of men working day and night for a month  before the case is called, and what may appear to be the most trivial  fact thus discovered may in the end prove the decisive argument for or  against accepting the juror.    Panel after panel may be exhausted before a jury in a great murder  trial has been selected, for each side in addition to its challenges  for \"cause\" or \"bias\" has thirty* peremptory ones which it may exercise  arbitrarily. If the writer's recollection is not at fault, the large  original panel drawn in the first Molineux trial was used up and  several others had to be drawn until eight hundred talesmen had been  interrogated before the jury was finally selected. It is usual to  examine at least fifty in the ordinary murder case before a jury is  secured.             * In the State of New York.      It may seem to the reader that this scrutiny of talesmen is not strictly  preparation for the trial, but, in fact, it is fully as important  as getting ready the facts themselves; for a poor jury, either from  ignorance or prejudice, will acquit on the same facts which will lead  a sound jury to convict. A famous prosecutor used to say, \"Get your  jury--the case will take care of itself.\"    But as the examination of the panel and the opening address come last  in point of chronology it will be well to begin at the beginning and  see what the labors of the prosecutor are in the initial stages of  preparation. Let us take, for example, some notorious case, where an  unfortunate victim has died from the effects of a poisoned pill or  draught of medicine, or has been found dead in his room with a revolver  bullet in his heart. Some time before the matter has come into the hands  of the prosecutor, the press and the police have generally been doing  more or less (usually less) effective work upon the case. The yellow  journals have evolved some theory of who is the culprit and have loosed  their respective reporters and \"special criminologists\" upon him. Each  has its own idea and its own methods--often unscrupulous. And each has  its own particular victim upon whom it intends to fasten the blame.  Heaven save his reputation! Many an innocent man has been ruined for  life through the efforts of a newspaper \"to make a case,\" and, of  course, the same thing, though happily in a lesser degree, is true of  the police and of some prosecutors as well.    In every great criminal case there are always four different and  frequently antagonistic elements engaged in the work of detection and  prosecution--fir"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/52819"],[0,"Defense of the Faith and the Saints (Volume 2 of 2) (#4)"],[1,"are found in the Oberlin  manuscript, which further evidences that it is not the manuscript of  which the witnesses testified, and which Patterson says was submitted  to him. The Oberlin manuscript also furnishes internal evidences of  an improbability that it was ever submitted to a publisher by any man  as sane and well educated as was Spaulding. The plot of the story is  incomplete, and the manuscript is full of interlineations, alterations,  careless or phonetic spelling, and misused capital letters. These are  all easily explainable consistently with Spaulding's erudition, if  we view the manuscript as a hasty and careless blocking out of his  literary work, but it is not in such a condition as would make him  willing to submit it to a publisher.    [Footnote 21: \"The Spaulding Story Examined and Exposed,\" by John E.  Page, 7; \"Who wrote the Book of Mormon?\" 7; \"Mormonism Exposed,\" by  Williams.]    If we bear in mind that from the beginning it was asserted that this  manuscript now at Oberlin was not the one from which the Book of Mormon  was alleged to have been plagiarized, then President Fairchild's  conclusion that it disproves such plagiarism of course becomes absurd  and only demonstrates his ignorance of the early testimony upon  which was asserted the connection of the Book of Mormon and another  manuscript. This also disposes of the Mormon argument most frequently  urged against the theory here advocated.    Either through like ignorance of the evidence of 1834 that this was not  the manuscript then being testified about, or through a willingness to  play upon the ignorance of others, the two leading sects of Mormons  have published this first manuscript as a refutation of a theory which  no one ever advocated, viz.: That the manuscript now at Oberlin was  the thing from which Smith _et al._ plagiarized the Book of Mormon. In  my judgment, the publication of this first incomplete manuscript story  furnishes additional evidence that the rewritten story did constitute  the foundation of the Book of Mormon. When we remember what was said  in 1834 as to the character of changes made in rewriting, and that  the rewritten story was revamped by Smith, Rigdon and Company, we are  astonished at the number of similarities retained; as, for instance,  the finding of the story in a stone box, its translation into English,  the attempt to account for a portion of the population of this  continent, the wars of extermination of two factions, the impossible  slaughters of primitive warfare, and the physically impossible armies  which were gathered without modern facilities of either transportation  or the furnishing of supplies--the fact that after two rewritings, the  second being by new authors, there should remain these very unusual  features, makes the discovery and publication of this first manuscript  only an additional evidence that the second one did furnish the basis  of the Book of Mormon.    By always remembering these separate manuscripts and their different  histories, much seeming conflict of evidence can be explained, mistaken  conclusions accounted for, and confusion avoided. The Mormons, in  their publication of this first manuscript story, have labeled it  \"The Manuscript Found,\" though no such title is discoverable anywhere  upon or in the body of the manuscript in the Oberlin library. [22] The  evident purpose of this is to further confound that first story with  the second or rewritten manuscript which it will be demonstrated really  was used in constructing the Book of Mormon, and which manuscript  the witnesses to be hereafter introduced described by that title.  Having traced to its final resting-place at Oberlin College the first  manuscript story, which had no direct connection with the Book of  Mormon and never was claimed to have such, let us now, if we can, trace  into the Book of Mormon Spaulding's rewritten story, entitled \"The  Manuscript Found.\"    [Footnote 22: xxxv. _Saints' Herald,_ 130; \"Prophet of Palmyra,\" 459.]    SPAULDING'S REWRITTEN MANUSCRIPT.    Spaulding commenced his writing about 1809, changing his plans while  still at Conneaut, that is, prior to 1812, [23] at which later date the  rewritten story of \"The Manuscript Found\" was still incomplete. [24]  In 1812 Spaulding borrowed some money with which to go to Pittsburg,  hoping there to get his novel published and thus make it possible  for him to pay his debts. [25] In Pittsburg Spaulding submitted his  manuscript to one Robert Patterson, then engaged in the publishing  business. [26] The exact date is not known but it is probable almost to  certainty that Spaulding would do this immediately upon his arrival  in Pittsburg in 1812, since that was one of his definite purposes in  going there. Spaulding's widow is reported as saying: \"At length the  manuscript was returned to the author, and soon after we removed to  Amity, Washington County, Pa.\" [27] The return of the manuscript before  1814, the date of the removal to Amity, is made additionally certain  by the testimony of Redick McKee [28] and Joseph Miller. [29] This  additional evidence, especially that of the latter, makes it plain that  Spaulding had his rewritten manuscript at Amity, thus demonstrating its  return to Spaulding before the latter's removal from Pittsburg. The  evidences of identity between the manuscript testified about as being  at Amity, and Spaulding's rewritten story, leave no doubt. The review  of this evidence of identity will be postponed until we come to review  the other evidences of identity between \"The Manuscript Found\" and the  Book of Mormon.    [Footnote 23: Howe's \"Mormonism Unveiled,\" 288.]    [Footnote 24: Howe's \"Mormonism Unveiled,\" 283.]    [Footnote 25: Howe's \"Mormonism Unveiled,\" 282-3.]    [Footnote 26: \"New Light on Mormonism,\" 16-17; \"History of the  Mormons,\" 43; \"Who Wrote the Book of Mormon?\" 7.]    [Footnote 27: \"Gleanings by the Way,\" 252; \"Mormons' Own Book,\" 29;  \"Prophet of Palmyra,\" 419; \"History of the Mormons,\" 43.]    [Footnote 28: Washington (Pa.) _Reporter_ of April 21, 1869; \"Who Wrote  the Book of Mormon?\" 6.]    It is said that Patterson returned the manuscript to Spaulding with  the advice to \"polish it up, finish it, and you will make money out  of it.\" [30] On behalf of Patterson it has been said that he directed  its return unless the author would furnish ample security to guarantee  the expense of publishing, which we can readily believe to have been  impossible to the impecunious Spaulding. [31]    [Footnote 30: \"New Light on Mormonism,\" 238; _Magazine American  History,_ June, 1882; _Scribner's Monthly,_ August, 1880; \"Prophet of  Palmyra,\" 423.]    [Footnote 31: \"Mormonism Exposed,\" by Williams, 16; \"Prophet of  Palmyra,\" 455; \"The Spaulding Story Examined and Exposed,\" by John E.  Page, 7.]    After residing in Pittsburg two years, [32] the Spauldings moved to  Amity in Washington County, Pa., where Solomon Spaulding and his  returned \"Manuscript Found\" again became the center of attraction  among the commonplace neighborhood listeners, who did their loafing  about the Spaulding tavern. [33] Here the story was polished and  finished, [34] and from Amity Spaulding again journeyed to Pittsburg,  in the hope in the second attempt of securing the publication of his  story, \"The Manuscript Found.\" [35] Spaulding's widow and daughter  assert that at one time Patterson advised Spaulding \"to make out a  title-page and preface.\" [36] That remark would seem most likely to  have been made after the finishing of the story, and I therefore feel  justified in believing it to have been made after the second submission  of the manuscript. Mrs. Spaulding-Davidson says this request was  never complied with, but for reasons which are unknown to her. In the  light of evidence to be hereafter reviewed, we are justified in an  inference that one of the causes was a theft of the manuscript from the  publisher's office, followed, perhaps, within a few weeks or months, by  the death of Spaulding, which occurred in October, 1816.    [Footnote 32: Howe's \"Mormonism Unveiled,\" 287; \"Who Wrote the Book of  Mormon?\" 7.]    [Footnote 33: \"Prophet of Palmyra,\" 441, 442.]    [Footnote 34: Reddick McKee in Washington (Pa.) _Reporter_, April 12,  1869; \"Who Wrote the Book of Mormon?\" 6.]    [Footnote 35: \"Prophet of Palmyra,\" 442-55.]    [Footnote 36: \"Prophet of Palmyra,\" 419-42; iii. _Millennial  Harbinger_, about May 1839; Boston _Recorder_ during May 1839;  \"Mormons' Own Book,\" 29.]    ERRONEOUS THEORIES EXAMINED.    It has been a theory among some that Joseph Smith himself secured the  Spaulding manuscript from the house of William H. Sabine of Onondaga  Valley, N.Y., for whom Smith worked as a teamster in 1823. [37]  According to another theory, Sidney Rigdon, while the \"Manuscript  Found\" was at the printing office, copied it, the original being  returned to Spaulding. A third theory supposes Smith to have copied  it while working for Sabine about 1823, leaving the original there. A  fourth theory makes Spaulding copy his story for the publisher while  keeping the duplicate at home to be afterward cared for by the family.  Under all of these theories, the original of Spaulding's rewritten  story was delivered in 1833 to D. P. Hurlburt to be used by E. D. Howe  in his then forthcoming book, \"Mormonism Unveiled,\" but, according  to the Spaulding family, was by Hurlburt sold to the Mormons, and,  according to the Mormons, destroyed by Hurlburt because wholly unlike  the Book of Mormon. These theories can claim for themselves no greater  weight than that, in the opinion of their several non-Mormon advocates,  they furnish a possible explanation as to the connecting link between  Spaulding and Smith, but upon all essentials, except one, are without  any evidence which involves the conclusion deduced from it, and not one  of these theories is necessary as an explanation for the established  facts.
