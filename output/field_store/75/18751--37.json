[11] See Note 3.    =10. His Parentage and Youth.=--Joseph Smith, the third son and fourth  child in a family of ten, was born December 23d, 1805, at Sharon,  Windsor County, Vermont. He was the son of Joseph and Lucy Mack  Smith--a worthy couple, who though in poverty lived happily amid  their home scenes of industry and frugality. When the boy, Joseph, was  ten years old, the family left Vermont and settled in the State of New  York, first at Palmyra, and later at Manchester, Ontario County. At  the place last named, the future prophet spent most of his boyhood  days. In common with his brothers and sisters, he had but little  schooling; and for the simple rudiments of an education, which by  earnest application he was able to gain, he was mostly indebted to his  parents, who followed the rule of devoting a portion of their limited  leisure to the teaching of the younger members of the household.    =11.= In their religious inclinations, the family favored the  Presbyterian church, the mother and three or four of the children  having united themselves with that sect; but Joseph, while at one time  favorably impressed by the Methodist creed, kept himself free from all  sectarian membership, being greatly perplexed over the strife and  dissensions manifesting themselves among the churches of the time. He  had a right to expect that in the Church of Christ there would be  unity and harmony; yet in place of such he saw among the wrangling  sects only confusion. When Joseph was in his fifteenth year, the  region of his home was visited by a storm of fierce religious  excitement, which, beginning with the Methodists, soon became general  among all the sects; there were revivals and protracted meetings, and  the manifestations of sectarian rivalry were many and varied. These  conditions added much to the distress of the young searcher after  truth.    =12. His Search for Truth and the Result.=--Here is Joseph's own  account of his course of action:--         \"In the midst of this war of words and tumult of opinions, I       often said to myself, what is to be done? who of all these       parties are right? or, are they all wrong together? If any one       of them be right, which is it, and how shall I know it?         \"While I was laboring under the extreme difficulties caused by       the contests of these parties of religionists, I was one day       reading the Epistle of James, first chapter and fifth verse,       which reads, '_If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God,       that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it       shall be given him._'[12] Never did any passage of scripture come       with more power to the heart of man than did this at this time to       mine. It seemed to enter with great force into every feeling of       my heart. I reflected on it again and again, knowing that if any       person needed wisdom from God, I did; for how to act I did not       know, and unless I could get more wisdom than I then had, would       never know, for the teachers of religion of the different sects       understood the same passage so differently as to destroy all       confidence in settling the question by an appeal to the Bible. At       length I came to the conclusion that I must either remain in       darkness and confusion, or else I must do as James directs, that       is, ask of God. I at length came to the determination to ask of       God, concluding that if He gave wisdom to them that lacked       wisdom, and would give liberally and not upbraid, I might       venture. So, in accordance with this my determination to ask of       God, I retired to the woods to make the attempt. It was on the       morning of a beautiful clear day, early in the spring of 1820. It       was the first time in my life that I had made such an attempt,       for amidst all my anxieties I had never as yet made the attempt       to pray vocally.      [12] James i, 5.    \"After I had retired to the place where I had previously designed to  go, having looked around me and finding myself alone, I kneeled down  and began to offer up the desires of my heart to God. I had scarcely  done so, when immediately I was seized upon by some power which  entirely overcame me, and had such astonishing influence over me as to  bind my tongue so that I could not speak. Thick darkness gathered  around me, and it seemed to me, for a time, as if I were doomed to  sudden destruction. But, exerting all my powers to call upon God to  deliver me out of the power of this enemy which had seized upon me,  and at the very moment when I was ready to sink into despair and  abandon myself to destruction, not to an imaginary ruin, but to the  power of some actual being from the unseen world, who had such a  marvelous power as I had never before felt in any being; just at this  moment of great alarm, I saw a pillar of light exactly above my head,  above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it  fell upon me. It no sooner appeared than I found myself delivered from  the enemy which held me bound. When the light rested upon me, I saw  two personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description,  standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me calling me by  name, and said (pointing to the other), '_This is my beloved Son, hear  Him._'\"[13]      [13] Pearl of Great Price: Extr. Hist. of Jos. Smith, 10-17.    =13.= In answer to his prayer for guidance as to which of the sects  was right, he was told to join none of them, for all were wrong, with  their creeds which are an abomination in the sight of God, and their  professors who are corrupt, in that they draw near with their lips  while their hearts are far from the Lord, teaching for doctrine the  commandments of men, having a form of godliness while denying the  power thereof.    =14.= Such knowledge as has been communicated in this unprecedented  revelation was not to be held secret within the heart of the youth. He  hesitated not to impart the glorious truths, first to the members of  his family, who received his testimony with reverence, and then to the  sectarian ministers, who had labored so diligently to convert him to  their several creeds. To his surprise, these professed teachers of  Christ treated his statements with the utmost contempt, declaring that  the day of revelation from God had long since passed away; and that  the manifestation, if indeed he had received any such at all, was  surely from Satan. Nevertheless, the ministers exerted themselves,  with a unity of purpose strangely at variance with their former  hostility toward one another, to ridicule the young man, and to  denounce his testimony. The neighborhood was aroused; persecution,  bitter and vindictive, was waged against him and his family; he was  actually fired upon by a would-be assassin: yet through it all he was  preserved from bodily injury; and in spite of increasing opposition he  remained faithfully steadfast to his testimony of the heavenly  visitation.[14] In this condition of trial, he continued without  further manifestation for three years, constantly expecting, but never  receiving the additional light and added instructions for which he  yearned. He was keenly sensitive of his own frailty and conscious of  human weaknesses. He pleaded before the Lord, acknowledging his errors  and craving help.      [14] See Note 2.    =15. Angelic Visitations.=--On the night of September 21st, 1823,  while praying for forgiveness of sins and for guidance as to his  future course, he was blessed with another heavenly manifestation.  There appeared in his room a brilliant light, in the midst of which  stood a personage clothed in white, and with a countenance of radiant  purity and loveliness. The celestial visitor announced himself as  Moroni, a messenger sent from the presence of God; and then he  proceeded to instruct the youth as to some of the Divine purposes in  which Joseph was to take a most important part. The angel said that  through Joseph as the earthly instrument the true Church would be  again established upon the earth; that his name would be known among  all nations and tongues, honored by the good, reviled by the wicked;  that a record, engraven on plates of gold, giving a history of the  nations that had formerly lived upon the western continent and an  account of the Savior's ministrations among the people on this land,  was hidden in a hill near by; that with the plates were two sacred  stones, known as Urim and Thummim, by the use of which, men in olden  times had become seers, and that through those instruments God would  enable Joseph to translate the record engraved on the plates.    =16.= The angelic messenger then repeated several prophecies which are  recorded in the ancient scriptures; some of the quotations were given  with variations from our Bible readings. Of the words of Malachi the  following were quoted: \"For behold, the day cometh that shall burn as  an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall burn  as stubble, for they that come shall burn them, saith the Lord of  Hosts, and it shall leave them neither root nor branch.\"[15] And  further:--\"Behold, I will reveal unto you the Priesthood by the hand  of Elijah the prophet, before the coming of the great and dreadful day  of the Lord. And he shall plant in the hearts of the children the  promises made to the fathers, and the hearts of the children shall  turn to their fathers; if it were not so, the whole earth would be  utterly wasted at his coming.\"[16] Among other scriptures, Moroni  cited the prophecies of Isaiah relating to the restoration of  scattered Israel, and the promised"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42243"],[0,"The Hour of the Dragon (#4)"],[1,"squires to me!' exclaimed Conan, rising with alacrity and  casting off his velvet night-garment; he seemed to have forgotten his  forebodings at the prospect of action. 'Go to the captains and see that  all is in readiness. I will be with you as soon as I don my armor.'    Many of Conan's ways were inexplicable to the civilized people he ruled,  and one of them was his insistence on sleeping alone in his chamber or  tent. Pallantides hastened from the pavilion, clanking in the armor he  had donned at midnight after a few hours' sleep. He cast a swift glance  over the camp, which was beginning to swarm with activity, mail clinking  and men moving about dimly in the uncertain light, among the long lines  of tents. Stars still glimmered palely in the western sky, but long pink  streamers stretched along the eastern horizon, and against them the  dragon banner of Nemedia flung out its billowing silken folds.    Pallantides turned toward a smaller tent near by, where slept the royal  squires. These were tumbling out already, roused by the trumpets. And as  Pallantides called to them to hasten, he was frozen speechless by a deep  fierce shout and the impact of a heavy blow inside the king's tent,  followed by the heart-stopping crash of a falling body. There sounded a  low laugh that turned the general's blood to ice.    Echoing the cry, Pallantides wheeled and rushed back into the pavilion.  He cried out again as he saw Conan's powerful frame stretched out on  the carpet. The king's great two-handed sword lay near his hand, and a  shattered tent-pole seemed to show where his stroke had fallen.  Pallantides' sword was out, and he glared about the tent, but nothing  met his gaze. Save for the king and himself it was empty, as it had been  when he left it.    'Your Majesty!' Pallantides threw himself on his knee beside the fallen  giant.    Conan's eyes were open; they blazed up at him with full intelligence and  recognition. His lips writhed, but no sound came forth. He seemed unable  to move.    Voices sounded without. Pallantides rose swiftly and stepped to the  door. The royal squires and one of the knights who guarded the tent  stood there.    'We heard a sound within,' said the knight apologetically. 'Is all well  with the king?'    Pallantides regarded him searchingly.    'None has entered or left the pavilion this night?'    'None save yourself, my lord,' answered the knight, and Pallantides  could not doubt his honesty.    'The king stumbled and dropped his sword,' said Pallantides briefly.  'Return to your post.'    As the knight turned away, the general covertly motioned to the five  royal squires, and when they had followed him in, he drew the flap  closely. They turned pale at the sight of the king stretched upon the  carpet, but Pallantides' quick gesture checked their exclamations.    The general bent over him again, and again Conan made an effort to  speak. The veins in his temples and the cords in his neck swelled with  his efforts, and he lifted his head clear of the ground. Voice came at  last, mumbling and half intelligible.    '_The thing--the thing in the corner!_'    Pallantides lifted his head and looked fearfully about him. He saw the  pale faces of the squires in the lamplight, the velvet shadows that  lurked along the walls of the pavilion. That was all.    'There is nothing here, your Majesty,' he said.    'It was there, in the corner,' muttered the king, tossing his lion-maned  head from side to side in his efforts to rise. 'A man--at least he  looked like a man--wrapped in rags like a mummy's bandages, with a  moldering cloak drawn about him, and a hood. All I could see was his  eyes, as he crouched there in the shadows. I thought he was a shadow  himself, until I saw his eyes. They were like black jewels.    'I made at him and swung my sword, but I missed him clean--how, Crom  knows--and splintered that pole instead. He caught my wrist as I  staggered off balance, and his fingers burned like hot iron. All the  strength went out of me, and the floor rose and struck me like a club.  Then he was gone, and I was down, and--curse him!--I can't move! I'm  paralysed!'    Pallantides lifted the giant's hand, and his flesh crawled. On the  king's wrist showed the blue marks of long, lean fingers. What hand  could grip so hard as to leave its print on that thick wrist?  Pallantides remembered that low laugh he had heard as he rushed into the  tent, and cold perspiration beaded his skin. It had not been Conan who  laughed.    'This is a thing diabolical!' whispered a trembling squire. 'Men say the  children of darkness war for Tarascus!'    'Be silent!' ordered Pallantides sternly.    Outside, the dawn was dimming the stars. A light wind sprang up from the  peaks, and brought the fanfare of a thousand trumpets. At the sound a  convulsive shudder ran through the king's mighty form. Again the veins  in his temples knotted as he strove to break the invisible shackles  which crushed him down.    'Put my harness on me and tie me into my saddle,' he whispered. 'I'll  lead the charge yet!'    Pallantides shook his head, and a squire plucked his skirt.    'My lord, we are lost if the host learns the king has been smitten! Only  he could have led us to victory this day.'    'Help me lift him on the dais,' answered the general.    They obeyed, and laid the helpless giant on the furs, and spread a  silken cloak over him. Pallantides turned to the five squires and  searched their pale faces long before he spoke.    'Our lips must be sealed for ever as to what happens in this tent,' he  said at last. 'The kingdom of Aquilonia depends upon it. One of you go  and fetch me the officer Valannus, who is a captain of the Pellian  spearmen.'    The squire indicated bowed and hastened from the tent, and Pallantides  stood staring down at the stricken king, while outside trumpets blared,  drums thundered, and the roar of the multitudes rose in the growing  dawn. Presently the squire returned with the officer Pallantides had  named--a tall man, broad and powerful, built much like the king. Like  him, also, he had thick black hair. But his eyes were gray and he did  not resemble Conan in his features.    'The king is stricken by a strange malady,' said Pallantides briefly. 'A  great honor is yours; you are to wear his armor and ride at the head of  the host today. None must know that it is not the king who rides.'    'It is an honor for which a man might gladly give up his life,'  stammered the captain, overcome by the suggestion. 'Mitra grant that I  do not fail of this mighty trust!'    And while the fallen king stared with burning eyes that reflected the  bitter rage and humiliation that ate his heart, the squires stripped  Valannus of mail shirt, burganet and leg-pieces, and clad him in Conan's  armor of black plate-mail, with the vizored salade, and the dark plumes  nodding over the wyvern crest. Over all they put the silken surcoat with  the royal lion worked in gold upon the breast, and they girt him with a  broad gold-buckled belt which supported a jewel-hilted broadsword in a  cloth-of-gold scabbard. While they worked, trumpets clamored outside,  arms clanged, and across the river rose a deep-throated roar as squadron  after squadron swung into place.    Full-armed, Valannus dropped to his knee and bent his plumes before the  figure that lay on the dais.    'Lord king, Mitra grant that I do not dishonor the harness I wear this  day!'    'Bring me Tarascus' head and I'll make you a baron!' In the stress of  his anguish Conan's veneer of civilization had fallen from him. His eyes  flamed, he ground his teeth in fury and blood-lust, as barbaric as any  tribesmen in the Cimmerian hills.          3    The Cliffs Reel      The Aquilonian host was drawn up, long serried lines of pikemen and  horsemen in gleaming steel, when a giant figure in black armor emerged  from the royal pavilion, and as he swung up into the saddle of the black  stallion held by four squires, a roar that shook the mountains went up  from the host. They shook their blades and thundered forth their acclaim  of their warrior king--knights in gold-chased armor, pikemen in mail  coats and basinets, archers in their leather jerkins, with their  longbows in their left hand.    The host on the opposite side of the valley was in motion, trotting down  the long gentle slope toward the river; their steel shone through the  mists of morning that swirled about their horses' feet.    The Aquilonian host moved leisurely to meet them. The measured tramp of  the armored horses made the ground tremble. Banners flung out long  silken folds in the morning wind; lances swayed like a bristling forest,  dipped and sank, their pennons fluttering about them.    Ten men-at-arms, grim, taciturn veterans who could hold their tongues,  guarded the royal pavilion. One squire stood in the tent, peering out  through a slit in the doorway. But for the handful in the secret, no one  else in the vast host knew that it was not Conan who rode on the great  stallion at the head of the army.    The Aquilonian host had assumed the customary formation: the strongest  part was the center, composed entirely of heavily armed knights; the  wings were made up of smaller bodies of horsemen, mounted men-at-arms,  mostly, supported by pikemen and archers. The latter were Bossonians  from the western marches, strongly built men of medium stature, in  leathern jackets and iron head-pieces.    The Nemedian army came on in similar formation, and the two hosts moved  toward the river, the wings in advance of the centers. In the center of  the Aquilonian host the great lion banner streamed its billowing black  folds over the steel-clad figure on the black stallion.    But on his dais in the royal pavilion Conan groaned in anguish of  spirit, and cursed with strange heathen oaths.    'The hosts move together,' quoth the squire, watching from the door.  'Hear the trumpets peal! Ha! The rising sun"]]]
