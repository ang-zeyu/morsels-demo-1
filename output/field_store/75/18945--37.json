(#4)"],[1,"was abundant reason for the extraordinary interest which  this coming fight was creating.  It was born of the fact that all  the nation knew that this was not to be a duel between mere men,  so to speak, but a duel between two mighty magicians; a duel not  of muscle but of mind, not of human skill but of superhuman art  and craft; a final struggle for supremacy between the two master  enchanters of the age.  It was realized that the most prodigious  achievements of the most renowned knights could not be worthy  of comparison with a spectacle like this; they could be but child's  play, contrasted with this mysterious and awful battle of the gods.  Yes, all the world knew it was going to be in reality a duel  between Merlin and me, a measuring of his magic powers against  mine.  It was known that Merlin had been busy whole days and nights  together, imbuing Sir Sagramor's arms and armor with supernal  powers of offense and defense, and that he had procured for him  from the spirits of the air a fleecy veil which would render the  wearer invisible to his antagonist while still visible to other  men.  Against Sir Sagramor, so weaponed and protected, a thousand  knights could accomplish nothing; against him no known enchantments  could prevail.  These facts were sure; regarding them there was  no doubt, no reason for doubt.  There was but one question: might  there be still other enchantments, _unknown_ to Merlin, which could  render Sir Sagramor's veil transparent to me, and make his enchanted  mail vulnerable to my weapons?  This was the one thing to be  decided in the lists.  Until then the world must remain in suspense.    So the world thought there was a vast matter at stake here, and  the world was right, but it was not the one they had in their  minds.  No, a far vaster one was upon the cast of this die:  _the life of knight-errantry_.  I was a champion, it was true, but  not the champion of the frivolous black arts, I was the champion  of hard unsentimental common-sense and reason.  I was entering  the lists to either destroy knight-errantry or be its victim.    Vast as the show-grounds were, there were no vacant spaces in them  outside of the lists, at ten o'clock on the morning of the 16th.  The mammoth grand-stand was clothed in flags, streamers, and rich  tapestries, and packed with several acres of small-fry tributary  kings, their suites, and the British aristocracy; with our own  royal gang in the chief place, and each and every individual  a flashing prism of gaudy silks and velvets--well, I never saw  anything to begin with it but a fight between an Upper Mississippi  sunset and the aurora borealis.  The huge camp of beflagged and  gay-colored tents at one end of the lists, with a stiff-standing  sentinel at every door and a shining shield hanging by him for  challenge, was another fine sight.  You see, every knight was  there who had any ambition or any caste feeling; for my feeling  toward their order was not much of a secret, and so here was their  chance.  If I won my fight with Sir Sagramor, others would have  the right to call me out as long as I might be willing to respond.    Down at our end there were but two tents; one for me, and another  for my servants.  At the appointed hour the king made a sign, and  the heralds, in their tabards, appeared and made proclamation,  naming the combatants and stating the cause of quarrel.  There  was a pause, then a ringing bugle-blast, which was the signal for  us to come forth.  All the multitude caught their breath, and  an eager curiosity flashed into every face.    Out from his tent rode great Sir Sagramor, an imposing tower  of iron, stately and rigid, his huge spear standing upright in its  socket and grasped in his strong hand, his grand horse's face and  breast cased in steel, his body clothed in rich trappings that  almost dragged the ground--oh, a most noble picture.  A great  shout went up, of welcome and admiration.    And then out I came.  But I didn't get any shout.  There was  a wondering and eloquent silence for a moment, then a great wave  of laughter began to sweep along that human sea, but a warning  bugle-blast cut its career short.  I was in the simplest and  comfortablest of gymnast costumes--flesh-colored tights from neck  to heel, with blue silk puffings about my loins, and bareheaded.  My horse was not above medium size, but he was alert, slender-limbed,  muscled with watchsprings, and just a greyhound to go.  He was  a beauty, glossy as silk, and naked as he was when he was born,  except for bridle and ranger-saddle.    The iron tower and the gorgeous bedquilt came cumbrously but  gracefully pirouetting down the lists, and we tripped lightly up  to meet them.  We halted; the tower saluted, I responded; then  we wheeled and rode side by side to the grand-stand and faced  our king and queen, to whom we made obeisance.  The queen exclaimed:    \"Alack, Sir Boss, wilt fight naked, and without lance or sword or--\"    But the king checked her and made her understand, with a polite  phrase or two, that this was none of her business.  The bugles  rang again; and we separated and rode to the ends of the lists,  and took position.  Now old Merlin stepped into view and cast  a dainty web of gossamer threads over Sir Sagramor which turned  him into Hamlet's ghost; the king made a sign, the bugles blew,  Sir Sagramor laid his great lance in rest, and the next moment here  he came thundering down the course with his veil flying out behind,  and I went whistling through the air like an arrow to meet him  --cocking my ear the while, as if noting the invisible knight's  position and progress by hearing, not sight.  A chorus of encouraging  shouts burst out for him, and one brave voice flung out a heartening  word for me--said:    \"Go it, slim Jim!\"    It was an even bet that Clarence had procured that favor for me  --and furnished the language, too.  When that formidable lance-point  was within a yard and a half of my breast I twitched my horse aside  without an effort, and the big knight swept by, scoring a blank.  I got plenty of applause that time.  We turned, braced up, and  down we came again.  Another blank for the knight, a roar of  applause for me.  This same thing was repeated once more; and  it fetched such a whirlwind of applause that Sir Sagramor lost his  temper, and at once changed his tactics and set himself the task  of chasing me down.  Why, he hadn't any show in the world at that;  it was a game of tag, with all the advantage on my side; I whirled  out of his path with ease whenever I chose, and once I slapped him  on the back as I went to the rear.  Finally I took the chase into  my own hands; and after that, turn, or twist, or do what he would,  he was never able to get behind me again; he found himself always  in front at the end of his maneuver.  So he gave up that business  and retired to his end of the lists.  His temper was clear gone now,  and he forgot himself and flung an insult at me which disposed  of mine.  I slipped my lasso from the horn of my saddle, and  grasped the coil in my right hand.  This time you should have seen  him come!--it was a business trip, sure; by his gait there was  blood in his eye.  I was sitting my horse at ease, and swinging  the great loop of my lasso in wide circles about my head; the  moment he was under way, I started for him; when the space between  us had narrowed to forty feet, I sent the snaky spirals of the rope  a-cleaving through the air, then darted aside and faced about and  brought my trained animal to a halt with all his feet braced under  him for a surge.  The next moment the rope sprang taut and yanked  Sir Sagramor out of the saddle!  Great Scott, but there was  a sensation!    Unquestionably, the popular thing in this world is novelty.  These  people had never seen anything of that cowboy business before,  and it carried them clear off their feet with delight.  From all  around and everywhere, the shout went up:    \"Encore! encore!\"    I wondered where they got the word, but there was no time to cipher  on philological matters, because the whole knight-errantry hive  was just humming now, and my prospect for trade couldn't have  been better.  The moment my lasso was released and Sir Sagramor  had been assisted to his tent, I hauled in the slack, took my  station and began to swing my loop around my head again.  I was  sure to have use for it as soon as they could elect a successor  for Sir Sagramor, and that couldn't take long where there were  so many hungry candidates.  Indeed, they elected one straight off  --Sir Hervis de Revel.    _Bzz_!  Here he came, like a house afire; I dodged: he passed like  a flash, with my horse-hair coils settling around his neck;  a second or so later, _fst_! his saddle was empty.    I got another encore; and another, and another, and still another.  When I had snaked five men out, things began to look serious to  the ironclads, and they stopped and consulted together.  As a  result, they decided that it was time to waive etiquette and send  their greatest and best against me.  To the astonishment of that  little world, I lassoed Sir Lamorak de Galis, and after him  Sir Galahad.  So you see there was simply nothing to be done now,  but play their right bower--bring out the superbest of the superb,  the mightiest of the mighty, the great Sir Launcelot himself!    A proud moment for me?  I should think so.  Yonder was Arthur,  King of Britain; yonder was Guenever; yes, and whole tribes of  little provincial kings and kinglets; and in the tented camp yonder,  renowned knights from many lands; and likewise the selectest body  known to chivalry, the Knights of the Table Round, the most  illustrious in Christendom; and biggest fact of all, the very sun  of their shining system was yonder couching his lance, the focal  point of forty thousand adoring eyes; and all by myself, here was  I laying for him.

It is the duty of     the British people to meet together immediately,     and by their votes elect representatives and deliver     into their hands the government.\"    I signed it \"The Boss,\" and dated it from Merlin's Cave.  Clarence said--    \"Why, that tells where we are, and invites them to call right away.\"    \"That is the idea.  We _strike_--by the Proclamation--then it's  their innings.  Now have the thing set up and printed and posted,  right off; that is, give the order; then, if you've got a couple  of bicycles handy at the foot of the hill, ho for Merlin's Cave!\"    \"I shall be ready in ten minutes.  What a cyclone there is going  to be to-morrow when this piece of paper gets to work!...  It's a  pleasant old palace, this is; I wonder if we shall ever again  --but never mind about that.\"        CHAPTER XLIII    THE BATTLE OF THE SAND BELT    In Merlin's Cave-- Clarence and I and fifty-two fresh, bright,  well-educated, clean-minded young British boys.  At dawn I sent  an order to the factories and to all our great works to stop  operations and remove all life to a safe distance, as everything  was going to be blown up by secret mines, \"_and no telling at what  moment--therefore, vacate at once_.\"  These people knew me, and  had confidence in my word.  They would clear out without waiting  to part their hair, and I could take my own time about dating the  explosion.  You couldn't hire one of them to go back during the  century, if the explosion was still impending.    We had a week of waiting.  It was not dull for me, because I was  writing all the time.  During the first three days, I finished  turning my old diary into this narrative form; it only required  a chapter or so to bring it down to date.  The rest of the week  I took up in writing letters to my wife.  It was always my habit  to write to Sandy every day, whenever we were separate, and now  I kept up the habit for love of it, and of her, though I couldn't  do anything with the letters, of course, after I had written them.  But it put in the time, you see, and was almost like talking;  it was almost as if I was saying, \"Sandy, if you and Hello-Central  were here in the cave, instead of only your photographs, what  good times we could have!\"  And then, you know, I could imagine  the baby goo-gooing something out in reply, with its fists in its  mouth and itself stretched across its mother's lap on its back,  and she a-laughing and admiring and worshipping, and now and then  tickling under the baby's chin to set it cackling, and then maybe  throwing in a word of answer to me herself--and so on and so on  --well, don't you know, I could sit there in the cave with my pen,  and keep it up, that way, by the hour with them.  Why, it was  almost like having us all together again.    I had spies out every night, of course, to get news.  Every report  made things look more and more impressive.  The hosts were gathering,  gathering; down all the roads and paths of England the knights were  riding, and priests rode with them, to hearten these original  Crusaders, this being the Church's war.  All the nobilities, big  and little, were on their way, and all the gentry.  This was all  as was expected.  We should thin out this sort of folk to such  a degree that the people would have nothing to do but just step  to the front with their republic and--    Ah, what a donkey I was!  Toward the end of the week I began to get  this large and disenchanting fact through my head: that the mass  of the nation had swung their caps and shouted for the republic for  about one day, and there an end!  The Church, the nobles, and  the gentry then turned one grand, all-disapproving frown upon them  and shriveled them into sheep!  From that moment the sheep had  begun to gather to the fold--that is to say, the camps--and offer  their valueless lives and their valuable wool to the \"righteous  cause.\"  Why, even the very men who had lately been slaves were  in the \"righteous cause,\" and glorifying it, praying for it,  sentimentally slabbering over it, just like all the other commoners.  Imagine such human muck as this; conceive of this folly!    Yes, it was now \"Death to the Republic!\" everywhere--not a dissenting  voice.  All England was marching against us!  Truly, this was more  than I had bargained for.    I watched my fifty-two boys narrowly; watched their faces, their  walk, their unconscious attitudes: for all these are a language  --a language given us purposely that it may betray us in times of  emergency, when we have secrets which we want to keep.  I knew  that that thought would keep saying itself over and over again  in their minds and hearts, _All England is marching against us!_  and ever more strenuously imploring attention with each repetition,  ever more sharply realizing itself to their imaginations, until  even in their sleep they would find no rest from it, but hear  the vague and flitting creatures of the dreams say, _All England_  --ALL ENGLAND!--_is marching against you_!  I knew all this would  happen; I knew that ultimately the pressure would become so great  that it would compel utterance; therefore, I must be ready with an  answer at that time--an answer well chosen and tranquilizing.    I was right.  The time came.  They HAD to speak.  Poor lads, it  was pitiful to see, they were so pale, so worn, so troubled.  At  first their spokesman could hardly find voice or words; but he  presently got both.  This is what he said--and he put it in the  neat modern English taught him in my schools:    \"We have tried to forget what we are--English boys!  We have tried  to put reason before sentiment, duty before love; our minds  approve, but our hearts reproach us.  While apparently it was  only the nobility, only the gentry, only the twenty-five or thirty  thousand knights left alive out of the late wars, we were of one  mind, and undisturbed by any troubling doubt; each and every one  of these fifty-two lads who stand here before you, said, 'They  have chosen--it is their affair.'  But think!--the matter is  altered--_All England is marching against us_!  Oh, sir, consider!  --reflect!--these people are our people, they are bone of our bone,  flesh of our flesh, we love them--do not ask us to destroy our nation!\"    Well, it shows the value of looking ahead, and being ready for  a thing when it happens.  If I hadn't foreseen this thing and been  fixed, that boy would have had me!--I couldn't have said a word.  But I was fixed.  I said:    \"My boys, your hearts are in the right place, you have thought the  worthy thought, you have done the worthy thing.  You are English  boys, you will remain English boys, and you will keep that name  unsmirched.  Give yourselves no further concern, let your minds be  at peace.  Consider this: while all England is marching against  us, who is in the van?  Who, by the commonest rules of war, will  march in the front?  Answer me.\"    \"The mounted host of mailed knights.\"    \"True.  They are thirty thousand strong.  Acres deep they will march.  Now, observe: none but _they_ will ever strike the sand-belt!  Then  there will be an episode!  Immediately after, the civilian multitude  in the rear will retire, to meet business engagements elsewhere.  None but nobles and gentry are knights, and _none but these_ will  remain to dance to our music after that episode.  It is absolutely  true that we shall have to fight nobody but these thirty thousand  knights.  Now speak, and it shall be as you decide.  Shall we  avoid the battle, retire from the field?\"    \"NO!!!\"    The shout was unanimous and hearty.    \"Are you--are you--well, afraid of these thirty thousand knights?\"    That joke brought out a good laugh, the boys' troubles vanished  away, and they went gaily to their posts.  Ah, they were a darling  fifty-two!  As pretty as girls, too.    I was ready for the enemy now.  Let the approaching big day come  along--it would find us on deck.    The big day arrived on time.  At dawn the sentry on watch in the  corral came into the cave and reported a moving black mass under  the horizon, and a faint sound which he thought to be military  music.  Breakfast was just ready; we sat down and ate it.    This over, I made the boys a little speech, and then sent out  a detail to man the battery, with Clarence in command of it.    The sun rose presently and sent its unobstructed splendors over  the land, and we saw a prodigious host moving slowly toward us,  with the steady drift and aligned front of a wave of the sea.  Nearer and nearer it came, and more and more sublimely imposing  became its aspect; yes, all England was there, apparently.  Soon  we could see the innumerable banners fluttering, and then the sun  struck the sea of armor and set it all aflash.  Yes, it was a fine  sight; I hadn't ever seen anything to beat it.    At last we could make out details.  All the front ranks, no telling  how many acres deep, were horsemen--plumed knights in armor.  Suddenly we heard the blare of trumpets; the slow walk burst into  a gallop, and then--well, it was wonderful to see!  Down swept  that vast horse-shoe wave--it approached the sand-belt--my breath  stood still; nearer, nearer--the strip of green turf beyond the  yellow belt grew narrow--narrower still--became a mere ribbon in  front of the horses--then disappeared under their hoofs.  Great  Scott!  Why, the whole front of that host shot into the sky with  a thunder-crash, and became a whirling tempest of rags and fragments;  and along the ground lay a thick wall of smoke that hid what was  left of the multitude from our sight.    Time for the second step in the plan of campaign!  I touched  a button, and shook the bones of England loose from her spine!    In that explosion all our noble civilization-factories went up in  the air and disappeared from the earth.  It was a pity, but it  was necessary.  We could not"]]]
