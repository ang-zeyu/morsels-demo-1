This infatuated young man used  sometimes to take tea with Miss Pinkerton, to whom he had been  presented by his mamma, and actually proposed something like marriage  in an intercepted note, which the one-eyed apple-woman was charged to  deliver.  Mrs. Crisp was summoned from Buxton, and abruptly carried off  her darling boy; but the idea, even, of such an eagle in the Chiswick  dovecot caused a great flutter in the breast of Miss Pinkerton, who  would have sent away Miss Sharp but that she was bound to her under a  forfeit, and who never could thoroughly believe the young lady's  protestations that she had never exchanged a single word with Mr.  Crisp, except under her own eyes on the two occasions when she had met  him at tea.    By the side of many tall and bouncing young ladies in the  establishment, Rebecca Sharp looked like a child.  But she had the  dismal precocity of poverty.  Many a dun had she talked to, and turned  away from her father's door; many a tradesman had she coaxed and  wheedled into good-humour, and into the granting of one meal more. She  sate commonly with her father, who was very proud of her wit, and heard  the talk of many of his wild companions--often but ill-suited for a  girl to hear.  But she never had been a girl, she said; she had been a  woman since she was eight years old.  Oh, why did Miss Pinkerton let  such a dangerous bird into her cage?    The fact is, the old lady believed Rebecca to be the meekest creature  in the world, so admirably, on the occasions when her father brought  her to Chiswick, used Rebecca to perform the part of the ingenue; and  only a year before the arrangement by which Rebecca had been admitted  into her house, and when Rebecca was sixteen years old, Miss Pinkerton  majestically, and with a little speech, made her a present of a  doll--which was, by the way, the confiscated property of Miss Swindle,  discovered surreptitiously nursing it in school-hours. How the father  and daughter laughed as they trudged home together after the evening  party (it was on the occasion of the speeches, when all the professors  were invited) and how Miss Pinkerton would have raged had she seen the  caricature of herself which the little mimic, Rebecca, managed to make  out of her doll. Becky used to go through dialogues with it; it formed  the delight of Newman Street, Gerrard Street, and the Artists' quarter:  and the young painters, when they came to take their gin-and-water with  their lazy, dissolute, clever, jovial senior, used regularly to ask  Rebecca if Miss Pinkerton was at home: she was as well known to them,  poor soul! as Mr. Lawrence or President West.  Once Rebecca had the  honour to pass a few days at Chiswick; after which she brought back  Jemima, and erected another doll as Miss Jemmy: for though that honest  creature had made and given her jelly and cake enough for three  children, and a seven-shilling piece at parting, the girl's sense of  ridicule was far stronger than her gratitude, and she sacrificed Miss  Jemmy quite as pitilessly as her sister.    The catastrophe came, and she was brought to the Mall as to her home.  The rigid formality of the place suffocated her: the prayers and the  meals, the lessons and the walks, which were arranged with a conventual  regularity, oppressed her almost beyond endurance; and she looked back  to the freedom and the beggary of the old studio in Soho with so much  regret, that everybody, herself included, fancied she was consumed with  grief for her father.  She had a little room in the garret, where the  maids heard her walking and sobbing at night; but it was with rage, and  not with grief.  She had not been much of a dissembler, until now her  loneliness taught her to feign. She had never mingled in the society of  women: her father, reprobate as he was, was a man of talent; his  conversation was a thousand times more agreeable to her than the talk  of such of her own sex as she now encountered. The pompous vanity of  the old schoolmistress, the foolish good-humour of her sister, the  silly chat and scandal of the elder girls, and the frigid correctness  of the governesses equally annoyed her; and she had no soft maternal  heart, this unlucky girl, otherwise the prattle and talk of the younger  children, with whose care she was chiefly intrusted, might have soothed  and interested her; but she lived among them two years, and not one was  sorry that she went away.  The gentle tender-hearted Amelia Sedley was  the only person to whom she could attach herself in the least; and who  could help attaching herself to Amelia?    The happiness--the superior advantages of the young women round about  her, gave Rebecca inexpressible pangs of envy.  \"What airs that girl  gives herself, because she is an Earl's grand-daughter,\" she said of  one.  \"How they cringe and bow to that Creole, because of her hundred  thousand pounds!  I am a thousand times cleverer and more charming than  that creature, for all her wealth. I am as well bred as the Earl's  grand-daughter, for all her fine pedigree; and yet every one passes me  by here.  And yet, when I was at my father's, did not the men give up  their gayest balls and parties in order to pass the evening with me?\"  She determined at any rate to get free from the prison in which she  found herself, and now began to act for herself, and for the first time  to make connected plans for the future.    She took advantage, therefore, of the means of study the place offered  her; and as she was already a musician and a good linguist, she  speedily went through the little course of study which was considered  necessary for ladies in those days.  Her music she practised  incessantly, and one day, when the girls were out, and she had remained  at home, she was overheard to play a piece so well that Minerva  thought, wisely, she could spare herself the expense of a master for  the juniors, and intimated to Miss Sharp that she was to instruct them  in music for the future.    The girl refused; and for the first time, and to the astonishment of  the majestic mistress of the school.  \"I am here to speak French with  the children,\" Rebecca said abruptly, \"not to teach them music, and  save money for you.  Give me money, and I will teach them.\"    Minerva was obliged to yield, and, of course, disliked her from that  day.  \"For five-and-thirty years,\" she said, and with great justice, \"I  never have seen the individual who has dared in my own house to  question my authority.  I have nourished a viper in my bosom.\"    \"A viper--a fiddlestick,\" said Miss Sharp to the old lady, almost  fainting with astonishment.  \"You took me because I was useful. There  is no question of gratitude between us.  I hate this place, and want to  leave it.  I will do nothing here but what I am obliged to do.\"    It was in vain that the old lady asked her if she was aware she was  speaking to Miss Pinkerton?  Rebecca laughed in her face, with a horrid  sarcastic demoniacal laughter, that almost sent the schoolmistress into  fits. \"Give me a sum of money,\" said the girl, \"and get rid of me--or,  if you like better, get me a good place as governess in a nobleman's  family--you can do so if you please.\"  And in their further disputes  she always returned to this point, \"Get me a situation--we hate each  other, and I am ready to go.\"    Worthy Miss Pinkerton, although she had a Roman nose and a turban, and  was as tall as a grenadier, and had been up to this time an  irresistible princess, had no will or strength like that of her little  apprentice, and in vain did battle against her, and tried to overawe  her. Attempting once to scold her in public, Rebecca hit upon the  before-mentioned plan of answering her in French, which quite routed  the old woman.  In order to maintain authority in her school, it became  necessary to remove this rebel, this monster, this serpent, this  firebrand; and hearing about this time that Sir Pitt Crawley's family  was in want of a governess, she actually recommended Miss Sharp for the  situation, firebrand and serpent as she was.  \"I cannot, certainly,\"  she said, \"find fault with Miss Sharp's conduct, except to myself; and  must allow that her talents and accomplishments are of a high order. As  far as the head goes, at least, she does credit to the educational  system pursued at my establishment.\"    And so the schoolmistress reconciled the recommendation to her  conscience, and the indentures were cancelled, and the apprentice was  free.  The battle here described in a few lines, of course, lasted for  some months.  And as Miss Sedley, being now in her seventeenth year,  was about to leave school, and had a friendship for Miss Sharp (\"'tis  the only point in Amelia's behaviour,\" said Minerva, \"which has not  been satisfactory to her mistress\"), Miss Sharp was invited by her  friend to pass a week with her at home, before she entered upon her  duties as governess in a private family.    Thus the world began for these two young ladies.  For Amelia it was  quite a new, fresh, brilliant world, with all the bloom upon it.  It  was not quite a new one for Rebecca--(indeed, if the truth must be told  with respect to the Crisp affair, the tart-woman hinted to somebody,  who took an affidavit of the fact to somebody else, that there was a  great deal more than was made public regarding Mr. Crisp and Miss  Sharp, and that his letter was in answer to another letter).  But who  can tell you the real truth of the matter? At all events, if Rebecca  was not beginning the world, she was beginning it over again.    By the time the young ladies reached Kensington turnpike, Amelia had  not forgotten her companions, but had dried her tears, and had blushed  very much and been delighted at a young officer of the Life Guards, who  spied her as he was riding by, and said, \"A dem fine gal, egad!\" and  before the carriage arrived in Russell"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5992"],[0,"Station Amusements in New Zealand (#4)"],[1,"s, who are as impudent as  they are tame and fearless. In appearance they resemble exactly a stout  hen pheasant, without its long tail; but they belong to the apterix  family, and have no wings, only a tiny useless pinion at each shoulder,  furnished with a claw like a small fish-hook: what is the use of this  claw I was never able to discover. When startled or hunted, the weka  glides, for it can scarcely be called running, with incredible swiftness  and in perfect silence, to the nearest cover. A tussock, a clump of  flax, a tuft of tall tohi grass, all serve as hiding-places; and,  wingless as she is, the weka can hold her own very well against her  enemies, the dogs. I really believe the great desire of Brisk's life was  to catch a weka. He started many, but used to go sniffing and barking  round the flax bush where it had taken refuge at first, long after  the clever, cunning bird had glided from its shelter to another cover  further off.    After dinner was over and Domville had brought back the tin plates  and pannikins from the creek where he had washed them up, pipes were  lighted, and a few minutes smoking served to rest and refresh the men,  who had been working since their six o'clock breakfast. The daylight  hours were too precious however to be wasted in smoking. Trew and  Domville would not have had that comfortable nest-egg standing in their  name at the bank in Christchurch, if they had spent much time over their  pipes; so after a very short \"spell\" they got up from the fallen log of  wood which had served them for a bench, and suggested that F---- should  accompany them back to where their work lay. \"You don't mind being  left?\" asked F----. \"Certainly not,\" replied I. \"I have got the dogs  for company, and a book in my pocket. I daresay I shall not read much,  however, for it is so beautiful to sit here and watch the changing  lights and shadows.\"    And so it was, most beautiful and thoroughly delightful. I sat on the  short sweet grass, which springs upon the rich loam of fallen leaves the  moment sunlight is admitted into the heart of a bush. No one plants it;  probably the birds carry the seeds; yet it grows freely after a clearing  has been made. Nature lays down a green sward directly on the rich  virgin mould, and sets to work besides to cover up the unsightly stems  and holes of the fallen timber with luxuriant tufts of a species of  hart's-tongue fern, which grows almost as freely as an orchid on decayed  timber. I was so still and silent that innumerable forest birds came  about me. A wood pigeon alighted on a branch close by, and sat preening  her radiant plumage in a bath of golden sunlight. The profound stillness  was stirred now and then by a soft sighing breeze which passed over the  tree tops, and made the delicate foliage of the undergrowth around me  quiver and rustle. I had purposely scattered the remains of our meal in  a spot where the birds could see the crumbs, and it was not long before  the clever little creatures availed themselves of the unexpected feast.  So perfectly tame and friendly were they, that I felt as if I were  the intruder, and bound by all the laws of aerial chivalry to keep the  peace. But this was no easy matter where Rose and Nettle were concerned,  for when an imprudent weka appeared on the sylvan scene, looking  around-as if to say, \"Who's afraid?\" it was more than I could do to keep  the little terriers from giving chase. Brisk, too, blundered after them,  but I had no fear of his destroying the charm of the day by taking even  a weka's life.    Thus the delicious afternoon wore on, until it was time to boil the  kettle once more, and make a cup of tea before setting out homewards.  The lengthening shadows added fresh tenderness and beauty to the  peaceful scene, and the sky began to paint itself in its exquisite  sunset hues. It has been usual to praise the tints of tropic skies when  the day is declining; but never, in any of my wanderings to East and  West Indies, have I seen such gorgeous evening colours as those which  glorify New Zealand skies.    A loud coo-ee summoned F---- to tea, and directly afterwards the horses  were re-saddled, the now empty flax basket filled with the obnoxious  teapot and cup, wrapped in many layers of flax leaves, to prevent their  rattling, and we bade good night to the tired bushmen. We left them at  their tea, and I was much struck to observe that though they looked like  men who had done a hard day's work, there was none of the exhaustion we  often see in England depicted on the labouring man's face. Instead of  a hot crowded room, these bushmen were going to sleep in their log hut,  where the fresh pure air could circulate through every nook and cranny.  They had each their pair of red blankets, one to spread over a heap of  freshly cut tussocks, which formed a delicious elastic mattrass, and the  other to serve as a coverlet. During the day these blankets were always  hung outside on a tree, out of the reach of the most investigating weka.  You may be sure I had not come empty-handed in the way of books and  papers, and my last glance as I rode away rested on Trew opening a  number of _Good Words_ [Note: _Evening Hours_ was not in existence at  that time, or else its pages are just what those simple God-fearing men  would have appreciated and enjoyed. _Good Words_ and the _Leisure Hour_  used to be their favourite periodicals, and the kindness of English  friends kept me also well supplied with copies of Miss Marsh's little  books, which were read with the deepest and most eager interest.] with  the pleased-expression of a child examining a packet of toys.    And so we rode slowly home through the delicious gloaming, with the  evening air cooled to freshness so soon as the sun had sunk below the  great mountains to the west, from behind which he shot up glorious rays  of gold and crimson against the blue ethereal sky, causing the snowy  peaks to look more exquisitely pure from the background of gorgeous  colour. During the flood of sunlight all day, we had not perceived a  single fleck of cloud; but now lovely pink wreaths, floating in mid-air,  betrayed that here and there a \"nursling of the sky\" lingered behind the  cloud-masses which we thought had all been blown away yesterday.    The short twilight hour was over, and the stars were filtering their  soft radiance on our heads by the time we heard the welcoming barks  of the homestead, and saw the glimmer of the lighted lamp in our  sitting-room, shining out of the distant gloom. And so ended, in supper  and a night of deep dreamless sleep, one of the many happy picnic days  of my New Zealand life.        Chapter II: Eel-fishing.      One of the greatest drawbacks in an English gentleman's eyes to living  in New Zealand is the want of sport. There is absolutely none. There  used to be a few quails, but they are almost extinct now; and during  four years' residence in very sequestered regions I only saw one. Wild  ducks abound on some of the rivers, but they are becoming fewer and  shyer every year. The beautiful Paradise duck is gradually retreating to  those inland lakes lying at the foot of the Southern Alps, amid glaciers  and boulders which serve as a barrier to keep back his ruthless foe.  Even the heron, once so plentiful on the lowland rivers, is now seldom  seen. As I write these lines a remorseful recollection comes back upon  me of overhanging cliffs, and of a bend in a swirling river, on  whose rapid current a beautiful wounded heron--its right wing  shattered--drifts helplessly round and round with the eddying water,  each circle bringing it nearer in-shore to our feet. I can see now its  bright fearless eye, full of suffering, but yet unconquered: its slender  neck proudly arched, and bearing up the small graceful head with its  coronal or top-knot raised in defiance, as if to protest to the last  against the cruel shot which had just been fired. I was but a spectator,  having merely wandered that far to look at my eel-lines, yet I felt as  guilty as though my hand had pulled the trigger. Just as the noble bird  drifted to our feet,--for I could not help going down to the river's  edge, where Pepper (our head shepherd) stood, looking very contrite,--it  reared itself half out of the water, with a hissing noise and  threatening bill, resolved to sell its liberty as dearly as it could;  but the effort only spread a brighter shade of crimson on the waters  surface for a brief moment, and then, with glazing eye and drooping  crest, the dying creature turned over on its side and was borne helpless  to our feet. By the time Pepper extended his arm and drew it in, with  the quaint apology, \"I'm sorry I shot yer, old feller! I, am, indeed,\"  the heron was dead; and that happened to be the only one I ever came  across during my mountain life. Once I saw some beautiful red-shanks  flying down the gorge of the Selwyn, and F---- nearly broke his neck in  climbing the crag from whence one of them rose in alarm at the noise  of our horses' feet on the shingle. There were three eggs in the  inaccessible cliff-nest, and he brought me one, which I tried in vain to  hatch under a sitting duck. Betty would not admit the intruder among her  own eggs, but resolutely pushed it out of her nest twenty times a day,  until at last I was obliged to blow it and send it home to figure in a  little boy's collection far away in Kent.    I have seen very good blue duck shooting on the Waimakiriri river, but  50 per cent. of the birds were lost for want of a retriever bold enough  to face that formidable river. Wide as was the beautiful reach, on whose  shore the sportsmen stood, and calmly as the deep stream seemed to glide  beneath its high banks, the wounded birds, flying low on the water,  had hardly dropped when they disappeared, sucked beneath by the strong  current, and whirled past us in less time than it takes one to write a  line. We had retrievers with us"]]]
