Aside from certain episodes of Chretien's romances, the student will be  most interested in the treatment of love as therein portrayed. On this  topic we may hear speaking the man of his time. \"Cliges\" contains the  body of Chretien's doctrine of love, while Lancelot is his most perfect  lover. His debt to Ovid has not yet been indicated with sufficient  preciseness. An elaborate code to govern sentiment and its expression  was independently developed by the troubadours of Provence in the early  twelfth century. These Provencal ideals of the courtly life were carried  into Northern France partly as the result of a royal marriage in 1137  and of the crusade of 1147, and there by such poets as Chretien they  were gathered up and fused with the Ovidian doctrine into a highly  complicated but perfectly definite statement of the ideal relations of  the sexes. Nowhere in the vulgar tongues can a better statement of these  relations be found than in \"Cliges.\"    So we leave Chretien to speak across the ages for himself and his  generation. He is to be read as a story-teller rather than as a poet,  as a casuist rather than as a philosopher. But when all deductions are  made, his significance as a literary artist and as the founder of a  precious literary tradition distinguishes him from all other poets  of the Latin races between the close of the Empire and the arrival of  Dante.    --W. W. COMFORT.            EREC ET ENIDE [11]    (Vv. 1-26.) The rustic's proverb says that many a thing is despised that  is worth much more than is supposed. Therefore he does well who makes  the most of whatever intelligence he may possess. For he who neglects  this concern may likely omit to say something which would subsequently  give great pleasure. So Chretien de Troyes maintains that one ought  always to study and strive to speak well and teach the right; and he  derives from a story of adventure a pleasing argument whereby it may be  proved and known that he is not wise who does not make liberal use of  his knowledge so long as God may give him grace. The story is about Erec  the son of Lac--a story which those who earn a living by telling stories  are accustomed to mutilate and spoil in the presence of kings and  counts. And now I shall begin the tale which will be remembered so long  as Christendom endures. This is Chretien's boast.    (Vv. 27-66.) One Easter Day in the Springtime, King Arthur held court in  his town of Cardigan. Never was there seen so rich a court; for many  a good knight was there, hardy, bold, and brave, and rich ladies and  damsels, gentle and fair daughters of kings. But before the court was  disbanded, the King told his knights that he wished to hunt the White  Stag, [12] in order to observe worthily the ancient custom. When my lord  Gawain heard this, he was sore displeased, and said: \"Sire, you will  derive neither thanks nor goodwill from this hunt. We all know long  since what this custom of the White Stag is: whoever can kill the White  Stag must forsooth kiss the fairest maiden of your court, come what may.  But of this there might come great ill, for there are here five hundred  damsels of high birth, gentle and prudent daughters of kings, and there  is none of them but has a bold and valiant knight for her lover who  would be ready to contend, whether fight or wrong, that she who is his  lady is the fairest and gentlest of them all.\" The King replies: \"That  I know well; yet will I not desist on that account; for a king's word  ought never to be gainsaid. To-morrow morning we shall all gaily go to  hunt the White Stag in the forest of adventure. And very delightful this  hunt will be.\"    (Vv. 67-114.) And so the affair is arranged for the next morning  at daybreak. The morrow, as soon as it is day, the King gets up and  dresses, and dons a short jacket for his forest ride. He commands the  knights to be aroused and the horses to be made ready. Already they  are ahorse, and off they go, with bows and arrows. After them the Queen  mounts her horse, taking a damsel with her. A maid she was, the daughter  of a king, and she rode a white palfrey. After them there swiftly  followed a knight, named Erec, who belonged to the Round Table, and had  great fame at the court. [13] Of all the knights that ever were there,  never one received such praise; and he was so fair that nowhere in the  world need one seek a fairer knight than he. He was very fair, brave,  and courteous, though not yet twenty-five years old. Never was there  a man of his age of greater knighthood. And what shall I say of his  virtues? Mounted on his horse, and clad in an ermine mantle, he came  galloping down the road, wearing a coat of splendid flowered silk which  was made at Constantinople. He had put on hose of brocade, well made and  cut, and when his golden spurs were well attached, he sat securely in  his stirrups. He carried no arm with him but his sword. As he galloped  along, at the corner of a street he came up with the Queen, and said:  \"My lady, if it please you, I should gladly accompany you along this  road, having come for no other purpose than to bear you company.\" And  the Queen thanks him: \"Fair friend, I like your company well, in truth;  for better I could not have.\"    (Vv. 115-124.) Then they ride along at full speed until they come into  the forest, where the party who had gone before them had already started  the stag. Some wind the horns and others shout; the hounds plunge ahead  after the stag, running, attacking, and baying; the bowmen shoot amain.  And before them all rode the King on a Spanish hunter.    (Vv. 125-154.) Queen Guinevere was in the wood listening for the dogs;  beside her were Erec and the damsel, who was very courteous and fair.  But those who had pursued the stag were so far from them that, however  intently they might listen to catch the sound of horn or baying of  hound, they no longer could hear either horse, huntsman, or hound. So  all three of them drew rein in a clearing beside the road. They had been  there but a short time when they saw an armed knight along on his steed,  with shield slung about his neck, and his lance in hand. The Queen  espied him from a distance By his right side rode a damsel of noble  bearing, and before them, on a hack, came a dwarf carrying in his hand  a knotted scourge. When Queen Guinevere saw the comely and graceful  knight, she desired to know who he and his damsel were. So she bid her  damsel go quickly and speak to him.    (Vv. 155-274.) \"Damsel,\" says the Queen, \"go and bid yonder knight come  to me and bring his damsel with him.\" The maiden goes on amble straight  toward the knight. But the spiteful dwarf sallies forth to meet her with  his scourge in hand, crying: \"Halt, maiden, what do you want here? You  shall advance no farther.\" \"Dwarf,\" says she, \"let me pass. I wish to  speak with yonder knight; for the Queen sends me hither.\" The dwarf, who  was rude and mean, took his stand in the middle of the road, and said:  \"You have no business here. Go back. It is not meet that you should  speak to so excellent a knight.\" The damsel advanced and tried to pass  him by force, holding the dwarf in slight esteem when she saw that he  was so small. Then the dwarf raised his whip, when he saw her coming  toward him and tried to strike her in the face. She raised her arm  to protect herself, but he lifted his hand again and struck her all  unprotected on her bare hand: and so hard did he strike her on the back  of her hand that it turned all black and blue. When the maiden could do  nothing else, in spite of herself she must needs return. So weeping she  turned back. The tears came to her eyes and ran down her cheeks. When  the Queen sees her damsel wounded, she is sorely grieved and angered and  knows not what to do. \"Ah, Erec, fair friend,\" she says, \"I am in great  sorrow for my damsel whom that dwarf has wounded. The knight must be  discourteous indeed, to allow such a monster to strike so beautiful a  creature. Erec, fair friend, do you go to the knight and bid him come  to me without delay. I wish to know him and his lady.\" Erec starts  off thither, giving spurs to his steed, and rides straight toward  the knight. The ignoble dwarf sees him coming and goes to meet him.  \"Vassal,\" says he, \"stand back! For I know not what business you have  here. I advise you to withdraw.\" \"Avaunt,\" says Erec, \"provoking dwarf!  Thou art vile and troublesome. Let me pass.\" \"You shall not.\" \"That  will I.\" \"You shall not.\" Erec thrusts the dwarf aside. The dwarf had no  equal for villainy: he gave him a great blow with his lash right on  the neck, so that Erec's neck and face are scarred with the blow of  the scourge; from top to bottom appear the lines which the thongs have  raised on him. He knew well that he could not have the satisfaction of  striking the dwarf; for he saw that the knight was armed, arrogant, and  of evil intent, and he was afraid that he would soon kill him, should he  strike the dwarf in his presence. Rashness is not bravery. So Erec acted  wisely in retreating without more ado. \"My lady,\" he says, \"now matters  stand worse; for the rascally dwarf has so wounded me that he has badly  cut my face. I did not dare to strike or touch him; but none ought  to reproach me, for I was completely unarmed. I mistrusted the armed  knight, who, being an ugly fellow and violent, would take it as no jest,  and would soon kill me in his pride. But this much I will promise you;  that if I can, I shall yet avenge my disgrace, or increase it. But my  arms are too far away to avail me in this time of need; for at Cardigan  did I leave them this morning when I came away. And if I should go to  fetch them there, peradventure I should never again find the knight who  is riding off apace. So I must follow him at once, far or near, until  I find some arms to hire or borrow. If I find some one who will lend me  arms, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/832"],[0,"Robin Hood (#4)"],[1," budged not an inch, but laughed loudly. \"Now by my  halidom!\" he said good-naturedly, \"I would not move after hearing that  speech, even if minded to it before; for this better man I have sought  my life long. Therefore show him to me, an it please you.\"    \"That will I right soon,\" quoth Robin. \"Stay you here a little while,  till I cut me a cudgel like unto that you have been twiddling in your  fingers.\" So saying he sought his own bank again with a leap, laid aside  his long bow and arrows, and cut him a stout staff of oak, straight,  knotless, and a good six feet in length. But still it was a full foot  shorter than his opponent's. Then back came he boldly.    \"I mind not telling you, fellow,\" said he, \"that a bout with archery  would have been an easier way with me. But there are other tunes in  England besides that the arrow sings.\" Here he whirred the staff about  his head by way of practice. \"So make you ready for the tune I am about  to play upon your ribs. Have at you! One, two--\"    \"Three!\" roared the giant smiting at him instantly.    Well was it for Robin that he was quick and nimble of foot; for the blow  that grazed a hair's breadth from his shoulder would have felled an ox.  Nevertheless while swerving to avoid this stroke, Robin was poising for  his own, and back came he forthwith--whack!    Whack! parried the other.    Whack! whack! whack! whack!    The fight waxed fast and furious. It was strength pitted against  subtlety, and the match was a merry one. The mighty blows of the  stranger went whistling around Robin's ducking head, while his own swift  undercuts were fain to give the other an attack of indigestion. Yet each  stood firmly in his place not moving backward or forward a foot for a  good half hour, nor thinking of crying \"Enough!\" though some chance blow  seemed likely to knock one or the other off the narrow foot-bridge. The  giant's face was getting red, and his breath came snorting forth like  a bull's. He stepped forward with a furious onslaught to finish this  audacious fellow. Robin dodged his blows lightly, then sprang in swiftly  and unexpectedly and dealt the stranger such a blow upon the short ribs  that you would have sworn the tanner was trimming down his hides for  market.    The stranger reeled and came within an ace of falling, but regained his  footing right quickly.    \"By my life, you can hit hard!\" he gasped forth, giving back a blow  almost while he was yet staggering.    This blow was a lucky one. It caught Robin off his guard. His stick had  rested a moment while he looked to see the giant topple into the water,  when down came the other upon his head, whack! Robin saw more stars  in that one moment than all the astronomers have since discovered, and  forthwith he dropped neatly into the stream.    The cool rushing current quickly brought him to his senses, howbeit he  was still so dazed that he groped blindly for the swaying reeds to  pull himself up on the bank. His assailant could not forbear laughing  heartily at his plight, but was also quick to lend his aid. He thrust  down his long staff to Robin crying, \"Lay hold of that, an your fists  whirl not so much as your head!\"    Robin laid hold and was hauled to dry land for all the world like  a fish, except that the fish would never have come forth so wet and  dripping. He lay upon the warm bank for a space to regain his senses.  Then he sat up and gravely rubbed his pate.    \"By all the saints!\" said he, \"you hit full stoutly. My head hums like a  hive of bees on a summer morning.\"    Then he seized his horn, which lay near, and blew thereon three shrill  notes that echoed against the trees. A moment of silence ensued, and  then was heard the rustling of leaves and crackling of twigs like the  coming of many men; and forth from the glade burst a score or two of  stalwart yeomen, all clad in Lincoln green, like Robin, with good Will  Stutely and the widow's three sons at their head.    \"Good master,\" cried Will Stutely, \"how is this? In sooth there is not a  dry thread on your body.\"    \"Why, marry,\" replied Robin, \"this fellow would not let me pass the  footbridge, and when I tickled him in the ribs, he must needs answer by  a pat on the head which landed me overboard.\"    \"Then shall he taste some of his own porridge,\" quoth Will. \"Seize him,  lads!\"    \"Nay, let him go free,\" said Robin. \"The fight was a fair one and I  abide by it. I surmise you also are quits?\" he continued, turning to the  stranger with a twinkling eye.    \"I am content,\" said the other, \"for verily you now have the best end of  the cudgel. Wherefore, I like you well, and would fain know your name.\"    \"Why,\" said Robin, \"my men and even the Sheriff of Nottingham know me as  Robin Hood, the outlaw.\"    \"Then am I right sorry that I beat you,\" exclaimed the man, \"for I was  on my way to seek you and to try to join your merry company. But after  my unmannerly use of the cudgel, I fear we are still strangers.\"    \"Nay, never say it!\" cried Robin, \"I am glad I fell in with you; though,  sooth to say, I did all the falling!\"    And amid a general laugh the two men clasped hands, and in that clasp  the strong friendship of a lifetime was begun.    \"But you have not yet told us your name,\" said Robin, bethinking  himself.    \"Whence I came, men call me John Little.\"    \"Enter our company then, John Little; enter and welcome. The rites are  few, the fee is large. We ask your whole mind and body and heart even  unto death.\"    \"I give the bond, upon my life,\" said the tall man.    Thereupon Will Stutely, who loved a good jest, spoke up and said: \"The  infant in our household must be christened, and I'll stand godfather.  This fair little stranger is so small of bone and sinew, that his old  name is not to the purpose.\" Here he paused long enough to fill a horn  in the stream. \"Hark ye, my son,\"--standing on tiptoe to splash the  water on the giant--\"take your new name on entering the forest. I  christen you Little John.\"    At this jest the men roared long and loud.    \"Give him a bow, and find a full sheath of arrows for Little John,\"  said Robin joyfully. \"Can you shoot as well as fence with the staff, my  friend?\"    \"I have hit an ash twig at forty yards,\" said Little John.    Thus chatting pleasantly the band turned back into the woodland and  sought their secluded dell, where the trees were the thickest, the moss  was the softest, and a secret path led to a cave, at once a retreat and  a stronghold. Here under a mighty oak they found the rest of the band,  some of whom had come in with a brace of fat does. And here they built  a ruddy fire and sat down to the meat and ale, Robin Hood in the center  with Will Stutely on the one hand and Little John on the other. And  Robin was right well pleased with the day's adventure, even though he  had got a drubbing; for sore ribs and heads will heal, and 'tis not  every day that one can find a recruit as stout of bone and true of soul  as Little John.          CHAPTER III    HOW ROBIN HOOD TURNED BUTCHER, AND ENTERED THE SHERIFF'S SERVICE         The butcher he answered jolly Robin,       \"No matter where I do dwell,       For a butcher am I, and to Nottingham       Am I going, my flesh to sell.\"    The next morning the weather had turned ill, and Robin Hood's band  stayed close to their dry and friendly cave. The third day brought a  diversion in the shape of a trap by a roving party of the Sheriff's men.  A fine stag had been struck down by one Of Will Stutely's fellows, and  he and others had stepped forth from the covert to seize it, when twenty  bowmen from Nottingham appeared at the end of the glade. Down dropped  Will's men on all fours, barely in time to hear a shower of arrows  whistle above their heads. Then from behind the friendly trees they  sent back such a welcome that the Sheriff's men deemed it prudent not to  tarry in their steps. Two of them, in sooth, bore back unpleasant wounds  in their shoulders, from the encounter.    When they returned to town the Sheriff waxed red with rage.    \"What,\" he gasped, \"do my men fear to fight this Robin Hood, face to  face? Would that I could get him within my reach, once. We should see  then; we should see!\"    What it was the Sheriff would see, he did not state. But he was to have  his wish granted in short space, and you and I will see how he profited  by it.    The fourth day and the one following this friendly bout, Little John was  missing. One of his men said that he saw him talking with a beggar, but  did not know whither they had gone. Two more days passed. Robin grew  uneasy. He did not doubt the faith of Little John, but he was fearful  lest a roving band of Foresters had captured him.    At last Robin could not remain quiet. Up sprang he, with bow and arrows,  and a short sword at his side.    \"I must away to Nottingham town, my men,\" he cried. \"The goodly Sheriff  has long desired to see me; and mayhap he can tell me tidings of the  best quarter-staff in the shire\"--meaning Little John.    Others of the band besought him to let them go with him, but he would  not.    \"Nay,\" he said smilingly, \"the Sheriff and I are too good friends to put  doubt upon our meeting. But tarry ye in the edge of the wood opposite  the west gate of the town, and ye may be of service ere to-morrow  night.\"    So saying he strode forward to the road leading to Nottingham, and stood  as before looking up and down to see if the way was clear. Back at a  bend in the road he heard a rumbling and a lumbering, when up drove  a stout butcher, whistling gaily, and driving a mare that sped slowly  enough because of the weight of meat with which the cart was loaded.    \"A good morrow to you, friend,\" hailed Robin. \"Whence come you and where  go you with your load of meat?\"    \"A good morrow to you,\" returned the butcher, civilly enough. \"No matter  where I dwell. I am but a simple butcher, and to Nottingham am I going,  my flesh to sell. 'Tis Fair week, and my"]]]
