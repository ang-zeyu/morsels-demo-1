It remains for us, therefore, to provide against such  contingencies. Were one of the Peninsular and Oriental Company's vessels  cast by any accident upon this inhospitable shore, in the present state of  affairs the lives of the passengers, and the cargo, would be placed in  imminent peril.    In advocating the establishment of an armed post at Berberah no stress is  laid upon the subject of slavery. To cut off that traffic the possession  of the great export harbour is by no means necessary. Whenever a British  cruizer shall receive positive and _bona fide_ orders to search native  craft, and to sell as prizes all that have slaves on board, the trade will  receive a death-blow.    Certain measures have been taken during the last annual fair to punish the  outrage perpetrated by the Somal at Berberah in A.D. 1855. The writer on  his return to Aden proposed that the several clans implicated in the  offence should at once be expelled from British dominions. This  preliminary was carried out by the Acting Political Resident at Aden.  Moreover, it was judged advisable to blockade the Somali coast, from  Siyaro to Zayla, not concluded, until, in the first place, Lieut.  Stroyan's murderer, and the ruffian who attempted to spear Lieut. Speke in  cold blood, should be given up [13]; and secondly, that due compensation  for all losses should be made by the plunderers. The former condition was  approved by the Right Honorable the Governor-General of India, who,  however, objected, it is said, to the money-demand. [14] At present the  H.E. I.C.'s cruizers \"Mahi,\" and \"Elphinstone,\" are blockading the harbour  of Berberah, the Somal have offered 15,000 dollars' indemnity, and they  pretend, as usual, that the murderer has been slain by his tribe.    To conclude. The writer has had the satisfaction of receiving from his  comrades assurances that they are willing to accompany him once more in  task of African Exploration. The plans of the Frank are now publicly known  to the Somali. Should the loss of life, however valuable, be an obstacle  to prosecuting them, he must fall in the esteem of the races around him.  On the contrary, should he, after duly chastising the offenders, carry out  the original plan, he will command the respect of the people, and wipe out  the memory of a temporary reverse. At no distant period the project will,  it is hoped, be revived. Nothing is required but permission to renew the  attempt--an indulgence which will not be refused by a Government raised by  energy, enterprise, and perseverance from the ranks of merchant society to  national wealth and imperial grandeur.    14. St. James's Square,  10th February, 1856.      FOOTNOTES    [1] It occupies the whole of the Eastern Horn, extending from the north of  Bab el Mandeb to several degrees south of Cape Guardafui. In the former  direction it is bounded by the Dankali and the Ittoo Gallas; in the latter  by the Sawahil or Negrotic regions; the Red Sea is its eastern limit, and  westward it stretches to within a few miles of Harar.    [2] In A.D. 1838, Lieut. Carless surveyed the seaboard of the Somali  country, from Ras Hafun to Burnt Island; unfortunately his labours were  allowed by Sir Charles Malcolm's successor to lie five years in the  obscurity of MS. Meanwhile the steam frigate \"Memnon,\" Capt. Powell  commanding, was lost at Ras Assayr; a Norie's chart, an antiquated  document, with an error of from fifteen to twenty miles, being the only  map of reference on board. Thus the Indian Government, by the dilatoriness  and prejudices of its Superintendent of Marine, sustained an unjustifiable  loss of at least 50,000_l._    [3] In A.D. 1836-38, Lieut. Cruttenden published descriptions of travel,  which will be alluded to in a subsequent part of this preface.    [4] This \"hasty sketch of the scientific labours of the Indian navy,\" is  extracted from an able anonymous pamphlet, unpromisingly headed  \"Grievances and Present Condition of our Indian Officers.\"    [5] In A.D. 1848, the late Mr. Joseph Hume called in the House of Commons  for a return of all Indian surveys carried on during the ten previous  years. The result proved that no less than a score had been suddenly  \"broken up,\" by order of Sir Robert Oliver.    [6] This plan was successfully adopted by Messrs. Antoine and Arnauld  d'Abbadie, when travelling in dangerous parts of Abyssinia and the  adjacent countries.    [7] In A.D. 1660, Vermuyden found gold at Gambia always on naked and  barren hills embedded in a reddish earth.    [8] The writer has not unfrequently been blamed by the critics of Indian  papers, for venturing into such dangerous lands with an outfit nearly  1500_l._ in value. In the Somali, as in other countries of Eastern Africa,  travellers must carry not only the means of purchasing passage, but also  the very necessaries of life. Money being unknown, such bulky articles as  cotton-cloth, tobacco, and beads are necessary to provide meat and milk,  and he who would eat bread must load his camels with grain. The Somal of  course exaggerate the cost of travelling; every chief, however, may demand  a small present, and every pauper, as will be seen in the following pages,  expects to be fed.    [9] It is described at length in Chap. III.    [10] The author hoped to insert Lieut. Berne's journal, kept at Berberah,  and the different places of note in its vicinity; as yet, however, the  paper has not been received.    [11] Harar has frequently been described by hearsay; the following are the  principal authorities:--    Rochet (Second Voyage Dans le Pays des Adels, &c. Paris, 1846.), page 263.    Sir. W. Cornwallis Harris (Highlands of AEthiopia, vol. i. ch. 43. et  passim).    Cruttenden (Transactions of the Bombay Geological Society A.D. 1848).    Barker (Report of the probable Position of Harar. Vol. xii. Royal  Geographical Society).    M'Queen (Geographical Memoirs of Abyssinia, prefixed to Journals of Rev.  Messrs. Isenberg and Krapf).    Christopher (Journal whilst commanding the H. C.'s brig \"Tigris,\" on the  East Coast of Africa).    Of these by far the most correct account is that of Lieut. Cruttenden.    [12] In A.D. 1825, the Government of Bombay received intelligence that a  brig from the Mauritius had been seized, plundered, and broken up near  Berberah, and that part of her crew had been barbarously murdered by the  Somali. The \"Elphinstone\" sloop of war (Capt. Greer commanding) was sent  to blockade the coast; when her guns opened fire, the people fled with  their wives and children, and the spot where a horseman was killed by a  cannon ball is still shown on the plain near the town. Through the  intervention of El Hajj Sharmarkay, the survivors were recovered; the  Somal bound themselves to abstain from future attacks upon English  vessels, and also to refund by annual instalments the full amount of  plundered property. For the purpose of enforcing the latter stipulation it  was resolved that a vessel of war should remain upon the coast until the  whole was liquidated. When attempts at evasion occurred, the traffic was  stopped by sending all craft outside the guard-ship, and forbidding  intercourse with the shore. The \"Coote\" (Capt. Pepper commanding), the  \"Palinurus\" and the \"Tigris,\" in turn with the \"Elphinstone,\" maintained  the blockade through the trading seasons till 1833. About 6000_l._ were  recovered, and the people were strongly impressed with the fact that we  had both the will and the means to keep their plundering propensities  within bounds.    [13] The writer advised that these men should be hung upon the spot where  the outrage was committed, that the bodies should be burned and the ashes  cast into the sea, lest by any means the murderers might become martyrs.  This precaution should invariably be adopted when Moslems assassinate  Infidels.    [14] The reason of the objection is not apparent. A savage people is  imperfectly punished by a few deaths: the fine is the only true way to  produce a lasting impression upon their heads and hearts. Moreover, it is  the custom of India and the East generally, and is in reality the only  safeguard of a traveller's property.      [Illustration: Map to illustrate LIEUT.

I doubt not there are many who ignore the fact that in Eastern Africa,  scarcely three hundred miles distant from Aden, there is a counterpart of  ill-famed Timbuctoo in the Far West. The more adventurous Abyssinian  travellers, Salt and Stuart, Krapf and Isenberg, Barker and Rochet,--not  to mention divers Roman Catholic Missioners,--attempted Harar, but  attempted it in vain. The bigoted ruler and barbarous people threatened  death to the Infidel who ventured within their walls; some negro Merlin  having, it is said, read Decline and Fall in the first footsteps of the  Frank. [1] Of all foreigners the English were, of course, the most hated  and dreaded; at Harar slavery still holds its head-quarters, and the old  Dragon well knows what to expect from the hand of St. George. Thus the  various travellers who appeared in beaver and black"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/689"],[0,"The Kreutzer Sonata and Other Stories (#4)"],[1,"were, I am sure, and  as are tortured ninety-nine one-hundredths of our boys. I lived in a  frightful dread, I prayed to God, and I prostrated myself.    \"I was already perverted in imagination, but the last steps remained to  be taken. I could still escape, when a friend of my brother, a very  gay student, one of those who are called good fellows,--that is, the  greatest of scamps,--and who had taught us to drink and play cards, took  advantage of a night of intoxication to drag us THERE. We started.  My brother, as innocent as I, fell that night, and I, a mere lad of  sixteen, polluted myself and helped to pollute a sister-woman, without  understanding what I did. Never had I heard from my elders that what I  thus did was bad. It is true that there are the ten commandments of  the Bible; but the commandments are made only to be recited before  the priests at examinations, and even then are not as exacting as the  commandments in regard to the use of ut in conditional propositions.    \"Thus, from my elders, whose opinion I esteemed, I had never heard  that this was reprehensible. On the contrary, I had heard people whom  I respected say that it was good. I had heard that my struggles and my  sufferings would be appeased after this act. I had heard it and read it.  I had heard from my elders that it was excellent for the health, and my  friends have always seemed to believe that it contained I know not what  merit and valor. So nothing is seen in it but what is praiseworthy.  As for the danger of disease, it is a foreseen danger. Does not the  government guard against it? And even science corrupts us.\"    \"How so, science?\" I asked.    \"Why, the doctors, the pontiffs of science. Who pervert young people  by laying down such rules of hygiene? Who pervert women by devising and  teaching them ways by which not to have children?    \"Yes: if only a hundredth of the efforts spent in curing diseases were  spent in curing debauchery, disease would long ago have ceased to exist,  whereas now all efforts are employed, not in extirpating debauchery,  but in favoring it, by assuring the harmlessness of the consequences.  Besides, it is not a question of that. It is a question of this  frightful thing that has happened to me, as it happens to nine-tenths,  if not more, not only of the men of our society, but of all societies,  even peasants,--this frightful thing that I had fallen, and not because  I was subjected to the natural seduction of a certain woman. No, no  woman seduced me. I fell because the surroundings in which I found  myself saw in this degrading thing only a legitimate function, useful  to the health; because others saw in it simply a natural amusement, not  only excusable, but even innocent in a young man. I did not understand  that it was a fall, and I began to give myself to those pleasures  (partly from desire and partly from necessity) which I was led to  believe were characteristic of my age, just as I had begun to drink and  smoke.    \"And yet there was in this first fall something peculiar and touching. I  remember that straightway I was filled with such a profound sadness that  I had a desire to weep, to weep over the loss forever of my relations  with woman. Yes, my relations with woman were lost forever. Pure  relations with women, from that time forward, I could no longer have.  I had become what is called a voluptuary; and to be a voluptuary is a  physical condition like the condition of a victim of the morphine habit,  of a drunkard, and of a smoker.    \"Just as the victim of the morphine habit, the drunkard, the smoker, is  no longer a normal man, so the man who has known several women for  his pleasure is no longer normal? He is abnormal forever. He is a  voluptuary. Just as the drunkard and the victim of the morphine habit  may be recognized by their face and manner, so we may recognize a  voluptuary. He may repress himself and struggle, but nevermore will he  enjoy simple, pure, and fraternal relations toward woman. By his way of  glancing at a young woman one may at once recognize a voluptuary; and I  became a voluptuary, and I have remained one.\"        CHAPTER VI.    \"Yes, so it is; and that went farther and farther with all sorts of  variations. My God! when I remember all my cowardly acts and bad deeds,  I am frightened. And I remember that 'me' who, during that period, was  still the butt of his comrades' ridicule on account of his innocence.    \"And when I hear people talk of the gilded youth, of the officers, of  the Parisians, and all these gentlemen, and myself, living wild lives  at the age of thirty, and who have on our consciences hundreds of  crimes toward women, terrible and varied, when we enter a parlor or a  ball-room, washed, shaven, and perfumed, with very white linen, in dress  coats or in uniform, as emblems of purity, oh, the disgust! There  will surely come a time, an epoch, when all these lives and all this  cowardice will be unveiled!    \"So, nevertheless, I lived, until the age of thirty, without abandoning  for a minute my intention of marrying, and building an elevated conjugal  life; and with this in view I watched all young girls who might suit me.  I was buried in rottenness, and at the same time I looked for virgins,  whose purity was worthy of me! Many of them were rejected: they did not  seem to me pure enough!    \"Finally I found one that I considered on a level with myself. She was  one of two daughters of a landed proprietor of Penza, formerly very rich  and since ruined. To tell the truth, without false modesty, they pursued  me and finally captured me. The mother (the father was away) laid all  sorts of traps, and one of these, a trip in a boat, decided my future.    \"I made up my mind at the end of the aforesaid trip one night, by  moonlight, on our way home, while I was sitting beside her. I admired  her slender body, whose charming shape was moulded by a jersey, and her  curling hair, and I suddenly concluded that THIS WAS SHE. It seemed to  me on that beautiful evening that she understood all that I thought and  felt, and I thought and felt the most elevating things.    \"Really, it was only the jersey that was so becoming to her, and her  curly hair, and also the fact that I had spent the day beside her, and  that I desired a more intimate relation.    \"I returned home enthusiastic, and I persuaded myself that she realized  the highest perfection, and that for that reason she was worthy to be my  wife, and the next day I made to her a proposal of marriage.    \"No, say what you will, we live in such an abyss of falsehood, that,  unless some event strikes us a blow on the head, as in my case, we  cannot awaken. What confusion! Out of the thousands of men who marry,  not only among us, but also among the people, scarcely will you find  a single one who has not previously married at least ten times. (It is  true that there now exist, at least so I have heard, pure young people  who feel and know that this is not a joke, but a serious matter. May God  come to their aid! But in my time there was not to be found one such in  a thousand.)    \"And all know it, and pretend not to know it. In all the novels are  described down to the smallest details the feelings of the characters,  the lakes and brambles around which they walk; but, when it comes to  describing their GREAT love, not a word is breathed of what HE, the  interesting character, has previously done, not a word about  his frequenting of disreputable houses, or his association with  nursery-maids, cooks, and the wives of others.    \"And if anything is said of these things, such IMPROPER novels are not  allowed in the hands of young girls. All men have the air of believing,  in presence of maidens, that these corrupt pleasures, in which EVERYBODY  takes part, do not exist, or exist only to a very small extent. They  pretend it so carefully that they succeed in convincing themselves of  it. As for the poor young girls, they believe it quite seriously, just  as my poor wife believed it.    \"I remember that, being already engaged, I showed her my 'memoirs,' from  which she could learn more or less of my past, and especially my last  liaison which she might perhaps have discovered through the gossip of  some third party. It was for this last reason, for that matter, that I  felt the necessity of communicating these memoirs to her. I can still  see her fright, her despair, her bewilderment, when she had learned and  understood it. She was on the point of breaking the engagement. What a  lucky thing it would have been for both of us!\"    Posdnicheff was silent for a moment, and then resumed:--    \"After all, no! It is better that things happened as they did, better!\"  he cried. \"It was a good thing for me. Besides, it makes no difference.  I was saying that in these cases it is the poor young girls who are  deceived. As for the mothers, the mothers especially, informed by their  husbands, they know all, and, while pretending to believe in the purity  of the young man, they act as if they did not believe in it.    \"They know what bait must be held out to people for themselves and their  daughters. We men sin through ignorance, and a determination not to  learn. As for the women, they know very well that the noblest and most  poetic love, as we call it, depends, not on moral qualities, but on the  physical intimacy, and also on the manner of doing the hair, and the  color and shape.    \"Ask an experienced coquette, who has undertaken to seduce a man, which  she would prefer,--to be convicted, in presence of the man whom she is  engaged in conquering, of falsehood, perversity, cruelty, or to appear  before him in an ill-fitting dress, or a dress of an unbecoming color.  She will prefer the first alternative. She knows very well that we  simply lie when we talk of our elevated sentiments, that we seek only  the possession of her body, and that because of that we will forgive her  every sort of baseness, "]]]
