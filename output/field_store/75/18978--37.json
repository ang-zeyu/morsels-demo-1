Selah.    19:021:003 For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou             settest a crown of pure gold on his head.    19:021:004 He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of             days for ever and ever.    19:021:005 His glory is great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast             thou laid upon him.    19:021:006 For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made             him exceeding glad with thy countenance.    19:021:007 For the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the mercy of             the most High he shall not be moved.    19:021:008 Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand             shall find out those that hate thee.    19:021:009 Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine             anger: the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the             fire shall devour them.    19:021:010 Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed             from among the children of men.    19:021:011 For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a             mischievous device, which they are not able to perform.    19:021:012 Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, when thou             shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the             face of them.    19:021:013 Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength: so will we sing             and praise thy power.    19:022:001 My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far             from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?    19:022:002 O my God, I cry in the day time, but thou hearest not; and in             the night season, and am not silent.    19:022:003 But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of             Israel.    19:022:004 Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst             deliver them.    19:022:005 They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in             thee, and were not confounded.    19:022:006 But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised             of the people.    19:022:007 All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the             lip, they shake the head, saying,    19:022:008 He trusted on the LORD that he would deliver him: let him             deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.    19:022:009 But thou art he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make             me hope when I was upon my mother's breasts.    19:022:010 I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou art my God from my             mother's belly.    19:022:011 Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to             help.    19:022:012 Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have             beset me round.    19:022:013 They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a             roaring lion.    19:022:014 I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint:             my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.    19:022:015 My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue             cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of             death.    19:022:016 For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have             inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.    19:022:017 I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me.    19:022:018 They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my             vesture.    19:022:019 But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste thee             to help me.    19:022:020 Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of             the dog.    19:022:021 Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast heard me from the             horns of the unicorns.    19:022:022 I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the             congregation will I praise thee.    19:022:023 Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob,             glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel.    19:022:024 For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the             afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he             cried unto him, he heard.    19:022:025 My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation: I will             pay my vows before them that fear him.    19:022:026 The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the             LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for ever.    19:022:027 All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the             LORD: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before             thee.    19:022:028 For the kingdom is the LORD's: and he is the governor among             the nations.    19:022:029 All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all             they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none             can keep alive his own soul.    19:022:030 A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for             a generation.    19:022:031 They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a             people that shall be born, that he hath done this.    19:023:001 The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.    19:023:002 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me             beside the still waters.    19:023:003 He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of             righteousness for his name's sake.    19:023:004 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,             I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy             staff they comfort me.    19:023:005 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine             enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.    19:023:006 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my             life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.    19:024:001 The earth is the LORD's, and the fulness thereof; the world,             and they that dwell therein.    19:024:002 For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon             the floods.    19:024:003 Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? or who shall stand             in his holy place?    19:024:004 He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not             lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.    19:024:005 He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and righteousness             from the God of his salvation.    19:024:006 This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy             face, O Jacob. Selah.    19:024:007 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye             everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.    19:024:008 Who is this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the             LORD mighty in battle.    19:024:009 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye             everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.    19:024:010 Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he is the King             of glory. Selah.    19:025:001 Unto thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul.    19:025:002 O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not mine             enemies triumph over me.    19:025:003 Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: let them be             ashamed which transgress without cause.    19:025:004 Shew me thy ways, O LORD; teach me thy paths.    19:025:005 Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my             salvation; on thee do I wait all the day.    19:025:006 Remember, O LORD, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses;             for they have been ever of old.    19:025:007 Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions:             according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness'             sake, O LORD.    19:025:008 Good

of the righteous shall be granted.    20:010:025 As the whirlwind passeth, so is the wicked no more: but the             righteous is an everlasting foundation.    20:010:026 As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so is the             sluggard to them that send him.    20:010:027 The fear of the LORD prolongeth days: but the years of the             wicked shall be shortened.    20:010:028 The hope of the righteous shall be gladness: but the             expectation of the wicked shall perish.    20:010:029 The way of the LORD is strength to the upright: but             destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity.    20:010:030 The righteous shall never be removed: but the wicked shall not             inhabit the earth.    20:010:031 The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom: but the froward             tongue shall be cut out.    20:010:032 The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable: but the             mouth of the wicked speaketh frowardness.    20:011:001 A false balance is abomination to the LORD: but a just weight             is his delight.    20:011:002 When pride cometh, then cometh shame: but with the lowly is             wisdom.    20:011:003 The integrity of the upright shall guide them: but the             perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them.    20:011:004 Riches profit not in the day of wrath: but righteousness             delivereth from death.    20:011:005 The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way: but the             wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.    20:011:006 The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them: but             transgressors shall be taken in their own naughtiness.    20:011:007 When a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish: and the             hope of unjust men perisheth.    20:011:008 The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked             cometh in his stead.    20:011:009 An hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his neighbour: but             through knowledge shall the just be delivered.    20:011:010 When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth: and             when the wicked perish, there is shouting.    20:011:011 By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted: but it is             overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.    20:011:012 He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour: but a man             of understanding holdeth his peace.    20:011:013 A talebearer revealeth secrets: but he that is of a faithful             spirit concealeth the matter.    20:011:014 Where no counsel is, the people fall: but in the multitude of             counsellors there is safety.    20:011:015 He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it: and he             that hateth suretiship is sure.    20:011:016 A gracious woman retaineth honour: and strong men retain             riches.    20:011:017 The merciful man doeth good to his own soul: but he that is             cruel troubleth his own flesh.    20:011:018 The wicked worketh a deceitful work: but to him that soweth             righteousness shall be a sure reward.    20:011:019 As righteousness tendeth to life: so he that pursueth evil             pursueth it to his own death.    20:011:020 They that are of a froward heart are abomination to the LORD:             but such as are upright in their way are his delight.    20:011:021 Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished:             but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.    20:011:022 As a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, so is a fair woman             which is without discretion.    20:011:023 The desire of the righteous is only good: but the expectation             of the wicked is wrath.    20:011:024 There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is             that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty.    20:011:025 The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall             be watered also himself.    20:011:026 He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him: but             blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it.    20:011:027 He that diligently seeketh good procureth favour: but he that             seeketh mischief, it shall come unto him.    20:011:028 He that trusteth in his riches shall fall; but the righteous             shall flourish as a branch.    20:011:029 He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind: and             the fool shall be servant to the wise of heart.    20:011:030 The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that             winneth souls is wise.    20:011:031 Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth: much             more the wicked and the sinner.    20:012:001 Whoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge: but he that hateth             reproof is brutish.    20:012:002 A good man obtaineth favour of the LORD: but a man of wicked             devices will he condemn.    20:012:003 A man shall not be established by wickedness: but the root of             the righteous shall not be moved.    20:012:004 A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband: but she that             maketh ashamed is as rottenness in his bones.    20:012:005 The thoughts of the righteous are right: but the counsels of             the wicked are deceit.    20:012:006 The words of the wicked are to lie in wait for blood: but the             mouth of the upright shall deliver them.    20:012:007 The wicked are overthrown, and are not: but the house of the             righteous shall stand.    20:012:008 A man shall be commended according to his wisdom: but he that             is of a perverse heart shall be despised.    20:012:009 He that is despised, and hath a servant, is better than he             that honoureth himself, and lacketh bread.    20:012:010 A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast: but the             tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.    20:012:011 He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread: but he             that followeth vain persons is void of understanding.    20:012:012 The wicked desireth the net of evil men: but the root of the             righteous yieldeth fruit.    20:012:013 The wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips: but the             just shall come out of trouble.    20:012:014 A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth:             and the recompence of a man's hands shall be rendered unto             him.    20:012:015 The way of a fool is right in his own eyes: but he that             hearkeneth unto counsel is wise.    20:012:016 A fool's wrath is presently known: but a prudent man covereth             shame.    20:012:017 He that speaketh truth sheweth forth righteousness: but a             false witness deceit.    20:012:018 There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword: but the             tongue of the wise is health.    20:012:019 The lip of truth shall be established for ever: but a lying             tongue is but for a moment.    20:012:020 Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine evil: but to the             counsellors of peace is joy.    20:012:021 There shall no evil happen to the just: but the wicked shall             be filled with mischief.    20:012:022 Lying lips are abomination to the LORD: but they that deal             truly are his delight.    20:012:023 A prudent man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of fools             proclaimeth foolishness.    20:012:024 The hand of the diligent shall bear rule: but the slothful             shall be under tribute.    20:012:025 Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop: but a good word             maketh it glad.    20:012:026 The righteous is more excellent than his neighbour: but the             way of the wicked seduceth them.    20:012:027 The slothful man roasteth not that which he took in hunting:             but the substance of a diligent man is precious.    20:012:028 In the way of righteousness is life: and in the pathway             thereof there is no death.    20:013:001 A wise son heareth his father's instruction: but a scorner             heareth not rebuke.    20:013:002 A man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth: but the soul             of the transgressors shall eat violence.    20:013:003 He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life: but he that             openeth wide his lips shall have destruction.    20:013:004 The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing: but the             soul of the diligent shall be made fat.    20:013:005 A righteous man hateth lying: but a wicked man is loathsome,             and cometh to shame.    20:013:006 Righteousness keepeth him that is upright in the way: but             wickedness overthroweth the sinner.    20:013:007 There is that maketh himself rich, yet hath nothing: there is             that maketh himself poor, yet hath great riches.    20:013:008 The ransom of a man's life are his riches: but the poor             heareth not rebuke.    20:013:009 The light of the righteous rejoiceth: but the lamp of the             wicked shall be put out.    20:013:010 Only by pride cometh contention: but with the well advised is             wisdom.    20:013:011 Wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished: but he that             gathereth by labour shall increase.    20:013:012 Hope deferred maketh the heart sick: but when the desire             cometh, it is a tree of life.    20:013:013 Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed: but he that             feareth the commandment shall be rewarded.    20:013:014 The law of the wise is a fountain of life, to depart from the             snares of death.    20:013:015 Good understanding giveth favour: but the way of transgressors             is hard.    20:013:016 Every prudent man dealeth with knowledge: but a fool layeth             open his folly.    20:013:017 A wicked messenger
