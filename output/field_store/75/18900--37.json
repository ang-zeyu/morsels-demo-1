As soon as the bank, from a private, became a public  institution, the Regent caused a fabrication of notes to the amount of  one thousand millions of livres. This was the first departure from sound  principles, and one for which Law is not justly blameable. While  the affairs of the bank were under his control, the issues had never  exceeded sixty millions. Whether Law opposed the inordinate increase  is not known, but as it took place as soon as the bank was made a royal  establishment, it is but fair to lay the blame of the change of system  upon the Regent.    Law found that he lived under a despotic government, but he was not yet  aware of the pernicious influence which such a government could exercise  upon so delicate a framework as that of credit. He discovered it  afterwards to his cost, but in the mean time suffered himself to be  impelled by the Regent into courses which his own reason must have  disapproved. With a weakness most culpable, he lent his aid in  inundating the country with paper money, which, based upon no solid  foundation, was sure to fall, sooner or later. The extraordinary present  fortune dazzled his eyes, and prevented him from seeing the evil day  that would burst over his head, when once, from any cause or other, the  alarm was sounded. The Parliament were from the first jealous of his  influence as a foreigner, and had, besides, their misgivings as to  the safety of his projects. As his influence extended, their animosity  increased. D'Aguesseau, the Chancellor, was unceremoniously dismissed by  the Regent for his opposition to the vast increase of paper money, and  the constant depreciation of the gold and silver coin of the realm.  This only served to augment the enmity of the Parliament, and when  D'Argenson, a man devoted to the interests of the Regent, was appointed  to the vacant chancellorship, and made at the same time minister of  finance, they became more violent than ever. The first measure of the  new minister caused a further depreciation of the coin. In order to  extinguish the billets d'etat, it was ordered that persons bringing  to the mint four thousand livres in specie and one thousand livres in  billets d'etat, should receive back coin to the amount of five thousand  livres. D'Argenson plumed himself mightily upon thus creating five  thousand new and smaller livres out of the four thousand old and larger  ones, being too ignorant of the true principles of trade and credit to  be aware of the immense injury he was inflicting upon both.    The Parliament saw at once the impolicy and danger of such a system,  and made repeated remonstrances to the Regent. The latter refused to  entertain their petitions, when the Parliament, by a bold, and very  unusual stretch of authority, commanded that no money should be received  in payment but that of the old standard. The Regent summoned a lit de  justice, and annulled the decree. The Parliament resisted, and issued  another. Again the Regent exercised his privilege, and annulled it,  till the Parliament, stung to fiercer opposition, passed another decree,  dated August 12th, 1718, by which they forbade the bank of Law to have  any concern, either direct or indirect, in the administration of the  revenue; and prohibited all foreigners, under heavy penalties, from  interfering, either in their own names, or in that of others, in the  management of the finances of the state. The Parliament considered Law  to be the author of all the evil, and some of the counsellors, in the  virulence of their enmity, proposed that he should be brought to trial,  and, if found guilty, be hung at the gates of the Palais de Justice.    Law, in great alarm, fled to the Palais Royal, and threw himself on the  protection of the Regent, praying that measures might be taken to reduce  the Parliament to obedience. The Regent had nothing so much at heart,  both on that account and because of the disputes that had arisen  relative to the legitimation of the Duke of Maine and the Count of  Thoulouse, the sons of the late King. The Parliament was ultimately  overawed by the arrest of their president and two of the counsellors,  who were sent to distant prisons.    Thus the first cloud upon Law's prospects blew over: freed from  apprehension of personal danger, he devoted his attention to his famous  Mississippi project, the shares of which were rapidly rising, in spite  of the Parliament. At the commencement of the year 1719 an edict was  published, granting to the Mississippi Company the exclusive privilege  of trading to the East Indies, China, and the South Seas, and to all the  possessions of the French East India Company, established by Colbert.  The Company, in consequence of this great increase of their business,  assumed, as more appropriate, the title of Company of the Indies, and  created fifty thousand new shares. The prospects now held out by Law  were most magnificent. He promised a yearly dividend of two hundred  livres upon each share of five hundred, which, as the shares were  paid for in billets d'etat, at their nominal value, but worth only 100  livres, was at the rate of about 120 per cent. profit.    The public enthusiasm, which had been so long rising, could not resist  a vision so splendid. At least three hundred thousand applications were  made for the fifty thousand new shares, and Law's house in the Rue de  Quincampoix was beset from morning to night by the eager applicants.  As it was impossible to satisfy them all, it was several weeks before a  list of the fortunate new stockholders could be made out, during which  time the public impatience rose to a pitch of frenzy. Dukes, marquises,  counts, with their duchesses, marchionesses, and countesses, waited  in the streets for hours every day before Mr. Law's door to know the  result. At last, to avoid the jostling of the plebeian crowd, which,  to the number of thousands, filled the whole thoroughfare, they took  apartments in the adjoining houses, that they might be continually near  the temple whence the new Plutus was diffusing wealth. Every day the  value of the old shares increased, and the fresh applications, induced  by the golden dreams of the whole nation, became so numerous that it  was deemed advisable to create no less than three hundred thousand new  shares, at five thousand livres each, in order that the Regent might  take advantage of the popular enthusiasm to pay off the national debt.  For this purpose, the sum of fifteen hundred millions of livres was  necessary. Such was the eagerness of the nation, that thrice the sum  would have been subscribed if the government had authorised it.    Law was now at the zenith of his prosperity, and the people were rapidly  approaching the zenith of their infatuation. The highest and the lowest  classes were alike filled with a vision of boundless wealth. There was  not a person of note among the aristocracy, with the exception of the  Duke of St. Simon and Marshal Villars, who was not engaged in buying  or selling stock. People of every age and sex, and condition in life,  speculated in the rise and fall of the Mississippi bonds. The Rue de  Quincampoix was the grand resort of the jobbers, and it being a narrow,  inconvenient street, accidents continually occurred in it, from the  tremendous pressure of the crowd. Houses in it, worth, in ordinary  times, a thousand livres of yearly rent, yielded as much as twelve or  sixteen thousand. A cobbler, who had a stall in it, gained about two  hundred livres a day by letting it out, and furnishing writing materials  to brokers and their clients. The story goes, that a hump-backed man who  stood in the street gained considerable sums by lending his hump as a  writing-desk to the eager speculators! The great concourse of persons  who assembled to do business brought a still greater concourse of  spectators. These again drew all the thieves and immoral characters of  Paris to the spot, and constant riots and disturbances took place. At  nightfall, it was often found necessary to send a troop of soldiers to  clear the street.    Law, finding the inconvenience of his residence, removed to the Place  Vendome, whither the crowd of agioteurs followed him. That spacious  square soon became as thronged as the Rue de Quincampoix: from morning  to night it presented the appearance of a fair. Booths and tents were  erected for the transaction of business and the sale of refreshments,  and gamblers with their roulette tables stationed themselves in the very  middle of the place, and reaped a golden, or rather a paper, harvest  from the throng. The Boulevards and public gardens were forsaken;  parties of pleasure took their walks in preference in the Place Vendome,  which became the fashionable lounge of the idle, as well as the general  rendezvous of the busy. The noise was so great all day, that the  Chancellor, whose court was situated in the square, complained to the  Regent and the municipality, that he could not hear the advocates. Law,  when applied to, expressed his willingness to aid in the removal of the  nuisance, and for this purpose entered into a treaty with the Prince de  Carignan for the Hotel de Soissons, which had a garden of several acres  in the rear. A bargain was concluded, by which Law became the purchaser  of the hotel, at an enormous price, the Prince reserving to himself the  magnificent gardens as a new source of profit. They contained some fine  statues and several fountains, and were altogether laid out with much  taste. As soon as Law was installed in his new abode, an edict was  published, forbidding all persons to buy or sell stock anywhere but  in the gardens of the Hotel de Soissons. In the midst among the trees,  about five hundred small tents and pavilions were erected, for the  convenience of the stock-jobbers.

I had caught my spur in the stirrup in  dismounting, and stumbled. Otherwise I must have been a dead man. The  bullet pierced the crown of my hat, only missing my skull by an inch or  less. The alarm was given. But no search-party could be mustered, do you  say?--which was prepared to explore the poison swamp--or so declared  my native servants. Valera, however, seized upon this incident to  illustrate his theory that there were those in the island who did not  hesitate to enter the Black Belt popularly supposed to cast up noxious  vapours at dusk of a sort fatal to any traveller.    \"That night over our wine we discussed the situation, and he pointed  out to me that now was the hour to test his theory. Orders had evidently  been given for my assassination and the attempt had failed.    \"'There will be a meeting,' said Valera, 'to discuss the next move. And  it will take place to-morrow night!'    \"I challenged him with a glance and I replied:    \"'To-morrow night is a full moon, and if you are agreeable we will make  a secret expedition into the swamp, and endeavour to find the clearing  which you say is there, and which you believe to be the rendezvous of  the conspirators.'    \"Even in the light of the lamp I saw Valera turn pale, but he was a  Spaniard and a man of courage.    \"'I agree, senor,' he replied. 'If my information is correct we shall  find the way.'    \"I must explain that the information to which he referred had been  supplied by a native girl who loved him. That this clearing was a  meeting-place she had denied. But she had admitted that it was possible  to obtain access to it, and had even described the path.\" He paused.  \"She died of a lingering sickness.\"    Colonel Menendez spoke these last words with great deliberation and  treated each of us to a long and significant stare.    \"Presently,\" he added, \"I will tell you what was nailed to the wall of  her hut on the night that she fell ill. But to continue my narrative.  On the following evening, suitably equipped, Valera and myself set out,  leaving by a side door and striking into the woods at a point east of  the hacienda, where, according to his information, a footpath existed,  which would lead us to the clearing we desired to visit. Of that  journey, gentlemen, I have most terrible memories.    \"Imagine a dense and poisonous jungle, carpeted by rotten vegetation  in which one's feet sank deeply and from which arose a visible and  stenching vapour. Imagine living things, slimy things, moving beneath  the tread, sometimes coiling about our riding boots, sometimes making  hissing sounds. Imagine places where the path was overgrown, and we must  thrust our way through bushes where great bloated spiders weaved  their webs, where clammy night things touched us as we passed, where  unfamiliar and venomous insects clung to our garments.    \"We proceeded onward for more than half an hour guided by the moonlight,  but this, although tropically brilliant, at some places scarcely  penetrated the thick vapour which arose from the jungle. In those days I  was a young and vigorous man; my companion was several years my senior;  and his sufferings were far greater than my own. But if the jungle was  horrible, worse was yet to come.    \"Presently we stumbled upon an open space almost quite bare of  vegetation, a poisonous green carpet spread in the heart of the woods.  Here the vapour was more dense than ever, but I welcomed the sight of  open ground after the reptile-infested thicket. Alas! it was a snare, a  death-trap, a sort of morass, in which we sank up to our knees. Pah!  it was filthy--vile! And I became aware of great--lassitude, do you  say?--whilst Valera's panting breath told that he had almost reached the  end of his resources.    \"A faint breeze moved through the clearing and for a few moments we  were enabled to perceive one another more distinctly. I uttered an  exclamation of horror.    \"My companion's garments were a mass of strange-looking patches.    \"Even as I noticed them I glanced rapidly down--and found myself in  similar condition. As I did so one of these patches upon the sleeve of  my tunic intruded coldly upon my bare wrist. At that I cried out aloud  in fear. Valera and I commenced what was literally a fight for life.    \"Gentlemen, we were attacked by some kind of blood-red leeches, which  came out of the slime! In detaching them one detached patches of skin,  and they swarmed over our bodies like ants upon carrion.    \"They penetrated beneath our garments, these swollen, lustful, unclean  things; and it was whilst we staggered on through the swamp in agony of  mind and body that we saw the light of many torches amid the trees ahead  of us, and in their smoky glare witnessed the flight of hundreds  of bats. The moonlight creeping dimly through the mist, and the  torchlight--how do you say?--enflaming the vegetation, created a scene  like that of Inferno, in which naked figures danced wildly, uttering  animal cries.    \"Above the shrieking and howling, which rose and fell in a sort of  unholy chorus, I heard one long, wailing sound, repeated and repeated.  It was an African word. But I knew its meaning.    \"It was '_Bat Wing_!'    \"My doubts were dispersed. This was a meeting-place of  Devil-worshippers, or devotees of the cult of Voodoo! One man only could  I see clearly so as to remember him, a big negro employed upon one of  my estates. He seemed to be a sort of high priest or president of the  orgies. Attached to his arms were giant imitations of bat wings which he  moved grotesquely as if in flight. There were many women in the throng,  which numbered fully I should think a hundred people. But the final  collapse of my brave, unhappy Valera at this point brought home to me  the nature of the peril in which I stood.    \"He lay at my feet, moving convulsively, and sinking ever deeper in  the swamp, red leeches moving slowly, slowly over his fast-disappearing  body.\"    Colonel Menendez paused in his appalling narrative and wiped his moist  forehead with a silk handkerchief. Neither Harley nor I spoke. I knew  not if my friend believed the Spaniard's story. For my own part I found  it difficult to do so. But that the narrator was deeply moved was a fact  beyond dispute.    He suddenly commenced again:    \"My next recollection is of awakening in my own bed at the hacienda. I  had staggered back as far as the veranda, in raving delirium, and in the  grip of a strange fever which prostrated me for many months, and which  defied the knowledge of all the specialists who could be procured from  Cuba and the United States. My survival was due to an iron constitution;  but I have never been the same man. I was ordered to leave the West  Indies directly it became possible for me to be moved. I arranged my  affairs accordingly, and did not return for many years.    \"Finally, however, I again took up my residence in Cuba, and for a time  all went well, and might have continued to do so, but for the following  incident. One night, being troubled by insomnia--sleeplessness--and the  heat, I walked out on to the balcony in front of my bedroom window. As  I did so, a figure which had been--you say lurking?--somewhere under the  veranda ran swiftly off; but not so swiftly that I failed to obtain a  glimpse of the uplifted face.    \"It was the big negro! Although many years had elapsed since I had seen  him wearing the bat wings at those unholy rites, I knew him instantly.    \"On a little table close behind me where I stood lay a loaded revolver.  I snatched it in a flash and fired shot after shot at the retreating  figure.\"    Colonel Menendez shrugged his shoulders and selected a fresh cigarette  paper.    \"Gentlemen,\" he continued, \"from that moment until this I have gone  in hourly peril of my life. Whether I hit my man or missed him, I have  never known to this day. If he lives or is dead I cannot say. But--\" he  paused impressively--\"I have told you of something that was nailed to  the hut of a certain native girl? Before she died I knew that it was a  death-token.    \"On the morning after the episode which I have just related attached to  the main door of the hacienda was found that same token.\"    \"And it was??\" said Harley, eagerly.    \"It was the wing of a bat!    \"I am perhaps a hasty man. It is in my blood. I tore the unclean thing  from the panel and stamped it under my feet. No one of the servants  who had drawn my attention to its presence would consent to touch  it. Indeed, they all shrank from me as though I, too, were unclean. I  endeavoured to forget it. Who was I to be influenced by the threats of  natives?    \"That night, just at the hour of sunset, a shot was fired at me from a  neighbouring clump of trees, only missing me I think by the fraction of  an inch. I realized that the peril was real, and was one against which I  could not fight.    \"Permit me to be brief, gentlemen. Six attempts of various kinds  were made upon my life in Cuba. I crossed to the United States. In  Washington, the political capital of the country, an assassin gained  access to my hotel apartment and but for the fact that a friend chanced  to call me up on the telephone at that late hour of the night, thereby  awakening me, I should have received a knife in my heart. I saw the  knife in the dim light; I saw the shadowy figure. I leapt out on the  opposite side of the bed, seized a table-lamp which stood there, and  hurled it at my assailant.    \"There was a crash, a stifled exclamation, shuffling, the door opened,  and my would-be assassin was gone. But I had learned something, and to  "]]]
