Renine described what they had seen:    \"On a tower some way from the house there were two dead bodies, two  skeletons rather ... a man and a woman still wearing the clothes which  they had on when they were murdered.\"    \"Come, come, now! Murdered?\"    \"Yes; and that is what we have come to trouble you about. The tragedy must  date back to some twenty years ago. Was nothing known of it at the time?\"    \"Certainly not,\" declared the count. \"I never heard of any such crime or  disappearance.\"    \"Oh, really!\" said Renine, looking a little disappointed. \"I hoped to  obtain a few particulars.\"    \"I'm sorry.\"    \"In that case, I apologise.\"    He consulted Hortense with a glance and moved towards the door. But on  second thought:    \"Could you not at least, my dear sir, bring me into touch with some persons  in the neighbourhood, some members of your family, who might know more  about it?\"    \"Of my family? And why?\"    \"Because the Domaine de Halingre used to belong and no doubt still belongs  to the d'Aigleroches. The arms are an eagle on a heap of stones, on a rock.  This at once suggested the connection.\"    This time the count appeared surprised. He pushed back his decanter and his  glass of sherry and said:    \"What's this you're telling me? I had no idea that we had any such  neighbours.\"    Renine shook his head and smiled:    \"I should be more inclined to believe, sir, that you were not very eager to  admit any relationship between yourself ... and the unknown owner of the  property.\"    \"Then he's not a respectable man?\"    \"The man, to put it plainly, is a murderer.\"    \"What do you mean?\"    The count had risen from his chair. Hortense, greatly excited, said:    \"Are you really sure that there has been a murder and that the murder was  done by some one belonging to the house?\"    \"Quite sure.\"    \"But why are you so certain?\"    \"Because I know who the two victims were and what caused them to be  killed.\"    Prince Renine was making none but positive statements and his method  suggested the belief that he supported by the strongest proofs.    M. d'Aigleroche strode up and down the room, with his hands behind his  back. He ended by saying:    \"I always had an instinctive feeling that something had happened, but I  never tried to find out.... Now, as a matter of fact, twenty years ago,  a relation of mine, a distant cousin, used to live at the Domaine de  Halingre. I hoped, because of the name I bear, that this story, which,  as I say, I never knew but suspected, would remain hidden for ever.\"    \"So this cousin killed somebody?\"    \"Yes, he was obliged to.\"    Renine shook his head:    \"I am sorry to have to amend that phrase, my dear sir. The truth, on the  contrary, is that your cousin took his victims' lives in cold blood and in  a cowardly manner. I never heard of a crime more deliberately and craftily  planned.\"    \"What is it that you know?\"    The moment had come for Renine to explain himself, a solemn and  anguish-stricken moment, the full gravity of which Hortense understood,  though she had not yet divined any part of the tragedy which the prince  unfolded step by step.\"    \"It's a very simple story,\" he said. \"There is every reason to believe that  M. d'Aigleroche was married and that there was another couple living in  the neighbourhood with whom the owner of the Domaine de Halingre were on  friendly terms. What happened one day, which of these four persons first  disturbed the relations between the two households, I am unable to say. But  a likely version, which at once occurs to the mind, is that your cousin's  wife, Madame d'Aigleroche, was in the habit of meeting the other husband  in the ivy-covered tower, which had a door opening outside the estate. On  discovering the intrigue, your cousin d'Aigleroche resolved to be revenged,  but in such a manner that there should be no scandal and that no one  even should ever know that the guilty pair had been killed. Now he had  ascertained--as I did just now--that there was a part of the house, the  belvedere, from which you can see, over the trees and the undulations of  the park, the tower standing eight hundred yards away, and that this was  the only place that overlooked the top of the tower. He therefore pierced  a hole in the parapet, through one of the former loopholes, and from  there, by using a telescope which fitted exactly in the grove which he  had hollowed out, he watched the meetings of the two lovers. And it was  from there, also, that, after carefully taking all his measurements, and  calculating all his distances, on a Sunday, the 5th of September, when the  house was empty, he killed them with two shots.\"    The truth was becoming apparent. The light of day was breaking. The count  muttered:    \"Yes, that's what must have happened. I expect that my cousin  d'Aigleroche....\"    \"The murderer,\" Renine continued, \"stopped up the loophole neatly with a  clod of earth. No one would ever know that two dead bodies were decaying  on the top of that tower which was never visited and of which he took the  precaution to demolish the wooden stairs. Nothing therefore remained for  him to do but to explain the disappearance of his wife and his friend. This  presented no difficulty. He accused them of having eloped together.\"    Hortense gave a start. Suddenly, as though the last sentence were a  complete and to her an absolutely unexpected revelation, she understood  what Renine was trying to convey:    \"What do you mean?\" she asked.    \"I mean that M. d'Aigleroche accused his wife and his friend of eloping  together.\"    \"No, no!\" she cried. \"I can't allow that!... You are speaking of a cousin  of my uncle's? Why mix up the two stories?\"    \"Why mix up this story with another which took place at that time?\" said  the prince. \"But I am not mixing them up, my dear madame; there is only one  story and I am telling it as it happened.\"    Hortense turned to her uncle. He sat silent, with his arms folded; and  his head remained in the shadow cast by the lamp-shade. Why had he not  protested?    Renine repeated in a firm tone:    \"There is only one story. On the evening of that very day, the 5th of  September at eight o'clock, M. d'Aigleroche, doubtless alleging as his  reason that he was going in pursuit of the runaway couple, left his house  after boarding up the entrance. He went away, leaving all the rooms as  they were and removing only the firearms from their glass case. At the  last minute, he had a presentiment, which has been justified to-day, that  the discovery of the telescope which had played so great a part in the  preparation of his crime might serve as a clue to an enquiry; and he threw  it into the clock-case, where, as luck would have it, it interrupted  the swing of the pendulum. This unreflecting action, one of those which  every criminal inevitably commits, was to betray him twenty years later.  Just now, the blows which I struck to force the door of the drawing-room  released the pendulum. The clock was set going, struck eight o'clock ...  and I possessed the clue of thread which was to lead me through the  labyrinth.\"    \"Proofs!\" stammered Hortense. \"Proofs!\"    \"Proofs?\" replied Renine, in a loud voice. \"Why, there are any number  of proofs; and you know them as well as I do. Who could have killed at  that distance of eight hundred yards, except an expert shot, an ardent  sportsman? You agree, M. d'Aigleroche, do you not?... Proofs? Why was  nothing removed from the house, nothing except the guns, those guns  which an ardent sportsman cannot afford to leave behind--you agree, M.  d'Aigleroche--those guns which we find here, hanging in trophies on the  walls!... Proofs? What about that date, the 5th of September, which was  the date of the crime and which has left such a horrible memory in the  criminal's mind that every year at this time--at this time alone--he  surrounds himself with distractions and that every year, on this same 5th  of September, he forgets his habits of temperance? Well, to-day, is the 5th  of September.... Proofs? Why, if there weren't any others, would that not  be enough for you?\"    And Renine, flinging out his arm, pointed to the Comte d'Aigleroche, who,  terrified by this evocation of the past, had sunk huddled into a chair and  was hiding his head in his hands.    Hortense did not attempt to argue with him. She had never liked her uncle,  or rather her husband's uncle. She now accepted the accusation laid against  him.    Sixty seconds passed. Then M. d'Aigleroche walked up to them and said:    \"Whether the story be true or not, you can't call a husband a criminal for  avenging his honour and killing his faithless wife.\"    \"No,\" replied Renine, \"but I have told only the first version of the story.  There is another which is infinitely more serious ... and more probable,  one to which a more thorough investigation would be sure to lead.\"    \"What do you mean?\"    \"I mean this. It may not be a matter of a husband taking the law into his  own hands, as I charitably supposed. It may be a matter of a ruined man who  covets his friend's money and his friend's wife and who, with this object  in view, to secure his freedom, to get rid of his friend and of his own  wife, draws them into a trap, suggests to them that they should visit that  lonely tower and kills them by shooting them from a distance safely under  cover.\"    \"No, no,\" the count protested. \"No, all that is untrue.\"    \"I don't say it isn't. I am basing my accusation on proofs, but also on  intuitions and arguments which up to now have been extremely accurate. All  the same, I admit that the second version may be incorrect. But, if so, why  feel any remorse? One does not feel remorse for punishing guilty people.\"    \"One does for taking life. It is a crushing burden to bear.\"    \"Was it to give himself greater strength to bear this burden that M.  d'Aigleroche afterwards"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/792"],[0,"Wieland; Or, The Transformation: An American Tale (#4)"],[1,"athwart the  apartment. His fancy immediately pictured to itself, a person bearing  a lamp. It seemed to come from behind. He was in the act of turning to  examine the visitant, when his right arm received a blow from a heavy  club. At the same instant, a very bright spark was seen to light upon  his clothes. In a moment, the whole was reduced to ashes. This was the  sum of the information which he chose to give. There was somewhat in  his manner that indicated an imperfect tale. My uncle was inclined to  believe that half the truth had been suppressed.    Meanwhile, the disease thus wonderfully generated, betrayed more  terrible symptoms. Fever and delirium terminated in lethargic slumber,  which, in the course of two hours, gave place to death. Yet not till  insupportable exhalations and crawling putrefaction had driven from his  chamber and the house every one whom their duty did not detain.    Such was the end of my father. None surely was ever more mysterious.  When we recollect his gloomy anticipations and unconquerable anxiety;  the security from human malice which his character, the place, and the  condition of the times, might be supposed to confer; the purity and  cloudlessness of the atmosphere, which rendered it impossible that  lightning was the cause; what are the conclusions that we must form?    The prelusive gleam, the blow upon his arm, the fatal spark, the  explosion heard so far, the fiery cloud that environed him, without  detriment to the structure, though composed of combustible materials,  the sudden vanishing of this cloud at my uncle's approach--what is the  inference to be drawn from these facts? Their truth cannot be doubted.  My uncle's testimony is peculiarly worthy of credit, because no man's  temper is more sceptical, and his belief is unalterably attached to  natural causes.    I was at this time a child of six years of age. The impressions that  were then made upon me, can never be effaced. I was ill qualified to  judge respecting what was then passing; but as I advanced in age, and  became more fully acquainted with these facts, they oftener became the  subject of my thoughts. Their resemblance to recent events revived them  with new force in my memory, and made me more anxious to explain them.  Was this the penalty of disobedience? this the stroke of a vindictive  and invisible hand? Is it a fresh proof that the Divine Ruler interferes  in human affairs, meditates an end, selects, and commissions his agents,  and enforces, by unequivocal sanctions, submission to his will? Or, was  it merely the irregular expansion of the fluid that imparts warmth to  our heart and our blood, caused by the fatigue of the preceding day, or  flowing, by established laws, from the condition of his thoughts? [*]           * A case, in its symptoms exactly parallel to this, is       published in one of the Journals of Florence. See, likewise,       similar cases reported by Messrs. Merille and Muraire, in       the \"Journal de Medicine,\" for February and May, 1783. The       researches of Maffei and Fontana have thrown some light upon       this subject.        Chapter III      The shock which this disastrous occurrence occasioned to my mother, was  the foundation of a disease which carried her, in a few months, to the  grave. My brother and myself were children at this time, and were now  reduced to the condition of orphans. The property which our parents left  was by no means inconsiderable. It was entrusted to faithful hands,  till we should arrive at a suitable age. Meanwhile, our education was  assigned to a maiden aunt who resided in the city, and whose tenderness  made us in a short time cease to regret that we had lost a mother.    The years that succeeded were tranquil and happy. Our lives were  molested by few of those cares that are incident to childhood. By  accident more than design, the indulgence and yielding temper of our  aunt was mingled with resolution and stedfastness. She seldom deviated  into either extreme of rigour or lenity. Our social pleasures were  subject to no unreasonable restraints. We were instructed in most  branches of useful knowledge, and were saved from the corruption and  tyranny of colleges and boarding-schools.    Our companions were chiefly selected from the children of our  neighbours. Between one of these and my brother, there quickly grew the  most affectionate intimacy. Her name was Catharine Pleyel. She was rich,  beautiful, and contrived to blend the most bewitching softness with  the most exuberant vivacity. The tie by which my brother and she were  united, seemed to add force to the love which I bore her, and which  was amply returned. Between her and myself there was every circumstance  tending to produce and foster friendship. Our sex and age were the same.  We lived within sight of each other's abode. Our tempers were remarkably  congenial, and the superintendants of our education not only prescribed  to us the same pursuits, but allowed us to cultivate them together.    Every day added strength to the triple bonds that united us. We  gradually withdrew ourselves from the society of others, and found every  moment irksome that was not devoted to each other. My brother's advance  in age made no change in our situation. It was determined that his  profession should be agriculture. His fortune exempted him from the  necessity of personal labour. The task to be performed by him was  nothing more than superintendance. The skill that was demanded by this  was merely theoretical, and was furnished by casual inspection, or  by closet study. The attention that was paid to this subject did not  seclude him for any long time from us, on whom time had no other effect  than to augment our impatience in the absence of each other and of  him. Our tasks, our walks, our music, were seldom performed but in each  other's company.    It was easy to see that Catharine and my brother were born for each  other. The passion which they mutually entertained quickly broke those  bounds which extreme youth had set to it; confessions were made or  extorted, and their union was postponed only till my brother had  passed his minority. The previous lapse of two years was constantly and  usefully employed.    O my brother! But the task I have set myself let me perform with  steadiness. The felicity of that period was marred by no gloomy  anticipations. The future, like the present, was serene. Time was  supposed to have only new delights in store. I mean not to dwell on  previous incidents longer than is necessary to illustrate or explain  the great events that have since happened. The nuptial day at length  arrived. My brother took possession of the house in which he was born,  and here the long protracted marriage was solemnized.    My father's property was equally divided between us. A neat dwelling,  situated on the bank of the river, three quarters of a mile from my  brother's, was now occupied by me. These domains were called, from the  name of the first possessor, Mettingen. I can scarcely account for my  refusing to take up my abode with him, unless it were from a disposition  to be an economist of pleasure. Self-denial, seasonably exercised, is  one means of enhancing our gratifications. I was, beside, desirous of  administering a fund, and regulating an household, of my own. The short  distance allowed us to exchange visits as often as we pleased. The  walk from one mansion to the other was no undelightful prelude to our  interviews. I was sometimes their visitant, and they, as frequently,  were my guests.    Our education had been modelled by no religious standard. We were left  to the guidance of our own understanding, and the casual impressions  which society might make upon us. My friend's temper, as well as my own,  exempted us from much anxiety on this account. It must not be supposed  that we were without religion, but with us it was the product of  lively feelings, excited by reflection on our own happiness, and by the  grandeur of external nature. We sought not a basis for our faith, in  the weighing of proofs, and the dissection of creeds. Our devotion was  a mixed and casual sentiment, seldom verbally expressed, or solicitously  sought, or carefully retained. In the midst of present enjoyment,  no thought was bestowed on the future. As a consolation in calamity  religion is dear. But calamity was yet at a distance, and its only  tendency was to heighten enjoyments which needed not this addition to  satisfy every craving.    My brother's situation was somewhat different. His deportment was grave,  considerate, and thoughtful. I will not say whether he was indebted to  sublimer views for this disposition. Human life, in his opinion, was  made up of changeable elements, and the principles of duty were not  easily unfolded. The future, either as anterior, or subsequent to death,  was a scene that required some preparation and provision to be made for  it. These positions we could not deny, but what distinguished him was a  propensity to ruminate on these truths. The images that visited us were  blithsome and gay, but those with which he was most familiar were of  an opposite hue. They did not generate affliction and fear, but they  diffused over his behaviour a certain air of forethought and sobriety.  The principal effect of this temper was visible in his features and  tones. These, in general, bespoke a sort of thrilling melancholy. I  scarcely ever knew him to laugh. He never accompanied the lawless mirth  of his companions with more than a smile, but his conduct was the same  as ours.    He partook of our occupations and amusements with a zeal not less than  ours, but of a different kind. The diversity in our temper was never  the parent of discord, and was scarcely a topic of regret. The scene  was variegated, but not tarnished or disordered by it. It hindered the  element in which we moved from stagnating. Some agitation and concussion  is requisite"]]]
