The country called HELLAS by the Helle'nes, its native inhabitants,  and known to us by the name of Greece, forms the southern part  of the most easterly of the three great peninsulas of Southern  Europe, extending into the Mediterranean between the AEge'an Sea,  or Grecian Archipelago, on the east, and the Ionian Sea on the  west. The whole area of this country, so renowned in history, is  only about twenty thousand square miles; which is considerably  less than that of Portugal, and less than half that of the State  of Pennsylvania.    The mainland of ancient Greece was naturally divided into Northern  Greece, which embraced Thessaly and Epi'rus; Central Greece,  comprising the divisions of Acarna'nia, AEto'lia, Lo'cris, Do'ris,  Pho'cis, Breo'tia, and At'tica (the latter forming the eastern  extremity of the whole peninsula); and Southern Greece, which the  ancients called Pel-o-pon-ne'sus, or the Island of Pe'lops, which  would be an island were it not for the narrow Isthmus of Corinth,  which connects it on the north with Central Greece. Its modern  name, the Mo-re'a, was bestowed upon it from its resemblance to  the leaf of the mulberry. The chief political divisions of  Peloponnesus were Corinth and Acha'ia on the north, Ar'golis on  the east, Laco'nia and Messe'nia at the southern extremity of  the peninsula, E'lis on the west, and the central region of Arca'dia.    Greece proper is separated from Macedonia on the north by the  Ceraunian and Cambunian chain of mountains, extending in irregular  outline from the Ionian Sea on the west to the Therma'ic Gulf on  the east, terminating, on the eastern coast, in the lofty summit  of Mount Olympus, the fabled residence of the gods, where, in  the early dawn of history, Jupiter (called \"the father of gods  and men\") was said to hold his court, and where he reigned supreme  over heaven and earth. Olympus rises abruptly, in colossal  magnificence, to a height of more than six thousand feet, lifting  its snowy head far above the belt of clouds that nearly always  hangs upon the sides of the mountain.      Wild and august in consecrated pride,    There through the deep-blue heaven Olympus towers,    Girdled with mists, light-floating as to hide    The rock-built palace of immortal powers.      --HEMANS.    In the Olympian range, also, was Mount Pie'rus, where was the  Pierian fountain, one of the sacred resorts of the Muses, so  often mentioned by the poets, and to which POPE, with gentle  sarcasm, refers when he says,      A little learning is a dangerous thing:    Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring.    1. Thessaly.--From the northern chain of mountains, the central  Pindus range, running south, separates Thessaly on the east from  Epi'rus on the west. The former region, enclosed by mountain  ranges broken only on the east, and watered by the Pene'us and  its numerous tributaries, embraced the largest and most fertile  plain in all Greece. On the Thessalian coast, south of Olympus,  were the celebrated mounts Ossa and Pe'lion, which the giants,  in their wars against the gods, as the poets fable, piled upon  Olympus in their daring attempt to scale the heavens and dethrone  the gods. Between those mounts lay the celebrated vale of Tem'pe,  through which the Pene'us flowed to the sea.      Romantic Tempe! thou art yet the same--    Wild as when sung by bards of elder time:    Years, that have changed thy river's classic name,    [Footnote: The modern name of the Pene'us is Selembria    or Salamvria.]    Have left thee still in savage pomp sublime.      --HEMANS.    Farther south, having the sea on one side and the lofty cliffs  of Mount OE'ta on the other, was the celebrated narrow pass of  Thermop'ylae, leading from Thessaly into Central Greece.    2. Epi'rus.--The country of Epirus, on the west of Thessaly, was  mostly a wild and mountainous region, but with fertile intervening  valleys. Among the localities of Epirus celebrated in fable and  in song was the river Cocy'tus, which the poets, on account of  its nauseous waters, described as one of the rivers of the lower  world--      Cocytus, named of lamentation loud    Heard on the rueful stream.    The Ach'eron was another of the rivers--      Sad Acheron of sorrow, black and deep--      --MILTON.    which was assigned by the poets to the lower world, and over  which the souls of the dead were said to be first conveyed, before  they were borne the Le'the, or \"stream of oblivion,\" beyond. The  true Acheron of Epirus has been thus described:      Yonder rolls Acheron his dismal stream,    Sunk in a narrow bed: cypress and fir    Wave their dim foliage on his rugged banks;    And underneath their boughs the parched ground,    Strewed o'er with juniper and withered leaves,    Seems blasted by no mortal tread.    As the Acheron falls into the lake Acheru'sia, and after rising  from it flows underground for some distance, this lake also has  been connected by the poets with the gloomy legend of its fountain  stream.                          This is the place    Sung by the ancient masters of the lyre,    Where disembodied spirits, ere they left    Their earthly mansions, lingered for a time    Upon the confines of eternal night,    Mourning their doom; and oft the astonished hind,    As home he journeyed at the fall of eve,    Viewed unknown forms flitting across his path,    And in the breeze that waved the sighing boughs    Heard shrieks of woe.      --HAYGARTH.    In Epirus was also situated the celebrated city of Dodo'na, with  the temple of that name, where was the most ancient oracle in  Greece, whose fame extended even to Asia. But in the wide waste  of centuries even the site of this once famous oracle is forgotten.      Where, now, Dodona! is thine aged grove,    Prophetic fount, and oracle divine?    What valley echoes the response of Jove?    What trace remaineth of the Thunderer's shrine?    All, all forgotten!      --BYRON.    3. Acarna'nia.--Coming now to Central Greece, lying northward  of the Corinthian Gulf, we find Acarnania on the far west, for  the most part a productive country with good harbors: but the  Acarnanians, a rude and warlike people, were little inclined to  Commercial pursuits; they remained far behind the rest of the  Greeks in culture, and scarcely one city of importance was embraced  within their territory.    4. AEto'lia, generally a rough and mountainous country, separated,  on the west, from Acarnania by the river Ach-e-lo'us, the largest  of the rivers of Greece, was inhabited, like Acarnania, by a hardy  and warlike race, who long preserved the wild and uncivilized  habits of a barbarous age. The river Achelous was intimately  connected with the religion and mythology of the Greeks. The hero  Hercules contended with the river-god for the hand of De-i-a-ni'ra,  the most beautiful woman of his time; and so famous was the stream  itself that the Oracle of Dodona gave frequent directions \"to  sacrifice to the Achelous,\" whose very name was used, in the  language of poetry, as an appellation for the element of water  and for rivers.    5. Lo'cris, lying along the Corinthian Gulf east of AEtolia, was  inhabited by a wild, uncivilized race, scarcely Hellen'ic in  character, and said to have been addicted, from the earliest  period, to theft and rapine. Their two principal towns were  Amphis'sa and Naupac'tus, the latter now called Lepanto. There  was another settlement of the Locri north of Pho'cis and Boeo'tia.    6. Do'ris, a small territory in the north-eastern angle of AEtolia  proper--a rough but fertile country--was the early seat of the  Dorians, the most enterprising and the most powerful of the Hellenic  tribes, if we take into account their numerous migrations, colonies  and conquests. Their colonies in Asia Minor founded six independent  republics, which were confined within the bounds of as many cities.  From this people the Doric order of architecture--a style typical  of majesty and imposing grandeur, and the one the most employed  by the Greeks in the construction of their temples--derived its  origin.    7. Pho'cis.--On the east of Locris, AEtolia, and Doris was Phocis,  a mountainous region, bordered on the south by the Corinthian  Gulf. In the northern central part of its territory was the famed  Mount Parnassus, covered the greater part of the year with snow,  with its sacred cave, and its Castalian fount gushing forth between  two of its lofty rocks. The waters were said to inspire those who  drank of them with the gift of poetry. Hence both mountain and  fount were sacred to the Muses, and their names have come down  to our own times as synonymous with poetry and song. BYRON thus  writes of Parnassus, in lines almost of veneration, as he first  viewed it from Delphi, on the southern base of the mountain:      Oh, thou Parnassus! whom I now survey,    Not in the frenzy of a dreamer's eye,    Not in the fabled landscape of a lay,    But soaring snow-clad through thy native sky    In the wild pomp of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6852"],[0,"Venus in Furs (#4)"],[1," verses from Goethe, which I recently found in his paralipomena  to _Faust_.      TO AMOR      \"The pair of wings a fiction are,     The arrows, they are naught but claws,     The wreath conceals the little horns,     For without any doubt he is     Like all the gods of ancient Greece     Only a devil in disguise.\"    Then I put the picture before me on my table, supporting it with a  book, and looked at it.    I was enraptured and at the same time filled with a strange fear by  the cold coquetry with which this magnificent woman draped her charms  in her furs of dark sable; by the severity and hardness which lay in  this cold marble-like face. Again I took my pen in hand, and wrote  the following words:    \"To love, to be loved, what happiness! And yet how the glamour of  this pales in comparison with the tormenting bliss of worshipping a  woman who makes a plaything out of us, of being the slave of a  beautiful tyrant who treads us pitilessly underfoot. Even Samson, the  hero, the giant, again put himself into the hands of Delilah, even  after she had betrayed him, and again she betrayed him, and the  Philistines bound him and put out his eyes which until the very end  he kept fixed, drunken with rage and love, upon the beautiful  betrayer.\"    I was breakfasting in my honey-suckle arbor, and reading in the Book  of Judith. I envied the hero Holofernes because of the regal woman  who cut off his head with a sword, and because of his beautiful  sanguinary end.    \"The almighty Lord hath struck him, and hath delivered him into the  hands of a woman.\"    This sentence strangely impressed me.    How ungallant these Jews are, I thought. And their God might choose  more becoming expressions when he speaks of the fair sex.    \"The almighty Lord hath struck him, and hath delivered him into the  hands of a woman,\" I repeated to myself. What shall I do, so that He  may punish me?    Heaven preserve us! Here comes the housekeeper, who has again  diminished somewhat in size overnight. And up there among the green  twinings and garlandings the white gown gleams again. Is it Venus,  or the widow?    This time it happens to be the widow, for Madame Tartakovska makes  a courtesy, and asks me in her name for something to read. I run to  my room, and gather together a couple of volumes.    Later I remember that my picture of Venus is in one of them, and now  it and my effusions are in the hands of the white woman up there  together. What will she say?    I hear her laugh.    Is she laughing at me?    It is full moon. It is already peering over the tops of the low  hemlocks that fringe the park. A silvery exhalation fills the  terrace, the groups of trees, all the landscape, as far as the eye  can reach; in the distance it gradually fades away, like trembling  waters.    I cannot resist. I feel a strange urge and call within me. I put on  my clothes again and go out into the garden.    Some power draws me toward the meadow, toward her, who is my  divinity and my beloved.    The night is cool. I feel a slight chill. The atmosphere is heavy  with the odor of flowers and of the forest. It intoxicates.    What solemnity! What music round about! A nightingale sobs. The  stars quiver very faintly in the pale-blue glamour. The meadow seems  smooth, like a mirror, like a covering of ice on a pond.    The statue of Venus stands out august and luminous.    But--what has happened? From the marble shoulders of the goddess a  large dark fur flows down to her heels. I stand dumbfounded and stare  at her in amazement; again an indescribable fear seizes hold of me  and I take flight.    I hasten my steps, and notice that I have missed the main path. As  I am about to turn aside into one of the green walks I see Venus  sitting before me on a stone bench, not the beautiful woman of  marble, but the goddess of love herself with warm blood and throbbing  pulses. She has actually come to life for me, like the statue that  began to breathe for her creator. Indeed, the miracle is only half  completed. Her white hair seems still to be of stone, and her white  gown shimmers like moonlight, or is it satin? From her shoulders the  dark fur flows. But her lips are already reddening and her cheeks  begin to take color. Two diabolical green rays out of her eyes fall  upon me, and now she laughs.    Her laughter is very mysterious, very--I don't know. It cannot be  described, it takes my breath away. I flee further, and after every  few steps I have to pause to take breath. The mocking laughter  pursues me through the dark leafy paths, across light open spaces,  through the thicket where only single moonbeams can pierce. I can no  longer find my way, I wander about utterly confused, with cold drops  of perspiration on the forehead.    Finally I stand still, and engage in a short monologue.    It runs--well--one is either very polite to one's self or very rude.    I say to myself:    \"Donkey!\"    This word exercises a remarkable effect, like a magic formula, which  sets me free and makes me master of myself.    I am perfectly quiet in a moment.    With considerable pleasure I repeat: \"Donkey!\"    Now everything is perfectly clear and distinct before my eyes again.  There is the fountain, there the alley of box-wood, there the house  which I am slowly approaching.    Yet--suddenly the appearance is here again. Behind the green screen  through which the moonlight gleams so that it seems embroidered with  silver, I again see the white figure, the woman of stone whom I  adore, whom I fear and flee.    With a couple of leaps I am within the house and catch my breath and  reflect.    What am I really, a little dilettante or a great big donkey?    A sultry morning, the atmosphere is dead, heavily laden with odors,  yet stimulating. Again I am sitting in my honey-suckle arbor, reading  in the Odyssey about the beautiful witch who transformed her admirers  into beasts. A wonderful picture of antique love.    There is a soft rustling in the twigs and blades and the pages of my  book rustle and on the terrace likewise there is a rustling.    A woman's dress--    She is there--Venus--but without furs--No, this time it is merely  the widow--and yet--Venus-oh, what a woman!    As she stands there in her light white morning gown, looking at me, her  slight figure seems full of poetry and grace. She is neither large, nor  small; her head is alluring, piquant--in the sense of the period of the  French marquises--rather than formally beautiful. What enchantment and  softness, what roguish charm play about her none too small mouth! Her  skin is so infinitely delicate, that the blue veins show through  everywhere; even through the muslin covering her arms and bosom. How  abundant her red hair-it is red, not blonde or golden-yellow--how  diabolically and yet tenderly it plays around her neck! Now her eyes  meet mine like green lightnings--they are green, these eyes of hers,  whose power is so indescribable--green, but as are precious stones, or  deep unfathomable mountain lakes.    She observes my confusion, which has even made me discourteous, for I  have remained seated and still have my cap on my head.    She smiles roguishly.    Finally I rise and bow to her. She comes closer, and bursts out into  a loud, almost childlike laughter. I stammer, as only a little  dilettante or great big donkey can do on such an occasion.    Thus our acquaintance began.    The divinity asks for my name, and mentions her own.    Her name is Wanda von Dunajew.    And she is actually my Venus.    \"But madame, what put the idea into your head?\"    \"The little picture in one of your books--\"    \"I had forgotten about it.\"    \"The curious notes on its back--\"    \"Why curious?\"    She looked at me.    \"I have always wanted to know a real dreamer some time--for the sake  of the change--and you seem one of the maddest of the tribe.\"    \"Dear lady--in fact--\" Again I fell victim to an odious, asinine  stammering, and in addition blushed in a way that might have been  appropriate for a youngster of sixteen, but not for me, who was  almost a full ten years older--    \"You were afraid of me last night.\"    \"Really--of course--but won't you sit down?\"    She sat down, and enjoyed my embarrassment--for actually I was even  more afraid of her now in the full light of day. A delightful  expression of contempt hovered about her upper lip.    \"You look at love, and especially woman,\" she began, \"as something  hostile, something against which you put up a defense, even if  unsuccessfully. You feel that their power over you gives you a  sensation of pleasurable torture, of pungent cruelty. This is a  genuinely modern point of view.\"    \"You don't share it?\"    \"I do not share it,\" she said quickly and decisively, shaking her  head, so that her curls flew up like red flames.    \"The ideal which I strive to realize in my life is the serene  sensuousness of the Greeks--pleasure without pain. I do not believe  in the kind of love which is preached by Christianity, by the  moderns, by the knights of the spirit. Yes, look at me, I am worse  than a heretic, I am a pagan.      'Doest thou imagine long the goddess of love took counsel     When in Ida's grove she was pleased with the hero Achilles?'    \"These lines from Goethe's _Roman Elegy_ have always delighted me.    \"In nature there is only the love of the heroic age, 'when gods and  goddesses loved.' At that time 'desire followed the glance, enjoyment  desire.' All else is factitious, affected, a lie. Christianity, whose  cruel emblem, the cross, has always had for me an element of the  monstrous, brought something alien and hostile into nature and its  innocent instincts.    \"The battle of the spirit with the senses is the gospel of modern  man. I do not care to have a share in it.\"    \"Yes, Mount Olympus would be the place for you, madame,\" I replied,  \"but we moderns can no longer support the antique serenity, least of  all in love. The idea of sharing a woman,"]]]
