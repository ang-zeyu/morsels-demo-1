We explained to her why murderers have to be hanged, but she only said,  'I don't care. I'm sure no one would ever do murdering _twice_. Think  of the blood and things, and what you would see when you woke up in the  night! I shouldn't mind being a detective to lie in wait for a gang  of coiners, now, and spring upon them unawares, and secure  them--single-handed, you know, or with only my faithful bloodhound.'    She stroked Pincher's ears, but he had gone to sleep because he knew  well enough that all the suet pudding was finished. He is a very  sensible dog. 'You always get hold of the wrong end of the stick,'  Oswald said. 'You can't choose what crimes you'll be a detective about.  You just have to get a suspicious circumstance, and then you look for a  clue and follow it up. Whether it turns out a murder or a missing will  is just a fluke.'    'That's one way,' Dicky said. 'Another is to get a paper and find  two advertisements or bits of news that fit. Like this: \"Young Lady  Missing,\" and then it tells about all the clothes she had on, and the  gold locket she wore, and the colour of her hair, and all that; and then  in another piece of the paper you see, \"Gold locket found,\" and then it  all comes out.'    We sent H. O. for the paper at once, but we could not make any of the  things fit in. The two best were about how some burglars broke into  a place in Holloway where they made preserved tongues and invalid  delicacies, and carried off a lot of them. And on another page there  was, 'Mysterious deaths in Holloway.'    Oswald thought there was something in it, and so did Albert's uncle when  we asked him, but the others thought not, so Oswald agreed to drop it.  Besides, Holloway is a long way off. All the time we were talking about  the paper Alice seemed to be thinking about something else, and when we  had done she said--    'I believe we might be detectives ourselves, but I should not like to  get anybody into trouble.'    'Not murderers or robbers?' Dicky asked.    'It wouldn't be murderers,' she said; 'but I _have_ noticed something  strange. Only I feel a little frightened. Let's ask Albert's uncle  first.'    Alice is a jolly sight too fond of asking grown-up people things. And we  all said it was tommyrot, and she was to tell us.    'Well, promise you won't do anything without me,' Alice said, and we  promised. Then she said--    'This is a dark secret, and any one who thinks it is better not to be  involved in a career of crime-discovery had better go away ere yet it be  too late.'    So Dora said she had had enough of tents, and she was going to look at  the shops. H. O. went with her because he had twopence to spend. They  thought it was only a game of Alice's but Oswald knew by the way she  spoke. He can nearly always tell. And when people are not telling the  truth Oswald generally knows by the way they look with their eyes.  Oswald is not proud of being able to do this. He knows it is through no  merit of his own that he is much cleverer than some people.    When they had gone, the rest of us got closer together and said--    'Now then.'    'Well,' Alice said, 'you know the house next door? The people have gone  to Scarborough. And the house is shut up. But last night _I saw a light  in the windows_.'    We asked her how and when, because her room is in the front, and she  couldn't possibly have seen. And then she said--    'I'll tell you if you boys will promise not ever to go fishing again  without me.'    So we had to promise.    Then she said--    'It was last night. I had forgotten to feed my rabbits and I woke up and  remembered it. And I was afraid I should find them dead in the morning,  like Oswald did.'    'It wasn't my fault,' Oswald said; 'there was something the matter with  the beasts. I fed them right enough.'    Alice said she didn't mean that, and she went on--    'I came down into the garden, and I saw a light in the house, and dark  figures moving about. I thought perhaps it was burglars, but Father  hadn't come home, and Eliza had gone to bed, so I couldn't do anything.  Only I thought perhaps I would tell the rest of you.'    'Why didn't you tell us this morning?' Noel asked. And Alice explained  that she did not want to get any one into trouble, even burglars. 'But  we might watch to-night,' she said, 'and see if we see the light again.'    'They might have been burglars,' Noel said. He was sucking the last bit  of his macaroni. 'You know the people next door are very grand. They  won't know us--and they go out in a real private carriage sometimes. And  they have an \"At Home\" day, and people come in cabs. I daresay they have  piles of plate and jewellery and rich brocades, and furs of price and  things like that. Let us keep watch to-night.'    'It's no use watching to-night,' Dicky said; 'if it's only burglars they  won't come again. But there are other things besides burglars that are  discovered in empty houses where lights are seen moving.'    'You mean coiners,' said Oswald at once. 'I wonder what the reward is  for setting the police on their track?'    Dicky thought it ought to be something fat, because coiners are always  a desperate gang; and the machinery they make the coins with is so heavy  and handy for knocking down detectives.    Then it was tea-time, and we went in; and Dora and H. O. had clubbed  their money together and bought a melon; quite a big one, and only a  little bit squashy at one end. It was very good, and then we washed the  seeds and made things with them and with pins and cotton. And nobody  said any more about watching the house next door.    Only when we went to bed Dicky took off his coat and waistcoat, but he  stopped at his braces, and said--    'What about the coiners?'    Oswald had taken off his collar and tie, and he was just going to say  the same, so he said, 'Of course I meant to watch, only my collar's  rather tight, so I thought I'd take it off first.'    Dicky said he did not think the girls ought to be in it, because there  might be danger, but Oswald reminded him that they had promised Alice,  and that a promise is a sacred thing, even when you'd much rather  not. So Oswald got Alice alone under pretence of showing her a  caterpillar--Dora does not like them, and she screamed and ran away when  Oswald offered to show it her. Then Oswald explained, and Alice agreed  to come and watch if she could. This made us later than we ought to have  been, because Alice had to wait till Dora was quiet and then creep out  very slowly, for fear of the boards creaking. The girls sleep with their  room-door open for fear of burglars. Alice had kept on her clothes  under her nightgown when Dora wasn't looking, and presently we got down,  creeping past Father's study, and out at the glass door that leads on  to the veranda and the iron steps into the garden. And we went down very  quietly, and got into the chestnut-tree; and then I felt that we had  only been playing what Albert's uncle calls our favourite instrument--I  mean the Fool. For the house next door was as dark as dark. Then  suddenly we heard a sound--it came from the gate at the end of the  garden. All the gardens have gates; they lead into a kind of lane that  runs behind them. It is a sort of back way, very convenient when you  don't want to say exactly where you are going. We heard the gate at the  end of the next garden click, and Dicky nudged Alice so that she  would have fallen out of the tree if it had not been for Oswald's  extraordinary presence of mind. Oswald squeezed Alice's arm tight, and  we all looked; and the others were rather frightened because really we  had not exactly expected anything to happen except perhaps a light. But  now a muffled figure, shrouded in a dark cloak, came swiftly up the  path of the next-door garden. And we could see that under its cloak the  figure carried a mysterious burden. The figure was dressed to look like  a woman in a sailor hat.    We held our breath as it passed under the tree where we were, and then  it tapped very gently on the back door and was let in, and then a light  appeared in the window of the downstairs back breakfast-room. But the  shutters were up.    Dicky said, 'My eye!' and wouldn't the others be sick to think they  hadn't been in this! But Alice didn't half like it--and as she is a girl  I do not blame her. Indeed, I thought myself at first that perhaps  it would be better to retire for the present, and return later with a  strongly armed force.    'It's not burglars,' Alice whispered; 'the mysterious stranger was  bringing things in, not taking them out. They must be coiners--and oh,  Oswald!--don't let's! The things they coin with must hurt very much. Do  let's go to bed!'    But Dicky said he was going to see; if there was a reward for finding  out things like this he would like to have the reward.    'They locked the back door,' he whispered, 'I heard it go. And I could  look in quite well through the holes in the shutters and be back over  the wall long before they'd got the door open, even if they started to  do it at once.'    There were holes at the top of the shutters the shape of hearts, and the  yellow light came out through them as well as through the chinks of the  shutters.    Oswald said if Dicky went he should, because he was the eldest; and  Alice said, 'If any one goes it ought to be me, because I thought of  it.'    So Oswald said, 'Well, go then'; and she said, 'Not for anything!' And  she begged us not to, and we talked about it in the tree till we were  all quite hoarse with whispering.    At last we decided on a plan of action.    Alice was to stay in the tree, and scream 'Murder!' if anything  happened. Dicky and I were to get down into the next garden and take it  in turns to peep.    So we got down as quietly as we could, but the tree made much more noise  than it does in the day, and several times we paused, fearing that all  was discovered.

Cleomenes himself was hurtled out in sore defeat.  His stiff-backed Spartan pride was bent.  Out, stripped of all his arms, he went:  A pigmy cloak that would not stretch  To hide his rump (the draggled wretch),  Six sprouting years of beard, the spilth  Of six years' filth.    That was a siege! Our men were ranged in lines of seventeen deep  Before the gates, and never left their posts there, even to sleep.  Shall I not smite the rash presumption then of foes like these,  Detested both of all the gods and of Euripides--  Else, may the Marathon-plain not boast my trophied victories!    Ah, now, there's but a little space  To reach the place!  A deadly climb it is, a tricky road  With all this bumping load:  A pack-ass soon would tire....  How these logs bruise my shoulders! further still  Jog up the hill,  And puff the fire inside,  Or just as we reach the top we'll find it's died.  Ough, phew!  I choke with the smoke.    Lord Heracles, how acrid-hot  Out of the pot  This mad-dog smoke leaps, worrying me  And biting angrily....  'Tis Lemnian fire that smokes,  Or else it would not sting my eyelids thus....  Haste, all of us;  Athene invokes our aid.  Laches, now or never the assault must be made!  Ough, phew!  I choke with the smoke. ..    Thanked be the gods! The fire peeps up and crackles as it should.  Now why not first slide off our backs these weary loads of wood  And dip a vine-branch in the brazier till it glows, then straight  Hurl it at the battering-ram against the stubborn gate?  If they refuse to draw the bolts in immediate compliance,  We'll set fire to the wood, and smoke will strangle their defiance.    Phew, what a spluttering drench of smoke! Come, now from off my back....  Is there no Samos-general to help me to unpack?  Ah there, that's over! For the last time now it's galled my shoulder.  Flare up thine embers, brazier, and dutifully smoulder,  To kindle a brand, that I the first may strike the citadel.  Aid me, Lady Victory, that a triumph-trophy may tell  How we did anciently this insane audacity quell!    _Chorus of_ WOMEN.    What's that rising yonder? That ruddy glare, that smoky skurry?  O is it something in a blaze? Quick, quick, my comrades, hurry!  Nicodice, helter-skelter!  Or poor Calyce's in flames  And Cratylla's stifled in the welter.  O these dreadful old men  And their dark laws of hate!  There, I'm all of a tremble lest I turn out to be too late.  I could scarcely get near to the spring though I rose before dawn,  What with tattling of tongues and rattling of pitchers in one jostling din  With slaves pushing in!....    Still here at last the water's drawn  And with it eagerly I run  To help those of my friends who stand  In danger of being burned alive.  For I am told a dribbling band  Of greybeards hobble to the field,  Great faggots in each palsied hand,  As if a hot bath to prepare,  And threatening that out they'll drive  These wicked women or soon leave them charring into ashes  there.  O Goddess, suffer not, I pray, this harsh deed to be done,  But show us Greece and Athens with their warlike acts repealed!  For this alone, in this thy hold,  Thou Goddess with the helm of gold,  We laid hands on thy sanctuary,  Athene.... Then our ally be  And where they cast their fires of slaughter  Direct our water!    STRATYLLIS (_caught_)    Let me go!    WOMEN    You villainous old men, what's this you do?  No honest man, no pious man, could do such things as you.    MEN    Ah ha, here's something most original, I have no doubt:  A swarm of women sentinels to man the walls without.    WOMEN    So then we scare you, do we? Do we seem a fearful host?  You only see the smallest fraction mustered at this post.    MEN    Ho, Phaedrias, shall we put a stop to all these chattering tricks?  Suppose that now upon their backs we splintered these our sticks?    WOMEN    Let us lay down the pitchers, so our bodies will be free,    In case these lumping fellows try to cause some injury.    MEN    O hit them hard and hit again and hit until they run away,  And perhaps they'll learn, like Bupalus, not to have too much to say.    WOMEN    Come on, then--do it! I won't budge, but like a dog I'll bite  At every little scrap of meat that dangles in my sight.    MEN    Be quiet, or I'll bash you out of any years to come.    WOMEN    Now you just touch Stratyllis with the top-joint of your thumb.    MEN    What vengeance can you take if with my fists your face I beat?    WOMEN    I'll rip you with my teeth and strew your entrails at your feet.    MEN    Now I appreciate Euripides' strange subtlety:  Woman is the most shameless beast of all the beasts that be.    WOMEN    Rhodippe, come, and let's pick up our water-jars once more.    MEN    Ah cursed drab, what have you brought this water for?    WOMEN    What is your fire for then, you smelly corpse? Yourself to burn?    MEN    To build a pyre and make your comrades ready for the urn.    WOMEN    And I've the water to put out your fire immediately.    MEN    What, you put out my fire?    WOMEN    Yes, sirrah, as you soon will see.    MEN    I don't know why I hesitate to roast you with this flame.    WOMEN    If you have any soap you'll go off cleaner than you came.    MEN    Cleaner, you dirty slut?    WOMEN    A nuptial-bath in which to lie!    MEN    Did you hear that insolence?    WOMEN    I'm a free woman, I.    MEN    I'll make you hold your tongue.    WOMEN    Henceforth you'll serve in no more juries.    MEN    Burn off her hair for her.    WOMEN    Now forward, water, quench their furies!    MEN    O dear, O dear!    WOMEN    So ... was it hot?    MEN    Hot! ... Enough, O hold.    WOMEN    Watered, perhaps you'll bloom again--why not?    MEN    Brrr, I'm wrinkled up from shivering with cold.    WOMEN    Next time you've fire you'll warm yourself and leave us to our lot.    MAGISTRATE _enters with attendant_ SCYTHIANS.    MAGISTRATE    Have the luxurious rites of the women glittered  Their libertine show, their drumming tapped out crowds,  The Sabazian Mysteries summoned their mob,  Adonis been wept to death on the terraces,  As I could hear the last day in the Assembly?  For Demostratus--let bad luck befoul him--  Was roaring, \"We must sail for Sicily,\"  While a woman, throwing herself about in a dance  Lopsided with drink, was shrilling out \"Adonis,  Woe for Adonis.\" Then Demostratus shouted,  \"We must levy hoplites at Zacynthus,\"  And there the woman, up to the ears in wine,  Was screaming \"Weep for Adonis\" on the house-top,  The scoundrelly politician, that lunatic ox,  Bellowing bad advice through tipsy shrieks:  Such are the follies wantoning in them.    MEN    O if you knew their full effrontery!  All of the insults they've done, besides sousing us  With water from their pots to our public disgrace  For we stand here wringing our clothes like grown-up infants.    MAGISTRATE    By Poseidon, justly done! For in part with us  The blame must lie for dissolute behaviour  And for the pampered appetites they learn.  Thus grows the seedling lust to blossoming:  We go into a shop and say, \"Here, goldsmith,  You remember the necklace that you wrought my wife;  Well, the other night in fervour of a dance  Her clasp broke open. Now I'm off for Salamis;  If you've the leisure, would you go tonight  And stick a bolt-pin into her opened clasp.\"  Another goes to a cobbler; a soldierly fellow,  Always standing up erect, and says to him,  \"Cobbler, a sandal-strap of my wife's pinches her,  Hurts her little toe in a place where she's sensitive.  Come at noon and see if you can stretch out wider  This thing that troubles her, loosen its tightness.\"  And so you view the result. Observe my case--  I, a magistrate, come here to draw  Money to buy oar-blades, and what happens?  The women slam the door full in my face.  But standing still's no use. Bring me a crowbar,  And I'll chastise this their impertinence.  What do you gape at, wretch, with dazzled eyes?  Peering for a tavern, I suppose.  Come, force the gates with crowbars, prise them apart!  I'll prise away myself too.... (LYSISTRATA _appears._)    LYSISTRATA    Stop this banging.  I'm coming of my own accord.... Why bars?  It is not bars we need but common sense.    MAGISTRATE    Indeed, you slut! Where is the archer now?  Arrest this woman, tie her hands behind.    LYSISTRATA    If he brushes me with a finger, by Artemis,  The public menial, he'll be sorry for it.    MAGISTRATE    Are you afraid? Grab her about the middle.  Two of you then, lay hands on her and end it.    CALONICE    By Pandrosos I if your hand touches her  I'll spread you out and trample on your guts.    MAGISTRATE    My guts! Where is the other archer gone?  Bind that minx there who talks so prettily.    MYRRHINE    By Phosphor, if your hand moves out her way  You'd better have a surgeon somewhere handy.    MAGISTRATE    You too! Where is that archer? Take that woman.  I'll put a stop to these surprise-parties.    STRATYLLIS    By the Tauric Artemis, one inch nearer  My fingers, and it's a bald man that'll be yelling.    MAGISTRATE    Tut tut, what's here? Deserted by my archers....  But surely women never can defeat us;  Close up your ranks, my Scythians. Forward at them.    LYSISTRATA    By the Goddesses, you'll find that here await you  Four companies of most pugnacious women  Armed cap-a-pie from the topmost louring curl  To the lowest angry dimple.    MAGISTRATE    On, Scythians, bind them.    LYSISTRATA    On, gallant allies of our high design,  Vendors of grain-eggs-pulse-and-vegetables,  Ye garlic-tavern-keepers of bakeries,  Strike, batter, knock, hit, slap, and scratch our foes,  Be finely imprudent, say what you think of them....  Enough! retire and do not rob the dead.    MAGISTRATE    How basely did my archer-force come off.    LYSISTRATA    Ah, ha, you thought it was a herd of slaves  You had to"]]]
