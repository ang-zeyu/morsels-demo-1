He stopped every little while to listen, and at one of these intervals  he heard a sound that drew from him a responsive and joyous whine. It  was a distant howl--a wolf's howl--straight ahead of him. Baree was not  thinking of wolves but of Kazan, and he ran through the gloom of the  forest until he was winded. Then he stopped and listened a long time.  The wolf howl did not come again. Instead of it there rolled up from  the west a deep and thunderous rumble. Through the tree-tops there  flashed a vivid streak of lightning. A moaning whisper of wind rode in  advance of the storm. The thunder sounded nearer; and a second flash of  lightning seemed searching Baree out where he stood shivering under a  canopy of great spruce.    This was his second storm. The first had frightened him terribly, and  he had crawled far back into the shelter of the windfall. The best he  could find now was a hollow under a big root, and into this he slunk,  crying softly. It was a babyish cry, a cry for his mother, for home,  for warmth, for something soft and protecting to nestle up to. And as  he cried, the storm burst over the forest.    Baree had never before heard so much noise, and he had never seen the  lightning play in such sheets of fire as when this June deluge fell. It  seemed at times as though the whole world were aflame, and the earth  seemed to shake and roll under the crashes of the thunder. He ceased  his crying and made himself as small as he could under the root, which  protected him partly from the terrific beat of the rain which came down  through the treetops in a flood. It was now so black that except when  the lightning ripped great holes in the gloom he could not see the  spruce trunks twenty feet away. Twice that distance from Baree there  was a huge dead stub that stood out like a ghost each time the fires  swept the sky, as if defying the flaming hands up there to strike--and  strike, at last, one of them did! A bluish tongue of snapping flame ran  down the old stub; and as it touched the earth, there came a tremendous  explosion above the treetops. The massive stub shivered, and then it  broke asunder as if cloven by a gigantic ax. It crashed down so close  to Baree that earth and sticks flew about him, and he let out a wild  yelp of terror as he tried to crowd himself deeper into the shallow  hole under the root.    With the destruction of the old stub the thunder and lightning seemed  to have vented their malevolence. The thunder passed on into the south  and east like the rolling of ten thousand heavy cart wheels over the  roofs of the forest, and the lightning went with it. The rain fell  steadily. The hole in which he had taken shelter was partly filled with  water. He was drenched. His teeth chattered as he waited for the next  thing to happen.    It was a long wait. When the rain finally stopped, and the sky cleared,  it was night. Through the tops of the trees Baree could have seen the  stars if he had poked out his head and looked upward. But he clung to  his hole. Hour after hour passed. Exhausted, half drowned, footsore,  and hungry, he did not move. At last he fell into a troubled sleep, a  sleep in which every now and then he cried softly and forlornly for his  mother. When he ventured out from under the root it was morning, and  the sun was shining.    At first Baree could hardly stand. His legs were cramped. Every bone in  his body seemed out of joint. His ear was stiff where the blood had  oozed out of it and hardened, and when he tried to wrinkle his wounded  nose, he gave a sharp little yap of pain. If such a thing were  possible, he looked even worse than he felt. His hair had dried in  muddy patches; he was dirt-stained from end to end; and where yesterday  he had been plump and shiny, he was now as thin and wretched as  misfortune could possibly make him. And he was hungry. He had never  before known what it meant to be really hungry.    When he went on, continuing in the direction he had been following  yesterday, he slunk along in a disheartened sort of way. His head and  ears were no longer alert, and his curiosity was gone. He was not only  stomach hungry: mother hunger rose above his physical yearning for  something to eat. He wanted his mother as he had never wanted her  before in his life. He wanted to snuggle his shivering little body  close up to her and feel the warm caressing of her tongue and listen to  the mothering whine of her voice. And he wanted Kazan, and the old  windfall, and that big blue spot that was in the sky right over it. As  he followed again along the edge of the creek, he whimpered for them as  a child might grieve.    The forest grew more open after a time, and this cheered him up a  little. Also the warmth of the sun was taking the ache out of his body.  But he grew hungrier and hungrier. He always had depended entirely on  Kazan and Gray Wolf for food. His parents had, in some ways, made a  great baby of him. Gray Wolf's blindness accounted for this, for since  his birth she had not taken up her hunting with Kazan, and it was quite  natural that Baree should stick close to her, though more than once he  had been filled with a great yearning to follow his father. Nature was  hard at work trying to overcome its handicap now. It was struggling to  impress on Baree that the time had now come when he must seek his own  food. The fact impinged itself upon him slowly but steadily, and he  began to think of the three or four shellfish he had caught and  devoured on the stony creek bar near the windfall. He also remembered  the open clamshell he had found, and the lusciousness of the tender  morsel inside it. A new excitement began to possess him. He became, all  at once, a hunter.    With the thinning out of the forest the creek grew more shallow. It ran  again over bars of sand and stones, and Baree began to nose along the  edge of the shallows. For a long time he had no success. The few  crayfish that he saw were exceedingly lively and elusive, and all the  clamshells were shut so tight that even Kazan's powerful jaws would  have had difficulty in smashing them. It was almost noon when he caught  his first crayfish, about as big as a man's forefinger. He devoured it  ravenously. The taste of food gave him fresh courage. He caught two  more crayfish during the afternoon. It was almost dusk when he stirred  a young rabbit out from under a cover of grass. If he had been a month  older, he could have caught it. He was still very hungry, for three  crayfish--scattered through the day--had not done much to fill the  emptiness that was growing steadily in him.    With the approach of night Baree's fears and great loneliness returned.  Before the day had quite gone he found soft bed of sand. Since his  fight with Papayuchisew, he had traveled a long distance, and the rock  under which he made his bed this night was at least eight or nine miles  from the windfall. It was in the open of the creek bottom, with and  when the moon rose, and the stars filled the sky, Baree could look out  and see the water of the stream shimmering in a glow almost as bright  as day. Directly in front of him, running to the water's edge, was a  broad carpet of white sand. Across this sand, half an hour later, came  a huge black bear.    Until Baree had seen the otters at play in the creek, his conceptions  of the forests had not gone beyond his own kind, and such creatures as  owls and rabbits and small feathered things. The otters had not  frightened him, because he still measured things by size, and Nekik was  not half as big as Kazan. But the bear was a monster beside which Kazan  would have stood a mere pygmy. He was big. If nature was taking this  way of introducing Baree to the fact that there were more important  creatures in the forests than dogs and wolves and owls and crayfish,  she was driving the point home with a little more than necessary  emphasis. For Wakayoo, the bear, weighed six hundred pounds if he  weighed an ounce. He was fat and sleek from a month's feasting on fish.  His shiny coat was like black velvet in the moonlight, and he walked  with a curious rolling motion with his head hung low. The horror grew  when he stopped broadside in the carpet of sand not more than ten feet  from the rock under which Baree was shivering.    It was quite evident that Wakayoo had caught scent of him in the air.  Baree could hear him sniff--could hear his breathing--caught the  starlight flashing in his reddish-brown eyes as they swung suspiciously  toward the big boulder. If Baree could have known then that he--his  insignificant little self--was making that monster actually nervous and  uneasy, he would have given a yelp of joy. For Wakayoo, in spite of his  size, was somewhat of a coward when it came to wolves. And Baree  carried the wolf scent. It grew stronger in Wakayoo's nose; and just  then, as if to increase whatever nervousness was growing in him, there  came from out of the forest behind him a long and wailing howl.    With an audible grunt, Wakayoo moved on. Wolves were pests, he argued.  They wouldn't stand up and fight. They'd snap and yap at one's heels  for hours at a time, and were always out of the way quicker than a wink  when one turned on them. What was the use of hanging around where there  were wolves, on a beautiful night like this? He lumbered on decisively.  Baree could hear him splashing heavily through the water of the creek.  Not until then did the wolf dog draw a full breath. It was almost a  gasp.    But the excitement was not over for the night. Baree had chosen his bed  at a place where the animals came down to drink, and where they crossed  from one of the creek forests to the other. Not long after the bear had  disappeared he heard a heavy crunching in the sand, and hoofs rattling  against stones, and a bull moose with a huge sweep of antlers passed  through the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47519"],[0,"President Heber C. Kimball's Journal (#4)"],[1,"  others, have to be baptized himself for the remission of sins by those  who were ordained to that power.    These considerations undoubtedly had their weight upon his mind, and  caused him to act as he did, and notwithstanding his former kindness he  soon became one of our most violent opposers.    An observation which escaped his lips shortly after this circumstance,  I shall here mention. Speaking one day respecting the three first  sermons which were preached in that place, he said that \"Kimball bored  the holes, Goodson drove the nails and Hyde clinched them.\"    However, his congregation did not follow his example; they had for some  time been praying for our coming, and had been assured by Mr. Fielding  that he could not place more confidence in an angel than he did in  the statements of his brother respecting this people. Consequently,  they were in a great measure prepared for the reception of the gospel,  probably as much so as Cornelius was anciently.    Having now no public place to preach in, we began to preach in private  houses, which were opened in every direction, while numbers believed  the gospel. After we had been in that place eight days, we began to  baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus for the remission of sins. One  \"reverend\" gentleman came and forbid us baptizing any of his members;  but we told him that all who were of age and requested baptism we  should undoubtedly administer that ordinance to.    One Saturday evening I was appointed by the brethren to baptize a  number the next morning in the river Ribble, which runs through that  place. By this time, the adversary of souls began to rage, and he felt  a determination to destroy us before we had fully established the  gospel in that land; and the next morning I witnessed such a scene of  satanic power and influence as I shall never forget while memory lasts.    About day-break, Brother Russell (who was appointed to preach in the  market-place that day), who slept in the second story of the house in  which we were entertained, came up to the room where Elder Hyde and I  were sleeping and called upon us to arise and pray for him, for he was  so afflicted with evil spirits that he could not live long unless he  should obtain relief.    We immediately arose, laid hands upon him and prayed that the Lord  would have mercy on His servant and rebuke the devil. While thus  engaged, I was struck with great force by some invisible power and fell  senseless on the floor as if I had been shot, and the first thing that  I recollected was, that I was supported by Brothers Hyde and Russell,  who were beseeching a throne of grace in my behalf. They then laid me  on the bed, but my agony was so great that I could not endure, and I  was obliged to get out, and fell on my knees and began to pray. I then  sat on the bed and could distinctly see the evil spirits, who foamed  and gnashed their teeth upon us. We gazed upon them about an hour and a  half, and I shall never forget the horror and malignity depicted on the  countenances of these foul spirits, and any attempt to paint the scene  which then presented itself, or portray the malice and enmity depicted  in their countenances would be vain.    I perspired exceedingly, and my clothes were as wet as if I had  been taken out of the river. I felt exquisite pain, and was in the  greatest distress for some time. However, I learned by it the power  of the adversary, his enmity against the servants of God and got some  understanding of the invisible world.    The Lord delivered us from the wrath of our spiritual enemies  and blessed us exceedingly that day, and I had the pleasure  (notwithstanding my weakness of body from the shock I had experienced)  of baptizing nine individuals and hailing them brethren in the kingdom  of God.    A circumstance took place while at the water side which I cannot  refrain from mentioning, which will show the eagerness and anxiety of  some in that land to obey the gospel. Two of the candidates who were  changing their clothes and preparing for baptism at the distance of  several rods from the place where I was standing in the water, were so  anxious to obey the gospel, that they ran with all their might to the  water, each wishing to be baptized first. The younger, being quicker on  foot than the elder, out-ran him, and came first into the water. The  circumstance reminded me of Peter and another disciple, who went to see  the sepulchre where the Savior was laid: their anxiety was so great to  find out whether He was yet there or not, that they had a race for it.    The ceremony of baptizing being somewhat novel, a large concourse of  people assembled on the banks of the river to witness the ceremony.    In the afternoon, Elder Russell preached in the market-place, standing  on a pedestal, to a very large congregation, numbers of whom were  pricked to the heart.    Thus the work of the Lord commenced in that land (notwithstanding the  rage of the adversary and his attempt to destroy us)--a work which  shall roll forth, not only in that land but upon all the face of the  earth, even \"in lands and isles unknown.\"    The next morning we held a council, at which Elders Goodson and  Richards were appointed to go to the city of Bedford, there being a  good prospect, from the information received, of a Church being built  up in that city. Elders Russell and Snider were appointed to go to  Alston, in Cumberland, near the borders of Scotland, and Elders Hyde,  Fielding and the writer were to remain in Preston and the regions round  about.    The next day, the brethren took their departure for the different  fields of labor assigned them.    Brothers Hyde, Fielding and I continued lifting up our voices in  private houses, at the corners of the streets, in the market-place and  wherever the Lord opened a door. The following Sabbath, Elder Hyde  preached in the market-place to a numerous assemblage, both rich and  poor, who flocked from all parts to hear \"what these babblers had to  say,\" hearing that we were \"setters forth of strange doctrines.\" After  Brother Hyde had got through, I gave an exhortation, and when I had  concluded, a minister stepped forward to oppose us on the doctrines we  advanced, but more particularly on the doctrine of baptism, he being a  great stickler for infant baptism.    The people, thinking he intended to offend us, would not let him  proceed, but seemed determined to put him down, and undoubtedly would  have done so had not Brother Hyde interposed and begged permission for  the gentleman to speak, telling the congregation that he was prepared  to meet any arguments he might advance. This appeased the people, who  listened to the remarks of the reverend gentleman; after which Brother  Hyde spoke in answer to the objections which had been offered, to the  satisfaction of nearly all present.    The minister felt somewhat ashamed. One individual came up to him and  asked him what he now thought of his \"baby baptism,\" while another  came, took him by the hand and led him out of the throng. Indeed, all  those who arose up to oppose the doctrines we taught were confounded,  and could not with any success combat the truths we preached.        CHAPTER III.    MEETING FOR CONFIRMATION--CONVERT AND BAPTIZE MISS RICHARDS--HER  FATHER, A MINISTER, INVITES ME TO PREACH IN HIS CHAPEL--CONGREGATION  BELIEVE MY TESTIMONY--MR. RICHARDS FRIGHTENED--CLOSES HIS CHAPEL  AGAINST ME--HIS DAUGHTER TROUBLED--I PREDICT THAT HE WILL AGAIN OPEN  HIS CHAPEL TO ME--PREDICTION FULFILLED--OTHER ELDERS ENCOURAGED BY THE  REV. MR. MATTHEWS, WHO AFTERWARDS REJECTS THEIR TESTIMONY AND COMMENCES  PREACHING THEIR DOCTRINES ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT.    Having had considerable success the short time we had labored in that  place, and having baptized a number we requested them to meet at the  house of Sister Dawson for confirmation on the evening of the second  Sabbath after our arrival in Preston.    The people having come together, we fully explained to them the nature  of that ordinance about to be performed. We then laid our hands upon  between forty and fifty for the gift of the Holy Ghost, and confirmed  them members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. While  attending to this ordinance the Spirit of the Lord rested down upon us  in a powerful manner, which caused us to rejoice exceedingly. Thus the  word of the Lord spread and prevailed.    About this time, a young lady, the daughter of a minister of the  Presbyterian order, who resided about fifteen miles from Preston, being  on a visit to that place, happened to be at the house of a family with  whom I was acquainted. Calling in to see them at the time she was there  I was introduced to her, and we immediately entered into conversation  on the subject of the gospel. I found her a very intelligent person,  and she seemed very desirous to hear the things I had to teach and  understand the doctrines of the gospel.    I informed her of an appointment I had made to preach that evening, and  invited her to attend. She did so, and likewise the evening following;  and after attending these two services she was fully convinced of the  truth, and the next morning sent for me, desiring to be baptized. I  cheerfully complied with her request, and confirmed her at the water  side. The following day, she started for home, requesting me to pray  for her, and gave us some encouragement to expect that her father would  open his chapel for me to preach in.    I hastened to my brethren, told them of the circumstance and the result  of my visit with the young lady, and then called upon them to unite  in prayer that the Lord would soften the heart of her father, that he  might be induced to open his chapel for us to preach in, and that our  way might be opened in that place.    The next week I received a letter from her, and one from her father,  in which he informed me that I was expected to be at his place the  following Saturday, as he had"]]]
