So this was what was going to happen.  Her heart almost stood still. Breathless and quivering, she watched  these two men, about whom now all was strangely magnified.    \"Reckon I'll go along with you, then,\" replied Roberts.    \"Your company's not wanted.\"    \"Wal, I'll go anyway.\"    This was only play at words, Joan thought. She divined in Roberts a  cold and grim acceptance of something he had expected. And the voice  of Kells--what did that convey? Still the man seemed slow, easy, kind,  amiable.    \"Haven't you got any sense, Roberts?\" he asked.    Roberts made no reply to that.    \"Go on home. Say nothing or anything--whatever you like,\" continued  Kells. \"You did me a favor once over in California. I like to remember  favors. Use your head now. Hit the trail.\"    \"Not without her. I'll fight first,\" declared Roberts, and his hands  began to twitch and jerk.    Joan did not miss the wonderful intentness of the pale-gray eyes that  watched Roberts--his face, his glance, his hands.    \"What good will it do to fight?\" asked Kells. He laughed coolly. \"That  won't help her... You ought to know what you'll get.\"    \"Kells--I'll die before I leave that girl in your clutches,\" flashed  Roberts. \"An' I ain't a-goin' to stand here an' argue with you. Let her  come--or--\"    \"You don't strike me as a fool,\" interrupted Kells. His voice was suave,  smooth, persuasive, cool. What strength--what certainty appeared behind  it! \"It's not my habit to argue with fools. Take the chance I offer  you. Hit the trail. Life is precious, man!... You've no chance here. And  what's one girl more or less to you?\"    \"Kells, I may be a fool, but I'm a man,\" passionately rejoined Roberts.  \"Why, you're somethin' inhuman! I knew that out in the gold-fields. But  to think you can stand there--an' talk sweet an' pleasant--with no idee  of manhood!... Let her come now--or--or I'm a-goin' for my gun!\"    \"Roberts, haven't you a wife--children?\"    \"Yes, I have,\" shouted Roberts, huskily. \"An' that wife would disown me  if I left Joan Randle to you. An' I've got a grown girl. Mebbe some day  she might need a man to stand between her an' such as you, Jack Kells!\"    All Roberts' pathos and passion had no effect, unless to bring out by  contrast the singular and ruthless nature of Jack Kells.    \"Will you hit the trail?\"    \"No!\" thundered Roberts.    Until then Joan Randle had been fascinated, held by the swift  interchange between her friend and enemy. But now she had a convulsion  of fear. She had seen men fight, but never to the death. Roberts  crouched like a wolf at bay. There was a madness upon him. He shook like  a rippling leaf. Suddenly his shoulder lurched--his arm swung.    Joan wheeled away in horror, shutting her eyes, covering her ears,  running blindly. Then upon her muffled hearing burst the boom of a gun.          3    Joan ran on, stumbling over rocks and brush, with a darkness before her  eyes, the terror in her soul. She was out in the cedars when someone  grasped her from behind. She felt the hands as the coils of a snake.  Then she was ready to faint, but she must not faint. She struggled away,  stood free. It was the man Bill who had caught her. He said something  that was unintelligible. She reached for the snag of a dead cedar and,  leaning there, fought her weakness, that cold black horror which seemed  a physical thing in her mind, her blood, her muscles.    When she recovered enough for the thickness to leave her sight she saw  Kells coming, leading her horse and his own. At sight of him a strange,  swift heat shot through her. Then she was confounded with the thought of  Roberts.    \"Ro--Roberts?\" she faltered.    Kells gave her a piercing glance. \"Miss Randle, I had to take the fight  out of your friend,\" he said.    \"You--you--Is he--dead?\"    \"I just crippled his gun arm. If I hadn't he would have hurt somebody.  He'll ride back to Hoadley and tell your folks about it. So they'll know  you're safe.\"    \"Safe!\" she whispered.    \"That's what I said, Miss Randle. If you're going to ride out into the  border--if it's possible to be safe out there you'll be so with me.\"    \"But I want to go home. Oh, please let me go!\"    \"I couldn't think of it.\"    \"Then--what will you--do with me?\"    Again that gray glance pierced her. His eyes were clear, flawless, like  crystal, without coldness, warmth, expression. \"I'll get a barrel of  gold out of you.\"    \"How?\" she asked, wonderingly.    \"I'll hold you for ransom. Sooner or later those prospectors over there  are going to strike gold. Strike it rich! I know that. I've got to make  a living some way.\"    Kells was tightening the cinch on her saddle while he spoke. His voice,  his manner, the amiable smile on his intelligent face, they all appeared  to come from sincerity. But for those strange eyes Joan would have  wholly believed him. As it was, a half doubt troubled her. She  remembered the character Roberts had given this man. Still, she was  recovering her nerve. It had been the certainty of disaster to Roberts  that had made her weaken. As he was only slightly wounded and free to  ride home safely, she had not the horror of his death upon her.  Indeed, she was now so immensely uplifted that she faced the situation  unflinchingly.    \"Bill,\" called Kells to the man standing there with a grin on his coarse  red face, \"you go back and help Halloway pack. Then take my trail.\"    Bill nodded, and was walking away when Kells called after him: \"And say,  Bill, don't say anything to Roberts. He's easily riled.\"    \"Haw! Haw! Haw!\" laughed Bill.    His harsh laughter somehow rang jarringly in Joan's ears. But she was  used to violent men who expressed mirth over mirthless jokes.    \"Get up, Miss Randle,\" said Kells as he mounted. \"We've a long ride.  You'll need all your strength. So I advise you to come quietly with me  and not try to get away. It won't be any use trying.\"    Joan climbed into her saddle and rode after him. Once she looked back  in hope of seeing Roberts, of waving a hand to him. She saw his horse  standing saddled, and she saw Bill struggling under a pack, but there  was no sign of Roberts. Then more cedars intervened and the camp site  was lost to view. When she glanced ahead her first thought was to take  in the points of Kells's horse. She had been used to horses all her  life. Kells rode a big rangy bay--a horse that appeared to snort speed  and endurance. Her pony could never run away from that big brute. Still  Joan had the temper to make an attempt to escape, if a favorable way  presented.    The morning was rosy, clear, cool; there was a sweet, dry tang in  the air; white-tailed deer bounded out of the open spaces; and the  gray-domed, glistening mountains, with their bold, black-fringed slopes,  overshadowed the close foot-hills.    Joan was a victim to swift vagaries of thought and conflicting emotions.  She was riding away with a freebooter, a road-agent, to be held for  ransom. The fact was scarcely credible. She could not shake the dread  of nameless peril. She tried not to recall Roberts's words, yet they  haunted her. If she had not been so handsome, he had said! Joan knew  she possessed good looks, but they had never caused her any particular  concern. That Kells had let that influence him--as Roberts had  imagined--was more than absurd. Kells had scarcely looked at her. It was  gold such men wanted. She wondered what her ransom would be, where her  uncle would get it, and if there really was a likelihood of that rich  strike. Then she remembered her mother, who had died when she was a  little girl, and a strange, sweet sadness abided with her. It passed.  She saw her uncle--that great, robust, hearty, splendid old man, with  his laugh and his kindness, and his love for her, and his everlasting  unquenchable belief that soon he would make a rich gold-strike. What a  roar and a stampede he would raise at her loss! The village camp might  be divided on that score, she thought, because the few young women in  that little settlement hated her, and the young men would have more  peace without her. Suddenly her thought shifted to Jim Cleve, the  cause of her present misfortune. She had forgotten Jim. In the interval  somehow he had grown. Sweet to remember how he had fought for her and  kept it secret! After all, she had misjudged him. She had hated him  because she liked him. Maybe she did more! That gave her a shock. She  recalled his kisses and then flamed all over. If she did not hate him  she ought to. He had been so useless; he ran after her so; he was the  laughing-stock of the village; his actions made her other admirers and  friends believe she cared for him, was playing fast-and-loose with him.  Still, there was a difference now. He had terribly transgressed. He had  frightened her with threats of dire ruin to himself. And because of that  she had trailed him, to fall herself upon a hazardous experience.  Where was Jim Cleve now? Like a flash then occurred to her the singular  possibility. Jim had ridden for the border with the avowed and desperate  intention of finding Kells and Gulden and the bad men of that trackless  region. He would do what he had sworn he would. And here she was, the  cause of it all, a captive of this notorious Kells! She was being led  into that wild border country. Somewhere out there Kells and Jim Cleve  would meet. Jim would find her in Kells's hands. Then there would be  hell, Joan thought. The possibility, the certainty, seemed to strike  deep into her, reviving that dread and terror. Yet she thrilled again; a  ripple that was not all cold coursed through her. Something had a birth  in her then, and the part of it she understood was that she welcomed  the adventure with a throbbing heart, yet looked with awe and shame and  distrust at this new, strange side of her nature.    And while her mind was thus thronged the morning"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45532"],[0,"History of Julius Cæsar, Vol. 2 of 2 (#4)"],[1,"of Paulus AEmilius, gained, at the confluence of the Isere and  the Rhone, a decisive victory over the Allobroges, and over Bituitus,  king of the Arverni. By this success Q. Fabius gained the surname of  _Allobrogicus_.[11] The Arverni pretended to be descendants of the  Trojans, and boasted a common origin with the Romans;[12] they remained  independent, but their dominion, which extended from the banks of the  Rhine to the neighbourhood of Narbonne and Marseilles, was limited to  their ancient territory. The Ruteni, who had been their allies against  Fabius, obtained similarly the condition of not being subjected to the  Roman power, and were exempted from all tribute.[13]    In 636, the Consul Q. Marcius Rex founded the colony of Narbo Marcius,  which gave its name to the Roman province called _Narbonensis_.[14]    The movement which had long thrust the peoples of the north towards the  south had slackened during several centuries, but in the seventh century  of the foundation of Rome it seems to have re-commenced with greater  intensity than ever. The Cimbri and the Teutones,[15] after ravaging  Noricum and Illyria, and defeating the army of Papirius Carbo sent to  protect Italy (641), had marched across Rhaetia, and penetrated by the  valley of the Rhine to the country of the Helvetii. They drew with them  a part of that people, spread into Gaul, and for several years carried  there terror and desolation. The Belgae alone offered a vigorous  resistance. Rome, to protect her province, sent against them, or against  the tribes of the Helvetii, their allies, five generals, who were  successively vanquished: the Consul M. Junius Silanus, in 645; M.  Aurelius Scaurus, in 646; L. Cassius Longinus, in 647;[16] lastly, in  the year 649, the proconsul Q. Servilius Caepio[17] and Cn. Manlius  Maximus. The two last each lost his army.[18] The very existence of Rome  was threatened.    Marius, by the victories gained at Aix over the Teutones (652), and at  the Campi Raudii, not far from the Adige, over the Cimbri (653),  destroyed the barbarians and saved Italy.    The ancients often confounded the Gauls with the Cimbri and Teutones;  sprung from a common origin, these peoples formed, as it were, the  rear-guard of the great army of invasion which, at an unknown epoch, had  brought the Celts into Gaul from the shores of the Black Sea.  Sallust[19] ascribes to the Gauls the defeats of Q. Caepio and Cn.  Manlius, and Cicero[20] designates under the same name the barbarians  who were destroyed by Marius. The fact is that all the peoples of the  north were always ready to unite in the same effort when it was proposed  to throw themselves upon the south of Europe.    From 653 to 684, the Romans, occupied with intestine wars, dreamt not of  increasing their power beyond the Alps; and, when internal peace was  restored, their generals, such as Sylla, Metellus Creticus, Lucullus,  and Pompey, preferred the easy and lucrative conquests of the East. The  vanquished peoples were abandoned by the Senate to the exactions of  governors, which explains the readiness with which the deputies of the  Allobroges entered, in 691, into Catiline's conspiracy; fear led them to  denounce the plot, but they experienced no gratitude for their  revelations.[21]    The Allobroges rose, seized the town of Vienne,[22] which was devoted to  the Romans, and surprised, in 693, Manlius Lentinus, lieutenant of C.  Pomptinus, governor of the Narbonnese. Nevertheless, some time after,  the latter finally defeated and subdued them. \"Until the time of Caesar,\"  says Cicero, \"our generals were satisfied with repelling the Gauls,  thinking more of putting a stop to their aggressions than of carrying  the war among them. Marius himself did not penetrate to their towns and  homes, but confined himself to opposing a barrier to these torrents of  peoples which were inundating Italy. C. Pomptinus, who suppressed the  war raised by the Allobroges, rested after his victory. Caesar alone  resolved to subject Gaul to our dominion.\"[23]      [Sidenote: Continual Pre-occupation of the Romans in regard to the  Gauls.]    III. It results from this summary of facts that the constant thought of  the Romans was, during several centuries, to resist the Celtic peoples  established on either side of the Alps. Ancient authors proclaim aloud  the fear which held Rome constantly on the watch. \"The Romans,\" says  Sallust, \"had then, as in our days, the opinion that all other peoples  must yield to their courage; but that with the Gauls it was no longer  for glory, but for safety, that they had to fight.\"[24] On his part,  Cicero expresses himself thus: \"From the beginning of our Republic, all  our wise men have looked upon Gaul as _the most redoubtable enemy of  Rome_. But the strength and multitude of those peoples had prevented us  until now from combating them all.\"[25]    In 694, it will be remembered, rumours of an invasion of the Helvetii  prevailed at Rome. All political pre-occupation ceased at once, and  resort was had to the exceptional measures adopted under such  circumstances.[26] In fact, as a principle, whenever a war against the  Gauls was imminent, a dictator was immediately nominated, and a levy _en  masse_ ordered. From that time no one was exempted from military  service; and, as a provision against an attack of those barbarians, a  special treasure had been deposited in the Capitol, which it was  forbidden to touch except in that eventuality.[27] Accordingly, when, in  705, Caesar seized upon it, he replied to the protests of the tribunes  that, since Gaul was subjugated, this treasure had become useless.[28]    War against the peoples beyond the Alps was thus, for Rome, the  consequence of a long antagonism, which must necessarily end in a  desperate struggle, and the ruin of one of the two adversaries. This  explains, at the same time, both Caesar's ardour and the enthusiasm  excited by his successes. Wars undertaken in accord with the traditional  sentiment of a country have alone the privilege of moving deeply the  fibre of the people, and the importance of a victory is measured by the  greatness of the disaster which would have followed a defeat. Since the  fall of Carthage, the conquests in Spain, in Africa, in Syria, in Asia,  and in Greece, enlarged the Republic, but did not consolidate it, and a  check in those different parts of the world would have diminished the  power of Rome without compromising it. With the peoples of the North, on  the contrary, her existence was at stake, and upon her reverses equally  as upon her successes depended the triumph of barbarism or civilisation.  If Caesar had been vanquished by the Helvetii or the Germans, who can say  what would have become of Rome, assailed by the numberless hordes of the  North rushing eagerly upon Italy?    And thus no war excited the public feeling so intensely as that of Gaul.  Though Pompey had carried the Roman eagles to the shores of the Caspian  Sea, and, by the tributes he had imposed on the vanquished, doubled the  revenues of the State, his triumphs had only obtained ten days of  thanksgivings. The Senate decreed fifteen,[29] and even twenty,[30] for  Caesar's victories, and, in honour of them, the people offered sacrifices  during sixty days.[31]    When, therefore, Suetonius ascribes the inspiration of the campaigns of  this great man to the mere desire of enriching himself with plunder, he  is false to history and to good sense, and assigns the most vulgar  motive to a noble design. When other historians ascribe to Caesar the  sole intention of seeking in Gaul a means of rising to the supreme power  by civil war, they show, as we have remarked elsewhere, a distorted  view; they judge events by their final result, instead of calmly  estimating the causes which have produced them.    The sequel of this history will prove that all the responsibility of the  civil war belongs not to Caesar, but to Pompey. And although the former  had his eyes incessantly fixed on his enemies at Rome, none the less for  that he pursued his conquests, without making them subordinate to his  personal interests. If he had sought only his own elevation in his  military successes, he would have followed an entirely opposite course.  We should not have seen him sustain during eight years a desperate  struggle, and incur the risks of enterprises such as those of Great  Britain and Germany. After his first campaigns, he need only have  returned to Rome to profit by the advantages he had acquired; for, as  Cicero says,[32] \"he had already done enough for his glory, if he had  not done enough for the Republic;\" and the same orator adds: \"Why would  Caesar himself remain in his province, if it were not to deliver to the  Roman people complete a work which was already nearly finished? Is he  retained by the agreeableness of the country, by the beauty of the  towns, by the politeness and amenity of the individuals and peoples, by  the lust of victory, by the desire of extending the limits of our  empire? Is there anything more uncultivated than those countries, ruder  than those towns, more ferocious than those peoples, and more admirable  than the multiplicity of Caesar's victories? Can he find limits farther  off than the ocean? Would his return to his country offend either the  people who sent him or the Senate which has loaded him with honours?  Would his absence increase the desire we have to see him? Would it not  rather contribute, through lapse of time, to make people forget him, and  to cause the laurels to fade which he had gathered in the midst of the  greatest perils? If, then, there any who love not Caesar, it is not their  policy to obtain his recall from his province, because that would be to  recall him to glory, to triumph, to the congratulations and supreme  honours of the Senate, to the favour of the equestrian order, to the  affection of the people.\"[33]    Thus, after the end of 698, he "]]]
