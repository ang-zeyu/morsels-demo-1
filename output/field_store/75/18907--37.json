The lid is drawn back to show the  face and bosom, and on the coffin top are heather, precious flowers, and  sprigs of green. This catafalque, or in plain words, this coffin set  upon a platform and canopied, has around it a sufficient space of  Brussels carpet, and on three sides of this there are raised steps  covered with black, on which the honored visitors are to stand.    The fourth side is bare, save of a single row of chairs some twenty in  number, on which the reporters are to sit. The odor of the room is fresh  and healthy; the shade is solemn, without being oppressive. All is rich,  simple, and spacious, and in such sort as any king might wish to lie.  Approach and look at the dead man.    Death has fastened into his frozen face all the character and  idiosyncrasy of life. He has not changed one line of his grave,  grotesque countenance, nor smoothed out a single feature. The hue is  rather bloodless and leaden; but he was alway sallow. The dark eyebrows  seem abruptly arched; the beard, which will grow no more, is shaved  close, save the tuft at the short small chin. The mouth is shut, like  that of one who had put the foot down firm, and so are the eyes, which  look as calm as slumber. The collar is short and awkward, turned over  the stiff elastic cravat, and whatever energy or humor or tender gravity  marked the living face is hardened into its pulseless outline. No corpse  in the world is better prepared according to appearances. The white  satin around it reflects sufficient light upon the face to show us that  death is really there; but there are sweet roses and early magnolias,  and the balmiest of lilies strewn around, as if the flowers had begun to  bloom even upon his coffin. Looking on uninterruptedly! for there is no  pressure, and henceforward the place will be thronged with gazers who  will take from the sight its suggestiveness and respect. Three years  ago, when little Willie Lincoln died, Doctors Brown and Alexander, the  embalmers or injectors, prepared his body so handsomely that the  President had it twice disinterred to look upon it. The same men, in the  same way, have made perpetual these beloved lineaments. There is now no  blood in the body; it was drained by the jugular vein and sacredly  preserved, and through a cutting on the inside of the thigh the empty  blood vessels were charged with a chemical preparation which soon  hardened to the consistence of stone. The long and bony body is now hard  and stiff, so that beyond its present position it cannot be moved any  more than the arms or legs of a statue. It has undergone many changes.  The scalp has been removed, the brain taken out, the chest opened and  the blood emptied. All that we see of Abraham Lincoln, so cunningly  contemplated in this splendid coffin, is a mere shell, an effigy, a  sculpture. He lies in sleep, but it is the sleep of marble. All that  made this flesh vital, sentient, and affectionate is gone forever.    The officers present are Generals Hunter and Dyer and two staff  captains. Hunter, compact and dark and reticent, walks about the empty  chamber in full uniform, his bright buttons and sash and sword  contrasting with his dark blue uniform, gauntlets upon his hands, crape  on his arm and blade, his corded hat in his hands, a paper collar just  apparent above his velvet tips, and now and then he speaks to Captain  Nesmith or Captain Dewes, of General Harding's staff, rather as one who  wishes company than one who has anything to say. His two silver stars  upon his shoulder shine dimly in the draped apartment. He was one of the  first in the war to urge the measures which Mr. Lincoln afterward  adopted. The aids walk to and fro, selected without reference to any  association with the late President. Their clothes are rich, their  swords wear mourning, they go in silence, everything is funereal. In the  deeply-draped mirrors strange mirages are seen, as in the coffin scene  of \"Lucretia Borgia,\" where all the dusky perspectives bear vistas of  gloomy palls. The upholsterers make timid noises of driving nails and  spreading tapestry; but save ourselves and these few watchers and  workers, only the dead is here. The White House, so ill-appreciated in  common times, is seen to be capacious and elegant--no disgrace to the  nation even in the eyes of those foreign folk of rank who shall gather  here directly.    As we sit brooding, with the pall straight before us, the funeral guns  are heard indistinctly booming from the far forts, with the tap of drums  in the serried street without, where troops and citizens are forming for  the grand procession. We see through the window in the beautiful spring  day that the grass is brightly green; and all the trees in blossom, show  us through their archways the bronze and marble statues breaking the  horizon. But there is one at an upper window, seeing all this through  her tears, to whom the beautiful noon, with its wealth of zephyrs and  sweets, can waft no gratulation. The father of her children, the  confidant of her affection and ambition, has passed from life into  immortality, and lies below, dumb, cold murdered. The feeling of  sympathy for Mrs. Lincoln is as wide-spread as the regret for the chief  magistrate. Whatever indiscretions she may have committed in the abrupt  transition from plainness to power are now forgiven and forgotten. She  and her sons are the property of the nation associated with its truest  glories and its worst bereavement. By and by the guests drop in, hat in  hand, wearing upon their sleeves waving crape; and some of them slip up  to the coffin to carry away a last impression of the fading face.    But the first accession of force is that of the clergy, sixty in number.  They are devout looking men, darkly attired, and have come from all the  neighboring cities to represent every denomination. Five years ago these  were wrangling over slavery as a theological question, and at the  beginning of the war it was hard, in many of their bodies, to carry  loyal resolutions, To-day there are here such sincere mourners as Robert  Pattison, of the Methodist church, who passed much of his life among  slaves and masters. He and the rest have come to believe that the  President was wise and right, and follow him to his grave, as the  apostles the interred on calvary. All these retire to the south end of  the room, facing the feet of the corpse, and stand there silently to  wait for the coming of others. Very soon this East room is filled with  the representative intelligence of the entire nation. The governors of  states stand on the dais next to the head of the coffin, with the varied  features of Curtin, Brough, Fenton, Stone, Oglesby and Ingraham. Behind  them are the mayors and councilmen of many towns paying their last  respects to the representative of the source of all municipal freedom.  To their left are the corporate officers of Washington, zealous to make  this day's funeral honors atone for the shame of the assassination. With  these are sprinkled many scarred and worthy soldiers who have borne the  burden of the grand war, and stand before this shape they loved in quiet  civil reverence.    Still further down the steps and closer to the catafalque rest the  familiar faces of many of our greatest generals--the manly features of  Augur, whose blood I have seen trickling forth upon the field of battle;  the open almost, beardless contour of Halleck, who has often talked of  sieges and campaigns with this homely gentleman who is going to the  grave. There are many more bright stars twinkling in contiguous shoulder  bars, but sitting in a chair upon the beflowered carpet is Ulysses  Grant, who has lived a century in the last three weeks and comes to-day  to add the luster of his iron face to this thrilling and saddened  picture. He wears white gloves and sash, and is swarthy, nervous, and  almost tearful, his feet crossed, his square receding head turning now  here now there, his treble constellation blazing upon the left shoulder  only, but hidden on the right, and I seem to read upon his compact  features the indurate and obstinate will to fight, on the line he has  selected, the honor of the country through any peril, as if he had sworn  it by the slain man's bier--his state-fellow, patron, and friend. Here  also is General McCallum, who has seamed the rebellious South with  military roads to send victory along them, and bring back the groaning  and the scarred. These and the rest are grand historic figures, worthy  of all artistic depiction. They have looked so often into the mortar's  mouth, that no bravo's blade can make them wince. Do you see the  thin-haired, conical head of the viking Farragut, close by General  Grant, with many naval heroes close behind, storm-beaten, and every inch  Americans in thought and physiognomy?    What think the foreign ambassadors of such men, in the light of their  own overloaded bodies, where meaningless orders, crosses, and ribbons  shine dimly in the funeral light? These legations number, perhaps, a  hundred men, of all civilized races,--the Sardinian envoy, jetty-eyed,  towering above the rest. But they are still and respectful, gathered  thus by a slain ruler, to see how worthy is the republic he has  preserved. Whatever sympathy these have for our institutions, I think  that in such audience they must have been impressed with the futility of  any thought that either one citizen right or one territorial inch can  ever be torn from the United States. Not to speak disparagingly of these  noble guests, I was struck with the superior facial energy of our own  public servants, who were generally larger, and brighter-faced, born of  that aristocracy which took its patent from Tubal Cain, and Abel the  goatherd, and graduated in Abraham Lincoln. The Haytien minister,  swarthy and fiery-faced, is conspicuous among these.

And then we have to remember that  this form furnishes the ground-plan of the universe.    As an indication of the extraordinary speculations to which the  mystery of the Milky Way has given rise, a theory recently (1909)  proposed by Prof. George C. Comstock may be mentioned. Starting with  the data (first) that the number of stars increases as the Milky Way  is approached, and reaches a maximum in its plane, while on the other  hand the number of nebulae is greatest outside the Milky Way and  increases with distance from it, and (second) that the Milky Way,  although a complete ring, is broad and diffuse on one side through  one-half its course -- that half alone containing nebulae -- and  relatively narrow and well defined on the opposite side, the author of  this singular speculation avers that these facts can best be explained  by supposing that the invisible universe consists of two  interpenetrating parts, one of which is a chaos of indefinite extent,  strewn with stars and nebulous dust, and the other a long, broad but  comparatively thin cluster of stars, including the sun as one of its  central members. This flat star-cluster is conceived to be moving  edgewise through the chaos, and, according to Professor Comstock, it  acts after the manner of a snow-plough sweeping away the cosmic dust  and piling it on either hand above and below the plane of the moving  cluster. It thus forms a transparent rift, through which we see  farther and command a view of more stars than through the intensified  dust-clouds on either hand. This rift is the Milky Way. The dust  thrown aside toward the poles of the Milky Way is the substance of the  nebulae which abound there. Ahead, where the front of the star-plough  is clearing the way, the chaos is nearer at hand, and consequently  there the rift subtends a broader angle, and is filled with primordial  dust, which, having been annexed by the vanguard of the star-swarm,  forms the nebulae seen only in that part of the Milky Way. But behind,  the rift appears narrow because there we look farther away between  dust-clouds produced ages ago by the front of the plough, and no  scattered dust remains in that part of the rift.    In quoting an outline of this strikingly original theory the present  writer should not be understood as assenting to it. That it appears  bizarre is not, in itself, a reason for rejecting it, when we are  dealing with so problematical and enigmatical a subject as the Milky  Way; but the serious objection is that the theory does not  sufficiently accord with the observed phenomena. There is too much  evidence that the Milky Way is an organic system, however fantastic  its form, to permit the belief that it can only be a rift in chaotic  clouds. As with every organism, we find that its parts are more or  less clearly repeated in its ensemble. Among all the strange things  that the Milky Way contains there is nothing so extraordinary as  itself. Every astronomer must many times have found himself marveling  at it in those comparatively rare nights when it shows all its beauty  and all its strangeness. In its great broken rifts, divisions, and  spirals are found the gigantic prototypes of similar forms in its  star-clouds and clusters. As we have said, it determines the general  shape of the whole sidereal system. Some of the brightest stars in the  sky appear to hang like jewels suspended at the ends of tassels  dropped from the Galaxy. Among these pendants are the Pleiades and the  Hyades. Orion, too, the ``Mighty Hunter,'' is caught in ``a loop of  light'' thrown out from it. The majority of the great first-magnitude  stars seem related to it, as if they formed an inner ring inclined at  an angle of some twenty degrees to its plane. Many of the long curves  that set off from it on both sides are accompanied by corresponding  curves of lucid stars. In a word, it offers every appearance of  structural connection with the entire starry system. That the universe  should have assumed the form of a wreath is certainly a matter for  astonishment; but it would have been still more astonishing if it had  been a cube, a rhomboid, or a dodecahedron, for then we should have  had to suppose that something resembling the forces that shape  crystals had acted upon the stars, and the difficulty of explaining  the universe by the laws of gravitation would have been increased.    From the Milky Way as a whole we pass to the vast clouds, swarms, and  clusters of stars of which it is made up. It may be, as some  astronomers hold, that most of the galactic stars are much smaller  than the sun, so that their faintness is not due entirely to the  effect of distance. Still, their intrinsic brilliance attests their  solar character, and considering their remoteness, which has been  estimated at not less than ten thousand to twenty thousand light-years  (a light-year is equal to nearly six thousand thousand million miles)  their actual masses cannot be extremely small. The minutest of them  are entitled to be regarded as real suns, and they vary enormously in  magnitude. The effects of their attractions upon one another can only  be inferred from their clustering, because their relative movements  are not apparent on account of the brevity of the observations that we  can make. But imagine a being for whom a million years would be but as  a flitting moment; to him the Milky Way would appear in a state of  ceaseless agitation -- swirling with ``a fury of whirlpool motion.''    The cloud-like aspect of large parts of the Galaxy must always have  attracted attention, even from naked-eye observers, but the true  star-clouds were first satisfactorily represented in Barnard's  photographs. The resemblance to actual clouds is often startling. Some  are close-packed and dense, like cumuli; some are wispy or mottled,  like cirri. The rifts and modulations, as well as the general  outlines, are the same as those of clouds of vapor or dust, and one  notices also the characteristic thinning out at the edges. But we must  beware of supposing that the component suns are thickly crowded as the  particles forming an ordinary cloud. They look, indeed, as if they  were matted together, because of the irradiation of light, but in  reality millions and billions of miles separate each star from its  neighbors. Nevertheless they form real assemblages, whose members are  far more closely related to one another than is our sun to the stars  around him, and if we were in the Milky Way the aspect of the  nocturnal sky would be marvelously different from its present  appearance.    Stellar clouds are characteristic of the Galaxy and are not found  beyond its borders, except in the ``Magellanic Clouds'' of the  southern hemisphere, which resemble detached portions of the Milky  Way. These singular objects form as striking a peculiarity of the  austral heavens as does the great ``Coal-sack'' described in Chapter  1. But it is their isolation that makes them so remarkable, for their  composition is essentially galactic, and if they were included within  its boundaries they would not appear more wonderful than many other  parts of the Milky Way. Placed where they are, they look like masses  fallen from the great stellar arch. They are full of nebulae and  star-clusters, and show striking evidences of spiral movement.    Star-swarms, which are also characteristic features of the Galaxy,  differ from star-clouds very much in the way that their name would  imply -- i.e., their component stars are so arranged, even when they  are countless in number, that the idea of an exceedingly numerous  assemblage rather than that of a cloud is impressed on the observer's  mind. In a star-swarm the separate members are distinguishable because  they are either larger or nearer than the stars composing a ``cloud.''  A splendid example of a true star-swarm is furnished by Chi Persei, in  that part of the Milky Way which runs between the constellations  Perseus and Cassiopeia. This swarm is much coarser than many others,  and can be seen by the naked eye. In a small telescope it appears  double, as if the suns composing it had divided into two parties which  keep on their way side by side, with some commingling of their members  where the skirts of the two companies come in contact.    Smaller than either star-clouds or star-swarms, and differing from  both in their organization, are star-clusters. These, unlike the  others, are found outside as well as inside the Milky Way, although  they are more numerous inside its boundaries than elsewhere. The term  star-cluster is sometimes applied, though improperly, to assemblages  which are rather groups, such, for instance, as the Pleiades. In their  most characteristic aspect star-clusters are of a globular shape --  globes of suns! A famous example of a globular star-cluster, but one  not included in the Milky Way, is the ``Great Cluster in Hercules.''  This is barely visible to the naked eye, but a small telescope shows  its character, and in a large one it presents a marvelous spectacle.  Photographs of such clusters are, perhaps, less effective than those  of star-clouds, because the central condensation of stars in them is  so great that their light becomes blended in an indistinguishable  blur. The beautiful effect of the incessant play of infinitesimal rays  over the apparently compact surface of the cluster, as if it were a  globe of the finest frosted silver shining in an electric beam, is  also lost in a photograph. Still, even to the eye looking directly at  the cluster through a powerful telescope, the central part of the  wonderful congregation seems almost a solid mass in which the stars  are packed like the ice crystals in a snowball.    The same question rises to the lips of every observer: How can they  possibly have been brought into such a situation? The marvel does not  grow less when we know that, instead of being closely "]]]
