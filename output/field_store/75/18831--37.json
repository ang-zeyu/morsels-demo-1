You will be called on to go, also to receive      your endowment. Keep always meek and a teachable spirit. The willow      always bends in the breeze and is also firm in the root. Though      many have gone out from the Church.\"--now remember this--\"YET      it increases as fast as ever and evinces to the world as great      affinity and identity to the eternal plan of Jehovah as ever it      did.\"    This does not sound much like a falling away or a dissolution of the  Church, does it? And this is the testimony of Zenas H. Gurley given  before he left the Church. Again, on the 3rd of January, 1846, the  minutes say:        \"Zenas H. Gurley enlarged on the subject of liberally donating      to the Church necessities. God said He has so shaped the scheme      of salvation as that to be saved and appear approved of God, we      must sacrifice of all that we possess. * * He felt filled with the      Spirit. The course the Church is pursuing has been spoken of by      Jesus Christ and the holy prophets of olden time.\"    There is his endorsement of the course of the Church. And on January  10, 1846:        \"Zenas H. Gurley arose and said that the presidents of the quorum      had received their endowment.\"    Continuing he said--mark you, he was one of those presidents:        \"He observed that it was remarkable for an unusual outpouring of      the Holy Spirit. He felt for the quorum that they should receive      their endowment. The Church authorities, the quorum of Seventy in      succession, to furnish the people engaged in the endowment, one day      each, and he wanted the quorum (Twenty-first) to acquit themselves      from every obligation.\"    It may be interesting to know that this man and his wife were endowed  in the Temple January 6, 1846. Here is the testimony of Zenas H. Gurley  in relation to the Temple ceremonies when he was in full fellowship in  the Church and was in possession of the spirit of his calling. At that  time he declared most emphatically that on that occasion the Spirit of  the Lord was unusual in its outpouring. If that is true and he could  testify to it then, there cannot be anything so very bad in these  glorious privileges of which he testified. In later years when he had  lost the spirit of the Gospel and was fighting the work he had formerly  upheld, he denounced in bitterness these sacred ordinances that he  on this occasion sanctioned. His former testimony is the one that is  consistent.    On the 17th of January, 1846, the minutes say:        \"President Zenas H. Gurley arose and said * * The business before      the meeting was the arranging for a donation for the benefit of      those of the Priesthood engaged in the Temple. (Not on the Temple      but in it). He beautifully observed that it was his design, and      also his council's to exalt the Twenty-first quorum, and the quorum      should reciprocally return the favor; give support and influence      towards its welfare.\"    Then on the 25th of the same month:        \"President Zenas H. Gurley arose and said that the business before      the meeting was to select persons to receive their endowment. He      had received direction to select 10 or 12 to go in the Temple. He      desired the brethren not to think it was partiality to make this      selection. The most important point to be considered was to learn      obedience. This was the principle taught by Jesus Christ.\"    He then proceeded to name the brethren for this purpose, and continuing  his remarks he said:        \"The Saints who have passed through the trials of the Church were      generally rooted and grounded in love and have a witness in their      hearts or they would not have remained.\"    And I say amen to that. I wish with all my soul that Zenas H. Gurley  had been one of them for his own sake, for it was but 10 days after he  made this utterance, that the exodus from Nauvoo began, and this is  the last reference we have of Zenas H. Gurley while connected with the  Church! What became of him? \"Because he had no root he withered away.\"  The terrible trials the Saints were forced to undergo in the wilderness  were too great for him; he could not stand the test. And while he had  declared that he would go with the Saints even if it required that he  should sacrifice the wealth of the whole nation, when put to the actual  test, his heart failed him and he sought safety in flight, he sought  his life, but lost the life eternal!    The next reference we have of him in the minutes of the Twenty-first  quorum is in 1855, where the statement is made that he had fled from  the Church and was associated with James J. Strang. Of his connection  with Mr. Strang, I prefer to read to you the account from the history  of the \"Reorganized\" Church, for you know then we will have it correct.  On page 744 of volume three we have the following:        \"After the death of Joseph Smith, Elder Gurley investigated the      claims of the various leaders, and finally accepted those of James      J. Strang as being the most reasonable. A letter written by him      from Gananoque, Canada West, November 6, 1849, and published in      Gospel Herald, volume 4, page 187, indicates that he was then on a      mission to Canada in the interest of the organization under Strang.      On January 1, 1850, he again wrote from Landsdown, Upper Canada,      still engaged in the same work.        \"A letter written January 10, 1850, from Pittsburg, Canada West,      manifested zeal in his work.\"    We have already shown how he manifested great zeal in his work in the  Twenty-first quorum before he left the Church. But to continue:        \"March 15, 1850 he wrote from St. Lawrence, New York, that he was      assisting Brother Silsby in organizing the brethren and helping      them in getting ready for Beaver. He was present at a conference      held at Voree, Wisconsin, June 1 and 2, 1850, and in these minutes      we find this entry: 'Brother Z. H. Gurley was'--    Then there is an ellipsis, no doubt it would be interesting to know what  follows, and the account continues--        'sent to the northeastern parts of Wisconsin, on the presentation      of President Strang.'\"    Now, please note carefully what follows:        \"It was probably while on the mission thus appointed that Elder      Gurley raised up the Yellowstone branch, the members of which      helped to form the nucleus of the Reorganization.\"--Page 744-5.    We have already seen that Jason W. Briggs raised up the Waukesha branch  of the Strangite church in 1849, also that he raised up the Beloit  branch for the same organization, and now we have the admission fatal  to their organization, that the Yellowstone branch was also raised  up to Mr. James J. Strang. These branches you see became the nucleus  of the \"Reorganization.\" They were not connected with the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, according to their own admission,  but were organized for the Church of James J. Strang. Yet, mark you,  these Strangite branches were admitted into what was called the \"New  organization,\" or the \"Reorganization,\" on their original baptisms.[6]  It is quite evident that the \"Reorganization\" is the offspring of the  church of this man James J. Strang.    Now let us return to Jason W. Briggs. In Mr. Heman C. Smith's \"True  Succession,\" pages 134-135, we have an alleged revelation that  this man received that was the cause of the coming together of the  so-called \"Reorganized\" Church. I have already told you that he was  the most important man in this movement, if not the father of it. The  \"revelation\" is as follows:        \"Therefore, let the elders whom I have ordained by the hand of my      servant Joseph, or by the hand of those ordained by him, resist not      this authority, nor faint in the discharge of duty, which is to      preach my gospel as revealed in the records of the Jews, and the      Book of Mormon, and the Book of Doctrine and Covenants; and cry      repentance and remission of sins through obedience to the gospel,      and I will sustain them, and give them my Spirit; and in mine own      due time will I call upon the seed of Joseph Smith, and will bring      one forth, and he shall be mighty and strong, and he shall preside      over the High Priesthood of my Church; and then shall the quorums      assemble, and the pure in heart shall gather, and Zion shall be      reinhabited, as I said unto my servant Joseph Smith.\"      WHY BRIGGS SECEDED.    In this alleged revelation we have this man teaching lineal Priesthood  or the right of succession from father to son. We also have him  teaching the literal gathering to Zion of the honest in heart. We will  now see what his reasons were for withdrawing from the \"Reorganized\"  Church. We find on pages 248-249 of volume 33 of the Saints' Herald  that the reasons why this man withdrew from the \"Reorganization\" with  the family of Zenas H. Gurley, were as follows:    That he could not believe in:    (1) \"The literal gathering of the Church into Jackson and the adjoining  counties in the state of Missouri (or any one or more places) known as  a local Zion.\"    (2) \"Temple building and ceremonial endowments therein.\"    (3) \"Baptism for the dead.\"    (4) \"Tithing as a law applicable to the Church.\"    (5) \"The law of consecration by which individuals are made legal heirs  to the Kingdom of Zion.\"    (6) \"A sole mouthpiece of God to the Church.\"    (7) \"The plenary inspiration of and consequent absolute authority of  what are called the sacred books.\"    (8) \"The doctrine of 'cursing our enemies,' and of 'avenging God upon  them to the third and fourth generations.'\"    (9) \"To the foregoing may be added the revelation of January 19, 1841,  section 107 D. & C., (124 our edition), which enjoins upon the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5039"],[0,"State of the Union Addresses (#4)"],[1,"it with additional capital. The Congress  has renewed the Trade Agreements Act which provides the necessary framework  within which to negotiate a reduction of trade barriers on a reciprocal  basis. It has given our support to the United Nations Relief and  Rehabilitation Administration.    In accordance with the intentions of the Congress, lend-lease, except as to  continuing military lend-lease in China, was terminated upon the surrender  of Japan. The first of the lend-lease settlement agreements has been  completed with the United Kingdom. Negotiations with other lend-lease  countries are in progress. In negotiating these agreements, we intend to  seek settlements which will not encumber world trade through war debts of a  character that proved to be so detrimental to the stability of the world  economy after the last war.    We have taken steps to dispose of the goods which on VJ-day were in the  lend-lease pipe line to the various lend-lease countries and to allow them  long-term credit for the purpose where necessary. We are also making  arrangements under which those countries may use the lend-lease inventories  in their possession and acquire surplus property abroad to assist in their  economic rehabilitation and reconstruction. These goods will be accounted  for at fair values.    The proposed loan to the United Kingdom, which I shall recommend to the  Congress in a separate message, will contribute to easing the transition  problem of one of our major partners in the war. It will enable the whole  sterling area and other countries affiliated with it to resume trade on a  multilateral basis. Extension of this credit will enable the United Kingdom  to avoid discriminatory trade arrangements of the type which destroyed  freedom of trade during the 1930's. I consider the progress toward  multilateral trade which will be achieved by this agreement to be in itself  sufficient warrant for the credit.    The view of this Government is that, in the longer run, our economic  prosperity and the prosperity of the whole world are best served by the  elimination of artificial barriers to international trade, whether in the  form of unreasonable tariffs or tariff preferences or commercial quotas or  embargoes or the restrictive practices of cartels.    The United States Government has issued proposals for the expansion of  world trade and employment to which the Government of the United Kingdom  has given its support on every important issue. These proposals are  intended to form the basis for a trade and employment conference to be held  in the middle of this year. If that conference is a success, I feel  confident that the way will have been adequately prepared for an expanded  and prosperous world trade.    We shall also continue negotiations looking to the full and equitable  development of facilities for transportation and communications among  nations.    The vast majority of the nations of the world have chosen to work together  to achieve, on a cooperative basis, world security and world prosperity.  The effort cannot succeed without full cooperation of the United States. To  play our part, we must not only resolutely carry out the foreign policies  we have adopted but also follow a domestic policy which will maintain full  production and employment in the United States. A serious depression here  can disrupt the whole fabric of the world economy.    3. OCCUPIED COUNTRIES    The major tasks of our Military Establishment in Europe following VE-day,  and in the Pacific since the surrender of Japan, have been those of  occupation and military government. In addition we have given much needed  aid to the peoples of the liberated countries.    The end of the war in Europe found Germany in a chaotic condition.  Organized government had ceased to exist, transportation systems had been  wrecked, cities and industrial facilities had been bombed into ruins. In  addition to the tasks of occupation we had to assume all of the functions  of government. Great progress has been made in the repatriation of  displaced persons and of prisoners of war. Of the total of 3,500,000  displaced persons found in the United States zone only 460,000 now remain.    The extensive complications involved by the requirement of dealing with  three other governments engaged in occupation and with the governments of  liberated countries require intensive work and energetic cooperation. The  influx of some 2 million German refugees into our zone of occupation is a  pressing problem, making exacting demands upon an already overstrained  internal economy.    Improvements in the European economy during 1945 have made it possible for  our military authorities to relinquish to the governments of all liberated  areas, or to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration,  the responsibility for the provision of food and other civilian relief  supplies. The Army's responsibilities in Europe extend now only to our  zones of occupation in Germany and Austria and to two small areas in  northern Italy.    By contrast with Germany, in Japan we have occupied a country still  possessing an organized and operating governmental system. Although  severely damaged, the Japanese industrial and transportation systems have  been able to insure at least a survival existence for the population. The  repatriation of Japanese military and civilian personnel from overseas is  proceeding as rapidly as shipping and other means permit.    In order to insure that neither Germany nor Japan will again be in a  position to wage aggressive warfare, the armament making potential of these  countries is being dismantled and fundamental changes in their social and  political structures are being effected. Democratic systems are being  fostered to the end that the voice of the common man may be heard in the  councils of his government.    For the first time in history the legal culpability of war makers is being  determined. The trials now in progress in Nurnberg-and those soon to begin  in Tokyo--bring before the bar of international justice those individuals  who are charged with the responsibility for the sufferings of the past six  years. We have high hope that this public portrayal of the guilt of these  evildoers will bring wholesale and permanent revulsion on the part of the  masses of our former enemies against war, militarism, aggression, and  notions of race superiority.    4. DEMOBILIZATION OF OUR ARMED FORCES    The cessation of active campaigning does not mean that we can completely  disband our fighting forces. For their sake and for the sake of their loved  ones at home, I wish that we could. But we still have the task of clinching  the victories we have won--of making certain that Germany and Japan can  never again wage aggressive warfare, that they will not again have the  means to bring on another world war. The performance of that task requires  that, together with our allies, we occupy the hostile areas, complete the  disarmament of our enemies, and take the necessary measures to see to it  that they do not rearm.    As quickly as possible, we are bringing about the reduction of our armed  services to the size required for these tasks of occupation and  disarmament. The Army and the Navy are following both length-of-service and  point systems as far as possible in releasing men and women from the  service. The points are based chiefly on length and character of service,  and on the existence of dependents.    Over 5 million from the Army have already passed through the separation  centers.    The Navy, including the Marine Corps and the Coast Guard, has discharged  over one and a half million.    Of the 12 million men and women serving in the Army and Navy at the time of  the surrender of Germany, one-half have already been released. The greater  part of these had to be brought back to this country from distant parts of  the world.    Of course there are cases of individual hardship in retention of personnel  in the service. There will be in the future. No system of such size can  operate to perfection. But the systems are rounded on fairness and justice,  and they are working at full speed. We shall try to avoid mistakes,  injustices, and hardship--as far as humanly possible.    We have already reached the point where shipping is no longer the  bottleneck in the return of troops from the European theater. The governing  factor now has become the requirement for troops in sufficient strength to  carry out their missions.    In a few months the same situation will exist in the Pacific. By the end of  June, 9 out of 10 who were serving in the armed forces on VE-day will have  been released. Demobilization will continue thereafter, but at a slower  rate, determined by our military responsibilities.    Our national safety and the security of the world will require substantial  armed forces, particularly in overseas service. At the same time it is  imperative that we relieve those who have already done their duty, and that  we relieve them as fast as we can. To do that, the Army and the Navy are  conducting recruiting drives with considerable success.    The Army has obtained nearly 400,000 volunteers in the past four months,  and the Navy has obtained 80,000. Eighty percent of these volunteers for  the regular service have come from those already with the colors. The  Congress has made it possible to offer valuable inducements to those who  are eligible for enlistment. Every effort will be made to enlist the  required number of young men.    The War and Navy Departments now estimate that by a year from now we still  will need a strength of about 2 million including officers, for the armed  forces--Army, Navy, and Air. I have reviewed their estimates and believe  that the safety of the Nation will require the maintenance of an armed  strength of this size for the calendar year that is before us.    In case the campaign for volunteers does not "]]]
