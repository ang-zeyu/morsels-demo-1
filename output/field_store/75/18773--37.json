His  great-grandfather had gone to Norway to work as a farm laborer and had  married a Norwegian girl. This strain of Norwegian blood came out  somewhere in each generation of the Kronborgs. The intemperance of one  of Peter Kronborg's uncles, and the religious mania of another, had been  alike charged to the Norwegian grandmother. Both Peter Kronborg and his  sister Tillie were more like the Norwegian root of the family than like  the Swedish, and this same Norwegian strain was strong in Thea, though  in her it took a very different character.    Tillie was a queer, addle-pated thing, as flighty as a girl at  thirty-five, and overweeningly fond of gay clothes--which taste, as Mrs.  Kronborg philosophically said, did nobody any harm. Tillie was always  cheerful, and her tongue was still for scarcely a minute during the day.  She had been cruelly overworked on her father's Minnesota farm when she  was a young girl, and she had never been so happy as she was now; had  never before, as she said, had such social advantages. She thought her  brother the most important man in Moonstone. She never missed a church  service, and, much to the embarrassment of the children, she always  \"spoke a piece\" at the Sunday-School concerts. She had a complete set of  \"Standard Recitations,\" which she conned on Sundays. This morning, when  Thea and her two younger brothers sat down to breakfast, Tillie was  remonstrating with Gunner because he had not learned a recitation  assigned to him for George Washington Day at school. The unmemorized  text lay heavily on Gunner's conscience as he attacked his buckwheat  cakes and sausage. He knew that Tillie was in the right, and that \"when  the day came he would be ashamed of himself.\"    \"I don't care,\" he muttered, stirring his coffee; \"they oughtn't to make  boys speak. It's all right for girls. They like to show off.\"    \"No showing off about it. Boys ought to like to speak up for their  country. And what was the use of your father buying you a new suit, if  you're not going to take part in anything?\"    \"That was for Sunday-School. I'd rather wear my old one, anyhow. Why  didn't they give the piece to Thea?\" Gunner grumbled.    Tillie was turning buckwheat cakes at the griddle. \"Thea can play and  sing, she don't need to speak. But you've got to know how to do  something, Gunner, that you have. What are you going to do when you git  big and want to git into society, if you can't do nothing? Everybody'll  say, 'Can you sing? Can you play? Can you speak? Then git right out of  society.' An' that's what they'll say to you, Mr. Gunner.\"    Gunner and Alex grinned at Anna, who was preparing her mother's  breakfast. They never made fun of Tillie, but they understood well  enough that there were subjects upon which her ideas were rather  foolish. When Tillie struck the shallows, Thea was usually prompt in  turning the conversation.    \"Will you and Axel let me have your sled at recess?\" she asked.    \"All the time?\" asked Gunner dubiously.    \"I'll work your examples for you to-night, if you do.\"    \"Oh, all right. There'll be a lot of 'em.\"    \"I don't mind, I can work 'em fast. How about yours, Axel?\"    Axel was a fat little boy of seven, with pretty, lazy blue eyes. \"I  don't care,\" he murmured, buttering his last buckwheat cake without  ambition; \"too much trouble to copy 'em down. Jenny Smiley'll let me  have hers.\"    The boys were to pull Thea to school on their sled, as the snow was  deep. The three set off together. Anna was now in the high school, and  she no longer went with the family party, but walked to school with some  of the older girls who were her friends, and wore a hat, not a hood like  Thea.          IV    \"And it was Summer, beautiful Summer!\" Those were the closing words of  Thea's favorite fairy tale, and she thought of them as she ran out into  the world one Saturday morning in May, her music book under her arm. She  was going to the Kohlers' to take her lesson, but she was in no hurry.    It was in the summer that one really lived. Then all the little  overcrowded houses were opened wide, and the wind blew through them with  sweet, earthy smells of garden-planting. The town looked as if it had  just been washed. People were out painting their fences. The cottonwood  trees were a-flicker with sticky, yellow little leaves, and the feathery  tamarisks were in pink bud. With the warm weather came freedom for  everybody. People were dug up, as it were. The very old people, whom one  had not seen all winter, came out and sunned themselves in the yard. The  double windows were taken off the houses, the tormenting flannels in  which children had been encased all winter were put away in boxes, and  the youngsters felt a pleasure in the cool cotton things next their  skin.    Thea had to walk more than a mile to reach the Kohlers' house, a very  pleasant mile out of town toward the glittering sand hills,--yellow this  morning, with lines of deep violet where the clefts and valleys were.  She followed the sidewalk to the depot at the south end of the town;  then took the road east to the little group of adobe houses where the  Mexicans lived, then dropped into a deep ravine; a dry sand creek,  across which the railroad track ran on a trestle. Beyond that gulch, on  a little rise of ground that faced the open sandy plain, was the  Kohlers' house, where Professor Wunsch lived. Fritz Kohler was the town  tailor, one of the first settlers. He had moved there, built a little  house and made a garden, when Moonstone was first marked down on the  map. He had three sons, but they now worked on the railroad and were  stationed in distant cities. One of them had gone to work for the Santa  Fe, and lived in New Mexico.    Mrs. Kohler seldom crossed the ravine and went into the town except at  Christmas-time, when she had to buy presents and Christmas cards to send  to her old friends in Freeport, Illinois. As she did not go to church,  she did not possess such a thing as a hat. Year after year she wore the  same red hood in winter and a black sunbonnet in summer. She made her  own dresses; the skirts came barely to her shoe-tops, and were gathered  as full as they could possibly be to the waistband. She preferred men's  shoes, and usually wore the cast-offs of one of her sons. She had never  learned much English, and her plants and shrubs were her companions. She  lived for her men and her garden. Beside that sand gulch, she had tried  to reproduce a bit of her own village in the Rhine Valley. She hid  herself behind the growth she had fostered, lived under the shade of  what she had planted and watered and pruned. In the blaze of the open  plain she was stupid and blind like an owl. Shade, shade; that was what  she was always planning and making. Behind the high tamarisk hedge, her  garden was a jungle of verdure in summer. Above the cherry trees and  peach trees and golden plums stood the windmill, with its tank on  stilts, which kept all this verdure alive. Outside, the sage-brush grew  up to the very edge of the garden, and the sand was always drifting up  to the tamarisks.    Every one in Moonstone was astonished when the Kohlers took the  wandering music-teacher to live with them. In seventeen years old Fritz  had never had a crony, except the harness-maker and Spanish Johnny. This  Wunsch came from God knew where,--followed Spanish Johnny into town when  that wanderer came back from one of his tramps. Wunsch played in the  dance orchestra, tuned pianos, and gave lessons. When Mrs. Kohler  rescued him, he was sleeping in a dirty, unfurnished room over one of  the saloons, and he had only two shirts in the world. Once he was under  her roof, the old woman went at him as she did at her garden. She sewed  and washed and mended for him, and made him so clean and respectable  that he was able to get a large class of pupils and to rent a piano. As  soon as he had money ahead, he sent to the Narrow Gauge lodging-house,  in Denver, for a trunkful of music which had been held there for unpaid  board. With tears in his eyes the old man--he was not over fifty, but  sadly battered--told Mrs. Kohler that he asked nothing better of God  than to end his days with her, and to be buried in the garden, under her  linden trees. They were not American basswood, but the European linden,  which has honey-colored blooms in summer, with a fragrance that  surpasses all trees and flowers and drives young people wild with joy.    Thea was reflecting as she walked along that had it not been for  Professor Wunsch she might have lived on for years in Moonstone without  ever knowing the Kohlers, without ever seeing their garden or the inside  of their house. Besides the cuckoo clock,--which was wonderful enough,  and which Mrs. Kohler said she kept for \"company when she was  lonesome,\"--the Kohlers had in their house the most wonderful thing Thea  had ever seen--but of that later.    Professor Wunsch went to the houses of his other pupils to give them  their lessons, but one morning he told Mrs. Kronborg that Thea had  talent, and that if she came to him he could teach her in his slippers,  and that would be better. Mrs. Kronborg was a strange woman. That word  \"talent,\" which no one else in Moonstone, not even Dr. Archie, would  have understood, she comprehended perfectly. To any other woman there,  it would have meant that a child must have her hair curled every day and  must play in public. Mrs. Kronborg knew it meant that Thea must practice  four hours a day. A child with talent must be kept at the piano, just as  a child with measles must be kept under the blankets. Mrs. Kronborg and  her three sisters had all studied piano, and all sang well, but none of  them had talent. Their father had played the oboe in an orchestra in  Sweden, before he came to America to better his fortunes. He had even  known Jenny Lind. A child with talent had to be kept at "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44114"],[0,"A Jay of Italy (#4)"],[1,"ees.  It startled her for a moment, and in that moment he was  gone, striding into the moonlight.  She saw a sword gleam in the shadow  of the tent.    'Carlo!' she hissed; 'Carlo! follow and kill him!'    Messer Lanti came out of his ambush, sheathing his blade.  His teeth  grinned in the white glow.  He sauntered up to her, and stood looking  down, hand on hip.    'Not for all the bona-robas in the world,' he said, and struck his hilt  lightly.  'This I dedicate to his service from this day.  Let who  crosses my little saint beware it.'    He burst out laughing, not fierce, but low.    'Thou art well served in thy confessor, woman.  Wert never dealt a  fitter penance.'    It was significant enough that he had no word but mockery for her  discomfiture.  He might have spitted the seduced on a point of  gallantry; for the siren, she was sacred through her calling.    In the meanwhile Bernardo had left the green, had passed the low,  roistering camp pitched at a respectful distance beyond, and had thrown  himself upon his knees in the wide fields.    'Sweet Jesus,' he prayed, 'O justify Thy Kingdom before Thy servant!  Already my young footsteps are warned of the bitter pass to come.  Be  Thou with me in the rocky ways, lest I faint and slip before my time.'    He remained long minutes beseeching, while the moon, anchored in a  little stream of clouds, seemed to his excited imagination the very boat  which awaited the coming of One who should walk the waters.  He  stretched out his arms to it.    'Lord save me,' he cried, 'or I sink!'    He heard a snuffle at his back, and looked round and up to find the fool  Cicada regarding him glassily.    'Sink!' stuttered the creature, swaying where he stood.  'Lord save me  too!  I am under already--drowned in Malmsey!'    Bembo rose to his feet with a happy sigh.  '_Exultate Deo adjutori  nostro!_' he murmured, 'I am answered.'    His clear, serene young brow confronted the fuddled wrinkles of the  other's like an angel's.    'Cicada mio,' he said endearingly; 'judge if God is dull of hearing,  when, on the echo of my cry, here is one holding out his hand to me!'    The Fool, staring stupidly, lifted his own lean right paw, and squinted  to focus his gaze on it.    'Meaning me?--meaning this?' he said.    Bembo nodded.    'A return, with interest, on the little service I was able to render  thee this morning.  O, I am grateful, Cicada!'    The Fool, utterly bemused, squatted him down on the grass in a sudden  inspiration, and so brought his wits to anchor.  Bernardo fell on his  knees beside him.    'What moved you to come and save me?' he said softly.  'What moved you?'    Cicada, disciplined to seize the worst occasion with an epigram, made a  desperate effort to concentrate his parts on the present one.    'The wine in my head,' he mumbled, waggling that sage member.  ''Tis the  wet-nurse to all valour.  I walked but out of the furnace a furlong to  cool myself, and lo!  I am a hero without knowing it.'    He looked up dimly, his face working and twitching in the moonlight.    'Recount, expound, and enucleate,' said he.  'From what has the Fool  saved the Parablist?'    'From the deep waters,' said Bembo, 'into which he had entered,  magnifying his height.'    The Fool fell a-chuckling.    'There was a hunter once,' said he, 'that thought he would sound his  horn to a hymn, and behold! he was chasing the deer before he had  fingered the first stops. Expound me the parable, Parablist.  Thou  preachest universal goodwill, they say?'    'Ay, do I.'    'Thou shalt be confuted with thine own text.'    'How, dear Fool?'    'Why, shall not every wife be kind to her friend's husband?'    'Ay, if she would be unkind to her own.'    The Fool scratched his head, his hood thrown back.    'And so, in thy wisdom, thou step'st into a puddle, and lo! it is over  thy ears.  Will you come out, good Signor Goodwill, and ride home in a  baby's pannier?'    Bembo caught one of the wrinkled hands in his soft palms.    'Dear Cicada,' he said, 'are there not tears in your heart the whiles  you mock?  Do you not love me, Cicada, as one you have saved from  death?'    Some sort of emotion startled the harsh features of the Fool.    'What better love could I show,' he muttered, 'than to warn thee back  from the toils that stretch for thy wings?'    'Ah, to warn me, to warn me, Cicada!' cried the boy, 'but not home to  the nest.  How shall he ever fly that fears to quit it?  Be rather like  my mother, Cicada, and advise these my simple wings.'    The Fool caught his breath in a sudden gasp--    'Thy mother!  I!'    A spasm of pain seemed to cross his face.  He laughed wildly.    'An Angel out of a Fool!  That were a worthy parent to hold divinity in  leading-strings.'    'Zitto, Cicca mio!' said Bembo sweetly, pressing a finger to his lips.  'Do I not know what wit goes to the acting of folly--what experience,  what observation?  If thou wouldst lend these all to my help and aid!'    'In what?'    'In this propaganda to govern men by love.'    'Thou playest, a child, with the cross-bow.'    'I know it.  I have been warned; direct thou my hand.'    'I!' exclaimed the Fool once more in a startled cry. And suddenly,  wonder of wonders! he was grovelling at the other's knees, pawing them,  weeping and moaning, hiding his face in the grass.    'What saint is this?' he cried, 'what saint that claims the Fool to his  guide?'    'Alas!' said the boy, 'no saint, but a child of the human God.'    'And He mated with Folly,' cried Cicada, 'and Folly is to direct the  bolt!'    He sat up, beating his brow in an ecstasy, then all in a moment forbore,  and was as calm as death.    'So be it,' he said.  'Be thou the divine fool, and I thy mother.'    With a quick movement Bembo caught the Fool's cheeks between his palms.    'Ay, mother,' said he, with a little choking laugh, 'but see that thy  hand on mine be steady, lest the quarrel fly wide or rebound upon  ourselves.'    It was the true mark indeed to which the cunning rascal had all this  time been sighting his bow.  He watched anxiously now for the tokens of  a hit.    The Fool sat very still awhile.    'Speak clearer,' he muttered; then of a sudden: 'What wouldst ask of  me?'    'Ah! dear,' sighed Bembo; 'only that thou wouldst justify thyself of  this new compact of ours.'    'I am clean--as thou readest love.  Who but God would consort with  Folly?  The Fool is cursed to virginity.'    'Cicada, dear, but there is no Chastity without Temperance.'    The Fool tore himself away, and slunk crouching back upon the grass.    'I renounce thy God!' he chattered hoarsely, 'that would have me false  to my love, my mistress, my one friend!  Who has borne me through these  passes, stood by me in pain and madness, dulled the bitter tooth of  shame while it tore my entrails?  Cure wantonness in women, gluttony in  wolves, before you ask me to be dastard to my dear.'    'Alas!' cried Bembo, 'then am I lost indeed!'    A long pause followed, till in a moment the Fool had flung himself once  more upon his face.    'Lay not this thing on me,' he cried, clutching at the grass; 'lay it  not!  It is to tear my last hope by the roots, to banish me from the  kingdom of dreams, to bury me in the everlasting ice!  I will follow  thee in all else, humbly and adoringly; I will try to vindicate this  love which has stooped from heaven to a clown; I will perish in thy  service--only waste not my paradise in the moment of its realisation.'    Bembo stooped, kneeling, and laid one hand softly on his shoulder.    'Poor Cicada,' he said, 'poor Cicada!  Alas!  I am a child where I had  hoped a man, and my head sinks beneath the waters.  Tired am I, and fain  to go rest my head in a lap that erst invited me.  Return thou to thy  bottle, as I to my love.'    The Fool, trailing himself up on his knees, caught his hands in a wild,  convulsive clutch.    'Fiend or angel!' he cried, 'thou shall not!--The woman!--The skirts of  the scarlet woman!  Go rest thyself--not there--but in peace.  From this  moment I abjure it--dost hear, I abjure it?  I kill my love for love's  sake.  O!  O!'    And he fell writhing, like a wounded snake, on the grass.    '_Salve, sancta parens!_' said Bembo, lifting up his hands fervently to  the queen of night.  The pious rogue was quite happy in his stratagem,  since it had won him his first convert to cleanness.                                       *CHAPTER III*      The lady of Casa Caprona had flown her tassel-gentle and missed her  quarry.  Outwardly she seemed little disturbed by her failure--as  insolent as indolent--an imperious serenity in a velvet frame.  The  occasion which had given, which was still giving, Carlo a tough thought  or two to digest, she had already, on the morning following her  discomfiture, assimilated, apparently without a pang.  'The which doth  demonstrate,' thought Cicada, as he took covert and venomous note of  her, 'a signal point of difference between the sexes.  In self-indulgent  wickedness there may be little to distinguish man from woman.  In the  reaction from it, there is this: The man is subject to qualms of  conscience; the woman is not.  She may be disenchanted, surfeited,  aggrieved against fate or circumstance; she is not offended with  herself.  Remorse never yet spoiled her sleep, unless where she desired  and doubted it on her account in another.  What she hath done she hath  done; and what she hath failed to do slumbers for her among the  unrealities--among things unborn--seeds in the womb of Romance, which,  though she be the first subject for it, she understands as little as she  does beauty.  From the outset hath she been manoeuvring to confuse the  Nature in man by using its distorted image in herself to lure him.
