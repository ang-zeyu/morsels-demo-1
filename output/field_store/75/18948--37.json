Certainly, woman suffrage in New Zealand was not adopted because the  Government was so stable, so strong, so democratic, that these conditions  must thus find fit expression. [Footnote: The Australasian colonies are  taking steps toward the formation of a Federal Union. While this book is  in press news comes that the Federal Convention, by a vote of 23 to 12,  has refused to allow women to vote for members of the House of  Representatives.]    South Australia not only gives women full suffrage, but makes them  eligible to a seat in Parliament. The colony is a vast, mountainous,  largely unsettled region, with a high proportion of native and Chinese,  and, in 1894, had but 73,000 voters, including the women. The Socialistic  Labor movement, which has played a large part in Australasian politics,  here succeeded in dominating the government. There was an attempt to  establish communistic villages with public money, a proposal to divide the  public money _pro rata,_ and one to build up a system of state life-  insurance; and taxes were to be levied on salaries, and on all incomes  above a certain point. It was found that the sixty thousand women who were  authorized to vote throughout Australia assisted the socialistic schemes  that are hindering progress and that tend to anarchy and not to  republicanism. There is a royal Governor, and suffrage is based on  household and property qualifications. It is an aristocratic and social  combination, not a triumph of democratic ideas or principles. Dr. Jacobi,  in her \"Common Sense applied to Woman Suffrage,\" says: \"The refusal to  extend parliamentary suffrage to women who are possessed of municipal  suffrage, does not mean, as Americans are apt to suppose, that women are  counted able to judge about the small concerns of a town, but not about  imperial issues. It means that women are still not counted able to  exercise independent judgment at all, and, therefore, are to remain  counted out when this is called for; but that the property to which they  happen to belong, and which requires representation, must not be deprived  of this on account of an entangling female alliance. This is the very  antipodes of the democratic doctrine, perhaps also somewhat excessive,  that a man requires representation so much that he must not be deprived of  it on account of the accident of not being able to read or write!\"    With Dr. Jacobi's interpretation, I will deal later. What I wish now to do  is, to call attention to her admission of the fact that woman suffrage in  England and in her colonies is not democratic, and to connect it with the  other fact that no republic, from that of Greece to our own, has  introduced it, although manhood suffrage has been universal in Switzerland  for many years, and in France since 1848.    So it would seem that under a monarchical system, with a standing army and  a hereditary nobility to support the throne, the royal mandate could be  issued by a woman. Any Queen, as well as the one that Alice met in  Wonderland, could say, \"Off with his head!\" But when freedom grew, and the  democratic idea began to prevail, and each individual man became a king,  and each home a castle, the law given by God and not by man came into  exercise, and upon each man was laid the duty of defending liberty and  those who were physically unfitted to defend themselves.    Let us turn now to our own country. Technically, at least, women possessed  the suffrage in our first settlements. In New England, in the early days,  when church-membership as the basis of the franchise excluded three-  fourths of the male inhabitants from its exercise, women could vote. Under  the old Provincial charters, from 1691 to 1780, they could vote for all  elective offices. From 1780 to 1785, under the Articles of Confederation,  they could vote for all elective offices except the Governor, the Council,  and the Legislature. The comment made upon this by the Suffrage writers  is, that \"the fact that woman exercised the right of suffrage amid so many  restrictions, is very significant of the belief in her right to the  ballot-box.\" My comment is, that the same lesson we have learned in Europe  is repeated here with wonderful emphasis. Under the transported  aristocracy of churchly power in the state, they shared the undemocratic  rule. When freedom broadened a little, and, under a system that still  acknowledged allegiance to the British Crown, all property-holders or  other \"duly qualified\" colonists could vote, they still had the voice that  England grants to-day, the voice of an estate. When liberty took another  step and a league was formed of \"firm friendship\" in which each Colony was  to be independent and yet banded for offensive and defensive aid, the  women were retired from the special vote on the result of which lay the  actual execution of the law. But this country was not yet a republic, or  even a nation. Washington himself said that the state of things under the  Articles of Confederation was hardly removed from anarchy. In 1789 a  constitution was adopted, which made the American people a nation. Its  preamble read: \"We, the people of the United States, in order to form a  more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity,  provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure  the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and  establish this Constitution for the United States of America.\" Under this  Constitution the last vestiges of churchly political rule, and of  property-qualification for voting, have gradually disappeared. New Jersey  was the last State to repeal her property-qualification laws. In 1709 she  made \"male freeholders\" who held a certain amount of property the only  voters. In 1790 her Constitution, through an error in wording, admitted  \"all inhabitants\" with certain property to vote. This was in force until  1807, when an act was passed conferring the suffrage upon \"free white male  citizens twenty-one years of age worth fifty pounds proclamation money,  clear estate,\" etc. From 1790 to 1807 a good many women, generally from  the Society of Friends, took part in elections. After 1807 they attempted  to do so, as owners of property. Finally, that qualification for the male  voter was done away with, and with it the woman-suffrage agitation  disappeared.    State after State, in carrying out the compact of the Federal Republic,  had inserted the word \"male\" into the Constitutions that embodied the  American conception of a more vital and enduring freedom.    But there are now four States of the Union where women have full suffrage,  a few where they have a measure of municipal suffrage, and many where they  have the school suffrage. What bearing do these facts have upon my claim  that woman suffrage is undemocratic?    The States where they have full suffrage are Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, and  Idaho. How far was its introduction into these States the result of  advanced legislation in accord with true republicanism? Utah Territory was  the first spot in the country in which the measure gained a foothold, and  that was not believed by its introducers to be a part of the United  States. The Mormons who founded Salt Lake City supposed themselves to be  settling on Mexican territory, outside the jurisdiction of American law.  Woman suffrage was almost coincident with its beginnings, and it came as a  legitimate part of the union of state and church, of communism, of  polygamy. The dangers that especially threaten a republican form of  government are anarchy, communism, and religious bigotry; and two of these  found their fullest expression, in this country, in the Mormon creed and  practice. Fealty to Mormonism was disloyalty to the United States  Government. Thus, the introduction of woman suffrage within our borders  was not only undemocratic, it was anti-democratic.    Woman suffrage was secured in Wyoming by means that bring dishonor upon  democracy. Wyoming was organized as a Territory in 1868. Many of its  native settlers were from Utah. For its vast, mountainous extent of nearly  98,000 square miles, the census gave a population of only 9,118 persons.  Of these the native-born numbered 5,605, foreign-born, 3,513. The males  numbered 7,219; the females, 1,899. The \"History of Woman Suffrage\"  records the fact that the measure was secured in the first Territorial  legislature through the political trickery of an illiterate and  discredited man, who was in the chair. Mr. Bryce, in \"The American  Commonwealth,\" alludes in a note to the same fact. Women voted in 1870. In  1871 a bill was passed repealing the suffrage act, but was vetoed by the  Governor, on the ground that, having been admitted, it must be given a  fair trial. An attempt to pass the repeal over his veto was lost by a  single vote. Certainly, the entrance of woman suffrage into Wyoming was  not a triumph of democratic progress and principle.    Colorado was admitted into the Union in 1876, and great efforts were made  by Suffragists to secure the \"Centennial\" State. This resulted in a  submission of the question to the people, who rejected it by a majority of  7,443 in a total vote of 20,665. From the first of the agitation for the  free coinage of silver, Colorado has been enthusiastically in favor of  that measure. In 1892 her devotion to it caused all parties to unite on  that issue and gave the vote of the State to General Weaver, Populist  candidate for President, and to David H. Waite, Populist candidate for  Governor. The question of woman suffrage was resubmitted to the people at  this election, and the constitutional amendment concerning it was carried  by a majority of only 5,000 in a total vote of 200,000. Neither that  movement nor its results present triumphant democracy.    In 1894 the Populist party of Idaho put a plank in its platform favoring  the submission of a woman-suffrage"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7335"],[0,"Jack Harkaway and His Son's Escape from the Brigands of Greece (#4)"],[1,"polite.\"    \"Quite as polite as you can expect.\"    \"What do you mean?\"    \"Oh, you know what I mean well enough.\"    \"I'm hanged if I do!\" protested Harvey, stoutly.    His manner caught Mr. Mole immediately.    So this led the old gentleman to reflect.    If Dick did not know, it would be as well to keep the adventure to  himself.    \"Is it possible, Harvey, that you don't know what has occurred?\"    \"No.\"    \"You don't know about Marietta?\"    \"No.\"    This decided Mole.    \"Marietta is here.\"    \"Never!\" said Dick, in accents of deep mystery.    \"A fact.\"    \"Never! And who the dickens is Marietta when she is at home?\"    \"Mrs. Harkaway's maid, to be sure.\"    Dick burst out laughing at this.    \"Why, Mr. Mole,\" he cried, \"what a sly old fox you are.\"    Mr. Mole stared again.    \"I don't quite understand what you are driving at, Mr. Harvey,\" said  he.    \"Don't you, though?--well, I do, old Slyboots.\"    \"Harvey!\"    \"Oh, don't you try to come the old soldier over me.\"    \"Sir!\" said Mr. Mole, rearing himself up to his full height upon his  timbers, \"I don't understand your slangy allusions to the ancient  military.\"    \"Why, it is clear enough that you brought her.\"    \"I what?\" almost shrieked Mr. Mole, indignantly.    \"Brought her, and your poor wife ought to know of it.\"    \"Sir?\" said Mole, \"if you are bent on insulting me, I shall leave your  company.\"    \"Go it, Mole,\" said Dick, laughing until the tears came into his eyes;  \"go it. The fact is, you have been sneaking about after that little  girl for a long while past; there can be no doubt about it.\"    \"Harvey, I repudiate your vile insinuations with scorn, The fact is,  that in your anxiety to fix some wickedness never contemplated upon me,  you forget all the most important part of the tale.\"    \"What?\"    \"Why, that girl has left the villa unprotected.\"    \"Nonsense! there's old Constantino there.\"    \"Useless.\"    \"And Mike.\"    \"He barks, but don't bite.\"    \"Besides; you may be mistaken,\" urged Dick.    \"Not I. I knew her at once, and what's more, she recognised me.\"    \"The deuce!\"    \"And she bolted directly I pronounced her name.\"    \"How was she dressed?\"    Mr. Mole gave a hurried description of Marietta's dress, and they want  off in search through the house and grounds after the flighty Marietta.           *       *       *       *       *    In another part of the grounds three men met.    \"Hunston.\"    \"Toro.\"    \"Captain.\"    \"Here.\"    \"All safe?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Good!\"    \"What have you learnt, Toro?\"    \"Not much.\"    \"And you, captain?\"    \"Nothing, or next to nothing,\" was the reply.    \"And you, Hunston?\"    \"I have gained knowledge,\" answered the latter; \"good, useful  knowledge.\"    The other two laughed heartily at this reply.    \"You were always of a studious turn of mind, Hunston.\"    \"Ha, ha, ha!\"    [Illustration: \"'WHAT HAVE YOU DISCOVERED?' ASKED THE CAPTAIN\"--ADV IN  GREECE, VOL II, PAGE 21]    It may be as well to mention that they had sought a secluded part of  the contessa's gardens, and met now by appointment.    They were all three arrayed in that peculiar style of costume which the  prince of darkness is popularly supposed to don when he makes his  appearance to German students, in certain weird and wild works of  fiction, or in the supernatural drama.    It sounded really remarkable to hear these three men, disguised as  devils, discussing matters generally in such an offhand manner.    The dresses of all three were alike nearly in every particular.    The only mark of distinction between them was a small straight feather  they wore in their caps.    One wore a yellow feather.    Another had a feather of brilliant red.    The third one's feather was of a bright emerald green.    Now these feathers were small, but yet, by reason of the conspicuous  colours, could be seen at a considerable distance.    \"What is it you have discovered?\" asked the captain.    \"Out with it, Hunston,\" said Toro, in his old impatient way.    \"Well, in the first place,\" was Hunston's reply, \"our letters to old  Mole and to the girl Marietta were perfectly successful.\"    \"Of course.\"    \"The vanity of the one, and the conceit of the other, made it an easy  matter.\"    \"It did.\"    \"I saw the interview from a snug place of concealment, and took care to  let her know it.\"    \"How?\"    \"By humming her song which you heard her sing up at the villa.\"    The latter looked somewhat alarmed at this.    \"Was that prudent?\"    \"Of course she did not see me, only we must get a thorough hold over  this girl, so as to have her as an accomplice in the enemy's camp  always.\"    \"Good.\"    \"Now let us get back to the ball-room, and see what is to be picked up  there.\"    Back they went, and arrived in the large ball-room just as a dance was  being got up.    The three diabolical companions deemed it prudent now to separate, that  no undue attention might be drawn upon their movements.    And they went sauntering about the rooms, each upon the look-out for  any slice of luck which might turn up.    Hunston had added a long red cloak to his costume, so as to envelope  his figure and cover his arm, for fear of accidentally running across  Harkaway or Harvey, or in fact, any of the party.    In this cloak he was wrapped, and silently watching two young and  lovely girls, whose grace and elegance were commanding universal  admiration.    One was fair as a lily, with light, golden, wavy hair, and full blue  eyes.    This beautiful girl it was who excited Hunston's curiosity    \"Who can she be? Perhaps Harvey's daughter,\" he thought    Now these two were equally lovely to gaze upon, the beauty of each  being of a totally different character.    \"If we can but spirit little Emily away to the mountains,\" said Hunston  to himself, \"I shall be able to repay them for all I have suffered.  Nay, more, I shall be able to satisfy the greed of Mathias and the  band, by making the accursed Harkaway disgorge some of his enormous  wealth.\"    A hand was placed upon his shoulder.    \"Hah!\"    \"It is I,\" said a voice in his ear.    And looking up, he beheld the devil in the red feather.    \"Mathias.\"    \"Hush! I have to rejoin a lady now, to whom I am engaged for the  dance.\"    \"The dance!\"    Mathias nodded.    \"She accepted at once a dance with the devil; I'll lead her a devil of  a dance.\"    And the brigand captain laughed hugely at his own conceit.    But Hunston was not in laughing humour.    \"I'm glad to find you so merry, captain.\"    The Greek did not observe his gloomy manner; he only replied--\"You will  be merry, too, when I tell you the cause.\"    \"I have no thought for the pleasures of these fools,\" said Hunston,  gruffly; \"I only think of business.\"    \"I too.\"    \"And yet you are going to dance, Captain Mathias.\"    \"For business reasons, solely,\" said the Greek.    \"Ho ho!\"    \"My partner is positively bristling with diamonds,\" said the brigand,  significantly.    Hunston was interested immediately.    \"Diamonds?\"    \"Aye! diamonds; and such diamonds, too. There is one as big as a nut, I  swear.\"    \"I must see this lady.\"    \"You shall.\"    \"Where is she to be seen?\"    \"Come with me,\" said the captain.    Away they went, squeezing through the crowds of dancers and maskers,  until they came to the smaller ball-room, where a lady stood in  conversation with a big man, admirably got up as a knight of the olden  time.    The lady Hunston recognised at a glance, from the description which  Mathias had given of her jewels.    Her finely-rounded arms were encircled by bracelets, set with the  richest diamonds, that matched a necklet of priceless worth apparently.    She wore a tiara, too, of the same costly making and setting.    The dance began.    It was a waltz.    Now the gallant Mathias acquitted himself to perfection in the dance,  carrying his fair and richly-attired partner through the crowded room  without getting at all jostled by the dancers.    Hunston followed their movements with the greatest possible interest,  and as they shot past him for the third time round the room, he  contrived to take from the Greek captain's hand one of the lady's  bracelets which he had with some dexterity removed.    The next round he was less successful.    As they shot past, the brigand's hand was outstretched, but Hunston  missed it, and a glittering object dropped to the floor. Hunston  stooped to recover it, when--    \"The lady has dropped something,\" said a voice in his ear.    \"What lady?\" he demanded, recovering himself quickly,    \"The contessa.\"    \"Ah! I see. But was it the contessa?\" he asked.    \"Yes.\"    \"Are you sure?\"    \"Yes. It is the lady dancing with your half-brother.\"    \"Eh!\"    Hunston started a little after these words.    They sounded very unpleasantly in his ear.    He had evidently been associated with Mathias by the speaker.    Now the latter was a strange-looking little being.    A stunted man, with broad, square shoulders, and got up to represent  the description which Victor Hugo has given us of his creation of  Quasimodo.    \"That is the contessa?\" said Hunston, recovering his presence of mind.    \"Yes.\"    \"I am very glad of it, for I shall be able to restore this to its  proper owner.\"    \"Of course.\"    Hunston arose, and with a slight inclination of the head, crossed the  room, as if in search of the contessa.    The dwarf regarded him eagerly as he went.    \"That's a rum one,\" he said to himself. \"He means to pocket the  contessa's bracelet. What a swindle! I thought there was something more  devilish about him than his dress.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Hunston fled precipitately to the gardens.    Close by the spot where he had previously met his companions in crime,  there was a man awaiting him with a big bundle.    \"Matteo, is it you?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Good; give me the other dress out. Quick! I must change, and be back  before my absence can be noticed.\"    As he spoke, he had already torn from the "]]]
