Some of the girls wanted to be made taller, and the  magician sprinkled some powder over their heads and they promptly shot up.  To every one I met I kept repeating: \"This is most extraordinary,--just  like a dream!\"    Then some one proposed that our house should be made to grow. The  magicians agreed, and as a preliminary began to take down some portions.  The dismantling over, they demanded money, or else they would not go on.  The cashier strongly objected. How could payment be made before the work  was completed? At this the magicians got wild and twisted up the building  most fearsomely, so that men and brickwork got mixed together, bodies  inside walls and only head and shoulders showing.    It had altogether the look of a thoroughly devilish business, as I told my  eldest brother. \"You see,\" said I, \"the kind of thing it is. We had better  call upon God to help us!\" But try as I might to anathematise them in the  name of God, my heart felt like breaking and no words would come. Then I  awoke.    A curious dream, was it not? Calcutta in the hands of Satan and growing  diabolically, within the darkness of an unholy mist!          SHAZADPUR,    _June_ 1891.      The schoolmasters of this place paid me a visit yesterday.    They stayed on and on, while for the life of me I could not find a word to  say. I managed a question or so every five minutes, to which they offered  the briefest replies; and then I sat vacantly, twirling my pen, and  scratching my head.    At last I ventured on a question about the crops, but being schoolmasters  they knew nothing whatever about crops.    About their pupils I had already asked them everything I could think of,  so I had to start over again: How many boys had they in the school? One  said eighty, another said a hundred and seventy-five. I hoped that this  might lead to an argument, but no, they made up their difference.    Why, after an hour and a half, they should have thought of taking leave, I  cannot tell. They might have done so with as good a reason an hour  earlier, or, for the matter of that, twelve hours later! Their decision  was clearly arrived at empirically, entirely without method.          SHAZADPUR,    _July_ 1891.      There is another boat at this landing-place, and on the shore in front of  it a crowd of village women. Some are evidently embarking on a journey and  the others seeing them off; infants, veils, and grey hairs are all mixed  up in the gathering.    One girl in particular attracts my attention. She must be about eleven or  twelve; but, buxom and sturdy, she might pass for fourteen or fifteen. She  has a winsome face--very dark, but very pretty. Her hair is cut short like  a boy's, which well becomes her simple, frank, and alert expression. She  has a child in her arms and is staring at me with unabashed curiosity, and  certainly no lack of straightforwardness or intelligence in her glance.  Her half-boyish, half-girlish manner is singularly attractive--a novel  blend of masculine nonchalance and feminine charm. I had no idea there  were such types among our village women in Bengal.    None of this family, apparently, is troubled with too much bashfulness.  One of them has unfastened her hair in the sun and is combing it out with  her fingers, while conversing about their domestic affairs at the top of  her voice with another, on board. I gather she has no other children  except a girl, a foolish creature who knows neither how to behave or talk,  nor even the difference between kin and stranger. I also learn that  Gopal's son-in-law has turned out a ne'er-do-well, and that his daughter  refuses to go to her husband.    When, at length, it was time to start, they escorted my short-haired  damsel, with plump shapely arms, her gold bangles and her guileless,  radiant face, into the boat. I could divine that she was returning from  her father's to her husband's home. They all stood there, following the  boat with their gaze as it cast off, one or two wiping their eyes with the  loose end of their _saris_. A little girl, with her hair tightly tied  into a knot, clung to the neck of an older woman and silently wept on her  shoulder. Perhaps she was losing a darling Didimani [1] who joined in her  doll games and also slapped her when she was naughty....    [Footnote 1: An elder sister is often called sister-jewel  (_Didimani_).]    The quiet floating away of a boat on the stream seems to add to the pathos  of a separation--it is so like death--the departing one lost to sight,  those left behind returning to their daily life, wiping their eyes. True,  the pang lasts but a while, and is perhaps already wearing off both in  those who have gone and those who remain,--pain being temporary, oblivion  permanent. But none the less it is not the forgetting, but the pain which  is true; and every now and then, in separation or in death, we realise how  terribly true.          ON BOARD A CANAL STEAMER GOING TO CUTTACK,    _August_ 1891.      My bag left behind, my clothes daily get more and more intolerably  disreputable,--this thought continually uppermost is not compatible with a  due sense of self-respect. With the bag I could have faced the world of  men head erect and spirits high; without it, I fain would skulk in  corners, away from the glances of the crowd. I go to bed in these clothes  and in them I appear in the morning, and on the top of that the steamer is  full of soot, and the unbearable heat of the day keeps one unpleasantly  moist.    Apart from this, I am having quite a time of it on board the steamer. My  fellow-passengers are of inexhaustible variety. There is one, Aghore Babu,  who cannot allude to anything, animate or inanimate, except in terms of  personal abuse. There is another, a lover of music, who persists in  attempting variations on the Bhairab[1] mode at dead of night, convincing  me of the untimeliness of his performance in more senses than one.    [Footnote: A Raga, or mode of Indian classical music, supposed to be  appropriate to the early dawn.]    The steamer has been aground in a narrow ditch of a canal ever since last  evening, and it is now past nine in the morning. I spent the night in a  corner of the crowded deck, more dead than alive. I had asked the steward  to fry some _luchis_ for my dinner, and he brought me some  nondescript slabs of fried dough with no vegetable accompaniments to eat  them with. On my expressing a pained surprise, he was all contrition and  offered to make me some hotch-potch at once. But the night being already  far advanced, I declined his offer, managed to swallow a few mouthfuls of  the stuff dry, and then, all lights on and the deck packed with  passengers, laid myself down to sleep.    Mosquitoes hovered above, cockroaches wandered around. There was a  fellow-sleeper stretched crosswise at my feet whose body my soles every  now and then came up against. Four or five noses were engaged in snoring.  Several mosquito-tormented, sleepless wretches were consoling themselves  by pulls at their hubble-bubble pipes; and above all, there rose those  variations on the mode _Bhairab_! Finally, at half-past three in the  morning, some fussy busy-bodies began loudly inciting each other to get  up. In despair, I also left my bed and dropped into my deck-chair to await  the dawn. Thus passed that variegated nightmare of a night.    One of the hands tells me that the steamer has stuck so fast that it may  take the whole day to get her off. I inquire of another whether any  Calcutta-bound steamer will be passing, and get the smiling reply that  this is the only boat on this line, and I may come back in her, if I like,  after she has reached Cuttack! By a stroke of luck, after a great deal of  tugging and hauling, they have just got her afloat at about ten o'clock.          TIRAN.    7_th September_ 1891.      The landing-place at Balia makes a pretty picture with its fine big trees  on either side, and on the whole the canal somehow reminds me of the  little river at Poona. On thinking it over I am sure I should have liked  the canal much better had it really been a river.    Cocoanut palms as well as mangoes and other shady trees line its banks,  which, turfed with beautifully green grass, slope gently down to the  water, and are sprinkled over with sensitive plants in flower. Here and  there are screwpine groves, and through gaps in the border of trees  glimpses can be caught of endless fields, stretching away into the  distance, their crops so soft and velvety after the rains that the eye  seems to sink into their depths. Then again, there are the little villages  under their clusters of cocoanut and date palms, nestling under the moist  cool shade of the low seasonal clouds.    Through all these the canal, with its gentle current, winds gracefully  between its clean, grassy banks, fringed, in its narrower stretches, with  clusters of water-lilies with reeds growing among them. And yet the mind  keeps fretting at the idea that after all it is nothing but an artificial  canal.    The murmur of its waters does not reach back to the beginning of time. It  knows naught of the mysteries of some distant, inaccessible mountain cave.  It has not flowed for ages, graced with an old-world feminine name, giving  the villages on its sides the milk of its breast. Even old artificial  lakes have acquired a greater dignity.    However when, a hundred years hence, the trees on its banks will have  grown statelier; its brand-new milestones been worn down and moss-covered  into mellowness; the date 1871, inscribed on its lock-gates, left behind  at a respectable distance; then, if I am reborn as my great-grandson and  come again to inspect the Cuttack estates along this canal, I may feel  differently towards it.          SHELIDAH,    _October_ 1891.      Boat after boat touches at the landing-place, and after a whole year  exiles are returning home from distant fields of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7959"],[0,"The Reign of Tiberius, Out of the First Six Annals of Tacitus; (#4)"],[1,"can be no doubt, that the common  people received him gladly. Again he says, \"Nihil esse Rempublicam;  appellationem modo, sine corpore et specie;\" \"The Republic is nothing  but an empty name, a phantom and a shadow.\" That Caesar should have seen  this, is the highest evidence of his genius: that Cicero did not see it,  is to himself, and to his country, the great misfortune of his career;  and to his admirers, one of the most melancholy events in Roman history.  The opinions of Tacitus were not far removed from the opinions of  Cicero, but they were modified by what he saw of Nerva and of Trajan:  he tells us, how Agricola looked forward to the blessings of a virtuous  Prince; and his own thoughts and writings would have been other, than  they are, had he witnessed the blameless monarchy of Hadrian and the  Antonines. The victims of a bad Emperor were taken usually from among  the nobles; many of them were little better, than their destroyer; and  his murders were confined, almost invariably, within the walls of Rome:  but the benefits of the Imperial system were extended into all the  provinces; and the judgment-seat of Caesar was the protection of  innumerable citizens. Many were the mistakes, many the misfortunes,  deplorable the mischiefs, of the Imperial administration; I wish neither  to deny, nor to conceal them: but here I must content myself with  speaking broadly, with presenting a superficial view of things; and,  upon the whole, the system of the Emperors was less bad than the decayed  and inadequate government, out of which it was developed. For the  change from the Republic to the Empire was hardly a revolution; and  the venerable names and forms of the old organisation were religiously  preserved. Still, the Consuls were elected, the Senate met and  legislated, Praetors and Legates went forth into the provinces, the  Legions watched upon the frontiers, the lesser Magistrates performed  their office; but above them was Caesar, directing all things,  controlling all things; the _Imperator_ and Universal Tribune, in whose  name all was done; the \"Praesens Divus,\" on whom the whole depended; at  once the master of the Imperial Commonwealth, and the minister of the  Roman People.    \"The Annals,\" and the history of Tiberius, have detained us, for the  most part, within the capital: \"The Agricola\" brings us into a province  of the Empire; and \"The Account of Germany\" will take us among the  savages beyond the frontier. I need scarcely mention, that our country  was brought within the Roman influence by Julius Caesar; but that  Caesar's enterprise was not continued by Augustus, nor by Tiberius;  though Caligula celebrated a fictitious triumph over the unconquered  Britons: that a war of about forty years was undertaken by Claudius,  maintained by Nero, and terminated by Domitian; who were respectively  \"the most stupid, the most dissolute, and the most timid of all the  Emperors.\" It was in the British wars, that Vespasian began his great  career, \"monstratus fatis\"; but the island was not really added to the  Empire, until Agricola subdued it for Domitian. \"The Life of Agricola\"  is of general interest, because it preserves the memory of a good and  noble Roman: to us, it is of special interest, because it records the  state of Britain when it was a dependency of the Caesars; \"adjectis  Britannis imperio.\" Our present fashions in history will not allow us  to think, that we have much in common with those natives, whom Tacitus  describes: but fashions change, in history as in other things; and in  a wiser time we may come to know, and be proud to acknowledge, that  we have derived a part of our origin, and perhaps our fairest  accomplishments, from the Celtic Britons. The narrative of Tacitus  requires no explanation; and I will only bring to the memory of my  readers, Cowper's good poem on Boadicea. We have been dwelling upon the  glories of the Roman Empire: it may be pardonable in us, and it is not  unpleasing, to turn for a moment, I will not say to \"the too vast orb\"  of our fate, but rather to that Empire which is more extensive than the  Roman; and destined to be, I hope, more enduring, more united, and more  prosperous. Horace will hardly speak of the Britons, as humane beings,  and he was right; in his time, they were not a portion of the Roman  World, they had no part in the benefits of the Roman government: he  talks of them, as beyond the confines of civility, \"in ultimos orbis  Britannos;\" as cut off by \"the estranging sea,\" and there jubilant in  their native practices, \"Visum Britannos hospitibus feros.\" But Cowper  says, no less truly, of a despised and rebel Queen;      _Regions Caesar never knew,    Thy posterity shall sway;    Where his Eagles never flew,    None invincible as they._    The last battles of Agricola were fought in Scotland; and, in the pages  of Tacitus, he achieved a splendid victory among the Grampian hills.  Gibbon remarks, however, \"The native Caledonians preserved in the  northern extremity of the island their wild independence, for which  they were not less indebted to their poverty than to their valour. Their  incursions were frequently repelled and chastised; but their country was  never subdued. The masters of the fairest and most wealthy climates of  the globe turned with contempt from gloomy hills assailed by the winter  tempest, from lakes concealed in a blue mist, and from cold and lonely  heaths, over which the deer of the forest were chased by a troop of  naked barbarians.\" The Scotch themselves are never tired of asserting,  and of celebrating, their \"independence\"; Scotland imposed a limit to  the victories of the Roman People, Scaliger says in his compliments to  Buchanan:      _Imperii fuerat Romani Scotia lines._    But it may be questioned, whether it were an unmixed blessing, to  be excluded from the Empire; and to offer a sullen resistance to its  inestimable gifts of humane life, of manners, and of civility.    To these things, the Germans also have manifested a strong dislike; and  they are more censurable than the Scotch, because all their knowledge of  the Romans was not derived from the intercourse of war. \"The Germany\"  of Tacitus is a document, that has been much discussed; and these  discussions may be numbered among the most flagrant examples of literary  intemperance: but this will not surprise us, when we allow for the  structure of mind, the language, and the usual productions of those,  to whom the treatise is naturally of the greatest importance. In the  description of the Germans, Tacitus goes out of his way to laugh at the  \"licentia vetustatis,\" \"the debauches of pedants and antiquarians;\"  as though he suspected the fortunes of his volume, and the future  distinctions of the Teutonic genius. For sane readers, it will be enough  to remark, that the Germany of Tacitus was limited, upon the west, by  the natural and proper boundary of the Rhine; that it embraced a portion  of the Low Countries; and that, although he says it was confined within  the Danube, yet the separation is not clear between the true Germans and  those obscurer tribes, whose descendants furnish a long enumeration  of titles to the present melancholy sovereign of the House of Austria.  Gibbon remarks, with his usual sense, \"In their primitive state of  simplicity and independence, the Germans were surveyed by the discerning  eye, and delineated by the masterly pencil of Tacitus, the first  historian who supplied the science of philosophy to the study of facts.  The expressive conciseness of his descriptions has deserved to exercise  the diligence of innumerable antiquarians, and to excite the genius and  penetration of the philosophic historians of our own time.\" Upon a  few sentences out of the \"Germania\"; which relate to the kings, to the  holding of land, to the public assemblies, and to the army; an imposing  structure of English constitutional history has been erected: our modern  historians look upon this treatise with singular approval; because  it shows them, they say, the habits of their own forefathers in their  native settlements. They profess to be enchanted with all they read;  and, in their works, they betray their descent from the ancestors they  admire. Gibbon says, prettily, \"Whenever Tacitus indulges himself in  those beautiful episodes, in which he relates some domestic transaction  of the Germans or of the Parthians, his principal object is to relieve  the attention of the reader from an uniform scene of vice and misery.\"  Whether he succeeds, I must leave my readers to decide. Tacitus  describes the quarrels of the Germans; fought, then with weapons; now,  with words: their gambling, their sloth, their drunkenness. \"Strong  beer, a liquor extracted with very little art from wheat or barley,  and _corrupted_ (as it is strongly expressed by Tacitus) into a certain  semblance of wine, was sufficient for the gross purposes of German  debauchery.\" Tacitus informs us, too, \"that they sleep far into the day;  that on rising they take a bath, usually of warm water; then they eat.\"  To pass an entire day and night in drinking, disgraces no one: \"Dediti  somno ciboque,\" he says; a people handed over to sloth and gluttony.  Some of these customs are now almost obsolete; the baths, for instance.  In others, there has been little alteration since the Age of Tacitus;  and the Germans have adhered, with obstinate fidelity, to their  primitive habits. Tacitus thought less of their capacity, upon the  whole, than it is usual to think now: \"The Chatti,\" he says, \"for  Germans, have much intelligence;\" \"Leur intelligence et leur finesse  etonnent, dans des Germains.\" But let us forget these \"Tedeschi lurchi,  non ragionam di lor;\" and pass on to those manly virtues, which Tacitus  records: To abandon your shield, is the basest of crimes, \"relicta non  bene parmula;\" nor may a man thus disgraced be present at their sacred  rites, nor enter their council;"]]]
