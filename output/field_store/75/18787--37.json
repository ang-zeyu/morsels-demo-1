At noon Guiseppe came home, out of sorts and cross. His coming was like  a shadow on the happiness that Marta and Pappina felt.    \"No money,\" he growled as he rattled the Punchinellos into a corner. \"I  might as well have stayed at home. I'm sick of playing to such dogs.\"  Pappina and Marta were silent. \"Is it done?\" he asked, noticing the red  dress in Marta's hands.    \"Yes.\"    \"I'll try what youth and beauty will do. I'll take her to the Toledo  with the Punchinellos. Can you sing, girl?\" he asked turning his  glowering eyes on Pappina.    \"_Si_, signor.\"    \"Get up and give us a song; dance if you can. I feed and clothe no one  who can't earn what I give.\"    He waited a moment, watching Pappina's flashing eyes. She made no move  to obey him, but, looking at Marta who sat with downcast lids, she  followed her example of silence. In all the poverty of her home no such  crossness had ever been shown Pappina, and she was not quick to submit  to tyranny.    \"Why don't you do as I tell you, girl?\" exclaimed Guiseppe  threateningly.    \"Because, Signor Guiseppe, I couldn't sing for you when you are so  cross and mean. When we go this afternoon to the Toledo, if you're good  to me, I will sing and dance, and they'll give me money, lots of it.\"    \"_Per bacco!_ The minx has courage!\" Guiseppe muttered, then added  gruffly: \"Dress, then, at once. We'll go and see what stuff you're made  of.\"    It was a small matter to put on the new shoes and don the simple little  frock. As Pappina was putting on the bright dress she could hardly  stand still. It was so fine to her that she could scarcely believe it  was her own.    Suddenly remembering who had given her the money with which to buy the  gorgeous garment, she ran to Guiseppe. Climbing upon his knee, she  threw her arms about his neck.    \"Oh, Signor Guiseppe,\" she exclaimed, all her anger forgotten, \"look at  me, quickly! I am Pappina Pierno. You wouldn't know it, but I am really  and truly the same little girl. Do I look well? Are you proud of me?  Do you like my red dress? Will every one know it is new--and my shoes,  too?\"    She plied him with a hundred questions all at once, it seemed to  Guiseppe, who had never before had a child in his home. He did not  even like children, and yet he felt a delight in having this impetuous  little beauty dash at him and in her excitement nearly knock him off  his chair.    \"_Bella bambina!_\" he exclaimed involuntarily, while good Marta smiled  at the sight.    All was now in readiness. Guiseppe, Marta and Pappina, with the  Punchinellos, were off.    For years Guiseppe and Maria had not walked side by side. Guiseppe had  a way of going ahead, letting Marta follow like a faithful dog after  his master. To-day, as usual, Guiseppe took the lead, striding through  the network of lanes and streets certain that Marta with Pappina was  close at his heels. But everything was so new to Pappina that progress  was slow.    Every minute she would beg Marta to stop while she feasted her eyes on  the wonders of the shop windows; and Marta was torn between her desire  to please the child, who had already brought so much pleasure into her  hard life, and her desire to avoid angering Guiseppe.    \"Oh, Marta, can't you wait just a minute to see these pretty things?\"  Pappina would exclaim, stopping at a jeweler's.    \"Not to-day, _carina_--another day. Now we must hurry.\"    \"But just to see these pictures--\"    \"No, _carina_, look! Guiseppe is far ahead. It is there at the bend of  the street by that statue that he always stops when he plays on the  Toledo.\"    At the mention of the Toledo, Pappina was only too ready to hurry along  with Marta. So, half running, they reached Guiseppe's side just as he  set up the Punchinellos.    Pappina, looking with disappointment up and down the street, asked:  \"Marta, is this the Toledo?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Then where are all the grand people in their fine carriages?\"    \"The grand people have nearly all gone away from Naples, away to the  coast, where it is cool,\" Marta replied.    The crowd was now considered large enough to warrant a performance of  the show.    Pappina was the most interested of the spectators. When she had seen  the show with Filippo she had been so absorbed in the puppets' actions  that she had not noticed it was Guiseppe who moved them, spoke for  them with a change of voice, and lived through all their passions  for them. To-day, standing close to him, she understood. She looked  wonderingly, first at him, then at the puppets, and knowing that it was  all make-believe, she did not cry out against the villain's actions.    When the play was finished, both Pappina and Marta passed through the  crowd to collect the pay for the performance, but there were only a  few _soldi_ from the sprinkling of soldiers--nothing more.    Guiseppe was on the point of bursting out in angry abuse when he  bethought himself.    \"Try your luck, girl,\" he said roughly to Pappina. \"Sing, dance, give  us a gay one.\"    Pappina hesitated, then she looked at her new dress and shoes, took up  her tambourine, and began to sing.    The liquid notes poured forth as from the throat of a nightingale. She  forgot the people and where she was, forgot everything but her song.  Her voice rang out so clear and pure that even the lazy, loafing boys  threw away their cigarettes and joined the crowd that was holding its  breath to catch the silvery sweetness of the tiny singer's song.    The last notes were unheard, so loud were the cheers they gave her.    Guiseppe, the money-lover, was chuckling with pleasure and anticipation.    \"Pass your tambourine,\" he commanded.    The ragged boys dived into their pockets to see if there was even _un  soldo_ to give. Young black-haired, bareheaded women found a small  coin or two. Pale-faced Neapolitan loafers with the drapery of their  cloaks thrown over their shoulders, having nothing to offer but shouts  of approval, slunk away before the tambourine reached them. Old women  all rags and fangs, weak little girls supporting big babies, eager to  hear another song, tried in vain to find something for the singer.    What little there was in the tambourine Guiseppe soon had in his pocket.    \"The girl's too good for such beggars,\" he said as he took up the  Punchinellos and started down the street.    Pappina, pleased with his praise, walked proudly beside him, prattling,  humming, laughing, pointing here and there, enthusiastic over every new  thing she saw.    \"Guiseppe, where are we going now?\" she inquired.    It was a question Marta had longed to ask, but had not dared. The  change in Guiseppe was too recent for Marta to believe he would  continue good-tempered long.    Certainly since hearing Pappina sing, Guiseppe had seemed in good  spirits. The visions of much money cheered him so that he was gracious  even to Marta.    \"We are going now to Porta Capuana, songstress,\" he laughingly replied.  Noticing Marta's surprised look, he added kindly to her: \"I've never  done well there myself, but if all those others can make a living there  I guess Pappina can draw the money with her voice.\"    Porta Capuana is a quarter of Naples where street singers congregate.  Here, also, one may find public readers who follow in the footsteps of  ancient poets like Homer and tell their stories to the public in person  instead of through the cold type of the printer.    Pappina, proud of Guiseppe's praise, smiled happily into his face and  walked close by his side, in her childish way holding with one hand a  corner of his coat.    The almost deafening shouts of the quack doctors trying to sell their  cure-alls, and stopping occasionally to pull teeth, frightened Pappina.  She clung so tightly to Guiseppe's coat that he turned to look at her.  Her bright, happy expression had changed to one of fear. Guiseppe took  hold of her trembling hand, reassured her, and leading her to a place  where the quacks and their victims were out of sight, he said in the  kindest tone he had ever used:    \"_Canta_ [Sing], _bambina_.\"    Away from the din, with loving Marta on one side, protecting Guiseppe  on the other, Pappina quickly forgot her fear. She sang and danced;  money was given freely. She was happy. She and Guiseppe were the best  of friends, and they were having a glorious time.    Such noise and such bustle! Such scenes and such macaroni!    Guiseppe apparently was really enjoying Pappina's happiness. He looked  pleased when she smiled into his face, patted his sleeve, pulled his  coat or squeezed his big hand, always willing to sing and do his  bidding.    It was a good day for them all. It passed only too quickly for Pappina,  who did not wish to go home, and begged to stay to see the lights and  hear the band. She gave in sweetly when she was refused, however, and  was taken home and put to bed, too tired after the exciting day to  think once of the loved ones in San Lucia.                                        CHAPTER III                              FESTE DAY IN NAPLES      Italy, the land of sunshine! Its hills and valleys, churches and  palaces are famous for their historic treasures. But when the  sightseers arrive to view this birthplace of history they are annoyed  on every hand by hoards of _lazzaroni_ (beggars). Every one seems  hungry for money.    Now that Guiseppe had possession of Pappina he felt himself in a fair  way to appease his hunger, for, with all the poverty surrounding the  splendid churches and palaces, the people of Italy are joyous and  mirthloving, and give freely to those who amuse them.    For a couple of weeks after securing control of Pappina, Guiseppe  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45573"],[0,"Out with Garibaldi: A story of the liberation of Italy (#4)"],[1,"Forli, being one of the leaders  of the liberal party in Rome. His wife, too, was an enthusiast in the  cause; and although he felt no sympathy whatever with Mazzini and the  revolutionary party, he was, even before the arrival of Garibaldi,  resolved to take up arms should Rome be attacked. The presence of  Garibaldi still further confirmed this resolution; but as soon as he  heard that a French expedition had set sail, he had insisted that his  wife and child should leave the city, for he by no means shared the  general belief that the French were coming as allies. Her mother  accompanied her to Leghorn, for the professor was as anxious as Percival  that his wife and daughter should be in a place of safety.    They were most reluctant to go, and only yielded when Signor Forli and  Captain Percival declared that their presence in Rome would hamper their  movements and render it impossible for them to make their escape if the  city should be taken, which both foresaw would be the case. They  promised that when they found all was lost they would leave the city and  join them at Leghorn. Madame Forli was to take her maiden name again;  and as two English ladies staying at an hotel at Leghorn they would be  safe from annoyance even if a French or Austrian army marched through  the town. The professor spoke English well, and once out of the city he  and Leonard would be able to pass as two English tourists travelling  from Naples to Florence.    Had the Pope sought refuge in Capua or Malta, events might have taken a  very different turn; but he threw himself into the hands of the King of  Naples, and went the length of pronouncing him to be a model monarch, a  pattern to the rest of Europe, and this at a time when the disclosures  that had been made respecting the horrible dungeons into which all  Neapolitans suspected of entertaining liberal views were thrown, were  filling Europe with horror.    This change of front extinguished the hopes of those who had imagined  that the Pope would become the centre of liberal thought in Italy,  rendered the people of the papal dominions desperate, and vastly  increased the party of Mazzini and the extreme republicans. On February  9th a constituent assembly was held in Rome, and the republic was  proclaimed. Garibaldi was appointed to defend the frontier. Volunteers  poured in from all parts of Italy, and as the King of Sardinia had again  taken up arms, a force was moving forward to support him, when the news  came of his defeat at Novara, followed by his abdication and the  succession of Victor Emmanuel to the throne. Austria, Naples, and Spain  were now eager to crush the revolution in Rome; but the resolution of  the Romans was unshaken, and they still hoped to be able to maintain  themselves with, as they expected, the aid of France.    The terrible blow that had been inflicted on finding that the French  were coming as enemies, instead of as friends, did not shake their  determination, although it was now with a courage of despair rather than  of hope that they prepared for the conflict. Rome must fall; but at  least it would prove itself worthy of its best traditions, and set an  example that would not be lost upon the peoples of Italy. Anything, they  felt, would be better than the reign of a pope in close alliance with  the tyrant of Naples; and the evening after the French landing saw Rome  tranquil and grimly determined. Doubtless many of those who were  resolved to fight till the last were buoyed up with the hope that in any  case they would be able to make their escape when the action was over.  Rome covered a great extent of ground, and the French army was not of  sufficient strength to form a cordon round it.    Captain Percival had, a fortnight before, sent his finished and  unfinished canvases and all his most valuable belongings down to Civita  Vecchia, and had shipped them for England. He knew the reckless  destruction carried out by an army after a successful assault, and that  possibly, if it came to street to street fighting, a considerable  portion of the city might be burnt. The professor had similarly sent  away his very valuable collection of coins, books, and manuscripts. At  nine o'clock they went down to the mansion that Garibaldi occupied. A  long discussion took place, and routes were decided upon for the various  contingents to follow when the alarm was given. News had been brought in  from time to time during the day as to the movements of the French, and  the point at which they would probably assault was therefore now known.  It would be either at the Porta Cavalleggieri or at the Porta San  Pancrazio.    Captain Percival and the professor returned to the former's house, where  the professor had taken up his residence since his wife had gone to  Leghorn, and sat talking until a late hour. They were roused early the  next morning by the ringing of the great bells of the cathedral, which  were joined almost immediately by those of all the other churches in the  city. Captain Percival had lain down fully dressed, and springing to his  feet, he buckled on a sword, placed a brace of pistols in his belt, and  then ran down to the Porta San Pancrazio, where, as he knew, Garibaldi  would take up his post. The general, indeed, had not slept at all, but,  fearful that the French might attempt an assault under cover of  darkness, kept watch round the western wall, along which he had posted  the men he could most depend upon. Even before the Englishman joined  Garibaldi the roar of the guns on the wall told that the French were  already advancing.    \"It is like old times, comrade,\" Garibaldi said, with a strong grip of  his hand, \"only it is on a larger scale than we were accustomed to in  South America. Oudinot is beginning with a blunder, for he is making for  the Porta Cavalleggieri, which is flanked by the walls of the Vatican.  He is over-confident, and I do not imagine that he expects anything like  a serious resistance. I think we shall certainly beat him back there,  and that then he will attack us here. Will you go to the other gate? All  my old comrades know you, and, indeed, all the volunteers, as you have  assisted to drill them.\"    Oudinot, indeed, had believed that the force of regular troops he had  with him would easily brush aside the resistance of a half-armed mob.    Captain Percival hurried away. The volunteers were already gathered on  the walls, and in every street the townspeople were hurrying out, armed  with weapons of all kinds. On the roofs and at the windows of the houses  women were clustered thickly, waving their handkerchiefs and scarves,  and shouting words of encouragement and applause to the men. To the roar  of cannon was now added the rattle of musketry. When he reached the gate  he found a heavy column of volunteers drawn up there, while behind them  was a dense crowd of excited citizens. From the wall he saw the French  advancing; the leading regiment was but a few hundred yards away. They  were moving steadily forward, apparently heedless of the cannon that  thundered on their flank and face. The musketry they could afford to  despise, for they were beyond the distance at which any accurate  shooting was possible; and, indeed, the firing was of the wildest  description, as comparatively few of the men had ever handled a gun  until a few weeks previously. Captain Percival went up to the officer  who was in command, and with whom he was well acquainted. Although the  massive walls still stood, the gates had long since disappeared, their  places being occupied simply by barriers, where the duty on provisions  and goods coming into the city was collected.    \"The men are clamouring to be let out,\" he said. \"What do you think,  Captain Percival?\"    \"I should let them go soon. They are full of dash and enthusiasm at  present, and would fight far better on the offensive than they would if  they are kept stationary. I should keep them in hand till the French are  within seventy or eighty yards of the gate. By that time they will be  answering the fire from the walls, and even those in the front lines,  whose muskets are still loaded, will only have time for one shot before  our men are upon them. I should place three or four hundred of your  steadiest men on the wall here, so that if the sortie is repulsed, they  can cover the retreat by their fire.\"    \"I think that is good advice,\" the other said. \"Will you come down with  me, and tell them that they shall go, but that they must not move till I  give the order, and that no man is to fire until he is within ten yards  of the enemy's line.\"    It was difficult to make their voices heard above the crack of musketry  and the shouts of the excited crowd; however, their words were passed  from man to man, and so back among the people behind. Now that they knew  that they were to have their way, and that the critical movement was at  hand, the shouting abated, and a stern look of determination settled on  their faces. Leonard Percival joined a group of officers who were at the  head of the volunteers, and the officer in command resumed his place on  the wall, as it was all-important that, if the sortie were repulsed, he  should lead his men down and oppose the entrance of the enemy until the  retiring force had rallied.    It was not long before a roll of musketry broke out, showing that the  assailants were now returning the fire of the Garibaldians on the wall.  It grew louder and louder; and then, when the head of the French column  was some eighty yards away, the officer on the wall gave the order, and  the volunteers followed by the citizens poured out with a mighty shout.  The French halted for a moment in surprise, not having dreamt that the  defenders of the town would venture upon sallying out to attack them.  Then there was a scattered fire of musketry; but most of the barrels  were already empty, and few of the balls took effect. Without replying,  the "]]]
