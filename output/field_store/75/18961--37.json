The mattress  was partly transparent, a fact he observed with a strange sense of  insecurity, and below it was a mirror reflecting him greyly. About  his arm--and he saw with a shock that his skin was strangely dry and  yellow--was bound a curious apparatus of rubber, bound so cunningly that  it seemed to pass into his skin above and below. And this strange bed  was placed in a case of greenish coloured glass (as it seemed to him), a  bar in the white framework of which had first arrested his attention.  In the corner of the case was a stand of glittering and delicately made  apparatus, for the most part quite strange appliances, though a maximum  and minimum thermometer was recognisable.    The slightly greenish tint of the glass-like substance which surrounded  him on every hand obscured what lay behind, but he perceived it was a  vast apartment of splendid appearance, and with a very large and simple  white archway facing him. Close to the walls of the cage were articles  of furniture, a table covered with a silvery cloth, silvery like the  side of a fish, a couple of graceful chairs, and on the table a number  of dishes with substances piled on them, a bottle and two glasses. He  realised that he was intensely hungry.    He could see no human being, and after a period of hesitation scrambled  off the translucent mattress and tried to stand on the clean white floor  of his little apartment. He had miscalculated his strength, however,  and staggered and put his hand against the glasslike pane before him to  steady himself. For a moment it resisted his hand, bending outward like  a distended bladder, then it broke with a slight report and vanished--a  pricked bubble. He reeled out into the general space of the hall,  greatly astonished. He caught at the table to save himself, knocking one  of the glasses to the floor--it rang but did not break--and sat down in  one of the armchairs.    When he had a little recovered he filled the remaining glass from the  bottle and drank--a colourless liquid it was, but not water, with a  pleasing faint aroma and taste and a quality of immediate support and  stimulus. He put down the vessel and looked about him.    The apartment lost none of its size and magnificence now that the  greenish transparency that had intervened was removed. The archway he  saw led to a flight of steps, going downward without the intermediation  of a door, to a spacious transverse passage. This passage ran between  polished pillars of some white-veined substance of deep ultramarine,  and along it came the sound of human movements and voices and a deep  undeviating droning note. He sat, now fully awake, listening alertly,  forgetting the viands in his attention.    Then with a shock he remembered that he was naked, and casting about him  for covering, saw a long black robe thrown on one of the chairs beside  him. This he wrapped about him and sat down again, trembling.    His mind was still a surging perplexity. Clearly he had slept, and had  been removed in his sleep. But here? And who were those people, the  distant crowd beyond the deep blue pillars? Boscastle? He poured out and  partially drank another glass of the colourless fluid.    What was this place?--this place that to his senses seemed subtly  quivering like a thing alive? He looked about him at the clean and  beautiful form of the apartment, unstained by ornament, and saw that the  roof was broken in one place by a circular shaft full of light, and, as  he looked, a steady, sweeping shadow blotted it out and passed, and came  again and passed. \"Beat, beat,\" that sweeping shadow had a note of its  own in the subdued tumult that filled the air.    He would have called out, but only a little sound came into his throat.  Then he stood up, and, with the uncertain steps of a drunkard, made his  way towards the archway. He staggered down the steps, tripped on the  corner of the black cloak he had wrapped about himself, and saved  himself by catching at one of the blue pillars.    The passage ran down a cool vista of blue and purple, and ended remotely  in a railed space like a balcony, brightly lit and projecting into a  space of haze, a space like the interior of some gigantic building.  Beyond and remote were vast and vague architectural forms. The tumult of  voices rose now loud and clear, and on the balcony and with their backs  to him, gesticulating and apparently in animated conversation, were  three figures, richly dressed in loose and easy garments of bright soft  colourings. The noise of a great multitude of people poured up over the  balcony, and once it seemed the top of a banner passed, and once some  brightly coloured object, a pale blue cap or garment thrown up into the  air perhaps, flashed athwart the space and fell. The shouts sounded like  English, there was a reiteration of \"Wake!\" He heard some indistinct  shrill cry, and abruptly the three men began laughing.      \"Ha, ha, ha!\" laughed one--a red-haired man in a short purple robe.  \"When the Sleeper wakes--_When!_\"    He turned his eyes full of merriment along the passage. His face  changed, the whole man changed, became rigid. The other two turned  swiftly at his exclamation and stood motionless. Their faces assumed an  expression of consternation, an expression that deepened into awe.    Suddenly Graham's knees bent beneath him, his arm against the pillar  collapsed limply, he staggered forward and fell upon his face.        CHAPTER IV. THE SOUND OF A TUMULT    Graham's last impression before he fainted was of a clamorous ringing of  bells. He learnt afterwards that he was insensible, hanging between life  and death, for the better part of an hour. When he recovered his senses,  he was back on his translucent couch, and there was a stirring warmth  at heart and throat. The dark apparatus, he perceived, had been removed  from his arm, which was bandaged. The white framework was still about  him, but the greenish transparent substance that had filled it was  altogether gone. A man in a deep violet robe, one of those who had been  on the balcony, was looking keenly into his face.    Remote but insistent was a clamour of bells and confused sounds, that  suggested to his mind the picture of a great number of people shouting  together. Something seemed to fall across this tumult, a door suddenly  closed.    Graham moved his head. \"What does this all mean?\" he said slowly. \"Where  am I?\"    He saw the red-haired man who had been first to discover him. A voice  seemed to be asking what he had said, and was abruptly stilled.    The man in violet answered in a soft voice, speaking English with a  slightly foreign accent, or so at least it seemed to the Sleeper's ears,  \"You are quite safe. You were brought hither from where you fell asleep.  It is quite safe. You have been here some time--sleeping. In a trance.\"    He said something further that Graham could not hear, and a little phial  was handed across to him. Graham felt a cooling spray, a fragrant mist  played over his forehead for a moment, and his sense of refreshment  increased. He closed his eyes in satisfaction.    \"Better?\" asked the man in violet, as Graham's eyes reopened. He was a  pleasant-faced man of thirty, perhaps, with a pointed flaxen beard, and  a clasp of gold at the neck of his violet robe.    \"Yes,\" said Graham.    \"You have been asleep some time. In a cataleptic trance. You have heard?  Catalepsy? It may seem strange to you at first, but I can assure you  everything is well.\"    Graham did not answer, but these words served their reassuring purpose.  His eyes went from face to face of the three people about him. They were  regarding him strangely. He knew he ought to be somewhere in Cornwall,  but he could not square these things with that impression.    A matter that had been in his mind during his last waking moments at  Boscastle recurred, a thing resolved upon and somehow neglected. He  cleared his throat.    \"Have you wired my cousin?\" he asked. \"E. Warming, 27, Chancery Lane?\"    They were all assiduous to hear. But he had to repeat it. \"What an odd  _blurr_ in his accent!\" whispered the red-haired man. \"Wire, sir?\" said  the young man with the flaxen beard, evidently puzzled.    \"He means send an electric telegram,\" volunteered the third, a  pleasant-faced youth of nineteen or twenty. The flaxen-bearded man gave  a cry of comprehension. \"How stupid of me! You may be sure everything  shall be done, sir,\" he said to Graham. \"I am afraid it would be  difficult to--wire to your cousin. He is not in London now. But don't  trouble about arrangements yet; you have been asleep a very long time  and the important thing is to get over that, sir.\" (Graham concluded the  word was sir, but this man pronounced it \"Sire.\")    \"Oh!\" said Graham, and became quiet.    It was all very puzzling, but apparently these people in unfamiliar  dress knew what they were about. Yet they were odd and the room was odd.  It seemed he was in some newly established place. He had a sudden flash  of suspicion. Surely this wasn't some hall of public exhibition! If it  was he would give Warming a piece of his mind. But it scarcely had  that character. And in a place of public exhibition he would not have  discovered himself naked.    Then suddenly, quite abruptly, he realised what had happened. There was  no perceptible interval of suspicion, no dawn to his knowledge. Abruptly  he knew that his trance had lasted for a vast interval; as if by some  processes of thought reading he interpreted the awe in the faces that  peered into his. He looked at them strangely, full of intense emotion.  It seemed they read his eyes. He framed his lips to speak and could not.  A queer impulse to hide his knowledge came into his mind almost at the  moment of his discovery. He looked at his bare feet, regarding then  silently. His impulse to speak passed. He was trembling exceedingly.    They gave him some pink fluid with a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7766"],[0,"A Dog of Flanders (#4)"],[1,"his darling.  But Nello said nothing.    The same leaven was working in him that in other times begat Rubens and  Jordaens and the Van Eycks, and all their wondrous tribe, and in times  more recent begat in the green country of the Ardennes, where the Meuse  washes the old walls of Dijon, the great artist of the Patroclus, whose  genius is too near us for us aright to measure its divinity.    Nello dreamed of other things in the future than of tilling the little  rood of earth, and living under the wattle roof, and being called Baas  by neighbors a little poorer or a little less poor than himself. The  cathedral spire, where it rose beyond the fields in the ruddy evening  skies or in the dim, gray, misty mornings, said other things to him than  this. But these he told only to Patrasche, whispering, childlike, his  fancies in the dog's ear when they went together at their work through  the fogs of the daybreak, or lay together at their rest among the  rustling rushes by the water's side.    For such dreams are not easily shaped into speech to awake the slow  sympathies of human auditors; and they would only have sorely perplexed  and troubled the poor old man bedridden in his corner, who, for his  part, whenever he had trodden the streets of Antwerp, had thought the  daub of blue and red that they called a Madonna, on the walls of the  wine-shop where he drank his sou's worth of black beer, quite as good as  any of the famous altar-pieces for which the stranger folk travelled far  and wide into Flanders from every land on which the good sun shone.    There was only one other beside Patrasche to whom Nello could talk at  all of his daring fantasies. This other was little Alois, who lived at  the old red mill on the grassy mound, and whose father, the miller, was  the best-to-do husbandman in all the village. Little Alois was only a  pretty baby with soft round, rosy features, made lovely by those sweet  dark eyes that the Spanish rule has left in so many a Flemish face,  in testimony of the Alvan dominion, as Spanish art has left broadsown  throughout the country majestic palaces and stately courts, gilded  house-fronts and sculptured lintels--histories in blazonry and poems in  stone.    Little Alois was often with Nello and Patrasche. They played in the  fields, they ran in the snow, they gathered the daisies and bilberries,  they went up to the old gray church together, and they often sat  together by the broad wood-fire in the mill-house. Little Alois, indeed,  was the richest child in the hamlet. She had neither brother nor sister;  her blue serge dress had never a hole in it; at Kermesse she had as many  gilded nuts and Agni Dei in sugar as her hands could hold; and when she  went up for her first communion her flaxen curls were covered with a  cap of richest Mechlin lace, which had been her mother's and her  grandmother's before it came to her. Men spoke already, though she had  but twelve years, of the good wife she would be for their sons to woo  and win; but she herself was a little gay, simple child, in nowise  conscious of her heritage, and she loved no playfellows so well as Jehan  Daas's grandson and his dog.    [Illustration: child] [Illustration: NELLO DREW THEIR LIKENESS WITH A  STICK OF CHARCOAL] [Illustration: couple walking]    One day her father, Baas Cogez, a good man, but somewhat stern, came on  a pretty group in the long meadow behind the mill, where the aftermath  had that day been cut. It was his little daughter sitting amidst the  hay, with the great tawny head of Patrasche on her lap, and many wreaths  of poppies and blue corn-flowers round them both: on a clean smooth slab  of pine wood the boy Nello drew their likeness with a stick of charcoal.    The miller stood and looked at the portrait with tears in his eyes, it  was so strangely like, and he loved his only child closely and well.  Then he roughly chid the little girl for idling there whilst her  mother needed her within, and sent her indoors crying and afraid: then,  turning, he snatched the wood from Nello's hands. \"Dost do much of such  folly?\" he asked, but there was a tremble in his voice.    Nello colored and hung his head. \"I draw everything I see,\" he murmured.    The miller was silent: then he stretched his hand out with a franc in  it. \"It is folly, as I say, and evil waste of time: nevertheless, it is  like Alois, and will please the house-mother. Take this silver bit for  it and leave it for me.\"    The color died out of the face of the young Ardennois; he lifted  his head and put his hands behind his back. \"Keep your money and the  portrait both, Baas Cogez,\" he said, simply. \"You have been often good  to me.\" Then he called Patrasche to him, and walked away across the  field.    \"I could have seen them with that franc,\" he murmured to Patrasche, \"but  I could not sell her picture--not even for them.\"    Baas Cogez went into his mill-house sore troubled in his mind. \"That  lad must not be so much with Alois,\" he said to his wife that night.  \"Trouble may come of it hereafter: he is fifteen now, and she is twelve;  and the boy is comely of face and form.\"    \"And he is a good lad and a loyal,\" said the housewife, feasting her  eyes on the piece of pine wood where it was throned above the chimney  with a cuckoo clock in oak and a Calvary in wax.    \"Yea, I do not gainsay that,\" said the miller, draining his pewter  flagon.    \"Then, if what you think of were ever to come to pass,\" said the wife,  hesitatingly, \"would it matter so much? She will have enough for both,  and one cannot be better than happy.\"    \"You are a woman, and therefore a fool,\" said the miller, harshly,  striking his pipe on the table. \"The lad is naught but a beggar, and,  with these painter's fancies, worse than a beggar. Have a care that they  are not together in the future, or I will send the child to the surer  keeping of the nuns of the Sacred Heart.\"    The poor mother was terrified, and promised humbly to do his will. Not  that she could bring herself altogether to separate the child from  her favorite playmate, nor did the miller even desire that extreme of  cruelty to a young lad who was guilty of nothing except poverty. But  there were many ways in which little Alois was kept away from her chosen  companion; and Nello, being a boy proud and quiet and sensitive,  was quickly wounded, and ceased to turn his own steps and those of  Patrasche, as he had been used to do with every moment of leisure, to  the old red mill upon the slope. What his offence was he did not know:  he supposed he had in some manner angered Baas Cogez by taking the  portrait of Alois in the meadow; and when the child who loved him would  run to him and nestle her hand in his, he would smile at her very sadly  and say with a tender concern for her before himself, \"Nay, Alois, do  not anger your father. He thinks that I make you idle, dear, and he is  not pleased that you should be with me. He is a good man and loves you  well: we will not anger him, Alois.\"    But it was with a sad heart that he said it, and the earth did not look  so bright to him as it had used to do when he went out at sunrise under  the poplars down the straight roads with Patrasche. The old red mill had  been a landmark to him, and he had been used to pause by it, going and  coming, for a cheery greeting with its people as her little flaxen head  rose above the low mill-wicket, and her little rosy hands had held out  a bone or a crust to Patrasche. Now the dog looked wistfully at a closed  door, and the boy went on without pausing, with a pang at his heart, and  the child sat within with tears dropping slowly on the knitting to which  she was set on her little stool by the stove; and Baas Cogez, working  among his sacks and his mill-gear, would harden his will and say to  himself, \"It is best so. The lad is all but a beggar, and full of idle,  dreaming fooleries. Who knows what mischief might not come of it in the  future?\" So he was wise in his generation, and would not have the door  unbarred, except upon rare and formal occasion, which seemed to have  neither warmth nor mirth in them to the two children, who had been  accustomed so long to a daily gleeful, careless, happy interchange of  greeting, speech, and pastime, with no other watcher of their sports or  auditor of their fancies than Patrasche, sagely shaking the brazen bells  of his collar and responding with all a dog's swift sympathies to their  every change of mood.    All this while the little panel of pine wood remained over the chimney  in the mill-kitchen with the cuckoo clock and the waxen Calvary, and  sometimes it seemed to Nello a little hard that whilst his gift was  accepted he himself should be denied.    [Illustration: ]    But he did not complain: it was his habit to be quiet: old Jehan Daas  had said ever to him, \"We are poor: we must take what God sends--the ill  with the good: the poor cannot choose.\"    To which the boy had always listened in silence, being reverent of his  old grandfather; but nevertheless a certain vague, sweet hope, such as  beguiles the children of genius, had whispered in his heart, \"Yet the  poor do choose sometimes--choose to be great, so that men cannot say  them nay.\" And he thought so still in his innocence; and one day, when  the little Alois, finding him by chance alone among the cornfields by  the canal, ran to him and held him close, and sobbed piteously because  the morrow would be her saint's day, and for the first time in all her  life her parents had failed to bid him to the little supper and romp in  the great barns with which her feast-day was always celebrated, Nello  had kissed her and murmured to her in firm faith, \"It shall be different  one day, Alois. One day that little bit of pine wood that your father  has of mine shall be worth its weight in silver; and he will not shut  the door against me then. Only love me always, dear little Alois, only  love me always, and I"]]]
