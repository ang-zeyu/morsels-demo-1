[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5183"],[0,"The Unexpurgated Case Against Woman Suffrage (#4)"],[1,"is conformable to public advantage, we shall again make  expediency the criterion of the justice of woman's suffrage.    Before passing on it will be well to point out that the argument from  Justice meets us not only in the form that Justice requires that woman  should have a vote, but also in all sorts of other forms. We encounter  it in the writings of publicists, in the formula _Taxation_ _carries  with it a Right to Representation_; and we encounter it in the  streets, on the banners of woman suffrage processions, in the form  _Taxation without Representation is Tyranny_.    This latter theorem of taxation which is displayed on the banners of  woman suffrage is, I suppose, deliberately and intentionally a  _suggestio falsi_. For only that taxation is tyrannous which is  diverted to objects which are not useful to the contributors. And even  the suffragist does not suggest that the taxes which are levied on  women are differentially applied to the uses of men.    Putting, then, this form of argument out of sight, let us come to  close quarters with the question whether the payment of taxes gives a  title to control the finances of the State.    Now, if it really did so without any regard to the status of the  claimant, not only women, but also foreigners residing in, or holding  property in, England, and with these lunatics and miners with  property, and let me, for the sake of a pleasanter collocation of  ideas, hastily add peers of the realm, who have now no control over  public finance, ought to receive the parliamentary franchise. And in  like manner if the payment of a tax, without consideration of its  amount, were to give a title to a vote, every one who bought an  article which had paid a duty would be entitled to a vote in his own,  or in a foreign, country according as that duty has been paid at home  or abroad.    In reality the moral and logical nexus between the payment of taxes  and the control of the public revenue is that the solvent and  selfsupporting citizens, and only these, are entitled to direct its  financial policy.    If I have not received, or if I have refunded, any direct  contributions I may have received from the coffers of the State; if I  have paid my _pro rata_ share of its establishment charges--_i.e._ of  the costs of both internal administration and external defence; and I  have further paid my proportional share of whatever may be required to  make up for the deficit incurred on account of my fellow-men and women  who either require direct assistance from the State, or cannot meet  their share of the expenses of the State, I am a _solvent citizen_;  and if I fail to meet these liabilities, I am an _insolvent citizen_  even though I pay such taxes as the State insists upon my paying.    Now if a woman insists, in the face of warnings that she had better  not do so, on taxing man with dishonesty for withholding from her  financial control over the revenues of the State, she has only herself  to blame if she is told very bluntly that her claim to such control is  barred by the fact that she is, as a citizen insolvent. The taxes paid  by women would cover only a very small proportion of the  establishment charges of the State which would properly be assigned to  them. It falls to man to make up that deficit.    And it is to be noted with respect to those women who pay their full  pro rata contribution and who ask to be treated as a class apart from,  and superior to, other women, that only a very small proportion of  these have made their position for themselves.    Immeasurably the larger number are in a solvent position only because  men have placed them there. All large fortunes and practically all the  incomes which are furnished by investments are derived from man.    Nay; but the very revenues which the Woman Suffrage Societies devote  to man's vilification are to a preponderating extent derived from  funds which he earned and gave over to woman.    In connexion with the financial position of woman as here stated, it  will be well to consider first the rich woman's claim to the vote.    We may seek light on the logical and moral aspects of this claim by  considering here two parallel cases.    The position which is occupied by the peer under the English  Constitution furnishes a very interesting parallel to the position of  the woman who is here in question.    Time out of mind the Commons have viewed with the utmost jealousy any  effort of the House of Lords to obtain co-partnership with them in the  control of the finances of the State; and, in pursuance of that  traditional policy, the peers have recently, after appeal to the  country, been shorn of the last vestige of financial control. Now we  may perhaps see, in this jealousy of a House of Lords, which  represents inherited wealth, displayed by a House of Commons  representing voters electing on a financial qualification, an  unconscious groping after the moral principle that those citizens who  are solvent by their own efforts, and only these, should control the  finances of the State.    And if this analogy finds acceptance, it would not--even if there were  nothing else than this against such proposals--be logically possible,  after ousting the peers who are large tax-payers from all control over  the finances of the State, to create a new class of voters out of the  female representatives of unearned wealth.    The second parallel case which we have to consider presents a much  simpler analogy. Consideration will show that the position occupied in  the State by the woman who has inherited money is analogous to that  occupied in a firm by a sleeping partner who stands in the shoes of a  deceased working partner, and who has only a small amount of capital  in the business. Now, if such a partner were to claim any financial  control, and were to make trouble about paying his _pro rata_  establishment charges, he would be very sharply called to order. And  he would never dream of appealing to Justice by breaking windows,  going to gaol, and undertaking a hunger strike.    Coming back from the particular to the general, and from the logical  to the moral aspect of woman's claim to control the finances of the  State on the ground that she is a tax-payer, it will suffice to point  out that this claim is on a par with the claim to increased political  power and completer control over the finances of the State which is  put forward by a class of male voters who are already paying much less  than their _pro rata_ share of the upkeep of the State.    In each case it is a question of trying to get control of other  people's money. And in the case of woman it is of \"trying on\" in  connexion with her public partnership with man that principle of  domestic partnership, \"All yours is mine, and all mine's my own.\"    Next to the plea of justice, the plea which is advanced most  insistently by the woman who is contending for a vote is the plea of  liberty.    We have here, again, a word which is a valuable asset to woman  suffrage both in the respect that it brings moral pressure to bear,  and in the respect that it is a word of ambiguous meaning.    In accordance with this we have John Stuart Mill making propaganda for  woman suffrage in a tractate entitled the_ Subjection of_ _Women_; we  have a Woman's _Freedom_ League--\"freedom\" being a question-begging  synonym for \"parliamentary franchise\"--and everywhere in the  literature of woman's suffrage we have talk of woman's \"emancipation\";  and we have women characterised as serfs, or slaves--the terms _serfs_  and _slaves_ supplying, of course, effective rhetorical synonyms for  non-voters.    When we have succeeded in getting through these thick husks of untruth  we find that the idea of liberty which floats before the eyes of woman  is, not at all a question of freedom from unequitable legal  restraints, but essentially a question of getting more of the personal  liberty (or command of other people's services), which the possession  of money confers and more freedom from sexual restraints.    The suffragist agitator makes profit out of this ambiguity.  In  addressing the woman worker who does not, at the rate which her labour  commands on the market, earn enough to give her any reasonable measure  of financial freedom, the agitator will assure her that the suffrage  would bring her more money, describing the woman suffrage cause to her  as the cause of liberty. By juggling in this way with the two meanings  of \"liberty\" she will draw her into her toils.    The vote, however, would not raise wages of the woman worker and bring  to her the financial, nor yet the physiological freedom she is  seeking.    The tactics of the suffragist agitator are the same when she is  dealing with a woman who is living at the charges of a husband or  relative, and who recoils against the idea that she lies under a moral  obligation to make to the man who works for her support some return of  gratitude. The suffragist agitator will point out to her that such an  obligation is slavery, and that the woman's suffrage cause is the  cause of freedom.    And so we find the women who want to have everything for nothing, and  the wives who do not see that they are beholden to man for anything,  and those who consider that they have not made a sufficiently good  bargain for themselves--in short, all the ungrateful women--flock to  the banner of Women's Freedom--the banner of financial freedom for  woman at the expense of financial servitude for man.    The grateful woman will practically always be an anti-suffragist.    It will be well, before passing on to another class of arguments, to  summarise what has been said in the three foregoing sections.    We have recognised that woman has not been defrauded of elementary  natural rights; that Justice, as distinguished from egalitarian  equity, does not prescribe that she should be admitted to the  suffrage; and that her status is not, as is dishonestly "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51854"],[0,"The Rat Race (#4)"],[1," what you like about it.  It's yours. You see, Jimmie,\" I added, \"that's the way things are. I'm  burning all my bridges.\"    \"Oh!\" she said. Then after a long pause, she added, \"Ah!\"    \"I don't think,\" she remarked, after another pause, \"that I'll want to  keep this and I'm far too fond of Virginia Rutherford to humiliate her.  I think I'll just take this back to Tiffany's and get something else.\"    So I had led trumps.    \"Here's something else to be going on with,\" I told her. \"I got this  for you, anyhow, win, lose or draw\"--and I produced the gold bracelet.  \"I thought it would go with that dress and your cameo and--if you still  want to wear it--your wedding ring.\"    She cast quick glances from side to side, like a bird that suspects a  snare.    \"It's good,\" she sighed. \"Winnie, it's so good. I guess....\"    There was a knock at the door. It was Myrtle-Mary.    \"Will the master be staying for dinner, Mrs. Tompkins?\" she asked.    \"Of course I will, Mary,\" I said. \"Is there enough to eat?\"    \"I'll see, sir,\" she replied in a manner which was practically an  insult to us both.    \"And keep a civil tongue in your head,\" I added.    She handed it back to me. \"And keep your hands to yourself, sir,\" she  said as she closed the door.    \"Winnie.\" It was Jimmie's hand restraining me, as I started up.    \"Let her go!\" I said at last. \"It's my fault, I guess. I haven't been  happy and I did make a few passes. From now on, I'll try to be a bit  more decent and livable. God knows I have plenty to be ashamed of, but  nothing disgraceful ... I hope.\"    \"So do I,\" my wife began. \"If you....\"    The telephone rang.    She picked up the receiver and listened for a moment, frowning.    \"Yes, he's here,\" she said, passing me the instrument.    \"It's for you,\" she observed. \"It's Virginia calling from New York and  she sounds _most_ annoyed.\"          CHAPTER 3      \"Winnie!\" The voice that crackled at me over the wire had all the  implacable tenderness of a woman who has you in the wrong.    \"Yes, dear!\" I answered automatically, with a passing thought for my  own lost Dorothy, marooned in Washington with a job in the O.S.S.    \"What _is_ the matter?\" the voice continued, in its litany of angry  possessiveness. \"What on _earth_ happened to you? I've been waiting for  you since three o'clock.\"    \"Where have you been waiting?\"    \"_Here_--of course. In our place. In New York. _Winnie, what's wrong?_\"    Not a pleasant spot to be in, even if it was only part of a trial-run  in purgatory.    \"It's a bit too hard to explain, Virginia,\" I said, \"but something came  up and I don't think I can go through with it. In fact, I know I can't  go through with it.\"    There was one of those pauses which make a whole life-time seem like a  split-second.    \"Something came up!\" The voice, now a pantherish contralto, purred  dangerously. \"Something went down, you mean. You see, Winnie, I've been  talking to your friends. Johnny Walker, Black Label, that's what went  down. At the Pond Club. Tommy Morgan told me all about it. You went to  the Pond, had too much to drink, woke up about four o'clock--one whole  hour after you had promised to meet me--and woke up talking wildly  and then staggered out. Now I find you're back in Bedford Hills, and  it--it's my birthday--\" The voice ended in a choke which might have been  a sob or a paroxysm of feminine fury.    I summoned the old voice of authority, as inculcated at Quonset,  into the well-tanned vocal chords of Winfred Tompkins. \"Virginia,\" I  commanded, \"just stop making a fool of yourself. I'm sorry I stood you  up but things have been happening. I just can't go through with it.  I'll explain when I see you.\"    \"You'd better!\" And the slam of the receiver left my ears ringing.    When I turned around, my wife was smiling, with a glint in her eye  which was far from sympathetic.    \"Poor Winnie!\" she observed. \"You'd better stick to your office  stenographers and not go picking up red-headed married women in  Westchester. You haven't got a chance.\"    I refilled my glass and hers, in that order--a husbandly gesture which  put me, I felt, on a solid married basis for the moment.    \"Jimmie,\" I announced. \"I don't need to tell you that I'm an awful  heel. Now that we've got the wraps off I wish you'd tell me what you  really think of me and Virginia.\"    Mrs. Tompkins' nostrils flickered slightly. \"I never cared for bulging  red-heads myself,\" she said. \"When she was at Miss Spence's we called  her Virgin for short, but not for long. There never was a thing in  pants, up to and including scarecrows, that she wouldn't carry the  torch for. When she married Jerry Rutherford it was a great relief to  her relatives. She had no friends.\"    \"A very succinct summary, for all that it should be written in letters  of fire,\" I remarked. \"And now what do you think of me?\"    She took a long sip of her drink and leaned forward. \"You're fat, soft  and spoiled, Winnie, physically, mentally and morally,\" she began, \"and  you know it. If you weren't so stinking rich you'd--well, I don't know.  There's something about you that's--Well, after you bought me from my  parents, I wanted to kill myself and then I sized you up. There's no  real harm in you, Winnie, it's not hard to like you, but you never were  love's young dream.\"    \"What you say is absolutely on the beam,\" I admitted. \"But while  we're on the subject I wouldn't call Jerry Rutherford the answer to a  maiden's prayer. That Hollywood doctor type with the swank suburban  practice and the soft bedroom manner gets me down. He has only three  ideas in the world and all of them begin with 'I'. After the first  antiseptic raptures you'd have nothing in common but your appendix and  he'd want to get away with that--for a consideration.\"    Jimmie giggled. \"You forget that he already has it,\" she said. \"That's  how I was first attracted to him, under the ether cone. I was sick as a  dog and he held my hand and told me I was being very brave.\"    \"And sent the hell of a bill to me,\" I added.    \"Well,\" she asked, after a pause. \"What do you really think of me?\"    \"I think, Jimmie, that you're lonely, bored and unhappy. All three are  my fault but they are driving you to make a fool of yourself. Nobody  has tried to understand you\"--which is catnip for any person of either  sex, once you get them talking about themselves--\"least of all your  husband. You need what other women need--children, a home....\"    \"If this is a build-up for obstetrics, the answer is 'No!'\" she snapped  angrily.    \"Skip it!\" I urged. \"I'm telling you the truth, not making a pass at  you. We can talk some more about you in the morning. In the meantime, I  think I'll turn in. I'm very tired, a little tight and I've had a lousy  day.\"    She flashed me a curious look. \"Go on up, Winnie,\" she said. \"I'll put  these things away. You'll need your strength for the morning, if I know  Virginia Rutherford.\"    Guided by luck and the smell of pipe tobacco, I found what was  obviously the Master's Room--with a weird amalgam of etchings of ducks  and nude girls, including one Zorn, and all the gadgets for making  sleep as complicated as driving an automobile.    I was awakened in the morning by a hand on my shoulder. It was  Mary-Myrtle.    \"You'd better get up and put on your pyjamas and dressing gown,\" she  remarked conversationally. \"Dr. Rutherford is downstairs and Mrs.  Rutherford is talking with Mrs. Tompkins in her bedroom.\"    \"Stormy weather?\"    \"I'll say so--and see here--\" she began.    \"Sit down, Mary!\" I ordered.    She subsided on the edge of the bed and looked at me rebelliously.    \"From now on, Mary,\" I announced, \"things are going to be different  around here. I won't refer to what is past, because you're old enough  to know what you're doing and so am I. If you want to stay on and  really help me through a hard time, I'll double your wages. If you'd  rather go--and I wouldn't blame you--I'll pay you six months wages in  advance and you can clear out. But I can't be worried about you and  your feelings when I have a big problem to clean up here. Will you go  or stay?\"    The girl thought for a moment, then rose, straightened her apron and  gave me the first friendly smile I had received, since my arrival from  the Aleutians.    \"I'll stay, Mr. Tompkins,\" she said. \"And here's a pick-me-up I mixed  for you. Better drink it before you see the Rutherfords.\"    \"Okay!\" And I drank it and it worked its beneficent will upon me. \"Now  I'll go and kill Dr. Rutherford, if you'll toss me my flit-gun and,  thanks!\"    Dr. Rutherford was pacing, with surgical precision, up and down my den.  He looked slightly more self-possessed than the day before and seemed  to be in excellent physical condition. I guessed at the contour beneath  my wadded black silk dressing gown and re-considered my original  plan to throw him bodily out of the house for having come without my  invitation.    \"See here, Tompkins,\" he said briskly. \"We're both men of the world, I  hope. Things can't go on like this. I was up all night with Virginia.  You're not behaving at all well, you know, old man.\"    I sat down in the corner of the leather lounge and looked up at him--a  move which gave me a slight advantage of position in dealing with the  higher emotions.    \"Let's not mince words, Jerry,\" I said. \"Suppose you just state frankly  what you think we should do.\"    \"Germaine loves me and does not love you,\" Rutherford stated crisply.  \"You love Virginia and she loves you. None of us wish a divorce. Hang  it all, Winnie, we're civilized. These things happen, you know, and we  might just as well face them. We agreed that the four of us should do  as we liked, and no hard feelings.\"    I sighed. \"Jerry,\" I said. \"What you say was true as of yesterday noon  but if these things can happen, they can also un-happen. Whatever you  and my wife decide to do is your own affair but I'm damned if I intend  to allow her"]]]
