In the two zodiacs vulgarly called the  Tartar and Chaldean, or Egyptian (in the zodiac which contains the  sign of the Rat, an in that which contains those of the Fishes and  Aquarius), particular constellations are consecrated to the periodical  overflowings of the rivers. Real cycles, divisions of time, have been  gradually transformed into divisions of space; but the generality of  the physical phenomena of the risings seems to prove that the zodiac  which has been transmitted to us by the Greeks, and which, by the  precession of the equinoxes, becomes an historical monument of high  antiquity, may have taken birth far from Thebes, and from the sacred  valley of the Nile. In the zodiacs of the New World--in the Mexican,  for instance, of which we discover the vestiges in the signs of the  days, and the periodical series which they compose--there are also  signs of rain and of inundation corresponding to the Chou (Rat) of the  Chinese* and Thibetan cycle of Tse, and to the Fishes and Aquarius of  the dodecatemorion. (* The figure of water itself is often substituted  for that of the Rat (Arvicola) in the Tartar zodiac. The Rat takes the  place of Aquarius. Gaubil, Obs. Mathem. volume 3 page 33.) These two  Mexican signs are Water (Atl) and Cipactli, the sea-monster furnished  with a horn. This animal is at once the Antelope-fish of the Hindoos,  the Capricorn of our zodiac, the Deucalion of the Greeks, and the Noah  (Coxcox) of the Azteks.* (* Coxcox bears also the denomination of  Teo-Cipactli, in which the root god or divine is added to the name of  the sign Cipactli. It is the man of the Fourth Age; who, at the fourth  destruction of the world (the last renovation of nature), saved  himself with his wife, and reached the mountain of Colhuacan.  According to the commentator Germanicus, Deucalion was placed in  Aquarius; but the three signs of the Fishes, Aquarius and Capricorn  (the Antelope-fish) were heretofore intimately linked together. The  animal, which, after having long inhabited the waters, takes the form  of an antelope, and climbs the mountains, reminds people, whose  restless imagination seizes the most remote similitudes, of the  ancient traditions of Menou, of Noah, and of those Deucalions  celebrated among the Scythians and the Thessalians. As the Tartarian  and Mexican zodiacs contain the signs of the Monkey and the Tiger,  they, no doubt, originated in the torrid zone. With the Muyscas,  inhabitants of New Grenada, the first sign, as in eastern Asia, was  that of water, figured by a Frog. It is also remarkable that the  astrological worship of the Muyscas came to the table-land of Bogota  from the eastern side, from the plains of San Juan, which extend  toward the Guaviare and the Orinoco.) Thus we find the general results  of comparative hydrography in the astrological monuments, the  divisions of time and the religious traditions of nations the most  remote from each other in their situation and in their degree of  intellectual advancement.    As the equatorial rains take place in the flat country when the sun  passes through the zenith of the place, that is, when its declination  becomes homonymous with the zone comprised between the equator and one  of the tropics, the waters of the Amazon sink, while those of the  Orinoco rise perceptibly. In a very judicious discussion on the origin  of the Rio Congo,* (* Voyage to the Zaire page 17.) the attention of  philosophers has been already called to the modifications which the  periods of the risings must undergo in the course of a river, the  sources and the mouth of which are not on the same side of the  equinoctial line.* (* Among the rivers of America this is the case  with the Rio Negro, the Rio Branco, and the Jupura.) The hydraulic  systems of the Orinoco and the Amazon furnish a combination of  circumstances still more extraordinary. They are united by the Rio  Negro and the Cassiquiare, a branch of the Orinoco; it is a navigable  line, between two great basins of rivers, that is crossed by the  equator. The river Amazon, according to the information which I  obtained on its banks, is much less regular in the periods of its  oscillations than the Orinoco; it generally begins, however, to  increase in December, and attains its maximum of height in March.* (*  Nearly seventy or eighty days after our winter solstice, which is the  summer solstice of the southern hemisphere.) It sinks from the month  of May, and is at its minimum of height in the months of July and  August, at the time when the Lower Orinoco inundates all the  surrounding land. As no river of America can cross the equator from  south to north, on account of the general configuration of the ground,  the risings of the Orinoco have an influence on the Amazon; but those  of the Amazon do not alter the progress of the oscillations of the  Orinoco. It results from these data, that in the two basins of the  Amazon and the Orinoco, the concave and convex summits of the curve of  progressive increase and decrease correspond very regularly with each  other, since they exhibit the difference of six months, which results  from the situation of the rivers in opposite hemispheres. The  commencement of the risings only is less tardy in the Orinoco. This  river increases sensibly as soon as the sun has crossed the equator;  in the Amazon, on the contrary, the risings do not commence till two  months after the equinox. It is known that in the forests north of the  line the rains are earlier than in the less woody plains of the  southern torrid zone. To this local cause is joined another, which  acts perhaps equally on the tardy swellings of the Nile. The Amazon  receives a great part of its waters from the Cordillera of the Andes,  where the seasons, as everywhere among mountains, follow a peculiar  type, most frequently opposite to that of the low regions.    The law of the increase and decrease of the Orinoco is more difficult  to determine with respect to space, or to the magnitude of the  oscillations, than with regard to time, or the period of the maxima  and minima. Having been able to measure but imperfectly the risings of  the river, I report, not without hesitation, estimates that differ  much from each other.* (* Tuckey, Maritime Geogr. volume 4 page 309.  Hippisley, Expedition to the Orinoco page 38. Gumilla volume 1 pages  56 to 59. Depons volume 3 page 301. The greatest height of the rise of  the Mississippi is, at Natchez, fifty-five English feet. This river  (the largest perhaps of the whole temperate zone) is at its maximum  from February to May; at its minimum in August and September.  Ellicott, Journal of an Expedition to the Ohio.) Foreign pilots admit  ninety feet for the ordinary rise in the Lower Orinoco. M. Depons, who  has in general collected very accurate notions during his stay at  Caracas, fixes it at thirteen fathoms. The heights naturally vary  according to the breadth of the bed and the number of tributary  streams which the principal trunk receives.    The people believe that every five years the Orinoco rises three feet  higher than common; but the idea of this cycle does not rest on any  precise measures. We know by the testimony of antiquity, that the  oscillations of the Nile have been sensibly the same with respect to  their height and duration for thousands of years; which is a proof,  well worthy of attention, that the mean state of the humidity and the  temperature does not vary in that vast basin. Will this constancy in  physical phenomena, this equilibrium of the elements, be preserved in  the New World also after some ages of cultivation? I think we may  reply in the affirmative; for the united efforts of man cannot fail to  have an influence on the general causes on which the climate of Guiana  depends.    According to the barometric height of San Fernando de Apure, I find  from that town to the Boca de Navios the slope of the Apure and the  Lower Orinoco to be three inches and a quarter to a nautical mile of  nine hundred and fifty toises.* (* The Apure itself has a slope of  thirteen inches to the mile.) We may be surprised at the strength of  the current in a slope so little perceptible; but I shall remind the  reader on this occasion, that, according to measurements made by order  of Mr. Hastings, the Ganges was found, in a course of sixty miles  (comprising the windings,) to have also only four inches fall to a  mile; that the mean swiftness of this river is, in the seasons of  drought, three miles an hour, and in those of rains six or eight  miles. The strength of the current, therefore, in the Ganges as in the  Orinoco, depends less on the slope of the bed, than on the  accumulation of the higher waters, caused by the abundance of the  rains, and the number of tributary streams. European colonists have  already been settled for two hundred and fifty years on the banks of  the Orinoco; and during this long period of time, according to a  tradition which has been propagated from generation to generation, the  periodical oscillations of the river (the time of the beginning of the  rising, and that when it attains its maximum) have never been retarded  more than twelve or fifteen days.    When vessels that draw a good deal of water sail up toward Angostura  in the months of January and February, by favour of the sea-breeze and  the tide, they run the risk of taking the ground. The navigable  channel often changes its breadth and direction; no buoy, however, has  yet been laid down, to indicate any deposit of earth formed in the bed  of the river, where the waters have lost their original velocity.  There exists on the south of Cape Barima, as well by the river of this  name as by the Rio Moroca and several estuaries (esteres) a  communication with the English colony of Essequibo. Small vessels can  penetrate into the interior as far as the Rio Poumaron, on which are  the ancient settlements of Zealand and Middleburg."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7297"],[0,"The Vedanta-Sutras with the Commentary (#4)"],[1," ascertain these matters; 'hearing' thus is established already. In the  same way the clause 'the Self is to be reflected upon' is a mere anuvâda  of reflection which is known as a means of confirming what one has  'heard.' It is therefore meditation only which all those texts enjoin.  In agreement with this a later Sûtra also says, 'Repetition more than  once, on account of instruction' (Ve. Sû. IV, I, I). That the knowledge  intended to be enjoined as the means of final release is of the nature  of meditation, we conclude from the circumstance that the terms  'knowing' and'meditating' are seen to be used in place of each other in  the earlier and later parts of Vedic texts. Compare the following  passages: 'Let a man meditate on mind as Brahman,' and 'he who knows  this shines and warms through his celebrity, fame, and glory of  countenance' (Ch. Up. III, 18, 1; 6). And 'He does not know him, for he  is not complete,' and 'Let men meditate on him as the Self (Bri. Up. I,  4, 7). And 'He who knows what he knows,' and 'Teach me the deity on  which you meditate' (Ch. Up. IV, 1, 6; 2, 2).    'Meditation' means steady remembrance, i.e. a continuity of steady  remembrance, uninterrupted like the flow of oil; in agreement with the  scriptural passage which declares steady remembrance to be the means of  release, 'on the attainment of remembrance all the ties are loosened'  (Ch. Up. VII, 26, 2). Such remembrance is of the same character (form)  as seeing (intuition); for the passage quoted has the same purport as  the following one, 'The fetter of the heart is broken, all doubts are  solved, and all the works of that man perish when he has been seen who  is high and low' (Mu. Up. II, 2, 8). And this being so, we conclude that  the passage 'the Self is to be seen' teaches that 'Meditation' has the  character of 'seeing' or 'intuition.' And that remembrance has the  character of 'seeing' is due to the element of imagination  (representation) which prevails in it. All this has been set forth at  length by the Vâkyakâra. 'Knowledge (vedana) means meditation (upâsana),  scripture using the word in that sense'; i.e. in all Upanishads that  knowledge which is enjoined as the means of final release is Meditation.  The Vâkyakâra then propounds a pûrvapaksha (primâ facie view), 'Once he  is to make the meditation, the matter enjoined by scripture being  accomplished thereby, as in the case of the prayâjas and the like'; and  then sums up against this in the words 'but (meditation) is established  on account of the term meditation'; that means--knowledge repeated more  than once (i.e. meditation) is determined to be the means of Release.--  The Vâkyakâra then goes on 'Meditation is steady remembrance, on the  ground of observation and statement.' That means--this knowledge, of the  form of meditation, and repeated more than once, is of the nature of  steady remembrance.    Such remembrance has been declared to be of the character of 'seeing,'  and this character of seeing consists in its possessing the character of  immediate presentation (pratyakshatâ). With reference to remembrance,  which thus acquires the character of immediate presentation and is the  means of final release, scripture makes a further determination, viz. in  the passage Ka. Up. I, 2, 23, 'That Self cannot be gained by the study  of the Veda (\"reflection\"), nor by thought (\"meditation\"), nor by much  hearing. Whom the Self chooses, by him it may be gained; to him the Self  reveals its being.' This text says at first that mere hearing,  reflection, and meditation do not suffice to gain the Self, and then  declares, 'Whom the Self chooses, by him it may be gained.' Now a  'chosen' one means a most beloved person; the relation being that he by  whom that Self is held most dear is most dear to the Self. That the Lord  (bhagavân) himself endeavours that this most beloved person should gain  the Self, he himself declares in the following words, 'To those who are  constantly devoted and worship with love I give that knowledge by which  they reach me' (Bha. Gî. X, 10), and 'To him who has knowledge I am dear  above all things, and he is dear to me' (VII, 17). Hence, he who  possesses remembrance, marked by the character of immediate presentation  (sâkshâtkâra), and which itself is dear above all things since the  object remembered is such; he, we say, is chosen by the highest Self,  and by him the highest Self is gained. Steady remembrance of this kind  is designated by the word 'devotion' (bhakti); for this term has the  same meaning as upâsanâ (meditation). For this reason scripture and  smriti agree in making the following declarations, 'A man knowing him  passes over death' (Svet. Up. III, 8); 'Knowing him thus he here becomes  immortal' (Taitt. Âr. III, 12,7); 'Neither by the Vedas, nor by  austerities, nor by gifts, nor by sacrifice can I be so seen as thou  hast seen me. But by devotion exclusive I may in this form be known and  seen in truth, O Arjuna, and also be entered into' (Bha. Gî. XI, 53, 54);  'That highest Person, O Pârtha, may be obtained by exclusive devotion'  (VIII, 22).    That of such steady remembrance sacrifices and so on are means will be  declared later on (Ve. Sû. III, 4, 26). Although sacrifices and the like  are enjoined with a view to the origination of knowledge (in accordance  with the passage 'They desire to know,' Bri. Up. IV, 4, 22), it is only  knowledge in the form of meditation which--being daily practised,  constantly improved by repetition, and continued up to death--is the  means of reaching Brahman, and hence all the works connected with the  different conditions of life are to be performed throughout life only  for the purpose of originating such knowledge. This the Sûtrakâra  declares in Ve. Sû. IV, 1, 12; 16; III, 4, 33, and other places. The  Vâkyakâra also declares that steady remembrance results only from  abstention, and so on; his words being 'This (viz. steady remembrance =  meditation) is obtained through abstention (viveka), freeness of mind  (vimoka), repetition (abhyâsa), works (kriyâ), virtuous conduct  (kalyâna), freedom from dejection (anavasâda), absence of exultation  (anuddharsha); according to feasibility and scriptural statement.' The  Vâkyakâra also gives definitions of all these terms. Abstention (viveka)  means keeping the body clean from all food, impure either owing to  species (such as the flesh of certain animals), or abode (such as food  belonging to a Kândâla or the like), or accidental cause (such as food  into which a hair or the like has fallen). The scriptural passage  authorising this point is Ch. Up. VII, 26, 'The food being pure, the  mind becomes pure; the mind being pure, there results steady remembrance.'  Freeness of mind (vimoka) means absence of attachment to desires. The  authoritative passage here is 'Let him meditate with a calm mind' (Ch.  Up. III, 14, 1). Repetition means continued practice. For this point the  Bhâshya-kâra quotes an authoritative text from Smriti, viz.: 'Having  constantly been absorbed in the thought of that being' (sadâ  tadbhâvabhâvitah; Bha. Gî. VIII, 6).--By 'works' (kriyâ) is understood  the performance, according to one's ability, of the five great  sacrifices. The authoritative passages here are 'This person who  performs works is the best of those who know Brahman' (Mu. Up. III, 1,  4); and 'Him Brâhmanas seek to know by recitation of the Veda, by  sacrifice, by gifts, by penance, by fasting' (Bri. Up. IV, 4, 22).--By  virtuous conduct (kalyânâni) are meant truthfulness, honesty, kindness,  liberality, gentleness, absence of covetousness. Confirmatory texts are  'By truth he is to be obtained' (Mu. Up. III, 1, 5) and 'to them belongs  that pure Brahman-world' (Pr. Up. I, 16).--That lowness of spirit or  want of cheerfulness which results from unfavourable conditions of place  or time and the remembrance of causes of sorrow, is denoted by the term  'dejection'; the contrary of this is 'freedom from dejection.' The  relevant scriptural passage is 'This Self cannot be obtained by one  lacking in strength' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 4).--'Exultation' is that  satisfaction of mind which springs from circumstances opposite to those  just mentioned; the contrary is 'absence of exultation.' Overgreat  satisfaction also stands in the way (of meditation). The scriptural  passage for this is 'Calm, subdued,' &c. (Bri. Up. IV, 4, 23).--What the  Vâkyakâra means to say is therefore that knowledge is realised only  through the performance of the duly prescribed works, on the part of a  person fulfilling all the enumerated conditions.    Analogously another scriptural passage says 'He who knows both knowledge  and non-knowledge together, overcoming death by non-knowledge reaches  the Immortal through knowledge' (Îs. Up. II). Here the term  'non-knowledge' denotes the works enjoined on the different castes and  âsramas; and the meaning of the text is that, having discarded by such  works death, i.e. the previous works antagonistic to the origination of  knowledge, a man reaches the Immortal, i.e. Brahman, through knowledge.  The non-knowledge of which this passage speaks as being the means of  overcoming death can only mean that which is other than knowledge, viz.  prescribed works. The word has the same sense in the following passage:  'Firm in traditional knowledge he offered many sacrifices, leaning on  the knowledge of Brahman, so as to pass beyond death by non-knowledge'  (Vi. Pu. VI, 6, 12).--Antagonistic to knowledge (as said above) are all  good and evil actions, and hence--as equally giving rise to an  undesirable result--they may both be designated as evil. They stand in  the way of the origination of knowledge in so far as they strengthen the  elements of passion and darkness which are antagonistic to the element  of goodness which is the cause of the rise of knowledge. That evil works  stand in the way of such origination, the following scriptural text"]]]
