I  dressed him, and made diverse scarifications to let out the  bruised blood made by the wind of the ball; and by the rebounds  that it made on the ground it killed four soldiers, who remained  dead where they fell.    I was not far from this shot, so that I could just feel the moved  air, without its doing me any harm save a fright, which made me  duck my head low enough; but the ball was already far away. The  soldiers laughed at me, to be afraid of a ball which had already  passed. Mon petit maistre, I think if you had been there, I  should not have been afraid all alone, and you would have had  your share of it.    Monseigneur the Due de Guise, Francois de Lorraine, was wounded  before Boulogne with a thrust of a lance, which entered above the  right eye, toward the nose, and passed out on the other side  between the ear and the back of the neck, with so great violence  that the head of the lance, with a piece of the wood, was broken  and remained fast; so that it could not be drawn but save with  extreme force, with smith's pincers. Yet notwithstanding the  great violence of the blow, which was not without fracture of  bones, nerves, veins, and arteries, and other parts torn and  broken, my lord, by the grace of God, was healed. He was used to  go into battle always with his vizard raised: that is why the  lance passed right out on the other side.          THE JOURNEY TO GERMANY. 1552      I went to Germany, in the year 1552, with M. de Rohan, captain of  fifty men-at-arms, where I was surgeon of his company, as I have  said before. On this expedition, M. the Constable was general of  the army; M. de Chastillon, afterward the Admiral, was chief  colonel of the infantry, with four regiments of lansquenets under  Captains Recrod and Ringrave, two under each; and every regiment  was of ten ensigns, and every ensign of five hundred men. And  beside these were Captain Chartel, who led the troops that the  Protestant princes had sent to the King (this infantry was very  fine, and was accompanied by fifteen hundred men-at-arms, with a  following of two archers apiece, which would make four thousand  five hundred horse); and two thousand light horse, and as many  mounted arquebusiers, of whom M. d'Aumalle was general; and a  great number of the nobility, who were come there for their  pleasure. Moreover, the King was accompanied by two hundred  gentlemen of his household, under the command of the Seigneurs de  Boisy and de Canappe, and by many other princes. For his  following, to escort him, there were the French and Scotch and  Swiss guards, amounting to six hundred foot soldiers; and the  companies of MM. the Dauphin, de 'Guise, d'Aumalle, and Marshal  Saint Andre, amounting to four hundred lances; which was a  marvellous thing, to see such a multitude; and with this equipage  the King entered into Toul and Metz.    I must not omit to say that the companies of MM. de Rohan, the  Comte de Sancerre, and de Jarnac, which were each of them of  fifty horse, went upon the wings of the camp. And God knows how  scarce we were of victuals, and I protest before Him that at  three diverse times I thought to die of hunger; and it was not  for want of money, for I had enough of it; but we could not get  victuals save by force, because the country people collected them  all into the towns and castles.    One of the servants of the captain-ensign of the company of M. de  Rohan went with others to enter a church where the peasants were  retreated, thinking to get victuals by love or by forces; but he  got the worst of it, as they all did, and came back with seven  sword wounds on the head, the least of which penetrated to the  inner table of the skull; and he had four other wounds upon the  arms, and one on the right shoulder, which cut more than half of  the bladebone. He was brought back to his master's lodging, who  seeing him so mutilated, and not hoping he could be cured, made  him a grave, and would have cast him therein, saying that else  the peasants would massacre and kill him: I in pity told him the  man might still be cured if he were well dressed. Diverse  gentlemen of the company prayed he would take him along with the  baggage, since I was willing to dress him; to which he agreed,  and after I had got the man ready, he was put in a cart, on a bed  well covered and well arranged, drawn by a horse. I did him the  office of physician, apothecary, surgeon, and cook. I dressed him  to the end of his case, and God healed him; insomuch that all the  three companies marvelled at this cure; The men-at-arms of the  company of M. de Rohan, the first muster that was made, gave me  each a crown, and the archers half a crown,          THE JOURNEY TO DANVILLIERS. 1552      On his return from the expedition against the German camp, King  Henry besieged Danvilliers, and those within would not surrender.  They got the worst of it, but our powder failed us; so they had a  good shot at our men. There was a culverin-shot passed through  the tent of H. de Rohan, which hit a gentleman leg who was of his  household. I had to finish the cutting off of it, which I did  without applying the hot irons.    The King sent for powder to Sedan, and when it came we began the  attack mere vigorously than before, so that a breach was made.  MM. de Guise and the Constable, being in the King's chamber, told  him, and they agreed that next day they would assault the town,  and were confident they would enter into it; and it must be kept  secret, for fear the enemy should come to hear of it; and each  promised not to speak of it to any man. Now there was a groom of  the King's chamber, who being laid under the King's camp-bed to  sleep, heard they were resolved to attack the town next day. So  he told the secret to a certain captain, saying that they would  make the attack next day for certain, and he had heard it from  the King, and prayed the said captain to speak of it to no man,  which he promised; but his promise did not hold, and forthwith he  disclosed it to a captain, and this captain to a captain, and the  captains to some of the soldiers, saying always, \"Say nothing.\"  And it was just so much hid, that next day early in the morning  there was seen the greater part of the soldiers with their boots  and breeches cut loose at the knee for the better mounting of the  breach. The King was told of this rumour that ran through the  camp, that the attack was to be made; whereat he was astonished,  seeing there were but three in that advice, who had promised each  other to tell it to no man. The King sent for M. de Guise, to  know if he had spoken of this attack; he swore and affirmed to  him he had not told it to anybody; and M. the Constable said the  same, and told the King they must know for certain who had  declared this secret counsel, seeing they were but three. Inquiry  was made from captain to captain. In the end they found the  truth; for one said, \"It was such an one told me,\" and another  said the same, till it came to the first of all, who declared he  had heard it from the groom of the King's chamber, called Guyard,  a native of Blois, son of a barber of the late King Francis. The  King sent for him into his tent, in the presence of MM. de Guise  and the Constable, to hear from him whence he had his knowledge,  and who had told him the attack was to be made; and said if he  did not speak the truth he would have him hanged. Then he  declared he lay down under the King's bed thinking to sleep, and  so having heard the plan he revealed it to a captain who was a  friend of his, to the end he might prepare himself with his  soldiers to be the first at the attack. Then the King knew the  truth, and told him he should never serve him again, and that he  deserved to be hanged, and forbade him ever to come again to the  Court.    The groom of the chamber went away with this to swallow, and  slept that night with a surgeon-in-ordinary of the King, Master  Louis of Saint Andre; and in the night he gave himself six stabs  with a knife, and cut his throat Nor did the surgeon perceive it  till the morning, when he found his bed all bloody, and the dead  body by him. He marvelled at this sight on his awaking, and  feared they would say he was the cause of the murder; but he was  soon relieved, seeing the reason, which was despair at the loss  of the good friendship of the King.    So Guyard was buried. And those of Danvilliers, when they saw the  breach large enough for us to enter, and our soldiers ready to  assault them, surrendered themselves to the mercy of the King.  Their leaders were taken prisoners, and their Soldiers were sent  away without arms.    The camp being dispersed, I returned to Paris with my gentleman  whose leg I had cut off; I dressed him, and God healed him. I  sent him to his house merry with a wooden leg; and he was content  saying he had got off cheap, not to have been miserably burned to  stop the blood, as you write in your book, won petit matetre,          THE JOURNEY TO CHATEAU LE COMTE. 1552      Some time after. King Henry raised an army of thirty thousand  men, to go and lay waste the country about Hesdin. The King of  Navarre, who was then called M. de Vendosme, was chief of the  army, and the King's Lieutenant. Being at St. Denis, in France,  waiting while the companies passed by, he sent to Paris for me to  speak with him. When I came he begged me (and his request was a  command) to follow him on this journey; and I, wishing to make my  excuses, saying my wife was sick in bed, he made answer there  were physicians in Pairs to cure her, and he, too, had left his  wife, who was of as good a house as mine, and he said he would  use me well, and forthwith ordered I should be attached to his  household. Seeing this great desire he had to take me with him, I  dared not refuse him.    I went after him to Chateau le"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5697"],[0,"Tales of Chinatown (#4)"],[1," a double game. However, without actually agreeing to see me  again, she told me enough to enable me to meet her \"accidentally,\" if I  wanted to. Therefore, I am going to look out for her this evening, and  probably take her to a picture palace, or somewhere where we can have a  quiet talk. She seems to be fancy free, and for some reason I feel sorry  for the girl. I don't altogether like the job, but I hope to justify  your faith in me, Chief.    I will prepare my official report this evening when I return.    Yours obediently,--JOHN DURHAM.          V    LALA HUANG        \"No,\" said Lala Huang, \"I don't like London--not this part of London.\"    \"Where would you rather be?\" asked Durham. \"In China?\"    Dusk had dropped its merciful curtain over Limehouse, and as the two  paced slowly along West India Dock Road it seemed to the detective that  a sort of glamour had crept into the scene.    He was a clever man within his limitations, and cultured up to a point;  but he was not philosopher enough to know that he viewed the purlieus  of Limehouse through a haze of Oriental mystery conjured up by the  conversation of his companion. Temple bells there were in the clangour  of the road cars. The smoke-stacks had a semblance of pagodas. Burma she  had conjured up before him, and China, and the soft islands where she  had first seen the light. For as well as a streak of European, there  was Kanaka blood in Lala, which lent her an appeal quite new to Durham,  insidious and therefore dangerous.    \"Not China,\" she replied. \"Somehow I don't think I shall ever see China  again. But my father is rich, and it is dreadful to think that we live  here when there are so many more beautiful places to live in.\"    \"Then why does he stay?\" asked Durham with curiosity.    \"For money, always for money,\" answered Lala, shrugging her shoulders.  \"Yet if it is not to bring happiness, what good is it?\"    \"What good indeed?\" murmured Durham.    \"There is no fun for me,\" said the girl pathetically. \"Sometimes someone  nice comes to do business, but mostly they are Jews, Jews, always Jews,  and------\" Again she shrugged eloquently.    Durham perceived the very opening for which he had been seeking..    \"You evidently don't like Jews,\" he said endeavouring to speak lightly.    \"No,\" murmured the girl, \"I don't think I do. Some are nice, though. I  think it is the same with every kind of people--there are good and bad.\"    \"Were you ever in America?\" asked Durham.    \"No.\"    \"I was just thinking,\" he explained, \"that I have known several American  Jews who were quite good fellows.\"    \"Yes?\" said Lala, looking up at him naively, \"I met one not long ago. He  was not nice at all.\"    \"Oh!\" exclaimed Durham, startled by this admission, which he had not  anticipated. \"One of your father's customers?\"    \"Yes, a man named Cohen.\"    \"Cohen?\"    \"A funny little chap,\" continued the girl. \"He tried to make love  to me.\" She lowered her lashes roguishly. \"I knew all along he was  pretending. He was a thief, I think. I was afraid of him.\"    Durham did some rapid thinking, then:    \"Did you say his name was Cohen?\" he asked.    \"That was the name he gave.\"    \"A man named Cohen, an American, was found dead in the river quite  recently.\"    Lala stopped dead and clutched his arm.    \"How do you know?\" she demanded.    \"There was a paragraph in this morning's paper.\"    She hesitated, then:    \"Did it describe him?\" she asked.    \"No,\" replied Durham, \"I don't think it did in detail. At least, the  only part of the description which I remember is that he wore a large  and valuable diamond on his left hand.\"    \"Oh!\" whispered Lala.    She released her grip of Durham's arm and went on.    \"What?\" he asked. \"Did you think it was someone you knew?\"    \"I did know him,\" she replied simply. \"The man who was found drowned. It  is the same. I am sure now, because of the diamond ring. What paper did  you read it in? I want to read it myself.\"    \"I'm afraid I can't remember. It was probably the Daily Mail.\"    \"Had he been drowned?\"    \"I presume so--yes,\" replied Durham guardedly.    Lala Huang was silent for some time while they paced on through the  dusk. Then:    \"How strange!\" she said in a low voice.    \"I am sorry I mentioned it,\" declared Durham. \"But how was I to know it  was your friend?\"    \"He was no friend of mine,\" returned the girl sharply. \"I hated him. But  it is strange nevertheless. I am sure he intended to rob my father.\"    \"And is that why you think it strange?\"    \"Yes,\" she said, but her voice was almost inaudible.    They were come now to the narrow street communicating with the courtway  in which the great treasure-house of Huang Chow was situated, and Lala  stopped at the corner.    \"It was nice of you to walk along with me,\" she said. \"Do you live in  Limehouse?\"    \"No,\" replied Durham, \"I don't. As a matter of fact, I came down here  to-night in the hope of seeing you again.\"    \"Did you?\"    The girl glanced up at him doubtfully, and his distaste for the task set  him by his superior increased with the passing of every moment. He was  a man of some imagination, a great reader, and ambitious professionally.  He appreciated the fact that Chief Inspector Kerry looked for great  things from him, but for this type of work he had little inclination.    There was too much chivalry in his make-up to enable him to play upon a  woman's sentiments, even in the interests of justice. By whatever means  the man Cohen had met his death, and whether or no the Chinaman Pi Lung  had died by the same hand, Lala Huang was innocent of any complicity in  these matters, he was perfectly well assured.    Doubts were to come later when he was away from her, when he had had  leisure to consider that she might regard him in the light of a third  potential rifler of her father's treasure-house. But at the moment,  looking down into her dark eyes, he reproached himself and wondered  where his true duty lay.    \"It is so gray and dull and sordid here,\" said the girl, looking down  the darkened street. \"There is no one much to talk to.\"    \"But you have your business interests to keep you employed during the  day, after all.\"    \"I hate it all. I hate it all.\"    \"But you seem to have perfect freedom?\"    \"Yes. My mother, you see, was not Chinese.\"    \"But you wish to leave Limehouse?\"    \"I do. I do. Just now it is not so bad, but in the winter how I tire of  the gray skies, the endless drizzling rain. Oh!\" She shrank back into  the shadow of a doorway, clutching at Durham's arm. \"Don't let Ah Fu see  me.\"    \"Ah Fu? Who is Ah Fu?\" asked Durham, also drawing back as a furtive  figure went slinking down the opposite side of the street.    \"My father's servant. He let you in this morning.\"    \"And why must he not see you?\"    \"I don't trust him. I think he tells my father things.\"    \"What is it that he carries in his hand?\"    \"A birdcage, I expect.\"    \"A birdcage?\"    \"Yes!\"    He caught the gleam of her eyes as she looked up at him out of the  shadow.    \"Is he, then, a bird-fancier?\"    \"No, no, I can't explain because I don't understand myself. But Ah Fu  goes to a place in Shadwell regularly and buys young birds, always very  young ones and very little ones.\"    \"For what or for whom?\"    \"I don't know.\"    \"Have you an aviary in your house?\"    \"No.\"    \"Do you mean that they disappear, these purchases of Ah Fu's?\"    \"I often see him carrying a cage of young birds, but we have no birds in  the house.\"    \"How perfectly extraordinary!\" muttered Durham.    \"I distrust Ah Fu,\" whispered the girl. \"I am glad he did not see me  with you.\"    \"Young birds,\" murmured Durham absently. \"What kind of young birds? Any  particular breed?\"    \"No; canaries, linnets--all sorts. Isn't it funny?\" The girl laughed in  a childish way. \"And now I think Ah Fu will have gone in, so I must say  good night.\"    But when presently Detective Durham found himself walking back along  West India Dock Road, his mind's eye was set upon the slinking figure of  a Chinaman carrying a birdcage.          VI    A HINT OF INCENSE        One Chinaman more or less does not make any very great difference to  the authorities responsible for maintaining law and order in Limehouse.  Asiatic settlers are at liberty to follow their national propensities,  and to knife one another within reason. This is wisdom. Such recreations  are allowed, if not encouraged, by all wise rulers of Eastern peoples.    \"Found drowned,\" too, is a verdict which has covered many a dark mystery  of old Thames, but \"Found in the river, death having been due to the  action of some poison unknown,\" is a finding which even in the case of a  Chinaman is calculated to stimulate the jaded official mind.    New Scotland Yard had given Durham a roving commission, and had been  justified in the fact that the second victim, and this time not a  Chinaman, had been found under almost identical conditions. The link  with the establishment of Huang Chow was incomplete, and Durham fully  recognized that it was up to him to make it sound and incontestable.    Jim Poland was not the only man in the East End who knew that the dead  Chinaman had been in negotiation with Huang Chow. Kerry knew it, and had  passed the information on to Durham.    Some mystery surrounded the life of the old dealer, who was said to be  a mandarin of high rank, but his exact association with the deaths first  of the Chinaman Pi Lung, and second of Cohen, remained to be proved.  Certain critics have declared the Metropolitan detective service to be  obsolete and inefficient. Kerry, as a potential superintendent, resented  these criticisms, and in his protege Durham, perceived a member of the  new generation who was likely in time to produce results calculated to  remove this stigma.    Durham recognized that a greater responsibility rested upon his  shoulders than the actual importance of the case might have indicated;  and now, proceeding warily along the"]]]
