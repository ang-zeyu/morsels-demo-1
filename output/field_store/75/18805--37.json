And  Colonel Clay, you must remember, is a prince among conjurers.\"    \"Well, it's a comfort to know we've identified our man, and the  woman who was with him,\" Sir Charles said, with a slight sigh of  relief. \"The next thing will be, of course, you'll follow them up  on these clues in England and arrest them?\"    The Commissary shrugged his shoulders. \"Arrest them!\" he exclaimed,  much amused. \"Ah, monsieur, but you are sanguine! No officer of  justice has ever succeeded in arresting le Colonel Caoutchouc, as  we call him in French. He is as slippery as an eel, that man. He  wriggles through our fingers. Suppose even we caught him, what could  we prove? I ask you. Nobody who has seen him once can ever swear  to him again in his next impersonation. He is impayable, this good  Colonel. On the day when I arrest him, I assure you, monsieur, I  shall consider myself the smartest police-officer in Europe.\"    \"Well, I shall catch him yet,\" Sir Charles answered, and relapsed  into silence.          II    THE EPISODE OF THE DIAMOND LINKS      \"Let us take a trip to Switzerland,\" said Lady Vandrift. And any one  who knows Amelia will not be surprised to learn that we _did_ take a  trip to Switzerland accordingly. Nobody can drive Sir Charles, except  his wife. And nobody at all can drive Amelia.    There were difficulties at the outset, because we had not ordered  rooms at the hotels beforehand, and it was well on in the season;  but they were overcome at last by the usual application of a golden  key; and we found ourselves in due time pleasantly quartered in  Lucerne, at that most comfortable of European hostelries, the  Schweitzerhof.    We were a square party of four--Sir Charles and Amelia, myself and  Isabel. We had nice big rooms, on the first floor, overlooking the  lake; and as none of us was possessed with the faintest symptom of  that incipient mania which shows itself in the form of an insane  desire to climb mountain heights of disagreeable steepness and  unnecessary snowiness, I will venture to assert we all enjoyed  ourselves. We spent most of our time sensibly in lounging about the  lake on the jolly little steamers; and when we did a mountain climb,  it was on the Rigi or Pilatus--where an engine undertook all the  muscular work for us.    As usual, at the hotel, a great many miscellaneous people showed a  burning desire to be specially nice to us. If you wish to see how  friendly and charming humanity is, just try being a well-known  millionaire for a week, and you'll learn a thing or two. Wherever  Sir Charles goes he is surrounded by charming and disinterested  people, all eager to make his distinguished acquaintance, and all  familiar with several excellent investments, or several deserving  objects of Christian charity. It is my business in life, as his  brother-in-law and secretary, to decline with thanks the excellent  investments, and to throw judicious cold water on the objects of  charity. Even I myself, as the great man's almoner, am very much  sought after. People casually allude before me to artless stories  of \"poor curates in Cumberland, you know, Mr. Wentworth,\" or widows  in Cornwall, penniless poets with epics in their desks, and young  painters who need but the breath of a patron to open to them the  doors of an admiring Academy. I smile and look wise, while I  administer cold water in minute doses; but I never report one of  these cases to Sir Charles, except in the rare or almost unheard-of  event where I think there is really something in them.    Ever since our little adventure with the Seer at Nice, Sir Charles,  who is constitutionally cautious, had been even more careful than  usual about possible sharpers. And, as chance would have it, there  sat just opposite us at table d'hote at the Schweitzerhof--'tis  a fad of Amelia's to dine at table d'hote; she says she can't bear  to be boxed up all day in private rooms with \"too much family\"--a  sinister-looking man with dark hair and eyes, conspicuous by his  bushy overhanging eyebrows. My attention was first called to the  eyebrows in question by a nice little parson who sat at our side,  and who observed that they were made up of certain large and bristly  hairs, which (he told us) had been traced by Darwin to our monkey  ancestors. Very pleasant little fellow, this fresh-faced young  parson, on his honeymoon tour with a nice wee wife, a bonnie Scotch  lassie with a charming accent.    I looked at the eyebrows close. Then a sudden thought struck me. \"Do  you believe they're his own?\" I asked of the curate; \"or are they  only stuck on--a make-up disguise? They really almost look like it.\"    \"You don't suppose--\" Charles began, and checked himself suddenly.    \"Yes, I do,\" I answered; \"the Seer!\" Then I recollected my blunder,  and looked down sheepishly. For, to say the truth, Vandrift had  straightly enjoined on me long before to say nothing of our painful  little episode at Nice to Amelia; he was afraid if _she_ once heard  of it, _he_ would hear of it for ever after.    \"What Seer?\" the little parson inquired, with parsonical curiosity.    I noticed the man with the overhanging eyebrows give a queer sort  of start. Charles's glance was fixed upon me. I hardly knew what  to answer.    \"Oh, a man who was at Nice with us last year,\" I stammered out,  trying hard to look unconcerned. \"A fellow they talked about,  that's all.\" And I turned the subject.    But the curate, like a donkey, wouldn't let me turn it.    \"Had he eyebrows like that?\" he inquired, in an undertone. I was  really angry. If this _was_ Colonel Clay, the curate was obviously  giving him the cue, and making it much more difficult for us to  catch him, now we might possibly have lighted on the chance of  doing so.    \"No, he hadn't,\" I answered testily; \"it was a passing expression.  But this is not the man. I was mistaken, no doubt.\" And I nudged  him gently.    The little curate was too innocent for anything. \"Oh, I see,\" he  replied, nodding hard and looking wise. Then he turned to his wife  and made an obvious face, which the man with the eyebrows couldn't  fail to notice.    Fortunately, a political discussion going on a few places farther  down the table spread up to us and diverted attention for a moment.  The magical name of Gladstone saved us. Sir Charles flared up. I  was truly pleased, for I could see Amelia was boiling over with  curiosity by this time.    After dinner, in the billiard-room, however, the man with the big  eyebrows sidled up and began to talk to me. If he _was_ Colonel  Clay, it was evident he bore us no grudge at all for the five  thousand pounds he had done us out of. On the contrary, he seemed  quite prepared to do us out of five thousand more when opportunity  offered; for he introduced himself at once as Dr. Hector Macpherson,  the exclusive grantee of extensive concessions from the Brazilian  Government on the Upper Amazons. He dived into conversation with  me at once as to the splendid mineral resources of his Brazilian  estate--the silver, the platinum, the actual rubies, the possible  diamonds. I listened and smiled; I knew what was coming. All he  needed to develop this magnificent concession was a little more  capital. It was sad to see thousands of pounds' worth of platinum  and car-loads of rubies just crumbling in the soil or carried away  by the river, for want of a few hundreds to work them with properly.  If he knew of anybody, now, with money to invest, he could recommend  him--nay, offer him--a unique opportunity of earning, say, 40 per  cent on his capital, on unimpeachable security.    \"I wouldn't do it for every man,\" Dr. Hector Macpherson remarked,  drawing himself up; \"but if I took a fancy to a fellow who had  command of ready cash, I might choose to put him in the way of  feathering his nest with unexampled rapidity.\"    \"Exceedingly disinterested of you,\" I answered drily, fixing my  eyes on his eyebrows.    The little curate, meanwhile, was playing billiards with Sir  Charles. His glance followed mine as it rested for a moment on  the monkey-like hairs.    \"False, obviously false,\" he remarked with his lips; and I'm bound  to confess I never saw any man speak so well by movement alone;  you could follow every word though not a sound escaped him.    During the rest of that evening Dr. Hector Macpherson stuck to me  as close as a mustard-plaster. And he was almost as irritating. I  got heartily sick of the Upper Amazons. I have positively waded in  my time through ruby mines (in prospectuses, I mean) till the mere  sight of a ruby absolutely sickens me. When Charles, in an unwonted  fit of generosity, once gave his sister Isabel (whom I had the  honour to marry) a ruby necklet (inferior stones), I made Isabel  change it for sapphires and amethysts, on the judicious plea that  they suited her complexion better. (I scored one, incidentally, for  having considered Isabel's complexion.) By the time I went to bed  I was prepared to sink the Upper Amazons in the sea, and to stab,  shoot, poison, or otherwise seriously damage the man with the  concession and the false eyebrows.    For the next three days, at intervals, he returned to the charge. He  bored me to death with his platinum and his rubies. He didn't want a  capitalist who would personally exploit the thing; he would prefer  to do it all on his own account, giving the capitalist preference  debentures of his bogus company, and a lien on the concession. I  listened and smiled; I listened and yawned; I listened and was rude;  I ceased to listen at all; but still he droned on with it. I fell  asleep on the steamer one day, and woke up in ten minutes to hear  him droning yet, "]]]
