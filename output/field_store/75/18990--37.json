[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8395"],[0,"The Gods of Pegana (#4)"],[1," the Lord of  Noises in the Night, awaketh in his lair and creepeth round the  forest to see whether it be true that Hish hath gone.    Then in some glade Wohoon lifts up his voice and cries aloud, that  all the night may hear, that it is he, Wohoon, who is abroad in  all the forest. And the wolf and the fox and the owl, and the  great beasts and the small, lift up their voices to acclaim  Wohoon. And there arise the sounds of voices and the stirring of  leaves.        THE REVOLT OF THE HOME GODS      There be three broad rivers of the plain, born before memory or  fable, whose mothers are three grey peaks and whose father was the  storm. There names be Eimes, Zaenes, and Segastrion.    And Eimes is the joy of lowing herds; and Zaenes hath bowed his  neck to the yoke of man, and carries the timber from the forest  far up below the mountain; and Segastrion sings old songs to  shepherd boys, singing of his childhood in a lone ravine and of  how he once sprang down the mountain sides and far away into the  plain to see the world, and of how one day at last he will find  the sea. These be the rivers of the plain, wherein the plain  rejoices. But old men tell, whose fathers heard it from the  ancients, how once the lords of the three rivers of the plain  rebelled against the law of the Worlds, and passed beyond their  boundaries, and joined together and whelmed cities and slew men,  saying: \"We now play the game of the gods and slay men for our  pleasure, and we be greater than the gods of Pegana.\"    And all the plain was flooded to the hills.    And Eimes, Zaenes, and Segastrion sat upon the mountains, and  spread their hands over their rivers that rebelled by their  command.    But the prayer of men going upward found Pegana, and cried in the  ear of the gods: \"There be three home gods who slay us for their  pleasure, and say that they be mightier than Pegana's gods, and  play Their game with men.\"    Then were all the gods of Pegana very wroth; but They could not  whelm the lords of the three rivers, because being home gods,  though small, they were immortal.    And still the home gods spread their hands across their rivers,  with their fingers wide apart, and the waters rose and rose, and  the voice of their torrent grew louder, crying: \"Are we not Eimes,  Zaenes, and Segastrion?\"    Then Mung went down into a waste of Afrik, and came upon the  drought Umbool as he sat in the desert upon iron rocks, clawing  with miserly grasp at the bones of men and breathing hot.    And Mung stood before him as his dry sides heaved, and ever as  they sank his hot breath blasted dry sticks and bones.    Then Mung said: \"Friend of Mung! Go, thou and grin before the  faces of Eimes, Zaenes, and Segastrion till they see whether it be  wise to rebel against the gods of Pegana.\"    And Umbool answered: \"I am the beast of Mung.\"    And Umbool came and crouched upon a hill upon the other side of  the waters and grinned across them at the rebellious home gods.    And whenever Eimes, Zaenes, and Segastrion stretched out their  hands over their rivers they saw before their faces the grinning  of Umbool; and because the grinning was like death in a hot and  hideous land therefore they turned away and spread their hands no  more over their rivers, and the waters sank and sank.    But when Umbool had grinned for thirty days the waters fell back  into the river beds and the lords of the rivers slunk away back  again to their homes: still Umbool sat and grinned.    Then Eimes sought to hide himself in a great pool beneath a rock,  and Zaenes crept into the middle of a wood, and Segastrion lay and  panted on the sand--still Umbool sat and grinned.    And Eimes grew lean, and was forgotten, so that the men of the  plain would say: \"Here once was Eimes\"; and Zaenes scarce had  strength to lead his river to the sea; and as Segastrion lay and  panted a man stepped over his stream, and Segastrion said: \"It is  the foot of a man that has passed across my neck, and I have sought  to be greater than the gods of Pegana.\"    Then said the gods of Pegana: \"It is enough. We are the gods of  Pegana, and none are equal.\"    Then Mung sent Umbool back to his waste in Afrik to breathe again  upon the rocks, and parch the desert, and to sear the memory of  Afrik into the brains of all who ever bring their bones away.    And Eimes, Zaenes, and Segastrion sang again, and walked once more  in their accustomed haunts, and played the game of Life and Death  with fishes and frogs, but never essayed to play it any more with  men, as do the gods of Pegana.        OF DOROZHAND    (Whose Eyes Regard The End)      Sitting above the lives of the people, and looking, doth Dorozhand  see that which is to be.    The god of Destiny is Dorozhand. Upon whom have looked the eyes of  Dorozhand he goeth forward to an end that naught may stay; he  becometh the arrow from the bow of Dorozhand hurled forward at a  mark he may not see--to the goal of Dorozhand. Beyond the thinking  of men, beyond the sight of all the other gods, regard the eyes of  Dorozhand.    He hath chosen his slaves. And them doth the destiny god drive  onward where he will, who, knowing not whither nor even knowing  why, feel only his scourge behind them or hear his cry before.    There is something that Dorozhand would fain achieve, and,  therefore, hath he set the people striving, with none to cease or  rest in all the worlds. But the gods of Pegana, speaking to the  gods, say: \"What is it that Dorozhand would fain achieve?\"    It hath been written and said that not only the destinies of men  are the care of Dorozhand but that even the gods of Pegana be not  unconcerned by his will.    All the gods of Pegana have felt a fear, for they have seen a look  in the eyes of Dorozhand that regardeth beyond the gods.    The reason and purpose of the Worlds is that there should be Life  upon the Worlds, and Life is the instrument of Dorozhand wherewith  he would achieve his end.    Therefore the Worlds go on, and the rivers run to the sea, and Life  ariseth and flieth even in all the Worlds, and the gods of Pegana  do the work of the gods--and all for Dorozhand. But when the end of  Dorozhand hath been achieved there will be need no longer of Life upon  the Worlds, nor any more a game for the small gods to play. Then will  Kib tiptoe gently across Pegana to the resting-place in Highest Pegana  of MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI, and touching reverently his hand, the hand that  wrought the gods, say: \"MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI, thou hast rested long.\"    And MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI shall say: \"Not so; for I have rested for but  fifty aeons of the gods, each of them scarce more than ten million  mortal years of the Worlds that ye have made.\"    And then shall the gods be afraid when they find that MANA knoweth  that they have made Worlds while he rested. And they shall answer:  \"Nay; but the Worlds came all of themselves.\"    Then MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI, as one who would have done with an irksome  matter, will lightly wave his hand--the hand that wrought the  gods--and there shall be gods no more.    When there shall be three moons towards the north above the Star  of the Abiding, three moons that neither wax nor wane but regard  towards the North.    Or when the comet ceaseth from his seeking and stands still, not any  longer moving among the Worlds but tarrying as one who rests after  the end of search, then shall arise from resting, because it is THE  END, the Greater One, who rested of old time, even MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI.    Then shall the Times that were be Times no more; and it may be  that the old, dead days shall return from beyond the Rim, and we  who have wept for them shall see those days again, as one who,  returning from long travel to his home, comes suddenly on dear,  remembered things.    For none shall know of MANA who hath rested for so long, whether  he be a harsh or merciful god. It may be that he shall have mercy,  and that these things shall be.        THE EYE IN THE WASTE      There lie seven deserts beyond Bodrahan, which is the city of the  caravans' end. None goeth beyond. In the first desert lie the  tracks of mighty travellers outward from Bodrahan, and some  returning. And in the second lie only outward tracks, and none  return.    The third is a desert untrodden by the feet of men.    The fourth is the desert of sand, and the fifth is the desert of  dust, and the sixth is the desert of stones, and the seventh is  the Desert of Deserts.    In the midst of the last of the deserts that lie beyond Bodrahan,  in the centre of the Desert of Deserts, standeth the image that  hath been hewn of old out of the living hill whose name is  Ranorada--the eye in the waste.    About the base of Ranorada is carved in mystic letters that are  vaster than the beds of streams these words:    To the god who knows.    Now, beyond the second desert are no tracks, and there is no water  in all the seven deserts that lie beyond Bodrahan. Therefore came  no man thither to hew that statue from the living hills, and  Ranorada was wrought by the hands of gods. Men tell in Bodrahan,  where the caravans end and all the drivers of the camels rest, how  once the gods hewed Ranorada from the living hill, hammering all  night long beyond the deserts. Moreover, they say that Ranorada is  carved in the likeness of the god Hoodrazai, who hath found the  secret of MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI, and knoweth the wherefore of the making  of the gods.    They say that Hoodrazai stands all alone in Pegana and speaks to  none because he knows what is hidden from the gods.    Therefore the gods have made his image in a lonely land as one who  thinks and is silent--the eye in the waste.    They say that Hoodrazai had heard the murmers of MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI  as he muttered to himself, and gleaned the meaning, and knew; and  that he was the god of mirth and of abundant joy, but became from  the moment of his knowing a mirthless god, even as his image,  which regards the deserts beyond the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8417"],[0,"What Led to the Discovery of the Source of the Nile (#4)"],[1,"by the women from certain grasses and the Daum palm, ostrich  feathers, and hides, and settle on the coast to exchange them in  barter with the outer merchants, such as Arabs and men from Cutch, who  bring thither cloths, dates, rice, beads, and iron for that purpose.    Of all the trading places on the coast, the most important is Berbera;  it is, in fact, the great emporium of Somali land, and we must call  the reader's particular attention to it, since it forms the chief  point of interest in these pages. It is on the same meridian as Aden,  and only divided from it by the gulf of that name. Although it is of  such great importance, it is only inhabited during the five months of  the favourable monsoon, when great caravans come up from the rich  provinces which lie to its south and south-west, the principal ones  being those from Ugahden and Harar.    Having now given a general sketch of the country, we shall enter upon  the objects of the expedition. It was obvious, by the lay of the land,  that the richest and most interesting part of the country must be that  which lies between the Jub and Webbe Shebéli rivers, and it was the  most accessible to inspection, as large and powerful caravans,  travelling southwards through Ugahden, much frequent it. Seeing this,  Lieutenant Burton conceived the idea of waiting until the breaking up  of the Berbera fair, when the caravans disperse to their homes, to  travel by the ordinary caravan route, through the Ugahden country to  the Webbe Shebéli, and on to Gananah, and then to proceed further by  any favourable opportunity to the Zanzibar coast.    It was now, however, early October, and fully five months must elapse  ere we could finally enter on our march. In the mean time, Lieutenant  Burton, desirous of becoming acquainted as far as possible with the  habits of the people we were destined to travel amongst, as well as  the nature of the country and the modes of travelling in this _terra  incognita_, determined on making an experimental tour to Harar, a  place which had never been entered by any European, and was said to be  inaccessible to them. Harar, as I have said before, sends caravans  annually to the Berbera fair, and therefore comes within the influence  of British power. Taking advantage of this, Lieutenant Burton ordered  Herne to go to Berbera whilst he was on this expedition, to keep up a  diversion in his favour, arming him with instructions, that in case he  was detained in Harar by the Amir of that place, Herne might detain  their caravan as a ransom for the release of his party.    Further, to obtain more accurate knowledge concerning the march of the  Ugahden caravans, to gain an insight into the market transactions of  Berbera, and to collect cattle for our final march, it was deemed  advisable he should go there. Stroyan, as soon as he could manage it,  was also to go to Berbera to assist him. Thus everybody had a duty to  perform during this interregnum but myself.    Dreading the monotony of a station life, I now volunteered to travel  in any direction my commandant might think proper to direct, and to  any length of time he might consider it advisable for me to be away.  This proposition had its effect, as affording an extra opportunity of  obtaining the knowledge desired, and instructions were drawn up for my  guidance. I was to proceed to Bunder Gori, on the Warsingali frontier,  to penetrate the country southwards as far as possible, passing over  the maritime hill-range, and, turning thence westwards, was to inspect  the Wadi Nogal, and march direct on Berbera, to meet Stroyan and  Herne, at a date not later than the 15th January 1855. Whilst  travelling I was to remark upon the watershed of the country, plot the  route I travelled, keep _copious_ notes on everything I saw, and  collect specimens of natural history in all its branches, as well as  observe and register all meteorological phenomena, and buy camels and  ponies for the great future expedition.    Funds for the expenses of this undertaking were not available at that  time from the public purse, as the Indian Government had stipulated  that the whole sum they would advance for this great expedition should  not exceed £1000, and, for security's sake, had decided on paying it  by instalments of £250 at a time. I therefore, desirous to render as  much assistance as lay within my power to further the cause I had  embarked upon, volunteered to advance the necessary sum from my own  private resources, trusting to Lieutenant Burton's promises in the  future for being repaid.    This project settled, I at once set to work, and commenced laying in  such stores as were necessary for an outfit, whilst Lieutenant Burton,  who had been long resident in Aden, engaged two men to assist me on  the journey. The first was a man named Sumunter, who ranked highly in  his country, who was to be my _Abban_ or protector. The duty of  abbanship is of the greatest importance, for it rests entirely on the  Abban's honesty whether his client can succeed in doing anything in  the country he takes him through. Arabs, when travelling under their  protection, have to ask his permission for anything they may wish to  do, and cannot even make a march, or purchase anything, without his  sanction being first obtained. The Abban introduces the person under  his protection to the chief of his clan, is answerable for all  outrages committed on the way, and is the recognised go-between in all  questions of dispute or barter, and in every other fashion. The second  man was also a Warsingali,[8] by name Ahmed, who knew a slight  smattering of Hindustani, and acted as interpreter between us. I then  engaged two other men, a Hindustani butler named Imam, and a Seedi  called Farhan. This latter man was a perfect Hercules in stature, with  huge arms and limbs, knit together with largely developed ropy-looking  muscles. He had a large head, with small eyes, flabby squat nose, and  prominent muzzle filled with sharp-pointed teeth, as if in imitation  of a crocodile. Farhan told me that when very young he was kidnapped  on the Zanzibar coast by the captain of a small Arab vessel. This  captain one day seeing him engaged with many other little children  playing on the sandy seashore, offered him a handful of fine  fruity-looking dates, which proved so tempting to his juvenile taste  that he could not resist the proffered bait, and he made a grab at  them. The captain's powerful fingers then fell like a mighty trap on  his little closed hand, and he was hurried off to the vessel, where he  was employed in the capacity of \"powder-monkey.\" In this position he  remained serving until full grown, when, finding an opportunity, he  ran away from his master, and has ever since lived the life of a  \"free-man.\"    As a soldier, he had been tried in warfare, and was proved valorous  and cunning in the art, and promised to be a very efficient guard for  me. The next thing of most importance to be considered was the dress I  should wear. I first consulted the Colonel (Outram), who said he was  averse to our going in disguise, thinking that lowering ourselves in  this manner would operate against me in the estimation of the natives.  But this did not suit Lieutenant Burton's plans, who, not wishing to  be conspicuous whilst travelling to Harar, determined on going there  disguised as an Arab merchant, and thought it better we should appear  as his disciples, in accordance with which Herne had already purchased  his dress, and now I bought mine. It was anything but pleasant to the  feel. I had a huge hot turban, a long close-fitting gown, baggy loose  drawers, drawn in at the ankles, sandals on my naked feet, and a silk  girdle decorated with pistol and dirk. As an outfit for this especial  journey, I bought at Aden £120 worth of miscellaneous articles,  consisting chiefly of English and American sheeting, some coarse  fabrics of indigo-dyed Indian manufacture, several sacks of dates and  rice, and a large quantity of salt, with a few coloured stuffs of  greater value than the other cloths, to give away as presents to the  native chiefs. As defensible and other useful implements for the  scientific portion of the expedition, I took rifles, guns, muskets,  pistols, sabres, ammunition in great quantity, large commodious  camel-boxes for carrying specimens of natural history, one sextant and  artificial horizon, three boiling-point and common atmospheric  thermometers, and one primitive kind of camera obscure, which I had  made at Aden under the ingenious supervision of Herne.                                      Chapter II.

On the 18th October 1854, having got all my preparations completed, I  embarked in an Arab vessel, attired in my Oriental costume, with my  retinue and kit complete, and set sail that same evening at 6 P.M.    The voyage, owing to light and varying breezes, was very slow and  tedious. Instead of performing the whole voyage in three days, the  ordinary time, it took us nine. According to the method of Arab  navigation, instead of going from port to port direct, we first  tracked eastward along the Arabian shore three successive days,  setting sail at sunrise, and anchoring regularly at sundown. By this  time we were supposed to be opposite Bunder Héis, on the Somali coast,  and the Nahkoda (captain) thought it time for crossing over the Gulf.  We therefore put out to sea at sunrise on the morning of the 21st, and  arrived the same evening, by mistake, assisted with a stiffish  easterly breeze, at a small place called Rakodah, which, by report,  contained a small fort, three mat huts, and many burnt ones, a little  to the westward of Bunder Héis. My Abban accounted for the destruction  of this place by saying"]]]
