So may the lustre of your days    Outshine the deeds Firdusi sung,    Your name within a nation's prayer,    Your music on a nation's tongue.        LEILI      The serpents are asleep among the poppies,    The fireflies light the soundless panther's way    To tangled paths where shy gazelles are straying,    And parrot-plumes outshine the dying day.    O soft! the lotus-buds upon the stream    Are stirring like sweet maidens when they dream.      A caste-mark on the azure brows of Heaven,    The golden moon burns sacred, solemn, bright    The winds are dancing in the forest-temple,    And swooning at the holy feet of Night.    Hush! in the silence mystic voices sing    And make the gods their incense-offering.        IN THE FOREST      Here, O my heart, let us burn the dear dreams that are dead,    Here in this wood let us fashion a funeral pyre    Of fallen white petals and leaves that are mellow and red,    Here let us burn them in noon's flaming torches of fire.      We are weary, my heart, we are weary, so long we have borne    The heavy loved burden of dreams that are dead, let us rest,    Let us scatter their ashes away, for a while let us mourn;    We will rest, O my heart, till the shadows are gray in the west.      But soon we must rise, O my heart, we must wander again    Into the war of the world and the strife of the throng;    Let us rise, O my heart, let us gather the dreams that remain,    We will conquer the sorrow of life with the  sorrow of song.        PAST AND FUTURE      THE NEW HATH COME AND NOW THE OLD RETIRES:    And so the past becomes a mountain-cell,    Where lone, apart, old hermit-memories dwell    In consecrated calm, forgotten yet    Of the keen heart that hastens to forget    Old longings in fulfilling new desires.      And now the Soul stands in a vague, intense    Expectancy and anguish of suspense,    On the dim chamber-threshold . . . lo! he sees    Like a strange, fated bride as yet unknown,    His timid future shrinking there alone,    Beneath her marriage-veil of mysteries.        LIFE      Children, ye have not lived, to you it seems    Life is a lovely stalactite of dreams,    Or carnival of careless joys that leap    About your hearts like billows on the deep    In flames of amber and of amethyst.      Children, ye have not lived, ye but exist    Till some resistless hour shall rise and move    Your hearts to wake and hunger after love,    And thirst with passionate longing for the things    That burn your brows with blood-red sufferings.      Till ye have battled with great grief and fears,    And borne the conflict of dream-shattering years,    Wounded with fierce desire and worn with strife,    Children, ye have not lived: for this is life.        THE POET'S LOVE-SONG      In noon-tide hours, O Love, secure and strong,       I need thee not; mad dreams are mine to bind       The world to my desire, and hold the wind    A voiceless captive to my conquering song.       I need thee not, I am content with these:       Keep silence in thy soul, beyond the seas!      But in the desolate hour of midnight, when       An ecstasy of starry silence sleeps       On the still mountains and the soundless deeps,    And my soul hungers for thy voice, O then,       Love, like the magic of wild melodies,       Let thy soul answer mine across the seas.        TO THE GOD OF PAIN      Unwilling priestess in thy cruel fane,    Long hast thou held me, pitiless god of Pain,    Bound to thy worship by reluctant vows,    My tired breast girt with suffering, and my brows    Anointed with perpetual weariness.    Long have I borne thy service, through the stress    Of rigorous years, sad days and slumberless nights,    Performing thine inexorable rites.      For thy dark altars, balm nor milk nor rice,    But mine own soul thou'st ta'en for sacrifice:    All the rich honey of my youth's desire,    And all the sweet oils from my crushed life drawn,    And all my flower-like dreams and gem-like  fire    Of hopes up-leaping like the light of dawn.      I have no more to give, all that was mine    Is laid, a wrested tribute, at thy shrine;    Let me depart, for my whole soul is wrung,    And all my cheerless orisons are sung;    Let me depart, with faint limbs let me creep    To some dim shade and sink me down to sleep.        THE SONG OF PRINCESS ZEB-UN-NISSA    IN PRAISE OF HER OWN BEAUTY      (From the Persian)      When from my cheek I lift my veil,    The roses turn with envy pale,         And from their pierced hearts, rich with pain,    Send forth their fragrance like a wail.      Or if perchance one perfumed tress    Be lowered to the wind's caress,         The honeyed hyacinths complain,    And languish in a sweet distress.      And, when I pause, still groves among,    (Such loveliness is mine) a throng         Of nightingales awake and strain    Their souls into a quivering song.        INDIAN DANCERS      Eyes ravished with rapture, celestially panting,          what passionate bosoms aflaming with fire    Drink deep of the hush of the hyacinth          heavens that glimmer around them in          fountains of light;    O wild and entrancing the strain of keen music          that cleaveth the stars like a wail of desire,    And beautiful dancers with houri-like faces          bewitch the voluptuous watches of night.      The scents of red roses and sandalwood flutter          and die in the maze of their gem-tangled hair,    And smiles are entwining like magical serpents          the poppies of lips that are opiate-sweet;    Their glittering garments of purple are burning          like tremulous dawns in the quivering air,    And exquisite, subtle and slow are the tinkle          and tread of their rhythmical, slumber-soft feet.      Now silent, now singing and swaying and swinging,          like blossoms that bend to the breezes or showers,    Now wantonly winding, they flash, now they          falter, and, lingering, languish in radiant          choir;    Their jewel-girt arms and warm, wavering, lily-long          fingers enchant through melodious hours,    Eyes ravished with rapture, celestially panting,          what passionate bosoms aflaming with fire!        MY DEAD DREAM      Have you found me, at last, O my Dream?         Seven aeons ago    You died and I buried you deep under forests         of snow.    Why have you come hither? Who bade you         awake from your sleep    And track me beyond the cerulean foam of the         deep?      Would you tear from my lintels these sacred         green garlands of leaves?    Would you scare the white, nested, wild         pigeons of joy from my eaves?    Would you touch and defile with dead fingers         the robes of my priest?    Would you weave your dim moan with the         chantings of love at my feast?      Go back to your grave, O my Dream, under         forests of snow,    Where a heart-riven child hid you once, seven         aeons ago.    Who bade you arise from your darkness? I         bid you depart!    Profane not the shrines I have raised in the         clefts of my heart.        DAMAYANTE TO NALA IN THE HOUR OF EXILE      (A fragment)      Shalt thou be conquered of a human fate    My liege, my lover, whose imperial head    Hath never bent in sorrow of defeat?    Shalt thou be vanquished, whose imperial feet    Have shattered armies and stamped empires dead?    Who shall unking thee, husband of a queen?    Wear thou thy majesty inviolate.    Earth's glories flee of human eyes unseen,    Earth's kingdoms fade to a remembered dream,    But thine henceforth shall be a power supreme,    Dazzling command and rich dominion,    The winds thy heralds and thy vassals all    The silver-belted planets and the sun.    Where'er the radiance of thy coming fall,    Shall dawn for thee her saffron footcloths spread,    Sunset her purple canopies and red,    In serried splendour, and the night unfold    Her velvet darkness wrought with starry gold    For kingly raiment, soft as cygnet-down.    My hair shall braid thy temples like a crown    Of sapphires, and my kiss upon thy brows    Like cithar-music lull thee to repose,    Till the sun yield thee homage of his light.      O king, thy kingdom who from thee can wrest?    What fate shall dare uncrown thee from this breast,    O god-born lover, whom my love doth gird    And armour with impregnable delight    Of Hope's triumphant keen flame-carven sword?        THE QUEEN'S RIVAL      QUEEN Gulnaar sat on her ivory bed,    Around her countless treasures were spread;      Her chamber walls were richly inlaid    With agate, porphory, onyx and jade;      The tissues that veiled her delicate breast,    Glowed with the hues of a lapwing's crest;      But still she gazed in her mirror and sighed    \"O King, my heart is unsatisfied.\"      King Feroz bent from his ebony seat:    \"Is thy least desire unfulfilled, O Sweet?      \"Let thy mouth speak and my life be spent    To clear the sky of thy discontent.\"      \"I tire of my beauty, I tire of this    Empty splendour and shadowless bliss;      \"With none to envy and none gainsay,    No savour or salt hath my dream or day.\"      Queen Gulnaar sighed like a murmuring rose:    \"Give me a rival, O King Feroz.\"        II      King Feroz spoke to his Chief Vizier:    \"Lo! ere to-morrow's dawn be here,      \"Send forth my messengers over the sea,    To seek seven beautiful brides for me;      \"Radiant of feature and regal of mien,    Seven handmaids meet for the Persian Queen.\"             .       .       .       .       .        Seven new moon tides at the Vesper call,    King Feroz led to Queen Gulnaar's hall      A young queen eyed like the morning star:    \"I bring thee a rival, O Queen Gulnaar.\"      But still she gazed in her mirror and sighed:    \"O King, my heart is unsatisfied.\"      Seven queens shone round her ivory bed,    Like seven soft gems on a silken thread,      Like seven fair lamps in a royal tower,    Like"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6812"],[0,"Abraham Lincoln: a History — Volume 01 (#4)"],[1,"Cumberland Gap, in which his  eldest son and five more young men were killed by Indians, and the  whole party, discouraged by the blow, retired to the safer region of  Clinch River. In the mean time the dauntless speculator Richard  Henderson had begun his occupation with all the pomp of viceroyalty.  Harrodsburg had been founded, and corn planted, and a flourishing  colony established at the Falls of the Ohio. In 1774 Boone was called  upon by the Governor of Virginia to escort a party of surveyors  through Kentucky, and on his return was given the command of three  garrisons; and for several years thereafter the history of the State  is the record of his feats of arms. No one ever equaled him in his  knowledge of Indian character, and his influence with the savages was  a mystery to him and to themselves. Three times he fell into their  hands and they did not harm him. Twice they adopted him into their  tribes while they were still on the war-path. Once they took him to  Detroit, [Footnote: Silas Farmer, historiographer of Detroit, informs  us that Daniel Boone was brought there on the 10th of March, 1778, and  that he remained there a month.] to show the Long-Knife chieftains of  King Greorge that they also could exhibit trophies of memorable  prowess, but they refused to give him up even to their British allies.  In no quality of wise woodcraft was he wanting. He could outrun a dog  or a deer; he could thread the woods without food day and night; he  could find his way as easily as the panther could. Although a great  athlete and a tireless warrior, he hated fighting and only fought for  peace. In council and in war he was equally valuable. His advice was  never rejected without disaster, nor followed but with advantage; and  when the fighting once began there was not a rifle in Kentucky which  could rival his. At the nine days' siege of Boonesboro' he took  deliberate aim and killed a negro renegade who was harassing the  garrison from a tree five hundred and twenty-five feet away, and whose  head only was visible from the fort. The mildest and the quietest of  men, he had killed dozens of enemies with his own hand, and all this  without malice and, strangest of all, without incurring the hatred of  his adversaries. He had self-respect enough, but not a spark of  vanity. After the fatal battle of the Blue Licks,--where the only  point of light in the day's terrible work was the wisdom and valor  with which he had partly retrieved a disaster he foresaw but was  powerless to prevent,--when it became his duty, as senior surviving  officer of the forces, to report the affair to Governor Harrison, his  dry and naked narrative gives not a single hint of what he had done  himself, nor mentions the gallant son lying dead on the field, nor the  wounded brother whose gallantry might justly have claimed some notice.  He was thinking solely of the public good, saying, \"I have encouraged  the people in this country all that I could, but I can no longer  justify them or myself to risk our lives here under such extraordinary  hazards.\" He therefore begged his Excellency to take immediate  measures for relief. During the short existence of Henderson's  legislature he was a member of it, and not the least useful one. Among  his measures was one for the protection of game.    [Illustration:   LAND WARRANT ISSUED TO ABRAHAM LINKHORN (LINCOLN). The  original, of which this is a reduced fac-simile, is in the possession  of Colonel R. T, Durrett, Louisville, Ky.]    [Sidenote: Jefferson County Records.]    Everything we know of the emigrant Abraham Lincoln goes to show that  it was under the auspices of this most famous of our pioneers that he  set out from Rockingham County to make a home for himself and his  young family in that wild region which Boone was wresting from its  savage holders. He was not without means of his own. He took with him  funds enough to enter an amount of land which would have made his  family rich if they had retained it. The county records show him to  have been the possessor of a domain of some seventeen hundred acres.  There is still in existence [Transcriber's Note: Lengthy footnote  relocated to chapter end.] the original warrant, dated March 4, 1780,  for four hundred acres of land, for which the pioneer had paid \"into  the publick Treasury one hundred and sixty pounds current money,\" and  a copy of the surveyor's certificate, giving the metes and bounds of  the property on Floyd's Fork, which remained for many years in the  hands of Mordecai Lincoln, the pioneer's eldest son and heir. The name  was misspelled \"Linkhorn\" by a blunder of the clerk in the  land-office, and the error was perpetuated in the subsequent record.    Kentucky had been for many years the country of romance and fable for  Virginians. Twenty years before Governor Spotswood had crossed the  Alleghanies and returned to establish in a Williamsburg tavern that  fantastic order of nobility which he called the Knights of The Golden  Horseshoe, [Footnote: Their motto was _Sic jurat transcendere  montes_.] and, with a worldly wisdom which was scarcely consistent  with these medieval affectations, to press upon the attention of the  British Government the building of a line of frontier forts to guard  the Ohio River from the French. Many years after him the greatest of  all Virginians crossed the mountains again, and became heavily  interested in those schemes of emigration which filled the minds of  many of the leading men in America until they were driven out by  graver cares and more imperative duties. Washington had acquired  claims and patents to the amount of thirty or forty thousand acres of  land in the West; Benjamin Franklin and the Lees were also large  owners of these speculative titles. They formed, it is true, rather an  airy and unsubstantial sort of possession, the same ground being often  claimed by a dozen different persons or companies under various grants  from the crown or from legislatures, or through purchase by  adventurers from Indian councils. But about the time of which we are  speaking the spirit of emigration had reached the lower strata of  colonial society, and a steady stream of pioneers began pouring over  the passes of the mountains into the green and fertile valleys of  Kentucky and Tennessee. They selected their homes in the most eligible  spots to which chance or the report of earlier explorers directed  them, with little knowledge or care as to the rightful ownership of  the land, and too often cleared their corner of the wilderness for the  benefit of others. Even Boone, to whose courage, forest lore, and  singular intuitions of savage character the State of Kentucky owed  more than to any other man, was deprived in his old age of his hard-  earned homestead through his ignorance of legal forms, and removed to  Missouri to repeat in that new territory his labors and his  misfortunes.    [Illustration:   FAC-SIMILE FROM THE FIELD BOOK OF DANIEL BOONE. This  record of the Lincoln Claim on Licking River is from the original in  posession of Lyman C. Draper, Madison, Wis.]    [Sidenote: 1780.]    The period at which Lincoln came West was one of note in the history  of Kentucky. The labors of Henderson and the Transylvania Company had  begun to bear fruit in extensive plantations and a connected system of  forts. The land laws of Kentucky had reduced to something like order  the chaos of conflicting claims arising from the various grants and  the different preemption customs under which settlers occupied their  property. The victory of Boone at Boonesboro' against the Shawnees,  and the capture of Kaskaskia and Vincennes by the brilliant audacity  of George Rogers Clark, had brought the region prominently to the  attention of the Atlantic States, and had turned in that direction the  restless and roving spirits which are always found in communities at  periods when great emigrations are a need of civilization. Up to this  time few persons had crossed the mountains except hunters, trappers,  and explorers--men who came merely to kill game, and possibly Indians,  or to spy out the fertility of the land for the purpose of  speculation. But in 1780 and 1781 a large number of families took up  their line of march, and in the latter year a considerable contingent  of women joined the little army of pioneers, impelled by an instinct  which they themselves probably but half comprehended. The country was  to be peopled, and there was no other way of peopling it but by the  sacrifice of many lives and fortunes; and the history of every country  shows that these are never lacking when they are wanted. The number of  those who came at about the same time with the pioneer Lincoln was  sufficient to lay the basis of a sort of social order. Early in the  year 1780 three hundred \"large family boats\" arrived at the Falls of  the Ohio, where the land had been surveyed by Captain Bullitt seven  years before, and in May the Legislature of Virginia passed a law for  the incorporation of the town of Louisville, then containing some six  hundred inhabitants. At the same session a law was passed confiscating  the property of certain British subjects for the endowment of an  institution of learning in Kentucky, \"it being the interest of this  commonwealth,\" to quote the language of the philosophic Legislature,  \"always to encourage and promote every design which may tend to the  improvement of the mind and the diffusion of useful knowledge even  among its remote citizens, whose situation in a barbarous neighborhood  and a savage intercourse might otherwise render them unfriendly to  science.\" This was the origin of the Transylvania University of  Lexington, which rose and flourished for many years on the utmost  verge of civilization.
