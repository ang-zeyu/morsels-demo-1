After this, the king called himself the Lord of the Land of Ten Eyck,  and ever after this was his family name, which all his descendants bore.  Whenever the princess showed bad temper, she was forced to wear the  wooden petticoat. To have the boys and girls point at her and make fun  of her was severe punishment.    But a curious thing took place. It was found that every time the maid  combed the hair of the princess she became gentler and more sweet  tempered. She often thanked her governess and said she liked to have her  curls smoothed with the new comb. She even begged her father to let her  own one and have the comb all to herself. It was not long before she  surprised her governess and her parents by combing and curling her own  hair. In truth, such a wonderful change came over the princess that she  did not often have to wear the wooden petticoat, and after a year or  two, not at all. So the gossips nearly forgot all about it.    One summer's day, as the princess was walking in the open, sunny space,  where the old oak had stood, she saw a blue flower. It seemed as  beautiful as it was strange. She plucked it and put it in her hair. When  she reached home, her old aunt, who had been in southern lands, declared  it to be the flower of the flax.    During that spring, millions of tiny green blades sprang up where the  forest had been, and when summer came, the plants were half a yard high.  The women learned how to put the stalks in water and rot the coarse,  outer fibre of the flax. Then they took the silk-like strands from the  inside and spun them on their spinning-wheels. Then they wove them into  pretty cloth.    This, when laid out on the grass, under the sunshine, was bleached  white. The flax thread was made first into linen, and then into lace.    \"Let us name the place Groen-e'-veld\" (Green Field), the happy people  cried, when they saw how green the earth was where had been the dark  forest. So the place was ever after called the Green Field.    Now when the princess saw what pretty clothes the snow white linen made,  she invented a new style of dress. The upper garment, or \"rok,\" that is,  the one above the waist, she called the \"boven rok\" and the lower one,  beneath the waist, her \"beneden rok.\" In Dutch \"boven\" means above and  \"beneden\" means beneath. By and by, when, at the looms, more of the  beautiful white linen was woven, she had a new petticoat made and put it  on. She was so delighted with this one that she wanted more. One after  the other, she belted them around her waist, until she had on twenty  petticoats at a time. Proud she was of her skirts, even though they made  her look like a barrel. When her mother, and maids, and all the women of  Groen-Ã©-veld, young and old, saw the princess set the fashion, they all  followed. It was not always easy for poor girls, who were to be married,  to buy as many as twenty petticoats. But, as it was the fashion, every  bride had to obey the rule. It grew to be the custom to have at least  twenty; for only this number was thought proper.    So, a new rule, even among the men, grew up. A betrothed young man, or  his female relatives assisting him, was accustomed to make a present of  one or more petticoats to his sweetheart to increase her wardrobe.    Thus the fashion prevailed and still holds among the women of the coast.  Fat or thin, tall or short, they pile on the petticoats and swing their  skirts proudly as they walk or go to market, sell their fish, cry \"fresh  herring\" in the streets, or do their knitting at home, or in front of  their houses. In some parts of the country, nothing makes a girl so  happy as to present her with a new petticoat. It is the fashion to have  a figure like a barrel and wear one's clothes so as to look like a small  hogshead.    By and by, the men built a dam to get plenty of water in winter for the  rotting of the flax stalks. The linen industry made the people rich. In  time, a city sprang up, which they called Rotterdam, or the dam where  they rotted the flax.    And, because where had been a forest of oaks, with the pool and rivulet,  there was now a silvery stream flowing gently between verdant meadows,  they made the arms and seal of the city green and white, two of the  former and one of the latter; that is, verdure and silver. To this day,  on the arms and flags of the great city, and on the high smoke-stacks of  the mighty steamers that cross the ocean, from land to land, one sees  the wide, white band between the two broad stripes of green.    [Illustration: ON AND ON THE RAGING FLOOD BORE THEM UNTIL DARK NIGHT CAME  DOWN]          THE CAT AND THE CRADLE      In the early ages, when our far-off ancestors lived in the woods, ate  acorns, slept in caves, and dressed in the skins of wild animals, they  had no horses, cows or cats. Their only pets and helpers were dogs. The  men and the dogs were more like each other than they are now.    However, they knew about bees. So the women gathered honey and from it  they made mead. Not having any sugar, the children enjoyed tasting honey  more than anything else, and it was the only sweet thing they had.    By and by, cows were brought into the country and the Dutch soil being  good for grass, the cows had plenty to eat. When these animals  multiplied, the people drank milk and learned to make cheese and butter.  So the Dutch boys and girls grew fat and healthy.    The oxen were so strong that they could pull logs of wood or draw a  plough. So, little by little, the forests were cut down and grassy  meadows, full of bright colored flowers, took their place. Houses were  built and the people were rich and happy.    Yet there were still many cruel men and bad people in the land.  Sometimes, too, floods came and drowned the cattle and covered the  fields with sand, or salt water. In such times, food was very scarce.  Thus it happened that not all the babies born could live, or every  little child be fed. The baby girls especially were often left to die,  because war was common and only boys, that grew into strong warriors,  were wanted.    It grew to be a custom that families would hold a council and decide  whether the baby should be raised or not. But if any one should give the  infant even a tiny drop of milk, or food of any kind, it was allowed to  live and grow up. If no one gave it milk or honey, it died. No matter  how much a mother might love her baby, she was not allowed to put milk  to its lips, if the grandmother or elders forbade it. The young bride,  coming into her husband's home, always had to obey his mother, for she  was now as a daughter and one of the family. All lived together in one  house, and the grandmother ruled all the women and girls that were under  one roof.    This was the way of the world, when our ancestors were pagans, and not  always as kind to little babies as our own mothers and fathers are now.  Many times was the old grandmother angry, when her son had taken a wife  and a girl was born. If the old woman expected a grandson, who should  grow up and be a fighter, with sword and spear, and it turned out to be  a girl, she was mad as fire. Often the pretty bride, brought into the  house, had a hard time of it, with her husband's mother, if she did not  in time have a baby boy. In those days a \"Herman,\" a \"War Man\" and  \"German\" were one and the same word.    Now when the good missionaries came into Friesland, one of the first of  the families to receive the gospel was one named Altfrid. With his  bride, who also became a Christian, Altfrid helped the missionary to  build a church. By and by, a sweet little baby was born in the family  and the parents were very happy. They loved the little thing sent from  God, as fathers and mothers love their children now.    But when some one went and told the pagan grandmother that the new baby  was a girl instead of a boy, the old woman flew into a rage and would  have gone at once to get hold of the baby and put it to death. Her  lameness, however, made her move slowly, and she could not find her  crutch; for the midwife, who knew the bad temper of the grandmother, had  purposely hid it. The old woman was angry, because she did not want any  more females in the big house, where she thought there were already too  many mouths to fill. Food was hard to get, and there were not enough war  men to defend the tribe. She meant to get the new baby and throw it to  the wolves. The old grandmother was a pagan and still worshipped the  cruel gods that loved fighting. She hated the new religion, because it  taught gentleness and peace.    But the midwife, who was a neighbor, feared that the old woman was  malicious and she had hid her crutch. This she did, so that if the baby  was a girl, she could save its life. The midwife was a good woman, who  had been taught that the Great Creator loves little girls as well as  boys.    So when the midwife heard the grandmother storm and rave, while hunting  for her crutch, she ran first to the honey jar, dipped her forefinger in  it and put some drops of honey on the baby's tongue. Then she passed it  out the window to some women friends, who were waiting outside. She knew  the law, that if a child tasted food, it must be allowed to live.    The kind women took the baby to their home and fed it carefully. A hole  was drilled in the small end of a cow's horn and the warm milk, fresh  from the cow, was allowed to fall, drop by drop, into the baby's mouth.  In a few days the little one was able to suck its breakfast slowly out  of the horn, while one of the girls held it. So the baby grew bigger  every day. All the time it was carefully hidden.    The foolish old grandmother was foiled, for she could never find out  where the baby girl was, which all the time was growing strong and  plump. Her father secretly made her a cradle and he and the babe's  mother came often to see their child.

(#4)"],[1," at  tidewater, when they moved to the Gila, along which they trapped until  they reached the mouth of the San Pedro. They were in sore need of  horses with which to transport their furs and peltries, that had become  numerous and bulky. While in this neighborhood, they discovered a large  herd of horses and mules in the possession of a few Indians. According  to the morality of the border this property was legitimate prey, but in  point of fact when the trappers determined to take the animals from the  aborigines, they became thieves and robbers. However, it is not to be  hoped that a single member of the company felt the slightest twinge of  conscience when he rode at full speed, yelling to the highest bent, and  helped scatter the terrified red men to the winds. The entire herd fell  into the hands of the whites, and, congratulating themselves on their  good fortune, they kindled a huge fire and encamped for the night.    Most of the men had lain down with the intention of sleeping until  morning, and Kit sat looking in the fire, when his trained ear caught  a peculiar sound. At first, it seemed to be the faint roll of distant  thunder, but he knew it was not. He listened carefully and was able  to tell the direction whence came the singular noise, but remained  uncertain as to its cause. Then, as he had done many a time, he leaned  over and pressed his ear to the solid earth. Immediately the rumbling  became more distinct and he recognized what it meant: it was the tramp  of numerous hoofs galloping forward.    Carson and several of his men stole noiselessly out to reconnaissance  and found a half dozen warriors hurrying along a drove of more than a  hundred horses. They had been on a raid among the Mexican settlements in  Sonora and were now returning home with their plunder.    The temptation was one which Carson and his companions could not resist.  They sent a volley from their rifles among the thieves, which threw them  into such a panic that they dashed off at full speed without giving  the least thought to their valuable property. The latter as a matter  of course was taken charge of by the trappers, who were glad of the  opportunity to chastise the cowardly marauders.    Under the circumstances, however, the animals were of little value  to the hunters, who had all they needed. It was beyond their power to  return them to their owners, but the best were selected, several of the  plumpest killed and cured, and the rest turned loose to go whither they  chose.    The trappers continued up the Gila until near the copper mines of New  Mexico, where they found a party of white men trading with the Indians.  The peltries were cached and placed in charge of their friends, while  Carson and his companions continued on until they reached Santa Fe.  There their employer bought a license to trade with the Indians who  lived near the copper mines. Then they went back and procuring their  furs, returned once more to Santa Fe, where they were sold for more than  twenty thousand dollars. This being equitably divided among the hunters,  furnished each a goodly sum. Like so many sailors just ashore from a  long voyage, most of the trappers went on a prolonged carousal, which  caused their money to melt like snow in the sun. When their pockets were  empty, they had aching heads, weak frames and only the memory of their  feverish pleasures.    Kit Carson did not go through this trial unscathed. He drank and spreed  with the rest, but he awoke to the folly and madness of his course  sooner than they and the sad lesson learned at the time lasted him  through life. The baneful habit was not fastened upon him, and he not  only acquired the mastery over self, but was able more than once to  save others from falling into the whirlpool which has swept unnumbered  multitudes to wretchedness and death.    Carson found little in the way of congenial employment until the fall of  the year, when he joined a second trapping expedition. The first had won  him such a reputation for sagacity, daring and skill, that his services  were always in demand, and those who were forming such enterprises  sought him out among the very first.    The new party was in charge of an experienced mountaineer, who told  Kit his intention was to trap along the principal streams of the Rocky  Mountains. He was well acquainted with the region and was confident that  the expedition would not only be enjoyable and thrilling in the highest  degree, but would prove profitable to all.    The party travelled northward until they reached the Platte River where  the business began. They moved from stream to stream, as necessity  demanded, shooting such game as they needed, exchanging shots with the  watchful red men, who killed four of the trappers while hunting bison,  and steadily adding to their stock of furs until the close of the season  in the spring of 1831. Learning that an old mountaineer, named Captain  Gaunt, had spent the winter at Laramie River and was then at New Park,  Kit Carson and four of his friends set out to join him. It was a long  and perilous journey, but they made it in safety and the Captain gave  them glad welcome. They hunted together for many months following until  the Captain went to Taos to sell his peltries. On his return, operations  were resumed until the weather became so cold they were forced into  winter quarters.    The winter proved very severe. The snow was so deep that only by cutting  down numerous cottonwoods and using the bark and twigs for fodder were  the animals saved from starvation. Fortunately, they had laid in a  good stock of bison meat so that the trappers themselves underwent no  suffering for food. In fact, they found little to do except to pass the  time in idleness. With abundant food, plenty of tobacco and the means  of engaging in certain games, they whiled away the long winter days and  evenings until the signs of spring appeared.    But while the winds were moaning around their hut, in which they made  their home, and the snow rattled like fine sand against the logs, they  were taught again that no weather is severe enough to keep the wily red  man within his wigwam. A party of Crow Indians discovered the camp of  the trappers and one tempestuous night made them a stealthy visit. They  departed during the darkness, and, when they went away, took with them  nine of the very best horses of the hunters--a loss too serious to be  borne without using every recourse to prevent it.        CHAPTER V.       Kit Carson's Decision--A Hot Pursuit an and Unexpected Discovery--Weary   Waiting--A Snow Balling Party--A Daring Attack--Brilliant Exploit.    Instinctively every one turned to Carson to learn what he had to advise  and yet each was certain what he would say.    \"It'll never do, boys, to let them steal our horses in that style,\"  he remarked in his quiet fashion, compressing his lips and shaking his  head, while his eyes flashed with a dangerous light.    All knew what his words and manner meant, and in a twinkling the  thirteen men were in their saddles, and, with their gallant leader at  their head, galloped forth off in pursuit.    It would be supposed where the ground was covered with snow to such a  depth, that it was the easiest matter imaginable to follow the trail,  and yet Kit and his companions found it one of the most difficult tasks  they had ever undertaken. Hundreds of bison had repeatedly crossed the  tracks since they were made and less experienced eyes than those of the  trappers would have given over the search in despair.    But no one thought of turning back, and the pursuit was pushed  unflaggingly for fully forty miles. Not the first glimpse had been  obtained of the Indians, and the horses that had been pushed so hard  finally gave out. They were in poor condition, and, when the company  came to a halt, showed such exhaustion that it was evident they could  not be forced much further. It was decided, therefore, to go into camp.  Accordingly, they turned the heads of their panting animals toward a  piece of woods a short distance away.    Before the shelter was reached, the trappers were astonished to observe  a column of smoke rising above the trees. They looked in each others'  faces with a smile of gratification: inasmuch as the trail led into the  grove and it was evident a camp fire was burning there, it followed  that they were close to the thieves whom they had followed such a long  distance.    The discovery infused new warmth into the blood of the hunters, who were  fairly atremble with eagerness to attack the unsuspecting Indians.    But all were too experienced in the ways of the wilderness to allow  their impatience to betray them into any indiscretion. They deemed  it necessary their assault should be a surprise and they, therefore,  withdrew to a secluded place in the woods and waited for night.    This was trying to a painful degree. The weather which had been bitterly  cold during the day, grew still colder, until the animals shivered as if  with the ague. They were carefully tied where the trees partly sheltered  them from the cutting wind and the hunters made sure their arms were  ready. Then, when the sun went down and darkness crept over the snowy  landscape, the men moved around so as to approach the camp from the  direction opposite to that from which the Indians would naturally look  for pursuit.    When close enough to catch sight of the flames among the trees, the  hunters sank on their knees and crept noiselessly forward until able to  gain a full view of the dusky thieves. They were surprised at what they  saw. The savages had thrown some logs and stones together so as to make  a couple of rude forts and had divided themselves into two parties. It  was characteristic of them that they were holding a dance and feast in  honor of the brilliant style in which they had outwitted the trappers  forty miles away.    The scene was quite interesting, especially"]]]
