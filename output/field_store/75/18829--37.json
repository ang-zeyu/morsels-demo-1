He  was now tremendously mature of aspect, and his height, having reached  the normal adult limit, seemed inclined to wax beyond that figure. In  1925, when a scholarly correspondent from Miskatonic University called  upon him one day and departed pale and puzzled, he was fully six and  three-quarters feet tall.    Through all the years Wilbur had treated his half-deformed albino  mother with a growing contempt, finally forbidding her to go to the  hills with him on May Eve and Hallowmass; and in 1926 the poor creature  complained to Mamie Bishop of being afraid of him.    \"They's more abaout him as I knows than I kin tell ye, Mamie,\" she  said, \"an' naowadays they's more nor what I know myself. I vaow afur  Gawd, I dun't know what he wants nor what he's a-tryin' to dew.\"    That Hallowe'en the hill noises sounded louder than ever, and fire  burned on Sentinel Hill as usual, but people paid more attention  to the rhythmical screaming of vast flocks of unnaturally belated  whippoorwills which seemed to be assembled near the unlighted Whateley  farmhouse. After midnight their shrill notes burst into a kind of  pandemoniac cachinnation which filled all the countryside, and not  until dawn did they finally quiet down. Then they vanished, hurrying  southward where they were fully a month overdue. What this meant, no  one could quite be certain till later. None of the countryfolk seemed  to have died--but poor Lavinia Whateley, the twisted albino, was never  seen again.    In the summer of 1927 Wilbur repaired two sheds in the farmyard and  began moving his books and effects out to them. Soon afterward Earl  Sawyer told the loungers at Osborn's that more carpentry was going on  in the Whateley farmhouse. Wilbur was closing all the doors and windows  on the ground floor, and seemed to be taking out partitions as he and  his grandfather had done upstairs four years before. He was living  in one of the sheds, and Sawyer thought he seemed unusually worried  and tremulous. People generally suspected him of knowing something  about his mother's disappearance, and very few ever approached his  neighborhood now. His height had increased to more than seven feet, and  showed no signs of ceasing its development.      5    The following winter brought an event no less strange than Wilbur's  first trip outside the Dunwich region. Correspondence with the Widener  Library at Harvard, the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris, the British  Museum, the University of Buenos Aires, and the Library of Miskatonic  University at Arkham had failed to get him the loan of a book he  desperately wanted; so at length he set out in person, shabby, dirty,  bearded, and uncouth of dialect, to consult the copy at Miskatonic,  which was the nearest to him geographically. Almost eight feet tall,  and carrying a cheap new valise from Osborn's general store, this  dark and goatish gargoyle appeared one day in Arkham in quest of the  dreaded volume kept under lock and key at the college library--the  hideous _Necronomicon_ of the mad Arab Alhazred in Olaus Wormius' Latin  version, as printed in Spain in the Seventeenth Century. He had never  seen a city before, but had no thought save to find his way to the  university grounds; where, indeed, he passed heedlessly by the great  white-fanged watchdog that barked with unnatural fury and enmity, and  tugged frantically at its stout chain.    Wilbur had with him the priceless but imperfect copy of Dr. Dee's  English version which his grandfather had bequeathed him, and upon  receiving access to the Latin copy he at once began to collate the two  texts with the aim of discovering a certain passage which would have  come on the 751st page of his own defective volume. This much he could  not civilly refrain from telling the librarian--the same erudite Henry  Armitage (A. M. Miskatonic, Ph. D. Princeton, Litt. D. Johns Hopkins)  who had once called at the farm, and who now politely plied him with  questions. He was looking, he had to admit, for a kind of formula or  incantation containing the frightful name _Yog-Sothoth_, and it puzzled  him to find discrepancies, duplications, and ambiguities which made  the matter of determination far from easy. As he copied the formula  he finally chose, Dr. Armitage looked involuntarily over his shoulder  at the open pages; the left-hand one of which, in the Latin version,  contained such monstrous threats to the peace and sanity of the world.        Nor is it to be thought [ran the text as Armitage mentally      translated it] that man is either the oldest or the last of earth's      masters, or that the common bulk of life and substance walks alone.      The Old Ones were, the Old Ones are, and the Old Ones shall be. Not      in the spaces we know, but _between_ them. They walk serene and      primal, undimensioned and to us unseen. _Yog-Sothoth_ knows the      gate. _Yog-Sothoth_ is the gate. _Yog-Sothoth_ is the key and      guardian of the gate. Past, present, future, all are one in      _Yog-Sothoth_. He knows where the Old Ones broke through of old,      and where They shall break through again. He knows where They have      trod earth's fields, and where They still tread them, and why no      one can behold Them as They tread. By Their smell can men sometimes      know Them near, but of Their semblance can no man know, _saving      only in the features of those They have begotten on mankind_; and      of those are there many sorts, differing in likeness from man's      truest eidolon to that shape without sight or substance which is      _They_. They walk unseen and foul in lonely places where the Words      have been spoken and the Rites howled through at their Seasons.      The wind gibbers with Their voices, and the earth mutters with      Their consciousness. They bend the forest and crush the city, yet      may not forest or city behold the hand that smites. Kadath in the      cold waste hath known Them, and what man knows Kadath? The ice      desert of the South and the sunken isles of Ocean hold stones      whereon Their seal is engraven, but who hath seen the deep frozen      city or the sealed tower long garlanded with seaweed and barnacles?      Great Cthulhu is Their cousin, yet can he spy Them only dimly. _IÃ¤      Shub-Niggurath!_ As a foulness shall ye know Them. Their hand is at      your throats, yet ye see Them not; and Their habitation is even one      with your guarded threshold. _Yog-Sothoth_ is the key to the gate,      whereby the spheres meet. Man rules now where They ruled once; They      shall soon rule where man rules now. After summer is winter, and      after winter summer. They wait patient and potent, for here shall      They reign again.    Dr. Armitage, associating what he was reading with what he had heard  of Dunwich and its brooding presences, and of Wilbur Whateley and his  dim, hideous aura that stretched from a dubious birth to a cloud of  probable matricide, felt a wave of fright as tangible as a draft of the  tomb's cold clamminess. The bent, goatish giant before him seemed like  the spawn of another planet or dimension; like something only partly of  mankind, and linked to black gulfs of essence and entity that stretch  like titan fantasms beyond all spheres of force and matter, space and  time.    Presently Wilbur raised his head and began speaking in that strange,  resonant fashion which hinted at sound-producing organs unlike the run  of mankind's.    \"Mr. Armitage,\" he said, \"I calc'late I've got to take that book home.  They's things in it I've got to try under sarten conditions that I  can't git here, an' it 'ud be a mortal sin to let a red-tape rule hold  me up. Let me take it along, sir, an' I'll swar they wun't nobody know  the difference. I dun't need to tell ye I'll take good keer of it. It  wa'n't me that put this Dee copy in the shape it is....\"    He stopped as he saw firm denial on the librarian's face, and his own  goatish features grew crafty. Armitage, half ready to tell him he might  make a copy of what parts he needed, thought suddenly of the possible  consequences and checked himself. There was too much responsibility  in giving such a being the key to such blasphemous outer spheres.  Whateley saw how things stood, and tried to answer lightly.    \"Wal, all right, ef ye feel that way abaout it. Maybe Harvard wun't be  so fussy as yew be.\" And without saying more he rose and strode out of  the building, stooping at each doorway.    Armitage heard the savage yelping of the great watchdog, and studied  Whateley's gorilla-like lope as he crossed the bit of campus visible  from the window. He thought of the wild tales he had heard, and  recalled the old Sunday stories in the _Advertiser_; these things, and  the lore he had picked up from Dunwich rustics and villagers during  his one visit there. Unseen things not of earth--or at least not of  tri-dimensional earth--rushed fetid and horrible through New England's  glens, and brooded obscenely on the mountain tops. Of this he had  long felt certain. Now he seemed to sense the close presence of some  terrible part of the intruding horror, and to glimpse a hellish advance  in the black dominion of the ancient and once passive nightmare. He  locked away the _Necronomicon_ with a shudder of disgust, but the room  still reeked with an unholy and unidentifiable stench. \"As a foulness  shall ye know them,\" he quoted. Yes--the odor was the same as that  which had sickened him at the Whateley farmhouse less than three years  before. He thought of Wilbur, goatish and ominous, once again, and  laughed mockingly at the village rumors of his parentage.    \"Inbreeding?\" Armitage muttered half aloud to himself. \"Great God, what  simpletons!

Away to the north  rose the peak that was their only guiding mark. They headed toward it,  carrying a shovel and part of their packs.    At noon the peak vanished in the shimmering glare of the desert. The  prospectors pushed on, guided by the sun.  In every wash they tried for  water.  With the forked peach branch in his hands Warren always  succeeded in locating water.  They dug, but it lay too deep.  At  length, spent and sore, they fell and slept through that night and part  of the next day.  Then they succeeded in getting water, and quenched  their thirst, and filled the canteens, and cooked a meal.    The burning day found them in an interminably wide plain, where there  was no shelter from the fierce sun. The men were exceedingly careful  with their water, though there was absolute necessity of drinking a  little every hour.  Late in the afternoon they came to a canyon that  they believed was the lower end of the one in which they had last found  water.  For hours they traveled toward its head, and, long after night  had set, found what they sought. Yielding to exhaustion, they slept,  and next day were loath to leave the waterhole.  Cool night spurred  them on with canteens full and renewed strength.    Morning told Cameron that they had turned back miles into the desert,  and it was desert new to him.  The red sun, the increasing heat, and  especially the variety and large size of the cactus plants warned  Cameron that he had descended to a lower level.  Mountain peaks loomed  on all sides, some near, others distant; and one, a blue spur,  splitting the glaring sky far to the north, Cameron thought he  recognized as a landmark.  The ascent toward it was heartbreaking, not  in steepness, but in its league-and-league-long monotonous rise.  Cameron knew there was only one hope--to make the water hold out and  never stop to rest.  Warren began to weaken. Often he had to halt.  The  burning white day passed, and likewise the night, with its white stars  shining so pitilessly cold and bright.    Cameron measured the water in his canteen by its weight.  Evaporation  by heat consumed as much as he drank.  During one of the rests, when he  had wetted his parched mouth and throat, he found opportunity to pour a  little water from his canteen into Warren's.    At first Cameron had curbed his restless activity to accommodate the  pace of his elder comrade.  But now he felt that he was losing  something of his instinctive and passionate zeal to get out of the  desert.  The thought of water came to occupy his mind.  He began to  imagine that his last little store of water did not appreciably  diminish.  He knew he was not quite right in his mind regarding water;  nevertheless, he felt this to be more of fact than fancy, and he began  to ponder.    When next they rested he pretended to be in a kind of stupor; but he  covertly watched Warren.  The man appeared far gone, yet he had  cunning.  He cautiously took up Cameron's canteen and poured water into  it from his own.    This troubled Cameron.  The old irritation at not being able to thwart  Warren returned to him.  Cameron reflected, and concluded that he had  been unwise not to expect this very thing.  Then, as his comrade  dropped into weary rest, he lifted both canteens.  If there were any  water in Warren's, it was only very little.  Both men had been enduring  the terrible desert thirst, concealing it, each giving his water to the  other, and the sacrifice had been useless.    Instead of ministering to the parched throats of one or both, the water  had evaporated.  When Cameron made sure of this, he took one more  drink, the last, and poured the little water left into Warren's  canteen.  He threw his own away.    Soon afterward Warren discovered the loss.    \"Where's your canteen?\" he asked.    \"The heat was getting my water, so I drank what was left.\"    \"My son!\" said Warren.    The day opened for them in a red and green hell of rock and cactus.  Like a flame the sun scorched and peeled their faces.  Warren went  blind from the glare, and Cameron had to lead him.  At last Warren  plunged down, exhausted, in the shade of a ledge.    Cameron rested and waited, hopeless, with hot, weary eyes gazing down  from the height where he sat.  The ledge was the top step of a ragged  gigantic stairway.  Below stretched a sad, austere, and lonely valley.  A dim, wide streak, lighter than the bordering gray, wound down the  valley floor.  Once a river had flowed there, leaving only a forlorn  trace down the winding floor of this forlorn valley.    Movement on the part of Warren attracted Cameron's attention. Evidently  the old prospector had recovered his sight and some of his strength,  for he had arisen, and now began to walk along the arroyo bed with his  forked peach branch held before him.  He had clung to the precious bit  of wood.  Cameron considered the prospect for water hopeless, because  he saw that the arroyo had once been a canyon, and had been filled with  sands by desert winds.  Warren, however, stopped in a deep pit, and,  cutting his canteen in half, began to use one side of it as a scoop.  He scooped out a wide hollow, so wide that Cameron was certain he had  gone crazy.  Cameron gently urged him to stop, and then forcibly tried  to make him. But these efforts were futile.  Warren worked with slow,  ceaseless, methodical movement.  He toiled for what seemed hours.  Cameron, seeing the darkening, dampening sand, realized a wonderful  possibility of water, and he plunged into the pit with the other half  of the canteen.  Then both men toiled, round and round the wide hole,  down deeper and deeper.  The sand grew moist, then wet.  At the bottom  of the deep pit the sand coarsened, gave place to gravel. Finally water  welled in, a stronger volume than Cameron ever remembered finding on  the desert.  It would soon fill the hole and run over.  He marveled at  the circumstance.  The time was near the end of the dry season.  Perhaps an underground stream flowed from the range behind down to the  valley floor, and at this point came near to the surface.  Cameron had  heard of such desert miracles.    The finding of water revived Cameron's flagging hopes.  But they were  short-lived.  Warren had spend himself utterly.    \"I'm done.  Don't linger,\" he whispered.  \"My son, go--go!\"    Then he fell.  Cameron dragged him out of the sand pit to a sheltered  place under the ledge.  While sitting beside the failing man Cameron  discovered painted images on the wall.  Often in the desert he had  found these evidences of a prehistoric people.  Then, from long habit,  he picked up a piece of rock and examined it. Its weight made him  closely scrutinize it.  The color was a peculiar black.  He scraped  through the black rust to find a piece of gold.  Around him lay  scattered heaps of black pebbles and bits of black, weathered rock and  pieces of broken ledge, and they showed gold.    \"Warren!  Look!  See it!  Feel it!  Gold!\"    But Warren had never cared, and now he was too blind to see.    \"Go--go!\" he whispered.    Cameron gazed down the gray reaches of the forlorn valley, and  something within him that was neither intelligence nor  emotion--something inscrutably strange--impelled him to promise.    Then Cameron built up stone monuments to mark his gold strike.  That  done, he tarried beside the unconscious Warren.  Moments passed--grew  into hours.  Cameron still had strength left to make an effort to get  out of the desert.  But that same inscrutable something which had  ordered his strange involuntary promise to Warren held him beside his  fallen comrade.  He watched the white sun turn to gold, and then to red  and sink behind mountains in the west.  Twilight stole into the arroyo.  It lingered, slowly turning to gloom. The vault of blue black lightened  to the blinking of stars. Then fell the serene, silent, luminous desert  night.    Cameron kept his vigil.  As the long hours wore on he felt creep over  him the comforting sense that he need not forever fight sleep. A wan  glow flared behind the dark, uneven horizon, and a melancholy misshapen  moon rose to make the white night one of shadows.  Absolute silence  claimed the desert.  It was mute.  Then that inscrutable something  breathed to him, telling him when he was alone.  He need not have  looked at the dark, still face beside him.    Another face haunted Cameron's--a woman's face.  It was there in the  white moonlit shadows; it drifted in the darkness beyond; it softened,  changed to that of a young girl, sweet, with the same dark, haunting  eyes of her mother.  Cameron prayed to that nameless thing within him,  the spirit of something deep and mystical as life.  He prayed to that  nameless thing outside, of which the rocks and the sand, the spiked  cactus and the ragged lava, the endless waste, with its vast star-fired  mantle, were but atoms.  He prayed for mercy to a woman--for happiness  to her child.  Both mother and daughter were close to him then.  Time  and distance were annihilated. He had faith--he saw into the future.  The fateful threads of the past, so inextricably woven with his error,  wound out their tragic length here in this forlorn desert.    Cameron then took a little tin box from his pocket, and, opening it,  removed a folded certificate.  He had kept a pen, and now he wrote  something upon the paper, and in lieu of ink he wrote with blood.  The  moon afforded him enough light to see; and, having replaced the paper,  he laid the little box upon a shelf of rock. It would remain there  unaffected by dust, moisture, heat, time. How long had those painted  images been there clear and sharp on the dry stone walls?  There were  no trails in that desert, and always there were incalculable changes.  Cameron saw this mutable mood of nature--the sands would fly and seep  and carve and bury; the floods would dig and cut; the ledges would  weather in the heat and rain; the "]]]
