And the baby crowed, and seized Phronsie's floating yellow hair with  both hands, and they all got in one another's way to rescue it; and Mrs.  Pepper hurried in again, this time for Baby; and he was kissed all  around, Phronsie giving him two for fear he might think she was hurt;  and one of the maids popped in with \"There is a gentleman in the  reception room to see Miss Mary.\"    Jasper turned off with an impatient gesture.    \"I do suppose it is Mr. Loughead,\" said Polly, \"for he wanted to come  some time and talk about Amy. O, dear! I hope I shall say the right  thing.\"    \"Doesn't the fellow know better than to come when we are home for the  Christmas holidays?\" grumbled Joel. Jasper looked as if he could say as  much, but instead, walked to the window, and looked out silently.    \"He's very anxious about Amy,\" said Polly, running off to the door,  where she paused and looked back for sympathy toward her little  protege.    \"I should think he would be,\" grunted Joel; \"she's a goose, and beside  that, she doesn't know anything.\"    \"O, Joe! she hasn't any father nor mother,\" cried Polly in distress.    Joel gave an inaudible reply, and Polly ran off, carrying a face on  which the sunshine struggled to get back to its accustomed place.    \"Beg pardon for troubling you,\" said a tall young man, getting off from  the divan to meet her, as she hurried into the reception room, \"but you  were good enough to say that I might talk with you about my sister, and  really I am very much at sea to know what to do with her, Miss Pepper.\"    It was a long speech, and at the end of it, Polly and the caller were  seated, she in a big chair, and he back on the divan opposite to her.    \"I am glad to see you, Mr. Loughead,\" said Polly brightly, \"and I hope I  can help you, for I am very fond of Amy.\"    \"It's good of you to say so,\" said Jack Loughead, \"for she's a trying  little minx enough, I suspect; and Miss Salisbury tells me you've had no  end of trouble with her.\"    \"Miss Salisbury shouldn't say that,\" cried Polly involuntarily. Then she  stopped with a blush. \"I mean, I don't think she quite understands it.  Amy does really try hard to study.\"    \"Oh!\" said Jack Loughead. Then he tapped his boot with his  walking-stick.    \"So you really think my sister will amount to something, Miss Pepper?\"  He looked at her keenly.    Polly started. \"Oh, yes, indeed! Why, she must, Mr. Loughead.\"    He laughed, and bit his moustache.    \"And really, I don't think that Amy is quite understood,\" said Polly  warmly, and forgetting herself; \"if people believe in her, it makes her  want to do things to please them.\"    \"She says herself she has bothered you dreadfully,\" said Jack, with a  vicious thrust of the walking-stick at his boot.    \"She has a little,\" confessed Polly, \"but not dreadfully. And I do  think, Mr. Loughead, now that you have come, and that she sees how much  you want her to study and practice, she will really do better. I do,  indeed,\" said Polly earnestly.    Outside she could hear the \"two boys,\" as she still called them, and  Grandpapa's voice in animated consultation over the ways and means, she  knew as well as if she were there, of spending the holidays, and it  seemed as if she could never sit in the reception room another moment  longer, but that she must fly out to them.    [Illustration: \"OH!\" SAID JACK LOUGHEAD. THEN HE TAPPED HIS BOOT WITH  HIS WALKING STICK.]    \"Amy has no mother,\" said Jack Loughead after a moment, and he turned  away his head, and pretended to look out of the window.    \"I know it.\" Polly's heart leaped guiltily. Oh! how could she think of  holidays and good times, while this poor little girl, but fifteen, had  only a dreary sense of boarding-school life to mean home to her. \"And  oh! I do think,\" Polly hastened to say, and she clasped her hands as  Phronsie would have done, \"it has made all the difference in the world  to her. And she does just lovely--so much better, I mean, than other  girls would in her place. I do really, Mr. Loughead,\" repeated Polly.    \"And no sister,\" added Jack, as if to himself. \"How is a fellow like  me--why, I am twenty-five, Miss Pepper, and I've been knocking about the  world ever since I was her age; my uncle took me then to Australia, into  his business--how am I ever to 'understand,' as you call it, that girl?\"    It was impossible not to see his distress, and Polly, with a deaf ear to  the chatter out in the library, now bent all her energies to helping  him.    \"Mr. Loughead,\" she said, and the color deserted her round cheek, and  she leaned forward from the depths of the big chair, \"I am afraid you  won't like what I am going to say.\"    \"Go on, please,\" said Jack, his eyes on her face.    \"I think if you want to understand Amy,\" said Polly, holding her hands  very tightly together, to keep her courage up, \"you must love her  first.\"    \"Hey? I don't understand,\" said Jack, quite bewildered.    \"You must love her, and believe she's going to do nice things, and be  proud of her,\" went on Polly steadily.    \"How can I? She's such a little beggar,\" exclaimed Jack, \"won't study,  and all that.\"    \"And you must make her the very best friend you have in all this world,  and let her see that you are glad that she is your sister, and tell her  things, and never, never scold.\" Then Polly stopped, and the color flew  up to the waves of brown hair on her brow.    \"I wish you'd go on,\" said Jack Loughead, as she paused.    \"Oh! I've said enough,\" said Polly, with a gasp, and beginning to wish  she could be anywhere out of the range of those great black eyes. \"Do  forgive me,\" she begged; \"I didn't mean to say anything to hurt you.\"    Jack Loughead got up and straightened himself. \"I'm much obliged to you,  Miss Pepper,\" he said. \"I think I'm more to blame than Amy, poor child.\"    \"No, no,\" cried Polly, getting out of her chair, \"I didn't mean so,  indeed I didn't, Mr. Loughead. Oh! what have I said? I think you have  done beautifully. How could you help things when you were not here? Oh!  Mr. Loughead, I do hope you will forgive me. I have only made matters  worse, I'm afraid,\" and poor Polly's face drooped.    Jack Loughead turned with a sudden gesture. \"Perhaps you'll believe me  when I say I've never had anything do me so much good in all my life, as  what you said.\"    \"What are those two talking about all this unconscionable time,\" Joel  was now exclaiming in the library, as he glanced up at the clock. \"I  could finish that Amy Loughead in the sixteenth of a minute.\"    Old Mr. King turned uneasily in his chair. \"Who is this young Loughead?\"  he asked of Jasper.    Jasper, seeing that an answer was expected of him, drew himself up, and  said quickly, \"Oh! he's the brother of that girl at the Salisbury  School, father. You know Polly goes over there to help her practice.\"    \"Ah!\" said his father, \"well, what is he doing here this morning, pray  tell?\"    \"That's what I should like to know,\" chimed in Joel.    \"Well, last evening,\" said Jasper, with an effort to make things right  for Polly, \"he was there when they were playing, and he seemed quite put  out at his sister.\"    \"Don't wonder,\" said Joel; \"everybody says she's a silly.\"    \"And Polly tried to help Amy, and make the best of her. And the brother  asked if he might have a talk some time about his sister. Polly couldn't  help telling him 'yes,'\" said Jasper, but with a pang at the handsome  stranger's delight as she said it.    \"A bad business,\" said the old gentleman irritably. \"We do not want your  Lougheads coming here and taking up our time.\"    \"Of course not,\" declared Joel.    \"And I suppose he is an idle creature. Polly said something about his  traveling a good deal. It's a very bad business,\" repeated Mr. King.    \"Oh! he's all right in a business way,\" said Jasper, feeling angry  enough at himself that he was sorry at Jack Loughead's success. \"He has  to travel; he's a member of the Bradbury and Graeme Company.\"    \"The Sydney, Australia, house?\" asked Mr. King in a surprised tone. \"So  you've looked him up, have you, Jasper?\"    \"Oh! I happened to run across Hibbard Crane yesterday,\" said Jasper  carelessly, \"and he gave me a few facts. That's about all I know,  father.\"    And in came Polly, looking like a rose; and following her a tall young  man, with large, black eyes, whom she immediately led up to Mr. King's  chair. \"Grandpapa,\" she said, \"this is Mr. Loughead, Amy's brother, you  know\"--    And Jasper went forward and put out his hand, as an old acquaintance of  the evening before, and Joel was introduced, and mumbled something about  \"Glad to know you,\" immediately retreating into the corner, and then  there was a pause, which Polly broke by crying: \"O, Grandpapa! I am  going to ask Amy to play at Dunraven for Phronsie's poor children. Why,  where is Phronsie?\" looking around the room.    \"Oh! she went out a little while after Baby's exit,\" said Jasper, trying  to speak lightly.    \"Mr. Loughead thinks she'd do it, if I asked her,\" Polly went on in her  brightest way. \"Now, that will be lovely, and the children will enjoy it  so much.\"    \"Isn't there anything I could do?\" asked Jack Loughead, after the  Dunraven entertainment had been a bit discussed.    Mr. King bowed his courtly old head. \"I don't believe there is anything.  You are very kind, I'm sure.\"    \"Don't speak of kindness, sir,\" he said. \"My time hangs heavy on my  hands just now.\"    \"He would like to be with his sister,\" said Jasper, after a glance at  Polly's face, and guilty of an aside to his father.    \"Oh!--yes,\" said Mr. King, \"to be sure. Well, Mr. Loughead, and what  would you like "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7499"],[0,"Through Five Republics on Horseback, Being an Account of Many Wanderings in (#4)"],[1,"patron saint to bless you. If you fail to assist him, the curses  of all the saints in heaven will fall on your impious head. This often  causes such a shudder in the recipient that I have known him to turn  back to appease the wrath of the mendicant, and receive instead--a  blessing.    It is not an uncommon sight to see a black-robed priest with his hand  on a boy's head giving him a benediction that he may be enabled to sell  his newspapers or lottery tickets with more celerity.    The National Lottery is a great institution, and hundreds keep  themselves poor buying tickets. In one year the lottery has realized  the sum of $3,409,143.57. The Government takes forty per cent. of this,  and divides the rest between a number of charitable and religious  organizations, all, needless to say, being Roman Catholic. Amongst the  names appear the following: Poor Sisters of St. Joseph, Workshop of Our  Lady, Sisters of St. Anthony, etc.    Little booths for the sale of lottery tickets are erected in the  vestibules of some of the churches, and the Government, in this way,  repays the church.    The gambling passion is one of Argentina's greatest curses. Tickets are  bought by all, from the Senator down to the newsboy who ventures his  only dollar.    You meet the water-seller passing down the street with his barrel cart,  drawn by three or four horses with tinkling bells, dispensing water to  customers at five cents a pail. The poorer classes have no other means  of procuring this precious liquid. The water is kept in a corner of the  house in large sun-baked jars. A peculiarity of these pots is that they  are not made to stand alone, but have to be held up by something.    At early morning and evening the milkman goes his rounds on horseback.  The milk he carries in six long, narrow cans, like inverted  sugar-loaves, three on each side of his raw-hide saddle, he himself  being perched between them on a sheepskin. In some cans he carries pure  cream, which the jolting of his horse soon converts into butter. This  he lifts out with his hands to any who care to buy. After the addition  of a little salt, and the subtraction of a little buttermilk, this  _manteca_ is excellent. After serving you he will again mount his  horse, but not until his hands have been well wiped on its tail, which  almost touches the ground. The other cans of the _lechero_ contain a  mixture known to him alone. I never analyzed it, but have remarked a  chalky substance in the bottom of my glass. He does not profess to sell  pure milk; that you can buy, but, of course, at a higher price, from  the pure milk seller. In the cool of the afternoon he will bring round  his cows, with bells on their necks and calves dragging behind. The  calves are tied to the mothers' tails, and wear a muzzle. At a _sh-h_  from the sidewalk he stops them, and, stooping down, fills your pitcher  according to your money. The cows, through being born and bred to a  life in the streets, are generally miserable-looking beasts. Strange to  add, the one milkman shoes his cows and the other leaves his horse  unshod. It is not customary in this country for man's noble friend to  wear more than his own natural hoof. A visit to the blacksmith is  entertaining. The smith, by means of a short lasso, deftly trips up the  animal, and, with its legs securely lashed, the cow must lie on its  back while he shoes its upturned hoofs.    Many and varied are the scenes. One is struck by the number of horses,  seven and eight often being yoked to one cart, which even then they  sometimes find difficult to draw. Some of the streets are very bad,  worse than our country lanes, and filled with deep ruts and drains,  into which the horses often fall. There the driver will sometimes  cruelly leave them, when, after his arm aches in using the whip, he  finds the animal cannot rise. For the veriest trifle I have known men  to smash the poor dumb brute's eyes out with the stock of the whip, and  I have been very near the Police Station more than once when my  righteous blood compelled me to interfere. Where, oh, where is the  Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals? Surely no suffering  creatures under the sun cry out louder for mercy than those in  Argentina?    As I have said, horses are left to die in the public streets. It has  been my painful duty to pass moaning creatures lying helplessly in the  road, with broken limbs, under a burning sun, suffering hunger and  thirst, for three consecutive days, before kind death, the sufferer's  friend, released them. Looking on such sights, seeing every street  urchin with coarse laugh and brutal jest jump on such an animal's  quivering body, stuff its parched mouth with mud, or poke sticks into  its staring eyes, I have cried aloud at the injustice. The policeman  and the passers-by have only laughed at me for my pains.    In my experiences in South America I found cruelty to be a marked  feature of the people. If the father thrusts his dagger into his enemy,  and the mother, in her fits of rage, sticks her hairpin into her maid's  body, can it be wondered at if the children inherit cruel natures? How  often have I seen a poor horse fall between the shafts of some loaded  cart of bricks or sand! Never once have I seen his harness undone and  willing hands help him up, as in other civilized lands. No, the lashing  of the cruel whip or the knife's point is his only help. If, as some  religious writers have said, the horse will be a sharer of Paradise  along with man, his master, then those from Buenos Ayres will feed in  stalls of silver and have their wounds healed by the clover of eternal  kindness. \"God is Love.\"    I have said the streets are full of holes. In justice to the  authorities I must mention the fact that sometimes, especially at the  crossings, these are filled up. To carry truthfulness still further,  however, I must state that more than once I have known them bridged  over with the putrefying remains of a horse in the last stages of  decomposition. I have seen delicate ladies, attired in Parisian  furbelows, lift their dainty skirts, attempt the crossing--and sink in  a mass of corruption, full of maggots.    In my description of Buenos Ayres I must not omit to mention the large  square, black, open hearses so often seen rapidly drawn through the  streets, the driver seeming to travel as quickly as he can. In the  centre of the coach is the coffin, made of white wood and covered with  black material, fastened on with brass nails. Around this gruesome  object sit the relatives and friends of the departed one on their  journey to the _chacarita_, or cemetery, some six miles out from the  centre of the city. Cemeteries in Spanish America are divided into  three enclosures. There is the \"cemetery of heaven,\" \"the cemetery of  purgatory,\" and \"the cemetery of hell.\" The location of the soul in the  future is thus seen to be dependent on its location by the priests  here. The dead are buried on the day of their death, when possible, or,  if not, then early on the following morning; but never, I believe, on  feast days. Those periods are set apart for pleasure, and on important  saint days banners and flags of all nations are hung across the  streets, or adorn the roofs of the flat-topped houses, where the  washing is at other times dried.    After attending mass in the early morning on these days, the people  give themselves up to revelry and sin at home, or crowd the street-cars  running to the parks and suburbs. Many with departed relatives (and who  has none?) go to the _chacarita_, and for a few _pesos_ bargain with  the black-robed priest waiting there, to deliver their precious dead  out of Purgatory. If he sings the prayer the cost is double, but  supposed to be also doubly efficacious. Mothers do not always inspire  filial respect in their offspring, for one young man declared that he  \"wanted to get his mother out of Purgatory before he went in.\"    A Buenos Ayres missionary writes \"There are two large cemeteries here.  From early morn until late at night the people crowd into them, and I  am told there were 100,000 at one time in one of them. November 1 is a  special day for releasing thousands of souls out of Purgatory. We  printed thousands of tracts and the workers started out to distribute  them. By ten o'clock six of them were in jail, having been given into  custody by a 'holy father.' They were detained until six in the evening  without food, and then were released through the efforts of a Methodist  minister.\"    The catechisn reads: \"Attend mass all Sundays and Feast days. Confess  at least once a year, or oftener, if there is any fear of death. Take  Sacrament at Easter time. Pay a tenth of first-fruits to God's Church.\"  The fourth commandment is condensed into the words: \"Sanctify the Feast  days.\" From this it will be seen that there is great need for mission  work. Of course Romanism in this and other cities is losing its old  grip upon the people, and because of this the priest is putting forth  superhuman effort to retain what he has. _La Voz de la Iglesia_ (\"The  Voice of the Church\"), the organ of the Bishop of Buenos Ayres, has  lately published some of the strongest articles we have ever read. A  late article concludes: \"One thing only, one thing: OBEY; OBEY BLINDLY.  Comply with her (the Church's) commands with faithful loyalty. If we do  this, it is impossible for Protestantism to invade the flowery camp of  the Church, Holy, Catholic, Apostolic and Roman.\"    Articles such as this, however, and the circulation of a tract by one  of the leading church presses, are not calculated to help forward a  losing cause. The tract referred to is entitled, \"Letter of Jesus about  the Drops of Blood which He shed whilst He went to Calvary.\" \"You know  that the soldiers numbered 150, twenty-five of whom conducted me bound.  I received fifty blows on the head and 108 on the breast. I was pulled  by the hair 23"]]]
