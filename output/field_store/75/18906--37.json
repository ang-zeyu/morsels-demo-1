After the waters had forced  a passage to the sea these evil ones sought shelter in the glens and  valleys that open to right and left along its course, but in time of  tempest, when they hear Manitou riding down the ravine on wings of storm,  dashing thunderbolts against the cliffs, it is the fear that he will  recapture them and force them into lightless caverns to expiate their  revolt, that sends them huddling among the rocks and makes the hills  resound with roars and howls.    At the Devil's Dance-Chamber, a slight plateau on the west bank, between  Newburg and Crom Elbow, the red men performed semi-religious rites as a  preface to their hunting and fishing trips or ventures on the war-path.  They built a fire, painted themselves, and in that frenzy into which  savages are so readily lashed, and that is so like to the action of mobs  in trousers, they tumbled, leaped, danced, yelled, sang, grimaced, and  gesticulated until the Manitou disclosed himself, either as a harmless  animal or a beast of prey. If he came in the former shape the augury was  favorable, but if he showed himself as a bear or panther, it was a  warning of evil that they seldom dared to disregard.    The crew of Hudson's ship, the Half Moon, having chanced on one of these  orgies, were so impressed by the fantastic spectacle that they gave the  name Duyvels Dans-Kamer to the spot. Years afterwards, when Stuyvesant  ascended the river, his doughty retainers were horrified, on landing  below the Dans-Kamer, to discover hundreds of painted figures frisking  there in the fire-light. A few surmised that they were but a new  generation of savages holding a powwow, but most of the sailors fancied  that the assemblage was demoniac, and that the figures were spirits of  bad Indians repeating a scalp-dance and revelling in the mysterious  fire-water that they had brought down from the river source in jars and  skins. The spot was at least once profaned with blood, for a young  Dutchman and his wife, of Albany, were captured here by an angry Indian,  and although the young man succeeded in stabbing his captor to death, he  was burned alive on the rock by the friends of the Indian whose wrath he  had provoked. The wife, after being kept in captivity for a time, was  ransomed.          THE CULPRIT FAY    The wood-tick's drum convokes the elves at the noon of night on Cro' Nest  top, and, clambering out of their flower-cup beds and hammocks of cobweb,  they fly to the meeting, not to freak about the grass or banquet at the  mushroom table, but to hear sentence passed on the fay who, forgetting  his vestal vow, has loved an earthly maid. From his throne under a canopy  of tulip petals, borne on pillars of shell, the king commands silence,  and with severe eye but softened voice he tells the culprit that while he  has scorned the royal decree he has saved himself from the extreme  penalty, of imprisonment in walnut shells and cobweb dungeons, by loving  a maid who is gentle and pure. So it shall be enough if he will go down  to the Hudson and seize a drop from the bow of mist that a sturgeon  leaves when he makes his leap; and after, to kindle his darkened  flame-wood lamp at a meteor spark. The fairy bows, and without a word  slowly descends the rocky steep, for his wing is soiled and has lost its  power; but once at the river, he tugs amain at a mussel shell till he has  it afloat; then, leaping in, he paddles out with a strong grass blade  till he comes to the spot where the sturgeon swims, though the  watersprites plague him and toss his boat, and the fish and the leeches  bunt and drag; but, suddenly, the sturgeon shoots from the water, and ere  the arch of mist that he tracks through the air has vanished, the sprite  has caught a drop of the spray in a tiny blossom, and in this he washes  clean his wings.    The water-goblins torment him no longer. They push his boat to the shore,  where, alighting, he kisses his hand, then, even as a bubble, he flies  back to the mountain top, dons his acorn helmet, his corselet of  bee-hide, his shield of lady-bug shell, and grasping his lance, tipped  with wasp sting, he bestrides his fire-fly steed and off he goes like a  flash. The world spreads out and then grows small, but he flies straight  on. The ice-ghosts leer from the topmost clouds, and the mists surge  round, but he shakes his lance and pipes his call, and at last he comes  to the Milky Way, where the sky-sylphs lead him to their queen, who lies  couched in a palace ceiled with stars, its dome held up by northern  lights and the curtains made of the morning's flush. Her mantle is  twilight purple, tied with threads of gold from the eastern dawn, and her  face is as fair as the silver moon.    She begs the fay to stay with her and taste forever the joys of heaven,  but the knightly elf keeps down the beating of his heart, for he  remembers a face on earth that is fairer than hers, and he begs to go.  With a sigh she fits him a car of cloud, with the fire-fly steed chained  on behind, and he hurries away to the northern sky whence the meteor  comes, with roar and whirl, and as it passes it bursts to flame. He  lights his lamp at a glowing spark, then wheels away to the fairy-land.  His king and his brothers hail him stoutly, with song and shout, and  feast and dance, and the revel is kept till the eastern sky has a ruddy  streak. Then the cock crows shrill and the fays are gone.          POKEPSIE    The name of this town has forty-two spellings in old records, and with  singular pertinacity in ill-doing, the inhabitants have fastened on it  the longest and clumsiest of all. It comes from the Mohegan words  Apo-keep-sink, meaning a safe, pleasant harbor. Harbor it might be for  canoes, but for nothing bigger, for it was only the little cove that was  so called between Call Rock and Adder Cliff,--the former indicating where  settlers awaiting passage hailed the masters of vessels from its top, and  the latter taking its name from the snakes that abounded there.    Hither came a band of Delawares with Pequot captives, among them a young  chief to whom had been offered not only life but leadership if he would  renounce his tribe, receive the mark of the turtle on his breast, and  become a Delaware. On his refusal, he was bound to a tree, and was about  to undergo the torture, when a girl among the listeners sprang to his  side. She, too, was a Pequot, but the turtle totem was on her bosom, and  when she begged his life, because they had been betrothed, the captors  paused to talk of it. She had chosen well the time to interfere, for a  band of Hurons was approaching, and even as the talk went on their yell  was heard in the wood. Instant measures for defence were taken, and in  the fight that followed both chief and maiden were forgotten; but though  she cut the cords that bound him, they were separated in the confusion,  he disappearing, she falling captive to the Hurons, who, sated with  blood, retired from the field. In the fantastic disguise of a wizard the  young Pequot entered their camp soon after, and on being asked to try his  enchantments for the cure of a young woman, he entered her tent, showing  no surprise at finding her to be the maiden of his choice, who was  suffering from nothing worse than nerves, due to the excitement of the  battle. Left alone with his patient, he disclosed his identity, and  planned a way of escape that proved effective on that very night, for,  though pursued by the angry Hurons, the couple reached \"safe harbor,\"  thence making a way to their own country in the east, where they were  married.          DUNDERBERG    Dunderberg, \"Thunder Mountain,\" at the southern gate of the Hudson  Highlands, is a wooded eminence, chiefly populated by a crew of imps of  stout circumference, whose leader, the Heer, is a bulbous goblin clad in  the dress worn by Dutch colonists two centuries ago, and carrying a  speaking-trumpet, through which he bawls his orders for the blowing of  winds and the touching off of lightnings. These orders are given in Low  Dutch, and are put into execution by the imps aforesaid, who troop into  the air and tumble about in the mist, sometimes smiting the flag or  topsail of a ship to ribbons, or laying the vessel over before the wind  until she is in peril of going on beam ends. At one time a sloop passing  the Dunderberg had nearly foundered, when the crew discovered the  sugar-loaf hat of the Heer at the mast-head. None dared to climb for it,  and it was not until she had driven past Pollopel's Island--the limit of  the Heer's jurisdiction--that she righted. As she did so the little hat  spun into the air like a top, creating a vortex that drew up the  storm-clouds, and the sloop kept her way prosperously for the rest of the  voyage. The captain had nailed a horse-shoe to the mast. The \"Hat Rogue\"  of the Devil's Bridge in Switzerland must be a relative of this gamesome  sprite, for his mischief is usually of a harmless sort; but, to be on the  safe side, the Dutchmen who plied along the river lowered their peaks in  homage to the keeper of the mountain, and for years this was a common  practice. Mariners who paid this courtesy to the Heer of the Donder Berg  were never molested by his imps, though skipper Ouselsticker, of  Fishkill,--for all he had a parson on board,--was once beset by a heavy  squall, and the goblin came out of the mist and sat astraddle of his  bowsprit, seeming to guide his schooner straight toward the rocks. The  dominie chanted the song of Saint Nicolaus, and the goblin, unable to  endure either its spiritual potency or the worthy parson's singing, shot  upward like a ball and rode off on the gale, carrying with him the  nightcap of the parson's wife, which he hung on the weathercock of Esopus  steeple, forty miles away.

Still she clutched  him tight, and bore him in her arms to the bottom of the lake; he had no  power to use his weapons, though he had courage enough. Water-beasts  swam after him and battered him with their tusks.    Then he saw that he was in a vast hall, where there was no water, but a  strange, unearthly glow of firelight. At once the fight began, but the  sword would not bite--it failed its master in his need; for the first  time its fame broke down. Away Beowulf threw it in anger, trusting to  the strength of his hands. He cared nothing for his own life, for he  thought but of honour.    He seized the witch by the shoulder and swayed her so that she sank on  the pavement. Quickly she recovered, and closed in on him; he staggered  and fell, worn out. She sat on him, and drew her knife to take his life,  but his good mail coat turned the point. He stood up again, and then  truly God helped him, for he saw among the armour on the wall an old  sword of huge size, the handiwork of giants. He seized it, and smote  with all his might, so that the witch gave up her life.    His heart was full of gladness, and light, calm and beautiful as that of  the sun, filled the hall. He scanned the vast chamber, and saw Grendel  lying there dead. He cut off his head as a trophy for King Hrothgar,  whose men the fiend had killed and devoured.    Now those men who were seated on the banks of the pool watching with  Hrothgar saw that the water was tinged with blood. Then the old men  spoke together of the brave Beowulf, saying they feared they would never  see him again. The day was waning fast, so they and the King went  homeward. Beowulf's men stayed on, sick at heart, gazing at the pool.  They longed, but did not expect, to see their lord and master.    Under the depths, Beowulf was making his way to them. The magic sword  melted in his hand, like snow in sunshine; only the hilt remained, so  venomous was the fiend that had been slain therewith. He brought nothing  more with him than the hilt and Grendel's head. Up he rose through the  waters where the furious sea-beasts before had chased him. Now not one  was to be seen; the depths were purified when the witch lost her life.  So he came to land, bravely swimming, bearing his spoils. His men saw  him, they thanked God, and ran to free him of his armour. They rejoiced  to get sight of him, sound and whole.    Now they marched gladly through the highways to the town. It took four  of them to carry Grendel's head. On they went, all fourteen, their  captain glorious in their midst. They entered the great hall, startling  the King and Queen, as they sat at meat, with the fearful sight of  Grendel's head.    Beowulf handed the magic hilt to Hrothgar, who saw that it was the work  of giants of old. He spake to Beowulf, while all held their peace,  praised him for his courage, said that he would love him as his son,  and bade him be a help to mankind, remembering not to glory in his own  strength, for he held it from God, and death without more ado might  subdue it altogether. \"Many, many treasures,\" he said, \"must pass from  me to you to-morrow, but now rest and feast.\"    Gladly Beowulf sat down to the banquet, and well he liked the thought of  the rest.    When day dawned, he bade the King farewell with noble words, promising  to help him in time of need. Hrothgar with tears and embraces let him  go, giving him fresh gifts of hoarded jewels. He wept, for he loved  Beowulf well, and knew he would never see him any more.    The coastguard saw the gallant warriors coming, bade them welcome, and  led them to their ship. The wind whistled in the sails, and a pleasant  humming sound was heard as the good ship sped on her way. So Beowulf  returned home, having done mighty deeds and gained great honour.    In due time Beowulf himself became King, and well he governed the land  for fifty years. Then trouble came.    A slave, fleeing from his master, stumbled by an evil chance into the  den of a dragon. There he saw a dazzling hoard of gold, guarded by the  dragon for three hundred winters. The treasure tempted him, and he  carried off a tankard of gold to give to his master, to make peace with  him.    The dragon had been sleeping, now he awoke, and sniffed the scent of an  enemy along the rock. He hunted diligently over the ground; he wanted to  find the man who had done the mischief in his sleep. In his rage he  swung around the treasure mound, dashing into it now and again to seek  the jewelled tankard. He found it hard to wait until evening came, when  he meant to avenge with fire the loss of his treasure.    Presently the sun sank, and the dragon had his will. He set forth,  burning all the cheerful homes of men: his rage was felt far and wide.  Before dawn he shot back again to his dark home, trusting in his mound  and in his craft to defend himself.    Now Beowulf heard that his own home had been burnt to the ground. It was  a great grief to him, almost making him break out in a rage against  Providence. His breast heaved with anger.    He meant to rid his country of the plague, and to fight the dragon  single handed. He would have thought it shame to seek him with a large  band, he who, as a lad, had killed Grendel and his kin. As he armed for  the fray, many thoughts filled his mind; he remembered the days of his  youth and manhood. \"I fought many wars in my youth,\" he said, \"and now  that I am aged, and the keeper of my people, I will yet again seek the  enemy and do famously.\"    He bade his men await him on the mountain-side. They were to see which  of the two would come alive out of the tussle.    There the aged King beheld where a rocky archway stood, with a stream of  fire gushing from it; no one could stand there and not be scorched. He  gave a great shout, and the dragon answered with a hot breath of flame.  Beowulf, with drawn sword, stood well up to his shield, when the burning  dragon, curved like an arch, came headlong upon him. The shield saved  him but little; he swung up the sword to smite the horrible monster, but  its edge did not bite. Sparks flew around him on every side; he saw that  the end of his days had come.    His men crept away to the woods to save their lives. One, and one only,  Wiglaf by name, sped through the smoke and flame to help his lord.    \"My Lord Beowulf!\" he cried, \"with all your might defend life, I will  support you to the utmost.\"    The dragon came on in fury; in a trice the flames consumed Wiglaf's  shield, but, nothing daunted, he stepped under the shelter of Beowulf's,  as his own fell in ashes about him. The King remembered his strength of  old, and he smote with his sword with such force that it stuck in the  monster's head, while splinters flew all around. His hand was so strong  that, as men used to say, he broke any sword in using it, and was none  the worse for it.    Now, for the third time, the dragon rushed upon him, and seized him by  the neck with his poisonous fangs. Wiglaf, with no thought for himself,  rushed forward, though he was scorched with the flames, and smote the  dragon lower down than Beowulf had done. With such effect the sword  entered the dragon's body that from that moment the fire began to cease.    The King, recovering his senses, drew his knife and ended the monster's  life. So these two together destroyed the enemy of the people. To  Beowulf that was the greatest moment of his life, when he saw his work  completed.    The wound that the dragon had given him began to burn and swell, for the  poison had entered it. He knew that the tale of his days was told. As he  rested on a stone by the mound, he pondered thoughtfully, looking on the  cunning work of the dwarfs of old, the stone arches on their rocky  pillars. Wiglaf, with tender care, unloosed his helmet and brought him  water, Beowulf discoursing the while: \"Now I would gladly have given my  armour to my son, had God granted me one. I have ruled this people fifty  years, and no King has dared attack them. I have held my own with  justice, and no friend has lost his life through me. Though I am sick  with deadly wounds, I have comfort in this. Now go quickly, beloved  Wiglaf, show me the ancient wealth that I have won for my people, the  gold and brilliant gems, that I may then contentedly give up my life.\"    Quickly did Wiglaf enter the mound at the bidding of his master. On  every side he saw gold and jewels and choice vases, helmets and  bracelets, and over head, a marvellous banner, all golden, gleaming with  light, so that he could scan the surface of the floor and see the  curious treasured hoards. He filled his lap full of golden cups and  platters, and also took the brilliant banner.    He hastened to return with his spoils, wondering, with pain, if he  should find his King still alive. He bore his treasures to him, laid  them on the ground, and again sprinkled him with water. \"I thank God,\"  said the dying King, \"that I have been permitted to win this treasure  for my people; now they will have all that they need. But I cannot be  any longer here. Bid my men make a lofty mound on the headland  overlooking the sea, and there place my ashes. In time to come men shall  call it Beowulf's Barrow, it shall tower aloft to guide sailors over the  stormy seas.\"    The brave King took from his neck his golden collar, took his helmet and  his coronet, and gave them to his true knight, Wiglaf. \"Fate has swept  all my kinsmen away,\" said he, \"and now I must follow them.\"    That was his last word, as his soul departed from his bosom, to join the  company of the just.    Of all Kings in the world, he was, said his men, the gentlest to his  knights and the most desirous of honour.
