So the glass-blower went out and pretended to search, and by-and-by  he returned and said:    \"I've discovered the dog. You will find him in the mansion of Miss  Mydas.\"    The wizard went at once to see if this were true, and, sure enough,  the glass dog ran out and began barking at him. Then the wizard  spread out his hands and chanted a magic spell which sent the dog  fast asleep, when he picked him up and carried him to his own room  on the top floor of the tenement house.    Afterward he carried the Beauty Powder to the glass-blower as a  reward, and the fellow immediately swallowed it and became the most  beautiful man in the world.    The next time he called upon Miss Mydas there was no dog to bark at  him, and when the young lady saw him she fell in love with his  beauty at once.    \"If only you were a count or a prince,\" she sighed, \"I'd willingly  marry you.\"    \"But I am a prince,\" he answered; \"the Prince of Dogblowers.\"    \"Ah!\" said she; \"then if you are willing to accept an allowance of  four dollars a week I'll order the wedding cards engraved.\"    The man hesitated, but when he thought of the rope hanging from his  bedpost he consented to the terms.    So they were married, and the bride was very jealous of her  husband's beauty and led him a dog's life. So he managed to get into  debt and made her miserable in turn.    * * * * *    As for the glass dog, the wizard set him barking again by means of  his wizardness and put him outside his door. I suppose he is there  yet, and am rather sorry, for I should like to consult the wizard  about the moral to this story.          THE QUEEN OF QUOK      A king once died, as kings are apt to do, being as liable to  shortness of breath as other mortals.    It was high time this king abandoned his earth life, for he had  lived in a sadly extravagant manner, and his subjects could spare  him without the slightest inconvenience.    His father had left him a full treasury, both money and jewels being  in abundance. But the foolish king just deceased had squandered  every penny in riotous living. He had then taxed his subjects until  most of them became paupers, and this money vanished in more riotous  living. Next he sold all the grand old furniture in the palace; all  the silver and gold plate and bric-a-brac; all the rich carpets and  furnishings and even his own kingly wardrobe, reserving only a  soiled and moth-eaten ermine robe to fold over his threadbare  raiment. And he spent the money in further riotous living.    Don't ask me to explain what riotous living is. I only know, from  hearsay, that it is an excellent way to get rid of money. And so  this spendthrift king found it.    He now picked all the magnificent jewels from this kingly crown and  from the round ball on the top of his scepter, and sold them and  spent the money. Riotous living, of course. But at last he was at  the end of his resources. He couldn't sell the crown itself, because  no one but the king had the right to wear it. Neither could he sell  the royal palace, because only the king had the right to live there.    So, finally, he found himself reduced to a bare palace, containing  only a big mahogany bedstead that he slept in, a small stool on  which he sat to pull off his shoes and the moth-eaten ermine robe.    In this straight he was reduced to the necessity of borrowing an  occasional dime from his chief counselor, with which to buy a ham  sandwich. And the chief counselor hadn't many dimes. One who  counseled his king so foolishly was likely to ruin his own prospects  as well.    So the king, having nothing more to live for, died suddenly and left  a ten-year-old son to inherit the dismantled kingdom, the moth-eaten  robe and the jewel-stripped crown.    No one envied the child, who had scarcely been thought of until he  became king himself. Then he was recognized as a personage of some  importance, and the politicians and hangers-on, headed by the chief  counselor of the kingdom, held a meeting to determine what could be  done for him.    These folk had helped the old king to live riotously while his money  lasted, and now they were poor and too proud to work. So they tried  to think of a plan that would bring more money into the little  king's treasury, where it would be handy for them to help  themselves.    After the meeting was over the chief counselor came to the young  king, who was playing peg-top in the courtyard, and said:    \"Your majesty, we have thought of a way to restore your kingdom to  its former power and magnificence.\"    \"All right,\" replied his majesty, carelessly. \"How will you do it?\"    \"By marrying you to a lady of great wealth,\" replied the counselor.    \"Marrying me!\" cried the king. \"Why, I am only ten years old!\"    \"I know; it is to be regretted. But your majesty will grow older,  and the affairs of the kingdom demand that you marry a wife.\"    \"Can't I marry a mother, instead?\" asked the poor little king, who  had lost his mother when a baby.    \"Certainly not,\" declared the counselor. \"To marry a mother would be  illegal; to marry a wife is right and proper.\"    \"Can't you marry her yourself?\" inquired his majesty, aiming his  peg-top at the chief counselor's toe, and laughing to see how he  jumped to escape it.    \"Let me explain,\" said the other. \"You haven't a penny in the world,  but you have a kingdom. There are many rich women who would be glad  to give their wealth in exchange for a queen's coronet--even if the  king is but a child. So we have decided to advertise that the one  who bids the highest shall become the queen of Quok.\"    \"If I must marry at all,\" said the king, after a moment's thought,  \"I prefer to marry Nyana, the armorer's daughter.\"    \"She is too poor,\" replied the counselor.    \"Her teeth are pearls, her eyes are amethysts, and her hair is  gold,\" declared the little king.    \"True, your majesty. But consider that your wife's wealth must be  used. How would Nyana look after you have pulled her teeth of  pearls, plucked out her amethyst eyes and shaved her golden head?\"    The boy shuddered.    \"Have your own way,\" he said, despairingly. \"Only let the lady be as  dainty as possible and a good playfellow.\"    \"We shall do our best,\" returned the chief counselor, and went away  to advertise throughout the neighboring kingdoms for a wife for the  boy king of Quok.    There were so many applicants for the privilege of marrying the  little king that it was decided to put him up at auction, in order  that the largest possible sum of money should be brought into the  kingdom. So, on the day appointed, the ladies gathered at the palace  from all the surrounding kingdoms--from Bilkon, Mulgravia, Junkum  and even as far away as the republic of Macvelt.    The chief counselor came to the palace early in the morning and had  the king's face washed and his hair combed; and then he padded the  inside of the crown with old newspapers to make it small enough to  fit his majesty's head. It was a sorry looking crown, having many  big and little holes in it where the jewels had once been; and it  had been neglected and knocked around until it was quite battered  and tarnished. Yet, as the counselor said, it was the king's crown,  and it was quite proper he should wear it on the solemn occasion of  his auction.    Like all boys, be they kings or paupers, his majesty had torn and  soiled his one suit of clothes, so that they were hardly  presentable; and there was no money to buy new ones. Therefore the  counselor wound the old ermine robe around the king and sat him upon  the stool in the middle of the otherwise empty audience chamber.    And around him stood all the courtiers and politicians and  hangers-on of the kingdom, consisting of such people as were too  proud or lazy to work for a living. There was a great number of  them, you may be sure, and they made an imposing appearance.    Then the doors of the audience chamber were thrown open, and the  wealthy ladies who aspired to being queen of Quok came trooping in.  The king looked them over with much anxiety, and decided they were  each and all old enough to be his grandmother, and ugly enough to  scare away the crows from the royal cornfields. After which he lost  interest in them.    But the rich ladies never looked at the poor little king squatting  upon his stool. They gathered at once about the chief counselor, who  acted as auctioneer.    \"How much am I offered for the coronet of the queen of Quok?\" asked  the counselor, in a loud voice.    \"Where is the coronet?\" inquired a fussy old lady who had just  buried her ninth husband and was worth several millions.    \"There isn't any coronet at present,\" explained the chief counselor,  \"but whoever bids highest will have the right to wear one, and she  can then buy it.\"    \"Oh,\" said the fussy old lady, \"I see.\" Then she added: \"I'll bid  fourteen dollars.\"    \"Fourteen thousand dollars!\" cried a sour-looking woman who was thin  and tall and had wrinkles all over her skin--\"like a frosted apple,\"  the king thought.    The bidding now became fast and furious, and the poverty-stricken  courtiers brightened up as the sum began to mount into the millions.    \"He'll bring us a very pretty fortune, after all,\" whispered one to  his comrade, \"and then we shall have the pleasure of helping him  spend it.\"    The king began to be anxious. All the women who looked at all  kind-hearted or pleasant had stopped bidding for lack of money, and  the slender old dame with the wrinkles seemed determined to get the  coronet at any price, and with it the boy husband. This ancient  creature finally became so excited that her wig got crosswise of her  head and her false teeth kept slipping out, which horrified the  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4358"],[0,"The Sea Fairies (#4)"],[1,"fishes, all yellowtails and of very large size. There must  have been hundreds of them lying lazily in the water, and when they  saw the mermaids they merely wriggled to one side and opened a path  for the sea fairies to pass through. \"Will they hurt us?\" asked  Trot.    \"No indeed,\" laughed the Princess. \"Fishes are stupid creatures  mostly, and this family is quite harmless.\"    \"How about sharks?\" asked Cap'n Bill, who was swimming gracefully  beside them, his hand clutched in that of pretty Merla.    \"Sharks may indeed be dangerous to you,\" replied Clia, \"so I advise  you to keep them at a safe distance. They never dare attempt to bite  a mermaid, and it may be they will think you belong to our band; but  it is well to avoid them if possible.\"    \"Don't get careless, Cap'n,\" added Trot.    \"I surely won't, mate,\" he replied. \"You see, I didn't use to be  'fraid o' sharks 'cause if they came near I'd stick my wooden leg at  'em. But now, if they happens to fancy these green scales, it's all  up with ol' Bill.\"    \"Never fear,\" said Merla, \"I'll take care of you on our journey, and  in our palaces you will find no sharks at all.\"    \"Can't they get in?\" he asked anxiously.    \"No. The palaces of the mermaids are inhabited only by themselves.\"    \"Is there anything else to be afraid of in the sea?\" asked the  little girl after they had swum quite a while in silence.    \"One or two things, my dear,\" answered Princess Clia. \"Of course, we  mermaids have great powers, being fairies; yet among the sea people  is one nearly as powerful as we are, and that is the devilfish.\"    \"I know,\" said Trot. \"I've seen 'em.\"    \"You have seen the smaller ones, I suppose, which sometimes rise to  the surface or go near the shore, and are often caught by  fishermen,\" said Clia, \"but they are only second cousins of the  terrible deep-sea devilfish to which I refer.\"    \"Those ones are bad enough, though,\" declared Cap'n Bill. \"If you  know any worse ones, I don't want a interduction to 'em.\"    \"The monster devilfish inhabit caves in the rugged, mountainous  regions of the ocean,\" resumed the Princess, \"and they are evil  spirits who delight in injuring all who meet them. None lives near  our palaces, so there is little danger of your meeting any while you  are our guests.\"    \"I hope we won't,\" said Trot.    \"None for me,\" added Cap'n Bill. \"Devils of any sort ought to be  give a wide berth, an' devilfish is worser ner sea serpents.\"    \"Oh, do you know the sea serpents?\" asked Merla as if surprised.    \"Not much I don't,\" answered the sailor, \"but I've heard tell of  folks as has seen 'em.\"    \"Did they ever live to tell the tale?\" asked Trot.    \"Sometimes,\" he replied. \"They're jes' ORful creatures, mate.\"    \"How easy it is to be mistaken,\" said Princess Clia softly. \"We know  the sea serpents very well, and we like them.\"    \"You do!\" exclaimed Trot.    \"Yes, dear. There are only three of them in all the world, and not  only are they harmless, but quite bashful and shy. They are  kind-hearted, too, and although not beautiful in appearance, they do  many kind deeds and are generally beloved.\"    \"Where do they live?\" asked the child.    \"The oldest one, who is king of this ocean, lives quite near us,\"  said Clia. \"His name is Anko.\"    \"How old is he?\" inquired Cap'n Bill curiously.    \"No one knows. He was here before the ocean came, and he stayed here  because he learned to like the water better than the land as a  habitation. Perhaps King Anko is ten thousand years old, perhaps  twenty thousand. We often lose track of the centuries down here in  the sea.\"    \"That's pretty old, isn't it?\" said Trot. \"Older than Cap'n Bill, I  guess.\"    \"Summat,\" chuckled the sailor man, \"summat older, mate, but not  much. P'raps the sea serpent ain't got gray whiskers.\"    \"Oh yes he has,\" responded Merla with a laugh. \"And so have his two  brothers, Unko and Inko. They each have an ocean of their own, you  know; and once every hundred years they come here to visit their  brother Anko. So we've seen all three many times.\"    \"Why, how old are mermaids, then?\" asked Trot, looking around at the  beautiful creatures wonderingly.    \"We are like all ladies of uncertain age,\" rejoined the Princess  with a smile. \"We don't care to tell.\"    \"Older than Cap'n Bill?\"    \"Yes, dear,\" said Clia.    \"But we haven't any gray whiskers,\" added Merla merrily, \"and our  hearts are ever young.\"    Trot was thoughtful. It made her feel solemn to be in the company of  such old people. The band of mermaids seemed to all appearances  young and fresh and not a bit as if they'd been soaked in water for  hundreds of years. The girl began to take more notice of the sea  maidens following after her. More than a dozen were in the group;  all were lovely in appearance and clothed in the same gauzy robes as  Merla and the Princess. These attendants did not join in the  conversation but darted here and there in sportive play, and often  Trot heard the tinkling chorus of their laughter. Whatever doubts  might have arisen in the child's mind through the ignorant tales of  her sailor friend, she now found the mermaids to be light-hearted,  joyous and gay, and from the first she had not been in the least  afraid of her new companions.    \"How much farther do we have to go?\" asked Cap'n Bill presently.    \"Are you getting tired?\" Merla inquired.    \"No,\" said he, \"but I'm sorter anxious to see what your palaces look  like. Inside the water ain't as interestin' as the top of it. It's  fine swimmin', I'll agree, an' I like it, but there ain't nuthin'  special to see that I can make out.\"    \"That is true, sir,\" replied the Princess. \"We have purposely led  you through the mid-water hoping you would see nothing to alarm you  until you get more accustomed to our ocean life. Moreover, we are  able to travel more swiftly here. How far do you think we have  already come, Cap'n?\"    \"Oh, 'bout two mile,\" he answered.    \"Well, we are now hundreds of miles from the cave where we started,\"  she told him.    \"You don't mean it!\" he exclaimed in wonder.    \"Then there's magic in it,\" announced Trot soberly.    \"True, my dear. To avoid tiring you and to save time, we have used a  little of our fairy power,\" said Clia. \"The result is that we are  nearing our home. Let us go downward a bit, now, for you must know  that the mermaid palaces are at the very bottom of the ocean, and in  its deepest part.\"          CHAPTER 4    THE PALACE OF QUEEN AQUAREINE      Trot was surprised to find it was not at all dark or gloomy as they  descended farther into the deep sea. Things were not quite so clear  to her eyes as they had been in the bright sunshine above the  ocean's surface, but every object was distinct nevertheless, as if  she saw through a pane of green-tainted glass. The water was very  clear except for this green shading, and the little girl had never  before felt so light and buoyant as she did now. It was no effort at  all to dart through the water, which seemed to support her on all  sides.    \"I don't believe I weigh anything at all,\" she said to Cap'n Bill.    \"No more do I, Trot,\" said he. \"But that's nat'ral, seein' as we're  under water so far. What bothers me most is how we manage to  breathe, havin' no gills like fishes have.\"    \"Are you sure we haven't any gills?\" she asked, lifting her free  hand to feel her throat.    \"Sure. Ner the mermaids haven't any, either,\" declared Cap'n Bill.    \"Then,\" said Trot, \"we're breathing by magic.\"    The mermaids laughed at this shrewd remark, and the Princess said,  \"You have guessed correctly, my dear. Go a little slower, now, for  the palaces are in sight.\"    \"Where?\" asked Trot eagerly.    \"Just before you.\"    \"In that grove of trees?\" inquired the girl. And really, it seemed  to her that they were approaching a beautiful grove. The bottom of  the sea was covered with white sand, in which grew many varieties of  sea shrubs with branches like those of trees. Not all of them were  green, however, for the branches and leaves were of a variety of  gorgeous colors. Some were purple, shading down to a light lavender;  and there were reds all the way from a delicate rose-pink to vivid  shades of scarlet. Orange, yellow and blue shades were there, too,  mingling with the sea-greens in a most charming manner. Altogether,  Trot found the brilliant coloring somewhat bewildering.    These sea shrubs, which in size were quite as big and tall as the  trees on earth, were set so close together that their branches  entwined; but there were several avenues leading into the groves,  and at the entrance to each avenue the girl noticed several large  fishes with long spikes growing upon their noses.    \"Those are swordfishes,\" remarked the Princess as she led the band  past one of these avenues.    \"Are they dang'rous?\" asked Trot.    \"Not to us,\" was the reply. \"The swordfishes are among our most  valued and faithful servants, guarding the entrances to the gardens  which surround our palaces. If any creatures try to enter uninvited,  these guards fight them and drive them away. Their swords are sharp  and strong, and they are fierce fighters, I assure you.\"    \"I've known 'em to attack ships, an' stick their swords right  through the wood,\" said Cap'n Bill.    \"Those belonged to the wandering tribes of swordfishes,\" explained  the Princess. \"These, who are our servants, are too sensible and  intelligent to attack ships.\"    The band now headed into a broad passage through the \"gardens,\" as  the mermaids called these gorgeous groves, and the great swordfishes  guarding the entrance made way for them to pass, afterward resuming  their posts with watchful eyes. As they slowly swam along the  avenue, Trot noticed that some of the bushes seemed to have fruits  growing upon them, but what these fruits might be neither she nor  Cap'n Bill could guess.    The way wound here and there for some distance, till finally they  came to a more open space all "]]]
