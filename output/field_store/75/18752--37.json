A  moment later one of the assistants of the office led out from a rear  room another Irish girl,--who, it seems, had just engaged herself to  work in the country.    \"Good-by, Bridget,\" said this girl, to the one Mary Nestor had  hired. \"I'm off now. The carriage has just come for me. I'm goin'  away in style.\"    \"Good luck, Sarah,\" wished Bridget.    Tom looked out of the window. A dilapidated farm wagon, drawn by two  rusty-looking horses, just drawing up at the curb.    \"There is your employer, Sarah,\" said the proprietress of the  office. \"You will have a nice ride to the country and I hope you  will like the place.\"    A typical country farmer alighted from the wagon, leaving a woman,  evidently his wife, or the seat. He called out:    \"I'll git th' servant-gal, 'Mandy, an' we'll drive right out hum.  Then you won't have such hard work any more.\"    \"An' so that's the style you was tellin' me of; eh, Sarah?\" asked  the cook whom Miss Nestor had engaged. \"That's queer style, Sarah.\"    Sarah was blushing from shame and mortification. Tom was quick to  seize the advantage thus offered.    \"Bridget, if YOU appreciate style,\" he said, \"you will come in the  automobile. I have one of the very latest models, and it is very  safe. But perhaps you prefer a farm wagon.\"    \"Indade an' I don't!\" was the ready response. \"I'll go wid you now  if only to show Sarah Malloy thot I have more style than her! She  was boastin' of the fine place she had, an' th' illigant carriage  that was comin' t' take her to the counthry. If that's it I want  none of it! I'll go wid you an' th' young gintleman. Style indade!\"  and, gathering up her bundle she followed Tom and Mary to the  waiting auto.    They entered it and started off, just as Mrs. Duy Puyster drove up  in her elegantly appointed carriage, while Sarah, with tears of  mortification in her eyes, climbed up beside the farmer and his  wife.    \"You saved the day for me, Tom,\" whispered Miss Nestor, as the young  inventor increased the speed of his car. \"It was only just in time.\"    \"Don't forget the apple turnovers,\" he whispered back.    Once she had made the plunge, the new cook seemed to lose her fears  of the auto, and enjoyed the ride. In a short time she had been  safely delivered at Miss Nestor's home, while that young lady  repeated her thanks to Tom, and renewed her invitation for him to  come and sample the apple turnovers, which Tom promised faithfully  to do, saying he would call on his return from Philadelphia.    Musing on the amusing feature of his trip, Tom was urging his auto  along at moderate speed, when, as he turned down a country road,  leading to his home, he saw, coming toward him, a carriage, drawn by  a slow-moving, white horse, and containing a solitary figure.    \"Why, that looks like Andy Foger,\" spoke Tom, half aloud. \"I wonder  what he's doing out driving? His auto must be out of commission. But  that's not strange, considering the way he abuses the machine. It's  in the repair shop half the time.\"    He slowed down still more, for he did not know but that Andy's horse  might be skittish. He need have no fears, however, for the animal  did not seem to have much more life than did Eradicate's mule,  Boomerang.    As Tom came nearer the carriage, he was surprised to see Andy  deliberately swing his horse across the road, blocking the highway  by means of the carriage and steed.    \"Well, Andy Foger, what does that mean?\" cried Tom, indignantly, as  he brought his car to a sudden stop. \"Why do you block the road?\"    \"Because I want to,\" snarled the bully, taking out a notebook and  pencil, and pretending to make some notes about the property in  front of which he had halted. \"I'm in the real estate business now,\"  went on Andy, \"and I'm getting descriptions of the property I'm  going to sell. Guess I've got a right to stop in the road if I want  to!\"    \"But not to block it up,\" retorted Tom. \"That's against the law.  Pull over and let me pass!\"    \"Suppose I don't do it?\"    \"Then I'll make you!\"    \"Huh! I'd like to see you try it!\" snapped Andy. \"If you make  trouble for me, it will be the worse for you.\"    \"If you pull to one side, so I can pass, there'll be no trouble,\"  said Tom, seeing that Andy wished to pick a quarrel.    \"Well, I'm not going to pull aside until I finish putting down this  description,\" and the bully continued to write with tantalizing  slowness.    \"Look here!\" exclaimed Tom Swift, with sudden energy. \"I'm not going  to stand for this! Either you pull to one side and let me pass, or--\"    \"Well, what will you do?\" demanded the bully.    \"I'll shove you to one side, and you can take the consequences!\"    \"You won't dare to!\"    \"I won't, eh? Just you watch.\"    Tom threw forward the lever of his car. There was a hum of the  motor, and the electric moved ahead. Andy had continued to write in  the book, but at this sound he glanced up.    \"Don't you dare to bunk into me!\" yelled Andy. \"If you do I'll sue  you for damages!\"    \"Get out of the way, or I'll shove you off the road!\" threatened  Tom, calmly.    \"I'll not go until I get ready.\"    \"Oh, yes you will,\" responded our hero quietly. He sent his car  ahead slowly but surely. It was within a few feet of the carriage  containing Andy. The bully had dropped his notebook, and was shaking  his fist at Tom.    As for the young inventor he had his plans made. He saw that the  horse was a quiet, sleepy one, that would not run away, no matter  what happened, and Tom only intended to gently push the carriage to  one side, and pass on.    The front of his auto came up against the other vehicle.    \"Here, you stop!\" cried Andy, savagely.    \"It's too late now,\" answered Tom, grimly.    Andy reached for the horsewhip. Tom put on a little more power, and  the carriage began to slide across the road, but the old horse never  opened his eyes.    \"Take that!\" cried Andy, raising his whip, with the intention of  slashing Tom across the face, for the front of the auto was open.  But the blow never fell, for, the next instant, the carriage gave a  lurch as one of the wheels slid against a stone, and, as Andy was  standing up, and leaning forward, he was pitched head first out into  the road.    \"By Jove! I hope I haven't hurt him!\" gasped Tom, as he leaped from  his auto, which he had brought to a stop.    The young inventor bent over the bully. There was a little cut on  Andy's forehead, and his face was white. He had been most  effectually knocked out entirely by his own meanness and fault, but,  none the less, Tom was frightened. He raised up Andy's head on his  arm, and brushed back his hair. Andy was unconscious.          CHAPTER IV    MR. DAMON WILL GO ALONG      At first Tom was greatly frightened at the sight of Andy's pale  face. He feared lest the bully might be seriously hurt. But when he  realized that the fall from the carriage, which was a low one, was  not hard, and that Andy had landed on his outstretched hands before  his head came in contact with the earth, our hero was somewhat  reassured.    \"I wish I had some water, with which to bathe his head,\" Tom  murmured, and he looked about in vain for some. But it was not  needed, for, a moment later, Andy opened his eyes, and, when he saw  Tom bending over, and holding him, the bully exclaimed:    \"Here! You let me go! Don't you hit me again, Tom Swift, or I'll  punch you!\"    \"I didn't hit you,\" declared Tom, while Andy tore himself away, and  struggled to his feet.    \"Yes, you did, too, hit me!\"    \"I did not! You tried to strike me with your whip, as I was shoving  your carriage out of the way, which I had a perfect right to do, as  you were blockading the highway. You lost your balance and fell. It  was your own fault.\"    \"Well, you'll suffer for it, just the same, snarled Andy, and then,  putting his hand to his head, and bringing it away, with some drops  of blood on it, he cried out:\"    \"Oh, I'm hurt! I'm injured! Get a doctor, or maybe I'll bleed to  death!\" He began blubbering, for Andy, like all bullies, was a  coward.    \"You're not hurt,\" asserted Tom, trying not to laugh. \"It's only a  scratch. Next time don't try to blockade the whole street, and you  won't get into trouble. Are you able to drive home; or shall I take  you in my car?\"    \"I wouldn't ride in your car!\" snapped the ugly lad. \"You go on, and  mind your business now, and I'll pay you back for this, some day. I  could have you arrested!\"    \"And so could I have you locked up for obstructing traffic. But I'll  not. Your rig isn't damaged, and you'd better drive home.\"    The old white horse had not moved, and was evidently glad of the  rest. A glance satisfied Tom that the carriage had not been damaged,  and, getting into his car, while Andy was brushing the dust from his  clothes, our hero started the motor.    There was now room enough to pass around the obstructing carriage,  and soon Tom was humming down the road, leaving a much discomfited  bully behind him.    \"Tom Swift is too smart--thinking he can run everybody, and  everything, to suit himself,\" growled Andy, as he finished dusting  off his clothes, and wiping the blood from his face. As Tom had  said, the wound was but a scratch, though the bully's head ached,  and he felt a little dizzy. \"I wish I'd hit him with the horsewhip,\"  he went on, vindictively. \"I'll get square with him some day.\"    Andy had said this many times, but he had never yet succeeded in  permanently getting the best of Tom. Pondering on some scheme of  revenge the rich lad--for Mr. Foger, his father, was quite  wealthy--drove on.    Meanwhile Tom, rather wishing the little encounter had not taken  place, but refusing to blame himself for what had occurred, was  speeding toward home.    \"Let's see,\" he murmured, as he drove along in his powerful car.  \"I've got quite a lot to do if I make an early start for  Philadelphia, in my airship, to-morrow. I want to tighten the  propeller on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4230"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Motor-Cycle; Or, Fun and Adventures on the Road (#4)"],[1," he's headed. No use running any more  risks.\"    Almost at that moment a puff of wind blew some of the dust to one  side. Tom had a glimpse of the man on the puffing machine.    \"It's the same chap!\" he exclaimed aloud; \"and he's going the same  way I am. Well, I'll not try to catch up to him. I wonder what he's  been doing all this while, that he hasn't gotten any farther than  this? Either he's been riding back and forth, or else he's been  resting. My, but he certainly is scooting along!\"    The wind carried to Tom the sound of the explosions of the motor,  and he could see the man clinging tightly to the handle-bars. The  rider was almost in front of Tom's house now, when, with a  suddenness that caused the lad to utter an exclamation of alarm, the  stranger turned his machine right toward a big oak tree.    \"What's he up to?\" cried Tom excitedly. \"Does he think he can climb  that, or is he giving an exhibition by showing how close he can come  and not hit it?\"    A moment later the motor-cyclist struck the tree a glancing blow.  The man went flying over the handle-bars, the machine was shunted to  the ditch along the road, and falling over on one side the motor  raced furiously. The rider lay in a heap at the foot of the tree.    \"My, that was a smash!\" cried Tom. \"He must be killed!\" and bending  forward, he raced toward the scene of the accident.          CHAPTER IV.    TOM AND A MOTOR-CYCLE      When Tom reached the prostrate figure on the grass at the foot of  the old oak tree, the youth bent quickly over the man. There was an  ugly cut on his head, and blood was flowing from it. But Tom quickly  noticed that the stranger was breathing, though not very strongly.    \"Well, he's not dead--just yet!\" exclaimed the youth with a sigh of  relief. \"But I guess he's pretty badly hurt. I must get help--no,  I'll take him into our house. It's not far. I'll call dad.\"    Leaning his wheel against the tree Tom started for his home, about  three hundred feet away, and then he noticed that the stranger's  motor-cycle was running at full speed on the ground.    \"Guess I'd better shut off the power!\" he exclaimed. \"No use letting  the machine be ruined.\" Tom had a natural love for machinery, and it  hurt him almost as much to see a piece of fine apparatus abused as  it did to see an animal mistreated. It was the work of a  moment to shut off the gasolene and spark, and then the youth raced  on toward his house.    \"Where's dad?\" he called to Mrs. Baggert, who was washing the  dishes.    \"Out in one of the shops,\" replied the housekeeper. \"Why, Tom,\" she  went on hurriedly as she saw how excited he was, \"whatever has  happened?\"    \"Man hurt--out in front--motor-cycle smash--I'm going to bring him  in here--get some things ready--I'll find dad!\"    \"Bless and save us!\" cried Mrs. Baggert. \"Whatever are we coming to?  Who's hurt? How did it happen? Is he dead?\"    \"Haven't time to talk now!\" answered Tom, rushing from the house.  \"Dad and I will bring him in here.\"    Tom found his father in one of the three small machine shops on the  grounds about the Swift home. The youth hurriedly told what had  happened.    \"Of course we'll bring him right in here!\" assented Mr. Swift,  putting aside the work upon which he was engaged. \"Did you tell Mrs.  Baggert?\"    \"Yes, and she's all excited.\"    \"Well, she can't help it, being a woman, I suppose. But we'll  manage. Do you know the man?\"    \"Never saw him before to-day, when he tried to run me down. Guess he  doesn't know much about motor-cycles. But come on, dad. He may bleed  to death.\"    Father and son hurried to where the stranger lay. As they bent over  him he opened his eyes and asked faintly:    \"Where am I? What happened?\"    \"You're all right--in good hands,\" said Mr. Swift. \"Are you much  hurt?\"    \"Not much--mostly stunned, I guess. What happened?\" he repeated.    \"You and your motor-cycle tried to climb a tree,\" remarked Tom with  grim humor.    \"Oh, yes, I remember now. I couldn't seem to steer out of the way.  And I couldn't shut off the power in time. Is the motor-cycle much  damaged?\"    \"The front wheel is,\" reported Tom, after an inspection, \"and there  are some other breaks, but I guess--\"    \"I wish it was all smashed!\" exclaimed the man vigorously. \"I never  want to see it again!\"    \"Why, don't you like it?\" asked Tom eagerly.    \"No, and I never will,\" the man spoke faintly but determinedly.    \"Never mind now,\" interposed Mr. Swift. \"Don't excite yourself. My  son and I will take you to our house and send for a doctor.\"    \"I'll bring the motor-cycle, after we've carried you in,\" added Tom.    \"Don't worry about the machine. I never want to see it again!\" went  on the man, rising to a sitting position. \"It nearly killed me twice  to-day. I'll never ride again.\"    \"You'll feel differently after the doctor fixes you up,\" said Mr.  Swift with a smile.    \"Doctor! I don't need a doctor,\" cried the stranger. \"I am only  bruised and shaken up.\"    \"You have a bad cut on your head,\" said Tom.    \"It isn't very deep,\" went on the injured man, placing his fingers  on it. \"Fortunately I struck the tree a glancing blow. If you will  allow me to rest in your house a little while and give me some  plaster for the cut I shall be all right again.\"    \"Can you walk, or shall we carry you?\" asked Tom's father.    \"Oh, I can walk, if you'll support me a little.\" And the stranger  proved that he could do this by getting to his feet and taking a few  steps. Mr. Swift and his son took hold of his arms and led him to  the house. There he was placed on a lounge and given some simple  restoratives by Mrs. Baggert, who, when she found the accident was  not serious, recovered her composure.    \"I must have been unconscious for a few minutes,\" went on the man.    \"You were,\" explained Tom. \"When I got up to you I thought you were  dead, until I saw you breathe. Then I shut off the power of your  machine and ran in for dad. I've got the motor-cycle outside. You  can't ride it for some time, I'm afraid, Mr.--er--\" and Tom stopped  in some confusion, for he realized that he did not know the man's  name.    \"I beg your pardon for not introducing myself before,\" went on the  stranger. \"I'm Wakefield Damon, of Waterfield. But don't worry about  me riding that machine again. I never shall.\"    \"Oh, perhaps--\" began Mr. Swift.    \"No, I never shall,\" went on Mr. Damon positively. \"My doctor told  me to get it, as he thought riding around the country would benefit  my health. I shall tell him his prescription nearly killed me.\"    \"And me too,\" added Tom with a laugh.    \"How--why--are you the young man I nearly ran down this morning?\"  asked Mr. Damon, suddenly sitting up and looking at the youth.    \"I am,\" answered our hero.    \"Bless my soul! So you are!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"I was wondering who  it could be. It's quite a coincidence. But I was in such a cloud of  dust I couldn't make out who it was.\"    \"You had your muffler open, and that made considerable dust,\"  explained Tom.    \"Was that it? Bless my existence! I thought something was wrong, but  I couldn't tell what. I went over all the instructions in the book  and those the agent told me, but I couldn't think of the right one.  I tried all sorts of things to make less dust, but I couldn't. Then,  bless my eyelashes, if the machine didn't stop just after I nearly  ran into you. I tinkered over it for an hour or more before I could  get it to going again. Then I ran into the tree. My doctor told me  the machine would do my liver good, but, bless my happiness, I'd as  soon be without a liver entirely as to do what I've done to-day. I  am done with motor-cycling!\"    A hopeful look came over Tom's face, but he said nothing, that is,  not just then. In a little while Mr. Damon felt so much better that  he said he would start for home. \"I'm afraid you'll have to leave  your machine here,\" said Tom.    \"You can send for it any time you want to,\" added Mr. Swift.    \"Bless my hatband!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon, who appeared to be very  fond of blessing his various organs and his articles of wearing  apparel. \"Bless my hatband! I never want to see it again! If you  will be so kind as to keep it for me, I will send a junk man after  it. I will never spend anything on having it repaired. I am done  with that form of exercise--liver or no liver--doctor or no doctor.\"    He appeared very determined. Tom quickly made up his mind. Mr. Damon  had gone to the bathroom to get rid of some of the mud on his hands  and face.    \"Father,\" said Tom earnestly, \"may I buy that machine off him?\"    \"What? Buy a broken motor-cycle?\"    \"I can easily fix it. It is a fine make, and in good condition. I  can repair it. I've wanted a motor-cycle for some time, and here's a  chance to get a good one cheap.\"    \"You don't need to do that,\" replied Mr. Swift. \"You have money  enough to buy a new one if you want it. I never knew you cared for  them.\"    \"I didn't, until lately. But I'd rather buy this one and fix it up  than get a new one. Besides, I have an idea for a new kind of  transmission, and perhaps I can work it out on this machine.\"    \"Oh, well, if you want it for experimental purposes, I suppose it  will be as good as any. Go ahead, get it if you wish, but don't give  too much for it.\"    \"I'll not. I fancy I can get it cheap.\"    Mr. Damon returned to the living-room, where he had first been  carried.    \"I cannot thank you enough for what you have done for me,\" he said.  \"I might have lain there for hours. Bless my very existence! I have  had a very narrow escape. Hereafter when I see anyone on a motor-cycle  I shall turn my head away. The memory will be too painful,\" and he  touched the plaster that covered a cut on his head.    \"Mr. Damon,\" said Tom quickly, \"will you sell me that motor-cycle?\"    \"Bless my finger rings! Sell you that mass of junk?\"    \"It isn't all junk,\" went on the young inventor. \"I can easily fix  it; though, of course,\" he"]]]
