I somewhat regret now having ever spoken to you on the  subject, for I cannot conceal from myself that the chance of your  making a discovery, where the Spaniards, with all their power of  putting pressure on the natives for the past two or three hundred  years, have failed, is so slight as to be scarcely worth consideration.    \"I tell you frankly that I broached the subject chiefly because I  thought it was much better for you to be doing something than kicking  your heels about London, and mooning over this affair with Miss  Fortescue. There is nothing worse for a young man than living in London  with just enough to keep him comfortably without the necessity of  working. Therefore I thought you would be far better travelling and  hunting for treasure in Peru, than staying here. Even if you fail, as I  feel is almost certain, in the object for which you go out, you will  have plenty to occupy your thoughts, and not be dwelling continually  upon an attachment which in all probability will not turn out  satisfactorily. I do not suppose that you are likely to forget Miss  Fortescue, but by the time you return you will have accustomed yourself  to the thought that it is useless to cry for the moon, and that, after  all, life may be very endurable even if she does not share it.  Therefore I propounded this Peruvian adventure, feeling sure that,  whatever came of it, it would be a benefit to you.\"    \"No doubt it will, sir. I see myself the chance of success is small  indeed, but there is none at all in any other way. It is just the sort  of thing I should like, and I quite feel myself that it would be good  for me to have plenty to think about; and now that you have consented  to Bertie's going with me, I feel more eager than before to undertake  the expedition. The place is in rather a disturbed state, isn't it?\"    \"If you are going to wait until Peru ceases to be in a disturbed state,  Harry, you may wait another hundred years. The Spanish rule was bad,  but Peru was then a pleasant place to live in compared with what it is  now. It is a sort of cock-pit, where a succession of ambitious rascals  struggle for the spoils, and the moment one gets the better of his  rivals fresh intrigues are set on foot, and fresh rebellions break out.  There are good Peruvians--men who have estates and live upon them, and  who are good masters. But as to the politicians, there is no principle  whatever at stake. It is simply a question of who shall have the  handling of the national revenue, and divide it and the innumerable  posts among his adherents. But these struggles will not affect you  largely. In one respect they will even be an advantage. Bent upon their  own factious aims, the combatants have no time to concern themselves  with the doings of an English traveller, whose object out there is  ostensibly to botanize and shoot. Were one of them to obtain the  undisputed control of affairs he might meddle in all sorts of ways;  but, as it is, after you have once got pretty well beyond the area of  their operations, you can regard their doings with indifference,  knowing that the longer they go on fighting the fewer scoundrels there  will be in the land.    \"But even were they to think that it was mining, and not science or  sport that took you out there, they would scarcely interfere with you.  It is admitted by all the factions that Peru needs capital for her  development, and at present that can best be got from this country. The  discovery of a fresh mine means employment to a large number of people,  and the increase of the revenues by a royalty or taxation. English  explorers who have gone out have never had any reason to complain of  interference on the part of the authorities. You will find the average  better class of Peruvians a charming people, and extremely hospitable.  The ladies are pretty enough to turn the head of anyone whose  affections are not already engaged. The men are kindly and courteous in  the extreme. However, you would have little to do with these.    \"In the mountains you would largely depend upon your rifle for food,  and on what you could get in the scattered native villages. The Indians  have no love for the Peruvians. They find their condition no better off  under them than it was under the Spaniards. Once they find out that you  are English they will do all in their power for you. It is to Cochrane  and the English officers with him that they owe the overthrow and  expulsion of their Spanish tyrants, and they are vastly more grateful  than either the Chilians or Peruvians have shown themselves to be.\"    On returning to their lodgings Harry met his brother, who had been into  the city.    \"Old Prosser was very civil,\" said Bertie. \"He said that as their ships  were chiefly in the South American trade it would be a great advantage  for me to learn to speak Spanish well. They had not yet thought  anything about whether they should order another ship to replace the  _Stella_; at any rate, at present they had no vacancy, and would gladly  give me permission to travel in South America, and would find me a  berth to finish my apprenticeship when I returned. More than that, they  said that as I had always been so favourably reported upon they would  put me on as a supernumerary in the _Para_, which will sail in a  fortnight for Callao. I should not draw pay, but I should be in their  service, and the time would count, which would be a great pull, and I  should get my passage for nothing.\"    \"That is capital. Of course I will take a passage in her too.\"    \"And what does Mr. Barnett say?\"    \"Rather to my surprise, Bertie, he did not disapprove of the plan at  all. He thought it would be a good thing for me to have you with me in  case of illness or anything of that sort. Then no doubt he thought to  some extent it would keep you out of mischief.\"    \"I don't believe he thought anything of the sort. Did he say so?\"    \"Well, no, he didn't; but I have no doubt he felt it in some way a sort  of relief.\"    \"That is all very fine. I know, when I have been down to his place in  the country between voyages, I have always been as well behaved as if I  had been a model mid.\"    \"Well, I have heard some tales of your doings, Bertie, that didn't seem  quite in accord with the character you give yourself.\"    \"Oh, of course I had a few larks! You cannot expect a fellow who has  been away from England for a year to walk about as soberly as if he  were a Methodist parson!\"    \"No, I should not expect that, Bertie. But, on the other hand, I should  hardly have expected that he would, for example, risk breaking his neck  by climbing up to the top of the steeple and fastening a straw-hat on  the head of the weathercock.\"    \"It gave it a very ornamental appearance; and that weathercock was  never before watched so regularly by the people of the village as it  was from that time till the hat was blown away in a gale.\"    \"That I can quite believe. Still, Mr. Barnett told me that the rector  lodged a complaint about it.\"    \"He might complain as much as he liked; there is no law in the land, as  far as I know, that makes the fixing of a straw-hat upon a weathercock  a penal offence. It did no end of good in the village, gave them  something to talk about, and woke them up wonderfully.\"    \"And there were other things too, I think,\" his brother went on.    \"Oh, well, you need not go into them now! they are an old story.  Besides, I fancy I have heard of various tricks played by Mr.  Midshipman Harry Prendergast, and, as I heard them from your lips, I  cannot doubt but that they were strictly veracious. Well, this is jolly  now. When are we going to begin to get our outfit?\"    \"We will lose no time about that. But really there is not much to  get--a couple of good rifles and two brace of pistols, with a good  store of ammunition, those clothes you have just bought, and two or  three suits of duck for the voyage. I shan't get any special kit until  we arrive there, and can take the advice of people at Lima whether we  had better travel in European clothes or in those worn by the  Peruvians. Of course saddles and bridles and all that sort of thing we  can buy there, and we shall want a small tent to use when we get into  out-of-the-way places. I shall take three hundred pounds in gold. I  have no doubt we can exchange it into silver profitably; besides, it is  much more handy for carrying about. I shall go down this afternoon and  see Prosser and secure a berth.\"    \"I think you will have to arrange that with the captain. Very few of  our ships have accommodation for passengers, but the captains are  allowed to take one or two if they like.\"    \"All right! At any rate I must go to the office first. They can refer  me to the skipper if they like; that would be better than my going to  him direct.\"          CHAPTER II    THE START      Harry Prendergast went down to Leadenhall Street and saw the managing  owner of the _Para_. As Bertie had anticipated, Mr. Prosser, after  hearing Harry's statement that he wished to take a passage to Callao in  the vessel advertised to start in a week's time, and that he was much  obliged to them for giving Bertie a berth as supernumerary midshipman,  said:    \"We shall certainly have pleasure in putting your brother's name on the  ship's books. He has already explained to me his desire to go out with  you; we have had every reason to be satisfied with him since he entered  our service, and he had better draw pay as usual, as his service during  the voyage will then count towards his time. As for yourself, we do not  book passengers, it is more bother than it is worth; but we have no  objection to our masters taking one or two. The addition of a mouth or  so practically makes very little difference in the amount of ships'  stores consumed.

She  got up at once, wiped her eyes, and started upon a fresh quest.    This time, although she did not find what she hoped, she found what was  next best: she did not come on a stair that went up, but she came upon  one that went down.  It was evidently not the stair she had come up,  yet it was a good deal better than none; so down she went, and was  singing merrily before she reached the bottom. There, to her surprise,  she found herself in the kitchen.  Although she was not allowed to go  there alone, her nurse had often taken her, and she was a great  favourite with the servants.  So there was a general rush at her the  moment she appeared, for every one wanted to have her; and the report  of where she was soon reached the nurse's ears.  She came at once to  fetch her; but she never suspected how she had got there, and the  princess kept her own counsel.    Her failure to find the old lady not only disappointed her, but made  her very thoughtful.  Sometimes she came almost to the nurse's opinion  that she had dreamed all about her; but that fancy never lasted very  long.  She wondered much whether she should ever see her again, and  thought it very sad not to have been able to find her when she  particularly wanted her.  She resolved to say nothing more to her nurse  on the subject, seeing it was so little in her power to prove her words.        CHAPTER 6    The Little Miner    The next day the great cloud still hung over the mountain, and the rain  poured like water from a full sponge.  The princess was very fond of  being out of doors, and she nearly cried when she saw that the weather  was no better.  But the mist was not of such a dark dingy grey; there  was light in it; and as the hours went on it grew brighter and  brighter, until it was almost too brilliant to look at; and late in the  afternoon the sun broke out so gloriously that Irene clapped her hands,  crying:    'See, see, Lootie!  The sun has had his face washed.  Look how bright  he is!  Do get my hat, and let us go out for a walk.  Oh, dear! oh,  dear! how happy I am!'    Lootie was very glad to please the princess.  She got her hat and  cloak, and they set out together for a walk up the mountain; for the  road was so hard and steep that the water could not rest upon it, and  it was always dry enough for walking a few minutes after the rain  ceased.  The clouds were rolling away in broken pieces, like great,  overwoolly sheep, whose wool the sun had bleached till it was almost  too white for the eyes to bear.  Between them the sky shone with a  deeper and purer blue, because of the rain.  The trees on the roadside  were hung all over with drops, which sparkled in the sun like jewels.  The only things that were no brighter for the rain were the brooks that  ran down the mountain; they had changed from the clearness of crystal  to a muddy brown; but what they lost in colour they gained in sound--or  at least in noise, for a brook when it is swollen is not so musical as  before.  But Irene was in raptures with the great brown streams  tumbling down everywhere; and Lootie shared in her delight, for she too  had been confined to the house for three days.    At length she observed that the sun was getting low, and said it was  time to be going back.  She made the remark again and again, but, every  time, the princess begged her to go on just a little farther and a  little farther; reminding her that it was much easier to go downhill,  and saying that when they did turn they would be at home in a moment.  So on and on they did go, now to look at a group of ferns over whose  tops a stream was pouring in a watery arch, now to pick a shining stone  from a rock by the wayside, now to watch the flight of some bird.  Suddenly the shadow of a great mountain peak came up from behind, and  shot in front of them.  When the nurse saw it, she started and shook,  and catching hold of the princess's hand turned and began to run down  the hill.    'What's all the haste, nursie?' asked Irene, running alongside of her.    'We must not be out a moment longer.'    'But we can't help being out a good many moments longer.'    It was too true.  The nurse almost cried.  They were much too far from  home.  It was against express orders to be out with the princess one  moment after the sun was down; and they were nearly a mile up the  mountain!  If His Majesty, Irene's papa, were to hear of it, Lootie  would certainly be dismissed; and to leave the princess would break her  heart.  It was no wonder she ran.  But Irene was not in the least  frightened, not knowing anything to be frightened at.  She kept on  chattering as well as she could, but it was not easy.    'Lootie! Lootie! why do you run so fast?  It shakes my teeth when I  talk.'    'Then don't talk,' said Lootie.    'But the princess went on talking.  She was always saying: 'Look, look,  Lootie!' but Lootie paid no more heed to anything she said, only ran on.    'Look, look, Lootie!  Don't you see that funny man peeping over the  rock?'    Lootie only ran the faster.  They had to pass the rock, and when they  came nearer, the princess saw it was only a lump of the rock itself  that she had taken for a man.    'Look, look, Lootie!  There's such a curious creature at the foot of  that old tree.  Look at it, Lootie!  It's making faces at us, I do  think.'    Lootie gave a stifled cry, and ran faster still--so fast that Irene's  little legs could not keep up with her, and she fell with a crash.  It  was a hard downhill road, and she had been running very fast--so it was  no wonder she began to cry.  This put the nurse nearly beside herself;  but all she could do was to run on, the moment she got the princess on  her feet again.    'Who's that laughing at me?' said the princess, trying to keep in her  sobs, and running too fast for her grazed knees.    'Nobody, child,' said the nurse, almost angrily.    But that instant there came a burst of coarse tittering from somewhere  near, and a hoarse indistinct voice that seemed to say: 'Lies! lies!  lies!'    'Oh!' cried the nurse with a sigh that was almost a scream, and ran on  faster than ever.    'Nursie! Lootie! I can't run any more.  Do let us walk a bit.'    'What am I to do?' said the nurse.  'Here, I will carry you.'    She caught her up; but found her much too heavy to run with, and had to  set her down again.  Then she looked wildly about her, gave a great  cry, and said:    'We've taken the wrong turning somewhere, and I don't know where we  are.  We are lost, lost!'    The terror she was in had quite bewildered her.  It was true enough  they had lost the way.  They had been running down into a little valley  in which there was no house to be seen.    Now Irene did not know what good reason there was for her nurse's  terror, for the servants had all strict orders never to mention the  goblins to her, but it was very discomposing to see her nurse in such a  fright.  Before, however, she had time to grow thoroughly alarmed like  her, she heard the sound of whistling, and that revived her.  Presently  she saw a boy coming up the road from the valley to meet them.  He was  the whistler; but before they met his whistling changed to singing.  And this is something like what he sang:      'Ring! dod! bang!    Go the hammers' clang!    Hit and turn and bore!    Whizz and puff and roar!    Thus we rive the rocks,    Force the goblin locks.--    See the shining ore!    One, two, three--    Bright as gold can be!    Four, five, six--    Shovels, mattocks, picks!    Seven, eight, nine--    Light your lamp at mine.    Ten, eleven, twelve--    Loosely hold the helve.    We're the merry miner-boys,    Make the goblins hold their noise.'      'I wish YOU would hold your noise,' said the nurse rudely, for the very  word GOBLIN at such a time and in such a place made her tremble.  It  would bring the goblins upon them to a certainty, she thought, to defy  them in that way.  But whether the boy heard her or not, he did not  stop his singing.        'Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen--    This is worth the siftin';    Sixteen, seventeen, eighteen--    There's the match, and lay't in.    Nineteen, twenty--    Goblins in a plenty.'      'Do be quiet,' cried the nurse, in a whispered shriek.  But the boy,  who was now close at hand, still went on.      'Hush! scush! scurry!    There you go in a hurry!    Gobble! gobble! goblin!    There you go a wobblin';    Hobble, hobble, hobblin'--    Cobble! cobble! cobblin'!    Hob-bob-goblin!--    Huuuuuh!'      'There!' said the boy, as he stood still opposite them.  'There!  that'll do for them.  They can't bear singing, and they can't stand  that song.  They can't sing themselves, for they have no more voice  than a crow; and they don't like other people to sing.'    The boy was dressed in a miner's dress, with a curious cap on his head.  He was a very nice-looking boy, with eyes as dark as the mines in which  he worked and as sparkling as the crystals in their rocks.  He was  about twelve years old.  His face was almost too pale for beauty, which  came of his being so little in the open air and the sunlight--for even  vegetables grown in the dark are white; but he looked happy, merry  indeed--perhaps at the thought of having routed the goblins; and his  bearing as he stood before them had nothing clownish or rude about it.    'I saw them,' he went on, 'as I came up; and I'm very glad I did. I  knew they were after somebody, but I couldn't see who it was. They  won't touch you so long as I'm with you.'    'Why, who are you?' asked the nurse, offended at the freedom with which  he spoke to them.    'I'm Peter's son.'    'Who's Peter?'    'Peter the miner.'    'I don't know him.' 'I'm his son, though.'    'And why should the goblins mind you, pray?'    'Because I don't mind them.  I'm used to them.'    'What difference does that make?'    'If you're not afraid of them, they're afraid of you.  "]]]
