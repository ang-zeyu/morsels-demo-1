The work which the Duke of Wellington in part performed has now,  therefore, to be completed also. He met the half difficulty; we have to  surmount the whole one. We have to frame such tacit rules, to establish  such ruling but unenacted customs, as will make the House of Lords  yield to the Commons when and as often as our new Constitution requires  that it should yield. I shall be asked, How often is that, and what is  the test by which you know it? I answer that the House of Lords must  yield whenever the opinion of the Commons is also the opinion of the  nation, and when it is clear that the nation has made up its mind.  Whether or not the nation has made up its mind is a question to be  decided by all the circumstances of the case, and in the common way in  which all practical questions are decided. There are some people who  lay down a sort of mechanical test; they say the House of Lords should  be at liberty to reject a measure passed by the Commons once or more,  and then if the Commons send it up again and again, infer that the  nation is determined. But no important practical question in real life  can be uniformly settled by a fixed and formal rule in this way. This  rule would prove that the Lords might have rejected the Reform Act of  1832. Whenever the nation was both excited and determined, such a rule  would be an acute and dangerous political poison. It would teach the  House of Lords that it might shut its eyes to all the facts of real  life and decide simply by an abstract formula. If in 1832 the Lords had  so acted, there would have been a revolution. Undoubtedly there is a  general truth in the rule. Whether a bill has come up once only, or  whether it has come up several times, is one important fact in judging  whether the nation is determined to have that measure enacted; it is an  indication, but it is only one of the indications. There are others  equally decisive. The unanimous voice of the people may be so strong,  and may be conveyed through so many organs, that it may be assumed to  be lasting.    Englishmen are so very miscellaneous, that that which has REALLY  convinced a great and varied majority of them for the present may  fairly be assumed to be likely to continue permanently to convince  them. One sort might easily fall into a temporary and erroneous  fanaticism, but all sorts simultaneously are very unlikely to do so.    I should venture so far as to lay down for an approximate rule, that  the House of Lords ought, on a first-class subject, to be slow--very  slow--in rejecting a Bill passed even once by a large majority of the  House of Commons. I would not of course lay this down as an unvarying  rule; as I have said, I have for practical purposes no belief in  unvarying rules. Majorities may be either genuine or fictitious, and if  they are not genuine, if they do not embody the opinion of the  representative as well as the opinion of the constituency, no one would  wish to have any attention paid to them. But if the opinion of the  nation be strong and be universal, if it be really believed by members  of Parliament, as well as by those who send them to Parliament, in my  judgment the Lords should yield at once, and should not resist it.    My main reason is one which has not been much urged. As a theoretical  writer I can venture to say, what no elected member of Parliament,  Conservative or Liberal, can venture to say, that I am exceedingly  afraid of the ignorant multitude of the new constituencies. I wish to  have as great and as compact a power as possible to resist it. But a  dissension between the Lords and Commons divides that resisting power;  as I have explained, the House of Commons still mainly represents the  plutocracy, the Lords represent the aristocracy. The main interest of  both these classes is now identical, which is to prevent or to mitigate  the rule of uneducated numbers. But to prevent it effectually, they  must not quarrel among themselves; they must not bid one against the  other for the aid of their common opponent. And this is precisely the  effect of a division between Lords and Commons. The two great bodies of  the educated rich go to the constituencies to decide between them, and  the majority of the constituencies now consist of the uneducated poor.  This cannot be for the advantage of any one.    In doing so besides the aristocracy forfeit their natural  position--that by which they would gain most power, and in which they  would do most good. They ought to be the heads of the plutocracy. In  all countries new wealth is ready to worship old wealth, if old wealth  will only let it, and I need not say that in England new wealth is  eager in its worship. Satirist after satirist has told us how quick,  how willing, how anxious are the newly-made rich to associate with the  ancient rich. Rank probably in no country whatever has so much \"market\"  value as it has in England just now. Of course there have been many  countries in which certain old families, whether rich or poor, were  worshipped by whole populations with a more intense and poetic homage;  but I doubt if there has ever been any in which all old families and  all titled families received more ready observance from those who were  their equals, perhaps their superiors, in wealth, their equals in  culture, and their inferiors only in descent and rank. The possessors  of the \"material\" distinctions of life, as a political economist would  class them, rush to worship those who possess the immaterial  distinctions. Nothing can be more politically useful than such homage,  if it be skilfully used; no folly can be idler than to repel and reject  it.    The worship is the more politically important because it is the worship  of the political superior for the political inferior. At an election  the non-titled are much more powerful than the titled. Certain  individual peers have, from their great possessions, great  electioneering influence, but, as a whole, the House of Peers is not a  principal electioneering force. It has so many poor men inside it, and  so many rich men outside it, that its electioneering value is impaired.  Besides, it is in the nature of the curious influence of rank to work  much more on men singly than on men collectively; it is an influence  which most men--at least most Englishmen--feel very much, but of which  most Englishmen are somewhat ashamed. Accordingly, when any number of  men are collected together, each of whom worships rank in his heart,  the whole body will patiently hear--in many cases will cheer and  approve--some rather strong speeches against rank. Each man is a little  afraid that his \"sneaking kindness for a lord,\" as Mr. Gladstone put  it, be found out; he is not sure how far that weakness is shared by  those around him. And thus Englishmen easily find themselves committed  to anti-aristocratic sentiments which are the direct opposite of their  real feeling, and their collective action may be bitterly hostile to  rank while the secret sentiment of each separately is especially  favourable to rank. In 1832 the close boroughs, which were largely held  by peers, and were still more largely supposed to be held by them, were  swept away with a tumult of delight; and in another similar time of  great excitement, the Lords themselves, if they deserve it, might pass  away. The democratic passions gain by fomenting a diffused excitement,  and by massing men in concourses; the aristocratic sentiments gain by  calm and quiet, and act most on men by themselves, in their families,  and when female influence is not absent. The overt electioneering power  of the Lords does not at all equal its real social power. The English  plutocracy, as is often said of something yet coarser, must be  \"humoured, not drove\"; they may easily be impelled against the  aristocracy, though they respect it very much; and as they are much  stronger than the aristocracy, they might, if angered, even destroy it;  though in order to destroy it, they must help to arouse a wild  excitement among the ignorant poor, which, if once roused, may not be  easily calmed, and which may be fatal to far more than its beginners  intend.    This is the explanation of the anomaly which puzzles many clever lords.  They think, if they do not say, \"Why are we pinned up here? Why are we  not in the Commons where we could have so much more power? Why is this  nominal rank given us, at the price of substantial influence? If we  prefer real weight to unreal prestige, why may we not have it?\" The  reply is, that the whole body of the Lords have an incalculably greater  influence over society while there is still a House of Lords, than they  would have if the House of Lords were abolished; and that though one or  two clever young peers might do better in the Commons, the old order of  peers, young and old, clever and not clever, is much better where it  is. The selfish instinct of the mass of peers on this point is a keener  and more exact judge of the real world than the fine intelligence of  one or two of them.    If the House of Peers ever goes, it will go in a storm, and the storm  will not leave all else as it is. It will not destroy the House of  Peers and leave the rich young peers, with their wealth and their  titles, to sit in the Commons. It would probably sweep all titles  before it--at least all legal titles--and somehow or other it would  break up the curious system by which the estates of great families all  go to the eldest son. That system is a very artificial one; you may  make a fine argument for it, but you cannot make a loud argument, an  argument which would reach and rule the multitude. The thing looks like  injustice, and in a time of popular passion it would not stand. Much  short of the compulsory equal division of the Code Napoleon, stringent  clauses might be provided to obstruct and prevent these great  aggregations of property. Few "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4352"],[0,"Laughter: An Essay on the Meaning of the Comic (#4)"],[1," it  expresses, just as the sunny promise of a warm day manifests itself in  the haze of a spring morning. But a comic expression of the face is one  that promises nothing more than it gives. It is a unique and permanent  grimace. One would say that the person's whole moral life has  crystallised into this particular cast of features. This is the reason  why a face is all the more comic, the more nearly it suggests to us the  idea of some simple mechanical action in which its personality would  for ever be absorbed. Some faces seem to be always engaged in weeping,  others in laughing or whistling, others, again, in eternally blowing an  imaginary trumpet, and these are the most comic faces of all. Here  again is exemplified the law according to which the more natural the  explanation of the cause, the more comic is the effect. Automatism,  inelasticity, habit that has been contracted and maintained, are  clearly the causes why a face makes us laugh. But this effect gains in  intensity when we are able to connect these characteristics with some  deep-seated cause, a certain fundamental absentmindedness, as though  the soul had allowed itself to be fascinated and hypnotised by the  materiality of a simple action.    We shall now understand the comic element in caricature. However  regular we may imagine a face to be, however harmonious its lines and  supple its movements, their adjustment is never altogether perfect:  there will always be discoverable the signs of some impending bias, the  vague suggestion of a possible grimace, in short some favourite  distortion towards which nature seems to be particularly inclined. The  art of the caricaturist consists in detecting this, at times,  imperceptible tendency, and in rendering it visible to all eyes by  magnifying it. He makes his models grimace, as they would do themselves  if they went to the end of their tether. Beneath the skin-deep harmony  of form, he divines the deep-seated recalcitrance of matter. He  realises disproportions and deformations which must have existed in  nature as mere inclinations, but which have not succeeded in coming to  a head, being held in check by a higher force. His art, which has a  touch of the diabolical, raises up the demon who had been overthrown by  the angel. Certainly, it is an art that exaggerates, and yet the  definition would be very far from complete were exaggeration alone  alleged to be its aim and object, for there exist caricatures that are  more lifelike than portraits, caricatures in which the exaggeration is  scarcely noticeable, whilst, inversely, it is quite possible to  exaggerate to excess without obtaining a real caricature. For  exaggeration to be comic, it must not appear as an aim, but rather as a  means that the artist is using in order to make manifest to our eyes  the distortions which he sees in embryo. It is this process of  distortion that is of moment and interest. And that is precisely why we  shall look for it even in those elements of the face that are incapable  of movement, in the curve of a nose or the shape of an ear. For, in our  eyes, form is always the outline of a movement. The caricaturist who  alters the size of a nose, but respects its ground plan, lengthening  it, for instance, in the very direction in which it was being  lengthened by nature, is really making the nose indulge in a grin.  Henceforth we shall always look upon the original as having determined  to lengthen itself and start grinning. In this sense, one might say  that Nature herself often meets with the successes of a caricaturist.  In the movement through which she has slit that mouth, curtailed that  chin and bulged out that cheek, she would appear to have succeeded in  completing the intended grimace, thus outwitting the restraining  supervision of a more reasonable force. In that case, the face we laugh  at is, so to speak, its own caricature.    To sum up, whatever be the doctrine to which our reason assents, our  imagination has a very clear-cut philosophy of its own: in every human  form it sees the effort of a soul which is shaping matter, a soul which  is infinitely supple and perpetually in motion, subject to no law of  gravitation, for it is not the earth that attracts it. This soul  imparts a portion of its winged lightness to the body it animates: the  immateriality which thus passes into matter is what is called  gracefulness. Matter, however, is obstinate and resists. It draws to  itself the ever-alert activity of this higher principle, would fain  convert it to its own inertia and cause it to revert to mere  automatism. It would fain immobilise the intelligently varied movements  of the body in stupidly contracted grooves, stereotype in permanent  grimaces the fleeting expressions of the face, in short imprint on the  whole person such an attitude as to make it appear immersed and  absorbed in the materiality of some mechanical occupation instead of  ceaselessly renewing its vitality by keeping in touch with a living  ideal. Where matter thus succeeds in dulling the outward life of the  soul, in petrifying its movements and thwarting its gracefulness, it  achieves, at the expense of the body, an effect that is comic. If,  then, at this point we wished to define the comic by comparing it with  its contrary, we should have to contrast it with gracefulness even more  than with beauty. It partakes rather of the unsprightly than of the  unsightly, of RIGIDNESS rather than of UGLINESS.      IV    We will now pass from the comic element in FORMS to that in GESTURES  and MOVEMENTS. Let us at once state the law which seems to govern all  the phenomena of this kind. It may indeed be deduced without any  difficulty from the considerations stated above. THE ATTITUDES,  GESTURES AND MOVEMENTS OF THE HUMAN BODY ARE LAUGHABLE IN EXACT  PROPORTION AS THAT BODY REMINDS US OF A MERE MACHINE. There is no need  to follow this law through the details of its immediate applications,  which are innumerable. To verify it directly, it would be sufficient to  study closely the work of comic artists, eliminating entirely the  element of caricature, and omitting that portion of the comic which is  not inherent in the drawing itself. For, obviously, the comic element  in a drawing is often a borrowed one, for which the text supplies all  the stock-in-trade. I mean that the artist may be his own understudy in  the shape of a satirist, or even a playwright, and that then we laugh  far less at the drawings themselves than at the satire or comic  incident they represent. But if we devote our whole attention to the  drawing with the firm resolve to think of nothing else, we shall  probably find that it is generally comic in proportion to the  clearness, as well as the subtleness, with which it enables us to see a  man as a jointed puppet. The suggestion must be a clear one, for inside  the person we must distinctly perceive, as though through a glass, a  set-up mechanism. But the suggestion must also be a subtle one, for the  general appearance of the person, whose every limb has been made rigid  as a machine, must continue to give us the impression of a living  being. The more exactly these two images, that of a person and that of  a machine, fit into each other, the more striking is the comic effect,  and the more consummate the art of the draughtsman. The originality of  a comic artist is thus expressed in the special kind of life he imparts  to a mere puppet.    We will, however, leave on one side the immediate application of the  principle, and at this point insist only on the more remote  consequences. The illusion of a machine working in the inside of the  person is a thing that only crops up amid a host of amusing effects;  but for the most part it is a fleeting glimpse, that is immediately  lost in the laughter it provokes. To render it permanent, analysis and  reflection must be called into play.    In a public speaker, for instance, we find that gesture vies with  speech. Jealous of the latter, gesture closely dogs the speaker's  thought, demanding also to act as interpreter. Well and good; but then  it must pledge itself to follow thought through all the phases of its  development. An idea is something that grows, buds, blossoms and ripens  from the beginning to the end of a speech. It never halts, never  repeats itself. It must be changing every moment, for to cease to  change would be to cease to live. Then let gesture display a like  animation! Let it accept the fundamental law of life, which is the  complete negation of repetition! But I find that a certain movement of  head or arm, a movement always the same, seems to return at regular  intervals. If I notice it and it succeeds in diverting my attention, if  I wait for it to occur and it occurs when I expect it, then  involuntarily I laugh. Why? Because I now have before me a machine that  works automatically. This is no longer life, it is automatism  established in life and imitating it. It belongs to the comic.    This is also the reason why gestures, at which we never dreamt of  laughing, become laughable when imitated by another individual. The  most elaborate explanations have been offered for this extremely simple  fact. A little reflection, however, will show that our mental state is  ever changing, and that if our gestures faithfully followed these inner  movements, if they were as fully alive as we, they would never repeat  themselves, and so would keep imitation at bay. We begin, then, to  become imitable only when we cease to be ourselves. I mean our gestures  can only be imitated in their mechanical uniformity, and therefore  exactly in what is alien to our living personality. To imitate any one  is to bring out the element of automatism he has allowed to creep into  his person. And as this is the very essence of the ludicrous, it is no  wonder that imitation gives rise to laughter.    Still, if the imitation of gestures is intrinsically laughable, it will"]]]
