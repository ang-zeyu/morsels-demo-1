Aside from the short season, Berlin is rather dull; Bismarck  characterised it as a \"desert of bricks and newspapers.\"    In addition to making visits to the royalties, custom required  me to call first upon the Imperial Chancellor and the Minister  of Foreign Affairs. The other ministers are supposed to call  first, although I believe the redoubtable von Tirpitz claimed  a different rule. So, during the first winter I gradually made  the acquaintance of those people who sway the destinies of the  German Empire and its seventy millions.    I dined with the Emperor and had long conversations with him on  New Year's Day and at the two court balls.    All during this winter Germans from the highest down tried to  impress me with the great danger which they said threatened America  from Japan. The military and naval attachés and I were told that  the German information system sent news that Mexico was full  of Japanese colonels and America of Japanese spies. Possibly  much of the prejudice in America against the Japanese was cooked  up by the German propagandists whom we later learned to know  so well.    It is noteworthy that during the whole of my first winter in  Berlin I was not officially or semi-officially afforded an  opportunity to meet any of the members of the Reichstag or any  of the leaders in the business world. The great merchants, whose  acquaintance I made, as well as the literary and artistic people,  I had to seek out; because most of them were not _hoffähig_  and I did not come in contact with them at any court functions,  official dinners or even in the houses of the court nobles or  those connected with the government.    A very interesting character whom I met during the first winter  and often conversed with, was Prince Henkel-Donnersmarck. Prince  Donnersmarck, who died December, 1916, at the age of eighty-six  years, was the richest male subject in Germany, the richest subject  being Frau von Krupp-Böhlen, the heiress of the Krupp cannon  foundry. He was the first governor of Lorraine during the war of  1870 and had had a finger in all of the political and commercial  activities of Germany for more than half a century. He told me, on  one occasion, that he had advocated exacting a war indemnity of  thirty milliards from France after the war of 1870, and said that  France could easily pay it--and that that sum or much more should  be exacted as an indemnity at the conclusion of the World War of  1914. He said that he had always advocated a protective tariff  for agricultural products in Germany as well as encouragement of  the German manufacturing interests: that agriculture was necessary  to the country in order to provide strong soldiers for war, and  manufacturing industries to provide money to pay for the army and  navy and their equipment. He made me promise to take his second  son to America in order that he might see American life, and the  great iron and coal districts of Pennsylvania. Of course, most  of these conversations took place before the World War. After  two years of that war and, as prospects of paying the expenses  of the war from the indemnities to be exacted from the enemies  of Germany gradually melted away, the Prince quite naturally  developed a great anxiety as to how the expenses of the war should  be paid by Germany; and I am sure that this anxiety had much to  do with his death at the end of the year, 1916.    Custom demanded that I should ask for an appointment and call on  each of the Ambassadors on arrival. The British Ambassador was  Sir Edward Goschen, a man of perhaps sixty-eight years, a widower.  He spoke French, of course, and German; and, accompanied by his  dog, was a frequent visitor at our house. I am very grateful  for the help and advice he so generously gave me--doubly valuable  as coming from a man of his fame and experience. Jules Cambon was  the Ambassador of France. His brother, Paul, is Ambassador to  the Court of St. James. Jules Cambon is well-known to Americans,  having passed five years in this country. He was Ambassador to  Spain for five years, and, at the time of my arrival, had been  about the same period at Berlin. In spite of his long residence  in each of these countries, he spoke only French; but he possessed  a really marvellous insight into the political life of each of  these nations. Bollati, the Italian Ambassador, was a great admirer  of Germany; he spoke German well and did everything possible  to keep Italy out of war with her former Allies in the Triple  Alliance.    Spain was represented by Polo de Bernabe, who now represents  the interests of the United States in Germany, as well as those  of France, Russia, Belgium, Serbia and Roumania. It is a curious  commentary on the absurdity of war that, on leaving Berlin, I  handed over the interests of the United States to this Ambassador,  who, as Spanish minister to the United States, was handed his  passports at the outbreak of the Spanish-American war! I am sure  that not only he, but all his Embassy, will devotedly represent  our interests in Germany. Sverbeeu represented the interests  of Russia; Soughimoura, Japan; and Mouktar Pascha, Turkey. The  wife of the latter was a daughter of the Khedive of Egypt, and  Mouktar Pascha himself a general of distinction in the Turkish  army.    An Ambassador must keep on intimate terms with his colleagues.  It is often through them that he learns of important matters  affecting his own country or others. All of these Ambassadors  and most of the Ministers occupied handsome houses furnished  by their government. They had large salaries and a fund for  entertaining.    During this first winter before the war, I saw a great deal of  the German Crown Prince as well as of several of his brothers.    I cannot subscribe to the general opinion of the Crown Prince. I  found him a most agreeable man, a sharp observer and the possessor  of intellectual attainments of no mean order. He is undoubtedly  popular in Germany, excelling in all sports, a fearless rider  and a good shot. He is ably seconded by the Crown Princess. The  mother of the Crown Princess is a Russian Grand Duchess, and  her father was a Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. She is a very  beautiful woman made popular by her affable manners. The one  defect of the Crown Prince has been his eagerness for war; but,  as he has characterised this war as the most stupid ever waged  in history, perhaps he will be satisfied, if he comes to the  throne, with what all Germany has suffered in this conflict.    The Crown Prince was very anxious, before the war, to visit the  United States; and we had practically arranged to make a trip  to Alaska in search of some of the big game there, with stops  at the principal cities of America.    The second son of the Kaiser, Prince Eitel Fritz, is considered  by the Germans to have distinguished himself most in this war.  He is given credit for great personal bravery.    Prince Adalbert, the sailor prince, is quite American in his  manners. In February, 1914, the Crown Prince and Princes Eitel  Fritz and Adalbert came to our Embassy for a very small dance to  which were asked all the pretty American girls then in Berlin.    It is never the custom to invite royalties to an entertainment.  They invite themselves to a dance or a dinner, and the list of  proposed guests is always submitted to them. When a royalty arrives  at the house, the host (and the hostess, if the royalty be a  woman) always waits at the front door and escorts the royalties  up-stairs. Allison Armour also gave a dance at which the Crown  Prince was present, following a dinner at the Automobile Club.  Armour has been a constant visitor to Germany for many years,  usually going in his yacht to Kiel in summer and to Corfu, where  the Emperor goes, in winter. As he has never tried to obtain  anything from the Emperor, he has become quite intimate with him  and with all the members of the royal family.    The Chancellor, von Bethmann-Hollweg, is an enormous man of perhaps  six feet five or six. He comes of a banking family in Frankfort.  It is too soon to give a just estimate of his acts in this war.  When I arrived in Berlin and until November, 1916, von Jagow  was Minister of Foreign Affairs. In past years he had occupied  the post of Ambassador to Italy, and with great reluctance took  his place at the head of the Foreign Office. Zimmermann was  an Under Secretary, succeeding von Jagow when the latter was  practically forced out of office. Zimmermann, on account of his  plain and hearty manners and democratic air, was more of a favourite  with the Ambassadors and members of the Reichstag than von Jagow,  who, in appearance and manner, was the ideal old-style diplomat  of the stage.    Von Jagow was not a good speaker and the agitation against him  was started by those who claimed that, in answering questions  in the Reichstag, he did not make a forceful enough appearance  on behalf of the government. Von Jagow did not cultivate the  members of the Reichstag and his delicate health prevented him  from undertaking more than the duties of his office.    As a matter of fact, I believe that von Jagow had a juster estimate  of foreign nations than Zimmermann, and more correctly divined the  thoughts of the American people in this war than did his successor.  I thought that I enjoyed the personal friendship of both von  Jagow and Zimmermann and, therefore, was rather unpleasantly  surprised when I saw in the papers that Zimmermann had stated in  the Reichstag that he had been compelled, from motives of policy,  to keep on friendly terms with me. I sincerely hope that what he  said on this occasion was incorrectly reported. Von Jagow, after  his fall, took charge of a hospital at Libau in the occupied  portion of Russia. This shows the devotion to duty of the Prussian  noble class, and their readiness to take up any task, however  humble,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7242"],[0,"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Part 1. (#4)"],[1,"hacked, carved, in a frightful  way; and their hair, their faces, their clothing, were caked with  black and stiffened drenchings of blood.  They were suffering  sharp physical pain, of course; and weariness, and hunger and  thirst, no doubt; and at least none had given them the comfort  of a wash, or even the poor charity of a lotion for their wounds;  yet you never heard them utter a moan or a groan, or saw them show  any sign of restlessness, or any disposition to complain.  The  thought was forced upon me: \"The rascals--_they_ have served other  people so in their day; it being their own turn, now, they were  not expecting any better treatment than this; so their philosophical  bearing is not an outcome of mental training, intellectual fortitude,  reasoning; it is mere animal training; they are white Indians.\"        CHAPTER III    KNIGHTS OF THE TABLE ROUND    Mainly the Round Table talk was monologues--narrative accounts  of the adventures in which these prisoners were captured and their  friends and backers killed and stripped of their steeds and armor.  As a general thing--as far as I could make out--these murderous  adventures were not forays undertaken to avenge injuries, nor to  settle old disputes or sudden fallings out; no, as a rule they were  simply duels between strangers--duels between people who had never  even been introduced to each other, and between whom existed no  cause of offense whatever.  Many a time I had seen a couple of boys,  strangers, meet by chance, and say simultaneously, \"I can lick you,\"  and go at it on the spot; but I had always imagined until now that  that sort of thing belonged to children only, and was a sign and  mark of childhood; but here were these big boobies sticking to it  and taking pride in it clear up into full age and beyond.  Yet there  was something very engaging about these great simple-hearted  creatures, something attractive and lovable.  There did not seem  to be brains enough in the entire nursery, so to speak, to bait  a fish-hook with; but you didn't seem to mind that, after a little,  because you soon saw that brains were not needed in a society  like that, and indeed would have marred it, hindered it, spoiled  its symmetry--perhaps rendered its existence impossible.    There was a fine manliness observable in almost every face; and  in some a certain loftiness and sweetness that rebuked your  belittling criticisms and stilled them.  A most noble benignity  and purity reposed in the countenance of him they called Sir Galahad,  and likewise in the king's also; and there was majesty and greatness  in the giant frame and high bearing of Sir Launcelot of the Lake.    There was presently an incident which centered the general interest  upon this Sir Launcelot.  At a sign from a sort of master of  ceremonies, six or eight of the prisoners rose and came forward  in a body and knelt on the floor and lifted up their hands toward  the ladies' gallery and begged the grace of a word with the queen.  The most conspicuously situated lady in that massed flower-bed  of feminine show and finery inclined her head by way of assent,  and then the spokesman of the prisoners delivered himself and his  fellows into her hands for free pardon, ransom, captivity, or death,  as she in her good pleasure might elect; and this, as he said, he  was doing by command of Sir Kay the Seneschal, whose prisoners  they were, he having vanquished them by his single might and  prowess in sturdy conflict in the field.    Surprise and astonishment flashed from face to face all over  the house; the queen's gratified smile faded out at the name of  Sir Kay, and she looked disappointed; and the page whispered in  my ear with an accent and manner expressive of extravagant derision--    \"Sir _Kay_, forsooth!  Oh, call me pet names, dearest, call me  a marine!  In twice a thousand years shall the unholy invention  of man labor at odds to beget the fellow to this majestic lie!\"    Every eye was fastened with severe inquiry upon Sir Kay. But he  was equal to the occasion.  He got up and played his hand like  a major--and took every trick.  He said he would state the case  exactly according to the facts; he would tell the simple  straightforward tale, without comment of his own; \"and then,\"  said he, \"if ye find glory and honor due, ye will give it unto him  who is the mightiest man of his hands that ever bare shield or  strake with sword in the ranks of Christian battle--even him that  sitteth there!\" and he pointed to Sir Launcelot.  Ah, he fetched  them; it was a rattling good stroke.  Then he went on and told  how Sir Launcelot, seeking adventures, some brief time gone by,  killed seven giants at one sweep of his sword, and set a hundred  and forty-two captive maidens free; and then went further, still  seeking adventures, and found him (Sir Kay) fighting a desperate  fight against nine foreign knights, and straightway took the battle  solely into his own hands, and conquered the nine; and that night  Sir Launcelot rose quietly, and dressed him in Sir Kay's armor and  took Sir Kay's horse and gat him away into distant lands, and  vanquished sixteen knights in one pitched battle and thirty-four  in another; and all these and the former nine he made to swear  that about Whitsuntide they would ride to Arthur's court and yield  them to Queen Guenever's hands as captives of Sir Kay the Seneschal,  spoil of his knightly prowess; and now here were these half dozen,  and the rest would be along as soon as they might be healed of  their desperate wounds.    Well, it was touching to see the queen blush and smile, and look  embarrassed and happy, and fling furtive glances at Sir Launcelot  that would have got him shot in Arkansas, to a dead certainty.    Everybody praised the valor and magnanimity of Sir Launcelot; and  as for me, I was perfectly amazed, that one man, all by himself,  should have been able to beat down and capture such battalions  of practiced fighters.  I said as much to Clarence; but this mocking  featherhead only said:    \"An Sir Kay had had time to get another skin of sour wine into him,  ye had seen the accompt doubled.\"    I looked at the boy in sorrow; and as I looked I saw the cloud of  a deep despondency settle upon his countenance.  I followed the  direction of his eye, and saw that a very old and white-bearded  man, clothed in a flowing black gown, had risen and was standing  at the table upon unsteady legs, and feebly swaying his ancient  head and surveying the company with his watery and wandering eye.  The same suffering look that was in the page's face was observable  in all the faces around--the look of dumb creatures who know that  they must endure and make no moan.    \"Marry, we shall have it again,\" sighed the boy; \"that same old  weary tale that he hath told a thousand times in the same words,  and that he _will_ tell till he dieth, every time he hath gotten his  barrel full and feeleth his exaggeration-mill a-working.  Would  God I had died or I saw this day!\"    \"Who is it?\"    \"Merlin, the mighty liar and magician, perdition singe him for  the weariness he worketh with his one tale!  But that men fear  him for that he hath the storms and the lightnings and all the  devils that be in hell at his beck and call, they would have dug  his entrails out these many years ago to get at that tale and  squelch it.  He telleth it always in the third person, making  believe he is too modest to glorify himself--maledictions light  upon him, misfortune be his dole!  Good friend, prithee call me  for evensong.\"    The boy nestled himself upon my shoulder and pretended to go  to sleep.  The old man began his tale; and presently the lad was  asleep in reality; so also were the dogs, and the court, the lackeys,  and the files of men-at-arms.  The droning voice droned on; a soft  snoring arose on all sides and supported it like a deep and subdued  accompaniment of wind instruments.  Some heads were bowed upon  folded arms, some lay back with open mouths that issued unconscious  music; the flies buzzed and bit, unmolested, the rats swarmed  softly out from a hundred holes, and pattered about, and made  themselves at home everywhere; and one of them sat up like a  squirrel on the king's head and held a bit of cheese in its hands  and nibbled it, and dribbled the crumbs in the king's face with  naive and impudent irreverence.  It was a tranquil scene, and  restful to the weary eye and the jaded spirit.    This was the old man's tale.  He said:    \"Right so the king and Merlin departed, and went until an hermit  that was a good man and a great leech.  So the hermit searched  all his wounds and gave him good salves; so the king was there  three days, and then were his wounds well amended that he might  ride and go, and so departed.  And as they rode, Arthur said,  I have no sword.  No force,* [*Footnote from M.T.: No matter.]  said Merlin, hereby is a sword that shall be yours and I may.  So they rode till they came to a lake, the which was a fair water  and broad, and in the midst of the lake Arthur was ware of an arm  clothed in white samite, that held a fair sword in that hand.  Lo, said Merlin, yonder is that sword that I spake of.  With that  they saw a damsel going upon the lake.  What damsel is that?  said Arthur.  That is the Lady of the lake, said Merlin; and within  that lake is a rock, and therein is as fair a place as any on earth,  and richly beseen, and this damsel will come to you anon, and then  speak ye fair to her that she will give you that sword.  Anon  withal came the damsel unto Arthur and saluted him, and he her  again.  Damsel, said Arthur, what sword is that, that yonder  the arm holdeth above the water?  I would it were mine, for I have  no sword.  Sir Arthur King, said the damsel, that sword is mine,  and if ye will give me a gift when I ask it you, ye shall have it.  By my faith, said Arthur, I will give you what gift ye will ask.  Well, said the damsel, go ye "]]]
