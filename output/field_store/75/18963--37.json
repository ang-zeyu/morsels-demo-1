BY ME, JOHN FAUSTUS.         MEPHIST. Speak, Faustus, do you deliver this as your deed?         FAUSTUS. Ay, take it, and the devil give thee good on't!         MEPHIST. Now, Faustus, ask what thou wilt.         FAUSTUS. First will I question with thee about hell.       Tell me, where is the place that men call hell?         MEPHIST. Under the heavens.         FAUSTUS. Ay, but whereabout?         MEPHIST. Within the bowels of these[90] elements,       Where we are tortur'd and remain for ever:       Hell hath no limits, nor is circumscrib'd       In one self place; for where we are is hell,       And where hell is, there[91] must we ever be:       And, to conclude, when all the world dissolves,       And every creature shall be purified,       All places shall be hell that are[92] not heaven.         FAUSTUS. Come, I think hell's a fable.         MEPHIST. Ay, think so still, till experience change thy mind.         FAUSTUS. Why, think'st thou, then, that Faustus shall be damn'd?         MEPHIST. Ay, of necessity, for here's the scroll       Wherein thou hast given thy soul to Lucifer.         FAUSTUS. Ay, and body too:  but what of that?       Think'st thou that Faustus is so fond[93] to imagine       That, after this life, there is any pain?       Tush, these are trifles and mere old wives' tales.         MEPHIST. But, Faustus, I am an instance to prove the contrary,       For I am damn'd, and am now in hell.         FAUSTUS. How! now in hell!       Nay, an this be hell, I'll willingly be damn'd here:       What! walking, disputing, &c.[94]       But, leaving off this, let me have a wife,[95]       The fairest maid in Germany;       For I am wanton and lascivious,       And cannot live without a wife.         MEPHIST. How! a wife!       I prithee, Faustus, talk not of a wife.         FAUSTUS. Nay, sweet Mephistophilis, fetch me one, for I will have       one.         MEPHIST. Well, thou wilt have one?  Sit there till I come:  I'll       fetch thee a wife in the devil's name.            [Exit.]              Re-enter MEPHISTOPHILIS with a DEVIL drest like a WOMAN,            with fire-works.         MEPHIST. Tell me,[96] Faustus, how dost thou like thy wife?         FAUSTUS. A plague on her for a hot whore!         MEPHIST. Tut, Faustus,       Marriage is but a ceremonial toy;       If thou lovest me, think no[97] more of it.       I'll cull thee out the fairest courtezans,       And bring them every morning to thy bed:       She whom thine eye shall like, thy heart shall have,       Be she as chaste as was Penelope,       As wise as Saba,[98] or as beautiful       As was bright Lucifer before his fall.       Hold, take this book, peruse it thoroughly:            [Gives book.]         The iterating[99] of these lines brings gold;       The framing of this circle on the ground       Brings whirlwinds, tempests, thunder, and lightning;       Pronounce this thrice devoutly to thyself,       And men in armour shall appear to thee,       Ready to execute what thou desir'st.         FAUSTUS. Thanks, Mephistophilis:  yet fain would I have a book       wherein I might behold all spells and incantations, that I       might raise up spirits when I please.         MEPHIST. Here they are in this book.            [Turns to them.]         FAUSTUS. Now would I have a book where I might see all characters       and planets of the heavens, that I might know their motions and       dispositions.         MEPHIST. Here they are too.            [Turns to them.]         FAUSTUS. Nay, let me have one book more,--and then I have done,--       wherein I might see all plants, herbs, and trees, that grow upon       the earth.         MEPHIST. Here they be.         FAUSTUS. O, thou art deceived.         MEPHIST. Tut, I warrant thee.            [Turns to them.]         FAUSTUS. When I behold the heavens, then I repent,       And curse thee, wicked Mephistophilis,       Because thou hast depriv'd me of those joys.         MEPHIST. Why, Faustus,       Thinkest thou heaven is such a glorious thing?       I tell thee, 'tis not half so fair as thou,       Or any man that breathes on earth.         FAUSTUS. How prov'st thou that?         MEPHIST. 'Twas made for man, therefore is man more excellent.         FAUSTUS. If it were made for man, 'twas made for me:       I will renounce this magic and repent.              Enter GOOD ANGEL and EVIL ANGEL.         GOOD ANGEL. Faustus, repent; yet God will pity thee.         EVIL ANGEL. Thou art a spirit; God cannot pity thee.         FAUSTUS. Who buzzeth in mine ears I am a spirit?       Be I a devil, yet God may pity me;       Ay, God will pity me, if I repent.         EVIL ANGEL. Ay, but Faustus never shall repent.            [Exeunt ANGELS.]         FAUSTUS. My heart's so harden'd, I cannot repent:       Scarce can I name salvation, faith, or heaven,       But fearful echoes thunder in mine ears,       \"Faustus, thou art damn'd!\" then swords, and knives,       Poison, guns, halters, and envenom'd steel       Are laid before me to despatch myself;       And long ere this I should have slain myself,       Had not sweet pleasure conquer'd deep despair.       Have not I made blind Homer sing to me       Of Alexander's love and Oenon's death?       And hath not he, that built the walls of Thebes       With ravishing sound of his melodious harp,       Made music with my Mephistophilis?       Why should I die, then, or basely despair?       I am resolv'd; Faustus shall ne'er repent.--       Come, Mephistophilis, let us dispute again,       And argue of divine astrology.[100]       Tell me, are there many heavens above the moon       Are all celestial bodies but one globe,       As is the substance of this centric earth?         MEPHIST. As are the elements, such are the spheres,       Mutually folded in each other's orb,       And, Faustus,       All jointly move upon one axletree,       Whose terminine is term'd the world's wide pole;       Nor are the names of Saturn, Mars, or Jupiter       Feign'd, but are erring[101] stars.         FAUSTUS. But, tell me, have they all one motion, both situ et       tempore?         MEPHIST. All jointly move from east to west in twenty-four hours       upon the poles of the world; but differ in their motion upon       the poles of the zodiac.         FAUSTUS. Tush,       These slender trifles Wagner can decide:       Hath Mephistophilis no greater skill?       Who knows not the double motion of the planets?       The first is finish'd in a natural day;       The second thus; as Saturn in thirty years; Jupiter in twelve;       Mars in four; the Sun, Venus, and Mercury in a year; the Moon in       twenty-eight days.  Tush, these are freshmen's[102] suppositions.       But, tell me, hath every sphere a dominion or intelligentia?         MEPHIST. Ay.         FAUSTUS. How many heavens or spheres are there?         MEPHIST. Nine; the seven planets, the firmament, and the empyreal       heaven.         FAUSTUS. Well, resolve[103] me in this question; why have we not       conjunctions, oppositions, aspects, eclipses, all at one time,       but in some years we have more, in some less?         MEPHIST. Per inoequalem motum respectu totius.         FAUSTUS. Well, I am answered.  Tell me who made the world?         MEPHIST. I will not.         FAUSTUS. Sweet Mephistophilis, tell me.         MEPHIST. Move me not, for I will not tell thee.         FAUSTUS. Villain, have I not bound thee to tell me any thing?         MEPHIST. Ay, that is not against our kingdom; but this is.  Think       thou on hell, Faustus, for thou art damned.         FAUSTUS. Think, Faustus, upon God that made the world.         MEPHIST. Remember this.            [Exit.]         FAUSTUS. Ay, go, accursed spirit, to ugly hell!       'Tis thou hast damn'd distressed Faustus' soul.       Is't not too late?              Re-enter GOOD ANGEL and EVIL ANGEL.         EVIL ANGEL. Too late.         GOOD ANGEL. Never too late, if Faustus can repent.         EVIL ANGEL. If thou repent, devils shall tear thee in pieces.         GOOD ANGEL. Repent, and they shall never raze thy skin.            [Exeunt ANGELS.]         FAUSTUS. Ah, Christ, my Saviour,       Seek to save[104] distressed Faustus' soul!              Enter LUCIFER, BELZEBUB, and MEPHISTOPHILIS.         LUCIFER. Christ cannot save thy soul, for he is just:       There's none but I have interest in the same.         FAUSTUS. O, who art thou that look'st so terrible?         LUCIFER. I am Lucifer,       And this is my companion-prince in hell.         FAUSTUS. O, Faustus, they are come to fetch away thy soul!         LUCIFER. We come to tell thee thou dost injure us;       Thou talk'st of Christ, contrary to thy promise:       Thou shouldst not think of God:  think of the devil,       And of his dam too.         FAUSTUS. Nor will I henceforth:  pardon me in this,       And Faustus vows never to look to heaven,       Never to name God, or to pray to him,       To burn his Scriptures, slay his ministers,       And make my spirits pull his churches down.         LUCIFER. Do so, and we will highly gratify thee.  Faustus, we are       come from hell to shew thee some pastime:  sit down, and thou       shalt see all the Seven Deadly Sins appear in their proper shapes.         FAUSTUS. That sight will be as pleasing unto me,       As Paradise was to Adam, the first day       Of his creation.         LUCIFER. Talk not of Paradise nor creation; but mark this show:       talk of the devil, and nothing else.--Come away!              Enter the SEVEN DEADLY SINS.[105]         Now, Faustus, examine them of their several names and dispositions.         FAUSTUS. What art thou, the first?         PRIDE. I am Pride.  I disdain to have any parents.  I am like to       Ovid's flea; I can creep into every corner of a wench; sometimes,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/781"],[0,"Sinking of the Titanic and Great Sea Disasters (#4)"],[1,"Marine, and managing  director of the White....}    {illust. caption = CHARLES M. HAYS    President of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railways, numbered among the heroic  men....}      water-tight compartments, calculated to make her unsinkable; she had  been pronounced the safest as well as the most sumptuous Atlantic liner  afloat.    There was silence just before the boat pulled out--the silence that  usually precedes the leave-taking. The heavy whistles sounded and the  splendid Titanic, her flags flying and her band playing, churned the  water and plowed heavily away.    Then the Titanic, with the people on board waving handkerchiefs and  shouting good-byes that could be heard only as a buzzing murmur on  shore, rode away on the ocean, proudly, majestically, her head up and,  so it seemed, her shoulders thrown back. If ever a vessel seemed to  throb with proud life, if ever a monster of the sea seemed to \"feel its  oats\" and strain at the leash, if ever a ship seemed to have breeding  and blue blood that would keep it going until its heart broke, that ship  was the Titanic.    And so it was only her due that as the Titanic steamed out of the harbor  bound on her maiden voyage a thousand \"God-speeds\" were wafted after  her, while every other vessel that she passed, the greatest of them  dwarfed by her colossal proportions, paid homage to the new queen  regnant with the blasts of their whistles and the shrieking of steam  sirens.      THE SHIP'S CAPTAIN      In command of the Titanic was Captain E. J. Smith, a veteran of the  seas, and admiral of the White Star Line fleet. The next six officers,  in the order of their rank, were Murdock, Lightollder,{sic} Pitman,  Boxhall, Lowe and Moody. Dan Phillips was chief wireless operator, with  Harold Bride as assistant.    From the forward bridge, fully ninety feet above the sea, peered out the  benign face of the ship's master, cool of aspect, deliberate of action,  impressive in that quality of confidence that is bred only of long  experience in command.    From far below the bridge sounded the strains of the ship's orchestra,  playing blithely a favorite air from \"The Chocolate Soldier.\" All went  as merry as a wedding bell. Indeed, among that gay ship's company were  two score or more at least for whom the wedding bells had sounded in  truth not many days before. Some were on their honeymoon tours, others  were returning to their motherland after having passed the weeks of the  honeymoon, like Colonel John Jacob Astor and his young bride, amid the  diversions of Egypt or other Old World countries.    What daring flight of imagination would have ventured the prediction  that within the span of six days that stately ship, humbled, shattered  and torn asunder, would lie two thousand fathoms deep at the bottom of  the Atlantic, that the benign face that peered from the bridge would  be set in the rigor of death and that the happy bevy of voyaging brides  would be sorrowing widows?      ALMOST IN A COLLISION    The big vessel had, however, a touch of evil fortune before she cleared  the harbor of Southampton. As she passed down stream her immense  bulk--she displaced 66,000 tons--drew the waters after her with an  irresistible suction that tore the American liner New York from her  moorings; seven steel hawsers were snapped like twine. The New York  floated toward the White Star ship, and would have rammed the new ship  had not the tugs Vulcan and Neptune stopped her and towed her back to  the quay.    When the mammoth ship touched at Cherbourg and later at Queenstown  she was again the object of a port ovation, the smaller craft doing  obeisance while thousands gazed in wonder at her stupendous proportions.  After taking aboard some additional passengers at each port, the Titanic  headed her towering bow toward the open sea and the race for a record on  her maiden voyage was begun.      NEW BURST OF SPEED EACH DAY    The Titanic made 484 miles as her first day's run, her powerful new  engines turning over at the rate of seventy revolutions. On the second  day out the speed was hit up to seventy-three revolutions and the run  for the day was bulletined as 519 miles. Still further increasing the  speed, the rate of revolution of the engines was raised to seventy-five  and the day's run was 549 miles, the best yet scheduled.    But the ship had not yet been speeded to her capacity she was capable of  turning over about seventy-eight revolutions. Had the weather conditions  been propitious, it was intended to press the great racer to the full  limit of her speed on Monday. But for the Titanic Monday never came.  FIRE IN THE COAL BUNKERS    Unknown to the passengers, the Titanic was on fire from the day she  sailed from Southampton. Her officers and crew knew it, for they had  fought the fire for days.    This story, told for the first time by the survivors of the crew, was  only one of the many thrilling tales of the fateful first voyage.    \"The Titanic sailed from Southampton on Wednesday, April 10th, at noon,\"  said J. Dilley, fireman on the Titanic.    \"I was assigned to the Titanic from the Oceanic, where I had served as  a fireman. From the day we sailed the Titanic was on fire, and my sole  duty, together with eleven other men, had been to fight that fire. We  had made no headway against it.\"      PASSENGERS IN IGNORANCE    \"Of course,\" he went on, \"the passengers knew nothing of the fire. Do  you think we'd have let them know about it? No, sir.    \"The fire started in bunker No. 6. There were hundreds of tons of coal  stored there. The coal on top of the bunker was wet, as all the coal  should have been, but down at the bottom of the bunker the coal had been  permitted to get dry.    \"The dry coal at the bottom of the pile took fire, and smoldered for  days. The wet coal on top kept the flames from coming through, but down  in the bottom of the bunkers the flames were raging.    \"Two men from each watch of stokers were tolled off, to fight that fire.  The stokers worked four hours at a time, so twelve of us were fighting  flames from the day we put out of Southampton until we hit the iceberg.    \"No, we didn't get that fire out, and among the stokers there was  talk that we'd have to empty the big coal bunkers after we'd put our  passengers off in New York, and then call on the fire-boats there to  help us put out the fire.    \"The stokers were alarmed over it, but the officers told us to keep our  mouths shut--they didn't want to alarm the passengers.\"      USUAL DIVERSION    Until Sunday, April 14th, then, the voyage had apparently been a  delightful but uneventful one. The passengers had passed the time in the  usual diversions of ocean travelers, amusing themselves in the luxurious  saloons, promenading on the boat deck, lolling at their ease in steamer  chairs and making pools on the daily runs of the steamship. The smoking  rooms and card rooms had been as well patronized as usual, and a party  of several notorious professional gamblers had begun reaping their usual  easy harvest.    As early as Sunday afternoon the officers of the Titanic must have known  that they were approaching dangerous ice fields of the kind that are  a perennial menace to the safety of steamships following the regular  transatlantic lanes off the Great Banks of Newfoundland.    AN UNHEEDED WARNING    On Sunday afternoon the Titanic's wireless operator forwarded to the  Hydrographic office in Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia and elsewhere  the following dispatch:    \"April 14.--The German steamship Amerika (Hamburg-American Line)  reports by radio-telegraph passing two large icebergs in latitude 41.27,  longitude 50.08.--Titanic, Br. S. S.\"    Despite this warning, the Titanic forged ahead Sunday night at her usual  speed--from twenty-one to twenty-five knots.        CHAPTER IV. SOME OF THE NOTABLE PASSENGERS    SKETCHES OF PROMINENT MEN AND WOMEN ON BOARD, INCLUDING MAJOR ARCHIBALD  BUTT, JOHN JACOB ASTOR, BENJAMIN GUGGENHEIM, ISIDOR STRAWS, J. BRUCE  ISMAY, GEORGE D. WIDENER, COLONEL WASHINGTON ROEBLING, 2D, CHARLES M.  HAYS, W. T. STEAD AND OTHERS    THE ship's company was of a character befitting the greatest of all  vessels and worthy of the occasion of her maiden voyage. Though the  major part of her passengers were Americans returning from abroad, there  were enrolled upon her cabin lists some of the most distinguished  names of England, as well as of the younger nation. Many of these had  purposely delayed sailing, or had hastened their departure, that they  might be among the first passengers on the great vessel.    There were aboard six men whose fortunes ran into tens of millions,  besides many other persons of international note. Among the men were  leaders in the world of commerce, finance, literature, art and the  learned professions. Many of the women were socially prominent in two  hemispheres.    Wealth and fame, unfortunately, are not proof against fate, and most  of these notable personages perished as pitiably as the more humble  steerage passengers.    The list of notables included Colonel John Jacob Astor, head of the  Astor family, whose fortune is estimated at $150,000,000; Isidor Straus,  merchant and banker ($50,000,000); J. Bruce Ismay, managing director of  the International Mercantile Marine ($40,000,000); Benjamin Guggenheim,  head of the Guggenheim family ($95,000,000): George D. Widener, son of  P. A. B. Widener, traction magnate and financier ($5,000,000); Colonel  Washington Roebling, builder of the great Brooklyn Bridge; Charles  M. Hays, president of the Grand Trunk Railway; W. T. Stead. famous  publicist; Jacques Futrelle, journalist; Henry S. Harper, of the firm  of Harper & Bros.; Henry B. Harris, theatrical manager; Major Archibald  Butt, military aide to President Taft; and Francis D. Millet, one of the  best-known American painters.
