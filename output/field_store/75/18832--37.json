[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50535"],[0,"Blood Atonement and the Origin of Plural Marriage: A Discussion (#4)"],[1,"the _Messenger and Advocate_, published  in June, 1846, volume 2, page 475, number 6. Will you kindly explain  why this same Sidney Rigdon practiced polygamy, which he so fervently  condemns? Will you kindly explain why Lyman Wight, James J. Strang,  Gladden Bishop, William Smith, and others, none of whom had much love  for President Young and did not follow him, also taught and practiced  polygamy _before plural marriage was \"introduced by President Young_.\"  If you doubt this, I will gladly furnish you with the proof. Indeed,  you may find a great deal of it in the third volume of your church  history.      THE \"SAINTS' HERALD\" AS A WITNESS    If you believe your statement to be true, will you kindly explain the  following paragraph in the _Saints Herald_, your official organ, volume  1, page 9. It would be well for you to read the entire chapter, which  is entitled \"polygamy.\" The quotation is:    \"_The death of the prophet is one fact that has been realized, although  he abhorred and repented of this iniquity (meaning 'polygamy,') before  his death. This branch of the subject we shall leave to some of our  brethren, who are qualified to explain it satisfactorily_.\"    In the same volume, page 27, what is meant by the following?    \"_He (Joseph Smith) caused the revelation on the subject ('polygamy')  to be burned, and when he voluntarily came to Nauvoo and resigned  himself into the arms of his enemies he said that he was going to  Carthage to die. At that time he also said that if it had not been for  that accursed spiritual wife doctrine, he would not have come to that.\"  Kindly read the context_.    _There is more evidence that can be produced, but if you will explain  this it may suffice_.    In the light of the knowledge I have received and the evidence at my  command, I know that the Prophet Joseph Smith made no such statement  as the above, and that he did not have the revelation burned. _There  is, however, value in the above statements from your \"Herald,\" for they  bear witness to the origin and introduction of the principle of plural  marriage, and the revelation concerning the same_.[2]      THE UTAH VISIT    In connection with this, let me call your attention to your visit to  Salt Lake City some three years ago. At that time you met President  Lorenzo Snow, a man whose veracity cannot justly be questioned; you  heard him bear his testimony to the effect that he was taught that  principle by the Prophet Joseph Smith, and that the Prophet declared  to Lorenzo Snow that he had married his sister, Eliza R. Snow. You  met and conversed with Lucy Walker Smith, and she told you that she  was married to the Prophet Joseph Smith on the first day of May,  1843, in Nauvoo, Elder William Clayton performing the ceremony. You  met Catherine Phillips Smith, who told you she was married in August,  1843, in Nauvoo, to the Patriarch Hyrum Smith, his brother Joseph the  Prophet officiating in that ceremony. You will remember that the first  wives of both these men were living at the time. I hardly think these  testimonies have passed from your memory in so brief a time. I am  personally acquainted with these women, and know that they are truthful  and honest--honorable women, whose testimonies should be believed.    In the face of all this evidence, do you think it fair and consistent  for you and your fellow believers to constantly lay at the door of  President Young the responsibility for the \"introduction of plural  marriage\" and the \"authorship\" of the above mentioned revelation?    My letter is already long, but I desire to briefly mention another item  or two.      PRESIDENT SMITH'S DENIAL    In the interview you are made to say that while on your visit to Salt  Lake City, you spent a day and a half with Joseph F. Smith; that you  and he \"differed on polygamy,\" and that you \"told him it was vile and  wicked, always had been, and always would be.\" I took occasion to ask  my father if you and he had discussed polygamy at that time and if  you had uttered that above expression or any other of like nature. He  replied that he had no discussion with you on that subject; that you  did not say one word to him in relation to polygamy, either favorable  or otherwise; that your visit was a social one, and friendly, and  was not occupied by the discussion of any differences which may have  existed.    _It is true that President Young was elected president at Kanesville,  but on what grounds do you charge him with holding the office in  trust for the \"dead president's son?\" Do you not know that such a  statement--contrary to the written word--was antagonistic to the  teachings of President Young, as recorded in the \"Times and Seasons,\"  as well as since that Time_?      PRESIDENT YOUNG THE PROPHET'S FRIEND    _Will you please explain on what grounds you charge President Young as  being \"under suspicion at the time of Joseph Smith's death?\" Am I to  infer by this that you mean to convey the idea that Brigham Young was  in any way responsible for the death of Joseph Smith? The Prophet never  had a truer friend. You know that at the time of the martyrdom Brigham  Young was on a mission away from home. If this is the inference you  wish to convey, it is not only contemptible but viciously false_.[3]    With reference to my father's first wife, you say she died \"broken  hearted and insane.\" If you mean to insinuate that this condition, if  true, was the result of any act whatever on the part of my father, it  is also scandalously false. I have good reason to believe that she died  neither broken hearted nor insane. If it were true, I would still think  that you, as a professed minister of the Gospel, might employ your time  to better advantage than as an aspersor or a scandal-monger.                                              Respectfully,                                               Joseph F. Smith, Jr.      Footnotes    1. This sentence in italics was omitted in Mr. Evans' publication of  the _entire matter_ in the _Zion's Ensign_, August 17th, 1905.    2. The quotations from the _Saints' Herald_ which are in Italics were  purposely omitted from Mr. Evans' \"publication of the entire matter,\"  as it appeared in the _Zion's Ensign_ of August 7, 1905. The reason for  the suppression of this evidence is easy to discern. The authorities of  the \"Reorganization\" have tried to destroy the evidence, that it could  not be circulated among their church members, therefore very few copies  of this particular _Herald_ can today be found.    3. These paragraphs in italics were also omitted from Mr. Evans'  \"publication of the entire matter,\" as it appeared in the _Zion's  Ensign_ August 17, 1905.        MR. EVANS' LETTER    _Mr. Joseph F. Smith, Jr.:_    Sir:--Your open letter published in the Toronto _Star_ for February 25,  is before me. You say: \"I desire to be fair, dispassionate and also  candid.\" Those who read your letter will see plainly that you have  mispresented the interview, my faith and the facts concerning my visit  to Salt Lake, and that you are guilty of a labored effort to cover up  the _true facts_ regarding \"blood atonement,\" \"polygamy,\" etc., and my  faith in the Book of Mormon. So much for those desires.    My position with regard to the Book of Mormon, and the name \"Mormon,\"  is too well known for you to blind the people concerning it. The  interview shows plainly in what sense \"the term 'Mormon' is offensive  to us.\" Read it again, sir: \"Because it is associated in the public  mind with the practices that I have specified.\" The abominations of  _Brighamism_; namely, polygamy, blood atonement, Adam-God,[1] and other  evils that have disgraced the name throughout civilization.    The true Church never has adopted the name \"Mormon\" as being the  proper name of the church. The Latter-day Saints were sometimes called  \"Mormons\" in derision, as you admit, because they believed in the  divine authenticity of the Book of Mormon, and some church members may  have been willing to be called \"Mormon\"; yet you \"candidly (?) fairly,  dispassionately\" ask me, \"Why do you not discard the Book of Mormon  from whence the name is derived?\" Now, sir, I profess to believe in the  divine authenticity of the Holy Bible; as well call me a Bible, because  I believe in the Bible,[2] as call me a Mormon because I believe in the  Book of Mormon.    The church that I have the honor to represent is incorporated under the  laws of the United States as \"The Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter Day Saints.\"      BLOOD ATONEMENT    There is not an honest thinking person on earth who is acquainted with  the faith of the church regarding the atonement of Jesus Christ but  that will say your attempt to misrepresent my faith in this regard is  diametrically opposite to your stated desire to be \"fair, dispassionate  and candid.\" You know that a prominent article in the Epitome of  the Faith and Doctrine of the _true church_ reads as follows: \"We  believe that through the atonement of Christ, all men may be saved by  obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel.\" You know that the  true church believes in the atoning blood of Christ as stated in the  scriptures you cite in your letter, and yet you try to make out that  because we do not believe in the doctrine of blood atonement as taught  by Brigham Young and his successors in \"Utah Mormonism,\" that we do not  believe in the atonement of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.    The doctrine of the atonement of Christ is far above the doctrine of  blood atonement as taught by Brighamism. To prove this, I submit the  statements as made by Brigham Young and other leading members of the  Utah Church, as found in their sermons, printed by your church:    Brigham Young said, October 9, 1852: \"What shall be done with the sheep  that stink the flock so? We will take them, I was going to say, and  cut off their tails two inches behind their ears; however I will use a  milder term, and say "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50536"],[0,"Gospel Themes: A Treatise on Salient Features of \"Mormonism\" (#4)"],[1,"was  cast out, with a third of those then populating the spirit world. That  third, following Lucifer, who became Satan, were doomed with him to  wander up and down the earth, as fallen spirits, tempting and trying  the children of men--those who, as a reward for keeping their first  estate, where they \"walked by sight,\" were given a second estate--the  privilege of taking tabernacles, and \"walking by faith\" through the  shadowed experiences of mortality.    Upon this subject the Prophet Joseph says: \"The contention in heaven  was: Jesus said there would be certain souls that would not be saved;  and the devil said he could save them all, and laid his plans before  the grand council, who gave their vote in favor of Jesus Christ. So the  devil rose up in rebellion against God, and was cast down with all who  put up their heads for him\" (\"Compendium,\" page 285).    Advantage of Having a Body.--Our prophet likewise affirms: \"At the  first organization in heaven we were all present, and saw the Savior  chosen and appointed, and the plan of salvation made, and we sanctioned  it. We came to this earth that we might have a body and present it pure  before God in the celestial kingdom. The great principle of happiness  consists in having a body. The devil has no body, and herein is his  punishment. He is pleased when he can obtain the tabernacle of man,  and when cast out by the Savior he asked to go into the herd of swine,  showing that he would prefer a swine's body to having none. All beings  who have bodies have power over those who have not\" (Ibid, page 288).    Testimony of Moses.--The following passages from our sacred writings  will here find place:    \"And I, the Lord God, spake unto Moses, saying: That Satan, whom thou  hast commanded in the name of mine Only Begotten, is the same which  was from the beginning, and he came before me, saying--Behold, here  am I, send me, I will be thy son, and I will redeem all mankind, that  one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give me  thine honor.    \"But, behold, my Beloved Son, which was my Beloved and Chosen from the  beginning, said unto me--Father, thy will be done, and the glory be  thine forever.    \"Wherefore, because that Satan rebelled against me, and sought to  destroy the agency of man, which I, the Lord God, had given him, and  also, that I should give unto him mine own power: by the power of mine  Only Begotten I caused that he should be cast down;    \"And he became Satan, yea, even the devil, the father of all lies, to  deceive and to blind men, and to lead them captive at his will, even as  many as would not hearken unto my voice.\" (Moses 4:1-4.)    Testimony of Abraham.--Still more comprehensive are the appended  paragraphs of a similar glorious revelation:    \"Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that were  organized before the world was; and among all these there were many of  the noble and great ones;    \"And God saw these souls that they were good, and he stood in the midst  of them, and he said: These I will make my rulers; for he stood among  those that were spirits, and he saw that they were good; and he said  unto me: Abraham, thou art one of them; thou wast chosen before thou  wast born.     \"And there stood one among them that was like unto God, and he said  unto those who were with him: We will go down, for there is space  there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth  whereon these may dwell;    \"And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things  whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them;    \"And they who keep their first estate shall be added upon: and they who  keep not their first estate shall not have glory in the same kingdom  with those who keep their first estate: and they who keep their second  estate shall have glory added upon their heads forever and ever.    \"And the Lord said: Whom shall I send? And one answered like unto the  Son of man: Here am I, send me. And another answered and said: Here am  I, send me. And the Lord said: I will send the first.    \"And the second was angry, and kept not his first estate: and, at that  day, many followed after him.\" (Book of Abr. 3:22-28.)    Truth Speaks for Itself.--What a sublime presentation! What a wealth of  doctrine! What a wonderful scope of prophecy! The whole divine scheme  for human progress revealed at a glance! Surely the Book of Abraham,  whose authenticity has recently been assailed by Christian scholars,  and defended by \"Mormon\" writers and speakers, can stand upon its own  merits in refutation of any argument brought against it as a divine  record. Who but God could reveal such principles as this marvelous  book contains? Who but one inspired of heaven could teach them in so  pure a spirit and in such majestic terms? Truth--eternal truth--speaks  for itself: it is not dependent upon books or translators. These are  but some of the means used in making it known to the world. It is not  limited to time and place. Whether in the catacombs of Egypt, or in the  mounds of America, whether spoken anciently or modernly,      \"Truth is truth, where'er 'tis found,    On Christian or on heathen ground.\"    \"Mormon\" Philosophy.--Note the sound philosophy of this revelation--the  divine proposition to \"make an earth,\" not out of nothing--an absurdity  put forth by Christian theologians in their teachings relative to the  creation--but out of \"materials\" already in existence, eternal spirit  and eternal matter, as never-ending as space and duration. Then ask  yourself, reader, if the \"Mormon\" doctrine, set forth in the Book of  Abraham, is not the only logical, scientific, common-sense presentation  possible or conceivable in the premises.    Note also that it was the design to \"make an earth;\" the inference  being that this was not the only earth that had been created, nor would  it be the last.    \"And then the Lord said: Let us go down. And they went down at the  beginning, and they, that is the Gods, organized and formed the heavens  and the earth\" (Abr. 4:1).        CHAPTER V.    Creation of the Earth.    Two Creations.--There were two creations--the first spiritual, the  second temporal. This truth is taught inferentially in the first and  second chapters of Genesis, King James's Translation; but more plainly  and pointedly in the Book of Moses, a reproduction of the Book of  Genesis, revised and amplified by the spirit of revelation in Joseph  the Seer. Here is the modern rendering of the passages bearing directly  upon this point:    As Related in the Book of Moses.--\"And now, behold, I say unto you,  that these are the generations of the heaven and of the earth, when  they were created, in the day that I, the Lord God, made the heaven and  the earth.    \"And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every  herb of the field before it grew. For I, the Lord God, created all  things, of which I have spoken, spiritually, before they were naturally  upon the face of the earth. For I, the Lord God, had not caused it  to rain upon the face of the earth. And I, the Lord God, had created  all the children of men; and not yet a man to till the ground; for in  heaven created I them; and there was not yet flesh upon the earth,  neither in the water, neither in the air;    \"But I, the Lord God, spake, and there went up a mist from the earth,  and watered the whole face of the ground.    \"And I, the Lord God, formed man from the dust of the ground, and  breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living  soul, the first flesh upon the earth, the first man also; nevertheless,  all things were before created; but spiritually were they created and  made according to my word.\" (Moses 3:4-7.)    Adam's Incarnation.--In the Book of Abraham the incarnation of Adam is  thus described:    \"And the Gods formed man from the dust of the ground, and took his  spirit (that is, the man's spirit) and put it into him; and breathed  into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul\"  (Abr. 5:7).    Plurality of Worlds.--Regarding this earth and other creations, the  Lord said to Moses:    \"And worlds without number have I created; and I also created them for  mine own purpose; and by the Son I created them, which is mine Only  Begotten.    \"And the first man of all men have I called Adam, which is many.    \"But only an account of this earth, and the inhabitants thereof,  give I unto you. For behold, there are many worlds that have passed  away by the word of my power. And there are many that now stand, and  innumerable are they unto man; but all things are numbered unto me, for  they are mine and I know them.\"    * * * * * * * * * * *    \"And the Lord God spake unto Moses, saying: The heavens they are many,  and they cannot be numbered unto man; but they are numbered unto me,  for they are mine.    \"And as one earth shall pass away, and the heavens thereof, even so  shall another come; and there is no end to my works; neither to my  words.    \"For behold, this is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the  immortality and eternal life of man.\"--Moses 1:33-39.    Purposes of Earth Life.--God's purpose, primarily, in placing man  upon the earth, is to give him a body, a mortal tabernacle, which is  rendered immortal through death and the resurrection. The spirit and  the body constitute the soul. It is the soul that is redeemed from the  grave (D&C 88:15,16). It is the soul that goes on to perfection. Man is  here also for experience, that he may advance from stage to stage of  growth and development, approximating nearer and nearer to the divine  ideal voiced by the Savior: \"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your  Father which is in heaven is perfect.\"--Matthew 5:48.    Man on Probation.--There is still another purpose in man's mortal  existence, and it is referred to in the Book of Abraham, where the  Creator, after announcing to \"those who were with him\" the"]]]
