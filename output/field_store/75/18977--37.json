Also the LORD telleth thee that he will make thee an             house.    10:007:012 And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy             fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall             proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.    10:007:013 He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the             throne of his kingdom for ever.    10:007:014 I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit             iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the             stripes of the children of men:    10:007:015 But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from             Saul, whom I put away before thee.    10:007:016 And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever             before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.    10:007:017 According to all these words, and according to all this             vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.    10:007:018 Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said,             Who am I, O Lord GOD? and what is my house, that thou hast             brought me hitherto?    10:007:019 And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but             thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while             to come. And is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?    10:007:020 And what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD,             knowest thy servant.    10:007:021 For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast             thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know             them.    10:007:022 Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like             thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all             that we have heard with our ears.    10:007:023 And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like             Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and             to make him a name, and to do for you great things and             terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou             redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the nations and their             gods?    10:007:024 For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be a             people unto thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their             God.    10:007:025 And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning             thy servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever,             and do as thou hast said.    10:007:026 And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of             hosts is the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant             David be established before thee.    10:007:027 For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy             servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath             thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.    10:007:028 And now, O Lord GOD, thou art that God, and thy words be true,             and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:    10:007:029 Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy             servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou,             O Lord GOD, hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the             house of thy servant be blessed for ever.    10:008:001 And after this it came to pass that David smote the             Philistines, and subdued them: and David took Methegammah out             of the hand of the Philistines.    10:008:002 And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them             down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to             death, and with one full line to keep alive. And so the             Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts.    10:008:003 David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah,             as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.    10:008:004 And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred             horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed all             the chariot horses, but reserved of them for an hundred             chariots.    10:008:005 And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer             king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty             thousand men.    10:008:006 Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians             became servants to David, and brought gifts. And the LORD             preserved David whithersoever he went.    10:008:007 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants             of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.    10:008:008 And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king             David took exceeding much brass.    10:008:009 When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the             host of Hadadezer,    10:008:010 Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him,             and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and             smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And Joram             brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and             vessels of brass:    10:008:011 Which also king David did dedicate unto the LORD, with the             silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he             subdued;    10:008:012 Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of             the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer,             son of Rehob, king of Zobah.    10:008:013 And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the             Syrians in the valley of salt, being eighteen thousand men.    10:008:014 And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he             garrisons, and all they of Edom became David's servants. And             the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.    10:008:015 And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment             and justice unto all his people.    10:008:016 And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat             the son of Ahilud was recorder;    10:008:017 And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of             Abiathar, were the priests; and Seraiah was the scribe;    10:008:018 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites             and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers.    10:009:001 And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of             Saul, that I may shew him kindness for Jonathan's sake?    10:009:002 And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was             Ziba. And when they had called him unto David, the king said             unto him, Art thou Ziba? And he said, Thy servant is he.    10:009:003 And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul,             that I may shew the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said             unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, which is lame on his             feet.    10:009:004 And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto             the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of             Ammiel, in Lodebar.    10:009:005 Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of             Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lodebar.    10:009:006 Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul,             was come unto David, he fell on his face, and did reverence.             And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold thy             servant!    10:009:007 And David said unto him, Fear not: for I will surely shew thee             kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake, and will restore thee             all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at             my table continually.    10:009:008 And he bowed himself, and said, What is thy servant, that thou             shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?    10:009:009 Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said unto             him, I have given unto thy master's son all that pertained to             Saul and to all his house.    10:009:010 Thou therefore, and thy"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8018"],[0,"The Bible, King James version, Book 18: Job (#4)"],[1,"    thine eyes.    18:011:005 But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee;    18:011:006 And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that they             are double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth             of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth.    18:011:007 Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the             Almighty unto perfection?    18:011:008 It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell;             what canst thou know?    18:011:009 The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than             the sea.    18:011:010 If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can             hinder him?    18:011:011 For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not             then consider it?    18:011:012 For vain men would be wise, though man be born like a wild             ass's colt.    18:011:013 If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands             toward him;    18:011:014 If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not             wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.    18:011:015 For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou             shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:    18:011:016 Because thou shalt forget thy misery, and remember it as             waters that pass away:    18:011:017 And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday: thou shalt             shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.    18:011:018 And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou             shalt dig about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety.    18:011:019 Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid;             yea, many shall make suit unto thee.    18:011:020 But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not             escape, and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost.    18:012:001 And Job answered and said,    18:012:002 No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you.    18:012:003 But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to             you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these?    18:012:004 I am as one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and             he answereth him: the just upright man is laughed to scorn.    18:012:005 He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised             in the thought of him that is at ease.    18:012:006 The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God             are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly.    18:012:007 But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the             fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:    18:012:008 Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes             of the sea shall declare unto thee.    18:012:009 Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath             wrought this?    18:012:010 In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the             breath of all mankind.    18:012:011 Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat?    18:012:012 With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days             understanding.    18:012:013 With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and             understanding.    18:012:014 Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he             shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.    18:012:015 Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he             sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.    18:012:016 With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver             are his.    18:012:017 He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judges             fools.    18:012:018 He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a             girdle.    18:012:019 He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.    18:012:020 He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the             understanding of the aged.    18:012:021 He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength             of the mighty.    18:012:022 He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out             to light the shadow of death.    18:012:023 He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth             the nations, and straiteneth them again.    18:012:024 He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the             earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there             is no way.    18:012:025 They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to             stagger like a drunken man.    18:013:001 Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath heard and             understood it.    18:013:002 What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto             you.    18:013:003 Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason             with God.    18:013:004 But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value.    18:013:005 O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be             your wisdom.    18:013:006 Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my             lips.    18:013:007 Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?    18:013:008 Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God?    18:013:009 Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man             mocketh another, do ye so mock him?    18:013:010 He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons.    18:013:011 Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall             upon you?    18:013:012 Your remembrances are like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies             of clay.    18:013:013 Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come             on me what will.    18:013:014 Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in             mine hand?    18:013:015 Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will             maintain mine own ways before him.    18:013:016 He also shall be my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come             before him.    18:013:017 Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.    18:013:018 Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I shall be             justified.    18:013:019 Who is he that will plead with me? for now, if I hold my             tongue, I shall give up the ghost.    18:013:020 Only do not two things unto me: then will I not hide myself             from thee.    18:013:021 Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me             afraid.    18:013:022 Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer             thou me.    18:013:023 How many are mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my             transgression and my sin.    18:013:024 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine             enemy?    18:013:025 Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue             the dry stubble?    18:013:026 For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to             possess the iniquities of my youth.    18:013:027 Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly             unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my             feet.    18:013:028 And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is             moth eaten.    18:014:001 Man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of             trouble.    18:014:002 He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also             as a shadow, and continueth not.    18:014:003 And doth thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest             me into judgment with thee?    18:014:004 Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.    18:014:005 Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are             with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;    18:014:006 Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as             an hireling, his day.    18:014:007 For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will             sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not             cease.    18:014:008 Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock             thereof die in the ground;    18:014:009 Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth             boughs like a plant.    18:014:010 But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost,             and where is he?    18:014:011 As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and             drieth up:    18:014:012 So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no             more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.    18:014:013 O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest             keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest             appoint me a set time, and remember me!    18:014:014 If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my             appointed time will I wait, till my change come.    18:014:015 Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a             desire to the work of thine hands.    18:014:016 For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my             sin?    18:014:017 My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up             mine iniquity.    18:014:018 And surely the mountains falling cometh to nought, and the             rock is removed out of his place.    18:014:019 The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which             grow out of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the             hope of man.    18:014:020 Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou             changest his countenance, and sendest him away.    18:014:021 His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are"]]]
