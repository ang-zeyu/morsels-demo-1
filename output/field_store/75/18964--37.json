[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7820"],[0,"Monitress Merle (#4)"],[1,", Muriel Burnitt walked in followed by a perfect comet's tail  of juniors, some of whom were hanging on to her arms. Each was sucking a  peppermint bull's-eye, and each wore a piece of pink ribbon pinned on to  her dress.    \"Muriel's favours!\" they explained, giggling loudly. \"We're all of us  going to vote for her. Isn't it fun?\"    Mavis glanced round for Merle, hoping her expedition to the sweet-shop  would not have made her late, and to her relief saw her sitting on the  opposite side of the room, in company with Beata and Romola Castleton,  Fay Macleod, and a number of other new girls whose acquaintance she had  evidently just made. They were passing round chocolates, and seemingly  enjoying themselves. Merle waved a hand gaily at her sister, beckoning  her to join the group, but at that moment Miss Mitchell entered the room,  and all seated themselves on the nearest available benches while the  roll-call was taken.    \"We will meet here at four o'clock for the election,\" said the mistress,  as she closed the register and dismissed the various forms to their  classrooms.    The first day of a new term always seems intolerably long, and with such  an interesting event as a ballot before them most of the girls felt the  hour and a half to drag, and turned many surreptitious glances towards  wrist watches. Merle in especial, who hated French translation, groaned  as she looked up words in the dictionary, and made several stupid  mistakes, because her thoughts were focussed on the election instead of  on the matter in hand. Once she yawned openly, and drew down a reproof  from Mademoiselle, whereupon she heaved a submissive sigh, controlled her  boredom, and went on wearily transferring the flowery sentiments of  FÃ©nelon into the English tongue. At precisely five minutes to four the  big bell clanged out a warning, dictionaries were shut, exercise-books  handed in, pencil-boxes replaced in desks, and the class filed downstairs  to the big schoolroom. Miss Pollard was not there: she was busy in the  hostel; and Miss Fanny, looking rather flustered and nervous, had  evidently given over the conduct of the meeting to Miss Mitchell, and was  present merely as a spectator. The new mistress seemed perfectly at home  and ready for the occasion. She passed round pieces of paper, inquired  whether everybody had a pencil, then made her announcements.    \"As Miss Pollard told you this morning, you are here to elect two  monitresses. Two from among the boarders have already been chosen by us,  these are Iva Westwood and Nesta Pitman, but the remaining two are to be  balloted for from among the list of candidates. As perhaps some of you  don't understand a ballot, I will tell you just what to do. I have  written on the blackboard the names of those girls who have been  nominated:    \"Muriel Burnitt.    \"Aubrey Simpson.    \"Edith Carey.    \"Mavis Ramsay.    \"Merle Ramsay.    \"What I want you to do is to write on your piece of paper the names of the  two candidates for whom you wish to vote, then fold your paper and hand  it in. You must not add your own name to it, and you have no need to tell  anybody how you voted. The whole principle of a ballot is that it is done  in secret. Are you ready? Then please begin.\"    The little ceremony was soon over, the girls scribbled rapidly, folded  their papers, and passed them along the benches to Nesta and Iva, who  collected them and gave them to Miss Mitchell.    \"It will take a short time to count the votes,\" explained the mistress.  \"Those girls who wish to go home can do so, but any who like to wait and  hear the result can stay.\"    Miss Mitchell and Miss Fanny retired to the study and the meeting broke  up. Most of the day-girls put on their hats and coats in readiness to go  home, but hung about the hall until the names should be announced. The  contingent from Chagmouth, whose car was stationed outside in the road,  and whose driver was waxing impatient, were obliged to depart without the  exciting news. Merle went as far as the gate to watch them pack into  their 'sardine-tin.' Four sat behind, and two in front with the  chauffeur, all quite radiant and thoroughly enjoying themselves.    \"Good-bye! I hope you'll win!\" said Beata, waving a hand to Merle with  difficulty, for she was tightly sandwiched between Fay and Tattie. \"We  did our best for you and Mavis. I didn't know any of those others.  Romola, have you got the books? That's all right. I was afraid we'd left  the satchel. Yes,\" (to the chauffeur) \"we're quite ready now, thanks!  Ta-ta, Merle! Good luck to you! We're off!\"    Merle, looking after the retreating car, was joined by Aubrey Simpson,  rather injured, and disconsolate.    \"I didn't know all these new girls were to have votes,\" she grumbled.  \"How can _they_ choose a monitress when they don't know anybody!  It's rather humbug, isn't it?\"    \"They know _me_\" perked Merle.    \"Did you canvass them? Oh, how mean!\"    \"Why mean? You could have done it yourself. Muriel was canvassing among  the juniors as hard as she could go.\"    \"I might have canvassed among the new boarders! Why didn't I think of  it?\" wailed Aubrey.    \"Well, really, it's your own stupid fault! Don't blame me!\" snapped  Merle.    \"Iva and Nesta said they didn't mean to ask for votes.\"    \"Well, they'd no need to. They were both jolly certain that Miss Pollard  would make them monitresses. It's easy to talk loftily when you're sure  of your innings.\"    \"Did Mavis canvass?\"    \"No--but then, of course, Mavis wouldn't!\"    \"Why not?\"    \"Oh--because she's Mavis! I can't see her doing it somehow. What a long  time Miss Mitchell and Miss Fanny are over their counting! I wish they'd  hurry up. I want to go home to tea.\"    The girls had not much longer, however, to wait.    In the course of a few minutes the new mistress entered the hall and read  out the important result.    \"The polling is as follows,\" she announced.     \"Muriel Burnitt   .    .    .  27    Mavis Ramsay     .    .    .  20    Merle Ramsay     .    .    .  19    Edith Carey      .    .    .  14    Aubrey Simpson   .    .    .  12    \"The two monitresses elected, therefore, are Muriel Burnitt and Mavis  Ramsay.\"    Some of the girls raised a cheer, others took no notice; Miss Mitchell,  who seemed in a hurry, vanished back into the study. The boarders,  hearing their tea-bell, made for the hostel.    \"Congrats, Mavis!\" said Iva, as she walked away arm-in-arm with Nesta.  \"I'm glad the lot has fallen on you. Muriel was pretty sure of a  walk-over, but it was a toss-up who was to be the fourth. I don't mind  telling you I voted for you myself. And so did Nesta, I'm sure.\"    \"It was a ballot, and I'm not going to let out whom I voted for!\"  declared Nesta. \"Some people can't keep their own secrets! All the same,  I'm glad it's you, Mavis. I wouldn't have had Aubrey a monitress for  worlds.\"    The Ramsays walked home together along the High Street to Bridge House.  Muriel Burnitt, escorted by Florrie and Viola Leach and the three little  Andrews, was on in front, pluming herself upon her victory. The Careys  had disappeared down the short cut to the Vicarage. Mavis hardly dared to  look at Merle. The latter kept her face turned away and blinked her eyes  hard. She had enough self-restraint not to weep openly in the High  Street. When they reached their own door however, she bolted through the  surgery entrance and, running into the garden, hid herself in the  summer-house, whither Mavis, after a word to Aunt Nellie, presently  followed her to offer what consolation she could.    \"It's not that I'm jealous of _you_!\" sobbed Merle stormily. \"I  wanted us both to win! What does Muriel know about a decent game of  hockey, or how to conduct a society, or run a school magazine? It's  idiotic that she should be chosen. Neither she nor Iva nor Nesta has ever  been at a big school. A precious bungle they'll make of their meetings. I  know _you'll_ be there--but you're so gentle you'll never stand up  against them, and they'll have everything their own silly way. 'The  Moorings' won't be very much changed if it's just to be run upon the same  old lines. I shan't bother to try and help. I might have done so much if  they'd elected me, but what's the use now? I'm frightfully and  frantically disappointed. If Miss Mitchell had had any sense she'd have  waited a fortnight till she got to know the girls, and then have chosen  the monitresses herself. If it's Miss Fanny's fault, I'm not friends with  her any more! Tea-time, did you say? I suppose I shall have to come in  then, though I really don't want any. Ugh! I hate everything!\"    Tea that day was a dreary affair. Uncle David was out, Aunt Nellie had a  headache so was unusually quiet, and Merle, with red eyes, sat silent and  brooding. Mavis tried desperately to make a little conversation, but it  was impossible to maintain a monologue, and she soon dropped the futile  attempt. Merle, after eating half a piece of bread and butter and  declining a chocolate biscuit, begged suddenly to be excused, and with  two big unruly tears splashing down her cheeks fled from the room.    \"Poor child! I'm afraid she's terribly disappointed,\" commented Aunt  Nellie sympathetically.    \"It seems a pity she wasn't chosen. I suppose she would have made a  splendid monitress. It's half the battle to be keen about anything.\"    Mavis agreed, passed the cake, finished her tea, picked up the dropped  stitches in Aunt Nellie's piece of knitting, carried a message to the  cook, then went out into the garden. She wanted to be alone for a little  while. There was a retired corner among the bushes by the wall  overlooking the river. She had placed a box here for a seat, and called  it her hermitage. Even Merle had not so far discovered it. It was a  retreat where she could withdraw from everybody, and be absolutely  uninterrupted and by herself. There was something about which she wished  to think in quiet.

We see, then, that in reference to content Jewish history is unique in  both its halves. In the first \"national\" period, it is the history of  a people to which the epithet \"peculiar\" has been conceded, a people  which has developed under the influence of exceptional circumstances,  and finally attained to so high a degree of spiritual perfection and  fertility that the creation of a new religious theory of life, which  eventually gained universal supremacy, neither exhausted its resources  nor ended its activity. Not only did it continue to live upon its vast  store of spiritual energy, but day by day it increased the store. In  the second \"lackland\" half, it is the instructive history of a  scattered people, organically one, in spite of dispersion, by reason  of its unshaken ideal traditions; a people accepting misery and  hardship with stoic calm, combining the characteristics of the thinker  with those of the sufferer, and eking out existence under conditions  which no other nation has found adequate, or, indeed, can ever find  adequate. The account of the people as teacher of religion--this is  the content of the first half of Jewish history; the account of the  people as thinker, stoic, and sufferer--this is the content of the  second half of Jewish history.    A summing up of all that has been said in this and the previous  chapter proves true the statement with which we began, that Jewish  history, in respect to its quantitative dimensions as well as its  qualitative structure, is to the last degree distinctive and presents  a phenomenon of undeniable uniqueness.          III    THE SIGNIFICANCE OF JEWISH HISTORY      We turn now to the question of the significance to be attached to  Jewish history. In view of its peculiar qualities, what has it to  offer to the present generation and to future generations as a subject  of study and research?    The significance of Jewish history is twofold. It is at once national  and universal. At present the fulcrum of Jewish national being lies in  the historical consciousness. In the days of antiquity, the Jews were  welded into a single united nation by the triple agencies of state,  race, and religion, the complete array of material and spiritual  forces directed to one point. Later, in the period of homelessness and  dispersion, it was chiefly religious consciousness that cemented Jewry  into a whole, and replaced the severed political bond as well as the  dulled racial instinct, which is bound to go on losing in keenness in  proportion to the degree of removal from primitive conditions and  native soil. In our days, when the liberal movements leavening the  whole of mankind, if they have not completely shattered the religious  consciousness, have at least, in an important section of Jewry,  effected a change in its form; when abrupt differences of opinion with  regard to questions of faith and cult are asserting their presence;  and traditional Judaism developed in historical sequence is proving  powerless to hold together the diverse factors of the national  organism,--in these days the keystone of national unity seems to be  the historical consciousness. Composed alike of physical,  intellectual, and moral elements, of habits and views, of emotions and  impressions nursed into being and perfection by the hereditary  instinct active for thousands of years, this historical consciousness  is a remarkably puzzling and complex psychic phenomenon. By our common  memory of a great, stirring past and heroic deeds on the battle-fields  of the spirit, by the exalted historical mission allotted to us, by  our thorn-strewn pilgrim's path, our martyrdom assumed for the sake of  our principles, by such moral ties, we Jews, whether consciously or  unconsciously, are bound fast to one another. As Renan well says:  \"Common sorrow unites men more closely than common joy.\" A long chain  of historical traditions is cast about us all like a strong ring. Our  wonderful, unparalleled past attracts us with magnetic power. In the  course of centuries, as generation followed generation, similarity of  historical fortunes produced a mass of similar impressions which have  crystallized, and have thrown off the deposit that may be called \"the  Jewish national soul.\" This is the soil in which, deep down, lies  imbedded, as an unconscious element, the Jewish national _feeling_,  and as a conscious element, the Jewish national _idea_.    It follows that the Jewish national idea and the national feeling  connected with it have their origin primarily in the historical  consciousness, in a certain complex of ideas and psychic  predispositions. These ideas and predispositions, the deposit left by  the aggregate of historical impressions, are of necessity the common  property of the whole nation, and they can be developed and quickened  to a considerable degree by a renewal of the impressions through the  study of history. Upon the knowledge of history, then, depends the  strength of the national consciousness.[5]      [5] A different aspect of the same thought is presented with      logical clearness in another publication by our author. \"The      national _idea_, and the national _feeling_,\" says      Mr. Dubnow, \"must be kept strictly apart. Unfortunately the      difference between them is usually obliterated. National      feeling is spontaneous. To a greater or less degree it is      inborn in all the members of the nation as a feeling of      kinship. It has its flood-tide and its ebbtide in      correspondence to external conditions, either forcing the      nation to defend its nationality, or relieving it of the      necessity for self-defense. As this feeling is not merely a      blind impulse, but a complicated psychic phenomenon, it can be      subjected to a psychologic analysis. From the given historical      facts or the ideas that have become the common treasure of a      nation, thinking men, living life consciously, can, in one way      or another, derive the origin, development, and vital force of      its national feeling. The results of such an analysis,      arranged in some sort of system, form the content of the      national idea. The task of the national idea it is to clarify      the national feeling, and give it logical sanction for the      benefit of those who cannot rest satisfied with an unconscious      feeling.       \"In what, to be specific, does the essence of our Jewish national      idea consist? Or, putting the question in another form, what      is the cement that unites us into a single compact organism?      Territory and government, the external ties usually binding a      nation together, we have long ago lost. Their place is filled      by abstract principles, by religion and race. Undeniably these      are factors of first importance, and yet we ask the question,      do they alone and exclusively maintain the national cohesion      of Jewry? No, we reply, for if we admitted this proposition,      we should by consequence have to accept the inference, that      the laxity of religious principle prevailing among      free-thinking Jews, and the obliteration of race peculiarities      in the 'civilized' strata of our people, bring in their train      a corresponding weakening, or, indeed, a complete breaking up,      of our national foundations--which in point of fact is not the      case. On the contrary, it is noticeable that the      latitudinarians, the _libres penseurs_, and the      indifferent on the subject of religion, stand in the forefront      of all our national movements. Seeing that to belong to it is      in most cases heroism, and in many martyrdom, what is it that      attracts these Jews so forcibly to their people? There must be      something common to us all, so comprehensive that in the face      of multifarious views and degrees of culture it acts as a      consolidating force. This 'something,' I am convinced, is the      community of historical fortunes of all the scattered parts of      the Jewish nation. We are welded together by our glorious      past. We are encircled by a mighty chain of similar historical      impressions suffered by our ancestors, century after century      pressing in upon the Jewish soul, and leaving behind a      substantial deposit. In short, the Jewish national idea is      based chiefly upon the historical consciousness.\" [Note of the      German trl.]    But over and above its national significance, Jewish history, we  repeat, possesses universal significance. Let us, in the first place,  examine its value for science and philosophy. Inasmuch as it is  pre-eminently a chronicle of ideas and spiritual movements, Jewish  history affords the philosopher or psychologist material for  observation of the most important and useful kind. The study of other,  mostly dull chapters of universal history has led to the fixing of  psychologic or sociologic theses, to the working out of comprehensive  philosophic systems, to the determination of general laws. Surely it  follows without far-fetched proof, that in some respects the chapter  dealing with Jewish history must supply material of the most original  character for such theses and philosophies. If it is true, as the last  chapter set out to demonstrate, that Jewish history is distinguished  by sharply marked and peculiar features, and refuses to accommodate  itself to conventional forms, then its content must have an original  contribution to make to philosophy. It does not admit of a doubt that  the study of Jewish history would yield new propositions appertaining  to the philosophy of history and the psychology of nations, hitherto  overlooked by inquirers occupied with the other divisions of"]]]
