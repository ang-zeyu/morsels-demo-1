Our house had three rooms.  One of them was a kitchen and dining  room together.  There was a long porch at the front of the house  and an L-shaped porch on the back.  There were flower beds and  flowers in our front yard, and morning glory vines on the front  yard fence and china trees in the back yard.  They made good  shades to play in.    There was a hog pen on the north side of the barn, with sheds to  protect the hogs from the summer heat and the winter cold.  The  horse lots and cow lots were on the south side of the barn, with  sheds to shelter the stock.  Feed troughs were under the sheds  and feed was stored in the big barn.    I remember the hill west of the barn about a hundred yards.  It  wasn't a steep hill--just a gentle rise in the land.  But it was  high enough to get up on and see Uncle Andrew's house and  Grandma's house.  I couldn't see Grandma's house as good as I  could Uncle Andrew's because hers had so many big trees all  around it.    I remember we had a syrup mill too, up on the slope northwest of  the barn.  We had a horse that would go round and round and make  the big iron rollers squeeze the juice out of the cane stalks.  The juice would run down a spout and we would catch it in  buckets.  Then Mama would cook the juice in a big pan over a fire  out there in the pasture.    Of course Frank and Susie and Earl would all help keep the fire  going and help Papa keep putting cane stalks through the big  rollers.  Joel would help a little bit, but I was just in the  way.  And Albert had to be looked after too.    Sometimes the cows and horses would come and try to eat the cane  and we had to put them in pens by the barn.  When we finished  squeezing the juice out, we would let them all come out of the  pen and eat the stalks we didn't want any more.    When we got the juice cooked enough it was good ribbon cane syrup  and we would put it in big jugs and take it down in the cellar.  But not all of it.  We would take some of it in the kitchen to  eat.    I remember a big pile of wood and lots of mesquite posts.  They  were southwest of the barn on the slope of the hill.  The wind  had been blowing and lots of sand had drifted up in piles by the  woodpile.  Some of our plows and wagons were out there too by the  woodpile.  The posts were leaning up against big trees.    Just north of the hog pen was our stack lot with big stacks of  bundled feed in it.  And when I think of the stack lot, I think  of a little black horse we had named Keno, because all too often  Old Keno was in the stack lot without an invitation.  He was not  a big work horse, yet he could hold his own when hitched to a  cultivator.  And he could outdo all the others at acrobatics.    Yes, Old Keno was a fence jumper.  We often found him in the corn  patch or maize patch, what time he wasn't in the stack lot.  That's probably the reason I always remember him as being fat and  having a shiny coat; he got more than his share of goodies to  eat.    Anyway, one time I remember seeing Old Keno in the stack lot when  we were coming home from church or from Uncle Andrew's.  We drove  up from the west and as we came over the rise west of the barn,  there he was, in the stack lot again.    I really believe we were coming home from church because we were  all dressed up and were in our new hack.    We had an old buggy and I think we had an old hack.  I think I  sort of remember when we got the new hack.  The old one was good  enough for everyday use, and so was the old buggy.  But for  really stepping out in style, that shining black new hack was  something else.  For Sunday and for going to town, we used the  new one.  It had two seats, rubber tires, and a beautiful glossy  black finish--with tiny little yellow pinstripes at just the  right places.  When Papa hitched his two trotting horses to it,  it was truly a carriage to be proud of.    We also went socializing in the new hack.  And Papa never fooled  around with a walking team, they always trotted.  Even when we  drove 18 miles to Anson to visit the Hood family on Sundays, our  team trotted practically all the way.  And then they trotted back  the same day.    As I said, Old Keno was eating more than his share of the grain  from the bundles of feed, and he was wasting a lot also.    I was in the front seat with Papa and some of the other kids.  I  was probably in Papa's lap, I don't remember.  Mama was in the  back seat with some of the others.  In fact, Mama always rode in  the back seat.  There is no picture in my memory of Mama ever  riding in the front seat of our hack.  I don't really know why  she chose the back seat.  Fact is, it never occurred to me until  now that she may not have chosen the back seat; she may not have  had a choice.  While she was with us, it never entered my mind to  ask her why.  But now as I ponder these things, I wish I had.  If  she were sitting here in the room with me now, I would stop  writing long enough to look up and ask, \"Mama, why did you always  sit in the back seat of our hack?\"    And I haven't the slightest doubt that she would answer, \"Why,  Willie and you children always rode in the front seat.  There  wasn't room for me.\"    Anyway, I was less than five years old, probably less than four.  And I don't remember what else Mama was doing, but I'll bet a  dollar she was holding Albert in her lap.  And I'll bet another  dollar I can guess what Albert was doing.  Since baby bottles  were almost unheard of in those days, and were not needed in our  family, he was probably getting his milk from some other source,  as mother nature meant for him to.    Be that as it may, Old Keno was eating at the feed stack and he  seemed to be much happier than Papa was to see him there.  I  don't remember what Papa said, if anything, but I do remember  that Mama expressed her disapproval of Old Keno's bad manners by  calling him a scoundrel.  That was the name Mama gave to  troublesome animals and mean people.    There was plenty of work to be done on the farm, and we kids  learned to work early in life.  Joel was just 16 months older  than I was, and one spring, when he was too young to go to  school, Papa had him planting in the field with a two-row  planter.  In the afternoons, when Earl got home from school, he  would relieve Joel, so Joel could go home and play the rest of  the day.    Then one day Joel got a foot hurt and couldn't run the planter.  So I had to take his place on the planter for a few days.  Planting had to go on.  I don't remember how old I was at that  time.  I do know for sure I was planting at the Flint place.  And  we moved from that place in January--the same January in which I  became five years old.  So, I must have been planting when I was  a little over four years old or when I was just past three, I'm  not sure which.  I am sure, however, I was older than two,  because, when I was only two, Earl was too young to go to school.    If it were not for skeptics, I could go ahead with my memoirs.  But I feel I should detour here and explain a thing or two, or  some folks will think I am lying.  One man has already questioned  my story about the two-row planter.  He thought they hadn't made  a two-row planter as early as 1910.  This one happened to be a  special type planter.  I have never seen but two of them in my  lifetime.    But you could be sure, if William Franklin Johnson heard of a  farm implement that he thought could be used to do a better job  on the farm, he would get it, if at all possible.  And if it  wouldn't do to suit him, he would make it do whatever he wanted  it to do.    I remember having seen Papa, as early as the Flint place, mind  you, using a combination cultivator-planter.  He could cultivate  his young feed or cotton and, at the same time, plant new seeds  in the skips where the first planting had not come up to a good  stand.    He built the implement himself.  That was ingenuity.  He was my  father.    This special two-row planter that I used was pulled by two big,  gentle horses.  They knew how to follow the furrows and stay on  the rows.  And they knew that \"whoa\" meant stop, even when a  three-year-old said it.  What's more, Papa was plowing along  beside me, just a few rows away, and he worked the lever and  turned my team around at both ends of the rows.    Now, that doesn't sound so far out, does it?    I'll bet the people around the little town of McCaulley would  believe me without an explanation.  They had a man in their  community who used a dog to do his plowing for him.  It's true.  And the man didn't have to be there to work the levers for him  and turn the team around at the end of the rows.    There were no rows.  He was flatbreaking his ground, going round  and round.  His mules followed the furrow all day long and the  man only had to sit there hour after hour doing nothing.  Then he  got the idea of tying his lines up and slipping off to the house  without his mules knowing he was gone.    This worked well except when the mules would stop once in awhile,  and he would have to go start them again.  So, next he put his  little dog on the plow seat.  The dog liked to ride so well that,  when the team would begin stopping, he would bark to keep them  going.    People could hardly believe their eyes--the very idea--a dog  plowing while his master sat on his porch in the shade.    Now, Papa didn't have a dog, so he used me.    We Texans have to be careful what we say and to whom we say it.  When I start talking with a man, the first thing I want to know  is, where is he from?    I know, Texans have a reputation of being big liars.  It is true,  all Texans are capable of lying, but they are not all liars.  They don't have to lie.  In Texas the truth is wild enough.

Such is the exuberance of signification which many words have  obtained, that it was scarcely possible to collect all their senses;  sometimes the meaning of derivatives must be sought in the mother  term, and sometimes deficient explanations of the primitive may  be supplied in the train of derivation. In any case of doubt or  difficulty, it will be always proper to examine all the words of  the same race; for some words are slightly passed over to avoid  repetition, some admitted easier and clearer explanation than  others, and all will be better understood, as they are considered  in greater variety of structures and relations.    All the interpretations of words are not written with the same  skill, or the same happiness: things equally easy in themselves,  are not all equally easy to any single mind. Every writer of a  long work commits errours, where there appears neither ambiguity  to mislead, nor obscurity to confound him; and in a search like  this, many felicities of expression will be casually overlooked,  many convenient parallels will be forgotten, and many particulars  will admit improvement from a mind utterly unequal to the whole  performance.    But many seeming faults are to be imputed rather to the nature of  the undertaking, than the negligence of the performer. Thus some  explanations are unavoidably reciprocal or circular, as hind, the  female of the stag; stag, the male of the hind: sometimes easier words  are changed into harder, as burial into sepulture or interment,  drier into desiccative, dryness into siccity or aridity, fit  into paroxysm; for the easiest word, whatever it be, can never  be translated into one more easy. But easiness and difficulty are  merely relative, and if the present prevalence of our language  should invite foreigners to this dictionary, many will be assisted  by those words which now seem only to increase or produce obscurity.  For this reason I have endeavoured frequently to join a Teutonick  and Roman interpretation, as to cheer, to gladden, or exhilarate,  that every learner of English may be assisted by his own tongue.    The solution of all difficulties, and the supply of all defects,  must be sought in the examples, subjoined to the various senses of  each word, and ranged according to the time of their authours.    When first I collected these authorities, I was desirous that every  quotation should be useful to some other end than the illustration  of a word; I therefore extracted from philosophers principles of  science; from historians remarkable facts; from chymists complete  processes; from divines striking exhortations; and from poets beautiful  descriptions. Such is design, while it is yet at a distance from  execution. When the time called upon me to range this accumulation  of elegance and wisdom into an alphabetical series, I soon discovered  that the bulk of my volumes would fright away the student, and was  forced to depart from my scheme of including all that was pleasing or  useful in English literature, and reduce my transcripts very often  to clusters of words, in which scarcely any meaning is retained; thus  to the weariness of copying, I was condemned to add the vexation  of expunging. Some passages I have yet spared, which may relieve  the labour of verbal searches, and intersperse with verdure and  flowers the dusty desarts of barren philology.    The examples, thus mutilated, are no longer to be considered as  conveying the sentiments or doctrine of their authours; the word  for the sake of which they are inserted, with all its appendant  clauses, has been carefully preserved; but it may sometimes happen,  by hasty detruncation, that the general tendency of the sentence  may be changed: the divine may desert his tenets, or the philosopher  his system.    Some of the examples have been taken from writers who were never  mentioned as masters of elegance or models of stile; but words  must be sought where they are used; and in what pages, eminent  for purity, can terms of manufacture or agriculture be found? Many  quotations serve no other purpose, than that of proving the bare  existence of words, and are therefore selected with less scrupulousness  than those which are to teach their structures and relations.    My purpose was to admit no testimony of living authours, that I  might not be misled by partiality, and that none of my cotemporaries  might have reason to complain; nor have I departed from this  resolution, but when some performance of uncommon excellence excited  my veneration, when my memory supplied me, from late books, with  an example that was wanting, or when my heart, in the tenderness  of friendship, solicited admission for a favourite name.    So far have I been from any care to grace my pages with modern  decorations, that I have studiously endeavoured to collect examples  and authorities from the writers before the restoration, whose works  I regard as the wells of English undefiled, as the pure sources of  genuine diction. Our language, for almost a century, has, by the  concurrence of many causes, been gradually departing from its original  Teutonick character, and deviating towards a Gallick structure and  phraseology, from which it ought to be our endeavour to recal it,  by making our ancient volumes the ground-work of stile, admitting  among the additions of later times, only such as may supply real  deficiencies, such as are readily adopted by the genius of our  tongue, and incorporate easily with our native idioms.    But as every language has a time of rudeness antecedent to  perfection, as well as of false refinement and declension, I have  been cautious lest my zeal for antiquity might drive me into times  too remote, and croud my book with words now no longer understood.  I have fixed Sidney's work for the boundary, beyond which I make few  excursions. From the authours which rose in the time of Elizabeth,  a speech might be formed adequate to all the purposes of use and  elegance. If the language of theology were extracted from Hooker  and the translation of the Bible; the terms of natural knowledge  from Bacon; the phrases of policy, war, and navigation from Raleigh;  the dialect of poetry and fiction from Spenser and Sidney; and the  diction of common life from Shakespeare, few ideas would be lost to  mankind, for want of English words, in which they might be expressed.    It is not sufficient that a word is found, unless it be so combined  as that its meaning is apparently determined by the tract and tenour  of the sentence; such passages I have therefore chosen, and when  it happened that any authour gave a definition of a term, or such  an explanation as is equivalent to a definition, I have placed  his authority as a supplement to my own, without regard to the  chronological order, that is otherwise observed.    Some words, indeed, stand unsupported by any authority, but they are  commonly derivative nouns or adverbs, formed from their primitives  by regular and constant analogy, or names of things seldom occurring  in books, or words of which I have reason to doubt the existence.    There is more danger of censure from the multiplicity than paucity  of examples; authorities will sometimes seem to have been accumulated  without necessity or use, and perhaps some will be found, which  might, without loss, have been omitted. But a work of this kind  is not hastily to be charged with superfluities: those quotations,  which to careless or unskilful perusers appear only to repeat  the same sense, will often exhibit, to a more accurate examiner,  diversities of signification, or, at least, afford different shades  of the same meaning: one will shew the word applied to persons,  another to things; one will express an ill, another a good, and a  third a neutral sense; one will prove the expression genuine from  an ancient authour; another will shew it elegant from a modern: a  doubtful authority is corroborated by another of more credit; an  ambiguous sentence is ascertained by a passage clear and determinate;  the word, how often soever repeated, appears with new associates  and in different combinations, and every quotation contributes  something to the stability or enlargement of the language.    When words are used equivocally, I receive them in either sense; when  they are metaphorical, I adopt them in their primitive acceptation.    I have sometimes, though rarely, yielded to the temptation of  exhibiting a genealogy of sentiments, by shewing how one authour  copied the thoughts and diction of another: such quotations are  indeed little more than repetitions, which might justly be censured,  did they not gratify the mind, by affording a kind of intellectual  history.    The various syntactical structures occurring in the examples have  been carefully noted; the licence or negligence with which many  words have been hitherto used, has made our stile capricious and  indeterminate; when the different combinations of the same word are  exhibited together, the preference is readily given to propriety,  and I have often endeavoured to direct the choice.    Thus have I laboured by settling the orthography, displaying the  analogy, regulating the structures, and ascertaining the signification  of English words, to perform all the parts of a faithful lexicographer:  but I have not always executed my own scheme, or satisfied my own  expectations. The work, whatever proofs of diligence and attention  it may exhibit, is yet capable of many improvements: the orthography  which I recommend is still controvertible, the etymology which I  adopt is uncertain, and perhaps frequently erroneous; the explanations  are sometimes too much contracted, and sometimes too much diffused,  the significations are"]]]
