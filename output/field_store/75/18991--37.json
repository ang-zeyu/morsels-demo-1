He also wanted to be sure that Japan would be branded \"the aggressor.\"    That night the radio announced that the \"Japanese have marched from  Aparri (on the north coast of Luzon) to Tuguegarao and have activated  the airfield.\" Now we could expect more frequent bombing.    \"Tokyo Rose\" was urging us to surrender, or, \"Experience a certain  death!\" She continued: \"All American aid is going to Europe! America  is giving Lend-lease aid to Britain and to Russia, but there is none  for the Philippines.\" She was right!    December 12, '41: Dr. Allen and I had a Filipino soldier's wife on the  operating table at 0800 hours ready for a sterilization operation. She  was thirty-four years old and had seventeen children. During her last  pregnancy, which she had delivered ten days before, she became greatly  swollen with edema (severe kidney disease). Another pregnancy would  probably kill her.    Bomb began to fall. I shouted, \"Everybody downstairs-under the  hospital!\" After the\" All Clear,\" we returned to the operating room to  find our patient had retrieved her clothing and departed for safer  areas.       Again the wounded were coming in. This time we were ready    for them. The operating room was all set up and ready to go.       Radio from USAFFE: Capt. Eugene C Jacobs, M.C, promoted to Major.       Heard that a strong Japanese force had landed at Legaspi  accompanied by a large naval escort.       During the next ten days, while we treated our sick and wounded,  and buried our dead, nearly one-hundred various sized Japanese ships  were quietly assembling in the Lingayen Gulf, only twenty-five miles  from Baguio. We had neither airpower nor naval forces to deter them.  The Army Air Corps had been about    75% destroyed, and Admiral Hart would not risk his small Asiatic Fleet  in battle; he took off for Australia.    At dawn on the morning of Dec. 22, '41, some 60,000 veteran Nipponese  troops of Lt. Gen. Masahatu Homma's crack 14th Army from China swarmed  ashore between Vigan and Dagupun, twenty-five to fifty miles from  Baguio.    Maj. Gen. Jonathan Wainwright had four divisions (11th, 21st, 31st,  and 1 10th) of the Philippine Army on the beaches to prevent a  landing. When the cruisers and destroyers opened fire with their big  guns, there was great confusion on the beaches; many recent recruits  buried their rifles in the sand, and took off for the mountains. \"This  was not their kind of war!\"    Soon thousands of Japanese veterans, on bicycles, were pedaling south  on the highway bordering the South China Sea. Our Scouts picked off  hundreds of Japs as they rode by, but in a few hours were completely  out of ammunition. The Japs and their bicycles kept right on coming.    Sporadic wounded were appearing at the hospital. Major Joe Ganahl, a  well known polo player, was one of these. He had been fighting a  rear-guard action with his big\" 155s\"-coming down from Vigan. He said,  \"I'm going to have to destroy my 155s as they are trapped.\" When we  got his wounds dressed, he took off in his jeep down the road, looking  like the \"Spirit of'76.\"    We were beginning to note that the Japanese .25 caliber was not  causing near the tissue damage caused by the U.S. .30, .38 and .45  cal.    Frequently, when using the telephone, we could hear Japanese voices  using our lines. We could usually get them off by saying, \"Moshi,  moshi! (hello) and sayonara (good-bye).\"    We transferred our few remaining patients to civilian hospitals in  Baguio and made preparations to move out.    As the Japanese Imperial Army advanced up the mountains toward Baguio  on both roads, the Naguillian Trail, and the Kennon Road, our two  companies of the 43rd Philippine Scouts, outnumbered ten to one, were  becoming more and more desperate. We could hear the big explosions as  they blew bridges and oil tanks.    Finally, we were aware of rifle fire-it sounded like corn popping.  Realizing that Camp Hay would soon be overrun by Japanese troops, we  prepared and loaded our equipment on hospital vehicles. We were not  anxious to be the first military    unit in the Philippines to surrender. We were well informed as to the  Japanese cruelty and treachery in China; we didn't want any part of  it.                                    Chapter II                          THE ORANGE PLAN (WPO III)      Dee. 23, 1941 (my wedding anniversary): Finally, orders arrived from  USAFFE Headquarters in Manila: \"ORANGE PLAN III IS NOW IN EFFECT!  EVACUATE CAMP JOHN HAY! PROCEED TO JOIN FIL-AMERICAN FORCES IN BATAAN!  MACARTHUR\".    The Japanese forces controlled both roads leading from Baguio to  Bataan. The only available exits from Baguio were over rugged  mountains, some a mile high. The nearest road leading to Bataan that  still might be open was through Balete Pass, fifty miles to the  southeast.    I worried about feeding my medical detachment (two Army nurses and  thirty enlisted personnel) following along behind the companies of the  43rd Infantry of Scouts. I told Col. Horan that I would like my  detachment to be the \"point\" that would lead the way through to  Bataan. To my surprise, he seemed pleased and agreed. I told him, \"I'm  ready to move out!\" He answered,    \"OK!\"    Our medics quickly mounted hospital transportation and drove down the  southeast road into the valley, past the entrance to the Antomoc Gold  Mine and on to the end of the pavement. As we abandoned our vehicles,  we disabled them so the Japanese would be unable to use them. We then  placed our first-aid materials and my little medical bag on litters,  and started up the trail at a rather rapid pace. In the hot sun we  soon became exhausted and realized we would have to go slower and rest  frequently.    About three hours up the trail, we came upon Associated Press  Correspondent Clark Lee trudging along. Resting with him on the path  for a few minutes, we swapped stories; he reported: \"Lingayen city has  been bombed! Many Filipinos are fleeing south through the central  plains with all their belongings. I came up to Baguio yesterday;  soldiers had dynamite boxes ready to blow the bridges on the  Naguillian Trail. I saw Major Ganahl and asked him what happened to  our North Luzon Forces. Joe answered, 'Hell! We are the North Luzon  Forces!\"    We never saw Clark Lee again, but later learned that he found a  short-cut through St. Nicholas and Tayug to the central plain, where  he had a brush with the Japs on his way to Bataan. He proved an old  saying, \"He travels fastest who travels alone!\" He later wrote a very  interesting book about his experiences in the Philippines, \"They Call  It Pacific.\"    Our two nurses were having difficulty keeping up with the troops on  the steep and often narrow trails. Our equipment was becoming too  heavy to carry; little by little, it fell by the wayside: litters, gas  masks, helmets, pup tents, tarps, blankets, mosquito nets, etc. As we  moved up the mountains, we noticed natives using mirrors to signal  planes. We didn't know whether they were trying to blind the pilots or  wave them away. Two more fatiguing hours and we reached the large  Lusod Saw Mill, operated' by the American Jorgensen family.    A soldier came running up the path; he shouted, \"Col. Horan has had a  heart attack!\" Back down the trail I went for about an hour, when I  found the colonel in agony beside the path. A quarter of morphine, a  swallow of whiskey and an hour's rest revived him enough to continue.    The Jorgensen family were gracious hosts; they had apparently been  stocking up on food for several months, getting ready for this day.  They shared their Christmas dinner with us-our last warm meal.    Because the mountains were so rugged, we decided that tile nurses  should remain with the Jorgensens to share their fate, along with  several American miners' wives, who were joining them-to sit out the  war.    The Jorgensens still had telephone service to their friends in Baguio.  From them, we learned that many of the Japanese civilian prisoners,  whom we had interned at Camp John Hay, when liberated by the  Japanese-army, were putting on uniforms, private to colonel, and  joining the occupying forces. The invading army had government money,  already printed, when they arrived. When the Jap soldiers presented  their \"play\" money to the Filipinos in order to buy food, the natives  laughed and said, \"No good in this country!\" They soon learned that it  was backed up by the full faith of the Japanese bayonet. There were  many tales of Japanese treachery.    Yet, the Japs pretended to be friendly to the Filipino. They would  say, \"Look the color of our skin is the same! We promise    you early liberation from the Americans, and in the near future, we  give your country independence.\" The Japs turned their hospitality and  hostility on and off like a faucet.    The Japs insisted that the natives take off their big straw hats and  bow deeply each time they encountered a Japanese soldier. This was not  the Filipinos' idea of independence and freedom. They'd had it much  better with the Americans. We later learned that in most every barrio,  especially in Mindanao, a Japanese store owner put on a uniform, when  liberated, and took charge of the barrio.    Christmas evening, we were informed that Manila had been declared an  \"open city.\" U.S. troops were actively moving toward Bataan and  Corregidor. We also heard that seven thousand Jap forces had made a  landing at Lamon Bay, east of Manila. Major General George Parker's  South Luzon Forces were opposing the landing. It was estimated that  the Japanese had an invasion force of more than 150,000 men in the  Philippines. Rumors were"]]]
