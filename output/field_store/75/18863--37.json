At the time of detonation, 99 project personnel were in the three  shelters: 29 in the north shelter, 37 in the west shelter, and 33 in  the south shelter.  Dr. Oppenheimer, Dr. Bainbridge, and other key  personnel awaited the firing at the south shelter, which served as the  Control Point.  Figure 2-3 shows the exterior of the south shelter;  figure 2-4 gives an interior view of one of the shelters, most likely  the south.  Although most of the shelter occupants were civilians, at  least 23 military participants were spread among the three shelters  (1; 12).    The remainder of the test site personnel were positioned at the Base  Camp 16 kilometers south-southwest of ground zero, or on Compania  Hill, or at the guard posts.  Important Government officials, such as  General Groves and Dr. Vannevar Bush, Director of the U.S. Office of  Scientific Research and Development, viewed the detonation from a  trench at the Base Camp.  The Base Camp is depicted in figure 2-5.    The military police of Guard Posts 1 and 2 were instructed to be in  foxholes approximately five kilometers west and north, respectively,  from their posts.  The military police of Guard Posts 3 and 4 were  instructed to be in foxholes south of Mockingbird Gap.  A radiological  safety monitor was assigned to the group from Guard Post 4.  Guard Post  5 personnel were to be in the south shelter, Guard Post 6 personnel in  the west shelter, and Guard Post 7 personnel in the north shelter.  The military police of Guard Post 8 remained at that post, 400 meters  east of the Base Camp (9).    An evacuation detachment of between 144 and 160 officers and enlisted  men was stationed near Guard Post 2, about 14 kilometers northwest of  ground zero.  These men were on standby in case ranches and towns  beyond the test site had to be evacuated.  Five radiological safety  monitors were assigned to this detachment.  Ninety-four men of the  evacuation detachment belonged to Provisional Detachment Number 1,  Company \"B,\" of the 9812th Technical Service Unit, Army Corps of  Engineers, from LASL.  The identity of the remaining evacuation  personnel has not been documented (3; 4; 8; 10; 15).    With the exception of the shelter occupants (99 personnel) and  evacuation detachment (between 144 and 160 men), the number of  personnel at the test site at the time of detonation has not been  documented.  Film badge records show that approximately 355 people  were at the test site at some time during 16 July.  The shelter  occupants and 44 men of the evacuation detachment are on this list.  It has not been possible to pinpoint the location of many of the  remaining personnel.  Some were at the Base Camp or on Compania Hill.  Since many of these people returned to the test site after shot-time  to work on experiments, their film badges registered exposures from  residual radioactivity on 16 July.  Based on the documented personnel  totals, at least the following 263 individuals were at the test site  when the device was detonated (1; 4; 8-10; 13; 15):    o 99 shelter occupants at shelters 9,150 meters north, south, and west  of ground zero    o 144 to 160 officers and enlisted men of the evacuation detachment,  located 14 kilometers northwest of ground zero near Guard Post 2    o Five radiological safety monitors assigned to the evacuation  detachment to perform offsite monitoring of nearby towns and  residences    o One radiological safety monitor assigned to Guard Post 4    o Two military policemen at each of the seven guard posts (indicated  by photographs such as figures 1-3 and 1-4).      2.2  DETONATION AND POSTSHOT ACTIVITIES    Because of bad weather, the Project TRINITY director (Dr.  Bainbridge)  delayed the detonation, which had been scheduled for 0400 hours.  By  0445, however, the forecast was better, and shot-time was set for  0530.  This gave the scientists 45 minutes to arm the device and  prepare the instruments in the shelters.  The final countdown began at  0510, and the device was detonated at 0529:45 Mountain War Time from  the Control Point in the south shelter (3; 12).    No one was closer than 9,150 meters to ground zero at the time of the  detonation.  With the exception of a few men holding the ropes of  barrage balloons or guiding cameras to follow the fireball as it  ascended, all shelter personnel were in or behind the shelters.  Some  left the shelters after the initial flash to view the fireball.  As a  precautionary measure, they had been advised to lie on the ground  before the blast wave arrived.  Project personnel located beyond the  shelters, such as at the Base Camp and on Compania Hill, were also  instructed to lie on the ground or in a depression until the blast  wave had passed (1).  However, the blast wave at these locations was  not as strong as had been expected.    In order to prevent eye damage, Dr. Bainbridge ordered the  distribution of welder's filter glass.  Because it was not known  exactly how the flash might affect eyesight, it was suggested that  direct viewing of the fireball not be attempted even with this  protection.  The recommended procedure was to face away from ground  zero and watch the hills or sky until the fireball illuminated the  area.  Then, after the initial flash had passed, one could turn around  and view the fireball through the filter glass.  Despite these  well-publicized instructions, two participants did not take  precautions.  They were temporarily blinded by the intense flash but  experienced no permanent vision impairment (1; 17).    People as far away as Santa Fe and El Paso saw the brilliant light of  the detonation.  Windows rattled in the areas immediately surrounding  the test site, waking sleeping ranchers and townspeople.  To dispel  any rumors that might compromise the security of Project TRINITY, the  Government announced that an Army munitions dump had exploded.  However, immediately after the destruction of Hiroshima, the  Government revealed to the public what had actually occurred in the  New Mexico desert (12; 13).    Immediately after the shot, Medical Group personnel began the  radiological monitoring activities described in section 3.1.2.  At  0815, when most of the monitoring activities were completed,  preparations began for entrance into the ground zero area.  To  regulate entry into the area, a \"Going-in Board\" was established,  consisting of Dr. Bainbridge, the Chief of the Medical Group, and a  special scientific consultant.  Its purpose was to determine whether a  party had a valid reason for entering the ground zero area.  The board  functioned for three days.    Military police at Guard Post 4 and at three roadblocks set up along  Broadway controlled entry into the area.  Guard Posts 3, 5, 6, and 7  were within 3,000 meters of ground zero and thus remained unmanned.  At the south shelter, the Medical Group set up a \"going-in\" station  where personnel were required to stop to put on protective clothing  (coveralls, booties, caps, and cotton gloves) and pick up monitoring  equipment before entering the ground zero area.  Since it was not  known how much radioactive material might be suspended in the air, all  personnel entering the ground zero area wore complete protective  covering and respirators for the first three days after the  detonation.  Figure 2-6 shows two Project TRINITY personnel wearing  protective clothing (1).    On the day of the shot, five parties entered the ground zero area.  One party consisted of eight members of the earth-sampling group.  They obtained samples by driving to within 460 meters of ground zero  in a tank specially fitted with rockets to which retrievable  collectors were fastened in order to gather soil samples from a  distance.  This group made several sampling excursions on 16 and 17  July.  The tank carried two personnel (a driver and a passenger) each  trip.  No member of this party received a radiation exposure of more  than 1 roentgen (1).    Five other men from the earth-sampling group entered the ground zero  area in a second tank, lined with lead for radiation protection.  The  tank, carrying the driver and one passenger, made five trips into the  ground zero area to retrieve soil samples on 16 and 17 July.  On two  trips, the tank passed over ground zero; on the others, it approached  to within about 90 meters of ground zero.  The men scooped up soil  samples through a trap door in the bottom of the tank.  One driver who  made three trips into the ground zero area received the highest  exposure, 15 roentgens (1).    This lead-lined tank was also used by ten men to observe the radiation  area.  These men, traveling two at a time, made five trips into the  area on shot-day but never approached closer than 1,370 meters to  ground zero.  The highest exposure among these ten men was 0.3  roentgens (1).    The next party to approach ground zero consisted of a photographer and  a radiological safety monitor.  Wearing protective clothing and  respirators, the two men were about 730 meters northwest of ground  zero photographing \"JUMBO\" from 1100 to 1200 hours.  \"JUMBO,\" shown in  figure 2-7, was a massive container built to contain the  high-explosive detonation of the TRINITY device and to allow recovery  of the fissionable material if the device failed to produce a nuclear  detonation.  The plan to use \"JUMBO,\" however, was abandoned when the  scientists concluded that a fairly large nuclear explosion was  certain.  The container remained on the ground near the shot-tower  during the detonation.  Both the photographer and the monitor received  an estimated radiation exposure between 0.5 and 1 roentgen (1; 7).    The last party to \"go in\" on shot-day consisted of six men retrieving  neutron detectors.  They entered the test area at 1430 hours.  Three  of the men went to a point 730 meters south of ground zero to pull out  cables carrying neutron detectors located 550"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5529"],[0,"The Bride of the Nile — Complete (#4)"],[1," governor's no doubt,\" said the merchant, as it slowly  came towards the grove from the middle of the stream. At the same  time the clatter of hoofs became audible from the road behind the inn.  Haschim turned round and was aware of torchbearers running ahead of a  chariot.    \"The sick man has come so far by water,\" said the Arab, \"and now, he is  to be driven home.--Strange! this is the second time to-day that I have  met his much-talked-of son!\"    The governor's pleasure-barge was nearing the palm-grove. It was a large  and handsome boat, built of cedar-wood and richly gilt, with an image  of John, the patron-saint of the family, for a figure-head. The nimbus  round the head was a crown of lamps, and large lanterns shone both at  the bows and stern of the vessel. The Mukaukas George was reclining  under an awning, his wife Neforis by his side. Opposite to them sat  their son and a tall young girl, at whose feet a child of ten sat on the  ground, leaning her pretty head against her knees. An older Greek woman,  the child's governess, had a place by the side of a very tall man, on an  ottoman beyond the verge of the awning. This man was Philip the leech.  The cheerful sound of the lute accompanied the barge, and the performer  was the returned wanderer Orion, who touched the strings with skill and  deep feeling.    It was altogether a pleasing scene--a fair picture of a wealthy and  united family. But who was the damsel sitting by Orion's side? He was  devoting his whole attention to her; as he struck the strings with  deeper emphasis his eyes sought hers, and it seemed as though he were  playing for her alone. Nor did she appear unworthy of such homage, for  when the barge ran into the little haven and Haschim could distinguish  her features he was startled by her noble and purely Greek beauty.    A few handsomely-dressed slaves, who must have come with the vehicle by  the road, now went on board the boat to carry their invalid lord to his  chariot; and it then became apparent that the seat in which he reclined  was provided with arms by which it could be lifted and moved. A burly  negro took this at the back, but just as another was stooping to lift it  in front Orion pushed him away and took his place, raised the couch with  his father on it, and carried him across the landing-stage between the  deck and the shore, past Haschim to the chariot. The young man did the  work of bearer with cheerful ease, and looked affectionately at his  father while he shouted to the ladies--for only his mother and the  physician accompanied the invalid after carefully wrapping him in  shawls--to get out of the barge and wait for him. Then he went forward,  lighted by the torches which were carried before them.    \"Poor man!\" thought the merchant as he looked after the Mukaukas. \"But  to a man who has such a son to carry him the saddest and hardest lot  floats by like a cloud before the wind.\"    He was now ready to forgive Orion even the rejected flowers; and when  the young girl stepped on shore, the child clinging fondly to her arm,  he confessed to himself that Dame Susannah's little daughter would find  it hard indeed to hold her own by the side of this tall and royal vision  of beauty. What a form was this maiden's, and what princely bearing;  and how sweet and engaging the voice in which she named some of the  constellations to her little companion, and pointed out the comet which  was just rising!    Haschim was sitting in shadow; he could see without being seen, and  note all that took place on the bench, which was lighted by one of the  barge's lanterns. The unexpected entertainment gave him pleasure, for  everything that affected the governor's son roused his sympathy and  interest. The idea of forming an opinion of this remarkable young man  smiled on his fancy, and the sight of the beautiful girl who sat on the  bench yonder warmed his old heart. The child must certainly be Mary, the  governor's granddaughter.    Then the chariot started off, clattering away down the road, and in a  few minutes Orion came back to the rest of the party.    Alas! Poor little heiress of Susannah's wealth! How different was his  demeanor to this beautiful damsel from his treatment of that little  thing! His eyes rested on her face in rapture, his speech failed him now  and again as he addressed her, and what he said must be sometimes grave  and captivating and sometimes witty, for not she alone but the little  maid's governess listened to him eagerly, and when the fair one laughed  it was in particularly sweet, clear tones. There was something so  lofty in her mien that this frank expression of contentment was almost  startling; like a breath of perfume from some gorgeous flower which  seems created to rejoice the eye only. And she, to whom all that Orion  had to say was addressed, listened to him not only with deep attention,  but in a way which showed the merchant that she cared even more for  the speaker than for what he was so eager in expressing. If this maiden  wedded the governor's son, they would indeed be a pair! Taus, the  innkeeper's wife, now came out, a buxom and vigorous Egyptian woman of  middle age, carrying some of the puffs for which she was famous, and  which she had just made with her own hands. She also served them with  milk, grapes and other fruit, her eyes sparkling with delight and  gratified ambition; for the son of the great Mukaukas, the pride of the  city, who in former years had often been her visitor, and not only for  the sake of her cakes, in water parties with his gay companions--mostly  Greek officers who now were all dead and gone or exiles from the  country--now did her the honor to come here so soon after his return.  Her facile tongue knew no pause as she told him that she and her husband  had gone forth with the rest to welcome him at the triumphal arch near  Menes' Gate, and Emau with them, and the little one. Yes, Emau was  married now, and had called her first child Orion. And when the young  man asked Dame Taus whether Emau was as charming as ever and as like her  mother as she used to be, she shook her finger at him and asked in her  turn, as she pointed towards the young lady, whether the fickle bird at  whose departure so many had sighed, was to be caged at last, and whether  yon fair lady....    But Orion cut her short, saying that he was still his own master though  he already felt the noose round his neck; and the fair lady blushed even  more deeply than at the good woman's first question. He however soon  got over his awkwardness and gaily declared that the worthy Taus' little  daughter was one of the prettiest girls in Memphis, and had had quite as  many admirers as her excellent mother's puff-pastry. Taus was to greet  her kindly from him.    The landlady departed, much touched and flattered; Orion took up his  lute, and while the ladies refreshed themselves he did the maiden's  bidding and sang the song by Alcaeus which she asked for, in a rich  though subdued voice to the lute, playing it like a master. The young  girl's eyes were fixed on his lips, and again, he seemed to be making  music for her alone. When it was time to start homewards, and the ladies  returned to the barge, he went up to the inn to pay the reckoning. As  he presently returned alone the Arab saw him pick up a handkerchief that  the young lady had left on the table, and hastily press it to his lips  as he went towards the barge.    The gorgeous red blossoms had fared worse in the morning. The young  man's heart was given to that maiden on the water. She could not be his  sister; what then was the connection between them?    The merchant soon gained this information, for the guide on his return  could give it him. She was Paula, the daughter of Thomas, the famous  Greek general who had defended the city of Damascus so long and so  bravely against the armies of Islam. She was Mukaukas George's niece,  but her fortune was small; she was a poor relation of the family, and  after her father's disappearance--for his body had never been  found--she had been received into the governor's house out of pity  and charity--she, a Melchite! The interpreter had little to say in her  favor, by reason of her sect; and though he could find no flaw in  her beauty, he insisted on it that she was proud and ungracious, and  incapable of winning any man's love; only the child, little Mary--she,  to be sure, was very fond of her. It was no secret that even her uncle's  wife, worthy Neforis, did not care for her haughty niece and only  suffered her to please the invalid. And what business had a Melchite  at Memphis, under the roof of a good Jacobite? Every word the dragoman  spoke breathed the scorn which a mean and narrow-minded man is always  ready to heap on those who share the kindness of his own benefactors.    But this beautiful and lofty-looking daughter of a great man had  conquered the merchant's old heart, and his opinion of her was quite  unmoved by the Memphite's strictures. It was ere long confirmed indeed,  for Philip, the leech whom the guide had been to find, and whose  dignified personality inspired the Arab with confidence, was a daily  visitor to the governor, and he spoke of Paula as one of the most  perfect creatures that Heaven had ever formed in a happy hour. But the  Almighty seemed to have forgotten to care for his own masterpiece; for  years her life had been indeed a sad one.    The physician could promise the old man some mitigation of his  sufferings, and they liked each other so well that they parted the best  of friends, and not till a late hour.          CHAPTER III.    The Mukaukas' barge, urged forward by powerful rowers, made its way  smoothly down the river. On board there was whispering, and now and  again singing. Little Mary had dropped asleep on Paula's shoulder; the  Greek duenna gazed sometimes at the comet which filled her with terrors,  sometimes at Orion, whose handsome face had"]]]
