The Duke of Burgundy  despised the cautious policy of the King, and imputed to the faintness  of his courage that he sought by leagues, purchases, and other indirect  means those advantages which, in his place, the Duke would have snatched  with an armed hand. He likewise hated the King, not only for the  ingratitude he had manifested for former kindnesses, and for personal  injuries and imputations which the ambassadors of Louis had cast upon  him, when his father was yet alive, but also, and especially, because of  the support which he afforded in secret to the discontented citizens of  Ghent, Liege, and other great towns in Flanders. These turbulent cities,  jealous of their privileges, and proud of their wealth, were frequently  in a state of insurrection against their liege lords, the Dukes of  Burgundy, and never failed to find underhand countenance at the court  of Louis, who embraced every opportunity of fomenting disturbance within  the dominions of his overgrown vassal.    The contempt and hatred of the Duke were retaliated by Louis with equal  energy, though he used a thicker veil to conceal his sentiments. It  was impossible for a man of his profound sagacity not to despise the  stubborn obstinacy which never resigned its purpose, however fatal  perseverance might prove, and the headlong impetuosity which commenced  its career without allowing a moment's consideration for the obstacles  to be encountered. Yet the King hated Charles even more than he  contemned him, and his scorn and hatred were the more intense, that they  were mingled with fear; for he know that the onset of the mad bull, to  whom he likened the Duke of Burgundy, must ever be formidable, though  the animal makes it with shut eyes. It was not alone the wealth of the  Burgundian provinces, the discipline of the warlike inhabitants, and  the mass of their crowded population, which the King dreaded, for  the personal qualities of their leader had also much in them that was  dangerous. The very soul of bravery, which he pushed to the verge of  rashness, and beyond it--profuse in expenditure--splendid in his court,  his person, and his retinue, in all which he displayed the hereditary  magnificence of the house of Burgundy, Charles the Bold drew into his  service almost all the fiery spirits of the age whose tempers were  congenial; and Louis saw too clearly what might be attempted and  executed by such a train of resolute adventurers, following a leader of  a character as ungovernable as their own.    There was yet another circumstance which increased the animosity of  Louis towards his overgrown vassal; he owed him favours which he never  meant to repay, and was under the frequent necessity of temporizing with  him, and even of enduring bursts of petulant insolence, injurious to  the regal dignity, without being able to treat him otherwise than as his  \"fair cousin of Burgundy.\"    It was about the year 1468, when their feuds were at the highest, though  a dubious and hollow truce, as frequently happened, existed for the  time betwixt them, that the present narrative opens. The person first  introduced on the stage will be found indeed to be of a rank and  condition, the illustration of whose character scarcely called for a  dissertation on the relative position of two great princes; but the  passions of the great, their quarrels, and their reconciliations  involve the fortunes of all who approach them; and it will be found,  on proceeding farther in our story, that this preliminary chapter  is necessary for comprehending the history of the individual whose  adventures we are about to relate.        CHAPTER II: THE WANDERER         Why then the world's mine oyster, which I with sword will open.         ANCIENT PISTOL      It was upon a delicious summer morning, before the sun had assumed its  scorching power, and while the dews yet cooled and perfumed the air,  that a youth, coming from the northeastward approached the ford of a  small river, or rather a large brook, tributary to the Cher, near to the  royal Castle of Plessis les Tours, whose dark and multiplied battlements  rose in the background over the extensive forest with which they were  surrounded. These woodlands comprised a noble chase, or royal park,  fenced by an enclosure, termed, in the Latin of the middle ages,  Plexitium, which gives the name of Plessis to so many villages in  France. The castle and village of which we particularly speak, was  called Plessis les Tours, to distinguish it from others, and was built  about two miles to the southward of the fair town of that name, the  capital of ancient Touraine, whose rich plain has been termed the Garden  of France.    On the bank of the above mentioned brook, opposite to that which the  traveller was approaching, two men, who appeared in deep conversation,  seemed, from time to time, to watch his motions; for, as their station  was much more elevated, they could remark him at considerable distance.    The age of the young traveller might be about nineteen, or betwixt that  and twenty; and his face and person, which were very prepossessing, did  not, however, belong to the country in which he was now a sojourner. His  short gray cloak and hose were rather of Flemish than of French fashion,  while the smart blue bonnet, with a single sprig of holly and an eagle's  feather, was already recognized as the Scottish head gear. His dress  was very neat, and arranged with the precision of a youth conscious of  possessing a fine person. He had at his back a satchel, which seemed to  contain a few necessaries, a hawking gauntlet on his left hand, though  he carried no bird, and in his right a stout hunter's pole. Over his  left shoulder hung an embroidered scarf which sustained a small pouch of  scarlet velvet, such as was then used by fowlers of distinction to carry  their hawks' food, and other matters belonging to that much admired  sport. This was crossed by another shoulder belt, to which was hung a  hunting knife, or couteau de chasse. Instead of the boots of the period,  he wore buskins of half dressed deer's skin.    Although his form had not yet attained its full strength, he was tall  and active, and the lightness of the step with which he advanced, showed  that his pedestrian mode of travelling was pleasure rather than pain to  him. His complexion was fair, in spite of a general shade of darker  hue, with which the foreign sun, or perhaps constant exposure to the  atmosphere in his own country, had, in some degree, embrowned it.    His features, without being quite regular, were frank, open, and  pleasing. A half smile, which seemed to arise from a happy exuberance of  animal spirits, showed now and then that his teeth were well set, and as  pure as ivory; whilst his bright blue eye, with a corresponding gaiety,  had an appropriate glance for every object which it encountered,  expressing good humour, lightness of heart, and determined resolution.    He received and returned the salutation of the few travellers who  frequented the road in those dangerous times with the action which  suited each. The strolling spearman, half soldier, half brigand,  measured the youth with his eye, as if balancing the prospect of booty  with the chance of desperate resistance; and read such indications of  the latter in the fearless glance of the passenger, that he changed his  ruffian purpose for a surly \"Good morrow, comrade,\" which the young  Scot answered with as martial, though a less sullen tone. The wandering  pilgrim, or the begging friar, answered his reverent greeting with  a paternal benedicite [equivalent to the English expression, \"Bless  you.\"]; and the dark eyed peasant girl looked after him for many a  step after they had passed each other, and interchanged a laughing good  morrow. In short, there was an attraction about his whole appearance not  easily escaping attention, and which was derived from the combination of  fearless frankness and good humour, with sprightly looks and a handsome  face and person. It seemed, too, as if his whole demeanour bespoke one  who was entering on life with no apprehension of the evils with which  it is beset, and small means for struggling with its hardships, except a  lively spirit and a courageous disposition; and it is with such tempers  that youth most readily sympathizes, and for whom chiefly age and  experience feel affectionate and pitying interest.    The youth whom we have described had been long visible to the two  persons who loitered on the opposite side of the small river which  divided him from the park and the castle; but as he descended the rugged  bank to the water's edge, with the light step of a roe which visits the  fountain, the younger of the two said to the other, \"It is our man--it  is the Bohemian! If he attempts to cross the ford, he is a lost man--the  water is up, and the ford impassable.\"    \"Let him make that discovery himself, gossip [an intimate friend or  companion (obsolete)],\" said the elder personage; \"it may, perchance,  save a rope and break a proverb [refers to the old saw, 'Who is born to  be hanged will never be drowned.'].\"    \"I judge him by the blue cap,\" said the other, \"for I cannot see his  face. Hark, sir; he hallooes to know whether the water be deep.\"    \"Nothing like experience in this world,\" answered the other, \"let him  try.\"    The young man, in the meanwhile, receiving no hint to the contrary, and  taking the silence of those to whom he applied as an encouragement to  proceed, entered the stream without farther hesitation than the delay  necessary to take off his buskins. The elder person, at the same moment,  hallooed to him to beware, adding, in a lower tone, to his companion,  \"Mortdieu--gossip--you have made another mistake--this is not the  Bohemian chatterer.\"    But the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7864"],[0,"The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose (#4)"],[1,"said, they were; while a few  asked how they could be his offspring, seeing he had been so long dead.  Still on all sides voices were heard crying, 'They are on all accounts  welcome! Through divine Providence we behold the family of Pandu! Let  their welcome be proclaimed!' As these acclamations ceased, the plaudits  of invisible spirits, causing every point of the heavens to resound, were  tremendous. There were showers of sweet-scented flowers, and the sound of  shells and kettle-drums. Such were the wonders that happened on the  arrival of the young princes. The joyful noise of all the citizens, in  expression of their satisfaction on the occasion, was so great that it  reached the very heavens in magnifying plaudits.    \"Having studied the whole of the Vedas and sundry other shastras, the  Pandavas resided there, respected by all and without apprehension from any  one.    \"The principal men were pleased with the purity of Yudhishthira, the  courage of Arjuna, the submissive attention of Kunti to her superiors, and  the humility of the twins, Nakula and Sahadeva; and all the people  rejoiced in their heroic virtues.    \"After a while, Arjuna obtained the virgin Krishna at the swayamvara, in  the midst of a concourse of Rajas, by performing a very difficult feat of  archery. And from this time he became very much respected in this world  among all bowmen; and in fields of battle also, like the sun, he was hard  to behold by foe-men. And having vanquished all the neighbouring princes  and every considerable tribe, he accomplished all that was necessary for  the Raja (his eldest brother) to perform the great sacrifice called  Rajasuya.    \"Yudhishthira, after having, through the wise counsels of Vasudeva and by  the valour of Bhimasena and Arjuna, slain Jarasandha (the king of Magadha)  and the proud Chaidya, acquired the right to perform the grand sacrifice  of Rajasuya abounding in provisions and offering and fraught with  transcendent merits. And Duryodhana came to this sacrifice; and when he  beheld the vast wealth of the Pandavas scattered all around, the offerings,  the precious stones, gold and jewels; the wealth in cows, elephants, and  horses; the curious textures, garments, and mantles; the precious shawls  and furs and carpets made of the skin of the Ranku; he was filled with  envy and became exceedingly displeased. And when he beheld the hall of  assembly elegantly constructed by Maya (the Asura architect) after the  fashion of a celestial court, he was inflamed with rage. And having  started in confusion at certain architectural deceptions within this  building, he was derided by Bhimasena in the presence of Vasudeva, like  one of mean descent.    \"And it was represented to Dhritarashtra that his son, while partaking of  various objects of enjoyment and diverse precious things, was becoming  meagre, wan, and pale. And Dhritarashtra, some time after, out of  affection for his son, gave his consent to their playing (with the  Pandavas) at dice. And Vasudeva coming to know of this, became exceedingly  wroth. And being dissatisfied, he did nothing to prevent the disputes, but  overlooked the gaming and sundry other horried unjustifiable transactions  arising therefrom: and in spite of Vidura, Bhishma, Drona, and Kripa, the  son of Saradwan, he made the Kshatriyas kill each other in the terrific  war that ensued.    \"And Dhritarashtra hearing the ill news of the success of the Pandavas and  recollecting the resolutions of Duryodhana, Karna, and Sakuni, pondered for  a while and addressed to Sanjaya the following speech:--    \"'Attend, O Sanjaya, to all I am about to say, and it will not become thee  to treat me with contempt. Thou art well-versed in the shastras,  intelligent and endowed with wisdom. My inclination was never to war, not  did I delight in the destruction of my race. I made no distinction between  my own children and the children of Pandu. My own sons were prone to  wilfulness and despised me because I am old. Blind as I am, because of my  miserable plight and through paternal affection, I bore it all. I was  foolish after the thoughtless Duryodhana ever growing in folly. Having  been a spectator of the riches of the mighty sons of Pandu, my son was  derided for his awkwardness while ascending the hall. Unable to bear it  all and unable himself to overcome the sons of Pandu in the field, and  though a soldier, unwilling yet to obtain good fortune by his own exertion,  with the help of the king of Gandhara he concerted an unfair game at dice.    \"'Hear, O Sanjaya, all that happened thereupon and came to my knowledge.  And when thou hast heard all I say, recollecting everything as it fell out,  thou shall then know me for one with a prophetic eye. When I heard that  Arjuna, having bent the bow, had pierced the curious mark and brought it  down to the ground, and bore away in triumph the maiden Krishna, in the  sight of the assembled princes, then, O Sanjaya I had no hope of success.  When I heard that Subhadra of the race of Madhu had, after forcible  seizure been married by Arjuna in the city of Dwaraka, and that the two  heroes of the race of Vrishni (Krishna and Balarama the brothers of  Subhadra) without resenting it had entered Indraprastha as friends, then,  O Sanjaya, I had no hope of success. When I heard that Arjuna, by his  celestial arrow preventing the downpour by Indra the king of the gods, had  gratified Agni by making over to him the forest of Khandava, then, O  Sanjaya, I had no hope of success. When I heard that the five Pandavas  with their mother Kunti had escaped from the house of lac, and that Vidura  was engaged in the accomplishment of their designs, then, O Sanjaya, I had  no hope of success. When I heard that Arjuna, after having pierced the  mark in the arena had won Draupadi, and that the brave Panchalas had  joined the Pandavas, then, O Sanjaya, I had no hope of success. When I  heard that Jarasandha, the foremost of the royal line of Magadha, and  blazing in the midst of the Kshatriyas, had been slain by Bhima with his  bare arms alone, then, O Sanjaya, I had no hope of success. When I heard  that in their general campaign the sons of Pandu had conquered the chiefs  of the land and performed the grand sacrifice of the Rajasuya, then, O  Sanjaya, I had no hope of success. When I heard that Draupadi, her voice  choked with tears and heart full of agony, in the season of impurity and  with but one raiment on, had been dragged into court and though she had  protectors, she had been treated as if she had none, then, O Sanjaya, I  had no hope of success. When I heard that the wicked wretch Duhsasana, was  striving to strip her of that single garment, had only drawn from her  person a large heap of cloth without being able to arrive at its end, then,  O Sanjaya, I had no hope of success. When I heard that Yudhishthira,  beaten by Saubala at the game of dice and deprived of his kingdom as a  consequence thereof, had still been attended upon by his brothers of  incomparable prowess, then, O Sanjaya, I had no hope of success. When I  heard that the virtuous Pandavas weeping with affliction had followed  their elder brother to the wilderness and exerted themselves variously for  the mitigation of his discomforts, then, O Sanjaya, I had no hope of  success.    \"'When I heard that Yudhishthira had been followed into the wilderness by  Snatakas and noble-minded Brahmanas who live upon alms, then, O Sanjaya, I  had no hope of success. When I heard that Arjuna, having, in combat,  pleased the god of gods, Tryambaka (the three-eyed) in the disguise of a  hunter, obtained the great weapon Pasupata, then O Sanjaya, I had no hope  of success. When I heard that the just and renowned Arjuna after having  been to the celestial regions, had there obtained celestial weapons from  Indra himself then, O Sanjaya, I had no hope of success. When I heard that  afterwards Arjuna had vanquished the Kalakeyas and the Paulomas proud with  the boon they had obtained and which had rendered them invulnerable even  to the celestials, then, O Sanjaya, I had no hope of success. When I heard  that Arjuna, the chastiser of enemies, having gone to the regions of Indra  for the destruction of the Asuras, had returned thence successful, then, O  Sanjaya, I had no hope of success. When I heard that Bhima and the other  sons of Pritha (Kunti) accompanied by Vaisravana had arrived at that  country which is inaccessible to man then, O Sanjaya, I had no hope of  success. When I heard that my sons, guided by the counsels of Karna, while  on their journey of Ghoshayatra, had been taken prisoners by the  Gandharvas and were set free by Arjuna, then, O Sanjaya, I had no hope of  success. When I heard that Dharma (the god of justice) having come under  the form of a Yaksha had proposed certain questions to Yudhishthira then,  O Sanjaya, I had no hope of success. When I heard that my sons had failed  to discover the Pandavas under their disguise while residing with Draupadi  in the dominions of Virata, then, O Sanjaya, I had no hope of success.  When I heard that the principal men of my side had all been vanquished by  the noble Arjuna with a single chariot while residing in the dominions of  Virata, then, O Sanjaya, I had no hope of success. When I heard that  Vasudeva of the race of Madhu, who covered this whole earth by one foot,  was heartily interested in the welfare of the Pandavas, then, O Sanjaya, I  had no hope of success. When I heard that the king of Matsya, had offered  his virtuous daughter Uttara to Arjuna and that Arjuna had accepted her  for his son, then, O Sanjaya, I had no hope of success. When I heard that  Yudhishthira, beaten at dice, deprived of wealth, exiled and separated  from his connections, had assembled yet an army of seven Akshauhinis, then,  O Sanjaya, I had no hope of success.
