Corn, which had been excessively dear in anticipation of a  year of scarcity, suddenly became plentiful; and such was the  diminution in the value of provisions, that seven sheep were sold for  five deniers.[Guibert de Nogent] The nobles mortgaged their estates for  mere trifles to Jews and unbelievers, or conferred charters of immunity  upon the towns and communes within their fiefs, for sums which, a few  years previously, they would have rejected with disdain. The farmer  endeavoured to sell his plough, and the artisan his tools, to purchase  a sword for the deliverance of Jerusalem. Women disposed of their  trinkets for the same purpose. During the spring and summer of this  year (1096) the roads teemed with crusaders, all hastening to the towns  and villages appointed as the rendezvous of the district. Some were on  horseback, some in carts, and some came down the rivers in boats and  rafts, bringing their wives and children, all eager to go to Jerusalem.  Very few knew where Jerusalem was. Some thought it fifty thousand miles  away, while others imagined that it was but a month's journey, while at  sight of every town or castle, the children exclaimed, \"Is that  Jerusalem? Is that the city?\" [Guibert de Nogent]  Parties of knights  and nobles might be seen travelling eastward, and amusing themselves as  they went with the knightly diversion of hawking to lighten the  fatigues of the way.    Guibert de Nogent, who did not write from hearsay, but from actual  observation, says, the enthusiasm was so contagious, that when any one  heard the orders of the Pontiff, he went instantly to solicit his  neighbours and friends to join with him in \"the way of God,\" for so  they called the proposed expedition. The Counts Palatine were full of  the desire to undertake the journey, and all the inferior knights were  animated with the same zeal. Even the poor caught the flame so  ardently, that no one paused to think of the inadequacy of his means,  or to consider whether he ought to yield up his house and his vine and  his fields. Each one set about selling his property, at as low a price  as if he had been held in some horrible captivity, and sought to pay  his ransom without loss of time. Those who had not determined upon the  journey, joked and laughed at those who were thus disposing of their  goods at such ruinous prices, prophesying that the expedition would be  miserable and their return worse. But they held this language only for  a day. The next, they were suddenly seized with the same frenzy as the  rest. Those who had been loudest in their jeers gave up all their  property for a few crowns, and set out with those they had so laughed  at a few hours before. In most cases the laugh was turned against them,  for when it became known that a man was hesitating, his more zealous  neighbours sent him a present of a knitting needle or a distaff, to  show their contempt of him. There was no resisting this, so that the  fear of ridicule contributed its fair contingent to the armies of the  Lord.    Another effect of the crusade was, the religious obedience with which  it inspired the people and the nobility for that singular institution  \"The Truce of God.\"  At the commencement of the eleventh century, the  clergy of France, sympathizing for the woes of the people, but unable  to diminish them, by repressing the rapacity and insolence of the  feudal chiefs, endeavoured to promote universal good-will by the  promulgation of the famous \"Peace of God.\" All who conformed to it  bound themselves by oath not to take revenge for any injury, not to  enjoy the fruits of property usurped from others, nor to use deadly  weapons; in reward of which they would receive remission of all their  sins. However benevolent the intention of this \"Peace,\" it led to  nothing but perjury, and violence reigned as uncontrolled as before. In  the year 1041 another attempt was made to soften the angry passions of  the semi-barbarous chiefs, and the \"Truce of God\" was solemnly  proclaimed. The truce lasted from the Wednesday evening to the Monday  morning of every week, in which interval it was strictly forbidden to  recur to violence on any pretext, or to seek revenge for any injury. It  was impossible to civilize men by these means; few even promised to  become peaceable for so unconscionable a period as five days a week;  or, if they did, they made ample amends on the two days left open to  them. The truce was afterwards shortened from the Saturday evening to  the Monday morning; but little or no diminution of violence and  bloodshed was the consequence. At the council of Clermont, Urban II.  again solemnly proclaimed the truce. So strong was the religious  feeling, that every one hastened to obey. All minor passions  disappeared before the grand passion of crusading; the noble ceased to  oppress, the robber to plunder, and the people to complain; but one  idea was in all hearts, and there seemed to be no room for any other.    The encampments of these heterogeneous multitudes offered a singular  aspect. Those vassals who ranged themselves under the banners of their  lord, erected tents around his castle; while those who undertook the  war on their own account, constructed booths and huts in the  neighbourhood of the towns or villages, preparatory to their joining  some popular leader of the expedition. The meadows of France were  covered with tents. As the belligerents were to have remission of all  their sins on their arrival in Palestine, hundreds of them gave  themselves up to the most unbounded licentiousness: the courtezan, with  the red cross upon her shoulders, plied her shameless trade with  sensual pilgrims, without scruple on either side: the lover of good  cheer gave loose rein to his appetite, and drunkenness and debauchery  flourished. Their zeal in the service of the Lord was to wipe out all  faults and follies, and they had the same surety of salvation as the  rigid anchorite. This reasoning had charms for the ignorant, and the  sounds of lewd revelry and the voice of prayer rose at the same instant  from the camp.    It is now time to speak of the leaders of the expedition. Great  multitudes ranged themselves under the command of Peter the Hermit,  whom, as the originator, they considered the most appropriate leader of  the war. Others joined the banner of a bold adventurer, whom history  has dignified with no other name than that of Gautier sans Avoir, or  Walter the Pennyless, but who is represented as having been of noble  family, and well skilled in the art of war. A third multitude from  Germany flocked around the standard of a monk, named Gottschalk, of  whom nothing is known, except that he was a fanatic of the deepest dye.  All these bands, which together are said to have amounted to three  hundred thousand men, women, and children, were composed of the vilest  rascality of Europe. Without discipline, principle, or true courage,  they rushed through the nations like a pestilence, spreading terror and  death wherever they went. The first multitude that set forth was led by  Walter the Pennyless early in the spring of 1096, within a very few  months after the Council of Clermont. Each man of that irregular host  aspired to be his own master: like their nominal leader, each was poor  to penury, and trusted for subsistence on his journey to the chances of  the road. Rolling through Germany like a tide, they entered Hungary,  where, at first, they were received with some degree of kindness by the  people. The latter had not yet caught sufficient of the fire of  enthusiasm to join the crusade themselves, but were willing enough to  forward the cause by aiding those embarked in it. Unfortunately, this  good understanding did not last long. The swarm were not contented with  food for their necessities, but craved for luxuries also: they attacked  and plundered the dwellings of the country people, and thought nothing  of murder where resistance was offered. On their arrival before Semlin,  the outraged Hungarians collected in large numbers, and, attacking the  rear of the crusading host, slew a great many of the stragglers, and,  taking away their arms and crosses, affixed them as trophies to the  walls of the city. Walter appears to have been in no mood or condition  to make reprisals; for his army, destructive as a plague of locusts  when plunder urged them on, were useless against any regular attack  from a determined enemy.  Their rear continued to be thus harassed by  the wrathful Hungarians until they were fairly out of their territory.  On his entrance into Bulgaria, Walter met with no better fate; the  cities and towns refused to let him pass; the villages denied him  provisions; and the citizens and country people uniting, slaughtered  his followers by hundreds. The progress of the army was more like a  retreat than an advance; but as it was impossible to stand still,  Walter continued his course till he arrived at Constantinople, with a  force which famine and the sword had diminished to one-third of its  original number.    The greater multitude, led by the enthusiastic Hermit, followed close  upon his heels, with a bulky train of baggage, and women and children,  sufficient to form a host of themselves. If it were possible to find a  rabble more vile than the army of Walter the Pennyless it was that led  by Peter the Hermit. Being better provided with means, they were not  reduced to the necessity of pillage in their progress through Hungary;  and had they taken any other route than that which led through Semlin,  might perhaps have traversed the country without molestation. On their  arrival before that city, their fury was raised at seeing the arms and  red crosses of their predecessors hanging as trophies over the gates.  Their pent-up ferocity exploded at the sight.  The city was  tumultuously attacked, and the besiegers entering, not by dint of  bravery, but of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/714"],[0,"The Bobbsey Twins in the Country (#4)"],[1,"him with all his might, to save a  chill as he told the boys.    Then, after receiving many thanks for the help given, the Bobbseys once  more started off toward the farm.    \"Hot work,\" Uncle Daniel remarked to the ladies, as he mopped his  forehead.    \"I'm so glad you could help Peter,\" Aunt Sarah told him, \"for he does  seem to have SO much trouble.\"    \"All kinds of things happen in the country,\" Harry remarked, as Billy  headed off for home.    At each house along the way boys would call out to Harry, asking him  about going fishing, or berrying, or some other sport, so that Bert  felt a good time was in store for him, as the boys were about his own  age and seemed so agreeable.    \"Nice fellows,\" Harry remarked by way of introducing Bert.    \"They seem so,\" Bert replied, cordially.    \"We've made up a lot of sports,\" Harry went on, \"and we were only  waiting for you to come to start out. We've planned a picnic for  to-morrow.\"    \"Here we are,\" called Uncle Daniel as Billy turned into the pretty  driveway in front of the Bobbseys' country home. On each side of the  drive grew straight lines of boxwood, and back of this hedge were  beautiful flowers, shining out grandly now in the July sun.    \"Hello, Martha!\" called the visitors, as the faithful old servant  appeared on the broad white veranda. She was not black like Dinah, but  looked as if she was just as merry and full of fun as anyone could be.    \"Got here at last!\" she exclaimed, taking Dinah's lunch basket.    \"Glad to see you, Martha,\" Dinah told her. \"You see, I had to come  along. And Snoop too, our kitty. We fetched him.\"    \"The more the merrier,\" replied the other, \"and there's lots of room  for all.\"    \"Starved to death!\" Harry laughed, as the odor of a fine dinner reached  him.    \"We'll wash up a bit and join you in a few minutes, ladies,\" Uncle  Daniel said, in his polite way. The horse accident had given plenty of  need for a washing up.    \"Got Snoop dis time,\" Freddie lisped, knocking the cover off the box  and petting the frightened little black cat. \"Hungry, Snoopy?\" he  asked, pressing his baby cheek to the soft fur.    \"Bring the poor kitty out to the kitchen,\" Martha told him. \"I'll get  him a nice saucer of fresh milk.\" And so it happened, as usual, Snoop  had his meal first, just as he had had on the Pullman car. Soon after  this Martha went outside and rang a big dinner bell that all the men  and boys could hear. And then the first vacation dinner was served in  the long old-fashioned dining room.        CHAPTER VI    FRISKY    Although they were tired from their journey, the children had no idea  of resting on that beautiful afternoon, so promptly after dinner the  baggage was opened, and vacation clothes were put on. Bert, of course,  was ready first; and soon he and Harry were running down the road to  meet the other boys and perfect their plans for the picnic.    Nan began her pleasures by exploring the flower gardens with Uncle  Daniel.    \"I pride myself on those zinnias,\" the uncle told Nan, \"just see those  yellows, and those pinks. Some are as big as dahlias, aren't they?\"    \"They are just beautiful, uncle,\" Nan replied, in real admiration. \"I  have always loved zinnias. And they last so long?\"    \"All summer. Then, what do you think of my sweet peas?\"    So they went from one flower bed to another, and Nan thought she had  never before seen so many pretty plants together.    Flossie and Freddie were out in the barnyard with Aunt Sarah.    \"Oh, auntie, what queer little chickens!\" Flossie exclaimed, pointing  to a lot of pigeons that were eagerly eating corn with the chickens.    \"Those are Harry's homer pigeons,\" the aunt explained. \"Some day we  must go off to the woods and let the birds fly home with a letter to  Dinah and Martha.\"    \"Oh, please do it now,\" Freddie urged, always in a hurry for things.    \"We couldn't to-day, dear,\" Aunt Sarah told him. \"Come, let me show you  our new little calf.\"    \"Let me ride her?\" Freddie asked, as they reached the animal.    \"Calfs aren't for riding, they're for milk,\" Flossie spoke up.    \"Yes, this one drinks plenty of milk,\" Aunt Sarah said, while Frisky,  the calf, rubbed her head kindly against Aunt Sarah's skirts.    \"Then let me take her for a walk,\" Freddie pleaded, much in love with  the pretty creature.    \"And they don't walk either,\" Flossie persisted. \"They mostly run.\"    \"I could just hold the rope, couldn't I, Aunt Sarah?\"    \"If you keep away from the barnyard gate, and hold her very tight,\" was  the consent given finally, much to Freddie's delight.    \"Nice Frisky,\" he told the calf, petting her fondly. \"Pretty calf, will  you let Snoop play with you?\" Frisky was sniffing suspiciously all the  time, and Aunt Sarah had taken Flossie in the barn to see the chickens'  nests.    \"Come, Frisky, take a walk,\" suggested Freddie, and quite obediently  the little cow walked along. But suddenly Frisky spied the open gate  and the lovely green grass outside.    Without a moment's warning the calf threw her hind legs up in the air,  then bolted straight for the gate, dragging Freddie along after her.    \"Whoa, Frisky! whoa!\" yelled Freddie, but the calf ran right along.    \"Hold tight, Freddie!\" called Flossie, as she and Aunt Sarah appeared  on the scene.    \"Whoa, whoa!\" yelled the little boy constantly, but he might as well  have called \"Get app,\" for Frisky was going so fast now that poor  little Freddie's hands were all but bleeding from the rough rope.    \"Look out, Freddie! Let go!\" called Aunt Sarah as she saw Frisky  heading for the apple tree.    The next minute Frisky made a dash around the tree, once, then again,  winding the rope as she went, and throwing Freddie out with force  against the side of the terrace.    \"Oh,\" Freddie moaned feebly.    \"Are you dead?\" cried Flossie, running up with tears in her eyes.    \"Oh,\" moaned the boy again, turning over with much trouble as Aunt  Sarah lifted him.    \"Oh,\" he murmured once more, \"oh--catch--Frisky!\"    \"Never mind her,\" Aunt Sarah said, anxiously. \"Are you hurt, dear!\"    \"No--not--a bit. But look! There goes Frisky! Catch her!\"    \"Your poor little hands!\" Flossie almost cried, kissing the red  blisters. \"See, they're cut!\"    \"Firemen have to slide on ropes!\" Freddie spoke up, recovering himself,  \"and I'm going to be a fireman. I was one that time, because I tried to  save somebody and didn't care if I got hurted!\"    \"You are a brave little boy,\" Aunt Sarah assured him. \"You just sit  here with sister while I try to get that naughty Frisky before she  spoils the garden.\"    By this time the calf was almost lost to them, as she plunged in and  out of the pretty hedges. Fortunately Bert and Harry just turned in the  gate.    \"Runaway calf! Runaway calf!\" called the boys. \"Stop the runaway!\" and  instantly a half-dozen other boys appeared, and all started in pursuit.    But Frisky knew how to run, besides she had the advantage of a good  start, and now she just dashed along as if the affair was the biggest  joke of her life.    \"The river! The river!\" called the boys    \"She'll jump in!\" and indeed the pretty Meadow Brook, or river, that  ran along some feet lower than the Bobbseys' house, on the other side  of the highway, was now dangerously near the runaway calf.    There was a heavy thicket a few feet further up, and as the boys  squeezed in and out of the bushes Frisky plunged into this piece of  wood.    \"Oh, she's gone now, sure!\" called Harry \"Listen!\"    Sure enough there was a splash!    Frisky must be in the river!    It took some time to reach the spot where the fall might have sounded  from, and the boys made their way heavy-hearted, for all loved the  pretty little Frisky.    \"There's footprints!\" Bert discovered emerging from the thick bush.    \"And they end here!\" Harry finished, indicating the very brink of the  river.    \"She's gone!\"    \"But how could she drown so quickly?\" Bert asked.    \"Guess that's the channel,\" Tom Mason, one of the neighbors' boys,  answered.    \"Listen! Thought I heard something in the bushes!\" Bert whispered.    But no welcome sound came to tell that poor Frisky was hiding in the  brushwood. With heavy hearts the boys turned away. They didn't even  feel like talking, somehow. They had counted on bringing the calf back  in  triumph.    When Flossie and Freddie saw them coming back without Frisky they just  had to cry and no one could stop them.    \"I tried to be a fireman!\" blubbered Freddie. \"I didn't care if the  rope hurted my hands either!\"    \"If only I didn't go in to see the chickens nests,\" Flossie whimpered,  \"I could have helped Freddie!\"    \"Never you mind, little 'uns,\" Dinah told them. \"Dinah go and fetch dat  Frisky back to-morrer. See if she don't. You jest don't cry no more,  but eat you supper and take a good sleep, 'cause we're goin' to have a  picnic to-morrer you knows, doesn't youse?\"    The others tried to comfort the little ones too, and Uncle Daniel said  he knew where he could buy another calf just like Frisky, so after a  little while Freddie felt better and even laughed when Martha made the  white cat Fluffy and Snoop play ball in the big long kitchen.    \"I'm goin' to pray Frisky will come back,\" Nan told her little brother  when she kissed him good-night, \"and maybe the dear Lord will find her  for you.\"    \"Oh, yes, Nannie, do ask Him,\" pleaded Freddie, \"and tell Him--tell Him  if He'll do it this time, I'll be so good I won't never need to bother  Him any more.\"    Freddie meant very well, but it sounded strange, and made Aunt Sarah  say, \"The Lord bless the little darling!\" Then night came and an  eventful day closed in on our dear little Bobbseys.    \"Seems as if something else ought to happen to-night,\" Bert remarked to  Harry as they prepared to retire. \"This was such a full day, wasn't it?\"    \"It's early yet,\" Harry answered, \"and it's never late here until it's  time to get early again.\"    \"Sounds so strange to"]]]
