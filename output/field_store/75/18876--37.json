If we happen  to speak of such things, we say: 'I'm right off down  East; or I'm away off South,' and away we go, jist like  a streak of lightning.    When we want folks to talk, we pay 'em for it, such as  ministers, lawyers, and members of congress: but then we  expect the use of their tongues, and not their hands;  and when we pay folks to work, we expect the use of their  hands, and not their tongues. I guess work don't come  kind o' natural to the people of this Province, no more  than it does to a full bred horse. I expect they think  they have a little TOO MUCH BLOOD in 'em for work, for  they are near about as proud as they are lazy.    Now the bees know how to sarve out such chaps, for they  have their drones too. Well they reckon its no fun, a  making honey all summer, for these idle critters to eat  all winter--so they give 'em Lynch Law. They have a  regular built mob of citizens, and string up the drones  like the Vixburg gamblers. Their maxim is, and not a bad  one neither I guess, 'no work, no honey.'          No. IV    Conversations at the River Philip.    It was late before we arrived at Pugnose's Inn--the  evening was cool, and a fire was cheering and comfortable.  Mr. Slick declined any share in the bottle of wine, he  said he was dyspeptic; and a glass or two soon convinced  me, that it was likely to produce in me something worse  than dyspepsy. It was speedily removed and we drew up to  the fire. Taking a small penknife from his pocket, he  began to whittle a thin piece of dry wood, which lay on  the hearth; and, after musing some time said, I guess  you've never been in the States. I replied that I had  not, but that before I returned to England I proposed  visiting that country. There, said he, you'll see the  great Daniel Webster--he's a great man, I tell you; King  William, number 4, I guess, would be no match for him as  an orator--he'd talk him out of sight in half an hour.  If he was in your house of Commons, I reckon he'd make  some of your great folks look pretty streaked--he's a  true patriot and statesman, the first in our country,  and a most particular cute Lawyer. There was a Quaker  chap too cute for him once tho'. This Quaker, a pretty  knowin' old shaver, had a cause down to Rhode Island; so  he went to Daniel to hire him to go down and plead his  case for him; so says he, Lawyer Webster what's your fee?  Why, says Daniel, let me see, I have to go down south to  Washington, to plead the great Insurance case of the  Hartford Company--and I've got to be at Cincinnati to  attend the Convention, and I don't see how I can go to  Rhode Island without great loss and great fatigue; it  would cost you may be more than you'd be willing to give.  Well, the Quaker looked pretty white about the gills, I  tell you, when he heard this, for he could not do without  him no how, and he did not like this preliminary talk of  his at all--at last he made bold to ask him the worst of  it, what he would take; why, says Daniel, I always liked  the Quakers, they are a quiet peaceable people who never  go to law if they can help it, and it would be better  for our great country if there were more such people in  it. I never seed or heerd tell of any harm in em except  going the whole figure for Gineral Jackson, and that  everlastin almighty villain, Van Buren; yes, I love the  Quakers, I hope they'll go the Webster ticket yet--and  I'll go for you as low as I can any way afford, say 1,000  dollars. The Quaker well nigh fainted when he heerd this,  but he was pretty deep too: so, says he, Lawyer, that's  a great deal of money, but I have more causes there, if  I give you the 1000 dollars will you plead the other  cases I shall have to give you? Yes, says Daniel, I will  to the best of my humble abilities; so down they went to  Rhode Island, and Daniel tried the case and carried it  for the Quaker. Well, the Quaker he goes round to all  the folks that had suits in court, and says he what will  you give me if I get the great Daniel to plead for you?  It cost me 1000 dollars for a fee, but now he and I are  pretty thick, and as he is on the spot, I'd get him to  plead cheap for you--so he got three hundred dollars from  one, and two from another and so on, until he got eleven  hundred dollars, jist one hundred dollars more than he  gave. Daniel was in a great rage when he heerd this;  what, said he, do you think I would agree to your letting  me out like a horse to hire? Friend Daniel, said the  Quaker, didst thou not undertake to plead all such cases  as I should have to give thee? If thou wilt not stand to  thy agreement, neither will I stand to mine. Daniel  laughed out ready to split his sides at this. Well, says  he, I guess I might as well stand still for you to put  the bridle on this time, for you have fairly pinned me  up in a corner of the fence any how--so he went good  humouredly to work and pleaded them all.    This lazy fellow, Pugnose, continued the Clockmaker; that  keeps this inn, is going to sell off and go to the States;  he says he has to work too hard here; that the markets  are dull, and the winters too long; and he guesses he  can live easier there; I guess he'll find his mistake  afore he has been there long. Why our country aim to be  compared to this, on no account whatever; our country  never made us to be the great nation we are, but we made  the country. How on airth could we, if we were all like  old Pugnose, as lazy as ugly, make that cold thin soil  of New-England produce what it does? Why, Sir, the land  between Boston and Salem would starve a flock of geese;  and yet look at Salem, it has more cash than would buy  Nova Scotia from the King. We rise early, live frugally,  and work late: what we get we take care of. To all this  we add enterprise and intelligence--a feller who finds  work too hard here, had better not go to the States. I  met an Irishman, one Pat Lannigan, last week, who had  just returned from the States; why, says I, Pat, what on  airth brought you back? Bad luck to them, says Pat, if  I warn't properly bit. What do you get a day in Nova  Scotia? says Judge Beler to me. Four shillings, your  Lordship, says I. There are no Lords here, says he, we  are all free. Well, says he, I'll give you as much in  one day as you can earn there in two; I'll give you eight  shillings. Long life to your Lordship, says I. So next  day to it I went with a party of men a-digging a piece  of canal, and if it wasn't a hot day my name is not Pat  Lannigan. Presently I looked up and straightened my  back; says I to a comrade of mine, Mick, says I, I'm very  dry; with that, says the overseer, we don't allow gentlemen  to talk at their work in this country. Faith, I soon  found out for my two days' pay in one, I had to do two  days' work in one, and pay two weeks' board in one, and  at the end of a month, I found myself no better off in  pocket than in Nova Scotia; while the devil a bone in my  body that didn't ache with pain: and as for my nose, it  took to bleeding, and bled day and night entirely. Upon  my soul, Mr. Slick, said he, the poor labourer does not  last long in your country: what with new rum, hard labor,  and hot weather, you'll see the graves of the Irish each  side of the canals, for all the world like two rows of  potatoes in a field that have forgot to come up. It is  a land, Sir, continued the Clockmaker, of hard work. We  have two kind of slaves, the niggers and the white slaves.  All European laborers and blacks, who come out to us, do  our hard bodily work, while we direct it to a profitable  end; neither rich nor poor, high nor low, with us, eat  the bread of idleness. Our whole capital is in active  operation, and our whole population is in active  employment. An idle fellow, like Pugnose, who runs away  to us, is clapt into harness afore he knows where he is,  and is made to work; like a horse that refuses to draw,  he is put into the Team-boat; he finds some before him  and others behind him, HE MUST EITHER DRAW, or be DRAGGED  TO DEATH.          No. V    Justice Pettifog.    In the morning the Clockmaker informed me that a Justice's  Court was to be held that day at Pugnose's Inn, and he  guessed be could do a little business among the country  folks that would be assembled there. Some of them, he  said, owed him for clocks, and it would save him a world  of travelling, to have the Justice and Constable to drive  them up together. If you want a fat wether, there's  nothing like penning up the whole flock in a corner. I  guess, said he, if General Campbell knew what sort of a  man that are magistrate was, he'd disband him pretty  quick: he's a regular suck egg--a disgrace to the country.  I guess if he acted that way in Kentucky, he'd get a  breakfast of cold lead some morning, out of the small  eend of a rifle, he'd find pretty difficult to digest.  They tell me he issues three hundred writs a year, the  cost of which, including that tarnation Constable's fees,  can't amount to nothing less than 3,000 dollars per annum.  If the Hon. Daniel Webster had him afore a jury, I reckon  he'd turn him inside out, and slip him back again, as  quick as an old stocking. He'd paint him to the life, as  plain to be known as the head of Gineral Jackson. He's  jist a fit feller for Lynch law, to be tried, hanged,  and damned, all at once--there's more nor him in the  country--there's some of the breed in every county in  the Province. Jist one or two to do the dirty work, as  we keep niggers, for jobs that would give a white man  the cholera. They ought to pay his passage, as we do with  such critters, tell him his place is taken in the Mail  Coach, and if he is found here after twenty four hours,  they'd make a carpenter's plumb-bob of him, and hang him  outside the church steeple, to try if it was perpendicular.  He almost always gives judgment for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/582"],[0,"A Collection of Beatrix Potter Stories (#4)"],[1," there began to  be other sounds up above--the rasping noise of a saw; and the noise of a  little dog, scratching and yelping!    The rats dropped the rolling-pin, and listened attentively.    \"We are discovered and interrupted, Anna Maria; let us collect our  property,--and other people's,--and depart at once.\"    \"I fear that we shall be obliged to leave this pudding.\"    \"But I am persuaded that the knots would have proved indigestible,  whatever you may urge to the contrary.\"    \"Come away at once and help me to tie up some mutton bones in a  counterpane,\" said Anna Maria. \"I have got half a smoked ham hidden in  the chimney.\"    So it happened that by the time John Joiner had got the plank up--there  was nobody under the floor except the rolling-pin and Tom Kitten in a  very dirty dumpling!    But there was a strong smell of rats; and John Joiner spent the rest of  the morning sniffing and whining, and wagging his tail, and going round  and round with his head in the hole like a gimlet.    Then he nailed the plank down again, and put his tools in his bag, and  came downstairs.    The cat family had quite recovered. They invited him to stay to dinner.    The dumpling had been peeled off Tom Kitten, and made separately into a  bag pudding, with currants in it to hide the smuts.    They had been obliged to put Tom Kitten into a hot bath to get the  butter off.    John Joiner smelt the pudding; but he regretted that he had not time to  stay to dinner, because he had just finished making a wheel-barrow for  Miss Potter, and she had ordered two hen-coops.    And when I was going to the post late in the afternoon--I looked up the  lane from the corner, and I saw Mr. Samuel Whiskers and his wife on the  run, with big bundles on a little wheel-barrow, which looked very like  mine.    They were just turning in at the gate to the barn of Farmer Potatoes.    Samuel Whiskers was puffing and out of breath. Anna Maria was still  arguing in shrill tones.    She seemed to know her way, and she seemed to have a quantity of  luggage.    I am sure _I_ never gave her leave to borrow my wheel-barrow!    They went into the barn, and hauled their parcels with a bit of string  to the top of the haymow.    After that, there were no more rats for a long time at Tabitha  Twitchit's.    As for Farmer Potatoes, he has been driven nearly distracted. There are  rats, and rats, and rats in his barn! They eat up the chicken food, and  steal the oats and bran, and make holes in the meal bags.    And they are all descended from Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Whiskers--children  and grand-children and great great grand-children.    There is no end to them!    Moppet and Mittens have grown up into very good rat-catchers.    They go out rat-catching in the village, and they find plenty of  employment. They charge so much a dozen, and earn their living very  comfortably.    They hang up the rats' tails in a row or the barn door, to show how many  they have caught--dozens and dozens of them.    But Tom Kitten has always been afraid of a rat; he never durst face  anything that is bigger than--    A Mouse.    THE END          THE TALE OF MR. TOD      I HAVE made many books about well-behaved people. Now, for a change, I  am going to make a story about two disagreeable people, called Tommy  Brock and Mr. Tod. Nobody could call Mr. Tod \"nice.\" The rabbits could  not bear him; they could smell him half a mile off. He was of a  wandering habit and he had foxey whiskers; they never knew where he  would be next.    One day he was living in a stick-house in the coppice, causing terror to  the family of old Mr. Benjamin Bouncer. Next day he moved into a pollard  willow near the lake, frightening the wild ducks and the water rats.    In winter and early spring he might generally be found in an earth  amongst the rocks at the top of Bull Banks, under Oatmeal Crag.    He had half a dozen houses, but he was seldom at home.    The houses were not always empty when Mr. Tod moved OUT; because  sometimes Tommy Brock moved IN; (without asking leave).    Tommy Brock was a short bristly fat waddling person with a grin; he  grinned all over his face. He was not nice in his habits. He ate wasp  nests and frogs and worms; and he waddled about by moonlight, digging  things up.    His clothes were very dirty; and as he slept in the day-time, he always  went to bed in his boots. And the bed which he went to bed in, was  generally Mr. Tod's.    Now Tommy Brock did occasionally eat rabbit-pie; but it was only very  little young ones occasionally, when other food was really scarce. He  was friendly with old Mr. Bouncer; they agreed in disliking the wicked  otters and Mr. Tod; they often talked over that painful subject.    Old Mr. Bouncer was stricken in years. He sat in the spring sunshine  outside the burrow, in a muffler; smoking a pipe of rabbit tobacco.    He lived with his son Benjamin Bunny and his daughter-in-law Flopsy, who  had a young family. Old Mr. Bouncer was in charge of the family that  afternoon, because Benjamin and Flopsy had gone out.    The little rabbit-babies were just old enough to open their blue eyes  and kick. They lay in a fluffy bed of rabbit wool and hay, in a shallow  burrow, separate from the main rabbit hole. To tell the truth--old Mr.  Bouncer had forgotten them.    He sat in the sun, and conversed cordially with Tommy Brock, who was  passing through the wood with a sack and a little spud which he used for  digging, and some mole traps. He complained bitterly about the scarcity  of pheasants' eggs, and accused Mr. Tod of poaching them. And the otters  had cleared off all the frogs while he was asleep in winter--\"I have not  had a good square meal for a fortnight, I am living on pig-nuts. I shall  have to turn vegetarian and eat my own tail!\" said Tommy Brock.    It was not much of a joke, but it tickled old Mr. Bouncer; because Tommy  Brock was so fat and stumpy and grinning.    So old Mr. Bouncer laughed; and pressed Tommy Brock to come inside, to  taste a slice of seed-cake and \"a glass of my daughter Flopsy's cowslip  wine.\" Tommy Brock squeezed himself into the rabbit hole with alacrity.    Then old Mr. Bouncer smoked another pipe, and gave Tommy Brock a cabbage  leaf cigar which was so very strong that it made Tommy Brock grin more  than ever; and the smoke filled the burrow. Old Mr. Bouncer coughed and  laughed; and Tommy Brock puffed and grinned.    And Mr. Bouncer laughed and coughed, and shut his eyes because of the  cabbage smoke..........      When Flopsy and Benjamin came back--old Mr. Bouncer woke up. Tommy Brock  and all the young rabbit-babies had disappeared!    Mr. Bouncer would not confess that he had admitted anybody into the  rabbit hole. But the smell of badger was undeniable; and there were  round heavy footmarks in the sand. He was in disgrace; Flopsy wrung her  ears, and slapped him.    Benjamin Bunny set off at once after Tommy Brock.    There was not much difficulty in tracking him; he had left his foot-mark  and gone slowly up the winding footpath through the wood. Here he had  rooted up the moss and wood sorrel. There he had dug quite a deep hole  for dog darnel; and had set a mole trap. A little stream crossed the  way. Benjamin skipped lightly over dry-foot; the badger's heavy steps  showed plainly in the mud.    The path led to a part of the thicket where the trees had been cleared;  there were leafy oak stumps, and a sea of blue hyacinths--but the smell  that made Benjamin stop, was not the smell of flowers!    Mr. Tod's stick house was before him and, for once, Mr. Tod was at home.  There was not only a foxey flavour in proof of it--there was smoke  coming out of the broken pail that served as a chimney.    Benjamin Bunny sat up, staring; his whiskers twitched. Inside the stick  house somebody dropped a plate, and said something. Benjamin stamped his  foot, and bolted.    He never stopped till he came to the other side of the wood. Apparently  Tommy Brock had turned the same way. Upon the top of the wall, there  were again the marks of badger; and some ravellings of a sack had caught  on a briar.    Benjamin climbed over the wall, into a meadow. He found another mole  trap newly set; he was still upon the track of Tommy Brock. It was  getting late in the afternoon. Other rabbits were coming out to enjoy  the evening air. One of them in a blue coat by himself, was busily  hunting for dandelions.--\"Cousin Peter! Peter Rabbit, Peter Rabbit!\"  shouted Benjamin Bunny.    The blue coated rabbit sat up with pricked ears--    \"Whatever is the matter, Cousin Benjamin? Is it a cat? or John Stoat  Ferret?\"    \"No, no, no! He's bagged my family--Tommy Brock--in a sack--have you  seen him?\"    \"Tommy Brock? how many, Cousin Benjamin?\"    \"Seven, Cousin Peter, and all of them twins! Did he come this way?  Please tell me quick!\"    \"Yes, yes; not ten minutes since.... he said they were caterpillars; I  did think they were kicking rather hard, for caterpillars.\"    \"Which way? which way has he gone, Cousin Peter?\"    \"He had a sack with something 'live in it; I watched him set a mole  trap. Let me use my mind, Cousin Benjamin; tell me from the beginning.\"  Benjamin did so.    \"My Uncle Bouncer has displayed a lamentable want of discretion for his  years;\" said Peter reflectively, \"but there are two hopeful  circumstances. Your family is alive and kicking; and Tommy Brock has had  refreshment. He will probably go to sleep, and keep them for breakfast.\"  \"Which way?\" \"Cousin Benjamin, compose yourself. I know very well which  way. Because Mr. Tod was at home in the stick-house he has gone to Mr.  Tod's other house, at the top of Bull Banks. I partly know, because he  offered to leave any message at Sister Cottontail's; he said he would be  passing.\" (Cottontail had married a black rabbit, and gone to live on  the hill).    Peter hid his dandelions, and accompanied the afflicted parent, who was  all of a twitter. They crossed several"]]]
