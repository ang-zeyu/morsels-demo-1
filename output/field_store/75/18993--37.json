Here I lunched  comfortably, read the _Herald_ and the _Meteor_, and finally went  to the steel safe in my bedroom and set the time combination. The  three and three-quarter minutes which it is necessary to wait, while the  time lock is opening, are to me golden moments. From the instant I set  the combination to the moment when I grasp the knobs and swing back  the solid steel doors, I live in an ecstasy of expectation. Those moments  must be like moments passed in Paradise. I know what I am to find at  the end of the time limit. I know what the massive safe holds secure for  me, for me alone, and the exquisite pleasure of waiting is hardly enhanced  when the safe opens and I lift, from its velvet crown, a diadem of purest  gold, blazing with diamonds. I do this every day, and yet the joy of  waiting and at last touching again the diadem, only seems to increase as  the days pass. It is a diadem fit for a King among kings, an Emperor  among emperors. The King in Yellow might scorn it, but it shall be worn  by his royal servant.    I held it in my arms until the alarm in the safe rang harshly, and then  tenderly, proudly, I replaced it and shut the steel doors. I walked  slowly back into my study, which faces Washington Square, and leaned on  the window sill. The afternoon sun poured into my windows, and a gentle  breeze stirred the branches of the elms and maples in the park, now  covered with buds and tender foliage. A flock of pigeons circled about  the tower of the Memorial Church; sometimes alighting on the purple tiled  roof, sometimes wheeling downward to the lotos fountain in front of the  marble arch. The gardeners were busy with the flower beds around the  fountain, and the freshly turned earth smelled sweet and spicy. A lawn  mower, drawn by a fat white horse, clinked across the green sward, and  watering-carts poured showers of spray over the asphalt drives. Around  the statue of Peter Stuyvesant, which in 1897 had replaced the  monstrosity supposed to represent Garibaldi, children played in the  spring sunshine, and nurse girls wheeled elaborate baby carriages with a  reckless disregard for the pasty-faced occupants, which could probably be  explained by the presence of half a dozen trim dragoon troopers languidly  lolling on the benches. Through the trees, the Washington Memorial Arch  glistened like silver in the sunshine, and beyond, on the eastern  extremity of the square the grey stone barracks of the dragoons, and the  white granite artillery stables were alive with colour and motion.    I looked at the Lethal Chamber on the corner of the square opposite. A  few curious people still lingered about the gilded iron railing, but  inside the grounds the paths were deserted. I watched the fountains  ripple and sparkle; the sparrows had already found this new bathing nook,  and the basins were covered with the dusty-feathered little things. Two  or three white peacocks picked their way across the lawns, and a drab  coloured pigeon sat so motionless on the arm of one of the \"Fates,\" that  it seemed to be a part of the sculptured stone.    As I was turning carelessly away, a slight commotion in the group of  curious loiterers around the gates attracted my attention. A young man  had entered, and was advancing with nervous strides along the gravel path  which leads to the bronze doors of the Lethal Chamber. He paused a moment  before the \"Fates,\" and as he raised his head to those three mysterious  faces, the pigeon rose from its sculptured perch, circled about for a  moment and wheeled to the east. The young man pressed his hand to his  face, and then with an undefinable gesture sprang up the marble steps,  the bronze doors closed behind him, and half an hour later the loiterers  slouched away, and the frightened pigeon returned to its perch in the  arms of Fate.    I put on my hat and went out into the park for a little walk before  dinner. As I crossed the central driveway a group of officers passed, and  one of them called out, \"Hello, Hildred,\" and came back to shake hands  with me. It was my cousin Louis, who stood smiling and tapping his  spurred heels with his riding-whip.    \"Just back from Westchester,\" he said; \"been doing the bucolic; milk and  curds, you know, dairy-maids in sunbonnets, who say 'haeow' and 'I don't  think' when you tell them they are pretty. I'm nearly dead for a square  meal at Delmonico's. What's the news?\"    \"There is none,\" I replied pleasantly. \"I saw your regiment coming in this  morning.\"    \"Did you? I didn't see you. Where were you?\"    \"In Mr. Wilde's window.\"    \"Oh, hell!\" he began impatiently, \"that man is stark mad! I don't  understand why you--\"    He saw how annoyed I felt by this outburst, and begged my pardon.    \"Really, old chap,\" he said, \"I don't mean to run down a man you like,  but for the life of me I can't see what the deuce you find in common with  Mr. Wilde. He's not well bred, to put it generously; he is hideously  deformed; his head is the head of a criminally insane person. You know  yourself he's been in an asylum--\"    \"So have I,\" I interrupted calmly.    Louis looked startled and confused for a moment, but recovered and  slapped me heartily on the shoulder. \"You were completely cured,\" he  began; but I stopped him again.    \"I suppose you mean that I was simply acknowledged never to have been  insane.\"    \"Of course that--that's what I meant,\" he laughed.    I disliked his laugh because I knew it was forced, but I nodded gaily and  asked him where he was going. Louis looked after his brother officers who  had now almost reached Broadway.    \"We had intended to sample a Brunswick cocktail, but to tell you the  truth I was anxious for an excuse to go and see Hawberk instead. Come  along, I'll make you my excuse.\"    We found old Hawberk, neatly attired in a fresh spring suit, standing at  the door of his shop and sniffing the air.    \"I had just decided to take Constance for a little stroll before dinner,\"  he replied to the impetuous volley of questions from Louis. \"We thought  of walking on the park terrace along the North River.\"    At that moment Constance appeared and grew pale and rosy by turns as  Louis bent over her small gloved fingers. I tried to excuse myself,  alleging an engagement uptown, but Louis and Constance would not listen,  and I saw I was expected to remain and engage old Hawberk's attention.  After all it would be just as well if I kept my eye on Louis, I thought,  and when they hailed a Spring Street horse-car, I got in after them and  took my seat beside the armourer.    The beautiful line of parks and granite terraces overlooking the wharves  along the North River, which were built in 1910 and finished in the  autumn of 1917, had become one of the most popular promenades in the  metropolis. They extended from the battery to 190th Street, overlooking  the noble river and affording a fine view of the Jersey shore and the  Highlands opposite. Cafes and restaurants were scattered here and there  among the trees, and twice a week military bands from the garrison played  in the kiosques on the parapets.    We sat down in the sunshine on the bench at the foot of the equestrian  statue of General Sheridan. Constance tipped her sunshade to shield her  eyes, and she and Louis began a murmuring conversation which was  impossible to catch. Old Hawberk, leaning on his ivory headed cane,  lighted an excellent cigar, the mate to which I politely refused, and  smiled at vacancy. The sun hung low above the Staten Island woods, and  the bay was dyed with golden hues reflected from the sun-warmed sails of  the shipping in the harbour.    Brigs, schooners, yachts, clumsy ferry-boats, their decks swarming with  people, railroad transports carrying lines of brown, blue and white  freight cars, stately sound steamers, declasse tramp steamers, coasters,  dredgers, scows, and everywhere pervading the entire bay impudent little  tugs puffing and whistling officiously;--these were the craft which  churned the sunlight waters as far as the eye could reach. In calm  contrast to the hurry of sailing vessel and steamer a silent fleet of  white warships lay motionless in midstream.    Constance's merry laugh aroused me from my reverie.    \"What _are_ you staring at?\" she inquired.    \"Nothing--the fleet,\" I smiled.    Then Louis told us what the vessels were, pointing out each by its  relative position to the old Red Fort on Governor's Island.    \"That little cigar shaped thing is a torpedo boat,\" he explained; \"there  are four more lying close together. They are the _Tarpon_, the _Falcon_,  the _Sea Fox_, and the _Octopus_. The gun-boats just above are the  _Princeton_, the _Champlain_, the _Still Water_ and the _Erie_. Next to  them lie the cruisers _Faragut_ and _Los Angeles_, and above them the  battle ships _California_, and _Dakota_, and the _Washington_ which is  the flag ship. Those two squatty looking chunks of metal which are  anchored there off Castle William are the double turreted monitors  _Terrible_ and _Magnificent_; behind them lies the ram, _Osceola_.\"    Constance looked at him with deep approval in her beautiful eyes. \"What  loads of things you know for a soldier,\" she said, and we all joined in  the laugh which followed.    Presently Louis rose with a nod to us and offered his arm to Constance,  and they strolled away along the river wall. Hawberk watched them for a  moment and then turned to me.    \"Mr. Wilde was right,\" he said. \"I have found the missing tassets and  left cuissard of the 'Prince's Emblazoned,' in a vile old junk garret in  Pell Street.\"    \"998?\" I inquired, with a smile.    \"Yes.\"    \"Mr. Wilde is a very intelligent man,\" I observed.    \"I want to give him the credit of this most important discovery,\"  continued Hawberk. \"And I intend it shall"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/85"],[0,"The Beasts of Tarzan (#4)"],[1,"'s plan for immediate physical revenge upon the Russian vanished.  He thought the land before him the mainland of Africa, and he knew that  should they liberate him here he could doubtless find his way to  civilization with comparative ease.    Paulvitch took the cheque.    \"Remove your clothing,\" he said to the ape-man.  \"Here you will not  need it.\"    Tarzan demurred.    Paulvitch pointed to the armed sailors.  Then the Englishman slowly  divested himself of his clothing.    A boat was lowered, and, still heavily guarded, the ape-man was rowed  ashore.  Half an hour later the sailors had returned to the Kincaid,  and the steamer was slowly getting under way.    As Tarzan stood upon the narrow strip of beach watching the departure  of the vessel he saw a figure appear at the rail and call aloud to  attract his attention.    The ape-man had been about to read a note that one of the sailors had  handed him as the small boat that bore him to the shore was on the  point of returning to the steamer, but at the hail from the vessel's  deck he looked up.    He saw a black-bearded man who laughed at him in derision as he held  high above his head the figure of a little child.   Tarzan half started  as though to rush through the surf and strike out for the already  moving steamer; but realizing the futility of so rash an act he halted  at the water's edge.    Thus he stood, his gaze riveted upon the Kincaid until it disappeared  beyond a projecting promontory of the coast.    From the jungle at his back fierce bloodshot eyes glared from beneath  shaggy overhanging brows upon him.    Little monkeys in the tree-tops chattered and scolded, and from the  distance of the inland forest came the scream of a leopard.    But still John Clayton, Lord Greystoke, stood deaf and unseeing,  suffering the pangs of keen regret for the opportunity that he had  wasted because he had been so gullible as to place credence in a single  statement of the first lieutenant of his arch-enemy.    \"I have at least,\" he thought, \"one consolation--the knowledge that  Jane is safe in London.  Thank Heaven she, too, did not fall into the  clutches of those villains.\"    Behind him the hairy thing whose evil eyes had been watching him as a  cat watches a mouse was creeping stealthily toward him.    Where were the trained senses of the savage ape-man?    Where the acute hearing?    Where the uncanny sense of scent?          Chapter 3    Beasts at Bay      Slowly Tarzan unfolded the note the sailor had thrust into his hand,  and read it.  At first it made little impression on his sorrow-numbed  senses, but finally the full purport of the hideous plot of revenge  unfolded itself before his imagination.    \"This will explain to you\" [the note read] \"the exact nature of my  intentions relative to your offspring and to you.    \"You were born an ape.  You lived naked in the jungles--to your own we  have returned you; but your son shall rise a step above his sire.  It  is the immutable law of evolution.    \"The father was a beast, but the son shall be a man--he shall take the  next ascending step in the scale of progress.   He shall be no naked  beast of the jungle, but shall wear a loin-cloth and copper anklets,  and, perchance, a ring in his nose, for he is to be reared by men--a  tribe of savage cannibals.    \"I might have killed you, but that would have curtailed the full  measure of the punishment you have earned at my hands.    \"Dead, you could not have suffered in the knowledge of your son's  plight; but living and in a place from which you may not escape to seek  or succour your child, you shall suffer worse than death for all the  years of your life in contemplation of the horrors of your son's  existence.    \"This, then, is to be a part of your punishment for having dared to pit  yourself against    N. R.    \"P.S.--The balance of your punishment has to do with what shall  presently befall your wife--that I shall leave to your imagination.\"      As he finished reading, a slight sound behind him brought him back with  a start to the world of present realities.    Instantly his senses awoke, and he was again Tarzan of the Apes.    As he wheeled about, it was a beast at bay, vibrant with the instinct  of self-preservation, that faced a huge bull-ape that was already  charging down upon him.    The two years that had elapsed since Tarzan had come out of the savage  forest with his rescued mate had witnessed slight diminution of the  mighty powers that had made him the invincible lord of the jungle.  His  great estates in Uziri had claimed much of his time and attention, and  there he had found ample field for the practical use and retention of  his almost superhuman powers; but naked and unarmed to do battle with  the shaggy, bull-necked beast that now confronted him was a test that  the ape-man would scarce have welcomed at any period of his wild  existence.    But there was no alternative other than to meet the rage-maddened  creature with the weapons with which nature had endowed him.    Over the bull's shoulder Tarzan could see now the heads and shoulders  of perhaps a dozen more of these mighty fore-runners of primitive man.    He knew, however, that there was little chance that they would attack  him, since it is not within the reasoning powers of the anthropoid to  be able to weigh or appreciate the value of concentrated action against  an enemy--otherwise they would long since have become the dominant  creatures of their haunts, so tremendous a power of destruction lies in  their mighty thews and savage fangs.    With a low snarl the beast now hurled himself at Tarzan, but the  ape-man had found, among other things in the haunts of civilized man,  certain methods of scientific warfare that are unknown to the jungle  folk.    Whereas, a few years since, he would have met the brute rush with brute  force, he now sidestepped his antagonist's headlong charge, and as the  brute hurtled past him swung a mighty right to the pit of the ape's  stomach.    With a howl of mingled rage and anguish the great anthropoid bent  double and sank to the ground, though almost instantly he was again  struggling to his feet.    Before he could regain them, however, his white-skinned foe had wheeled  and pounced upon him, and in the act there dropped from the shoulders  of the English lord the last shred of his superficial mantle of  civilization.    Once again he was the jungle beast revelling in bloody conflict with  his kind.  Once again he was Tarzan, son of Kala the she-ape.    His strong, white teeth sank into the hairy throat of his enemy as he  sought the pulsing jugular.    Powerful fingers held the mighty fangs from his own flesh, or clenched  and beat with the power of a steam-hammer upon the snarling,  foam-flecked face of his adversary.    In a circle about them the balance of the tribe of apes stood watching  and enjoying the struggle.  They muttered low gutturals of approval as  bits of white hide or hairy bloodstained skin were torn from one  contestant or the other.  But they were silent in amazement and  expectation when they saw the mighty white ape wriggle upon the back of  their king, and, with steel muscles tensed beneath the armpits of his  antagonist, bear down mightily with his open palms upon the back of the  thick bullneck, so that the king ape could but shriek in agony and  flounder helplessly about upon the thick mat of jungle grass.    As Tarzan had overcome the huge Terkoz that time years before when he  had been about to set out upon his quest for human beings of his own  kind and colour, so now he overcame this other great ape with the same  wrestling hold upon which he had stumbled by accident during that other  combat.   The little audience of fierce anthropoids heard the creaking  of their king's neck mingling with his agonized shrieks and hideous  roaring.    Then there came a sudden crack, like the breaking of a stout limb  before the fury of the wind.  The bullet-head crumpled forward upon its  flaccid neck against the great hairy chest--the roaring and the  shrieking ceased.    The little pig-eyes of the onlookers wandered from the still form of  their leader to that of the white ape that was rising to its feet  beside the vanquished, then back to their king as though in wonder that  he did not arise and slay this presumptuous stranger.    They saw the new-comer place a foot upon the neck of the quiet figure  at his feet and, throwing back his head, give vent to the wild, uncanny  challenge of the bull-ape that has made a kill.  Then they knew that  their king was dead.    Across the jungle rolled the horrid notes of the victory cry.  The  little monkeys in the tree-tops ceased their chattering.   The  harsh-voiced, brilliant-plumed birds were still.  From afar came the  answering wail of a leopard and the deep roar of a lion.    It was the old Tarzan who turned questioning eyes upon the little knot  of apes before him.  It was the old Tarzan who shook his head as though  to toss back a heavy mane that had fallen before his face--an old habit  dating from the days that his great shock of thick, black hair had  fallen about his shoulders, and often tumbled before his eyes when it  had meant life or death to him to have his vision unobstructed.    The ape-man knew that he might expect an immediate attack on the part  of that particular surviving bull-ape who felt himself best fitted to  contend for the kingship of the tribe.   Among his own apes he knew  that it was not unusual for an entire stranger to enter a community  and, after having dispatched the king, assume the leadership of the  tribe himself, together with the fallen monarch's mates.    On the other hand, if he made no attempt to follow them, they might  move slowly away from him, later to fight among themselves for the  supremacy.  That he could be king of them, if he so chose, he was  confident; but he was not sure he cared to assume the sometimes irksome  duties"]]]
