CHAPTER III    TREATMENT      Preventive Treatment.--The subject of preventive medicine becomes more  important as our knowledge of the cause of disease advances. A knowledge of  feeds, methods of feeding, care, sanitation and the use of such biological  products as bacterins, vaccines and protective serums is of the greatest  importance to the farmer and veterinarian. We are beginning to realize that  one of the most important secrets of profitable and successful stock  raising is the prevention of disease; that the agricultural colleges are  doing a great work in helping to teach farmers that there are right and  wrong methods of feeding and caring for animals; that the practice of  sanitation in caring for animals is the cheapest method of treating  disease; and that it is advisable to practise radical methods of control,  when necessary, in order to rid the herd of an infectious disease.    _The ration fed_ and the method of feeding are not only important in  considering the causes of diseases of the digestive tract, but diseases of  other organs as well. The feeding of an excessive, or insufficient quantity  of feed, or a ration that is too concentrated, bulky and innutritious, poor  in quality, or spoiled may produce disease.    _An impure water supply_ is a common cause of disease. A deep well that is  closed in properly and does not permit of contamination from filth, does  not insure a clean water supply if the trough or tank is not kept clean.    _Farm Buildings_.--If stockmen would make a more careful study of the kind  of farm buildings most suitable to their needs, the selection of the  location, the proportions, the arrangement of the interior and the lighting  and ventilation, there would be a great saving in losses from disease, and  the cost of building in many cases would be lessened. Your neighbor's  building that you have taken for your model may not be suitable for your  needs. It may be more expensive than your financial condition permits. It  may be poorly lighted and ventilated and not suited to the site that you  have selected.    _Biological Products_.--There are a number of biological products that may  be used in the prevention and control of disease. Some of these products,  such as tuberculin and malein, enable the owner to rid his herds of  tubercular cows and glandered horses before these diseases have become far  enough advanced to be recognized by the visible symptoms alone. Black leg,  anthrax and hog-cholera vaccines are valuable agents in the control of  disease. In the treatment of fistula and infectious abortion, bacterins may  be used. There are many other germ diseases and infections for which  vaccines and bacterins may be used. However, we must not depend wholly on  these agents in the control of disease. We must possess a knowledge of the  manner in which the infection is spread, for without this knowledge we  would be unable to prevent its dissemination over a wide area.    Medicinal Treatment.--The average stockman or veterinarian is more familiar  with the treatment of disease with drugs than he is with the preventive  measures just described. This statement does not imply that a knowledge of  medicinal therapeutics is not of the greatest importance in the treatment  of disease. The ultimate object of all drugs is both to prevent and cure  disease, but the injudicious use of a drug does neither. A discussion of  this subject cannot be entered into here, and because of its largeness it  is not advisable to discuss it further than a brief summary of the methods  of administering drugs.    Administration of Drugs.--Drugs may be administered by the following  channels: by way of the mouth, in the feed or as a drench; by injecting  into the tissues beneath the skin or hypodermically; by rubbing into the  skin; by the air passages and the lungs; and by injecting into the rectum.    If the animal is not too sick to eat and the drug does not possess an  unpleasant taste, it may be given with the feed. If soluble, it may be  given with the drinking water, or in any case, it may be mixed with ground  feed if this method is to be preferred. In all cases the medicine must be  well mixed with the feed. This is especially important if there are a  number of animals to be treated, as there is more certainty of each animal  getting the proper dose and the danger of overdosing is avoided. If the  young animal is nursing the mother, we can take advantage of certain drugs  being eliminated in the mother's milk and administer the drug to the  mother.    [Illustration: FIG. 6.--A good kind of a dose syringe.]    DRENCHES.--In the larger animals a bulky drench is sometimes difficult to  administer, and we should, in all cases, count on a portion being wasted.    _Horses_ are sometimes difficult to drench, and it may be advisable to  confine the horse in some way. Small drenches can readily be given with a  syringe (Fig. 6) or a small bottle. In giving bulky drenches it is most  convenient to use a long-necked, heavy glass bottle. The horse should be  backed into a narrow stall and the head elevated by placing a loop in the  end of a small rope over the upper jaw, passing the rope back of the nose  piece on the halter and throwing it over a beam, and raising the head until  the mouth is slightly higher than the throat. If the horse refuses to  swallow, a tablespoonful of clean water may be dropped into the nostril.  This forces it to swallow. A drench should never be given through the nose,  as it may pass into the air passages and cause a fatal inflammation of the  lungs.    _Cattle_ can be easily drenched by taking hold of the nostrils with the  fingers, or snapping a bull ring into the partition between the nostrils  and elevating the head.    _Sheep_ may be drenched either in the standing position, or when thrown on  the haunches and held between the knees. Care should be exercised in giving  irritating drenches to sheep, especially if the drench be bulky.    _A herd of hogs_ may be quickly and easily drenched if they are confined in  a small pen, and the loop of a small rope placed around the snout, well  back toward the corners of the mouth. A small metal dose syringe should be  used. If the drench is bulky and the hog difficult to hold, it may be  necessary to elevate the head and raise the forefeet from the ground. The  drench should not be given until the hog is quiet and well under control,  as there is some danger of the medicine passing into the air passages and  doing harm. It may be necessary to mark the hogs that have been drenched  with a daub of paint, or in some other manner in order to be able to  distinguish them from the untreated animals.    The administration of drugs enclosed in a gelatin capsule, or mixing them  with syrup, honey or linseed oil, and rolling the mass into the form of a  cylinder is commonly practised. The _capsule_ or _ball_ may then be shot  into the pharynx with a balling gun. A ball may also be given to the larger  animals by carrying it into the back part of the mouth with the hand, and  placing it on the back part of the tongue. In the horse this method of  administration requires some practice. The tongue must be pulled well  forward, the head held up, and the tongue released as soon as the ball is  placed on the tongue, so that it may pass back into the pharynx.    The administration of drugs by _injecting beneath the skin_ (Fig. 7) is  suitable when the drug is non-irritating and the dose is small. Drugs  administered in this way act promptly and energetically. The alkaloid or  active principle of the drug is commonly used. A fold of the skin is picked  up with the fingers and the needle is quickly introduced, care being taken  not to prick or scratch the muscular tissue, as this causes some pain and  makes the animal restless. In order to avoid abscess formation at the point  of injection, the skin should be cleansed with a disinfectant and the  syringe and needle sterilized before using.    [Illustration: FIG. 7.--Hypodermic syringes.]    Drugs are not absorbed through the unbroken skin, but when applied with  friction, or when the outer layer is removed by blistering, absorption may  take place. Liniments, blisters and _poultices_ are the preparations used.    _Volatile drugs_, such as chloroform and ether, are absorbed quickly by the  enormous vascular surface of the lungs. This class of drugs is administered  for the purpose of producing general anaesthesia. _Anaesthetics_ are  indispensable in many surgical operations.    The administration of a drug in the form of _medicated steam_ is quite  useful in combating some respiratory diseases. In steaming large animals a  pail about half full of boiling-hot water to which has been added about an  ounce of coal-tar disinfectant, or whatever drug is required, is held  within about one foot of the animal's nostrils. It is usually advisable to  throw a light cover over the head and pail in order to direct the steam  toward the nostrils. Dogs can be placed on a cane-seated chair and a pail  or pan of boiling-hot water placed under it, and a sheet thrown over all.    Drugs are administered by way of the rectum when the animal can not be  drenched, or the drug can not be given in any other way and when a local  action is desired. An _enema_ or _clyster_ is a fluid injection into the  rectum and is employed for the following purposes: to accelerate the action  of a purgative; to stimulate the peristaltic movement of the intestines; to  kill intestinal parasites; to reduce body temperature; to administer  medicine; and to supply the animal with food. An enema may be administered  by allowing water to gravitate into the rectum from a height of two or  three feet or by using an injection pump. In the larger animals several  feet of heavy walled rubber tubing carrying a straight nozzle at one end  should be used.

The habitable countries of the world total 50,670,837 sq. mi. We are  making a generous estimate, when we suppose the garden of Eden to have  been 100 mi. wide and 125 mi. long,--12,500 sq. mi. There are 4005  such areas in the habitable globe. It is located in Mesopotamia on the  Tigris and Euphrates rivers.    Maps of ancient nations show that mankind radiated from this  centre. The great nations of antiquity were clustered about it. The  beginning of the race after the flood was in the same general  locality.    Ridpath in his great history of the world, graphically shows the  migrations of races and nations. With this, even evolutionists  agree. They draw a line \"according to Giddings,\" running through  western Asia, in the region of the garden of Eden. Since there are  4005 such areas in the habitable globe, Moses had only one chance out  of 4005 to guess the spot, if he had not been inspired of God.  Anyone  guessing, might have located the origin of man in any of the countries  of Europe, Asia or Africa. This clearly demonstrates that God revealed  the truth to Moses, and that the story of creation is true and of  evolution false.    If evolution were true, there must have been, 6,000 years ago, many  heads to the race, in many places. It is incredible that there would  be but one spot where brutes became humans. There would be an  innumerable host of anthropoid brutes, in many parts of the world, in  all gradations. Who can believe that one species or one pair forged  ahead so far as to become human?        5. CIVILIZATIONS      The early civilization of man points to his creation, not his  evolution. Evolution requires many centers of civilization; creation,  only one. Of course, if man is descended from an ancient ape-like  form, and from the Primates and their brute progeny, he must have been  as uncivilized and brutish as any baboon or gorilla today, or the  apes, which, last year, horribly mangled the children at Sierra Leone.  He must have worked his way up into civilization. The records, as far  back as they go, prove that the original condition of man was a state  of civilization, not savagery.  Man fell down, not up.    The recent explorations in the tomb of Tutankhamen, in Egypt, and the  more recent explorations of the tomb of a still more ancient Egyptian  monarch, show that a high degree of civilization prevailed from 2000  to 1300 B.C.  The art displayed in the carvings and paintings, and the  skill of the artisans are beyond praise. They had knowledge even of  what are now lost arts. They had a written language 300 years before  Homer wrote his immortal Iliad. Yet many higher critics claim that  writing was unknown in the days of Moses and Homer. They declare that  the Iliad, a poem in 24 books, was committed to memory, and handed  down from generation to generation, 400 years with all its fine poetic  touches. Monstrous alternative!  Indeed we are even told that \"Many  men must have served as authors and improvers.\" The mob of reciters  improved the great epic of Homer! Scarcely less brilliant is the  suggestion of another higher critic that, \"Homer's Iliad was not  composed by Homer, but by another man of the same name\"!    The laws of Hammurabi, who is identified as the Amraphel of Scripture,  Gen. 14:1, and who was contemporary with Abraham, were in existence  many hundred years before Moses, and showed a high state of  civilization, which began many hundred years before Abraham.  The  literature of China goes back to 2000 B. C. The earliest civilization  of China, Egypt, Assyria, and Babylonia, reaching to 2500 B.C., or  earlier, points to a still earlier civilization, which likely reaches  back to the origin of the human race.    It is admitted that the earliest (Sumerian) civilization began on the  Euphrates, near the garden of Eden. They had temples and priests, and,  therefore, religion prevailed as well as civilization. The first great  empires clustered around the places where Adam and Noah lived. No  other civilization recorded in any quarter reaches farther back.    We quote from the New International Encyclopedia: \"The Sumerian  language is probably the oldest known language in the world. From the  Sumerian vocabulary, it is evident that the people who spoke this  language had reached a comparatively high civilization.\"    The monuments show that in early historical times, man was in a state  of civilization. There are no monuments of man's civilization prior to  historical time.    Higher critics have said that Moses could not have written the  Pentateuch because writing was unknown in his day. Yet Prof. A. H.  Sayce, D.D., LL.D., of Oxford University, one of the greatest  archaeologists the world ever knew, writes: \"Egypt was the first to  deliver up its dead. Under an almost rainless sky, where frost is  unknown, and the sand seals up all that is entrusted to its keeping,  nothing perishes except by the hand of man. The fragile papyrus,  inscribed it may be 5,000 years ago, is as fresh and legible as when  its first possessor died.    \"In Egypt, as far back as the monuments carry us, we find a  highly-developed art, a highly organized government, and a  highly-educated people. Books were multiplied, and if we can trust the  translation of the Proverbs of Ptah-hotep, the oldest existing book in  the world, there were competitive examinations, [civil service!]  already in the age of the sixth Egyptian Dynasty.... We have long  known that the use of writing for literary purposes is immensely old  in both Egypt and Babylonia. Egypt was emphatically a land of scribes  and readers. Already in the days of the Old Empire, the Egyptian  hieroglyphs had developed into a cursive hand.\"    From the Tel el-Amarna tablets, discovered in Upper Egypt, we know  that for 100 years people were corresponding with each other, in the  language of Babylonia in cuneiform characters. Libraries existed then,  and \"Canaan in the Mosaic age, was fully as literary as was Europe in  the time of the Renaissance.\" Ancient Babylonian monuments testify to  the existence of an ancient literary culture. The results of the  excavations by the American Expedition, published by Prof. Hilprecht,  of the U. of Pa., show that in the time of King Sargon of Accad, art  and literature flourished in Chaldea. The region of the garden of Eden  was the pivot of the civilization of the world. From this region  radiated the early civilization of Babylonia, Assyria and Egypt. And  the advanced degree implies centuries of prior civilization. The  origin of man and the earliest civilization occurred in the same  region. Ur explorations (1927) show high art, 3000 B.C.    The earliest records show man was civilized. He lived in houses,  cities and towns, read and wrote, and engaged in commerce and  industry. To be sure, he did not have the inventions of modern  times. If all these were necessary, then there was no civilization  prior to the 20th century.  Prof. J. Arthur Thompson, of Aberdeen, an  evolutionist, says: \"Modern research is leading us away from the  picture of primitive man as brutish, dull, lascivious and  bellicose. There is more justification for regarding primitive man as  clever, kindly, adventurous and inventive.\"    It is admitted that cannibalism was not primeval. The two great  revolting crimes of barbarism, cannibalism and human sacrifices, only  prevailed when man had fallen to the lowest depths, not when he had  risen out of savagery to the heights. The assertion that man was  originally a brute, savage and uncivilized is pure fiction,  unsupported by the facts. The original civilization of mankind  supports the Bible, and upsets evolution.        6. THE MENDELIAN INHERITANCE LAW      The unity of the human race is further established by Mendel's  Inheritance Discovery on which evolutionists so much rely. G. Mendel,  an experimenter, found that when he crossed a giant variety of peas  with a dwarf variety, the off-spring were all tall. The giants were  called \"dominant\"; the disappearing dwarfs, \"recessive\". But among the  second generation of this giant offspring, giants and dwarfs appeared  in the proportion of 3 to 1. But when these dwarfs were  self-fertilized, successive generations were _all_ dwarfs. The  recessive character was not lost, but appeared again. Experiments with  flowers likewise show that the recessive color will reappear.    Also experiments with the interbreeding of animals have shown similar  results. The recessive or disappearing characteristics, or the  disappearing variety, will appear again, in some subsequent  generation, and sometimes becomes permanent. This law prevails widely  in nature, and the recessive traits appear with the dominant  traits. \"If rose-combed fowl were mated with single-combed fowl, the  offspring were all rose-combed, but when these rose-combed fowl were  mated, the offspring were again rose-combed and single-combed.... If  gray rabbits were mated with black rabbits, their hybrids were all  gray, the black seemingly disappearing, but when the second generation  were mated, the progeny were again grays and blacks.\"--God or  Gorilla--p. 278. _The recessive character always reappears._    Apply these widely prevalent laws to dominant man and his recessive  alleged brute ancestor. The simian characteristics would appear in  some generations, if not in many. We would expect many offspring _to  have the recessive character of the ape_, and we ought not to be  surprised, if some recessive stock became permanent.    Following analogy, we ought to look for a tribe of human beings that  had degenerated into apes. That we find no such recessive  characteristics even among the most degenerate savages, and no such  ape-like tribe of human beings, is a decisive proof that man never  descended from the brute. Else such recessive characteristics,  according to the Mendelian Law, would be sure to appear. We would also  find monkeys and apes,--the recessive"]]]
