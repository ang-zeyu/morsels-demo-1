But they treated a  laborer as a machine; not as a human being, possessed of feelings  and sympathies in common with his species. _Work_! WORK!  _WORK_! you are hired to work. A man that paid for his work  should never be weary, faint, or sick; or expect a kind look or  word. He agrees to work; we agree to pay him; that is sufficient.  He needs no kindness, no affection, no smiles, no encouragement of  any kind. Such was their spirit towards me during this eight months  of toil. I was glad when the time expired; I felt like one released  from prison. I took my wages, and was accompanied by my father to  our place in Oswego. Here I paid all my hard earnings to meet the  yearly installment due on the land--reserving merely enough to  purchase two axes. We then commenced to chop and clear the heavy  timber all the time that we could command, extra of earning our  board. It was a cold, snowy winter, such as is usual in the  northern part of New York. But we earned our living, and chopped  and cleared ten acres during the winter and spring; this we  surrounded with a fence of rails, and planted with wheat and Indian  corn, being in hopes to meet the next payment with the avails of  our harvest.      CHAPTER II.  ------------------------    Thoughts on Religion:--Join the Baptist  Church:--Strange Perversion of a Scripture Promise.    It was during these toils in the wilderness that my mind was  drawn out from time to time on the things of God and eternity. I  felt deeply anxious to be saved from my sins, and to secure an  interest in that world \"where the wicked cease from troubling, and  the weary are at rest.\" I attended public worship with a society of  Baptists who had employed one W. A. Scranton for their minister; he  was a scholar from Hamilton Seminary (an institution where young  men are educated for the ministry).    I said to my father one day while we were laboring together in  the forest: \"Father, how is it there is so manifest a difference  between the ancient and modern disciples of Jesus Christ and their  doctrines? If, for instance, I had lived in the days of the  Apostles, and believed in Jesus Christ, and had manifested a wish  to become his disciple, Peter or his brethren would have said to  me, '_Repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for_   REMISSION OF SINS, _and you_ SHALL _receive the gift of  the Holy Ghost_.' I should then have known definitely and  precisely what to do to be saved. Whereas, _now_ we go to  the religious minister for instruction, and he tells us we must  experience a mysterious, indefinite and undefinable something  called religion before we can repent and be baptized acceptably.  But, if we inquire how, or by what means we are to come at this  experience, he cannot tell us definitely; but will tell us that it  is the work of God in the soul; which he will accomplish in his own  due time, for his own elect; and that we can do nothing acceptably  till this is done. That even our prayers and repentance, and all  our good works are sin; so long as this work of God is not done  within us.    \"Now, father,\" said I, \"how is this? I believe in Jesus; I wish  to serve him and keep his commandments; I love him: He has  commanded all men to repent and be baptized, and has promised to  remit the sins of all those who obey the gospel ordinances, and to  pour out the Holy Spirit upon them. Yet, if I apply to the  Presbyterians they will sprinkle some water in my face instead of  baptizing me. If I go to the Methodists it is the same. And if I go  to the Baptists they will not baptize me for _remission of sins  _, that I may receive the gift of the Holy Ghost; but they will  require of me to relate _an experience_, and to tell of some  time and place where I had already experienced that which I am only  seeking for, and have not found. This, of course, I cannot do; and,  therefore, they will not receive me unto baptism. How, then, can I  observe the ordinances of God and keep his commandments?\"    To these inquiries my father could give no satisfactory answer;  but observed that times and circumstances had changed. With this I  was not satisfied, of course; for who had a right to change the  ordinances, transgress the law, or break the covenant of the  everlasting gospel? Such were my thoughts.    I still continued to ponder upon these things, and to search the  Scriptures to learn how to be saved. I found the same principles  and practice throughout the history of the Apostles, the Jews,  Samaritans, Gentiles, Ephesians, Corinthians, Romans, the Ethiopian  eunuch, Saul of Tarsus, the jailer and his household, all were  baptized when they believed in Jesus Christ and repented of their  sins; and this as an ordinance connected with remission of their  sins and the gift of the Holy Ghost. What, then, should I do? Where  find one who was commissioned from heaven, and would administer  salvation to me? I could only go to the Baptists; but I lacked that  \"_experience of religion_\" which they always required. However,  I resolved to try.    I accordingly appeared before them at their monthly meeting, or  council, and requested to be baptized; they inquired into my  experience; I related to them my firm belief in Christ, and my wish  to serve God without being able to tell them of any particular  experience of religion. They finally consulted together; and came  to the conclusion that I had been converted, whether I knew it  myself or not, and a time was appointed for my baptism--a month or  two thence. Here I again realized the difference. In ancient times  persons were baptized immediately on profession of their faith; now  they were subjected to a delay of weeks or months.    At length the time arrived, and I was baptized by Mr. Scranton,  and duly initiated into the Baptist society; being about eighteen  years of age. I felt some satisfaction in obeying this one  ordinance; but still I was aware that all was not right,--that much  was wanting to constitute a Christian, or a Church of Christ.    I endeavored to pray much, and to attend meetings strictly; I  also endeavored to keep the commandments of Jesus as well as I  could.    Mr. Scranton came to the house where I boarded to preach at a  certain time, and I inquired of him what Jesus meant when he said,  \"these signs shall follow them that believe.\" He replied, that it  meant these signs should follow the Apostles only.    This did not satisfy me; for it was plain and manifest  perversion of common sense and language easy to be understood. It  was as much as to say: Go ye into all the world and preach the  gospel to the Apostles; and the Apostles that believe and are  baptized shall be saved; and the Apostles that believe not shall be  damned; and these signs shall follow the Apostles that believe.  Thus, by logical consistency, confining the whole commission and  gospel to the Apostles, with all its benefits, by the same rule  that we would confine the promise of the signs following to them.      CHAPTER III.  ------------------------    Reverses:--Loss of our Farm:--Strange  Resolve:--Travels West:--Forest Life:--Another New Farm.    Time passed; harvest came; a fine crop, but no market; and  consequently the payment came due on our land and there was no  means of payment.    The winter rolled round; spring came again; and with it a  prosecution on the part of Mr. Morgan for money due on land. The  consequence was that all our hard earnings, and all our  improvements in the wilderness, were wrested from us in a moment.  Mr. Morgan retained the land, the improvements and the money paid.    Weary and disconsolate, I left the country and my father, who  took charge of our crops and all unsettled business.    I spent a few months with my uncles, Ira and Allen Pratt, in  Wayne County, N. Y., and in the autumn of 1826 I resolved to bid  farewell to the civilized world--where I had met with little else  but disappointment, sorrow and unrewarded toil; and where sectarian  divisions disgusted and ignorance perplexed me--and to spend the  remainder of my days in the solitudes of the great West, among the  natives of the forest.    There, at least, thought I, there will be no buying and selling  of lands,--no law to sweep all the hard earnings of years to pay a  small debt,--no wranglings about sects, and creeds, and doctrines.  I will win the confidence of the red man; I will learn his  language; I will tell him of Jesus; I will read to him the  Scriptures; I will teach him the arts of peace; to hate war, to  love his neighbor, to fear and love God, and to cultivate the  earth. Such were my resolutions.    In October, 1826, I took leave of my friends and started  westward. I paid most of my money in Rochester for a small pocket  Bible, and continued my journey as far as Buffalo. At this place I  engaged a passage for Detroit, on board a steamer; as I had no  money, I agreed to work for the same.    After a rough passage and many delays, I was at length driven by  stress of weather to land at Erie, in Pennsylvania; from whence I  travelled by land till I came to a small settlement about thirty  miles west of Cleveland, in the State of Ohio. The rainy season of  November had now set in; the country was covered with a dense  forest, with here and there a small opening made by the settlers,  and the surface of the earth one vast scene of mud and mire; so  that travelling was now very difficult, if not impracticable.    Alone in a land of strangers, without home or money, and not yet  twenty years of age, I became discouraged, and concluded to stop  for the winter; I procured a gun from one of the neighbors; worked  and earned an axe, some breadstuff and other little extras, and  retired two miles into a dense forest and prepared a small hut, or  cabin, for the winter. Some leaves and straw in my cabin served for  my lodging, and a good fire kept me warm. A stream near my door  quenched my thirst; and fat venison, with a little"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/449"],[0,"Pathology of Lying, Accusation, and Swindling: A Study in Forensic Psychology (#4)"],[1,"saw her.  Her peculiar method was to  approach strangers, claiming to be a relative coming from another  city to visit.  If cordially received she would stay as long as  her welcome lasted, then depart taking with her any of their  possessions her fancy chose.  Many prominent physicians examined  her and were unable to decide as to her responsibility; judges  and others said she was a willful deceiver, a refined swindler.  Delbruck, looking deeper, found that she was suffering from  hysteria, having hystero-epileptic seizures with following  delirium, or rather twilight states.  Though her delinquencies  seemed to show cunning and skill, a careful investigation  revealed the fact that this was merely aberrant.  Generally her  thieving was undertaken in feebleminded fashion; many times she  stole things worthless to herself.  Evidences of her pathological  mentality were that she would give orders for groceries, would  buy children's clothes, or send for a physician under an assumed  name.  She might not go back for the groceries, but after  ordering them would say she would return with the carriage.  The  characteristic fact throughout her career was that she wished to  appear to be some one wealthier, more influential than she was.  Delbruck classifies her as high-grade feebleminded, suffering  from convulsive attacks and peculiar states of consciousness,  with a morbid tendency to lying.  She possessed no power to  realize the culpable nature of her acts when she was performing  them.    His third patient as a boy appeared normal both mentally and  physically.  In his youth he went through the gymnasium and then  studied theology.  He spent money very freely on clothing and  books, but at this period neither stole nor lied.  After  finishing his theological studies, he preached in his home town  and was regarded as a young man of great promise.  Then came a  change; he began to write strange letters, telling of some  positions offered him, he borrowed money freely from relatives  and friends who were willing to give because they believed in his  coming career.  When studied, it was concluded by Delbruck that  this was a case of constitutional psychosis, hysteria, moral  insanity, and psychopathy--all of these forms being interrelated.  Outside of masturbation, begun in early childhood and indulged in  excessively at times, no causal factors were discovered.  He  considered that this case offered a good illustration of the  peculiar coexistence of real lies and delusions in the same  individual.    His fourth case was that of an artful, deceitful, arrogant,  selfish boy, always clever in excuses, who had stolen from the  age of twelve, often stolen things that he threw away.  Though of  Protestant family, he delighted to draw Catholic insignia and  embroider religious characters.  He finally entered the  university, always lying and stealing.  At the end of three  months he was taken home in debt 2000 marks.  He later became a  Catholic.  Outside of normal expense he had cost his father  28,000 marks.  By the time he was studied he had already taken  opium for four years, having started because of neuralgia.  There  had been a severe operation on account of some trouble with the  teeth.  It was discovered that there was contrary sexual feeling  in this case also.  The patient had a great inclination for doing  woman's handwork.  Delbruck again considered the early appearance  of character anomalies and perverted sex feeling to prove a  deep-seated abnormality of nervous constitution.  He diagnosed it  as a case of constitutional psychosis; the extent of the  abnormalities showing the individual to be irresponsible.    His last patient was an alcoholic adventurer, early life unknown,  who had an idiotic sister.  He had lived long in America and  returned to Germany full of stories of his wonderful achievements  over seas.  This case does not concern us except to emphasize the  influence of alcohol in the development of such cases.    This outline is sufficient to show the justification of his  conclusion, namely, that just as in healthy people a mixing of  lies and mistakes may occur, so the same combination may reach a  pathological height, and one can diagnose a mixture of lies with  delusions or false memories.    These studies focus our attention on the following points which  are valuable to emphasize for the purpose of this monograph: the  complexity of details to be examined in the life of any one  patient in whose delinquencies pathological lying is a factor,  the variety of cases in which this factor may occur, hence the  difficulties in the way of determining the extent to which the  patient is responsible for his deeds and whether he belongs in a  reformatory or an insane hospital.  From the standpoint of  society Delbruck's work has great use, since it reveals so  plainly the menace that these liars are to their families and to  the community as a whole, their unscrupulousness in financial  dealings, their tendencies to bring false accusations involving  families and friends alike in useless expense and litigation.    German studies on pseudologia phantastica since Delbruck's time  have followed the line of amplification of his views and  clarification of the subject by the addition of new types.    Koppen[9] attempted to differentiate sharply and to analyze more  accurately the conception of the pathological lie.  He found it  impossible to make an absolute separation between pathological  lies and normal lies.  The lies of the mentally diseased are  seldom pathological.  They lie, but their lies do not differ from  those of the mentally sound.  We cannot call the results  delusional lies.  Among imbeciles we find a peculiar disposition  to lying, especially among those of criminal inclination.  Their  lies do not separate themselves either in content or in relation  to the rest of their ideas from the lies of the mentally  diseased.  Here follows his positive contribution to the  conception; the pathological lie is active in character, a whole  sequence of experiences is fabricated and the products of fancy  brought forward with a certainty that is astonishing.  The  possibility that the untruth may be at any minute demolished does  not abash the liar in the least.  Remonstrances against the lies  make no impression.  On closer inspection we find that the liar  is no longer free, he has ceased to be master of his own lies,  the lie has won power over him, it has the worth of a real  experience.  In the final stage of the evolution of the  pathological lie, it cannot be differentiated from delusion.  Pathological lies have long been credited to hystericals, they  are now known to arise in alcoholics, imbeciles, degenerates.  All pathological liars have a purpose, i.e., to decorate their  own person, to tell something interesting, and an ego motive is  always present.  They all lie about something they wish to  possess or be.      [9] ``Ueber die pathologische Lugner,'' Charite-Annalen, 8, 1898.  Pp. 674-719.          Koppen offers three case studies:  I.  A man who had suffered  from many epileptic seizures came from a family in which there  was insanity.  He gave himself many false titles, and from his  childhood pathological lying had been a prominent symptom.  As an  example, when he married against his father's will, he at the  wedding read a false dispatch, pretending it to be  congratulations from his family.  Koppen suggests that this  individual was incapable of meeting life as it really was and he  therefore wove a mass of phantasies.  II.  A young man charged  with grave falsifications.  He had come from an epileptic family  and himself had slight attacks in childhood.  He bore various  pathological stigmata.  Koppen considered that the patient  believed his own stories about his rather superior education and  that in general his lies became delusions which influenced his  actions.  He diagnosed the case as psychotic; insane in a legal  sense.  III.  A young man undoubtedly insane brought forward his  pathological lies with such force that Koppen was persuaded that  the patient believed in them.    Bernard Risch[10] has seen many cases of delinquents with more or  less marked psychopathic signs in which pathological lying was  the focal point.  He reports five cases at great length, in all  of whom the inclination to fabricate stories, ``der Hang zum  fabulieren,'' is irresistible and apparently not to be repressed  by efforts of the will.  Risch's main points, built up from study  of his cases, are worthy of close consideration:  1. Mental  processes similar to those forming the basis of the impulse to  literary creation in normal people lie at the foundation of the  morbid romances and fancies of those afflicted with pseudologia  phantastica.  The coercive impulse for self-expression, with an  accompanying feeling of desire and dissatisfaction, plays a  similar part in both.  That the making up of tales is an end in  itself for the abnormal swindler, just as it is for the normal  author, seems clear to Risch.  2. The morbid impulse which forces  ``zum fabulieren'' is bound up with the desire to play the role  of the person depicted.  Fiction and real life are not separated  as in the mind of the normal author.  3. The bent of thought is  egocentric, the morbid liar and swindler can think of nothing but  himself.  4. There is a reduction of the powers of attention in  these cases; only upon supposition that this faculty is disturbed  can we account for the discrepancies in the statements of  patients.  One has the impression that their memory for their  delinquencies is not clear.  Careful investigation proves that  they do not like to remember them and this dislike has to be  overcome.  5. There is a special weakness in judgment, which for  general purposes is sound.  The train of thought is logical, but  in ethical discernment the lack appears.  The pathological liar  does not"]]]
