   01:008:011 And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her             mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the             waters were abated from off the earth.    01:008:012 And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove;             which returned not again unto him any more.    01:008:013 And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in             the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were             dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of             the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was             dry.    01:008:014 And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the             month, was the earth dried.    01:008:015 And God spake unto Noah, saying,    01:008:016 Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy             sons' wives with thee.    01:008:017 Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of             all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping             thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed             abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon             the earth.    01:008:018 And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons'             wives with him:    01:008:019 Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and             whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went             forth out of the ark.    01:008:020 And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every             clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt             offerings on the altar.    01:008:021 And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his             heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's             sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his             youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living,             as I have done.    01:008:022 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and             heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not             cease.    01:009:001 And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be             fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.    01:009:002 And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every             beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all             that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the             sea; into your hand are they delivered.    01:009:003 Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as             the green herb have I given you all things.    01:009:004 But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof,             shall ye not eat.    01:009:005 And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the             hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man;             at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of             man.    01:009:006 Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed:             for in the image of God made he man.    01:009:007 And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly             in the earth, and multiply therein.    01:009:008 And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,    01:009:009 And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your             seed after you;    01:009:010 And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl,             of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from             all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.    01:009:011 And I will establish my covenant with you, neither shall all             flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither             shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.    01:009:012 And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make             between me and you and every living creature that is with you,             for perpetual generations:    01:009:013 I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a             covenant between me and the earth.    01:009:014 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the             earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:    01:009:015 And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you             and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall             no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.    01:009:016 And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it,             that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and             every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.    01:009:017 And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant,             which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon             the earth.    01:009:018 And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem,             and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.    01:009:019 These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole             earth overspread.    01:009:020 And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:    01:009:021 And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was             uncovered within his tent.    01:009:022 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his             father, and told his two brethren without.    01:009:023 And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both             their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness             of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw             not their father's nakedness.    01:009:024 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son             had done unto him.    01:009:025 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he             be unto his brethren.    01:009:026 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall             be his servant.    01:009:027 God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of             Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.    01:009:028 And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.    01:009:029 And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years:             and he died.    01:010:001 Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham,             and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.    01:010:002 The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan,             and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.    01:010:003 And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.    01:010:004 And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and             Dodanim.    01:010:005 By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their             lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in             their nations.    01:010:006 And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.    01:010:007 And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and             Raamah, and Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and             Dedan.    01:010:008 And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the             earth.    01:010:009 He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said,             Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.    01:010:010 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and             Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.    01:010:011 Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and             the city Rehoboth, and Calah,    01:010:012 And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city.    01:010:013 And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and             Naphtuhim,    01:010:014 And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and             Caphtorim.    01:010:015 And Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth,    01:010:016 And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,    01:010:017 And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,    01:010:018 And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and             afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.    01:010:019 And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou             comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and             Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.    01:010:020 These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their             tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.    01:010:021 Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the             brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.    01:010:022 The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud,             and Aram.    01:010:023 And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.    01:010:024 And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.    01:010:025 And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg;             for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name             was Joktan.    01:010:026 And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and             Jerah,    01:010:027 And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,    01:010:028 And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,    01:010:029 And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of             Joktan.    01:010:030 And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a             mount of the east.    01:010:031 These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their             tongues, in their lands, after their nations.    01:010:032 These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their             generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8003"],[0,"The Bible, King James version, Book 3: Leviticus (#4)"],[1,"of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for             thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered;

   03:007:036 Which the LORD commanded to be given them of the children of             Israel, in the day that he anointed them, by a statute for             ever throughout their generations.    03:007:037 This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering,             and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of             the consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace             offerings;    03:007:038 Which the LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that             he commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations             unto the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai.    03:008:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,    03:008:002 Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the             anointing oil, and a bullock for the sin offering, and two             rams, and a basket of unleavened bread;    03:008:003 And gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of             the tabernacle of the congregation.    03:008:004 And Moses did as the LORD commanded him; and the assembly was             gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the             congregation.    03:008:005 And Moses said unto the congregation, This is the thing which             the LORD commanded to be done.    03:008:006 And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with             water.    03:008:007 And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle,             and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and             he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound             it unto him therewith.    03:008:008 And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the             breastplate the Urim and the Thummim.    03:008:009 And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, even             upon his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy             crown; as the LORD commanded Moses.    03:008:010 And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle             and all that was therein, and sanctified them.    03:008:011 And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and             anointed the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his             foot, to sanctify them.    03:008:012 And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and             anointed him, to sanctify him.    03:008:013 And Moses brought Aaron's sons, and put coats upon them, and             girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the             LORD commanded Moses.    03:008:014 And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and             his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the             sin offering.    03:008:015 And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the             horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified             the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar,             and sanctified it, to make reconciliation upon it.    03:008:016 And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the             caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and             Moses burned it upon the altar.    03:008:017 But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he             burnt with fire without the camp; as the LORD commanded Moses.    03:008:018 And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and             his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.    03:008:019 And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar             round about.    03:008:020 And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and             the pieces, and the fat.    03:008:021 And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses             burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt sacrifice             for a sweet savour, and an offering made by fire unto the             LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.    03:008:022 And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and             Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.    03:008:023 And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood of it, and put it             upon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his             right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.    03:008:024 And he brought Aaron's sons, and Moses put of the blood upon             the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right             hands, and upon the great toes of their right feet: and Moses             sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.    03:008:025 And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that was             upon the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two             kidneys, and their fat, and the right shoulder:    03:008:026 And out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before the             LORD, he took one unleavened cake, and a cake of oiled bread,             and one wafer, and put them on the fat, and upon the right             shoulder:    03:008:027 And he put all upon Aaron's hands, and upon his sons' hands,             and waved them for a wave offering before the LORD.    03:008:028 And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on             the altar upon the burnt offering: they were consecrations for             a sweet savour: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.    03:008:029 And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering             before the LORD: for of the ram of consecration it was Moses'             part; as the LORD commanded Moses.    03:008:030 And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which             was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, and upon his             garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons' garments with             him; and sanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and             his sons' garments with him.    03:008:031 And"]]]
