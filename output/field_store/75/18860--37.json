On the      other hand the Baptists and Methodists, in their turn, were equally      zealous to establish their own tenets and disprove all others.        \"In the midst of this war of words, and tumult of opinions, I often      said to myself, what is to be done? Who, of all these parties,      are right? or, are they all wrong together? If any one of them be      right, which is it? and how shall I know it?        \"While I was laboring under the extreme difficulties caused by the      contests of these parties of religionists, I was one day reading      the epistle of James, first chapter and fifth verse, which reads,      'If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth unto      all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him.'      Never did any passage of scripture come with more power to the      heart of man than this did at this time to mine. It seemed to      enter with great force into every feeling of my heart. I reflected      on it again and again, knowing that if any person needed wisdom      from God, I did, for how to act I did not know, and, unless I      could get more wisdom than I then had, would never know; for the      teachers of religion of the different sects understood the same      passage so differently, as to destroy all confidence in settling      the question by an appeal to the Bible. At length I came to the      conclusion that I must either remain in darkness and confusion, or      else I must do as James directs--that is, ask of God. I at last      came to the determination to ask of God. So in accordance with      this determination I retired to the woods to make the attempt. It      was on the morning of a beautiful clear day, early in the spring      of 1820. It was the first time in my life that I had made such an      attempt; for amidst all my anxieties I had never as yet made the      attempt to pray vocally. After I had retired into the place where I      had previously designed to go, having looked around me, and finding      myself alone, I knelt down and began to offer up the desires of      my heart to God. I had scarcely done so, when immediately I was      seized upon by some power which entirely overcame me, and had such      astonishing influence over me as to bind my tongue, so that I      could not speak. Thick darkness gathered around me, and it seemed      to me for a time as if I were doomed to sudden destruction. But      exerting all my powers to call upon God to deliver me out of the      power of this enemy which had seized upon me, and at the very      moment when I was ready to sink into despair, and abandon myself      to destruction--not to an imaginary ruin, but to the power of some      actual being from the unseen world, who had such a marvelous power      as I had never before felt in any being--just at this moment of      great alarm, I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above      the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell      upon me. It no sooner appeared than I found myself delivered from      the enemy which held me bound. When the light rested upon me I saw      two personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description,      standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me      by name, and said, pointing to the other, 'this is my beloved son,      hear him:'        \"My object in going to inquire of the Lord, was to know which of      all these sects was right, that I might know which to join. No      sooner, therefore, did I get possession of myself, so as to be able      to speak, than I asked the personages who stood above me in the      light, which of all the sects was right--for at this time it had      never entered into my heart that all were wrong--and which I should      join. I was answered that I should join none of them, for they were      all wrong; and the personage who addressed me said that all their      creeds were an abomination in His sight; that those professors were      all corrupt. 'They draw near me with their lips, but their hearts      are far from me; they teach for doctrine the commandments of men,      having a form of godliness, but they deny the power thereof.' He      again forbade me to join any of them; and many other things did      he say unto me which I cannot write at this time. When I came to      myself again, I found myself lying on my back, looking up into      heaven.\"    \"From this time until the 21st of September, 1823, Joseph continued,  as usual, to labor with his father, and nothing during this interval  occurred of very great importance,--though he suffered, as one would  naturally suppose, every kind of opposition and persecution from the  different orders of religionists.    \"On the evening of the 21st of September, he retired to his bed in  quite a serious and contemplative state of mind. He shortly betook  himself to prayer and supplication to Almighty God, for a manifestation  of his standing before Him, and while thus engaged he received the  following vision:\"        \"While I was thus in the act of calling upon God, I discovered a      light appearing in the room, which continued to increase until the      room was lighter than at noon-day, when immediately a personage      appeared at my bedside, standing in the air, for his feet did      not touch the floor. He had on a loose robe of most exquisite      whiteness. It was a whiteness beyond anything earthly I had ever      seen, nor do I believe that any earthly thing could be made to      appear so exceedingly white and brilliant. His hands were naked,      and his arms also, a little above the wrist; so also were his      feet naked, as were his legs a little above the ankles. His head      and neck were also bare. I could discover that he had no other      clothing on but his robe, as it was open so that I could see into      his bosom. Not only was his robe exceedingly white, but his whole      person was glorious beyond description, and his countenance truly      like lightning. The room was exceedingly light, but not so very      bright as immediately around his person. When I first looked upon      him I was afraid, but the fear soon left me. He called me by name,      and said unto me that he was a messenger sent from the presence of      God to me, and that his name was Moroni; that God had a work for      me to do, and that my name should be had for good and evil among      all nations, kindreds and tongues; or that it should be both good      and evil spoken of among all people. He said there was a book      deposited, written upon gold plates, giving an account of the      former inhabitants of this continent, and the source from whence      they sprung. He also said that the fullness of the everlasting      gospel was contained in it, as delivered by the Saviour to the      ancient inhabitants. Also, that there were two stones in silver      bows, and these stones, fastened to a breastplate, constituted      what is called the urim and thummim, deposited with the plates;      and the possession and use of these stones were what constituted      seers in ancient or former times; and that God had prepared them      for the purpose of translating the book. After telling me these      things, he commenced quoting the prophecies of the Old Testament.      He first quoted a part of the third chapter of Malachi; and he      quoted also the fourth or last chapter of the same prophecy,      though with a little variation from the way it reads in our Bible.      Instead of quoting the first verse as it reads in our books, he      quoted it thus: 'For behold the day cometh that shall burn as an      oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall burn      as stubble, for they that come shall burn them, saith the Lord      of Hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.' And      again he quoted the fifth verse thus: 'Behold, I will reveal unto      you the priesthood by the hand of Elijah the prophet, before the      coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.' He also quoted      the next verse differently: 'And he shall plant in the hearts of      the children the promises made to the fathers, and the hearts of      the children shall turn to their fathers; if it were not so, the      whole earth would be utterly wasted at its coming.' In addition to      these, he quoted the eleventh chapter of Isaiah, saying that it was      about to be fulfilled. He quoted also the third chapter of Acts,      twenty-second and twenty-third verses, precisely as they stand in      our New Testament. He said that that prophet was Christ, but the      day had not yet come 'when they who would not hear His voice should      be cut off from among the people,' but soon would come. He also      quoted the second chapter of Joel, from the twenty-eighth verse to      the last. He also said that this was not yet fulfilled, but was      soon to be. And he further stated the fullness of the Gentiles was      soon to come in. He quoted many other passages of scripture, and      offered many explanations which cannot be mentioned here. Again, he      told me that when I got those plates of which he had spoken (for      the time that they should be obtained was not then fulfilled),      I should not show them to any person, neither the breast-plate,      with the urim and thummim, only to those to whom I should be      commanded to show them; if I did I should be destroyed. While he      was conversing with me about the plates, the vision was"]]]
