[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47316"],[0,"New Witnesses for God (Volume 2 of 3) (#4)"],[1," agreed in the      opinion that Job, while it treats of history about the days of      Moses, or even anterior thereto, was written later than the time      of Solomon; that very little of the Hebrew Psalter was composed by      David; that most of it was composed in the time of the exile or      subsequent thereto; that Solomon's song was not written by Solomon,      and is the drama of a pure woman's love, not a spiritual allegory;      that the book of Isaiah was written certainly by two authors and      perhaps more, the later book being written one hundred years at      least after the earlier and by a prophet now unknown; that the      book of Jonah belongs to the series of moral instruction through      fiction, and that the book of Daniel conveys moral instruction by      means of, to use Dean Farrar's phraseology, one of these \"splendid      specimens of the lofty moral fiction which was always common among      the Jews after the exile.\" [4]    Another recognized authority in the same field of learning in summing  up the results of the so-called \"higher criticism,\" says:        It has thus far done an inestimable service in the removal of the      traditional theories from the sacred books, so that they may be      studied in their real structure and character. . . . . The higher      criticism shows us the process by which the sacred books were      produced, that the most of them were composed by unknown authors,      that they have passed through the hands of a considerable number      of unknown editors who have brought together the older material      without removing discrepancies, inconsistencies and errors.      In this process of editing, arranging, addition, subtraction,      reconstruction and consolidation, extending through many centuries,      what evidence have we that these unknown editors were kept from      error in all their work? [5]    Such dissecting as this can have but one general result--death of  reverence for the Bible; death of faith in it, as the revealed word  of God. The authenticity of the Bible by it is left doubtful; for  while this method of criticism succeeds, with those who affect it, in  proving that Moses is not the author of the five books for so many  centuries accredited to him, it fails to tell us who is the author  of those books. This Higher Criticism tells us that there are two  and perhaps more, authors of the book of Isaiah's prophecies; that  the last twenty-seven chapters were not written by the great Hebrew  prophet whose name the book bears; but it fails to tell us who is the  author of them. Nor can it be determined even when the unknown author  lived. The same is true as to the other books of the Old Testament upon  whose authenticity this system casts its shadow. The system is wholly  destructive in its tendencies; it unsettles everything, it determines  nothing, except that everything with reference to the authenticity,  time of composition, inspiration, and credibility of the Old Testament  is indeterminable. \"It leaves everything hanging in the air,\" says one  able critic of Higher Criticism. \"It begins in guesses and ends in fog.  At all events the result leaves us in a hopeless muddle, and, when that  is the only thing settled, the proposed solution is self-condemned.\"  [6] And yet the Doctor of Divinity who wrote that sentence, Rev. A. J.  F. Behrends, when he comes in his treatise to remark upon the extent  to which the destructive criticism obtains, has to confess that in  eight of the most famous German Universities [7] possessing theological  faculties, and numbering seventy-three professors in all, thirty of  those professors upheld and taught the destructive criticism; while  forty-three were counted conservatives. [8]    A more significant admission, as showing the rapid increase of the  radicals, or liberals, as the upholders of the destructive criticism  are called, will be found in the following statement concerning the  same theological faculties. \"The so-called liberal wing has increased  from ten to thirty during the last twenty-five years; and the  conservatives have been reduced from fifty to forty-three.\"    Of the American universities where the destructive criticism obtains,  Dr. Behrends names eight; [9] and eighteen where \"conservative  criticism holds its ground.\" [10] It should be remembered that these  are admissions of one upholding the conservative criticism as against  radical criticism. The claims of the radical school for the success of  their methods are much more sweeping than the admissions allow. But  taking the extent to which the destructive criticism obtains, even at  the estimate of those who are opposed to it, and who for that reason  reduce its triumphs to a minimum, yet it must be admitted that it has  succeeded in making very marked progress. It permeates all Protestant  Christian countries; and all Protestant Christian sects. It is more  in evidence in the churches than in the schools; and tinctures all  Protestant religious literature. There is scarcely any necessity for  unbelievers in the Bible assailing it from without; the destruction  of faith in it as an authentic, credible, authoritative revelation  from God, whose truths when rightly understood are to be accepted and  held as binding upon the consciences of men, is being carried on from  within the churches who profess to hold the Bible in reverence, more  effectually than it could be by profane infidels. Doctors of Divinity  are more rapidly undermining the faith of the masses in the Bible than  ever a Voltaire, a Paine, a Bradlaugh or an Ingersoll could do; and  that may account for the singular circumstances of absolute silence at  present on the part of popular infidel writers and lecturers. [11]    It is not my purpose here to enter into a discussion of the merits or  demerits of Higher Criticism; to point out what is true in it, and  what false. I am merely calling attention to a condition that has been  created by that method of Bible treatment, viz., a condition of rapidly  increasing unbelief among the masses in the Bible as the undoubted  word of God. The learned who are leaders in the new method of Bible  criticism, after destroying confidence in the authenticity of almost  every book of the Old Testament; after questioning the credibility of  the greater part of all those same books; after retiring some of the  books from the dignified realm of reliable history to the questionable  station of belles-lettres; after saying, \"We are obliged to admit  that there are scientific errors in the Bible, errors of astronomy,  of geology, of zoology, of botany, and anthropology;\" after saying,  \"There are historical mistakes in the Christian scriptures, mistakes  of chronology and geography, errors of historical events and persons,  discrepancies and inconsistencies in the historians, which cannot be  removed by any proper method of interpretation;\" after reducing the  inspired writers to the level of just ordinary historical, poetical,  and fiction-writing authors, by saying that the foregoing enumerated  errors in the sacred books \"are just where you would expect to find  them in accurate, truthful writers of history in ancient times,\" and  that the sacred writers merely \"used with fidelity the best sources  of information accessible to them--ancient poems, popular traditions,  legends and ballads, regal and family archives, codes of law and  ancient narratives,\" and \"there is no evidence that they received any  of this history by revelation from God, there is no evidence that the  divine Spirit corrected their narratives either when they were being  composed in their minds, or written in manuscript;\" after saying, \"we  cannot defend the morals of the Old Testament at all points, * * *  the Patriarchs were not truthful, their age seems to have had little  apprehension of the principles of truth;\" after saying that \"God spake  in much the greater part of the Old Testament through the voices and  pens of the human authors of the scriptures,\" and then ask--\"Did the  human voice and pen in all the numerous writers and editors of the  Holy Scriptures prior to the completion of the Canon always deliver  an inerrant word?\" and, \"Even if all the writers were possessed of  the Holy Spirit as to be merely passive in his hands, the question  arises, can the finite voice and the finite pen deliver and express  the inerrant truth of God?\" After all this, then these Higher Critics  propound the question: Can we, in the face of all the results of our  literary and historical [12] method of treating the scriptures, still  maintain the truthfulness of the Bible? And while they are speculating  how they can make it appear that \"the substantial truthfulness of the  Bible\" need not be inconsistent with the existence of \"circumstantial  errors;\" and are indulging in subtle refinements to show that \"none  of the mistakes, discrepancies and errors which have been discovered  disturb the religious lessons of Biblical history\" [13]--masses who come  to hear of these doubts cast upon what they have hitherto been taught  to regard as the infallible oracles of God, answer off-hand:--If so  much doubt exists as to the authenticity, credibility, inspiration,  and authoritativeness of so great a part of the Bible, how are we  to determine that the few remaining things you urge upon us are of  divine appointment, or reach to any higher level than human conception  and human authority? This their question; and, ever glad to meet  with any excuse that will lend the lightest shadow of justification  for casting aside the restraints which religion imposes upon the  indulgence of human passion, and human inclination to worldliness in  general, they rid themselves of their faith in the word of God, and  in the religion it teaches, and walk abroad in the earth unchecked in  their selfish pursuit of whatsoever may attract the fancy, please the  taste or gratify the passions."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4732"],[0,"Prolegomena to the History of Israel (#4)"],[1,"mit einer Kritik der  Gesetzgebung des Pentateuch (Berlin, 1835; preface dated 12th  October); W.

These are as follows:-- \"1. L'element  historique du Pentateuque peut et doit etre examine a part et ne  pas etre confondu avec l'element legal.  2. L'un et l'autre ont pu  exister sans redaction ecrite.  La mention, chez d'anciens  ecrivains, de certaines traditions patriarcales ou mosaiques, ne  prouve pas l'existence du Pentateuque, et une nation peut avoir un  droit coutumier sans code ecrit.  Les traditions nationales des  Israelites remontent plus haut que les lois du Pentateuque et la  redaction des premieres est anterieure a celle des secondes.  4. L'interet principal de l'historien doit porter sur la date des  lois, parce que sur ce terrain il a plus de chance d'arriver a des  resultats certains.  II faut en consequence proceder a  l'interrogatoire des temoins.  5. L'histoire racontee, dans les  livres des Juges et de Samuel, et meme en partie celle comprise  dans les livres des Rois, est en contradiction avec des lois dites  mosaiques; donc celles-ci etaient inconnues a l'epoque de la  redaction de ces livres, a plus forte raison elles n'ont pas existe  dans les temps qui y vent decrits.  6. Les prophetes du 8e et du  7e siecle ne savent rien du code mosaique.   7. Jeremie est le  premier prophete qui connaisse une loi ecrite et ses citations  rapportent au Deuteronome.  8. Le Deuteronome (iv.45-xxviii.68)  est le livre que les pretres pretendaient avoir trouve dans le  temple du temps du roi Josias.  Ce code est la partie la plus  ancienne de la legislation (redigee) comprise dans le Pentateuque.  9. L'histoire des Israelites, en tant qu'il s'agit du  developpement national determine par des lois ecrites, se divisera  en deux periodes, avant et apres Josias.  10. Ezechiel est  anterieur a la redaction du code rituel et des lois qui ont  definitivement organise la hierarchie.  11. Le livre du Josue  n'est pas, tant s'en faut, la partie la plus recente de l'ouvrage  entier.   12. Le redacteur du Pentateuque se distingue clairement  de l'ancien prophete Moyse.\" --L'Histoire Sainte et la Loi, Paris,  1879, pp. 23, 24.     ******************************************    He indeed did not himself succeed in reaching a sure position,  but he was the first clearly to perceive and point out how  disconnected are the alleged starting-point of Israel's history  and that history itself.  The religious community set up on so  broad a basis in the wilderness, with its sacred centre and uniform  organisation, disappears and leaves no trace as soon as Israel  settles in a land of its own, and becomes, in any proper sense, a  nation.  The period of the Judges presents itself to us as a  confused chaos, out of which order and coherence are gradually  evolved under the pressure of external circumstances, but perfectly  naturally and without the faintest reminiscence of a sacred  unifying constitution that had formerly existed.  Hebrew antiquity  shows absolutely no tendencies towards a hierocracy; power is  wielded solely by the heads of families and of tribes, and by  the kings, who exercise control over religious worship also, and  appoint and depose its priests.  The influence possessed by the  latter is purely moral; the Torah of God is not a document in  their hands which guarantees their own position, but merely an  instruction for others in their mouths; like the word of the  prophets, it has divine authority but not political sanction, and  has validity only in so far as it is voluntarily accepted.  And  as for the literature which has come down to us from the period of  the Kings, it would puzzle the very best intentions to beat up so  many as two or three unambiguous allusions to the Law, and these  cannot be held to prove anything when one considers, by way of  contrast, what Homer was to the Greeks.    To complete the marvel, in post-exile Judaism the Mosaism which  until then had been only latent suddenly emerges into prominence  everywhere.  We now find the Book regarded as the foundation of all  higher life, and the Jews, to borrow the phrase of the Koran, are  \"the people of the Book;\" we have the sanctuary with its priests  and Levites occupying the central position, and the people as a  congregation encamped around it; the cultus, with its  burnt-offerings and sin-offerings, its purifications and its  abstinences, its feasts and Sabbaths, strictly observed as  prescribed by the Law, is now the principal business of life.  When we take the community of the second temple and compare it  with the ancient people of Israel, we are at once able to realise  how far removed was thc latter from so-called Mosaism.  The Jews  themselves were thoroughly conscious of the distance.  The  revision of the books of Judges, Samuel, and Kings, undertaken  towards the end of the Babylonian exile, a revision much more  thorough than is commonly assumed, condemns as heretical the whole  age of the Kings.  At a later date, as the past became more  invested with a certain nimbus of sanctity, men preferred to clothe  it with the characters of legitimacy rather than sit in judgment  upon it.  The Book of Chronicles shows in what manner it was  necessary to deal with the history of bygone times when it was  assumed that the Mosaic hierocracy was their fundamental  institution.     2.  The foregoing remarks are designed merely to make it plain  that the problem we have set before us is not an imaginary one,  but actual and urgent.  They are intended to introduce it; but to  solve it is by no means so easy.  The question what is the  historical place of the Law does not even admit of being put in  these simple terms.  For the Law, If by that word we understand  the entire Pentateuch, is no literary unity, and no simple  historical quantity./1/    *************************  1. Compare the article \"Pentateuch\" in the Ninth edition  of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, vol. xviii.  *************************    Since the days of Peyrerius and Spinoza, criticism has acknowledged  the complex character of that remarkable literary production,  and from Jean Astruc onwards has laboured, not without success,  at disentangling its original elements.  At present there are  a number of results that can be regarded as settled.  The following  are some of them.  The five Books of Moses and the Book of Joshua  constitute one whole, the conquest of the Promised Land rather than  the death of Moses forming the true conclusion of the patriarchal  history, the exodus, and the wandering in the wilderness.  From a literary point of view, accordingly, it is more accurate  to speak of the Hexateuch than of the Pentateuch.  Out of this whole,  the Book of Deuteronomy, as essentially an independent law-book,  admits of being separated most easily.  Of what remains,  the parts most easily distinguished belong to the so-called  \"main stock\" (\"Grundschrift\"), formerly also called the Elohistic  document, on account of the use it makes of the divine name Elohim  up to the time of Moses, and designated by Ewald, with reference  to the regularly recurring superscriptions in Genesis, as the Book of  Origins.  It is distinguished by its liking for number, and  measure, and formula generally, by its stiff pedantic style, by  its constant use of certain phrases and turns of expression which  do not occur elsewhere in the older Hebrew; its characteristics  are more strongly marked than those of any of the others, and  make it accordingly the easiest to recognise with certainty.  Its  basis is the Book of Leviticus and thc allied portions of the  adjoining books,-- Exodus xxv.-xl., with the exception of chaps.  xxxii.-xxxiv., and Num.i.-x., xv.-xix., xxv.-xxxvi., with trifling  exceptions.  It thus contains legislation chiefly, and, in point of  fact, relates substantially to the worship of the tabernacle and  cognate matters.  It is historical only in form; the history  serves merely as a framework on which to arrange thc legislative  material, or as a mask to disguise it.  For the most part, the  thread of the narrative is extremely thin, and often serves  merely to carry out the chronology, which is kept up without a  hiatus from the Creation to the Exodus; it becomes fuller only on  the occasions in which other interests come into play, as, for  example, in Genesis, with regard to the three preludes to the  Mosaic covenant which are connected with the names of Adam, Noah,  and Abraham respectively.  When this fundamental document is also  separated out as well as Deuteronomy, there remains the Jehovistic  history-book, which, in contrast with the two others, is  essentially of a narrative character, and sets forth with full  sympathy and enjoyment the materials handed down by tradition.  The story of the patriarchs, which belongs to this document almost  entirely, is what best marks its character; that story is not  here dealt with merely as a summary introduction to something of  greater importance which is to follow, but as a subject of primary  importance, deserving the fullest treatment possible.  Legislative  elements have been taken into it only at one point, where they  fit into the historical connection, namely, when the giving of the  Law at Sinai is spoken of (Exodusxx.-xx"]]]
