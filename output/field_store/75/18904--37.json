His legend reached  The Mermaid Inn the year that Shakespeare died.  Fynes Moryson had brought his travellers' tales  Of Wheen, the heart-shaped isle where Tycho made  His great discoveries, and, with Jeppe, his dwarf,  And flaxen-haired Christine, the peasant girl,  Dreamed his great dreams for five-and-twenty years.  For there he lit that lanthorn of the law,  Uraniborg; that fortress of the truth,  With Pegasus flying above its loftiest tower,  While, in its roofs, like wide enchanted eyes  Watching, the brightest windows in the world,  Opened upon the stars.    Nine miles from Elsinore, with all those ghosts,  There's magic enough in that! But white-cliffed Wheen,  Six miles in girth, with crowds of hunchback waves  Crawling all round it, and those moonstruck windows,  Held its own magic, too; for Tycho Brahe  By his mysterious alchemy of dreams  Had so enriched the soil, that when the king  Of England wished to buy it, Denmark asked  A price too great for any king on earth.  \"Give us,\" they said, \"in scarlet cardinal's cloth  Enough to cover it, and, at every corner,  Of every piece, a right rose-noble too;  Then all that kings can buy of Wheen is yours.  Only,\" said they, \"a merchant bought it once;  And, when he came to claim it, goblins flocked  All round him, from its forty goblin farms,  And mocked him, bidding him take away the stones  That he had bought, for nothing else was his.\"  These things were fables. They were also true.  They thought him a magician, Tycho Brahe,  The astrologer, who wore the mask of gold.  Perhaps he was. There's magic in the truth;  And only those who find and follow its laws  Can work its miracles.                         Tycho sought the truth  From that strange year in boyhood when he heard  The great eclipse foretold; and, on the day  Appointed, at the very minute even,  Beheld the weirdly punctual shadow creep  Across the sun, bewildering all the birds  With thoughts of evening.                            Picture him, on that day,  The boy at Copenhagen, with his mane  Of thick red hair, thrusting his freckled face  Out of his upper window, holding the piece  Of glass he blackened above his candle-flame  To watch that orange ember in the sky  Wane into smouldering ash.                             He whispered there,  \"So it is true. By searching in the heavens,  Men can foretell the future.\"                                In the street  Below him, throngs were babbling of the plague  That might or might not follow.                                  He resolved  To make himself the master of that deep art  And know what might be known.                                He bought the books  Of Stadius, with his tables of the stars.  Night after night, among the gabled roofs,  Climbing and creeping through a world unknown  Save to the roosting stork, he learned to find  The constellations, Cassiopeia's throne,  The Plough still pointing to the Polar Star,  The sword-belt of Orion. There he watched  The movements of the planets, hours on hours,  And wondered at the mystery of it all.  All this he did in secret, for his birth  Was noble, and such wonderings were a sign  Of low estate, when Tycho Brahe was young;  And all his kinsmen hoped that Tycho Brahe  Would live, serene as they, among his dogs  And horses; or, if honour must be won,  Let the superfluous glory flow from fields  Where blood might still be shed; or from those courts  Where statesmen lie. But Tycho sought the truth.  So, when they sent him in his tutor's charge  To Leipzig, for such studies as they held  More worthy of his princely blood, he searched  The Almagest; and, while his tutor slept,  Measured the delicate angles of the stars,  Out of his window, with his compasses,  His only instrument. Even with this rude aid  He found so many an ancient record wrong  That more and more he burned to find the truth.    One night at home, as Tycho searched the sky,  Out of his window, compasses in hand,  Fixing one point upon a planet, one  Upon some loftier star, a ripple of laughter  Startled him, from the garden walk below.  He lowered his compass, peered into the dark  And saw--Christine, the blue-eyed peasant girl,  With bare brown feet, standing among the flowers.  She held what seemed an apple in her hand;  And, in a voice that Aprilled all his blood,  The low soft voice of earth, drawing him down  From those cold heights to that warm breast of Spring,  A natural voice that had not learned to use  The false tones of the world, simple and clear  As a bird's voice, out of the fragrant darkness called,  \"I saw it falling from your window-ledge!  I thought it was an apple, till it rolled  Over my foot.                It's heavy. Shall I try  To throw it back to you?\"                            Tycho saw a stain  Of purple across one small arched glistening foot.  \"Your foot Is bruised,\" he cried.                                    \"O no,\" she laughed,  And plucked the stain off. \"Only a petal, see.\"  She showed it to him.                        \"But this--I wonder now  If I can throw it.\"                      Twice she tried and failed;  Or Tycho failed to catch that slippery sphere.  He saw the supple body swaying below,  The ripe red lips that parted as she laughed,  And those deep eyes where all the stars were drowned.    At the third time he caught it; and she vanished,  Waving her hand, a little floating moth,  Between the pine-trees, into the warm dark night.  He turned into his room, and quickly thrust  Under his pillow that forbidden fruit;  For the door opened, and the hot red face  Of Otto Brahe, his father, glowered at him.  \"What's this? What's this?\"                              The furious-eyed old man  Limped to the bedside, pulled the mystery out,  And stared upon the strangest apple of Eve  That ever troubled Eden,--heavy as bronze,  And delicately enchased with silver stars,  The small celestial globe that Tycho bought  In Leipzig.              Then the storm burst on his head!  This moon-struck 'pothecary's-prentice  work,  These cheap-jack calendar-maker's gypsy tricks  Would damn the mother of any Knutsdorp squire,  And crown his father like a stag of ten.  Quarrel on quarrel followed from that night,  Till Tycho sickened of his ancient name;  And, wandering through the woods about his home,  Found on a hill-top, ringed with fragrant pines,  A little open glade of whispering ferns.  Thither, at night, he stole to watch the stars;  And there he told the oldest tale on earth  To one that watched beside him, one whose eyes  Shone with true love, more beautiful than the stars,  A daughter of earth, the peasant-girl, Christine.    They met there, in the dusk, on his last night  At home, before he went to Wittenberg.  They stood knee-deep among the whispering ferns,  And said good-bye.                     \"I shall return,\" he said,  \"And shame them for their folly, who would set  Their pride above the stars, Christine, and you.  At Wittenberg or Rostoch I shall find  More chances and more knowledge. All those worlds  Are still to conquer. We know nothing yet;  The books are crammed with fables. They foretell  Here an eclipse, and there a dawning moon,  But most of them were out a month or more  On Jupiter and Saturn.                         There's one way,  And only one, to knowledge of the law  Whereby the stars are steered, and so to read  The future, even perhaps the destinies  Of men and nations,--only one sure way,  And that's to watch them, watch them, and record  The truth we know, and not the lies we dream.  Dear, while I watch them, though the hills and sea  Divide us, every night our eyes can meet  Among those constant glories. Every night  Your eyes and mine, upraised to that bright realm,  Can, in one moment, speak across the world.  I shall come back with knowledge and with power,  And you--will wait for me?\"                              She answered him  In silence, with the starlight of her eyes.          II      He watched the skies at Wittenberg. The plague  Drove him to Rostoch, and he watched them there;  But, even there, the plague of little minds  Beset him. At a wedding-feast he met  His noble countryman, Manderup, who asked,  With mocking courtesy, whether Tycho Brahe  Was ready yet to practise his black art  At country fairs. The guests, and Tycho, laughed;  Whereat the swaggering Junker blandly sneered,  \"If fortune-telling fail, Christine will dance,  Thus--tambourine on hip,\" he struck a pose.  \"Her pretty feet will pack that booth of yours.\"  They fought, at midnight, in a wood, with swords.  And not a spark of light but those that leapt  Blue from the clashing blades. Tycho had lost  His moon and stars awhile, almost his life;  For, in one furious bout, his enemy's blade  Dashed like a scribble of lightning into the face  Of Tycho Brahe, and left him spluttering blood,  Groping through that dark wood with outstretched hands,  To fall in a death-black swoon.                                  They carried him back  To Rostoch; and when Tycho saw at last  That mirrored patch of mutilated flesh,  Seared as by fire, between the frank blue eyes  And firm young mouth where, like a living flower  Upon some stricken tree, youth lingered still,  He'd but one thought, Christine would shrink from him  In fear, or worse, in pity. An end had come  Worse than old age, to all the glory of youth.  Urania would not let her lover stray  Into a mortal's arms. He must remain  Her own, for ever; and for ever, alone.    Yet, as the days went by, to face the world,  He made himself a delicate mask of gold  And silver, shaped like those that minstrels wear  At carnival in Venice, or when love,  Disguising its disguise of mortal flesh,  Wooes as a nameless prince from far away.  And when this world's day, with its blaze and coil  Was ended, and the first white star awoke  In that pure realm where all our tumults die,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6585"],[0,"The Works of Lucian of Samosata — Volume 02 (#4)"],[1,"no son of a  Pyrrhias or a Zopyrion, no Bithynian, to be knocked down under the hammer  of a bawling auctioneer? My dear sir, when pay-day comes round each  month, and you mingle in the herd of Pyrrhiases and Zopyrions, and hold  out your hand for the wage that is due to you, what is that but a sale?  No need of an auctioneer, for the man who can cry his own wares, and  hawks his liberty about from day to day. Wretch! (one is prompted to  exclaim, and particularly when the culprit is a professed philosopher)  Wretch! Were you captured and sold by a pirate or a brigand, you would  bewail your lot, and think that Fortune had dealt hardly with you. Were a  man to lay violent hands on you, and claim a master's rights in you, loud  and bitter would be your outcry: 'By heaven and earth, 'tis monstrous! I  appeal to the laws!' And now, at an age at which a born slave may begin  to look towards Freedom, _now_ for a few pence do you sell yourself,  your virtue and wisdom, in one parcel? And could Plato's noble words,  could all that Chrysippus and Aristotle have said, of the blessings of  freedom and the curse of slavery, raise no compunction in you? Do you  count it no shame to be pitted against toadies and vulgar parasites? no  shame to sit at the noisy banquets of a promiscuous, and for the most  part a disreputable company, a Greek among Romans, wearing the foreign  garb of philosophy, and stammering their tongue with a foreign accent?  How fulsome are your flatteries on these occasions! how indecent your  tipplings! And next morning the bell rings, and up you must get, losing  the best of your sleep, to trudge up and down with yesterday's mud still  on your shoes. Were lupines and wild herbs so scarce with you? had the  springs ceased to give their wonted supply, that you were brought to such  a pass? No, the cause of your captivity is too clear. Not water, not  lupines were the object of your desire, but dainty viands and fragrant  wines; and your sin has found you out: you are hooked like a pike by your  greedy jaws. We have not far to look for the reward of gluttony. Like a  monkey with a collar about its neck, you are kept to make amusement for  the company; fancying yourself supremely happy, because you are unstinted  in the matter of dried figs. As to freedom and generosity, they are fled,  with the memories of Greece, and have left no trace behind them. And  would that that were all, the disgrace of falling from freedom to  servitude! Would that your employments were not those of a very menial!  Consider: are your duties any lighter than those of a Dromo or a Tibius?  As to the studies in which your employer professed an interest when he  engaged you, they are nothing to him. Shall an ass affect the lyre?  Remove from these men's minds the gold and the silver, with the cares  that these involve, and what remains? Pride, luxury, sensuality,  insolence, wantonness, ignorance. Consuming must be their desire, doubt  it not, for the wisdom of Homer, the eloquence of Demosthenes, the  sublimity of Plato!    No, your employer has no need of your services in this direction. On the  other hand, you have a long beard and a venerable countenance; the  Grecian cloak hangs admirably upon your shoulders, and you are known to  be a professor of rhetoric, or literature, or philosophy; it will not be  amiss, he thinks, to have such pursuits represented in the numerous  retinue that marches before him. It will give him an air of Grecian  culture, of liberal curiosity in fact. Friend, friend! your stock-in-  trade would seem to be not words of wisdom, but a cloak and a beard. If  you would do your duty, therefore, be always well in evidence; begin your  unfailing attendance from the early hours of the morning, and never quit  his side. Now and again he places a hand upon your shoulder, and mutters  some nonsense for the benefit of the passers-by, who are to understand  that though he walk abroad the Muses are not forgotten, that in all his  comings and goings he can find elegant employment for his mind.  Breathless and perspiring, you trot, a pitiable spectacle, at the  litter's side; or if he walks--you know what Rome is--, up hill and down  dale after him you tramp. While he is paying a call on a friend, you are  left outside, where, for lack of a seat, you are fain to take out your  book and read standing.    Night finds you hungry and thirsty. You snatch an apology for a bath; and  it is midnight or near it before you get to dinner. You are no longer an  honoured guest; no longer do you engage the attention of the company. You  have retired to make room for some newer capture. Thrust into the most  obscure corner, you sit watching the progress of dinner, gnawing in  canine sort any bones that come down to you and regaling yourself with  hungry zest on such tough mallow-leaves--the wrappers of daintier fare--  as may escape the vigilance of those who sit above you. No slight is  wanting. You have not so much as an egg to call your own; for there is no  reason why you should expect to be treated in the same way as a stranger;  that would be absurd. The birds that fall to your lot are not like other  birds. Your neighbour gets some plump, luscious affair; you, a poor half-  chicken, or lean pigeon, an insult, a positive outrage in poultry. As  often as not, an extra guest appears unexpectedly, and the waiter solves  the difficulty by removing your share (with the whispered consolation  that you are 'one of the family'), and placing it before the new-comer.  When the joint, be it pork or venison, is brought in to be carved, let us  hope that you stand well with the carver, or you will receive a  Promethean helping of 'bones wrapped up in fat.' And the way in which a  dish is whisked past you, after remaining with your neighbour till he can  eat no more!--what free man would endure it, though he were as innocent  of gall as any stag? And I have said nothing yet of the wine. While the  other guests are drinking of some rare old vintage, you have vile thick  stuff, whose colour you must industriously conceal with the help of a  gold or silver cup, lest it should betray the estimation in which the  drinker is held. It would be something if you could get enough even of  this. Alas! you may call and call: the waiter is      as one that marketh not.    Many are your grievances; nay, all is one huge grievance. And the climax  is reached, when you find yourself eclipsed by some minion, some dancing-  master, some vile Alexandrian patterer of Ionic lays. How should you hope  to rank with the minister of Love's pleasures, with the stealthy conveyer  of billets-doux? You cower shamefaced in your corner, and bewail your  hard lot, as well you may; cursing your luck that you have never a  smattering of such graceful accomplishments yourself. I believe you wish  that _you_ could turn love-songs, or sing other men's with a good  grace; perceiving as you do what a thing it is to be in request. Nay, you  could find it in you to play the wizard's, the fortune-teller's part; to  deal in thrones and in millions of money. For these, too, you observe,  make their way in the world, and are high in favour. Gladly would you  enter on any one of these vocations, rather than be a useless castaway.  Alas, even these are beyond you; you lack plausibility. It remains for  you to give place to others; to endure neglect, and keep your complaints  to yourself.    Nay, more. Should some slave whisper that you alone withheld your praise,  when his mistress's favourite danced or played, the neglect may cost you  dear. Then let your dry throat be as busy as any thirsty frog's. See to  it, that your voice is heard leading the chorus of applause; and time  after time, when all else are silent, throw in some studied servile  compliment. The situation is not without humour. Hungry as you are, ay,  and thirsty into the bargain, you must anoint yourself with oil of  gladness, and crown your head with garlands. It reminds one of the  offerings made by recent mourners at a tomb. The tomb gets the ointment  and the garlands, while the mourners drink and enjoy the feast.    If your patron is of a jealous disposition, and has a young wife or  handsome children, and you are not wholly without personal attractions,  then beware! you are on dangerous ground. Many are the ears of a king,  and many the eyes, that see not the truth only, but ever something over  and above the truth, lest they should seem to fail of their office.  Imagine yourself, therefore, at a Persian banquet. Keep your eyes  downwards, lest a eunuch should catch them resting on one of the  concubines. For see, there stands another with his bow ever on the  stretch: one glance at the forbidden object as you raise your cup, and  his arrow is through your jaw before you can put it down.    And now dinner is over; you retire, and snatch a little sleep. But at  cock-crow you are aroused. 'Wretch! Worm that I am!' you exclaim. 'To  sacrifice the pursuits, the society of former days, the placid life  wherein sleep was measured by inclination, and my comings and goings were  unfettered, and all to precipitate myself bodily into this hideous gulf!  And why? What, in God's name, is my glorious recompense? Was there no  other way? Could I not have provided for myself better than this, and  preserved liberty and free-will into the bargain? Alas! the lion is fast  bound in the net. I am haled hither and thither. Pitiable is my lot,  where no honour is to be won, no favour to be hoped for. Untaught,  unpractised in the arts of flattery, I am pitted against professionals. I  am no choice spirit, no jolly companion; to raise a laugh is beyond me.  My presence (well do I know it) is a vexation to my patron, and then most  when he is in his most gracious mood. He finds me sullen; and how to  attune myself to him I know not. If I wear a grim face, I am a sour  fellow, scarcely to be endured. If I assume my most cheerful"]]]
