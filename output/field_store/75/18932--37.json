[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7028"],[0,"The Clicking of Cuthbert (#4)"],[1,"ais! Yais! Cootaboot!\" There was a rush and swirl, as the  effervescent Muscovite burst his way through the throng and rushed to  where Cuthbert sat. He stood for a moment eyeing him excitedly, then,  stooping swiftly, kissed him on both cheeks before Cuthbert could get  his guard up. \"My dear young man, I saw you win ze French Open. Great!  Great! Grand! Superb! Hot stuff, and you can say I said so! Will you  permit one who is but eighteen at Nijni-Novgorod to salute you once  more?\"    And he kissed Cuthbert again. Then, brushing aside one or two  intellectuals who were in the way, he dragged up a chair and sat down.    \"You are a great man!\" he said.    \"Oh, no,\" said Cuthbert modestly.    \"Yais! Great. Most! Very! The way you lay your approach-putts dead from  anywhere!\"    \"Oh, I don't know.\"    Mr. Brusiloff drew his chair closer.    \"Let me tell you one vairy funny story about putting. It was one day I  play at Nijni-Novgorod with the pro. against Lenin and Trotsky, and  Trotsky had a two-inch putt for the hole. But, just as he addresses the  ball, someone in the crowd he tries to assassinate Lenin with a  rewolwer--you know that is our great national sport, trying to  assassinate Lenin with rewolwers--and the bang puts Trotsky off his  stroke and he goes five yards past the hole, and then Lenin, who is  rather shaken, you understand, he misses again himself, and we win the  hole and match and I clean up three hundred and ninety-six thousand  roubles, or fifteen shillings in your money. Some gameovitch! And now  let me tell you one other vairy funny story----\"    Desultory conversation had begun in murmurs over the rest of the room,  as the Wood Hills intellectuals politely endeavoured to conceal the  fact that they realized that they were about as much out of it at this  re-union of twin souls as cats at a dog-show. From time to time they  started as Vladimir Brusiloff's laugh boomed out. Perhaps it was a  consolation to them to know that he was enjoying himself.    As for Adeline, how shall I describe her emotions? She was stunned.  Before her very eyes the stone which the builders had rejected had  become the main thing, the hundred-to-one shot had walked away with the  race. A rush of tender admiration for Cuthbert Banks flooded her heart.  She saw that she had been all wrong. Cuthbert, whom she had always  treated with a patronizing superiority, was really a man to be looked  up to and worshipped. A deep, dreamy sigh shook Adeline's fragile form.    Half an hour later Vladimir and Cuthbert Banks rose.    \"Goot-a-bye, Mrs. Smet-thirst,\" said the Celebrity. \"Zank you for a  most charming visit. My friend Cootaboot and me we go now to shoot a  few holes. You will lend me clobs, friend Cootaboot?\"    \"Any you want.\"    \"The niblicksky is what I use most. Goot-a-bye, Mrs. Smet-thirst.\"    They were moving to the door, when Cuthbert felt a light touch on his  arm. Adeline was looking up at him tenderly.    \"May I come, too, and walk round with you?\"    Cuthbert's bosom heaved.    \"Oh,\" he said, with a tremor in his voice, \"that you would walk round  with me for life!\"    Her eyes met his.    \"Perhaps,\" she whispered, softly, \"it could be arranged.\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"And so,\" (concluded the Oldest Member), \"you see that golf can be of  the greatest practical assistance to a man in Life's struggle. Raymond  Parsloe Devine, who was no player, had to move out of the neighbourhood  immediately, and is now, I believe, writing scenarios out in California  for the Flicker Film Company. Adeline is married to Cuthbert, and it  was only his earnest pleading which prevented her from having their  eldest son christened Abe Mitchell Ribbed-Faced Mashie Banks, for she  is now as keen a devotee of the great game as her husband. Those who  know them say that theirs is a union so devoted, so----\"           *       *       *       *       *    The Sage broke off abruptly, for the young man had rushed to the door  and out into the passage. Through the open door he could hear him  crying passionately to the waiter to bring back his clubs.          2    _A Woman is only a Woman_      On a fine day in the spring, summer, or early autumn, there are few  spots more delightful than the terrace in front of our Golf Club. It is  a vantage-point peculiarly fitted to the man of philosophic mind: for  from it may be seen that varied, never-ending pageant, which men call  Golf, in a number of its aspects. To your right, on the first tee,  stand the cheery optimists who are about to make their opening drive,  happily conscious that even a topped shot will trickle a measurable  distance down the steep hill. Away in the valley, directly in front of  you, is the lake hole, where these same optimists will be converted to  pessimism by the wet splash of a new ball. At your side is the ninth  green, with its sinuous undulations which have so often wrecked the  returning traveller in sight of home. And at various points within your  line of vision are the third tee, the sixth tee, and the sinister  bunkers about the eighth green--none of them lacking in food for the  reflective mind.    It is on this terrace that the Oldest Member sits, watching the younger  generation knocking at the divot. His gaze wanders from Jimmy  Fothergill's two-hundred-and-twenty-yard drive down the hill to the  silver drops that flash up in the sun, as young Freddie Woosley's  mashie-shot drops weakly into the waters of the lake. Returning, it  rests upon Peter Willard, large and tall, and James Todd, small and  slender, as they struggle up the fair-way of the ninth.           *       *       *       *       *    Love (says the Oldest Member) is an emotion which your true golfer  should always treat with suspicion. Do not misunderstand me. I am not  saying that love is a bad thing, only that it is an unknown quantity. I  have known cases where marriage improved a man's game, and other cases  where it seemed to put him right off his stroke. There seems to be no  fixed rule. But what I do say is that a golfer should be cautious. He  should not be led away by the first pretty face. I will tell you a  story that illustrates the point. It is the story of those two men who  have just got on to the ninth green--Peter Willard and James Todd.    There is about great friendships between man and man (said the Oldest  Member) a certain inevitability that can only be compared with the  age-old association of ham and eggs. No one can say when it was that  these two wholesome and palatable food-stuffs first came together, nor  what was the mutual magnetism that brought their deathless partnership  about. One simply feels that it is one of the things that must be so.  Similarly with men. Who can trace to its first beginnings the love of  Damon for Pythias, of David for Jonathan, of Swan for Edgar? Who can  explain what it was about Crosse that first attracted Blackwell? We  simply say, \"These men are friends,\" and leave it at that.    In the case of Peter Willard and James Todd, one may hazard the guess  that the first link in the chain that bound them together was the fact  that they took up golf within a few days of each other, and contrived,  as time went on, to develop such equal form at the game that the most  expert critics are still baffled in their efforts to decide which is  the worse player. I have heard the point argued a hundred times without  any conclusion being reached. Supporters of Peter claim that his  driving off the tee entitles him to an unchallenged pre-eminence among  the world's most hopeless foozlers--only to be discomfited later when  the advocates of James show, by means of diagrams, that no one has ever  surpassed their man in absolute incompetence with the spoon. It is one  of those problems where debate is futile.    Few things draw two men together more surely than a mutual inability to  master golf, coupled with an intense and ever-increasing love for the  game. At the end of the first few months, when a series of costly  experiments had convinced both Peter and James that there was not a  tottering grey-beard nor a toddling infant in the neighbourhood whose  downfall they could encompass, the two became inseparable. It was  pleasanter, they found, to play together, and go neck and neck round  the eighteen holes, than to take on some lissome youngster who could  spatter them all over the course with one old ball and a cut-down cleek  stolen from his father; or some spavined elder who not only rubbed it  into them, but was apt, between strokes, to bore them with personal  reminiscences of the Crimean War. So they began to play together early  and late. In the small hours before breakfast, long ere the first faint  piping of the waking caddie made itself heard from the caddie-shed,  they were half-way through their opening round. And at close of day,  when bats wheeled against the steely sky and the \"pro's\" had stolen  home to rest, you might see them in the deepening dusk, going through  the concluding exercises of their final spasm. After dark, they visited  each other's houses and read golf books.    If you have gathered from what I have said that Peter Willard and James  Todd were fond of golf, I am satisfied. That is the impression I  intended to convey. They were real golfers, for real golf is a thing of  the spirit, not of mere mechanical excellence of stroke.    It must not be thought, however, that they devoted too much of their  time and their thoughts to golf--assuming, indeed, that such a thing is  possible. Each was connected with a business in the metropolis; and  often, before he left for the links, Peter would go to the trouble and  expense of ringing up the office to say he would not be coming in that  day; while I myself have heard James--and this not once, but  frequently--say, while lunching in the club-house, that he had half a  mind to get Gracechurch Street on the 'phone and ask how things were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7037"],[0,"Beric the Briton : a Story of the Roman Invasion (#4)"],[1,"for their  wisdom throughout the tribe, offered to her on the occasion of  their visits.    \"Beric will be a great chief,\" one of the wisest of these said  to her; \"truly his sojourn among the Romans has done great things  for him. It would be well, indeed, if every noble youth throughout  the island were to have such schooling, if he had your son's wit  in taking advantage of it. He will be a great orator; never among  our bards have I heard narrations so clear and so well delivered;  although the deeds he praises are those of our oppressors, one  cannot but feel a thrill of enthusiasm as he tells them. Yea, for  the moment I myself felt half a Roman when he told us of the brave  youth who thrust his hand into the flames, and suffered it to be  consumed in order to impress the invader with a knowledge of the  spirit that animated the Romans, and of the three men who held  against a host the bridge that their friends were breaking down  behind them.    \"If he could stir me thus by his tales of the deeds of our enemies,  what will it be when some day he makes the heroes of Britain his  theme, and calls upon his countrymen to imitate their deeds! I have  heard him called 'the Roman,' Parta. Now that I have listened to  him I know that he will, when the time comes, be one of Rome's most  formidable foes. I will tell you now that Prasutagus, our king,  and his queen Boadicea, spoke to me about Beric, and begged me to  come hither to see for myself this youth of whom they had heard  reports from others, some saying that he had returned a Roman  heart and soul, while others affirmed that, while he had learned  much from them, he had forgotten nothing of the injuries he had  received at their hands in the death of his father, and the disaster  of the tribe. I shall know now what to tell them. To Prasutagus,  whose fear of the Romans is even greater than his hatred for them,  I shall say that the lad is full of the glories of Roman story,  and that there is no fear of his doing or saying aught that will  excite the anger or suspicion of the Romans. To Boadicea, who hates  the Romans far more than she fears them, I shall tell the truth,  and shall inform her that when the time comes, as assuredly it some  day will, that the Iceni are called upon to defend their liberties  against Rome, in Beric she will find a champion of whom I predict  that he will be worthy to take his place in our history by the  side of Caractacus and Cassivelaunus. May our gods avert that, like  them, he fall a victim to British treachery!\"    After leaving Boduoc, Beric crossed the bridge built by the Romans  over the Stour, and entered the city. Camalodunum was the chief  seat of the Roman power in England. Although but so short a time  had elapsed since Claudius had occupied it, it was already a large  city. A comparatively small proportion, however, was Roman work, but  all bore the impress of Roman art and civilization, for Cunobeline,  whose capital it had been, was a highly enlightened king, and had  introduced Roman ways and methods among his people. Men instructed  in their arts and architecture had been largely employed in the  building of the town, and its edifices would have borne comparison  with those in minor towns in the Roman provinces.    The conquerors, therefore, found much of their work done for them.  The original possessors of the houses and of the highly cultivated  lands lying round the town were ejected wholesale, and the Romans,  establishing themselves in their abodes and farms, then proceeded  to add to, embellish, and fortify the town. The 2nd, 9th, and 14th  Legions were selected by Claudius to found what was called the  colony, and to take possession of the surrounding country. Plautius  was appointed propraetor, or governor, and establishing himself in  the royal palace of Cunobeline, his first step was to protect the  city from renewed attacks by the Britons. He accordingly erected  vast works to the westward of the town, extending from the sea  to the river, by which means he not only protected the city from  attack, but gained, in case of an assault by overpowering numbers,  the means of retiring safely to Mersea Island, lying a short distance  from the shore.    A council house and a tribunal were erected for the Roman magistrates;  temples, a theatre, and baths raised. The civilian population  increased rapidly. Architects, artists, and musicians, decorators,  skilled artisans, and traders were attracted from the mainland to  the rising city, which rapidly increased in wealth and importance.  Conspicuous on the most elevated position stood a temple erected to  the honour of Claudius, who was raised by the grateful legionaries  to divine rank. So strong and populous was the city that the  Trinobantes, during the years that had elapsed since the Romans  took possession of it, remained passive under the yoke of their  oppressors, and watched, without attempting to take part in them,  the rising of the Iceni and Brigantes, the long and desperate war  of the Silures and Ordovices under Caractacus, and the reduction  of the Belgae and Dumnonii from Hampshire to Cornwall by Vespasian.  Yet, had their spirit remained unbroken, there was an opportunity  for revenge, for a large part of the veteran legionaries had been  withdrawn to take part in the struggle against the western tribes.  The tribe had, however, been disarmed, and with Camalodunum on the  north, and the rising towns of London and Verulamium on the south,  they were cut off from other tribes, and could not hope for final  success, unless the powerful Iceni, who were still semi-independent,  rose in the national cause. Whether their easy defeat of this tribe  soon after the occupation of Camalodunum had rendered the Romans  contemptuous of their fighting powers, or that they deemed it wiser  to subdue the southwest and west of England, and to strike a heavy  blow at the Brigantes to the north before interfering with a powerful  tribe so close to their doors, is uncertain; but doubtless they  felt that so long as Prasutagus reigned there was little fear of  trouble in that quarter, as that king protested himself the friend  and ally of Rome, and occupied himself wholly in acquiring wealth  and adding to his personal possessions.    The scene in Camalodunum was a familiar one to Beric. The streets  were thronged with people. Traders from Gaul and Italy, Roman  artisans and workmen, haughty legionaries with shield and helmet,  civil officials, Greek players, artists and decorators, native  tribesmen, with the products of their fields or the spoils of the  chase, walking with humble mien; and shopkeepers sitting at the open  fronts of their houses, while their slaves called the attention of  passersby to the merits of the goods. Here were the rich products  of Eastern looms, there the cloths and linen of Rome, further on a  smith's shop in full work, beyond that a silversmith's, next door  to which was a thriving trader who sold unguents and perfumes, dyes  for the ladies' cheeks and pigments for their eyebrows, dainty  requisites for the toilette, and perfumed soap. Bakers and butchers,  vendors of fish and game, of fruit, of Eastern spices and flavourings  abounded.    Druggists and dealers in dyes for clothing and in the pigments used  in wall decorations and paintings were also to be found; and, in  fact, this Roman capital of a scarcely subjugated country contained  all the appliances for luxury and comfort that could be found in  the cities of the civilized provinces.    The only shops at which Beric paused were those of the armourers  and of the scribes, at some of which were exhibited vellums with  the writings of the Greek and Roman poets and historians; and  Beric muttered to himself, \"If I am ever present at the sack of  Camalodunum these shall be my share of the spoil, and I fancy that  no one is likely to dispute their possession with me.\"    But he did not linger long. Boduoc would be waiting for him, and  he could not hurry over his visit, the first he had paid since  his absence; therefore he pushed on, with scarce a glance at the  stately temple of Claudius, the magnificent baths or other public  buildings, until he arrived at the villa of Caius Muro, which stood  somewhat beyond the more crowded part of the town.        CHAPTER II: CITY AND FOREST      The house of Caius Muro had been built six years before on the model  of one owned by him in the Tuscan hills. Passing through the hall  or vestibule, with its mosaic pavement, on which was the word of  welcome, \"Salve!\" Beric entered the atrium, the principal apartment  in the house. From each side, at a height of some twenty feet from  the ground, extended a roof, the fall being slightly to the centre,  where there was an aperture of about eight feet square. Through this  light and air made their way down to the apartment, the rainfall  from the roofs and opening falling into a marble tank, called  the impluvium, below the level of the floor, which was paved with  squares of coloured marble. On either side of the atrium were the  small sleeping chambers, the bed places being raised and covered  with thick mats and rugs.    The walls of the bed chambers as well as of the atrium were painted  in black, with figures and landscapes in colour. On the centre of  the side facing the vestibule was the tablinum, the apartment of  Caius Muro himself. This formed his sitting room and study. The  floor was raised about a foot above that of the atrium, and it was  partly open both on that side and on the other, looking into the  peristylium, so that, while at work, he commanded a view of all that  was going on in the atrium and in the courtyard. In the centre of  this was a fountain surrounded by plants. From the courtyard opened  the triclinium, or dining room, and also rooms used as storerooms,  kitchen, and the sleeping places of the slaves.    At the back of the peristylium was the oecus, or"]]]
