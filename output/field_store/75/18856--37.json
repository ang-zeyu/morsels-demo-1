[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53499"],[0,"Martin Luther (#4)"],[1,"be servants of the people who comprise the church, rather than servants  of a papal hierarchy. They cannot interfere with grace. It is God's free  gift to the individual believer.    In the course of his treatise Luther also asserted that there are only  two sacraments--baptism and the Lord's Supper--rather than seven as  taught in Roman Catholicism. A sacrament, he held, had to be instituted  by Christ, contain a divine promise of the forgiveness of sins, and make  use of an earthly element (water, bread, wine). Confirmation,  ordination, marriage, penance, and extreme unction were rejected as  sacraments because they lacked some of the prescribed characteristics.    The mass had been seen as a repetition of Christ's incarnation and  crucifixion at the hands of a priest before the altar. By this sacrifice  man tried to earn grace. Now it became the Lord's Supper--a communion of  the believing Christian with his Saviour. Both the bread and the wine  should be received by the communicant, Luther insisted. While Christ is  really present in the elements, the bread does not become flesh nor the  wine blood through a magical act called transubstantiation. Moreover,  Christ is not sacrificed anew whenever the mass is celebrated. His  sacrifice on the cross was for all time. Through that sacrifice a man's  sins are remitted if he has faith.                                 Christian Liberty    Miltitz, the papal nuncio who previously had failed to reconcile Luther  and the pope, tried again in October, 1520. He had Luther agree to write  a letter to Leo X assuring him that there was nothing personal in his  attacks on the papacy.    In the letter, Luther cautioned Leo against listening to those of his  advisers who would make him a demigod, who put him above councils, who  make him the final authority in interpreting Scripture, \"for through  them Satan already has made much headway.\" He also assured Leo that he  was an obedient servant of the church and that he was not inveighing  against him personally.    Accompanying the letter was a copy of Luther's latest pamphlet, \"A  Treatise on Christian Liberty.\" It expresses calm Christian reflection  quite different from the theological conflicts which were carried  forward in his other treatises. At the outset it poses two propositions  which seem to be a paradox: \"A Christian man is a perfectly free lord of  all, subject to none,\" and \"A Christian man is a perfectly dutiful  servant of all, subject to all.\"    The first proposition acknowledges man as a sinner, but one who has been  liberated and restored to a right relationship with God through  justifying grace. In justifying man, God has freed him from the  consequence of his sins because of Christ's atonement.    This freedom affects a man's whole life. Not only is he free from the  consequences of sin, but he is no longer shackled by his own hates,  passions, and wilful desires. Because this freedom is based on his own  personal relationship with God, no one can interfere. He is \"subject to  none.\"    The second proposition indicates that the free man's life takes a  different direction. Originally he was concerned with himself, but now  the reborn person, in gratitude for his own freedom, serves his  neighbor. His motive is not merely humanitarian, but stems out of a  sincere desire to help others become free too. Love permits him to do no  less than become the servant of all.    The treatise and letter would have scant effect on Pope Leo. Five months  previously he had signed a bull excommunicating Luther.                                   The Papal Bull    A chronological listing of events can be misleading--for instance those  concerning the papal bull. It was signed by Leo on June 15, 1520. It  reached Luther officially on October 10. He immediately wrote a fiery  epistle denouncing it and Eck, whose style and invective he recognized.  Aware that the bull was being circulated and that his literature was  being burned, he nevertheless sat down in November and wrote a friendly  letter to the pope accompanying it with his treatise on Christian  liberty.    On the surface this would indicate insincerity, but events shaped up to  prove he was being consistent. Although he knew he had personal enemies,  he never lost sight of the fact that he was fighting a system rather  than individuals. The pope, for him, was merely a figurehead, in this  instance the symbol of an intolerable autocracy in an area where  individual freedom before God was essential.    The papal bull credited Luther with forty-one errors, called for the  burning of his books, charged heresy, gave him sixty days to submit, and  warned everyone against sheltering him in his excommunication.  Distribution of the bull was in the hands of Eck and papal legate Jerome  Aleander. They succeeded in posting copies of the bull and burning books  in several cities, but largely their efforts were unsuccessful due to  strenuous opposition by the German people.    On December 10, probably in reprisal for a book-burning at Cologne,  Melanchthon posted a notice on the Wittenberg University bulletin board  inviting students and faculty to a bonfire outside the Elster gate of  the city. Books on scholastic theology, and especially those works of  canon law on which the pope and the Roman hierarchy based their claims  to power, were tossed into the flames. Then Luther stepped forward  quietly and with a prayer on his lips added the booklet containing the  papal bull to the fire. He and the professors withdrew but the students  made a holiday of the affair, parading and singing throughout the town  and burning books of Luther's opponents.    Significantly, the bonfire marked the end of the sixty-day period of  grace. From now on no one was to communicate with Luther or provide him  with the necessities of life. In the eyes of Rome he was an outlaw.        [Illustration: (uncaptioned)]          THE MONK STANDS FIRM                                 The Diet of Worms    Overtones of intrigue and statecraft are dominant in the prelude to the  imperial assembly at Worms. The church at Rome had given its decision.  Would the secular authorities now take action and turn him over to the  papal authorities?    Charles, at his coronation as emperor, had subscribed to the imperial  constitution which said no German should be taken outside his country  for trial, and also that no one should be outlawed without a hearing.  Frederick the Wise, Luther's elector, took no action against him, using  these same reasons as an excuse. Aleander, the papal representative,  wanted the case settled arbitrarily by the emperor since he was well  aware of the support Luther would receive at a public hearing. The man  had been condemned by the church, he argued, and as good churchmen the  rulers should simply apprehend the Wittenberg monk without a further  examination of his views.    For the first three months of 1521 the diet devoted itself chiefly to  transacting state business. During this period Emperor Charles changed  his mind several times about inviting the Wittenberg monk for a hearing.  Finally, on March 6, against his will, he offered Luther a safe-conduct  to Worms.    In a two-wheeled cart Luther and a few companions set out from  Wittenberg on April 2. Cities along the way welcomed him and invited him  to preach, but no reception equaled the one on his arrival at Worms.  When the party was sighted from the cathedral tower at 10 A. M., on  April 16, a group of horsemen dashed out to act as an escort through the  city gate. Two thousand spectators thronged the streets so that Luther  was barely able to reach his lodging in the house of the Knights of St.  John.    He was summoned to appear at four o'clock the following afternoon, and  because of the crowds in the streets was conducted through gardens and  alleys to the episcopal palace where the diet was meeting. When the door  of the assembly hall was opened, Luther was ushered through a company of  princes, nobles, and ecclesiastics to the foot of a canopied chair. On  it sat Charles, the twenty-one-year-old emperor. Near by was a table  loaded with books.                                Answer Without Horns    After the opening courtesies had been dispatched the presiding officer,  an official of the archbishop of Trier, pointed to the books, asked  Luther if he was the author, and if he was ready to retract what he had  written.    Luther had been instructed to speak only in answer to direct questions  and was not to seek a discussion. However, this double question could  not be answered yes or no. He paused and his legal adviser asked that  the titles be read. Luther then acknowledged that the books were his.    Again the question, \"Will you retract...?\"    The monk believed his writing was an accurate interpretation of God's  Word. In his mind was Christ's admonition to the disciples \"whosoever  shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father....\"  Since salvation was involved he asked time to think over the answer. The  diet agreed that he should return at four the next afternoon.    After a night of prayer Luther again appeared before the impressive  assembly. This time a larger hall had been chosen because of the  tremendous crowd. Again the formalities, and again the question, but  this time phrased a bit differently. \"Do you defend all of your books or  are you willing to recall some things?\" This was the opening Luther had  been seeking and he quickly shaped his strategy to take advantage of it.  They were forcing him to make a speech since a categorical answer was  impossible.    The books were in three classes, Luther explained. The first was purely  devotional and had been commended even by his enemies. The second was  against the papacy. If he recanted these he would open the door to  further tyranny and impiety. The third class inveighed against  individuals, and in these he admitted he had used"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53506"],[0,"A Collection of Kachári Folk-Tales and Rhymes (#4)"],[1," bî hingzaukhô  sùng­naise. \"Nangnù mosâ gâkhir hùfai-nù nâ?\" Bî khithânaise, gâkhir  ârù bînî fisâ bù mâse âdâiâ lâbodang.\" Biau bî hamâ man-naise.
