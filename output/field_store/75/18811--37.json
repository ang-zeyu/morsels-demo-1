A  party of these hailing from Toronto and Ottawa were lately in England on  their journey to the Cape. Every one who met these ladies was struck  with the earnestness they showed and the ability they displayed in  conversing on the subject of their hopes and expectations. They seemed a  lot drafted from the best women instructresses in some New England  State. But Ontario can well afford now to be compared with the best of  the New England States in regard to her public instruction. Her schools  of all kinds are excellent. A \"send off\" meeting was held in the  Jerusalem Chamber at Westminster Abbey for a party of fifty. They were  addressed by Mr. Chamberlain and Lord Peel. Now that peace has come and  the camps will have been broken up, these women will doubtless find  equally useful employment under the Education Department in the New  Colonies. The Government here have a large \"reservoir\" to draw upon in  the women who are employed in the telegraph and postal service in Great  Britain. Any of these persons would immediately find a sphere of  activity in the new lands. The population of these countries is certain  to increase rapidly with the opening of the old mines and the successful  exploitation of new. There are large centres of industry where there is  no want of water, where there is a certainty of good mining success, and  where communities will grow up anxious for good schools, and well able  to pay for instructors and instructresses.    [Illustration: Photo: Wilson, Aberdeen.    THE DOCKS, CAPE TOWN.]    It is a curious thing that while at the Cape and elsewhere you find in  the hotels plenty of Swiss and German and some French waitresses and  housemaids, you find few English. Why? It must be only from want of  organisation. At Grahamstown, not far from the bay called Algoa by the  Portuguese (whose thoughts went to Goa in India, and named Algoa and  Delagoa as calling places for Goa ships) there has been an institution  for instruction lately founded. Let me cite here the work of the South  African Expansion Committee in their own words.         This Association is established to promote Protected       Emigration, due regard being had to the interests both of the       Emigrants and of the countries to which they go.         The Association pledges  itself:--        (_a_) To Emigrate only such Women and Girls as are of good          character and capacity.        (_b_) To select only such Men and Families as are suitable to          the requirements of each Colony.        (_c_) To secure for them proper Protection on the voyage, and          adequate Reception on arrival.        (_d_) If possible, not to lose sight of them for a year or two          after their Emigration.        (_e_) To raise a Loan Fund for necessitous cases, repayment          being secured on detained wages.         It is recognised by prominent statesmen of all parties that the       future of our South African possessions depends on their       colonisation--not only by the large bodies of active and       energetic men, who at the close of the war will find permanent       employment there--but also by trained and capable women. Many       situations and professions are already awaiting them, and as       the country becomes more settled, fresh openings of all sorts       will arise.         Women of proved suitability are prepared to go, when the right       time comes, but a great barrier to all extensive development of       this essential movement is lack of funds.         Financial support is needed for the following  purposes:--        (1) The establishment, on sound business principles, of Hostels          at Cape Town[1] and at the chief centres, such as Durban,          Pretoria, Kimberley, Johannesburg, Bloemfontein, Bulawayo,          Salisbury, &c., where women and girls can be received for a          few days on arrival, and where, if they have daily          engagements, they may reside permanently. Each of these          Hostels would be also an employment Bureau for every kind          of women's work, and would require a capable salaried Lady          Superintendent to manage the Home and the Employment          Bureau, and to act as correspondent between Employer and          Employed.        (2) Provision for the proper care and guidance of women          throughout the journey from the British Isles to their final          destination in South Africa.        (3) Grants in aid of passages from the British Isles to South          Africa when the traveller cannot afford the whole cost, or          loans to be repaid within a given period.        (4) Preparation of women at the Leaton Colonial Training Home,          Wellington, Salop.        (5) Secretarial Expenses.         British men and women must alike desire for our new       territories, and for South Africa generally, the same ordered,       wholesome, law-abiding traditions as are to be found in the Old       Country; and these can only be built up on a lasting basis, by       rendering life possible there as here for suitable women,       whether as teachers, nurses, secretaries, typists, telegraph or       telephone clerks, sempstresses, or household assistants.         We would appeal for funds not only to help those who go to earn       their daily bread, but also to enable the wives, the daughters,       and sisters of settlers to join their belongings in the new       country. Many a man could make a home for his wife or sister       but for the initial cost of her passage and the difficulties of       the journey for inexperienced women. Openings in the new       territories are declined by men at the front, because they       cannot bring out those dependent upon them at home. They need       that the ocean be bridged for them by kindly forethought, by       experienced and economical organisation, by suitable       protection, and by carefully adjusted financial assistance.         It is surely not much to ask that those to whom domestic       comfort is a matter of course, should contribute in these ways       to make a home life possible for those upon whom the future of       South Africa depends.         The Lady Knightley, of Fawsley, in regard to the preparation       for women going to South Africa, says:--         \"In laying before the public the scheme for assisting the       emigration of women of all classes to South Africa, the Council       are specially anxious to enlist the active co-operation of       ladies in all parts of the country, and with a view to securing       this assistance, they desire to draw the attention, of those       who may be disposed to help, to various methods of forwarding       the scheme, in the hope that some one or other of them may       prove feasible.         \"Ladies could insure that those desiring to emigrate should       have the opportunity of fitting themselves for their new life       by helping to provide instruction for them in various       departments of practical life.         \"1. Cooking, Dairying, Poultry-keeping.         \"2. Breadmaking, Laundry-work.         \"3. Needlework, Cutting out.         \"4. Gardening, Fruit-packing, Bee-keeping.         \"5. Ambulance, Nursing, Health teaching.         \"In some parts of the country this will be best accomplished by       arranging for attendance at County Council Classes for       Technical Instruction, or by putting people in the way of       gaining the Scholarships which some County Councils provide for       dairying, others for nursing, &c. In other districts, where       such Classes or Scholarships are not provided by the County       Council, or where the Classes are inconvenient of access, it       might be arranged for such instruction to be given in a country       house. Good, old-fashioned, upper servants, of whom there are       some left, might in some cases be glad to help in this way.         \"An even better plan would be to arrange for girls and young       women (especially those from towns) to pass a month or two in a       farmhouse, where, under a capable farmer's wife, much of the       required teaching would come naturally in the routine of the       household. In this way a foundation might be laid which would       render the traveller of far greater use on her first arrival       in South Africa than would otherwise be the case, and also more       able to acquire further knowledge should she obtain a situation       on a poultry or other farm.         \"The improved methods of poultry-keeping inaugurated by the       National Poultry Organisation, 12 Hanover Square, should, if       possible, be studied. Ladies might supply intending travellers       with copies of its valuable leaflets.         \"Some knowledge of gardening should be acquired, preferably       through the medium of the Swanley Ladies' Horticultural       College. But should this prove too long and expensive a       training, a good deal might be learnt from a head gardener if       ladies would make it easy for such instruction to be given. The       best methods of packing fruit should also be acquired, and in       towns, ladies who are large customers of fruit salesmen might       make interest with them for giving instruction.         \"Ladies who are Members of County Bee-keeping Associations       might be able to obtain for intending Emigrants some       instruction from the Expert usually attached to such       Associations. Mr. Theodore Bent has pointed out that in a       country where wild bees do so well as they do in South Africa,       tame bees ought to succeed, and as butter at present is       somewhat scarce, honey might become a valuable article of food.       The same remark applies to jam, and jam-making should be       included in the subjects to be taught.         \"If possible, intending travellers should attend"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4747"],[0,"The River's End (#4)"],[1,"of a yesterday that had  dragged itself on like a century. All at once he seemed unburdened of  shackles that had weighted him down to the point of madness. Every  fiber in his body responded to that glorious roar of the fire; a thing  seemed to snap in his head, freeing it of an oppressive bondage, and in  the heart of the flames he saw home, and hope, and life--the things  familiar and precious long ago, which the scourge of the north had  almost beaten dead in his memory. He saw the broad Saskatchewan  shimmering its way through the yellow plains, banked in by the  foothills and the golden mists of morning dawn; he saw his home town  clinging to its shore on one side and with its back against the purple  wilderness on the other; he heard the rhythmic chug, chug, chug of the  old gold dredge and the rattle of its chains as it devoured its tons of  sand for a few grains of treasure; over him there were lacy clouds in a  blue heaven again, he heard the sound of voices, the tread of feet,  laughter--life. His soul reborn, he rose to his feet and stretched his  arms until the muscles snapped. No, they would not know him back  there--now! He laughed softly as he thought of the old John  Keith--\"Johnny\" they used to call him up and down the few  balsam-scented streets--his father's right-hand man mentally but a  little off feed, as his chum, Reddy McTabb, used to say, when it came  to the matter of muscle and brawn. He could look back on things without  excitement now. Even hatred had burned itself out, and he found himself  wondering if old Judge Kirkstone's house looked the same on the top of  the hill, and if Miriam Kirkstone had come back to live there after  that terrible night when he had returned to avenge his father.    Four years! It was not so very long, though the years had seemed like a  lifetime to him. There would not be many changes. Everything would be  the same--everything--except--the old home. That home he and his father  had planned, and they had overseen the building of it, a chateau of  logs a little distance from the town, with the Saskatchewan sweeping  below it and the forest at its doors. Masterless, it must have seen  changes in those four years. Fumbling in his pocket, his fingers  touched Conniston's watch. He drew it out and let the firelight play on  the open dial. It was ten o'clock. In the back of the premier half of  the case Conniston had at some time or another pasted a picture. It  must have been a long time ago, for the face was faded and indistinct.  The eyes alone were undimmed, and in the flash of the fire they took on  a living glow as they looked at Keith. It was the face of a young  girl--a schoolgirl, Keith thought, of ten or twelve. Yet the eyes  seemed older; they seemed pleading with someone, speaking a message  that had come spontaneously out of the soul of the child. Keith closed  the watch. Its tick, tick, tick rose louder to his ears. He dropped it  in his pocket. He could still hear it.    A pitch-filled spruce knot exploded with the startling vividness of a  star bomb, and with it came a dull sort of mental shock to Keith. He  was sure that for an instant he had seen Conniston's face and that the  Englishman's eyes were looking at him as the eyes had looked at him out  of the face in the watch. The deception was so real that it sent him  back a step, staring, and then, his eyes striving to catch the illusion  again, there fell upon him a realization of the tremendous strain he  had been under for many hours. It had been days since he had slept  soundly. Yet he was not sleepy now; he scarcely felt fatigue. The  instinct of self-preservation made him arrange his sleeping-bag on a  carpet of spruce boughs in the tent and go to bed.    Even then, for a long time, he lay in the grip of a harrowing  wakefulness. He closed his eyes, but it was impossible for him to hold  them closed. The sounds of the night came to him with painful  distinctness--the crackling of the fire, the serpent-like hiss of the  flaming pitch, the whispering of the tree tops, and the steady tick,  tick, tick of Conniston's watch. And out on the barren, through the rim  of sheltering trees, the wind was beginning to moan its everlasting  whimper and sob of loneliness. In spite of his clenched hands and his  fighting determination to hold it off, Keith fancied that he heard  again--riding strangely in that wind--the sound of Conniston's voice.  And suddenly he asked himself: What did it mean? What was it that  Conniston had forgotten? What was it that Conniston had been trying to  tell him all that day, when he had felt the presence of him in the  gloom of the Barrens? Was it that Conniston wanted him to come back?    He tried to rid himself of the depressing insistence of that thought.  And yet he was certain that in the last half-hour before death entered  the cabin the Englishman had wanted to tell him something and had  crucified the desire. There was the triumph of an iron courage in those  last words, \"Remember, old chap, you win or lose the moment McDowell  first sets his eyes on you!\"--but in the next instant, as death sent  home its thrust, Keith had caught a glimpse of Conniston's naked soul,  and in that final moment when speech was gone forever, he knew that  Conniston was fighting to make his lips utter words which he had left  unspoken until too late. And Keith, listening to the moaning of the  wind and the crackling of the fire, found himself repeating over and  over again, \"What was it he wanted to say?\"    In a lull in the wind Conniston's watch seemed to beat like a heart in  its case, and swiftly its tick, tick, ticked to his ears an answer,  \"Come back, come back, come back!\"    With a cry at his own pitiable weakness, Keith thrust the thing far  under his sleeping-bag, and there its sound was smothered. At last  sleep overcame him like a restless anesthesia.    With the break of another day he came out of his tent and stirred the  fire. There were still bits of burning ember, and these he fanned into  life and added to their flame fresh fuel. He could not easily forget  last night's torture, but its significance was gone. He laughed at his  own folly and wondered what Conniston himself would have thought of his  nervousness. For the first time in years he thought of the old days  down at college where, among other things, he had made a mark for  himself in psychology. He had considered himself an expert in the  discussion and understanding of phenomena of the mind. Afterward he had  lived up to the mark and had profited by his beliefs, and the fact that  a simple relaxation of his mental machinery had so disturbed him last  night amused him now. The solution was easy. It was his mind struggling  to equilibrium after four years of brain-fag. And he felt better. His  brain was clearer. He listened to the watch and found its ticking  natural. He braced himself to another effort and whistled as he  prepared his breakfast.    After that he packed his dunnage and continued south. He wondered if  Conniston ever knew his Manual as he learned it now. At the end of the  sixth day he could repeat it from cover to cover. Every hour he made it  a practice to stop short and salute the trees about him. McDowell would  not catch him there.    \"I am Derwent Conniston,\" he kept telling himself. \"John Keith is  dead--dead. I buried him back there under the cabin, the cabin built by  Sergeant Trossy and his patrol in nineteen hundred and eight. My name  is Conniston--Derwent Conniston.\"    In his years of aloneness he had grown into the habit of talking to  himself--or with himself--to keep up his courage and sanity. \"Keith,  old boy, we've got to fight it out,\" he would say. Now it was,  \"Conniston, old chap, we'll win or die.\" After the third day, he never  spoke of John Keith except as a man who was dead. And over the dead  John Keith he spread Conniston's mantle. \"John Keith died game, sir,\"  he said to McDowell, who was a tree. \"He was the finest chap I ever  knew.\"    On this sixth day came the miracle. For the first time in many months  John Keith saw the sun. He had seen the murky glow of it before this,  fighting to break through the pall of fog and haze that hung over the  Barrens, but this sixth day it was the sun, the real sun, bursting in  all its glory for a short space over the northern world. Each day after  this the sun was nearer and warmer, as the arctic vapor clouds and  frost smoke were left farther behind, and not until he had passed  beyond the ice fogs entirely did Keith swing westward. He did not  hurry, for now that he was out of his prison, he wanted time in which  to feel the first exhilarating thrill of his freedom. And more than all  else he knew that he must measure and test himself for the tremendous  fight ahead of him.    Now that the sun and the blue sky had cleared his brain, he saw the  hundred pit-falls in his way, the hundred little slips that might be  made, the hundred traps waiting for any chance blunder on his part.  Deliberately he was on his way to the hangman. Down there--every day of  his life--he would rub elbows with him as he passed his fellow men in  the street. He would never completely feel himself out of the presence  of death. Day and night he must watch himself and guard himself, his  tongue, his feet, his thoughts, never knowing in what hour the eyes of  the law would pierce the veneer of his disguise and deliver his life as  the forfeit. There were times when the contemplation of these things  appalled him, and his mind turned to other channels of escape. And  then--always--he heard Conniston's cool, fighting voice, and the red  blood fired up in his veins, and he faced home.    He was Derwent Conniston. And never for an hour could he put out of his  mind the one great mystifying question in this adventure of life and  death, who was Derwent Conniston? Shred by shred he pieced together  what little he knew, and always he arrived at "]]]
