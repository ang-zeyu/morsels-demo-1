Lay in a  circular dish half a pound of minced ham, pour round it the thick white  sauce, and round that again the hot spinach. This makes a pretty dish,  and it is not costly.    [_Mme. Braconniere_.]          A DISH OF HARICOT BEANS    Put the haricots to soak for six hours in cold water. Boil them in water  with one carrot, one onion, salt, two cloves, a good pinch of dried  herbs. Drain off the liquor from the haricots. Chop up a shallot, and  fry it in butter; add your haricots, with pepper and salt and tomato  puree. Stir well, and serve with minced parsley scattered at the top.    [_Mme. Goffaux_.]          POTATOES IN THE BELGIAN MANNER    Take some slices of streaky bacon, about five inches long, and heat them  in a pan. When the bacon is half-cooked, take it out of the pan and in  the fat that remains behind fry some very finely-sliced onions till they  are brown. When the onions are well browned, put them in a large pot,  large enough for all the potatoes you wish to cook, adding pepper, salt,  and a coffee-spoonful of sweet herbs dried and mixed, which in England  replace the thyme and bay-leaves used in Belgium. Add sufficient water  to cook the potatoes and your slices of bacon. Cook till tender.    [_E. Wainard_.]          TOMATOES AND SHRIMPS    Lay on a dish some sliced tomatoes, taking out the seeds, and sprinkle  them over with picked shrimps. Then pour over all a good mayonnaise  sauce. For the sauce: Take the yolk of an egg and mix it with two  soup-spoonfuls of salad oil that you must pass in very gently and very  little at a time. Melt a good pinch of salt in a teaspoonful of vinegar  (tarragon vinegar, if you have it); add pepper and a small quantity of  made mustard. In making this sauce be sure to stir it always the same  way. It will take about half-an-hour to make it properly.    [_Paquerette_.]          FLEMISH ENDIVE    Choose twelve endives that are short and neat; cut off the outside  leaves and pare the bottom; wash them in plenty of water, and cook them  in simmering water for three minutes. Then take them from the water and  place them in a well-buttered frying-pan, dust them with salt and also  with a pinch of sugar. Add the juice of half a lemon, and rather less  than a pint of water. Place the pan on the fire for two or three minutes  to start the cooking, then cover it closely, and finish the cooking by  placing it in the oven for fifty minutes. Take out the endives and put  them in the vegetable-dish and pour over them the liquor in which they  have been cooked. This liquor is improved by being reduced, and when off  the fire, by having a small piece of butter added to it.    The above recipe can be used for chicory as well as for endive.    [_J. Kirckaert_.]          CAULIFLOWER AND SHRIMPS    Take a cauliflower and cut off the green part, and wash it several times  in salted water. Boil it gently till cooked, taking care that it remains  whole. Put it aside to cool, and when it is quite cold make a hole in  the center down to the bottom. Pick some shrimps till you have half a  pint of them, make a good mayonnaise and, taking half of it, mix it  with the shrimps. Fill the hole in the cauliflower with the shrimps and  sauce, and pour the rest of the sauce over the top of the cauliflower.    This dish is to be served very cold.    [_E. Defouck_.]          BELGIAN CARROTS    Clean well the carrots, cut them in dice, and wash them well. Put them  on the fire with enough water to cover them, a bit of butter, an onion  well minced, salt and pepper and a dessert-spoonful of powdered sugar.  Place the dish in the oven for at least an hour, and, when you serve it,  sprinkle over the carrots some minced parsley.    [_Gabrielle Janssens_.]          STUFFED TOMATOES    Take ten good tomatoes and cut off the tops, which are to serve as lids.  Remove the insides, and fill with the following mixture: minced veal  and ham, rather more veal than ham, mushrooms tossed in butter, a little  breadcrumb, milk to render it moist, pepper and salt. Put on the covers  and add on each one a scrap of butter. Bake them gently in a fireproof  dish. The following excellent sauce is poured over them five minutes  before taking them out of the oven: Use any stock that you have,  preferably veal, adding the insides of the tomatoes, pepper and salt;  pass this through the wire sieve. Make a _roux_--that is, melt some  butter in a pan, adding flour little by little and stirring until it  goes a brown color. Add to it then your tomatoes that have been through  the sieve, and some more fried mushrooms. Pour this sauce over the whole  and serve very hot.    [_Mme. van Praet_.]          RED CABBAGE    Mince the cabbage and put it in a pan with plenty of refined fat  (clarified fat) and two or three large potatoes, pepper and salt.  Add sufficient water to cover it, with a dash of vinegar and six  dessert-spoonfuls of brown or moist sugar. Let it simmer for four hours,  drain it and serve cold.    [_Mme. Segers_.]          VEGETABLE SALAD    The special point of this dish is that peas, beans, carrots in dice, are  all cooked separately and when they are cold they are placed in a large  dish without being mixed. Decorate with the hearts of lettuce round the  edge and with slices of tomato, and pour over it, or hand with it, a  good mayonnaise.    [_Mme. van Praet_.]          CHICORY    This excellent vegetable can be dressed either in a bechamel sauce, or  with butter and lemon-juice. It is gently stewed, first of all, and it  requires pepper and salt. The sauces can be varied with tomato, or with  some of the good English bottled sauces stirred with the bechamel.    [_Mme. van Praet_.]          CAULIFLOWER A LA REINE ELIZABETH    Simmer the cauliflowers till tender. Prepare a mince of veal and pork,  and season it well with a little spice. Butter a mold and fill it with  alternate layers of mince and of cauliflower broken in small pieces.  Fill a large saucepan three-quarters full of boiling water and place the  mold in this; let it cook for one hour in this way over the fire; turn  it out and pour a spinach sauce over it.    [_Mme. van Praet_.]          MUSHROOMS A LA SPINETTE    Make some puff pastry cases, wash and chop the mushrooms and toss them  in butter to which you have added a slice of lemon. Make a bechamel  sauce with cream, or, failing that, with thick tinned cream, and mix  with the mushrooms. Heat the cases for a few minutes in the oven and  fill them with the hot mixture.    [_Mme. Spinette_.]          DRESSED CAULIFLOWER    Simmer a cauliflower till it is tender. Pour out the liquor, and add  to it a bit of butter, the size of a nut, rolled in flour, a pinch of  nutmeg, a tablespoonful of Gruyere cheese and a little milk.    Bind the sauce with a little feculina flour. At the moment of serving,  pour the sauce over the cauliflower, which you have placed upright on a  dish. The nutmeg and the cheese are indispensable to this dish.    [_V. Verachtert_.]          BRUSSELS SPROUTS    (The best way to cook them)    Having cleaned and trimmed your sprouts, let them simmer in salted  water, to which you have also added a little soda to preserve the color.  Or, if you do not like to add soda, keep the pan firmly covered by  the lid. When tender, take them out and let them drain, place them in  another pan with a good lump of butter or fat; stir, so as to let the  butter melt at once, and sprinkle in pepper and a tiny pinch of nutmeg.    [_Mdlle. Germaine Verstraete_.]          RAGOUT OF MUTTON    Fry the mutton very well. Then place in another pan sufficient water to  cover your mutton, adding pepper, salt, a little nutmeg, a celery, and a  few white turnips cut in pieces. When they are well cooked, add the meat  and let all simmer for two hours.    [_V. Verachtert_.]          STEWED SHOULDER OF MUTTON    Put in a pan a large lump of butter or clarified fat, and place the  shoulder in it. Add two big onions sliced, and a very large carrot also  sliced, thyme, bay-leaf, two cloves, pepper and salt, and, if you like  it, two garlic knobs. Let the shoulder simmer in this by the side of the  fire for three hours. Strain the sauce through a fine sieve, and then  add to it either a glass of good red wine or a little made mustard with  a teaspoonful of brown sugar.    [_Mme. Segers_.]          SHOULDER OF MUTTON    Put a handful of dried white haricots to soak over-night and simmer them  the following day for two hours with some salt. Rub your shoulder of  mutton with a little bit of garlic before putting it in the oven to  cook, and when it is done, serve with the haricots round it, to which  have been added a pat or two of butter.    [_V. Verachtert_.]          MUTTON COLLOPS    Take some slices of roast or boiled leg of mutton, egg them, and roll  in a mixture of breadcrumbs, salt, pepper, and a little flower. Fry till  the slices are brown on each side; serve with chipped potatoes.          SHOULDER OF MUTTON DRESSED LIKE KID    My readers have probably tasted a shoulder of kid dressed as mutton. Let  them therefore try the converse of the dish, and, if they really take  trouble with it, they will have a dinner of the most delicious. Put  into a deep dish that will hold your shoulder of mutton the following  mixture:    A cupful each of oil, vinegar, white wine, red wine, an onion stuffed  with cloves, a bunch of herbs which must be fresh ones--thyme, parsley,  marjoram, sage, a tiny bit of mint, a few bay-leaves--two medium carrots  cut in slices. Put the shoulder of mutton in this mixture and keep  it there for four days, turning it every now and then and pouring the  mixture on it. On the fifth day take it out, and, if you care to take  the trouble, you will improve it by larding the meat here and there.

[12] In order to meet this difficulty we must recognize two sorts of  species. The systematic species are the practical units of the  systematists and florists, and all friends of wild nature should do  their utmost to preserve them as Linnaeus has proposed them. These units  however, are not really existing entities; they have as little claim to  be regarded as such as genera and families. The real units are the  elementary species; their limits often apparently overlap and can only  in rare cases be determined on the sole ground of field observations.  Pedigree-culture is the method required and any form which remains  constant and distinct from its allies in the garden is to be considered  as an elementary species.    In the following lectures we shall consider this point at length, to  show the compound nature of systematic species in wild and in cultivated  plants. In both cases, the principle is becoming of great importance,  and many papers published recently indicate its almost universal  acceptation.    Among the systematic subdivisions of species, not all have the same  claim to the title of elementary species. In the first place the cases  in which the differences may occur between parts of the same individual  are to be excluded. Dividing an alpine plant into two halves and [13]  planting one in a garden, varietal differences at once arise and are  often designated in systematic works under different varietal names.  Secondly all individual differences which are of a fluctuating nature  are to be combined into a group. But with these we shall deal later.    Apart from these minor points the subdivisions of the systematic species  exhibit two widely different features. I will now try to make this clear  in a few words, but will return in another lecture to a fuller  discussion of this most interesting contrast.    Linnaeus himself knew that in some cases all subdivisions of a species  are of equal rank, together constituting the group called species. No  one of them outranks the others; it is not a species with varieties, but  a group, consisting only of varieties. A closer inquiry into the cases  treated in this manner by the great master of systematic science, shows  that here his varieties were exactly what we now call elementary  species.    In other cases the varieties are of a derivative nature. The species  constitutes a type that is pure in a race which ordinarily is still  growing somewhere, though in some cases it may have died out. From this  type the varieties are derived, and the way of this derivation is  usually quite manifest to the botanist. It is ordinarily [14] by the  disappearance of some superficial character that a variety is  distinguished from its species, as by the lack of color in the flowers,  of hairs on stems and foliage, of the spines and thorns, &c. Such  varieties are, strictly speaking, not to be treated in the same way as  elementary species, though they often are. We shall designate them by  the term of \"retrograde varieties,\" which clearly indicates the nature  of their relationship to the species from which they are assumed to have  sprung. In order to lay more stress on the contrast between elementary  species and retrograde varieties, it should be stated at once, that the  first are considered to have originated from their parent-form in a  progressive way. They have succeeded in attaining something quite new  for themselves, while retrograde varieties have only thrown off some  peculiarity, previously acquired by their ancestors.    The whole vegetable kingdom exhibits a constant struggle between  progression and retrogression. Of course, the great lines of the general  pedigree are due to progression, many single steps in this direction  leading together to the great superiority of the flowering plants over  their cryptogamous ancestors. But progression is nearly always  accompanied by retrogression in the principal lines of evolution, [15]  as well as in the collateral branches of the genealogical tree.  Sometimes it prevails, and the monocotyledons are obviously a reduced  branch of the primitive dicotyledons. In orchids and aroids, in grasses  and sedges, reduction plays a most important part, leaving its traces on  the flowers as well as on the embryo of the seed. Many instances could  be given to prove that progression and retrogression are the two main  principles of evolution at large. Hence the conclusion, that our  analysis must dissect the complicated phenomena of evolution so far as  to show the separate functions of these two contrasting principles.  Hundreds of steps were needed to evolve the family of the orchids, but  the experimenter must take the single steps for the object of his  inquiry. He finds that some are progressive and others retrogressive and  so his investigation falls under two heads, the origin of progressive  characters, and the subsequent loss of the same. Progressive steps are  the marks of elementary species, while retrograde varieties are  distinguished by apparent losses. They have equal claim to our interest  and our study.    As already stated I propose to deal first with the elementary species  and afterwards with the retrograde varieties. I shall try to depict them  to you in the first place as they are seen in [16] nature and in  culture, leaving the question of their origin to a subsequent  experimental treatment.    The question of the experimental origin of new species and varieties has  to be taken up from two widely separated starting points. This may be  inferred from what we have already seen concerning the two opposing  theories, derived and isolated from Darwin's original broad conception.  One of them considers mutations as the origin of new forms, while the  other assumes fluctuations to be the source of all evolution.    As mentioned above, my own experience has led me to accept the first  view. Therefore I shall have to show that mutations do yield new and  constant forms, while fluctuations are not adequate to do so. Retrograde  varieties and elementary species may both be seen to be produced by  sudden mutations. Varieties have often been observed to appear at once  and quite unexpectedly in horticulture and agriculture, and a survey of  these historical facts will be the subject of one of my lectures. In  some instances I have succeeded in repeating these observations in my  garden under the strict conditions of a scientific experiment, and these  instances teach us the real nature of the process of mutation in all its  visible features. New elementary [17] species are far more rare, but I  have discovered in the great evening-primrose, or _Oenothera  lamarckiana_ a strain which is producing them yearly in the wild state  as well as in my garden. These observations and pedigree-experiments  will be dealt with at due length in subsequent lectures.    Having proved the existence and importance of mutations, it remains to  inquire how far the improvements may go which are due only to  fluctuating variability. As the term indicates, this variability is  fluctuating to and fro, oscillating around an average type. It never  fails nor does it, under ordinary circumstances, depart far from the  fixed average.    But the deviation may be enlarged by a choice of extremes. In sowing  their seed, the average of the strain is seen to be changed, and in  repeating the experiment the change may be considerable. It is not  clear, whether theoretically by such an accumulation, deviations might  be reached which could not be attained at once in a single sowing. This  question is hardly susceptible of an experimental answer, as it would  require such an enormous amount of seed from a few mother plants as can  scarcely ever be produced.    The whole character of the fluctuations shows them to be of an opposite  nature, contrasting [18] manifestly with specific and varietal  characters. By this method they may be proved to be inadequate ever to  make a single step along the great lines of evolution, in regard to  progressive as well as to retrograde development.    First of all fluctuations are linear, amplifying or lessening the  existing qualities, but not really changing their nature. They are not  observed to produce anything quite new, and evolution of course, is not  restricted to the increase of the already existing peculiarities, but  depends chiefly on the continuous addition of new characters to the  stock. Fluctuations always oscillate around an average, and if removed  from this for some time, they show a tendency to return to it. This  tendency, called retrogression, has never been observed to fail, as it  should, in order to free the new strain from the links with the average,  while new species and new varieties are seen to be quite free from their  ancestors and not linked to them by intermediates.    The last few lectures will be devoted to questions concerning the great  problem of the analogy between natural and artificial selection. As  already stated, Darwin made this analogy the foundation stone of his  theory of descent, and he met with the severest objections and  criticisms precisely on this point. But I hope to [19] show that he was  quite right, and that the cause of the divergence of opinions is due  simply to the very incomplete state of knowledge concerning both  processes. If both are critically analyzed they may be seen to comprise  the same factors, and further discussion may be limited to the  appreciation of the part which each of them has played in nature and  among cultivated plants.    Both natural and artificial selection are partly specific, and partly  intra-specific or individual. Nature of course, and intelligent men  first chose the best elementary species from among the swarms. In"]]]
