If the people of  Boston must fight for their liberty, we will help them.\"  These men were not afraid of the king's soldiers. Some of them camped  in Charlestown, [Footnote: Charles'town.] a village near Boston. From  the hills of Charlestown they could watch and see what the king's  soldiers were doing.    They wished to be ready to defend themselves, if the soldiers should  try to do them harm. For this reason they had bought some powder and  stored it at Concord,[Footnote: Concord (_pro_. kong'krd).] nearly  twenty miles away.    When the king's soldiers heard about this powder, they made up their  minds to go out and get it for themselves.    Among the watchers at Charlestown was a brave young man named Paul  Revere. He was ready to serve his country in any way that he could.    One day a friend of his who lived in Boston came to see him. He came  very quietly and secretly, to escape the soldiers.    \"I have something to tell you,\" he said. \"Some of the king's soldiers  are going to Concord to get the powder that is there. They are getting  ready to start this very night.\"    \"Indeed!\" said Paul Revere. \"They shall get no powder, if I can help  it. I will stir up all the farmers between here and Concord, and those  fellows will have a hot time of it. But you must help me.\"    \"I will do all that I can,\" said his friend.    \"Well, then,\" said Paul Revere, \"you must go back to Boston and watch.  Watch, and as soon as the soldiers are ready to start, hang a lantern  in the tower of the old North Church. If they are to cross the river,  hang two. I will be here, ready. As soon as I see the light, I will  mount my horse and ride out to give the alarm.\"    And so it was done.    When night came, Paul Revere was at the riverside with his horse. He  looked over toward Boston. He knew where the old North Church stood,  but he could not see much in the darkness.    Hour after hour he stood and watched. The town seemed very still; but  now and then he could hear the beating of a drum or the shouting of  some soldier.    The moon rose, and by its light he could see the dim form of the church  tower, far away. He heard the clock strike ten. He waited and watched.    The clock struck eleven. He was beginning to feel tired. Perhaps the  soldiers had given up their plan.    He walked up and down the river bank, leading his horse behind him;  but he kept his eyes turned always toward the dim, dark spot which he  knew was the old North Church.    All at once a light flashed out from the tower. \"Ah! there it is!\" he  cried. The soldiers had started.    He spoke to his horse. He put his foot in the stirrup. He was ready  to mount.    Then another light flashed clear and bright by the side of the first  one. The soldiers would cross the river.    Paul Revere sprang into the saddle. Like a bird let loose, his horse  leaped forward. Away they went.    Away they went through the village street and out upon the country  road. \"Up! up!\" shouted Paul Revere. \"The soldiers are coming! Up! up!  and defend yourselves!\"    [Illustration]    The cry awoke the farmers; they sprang from their beds and looked out.  They could not see the speeding horse, but they heard the clatter of  its hoofs far down the road, and they understood the cry, \"Up! up! and  defend yourselves!\"    \"It is the alarm! The redcoats are coming,\" they said to each other.  Then they took their guns, their axes, anything they could find, and  hurried out.    So, through the night, Paul Revere rode toward Concord. At every  farmhouse and every village he repeated his call.    The alarm quickly spread. Guns were fired. Bells were rung. The people  for miles around were roused as though a fire were raging.    The king's soldiers were surprised to find everybody awake along the  road. They were angry because their plans had been discovered.    When they reached Concord, they burned the courthouse there.    At Lexington, not far from Concord, there was a sharp fight in which  several men were killed. This, in history, is called the Battle of  Lexington. It was the beginning of the war called the Revolutionary  War. But the king's soldiers did not find the gunpowder. They were  glad enough to march back without it. All along the road the farmers  were waiting for them. It seemed as if every man in the country was  after them. And they did not feel themselves safe until they were once  more in Boston.          THE BOY AND THE WOLF        In France there once lived a famous man who was known as the Marquis  de Lafayette. [Footnote: Mar'quis de La fa yette'.] When he was a  little boy his mother called him Gilbert.    Gilbert de Lafayette's father and grandfather and great-grandfather  had all been brave and noble men. He was very proud to think of this,  and he wished that he might grow up to be like them.    His home was in the country not far from a great forest. Often, when  he was a little lad, he took long walks among the trees with his  mother.    \"Mother,\" he would say, \"do not be afraid. I am with you, and I will  not let anything hurt you.\"    One day word came that a savage wolf had been seen in the forest. Men  said that it was a very large wolf and that it had killed some of the  farmers' sheep.    \"How I should like to meet that wolf,\" said little Gilbert.    He was only seven years old, but now all his thoughts were about the  savage beast that was in the forest.    \"Shall we take a walk this morning?\" asked his mother.    \"Oh, yes!\" said Gilbert. \"Perhaps we may see that wolf among the trees.  But don't be afraid.\"    His mother smiled, for she felt quite sure that there was no danger.    They did not go far into the woods. The mother sat down in the shade  of a tree and began to read in a new book which she had bought the day  before. The boy played on the grass near by.    The sun was warm. The bees were buzzing among the flowers. The small  birds were singing softly. Gilbert looked up from his play and saw  that his mother was very deeply interested in her book.    \"Now for the wolf!\" he said to himself.    He walked quickly, but very quietly, down the pathway into the darker  woods. He looked eagerly around, but saw only a squirrel frisking among  the trees and a rabbit hopping across the road.    Soon he came to a wilder place. There the bushes were very close  together and the pathway came to an end. He pushed the bushes aside  and went a little farther. How still everything was!    He could see a green open space just beyond; and then the woods seemed  to be thicker and darker. \"This is just the place for that wolf,\" he  thought.    Then, all at once, he heard footsteps. Something was pushing its way  through the bushes. It was coming toward him.    \"It's the wolf, I'm sure! It will not see me till it comes very near.  Then I will jump out and throw my arms around its neck and choke it  to death.\"    The animal was coming nearer. He could hear its footsteps. He could  hear its heavy breathing. He stood very still and waited.    \"It will try to bite me,\" he thought. \"Perhaps it will scratch me with  its sharp claws. But I will be brave. I will not cry out. I will choke  it with my strong arms. Then I will drag it out of the bushes and call  mamma to come and see it.\"    The beast was very close to him now. He could see its shadow as he  peeped out through the clusters of leaves. His breath came fast. He  planted his feet firmly and made ready to spring.    \"How proud mamma will be of her brave boy!\"    Ah! there was the wolf! He saw its shaggy head and big round eyes. He  leaped from his hiding place and clasped it round its neck.    It did not try to bite or scratch. It did not even growl. But it jumped  quickly forward and threw Gilbert upon the ground. Then it ran out  into the open space and stopped to gaze at him.    Gilbert was soon on his feet again. He was not hurt at all. He looked  at the beast, and--what do you think it was?    [Illustration]    It was not a wolf. It was only a pet calf that had come there to browse  among the bushes.    The boy felt very much ashamed. He hurried back to the pathway, and  then ran to his mother. Tears were in his eyes; but he tried to look  brave. \"O Gilbert, where have you been?\" said his mother.    Then he told her all that had happened. His lips quivered and he began  to cry.    \"Never mind, my dear,\" said his mother. \"You were very brave, and it  is lucky that the wolf was not there. You faced what you thought was  a great danger, and you were not afraid. You are my hero.\"    When the American people were fighting to free themselves from the  rule of the king of England, the Marquis de Lafayette helped them with  men and money. He was the friend of Washington. His name is remembered  in our country as that of a brave and noble man.          ANOTHER WOLF STORY    I        \"WOLF! Wolf! Wolf!\"    Three farmers were walking across a field and looking eagerly for  tracks in the soft ground. One carried a gun, one had a pitchfork, and  the third had an ax.    \"Wolf! Wolf! Wolf!\" they cried, as they met another farmer coming over  the hill.    \"Where? where?\" he asked.    \"We don't know,\" was the answer, \"but we saw her tracks down there by  the brook. It's the same old wolf that has been skulking around here  all winter.\"    \"She killed three of my lambs last night,\" said the one whose name was  David Brown.    \"She's killed as many as twenty since the winter began,\" said Thomas  Tanner.    \"How do you know that it is only one beast that does all this  mischief?\" asked the fourth farmer, whose name was Israel Putnam.    \"Because the tracks are always the same,\" answered David Brown. \"They  show that three toes have been lost from the left forefoot.\"    \"She's been caught in a trap some time, I guess,\" said Putnam.    \"Samuel Stark saw her the other morning,\" said Tanner. \"He says she  was a monster; and she was running straight toward the hills with a  little lamb"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/62"],[0,"A Princess of Mars (#4)"],[1,"me that the noises  I had heard must have resulted from purely natural and harmless causes;  probably the conformation of the cave was such that a slight breeze had  caused the sounds I heard.    I decided to investigate, but first I lifted my head to fill my lungs  with the pure, invigorating night air of the mountains.  As I did so I  saw stretching far below me the beautiful vista of rocky gorge, and  level, cacti-studded flat, wrought by the moonlight into a miracle of  soft splendor and wondrous enchantment.    Few western wonders are more inspiring than the beauties of an Arizona  moonlit landscape; the silvered mountains in the distance, the strange  lights and shadows upon hog back and arroyo, and the grotesque details  of the stiff, yet beautiful cacti form a picture at once enchanting and  inspiring; as though one were catching for the first time a glimpse of  some dead and forgotten world, so different is it from the aspect of  any other spot upon our earth.    As I stood thus meditating, I turned my gaze from the landscape to the  heavens where the myriad stars formed a gorgeous and fitting canopy for  the wonders of the earthly scene.  My attention was quickly riveted by  a large red star close to the distant horizon.  As I gazed upon it I  felt a spell of overpowering fascination--it was Mars, the god of war,  and for me, the fighting man, it had always held the power of  irresistible enchantment.  As I gazed at it on that far-gone night it  seemed to call across the unthinkable void, to lure me to it, to draw  me as the lodestone attracts a particle of iron.    My longing was beyond the power of opposition; I closed my eyes,  stretched out my arms toward the god of my vocation and felt myself  drawn with the suddenness of thought through the trackless immensity of  space.  There was an instant of extreme cold and utter darkness.          CHAPTER III    MY ADVENT ON MARS      I opened my eyes upon a strange and weird landscape.  I knew that I was  on Mars; not once did I question either my sanity or my wakefulness.  I  was not asleep, no need for pinching here; my inner consciousness told  me as plainly that I was upon Mars as your conscious mind tells you  that you are upon Earth.  You do not question the fact; neither did I.    I found myself lying prone upon a bed of yellowish, mosslike vegetation  which stretched around me in all directions for interminable miles.  I  seemed to be lying in a deep, circular basin, along the outer verge of  which I could distinguish the irregularities of low hills.    It was midday, the sun was shining full upon me and the heat of it was  rather intense upon my naked body, yet no greater than would have been  true under similar conditions on an Arizona desert.  Here and there  were slight outcroppings of quartz-bearing rock which glistened in the  sunlight; and a little to my left, perhaps a hundred yards, appeared a  low, walled enclosure about four feet in height.  No water, and no  other vegetation than the moss was in evidence, and as I was somewhat  thirsty I determined to do a little exploring.    Springing to my feet I received my first Martian surprise, for the  effort, which on Earth would have brought me standing upright, carried  me into the Martian air to the height of about three yards.  I alighted  softly upon the ground, however, without appreciable shock or jar.  Now  commenced a series of evolutions which even then seemed ludicrous in  the extreme.  I found that I must learn to walk all over again, as the  muscular exertion which carried me easily and safely upon Earth played  strange antics with me upon Mars.    Instead of progressing in a sane and dignified manner, my attempts to  walk resulted in a variety of hops which took me clear of the ground a  couple of feet at each step and landed me sprawling upon my face or  back at the end of each second or third hop.  My muscles, perfectly  attuned and accustomed to the force of gravity on Earth, played the  mischief with me in attempting for the first time to cope with the  lesser gravitation and lower air pressure on Mars.    I was determined, however, to explore the low structure which was the  only evidence of habitation in sight, and so I hit upon the unique plan  of reverting to first principles in locomotion, creeping.  I did fairly  well at this and in a few moments had reached the low, encircling wall  of the enclosure.    There appeared to be no doors or windows upon the side nearest me, but  as the wall was but about four feet high I cautiously gained my feet  and peered over the top upon the strangest sight it had ever been given  me to see.    The roof of the enclosure was of solid glass about four or five inches  in thickness, and beneath this were several hundred large eggs,  perfectly round and snowy white.  The eggs were nearly uniform in size  being about two and one-half feet in diameter.    Five or six had already hatched and the grotesque caricatures which sat  blinking in the sunlight were enough to cause me to doubt my sanity.  They seemed mostly head, with little scrawny bodies, long necks and six  legs, or, as I afterward learned, two legs and two arms, with an  intermediary pair of limbs which could be used at will either as arms  or legs.  Their eyes were set at the extreme sides of their heads a  trifle above the center and protruded in such a manner that they could  be directed either forward or back and also independently of each  other, thus permitting this queer animal to look in any direction, or  in two directions at once, without the necessity of turning the head.    The ears, which were slightly above the eyes and closer together, were  small, cup-shaped antennae, protruding not more than an inch on these  young specimens.  Their noses were but longitudinal slits in the center  of their faces, midway between their mouths and ears.    There was no hair on their bodies, which were of a very light  yellowish-green color.  In the adults, as I was to learn quite soon,  this color deepens to an olive green and is darker in the male than in  the female.  Further, the heads of the adults are not so out of  proportion to their bodies as in the case of the young.    The iris of the eyes is blood red, as in Albinos, while the pupil is  dark.  The eyeball itself is very white, as are the teeth.  These  latter add a most ferocious appearance to an otherwise fearsome and  terrible countenance, as the lower tusks curve upward to sharp points  which end about where the eyes of earthly human beings are located.  The whiteness of the teeth is not that of ivory, but of the snowiest  and most gleaming of china.  Against the dark background of their olive  skins their tusks stand out in a most striking manner, making these  weapons present a singularly formidable appearance.    Most of these details I noted later, for I was given but little time to  speculate on the wonders of my new discovery.  I had seen that the eggs  were in the process of hatching, and as I stood watching the hideous  little monsters break from their shells I failed to note the approach  of a score of full-grown Martians from behind me.    Coming, as they did, over the soft and soundless moss, which covers  practically the entire surface of Mars with the exception of the frozen  areas at the poles and the scattered cultivated districts, they might  have captured me easily, but their intentions were far more sinister.  It was the rattling of the accouterments of the foremost warrior which  warned me.    On such a little thing my life hung that I often marvel that I escaped  so easily.  Had not the rifle of the leader of the party swung from its  fastenings beside his saddle in such a way as to strike against the  butt of his great metal-shod spear I should have snuffed out without  ever knowing that death was near me.  But the little sound caused me to  turn, and there upon me, not ten feet from my breast, was the point of  that huge spear, a spear forty feet long, tipped with gleaming metal,  and held low at the side of a mounted replica of the little devils I  had been watching.    But how puny and harmless they now looked beside this huge and terrific  incarnation of hate, of vengeance and of death.  The man himself, for  such I may call him, was fully fifteen feet in height and, on Earth,  would have weighed some four hundred pounds.  He sat his mount as we  sit a horse, grasping the animal's barrel with his lower limbs, while  the hands of his two right arms held his immense spear low at the side  of his mount; his two left arms were outstretched laterally to help  preserve his balance, the thing he rode having neither bridle or reins  of any description for guidance.    And his mount!  How can earthly words describe it!  It towered ten feet  at the shoulder; had four legs on either side; a broad flat tail,  larger at the tip than at the root, and which it held straight out  behind while running; a gaping mouth which split its head from its  snout to its long, massive neck.    Like its master, it was entirely devoid of hair, but was of a dark  slate color and exceeding smooth and glossy.  Its belly was white, and  its legs shaded from the slate of its shoulders and hips to a vivid  yellow at the feet.  The feet themselves were heavily padded and  nailless, which fact had also contributed to the noiselessness of their  approach, and, in common with a multiplicity of legs, is a  characteristic feature of the fauna of Mars.  The highest type of man  and one other animal, the only mammal existing on Mars, alone have  well-formed nails, and there are absolutely no hoofed animals in  existence there.    Behind this first charging demon trailed nineteen others, similar in  all respects, but, as I learned later, bearing individual  characteristics peculiar to themselves; precisely as no two of us are  identical although we are all cast in a similar mold.
