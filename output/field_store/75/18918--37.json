On the banks of the river we sat for  an hour while he plied me with questions, which I answered so far  as I could. He hung on my lips; he interrupted only when there seemed  a halt in the stream; he revelled in, all the details of wrecks  by rail and sea. Roosevelt and the trusts--insurance scandals--the  South the burnings in the West--massacres--murders--horrors--risings--these  were his special gloats, and yet he kept me going with \"Yes--yes--and  then?\" or \"Yes, by golly--that's the way we're a-doing it. Go on.\"    Then, after I had robbed New York of $100,000,000 a year, burnt 10  large towns and 45 small ones, wrecked 200 express trains, lynched  96 negroes in the South and murdered many men every night for 7  years in Chicago--he broke out:    \"By golly, we are a-doing it. We are the people. We are a-moving  things now; and I tell you I give the worst of them there European  countries, the very worst of 'em, just 100 years to become  Americanised.\"    Think of that, ye polished Frenchmen; ye refined, courteous Swedes;  ye civilised Danes; you have 100 years to become truly Americanised!    All down the river route we came on relics of another class of  wanderers--the Klondikers of 1898. Sometimes these were empty winter  cabins; sometimes curious tools left at Hudson's Bay Posts, and in  some cases expensive provisions; in all cases we heard weird tales  of their madness.    There is, I am told, a shanty on the Mackenzie above Simpson, where  four of them made a strange record. Cooped up for months in tight  winter quarters, they soon quarrelled, and at length their partnership  was dissolved. Each took the articles he had contributed, and those  of common purchase they divided in four equal parts. The stove, the  canoe, the lamp, the spade, were broken relentlessly and savagely  into four parts--four piles of useless rubbish. The shanty was  divided in four. One man had some candles of his own bringing.  These he kept and carefully screened off his corner of the room so  no chance rays might reach the others to comfort them; they spent  the winter in darkness. None spoke to the other, and they parted,  singly and silently, hatefully as ever, as soon as the springtime  opened the way.          CHAPTER IV    DOWN THE SILENT RIVER WITH THE MOUNTED POLICE        At Fort MacMurray we learned that there was no telling when the  steamer might arrive; Major Jarvis was under orders to proceed  without delay to Smith Landing; so to solve all our difficulties  I bought a 30-foot boat (sturgeon-head) of Joe Bird, and arranged  to join forces with the police for the next part of the journey.    I had made several unsuccessful attempts to get an experienced native  boatman to go northward with me. All seemed to fear the intending  plunge into the unknown; so was agreeably surprised when a sturdy  young fellow of Scottish and Cree parentage came and volunteered  for the trip. A few inquiries proved him to bear a good reputation  as a river-man and worker, so William C. Loutit was added to my  expedition and served me faithfully throughout.    In time I learned that Billy was a famous traveller. Some years  ago, when the flood had severed all communication between Athabaska  Landing and Edmonton, Billy volunteered to carry some important  despatches, and covered the 96 miles on foot in one and a half days,  although much of the road was under water. On another occasion he  went alone and afoot from House River up the Athabaska to Calling  River, and across the Point to the Athabaska again, then up to the  Landing-150 rough miles in four days. These exploits I had to find  out for myself later on, but much more important to me at the time  was the fact that he was a first-class cook, a steady, cheerful  worker, and a capable guide as far as Great Slave Lake.    The Athabaska below Fort MacMurray is a noble stream, one-third  of a mile wide, deep, steady, unmarred; the banks are covered with  unbroken virginal forests of tall white poplar, balsam poplar,  spruce, and birch. The fire has done no damage here as yet, the  axe has left no trace, there are no houses, no sign of man except  occasional teepee poles. I could fancy myself floating down the  Ohio two hundred years ago.    These were bright days to be remembered, as we drifted down  its placid tide in our ample and comfortable boat, with abundance  of good things. Calm, lovely, spring weather; ducks all along the  river; plenty of food, which is the northerner's idea of bliss;  plenty of water, which is the river-man's notion of joy; plenty  of leisure, which is an element in most men's heaven, for we had  merely to float with the stream, three miles an hour, except when  we landed to eat or sleep.    The woods were donning their vernal green and resounded with the  calls of birds now. The mosquito plague of the region had not yet  appeared, and there was little lacking to crown with a halo the  memory of those days on the Missouri of the North.    Native quadrupeds seemed scarce, and we were all agog when one of  the men saw a black fox trotting along the opposite bank. However,  it turned out to be one of the many stray dogs of the country. He  followed us a mile or more, stopping at times to leap at fish that  showed near the shore. When we landed for lunch he swam the broad  stream and hung about at a distance. As this was twenty miles from  any settlement, he was doubtless hungry, so I left a bountiful  lunch for him, and when we moved away, he claimed his own.    At Fort McKay I saw a little half-breed boy shooting with a bow  and displaying extraordinary marksmanship. At sixty feet he could  hit the bottom of a tomato tin nearly every time; and even more  surprising was the fact that he held the arrow with what is known  as the Mediterranean hold. When, months later, I again stopped at  this place, I saw another boy doing the very same. Some residents  assured me that this was the style of all the Chipewyans as well  as the Crees.    That night we camped far down the river and on the side opposite  the Fort, for experience soon teaches one to give the dogs no  chance of entering camp on marauding expeditions while you rest.  About ten, as I was going to sleep, Preble put his head in and  said: \"Come out here if you want a new sensation.\"    In a moment I was standing with him under the tall spruce trees,  looking over the river to the dark forest, a quarter mile away,  and listening intently to a new and wonderful sound. Like the  slow tolling of a soft but high-pitched bell, it came. Ting, ting,  ting, ting, and on, rising and falling with the breeze, but still  keeping on about two \"tings\" to the second; and on, dulling as  with distance, but rising again and again.    It was unlike anything I had ever heard, but Preble knew it of old.  \"That\", says he, \"is the love-song of the Richardson Owl. She is  sitting demurely in some spruce top while he sails around, singing  on the wing, and when the sound seems distant, he is on the far  side of the tree.\"    Ting, ting, ting, ting, it went on and on, this soft belling  of his love, this amorous music of our northern bell-bird. .    Ting, TING, ting, ting, ting, TING, ting, ting, ting, ting, TING,  ting--oh, how could any lady owl resist such strains?--and on, with  its ting, ting, ting, TING, ting, ting, ting, TING, the whole night  air was vibrant. Then, as though by plan, a different note--the  deep booming \"Oho-oh-who-oh who hoo\" of the Great Homed Owl--was  heard singing a most appropriate bass.    But the little Owl went on and on; 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 20 minutes  at last had elapsed before I turned in again and left him. More  than once that night I awoke to hear his \"tinging\" serenade upon  the consecrated air of the piney woods.    Yet Preble said this one was an indifferent performer. On the  Mackenzie he had heard far better singers of the kind; some that  introduce many variations of the pitch and modulation. I thought  it one of the most charming bird voices I had ever listened to--and  felt that this was one of the things that make the journey worth  while.    On June 1 the weather was so blustering and wet that we did not  break camp. I put in the day examining the superb timber of this  bottom-land. White spruce is the prevailing conifer and is here  seen in perfection. A representative specimen was 118 feet high, 11  feet 2 inches in circumference, or 3 feet 6 1/2 inches in diameter  1 foot from the ground, i.e., above any root spread. There was  plenty of timber of similar height. Black spruce, a smaller kind,  and tamarack are found farther up and back in the bog country.  jackpine of fair size abounds on the sandy and gravelly parts.  Balsam poplar is the largest deciduous tree; its superb legions  in upright ranks are crowded along all the river banks and on the  islands not occupied by the spruce. The large trees of this kind  often have deep holes; these are the nesting sites of the Whistler  Duck, which is found in numbers here and as far north as this tree,  but not farther. White poplar is plentiful also; the hillsides are  beautifully clad with its purplish masses of twigs, through which  its white stem gleam like marble columns. White birch is common  and large enough for canoes. Two or three species of willow in  impenetrable thickets make up the rest of the forest stretches.    At this camp I had the unique experience of showing all these seasoned  Westerners that it was possible to make a fire by the friction of  two sticks. This has long been a specialty of mine; I use a thong  and a bow as the simplest way. Ordinarily I prefer balsam-fir or  tamarack; in this case I used a balsam block and a spruce drill,  and, although each kind failed when used with drill and block the  same, I got the fire in half a minute.    On June 3 we left this camp of tall timber. As we floated down we  sighted a Lynx on the bank looking contemplatively into the flood."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6840"],[0,"Queen Lucia (#4)"],[1,"the meadow outside;  beyond that lay the stream which flowed into the Avon, and it often  seemed wonderful to her that the water which wimpled by would (unless a  cow happened to drink it) soon be stealing along past the church at  Stratford where Shakespeare lay. Peppino had written a very moving  little prose-poem about it, for she had royally presented him with the  idea, and had suggested a beautiful analogy between the earthly dew  that refreshed the grasses, and was drawn up into the fire of the Sun,  and Thought the spiritual dew that refreshed the mind and thereafter,  rather vaguely, was drawn up into the Full-Orbed Soul of the World.    At that moment Lucia's eye was attracted by an apparition on the road  which lay adjacent to the further side of the happy stream which flowed  into the Avon. There was no mistaking the identity of the stout figure  of Mrs Quantock with its short steps and its gesticulations, but why in  the name of wonder should that Christian Scientist be walking with the  draped and turbaned figure of a man with a tropical complexion and a  black beard? His robe of saffron yellow with a violently green girdle  was hitched up for ease in walking, and unless he had chocolate  coloured stockings on, Mrs Lucas saw human legs of the same shade. Next  moment that debatable point was set at rest for she caught sight of  short pink socks in red slippers. Even as she looked Mrs Quantock saw  her (for owing to Christian Science she had recaptured the quick vision  of youth) and waggled her hand and kissed it, and evidently called her  companion's attention, for the next moment he was salaaming to her in  some stately Oriental manner. There was nothing to be done for the  moment except return these salutations, as she could not yell an aside  to Mrs Quantock, screaming out \"Who is that Indian\"? for if Mrs  Quantock heard the Indian would hear too, but as soon as she could, she  turned back towards the house again, and when once the lilac bushes  were between her and the road she walked with more than her usual  speed, in order to learn with the shortest possible delay from Peppino  who this fresh subject of hers could be. She knew there were some  Indian princes in London; perhaps it was one of them, in which case it  would be necessary to read up Benares or Delhi in the Encyclopaedia  without loss of time.          Chapter TWO      As she traversed the smoking-parlour the cheerful sounds that had once  tinkled from the collar of a Flemish horse chimed through the house,  and simultaneously she became aware that there would be _macaroni au  gratin_ for lunch, which was very dear and remembering of Peppino.  But before setting fork to her piled-up plate, she had to question him,  for her mental craving for information was far keener than her appetite  for food.    \"_Caro_, who is an Indian,\" she said, \"whom I saw just now with  Daisy Quantock? They were the other side of il piccolo Avon.\"    Peppino had already begun his macaroni and must pause to shovel the  outlying strings of it into his mouth. But the haste with which he did  so was sufficient guaranty for his eagerness to reply as soon as it was  humanly possible to do so.    \"Indian, my dear?\" he asked with the greatest interest.    \"Yes; turban and burnous and calves and slippers,\" she said rather  impatiently, for what was the good of Peppino having remained in  Riseholme if he could not give her precise and certain information on  local news when she returned. His prose-poems were all very well, but  as prince-consort he had other duties of state which must not be  neglected for the calls of Art.    This slight asperity on her part seemed to sharpen his wits.    \"Really, I don't know for certain, Lucia,\" he said, \"for I have not set  my eyes on him. But putting two and two together, I might make a  guess.\"    \"Two and two make four,\" she said with that irony for which she was  feared and famous. \"Now for your guess. I hope it is equally accurate.\"    \"Well, as I told you in one of my letters,\" said he, \"Mrs Quantock  showed signs of being a little off with Christian Science. She had a  cold, and though she recited the True Statement of Being just as  frequently as before, her cold got no better. But when I saw her on  Tuesday last, unless it was Wednesday, no, it couldn't have been  Wednesday, so it must have been Tuesday--\"    \"Whenever it was then,\" interrupted his wife, brilliantly summing up  his indecision.    \"Yes; whenever it was, as you say, on that occasion Mrs Quantock was  very full of some Indian philosophy which made you quite well at once.  What did she call it now? Yoga! Yes, that was it!\"    \"And then?\" asked Lucia.    \"Well, it appears you must have a teacher in Yoga or else you may  injure yourself. You have to breathe deeply and say 'Om'----\"    \"Say what?\"    \"Om. I understand the ejaculation to be Om. And there are very curious  physical exercises; you have to hold your ear with one hand and your  toes with the other, and you may strain yourself unless you do it  properly. That was the general gist of it.\"    \"And shall we come to the Indian soon?\" said Lucia.    \"_Carissima_, you have come to him already. I suggest that Mrs  Quantock has applied for a teacher and got him. _Ecco!_\"    Mrs Lucas wore a heavily corrugated forehead at this news. Peppino had  a wonderful _flair_ in explaining unusual circumstances in the  life of Riseholme and his conjectures were generally correct. But if he  was right in this instance, it struck Lucia as being a very irregular  thing that anyone should have imported a mystical Indian into Riseholme  without consulting her. It is true that she had been away, but still  there was the medium of the post.    \"_Ecco_ indeed!\" she said. \"It puts me in rather a difficult  position, for I must send out my invitations to my garden-party today,  and I really don't know whether I ought to be officially aware of this  man's existence or not. I can't write to Daisy Quantock and say 'Pray  bring your black friend Om or whatever his name proves to be, and on  the other hand, if he is the sort of person whom one would be sorry to  miss, I should not like to have passed over him.\"    \"After all, my dear, you have only been back in Riseholme half an  hour,\" said her husband. \"It would have been difficult for Mrs  Quantock to have told you yet.\"    Her face cleared.    \"Perhaps Daisy has written to me about him,\" she said. \"I may find a  full account of it all when I open my letters.\"    \"Depend upon it you will. She would hardly have been so wanting in  proper feeling as not to have told you. I think, too, that her visitor  must only have just arrived, or I should have been sure to see him  about somewhere.\"    She rose.    \"Well, we will see,\" she said. \"Now I shall be very busy all afternoon,  but by tea-time I shall be ready to see anyone who calls. Give me my  letters, _Caro_, and I will find out if Daisy has written to me.\"    She turned them over as she went to her room, and there among them was  a bulky envelope addressed in Mrs Quantock's great sprawling hand,  which looked at first sight so large and legible, but on closer  examination turned out to be so baffling. You had to hold it at some  distance off to make anything out of it, and look at it in an abstracted  general manner much as you would look at a view. Treated thus, scattered  words began to leap into being, and when you had got a sufficiency of  these, like glimpses of the country seen by flashes of lightning, you  could hope to get a collective idea of it all. The procedure led to the  most promising results as Mrs Lucas sat with the sheets at arm's length,  occasionally altering the range to try the effect of a different focus.  \"Benares\" blinked at her, also \"Brahmin\"; also \"highest caste\";  \"extraordinary sanctity,\" and \"Guru.\" And when the meaning of this  latter was ascertained from the article on \"Yoga\" in her Encyclopaedia,  she progressed very swiftly towards a complete comprehension of the  letter.    When fully pieced together it was certainly enough to rivet her whole  attention, and make her leave unopened the rest of the correspondence,  for such a prelude to adventure had seldom sounded in Riseholme. It  appeared, even as her husband had told her at lunch, that Mrs Quantock  found her cold too obstinate for all the precepts of Mrs Eddy; the  True Statement of Being, however often repeated, only seemed to inflame  it further, and one day, when confined to the house, she had taken a  book \"quite at random\" from the shelves in her library, under, she  supposed, the influence of some interior compulsion. This then was  clearly a \"leading.\"    Mrs Lucas paused a moment as she pieced together these first sentences.  She seemed to remember that Mrs Quantock had experienced a similar  leading when first she took up Christian Science. It was a leading from  the sight of a new church off Sloane Street that day; Mrs Quantock had  entered (she scarcely knew why) and had found herself in a Testimony  Meeting, where witness after witness declared the miraculous healings  they had experienced. One had had a cough, another cancer, another a  fractured bone, but all had been cured by the blessed truths conveyed  in the Gospel according to Mrs Eddy. However, her memories on this  subject were not to the point now; she burned to arrive at the story of  the new leading.    Well, the book that Mrs Quantock had taken down in obedience to the  last leading proved to be a little handbook of Oriental Philosophies,  and it opened, \"all of its own accord,\" at a chapter called Yoga.  Instantly she perceived, as by the unclosing of an inward eye, that Yoga  was what she wanted and she instantly wrote to the address from which  this book was issued asking for any guidance on the subject. She had  read in \"Oriental Philosophies\" that for the successful practice of  Yoga, it was necessary to have a teacher, and did they know of any  teacher"]]]
