But there are charms to secure happiness as well as charms to  avert evil. In these I am a firm believer. I do not mean that I  believe that a horseshoe hung up in the house will bring me good  luck; I mean that if anybody does believe this, then the hanging  up of his horseshoe will probably bring him good luck. For if you  believe that you are going to be lucky, you go about your  business with a smile, you take disaster with a smile, you start  afresh with a smile. And to do that is to be in the way of  happiness.          The Charm of Golf      When he reads of the notable doings of famous golfers, the  eighteen-handicap man has no envy in his heart. For by this time  he has discovered the great secret of golf. Before he began to  play he wondered wherein lay the fascination of it; now he knows.  Golf is so popular simply because it is the best game in the  world at which to be bad.    Consider what it is to be bad at cricket. You have bought a new  bat, perfect in balance; a new pair of pads, white as driven  snow; gloves of the very latest design. Do they let you use them?  No. After one ball, in the negotiation of which neither your bat,  nor your pads, nor your gloves came into play, they send you back  into the pavilion to spend the rest of the afternoon listening to  fatuous stories of some old gentleman who knew Fuller Pilch. And  when your side takes the field, where are you? Probably at long  leg both ends, exposed to the public gaze as the worst fieldsman  in London. How devastating are your emotions. Remorse, anger,  mortification, fill your heart; above all, envy--envy of the  lucky immortals who disport themselves on the green level of  Lord's.    Consider what it is to be bad at lawn tennis. True, you are  allowed to hold on to your new racket all through the game, but  how often are you allowed to employ it usefully? How often does  your partner cry \"Mine!\" and bundle you out of the way? Is there  pleasure in playing football badly? You may spend the full eighty  minutes in your new boots, but your relations with the ball will  be distant. They do not give you a ball to yourself at football.    But how different a game is golf. At golf it is the bad player  who gets the most strokes. However good his opponent, the bad  player has the right to play out each hole to the end; he will  get more than his share of the game. He need have no fears that  his new driver will not be employed. He will have as many swings  with it as the scratch man; more, if he misses the ball  altogether upon one or two tees. If he buys a new niblick he is  certain to get fun out of it on the very first day.    And, above all, there is this to be said for golfing mediocrity--  the bad player can make the strokes of the good player. The poor  cricketer has perhaps never made fifty in his life; as soon as he  stands at the wickets he knows that he is not going to make fifty  to-day. But the eighteen-handicap man has some time or other  played every hole on the course to perfection. He has driven a  ball 250 yards; he has made superb approaches; he has run down  the long putt. Any of these things may suddenly happen to him  again. And therefore it is not his fate to have to sit in the  club smoking- room after his second round and listen to the  wonderful deeds of others. He can join in too. He can say with  perfect truth, \"I once carried the ditch at the fourth with my  second,\" or \"I remember when I drove into the bunker guarding the  eighth green,\" or even \"I did a three at the eleventh this  afternoon\"--bogey being five. But if the bad cricketer says, \"I  remember when I took a century in forty minutes off Lockwood and  Richardson,\" he is nothing but a liar.    For these and other reasons golf is the best game in the world  for the bad player. And sometimes I am tempted to go further and  say that it is a better game for the bad player than for the good  player. The joy of driving a ball straight after a week of  slicing, the joy of putting a mashie shot dead, the joy of even a  moderate stroke with a brassie; best of all, the joy of the  perfect cleek shot--these things the good player will never know.  Every stroke we bad players make we make in hope. It is never so  bad but it might have been worse; it is never so bad but we are  confident of doing better next time. And if the next stroke is  good, what happiness fills our soul. How eagerly we tell  ourselves that in a little while all our strokes will be as good.    What does Vardon know of this? If he does a five hole in four he  blames himself that he did not do it in three; if he does it in  five he is miserable. He will never experience that happy  surprise with which we hail our best strokes. Only his bad  strokes surprise him, and then we may suppose that he is not  happy. His length and accuracy are mechanical; they are not the  result, as so often in our case, of some suddenly applied maxim  or some suddenly discovered innovation. The only thing which can  vary in his game is his putting, and putting is not golf but  croquet.    But of course we, too, are going to be as good as Vardon one day.  We are only postponing the day because meanwhile it is so  pleasant to be bad. And it is part of the charm of being bad at  golf that in a moment, in a single night, we may become good. If  the bad cricketer said to a good cricketer, \"What am I doing  wrong?\" the only possible answer would be, \"Nothing particular,  except that you can't play cricket.\" But if you or I were to say  to our scratch friend, \"What am I doing wrong?\" he would reply at  once, \"Moving the head\" or \"Dropping the right knee\" or \"Not  getting the wrists in soon enough,\" and by to-morrow we should be  different players. Upon such a little depends, or seems to the  eighteen-handicap to depend, excellence in golf.    And so, perfectly happy in our present badness and perfectly  confident of our future goodness, we long-handicap men remain.  Perhaps it would be pleasanter to be a little more certain of  getting the ball safely off the first tee; perhaps at the  fourteenth hole, where there is a right of way and the public  encroach, we should like to feel that we have done with topping;  perhaps---    Well, perhaps we might get our handicap down to fifteen this  summer. But no lower; certainly no lower.          Goldfish      Let us talk about--well, anything you will. Goldfish, for  instance.    Goldfish are a symbol of old-world tranquillity or mid-Victorian  futility according to their position in the home. Outside the  home, in that wild state from which civilization has dragged  them, they may have stood for dare-devil courage or constancy or  devotion; I cannot tell. I may only speak of them now as I find  them, which is in the garden or in the drawing-room. In their  lily-leaved pool, sunk deep in the old flagged terrace, upon  whose borders the blackbird whistles his early-morning song, they  remind me of sundials and lavender and old delightful things. But  in their cheap glass bowl upon the three- legged table, above  which the cloth-covered canary maintains a stolid silence, they  remind me of antimacassars and horsehair sofas and all that is  depressing. It is hard that the goldfish himself should have so  little choice in the matter. Goldfish look pretty in the terrace  pond, yet I doubt if it was the need for prettiness which brought  them there. Rather the need for some thing to throw things to. No  one of the initiate can sit in front of Nature's most wonderful  effect, the sea, without wishing to throw stones into it, the  physical pleasure of the effort and the aesthetic pleasure of the  splash combining to produce perfect contentment. So by the margin  of the pool the same desires stir within one, and because ants'  eggs do not splash, and look untidy on the surface of the water,  there must be a gleam of gold and silver to put the crown upon  one's pleasure.    Perhaps when you have been feeding the goldfish you have not  thought of it like that. But at least you must have wondered why,  of all diets, they should prefer ants' eggs. Ants' eggs are, I  should say, the very last thing which one would take to without  argument. It must be an acquired taste, and, this being so, one  naturally asks oneself how goldfish came to acquire it.    I suppose (but I am lamentably ignorant on these as on all other  matters) that there was a time when goldfish lived a wild free  life of their own. They roamed the sea or the river, or whatever  it was, fighting for existence, and Nature showed them, as she  always does, the food which suited them. Now I have often come  across ants' nests in my travels, but never when swimming. In  seas and rivers, pools and lakes, I have wandered, but Nature has  never put ants' eggs in my way. No doubt--it would be only right-  -the goldfish has a keener eye than I have for these things, but  if they had been there, should I have missed them so completely?  I think not, for if they had been there, they must have been  there in great quantities. I can imagine a goldfish slowly  acquiring the taste for them through the centuries, but only if  other food were denied to him, only if, wherever he went, ants'  eggs, ants' eggs, ants' eggs drifted down the stream to him.    Yet, since it would seem that he has acquired the taste, it can  only be that the taste has come to him with captivity--has been  forced upon him, I should have said. The old wild goldfish (this  is my theory) was a more terrible beast than we think. Given his  proper diet, he could not have been kept within the limits of the  terrace pool. He would have been unsuited to domestic life; he  would have dragged in the shrieking child as she leant to feed  him. As the result of many experiments ants' eggs were given him  to keep him thin (you can see for yourself what a bloodless diet  it is), ants' eggs were given "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5805"],[0,"The League of the Scarlet Pimpernel (#4)"],[1,"awful thing lying there, helpless, in the water. There was also a  great relief to nerve-tension in shouting Horror and Anathema with  self-righteous indignation; and additional excitement in the suggested  \"aristo in disguise.\"    Mole struggled vigorously. He was powerful and his fists were heavy. But  he was soon surrounded, held fast by both arms, whilst half a dozen  hands tore at his tattered clothes, searched him to his very skin, for  the booty which he was thought to have taken from the dead.    \"Leave me alone, curse you!\" he shouted, louder than his aggressors. \"My  name is Paul Mole, I tell you. Ask the citizeness Evrard. I waited on  citizen Marat. I prepared his bath. I was the only friend who did not  turn away from him in his sickness and his poverty. Leave me alone, I  say! Why,\" he added, with a hoarse laugh, \"Jean Paul in his bath was as  naked as on the day he was born!\"    \"'Tis true,\" said one of those who had been most active in rummaging  through Mole's grimy rags. \"There's nothing to be found on him.\"    But suspicion once aroused was not easily allayed. Mole's protestations  became more and more vigorous and emphatic. His papers were all in  order, he vowed. He had them on him: his own identity papers, clear for  anyone to see. Someone had dragged them out of his pocket; they were  dank and covered with splashes of mud--hardly legible. They were handed  over to a man who stood in the immediate circle of light projected by  the lamp. He seized them and examined them carefully. This man was short  and slight, was dressed in well-made cloth clothes; his hair was held in  at the nape of the next in a modish manner with a black taffeta bow. His  hands were clean, slender, and claw-like, and he wore the tricolour  scarf of office round his waist which proclaimed him to be a member of  one of the numerous Committees which tyrannised over the people.    The papers appeared to be in order, and proclaimed the bearer to be Paul  Mole, a native of Besancon, a carpenter by trade. The identity book had  recently been signed by Jean Paul Marat, the man's latest employer, and  been counter-signed by the Commissary of the section.    The man in the tricolour scarf turned with some acerbity on the crowd  who was still pressing round the prisoner.    \"Which of you here,\" he queried roughly, \"levelled an unjust accusation  against an honest citizen?\"    But, as usual in such cases, no one replied directly to the charge. It  was not safe these days to come into conflict with men like Mole. The  Committees were all on their side, against the bourgeois as well as  against the aristos. This was the reign of the proletariat, and the  sans-culotte always emerged triumphant in a conflict against the  well-to-do. Nor was it good to rouse the ire of citizen Chauvelin, one  of the most powerful, as he was the most pitiless members of the  Committee of Public Safety. Quiet, sarcastic rather than aggressive,  something of the aristo, too, in his clean linen and well-cut clothes,  he had not even yielded to the defunct Marat in cruelty and relentless  persecution of aristocrats.    Evidently his sympathies now were all with Mole, the out-at-elbows,  miserable servant of an equally miserable master. His pale-coloured,  deep-set eyes challenged the crowd, which gave way before him, slunk  back into the corners, away from his coldly threatening glance. Thus he  found himself suddenly face to face with Mole, somewhat isolated from  the rest, and close to the tin bath with its grim contents. Chauvelin  had the papers in his hand.    \"Take these, citizen,\" he said curtly to the other. \"They are all in  order.\"    He looked up at Mole as he said this, for the latter, though his  shoulders were bent, was unusually tall, and Mole took the papers from  him. Thus for the space of a few seconds the two men looked into one  another's face, eyes to eyes--and suddenly Chauvelin felt an icy sweat  coursing down his spine. The eyes into which he gazed had a strange,  ironical twinkle in them, a kind of good-humoured arrogance, whilst  through the firm, clear-cut lips, half hidden by a dirty and ill-kempt  beard, there came the sound--oh! a mere echo--of a quaint and inane  laugh.    The whole thing--it seemed like a vision--was over in a second.  Chauvelin, sick and faint with the sudden rush of blood to his head,  closed his eyes for one brief instant. The next, the crowd had closed  round him; anxious inquiries reached his re-awakened senses.    But he uttered one quick, hoarse cry:    \"Hebert! A moi! Are you there?\"    \"Present, citizen!\" came in immediate response. And a tall figure in the  tattered uniform affected by the revolutionary guard stepped briskly out  of the crowd. Chauvelin's claw-like hand was shaking visibly.    \"The man Mole,\" he called in a voice husky with excitement. \"Seize him  at once! And, name of a dog! do not allow a living soul in or out of the  house!\"    Hebert turned on his heel. The next moment his harsh voice was heard  above the din and the general hubbub around:    \"Quite safe, citizen!\" he called to his chief. \"We have the rogue right  enough!\"    There was much shouting and much cursing, a great deal of bustle and  confusion, as the men of the Surete closed the doors of the defunct  demagogue's lodgings. Some two score men, a dozen or so women, were  locked in, inside the few rooms which reeked of dirt and of disease.  They jostled and pushed, screamed and protested. For two or three  minutes the din was quite deafening. Simonne Evrard pushed her way up to  the forefront of the crowd.    \"What is this I hear?\" she queried peremptorily. \"Who is accusing  citizen Mole? And of what, I should like to know? I am responsible for  everyone inside these apartments ... and if citizen Marat were still  alive--\"    Chauvelin appeared unaware of all the confusion and of the woman's  protestations. He pushed his way through the crowd to the corner of the  anteroom where Mole stood, crouching and hunched up, his grimy hands  idly fingering the papers which Chauvelin had returned to him a moment  ago. Otherwise he did not move.    He stood, silent and sullen; and when Chauvelin, who had succeeded in  mastering his emotion, gave the peremptory command: \"Take this man to  the depot at once. And do not allow him one instant out of your sight!\"  he made no attempt at escape.    He allowed Hebert and the men to seize him, to lead him away. He  followed without a word, without a struggle. His massive figure was  hunched up like that of an old man; his hands, which still clung to his  identity papers, trembled slightly like those of a man who is very  frightened and very helpless. The men of the Surete handled him very  roughly, but he made no protest. The woman Evrard did all the  protesting, vowing that the people would not long tolerate such tyranny.  She even forced her way up to Hebert. With a gesture of fury she tried  to strike him in the face, and continued, with a loud voice, her insults  and objurgations, until, with a movement of his bayonet, he pushed her  roughly out of the way.    After that Paul Mole, surrounded by the guard, was led without ceremony  out of the house. Chauvelin gazed after him as if he had been brought  face to face with a ghoul.      V    Chauvelin hurried to the depot. After those few seconds wherein he had  felt dazed, incredulous, almost under a spell, he had quickly regained  the mastery of his nerves, and regained, too, that intense joy which  anticipated triumph is wont to give.    In the out-at-elbows, half-starved servant of the murdered Terrorist,  citizen Chauvelin, of the Committee of Public Safety, had recognised his  arch enemy, that meddlesome and adventurous Englishman who chose to hide  his identity under the pseudonym of the Scarlet Pimpernel. He knew that  he could reckon on Hebert; his orders not to allow the prisoner one  moment out of sight would of a certainty be strictly obeyed.    Hebert, indeed, a few moments later, greeted his chief outside the doors  of the depot with the welcome news that Paul Mole was safely under lock  and key.    \"You had no trouble with him?\" Chauvelin queried, with ill-concealed  eagerness.    \"No, no! citizen, no trouble,\" was Hebert's quick reply. \"He seems to be  a well-known rogue in these parts,\" he continued with a complacent  guffaw; \"and some of his friends tried to hustle us at the corner of the  Rue de Tourraine; no doubt with a view to getting the prisoner away. But  we were too strong for them, and Paul Mole is now sulking in his cell  and still protesting that his arrest is an outrage against the liberty  of the people.\"    Chauvelin made no further remark. He was obviously too excited to speak.  Pushing past Hebert and the men of the Surete who stood about the dark  and narrow passages of the depot, he sought the Commissary of the  Section in the latter's office.    It was now close upon ten o'clock. The citizen Commissary Cuisinier had  finished his work for the day and was preparing to go home and to bed.  He was a family man, had been a respectable bourgeois in his day, and  though he was a rank opportunist and had sacrificed not only his  political convictions but also his conscience to the exigencies of the  time, he still nourished in his innermost heart a secret contempt for  the revolutionary brigands who ruled over France at this hour.    To any other man than citizen Chauvelin, the citizen Commissary would,  no doubt, have given a curt refusal to a request to see a prisoner at  this late hour of the evening. But Chauvelin was not a man to be denied,  and whilst muttering various objections in his ill-kempt beard,  Cuisinier, nevertheless, gave orders that the citizen was to be  conducted at once to the cells.    Paul Mole had in truth turned sulky. The turnkey vowed that the prisoner  had hardly stirred since first he had been locked up in the common cell.  He sat in a corner at the end of the bench, with"]]]
