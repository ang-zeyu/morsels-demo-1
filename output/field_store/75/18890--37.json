I thought at the time that I would give more than  twenty thousand pounds to be allowed to bide on the windy shores of  Forth.      I sailed from Southampton by an intermediate steamer, and went steerage  to save expense.  Happily my acute homesickness was soon forgotten in  another kind of malady.  It blew half a gale before we were out of the  Channel, and by the time we had rounded Ushant it was as dirty weather  as ever I hope to see.  I lay mortal sick in my bunk, unable to bear  the thought of food, and too feeble to lift my head.  I wished I had  never left home, but so acute was my sickness that if some one had  there and then offered me a passage back or an immediate landing on  shore I should have chosen the latter.    It was not till we got into the fair-weather seas around Madeira that I  recovered enough to sit on deck and observe my fellow-passengers.  There were some fifty of us in the steerage, mostly wives and children  going to join relations, with a few emigrant artisans and farmers.  I  early found a friend in a little man with a yellow beard and  spectacles, who sat down beside me and remarked on the weather in a  strong Scotch accent.  He turned out to be a Mr Wardlaw from Aberdeen,  who was going out to be a schoolmaster.  He was a man of good  education, who had taken a university degree, and had taught for some  years as an under-master in a school in his native town.  But the east  winds had damaged his lungs, and he had been glad to take the chance of  a poorly paid country school in the veld.  When I asked him where he  was going I was amazed to be told, 'Blaauwildebeestefontein.'    Mr Wardlaw was a pleasant little man, with a sharp tongue but a  cheerful temper.  He laboured all day at primers of the Dutch and  Kaffir languages, but in the evening after supper he would walk with me  on the after-deck and discuss the future.  Like me, he knew nothing of  the land he was going to, but he was insatiably curious, and he  affected me with his interest.  'This place, Blaauwildebeestefontein,'  he used to say, 'is among the Zoutpansberg mountains, and as far as I  can see, not above ninety miles from the railroad.  It looks from the  map a well-watered country, and the Agent-General in London told me it  was healthy or I wouldn't have taken the job.  It seems we'll be in the  heart of native reserves up there, for here's a list of chiefs--'Mpefu,  Sikitola, Majinje, Magata; and there are no white men living to the  east of us because of the fever.  The name means the \"spring of the  blue wildebeeste,\" whatever fearsome animal that may be.  It sounds  like a place for adventure, Mr Crawfurd.  You'll exploit the pockets of  the black men and I'll see what I can do with their minds.' There was  another steerage passenger whom I could not help observing because of  my dislike of his appearance.  He, too, was a little man, by name  Henriques, and in looks the most atrocious villain I have ever clapped  eyes on.  He had a face the colour of French mustard--a sort of dirty  green--and bloodshot, beady eyes with the whites all yellowed with  fever. He had waxed moustaches, and a curious, furtive way of walking  and looking about him.  We of the steerage were careless in our dress,  but he was always clad in immaculate white linen, with pointed, yellow  shoes to match his complexion.  He spoke to no one, but smoked long  cheroots all day in the stern of the ship, and studied a greasy  pocket-book. Once I tripped over him in the dark, and he turned on me  with a snarl and an oath.  I was short enough with him in return, and  he looked as if he could knife me.    'I'll wager that fellow has been a slave-driver in his time,' I told Mr  Wardlaw, who said, 'God pity his slaves, then.'    And now I come to the incident which made the rest of the voyage pass  all too soon for me, and foreshadowed the strange events which were to  come.  It was the day after we crossed the Line, and the first-class  passengers were having deck sports.  A tug-of-war had been arranged  between the three classes, and a half-dozen of the heaviest fellows in  the steerage, myself included, were invited to join.  It was a blazing  hot afternoon, but on the saloon deck there were awnings and a cool  wind blowing from the bows.  The first-class beat the second easily,  and after a tremendous struggle beat the steerage also.  Then they  regaled us with iced-drinks and cigars to celebrate the victory.    I was standing at the edge of the crowd of spectators, when my eye  caught a figure which seemed to have little interest in our games.  A  large man in clerical clothes was sitting on a deck-chair reading a  book.  There was nothing novel about the stranger, and I cannot explain  the impulse which made me wish to see his face.  I moved a few steps up  the deck, and then I saw that his skin was black.  I went a little  farther, and suddenly he raised his eyes from his book and looked  round. It was the face of the man who had terrified me years ago on the  Kirkcaple shore.    I spent the rest of the day in a brown study.  It was clear to me that  some destiny had prearranged this meeting.  Here was this man  travelling prosperously as a first-class passenger with all the  appurtenances of respectability.  I alone had seen him invoking strange  gods in the moonlight, I alone knew of the devilry in his heart, and I  could not but believe that some day or other there might be virtue in  that knowledge.    The second engineer and I had made friends, so I got him to consult the  purser's list for the name of my acquaintance. He was down as the Rev.  John Laputa, and his destination was Durban. The next day being Sunday,  who should appear to address us steerage passengers but the black  minister.  He was introduced by the captain himself, a notably pious  man, who spoke of the labours of his brother in the dark places of  heathendom. Some of us were hurt in our pride in being made the target  of a black man's oratory.  Especially Mr Henriques, whose skin spoke of  the tar-brush, protested with oaths against the insult. Finally he sat  down on a coil of rope, and spat scornfully in the vicinity of the  preacher.    For myself I was intensely curious, and not a little impressed.  The  man's face was as commanding as his figure, and his voice was the most  wonderful thing that ever came out of human mouth.  It was full and  rich, and gentle, with the tones of a great organ.  He had none of the  squat and preposterous negro lineaments, but a hawk nose like an Arab,  dark flashing eyes, and a cruel and resolute mouth.  He was black as my  hat, but for the rest he might have sat for a figure of a Crusader.  I  do not know what the sermon was about, though others told me that it  was excellent.  All the time I watched him, and kept saying to myself,  'You hunted me up the Dyve Burn, but I bashed your face for you.'  Indeed, I thought I could see faint scars on his cheek.    The following night I had toothache, and could not sleep.  It was too  hot to breathe under cover, so I got up, lit a pipe, and walked on the  after-deck to ease the pain.  The air was very still, save for the  whish of water from the screws and the steady beat of the engines.  Above, a great yellow moon looked down on me, and a host of pale stars.    The moonlight set me remembering the old affair of the Dyve Burn, and  my mind began to run on the Rev. John Laputa.  It pleased me to think  that I was on the track of some mystery of which I alone had the clue.  I promised myself to search out the antecedents of the minister when I  got to Durban, for I had a married cousin there, who might know  something of his doings.  Then, as I passed by the companion-way to the  lower deck, I heard voices, and peeping over the rail, I saw two men  sitting in the shadow just beyond the hatch of the hold.    I thought they might be two of the sailors seeking coolness on the open  deck, when something in the figure of one of them made me look again.  The next second I had slipped back and stolen across the after-deck to  a point just above them.  For the two were the black minister and that  ugly yellow villain, Henriques.    I had no scruples about eavesdropping, but I could make nothing of  their talk.  They spoke low, and in some tongue which may have been  Kaffir or Portuguese, but was in any case unknown to me.  I lay,  cramped and eager, for many minutes, and was just getting sick of it  when a familiar name caught my ear.  Henriques said something in which  I caught the word 'Blaauwildebeestefontein.'  I listened intently, and  there could be no mistake.  The minister repeated the name, and for the  next few minutes it recurred often in their talk.  I went back  stealthily to bed, having something to make me forget my aching tooth.  First of all, Laputa and Henriques were allies.  Second, the place I  was bound for had something to do with their schemes.    I said nothing to Mr Wardlaw, but spent the next week in the assiduous  toil of the amateur detective.  I procured some maps and books from my  friend, the second engineer, and read all I could about  Blaauwildebeestefontein.  Not that there was much to learn; but I  remember I had quite a thrill when I discovered from the chart of the  ship's run one day that we were in the same latitude as that  uncouthly-named spot.  I found out nothing, however, about Henriques or  the Rev. John Laputa.  The Portuguese still smoked in the stern, and  thumbed his greasy notebook; the minister sat in his deck-chair, and  read heavy volumes from the ship's library.  Though I watched every  night, I never found them again together.    At Cape Town Henriques went ashore and did not return. The minister did  not budge from the ship the three days we lay in port, and, indeed, it  seemed to me that he kept his cabin.  At any rate I did not see his  great figure on deck till we were tossing in the choppy seas round Cape  Agulhas.

It is  a positive fact, there were fifty deserters from the British army  taken off of the wreck of the 'San Francisco,' and carried to England.  John Bull pretended to wink at it, hired a steamer, and sent them all  out again to us. Lord! how our folks roared when they heard it; and as  for the President, he laughed like a hyena over a dead nigger. Law  sakes alive man! Make a question between our nation and England about  fifty desarters, and if the ministers of the day only dared to talk of  fighting, the members of all the manufactoren towns in England, the  cottonocracy of Great Britain, would desert too!    \"It's nateral, as an American, I should be satisfied with the treaty;  but I'll tell you what I am sorry for. I am grieved we asked, or your  Governor-General granted, a right to us to land on these shores and  make our fish. Lord Elgin ought to have known that every foot of the  sea-coast of Nova Scotia has been granted, and is now private  property.    \"To concede a privilege to land, with a proviso to respect the rights  of the owner, is nonsense. This comes of not sending a man to  negociate who is chosen by the people, not for his rank, but for his  ability and knowledge. The fact is, I take blame to myself about it,  for I was pumped who would do best and be most acceptable to us  Americans. I was afeared they would send a Billingsgate contractor,  who is a plaguy sight more posted up about fisheries than any member  of parliament, or a clever colonist (not a party man), and they know  more than both the others put together; and I dreaded if they sent  either, there would be a quid pro quo, as Josiah says, to be given,  afore we got the fisheries, if we ever got them, at all. 'So,' sais I,  out of a bit of fun, for I can't help taken a rise out of folks no how  I can fix it, 'send us a lord. We are mighty fond of noblemen to  Washington, and toady them first-rate. It will please such a man as  Pierce to show him so much respect as to send a peer to him. He will  get whatever he asks.'    \"Well, they fell into the trap beautiful. They sent us one, and we  rowed him up to the very head waters of Salt River in no time.1 But I  am sorry we asked the privilege to land and cure fish. I didn't think  any created critter would have granted that. Yes, I foresee trouble  arising out of this. Suppose 'Cayenne Pepper,' as we call the captain  that commanded the 'Cayenne' at Grey Town, was to come to a port in  Nova Scotia, and pepper it for insultin' our flag by apprehenden  trespassers (though how a constable is to arrest a crew of twenty men  unless, Irishman like, he surrounds them, is a mystery to me). What  would be done in that case? Neither you nor I can tell, Squire. But  depend upon it, there is a tempestical time comin', and it is as well  to be on the safe side of the fence when there is a chance of kicking  going on.      1 To row up Salt River is a common phrase, used generally to denote  political defeat. The distance to which a party is rowed up Salt River  depends entirely upon the magnitude of the majority against him. If  the defeat is overwhelming, the unsuccessful party is said \"to be  rowed up to the very head waters of Salt River.\" The phrase has its  origin in the fact that there is a small stream of that name in  Kentucky, the passage of which is made difficult and laborious, as  well by its tortuous course as by numerous shallows and bars. The real  application of the phrase is to the unhappy wight who propels the  boat, but politically, in slang usage, it means the man rowed up, the  passenger--I. INMAN.      \"The bombardment of Grey Town was the greatest and bravest exploit of  modern times. We silenced their guns at the first broadside, and shut  them up so sudden that envious folks like the British now swear they  had none, while we lost only one man in the engagement, but he was  drunk and fell overboard. What is the cannonade of Sebastopool to  that? Why it sinks into insignificance.\"    He had hardly ceased speaking, when the wheels of a carriage were  heard rapidly approaching the door. Taking out his watch, and  observing the hour, he said: \"Squire, it is now eleven o'clock. I must  be a movin'. Good bye! I am off to Halifax. I am goin' to make a night  flight of it. The wind is fair, and I must sail by daylight to-morrow  morning. Farewell!\"    He then shook hands most cordially with me, and said: \"Squire, unless  you feel inclined at some future day to make the tour of the States  with me, or somethin' turns up I am not availed of, I am afraid you  have seen the last Journal of your old friend 'Sam Slick.'\"                                     CHAPTER II.                            CLIPPERS AND STEAMERS.      Whoever has taken the trouble to read the \"Wise Saws\" of Mr Slick,  will be prepared to resume the thread of his narrative without  explanation, if indeed these unconnected selections deserve the  appellation. But as this work may fall into the hands of many people  who never saw its predecessor, it may be necessary to premise that our  old friend Sam, having received a commission from the President of the  United States, to visit the coast of Nova Scotia, and report to him  fully on the state of the fisheries, their extent and value, the  manner in which they were prosecuted, and the best mode of obtaining a  participation in them, he proceeded on his cruise in a trading vessel,  called the \"Black Hawk,\" whereof Timothy Cutler was master, and Mr  Eldad Nickerson the pilot. The two preceding volumes contained his  adventures at sea, and in the harbours of the province, to the  westward of Halifax. The present work is devoted to his remarks on  \"nature and human nature.\"    While amusing himself fishing within three miles of the coast, off La  Haive, in contravention of the treaty, he narrowly escaped capture by  the British cruiser \"Spitfire,\" commanded by Captain Stoker. By a  skilful manoeuvre, he decoyed the man-of-war, in the eagerness of the  chase, on to a sand-bar, when he dexterously slipt through a narrow  passage between two islands, and keeping one of them in a line between  the \"Black Hawk\" and her pursuer, so as to be out of the reach of her  guns, he steered for the eastern shore of Nova Scotia, and was soon  out of sight of the islands behind which his enemy lay embedded in the  sand; from this point the narrative is resumed in Mr Slick's own  words.1      1 His remarks on the fisheries I have wholly omitted, for they have  now lost their interest. His observations on \"nature and human nature\"  are alone retained, as they may be said to have a universal  application.--ED.      \"I guess,\" said I, \"Captain, the 'Spitfire' will have to put into  Halifax to report herself and be surveyed, so we may pursue our course  in peace. But this 'Black Hawk' is a doll, ain't she? don't she skim  over the water like a sea gull? The truth is, Cutler, when you ain't  in a hurry, and want to enjoy yourself at sea, as I always do, for I  am a grand sailor, give me a clipper. She is so light and buoyant, and  the motion so elastic, it actilly exilerates your spirits. There is  something like life in her gait, and you have her in hand like a  horse, and you feel as if you were her master, and directed her  movements. I ain't sure you don't seem as if you were part of her  yourself. Then there is room to show skill and seamanship, and if you  don't in reality go as quick as a steamer, you seem to go faster, if  there is no visible object to measure your speed by, and that is  something, for the white foam on the leeward side rushes by you in  rips, raps, and rainbows like Canadian rapids.    \"Then if she is an atrysilly1 like this, and she is doing her  prettiest, and actilly laughs again, she is so pleased, why you are  satisfied, for you don't make the breeze, you take it as you find it,  like all other good gifts of Providence, and say, 'ain't she going  like wink, how she forges ahead, don't she?' Your attention is kept  alive, too, watchin' the wind, and trimmin' sail to it accordingly,  and the jolly 'Oh, heave oh,' of the sailors is music one loves to  listen to, and if you wish to take a stretch for it in your cloak on  deck, on the sunny or shady side of the companion-way, the breeze  whistles a nice soft lullaby for you, and you are off in the land of  Nod in no time.\"      1 The Atricilla, or laughing sea-gull. Its note resembles a coarse  laugh. Hence its name. It is very common in the Bahamas.      \"Dreaming of Sophy Collingwood,\" sais the Captain, \"and the witch of  Eskisooney, eh?\"    \"Yes, dreamin' of bright eyes and smilin' faces, or anythin' else  that's near and dear, for to my idea, the heart gives the subject for  the head to think upon. In a fair wind and a charmin' day like this, I  never coiled up on the deck for a nap in my life, that I had'nt  pleasant dreams. You feel as if you were at peace with all the world  in general, and yourself in partikeler, and that it is very polite of  folks to stay to home ashore, and let you and your friends enjoy  yourselves without treadin' on your toes, and wakin' of you up if  asleep, or a jostlin' of you in your turn on the quarter-deck, or  over-hearin' of your conversation.    \"And ain't you always ready for your meals, and don't you walk into  them in rael right down earnest? Oh, nothing ever tastes so good to me  as it does at sea. The appetite, like a sharp knife, makes the meat  seem tender, and the sea air is a great friend of digestion, and  always keeps company with it. Then you don't care to sit and drink  after dinner as you do at an hotel of an idle day, for you want to go  on deck, light your cigar, take a sweep round the horizon with your  glass to see if there is any sail in sight, glance at the sky to  ascertain if the breeze is likely to "]]]
