LOUIS.      The improvement of the Mississippi River near St. Louis progresses  satisfactorily. The efficacy of the jetty system is illustrated in the  lines of mattresses which showed accumulations of sand deposits ranging  from the surface of the river to nearly sixteen feet in height. At Twin  Hollow, thirteen miles from St. Louis and six miles from Horse-Tail Bar,  there was found a sand bar extending over the widest portion of the  river on which the engineering forces were engaged. Hurdles are built  out from the shore to concentrate the stream on the obstruction, and  then to protect the river from widening willows are interwoven between  the piles. At Carroll's Island mattresses 125 feet wide have been  placed, and the banks revetted with stone from ordinary low water to a  16 foot stage. There is plenty of water over the bar, and at the most  shallow points the lead showed a depth of twelve feet. Beard's Island, a  short distance further, is also being improved, the largest force of men  at any one place being here engaged. Four thousand feet of mattresses  have been begun, and in placing them work will be vigorously prosecuted  until operations are suspended by floating ice. The different sections  are under the direction of W. F. Fries, resident engineer, and E. M.  Currie, superintending engineer. There are now employed about 1,200 men,  thirty barges and scows, two steam launches, and the stern-wheel steamer  A. A. Humphreys. The improvements have cost, in actual money expended,  about $200,000, and as the appropriation for the ensuing year  approximates $600,000, the prospect of a clear channel is gratifying to  those interested in the river.           *       *       *       *       *          BUNTE'S BURETTE FOR THE ANALYSIS OF FURNACE GASES.      For analyzing the gases of blast-furnaces the various apparatus of Orsat  have long been employed; but, by reason of its simplicity, the burette  devised by Dr. Buente, and shown in the accompanying figures, is much  easier to use. Besides, it permits of a much better and more rapid  absorption of the oxide of carbon; and yet, for the lost fractions of  the latter, it is necessary to replace a part of the absorbing liquid  three or four times. The absorbing liquid is prepared by making a  saturated solution of chloride of copper in hydrochloric acid, and  adding thereto a small quantity of dissolved chloride of tin. Afterward,  there are added to the decanted mixture a few spirals of red copper, and  the mixture is then carefully kept from contact with the air.    To fill the burette with gas, the three-way cock, _a_, is so placed that  the axial aperture shall be in communication with the graduated part, A,  of the burette. After this, water is poured into the funnel, t, and the  burette is put in communication with the gas reservoir by means of a  rubber tube. The lower point of the burette is put in communication with  a rubber pump, V (Fig. 2), on an aspirator (the cock, _b_, being left  open), and the gas is sucked in until all the air that was in the  apparatus has been expelled from it. The cocks, _a_ and _b_, are turned  90 degrees. The water in the funnel prevents the gases communicating  with the top. The point of the three-way cock is afterward closed with a  rubber tube and glass rod.    If the gas happens to be in the reservoir of an aspirator, it is made  to pass into the apparatus in the following manner: The burette is  completely filled with water, and the point of the three-way cock is  put in communication with a reservoir. If the gas is under pressure, a  portion of it is allowed to escape through the capillary tube into the  water in the funnel, by turning the cock, _a_, properly, and thus all  the water in the conduit is entirely expelled. Afterward _a_ is turned  180 deg., and the lower cock, _b_, is opened. While the water is flowing  through _b_, the burette becomes filled with gas.    _Mode of Measuring the Gases and Absorption_.--The tube that  communicates with the vessel, F, is put in communication, after the  latter has been completely filled with water, with the point of the  cock, _b_ (Fig. 2). Then the latter is opened, as is also the pinch cock  on the rubber tubing, and water is allowed to enter the burette through  the bottom until the level is at the zero of the graduation. There are  then 100 cubic centimeters in the burette. The superfluous gas has  escaped through the cock, _a_, and passed through the water in the  funnel. The cock, _a_, is afterward closed by turning it 90 deg. To  cause the absorbing liquid to pass into the burette, the water in the  graduated cylinder is made to flow by connecting the rubber tube, s, of  the bottle, S, with the point of the burette. The cock is opened, and  suction is effected with the mouth of the tube, r. When the water has  flowed out to nearly the last drop, _b_ is closed and the suction bottle  is removed. The absorbing liquid (caustic potassa or pyrogallate of  potassa) is poured into a porcelain capsule, P, and the point of the  burette is dipped into the liquid. If the cock, _b_, be opened, the  absorbing liquid will be sucked into the burette. In order to hasten  the absorption, the cock, _b_, is closed, and the burette is shaken  horizontally, the aperture of the funnel being closed by the hand during  the operation.    If not enough absorbing liquid has entered, there may be sucked into the  burette, by the process described above, a new quantity of liquid. The  reaction finished, the graduated cylinder is put in communication with  the funnel by turning the cock, _a_. The water is allowed to run from  the funnel, and the latter is filled again with water up to the mark.  The gas is then again under the same pressure as at the beginning.    After the level has become constant, the quantity of gas remaining is  measured. The contraction that has taken place gives, in hundredths of  the total volume, the volume of the gas absorbed.    When it is desired to make an analysis of smoke due to combustion,  caustic potassa is first sucked into the burette. After complete  absorption, and after putting the gas at the same pressure, the  diminution gives the volume of carbonic acid.    To determine the oxygen in the remaining gas, a portion of the caustic  potash is allowed to flow out, and an aqueous solution of pyrogallic  acid and potash is allowed to enter. The presence of oxygen is revealed  by the color of the liquid, which becomes darker.    The gas is then agitated with the absorbing liquid until, upon opening  the cock, _a_, the liquid remains in the capillary tube, that is to say,  until no more water runs from the funnel into the burette. To make a  quantitative analysis of the carbon contained in gas, the pyrogallate of  potash must be entirely removed from the burette. To do this, the liquid  is sucked out by means of the flask, S, until there remain only a few  drops; then the cock, _a_, is opened and water is allowed to flow from  the funnel along the sides of the burette. Then _a_ is closed, and  the washing water is sucked in the same manner. By repeating this  manipulation several times, the absorbing liquid is completely removed.  The acid solution of chloride of copper is then allowed to enter.    As the absorbing liquids adhere to the glass, it is better, before  noting the level, to replace these liquids by water. The cocks, _a_ and  _b_, are opened, and water is allowed to enter from the funnel, the  absorbing liquid being made to flow at the same time through the cock,  _b_.    When an acid solution of chloride of copper is employed, dilute  hydrochloric acid is used instead of water.    Fig. 2 shows the arrangement of the apparatus for the quantitative  analysis of oxide of carbon and hydrogen by combustion. The gas in the  burette is first mixed with atmospheric air, by allowing the liquid to  flow through _b_, and causing air to enter through the axial aperture of  the three way cock, _a_, after cutting off communication at v. Then, as  shown in the figure, the burette is connected with the tube, B, which is  filled with water up to the narrow curved part, and the interior of the  burette is made to communicate with the combustion tube, v, by turning  the cock, a. The combustion tube is heated by means of a Bunsen burner  or alcohol lamp, L. It is necessary to proceed, so that all the water  shall be driven from the cock and the capillary tube, and that it shall  be sent into the burette. The combustion is effected by causing the  mixture of gas to pass from the burette into the tube, B, through the  tube, v, heated to redness, into which there passes a palladium wire.  Water is allowed to flow through the point of the tube, B, while from  the flask, F, it enters through the bottom into the burette, so as to  drive out the gas. The water is allowed to rise into the burette as far  as the cock, and the cocks, _b_ and _b1_, are afterward closed.    [Illustration: DR. BUeNTE'S GAS BURETTE]    By a contrary operation, the gas is made to pass from B into the  burette. It is then allowed to cool, and, after the pressure has been  established again, the contraction is measured. If the gas burned is  hydrogen, the contraction multiplied by two-thirds gives the original  volume of the hydrogen gas burned. If the gas burned is oxide of carbon,  there forms an equal volume of carbonic acid, and the contraction is the  half of CO. Thus, to analyze CO, a portion of the liquid is removed from  the burette, then caustic potash is allowed to enter, and the process  goes on as explained above.    The total contraction resulting from combustion and absorption,  multiplied by two-thirds, gives the volume of the oxide of carbon.    The hydrogen and oxide carbon may thus be quantitatively analyzed  together or separately.--_Revue Industrielle_.

Moreover, occasional gleams of ambition broke forth from amid his  quiet thoughtfulness, which shewed, that beneath a cold exterior there  lurked a mind of no ordinary cast. This constitutional reserve made him  select in his choice of friends, but with those to whom he granted the  privilege of intimacy, he was all confidence and frankness.    The limited cost of an education for the Church of Scotland renders it an  object of ambition to many in the middle ranks of life; and the parents  of Mungo Park, judging that his peculiar disposition fitted him for the  ministry, were anxious that he should enter upon the initiatory course of  education. Park, however, manifested a decided repugnance to this choice,  and resolved upon qualifying himself for the medical profession.  Accordingly, at the age of fifteen, he was bound apprentice to Mr. Thomas  Anderson, a respectable surgeon in Selkirk, with whom he remained for the  space of three years, during which, at leisure hours, he continued to  prosecute his classical studies, and also acquired a knowledge of the  elementary principles of mathematics. Mr. Anderson's practice, which was  pretty extensive, enabled him to obtain a considerable acquaintance of  the rudiments of his profession, and formed a suitable preparation for  his academical studies. In the year 1789, he removed to Edinburgh, and  attended the usual course of lectures for three successive sessions.  Though a persevering and attentive student, he does not seem to have  manifested much love for the healing art. Botany was his favourite study,  which he pursued with much ardour during the summer months. And,  fortunately, his brother-in-law, Mr. James Dickson, who published an  elaborate work on the _Cryptogamic_ plants, was well calculated to aid  him in this pursuit. This meritorious individual had in early life  removed to London, and for some time followed the humble occupation of a  working gardener. Having distinguished himself by a diligent and zealous  discharge of the duties of his calling, he attracted the notice of Sir  Joseph Banks, who, ever anxious to reward merit, generously opened to him  his library. Of this privilege Mr. Dickson availed himself so  successfully, that he soon distinguished himself as a botanist, and  enlarged materially the boundaries of the science. But, with rare  prudence, he still carried on his original business as a seeds man, while  he lived on terms of intimacy and friendship with many of the most  distinguished literary characters of his time.    With Mr. Dickson young Park made a summer ramble through the Highlands,  principally for the sake of adding to his botanical treasures, and, under  under the guidance of his relative, pursued enthusiastically his  favourite science. After Park had completed his medical studies, Mr  Dickson advised him to go to London, in search of professional  employment, in the expectation of advancing his prospects, through the  interest of his scientific acquaintance. Nor was he disappointed in this  hope, for, through Sir Joseph Banks's recommendation, he obtained the  appointment of assistant surgeon to the Worcester East Indiaman. He  sailed in February 1792; and after a voyage to Bencoolen, in the island  of Sumatra, returned to England in the following year. No incident of  importance occurred during this voyage, but Mr. Park made some collections  in botany and natural history, which were submitted to the Linnaean  Society, and an account of them printed in the third volume of their  Transactions.    It does not appear whether Park had come to any determinate conclusion to  quit the company's service; at all events, he continued to shew a decided  preference for studies in natural history; and the circle of  acquaintances to which Sir Joseph Banks had introduced him after his  return to England, contributed much to strengthen this preference. At  this time, no doubt, he was disposed, upon a suitable opening being  presented, to free himself from the duties of his profession, and enter  upon some more congenial employment. His mind was soon to be directed to  loftier objects--to scenes of stirring interest and varied adventure--to  an enterprise for which he was well qualified by his enthusiastic zeal  for discovery, his scientific acquirements, vigorous constitution, and  patient and persevering disposition. The African Association, consisting  of a number of individuals distinguished by their ardent zeal for the  promotion of geographical discovery in the unknown regions of that vast  continent, had been formed a few years before this period. Their  investigations had brought to light some leading facts relative to  Northern Africa; and with the assistance of Major Rennel, they were  endeavouring to lay down as accurately as possible upon the map, the  principal geographical outlines. But they were most anxious to acquire  correct information concerning the river Joliba, or Niger, and also to  collect some particulars concerning the interior of the country. Under  their auspices several travellers had already gone forth, who had either  fallen victims to the climate, or been murdered by the natives;--and  recent intelligence had been brought to England of the death of Major  Houghton, who had set out with the intention of penetrating to Timbuctoo  and Houssa. Deterred by his fate, no individual for a considerable period  seemed willing to undertake the mission, though liberal offers of  compensation had been made. Here was the very enterprise which possessed  irresistible charms for Park's romantic and daring mind: in him the  Association found an individual well qualified for the task. They were  fully satisfied with the answers which he gave to all their inquiries:  his mind had been already directed towards geographical research; he had  the matured strength of manhood, and his constitution had in some  measure, been inured to a hot climate; his medical knowledge would not  only contribute to the preservation of his own health, but would also  secure him the respect and veneration of the natives. At the commencement  of his narrative, he relates the feelings which animated him in deciding  on this perilous journey. The prospects of personal advantage held out,  even should he prove successful, were so inconsiderable, that in his  acceptance of the offer, he was evidently actuated by an ardent desire of  adding to the slender knowledge possessed of that interesting country, as  well as by the hope of having his name joined to the list of those who  have distinguished themselves by active enterprise.    A considerable time elapsed ere everything was ready for his departure;  and two years had passed away since his return from India. During that  period, with the exception of a short visit paid to his friends in  Scotland, he had chiefly resided in London; partly engaged with his  favourite studies, and enjoying the pleasures of cultivated society; but  devoting his chief time and attention to acquiring the knowledge, and  superintending the preparations necessary for his journey. At length he  received his final instructions from the Association, and set sail from  Portsmouth, on the 22d of May 1795, on board the Endeavour, an African  trader, bound for the Gambia, where he arrived on the 21st of the  following month. He was furnished with a letter of recommendation to Dr.  Laidley, who resided at the English factory of Pisania, on the Gambia,  and on whom he had a letter of credit for L. 200.    In the reprint which follows, the reader will find, in Mr. Park's own  words, a full narrative of the various incidents which befel him during  this eventful journey.           *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration: Map of Park's Travels in Africa with the Course of the  Niger.]           *       *       *       *       *    TRAVELS IN THE INTERIOR OF AFRICA.

I had a passionate desire to examine into the  productions of a country so little known, and to become experimentally  acquainted with the modes of life and character of the natives. I knew  that I was able to bear fatigue, and I relied on my youth, and the  strength of my constitution, to preserve me from the effects of the  climate.
