Yet it was no beast that  Dorothy had discovered, for the person was clothed most gorgeously in  embroidered garments of many colors, and wore a straw hat perched  jauntily upon the side of its head.  But it differed from human beings  in this respect, that instead of hands and feet there grew at the end  of its arms and legs round wheels, and by means of these wheels it  rolled very swiftly over the level ground.  Afterward Dorothy found  that these odd wheels were of the same hard substance that our  finger-nails and toe-nails are composed of, and she also learned that  creatures of this strange race were born in this queer fashion.  But  when our little girl first caught sight of the first individual of a  race that was destined to cause her a lot of trouble, she had an idea  that the brilliantly-clothed personage was on roller-skates, which were  attached to his hands as well as to his feet.    \"Run!\" screamed the yellow hen, fluttering away in great fright.  \"It's  a Wheeler!\"    \"A Wheeler?\" exclaimed Dorothy.  \"What can that be?\"    \"Don't you remember the warning in the sand: 'Beware the Wheelers'?  Run, I tell you--run!\"    So Dorothy ran, and the Wheeler gave a sharp, wild cry and came after  her in full chase.    Looking over her shoulder as she ran, the girl now saw a great  procession of Wheelers emerging from the forest--dozens and dozens of  them--all clad in splendid, tight-fitting garments and all rolling  swiftly toward her and uttering their wild, strange cries.    \"They're sure to catch us!\" panted the girl, who was still carrying the  heavy dinner-pail she had picked.  \"I can't run much farther, Billina.\"    \"Climb up this hill,--quick!\" said the hen; and Dorothy found she was  very near to the heap of loose and jagged rocks they had passed on  their way to the forest.  The yellow hen was even now fluttering among  the rocks, and Dorothy followed as best she could, half climbing and  half tumbling up the rough and rugged steep.    She was none too soon, for the foremost Wheeler reached the hill a  moment after her; but while the girl scrambled up the rocks the  creature stopped short with howls of rage and disappointment.    Dorothy now heard the yellow hen laughing, in her cackling, henny way.    \"Don't hurry, my dear,\" cried Billina.  \"They can't follow us among  these rocks, so we're safe enough now.\"    Dorothy stopped at once and sat down upon a broad boulder, for she was  all out of breath.    The rest of the Wheelers had now reached the foot of the hill, but it  was evident that their wheels would not roll upon the rough and jagged  rocks, and therefore they were helpless to follow Dorothy and the hen  to where they had taken refuge.  But they circled all around the little  hill, so the child and Billina were fast prisoners and could not come  down without being captured.    Then the creatures shook their front wheels at Dorothy in a threatening  manner, and it seemed they were able to speak as well as to make their  dreadful outcries, for several of them shouted:    \"We'll get you in time, never fear!  And when we do get you, we'll tear  you into little bits!\"    \"Why are you so cruel to me?\" asked Dorothy.  \"I'm a stranger in your  country, and have done you no harm.\"    \"No harm!\" cried one who seemed to be their leader.  \"Did you not pick  our lunch-boxes and dinner-pails?  Have you not a stolen dinner-pail  still in your hand?\"    \"I only picked one of each,\" she answered.  \"I was hungry, and I didn't  know the trees were yours.\"    \"That is no excuse,\" retorted the leader, who was clothed in a most  gorgeous suit.  \"It is the law here that whoever picks a dinner-pail  without our permission must die immediately.\"    \"Don't you believe him,\" said Billina.  \"I'm sure the trees do not  belong to these awful creatures.  They are fit for any mischief, and  it's my opinion they would try to kill us just the same if you hadn't  picked a dinner-pail.\"    \"I think so, too,\" agreed Dorothy.  \"But what shall we do now?\"    \"Stay where we are,\" advised the yellow hen.  \"We are safe from the  Wheelers until we starve to death, anyhow; and before that time comes a  good many things can happen.\"          4.  Tiktok the Machine Man      After an hour or so most of the band of Wheelers rolled back into the  forest, leaving only three of their number to guard the hill.  These  curled themselves up like big dogs and pretended to go to sleep on the  sands; but neither Dorothy nor Billina were fooled by this trick, so  they remained in security among the rocks and paid no attention to  their cunning enemies.    Finally the hen, fluttering over the mound, exclaimed: \"Why, here's a  path!\"    So Dorothy at once clambered to where Billina sat, and there, sure  enough, was a smooth path cut between the rocks.  It seemed to wind  around the mound from top to bottom, like a cork-screw, twisting here  and there between the rough boulders but always remaining level and  easy to walk upon.    Indeed, Dorothy wondered at first why the Wheelers did not roll up this  path; but when she followed it to the foot of the mound she found that  several big pieces of rock had been placed directly across the end of  the way, thus preventing any one outside from seeing it and also  preventing the Wheelers from using it to climb up the mound.    Then Dorothy walked back up the path, and followed it until she came to  the very top of the hill, where a solitary round rock stood that was  bigger than any of the others surrounding it.  The path came to an end  just beside this great rock, and for a moment it puzzled the girl to  know why the path had been made at all.  But the hen, who had been  gravely following her around and was now perched upon a point of rock  behind Dorothy, suddenly remarked:    \"It looks something like a door, doesn't it?\"    \"What looks like a door?\" enquired the child.    \"Why, that crack in the rock, just facing you,\" replied Billina, whose  little round eyes were very sharp and seemed to see everything.  \"It  runs up one side and down the other, and across the top and the bottom.\"    \"What does?\"    \"Why, the crack.  So I think it must be a door of rock, although I do  not see any hinges.\"    \"Oh, yes,\" said Dorothy, now observing for the first time the crack in  the rock.  \"And isn't this a key-hole, Billina?\" pointing to a round,  deep hole at one side of the door.    \"Of course.  If we only had the key, now, we could unlock it and see  what is there,\" replied the yellow hen.  \"May be it's a treasure  chamber full of diamonds and rubies, or heaps of shining gold, or--\"    \"That reminds me,\" said Dorothy, \"of the golden key I picked up on the  shore.  Do you think that it would fit this key-hole, Billina?\"    \"Try it and see,\" suggested the hen.    So Dorothy searched in the pocket of her dress and found the golden  key.  And when she had put it into the hole of the rock, and turned it,  a sudden sharp snap was heard; then, with a solemn creak that made the  shivers run down the child's back, the face of the rock fell outward,  like a door on hinges, and revealed a small dark chamber just inside.    \"Good gracious!\" cried Dorothy, shrinking back as far as the narrow  path would let her.    For, standing within the narrow chamber of rock, was the form of a  man--or, at least, it seemed like a man, in the dim light.  He was only  about as tall as Dorothy herself, and his body was round as a ball and  made out of burnished copper.  Also his head and limbs were copper, and  these were jointed or hinged to his body in a peculiar way, with metal  caps over the joints, like the armor worn by knights in days of old.  He stood perfectly still, and where the light struck upon his form it  glittered as if made of pure gold.    \"Don't be frightened,\" called Billina, from her perch.  \"It isn't  alive.\"    \"I see it isn't,\" replied the girl, drawing a long breath.    \"It is only made out of copper, like the old kettle in the barn-yard at  home,\" continued the hen, turning her head first to one side and then  to the other, so that both her little round eyes could examine the  object.    \"Once,\" said Dorothy, \"I knew a man made out of tin, who was a woodman  named Nick Chopper.  But he was as alive as we are, 'cause he was born  a real man, and got his tin body a little at a time--first a leg and  then a finger and then an ear--for the reason that he had so many  accidents with his axe, and cut himself up in a very careless manner.\"    \"Oh,\" said the hen, with a sniff, as if she did not believe the story.    \"But this copper man,\" continued Dorothy, looking at it with big eyes,  \"is not alive at all, and I wonder what it was made for, and why it was  locked up in this queer place.\"    \"That is a mystery,\" remarked the hen, twisting her head to arrange her  wing-feathers with her bill.    Dorothy stepped inside the little room to get a back view of the copper  man, and in this way discovered a printed card that hung between his  shoulders, it being suspended from a small copper peg at the back of  his neck.  She unfastened this card and returned to the path, where the  light was better, and sat herself down upon a slab of rock to read the  printing.    \"What does it say?\" asked the hen, curiously.    Dorothy read the card aloud, spelling out the big words with some  difficulty; and this is what she read:      +-----------------------------------------------------------------+    |                                                                 |    |                       SMITH & TINKER'S                          |    |          Patent Double-Action, Extra-Responsive,                |    |              Thought-Creating, Perfect-Talking                  |    |                       MECHANICAL MAN                            |    |        Fitted with our Special Clock-Work Attachment.           |    |        Thinks, Speaks, Acts, and Does"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/48991"],[0,"Leyte: The Return to the Philippines (#4)"],[1,"plans for a return to Mindanao,  southernmost island of the Philippines, with a target date of 15  November 1944. [8] General MacArthur on 15 June issued a plan for  his future operations. The entrance into the Philippines was to be  accomplished in two phases. The first would be a preliminary operation  on 25 October into the Sarangani Bay area in southern Mindanao in  order to establish land-based air forces to augment the carrier-based  air support for the principal effort. The major effort was to be  an amphibious landing operation with forces mounted from New Guinea  for the seizure on 15 November of airfields and bases on Leyte. [9]  The latter was to follow quickly on the heels of the first operation  in order to take full advantage of the surprise tactics.    Leyte occupies a commanding position in the Philippine Islands. Because  of its central location, its repossession by the United States would  not only divide the Japanese forces in the Philippines but would also  provide an excellent anchorage in Leyte Gulf, together with sites  for bases and airfields from which land-based aircraft could bomb all  parts of the Philippines, the coast of China, and Formosa. To an even  greater extent than Mindanao, Leyte could be made into an excellent  springboard from which to launch subsequent operations against the  Japanese in Formosa or in the rest of the Philippines.    In his planning, General MacArthur recognized that the Leyte operation,  his most ambitious to date, would require \"massed carrier-based  air support\" and all of the \"combined amphibious and naval forces  available at the time.\" [10]    By June 1944 General MacArthur's forces had pushed up the New Guinea  coast to the island of Biak, about nine hundred nautical miles  southeast of Davao, Mindanao, while those of Admiral Nimitz were  poised to strike at Saipan some twelve hundred miles northeast of  Davao. In most of their previous campaigns the Americans had struck  with overwhelming force at weakly held Japanese garrisons. Since  the tide of war was now so favorable to the Allied cause, the Joint  Chiefs thought that the Pacific timetable of pending operations  might be accelerated. On 13 June they had therefore asked MacArthur  and Nimitz their opinions with regard to three ways proposed for  speeding up operations: \"(a) By advancing target dates of operations  now scheduled through operations against Formosa; (b) By by-passing  presently selected objectives prior to operations against Formosa;  and (c) By by-passing presently selected objectives and choosing new  ones including the home islands.\" Although the Philippine Islands  were not explicitly named as targets that might be bypassed, they  were certainly included by implication. [11]    On 18 June General MacArthur replied to the query of the Joint Chiefs,  [12] and on 4 July Admiral Nimitz made known his opinions. [13]  On the advancement of the target dates, both commanders were in  complete agreement--it was impossible unless certain conditions  could be changed. The logistic resources in the Southwest Pacific  were being strained to the limit to meet the fixed target dates,  while the strengthening of Japanese garrisons made it unlikely that  the Central Pacific could make its present scheduled dates.    With respect to bypassing objectives prior to the seizure of Formosa,  MacArthur thought it would be \"unsound\" to bypass the Philippines  and launch an attack across the Pacific directly against Formosa--an  attack which would have the benefit of no appreciable land-based  air support and which would be based upon the Hawaiian Islands,  5,100 miles away. In his opinion it was essential to occupy Luzon and  establish land-based aircraft thereon before making any move against  Formosa. [14] Nimitz stated that in a series of informal discussions  between his and MacArthur's planning officers, the latter anticipated  the seizure in early September of Morotai Island, 300 statute miles  southeast of Mindanao. This was to be followed in late October by a  limited occupation of the Sarangani Bay area on Mindanao, which was  to be used primarily as a base for short-range aircraft. The major  operation was to be the occupation of Leyte about 15 November. Nimitz  thought that this timing was \"optimistic.\" He felt that the critical  and decisive nature of the Leyte operation required \"practically all  available covering and striking forces, fire support forces, and all  available assault shipping.\" If successful, however, the Americans  would achieve air supremacy over the Philippines. Therefore, since  the inclusion of the Leyte operation with that of Mindanao would  expedite subsequent operations, Nimitz considered it \"advisable.\" [15]    As to the feasibility of bypassing present objectives and choosing  new ones, including the Japanese home islands, the two commanders were  not in complete agreement. MacArthur pronounced the concept \"utterly  unsound,\" since the available shipping was limited to a seven-division  lift and there was insufficient air support. Nimitz thought that no  decision should be made until after further developments.    The proposals disturbed General MacArthur, who concluded his message  to the Joint Chiefs with the following peroration:          It is my opinion that purely military considerations demand      the reoccupation of the Philippines in order to cut the enemy's      communications to the south and to secure a base for our further      advance. Even if this were not the case and unless military      factors demanded another line of action it would in my opinion      be necessary to reoccupy the Philippines.        The Philippines is American Territory where our unsupported forces      were destroyed by the enemy. Practically all of the 17,000,000      Filipinos remain loyal to the United States and are undergoing the      greatest privation and suffering because we have not been able      to support or succor them. We have a great national obligation      to discharge.        Moreover, if the United States should deliberately bypass the      Philippines, leaving our prisoners, nationals, and loyal Filipinos      in enemy hands without an effort to retrieve them at earliest      moment, we would incur the gravest psychological reaction. We      would admit the truth of Japanese propaganda to the effect that      we had abandoned the Filipinos and would not shed American blood      to redeem them; we would undoubtedly incur the open hostility      of that people; we would probably suffer such loss of prestige      among all the peoples of the Far East that it would adversely      affect the United States for many years.... [16]      In reply, General George C. Marshall, Chief of Staff, cautioned  MacArthur to \"be careful not to let personal feelings and Philippine  politics\" override the great objective, which was to end the  war. He also pointed out that \"bypassing\" was not \"synonymous with  abandonment.\" [17]    Admiral William F. Halsey, the commander of the Third Fleet, and his  staff, when they heard of the proposal, were enthusiastic about the  possibility of bypassing the more immediate objectives. But in contrast  to Admiral Ernest J. King, Chief of Naval Operations, who wished to  move directly to Formosa, bypassing the Philippines, Halsey felt it  necessary and profitable to go into the Philippine Archipelago, which  he considered to be \"the vulnerable belly of the Imperial dragon.\" [18]  Halsey stated that when Rear Adm. Robert B. Carney, his chief of staff,  was asked by King, \"Do you want to make a London out of Manila?\" Carney  replied, \"No, sir. I want to make an England out of Luzon.\" [19]    The Joint Chiefs of Staff concluded that none of the currently  selected objectives could be bypassed. They continued, however, to  search for means by which the tempo of the war in the Pacific might  be accelerated.    In the latter days of July, General Marshall invited General MacArthur  to visit Pearl Harbor in order to confer with Admiral Nimitz on future  plans for the war in the Pacific. MacArthur arrived on 26 July. To his  surprise, the President of the United States was present. President  Roosevelt invited him and Admirals Halsey and Nimitz to dinner. After  dinner the President drew out a map and, pointing to Leyte, is reported  to have said, \"Well, Douglas, where do we go from here?\" [20]    Although Mac Arthur had been given no intimation that strategy was  going to be discussed, he launched into a long talk on the necessity  of taking Luzon before moving against Formosa. Nimitz did not enter  into the conversation. The following morning the discussions were  continued. Admiral William D. Leahy, who was present, later declared:  \"Both General MacArthur and Admiral Nimitz felt that they did not  require any additional reinforcements or assistance\" for the scheduled  operations. [21] This Admiral Leahy considered most unusual.    Admiral Nimitz reported to Admiral King that the conferences \"were  quite satisfactory. The general trend of the discussion ... was along  the line of seeing MacArthur into the Central Philippines....\" [22]    There was no strong disagreement between General MacArthur and Admiral  Nimitz. Admiral Leahy said, \"I personally was convinced that they  together were the best qualified officers in our service for this  tremendous task, and that they could work together in full agreement  toward the common end of defeating Japan.\" [23]    Strong efforts were already under way to accelerate operations in the  Pacific. A shortage of shipping appeared to be the bottleneck which  halted all attempts to speed up the operational target dates. General  MacArthur at Brisbane had been directing the whole of his planning  toward the reoccupation of the Philippine Islands, and on 10 July had  issued a plan for all operations into the archipelago. According to  this plan the conquest of the Islands was to be accomplished in"]]]
