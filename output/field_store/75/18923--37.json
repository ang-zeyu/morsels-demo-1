All the world began to seem rose coloured to the ambitious boy, and he  started his life-work with enthusiasm. At that time he was thirteen  years old, full of hope and of love for his kind; but his good fortune  did not last long. He had hardly settled to work in Ghirlandajo's  studio than his genius, which should have made him beloved, made him  hated by his master. Angelo drew superior designs, created new  art-ideas, was more clever in all his undertakings than any other  pupil--even ahead of his master; and almost at once Ghirlandajo became  furiously jealous. This enmity between pupil and master was the  beginning of Angelo's many misfortunes.    One day he got into a dispute with a fellow student, Torregiano, who  broke his nose. This deformity alone was a tragedy to one like Michael  Angelo who loved everything beautiful, yet must go through life  knowing himself to be ill-favoured.    In height he was a little man, topped by an abnormally large head  which was part of the penalty he had to pay for his talents. He had a  great, broad forehead, and an eye that did not gleam nor express the  beauty of his creative mind, but was dull, and lustreless, matching  his broken, flattened nose. Indeed he was a tragedy to himself. In the  \"History of Painting\" Muther describes his unhappy disposition:    \"In his youthful years he never learned what love meant. 'If thou  wishest to conquer me,' in old age he addresses love, 'give me back my  features, from which nature has removed all beauty.' Whenever in his  sonnets he speaks of passion, it is always of pain and tears, of  sadness and unrequited longing, never of the fulfilment of his  wishes.\"    Then, too, Michael Angelo had a quarrelsome disposition, and he was  harsh in his criticism of others. He hated Leonardo da Vinci more for  his great physical beauty than for his genius. He quarreled with most  of his contemporaries, never joined the assemblies of his brother  artists, but dwelt altogether apart. His was a gloomy and melancholy  disposition and he never found relief outside his work.    He was all kinds of an artist--poet, sculptor, architect, painter--and  although he worked with the irregularity of true genius, he worked  indefatigably when once he began. It is said that when he was making  his \"David\" he never removed his clothing the whole time he was  employed upon the work, but dropped down when too exhausted to work  more, and slept wherever he fell.    His first flight from the workshop of Ghirlandajo was to the gardens  of the great Florentine prince, Lorenzo de' Medici, who had sent to  Ghirlandajo for two of his best pupils. He wished them to come to his  gardens and study the beautiful Greek statues which ornamented  them. The choice fell to Angelo and Granacci. Probably those statues  in Lorenzo's garden were the first glimpses of really great art that  Michael Angelo ever had. Certain it is that he was overwhelmed with  happiness when he was given permission to copy what he would, and at  once he fell to work with his chisel. His first work in that garden  was upon the head of an old faun; and Lorenzo, walking by, curious to  know to what use the lad was putting his opportunity, made a  criticism:    \"You have made your faun old,\" he said, \"yet you have left all the  teeth; at such an age, generally the teeth are wanting.\"    Angelo had nothing to say and the prince walked on, but when next he  came that way, he found that Angelo had broken off two of the faun's  teeth; and this recognition of his criticism pleased Lorenzo so much  that he invited Angelo to live with him. At first his father  objected. He felt himself to be an aristocrat, and sculpture and  painting were indeed low occupations for his son, who he had resolved  should be nothing less than a silk merchant. Nevertheless, the  prince's command, united with the son's pleading, compelled the father  to give up his cherished dream of making a merchant of him, and Angelo  went to live in the palace.    Then indeed what seemed a beautiful life opened out. He was dressed in  fine clothing, dined with princes, and possibly he was grateful to his  patron. Some historians say so, and add that when Lorenzo died Angelo  wept, and returned sadly to his father's house to mourn, but this tale  seems at odds with what else we know of Angelo's unangelic, envious  and bitter disposition. It is quite certain, however, that with the  death of Lorenzo, Angelo's, fortunes became greatly changed. Another  prince followed in line--Pietro de' Medici--but he was a poor thing,  who brought little good to anybody. He had small use for Michael  Angelo's genius, but it is said that he did give him one  commission. After a great storm one day, he asked him to make a  snow-man for him, and Angelo obligingly complied. It was doubtless a  very beautiful snow-man, but although it was Angelo's it melted in the  night, even as if it had been Johnny's or Tommy's snow-man, and left  no trace behind.    In Rome there was a high and haughty pope on the throne--Julius  II.--who had probably not his match for obstinacy and haughtiness,  excepting in the great painter and sculptor. When Angelo went to Rome,  he was bound to come in conflict with Julius for it was popes and  princes who gave art any reason for being in those days, and the  Church prescribed what kind of art should be cultivated. Michael was  to come directly under the command of the pope and such a combination  promised trouble. Kings themselves had to remove their crowns and hats  to Julius, and why not Michael Angelo? Yet there he stood, covered,  before the pope, opposing his greatness to that of the pope. Soderini  says that Angelo treated the pope as the king of France never would  have dared treat him; but Angelo may have known that kings of France  might be born and die, times without number, while there would never  be born another Michael Angelo. There could be nothing but antagonism  between Angelo and Julius, and soon after the artist returned to  Florence; but the necessity for following his profession enabled  Julius to tame him after all, and it is said that the pope led him  back to Rome, later, \"with a halter about his neck.\" This must have  been agony to Angelo.    Back in Rome, he was commissioned to make a tomb for the pope. He had  no sooner set about the preliminaries--the getting of suitable marble  for his work--than he began to quarrel with the men who were to hew  it. When that difficulty was settled, and the marble was got out, he  had a set-to with the shipowners who were to transport the stone, and  that row became so serious that the sculptor was besieged in his own  house.    At another and later time, when he was engaged upon the frescoes of  the Sistine Chapel, he was made to work by force. He accused the man  who had built the scaffolding upon which he must stand, or lie, to  paint, of planning his destruction. He suspected the very assistants  whom he, himself, had chosen to go from Florence, of having designs  upon his life. He locked the chapel against them, and they had to turn  away when they went to begin work. Because of his insane suspicion he  did alone the enormous work of the frescoes. Doubtless he was half  mad, just as he was wholly a genius.    By the time he had finished those frescoes he was so exhausted and  overworked that he wrote piteously to his people at home, \"I have not  a friend in Rome, neither do I wish nor have use for any.\" This of  course was not true; or he would not have made the statement. \"I  hardly find time to take nourishment. Not an ounce more can I bear  than already rests upon my shoulders.\" Even when the work was done he  felt no happiness because of it, but complained about everything and  everybody.    If Angelo thought this an unhappy day, worse was in store for  him. Julius II. died and in his place there came to reign upon the  papal throne, Leo X. If Michael Angelo had been restricted in his work  before, he was almost jailed under Leo X. Julius had been a virile,  forceful man, and Michael Angelo was the same. Since he must be  restrained and dictated to, it was possible for the artist to listen  to a man who was in certain respects strong like himself, but to be  under the thumb of a weak, effeminate person like Leo, was the tragedy  of tragedies to Angelo. That was a marvellous time in Rome. All its  citizens had become so pleasure-loving that the world, stood still to  wonder. When the pope banqueted, he had the golden plates from which  fair women had eaten hurled into the Tiber, that they might never be  profaned by a less noble use than they had known. From all this riot  and madness of pleasure, Michael Angelo stood aside with frowning brow  and scornful mien. He approved of nothing and of nobody--despising  even Raphael, the gentle and loving man whom the pleasure-crazed  people of Rome paused to smile upon and love. The pope said that  Angelo was \"terrible,\" and that he filled everybody with fear.    Finally, Rome so resented his frowning looks and his surly ways that  work was provided for him at a distance. He was sent to Florence again  to build a facade. While there, the city was conquered, and Angelo was  one who fought for its freedom, but even so, he fled just at the  crisis. Thus he ever did the wrong thing--excepting when he worked. In  Florence he had planned to do mighty things, but he never accomplished  any one of them. He planned to make a wonderful colossal statue on a  cliff near Carrara, and also he resolved to make the tomb of Julius  the nucleus of a \"forest of statues.\"    Michael Angelo never married, but he was burdened with a family and  all its cares. He supported his brothers and even his nephews, and  took care of his father. All of those people came to him with their  difficulties and with their demands for money.

Within, on both sides, were wide scaffolds, four feet  from the floor, and extending the entire length of the house, like the  seats of a colossal omnibus. [9] These were formed of thick sheets of  bark, supported by posts and transverse poles, and covered with mats and  skins. Here, in summer, was the sleeping-place of the inmates, and the  space beneath served for storage of their firewood. The fires were on  the ground, in a line down the middle of the house. Each sufficed for  two families, who, in winter, slept closely packed around them. Above,  just under the vaulted roof, were a great number of poles, like the  perches of a hen-roost, and here were suspended weapons, clothing,  skins, and ornaments. Here, too, in harvest time, the squaws hung the  ears of unshelled corn, till the rude abode, through all its length,  seemed decked with a golden tapestry. In general, however, its only  lining was a thick coating of soot from the smoke of fires with neither  draught, chimney, nor window. So pungent was the smoke, that it produced  inflammation of the eyes, attended in old age with frequent blindness.  Another annoyance was the fleas; and a third, the unbridled and unruly  children. Privacy there was none. The house was one chamber, sometimes  lodging more than twenty families. [10]    [7] The permanent bark villages of the Dahcotah of the St. Peter's are  the nearest modern approach to the Huron towns. The whole Huron country  abounds with evidences of having been occupied by a numerous population.  \"On a close inspection of the forest,\" Dr. TachÃ© writes to me, \"the  greatest part of it seems to have been cleared at former periods, and  almost the only places bearing the character of the primitive forest are  the low grounds.\"    [8] BrÃ©beuf, Relation des Hurons, 1635, 31. Champlain says that he saw  them, in 1615, more than thirty fathoms long; while Vanderdonck reports  the length, from actual measurement, of an Iroquois house, at a hundred  and eighty yards, or five hundred and forty feet!    [9] Often, especially among the Iroquois, the internal arrangement was  different. The scaffolds or platforms were raised only a foot from the  earthen floor, and were only twelve or thirteen feet long, with  intervening spaces, where the occupants stored their family provisions  and other articles. Five or six feet above was another platform, often  occupied by children. One pair of platforms sufficed for a family, and  here during summer they slept pellmell, in the clothes they wore by day,  and without pillows.    [10] One of the best descriptions of the Huron and Iroquois houses is  that of Sagard, Voyage des Hurons, 118. See also Champlain (1627), 78;  BrÃ©beuf, Relation des Hurons, 1635, 31; Vanderdonck, New Netherlands, in  N. Y. Hist. Coll., Second Ser., I. 196; Lafitau, MÅurs des Sauvages, II.  10. The account given by Cartier of the houses he saw at Montreal  corresponds with the above. He describes them as about fifty yards long.  In this case, there were partial partitions for the several families,  and a sort of loft above. Many of the Iroquois and Huron houses were of  similar construction, the partitions being at the sides only, leaving a  wide passage down the middle of the house. Bartram, Observations on a  Journey from Pennsylvania to Canada, gives a description and plan of the  Iroquois Council-House in 1751, which was of this construction. Indeed,  the Iroquois preserved this mode of building, in all essential points,  down to a recent period. They usually framed the sides of their houses  on rows of upright posts, arched with separate poles for the roof. The  Hurons, no doubt, did the same in their larger structures. For a door,  there was a sheet of bark hung on wooden hinges, or suspended by cords  from above.    On the site of Huron towns which were destroyed by fire, the size,  shape, and arrangement of the houses can still, in some instances, be  traced by remains in the form of charcoal, as well as by the charred  bones and fragments of pottery found among the ashes.    Dr. TachÃ©, after a zealous and minute examination of the Huron country,  extended through five years, writes to me as follows. \"From the remains  I have found, I can vouch for the scrupulous correctness of our ancient  writers. With the aid of their indications and descriptions, I have been  able to detect the sites of villages in the midst of the forest, and by  time study, in situ, of archÃ¦ological monuments, small as they are, to  understand and confirm their many interesting details of the habits, and  especially the funeral rites, of these extraordinary tribes.\"    He who entered on a winter night beheld a strange spectacle: the vista  of fires lighting the smoky concave; the bronzed groups encircling  each,--cooking, eating, gambling, or amusing themselves with idle  badinage; shrivelled squaws, hideous with threescore years of hardship;  grisly old warriors, scarred with Iroquois war-clubs; young aspirants,  whose honors were yet to be won; damsels gay with ochre and wampum;  restless children pellmell with restless dogs. Now a tongue of resinous  flame painted each wild feature in vivid light; now the fitful gleam  expired, and the group vanished from sight, as their nation has vanished  from history.    The fortified towns of the Hurons were all on the side exposed to  Iroquois incursions. The fortifications of all this family of tribes  were, like their dwellings, in essential points alike. A situation was  chosen favorable to defence,--the bank of a lake, the crown of a  difficult hill, or a high point of land in the fork of confluent rivers.  A ditch, several feet deep, was dug around the village, and the earth  thrown up on the inside. Trees were then felled by an alternate process  of burning and hacking the burnt part with stone hatchets, and by  similar means were cut into lengths to form palisades. These were  planted on the embankment, in one, two, three, or four concentric  rows,--those of each row inclining towards those of the other rows until  they intersected. The whole was lined within, to the height of a man,  with heavy sheets of bark; and at the top, where the palisades crossed,  was a gallery of timber for the defenders, together with wooden gutters,  by which streams of water could be poured down on fires kindled by the  enemy. Magazines of stones, and rude ladders for mounting the rampart,  completed the provision for defence. The forts of the Iroquois were  stronger and more elaborate than those of the Hurons; and to this day  large districts in New York are marked with frequent remains of their  ditches and embankments. [11]    [11] There is no mathematical regularity in these works. In their form,  the builders were guided merely by the nature of the ground. Frequently  a precipice or river sufficed for partial defence, and the line of  embankment occurs only on one or two sides. In one instance, distinct  traces of a double line of palisades are visible along the embankment.  (See Squier, Aboriginal Monuments of New York, 38.) It is probable that  the palisade was planted first, and the earth heaped around it. Indeed,  this is stated by the Tuscarora Indian, Cusick, in his curious History  of the Six Nations (Iroquois). BrÃ©beuf says, that as early as 1636 the  Jesuits taught the Hurons to build rectangular palisaded works, with  bastions. The Iroquois adopted the same practice at an early period,  omitting the ditch and embankment; and it is probable, that, even in  their primitive defences, the palisades, where the ground was of a  nature to yield easily to their rude implements, were planted simply in  holes dug for the purpose. Such seems to have been the Iroquois fortress  attacked by Champlain in 1615.    The Muscogees, with other Southern tribes, and occasionally the  Algonquins, had palisaded towns; but the palisades were usually but a  single row, planted upright. The tribes of Virginia occasionally  surrounded their dwellings with a triple palisade.--Beverly, History of  Virginia, 149.    Among these tribes there was no individual ownership of land, but each  family had for the time exclusive right to as much as it saw fit to  cultivate. The clearing process--a most toilsome one--consisted in  hacking off branches, piling them together with brushwood around the  foot of the standing trunks, and setting fire to the whole. The squaws,  working with their hoes of wood and bone among the charred stumps, sowed  their corn, beans, pumpkins, tobacco, sunflowers, and Huron hemp. No  manure was used; but, at intervals of from ten to thirty years, when the  soil was exhausted, and firewood distant, the village was abandoned and  a new one built.    There was little game in the Huron country; and here, as among the  Iroquois, the staple of food was Indian corn, cooked without salt in a  variety of forms, each more odious than the last. Venison was a luxury  found only at feasts; dog-flesh was in high esteem; and, in some of the  towns captive bears were fattened for festive occasions. These tribes  were far less improvident than the roving Algonquins, and stores of  provision were laid up against a season of want. Their main stock of  corn was buried in caches, or deep holes in the earth, either within or  without the houses.    In respect to the arts of life, all these stationary tribes were in  advance of the wandering hunters of the North. The women made a species  of earthen pot for cooking, but these were supplanted by the copper  kettles of the French traders. They wove rush mats with no little skill.  They spun twine from hemp, by the primitive process of rolling it on  their thighs; and of this twine they made nets. They extracted oil from  fish and from the seeds of the sunflower,--the latter, apparently, only  for the purposes of the toilet. They pounded their maize in huge mortars  of wood, hollowed by alternate burnings and scrapings. Their stone axes,  spear "]]]
