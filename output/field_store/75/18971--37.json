[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7937"],[0,"Journal of an African Cruiser (#4)"],[1,"the past year. The profits accruing from thence, however, are very  inadequate to the comfortable support of the inhabitants. The adults are  mostly covered with rags, while many of the children are entirely naked;  the cats and dogs (whose condition may be taken as no bad test of the  degree of bodily comfort in the community) are lean and skeleton-like. As  to religion, I saw nothing to remind me of it, except the ruins of an old  church. There has been no priest since the death of one who was drowned, a  few years ago, near Bird Island, a large rock, at the mouth of the harbor.  At the time of this fatal mishap, the reverend father was on a drunken  frolic, in company with some colored women.    The Cape de Verd Islands derive their name from the nearest point of the  mainland of Africa; they are under the dominion of Portugal, and,  notwithstanding their poverty, furnish a considerable revenue to that  country, over and above the expenses of the Colonial Government. This  revenue comes chiefly from the duties levied upon all imported articles,  and from the orchilla trade, which is monopolized by the Government at  home, and produces 50,000 dollars per annum. Another source of profit is  found in the tithes for the support of the Church, which, in some, if not  all the islands, have been seized by the Government (under a pledge for  the maintenance of the clergy), and are farmed out annually. These islands  supply the Portuguese with a place of honorable exile for officers who may  be suspected of heresy in politics, and hostility to existing  institutions. They are advanced a step in rank, to repay them (and a poor  requital it is) for the change from the delicious climate of Portugal, and  the gaieties of Lisbon, to the dreary solitude, the arid soil, and burning  and fever-laden air of the Cape de Verds. It is a melancholy thought, that  many an active intellect--many a generous and aspiring spirit--may have  been doomed to linger and perish here, chained, as it were, to the rocks,  like Prometheus, merely for having dreamed of kindling the fire of liberty  in their native land.    22.--We have spent some days at Porto Praya, the capital of St. Jago, the  largest of the Cape de Verd islands; whence we sail to-day. A large part  of the population is composed of negroes and mulattoes, whose appearance  indicates that they are intemperate, dissolute, and vile. The Portuguese  residing here are generally but little better; as may be supposed from the  fact, that most of those who were not banished from Portugal, for  political or other offences, came originally to engage in the slave-trade.    Going ashore to-day, we beached the boat, and a large negro, with a ragged  red shirt, waded out and took me on his shoulders. There is no position so  absurd, nor in which a man feels himself so utterly helpless, as when thus  dependant on the strength and sure-footedness of a fellow-biped. As we  left the boat, a heavy \"roller\" came in. The negro lost his footing, and I  my balance, and down we plunged into the surf. My sable friend seemed to  consider it a point of duty to hold stoutly by my legs, the inevitable  tendency of which manoeuvre was to keep my head under water. Having no  taste for a watery death, under these peculiar circumstances, I freed  myself by a vigorous kick, sprang to my feet, and seizing the negro by the  \"ambrosial curls,\" pushed his head in turn under the surf. But seeing the  midshipmen and boat's crew laughing, noiselessly but heartily, at my  expense, the ludicrousness of the whole affair struck me so forcibly that  I joined in their mirth, and waded ashore as fast as possible. An  abolitionist, perhaps, might draw a moral from the story, and say that  all, who ride on the shoulders of the African race, deserve nothing better  than a similar overthrow. Sailed from Porto Praya. The bay of this port is  a good one, except in south-east gales, when the anchorage is dangerous.  The town, called Villa de Praya, contains about two thousand inhabitants  of every shade, the dark greatly predominating. Many vessels from Europe  and the United States, bound to India, Brazil, or Africa, find this a  convenient place to procure water and fresh provisions, and bring, in  return, much money into the city. There are three hundred troops here,  nearly all black, and commanded by forty Portuguese officers. The men are  under severe discipline, are tolerably well dressed, and make a soldierly  appearance. It is said that a St. Jago soldier formerly wore only a cocked  hat, being otherwise in a state of nature; but I cannot pretend to have  seen any instance of this extreme scantiness of equipment.    23.--Saw a large green turtle asleep on the surface of the water. One of  our boats went alongside of him, and two men attempted to turn him over  with boat-hooks. He struggled successfully, however, to keep himself  \"right side up,\" and, in a few moments, plunged beneath the surface. Once  upon his back, he would have been powerless and a prisoner, and we might  have hoped for the advantage of his presence at our mess-table.    24.--At noon, the first rain came. It continued heavy and unremitting, for  twenty-four hours, after which there was a glimpse of the blue sky. Two  startling thunder-claps burst over the ship, at about 9 o'clock, A.M. Last  night, at 10, a heavy plunge carried away both our chain bobstays at once,  and all hands were turned up in the rain, to secure the bowsprit.    The sanitary regulations of the squadron, induced by the commencement of  the rainy season, cause considerable mirth and some growling. One rule is,  that every man shall protect himself with flannel next his person, and at  night shall also wear a cloth-jacket and trowsers. Stoves are placed on  the berth-deck, to dry the atmosphere below. It is a curious fact, that,  in March last, at Portsmouth, N. H., with the thermometer at zero, we were  deprived of stoves the moment the powder came on board; while now in the  month of July, on the coast of Africa, sweltering at eighty degrees of  Fahrenheit, the fires are lighted throughout the ship.    27.--Continual rain for the last three days. All miserable, but getting  used to it.    29.--A clear day, and comfortably cool. Wind fair.    30.--Made land, and saw an English brig of war. Commander Oakes, of the  Ferret, came on board.    31.--Made Cape Mount.    _August_ 1.--At 12, meridian, anchored at Cape Mesurado, off the town of  Monrovia. We find at anchor here the U. S. brig Porpoise, and a French  barque, as well as a small schooner, bearing the Liberian flag. This  consists of stripes and a cross, and may be regarded as emblematical of  the American origin of the colony, and of the Christian philanthropy to  which it owes its existence. Thirty or forty Kroomen came alongside. Three  officers of the Porpoise visited us. All are anxious to get back to the  United States. They coincide, however, in saying that, with simple  precautions, the health of this station is as good as that of any other.  They have had only a single case of fever on board; and, in that instance,  the patient was a man who ran away, and spent a night ashore.    My old acquaintance, Captain Cooper, came on board, and is to be employed  as pilot.          CHAPTER III.    Visit of Governor Roberts, &c.--Arrival at Cape Palmas--American  Missionaries--Prosperity of the Catholic Mission--King Freeman, and his  royal robe--Customs of the Kroo-people--Condition of native women.      _August_ 2.--We were visited by Governor Roberts, Doctor Day, and General  Lewis, the latter being colonial secretary, and military chief of the  settlement. They looked well, and welcomed me back to Liberia with the  cordiality of old friendship. The Governor was received by the commodore,  captain, and officers, and saluted with eleven guns. He and his suite  dined in the cabin, and some of the officers of the Porpoise in the  ward-room. In the evening, we brought out all our forces for the amusement  of our distinguished guests. First, the negro band sang \"Old Dan Tucker,\"  \"Jim along Josey,\" and other ditties of the same class, accompanied by  violin and tambourine. Then Othello played monkey, and gave a series of  recitations. The French cook sang with great spirit and skill. The  entertainments of the evening, as the theatrical bills expressed it,  concluded with Ma Normandie and other beautiful songs and airs well  executed by the French cook, accompanied by Symmes on the violin, and a  landsman on the flute.    5.--Sailed for Cape Palmas, in company with the Porpoise.    9.--Anchored at Cape Palmas. We were boarded by Kroo-men, in eight or ten  canoes. While the thermometer stood at 75 or 80 degrees, these naked  boatmen were shivering, and seemed absolutely to suffer with cold; and  such is the effect of the climate upon our own physical systems, that we  find woollen garments comfortable at the same temperature.    Visited and lunched with Governor Rasswurm. Called on Mr. James, a colored  missionary, now occupying the house of Mr. Wilson, who has lately removed  to Gaboon river. Mr. James presented us with some ebony, and a few Grebo  books. He informed us that the fever had visited him more or less  severely, as often as once in four weeks during seven years. This may  truly be called a feverish life! He is about to remove to Gaboon.    The Catholic Mission seems to have driven the Presbyterian from the  ground. We called on Mr. Kelly, a Catholic priest from Baltimore, and the  only white man of the Mission at present in Africa. Preparations, however,  have already been made for twenty more, principally French, whose arrival  is expected within a year, and who will establish themselves at different  points along the coast. Mr. Kelly is now finishing a very commodious  house, on a scale of some magnitude, with piazzas around the whole. There  is evidently no lack of money. The funds for the support of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7947"],[0,"The Diary of a U-boat Commander (#4)"],[1,"plough-boys is  repellent. However, the Von Schenks have never been too proud to obey  in order to learn how to command.           *       *       *       *       *    I have been appointed second in command to U.C.47. Her captain is one  Max Alten by name. Beyond the fact that I saw him drunk one night in  the Mess I know nothing of him.    I reported to him and he seems rather in awe of me. His fears are  groundless.    I shall make it as easy as possible for him, for it must be as awkward  for him as it is unpleasant for me.    To celebrate my proper entry into the U-boat service, I gave a dinner  party last night in a private room at \"Le Coq d'Or.\" I asked Karl and  Adolf, and told them to bring three girls. My opposite number was a  lovely girl called Zoe something or other. I wore my \"smoking\" for the  first time; it is certainly a becoming costume.    We drank a good deal of champagne and had a very pleasant little  debauch; the girls got very merry, and I kissed Zoe once. She was not  very angry. I think she is thoroughly charming, and I have accepted an  invitation to take tea at her flat. She is either the wife or the chere  amie of a colonel in the Brandenburgers, I could not make out which.  Luckily the gallant \"Cockchafer\" is at the moment on the La Bassee  sector, where I was interested to observe that heavy fighting has  broken out to-day. I must console the fair Zoe!    Both Karl and Adolf got rather drunk, Adolf hopelessly so, but I, as  usual, was hardly affected. I have a head of iron, provided the liquor  is good, and _I_ saw to that point.           *       *       *       *       *    We were sailing, or rather going down the canal to Zeebrugge on Friday,  but the starting resistance of the port main motor burnt out and we  were delayed till Sunday, as they will fit a new one.    I must confess the organization for repair work here is admirable, as  very little is done by the crews in the U-boats, all work being carried  out by the permanent staff, who are quartered at Bruges docks. Taking  advantage of the delay I called on Zoe Stein, as I find she is named.    It appears she is _not_ married to Colonel Stein. She told me he was  fat and ugly, and laughed a good deal about him. She showed me his  photograph, and certainly he is no beauty. However, he must be a man of  means, as he has given her a charming flat, beautifully decorated with  water-colours which the Colonel salved from the French chateau in the  early days--these army fellows had all the chances.    I bade an affectionate farewell to Zoe, and I trust Stein will be still  busily engaged at La Bassee when I return in a fortnight's time! I am  greatly obliged to Karl for the introduction, and told him so; he  himself is running after a little grass widow whose husband has been  missing for some months. I think Karl finds it an expensive game;  luckily Zoe seems well supplied with money--the essential ingredient in  a joyous life.    On Friday night we had an air-raid--a frequent event here, but my first  experience in this line. Unpleasant, but a fine spectacle, considerable  damage done near the docks and an unexploded bomb fell in a street near  our headquarters.    Two machines (British) brought down in flames. I saw the green balls  [1] for the first time. A most fascinating sight to see them floating  up in waving chains into the vault of heaven; they reminded me of  making daisy chains as a child.    [Footnote 1: Known as \"Flying-onions.\"]          _At Zeebrugge_.      We are alongside the mole in one of the new submarine shelters that has  been built.    The boat is under a concrete roof over three feet thick, which would  defy the heaviest bomb.    We have much improved the port since our arrival. The port, so-called,  is purely artificial, and actually consists of a long mole with a  gentle curve in it, which reaches out to seaward and protects the mouth  of the canal. The tides are very strong up and down the coast, and  constant dredging is carried out to keep 20 feet of water over the sill  at the lock gates.    On arrival last night we went straight into No. 11 shelter, as an  air-raid was expected, but nothing happened, so I went up to the  \"Flandre,\" which seems to be the best hotel here, full of submarine  people, and I heard many interesting stories. There seems no doubt this  U-boat war is dangerous work; I find the U.C. boats are beginning to be  called the Suicide Club, after the famous English story of that name,  which, curiously enough, I saw on the kinematograph at Frankfurt last  leave. We Germans are extraordinarily broad-minded; I doubt if the  works of German authors are seen on the screens in England or France.    The news from the West is good, the English are hurling themselves to  destruction against our steel front. We are now to load up with mines.  I must stop writing to superintend this work.          _At sea. Near the South Dogger Light._      We loaded up the ten mines we carry in an hour and five minutes. They  were lifted from a railway truck by a big crane and delicately lowered  into the mine tubes, of which we have five in the bows.    The tubes extend from the upper deck of the ship to her keel, and slope  aft to facilitate release. Having completed with fuel at Bruges, we  took in a store of provisions and Alten went up to the Commodore's  office to get our sailing orders.    We sailed at 6 p.m. and at last I felt I was off. To-day, the 22nd, we  are just north of the South Dogger, steering north-westerly at 9-1/2  knots.    The sea is quite calm and everything is very pleasant. Our mission is  to lay a small minefield off Newcastle in the East Coast war channel. I  have, of course, never been to sea for any length of time in a U-boat,  and it is all very novel.    I find the roar of the Diesel engine very relentless, and last night  slept badly in a wretched bunk, which was a poor substitute for my  lovely quarters in the barracks at Wilhelmshaven. One thing I  appreciate, and that is the food; it is really excellent: fresh milk,  fresh butter, white bread and many other luxuries.    I have spent most of the day picking up things about the boat. Her  general arrangement is as follows:    Starting in the bows, mine tubes occupy the centre of the boat, leaving  two narrow passages, one each side. In the port passage is the wireless  cabinet and signal flag lockers, with store rooms underneath. In the  starboard passage are one or two small pumps and the kitchen.    The next compartment contains four bunks, two each side, these are  occupied by Alten, myself, the engineer, and the Navigating Warrant  Officer. Proceeding further aft one enters the control room, in which  one periscope is situated, and the necessary valves and pumps for  diving the boat.    The next compartment is the crew space; ten of the company exist here.    Overhead on each side is the gear for releasing the torpedoes from the  external torpedo tubes, of which we carry one each side. I think we  borrowed this idea from the Russians.    Then comes the engine-room, an inferno of rattling noises, but  excellent engines, I believe. At the after end of the engine-room are  the two main switchboards, of whose manner of working I am at present  in some ignorance.    The two main sets of electric motors are underneath the boards, in the  stern, where we have a third torpedo tube.           *       *       *       *       *    I had hardly written the above words when a message came that the  captain would like me to come to the bridge.    I went up in a leisurely fashion, through the conning tower, which is  over the control room, and reported myself. He indicated a low-lying  patch of smoke on the horizon far away on the starboard bow. I was  obliged to confess that it conveyed nothing to me, when he aroused my  intense interest by stating that it was, without doubt, being emitted  from a British submarine, who are known to frequent these waters. He  was proceeding away from us, and was, even then, six or seven miles  away, so an attack was out of the question. The engineer, who had  joined us, drew my attention to the thin wisp of almost invisible  blue-grey smoke from our own stern. The contrast was certainly  striking!    Over dinner I gave it as my opinion that the British boats were pretty  useless. Alten would not agree, and stated that, though in certain  technical aspects they were in a position of inferiority, yet in  personnel and skill in attacking they were fully our equals. He seemed  to hold them in considerable respect, and he remarked that, when making  a passage, he was more anxious on their account than in any other way.  He informed me that, on the last passage he made, he was attacked by a  British boat which he never saw, the only indication he received being  a torpedo which jumped out of the water almost over his tail. Luckily  it was very rough at the time, which made the torpedo run erratically,  otherwise they would undoubtedly have been hit.    What appeared to astonish him was the fact that the British boat had  been able to make an attack in such weather. We are now charging on one  engine, 500 amperes on each half-battery.           *       *       *       *       *    We are due back at Zeebrugge at 10 p.m. to-night. We should have been  in at dawn to-day, but we received a wireless from the senior officer,  Zeebrugge, to say that mine-laying was suspected, and we were to wait  till the \"Q.R.\" channel, from the Blankenberg buoy, had been swept. We  lay in the bottom for eight hours, a few miles from the western end of  the channel.    Our trip was quite successful, but not without certain excitements.    On the night of the 23rd we passed fairly close to a fishing fleet on  the Dogger Bank, and saw the lights of several steamers in the  distance. As our first business was to lay our mines in the appointed  place, we did not worry them.    We burnt usual navigation lights, or rather"]]]
