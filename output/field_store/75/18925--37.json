The Sieur de Treslong has given me  a purse to pay for all that you can sell us, but thinking that you  might be blamed for having dealings with him by the authorities of  the town, he sent these armed men with me in order that if questioned  you could reply that they came forcibly on board.\"    \"I will willingly let you have all the provisions I have on board,\"  Captain Martin said; \"though these will go but a little way among  so many, seeing that I only carry stores sufficient for consumption  on board during my voyages.\"    A cask of salt beef was hoisted up on deck, with a sack of biscuits,  four cheeses, and a side of bacon. Captain Martin refused any  payment.    \"No,\" he said, \"my wife comes from these parts, and my heart is with  the patriots. Will you tell Sieur de Treslong that Captain Martin  of the Good Venture is happy to do the best in his power for him  and his brave followers. That, Ned,\" he observed, turning to his  son as the boat rowed away, \"is a stroke of good policy. The value  of the goods is small, but just at this moment they are worth much  to those to whom I have given them. In the first place, you see,  we have given aid to the good cause, in the second we have earned  the gratitude of the beggars of the sea, and I shall be much more  comfortable if I run among them in the future than I should have  done in the past. The freedom to come and go without molestation  by the sea beggars is cheaply purchased at the price of provisions  which do not cost many crowns.\"    On regaining the Sieur de Treslong's ship some of the provisions  were at once served out among the men, and the rest sent off among  other ships, and William de Blois took Koppelstok with him on board  the admiral's vessel.    \"Well, De Blois, what do you counsel in this extremity?\" De la  Marck asked.    \"I advise,\" the Lord of Treslong replied, \"that we at once send a  message to the town demanding its surrender.\"    \"Are you joking or mad, Treslong?\" the admiral asked in surprise.  \"Why, we can scarce muster four hundred men, and the town is well  walled and fortified.\"    \"There are no Spanish troops here, admiral, and if we put a bold  front on the matter we may frighten the burghers into submission.  This man says he would be willing to carry the summons. He says the  news as to who we are has already reached them by some passengers  he landed before he came out, and he doubts not they are in a rare  panic.\"    \"Well, we can try,\" the admiral said, laughing; \"it is clear we  must eat, even if we have to fight for it; and hungry as we all  are, we do not want to wait.\"    Treslong gave his ring to Koppelstok to show as his authority, and  the fisherman at once rowed ashore. Stating that the beggars of  the sea were determined to take the town, he made his way through  the crowd of inhabitants who had assembled at the landing place,  and then pushed on to the town hall, where the magistrates were  assembled. He informed them that he had been sent by the Admiral of  the Fleet and the Lord of Treslong, who was well known to them, to  demand that two commissioners should be sent out to them on behalf  of the city to confer with him. The only object of those who sent  him was to free the land from the crushing taxes, and to overthrow  the tyranny of Alva and the Spaniards. He was asked by the magistrates  what force De la Marck had at his disposal, and replied carelessly  that he could not say exactly, but that there might be five thousand  in all.    This statement completed the dismay that had been caused at the  arrival of the fleet. The magistrates agreed that it would be madness  to resist, and determined to fly at once. With much difficulty two  of them were persuaded to go out to the ship as deputies, and as  soon as they set off most of the leading burghers prepared instantly  for flight. The deputies on arriving on board were assured that no  injury was intended to the citizens or private property, but only  the overthrow of Alva's government, and two hours were given them  to decide upon the surrender of the town.    During this two hours almost all the inhabitants left the town,  taking with them their most valuable property. At the expiration of  the time the beggars landed. A few of those remaining in the city  made a faint attempt at resistance; but Treslong forced an entrance  by the southern gate, and De la Marck made a bonfire against the  northern gate and then battered it down with the end of an old  mast. Thus the patriots achieved the capture of the first town, and  commenced the long war that was to end only with the establishment  of the Free Republic of the Netherlands. No harm was done to such  of the inhabitants of the town as remained. The conquerors established  themselves in the best of the deserted houses; they then set to work  to plunder the churches. The altars and images were all destroyed;  the rich furniture, the sacred vessels, and the gorgeous vestments  were appropriated to private use. Thirteen unfortunates, among  them some priests who had been unable to effect their escape, were  seized and put to death by De la Marck.    He had received the strictest orders from the Prince of Orange to  respect the ships of all neutral nations, and to behave courteously  and kindly to all captives he might take. Neither of these injunctions  were obeyed. De la Marck was a wild and sanguinary noble; he had  taken a vow upon hearing of the death of his relative, the Prince  of Egmont, who had been executed by Alva, that he would neither  cut his hair nor his beard until that murder should be revenged,  and had sworn to wreak upon Alva and upon Popery the deep vengeance  that the nobles and peoples of the Netherlands owed them. This vow  he kept to the letter, and his ferocious conduct to all priests  and Spaniards who fell into his hands deeply sullied the cause for  which he fought.    Upon the day after the capture of the city, the Good Venture went  into the port. The inhabitants, as soon as they learned that the  beggars of the sea respected the life and property of the citizens,  returned in large numbers, and trade was soon re-established.  Having taken the place, and secured the plunder of the churches  and monasteries, De la Marck would have sailed away upon other  excursions had not the Sieur de Treslong pointed out to him the  importance of Brill to the cause, and persuaded him to hold the  place until he heard from the Prince of Orange.        CHAPTER II    TERRIBLE NEWS      A few days after Brill had been so boldly captured, Count Bossu  advanced from Utrecht against it. The sea beggars, confident as  they were as to their power of meeting the Spaniards on the seas,  knew that on dry land they were no match for the well trained  pikemen; they therefore kept within the walls. A carpenter, however,  belonging to the town, who had long been a secret partisan of the  Prince of Orange, seized an axe, dashed into the water, and swam  to the sluice and burst open the gates with a few sturdy blows.  The sea poured in and speedily covered the land on the north side  of the city.    The Spaniards advanced along the dyke to the southern gate, but  the sea beggars had hastily moved most of the cannon on the wall  to that point, and received the Spaniards with so hot a fire that  they hesitated. In the meantime the Lord of Treslong and another  officer had filled two boats with men and rowed out to the ships  that had brought the enemy, cut some adrift, and set others on fire.  The Spaniards at the southern gate lost heart; they were exposed  to a hot fire, which they were unable to return. On one side they  saw the water rapidly rising above the level of the dyke on which  they stood, on the other they perceived their only means of retreat  threatened. They turned, and in desperate haste retreated along  the causeway now under water. In their haste many slipped off the  road and were drowned, others fell and were smothered in the water,  and the rest succeeded in reaching such of the vessels as were  still untouched, and with all speed returned to Utrecht.    From the highest point of the masts to which they could climb,  Captain Martin, Ned, and the crew watched the struggle. Ned had  begged his father to let him go along the walls to the south gate  to see the conflict, but Captain Martin refused.    \"We know not what the upshot of the business may be,\" he said. \"If  the Spaniards, which is likely enough, take the place, they will  slaughter all they meet, and will not trouble themselves with  questioning anyone whether he is a combatant or a spectator. Besides,  when they have once taken the town, they will question all here,  and it would be well that I should be able to say that not only  did we hold ourselves neutral in the affair, but that none of my  equipage had set foot on shore today. Lastly, it is my purpose and  hope if the Spaniards capture the place, to take advantage of the  fact that all will be absorbed in the work of plunder, and to slip  my hawsers and make off. Wind and tide are both favourable, and  doubtless the crews of their ships will, for the most part, land  to take part in the sack as soon as the town is taken.\"    However, as it turned out, there was no need of these precautions;  the beggars were victorious and the Spaniards in full flight,  and great was the rejoicing in Brill at this check which they had  inflicted upon their oppressors. Bossu, retiring from Brill, took  his way towards Rotterdam. He found its gates closed; the authorities  refused to submit to his demands or to admit a garrison. They  declared they were perfectly loyal, and needed no body of Spanish  troops to keep them in order. Bossu requested permission for his  troops to pass through the city without halting. This was granted  by the magistrates on condition that only a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6955"],[0,"The Prince and Betty (#4)"],[1,"r, suppose you got up one day and found it was a  perfectly bully morning, and remembered that the Giants were playing  the Athletics, and looked at your mail, and saw that someone had sent  you a pass for the game--\"    \"Were you at the ball-game? You've got the nerve! Didn't you know there  would be trouble?\"    \"Old man,\" said John frankly, \"I could no more have turned down that  pass-- Oh, well, what's the use? It was just great. I suppose I'd  better tackle the boss now. It's got to be done.\"    It was not a task to which many would have looked forward. Most of  those who came into contact with Andrew Westley were afraid of him. He  was a capable rather than a lovable man, and too self-controlled to be  quite human. There was no recoil in him, no reaction after anger, as  there would have been in a hotter-tempered man. He thought before he  acted, but, when he acted, never yielded a step.    John, in all the years of their connection, had never been able to make  anything of him. At first, he had been prepared to like him, as he  liked nearly everybody. But Mr. Westley had discouraged all advances,  and, as time went by, his nephew had come to look on him as something  apart from the rest of the world, one of those things which no fellow  could understand.    On Mr. Westley's side, there was something to be said in extenuation of  his attitude. John reminded him of his father, and he had hated the  late Prince of Mervo with a cold hatred that had for a time been the  ruling passion of his life. He had loved his sister, and her married  life had been one long torture to him, a torture rendered keener by the  fact that he was powerless to protect either her happiness or her  money. Her money was her own, to use as she pleased, and the use which  pleased her most was to give it to her husband, who could always find a  way of spending it. As to her happiness, that was equally out of his  control. It was bound up in her Prince, who, unfortunately, was a bad  custodian for it. At last, an automobile accident put an end to His  Highness's hectic career (and, incidentally, to that of a blonde lady  from the _Folies Bergeres_), and the Princess had returned to her  brother's home, where, a year later, she died, leaving him in charge of  her infant son.    Mr. Westley's desire from the first had been to eliminate as far as  possible all memory of the late Prince. He gave John his sister's name,  Maude, and brought him up as an American, in total ignorance of his  father's identity. During all the years they had spent together, he had  never mentioned the Prince's name.    He disliked John intensely. He fed him, clothed him, sent him to  college, and gave him a place in his office, but he never for a moment  relaxed his bleakness of front toward him. John was not unlike his  father in appearance, though built on a larger scale, and, as time went  on, little mannerisms, too, began to show themselves, that reminded Mr.  Westley of the dead man, and killed any beginnings of affection.    John, for his part, had the philosophy which goes with perfect health.  He fitted his uncle into the scheme of things, or, rather, set him  outside them as an irreconcilable element, and went on his way enjoying  life in his own good-humored fashion.    It was only lately, since he had joined the firm, that he had been  conscious of any great strain. College had given him a glimpse of a  larger life, and the office cramped him. He felt vaguely that there  were bigger things in the world which he might be doing. His best  friends, of whom he now saw little, were all men of adventure and  enterprise, who had tried their hand at many things; men like Jimmy  Pitt, who had done nearly everything that could be done before coming  into an unexpected half-million; men like Rupert Smith, who had been at  Harvard with him and was now a reporter on the _News_; men like  Baker, Faraday, Williams--he could name half-a-dozen, all men who were  _doing_ something, who were out on the firing line.    He was not a man who worried. He had not that temperament. But  sometimes he would wonder in rather a vague way whether he was not  allowing life to slip by him a little too placidly. An occasional  yearning for something larger would attack him. There seemed to be  something in him that made for inaction. His soul was sleepy.    If he had been told of the identity of his father, it is possible that  he might have understood. The Princes of Mervo had never taken readily  to action and enterprise. For generations back, if they had varied at  all, son from father, it had been in the color of hair or eyes, not in  character--a weak, shiftless procession, with nothing to distinguish  them from the common run of men except good looks and a talent for  wasting money.    John was the first of the line who had in him the seeds of better  things. The Westley blood and the bracing nature of his education had  done much to counteract the Mervo strain. He did not know it, but the  American in him was winning. The desire for action was growing steadily  every day.    It had been Mervo that had sent him to the polo grounds on the previous  day. That impulse had been purely Mervian. No prince of that island had  ever resisted a temptation. But it was America that was sending him now  to meet his uncle with a quiet unconcern as to the outcome of the  interview. The spirit of adventure was in him. It was more than  possible that Mr. Westley would sink the uncle in the employer and  dismiss him as summarily as he would have dismissed any other clerk in  similar circumstances. If so, he was prepared to welcome dismissal.  Other men fought an unsheltered fight with the world, so why not he?    He moved towards the door of the inner office with a certain  exhilaration.    As he approached, it flew open, disclosing Mr. Westley himself, a tall,  thin man, at the sight of whom Spiller shot into his seat like a  rabbit.    John went to meet him.    \"Ah,\" said Mr. Westley; \"come in here. I want to speak to you.\"    John followed him into the room.    \"Sit down,\" said his uncle.    John waited while he dictated a letter. Neither spoke till the  stenographer had left the room. John met the girl's eye as she passed.  There was a compassionate look in it. John was popular with his fellow  employes. His absence had been the cause of discussion and speculation  among them, and the general verdict had been that there would be  troublous times for him on the morrow.    When the door closed, Mr. Westley leaned back in his chair, and  regarded his nephew steadily from under a pair of bushy gray eyebrows  which lent a sort of hypnotic keenness to his gaze.    \"You were at the ball-game yesterday?\" he said.    The unexpectedness of the question startled John into a sharp laugh.    \"Yes,\" he said, recovering himself.    \"Without leave.\"    \"It didn't seem worth while asking for leave.\"    \"You mean that you relied so implicitly on our relationship to save you  from the consequences?\"    \"No, I meant--\"    \"Well, we need not try and discover what you may have meant. What claim  do you put forward for special consideration? Why should I treat you  differently from any other member of the staff?\"    John had a feeling that the interview was being taken at too rapid a  pace. He felt confused.    \"I don't want you to treat me differently,\" he said.    Mr. Westley did not reply. John saw that he had taken a check-book from  its pigeonhole.    \"I think we understand each other,\" said Mr. Westley. \"There is no need  for any discussion. I am writing you a check for ten thousand  dollars--\"    \"Ten thousand dollars!\"    \"It happens to be your own. It was left to me in trust for you by your  mother. By a miracle your father did not happen to spend it.\"    John caught the bitter note which the other could not keep out of his  voice, and made one last attempt to probe this mystery. As a boy he had  tried more than once before he realized that this was a forbidden  topic.    \"Who was my father?\" he said.    Mr. Westley blotted the check carefully.    \"Quite the worst blackguard I ever had the misfortune to know,\" he  replied in an even tone. \"Will you kindly give me a receipt for this?  Then I need not detain you. You may return to the ball-game without any  further delay. Possibly,\" he went on, \"you may wonder why you have not  received this money before. I persuaded your mother to let me use my  discretion in choosing the time when it should be handed over to you. I  decided to wait until, in my opinion, you had sense enough to use it  properly. I do not think that time has arrived. I do not think it will  ever arrive. But as we are parting company and shall, I hope, never  meet again, you had better have it now.\"    John signed the receipt in silence.    \"Thank you,\" said Mr. Westley. \"Good-by.\"    At the door John hesitated. He had looked forward to this moment as one  of excitement and adventure, but now that it had come it had left him  in anything but an uplifted mood. He was naturally warm-hearted, and  his uncle's cold anger hurt him. It was so different from anything  sudden, so essentially not of the moment. He felt instinctively that it  had been smoldering for a long time, and realized with a shock that his  uncle had not been merely indifferent to him all these years, but had  actually hated him. It was as if he had caught a glimpse of something  ugly. He felt that this was the last scene of some long drawn-out  tragedy.    Something made him turn impulsively back towards the desk.    \"Uncle--\" he cried.    He stopped. The hopelessness of attempting any step towards a better  understanding overwhelmed him. Mr. Westley had begun to write. He must  have seen John's movement, but he continued to write as if he were  alone in the room.    John turned to the door again.    \"Good-by,\" he said.    Mr. Westley did not look up.          CHAPTER IV    VIVE LE ROI!      When, an hour later, John landed"]]]
