Did anybody help you make  that?'    'No; I believe not.'    'What'll you take for it?'    'I never thought of selling it.'    'Wal, think of it now.'    'What do you want to do with it?    'Thar's three of us goin' out to hunt fur gold, and that's jist the  thing to keep the Injins back an' scart. I've been out thar afore, and  know what's the matter with the darned skunks. So, tell me how much  money will buy it.'    'I would rather not sell it, said Johnny, after a few minutes' further  thought.' It has taken me a great while to finish it, and I would  rather not part with it, for the present, at least.'    'But, skin me, younker, I want to buy it! I'll give you a thousand  dollars fur it, slap down.'    Although much less than the machine was really worth, yet it was a  large offer, and the boy hesitated for a moment. But it was only for a  moment, when he decidedly shook his head.    'I wish you wouldn't ask me, for I don't want to sell it, until I have  had it some time. Besides, it isn't finished yet.'    'It ain't,' exclaimed Baldy, in surprise. 'Why, it works, what more do  you want?'    'I've got to make a wagon to run behind it.'    'That's it, eh? I thought you war goin' to ride on its back. How much  will it draw?'    'As much as four horses, and as fast as they can run.'    The hunter was half wild with excitement. The boy's delight was never  equal to one-half of his.    'Skulp me ag'in, ef that don't beat all! It's jest the thing for the  West; we'll walk through the Injins in the tallest kind of style, and  skear 'em beautiful. How long afore you'll have it done?'    'It will take a month longer, at least.'    Baldy stood a few minutes in thought.    'See here, younker, we're on our way to the 'diggin's,' and spect to be  thar all summer. Ef the red-skins git any ways troublesome, I'm comin'  back arter this y'ar covey. Ef yer don't want to sell him, yer  needn't. Ef I bought him, it ain't likely I'd run him long afore I'd  bust his b'iler, or blow my own head off.'    'Just what I thought when you were trying to persuade me to sell it,'  interrupted the boy.    'Then, if he got the cramp in any of his legs, I wouldn't know how to  tie it up ag'in, and thar we'd be.'    'I am glad to see you take such a sensible view of it,' smiled Johnny.    'So, I'm goin' on West, as I said, with two fools besides myself, and  we're goin' to stay thar till yer get this old thing finished; and  then I'm comin' after you to take a ride out thar.'    'That would suit me very well,' replied the boy, his face lighting up  with more pleasure than he had shown. 'I would be very glad to make a  trip on the prairies.'    'Wal, look fur me in about six weeks.'    And with this parting, the hunter was let out the door, and  disappeared, while Johnny resumed his work.    That day saw the steam man completed, so far as it was possible. He  was painted up, and every improvement made that the extraordinarily  keen mind of the boy could suggest. When he stood one side, and  witnessed the noiseless but powerful workings of the enormous legs, he  could not see that anything more could be desired.    It now remained for him to complete the wagon, and he began at once.    It would have been a much easier matter for him to have secured an  ordinary carriage or wagon, and alter it to suit himself; but this was  not in accordance with the genius of the boy. No contrivance could  really suit him unless he made it himself. He had his own ideas, which  no one else could work out to his satisfaction.    It is unnecessary to say that the vehicle was made very strong and  durable.    This was the first great requisite. In some respects it resembled the  ordinary express wagons, except that it was considerably smaller.    It had heavy springs, and a canvas covering, with sufficient, as we  have shown in another place, to cover the man also, when necessary.    This was arranged to carry the wood, a reserve of water, and the  necessary tools to repair it, when any portion of the machinery should  become disarranged.    English coal could be carried to last for two days, and enough wood to  keep steam going for twenty-four hours. When the reserve tank in the  bottom of the wagon was also filled, the water would last nearly as  long.    When these contingencies were all provided against, the six weeks  mentioned by the hunter were gone, and Johnny Brainerd found himself  rather longing for his presence again.                            CHAPTER V. ON THE YELLOWSTONE.    BALDY BICKNELL was a hunter and trapper who, at the time we bring him  to the notice of the reader, had spent something over ten years among  the mountains and prairies of the West.    He was a brave, skillful hunter, who had been engaged in many  desperate affrays with the red-skins, and who, in addition to the loss  of the hair upon the crown of his head, bore many other mementos on  his person of the wild and dangerous life that he had led.    Like most of his class, he was a restless being, constantly flitting  back and forth between the frontier towns and the western wilds. He  never went further east than St. Louis, while his wanderings, on more  than one occasion, had led him beyond the Rocky Mountains.    One autumn he reached the Yellowstone, near the head of navigation,  just as a small trading propeller was descending the stream. As much  from the novelty of the thing, as anything else, he rode on board,  with his horse, with the intention of completing his journey east by  water.    On board the steamer he first met Ethan Hopkins and Mickey McSquizzle,  who had spent ten years in California, in a vain hunt for gold, and  were now returning to their homes, thoroughly disgusted with the  country, its inhabitants and mineral resources.    Baldy was attracted to them by their peculiarities of manner; but it  is not probable that anything further would have resulted from this  accidental meeting, but for a most startling and unforeseen  occurrence.    While still in the upper waters of the Yellowstone, the steamer  exploded her boiler, making a complete wreck of the boat and its  contents. The hunter, with the others, was thrown into the water, but  was so bruised and injured that he found it impossible to swim, and he  would assuredly have been drowned but for the timely assistance of his  two acquaintances.    Neither the Yankee nor Irishman were hurt in the least, and both  falling near the trapper, they instantly perceived his helplessness  and came to his rescue. Both were excellent swimmers, and had no  difficulty in saving him.    'Do ye rist aisy!' said Mickey, as he saw the hunter's face contorted  with pain, as he vainly struggled in the water, 'and it's ourselves  that 'll take the good care of yees jist.'    'Stop yer confounded floundering,' admonished Hopkins; 'it won't do no  good, and there ain't no necessity for it.'    One of them took the arm upon one side, and the other the same upon  the opposite side, and struck out for the shore. The poor trapper  realized his dire extremity, and remained motionless while they towed  him along.    'Aisy jist-aiey now!' admonished Mickey: 'ye're in a bad fix; but by  the blessin' of Heaven we'll do the fair thing wid yees. We understand  the science of swimmin', and--'    At that moment some drowning wretch caught the foot of the Irishman,  and he was instantly drawn under water, out of sight.    Neither Hopkins nor Baldy lost presence of mind in this fearful  moment, but continued their progress toward shore, as though nothing  of the kind had happened.    As for the Irishman, his situation for the time was exceedingly  critical. The man who had clutched his foot did so with the grasp of a  drowning man; in their struggle both went to the bottom of the river  together. Here, by a furious effort, Mickey shook him free, and coming  to the surface, struck out again for the suffering hunter.    'It is sorry I am that I was compelled to leave yees behind,' he  muttered, glancing over his shoulder in search of the poor fellow from  whom he had just freed himself; 'but yees are past helpin', and so  it's maeself that must attend to the poor gentleman ahead.'    Striking powerfully out, he soon came beside his friends again and  took the drooping arm of Baldy Bicknell.    'Be yees sufferin' to a great extent?' inquired the kind-hearted  Irishman, looking at the white face of the silent hunter.    'Got a purty good whack over the back,' he replied, between his  compressed lips, as he forced back all expression of pain.    ''Ye'll be aisier when we fotch ye to the land, as me uncle obsarved  whin he hauled the big fish ashore that was thrashing his line to  pieces jist.'    'Twon't take you long to git over it,' added Hopkins, anxious to give  his grain of consolation; 'you look, now, like quite a healthy young  man.'    The current was quite rapid, and it was no light labor to tow the  helpless hunter ashore; but the two friends succeeded, and at length  drew him out upon the land and stretched him upon the sward.    The exertion of keeping their charge afloat, and breasting the current  at the same time, carried them a considerable distance downstream, and  they landed perhaps an eighth of a mile below where the main body of  shivering wretches were congregated.    'Do yees feel aisy?' inquired Mickey, when the hunter had been laid  upon the grass, beneath some overhanging bushes.    'Yes, I'll soon git over it but woofh! that thar war a whack of the  biggest kind I got. It has made me powerful weak.'    'What might it have been naow!' inquired Hopkins.    'Can't say, fust thing I know'd, I didn't know nothin', remember suthin'  took me back the head, and the next thing I kerwholloped in the  water.'    The three men had lost everything except what was on their bodies when  the catastrophe occurred."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7509"],[0,"The Logbooks of the Lady Nelson (#4)"],[1," if his commander was not mad, for he could not  believe that such a small ship as the Lady Nelson could ever accomplish a  voyage of discovery.    The vessels continued to sail in company towards the Cape of Good Hope.    At 5 A.M. on the 7th land was seen from the Lady Nelson, the information  being signalled to her companion. Soon after daylight the Lion's Rump was  perceived south-east by east 1/2 east, distant five leagues. A little  later the ships parted company. Lieutenant Grant had intended to anchor  in Simon's Bay, but having discovered that the Lady Nelson had lost both  her main and after keels during the voyage, he sailed to Table Bay. On  his arrival there Admiral Sir Roger Curtis, who was in command of the  station, gave orders for two new keels to be built immediately, and it is  recorded that so well did Mr. Boswell, the builder's assistant (the  builder himself being absent) perform his task that the new keels  reflected the greatest credit on him.    On the 16th, her repairs being completed, the Lady Nelson sailed for  Simon's Bay and anchored there at 9 A.M. on the following day. Here was  found H.M.S. Porpoise, also bound to New South Wales, which left the bay  for Sydney in advance of the Lady Nelson. During his stay Lieutenant  Grant met a relative, Dr. J. R. Grant, with whom he made several  excursions into the interior of the colony.    While the Lady Nelson was at the Cape of Good Hope a ship named the  Wellesley arrived from England with despatches from the Admiralty. She  had narrowly escaped capture by a French man-of-war which gave chase to  her after she had parted from her convoy, but fortunately she had been  able to beat off the enemy and to effect her escape. The instructions  brought to Grant from the Duke of Portland directed him to sail to Sydney  through Bass Strait instead of sailing round the South Cape of Van  Diemen's Land (as Tasmania was then called).*    (* The following extract is from the letter from the Duke of Portland to  Grant:--    \"WHITEHALL, 8th April, 1800.    \"SIR, Having received information from Port Jackson in New South Wales  that a navigable strait has been discovered between that country and Van  Diemen's Land in latitude 38 degrees, it is His Majesty's pleasure that  you should sail through the said strait on your way to Port Jackson. I  am, etc., PORTLAND.\")    No ship had yet sailed through this strait, which had been discovered  only a little more than a year before by Dr. George Bass. Grant was also  instructed to take particular notice of the Australian coast, and  especially of the headlands visible on either side of the strait. During  his stay at the Cape numerous volunteers offered to accompany him to  Sydney, many from on board the ships in the bay. He says that he declined  them all except a carpenter and an eccentric person named Dr. Brandt, who  might, he thought, be useful as a scientist, and who came on board  accompanied by his baboon and his dog. To oblige Sir Roger Curtis, he  also consented to take a Dane sentenced to transportation.    On the 7th of October the Lady Nelson left the Cape and proceeded on her  voyage to New South Wales. Soon after leaving port bad weather set in and  continued until the 12th, but, on the 14th at noon, when the ship was in  38 degrees 1 minute latitude, the sea moderated and the bedding was again  brought up on deck while the cabins and berths were washed with vinegar.  On the 24th the weather turned extremely cold with snow at times. A heavy  cross sea was running, which gave the little brig another opportunity of  displaying her good qualities. On the 28th at noon she was in 38 degrees  54 minutes south, and towards evening on the following day she  encountered a heavy gale which obliged her commander to heave her to.  Violent gusts with showers of sleet blew continually, and the seas were  so heavy that often in striking the bow they threw the ship so far over  as \"to expose her beam.\" A drag-sail was then used in order to steady  her, and it answered remarkably well. The fore-top-sail yard was also got  on deck and eased the ship wonderfully; fortunately little water was  shipped, as, owing to her small draught and flat bottom, she rose like a  piece of cork on the top of every wave.    On November 1st, in accordance with expectations, the island of Amsterdam  was sighted. The Lady Nelson steered a lonely course along its high,  inaccessible shores, and beyond seeing that it was covered with grass,  those on board could observe little. A flagstaff with a flag flying came  into view, but not a single human being could be seen through the  telescope, although a party of sealers was known to visit the place  frequently. As the ship left the coast a boat's thwart with a piece of  rope wound round it was observed floating in the water, and its presence  caused some curiosity on board. Within the next few days a shoal of  whales known to sailors as the Right whale was sighted, and later in the  month several other whales of various species with two threshers at work  upon one of them were seen.    On the 23rd Vancouver's track was crossed, and then Grant gave orders for  a strict look-out for land to be kept from the masthead by night and day.    Still the Australian coast remained invisible.    On the 29th the sea was so calm that there was not a ripple on its  surface, and nothing worth noting occurred until December 1st, when a  large spermaceti whale passed, and at 3 P.M. a seal. At 5 P.M. another  appeared; this seal swam after the ship for some time, gazing after it in  a curious way and shaking its head as it leapt from the water. On  December 2nd the birds which till then had followed the ship disappeared,  and in the evening a horse-fly settled on the main-sail and showed that  land was near. The same night heavy squalls arose and blew until morning.  At 8 A.M., to the great joy of all on board, land was sighted from the  masthead. It appeared to take the form of four islands, some six or seven  leagues distant. At noon the ship was in 38 degrees 10 minutes south and  longitude by account 142 degrees 30 minutes east, and the following notes  are recorded in the journal of Lieutenant Grant,* as his first impression  of the land of New Holland (Australia). (* The Journals and logbooks are  not printed in extenso. A few passages of minor importance that in no way  affect the general course of the narrative have, for want of space, been  omitted.)    THE LADY NELSON TO PORT JACKSON.    \"December 3rd, 1800. At daylight made all possible sail judging myself to  be in latitude of 38 degrees south.* (* (Note in log.) Longitude worked  back 141 degrees 20 minutes east.) At 8 A.M. saw the land from north to  east-north-east appearing like unconnected islands, being four in number,  which on our near approach turned out to be two capes and two high  mountains a considerable way inshore. One of them was very like the Table  Hill at the Cape of Good Hope, the other stands farther into the country.  Both are covered with large trees as is also the land which is low and  flat as far as the eye can reach. I named the first of these mountains  after Captain Schanck and the other Gambier's Mountain. The first cape I  called Northumberland, after His Grace the Duke of Northumberland.  Another smaller, but very conspicuous jut of the land, which we plainly  saw when abreast of Cape Northumberland I named Cape Banks.* (* Grant  named the two points first sighted Cape Northumberland and Cape Banks and  the two mountains behind Mount Gambier and Mount Schanck, names they all  still bear. Grant came in sight of Australia near to the present boundary  of Victoria and South Australia.) When the former Cape bears north-west  by west distant 8 or 9 miles, Schanck's Mountain loses its table form and  appears like a saddle. There does not appear to be a harbour here, but  vessels may find shelter under Cape Northumberland from north and  north-north-west winds. The shore is in general a flat sandy beach, the  sea at present making no breach upon it.    \"December 4th. As we stood along the shore steering eastward, the land as  far as we could see bearing south-east. Hauled close up for it. This  forming a conspicuous cape, I named it Bridgewater* after the Duke of  that title. (* This cape has been described since as having \"a bald pate  and shoulders besprinkled with white sand.\" Cape Bridgewater forms with  Cape Northumberland another bend called Discovery Bay where the tides  meet and create a very turbulent sea. The bay receives the waters of the  River Glenelg.) The shore is a sandy beach from where we made the land to  this cape, with bushes and large woods inland. Finding we could not  weather Cape Bridgewater, got four oars on the lee side, which were  employed all night. At daybreak in the morning we weathered the cape when  another cape appeared bearing east by north about 15 or 16 miles distant  forming with Cape Bridgewater a very deep bay and to appearance had  shelter for anchorage. The land appeared beautiful, rising gradually and  covered with wood. Being anxious to examine whether it was safe to  venture in or not, I ordered a boat out and took two hands with me armed.    \"After getting inshore about five miles we found there was not any  shelter from southerly winds; the water was very deep and apparently so  all the way in. We plainly saw several fires. At noon it was a matter of  great doubt whether we should not be forced to anchor--the bay being very  deep we could hardly clear it even with a steady breeze. Our latitude was  38 degrees 20 minutes south. Cape Bridgewater then bearing north-west by  west 12 or 13 miles. I called the other Cape, Nelson, after the vessel.    \"December 5th. Saw several fires. This is a very deep bay and with  southerly winds ought carefully to be avoided. Cape Nelson bears from  Cape Bridgewater east-north-east 15 or 16 miles.
