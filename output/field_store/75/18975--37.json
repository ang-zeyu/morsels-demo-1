This is the part of a dexterous clever      Man with his wits about him ever,      One who has travelled the world to see;      Always to shift, and to keep through all      Close to the sunny side of the wall;      Not like a pictured block to be,      Standing always in one position;      Nay but to veer, with expedition,      And ever to catch the favouring breeze,      This is the part of a shrewd tactician,      This is to be a--THERAMENES!      DIO. Truly an exquisite joke 'twould be,      Him with a dancing girl to see,      Lolling at ease on Milesian rugs;      Me, like a slave, beside him standing,      Aught that he wants to his lordship handing;      Then as the damsel fair he hugs,      Seeing me all on fire to embrace her,      He would perchance (for there's no man baser),      Turning him round like a lazy lout,      Straight on my mouth deliver a facer,      Knocking my ivory choirmen out.      HOSTESS. O Plathane! Plathane! Here's that naughty man,    That's he who got into our tavern once,    And ate up sixteen loaves.      PLATHANE. O, so he is! The very man.      XAN. Bad luck for somebody!      HOS. O and, besides, those twenty bits of stew,    Half-obol pieces.      XAN. Somebody's going to catch it!      HOS. That garlic too.      DIO. Woman, you're talking nonsense. You don't know what you're saying.      HOS. O, you thought I shouldn't know you with your buskins on!    Ah, and I've not yet mentioned all that fish,    No, nor the new-made cheese: he gulped it down,    Baskets and all, unlucky that we were.    And when I just alluded to the price,    He looked so fierce, and bellowed like a bull.      XAN. Yes, that's his way: that's what he always does.      HOS. O, and he drew his sword, and seemed quite mad.      PLA. O, that he did.      HOS. And terrified us so    We sprang up to the cockloft, she and I.    Then out he hurled, decamping with the rugs.      XAN. That's his way too; but something must be done.      HOS. Quick, run and call my patron Cleon here!      PLA. O, if you meet him, call Hyperbolus! We'll pay you out to-day.      HOS. O filthy throat, O how I'd like to take a stone, and hack    Those grinders out with which you chawed my wares.      PLA. I'd like to pitch you in the deadman's pit.      HOS. I'd like to get a reaping-hook and scoop    That gullet out with which you gorged my tripe.    But I'll to Cleon: he'll soon serve his writs;    He'll twist it out of you to-day, he will.      DRO. Perdition seize me, if I don't love Xanthias.      XAN. Aye, aye, I know your drift: stop, stop that talking.    I won't be Heracles.      DRO. O, don't say so, Dear, darling Xanthias.      XAN. Why, how can I, A slave, a mortal, act Alcmena's son!      DRO. Aye, aye, I know you are vexed, and I deserve it,    And if you pummel me, I won't complain.    But if I strip you of these togs again,    Perdition seize myself, my wife, my children,    And, most of all, that blear-eyed Archedemus.      XAN. That oath contents me: on those terms I take them.        CHOR. Now that at last you appear once more,      Wearing the garb that at first you wore,      Wielding the club and the tawny skin,      Now it is yours to be up and doing,      Glaring like mad, and your youth renewing,      Mindful of him whose guise you are in.      If, when caught in a bit of a scrape, you      Suffer a word of alarm to escape you,      Showing yourself but a feckless knave,      Then will your master at once undrape you,      Then you'll again be the toiling slave.        XAN. There, I admit, you have given to me a      Capital hint, and the like idea,      Friends, had occurred to myself before.      Truly if anything good befell      He would be wanting, I know full well,      Wanting to take to the togs once more.      Nevertheless, while in these I'm vested,      Ne'er shall you find me craven-crested,      No, for a dittany look I'll wear,      Aye and methinks it will soon be tested,      Hark! how the portals are rustling there.      AEAC. Seize the dog-stealer, bind him, pinion him,    Drag him to justice!      DIO. Somebody's going to catch it.      XAN. (_Striking out_.) Hands off! get away! stand back!      ABAC. Eh? You're for fighting. Ho! Ditylas, Sceblyas, and Pardocas,    Come hither, quick; fight me this sturdy knave.      DIO. Now isn't it a shame the man should strike    And he a thief besides?      AEAC. A monstrous shame!      DIO. A regular burning shame!      XAN. By the Lord Zeus,    If ever I was here before, if ever    I stole one hair's-worth from you, let me die!    And now I'll make you a right noble offer,    Arrest my lad: torture him as you will,    And if you find I'm guilty, take and kill me.      AEAC. Torture him, how?      XAN. In any mode you please.    Pile bricks upon him: stuff his nose with acid:    Flay, rack him, hoist him; flog him with a scourge    Of prickly bristles: only not with this,    A soft-leaved onion, or a tender leek.      AEAC. A fair proposal. If I strike too hard    And maim the boy, I'll make you compensation.      XAN. I shan't require it. Take him out and flog him.      ABAC. Nay, but I'll do it here before your eyes.    Now then, put down the traps, and mind you speak    The truth, young fellow.      DIO. (_In agony_.) Man! don't torture ME!    I am a god. You'll blame yourself hereafter    If you touch ME.      AEAC. Hillo! What's that you are saying?      DIO. I say I'm Bacchus, son of Zeus, a god, Anid _he's_ the slave.      AEAC. You hear him?      XAN. Hear him? Yes. All the more reason you should flog him well.    For if he is a god, he won't perceive it.      DIO. Well, but you say that you're a god yourself.    So why not _you_ be flogged as well as I?      XAN. A fair proposal. And be this the test,    Whichever of us two you first behold    Flinching or crying out--he's not the god.      AEAC. Upon my word you're quite the gentleman,    You're all for right and justice. Strip then, both.      XAN. How can you test us fairly?      AEAC. Easily, I'll give you blow for blow.      XAN. A good idea. We're ready! Now! (_Aeacus strikes him_), see if you    catch me flinching.      AEAC. I struck you.      XAN. (_Incredulously_.) No!      ABAC Well, it seems \"no,\" indeed.    Now then I'll strike the other (_Strikes DIO_.).      DIO. Tell me when?      AEAC. I struck you.      DIO. Struck me? Then why didn't I sneeze?      AEAC. Don't know, I'm sure. I'll try the other again.      XAN. And quickly too. Good gracious!      AEAC. Why \"good gracious\"? Not hurt you, did I?      XAN. No, I merely thought of The Diomeian feast of Heracles.      AEAC. A holy man! 'Tis now the other's turn.      DIO. Hi! Hi!      AEAC. Hallo!      DIO. Look at those horsemen, look!      AEAC. But why these tears?      DIO. There's such a smell of onions.      AEAC. Then you don't mind it?      DIO. (_Cheerfully_.) Mind it? Not a bit.      AEAC. Well, I must go to the other one again.      XAN. O! O!      AEAC. Hallo!      XAN. Do pray pull out this thorn.      AEAC. What does it mean? 'Tis this one's turn again.      DIO. (_Shrieking_.) Apollo! Lord! (_Calmly_) of Delos and of Pytho.      XAN. He flinched! You heard him?      DIO. Not at all; a jolly Verse of Hipponax flashed across my mind.      XAN. You don't half do it: cut his flanks to pieces.      AEAC. By Zeus, well thought on. Turn your belly here.      DIO. (_Screaming_.) Poseidon!      XAN. There! he's flinching.      DIO. (Singing) who dost reign    Amongst the Aegean peaks and creeks    And o'er the deep blue main.      AEAC. No, by Demeter, still I can't find out    Which is the god, but come ye both indoors;    My lord himself and Persephassa there,    Being gods themselves, will soon find out the truth.      DIO. Right! right! I only wish you had thought of that    Before you gave me those tremendous whacks.        CHOR. Come, Muse, to our Mystical Chorus, O come to the joy of my          song,      O see on the benches before us that countless and wonderful throng,      Where wits by the thousand abide, with more than a Cleophon's          pride--      On the lips of that foreigner base, of Athens the bane and disgrace,      There is shrieking, his kinsman by race,      The garrulous swallow of Thrace;      From that perch of exotic descent,      Rejoicing her sorrow to vent,      She pours to her spirit's content, a nightingale's woeful lament,      That e'en though the voting be equal, his ruin will soon be the          sequel.        Well it suits the holy Chorus evermore with counsel wise      To exhort and teach the city: this we therefore now          advise--      End the townsmen's apprehensions; equalize the rights of all;      If by Phrynichus's wrestlings some perchance sustained a fall,      Yet to these 'tis surely open, having put away their sin,      For their slips and vacillations pardon at your hands to win.      Give your brethren back their franchise.      Sin and shame it were that slaves,      Who have once with stern devotion fought your battle on the waves,      Should be straightway lords and masters, yea Plataeans fully          blown--      Not that this deserves our censure; there I praise you; there alone      Has the city, in her anguish, policy and wisdom          shown--      Nay but these, of old accustomed on our ships to fight and win,      (They, their father too before them), these our very kith and kin,      You should likewise, when they ask you, pardon for their single sin.      O by nature best and wisest, O relax your jealous ire,      Let us all the world as kinsfolk and as citizens acquire,      All who on our ships will battle well and bravely by our side      If we cocker up our city, narrowing her with senseless pride      Now when she is rocked and reeling in the cradles of the sea,      Here again will after ages deem we acted brainlessly.

neither shall there  any more be a flood to destroy the earth.    01:009:012 And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make  between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for  perpetual generations:    01:009:013 I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of  a covenant between me and the earth.    01:009:014 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the  earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:    01:009:015 And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you  and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more  become a flood to destroy all flesh.    01:009:016 And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it,  that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every  living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.    01:009:017 And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant,  which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the  earth.    01:009:018 And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem,  and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.    01:009:019 These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole  earth overspread.    01:009:020 And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a  vineyard:    01:009:021 And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was  uncovered within his tent.    01:009:022 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his  father, and told his two brethren without.    01:009:023 And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both  their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their  father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's  nakedness.    01:009:024 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son  had done unto him.    01:009:025 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he  be unto his brethren.    01:009:026 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan  shall be his servant.    01:009:027 God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of  Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.    01:009:028 And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.    01:009:029 And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years:  and he died.    01:010:001 Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham,  and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.    01:010:002 The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan,  and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.    01:010:003 And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.    01:010:004 And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and  Dodanim.    01:010:005 By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their  lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their  nations.    01:010:006 And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.    01:010:007 And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and  Raamah, and Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.    01:010:008 And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the  earth.    01:010:009 He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said,  Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.    01:010:010 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and  Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.    01:010:011 Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and  the city Rehoboth, and Calah,    01:010:012 And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great  city.    01:010:013 And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and  Naphtuhim,    01:010:014 And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,)  and Caphtorim.    01:010:015 And Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth,    01:010:016 And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,    01:010:017 And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,    01:010:018 And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and  afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.    01:010:019 And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou  comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and  Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.    01:010:020 These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their  tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.    01:010:021 Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the  brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.    01:010:022 The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and  Lud, and Aram.    01:010:023 And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.    01:010:024 And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.    01:010:025 And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg;  for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was  Joktan.    01:010:026 And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and  Jerah,    01:010:027 And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,    01:010:028 And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,    01:010:029 And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of  Joktan.    01:010:030 And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar  a mount of the east.    01:010:031 These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their  tongues, in their lands, after their nations.    01:010:032 These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their  generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in  the earth after the flood.    01:011:001 And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.    01:011:002 And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that  they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.    01:011:003 And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and  burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they  for morter.    01:011:004 And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower,  whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be  scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.    01:011:005 And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which  the children of men builded.    01:011:006 And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have  all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be  restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.    01:011:007 Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language,  that they may not understand one another's speech.    01:011:008 So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face  of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.    01:011:009 Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD  did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did  the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.    01:011:010 These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years  old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:    01:011:011 And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years,  and begat sons and daughters.    01:011:012 And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:    01:011:013 And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and  three years, and begat sons and daughters.    01:011:014 And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:    01:011:015 And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three  years, and begat sons and daughters.    01:011:016 And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:    01:011:017 And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty  years, and begat sons and daughters.    01:011:018 And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:    01:011:019 And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine  years, and begat sons and daughters.    01:011:020 And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:    01:011:021 And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven  years, and begat sons and daughters.    01:011:022 And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:    01:011:023 And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and  begat sons and daughters.    01:011:024 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:    01:011:025 And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen  years, and begat sons and daughters.    01:011:026 And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and  Haran.    01:011:027 Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram,  Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.    01:011:028 And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his  nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.    01:011:029 And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife  was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran,  the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.    01:011:030 But Sarai was barren; she had no child.    01:011:031 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his  son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they  went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of  Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.    01:011:032 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and  Terah died in Haran.    01:012:001 Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy  country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land  that I will shew thee:    01:012:002 And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless  thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:    01:012:003 And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that  curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.    01:012:004 So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot "]]]
