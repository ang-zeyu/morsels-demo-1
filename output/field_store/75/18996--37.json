SAYINGS OF THE FATHERS    _One of the following chapters is read on each Sabbath from the  Sabbath after Passover until the Sabbath before New Year._    All Israel (1) have a portion in the world to come, and it is said,  \"And thy people shall be all righteous; they shall inherit the land  (2) for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I  may be glorified\" (3).          (1) This does not mean that Israel alone, to the exclusion of        other nations, will have a portion in the future world.  On        the future world ([olam haba]), see [Chapter II], n. 21.  \"The        pious of all nations have a portion in the world to come\"        (_Tosefta Sanhedrin_, chap. XII; Maimonides, in _Mishneh        Torah_, I, _Hilchot Teshubah_, iii, 5) sums up the Rabbinic        opinion.          (2) _I.e._, the land of everlasting life.          (3) _Sanhedrin_, X (XI), 1; Isaiah lx, 21.  This passage is        recited before each chapter.    CHAPTER I    1. Moses received the _Torah_ (4) from Sinai (5), and handed it down  to Joshua, and Joshua to the elders (6), and the elders to the  prophets, and the prophets delivered it to the men of the Great  Synagogue (7).  They said three things, \"Be deliberate in judgment;  raise up many disciples; and make a fence about the _Torah_\" (8).          (4) The word _Torah_ is usually translated by \"law,\" but it        means rather \"teaching,\" \"instruction\" of any kind, or        \"doctrine.\"  This term is generally used to designate the        _Five Books of Moses_ or the _Pentateuch_, called the \"written        law\" ([torah shebichtav]), but it is also employed as a        designation of the whole of the Old Testament.  Besides the        \"written law,\" according to tradition, there was also        communicated to Moses, on Mt. Sinai, the \"oral law\" ([torah        she'b'al peh]), supplementing the former and other laws and        maxims, and explaining it.  This \"oral law\" was handed down by        word of mouth from generation to generation, but subsequently,        after the destruction of the second Temple, it was committed        to writing, and constitutes the _Mishnah_, the _Talmud_, and        the _Midrashim_.  The \"oral law\" develops, illuminates, and        comments upon the \"written law.\"  Here, _Torah_ means the        \"oral law,\" which Moses communicated to Joshua, Joshua, in        turn, to the elders, and so on.

Compare the expression [halacha l'moshe        misinai], \"the law to Moses from Sinai (God),\" _Peah_, II, 6,        _Eduyot_, VIII, 7, etc.          (6) The elders were the wise men who were the members of the        supreme national tribunal.  See Joshua XXIV, 31.          (7) The Great Synagogue, whose establishment, after the return        from Babylonian captivity, tradition attributes to Ezra the        Scribe, consisted of 120 men, who comprised the highest        judicial tribunal, and who occupied a position in the early        days of the Temple similar to that of the later _Sanhedrin_.        The historical foundation of this tradition is Nehemiah        VIII-X, in which is recounted the solemn acceptance of the Law        by a great assembly of the people.  The men of the Great        Synagogue appear here in _Abot_ as the depositaries of the        tradition of the _Torah_, coming in the chain between the last        prophets and the earliest scribes.  From this chapter and        other Rabbinical sources, we gather that the men of the Great        Synagogue constituted a sort of college of teachers, one of        the last survivors being Simon, the Just (Chapter I, 2).        Their work was to interpret, teach, and develop the _Torah_,        and to them were ascribed all kinds of legal enactments.  They        instituted the _Shemoneh Esrah_ (the Eighteen Benedictions)        and other prayers, and cast the entire ritual into definite        shape.  They admitted _Proverbs_, the _Song of Songs_, and        _Ecclesiastes_ into the Old Testament canon.  A number of        modern scholars, notably Kuenen, are of the opinion that this        body never existed in the form represented by Jewish tradition        (see"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8556"],[0,"The History of England from the Norman Conquest to the Death of John (1066-1216) (#4)"],[1," returned to make their peace when they  saw that resistance was hopeless. These men William received most  kindly and with good promises, and Edgar in particular he embraced and  treated like a son.    This deputation from London, headed by their nominal king, came to offer  the crown to William. For him and for the Normans the decisive moment of  the expedition was now come. A definite answer must be made. According to  the account we are following, a kind of council of war of the Norman and  other barons and the leaders of the army seems to have been held, and to  this council William submitted the question whether it would be better to  take the crown now, or to wait until the country was more completely  subdued and until his wife Matilda could be present to share the honour  with him. This is the question which we are told was proposed, but the  considerations which seem to have led to the final decision bear less  upon this than upon the question whether William should be king at all or  not. We have before this date no record of any formal decision of this  question. It had been doubtless tacitly understood by all; the crown was  more or less openly the object of the expedition; but the time had now  come when the question stood as a sharp issue before William and before  his men and must be frankly met. If the Duke of the Normans was to be  transformed into the King of the English, it could be done only with the  loyal support of his Norman followers; nor is it at all likely that, in a  state so thoroughly feudal as Normandy, the suzerain would have ventured  to assume so great an increase of rank and probable power without the  express consent of his vassals, in disregard of what was certainly the  usual feudal practice. The decision of the council was favourable, and  William accepted the crown. Immediately a force of men was sent forward  to take military possession of the city and build, after the Norman  fashion, some kind of defences there, and to make suitable preparation  for the coming of the king who was to be. The interval William occupied  in his favourite amusement of the chase, and his army in continuing to  provide for their various wants from the surrounding country and that  with no gentle hand.    Whatever may have prevented the coronation of Edgar, there was to be no  unnecessary delay about William's. Christmas day, the nearest great  festival of the Church, was fixed upon for the ceremony, which was to  take place in the new abbey church of Westminster, where Harold had been  crowned and where the body of Edward lay. The consecration was to be  performed by Aldred, Archbishop of York. No Norman, least of all William,  who had come with the special blessing of the rightful pope, could allow  this sacred office to Stigand, whose way to the primacy had been opened  by the outlawry of the Norman archbishop Robert, and whose paillium was  the gift of a schismatic and excommunicated pope. With this slight  defect, from which Harold's coronation also suffered, the ceremony was  made as formal and stately as possible. Norman guards kept order about  the place; a long procession of clergy moved into the church, with the  duke and his supporting bishops at the end. Within, the old ritual of  coronation was followed as nearly as we can judge. Englishmen and  Frenchmen were asked in their own languages if they would have William to  be king, and they shouted out their approval; William then took oath to  defend the Church, to rule justly, to make and keep right law, and to  prevent disorders, and at last he was anointed and crowned and became  King of the English in title and in law. But all this had not taken place  without some plain evidence of the unusual and violent character of the  event. The Normans stationed without had mistaken the shouts of approval  which came from within for shouts of anger and protest, and in true  Norman fashion had at once fallen on whatever was at hand, people and  buildings, slaying and setting fire, to create a diversion and to be sure  of vengeance. In one point at least they were successful; the church was  emptied of spectators and the ceremony was finished, king and bishops  alike trembling with uncertain dread, in the light of burning buildings  and amid the noise of the tumult.    At the time of his coronation William was not far from forty years of  age. He was in the full tide of a vigorous physical life, in height and  size, about the average, possibly a trifle above the average, of the men  of his time, and praised for his unusual strength of arm. In mental gifts  he stood higher above the general run of men than in physical. As a  soldier and a statesman he was clear-headed, quick to see the right thing  to do and the right time to do it; conscious of the ultimate end and of  the combination of means, direct and indirect, slowly working out, which  must be made to reach it. But the characteristic by which he is most  distinguished from the other men of his time is one which he shares with  many of the conquerors of history--a characteristic perhaps indispensable  to that kind of success--an utterly relentless determination to succeed,  if necessary without hesitation at the means employed, and without  considering in the least the cost to others. His inflexible will greatly  impressed his own time. The men who came in contact with him were afraid  of him. His sternness and mercilessness in the enforcement of law, in the  punishment of crime, and in the protection of what he thought to be his  rights, were never relaxed. His laws were thought to be harsh, his  money-getting oppressive, and his forest regulations cruel and unjust.  And yet William intended to be, and he was, a good ruler. He gave his  lands, what was in those days the best proof of good government, and to  be had only of a strong king, internal peace. He was patient also, and  did not often lose control of himself and yield to the terrible passion  which could at last be roused. For thirty years, in name at least, he had  ruled over Normandy, and he came to the throne of England with a long  experience behind him of fighting against odds, of controlling a  turbulent baronage, and of turning anarchy into good order.    William was at last crowned and consecrated king of the English. But the  kingdom over which he could exercise any real rule embraced little more  than the land through which he had actually passed; and yet this fact  must not be understood to mean too much. He had really conquered England,  and there was no avoiding the result. Notwithstanding all the  difficulties which were still before him in getting possession of his  kingdom, and the length of time before the last lingering resistance was  subdued, there is no evidence anywhere of a truly national movement  against him. Local revolts there were, some of which seemed for a moment  to assume threatening proportions; attempts at foreign intervention with  hopes of native aid, which always proved fallacious; long resistance by  some leaders worthy of a better support, the best and bravest of whom  became in the end faithful subjects of the new king: these things there  were, but if we look over the whole period of the Conquest, we can only  be astonished that a handful of foreign adventurers overcame so easily a  strong nation. There is but one explanation to be found, the one to which  such national overthrow is most often due, the lack of leadership.    The panegyrist of the new king, his chaplain, William of Poitiers, leads  us to believe that very soon after the coronation William adopted  somewhat extensive regulations for the settlement of his kingdom and for  the restraint of disorders in his army. We may fairly insist upon some  qualification of the unfailing wisdom and goodness which this  semi-official historian attributes to his patron, but we can hardly do  otherwise than consider his general order of events correct, and his  account of what was actually done on the whole trustworthy. England had  in form submitted, and this submission was a reality so far as all were  concerned who came into contact with William or his army. And now the new  government had to be set going at once. Men must know what law was to be  enforced and under what conditions property was to be secure. The king's  own followers, who had won his kingdom for him, must receive the rewards  which they had expected; but the army was now a national and not an  invading army, and it must be restrained from any further indiscriminate  plunder or rioting. Two acts of William which we must assign to this time  give some evidence that he did not feel as yet altogether sure of the  temper of London. Soon after the ceremony at Westminster he retired to  Barking, a few miles distant, and waited there while the fortification in  the city was completed, which probably by degrees grew into the Tower.  And apparently at this time, certainly not long afterwards, he issued to  the bishop and the portreeve his famous charter for the city, probably  drawn up originally in the English language, or if not, certainly with an  English translation attached for immediate effect. In this charter the  clearest assurance is given on two points about which a great commercial  city, intimately concerned in such a revolution, would be most  anxious,--the establishment of law and the security of property. The king  pledges himself to introduce no foreign law and to make no arbitrary  confiscations of property. To win the steady adhesion of that most  influential body of men who were always at hand to bring the pressure of  their public opinion to bear upon the leaders of the state, the  inhabitants of London, this measure was as wise as was the building of  the Tower for security against the sudden tumults so frequent in the  medieval city, or even more dangerous insurrections.    At the same time strict regulations were made for the repression of  disorders in"]]]
