I have a conscience void of offense and shall  die innocent_.\"    JOSIAH QUINCY'S \"FIGURES OF THE PAST.\"        THE \"CHOICE SEER.\"    In the day of Jesus, every act and every circumstance of His life was  ridiculed and belittled by his jealous enemies. But the record of  His career, from which the present world of Christians makes up its  judgment of Him, was not written until all insignificant or paltry  things had been forgotten; and now His character, illuminated by the  eternal sunshine of heaven, stands outlined against the blue vastness  of the past in sublime simplicity. Let us view Joseph Smith in the same  light--see him as he towered in the full radiance of his labors; see  him the reconciler of divergent sects and doctrines, the oracle of the  Almighty to all nations, kindreds, tongues and peoples.    Joseph Smith had been a retiring youth--the Spirit made him bold to  declare to rulers and potentates and all mankind, the Gospel again  revealed. He had been a humble farmer lad--Divine authority sat so  becomingly upon him that men looked at him with reverent awe. He had  been unlearned in the great things of art and science--he walked with  God until human knowledge was to his eye an open book, the Celestial  light beamed through his mind.    His lofty soul comprehended the grandeur of his mission upon earth; and  with divine fortitude he fulfilled the destiny which God had ordained  for him before the world was.    When he had achieved the prime of his manhood, he seemed to combine  all attractions and excellencies. His physical person was the fit  habitation of his exalted spirit. He was more than six feet in  height, with expansive chest and clean cut limbs--a staunch and  graceful figure. His head, crowned with a mass of soft, wavy hair,  was grandly poised. His face possessed a complexion of such clearness  and transparency that the soul appeared to shine through. He wore no  beard, and the full strength and beauty of his countenance impressed  all beholders at a glance. He had eyes which seemed to read the hearts  of men. His mouth was one of mingled power and sweetness. His majesty  of air was natural, not studied. Though full of personal and prophetic  dignity whenever occasion demanded, he could at other times unbend  and be as happy and unconventional as a boy. This was one of his most  striking characteristics; and it was sometimes held up to scorn by his  traducers, that the chosen \"man of God\" should at times mingle as a man  of earth with his earthly brethren. And yet it is a false ridicule; for  Savior and prophets must, like other men, eat, drink and wear apparel.  They have the physical necessities and the affections and enjoyments  which are common to other men. And it is this petty human fact--that a  divine apostle with an earthly body has hunger and thirst to appease,  that he cannot always be prophesying, but has hours to smile with the  gay and to weep with the saddened--which leaves him \"without honor in  his own country.\"    But whether engaging in manly sport, during hours of relaxation, or  proclaiming words of wisdom in pulpit or grove, he was ever the leader.  His magnetism was masterful, and his heroic qualities won universal  admiration. Where he moved all classes were forced to recognize in him  the man of power. Strangers journeying to see him from a distance, knew  him the moment their eyes beheld his person. Men have crossed ocean and  continent to meet him, and have selected him instantly from among a  multitude. [1]    It was a part of Joseph Smith's great mission \"to combat the errors of  ages; to meet the violence of mobs; to cope with illegal proceedings  from executive authority; to cut the Gordian knot of powers; to solve  mathematical problems of universities with truth--diamond truth.\" He  performed a work, \"not pagan ire, nor tooth of time, nor sword, nor  fire, shall bring to naught.\"    The Prophet's life was exalted and unselfish. His death was a sealing  martyrdom, following after that which was completed upon Calvary for  the redemption of a world.    Footnotes    1. It was the author's privilege to thus meet the Prophet for the first  time. The occasion was the arrival of a large company of Latter-day  Saints at the upper landing at Nauvoo. The General Conference of the  Church was in session and large numbers crowded to the landing place  to welcome the emigrants. Nearly every prominent man in the community  was there. Familiar with the names of all and the persons of many of  the prominent Elders, the author sought with a boy's curiosity and  eagerness, to discover those whom he knew, and especially to get sight  of the Prophet and his brother Hyrum, neither of whom he had ever  met. When his eyes fell upon the Prophet, without a word from any  one to point him out, or any reason to separate him from others who  stood around, he knew him instantly. He would have known him among  ten thousand. There was that about him, which to the author's eyes,  distinguished him from all the men he had ever seen.        JOSEPH SMITH'S LIFE AND WORK    Joseph the Prophet.    CHAPTER I.    JOSEPH'S HUMBLE EXTRACTION--THE GODLINESS AND FAIR FAME OF HIS  ANCESTRY--A PREMONITION OF HIS WORK.    Joseph Smith was of humble birth. His parents and their progenitors  were toilers; but their characters were godly and their names unstained.    In the year 1638, Robert Smith, a sturdy yeoman of England, emigrated  to the New World, the land of promise. He settled in Essex County,  Massachusetts, and afterwards married Mary French. The numerous  descendants of these worthy people intermarried with many of the  staunchest and most industrious families of New England. Samuel, the  son of Robert and Mary, born January 26th, 1666, wedded Rebecca Curtis,  January 25th, 1707. Their son, the second Samuel, was born January  26th, 1714; he married Priscilla Gould, and was the father of Asael,  born March 7th, 1744. Asael Smith took to wife Mary Duty, and their son  Joseph was born July 12th, 1771. On the 24th of January, 1796, Joseph  married Lucy Mack, at Tunbridge, in the State of Vermont. She was born  July 8th, 1776, and was the daughter of Solomon and Lydia Mack, and was  the granddaughter of Ebenezer Mack.    The men of these two families, Smith and Mack, through several  generations had been tillers of the soil. They were devout and  generous, measurably prosperous in a worldly sense, and several of them  were brave and steadfast soldiers through the early Colonial campaigns  and the Revolutionary struggle.    After the marriage of Joseph Smith with Lucy Mack, they settled,  respected and happy, upon their own farm at Tunbridge. Here they were  successful, financially, for a few years, until the dishonesty of a  trusted friend and agent robbed them of their surplus means and left  them plunged in debt. They freely sacrificed all of money value which  they possessed, even homestead and Lucy's treasured marriage portion,  and paid every just claim which was held against them. Left thus in  absolute poverty, they sought to retrieve their loss of home; and  Tunbridge, where they were known and respected, offered for a time a  prospect of success. Soon afterwards, however, they removed to Sharon,  where Joseph rented a farm from his father-in-law. This field he  diligently tilled through the summer, and during the winter taught the  village school. Comfort was restored to them; but they were destined to  be still tried and sanctified by the tribulations of life. Honest and  industrious, pious and benevolent, yet Joseph and Lucy saw themselves  and their children pursued by poverty, illness and the cold neglect of  their fellow-mortals. They repined not at their chastenings, but they  marveled.    God was teaching the parents the great lesson of personal humility; and  they and their children were learning how fleeting is earthly wealth  and how fallible is mere human friendship. For the choice seed which is  to bring forth rich and perfect fruit, the Lord Almighty prepares the  soil of His garden.    The paternal grandfather of the Prophet was Asael Smith, a man of the  strongest religious convictions, and yet a man whose broad humanitarian  views were repugnant to many of the sectarians of the day. Upon one  occasion, before the Prophet's birth, Asael Smith had a premonition  that one of his descendants should be a great teacher and leader of  men. To quote his words, as they are remembered and recorded by one who  knew and heard him speak: \"It has been borne in upon my soul that one  of my descendants will promulgate a work to revolutionize the world of  religious faith.\"    It is not known if the young Joseph ever learned of this prophetic  declaration, until after his own career had been made manifest. But  Asael lived to see the dawn of the fulfillment of his words. Just  before his death, the Book of Mormon, then recently printed, was  presented to him. He accepted it, and with the light of inspiration  which sometimes illumines the mind of man as the veil of eternity opens  to his gaze, Asael solemnly warned his attendants to give heed to the  Book, for it was true, and its coming forth heralded a renewal of the  Gospel light.        CHAPTER II.    BIRTH OF JOSEPH--FAMILY CIRCUMSTANCES--TOIL AND POVERTY--REMOVAL TO NEW  YORK--INTENSE RELIGIOUS EXCITEMENT.    The circumstances and surroundings of the elder Joseph were of the  humblest, when unto his house was born, on the 23rd of December, 1805,  Joseph, the Prophet of the Last Dispensation. The family were still  living in the little town of Sharon, in Windsor County, Vermont; and  were, at the time, greatly impoverished. Very early, therefore, was the  future Prophet compelled to learn the lessons of labor, patience and  self-denial. The father was striving, with every faculty, to repair his  shattered fortunes, that he might educate his children and provide for  their comfort and well-being; but successive disasters "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5999"],[0,"Guy Mannering; or, The Astrologer — Complete (#4)"],[1,"above  water; and, while she had voice left, continued to exclaim at such  intervals, \"Charlie yet! Charlie yet!\" When a child, and among the scenes  which she frequented, I have often heard these stories, and cried  piteously for poor Jean Gordon.    'Before quitting the Border gipsies, I may mention that my grandfather,  while riding over Charterhouse Moor, then a very extensive common, fell  suddenly among a large band of them, who were carousing in a hollow of  the moor, surrounded by bushes. They instantly seized on his horse's  bridle with many shouts of welcome, exclaiming (for he was well known to  most of them) that they had often dined at his expense, and he must now  stay and share their good cheer. My ancestor was, a little alarmed, for,  like the goodman of Lochside, he had more money about his person than he  cared to risk in such society. However, being naturally a bold,  lively-spirited man, he entered into the humour of the thing and sate  down to the feast, which consisted of all the varieties of game, poultry,  pigs, and so forth that could be collected by a wide and indiscriminate  system of plunder. The dinner was a very merry one; but my relative got a  hint from some of the older gipsies to retire just when--         The mirth and fun grew fast and furious,    and, mounting his horse accordingly, he took a French leave of his  entertainers, but without experiencing the least breach of hospitality. I  believe Jean Gordon was at this festival.'[Footnote: Blackwood's  Magazine, vol. I, p. 54]    Notwithstanding the failure of Jean's issue, for which         Weary fa' the waefu' wuddie,    a granddaughter survived her, whom I remember to have seen. That is, as  Dr. Johnson had a shadowy recollection of Queen Anne as a stately lady in  black, adorned with diamonds, so my memory is haunted by a solemn  remembrance of a woman of more than female height, dressed in a long red  cloak, who commenced acquaintance by giving me an apple, but whom,  nevertheless, I looked on with as much awe as the future Doctor, High  Church and Tory as he was doomed to be, could look upon the Queen. I  conceive this woman to have been Madge Gordon, of whom an impressive  account is given in the same article in which her mother Jean is  mentioned, but not by the present writer:--    'The late Madge Gordon was at this time accounted the Queen of the  Yetholm clans. She was, we believe, a granddaughter of the celebrated  Jean Gordon, and was said to have much resembled her in appearance. The  following account of her is extracted from the letter of a friend, who  for many years enjoyed frequent and favourable opportunities of observing  the characteristic peculiarities of the Yetholm tribes:--\"Madge Gordon  was descended from the Faas by the mother's side, and was married to a  Young. She was a remarkable personage--of a very commanding presence and  high stature, being nearly six feet high. She had a large aquiline nose,  penetrating eyes, even in her old age, bushy hair, that hung around her  shoulders from beneath a gipsy bonnet of straw, a short cloak of a  peculiar fashion, and a long staff nearly as tall as herself. I remember  her well; every week she paid my father a visit for her awmous when I was  a little boy, and I looked upon Madge with no common degree of awe and  terror. When she spoke vehemently (for she made loud complaints) she used  to strike her staff upon the floor and throw herself into an attitude  which it was impossible to regard with indifference. She used to say that  she could bring from the remotest parts of the island friends to revenge  her quarrel while she sat motionless in her cottage; and she frequently  boasted that there was a time when she was of still more considerable  importance, for there were at her wedding fifty saddled asses, and  unsaddled asses without number. If Jean Gordon was the prototype of the  CHARACTER of Meg Merrilies, I imagine Madge must have sat to the unknown  author as the representative of her PERSON.\"'[Footnote: Blackwood's  Magazine, vol. I, p. 56.]    How far Blackwood's ingenious correspondent was right, how far mistaken,  in his conjecture the reader has been informed.    To pass to a character of a very different description, Dominie  Sampson,--the reader may easily suppose that a poor modest humble scholar  who has won his way through the classics, yet has fallen to leeward in  the voyage of life, is no uncommon personage in a country where a certain  portion of learning is easily attained by those who are willing to suffer  hunger and thirst in exchange for acquiring Greek and Latin. But there is  a far more exact prototype of the worthy Dominie, upon which is founded  the part which he performs in the romance, and which, for certain  particular reasons, must be expressed very generally.    Such a preceptor as Mr. Sampson is supposed to have been was actually  tutor in the family of a gentleman of considerable property. The young  lads, his pupils, grew up and went out in the world, but the tutor  continued to reside in the family, no uncommon circumstance in Scotland  in former days, where food and shelter were readily afforded to humble  friends and dependents. The laird's predecessors had been imprudent, he  himself was passive and unfortunate. Death swept away his sons, whose  success in life might have balanced his own bad luck and incapacity.  Debts increased and funds diminished, until ruin came. The estate was  sold; and the old man was about to remove from the house of his fathers  to go he knew not whither, when, like an old piece of furniture, which,  left alone in its wonted corner, may hold together for a long while, but  breaks to pieces on an attempt to move it, he fell down on his own  threshold under a paralytic affection.    The tutor awakened as from a dream. He saw his patron dead, and that his  patron's only remaining child, an elderly woman, now neither graceful nor  beautiful, if she ever had been either the one or the other, had by this  calamity become a homeless and penniless orphan. He addressed her nearly  in the words which Dominie Sampson uses to Miss Bertram, and professed  his determination not to leave her. Accordingly, roused to the exercise  of talents which had long slumbered, he opened a little school and  supported his patron's child for the rest of her life, treating her with  the same humble observance and devoted attention which he had used  towards her in the days of her prosperity.    Such is the outline of Dominie Sampson's real story, in which there is  neither romantic incident nor sentimental passion; but which, perhaps,  from the rectitude and simplicity of character which it displays, may  interest the heart and fill the eye of the reader as irresistibly as if  it respected distresses of a more dignified or refined character.    These preliminary notices concerning the tale of Guy Mannering and some  of the characters introduced may save the author and reader in the  present instance the trouble of writing and perusing a long string of  detached notes.    ABBOTSFORD, January, 1829.          ADDENDUM: I may add that the motto of this novel was taken from the Lay  of the Last Minstrel, to evade the conclusions of those who began to  think that, as the author of Waverley never quoted the works of Sir  Walter Scott, he must have reason for doing so, and that the  circumstances might argue an identity between them.    ABBOTSFORD, August 1, 1829.            ADDITIONAL NOTE      GALWEGIAN LOCALITIES AND PERSONAGES WHICH HAVE BEEN SUPPOSED TO BE  ALLUDED TO IN THE NOVEL      An old English proverb says, that more know Tom Fool than Tom Fool knows;  and the influence of the adage seems to extend to works composed under  the influence of an idle or foolish planet. Many corresponding  circumstances are detected by readers of which the Author did not suspect  the existence. He must, however, regard it as a great compliment that, in  detailing incidents purely imaginary, he has been so fortunate in  approximating reality as to remind his readers of actual occurrences. It  is therefore with pleasure he notices some pieces of local history and  tradition which have been supposed to coincide with the fictitious  persons, incidents, and scenery of Guy Mannering.    The prototype of Dirk Hatteraick is considered as having been a Dutch  skipper called Yawkins. This man was well known on the coast of Galloway  and Dumfriesshire, as sole proprietor and master of a buckkar, or  smuggling lugger, called the 'Black Prince.' Being distinguished by his  nautical skill and intrepidity, his vessel was frequently freighted, and  his own services employed, by French, Dutch, Manx, and Scottish smuggling  companies.    A person well known by the name of Buckkar-tea, from having been a noted  smuggler of that article, and also by that of Bogle Bush, the place of  his residence, assured my kind informant Mr. Train, that he had  frequently seen upwards of two hundred Lingtow men assemble at one time,  and go off into the interior of the country, fully laden with contraband  goods.    In those halcyon days of the free trade, the fixed price for carrying a  box of tea or bale of tobacco from the coast of Galloway to Edinburgh was  fifteen shillings, and a man with two horses carried four such packages.  The trade was entirely destroyed by Mr. Pitt's celebrated commutation  law, which, by reducing the duties upon excisable articles, enabled the  lawful dealer to compete with the smuggler. The statute was called in  Galloway and Dumfries-shire, by those who had thriven upon the contraband  trade, 'the burning and starving act.'    Sure of such active assistance on shore, Yawkins demeaned himself so  boldly that his mere name was a terror to the officers of the revenue. He  availed himself of the fears which his presence inspired on one  particular night, when, happening to be ashore with a considerable  quantity of goods in his sole"]]]
