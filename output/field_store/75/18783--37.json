Servius Tullius, though he preserved the curiae, deprived them of their  military organisation, that is, he no longer made it the basis of his  system of recruiting. He instituted the centuries, with the double aim  of giving as a principle the right of suffrage to all the citizens, and  of creating an army which was more national, inasmuch as he introduced  the plebeians into it; his design was indeed to throw on the richest  citizens the burden of war,[39] which was just, each equipping and  maintaining himself at his own cost. The citizens were no longer  classified by castes, but according to their fortunes. Patricians and  plebeians were placed in the same rank if their income was equal. The  influence of the rich predominated, without doubt, but only in  proportion to the sacrifices required of them.    Servius Tullius ordered a general report of the population to be made,  in which every one was obliged to declare his age, his fortune, the name  of his tribe and that of his father, and the number of his children and  of his slaves. This operation was called _census_.[40] The report was  inscribed on tables,[41] and, once terminated, all the citizens were  called together in arms in the Campus Martius. This review was called  the _closing of the lustrum_, because it was accompanied with sacrifices  and purifications named _lustrations_. The term _lustrum_ was applied to  the interval of five years between two censuses.[42]    The citizens were divided into six classes,[43] and into a hundred and  ninety-three centuries, according to the fortune of each, beginning with  the richest and ending with the poorest. The first class comprised  ninety-eight centuries, eighteen of which were knights; the second and  fourth, twenty-two; the third, twenty; the fifth, thirty; and the sixth,  although the most numerous, forming only one.[44] The first class  contained a smaller number of citizens, yet, having a greater number of  centuries, it was obliged to pay more than half the tax, and furnish  more legionaries than any other class.    The votes continued to be taken by head, as in the curiae, but the  majority of the votes in each century counted only for one suffrage.  Now, as the first class had ninety-eight centuries, while the others,  taken together, had only ninety-five, it is clear that the votes of the  first class were enough to carry the majority. The eighteen centuries of  knights first gave their votes, and then the eighty centuries of the  first class: if they were not agreed, appeal was made to the vote of the  second class, and so on in succession; but, says Livy, it hardly ever  happened that they were obliged to descend to the last.[45] Though,  according to its original signification, the century should represent a  hundred men, it already contained a considerably greater number. Each  century was divided into the active part, including all the men from  eighteen to forty-six years of age, and the sedentary part, charged  with the guard of the town, composed of men from forty-six to sixty  years old.[46]    With regard to those of the sixth class, omitted altogether by many  authors, they were exempt from all military service, or, at any rate,  they were enrolled only in case of extreme danger.[47] The centuries of  knights, who formed the cavalry, recruited among the richest citizens,  tended to introduce a separate order among the nobility,[48] which shows  the importance of the chief called to their command. In fact, the chief  of the _celeres_ was, after the king, the first magistrate of the city,  as, at a later period, under the Republic, the _magister equitum_ became  the lieutenant of the dictator.    The first census of Servius Tullius gave a force of eighty thousand men  in a condition to bear arms,[49] which is equivalent to two hundred and  ninety thousand persons of the two sexes, to whom may be added, from  conjectures, which, however, are rather vague, fifteen thousand  artisans, merchants, or indigent people, deprived of all rights of  citizenship, and fifteen thousand slaves.[50]    The comitia by centuries were charged with the election of the  magistrates, but the comitia by curiae, being the primitive form of the  patrician assembly, continued to decree on the most important religious  and military affairs, and remained in possession of all which had not  been formally given to the centuries. Solon effected, about the same  epoch, in Athens, a similar revolution, so that, at the same time, the  two most famous towns of the ancient world no longer took birth as the  basis of the right of suffrage, but fortune.    Servius Tullius promulgated a great number of laws favourable to the  people; he established the principle that the property only of the  debtor, and not his person, should be responsible for his debt. He also  authorised the plebeians to become the patrons of their freedmen, which  allowed the richest of the former to create for themselves a _clientele_  resembling that of the patricians.[51]      [Sidenote: Religion.]    IV. Religion, regulated in great part by Numa, was at Rome an instrument  of civilisation, but, above all, of government. By bringing into the  acts of public or private life the intervention of the Divinity,  everything was impressed with a character of sanctity. Thus the  inclosure of the town with its services,[52] the boundaries of estates,  the transactions between citizens, engagements, and even the important  facts of history entered in the sacred books, were placed under the  safeguard of the gods.[53] In the interior of the house, the gods Lares  protected the family; on the field of battle, the emblem placed on the  standard was the protecting god of the legion.[54] The national  sentiment and belief that Rome would become one day the mistress of  Italy was maintained by oracles or prodigies;[55] but if, on the one  hand, religion, with its very imperfections, contributed to soften  manners and to elevate minds,[56] on the other it wonderfully  facilitated the working of the institutions, and preserved the influence  of the higher classes.    Religion also accustomed the people of Latium to the Roman supremacy;  for Servius Tullius, in persuading them to contribute to the building of  the Temple of Diana,[57] made them, says Livy, acknowledge Rome for  their capital, a claim they had so often resisted by force of arms.    The supposed intervention of the Deity gave the power, in a multitude of  cases, of reversing any troublesome decision. Thus, by interpreting the  flight of birds,[58] the manner in which the sacred chickens ate, the  entrails of victims, the direction taken by lightning, they annulled the  elections, or eluded or retarded the deliberations either of the comitia  or of the Senate. No one could enter upon office, even the king could  not mount his throne, if the gods had not manifested their approval by  what were reputed certain signs of their will. There were auspicious and  inauspicious days; in the latter it was not permitted either to judges  to hold their audience, or to the people to assemble.[59] Finally, it  might be said with Camillus, that the town was founded on the faith of  auspices and auguries.[60]    The priests did not form an order apart, but all citizens had the power  to enrol themselves in particular colleges. At the head of the  sacerdotal hierarchy were the pontiffs, five in number,[61] of whom the  king was the chief.[62] They decided all questions which concerned the  liturgy and religious worship, watched over the sacrifices and  ceremonies that they should be performed in accordance with the  traditional rites,[63] acted as inspectors over the other minister of  religion, fixed the calendar,[64] and were responsible for their actions  neither to the Senate nor to the people.[65]    After the pontiffs, the first place belonged to the curions, charged in  each curia with the religious functions, and who had at their head a  grand curion; then came the flamens, the augurs,[66] the vestals charged  with the maintenance of the sacred fire; the twelve Salian priests,[67]  keepers of the sacred bucklers, named _ancilia_; and lastly, the  _feciales_, heralds at arms, to the number of twenty, whose charge it  was to draw up treaties and secure their execution, to declare war, and  to watch over the observance of all international relations.[68]    There were also religious fraternities (_sodalitates_), instituted for  the purpose of rendering a special worship to certain divinities. Such  was the college of the fratres Arvales, whose prayers and processions  called down the favour of Heaven upon the harvest; such also was the  association having for its mission to celebrate the festival of the  Lupercalia, founded in honour of the god Lupercus, the protector of  cattle and destroyer of wolves. The gods Lares, tutelar genii of towns  or families, had also their festival instituted by Tullus Hostilius, and  celebrated at certain epochs, during which the slaves were entirely  exempt from labour.[69]    The kings erected a great number of temples for the purpose of deifying,  some, glory,[70] others, the virtues,[71] others, utility,[72] and  others, gratitude to the gods.[73]    The Romans loved to represent everything by external signs: thus Numa,  to impress better the verity of a state of peace or war, raised a temple  to Janus, which was kept open during war and closed in time of peace;  and, strange to say, this temple was only closed three times in seven  hundred years.[74]      [Sidenote"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45464"],[0,"The Mormon Doctrine of Deity: The Roberts-Van Der Donckt Discussion (#4)"],[1,"the Greeks;  until this simple expression of Christian faith in God was changed from  what we find it in the \"Apostle's Creed\" to the \"Athanasian Creed,\"  and those vain philosophizings and definitions which have grown out of  it, and which reduce the dignity of the Godhead to a mere vacuum--to  a \"being\" impersonal, incorporeal, without body, without parts,  without passions; and I might add also, without sense or reason or any  attribute--an absolute nonentity, which they placed in the seat of God,  and attempted to confer upon this conception divine powers, clothe it  with divine attributes, and give it title, knee and adoration--in a  word, divine honors!    [Footnote A: See Mosheim's Eccl. Hist. Cent. iv. bk. ii, ch. i, (note.)]    Let us now consider the form of God. In those scriptures which take us  back to the days of creation, when God created the earth and all things  therein--God is represented as saying to someone:          Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. * * * So God      created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him,      male and female created he them.    Now, if that were untouched by \"philosophy,\" I think it would not be  difficult to understand. Man was created in the image and likeness of  God. What idea does this language convey to the mind of man, except  that man, when his creation was completed, stood forth the counterpart  of God in form? But our philosophers have not been willing to let it  stand so. They will not have God limited to any form. They will not  have him prescribed by the extensions of his person to some line or  other of limitation. No; he must needs be in his person, as well as  in mind or spirit, all-pervading, filling the universe, with a center  nowhere, with a circumference everywhere. We must expand the person  of God out until it fills the universe. And so they tell us that  this plain, simple, straightforward language of Moses, which says  that man was created in the image of God--and which everybody can  understand--means, not the image of God's personality, but God's \"moral  image!\" Man was created in the \"moral image\" of God, they say.    It is rather refreshing in the midst of so much nonsense that is  uttered upon this subject, in order to hide the truth and perpetuate  the false notions of a paganized Christianity, to find now and then a  Christian scholar who rises out of the vagaries of modern Christianity  and proclaims the straightforward truth. Let me read to you the words  of such an one--the Rev Dr. Charles A. Briggs; and this note will  be found in the Manual that your Improvement Associations will use  the coming winter. It may be said, of course, by our Presbyterian  friends, that Dr. Briggs is a heretic; that he has been cast out of  their church. Grant it; but with open arms, he has been received by  the Episcopal church, and ordained into its priesthood; and has an  influence that is considerable in the Christian world, notwithstanding  the door of the Presbyterian church was shut in his face. But however  heretical Dr. Briggs' opinions may be considered by his former  Presbyterian brethren, his scholarship at least cannot be challenged.  Speaking of man being formed in the image and likeness of God, he says:          Some theologians refer the form to the higher nature of man [that      is, to that \"moral image\" in likeness of which it is supposed      man was created]; but there is nothing in the text or context to      suggest such an interpretation. The context urges us to think      of the entire man as distinguished from the lower forms of      creation,--that which is essential to man, and may be communicated      by descent to his seed.--The bodily form cannot be excluded from      the representation.[A]    [Footnote A: Messianic Prophecy, p. 70.]    I say it is rather refreshing to hear one speak like that whose  scholarship, at least, is above all question. And yet still another  voice; and this time from one who stands high in scientific circles,  one who has written a work on the \"Harmony of the Bible and Science,\"  which is a most valuable contribution to that branch of literature. The  gentleman I speak of is a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, and  principal of the College at Highbury New Park, England. On this subject  of man being created in the image of God, he says:    I think the statement that man was made in the Divine image is intended  to be more literal than we generally suppose; for judging from what we  read throughout the scriptures, it seems very clear that our Lord, as  well as the angels, had a bodily form similar to that of man, only far  more spiritual and far more glorious; but which, however, is invisible  to man unless special capabilities of sight are given him, like that  experienced by Elisha's servant when, in answer to the prophet's  prayer, he saw the heavenly hosts surrounding the city of Dothan.    After discussing this question at some length, and bringing to bear  upon it numerous Biblical illustrations, this celebrated man--Dr.  Samuel Kinns--whose scientific and scholarly standing I have already  referred to, speaks of the effect of this belief upon man, and thus  concludes his statement on that head:          I am sure if a man would only consider a little more the divinity      of his human form, and would remember that God has indeed created      him in his own image, the thought would so elevate and refine him      that he would feel it his duty to glorify God in his body as well      as in his spirit.    But, as a matter of fact, I care not a fig for the statements of  either learned divines or scientists on this subject; for the reason  that we have higher and better authority to which we can appeal--the  scriptures. And here I pass by that marvelous appearance of God unto  Abraham in the plains of Mamre, when three \"men\" came into his tent,  one of whom was the Lord, who conversed with him, and partook of his  hospitality, and disclosed to him his intention with reference to the  destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah.[A]    [Footnote A: Gen. 18.]    I pass by also that marvelous revelation of God to Joshua, when Joshua  drew near to Jericho and saw a person in the form of a man standing  with sword in hand. Joshua approached him and said: \"Art thou for us,  or for our adversaries?\" \"Nay,\" replied the person, \"but as captain of  the host of the Lord am I now come.\" And Joshua bowed himself to the  very earth in reverence, and worshiped that august warrior. Do not tell  me that it was an \"angel;\" for had it been an angel, the divine homage  paid by Israel's grand old warrior would have been forbidden. Do you  not remember the time when John, the beloved disciple, stood in the  presence of an angel and awed by the glory of his presence he bowed  down to worship him, and how the angel quickly caught him up and said:  \"See thou do it not; for I am thy fellow-servant, and of thy brethren  the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: worship  God!\"[B] The fact that this personage before whom Joshua bowed to the  earth received without protest divine worship from him, proclaims  trumpet-tongued that he indeed was God. Furthermore, he bade Joshua to  remove the shoes from his feet, for even the ground on which he stood  was holy.    [Footnote A: Joshua 5:13,14.]    [Footnote B: Rev. 22:8,9. Also Rev. 19:10.]    I also pass by that marvelous vision given of the Son of God to the  pagan king of Babylon. This king had cast the three Hebrew children  into the fiery furnace, and lo! before his startled vision were \"_four  men_\" walking about in the furnace, \"and,\" said he, \"the form of the  fourth is like the Son of God.\"[A] I pass by, I say, such incidents as  these, and come to more important testimony.    [Footnote A: Dan. 3:25.]    The great Apostle to the Gentiles writing to the Colossian saints,  speaks of the Lord Jesus Christ, \"in whom we have redemption through  his blood, even the forgiveness of sins,\" as being in the \"image of the  invisible God.\"[A] Again, writing to the Hebrew saints, and speaking of  Jesus, he says:    [Footnote A: Col. 1:15.]          Who being the brightness of his [the Father's] glory, and the      express image of his [the Father's] person, and upholding all      things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our      sins, sat down on the right band of the Majesty on high.    [Footnote A: Heb. 1:1,2.]    In the face of these scriptures, will anyone who believes in the Bible  say that it is blasphemy to speak of God as being possessed of a bodily  form? We find that the Son of God himself stood among his fellows a  man, with all the limitations as to his body which pertain to man's  body; with head, trunk, and limbs; with eyes, mouth and ears; with  affections, with passions; for he exhibited anger as well as love in  the course of his ministry; he was a man susceptible to all that man  could suffer, called by way of pre-eminence the \"man of sorrows,\" and  one \"acquainted with grief;\" for in addition to his own, he bore yours  and mine, and suffered that we might not suffer if we would obey his  gospel. And yet we are told that it is blasphemy to speak of God as  being in human form--that it is \"heathenism.\" In passing, let me call  your attention to the fact that our sectarian friends are pretending to  the use of gentle phrases now. They do not propose to hurt our feelings  at all by harshness. We are to be wooed by gentle methods. And yet they  denounce a sacred article of our faith as \"heathenism.\" I think if we  were to use such language with reference to them, or their creeds, they  could not commend it for its gentleness.    But I have a text to propose to them:    _\"What think ye of Christ?\"_    I suppose that thousands of sermons every year are preached from that  text by Christian ministers. And now I arraign them before their  favorite text, and I ask them, What think ye of Christ?"]]]
