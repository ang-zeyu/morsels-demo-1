[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46237"],[0,"The Romance of Book-Collecting (#4)"],[1," on the money invested  has a tendency to swell the principal, and so to add enormously to the  original cost.    Among books that have gone down in price since the Duke of Roxburghe  made his famed collection are those classical works of the ancients  which were at that time all the rage.  Virgil is no longer a name to  conjure with, unless he happen to rank as a sound copy of the _editio  princeps_.  The first edition of Virgil was printed by Sweynheym and  Pannartz at Rome, without date (1469?), and the Duke, notwithstanding  the search of a lifetime, never came across a copy of that.  Not more  than seven copies can now be traced, and only two of these have come to  the hammer for more than a hundred years.  One, though imperfect,  realized 4,101 francs at the La Valliere sale held at Paris in 1784, and  the other L590 at the Hopetoun House sale at London in February, 1889.  Then Homer is also a most desirable companion if he happen to have been  printed at Florence, in two volumes, folio, 1488. About L100 is his  price under those circumstances. Speaking generally, however, unless the  printer comes to the rescue of a Greek or Latin classic, it may fairly  be said to have fallen on an unappreciative generation.  Scores upon  scores of volumes, the very flowers of classic days, edited by  Cunningham, Heyne, Person, and other first-rate scholars of the last  century, are to be met with in this bulky catalogue at sums varying from  L2 to L3 each.  In an old book of this class, a copy of Epictetus,  edited by Heyne, and published at Dresden in 1756, was a slip of paper  with a memorandum of the price at which it had been purchased in 1760.  It was a bookseller's bill for L1 12s., made out to one 'Mr. Richard  Cosgrove,' doubtless a good customer in his day. I have the book now,  and it cost me fourpence, as much as it was worth.  At the Duke of  Roxburghe's sale a copy of this same edition brought L1 4s.  This, no  doubt, is rather an extreme case, but it will serve to illustrate the  general principle sought to be enunciated, namely, that  eighteenth-century classics are, for the most part, but wastepaper, for  the simple reason that only a comparatively small number of people can  read them. The learning of the schools may be deep and thorough--to  assert the contrary would be to offend many excellent scholars of our  own day; but it is nevertheless extremely probable, to say the least,  that there are more books of the kind than there is any demand for, and  so they litter the stalls, braving the wind and rain, till they are  rescued by the merest chance and given house-room for a brief space.    In the opinion of many collectors the word 'poetry' only embraces  English verse of a certain period, or written by certain people.  The  Duke's library was particularly rich in ancient English verse, lyric and  dramatic, and some of the prices realized were very high.  Webbe's 'A  Discourse of English Poetrie,' 4to., 1586, brought L64, and 'The  Paradyse of Daintie Devises,' 4to., 1580, L55.  A curious collection of  some thousands of ancient ballads, in three large folio volumes, sold  for L477 15s.  This collection, which was stated to be the finest in  England, was originally formed for the celebrated library of the Earl of  Oxford in the beginning of the eighteenth century, and was even then  supposed to excel the Pepys collection at Cambridge.  It came from the  Harleian Library, and was purchased and afterwards largely added to by  the Duke, who managed to secure a ballad printed by Leprevik at  Edinburgh in 1570, a ballad quoted in 'Hamlet,' of which no other copy  was known to exist, and many other extraordinary rarities. Dibdin was  present when the 'poetry' was competed for, and bought several hundred  pounds' worth of books, either on his own or somebody else's account,  the whole of which he could easily have stowed away in his capacious  pockets.    Naturally enough, the works of Shakespeare would first be turned to by  anyone who held this catalogue in his hand for the first time.  There  are nearly three pages of closely printed entries referring to the great  dramatist, and the only conclusion that can be arrived at is that in  1812 the early quartos must have been, if not exactly common, at any  rate of no great rarity.  It would be impossible to argue that  Shakespeare was not then appreciated, for the contrary is well known to  have been the fact.  The late Mr. Halliwell-Phillipps in after-years  talked of picking up early quartos for a few shillings each, and  lamented that, for some mysterious reason which he found himself unable  to explain, they had suddenly become scarce.  Very likely he himself had  excited a keen desire to possess them in the breasts of those who read  his numerous books, or--publish it not in Gath!--the bulk of them may  have fallen into unappreciative hands, and been used to light the fires  withal.    However this may be, the early Shakespearian quartos, now of great  price, were disposed of at the Roxburghe sale for only a little more,  and occasionally for less, than the first editions of Marlowe,  Massinger, and several other of the chief Elizabethan dramatists.  A  copy of the first folio sold, it is true, for L100, but the second only  brought L15, the third L35, and the fourth L6 6s. This record, in the  face of L84 for Boydell's edition in nine volumes, folio, 1802--a work  which may now be expected to sell for L5 or L6, even with some of the  illustrations after Smirke and others in proof state--is most  extraordinary.    But let us get to the quartos and compare the prices of then and now.  The first-named are those realized at the Roxburghe sale; those in  brackets are modern, and authenticated with dates and items complete.  There is more scope for reflection here, and a whole volume might be  written on the mutability of fashion.  'Much a-doe about Nothing,' first  edition, 4to., London, 1600, L2 17s. (the Gaisford sale, April 23, 1890,  L130); 'A Midsommer Night's Dreame,' first edition, 4to., 1600, L3 3s.  (_ibid._, L116); 'The Merchant of Venice,' by Roberts, first edition,  4to., 1600, L2 14s. (the Cosens sale, November 11, 1890, L270);  'Pericles, Prince of Tyre,' 4to., 1619, 5s. (the Lakelands Library,  March 12, 1891, L37); 'Pericles, Prince of Tyre,' 4to., 1635, 14s.  (_ibid._, L15); 'Romeo and Juliet,' second, or first complete edition,  4to., 1599, L12 12s. (the Perkins sale, July 10, 1889, L164); 'King  Lear,' 4to., 1608, L6 12s. (the Brayton-Ives sale, New York, March 5,  1891, $425); 'Sir John Oldcastle,' first edition, 4to., 1600, 19s. (the  Gaisford sale, April 23, 1890, L46).    These modern prices are small in comparison with what might have been,  for none of the copies above mentioned were in the finest condition.  If  we want first-rate records we must go further back--to the Daniell sale,  for instance, held in 1864, when thousands of pounds were paid as a  matter of course for a selection of these little quarto volumes, which  had successfully eluded the greasy fingers of generations of playgoers,  the fires of disgusted Puritans, and the ignorance of our own people.  Never shall we see nearly three thousand distinct lots of English poetry  as previously defined disposed of at one single sale again, never again  will prices rule so low.  Many of these books are not to be met with at  all in our generation, no matter what price may be offered for them,  seeing that, as an old book-hunting friend used to say, they have become  'scandalously uniquitous.'    In addition to early English texts, the great Duke had amassed a  splendid collection of romances of the Quixotic school, known in polite  circles as the _Table Ronde_.  He was not content, it seems, with the  printed editions, but also collected many manuscripts on vellum,  illustrated with beautiful illuminations.  Among these curious  manuscripts were several which had been used and translated by the  celebrated Walter de Mapes for the entertainment of his Sovereign, Henry  II.  The printed books of this character, some of which occasionally,  though very rarely, gladden the hearts of romantic bibliophiles,  included the twenty-four small volumes recounting the exploits of Amadis  of Gaul, published at Lyons and Paris in 1577, etc., and also several  duplicates, L16 16s.  A fairly good set, without the duplicates, brought  L4. 4s. in April, 1887--a dreadful drop, considering the demand there is  for books of the kind.  Still, this particular work has undoubtedly  fallen, for another copy produced only L6 the June following. Nor,  should I imagine, would 'L'Histoire du Noble Chavelier Berinus,' a  quarto book printed at Paris, without date, sell for as much as L7 7s.  at the present time, or 'Le Livre de Beufves de Hautonne,' folio, Paris,  1502, for L13 13s., or 'L'Histoire Merveilleuse du Grand Chan de  Tartarie,' folio, 1524, for L22.    The twelve pages devoted to the enumeration of works of chivalry and  romance glow with the martial achievements of Palmerin of England,  Godeffroy de Boulion, Perceforest, Roy de la Grande Bretaigne, Perceval  le Galleys, and scores of other champions who went about rescuing  damsels in distress, sleeping in enchanted castles, and challenging the  whole civilized race of men, one at a time, to mortal combat.  Perceforest, by the way, in six folio volumes, Paris, 1528, went for  L30, a fact worthy of note, inasmuch as another copy sold, a few months  ago, for L10 l0s. Of all the knights of ancient days, the regal  Perceforest was the least worthy of credence, which is saying a great  deal.  His folios bristle with dragons, necromancers of the worst type,  heroic rescues, combats with giants, devils, and all kinds of monsters  who strove, and in vain, to destroy this past-master of Quixotic  enterprise.  That such books did at one time exercise considerable  influence over adventurous spirits is undoubted. They were the only  novels of the day,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46303"],[0,"South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol. 6 (of 8) (#4)"],[1,"                |     97  |   1035   |      |  Prisoners who have died in captivity    |      4  |     92   |      |  Died of disease                         |    174  |   7011   |      |  Accidental deaths                       |      5  |    200   |      |                                          +---------+----------+      |    Total deaths in South Africa          |    604  | 11,554   |      |  Missing and prisoners (excluding those  |         |          |      |    who have been recovered or have       |         |          |      |    died in captivity)                    |      7  |    898[C]|      |  Sent home as invalids                   |   1638  | 36,986[C]|      |                                          +---------+----------+      |    Total, South African Field Force      |   2249    49,438   |      |                                          |      \\    /        |      |                                          |     51,687[D]      |      +------------------------------------------+---------+----------+      |Total reduction of the Military Forces    |         |          |      |    through war in South Africa--         |         |          |      |  Deaths in South Africa                  |    604  | 11,554   |      |  Missing and prisoners                   |      7  |    898[D]|      |  Invalids sent home who have died        |      4  |    243   |      |  Invalids sent home who have left the    |         |          |      |    Service as unfit                      |    ...  |   1570   |      |                                          +---------+----------+      |                                          |    615    14,265   |      |                                          |      \\      /      |      |                                          |     14,380[E]      |      +------------------------------------------+--------------------+    FOOTNOTES:    [C] Of these, 243 have died, 1570 have been discharged from the Service  as unfit, and 654 are in hospital.

MAP ILLUSTRATING GENERAL BULLER'S CAMPAIGN IN NATAL--MAY-JUNE 1900.]          SOUTH AFRICA AND THE TRANSVAAL WAR          CHAPTER I    TO QUEEN VICTORIA          \"May children of our children say,      'She wrought her people lasting good;        'Her court was pure; her life serene;        God gave her peace; her land reposed;        A thousand claims to reverence closed      In her as Mother, Wife, and Queen;        'And statesmen at her council met        Who knew the seasons when to take        Occasion by the hand, and make      The bounds of freedom wider yet        'By shaping some august decree,        Which kept her throne unshaken still,        Broadbased upon her people's will,      And compass'd by the inviolate sea.'\"        --TENNYSON.      PRETORIA    Pretoria, like most South African towns, dozes in the lap of the hills,  dozes tranquilly in a haven of generous nature, as dozed her Dutchmen in  the midst of growing civilisation. The place from the distance is fair to  the eye, poplar-groved, verdant, and picturesque, with the glimmer of red  roofs cutting against the green, and veils of gauzy clouds, now grey, now  purple, now azure, interlacing the hills and linking them with the sky.  Its quaint, old, low-storeyed houses--in some cases thatched like  bungalows--and its more modern tenements roofed with zinc, and bounded by  pleasant rose-gardens tangled with flowers, seemed to the new-comers  strangely suburban in contrast with the imposing Government buildings and  shops which were soon alive with all the fluster of nineteenth-century  money-getting.    For the great entry made, the capital was swift to resume its everyday  aspect, and trade grew even brisker than before. Famine prices reigned:  though in some hotels where comforts were many, baths and sanitary  arrangements were primitive. The Boers were busy \"making hay while the  sun shone,\" consequently living became twice as expensive as in England;  and, what was worse, with the enormous and somewhat voracious army to be  fed, supplies threatened at no very remote date to become exhausted.    At first all things seemed to denote that the war was practically over,  that nothing remained but to accept the surrender of the defeated Boers,  and to settle quickly the administration of the conquered Republics. By  degrees, however, disappointment set in--disappointment not unmixed with  alarm. The redoubtable Christian de Wet had theories of his own; he put  on his shoulders the mantle of the deposed Cronje, and set to work to  show his generalship by destroying the railway in the south, cutting the  telegraph wires, and generally harassing the lines of communication.  Indeed, there was every appearance that the late investing forces might  in their turn become invested in the capital. Postal and telegraphic  communications were cut, supplies and reinforcements were menaced, and  gradually the sunny outlook of conquest grew nebulous.    The defeated forces also began to concentrate at Machadodorp, beyond  Middelburg, where Mr. Kruger was actively engaged in conference with his  friends. They were not devoid of funds, for it was found that before  leaving Pretoria the Boer officials had provided themselves with L300,000  from the National Bank, and while this sum lasted and he remained in the  country, it was argued that Mr. Kruger's schemes of bribery and  corruption might be expected to continue, and even develop. Still Lord  Roberts was undismayed! He had foreseen attacks on his communications,  but had hazarded all on the one throw of reaching the capital before the  Boers could gather together their forces for organised resistance,  pushing forward in the only way possible if the conquered were to be left  breathless. Napoleon's advice to one of his marshals, \"A  commander-in-chief should never give rest either to the victor or the  vanquished,\" had been followed to the foot of the letter, as the French  say.    In this notable march the marvellous genius of Lord Roberts had been  shown in many ways, but in courage before all. He had adapted his  fighting dispositions on a system specially suitable to the  idiosyncrasies of the Boers--had observed their natural disinclination to  take the initiative, their failure to act on the offensive rather than  the defensive, and, on this discovery, had invented new tactics which  were exactly appropriate and eminently successful. His infantry had made  the centre of the advancing line to east and west of the rail,  perpetually threatening the enemy with frontal attack, while active and  competent wings of mounted troops unceasingly wheeled round both flanks,  threatening to turn them so soon as opportunity should offer. Thus the  Boers, for fear of being outflanked, were forced to extend their front  till the central position--at the railway line--became too weak for  resistance, and they had of necessity to retreat, and continue to  retreat, till they were too exhausted to do more than run.    At the Chief's masterly combinations, his ingenious synchronal schemes,  his almost prophetic foresight regarding the positions of the enemy, and  the effect of his every move upon those positions, it is impossible not  to marvel--as at the amazing boldness and rapidity of execution with  which was developed a design which brought him with his enormous army in  little more than a month from Bloemfontein to Pretoria.    From the following general order issued on his arrival at his destination  it is possible to understand the magnitude and the daring of the Chief's  plan, which, merely to read of, renders one almost breathless:--         \"PRETORIA, _June 7_.         \"In congratulating the British Army in South Africa on the       occupation of Johannesburg and Pretoria, the one being the       principal town and the other the capital of the Transvaal, and       also on the relief of Mafeking after a heroic defence of over       200 days, the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-chief desires to       place on record his high appreciation of the gallantry and       endurance displayed by the troops, both those who have taken       part in the advance across the Vaal River and those who have       been employed in the less arduous duty of protecting the line       of communication through the Orange River Colony.         \"After the force reached Bloemfontein on March 13, it was       necessary to halt there for a certain period. Through railway       communication with Cape Colony had to be restored before       supplies and necessaries of all kinds could be got up from the       base. The rapid advance from the Modder River, and the want of       forage _en route_, had told on the horses of the cavalry,       artillery, mounted infantry, and the transport mules and oxen,       and to replace these casualties a considerable number of       animals had to be provided. Throughout the six weeks the army       remained halted at Bloemfontein the enemy showed considerable       activity, especially in the south-eastern portion of the Orange       River Colony, but by the beginning of May everything was in       readiness for a further advance into the enemy's country, and       on the 2nd of that month active operations were again       commenced.         \"On May 12, Kroonstad, where Mr. Steyn had established the       so-called government of the Orange Free State, was entered. On       May 17, Mafeking was relieved. On May 31 Johannesburg was       occupied, and on June 5 the British flag waved over Pretoria.         \"During these thirty-five days, the main body of the force       marched 300 miles,"]]]
