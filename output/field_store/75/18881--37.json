The governor, seeing that it was the order of the  Archbishop, obeyed, and they dressed the licentiate in his own clothes,  which were new and decent. He, as soon as he saw himself clothed like one  in his senses, and divested of the appearance of a madman, entreated the  chaplain to permit him in charity to go and take leave of his comrades  the madmen. The chaplain said he would go with him to see what madmen  there were in the house; so they went upstairs, and with them some of  those who were present. Approaching a cage in which there was a furious  madman, though just at that moment calm and quiet, the licentiate said to  him, 'Brother, think if you have any commands for me, for I am going  home, as God has been pleased, in his infinite goodness and mercy,  without any merit of mine, to restore me my reason. I am now cured and in  my senses, for with God's power nothing is impossible. Have strong hope  and trust in him, for as he has restored me to my original condition, so  likewise he will restore you if you trust in him. I will take care to  send you some good things to eat; and be sure you eat them; for I would  have you know I am convinced, as one who has gone through it, that all  this madness of ours comes of having the stomach empty and the brains  full of wind. Take courage! take courage! for despondency in misfortune  breaks down health and brings on death.'    \"To all these words of the licentiate another madman in a cage opposite  that of the furious one was listening; and raising himself up from an old  mat on which he lay stark naked, he asked in a loud voice who it was that  was going away cured and in his senses. The licentiate answered, 'It is  I, brother, who am going; I have now no need to remain here any longer,  for which I return infinite thanks to Heaven that has had so great mercy  upon me.'    \"'Mind what you are saying, licentiate; don't let the devil deceive you,'  replied the madman. 'Keep quiet, stay where you are, and you will save  yourself the trouble of coming back.'    \"'I know I am cured,' returned the licentiate, 'and that I shall not have  to go stations again.'    \"'You cured!' said the madman; 'well, we shall see; God be with you; but  I swear to you by Jupiter, whose majesty I represent on earth, that for  this crime alone, which Seville is committing to-day in releasing you  from this house, and treating you as if you were in your senses, I shall  have to inflict such a punishment on it as will be remembered for ages  and ages, amen. Dost thou not know, thou miserable little licentiate,  that I can do it, being, as I say, Jupiter the Thunderer, who hold in my  hands the fiery bolts with which I am able and am wont to threaten and  lay waste the world? But in one way only will I punish this ignorant  town, and that is by not raining upon it, nor on any part of its district  or territory, for three whole years, to be reckoned from the day and  moment when this threat is pronounced. Thou free, thou cured, thou in thy  senses! and I mad, I disordered, I bound! I will as soon think of sending  rain as of hanging myself.    \"Those present stood listening to the words and exclamations of the  madman; but our licentiate, turning to the chaplain and seizing him by  the hands, said to him, 'Be not uneasy, senor; attach no importance to  what this madman has said; for if he is Jupiter and will not send rain,  I, who am Neptune, the father and god of the waters, will rain as often  as it pleases me and may be needful.'    \"The governor and the bystanders laughed, and at their laughter the  chaplain was half ashamed, and he replied, 'For all that, Senor Neptune,  it will not do to vex Senor Jupiter; remain where you are, and some other  day, when there is a better opportunity and more time, we will come back  for you.' So they stripped the licentiate, and he was left where he was;  and that's the end of the story.\"    \"So that's the story, master barber,\" said Don Quixote, \"which came in so  pat to the purpose that you could not help telling it? Master shaver,  master shaver! how blind is he who cannot see through a sieve. Is it  possible that you do not know that comparisons of wit with wit, valour  with valour, beauty with beauty, birth with birth, are always odious and  unwelcome? I, master barber, am not Neptune, the god of the waters, nor  do I try to make anyone take me for an astute man, for I am not one. My  only endeavour is to convince the world of the mistake it makes in not  reviving in itself the happy time when the order of knight-errantry was  in the field. But our depraved age does not deserve to enjoy such a  blessing as those ages enjoyed when knights-errant took upon their  shoulders the defence of kingdoms, the protection of damsels, the succour  of orphans and minors, the chastisement of the proud, and the recompense  of the humble. With the knights of these days, for the most part, it is  the damask, brocade, and rich stuffs they wear, that rustle as they go,  not the chain mail of their armour; no knight now-a-days sleeps in the  open field exposed to the inclemency of heaven, and in full panoply from  head to foot; no one now takes a nap, as they call it, without drawing  his feet out of the stirrups, and leaning upon his lance, as the  knights-errant used to do; no one now, issuing from the wood, penetrates  yonder mountains, and then treads the barren, lonely shore of the  sea--mostly a tempestuous and stormy one--and finding on the beach a  little bark without oars, sail, mast, or tackling of any kind, in the  intrepidity of his heart flings himself into it and commits himself to  the wrathful billows of the deep sea, that one moment lift him up to  heaven and the next plunge him into the depths; and opposing his breast  to the irresistible gale, finds himself, when he least expects it, three  thousand leagues and more away from the place where he embarked; and  leaping ashore in a remote and unknown land has adventures that deserve  to be written, not on parchment, but on brass. But now sloth triumphs  over energy, indolence over exertion, vice over virtue, arrogance over  courage, and theory over practice in arms, which flourished and shone  only in the golden ages and in knights-errant. For tell me, who was more  virtuous and more valiant than the famous Amadis of Gaul? Who more  discreet than Palmerin of England? Who more gracious and easy than  Tirante el Blanco? Who more courtly than Lisuarte of Greece? Who more  slashed or slashing than Don Belianis? Who more intrepid than Perion of  Gaul? Who more ready to face danger than Felixmarte of Hircania? Who more  sincere than Esplandian? Who more impetuous than Don Cirongilio of  Thrace? Who more bold than Rodamonte? Who more prudent than King Sobrino?  Who more daring than Reinaldos? Who more invincible than Roland? and who  more gallant and courteous than Ruggiero, from whom the dukes of Ferrara  of the present day are descended, according to Turpin in his  'Cosmography.' All these knights, and many more that I could name, senor  curate, were knights-errant, the light and glory of chivalry. These, or  such as these, I would have to carry out my plan, and in that case his  Majesty would find himself well served and would save great expense, and  the Turk would be left tearing his beard. And so I will stay where I am,  as the chaplain does not take me away; and if Jupiter, as the barber has  told us, will not send rain, here am I, and I will rain when I please. I  say this that Master Basin may know that I understand him.\"    \"Indeed, Senor Don Quixote,\" said the barber, \"I did not mean it in that  way, and, so help me God, my intention was good, and your worship ought  not to be vexed.\"    \"As to whether I ought to be vexed or not,\" returned Don Quixote, \"I  myself am the best judge.\"    Hereupon the curate observed, \"I have hardly said a word as yet; and I  would gladly be relieved of a doubt, arising from what Don Quixote has  said, that worries and works my conscience.\"    \"The senor curate has leave for more than that,\" returned Don Quixote,  \"so he may declare his doubt, for it is not pleasant to have a doubt on  one's conscience.\"    \"Well then, with that permission,\" said the curate, \"I say my doubt is  that, all I can do, I cannot persuade myself that the whole pack of  knights-errant you, Senor Don Quixote, have mentioned, were really and  truly persons of flesh and blood, that ever lived in the world; on the  contrary, I suspect it to be all fiction, fable, and falsehood, and  dreams told by men awakened from sleep, or rather still half asleep.\"    \"That is another mistake,\" replied Don Quixote, \"into which many have  fallen who do not believe that there ever were such knights in the world,  and I have often, with divers people and on divers occasions, tried to  expose this almost universal error to the light of truth. Sometimes I  have not been successful in my purpose, sometimes I have, supporting it  upon the shoulders of the truth; which truth is so clear that I can  almost say I have with my own eyes seen Amadis of Gaul, who was a man of  lofty stature, fair complexion, with a handsome though black beard, of a  countenance between gentle and stern in expression, sparing of words,  slow to anger, and quick to put it away from him; and as I have depicted  Amadis, so I could, I think, portray and describe all the knights-errant  that are in all the histories in the world; for by the perception I have  that they were what their histories describe, and by the deeds they did  and the dispositions they displayed, it is possible, with the aid of  sound philosophy, to deduce their features, complexion, and stature.\"    \"How big, in your worship's opinion, may the giant Morgante have been,  Senor Don Quixote?\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/597"],[0,"The Story of Burnt Njal: The Great Icelandic Tribune, Jurist, and Counsellor (#4)"],[1,"never come  more.\"    Now she rides home from the Thing, and Hrut had come back before  her, and made her hearty welcome.  She answered him kindly, and  was blithe and forbearing towards him.  So they lived happily  together that half-year; but when spring came she fell sick, and  kept her bed.  Hrut set off west to the Firths, and bade them  tend her well before he went.  Now, when the time for the Thing  comes, she busked herself to ride away, and did in every way as  had been laid down for her; and then she rides away to the Thing.  The country folk looked for her, but could not find her.  Mord  made his daughter welcome, and asked her if she had followed his  advice; and she says, \"I have not broken one tittle of it.\"    Then she went to the Hill of Laws, and declared herself separated  from Hrut; and men thought this strange news.  Unna went home  with her father, and never went west from that day forward.        8. MORD CLAIMS HIS GOODS FROM HRUT    Hrut came home, and knit his brows when he heard his wife was  gone, but yet kept his feelings well in hand, and stayed at home  all that half-year, and spoke to no one on the matter.  Next  summer he rode to the Thing, with his brother Hauskuld, and they  had a great fellowing.  But when he came to the Thing, he asked  whether Fiddle Mord were at the Thing, and they told him he was;  and all thought they would come to words at once about their  matter, but it was not so.  At last, one day when the brothers  and others who were at the Thing went to the Hill of Laws, Mord  took witness and declared that he had a money-suit against Hrut  for his daughter's dower, and reckoned the amount at ninety  hundreds in goods, calling on Hrut at the same time to pay and  hand it over to him, and asking for a fine of three marks.  He  laid the suit in the Quarter Court, into which it would come by  law, and gave lawful notice, so that all who stood on the Hill of  Laws might hear.    But when he had thus spoken, Hrut said, \"Thou hast undertaken  this suit, which belongs to thy daughter, rather for the greed of  gain and love of strife than in kindliness and manliness.  But I  shall have something to say against it; for the goods which  belong to me are not yet in thy hands.  Now, what I have to say  is this, and I say it out, so that all who hear me on this hill  may bear witness: I challenge thee to fight on the island; there  on one side shall be laid all thy daughter's dower, and on the  other I will lay down goods worth as much, and whoever wins the  day shall have both dower and goods; but if thou wilt not fight  with me, then thou shalt give up all claim to these goods.\"    Then Mord held his peace, and took counsel with his friends about  going to fight on the island, and Jorund the priest gave him an  answer.    \"There is no need for thee to come to ask us for counsel in this  matter, for thou knowest if thou fightest with Hrut thou wilt  lose both life and goods.  He has a good cause, and is besides  mighty in himself and one of the boldest of men.\"    Then Mord spoke out, that he would not fight with Hrut, and there  arose a great shout and hooting on the hill, and Mord got the  greatest shame by his suit.    After that men ride home from the Thing, and those brothers  Hauskuld and Hrut ride west to Reykriverdale, and turned in as  guests at Lund, where Thiostolf, Bjorn Gullbera's son, then  dwelt.  There had been much rain that day, and men got wet, so  long-fires were made down the length of the hall.  Thiostolf, the  master of the house, sat between Hauskuld and Hrut, and two boys,  of whom Thiostolf had the rearing, were playing on the floor, and  a girl was playing with them.  They were great chatterboxes, for  they were too young to know better.  So one of them said, \"Now I  will be Mord, and summon thee to lose thy wife because thou hast  not been a good husband to her.\"    Then the other answered, \"I will be Hrut, and I call on thee to  give up all claim to thy goods, if thou darest not to fight with  me.\"    This they said several times, and all the household burst out  laughing.  Then Hauskuld got wroth, and struck the boy who called  himself Mord with a switch, and the blow fell on his face, and  grazed the skin.    \"Get out with thee,\" said Hauskuld to the boy, \"and make no game  of us;\" but Hrut said, \"Come hitherto me,\" and the boy did so.  Then Hrut drew a ring from his finger and gave it to him, and  said, \"Go away, and try no man's temper henceforth.\"    Then the boy went away saying, \"Thy manliness I will bear in mind  all my life.\"    From this matter Hrut got great praise, and after that they went  home; and that was the end of Mord's and Hrut's quarrel,        9. THORWALD GETS HALLGERDA TO WIFE    Now, it must be told how Hallgerda, Hauskuld's daughter, grows  up, and is the fairest of women to look on; she was tall of  stature, too, and therefore she was called \"Longcoat.\"  She was  fair-haired, and had so much of it that she could hide herself in  it; but she was layish and hard-hearted.  Her foster-father's  name was Thiostolf: he was a Southislander (1) by stock: he was a  strong man, well skilled in arms, and had slain many men, and  made no atonement in money for one of them.  It was said, too,  that his rearing had not bettered Hallgerda's temper.    There was a man named Thorwald; he was Oswif's son, and dwelt out  on Middlefells strand, under the Fell.  He was rich and well to  do, and owned the islands called Bearisles, which lie out in  Broadfirth, whence he got meal and stock fish.  This Thorwald was  a strong and courteous man, though somewhat hasty in temper.  Now, it fell out one day that Thorwald and his father were  talking together of Thorwald's marrying, and where he had best  look for a wife, and it soon came out that he thought there  wasn't a match fit for him far or near.    \"Well,\" said Oswif, \"wilt thou ask for Hallgerda Longcoat,  Hauskuld's daughter.\"    \"Yes!  I will ask for her,\" said Thorwald.    \"But that is not a match that will suit either of you,\" Oswif  went on to say, \"for she has a will of her own, and thou art  stern-tempered and unyielding.\"    \"For all that I will try my luck there,\" said Thorwald, \"so it's  no good trying to hinder me.\"    \"Ay!\" said Oswif, \"and the risk is all thine own.\"    After that they set off on a wooing journey to Hauskuldstede, and  had a hearty welcome.  They were not long in telling Hauskuld  their business, and began to woo; then Hauskuld answered, \"As for  you, I know how you both stand in the world, but for my own part  I will use no guile towards you.  My daughter has a hard temper,  but as to her looks and breeding you can both see for  yourselves.\"    \"Lay down the terms of the match,\" answered Thorwald, \"for I will  not let her temper stand in the way of our bargain.\"    Then they talked over the terms of the bargain, and Hauskuld  never asked his daughter what she thought of it, for his heart  was set on giving her away and so they came to an understanding  as to the terms of the match.  After that Thorwald betrothed  himself to Hallgerda, and rode away home when the matter was  settled.      ENDNOTES:    (1)  That is, he came from what we call the Western Isles or       Hebrides.  The old appellation still lingers in \"Sodor (i.e.       the South Isles) and Man.\"        10. HALLGERDA'S WEDDING    Hauskuld told Hallgerda of the bargain he had made, and she said,  \"Now that has been put to the proof which I have all along been  afraid of, that thou lovest me not so much as thou art always  saying, when thou hast not thought it worth while to tell me a  word of all this matter.  Besides, I do not think this match so  good a one as thou hast always promised me.\"    So she went on, and let them know in every way that she thought  she was thrown away.    Then Hauskuld said, \"I do not set so much store by thy pride as  to let it stand in the way of my bargains; and my will, not  thine, shall carry the day if we fall out on any point.\"    \"The pride of all you kinsfolk is great,\" she said, \"and so it is  not wonderful if I have some of it.\"    With that she went away, and found her foster-father Thiostolf,  and told him what was in store for her, and was very heavy-  hearted.  Then Thiostolf said, \"Be of good cheer, for thou wilt  be married a second time, and then they will ask thee what thou  thinkest of the match; for I will do in all things as thou  wishest, except in what touches thy father or Hrut.\"    After that they spoke no more of the matter, and Hauskuld made  ready the bridal feast, and rode off to ask men to it.  So he  came to Hrutstede and called Hrut out to speak with him.  Hrut  went out, and they began to talk, and Hauskuld told him the whole  story of the bargain, and bade him to the feast, saying, \"I  should be glad to know that thou dost not feel hurt though I did  not tell thee when the bargain was being made.\"    \"I should be better pleased,\" said Hrut \"to have nothing at all  to do with it; for this match will bring luck neither to him nor  to her; but still I will come to the feast if thou thinkest it  will add any honour to thee.\"    \"Of course I think so,\" said Hauskuld, and rode off home.    Oswif and Thorwald also asked men to come, so that no fewer than  one hundred guests were asked.    There was a man named Swan, who dwelt in Bearfirth, which lies  north from Steingrimsfirth.  This Swan was a great wizard, and he  was Hallgerda's mother's brother.  He was quarrelsome, and hard  to deal with, but Hallgerda asked him to the feast, and sends  Thiostolf to him; so he went, and it soon got to friendship  between him and Swan.    Now men come to the feast, and Hallgerda sat upon the cross-  bench, and she was a very merry bride.  Thiostolf was always  talking to her, though he sometimes found time to speak to Swan,  and men thought their talking strange.  The feast went off well,  and Hauskuld paid down Hallgerda's portion with the greatest"]]]
