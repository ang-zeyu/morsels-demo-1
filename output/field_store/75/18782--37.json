The other shook his head.    \"Whom am I supposed to see?\" he asked.    \"Why, Koku is at the other end of the wire. I'm having him help  me.\"    Ned gazed from the polished plate out of a side window of the  shop, into the yard.    \"Well, that Koku is certainly a wonderful giant,\" said Ned, with a  laugh.    \"How so?\" asked Tom.    \"Why he can not be in two places at once. You say he ought to be  at the other end of this wire, and there he is out there, spading  up the garden.\"    Tom stared for a second and then exclaimed:    \"Well, if that isn't the limit! I put him in the telephone booth  in the machine shop, and told him to stay there until I was  through. What in the world is he doing out there?\"    \"Koku!\" he called to the giant, \"why didn't you stay at the  telephone where I put you? Why did you run away?\"    \"Ha!\" exclaimed the giant, who, for all his great size was a  simple chap, \"little thing go 'tick-tick' and then 'clap-clap!'  Koku no like--Koku t'ink bad spirit in telumfoam--Koku come out!\"    \"Well, no wonder I couldn't see any image on the plate!\" exclaimed  Tom. \"There was nobody there. Now, Ned, you try it; will you,  please?\"    \"Sure. Anything to oblige!\"    \"Then go in the other telephone booth. You can talk to me on the  wire. Say anything you like--the telephone part is all right. Then  you just stand so that the light in the booth shines on your face.  The machine will do the rest--if it works.\"    Ned hurried off and was soon talking to his chum over the wire  from the branch telephone in the machine shop. Ned stood in the  glare of an electric light, and looked at a polished plate similar  to the one in the other booth.    \"Are you there, Ned?\" asked Tom.    \"Yes, I'm here.\"    \"Is the light on?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"And you're looking at the plate?\"    \"Sure. Can you see any reflection in your plate?\"    \"No, not a thing,\" answered Tom, and there was great  discouragement in his voice. \"The thing is a failure, Ned. Come on  back,\" and the young banker could hear his chum hang up the  telephone receiver at the other end.    \"That's too bad,\" murmured Ned, knowing how Tom must feel. \"I'll  have to cheer him up a bit.\"            CHAPTER IV    RUN DOWN      When Ned Newton got back to where Tom sat in the small telephone  booth, the young banker found his chum staring rather moodily at  the polished metal plate on the shelf that held the talking  instrument.    \"So it was no go; eh, Tom?\"    \"No go at all, Ned, and I thought sure I had it right this time.\"    \"Then this isn't your first experiment?\"    \"Land no! I've been at it, off and on, for over a month, and I  can't seem to get any farther. I'm up against a snag now, good and  hard.\"    \"Then there wasn't any image on your plate?\"    \"Not a thing, Ned. I don't suppose you caught any glimpse of me in  your plate?\" asked Tom, half hopefully.    \"No. I couldn't see a thing. So you are going to try and make this  thing work both ways, are you?\"    \"That's my intention, But I can fix it so that a person can  control the apparatus at his end, and only see the person he is  talking to, not being seen himself, unless he wishes it. That is,  I hope to do that. Just now nobody can see anybody,\" and Tom  sighed.    \"Give it up,\" advised Ned. \"It's too hard a nut to crack, Tom!\"    \"Indeed, I'll not give it up, Ned! I'm going to work along a new  line. I must try a different solution of selenium on the metal  plate. Perhaps I may have to try using a sensitized plate, and  develop it later, though I do want to get the machine down so you  can see a perfect image without the need of developing. And I  will, too!\" cried Tom. \"I'll get some new selenium.\"    Eradicate, who came into the shop just then, heard the end of  Tom's remarks. A strange look came over his honest black face, and  he exclaimed:    \"What all am dat, Massa Tom? Yo'ah gwine t' bring de new millenium  heah? Dat's de end of de world, ain't it-dat millenium? Golly!  Dish yeah coon neber 'spected t' lib t' see dat. De millenium! Oh  mah landy!\"    \"No, Rad!\" laughed Tom. \"I was speaking about selenium, a sort of  metallic combination that is a peculiar conductor of electricity.  The more light that shines on it the better conductor it is, and  the less light, the poorer.\"    \"It must be queer stuff,\" said Ned.    \"It is,\" declared Tom. \"I think it is the only thing to use in  this photo telephone experiment, though I might try the metal  plate method, as they did between Monte Carlo and Paris. But I am  not trying to make newspaper pictures.\"    \"What is selenium, anyhow?\" asked Ned. \"Remember, Tom, I'm not up  on this scientific stuff as you are.\"    \"Selenium,\" went on Tom, \"was discovered in 1817, by J. J.  Berzelius, and he gave it that name from the Greek word for moon,  on account of selenium being so similar, in some ways, to  tellurium. That last is named after the Latin word tellus, the  earth.\"    \"Do they dig it?\" Ned wanted to know.    \"Well, sometimes selenium is found in combination with metals, in  the form of selenides, the more important minerals of that kind  being eucharite, crooksite, clausthalite, naumannite and zorgite--\"    \"Good night!\" interrupted Ned, with a laugh, holding up his hands.  \"Stop it, Tom!\" he pleaded. \"You'll give me a headache with all  those big words.\"    \"Oh, they're easy, once you get used to them,\" said the young  inventor, with a smile. \"Perhaps it will be easier if I say that  sometimes selenium is found in native sulphur. Selenium is usually  obtained from the flue-dust or chamber deposits of some factory  where sulphuric acid is made. They take this dust and treat it  with acids until they get the pure selenium. Sometimes selenium  comes in crystal forms, and again it is combined with various  metals for different uses.\"    \"There's one good thing about it. There are several varieties, and  I'll try them all before I give up.\"    \"That's the way to talk!\" cried Ned. \"Never say die! Don't give up  the ship, and all that. But, Tom, what you need now is a little  fun. You've been poking away at this too long. Come on out on the  lake, and have a ride in the motor boat. It will do you good. It  will do me good. I'm a bit rusty myself--been working hard lately.  Come on--let's go out on the lake.\"    \"I believe I will!\" exclaimed Tom, after thinking it over for a  moment. \"I need a little fresh air. Sitting in that telephone  booth, trying to get an image on a plate, and not succeeding, has  gotten on my nerves. I want to write out an order for Koku to take  to town, though. I want to get some fresh selenium, and then I'm  going to make new plates.\"    Tom made some memoranda, and then, giving Koku the order for the  chemist, the young inventor closed up his shop, and went with Ned  down to Lake Carlopa, where the motor boat was moored.    This was not the same boat Tom had first purchased, some years  ago, but a comparatively new and powerful craft.    \"It sure is one grand little day for a ride,\" remarked Ned, as he  got in the craft, while Tom looked over the engine.    \"Yes, I'm glad you came over, and routed me out,\" said the young  inventor. \"When I get going on a thing I don't know enough to  stop. Oh, I forgot something!\"    \"What?\" asked Ned.    \"I forgot to leave word about Mr. Railing's airship. It's all  fixed and ready for him, but I put on a new control, and I wanted  to explain to him about it. He might not know how to work it. I  left word with father, though, that if he came for it he must not  try it until he had seen me. I guess it will be all right. I don't  want to go back to the house now.\"    \"No, it's too far,\" agreed Ned.    \"I have it!\" exclaimed Tom. \"I'll telephone to dad from here, not  to let Halling go up until I come back. He may not come for his  machine; but, if he does, it's best to be on the safe side Ned.\"    \"Oh, sure.\"    Accordingly, Tom 'phoned from his boat-house, and Mr. Swift  promised to see the bird-man if he called. Then Ned and Tom gave  themselves up to the delights of a trip on the water.    The Kilo, which name Tom had selected for his new craft, was a  powerful boat, and comfortable. It swept on down the lake, and  many other persons, in their pleasure craft, turned to look at  Tom's fine one.    \"Lots of folks out to-day,\" observed Ned, as they went around a  point of the shore.    \"Yes, quite a number,\" agreed Tom, leaning forward to adjust the  motor. \"I wonder what's got into her?\" he said, in some annoyance,  as he made various adjustments. \"One of the cylinders is missing.\"    \"Maybe it needs a new spark plug,\" suggested Ned.    \"Maybe. Guess I'll stop and put one in.\"    Tom slowed down the motor, and headed his boat over toward shore,  intending to tie up there for a while.    As he shifted the wheel he heard a cry behind him, and at the same  time a hoarse, domineering voice called out:    \"Here, what do you mean, changing your course that way? Look out,  or I'll run you down! Get out of my way, you land-lubber, you!\"    Startled, Ned and Tom turned. They saw, rushing up on them from  astern, a powerful red motor boat, at the wheel of which sat a  stout man, with a very florid face and a commanding air.    \"Get out of my way!\" he cried. \"I can't stop so short! Look out,  or I'll run you down!\"    Tom, with a fierce feeling of resentment at the fellow, was about  to shift the course of the Kilo, but he was too late.    A moment later there came a smashing blow on the stern port  quarter and the Kilo heeled over at a dangerous angle, while, with  a rending, splintering sound of wood, the big red motorboat swept  on past Tom and Ned, her rubstreak grinding along the side of the  Kilo.            CHAPTER V    SHARP WORDS      \"Great Scott, Tom! What happened?\"    \"I know as much as you, Ned. That fellow ran us down, that's all.\"    \"Are we leaking?\" and with this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4544"],[0,"The Cell of Self-Knowledge : seven early English mystical treatises printed (#4)"],[1,"t; for when he was born, his  mother cried and said: \"God hath seen my meekness.\"[35] And man's  soul, in such a consideration of his old sins and of the power of  the Doomsman, beginneth then truly to see God by feeling of dread,  and also to be seen of God by rewarding of pity.          CAPITULUM II    HOW SORROW RISETH IN THE AFFECTION      WHILE Reuben waxeth, Simeon is born; for after dread it needeth  greatly that sorrow come soon. For ever the more that a man dreadeth  the pain that he hath deserved, the bitterlier he sorroweth the sins  that he hath done. Leah in the birth of Simeon cried and said: \"Our  Lord hath heard me be had in despite.\"[36] And therefore is Simeon  cleped \"hearing\";[37] for when a man bitterly sorroweth and  despiseth his old sins, then beginneth he to be heard of God, and  also for to hear the blessed sentence of God's own mouth: \"Blessed  be they that sorrow, for they shall be comforted.\"[38] For in what  hour the sinner sorroweth and turneth from his sin, he shall be  safe.[39] Thus witnesseth holy Scripture. And also by Reuben he is  meeked,[40] and by Simeon he is contrite and hath compunction of  tears; but, as witnesseth David in the psalm: \"Heart contrite and  meeked God shall not despise\";[41] and without doubt such sorrow  bringeth in true comfort of heart.          CAPITULUM III    HOW HOPE RISETH IN THE AFFECTION      BUT, I pray thee, what comfort may be to them that truly dread and  bitterly sorrow for their old sins, ought but a true hope of  forgiveness? the which is the third son of Jacob, that is Levi, the  which is cleped in the story \"a doing to.\"[42] For when the other  two children, dread and sorrow, are given of God to a man's soul,  without doubt he this third, that is hope, shall not be delayed, but  he shall be lone to;[43] as the story witnesseth of Levi, that, when  his two brethren, Reuben and Simeon, were given to their mother  Leah, he, this Levi, was done to. Take heed of this word, that he  was \"done to\" and not given. And therefore it is said that a man  shall not presume of hope of forgiveness before the time that his  heart be peeked in dread and contrite in sorrow; without these two,  hope is presumption, and where these two are, hope is done to; and  thus after sorrow cometh soon comfort, as David telleth in the psalm  that \"after the muchness of my sorrow in my heart,\" he saith to our  Lord, \"Thy comforts have gladded my soul.\"[44] And therefore it is  that the Holy Ghost is called Paracletus, that is, comforter, for  oft times he vouchethsafe to comfort a sorrowful soul.          CAPITULUM IV    HOW LOVE RISETH IN THE AFFECTION      FROM now forth beginneth a manner of homeliness for to grow between  God and a man's soul; and also on a manner a kindling of love, in so  much that oft times he feeleth him not only be visited of God and  comforted in His coming, but oft times also he feeleth him filled  with an unspeakable joy. This homeliness and this kindling of love  first felt Leah, when, after that Levi was born, she cried with a  great voice and said: \"Now shall my husband be coupled to me.\"[45]  The true spouse of our soul is God, and then are we truly coupled  unto Him, when we draw near Him by hope and soothfast love. And  right as after hope cometh love, so after Levi was Judah born, the  fourth son of Leah. Leah in his birth cried and said: \"Now shall I  shrive to our Lord.\"[46] And therefore in the story is Judah cleped  \"Shrift.\"[47] Also man's soul in this degree of love offereth it  clearly to God, and saith thus: \"Now shall I shrive to our Lord.\"  For before this feeling of love in a man's soul, all that he doth is  done more for dread than for love; but in this state a man's soul  feeleth God so sweet, so merciful, so good, so courteous, so true,  and so kind, so faithful, so lovely and so homely, that he leaveth  nothing in him--might, wit, conning,[48] or will--that he offereth  not it clearly, freely, and homely unto Him. This shrift is not only  of sin, but of the goodness of God. Great token of love it is when a  man telleth to God that He is good. Of this shrift speaketh David  full oft times in the psalter, when he saith: \"Make it known to God,  for He is good.\"[49]    Lo, now have we said of four sons of Leah. And after this she left  bearing of children till another time; and so man's soul weeneth  that it sufficeth to it when it feeleth that it loveth the true  goods.[50] And so it is enough to salvation, but not to perfection.  For it falleth to a perfect soul both to be inflamed with the fire  of love in the affection, and also to be illumined with the light of  knowing in the reason.          CAPITULUM V    HOW THE DOUBLE SIGHT OF PAIN AND JOY RISETH IN THE IMAGINATION      THEN when Judah waxeth, that is to say, when love and desire of  unseen true goods is rising and waxing in a man's affection; then  coveteth Rachel for to bear some children; that is to say, then  coveteth reason to know these things that affection feeleth; for as  it falleth to the affection for to love, so it falleth to the reason  for to know. Of affection springeth ordained and measured feelings;  and of reason springeth right knowings[51] and clear understandings.  And ever the more that Judah waxeth, that is to say love, so much  the more desireth Rachel bearing of children, that is to say, reason  studieth after knowing. But who is he that woteth not how hard it  is, and nearhand impossible to a fleshly soul the which is yet rude  in ghostly studies, for to rise in knowing of unseeable[52] things,  and for to set the eye of contemplation in ghostly things? For why,  a soul that is yet rude and fleshly, knoweth nought but bodily  things, and nothing cometh yet to the mind but only seeable[53]  things. And, nevertheless, yet it looketh inward as it may; and that  that it may not see yet clearly by ghostly knowing, it thinketh by  imagination.    And this is the cause why Rachel had first children of her maiden  than of herself. And so it is that, though all a man's soul may not  yet get the light of ghostly knowing in the reason, yet it thinketh  it sweet to hold the mind on God and ghostly things in the  imagination. As by Rachel we understand reason, so by her maiden  Bilhah we understand imagination. And, therefore, reason sheweth  that it is more profitable for to think on ghostly things, in what  manner so it be; yea, if it be in kindling of our desire with some  fair imagination; than it is for to think on vanities and deceivable  things of this world. And, therefore, of Bilhah were born these two:  Dan and Naphtali. Dan is to say sight of pains to come; and  Naphtali, sight of joys to come. These two children are full needful  and full speedful unto a working soul; the one for to put down evil  suggestions of sins; and the other for to raise up our wills in  working of good and in kindling of our desires. For as it falleth to  Dan to put down evil suggestions of sin by sight of pains to come,  so it falleth to the other brother Naphtali to raise up our wills in  working of good, and in kindling of holy desires by sight of joys to  come. And therefore holy men, when they are stirred to any unlawful  thing, by inrising of any foul thought, as oft they set before their  mind the pains that are to come; and so they slaken their temptation  in the beginning, ere it rise to any foul delight in their soul. And  as oft as their devotion and their liking in God and ghostly things  cease and wax cold (as oft times it befalleth in this life, for  corruption of the flesh and many other skills),[54] so oft they set  before their mind the joy that is to come. And so they kindle their  will with holy desires, and destroy their temptation in the  beginning, ere it come to any weariness or heaviness of sloth. And  for that[55] with Dan we damn unlawful thoughts, therefore he is  well cleped in the story \"Doom.\"[56] And also his father Jacob said  of him thus: \"Dan shall deem his folk.\"[57] And also it is said in  the story that, when Bilhah brought forth Dan, Rachel said thus:  \"Our Lord hath deemed me\";[58] that is to say: \"Our Lord hath evened  me unto my sister Leah.\" And thus saith reason, when the imagination  hath gotten the sight of pains to come, that our Lord hath evened  her with her sister affection; and she saith thus, for she hath the  sight of pains to come in her imagination, of the which she had  dread and sorrow in her feeling. And then after came Naphtali, that  is to say, the sight of joys to come. And in his birth spake Rachel  and said: \"I am made like to my sister Leah\";[59] and therefore is  Naphtali cleped in the story \"Likeness.\"[60] And thus saith reason  that she is made like to her sister affection. For there as she had  gotten hope and love of joy to come in her feeling, she hath now  gotten sight of joy to come in her imagination. Jacob said of  Naphtali that he was \"a hart sent out, giving speeches of  fairhead.\"[61] So it is that, when we imagine of the joys of heaven,  we say that it is fair in heaven. For[62] wonderfully kindleth  Naphtali our souls with holy desires, as oft as we imagine of the  worthiness and the fairhead of the joys of heaven.          CAPITULUM VI    HOW THE VIRTUES OF ABSTINENCE AND PATIENCE RISE IN THE SENSUALITY      WHEN Leah saw that Rachel her sister made great joy of these two  bastards born of Bilhah her maiden, she called forth her maiden  Zilpah, to put to her husband Jacob; that she might make joy with  her sister, having other two bastards gotten of her maiden Zilpah.  And thus it is seemly in man's soul for to be, that from the time  that reason hath refrained the great jangling of imagination, and  hath put her to be underlout[63] to God, and maketh her to bear some  fruit in helping of her knowing, that right so the affection refrain  the lust and the thirst of the sensuality, and make her to be  underlout to God, and so to bear some fruit in helping of her  feeling.
