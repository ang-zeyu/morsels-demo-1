[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6312"],[0,"Representative Men: Seven Lectures (#4)"],[1,"    Thus we feed on genius, and refresh ourselves from too much conversation  with our mates, and exult in the depth of nature in that direction in  which he leads us. What indemnification is one great man for populations  of pigmies! Every mother wishes one son a genius, though all the rest  should be mediocre. But a new danger appears in the excess of influence  of the great man. His attractions warp us from our place. We have  become underlings and intellectual suicides. Ah! yonder in the horizon  is our help:--other great men, new qualities, counterweights and  checks on each other. We cloy of the honey of each peculiar greatness.  Every hero becomes a bore at last. Perhaps Voltaire was not bad-hearted,  yet he said of the good Jesus, even, \"I pray you, let me never hear  that man's name again.\" They cry up the virtues of George  Washington,--\"Damn George Washington!\" is the poor Jacobin's whole  speech and confutation. But it is human nature's indispensable defense.  The centripetence augments the centrifugence. We balance one man with  his opposite, and the health of the state depends on the see-saw.    There is, however, a speedy limit to the use of heroes. Every genius  is defended from approach by quantities of availableness. They are  very attractive, and seem at a distance our own: but we are hindered  on all sides from approach. The more we are drawn, the more we are  repelled. There is something not solid in the good that is done for  us. The best discovery the discoverer makes for himself. It has  something unreal for his companion, until he too has substantiated it.  It seems as if the Deity dressed each soul which he sends into nature  in certain virtues and powers not communicable to other men, and,  sending it to perform one more turn through the circle of beings, wrote  \"Not transferable,\" and \"Good for this trip only,\" on these garments  of the soul. There is somewhat deceptive about the intercourse of  minds. The boundaries are invisible, but they are never crossed. There  is such good will to impart, and such good will to receive, that each  threatens to become the other; but the law of individuality collects  its secret strength: you are you, and I am I, and so we remain.    For Nature wishes every thing to remain itself; and, whilst every  individual strives to grow and exclude, and to exclude and grow, to  the extremities of the universe, and to impose the law of its being  on every other creature, Nature steadily aims to protect each against  every other. Each is self-defended. Nothing is more marked than the  power by which individuals are guarded from individuals, in a world  where every benefactor becomes so easily a malefactor, only by  continuation of his activity into places where it is not due; where  children seem so much at the mercy of their foolish parents, and where  almost all men are too social and interfering. We rightly speak of the  guardian angels of children. How superior in their security from  infusions of evil persons, from vulgarity and second thought! They  shed their own abundant beauty on the objects they behold. Therefore,  they are not at the mercy of such poor educators as we adults. If we  huff and chide them, they soon come not to mind it, and get a  self-reliance; and if we indulge them to folly, they learn the  limitation elsewhere.    We need not fear excessive influence. A more generous trust is  permitted. Serve the great. Stick at no humiliation. Grudge no office  thou canst render. Be the limb of their body, the breath of their  mouth. Compromise thy egotism. Who cares for that, so thou gain aught  wider and nobler? Never mind the taunt of Boswellism: the devotion may  easily be greater than the wretched pride which is guarding its own  skirts. Be another: not thyself, but a Platonist; not a soul, but a  Christian; not a naturalist, but a Cartesian; not a poet, but a  Shakspearian. In vain, the wheels of tendency will not stop, nor will  all the forces of inertia, fear, or love itself, hold thee there. On,  and forever onward! The microscope observes a monad or wheel-insect  among the infusories circulating in water. Presently, a dot appears  on the animal, which enlarges to a slit, and it becomes two perfect  animals. The ever-proceeding detachment appears not less in all thought,  and in society. Children think they cannot live without their parents.  But, long before they are aware of it, the black dot has appeared, and  the detachment taken place. Any accident will now reveal to them their  independence.    But great men:--the word is injurious. Is there caste? is there fate?  What becomes of the promise to virtue? The thoughtful youth laments  the superfoetation of nature. \"Generous and handsome,\" he says, \"is  your hero; but look at yonder poor Paddy, whose country is his  wheelbarrow; look at his whole nation of Paddies.\" Why are the masses,  from the dawn of history down, food for knives and powder? The idea  dignifies a few leaders, who have sentiment, opinion, love,  self-devotion; and they make war and death sacred;--but what for the  wretches whom they hire and kill? The cheapness of man is every day's  tragedy. It is as real a loss that others should be low, as that we  should be low; for we must have society.    Is it a reply to these suggestions, to say, society is a Pestalozzian  school; all are teachers and pupils in turn. We are equally served by  receiving and by imparting. Men who know the same things, are not long  the best company for each other. But bring to each an intelligent  person of another experience, and it is as if you let off water from  a lake, by cutting a lower basin. It seems a mechanical advantage, and  great benefit it is to each speaker, as he can now paint out his thought  to himself. We pass very fast, in our personal moods, from dignity to  dependence. And if any appear never to assume the chair, but always  to stand and serve, it is because we do not see the company in a  sufficiently long period for the whole rotation of parts to come about.  As to what we call the masses, and common men;--there are no common  men. All men are at last of a size; and true art is only possible, on  the conviction that every talent has its apotheosis somewhere. Fair  play, and an open field, and freshest laurels to all who have won them!  But heaven reserves an equal scope for every creature. Each is uneasy  until he has produced his private ray unto the concave sphere, and  beheld his talent also in its last nobility and exaltation.    The heroes of the hour are relatively great: of a faster growth; or  they are such, in whom, at the moment of success, a quality is ripe  which is then in request. Other days will demand other qualities. Some  rays escape the common observer, and want a finely adapted eye. Ask  the great man if there be none greater. His companions are; and not  the less great, but the more, that society cannot see them. Nature  never sends a great man into the planet, without confiding the secret  to another soul.    One gracious fact emerges from these studies,--that there is true  ascension in our love. The reputations of the nineteenth century will  one day be quoted to prove its barbarism. The genius of humanity is  the real subject whose biography is written in our annals. We must  infer much, and supply many chasms in the record. The history of the  universe is symptomatic, and life is mnemonical. No man, in all the  procession of famous men, is reason or illumination, or that essence  we were looking for; but is an exhibition, in some quarter, of new  possibilities. Could we one day complete the immense figure which these  flagrant points compose! The study of many individuals leads us to an  elemental region wherein the individual is lost, or wherein all touch  by their summits. Thought and feeling, that break out there, cannot  be impounded by any fence of personality. This is the key to the power  of the greatest men,--their spirit diffuses itself. A new quality of  mind travels by night and by day, in concentric circles from its origin,  and publishes itself by unknown methods: the union of all minds appears  intimate: what gets admission to one, cannot be kept out of any other:  the smallest acquisition of truth or of energy, in any quarter, is so  much good to the commonwealth of souls. If the disparities of talent  and position vanish, when the individuals are seen in the duration  which is necessary to complete the career of each; even more swiftly  the seeming injustice disappears, when we ascend to the central identity  of all the individuals, and know that they are made of the same  substance which ordaineth and doeth.    The genius of humanity is the right point of view of history. The  qualities abide; the men who exhibit them have now more, now less, and  pass away; the qualities remain on another brow. No experience is more  familiar. Once you saw phoenixes: they are gone; the world is not  therefore disenchanted. The vessels on which you read sacred emblems  turn out to be common pottery; but the sense of the pictures is sacred,  and you may still read them transferred to the walls of the world. For  a time, our teachers serve us personally, as metres or milestones of  progress. Once they were angels of knowledge, and their figures touched  the sky. Then we drew near, saw their means, culture, and limits; and  they yielded their places to other geniuses. Happy, if a few names  remain so high, that we have not been able to read them nearer, and  age and comparison have not robbed them of a ray. But, at last, we  shall cease to look in men for completeness, and shall content ourselves  with their social and delegated quality. All that respects the  individual is temporary and prospective, like the individual himself,  who is ascending out of his limits, into a catholic existence.

Indeed, for the former office my razeed dory gained such a reputation  on the voyage that my washerwoman at Samoa would not take no for an  answer. She could see with one eye that it was a new invention which  beat any Yankee notion ever brought by missionaries to the islands,  and she had to have it.    The want of a chronometer for the voyage was all that now worried me.  In our newfangled notions of navigation it is supposed that a mariner  cannot find his way without one; and I had myself drifted into this  way of thinking. My old chronometer, a good one, had been long in  disuse. It would cost fifteen dollars to clean and rate it. Fifteen  dollars! For sufficient reasons I left that timepiece at home, where  the Dutchman left his anchor. I had the great lantern, and a lady in  Boston sent me the price of a large two-burner cabin lamp, which  lighted the cabin at night, and by some small contriving served for a  stove through the day.    Being thus refitted I was once more ready for sea, and on May 7 again  made sail. With little room in which to turn, the _Spray_, in  gathering headway, scratched the paint off an old, fine-weather craft  in the fairway, being puttied and painted for a summer voyage. \"Who'll  pay for that?\" growled the painters. \"I will,\" said I. \"With the  main-sheet,\" echoed the captain of the _Bluebird_, close by, which was  his way of saying that I was off. There was nothing to pay for above  five cents' worth of paint, maybe, but such a din was raised between  the old \"hooker\" and the _Bluebird_, which now took up my case, that  the first cause of it was forgotten altogether. Anyhow, no bill was  sent after me.    The weather was mild on the day of my departure from Gloucester. On  the point ahead, as the _Spray_ stood out of the cove, was a lively  picture, for the front of a tall factory was a flutter of  handkerchiefs and caps. Pretty faces peered out of the windows from  the top to the bottom of the building, all smiling _bon voyage_. Some  hailed me to know where away and why alone. Why? When I made as if to  stand in, a hundred pairs of arms reached out, and said come, but the  shore was dangerous! The sloop worked out of the bay against a light  southwest wind, and about noon squared away off Eastern Point,  receiving at the same time a hearty salute--the last of many  kindnesses to her at Gloucester. The wind freshened off the point, and  skipping along smoothly, the _Spray_ was soon off Thatcher's Island  lights. Thence shaping her course east, by compass, to go north of  Cashes Ledge and the Amen Rocks, I sat and considered the matter all  over again, and asked myself once more whether it were best to sail  beyond the ledge and rocks at all. I had only said that I would sail  round the world in the _Spray_, \"dangers of the sea excepted,\" but I  must have said it very much in earnest. The \"charter-party\" with  myself seemed to bind me, and so I sailed on. Toward night I hauled  the sloop to the wind, and baiting a hook, sounded for bottom-fish, in  thirty fathoms of water, on the edge of Cashes Ledge. With fair  success I hauled till dark, landing on deck three cod and two  haddocks, one hake, and, best of all, a small halibut, all plump and  spry. This, I thought, would be the place to take in a good stock of  provisions above what I already had; so I put out a sea-anchor that  would hold her head to windward. The current being southwest, against  the wind, I felt quite sure I would find the _Spray_ still on the bank  or near it in the morning. Then \"stradding\" the cable and putting my  great lantern in the rigging, I lay down, for the first time at sea  alone, not to sleep, but to doze and to dream.    I had read somewhere of a fishing-schooner hooking her anchor into a  whale, and being towed a long way and at great speed. This was exactly  what happened to the _Spray_--in my dream! I could not shake it off  entirely when I awoke and found that it was the wind blowing and the  heavy sea now running that had disturbed my short rest. A scud was  flying across the moon. A storm was brewing; indeed, it was already  stormy. I reefed the sails, then hauled in my sea-anchor, and setting  what canvas the sloop could carry, headed her away for Monhegan light,  which she made before daylight on the morning of the 8th. The wind  being free, I ran on into Round Pond harbor, which is a little port  east from Pemaquid. Here I rested a day, while the wind rattled among  the pine-trees on shore. But the following day was fine enough, and I  put to sea, first writing up my log from Cape Ann, not omitting a full  account of my adventure with the whale.    [Illustration: \"'No dorg nor no cat.'\"]    The _Spray_, heading east, stretched along the coast among many  islands and over a tranquil sea. At evening of this day, May 10, she  came up with a considerable island, which I shall always think of as  the Island of Frogs, for the _Spray_ was charmed by a million voices.  From the Island of Frogs we made for the Island of Birds, called  Gannet Island, and sometimes Gannet Rock, whereon is a bright,  intermittent light, which flashed fitfully across the _Spray's_ deck  as she coasted along under its light and shade. Thence shaping a  course for Briar's Island, I came among vessels the following  afternoon on the western fishing-grounds, and after speaking a  fisherman at anchor, who gave me a wrong course, the _Spray_ sailed  directly over the southwest ledge through the worst tide-race in the  Bay of Fundy, and got into Westport harbor in Nova Scotia, where I had  spent eight years of my life as a lad.    The fisherman may have said \"east-southeast,\" the course I was  steering when I hailed him; but I thought he said \"east-northeast,\"  and I accordingly changed it to that. Before he made up his mind to  answer me at all, he improved the occasion of his own curiosity to  know where I was from, and if I was alone, and if I didn't have \"no  dorg nor no cat.\" It was the first time in all my life at sea that I  had heard a hail for information answered by a question. I think the  chap belonged to the Foreign Islands. There was one thing I was sure  of, and that was that he did not belong to Briar's Island, because he  dodged a sea that slopped over the rail, and stopping to brush the  water from his face, lost a fine cod which he was about to ship. My  islander would not have done that. It is known that a Briar Islander,  fish or no fish on his hook, never flinches from a sea. He just tends  to his lines and hauls or \"saws.\" Nay, have I not seen my old friend  Deacon W. D---, a good man of the island, while listening to a sermon  in the little church on the hill, reach out his hand over the door of  his pew and \"jig\" imaginary squid in the aisle, to the intense delight  of the young people, who did not realize that to catch good fish one  must have good bait, the thing most on the deacon's mind.    [Illustration: The deacon's dream.]    I was delighted to reach Westport. Any port at all would have been  delightful after the terrible thrashing I got in the fierce sou'west  rip, and to find myself among old schoolmates now was charming. It was  the 13th of the month, and 13 is my lucky number--a fact registered  long before Dr. Nansen sailed in search of the north pole with his  crew of thirteen. Perhaps he had heard of my success in taking a most  extraordinary ship successfully to Brazil with that number of crew.  The very stones on Briar's Island I was glad to see again, and I knew  them all. The little shop round the corner, which for thirty-five  years I had not seen, was the same, except that it looked a deal  smaller. It wore the same shingles--I was sure of it; for did not I  know the roof where we boys, night after night, hunted for the skin of  a black cat, to be taken on a dark night, to make a plaster for a poor  lame man? Lowry the tailor lived there when boys were boys. In his day  he was fond of the gun. He always carried his powder loose in the tail  pocket of his coat. He usually had in his mouth a short dudeen; but in  an evil moment he put the dudeen, lighted, in the pocket among the  powder. Mr. Lowry was an eccentric man.    At Briar's Island I overhauled the _Spray_ once more and tried her  seams, but found that even the test of the sou'west rip had started  nothing. Bad weather and much head wind prevailing outside, I was in  no hurry to round Cape Sable. I made a short excursion with some  friends to St. Mary's Bay, an old cruising-ground, and back to the  island. Then I sailed, putting into Yarmouth the following day on  account of fog and head wind. I spent some days pleasantly enough in  Yarmouth, took in some butter for the voyage, also a barrel of  potatoes, filled six barrels of water, and stowed all under deck. At  Yarmouth, too, I got my famous tin clock, the only timepiece I carried  on the whole voyage. The price of it was a dollar and a half, but on  account of the face being smashed the merchant let me have it for a  dollar.

I now stowed all my goods securely, for the boisterous Atlantic was  before me, and I sent the topmast down, knowing that the _Spray_ would  be the wholesomer with it on deck. Then I gave the lanyards a pull and  hitched them afresh, and saw that the gammon was secure, also that the  boat was lashed, for even in summer one may meet with bad weather in  the crossing.    In fact, many weeks of bad weather had prevailed. On July 1, however,  after a rude gale, the wind came out nor'west and clear,"]]]
