The first of these rules is, To avoid  compulsion; which, though it be not in our power to employ at present, I hope  will not be made use of when it is.  The second is, To avoid teaching  doctrines against common sense; the Mohammedans not being such fools (whatever  we may think of them) as to be gained over in this case.  The worshipping of  images and the doctrine of transubstantiation are great stumbling-blocks to  the Mohammedans, and the Church which teacheth them is very unfit to bring  those people over.  The third is, To avoid weak arguments: for the Mohammedans  are not to be converted with these, or hard words.  We must use them with  humanity, and dispute against them with arguments that are proper and cogent.  It is certain that many Christians, who have written against them, have been  very defective this way: many have used arguments that have no force, and  advanced propositions that are void of truth.  This method is so far from  convincing, that it rather serves to harden them.  The Mohammedans will be apt  to conclude we have little to say, when we urge them with arguments that are  trifling or untrue.  We do but lose ground when we do this; and instead of  gaining them, we expose ourselves and our cause also.  We must not give them  ill words neither; but must avoid all reproachful language, all that is  sarcastical and biting: this never did good from pulpit or press.  The softest  words will make the deepest impression; and if we think it a fault in them to  give ill language, we cannot be excused when we imitate them.  The fourth rule  is, Not to quit any article of the Christian faith to gain the Mohammedans.  It is a fond conceit of the Socinians, that we shall upon their principles be  most like to prevail upon the Mohammedans: it is not true in matter of fact.  We must not give up any article to gain them: but then the Church of Rome  ought to part with many practices and some doctrines.  We are not to design to  gain the Mohammedans over to a system of dogma, but to the ancient and  primitive faith.  I believe nobody will deny but that the rules here laid down  are just: the latter part of the third, which alone my design has given me  occasion to practise, I think so reasonable, that I have not, in speaking of  Mohammed or his Korân, allowed myself to use those opprobrious appellations,  and unmannerly expressions, which seem to be the strongest arguments of  several who have written against them.  On the contrary, I have thought myself  to treat both with common decency, and even to approve such        *  In his Demonstr. of the Messias, Part III. chap. 2.        particulars as seemed to me to deserve approbation: for how criminal soever  Mohammed may have been in imposing a false religion on mankind, the praises  due to his real virtues ought not to be denied him; nor can I do otherwise  than applaud the candour of the pious and learned Spanhemius, who, though he  owned him to have been a wicked impostor, yet acknowledged him to have been  richly furnished with natural endowments, beautiful in his person, of a subtle  wit, agreeable behaviour, showing liberality to the poor, courtesy to every  one, fortitude against his enemies, and above all a high reverence for the  name of GOD; severe against the perjured, adulterers, murderers, slanderers,  prodigals, covetous, false witnesses, &c., a great preacher of patience,  charity, mercy, beneficence, gratitude, honouring of parents and superiors,  and a frequent celebrator of the divine praises.*   Of the several translations of the Korân now extant, there is but one  which tolerably represents the sense of the original; and that being in Latin,  a new version became necessary, at least to an English reader.  What  Bibliander published for a Latin translation of that book deserves not the  name of a translation; the unaccountable liberties therein taken and the  numberless faults, both of omission and commission, leaving scarce any  resemblance of the original.  It was made near six hundred years ago, being  finished in 1143, by Robertus Retenensis, an English-man, with the assistance  of Hermannus Dalmata, at the request of Peter, Abbot of Clugny, who paid them  well for their pains.   From this Latin version was taken the Italian of Andrea Arrivabene,  notwithstanding the pretences in his dedication of its being done immediately  from the Arabic;? wherefore it is no wonder if the transcript be yet more  faulty and absurd than the copy.?   About the end of the fifteenth century, Johannes Andreas, a native of  Xativa in the kingdom of Valencia, who from a Mohammedan doctor became a  Christian priest, translated not only the Korân, but also its glosses, and the  seven books of the Sonna, out of Arabic into the Arragonian tongue, at the  command of Martin Garcia,§ Bishop of Barcelona and Inquisitor of Arragon.  Whether this translation were ever published or not I am wholly ignorant: but  it may be presumed to have been the better done for being the work of one bred  up in the     *  Id certum, naturalibus egregiè dotibus instructum Muhammedera, forma  præstanti, ingenio calido, moribus facetis, ac præ se ferentem liberalitatem  in egenos. comitatem in singulos, fortitudinem in hostes, ac præ cæteris  reverentiam divini nominis.-Severus fuit in perjuros, adulteros, homicidas,  obtrectatores, prodigos, avaros, falsos testes, &c.

Mohammedan religion and learning; though his refutation of that religion,  which has had several editions, gives no great idea of his abilities.   Some years within the last century, Andrew du Ryer, who had been consul  of the French nation in Egypt, and was tolerably skilled in the Turkish and  Arabic languages, took the pains to translate the Korân into his own tongue:  but his performance, though it be beyond comparison preferable to that of  Retenensis, is far from being a just translation; there being mistakes in  every page, besides frequent transpositions, omissions, and additions,* faults  unpardonable in a work of this nature.  And what renders it still more  incomplete is, the want of Notes to explain a vast number of passages, some of  which are difficult, and others impossible to be understood, without proper  explications, were they translated ever so exactly; which the author is so  sensible of that he often refers his reader to the Arabic commentators.   The English version is no other than a translation of Du Ryer's, and  that a very bad one; for Alexander Ross, who did it, being utterly  unacquainted with the Arabic, and no great master of the French, has added a  number of fresh mistakes of his own to those of Du Ryer; not to mention the  meanness of his language, which would make a better book ridiculous.   In 1698, a Latin translation of the Korân, made by Father Lewis  Marracci, who had been confessor to Pope Innocent XI., was published at Padua,  together with the original text, accompanied by explanatory notes and a  refutation.  This translation of Marracci's, generally speaking, is very  exact; but adheres to the Arabic idiom too literally to be easily understood,  unless I am much deceived, by those who are not versed in the Mohammedan  learning.  The notes he has added are indeed of great use; but his  refutations, which swell the work to a large volume, are of little or none at  all, being often unsatisfactory, and sometimes impertinent.  The work,  however, with all its faults, is very valuable, and I should be guilty of  ingratitude, did I not acknowledge myself much obliged thereto; but still,  being in Latin, it can be of no use to those who understand not that tongue.   Having therefore undertaken a new translation, I have endeavoured to do  the original impartial justice; not having, to the best of my knowledge,  represented it, in any one instance, either better or worse than it really is.  I have thought myself obliged, indeed, in a piece which pretends to be the  Word of GOD, to keep somewhat scrupulously close to the text; by which means  the language may, in some places, seem to express the Arabic a little too  literally to be elegant English: but this, I hope, has not happened often; and  I flatter myself that the    *  Vide Windet. de Vitâ Functorum statu, Sect. IX.        style I have made use of will not only give a more genuine idea of the  original than if I had taken more liberty (which would have been much more for  my ease), but will soon become familiar: for we must not expect to read a  version of so extraordinary a book with the same ease and pleasure as a modern  composition.   In the Notes my view has been briefly to explain the text, and  especially the difficult and obscure passages, from the most approved  commentators, and that generally in their own words, for whose opinions or  expressions, where liable to censure, I am not answerable; my province being  only fairly to represent their expositions, and the little I have added of my  own, or from European writers,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7446"],[0,"The Naturalist in La Plata (#4)"],[1,"body,  admirably adapted for pushing through the thick grass and rushes; for it  is both terrestrial and aquatic, therefore well suited to inhabit low,  level plains liable to be flooded. On dry land its habits are similar to  those of a weasel; in lagoons, where it dives and swims with great ease,  it constructs a globular nest suspended from the rushes. The fur is  soft, of a rich yellow, reddish above, and on the sides and under  surfaces varying in some parts to orange, in others exhibiting beautiful  copper and terra-cotta tints. These lovely tints and the metallic lustre  soon fade from the fur, otherwise this animal would be much sought after  in the interests of those who love to decorate themselves with the  spoils of beautiful dead animals--beast and bird. The other opossum is  the black and white Didelphys azarae; and it is indeed strange to find  this animal on the pampas, although its presence there is not so  mysterious as that of the tuco-tuco. It shuffles along slowly and  awkwardly on the ground, but is a great traveller nevertheless. Tschudi  met it mountaineering on the Andes at an enormous altitude, and, true to  its lawless nature, it confronted me in Patagonia, where the books say  no marsupial dwells. In every way it is adapted to an arboreal life, yet  it is everywhere found on the level country, far removed from the  conditions which one would imagine to be necessary to its existence. For  how many thousands of years has this marsupial been a dweller on the  plain, all its best faculties unexercised, its beautiful grasping hands  pressed to the ground, and its prehensile tail dragged like an idle rope  behind it! Yet, if one is brought to a tree, it will take to it as  readily as a duck to water, or an armadillo to earth, climbing up the  trunk and about the branches with a monkey-like agility. How reluctant  Nature seems in some cases to undo her own work! How long she will  allow a specialized organ, with the correlated instinct, to rest without  use, yet ready to flash forth on the instant, bright and keen-edged, as  in the ancient days of strife, ages past, before peace came to dwell on  earth!    The avi-fauna is relatively much richer than the mammalia, owing to the  large number of aquatic species, most of which are migratory with their  \"breeding\" or \"subsistence-areas\" on the pampas. In more senses than one  they constitute a \"floating population,\" and their habits have in no way  been modified by the conditions of the country. The order, including  storks, ibises, herons, spoonbills, and flamingoes, counts about  eighteen species; and the most noteworthy birds in it are two great  ibises nearly as large as turkeys, with mighty resonant voices. The duck  order is very rich, numbering at least twenty species, including two  beautiful upland geese, winter visitors from Magellanic lands, and two  swans, the lovely black-necked, and the pure white with rosy bill. Of  rails, or ralline birds, there are ten or twelve, ranging from a small  spotted creature no bigger than a thrush to some large majestic birds.  One is the courlan, called \"crazy widow\" from its mourning plumage and  long melancholy screams, which on still evenings may be heard a league  away. Another is the graceful variegated _ypicaha,_ fond of social  gatherings, where the birds perform a dance and make the desolate  marshes resound with their insane humanlike voices. A smaller kind,  Porphyriops melanops, has a night-cry like a burst of shrill hysterical  laughter, which has won for it the name of \"witch;\" while another,  Rallus rythyrhynchus, is called \"little donkey\" from its braying cries.  Strange eerie voices have all these birds. Of the remaining aquatic  species, the most important is the spur-winged crested screamer; a noble  bird as large as a swan, yet its favourite pastime is to soar upwards  until it loses itself to sight in the blue ether, whenca it pours forth  its resounding choral notes, which reach the distant earth clarified,  and with a rhythmic swell and fall as of chiming bells. It also sings by  night, \"counting the hours,\" the gauchos say, and where they have  congregated together in tens of thousands the mighty roar of their  combined voices produces an astonishingly grand effect.    The largest aquatic order is that of the Limicolse--snipes, plover, and  their allies--which has about twenty-five species. The vociferous  spur-winged lapwing; the beautiful black and white stilt; a true snipe,  and a painted snipe, are, strictly speaking, the only residents; and it  is astonishing to find, that, of the five-and-twenty species, at least  thirteen are visitors from North America, several of them having their  breeding-places quite away in the Arctic regions. This is one of those  facts concerning the annual migration of birds which almost stagger  belief; for among them are species with widely different habits, upland,  marsh and sea-shore birds, and in their great biannual journey they pass  through a variety of climates, visiting many countries where the  conditions seem suited to their requirements. Nevertheless, in  September, and even as early as August, they begin to arrive on the  pampas, the golden plover often still wearing his black nuptial dress;  singly and in pairs, in small flocks, and in clouds they come--curlew,  godwit, plover, tatler, tringa--piping the wild notes to which the  Greenlander listened in June, now to the gaucho herdsman on the green  plains of La Plata, then to the wild Indian in his remote village; and  soon, further south, to the houseless huanaco-hunter in the grey  wilderness of Patagonia.    Here is a puzzle for ornithologists. In summer on the pampas we have a  godwit--Limosa hudsonica; in March it goes north to breed; later in the  season flocks of the same species arrive from the south to winter on the  pampas. And besides this godwit, there are several other North American  species, which have colonies in the southern hemi-spere, with a reversed  migration and breeding season. Why do these southern birds winter so far  south? Do they really breed in Patagonia? If so, their migration is an  extremely limited one compared with that of the northern birds--seven or  eight hundred miles, on the outside, in one case, against almost as many  thousands of miles in the other. Considering that some species which  migrate as far south as Patagonia breed in the Arctic regions as far  north as latitude 82 degrees, and probably higher still, it would be  strange indeed if none of the birds which winter in Patagonia and on the  pampas were summer visitors to that great austral continent, which has  an estimated area twice as large as that of Europe, and a climate milder  than the arctic one. The migrants would have about six hundred miles of  sea to cross from Tierra del Fuego; but we know that the golden plover  and other species, which sometimes touch at the Bermudas when  travelling, fly much further than that without resting. The fact that a  common Argentine titlark, a non-migrant and a weak flyer, has been met  with at the South Shetland Islands, close to the antarctic continent,  shows that the journey may be easily accomplished by birds with strong  flight; and that even the winter climate of that unknown land is not too  severe to allow an accidental colonist, like this small delicate bird,  to survive. The godwit, already mentioned, has been observed in flocks  at the Falkland Islands in May, that is, three months after the same  species had taken its autumal departure from the neighbouring mainland.  Can it be believed that these late visitors to the Falklands were  breeders in Patagonia, and had migrated east to winter in so bleak a  region? It is far more probable that they came from the south. Officers  of sailing ships beating round Cape Horn might be able to settle this  question definitely by looking out, and listening at night, for flights  of birds, travelling north from about the first week in January to the  end of February; and in September and October travelling south. Probably  not fewer than a dozen species of the plover order are breeders on the  great austral continent; also other aquatic birds--ducks and geese; and  many Passerine birds, chiefly of the Tyrant family.    Should the long projected Australasian expedition to the South Polar  regions ever be carried to a successful issue, there will probably be  important results for ornithology, in spite of the astounding theory  which has found a recent advocate in Canon Tristram, that all life  originated at the North Pole, whence it spread over the globe, but never  succeeded in crossing the deep sea surrounding the antarctic continent,  which has consequently remained till now desolate, \"a giant ash (and  ice) of death.\" Nor is it unlikely that animals of a higher class than  birds exist there; and the discovery of new mammalians, differing in  type from those we know, would certainly be glad tidings to most  students of nature.    Land birds on the pampas are few in species and in numbers. This may be  accounted for by the absence of trees and other elevations on which  birds prefer to roost and nest; and by the scarcity of food. Insects are  few in dry situations; and the large perennial grasses, which occupy  most of the ground, yield a miserable yearly harvest of a few minute  seeds; so that this district is a poor one both for soft and hard billed  birds. Hawks of several genera, in moderate numbers, are there, but  generally keep to the marshes. Eagles and vultures are somewhat  unworthily represented by carrion-hawks (Polyborinae); the lordly  carancho, almost eagle-like in size, black and crested, with a very  large, pale blue, hooked beak--his battle axe: and his humble follower  and jackal, the brown and harrier-like chimango. These nest on the  ground, are versatile in their habits, carrion-eaters, also killers on  their own account, and, like wild dogs, sometimes hunt in"]]]
