'Do you know, I'm not frightfully keen on the name Smith. Wouldn't  something else do?'    'Sure. We aim to please. How would Jones suit you?'    'The trouble is, you know, that if I took a name I wasn't used to  I might forget it.'    'If you've the sort of mind that would forget Jones I doubt if  ever you'll be a captain of industry.'    'Why not Chalmers?'    'You think it easier to memorize than Jones?'    'It used to be my name, you see, before I got the title.'    'I see. All right. Chalmers then. When do you think of starting?'    'To-morrow.'    'You aren't losing much time. By the way, as you're going to New  York you might as well use my flat.'    'It's awfully good of you.'    'Not a bit. You would be doing me a favour. I had to leave at a  moment's notice, and I want to know what's been happening to the  place. I left some Japanese prints there, and my favourite  nightmare is that someone has broken in and sneaked them. Write  down the address--Forty-three East Twenty-seventh Street. I'll  send you the key to Brown's to-night with those letters.'    Bill walked up the Strand, glowing with energy. He made his way to  Cockspur Street to buy his ticket for New York. This done, he set  out to Brown's to arrange with the committee the details of his  departure.    He reached Brown's at twenty minutes past two and left it again at  twenty-three minutes past; for, directly he entered, the hall  porter had handed him a telephone message. The telephone  attendants at London clubs are masters of suggestive brevity. The  one in the basement of Brown's had written on Bill's slip of paper  the words: '1 p.m. Will Lord Dawlish as soon as possible call upon  Mr Gerald Nichols at his office?' To this was appended a message  consisting of two words: 'Good news.'    It was stimulating. The probability was that all Jerry Nichols  wanted to tell him was that he had received stable information  about some horse or had been given a box for the Empire, but for  all that it was stimulating.    Bill looked at his watch. He could spare half an hour. He set out  at once for the offices of the eminent law firm of Nichols,  Nichols, Nichols, and Nichols, of which aggregation of Nicholses  his friend Jerry was the last and smallest.          3      On a west-bound omnibus Claire Fenwick sat and raged silently in the  June sunshine. She was furious. What right had Lord Dawlish to look  down his nose and murmur '_Noblesse oblige_' when she asked him a  question, as if she had suggested that he should commit some crime?  It was the patronizing way he had said it that infuriated her, as if  he were a superior being of some kind, governed by codes which she  could not be expected to understand. Everybody nowadays did the sort  of things she suggested, so what was the good of looking shocked and  saying '_Noblesse oblige_'?    The omnibus rolled on towards West Kensington. Claire hated the  place with the bitter hate of one who had read society novels, and  yearned for Grosvenor Square and butlers and a general atmosphere  of soft cushions and pink-shaded lights and maids to do one's  hair. She hated the cheap furniture of the little parlour, the  penetrating contralto of the cook singing hymns in the kitchen,  and the ubiquitousness of her small brother. He was only ten, and  small for his age, yet he appeared to have the power of being in  two rooms at the same time while making a nerve-racking noise in  another.    It was Percy who greeted her to-day as she entered the flat.    'Halloa, Claire! I say, Claire, there's a letter for you. It came  by the second post. I say, Claire, it's got an American stamp on  it. Can I have it, Claire? I haven't got one in my collection.'    His sister regarded him broodingly. 'For goodness' sake don't  bellow like that!' she said. 'Of course, you can have the stamp. I  don't want it. Where is the letter?'    Claire took the envelope from him, extracted the letter, and  handed back the envelope. Percy vanished into the dining-room with  a shattering squeal of pleasure.    A voice spoke from behind a half-opened door--    'Is that you, Claire?'    'Yes, mother; I've come back to pack. They want me to go to  Southampton to-night to take up Claudia Winslow's part.'    'What train are you catching?'    'The three-fifteen.'    'You will have to hurry.'    'I'm going to hurry,' said Claire, clenching her fists as two  simultaneous bursts of song, in different keys and varying tempos,  proceeded from the dining-room and kitchen. A girl has to be in a  sunnier mood than she was to bear up without wincing under the  infliction of a duet consisting of the Rock of Ages and Waiting  for the Robert E. Lee. Assuredly Claire proposed to hurry. She  meant to get her packing done in record time and escape from this  place. She went into her bedroom and began to throw things  untidily into her trunk. She had put the letter in her pocket  against a more favourable time for perusal. A glance had told her  that it was from her friend Polly, Countess of Wetherby: that  Polly Davis of whom she had spoken to Lord Dawlish. Polly Davis,  now married for better or for worse to that curious invertebrate  person, Algie Wetherby, was the only real friend Claire had made  on the stage. A sort of shivering gentility had kept her aloof  from the rest of her fellow-workers, but it took more than a  shivering gentility to stave off Polly.    Claire had passed through the various stages of intimacy with her,  until on the occasion of Polly's marriage she had acted as her  bridesmaid.    It was a long letter, too long to be read until she was at  leisure, and written in a straggling hand that made reading  difficult. She was mildly surprised that Polly should have written  her, for she had been back in America a year or more now, and this  was her first letter. Polly had a warm heart and did not forget  her friends, but she was not a good correspondent.    The need of getting her things ready at once drove the letter from  Claire's mind. She was in the train on her way to Southampton  before she remembered its existence.    It was dated from New York.    MY DEAR OLD CLAIRE,--Is this really my first letter to you? Isn't  that awful! Gee! A lot's happened since I saw you last. I must  tell you first about my hit. Some hit! Claire, old girl, I own New  York. I daren't tell you what my salary is. You'd faint.    I'm doing barefoot dancing. You know the sort of stuff. I started  it in vaudeville, and went so big that my agent shifted me to the  restaurants, and they have to call out the police reserves to  handle the crowd. You can't get a table at Reigelheimer's, which  is my pitch, unless you tip the head waiter a small fortune and  promise to mail him your clothes when you get home. I dance during  supper with nothing on my feet and not much anywhere else, and it  takes three vans to carry my salary to the bank.    Of course, it's the title that does it: 'Lady Pauline Wetherby!'  Algie says it oughtn't to be that, because I'm not the daughter of  a duke, but I don't worry about that. It looks good, and that's  all that matters. You can't get away from the title. I was born in  Carbondale, Illinois, but that doesn't matter--I'm an English  countess, doing barefoot dancing to work off the mortgage on the  ancestral castle, and they eat me. Take it from me, Claire, I'm a  riot.    Well, that's that. What I am really writing about is to tell you  that you have got to come over here. I've taken a house at  Brookport, on Long Island, for the summer. You can stay with me  till the fall, and then I can easily get you a good job in New  York. I have some pull these days, believe me. Not that you'll  need my help. The managers have only got to see you and they'll  all want you. I showed one of them that photograph you gave me,  and he went up in the air. They pay twice as big salaries over  here, you know, as in England, so come by the next boat.    Claire, darling, you must come. I'm wretched. Algie has got my  goat the worst way. If you don't know what that means it means  that he's behaving like a perfect pig. I hardly know where to  begin. Well, it was this way: directly I made my hit my press  agent, a real bright man named Sherriff, got busy, of course.  Interviews, you know, and Advice to Young Girls in the evening  papers, and How I Preserve My Beauty, and all that sort of thing.  Well, one thing he made me do was to buy a snake and a monkey.  Roscoe Sherriff is crazy about animals as aids to advertisement.  He says an animal story is the thing he does best. So I bought  them.    Algie kicked from the first. I ought to tell you that since we  left England he has taken up painting footling little pictures,  and has got the artistic temperament badly. All his life he's been  starting some new fool thing. When I first met him he prided  himself on having the finest collection of photographs of  race-horses in England. Then he got a craze for model engines.  After that he used to work the piano player till I nearly went  crazy. And now it's pictures.    I don't mind his painting. It gives him something to do and keeps  him out of mischief. He has a studio down in Washington Square,  and is perfectly happy messing about there all day.    Everything would be fine if he didn't think it necessary to tack  on the artistic temperament to his painting. He's developed the  idea that he has nerves and everything upsets them.    Things came to a head this morning at breakfast. Clarence, my  snake, has the cutest way of climbing up the leg of the table and  looking at you pleadingly in the hope that you will give him  soft-boiled egg, which he adores. He did it this morning, and no  sooner had his head appeared above the table than Algie, with a kind  of sharp wail, struck him a violent blow on the nose with a teaspoon.  Then he turned to me, very "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6687"],[0,"From the Caves and Jungles of Hindostan (#4)"],[1," Chunder Sen, having founded the community of \"Brahmo-Samaj,\"  which professes a religion extracted from the depths of the Babu's own  imagination, became a mystic of the most pronounced type, and now  is only \"a berry from the same field,\" as we say in Russia, as the  Spiritualists, by whom he is considered to be a medium and a Calcutta  Swedenborg. He spends his time in a dirty tank, singing praises to  Chaitanya, Koran, Buddha, and his own person, proclaiming himself their  prophet, and performs a mystical dance, dressed in woman's attire,  which, on his part, is an attention to a \"woman goddess\" whom the Babu  calls his \"mother, father and eldest brother.\"    In short, all the attempts to re-establish the pure primitive monotheism  of Aryan India have been a failure. They always got wrecked upon the  double rock of Brahmanism and of prejudices centuries old. But lo! here  appears unexpectedly the pandit Dayanand. None, even of the most  beloved of his disciples, knows who he is and whence he comes. He openly  confesses before the crowds that the name under which he is known is not  his, but was given to him at the Yogi initiation.    The mystical school of Yogis was established by Patanjali, the founder  of one of the six philosophical systems of ancient India. It is supposed  that the Neo-platonists of the second and third Alexandrian Schools were  the followers of Indian Yogis, more especially was their theurgy brought  from India by Pythagoras, according to the tradition. There still exist  in India hundreds of Yogis who follow the system of Patanjali, and  assert that they are in communion with Brahma. Nevertheless, most of  them are do-nothings, mendicants by profession, and great frauds, thanks  to the insatiable longing of the natives for miracles. The real Yogis  avoid appearing in public, and spend their lives in secluded retirement  and studies, except when, as in Dayanand's case, they come forth in  time of need to aid their country. However, it is perfectly certain that  India never saw a more learned Sanskrit scholar, a deeper metaphysician,  a more wonderful orator, and a more fearless denunciator of every evil,  than Dayanand, since the time of Sankharacharya, the celebrated founder  of the Vedanta philosophy, the most metaphysical of Indian systems,  in fact, the crown of pantheistic teaching. Then, Dayanand's personal  appearance is striking. He is immensely tall, his complexion is pale,  rather European than Indian, his eyes are large and bright, and his  greyish hair is long. The Yogis and Dikshatas (initiated) never cut  either their hair or beard. His voice is clear and loud, well calculated  to give expression to every shade of deep feeling, ranging from a sweet  childish caressing whisper to thundering wrath against the evil doings  and falsehoods of the priests. All this taken together produces an  indescribable effect on the impressionable Hindu. Wherever Dayanand  appears crowds prostrate themselves in the dust over his footprints;  but, unlike Babu Keshub Chunder Sen, he does not teach a new  religion, does not invent new dogmas. He only asks them to renew their  half-forgotten Sanskrit studies, and, having compared the doctrines of  their forefathers with what they have become in the hands of Brahmans,  to return to the pure conceptions of Deity taught by the primitive  Rishis--Agni, Vayu, Aditya, and Anghira--the patriarchs who first gave  the Vedas to humanity. He does not even claim that the Vedas are a  heavenly revelation, but simply teaches that \"every word in these  scriptures belongs to the highest inspiration possible to the earthly  man, an inspiration that is repeated in the history of humanity, and,  when necessary, may happen to any nation.....\"    During his five years of work Swami Dayanand made about two million  proselytes, chiefly amongst the higher castes. Judging by appearances,  they are all ready to sacrifice to him their lives and souls and even  their earthly possessions, which are often more precious to them than  their lives. But Dayanand is a real Yogi, he never touches money, and  despises pecuniary affairs. He contents himself with a few handfuls of  rice per day. One is inclined to think that this wonderful Hindu bears  a charmed life, so careless is he of rousing the worst human passions,  which are so dangerous in India. A marble statue could not be less moved  by the raging wrath of the crowd. We saw him once at work. He sent away  all his faithful followers and forbade them either to watch over him  or to defend him, and stood alone before the infuriated crowd, facing  calmly the monster ready to spring upon him and tear him to pieces.        Here a short explanation is necessary. A few years ago a society of  well-informed, energetic people was formed in New York. A certain  sharp-witted savant surnamed them \"La Societe des Malcontents du  Spiritisme.\" The founders of this club were people who, believing in the  phenomena of spiritualism as much as in the possibility of every other  phenomenon in Nature, still denied the theory of the \"spirits.\" They  considered that the modern psychology was a science still in the first  stages of its development, in total ignorance of the nature of the  psychic man, and denying, as do many other sciences, all that cannot be  explained according to its own particular theories.    From the first days of its existence some of the most learned Americans  joined the Society, which became known as the Theosophical Society. Its  members differed on many points, much as do the members of any other  Society, Geographical or Archeological, which fights for years over  the sources of the Nile, or the Hieroglyphs of Egypt. But everyone is  unanimously agreed that, as long as there is water in the Nile,  its sources must exist somewhere. So much about the phenomena of  spiritualism and mesmerism. These phenomena were still waiting their  Champollion--but the Rosetta stone was to be searched for neither in  Europe nor in America, but in the far-away countries where they still  believe in magic, where wonders are performed daily by the native  priesthood, and where the cold materialism of science has never yet  reached--in one word, in the East.    The Council of the Society knew that the Lama-Buddhists, for instance,  though not believing in God, and denying the personal immortality of the  soul, are yet celebrated for their \"phenomena,\" and that mesmerism was  known and daily practised in China from time immemorial under the name  of \"gina.\" In India they fear and hate the very name of the spirits whom  the Spiritualists venerate so deeply, yet many an ignorant fakir can  perform \"miracles\" calculated to turn upside-down all the notions of  a scientist and to be the despair of the most celebrated of European  prestidigitateurs. Many members of the Society have visited India--many  were born there and have themselves witnessed the \"sorceries\" of the  Brahmans. The founders of the Club, well aware of the depth of modern  ignorance in regard to the spiritual man, were most anxious that  Cuvier's method of comparative anatomy should acquire rights of  citizenship among metaphysicians, and, so, progress from regions  physical to regions psychological on its own inductive and deductive  foundation. \"Otherwise,\" they thought, \"psychology will be unable to  move forward a single step, and may even obstruct every other branch of  Natural History.\" Instances have not been wanting of physiology poaching  on the preserves of purely metaphysical and abstract knowledge, all  the time feigning to ignore the latter absolutely, and seeking to class  psychology with the positive sciences, having first bound it to a Bed  of Procrustes, where it refuses to yield its secret to its clumsy  tormentors.    In a short time the Theosophical Society counted its members, not  by hundreds, but by thousands. All the \"malcontents\" of American  Spiritualism--and there were at that time twelve million Spiritualists  in America--joined the Society. Collateral branches were formed in  London, Corfu, Australia, Spain, Cuba, California, etc. Everywhere  experiments were being performed, and the conviction that it is not  spirits alone who are the causes of the phenomena was becoming general.    In course of time branches of the Society were in India and in Ceylon.  The Buddhist and Brahmanical members became more numerous than the  Europeans. A league was formed, and to the name of the Society was  added the subtitle, \"The Brotherhood of Humanity.\" After an active  correspondence between the Arya-Samaj, founded by Swami Dayanand, and  the Theosophical Society, an amalgamation was arranged between the  two bodies. Then the Chief Council of the New York branch decided upon  sending a special delegation to India, for the purpose of studying, on  the spot, the ancient language of the Vedas and the manuscripts and  the wonders of Yogism. On the 17th of December, 1878, the delegation,  composed of two secretaries and two members of the council of the  Theosophical Society, started from New York, to pause for a while in  London, and then to proceed to Bombay, where it landed in February,  1879.    It may easily be conceived that, under these circumstances, the members  of the delegation were better able to study the country and to make  fruitful researches than might, otherwise, have been the case. Today  they are looked upon as brothers and aided by the most influential  natives of India. They count among the members of their society  pandits of Benares and Calcutta, and Buddhist priests of the Ceylon  Viharas--amongst others the learned Sumangala, mentioned by Minayeff  in the description of his visit to Adam's Peak--and Lamas of Thibet,  Burmah, Travancore and elsewhere. The members of the delegation are  admitted to sanctuaries where, as yet, no European has set his foot.  Consequently they may hope to render many services to Humanity and  Science, in spite"]]]
