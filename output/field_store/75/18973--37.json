Y., 1895 to date, quarterly, $4.00 a year). This  journal, the organ of the American Historical Association, contains  articles by scholars, critical reviews of all important works, and notes  and news. The _History Teacher's Magazine_ is edited under the supervision  of a committee of the American Historical Association (Philadelphia, 1909  to date, monthly, $2.00 a year). Every well-equipped school library should  contain the files of the _National Geographic Magazine_ (Washington, 1890  to date, monthly, $2.00 a year) and of _Art and Archeology_ (Washington,  1914 to date, monthly, $3.00 a year). These two periodicals make a special  feature of illustrations.    WORKS ON THE STUDY AND TEACHING OF HISTORY    Useful books for the teacher's library include H. E. Bourne, _The Teaching  of History and Civics in the Elementary and the Secondary School_ (N. Y.,  1902, Longmans, Green, and Co., $1.50), Henry Johnson, _The Teaching of  History_ (N. Y., 1915, Macmillan, $1.40), H. B. George, _Historical  Evidence_ (N.Y., 1909, Oxford University Press, American Branch, 75  cents), Frederic Harrison, _The Meaning of History and Other Historical  Pieces_ (New ed., N.Y., 1900, Macmillan, $1.75), J. H. Robinson, _The New  History_ (N. Y., 1912, Macmillan, $1.50), and H. B. George, _The Relations  of History and Geography_ (4th ed., N. Y., 1910, Oxford University Press,  American Branch, $1.10).

Y., 1899, Macmillan, 50 cents).    _The Study of History in Secondary Schools_. Report to the American  Historical Association by a Committee of Five (N. Y., 1911, Macmillan, 25  cents).    _Historical Sources in Schools._ Report to the New England History  Teachers' Association by a Select Committee (N. Y., 1902, Macmillan, out  of print).    _A History Syllabus for Secondary Schools_. Report by a Special Committee  of the New England History Teachers' Association (N. Y., 1904, Heath,  $1.32).    _A Bibliography of History for Schools and Libraries._ Published under the  auspices of the Association of History Teachers of the Middle States and  Maryland (2d ed., N. Y., 1915, Longmans, Green, and Co., 60 cents).    DICTIONARIES AND ENCYCLOPEDIAS    The most useful dictionaries of classical antiquities are H. B. Walters,  _A Classical Dictionary_ (N. Y., 1916, Putnam, $6.50) and H. T. Peck,  _Harper's Dictionary of Classical Literature and Antiquities_ (N. Y.,  1897, American Book Co., $6.00). Cambridge University, England, has  published _A Companion to Greek Studies_, edited by L. Whibley (2d ed., N.  Y., 1906, Putnam, $6.00), and _A Companion to Latin Studies_, edited by J.  E. Sandys (N. Y., 1911, Putnam, $6.00). These two volumes treat every  phase of ancient life in separate essays by distinguished scholars. For  chronology, genealogies, lists of sovereigns, and other data the most  valuable works are Arthur Hassall, _European History, 476-1910_ (new ed.,  N. Y., 1910, Macmillan, $2.25), G. P. Putnam, _Tabular Views of Universal  History_ (new ed., N. Y., 1915, Putnam, $2.50), and Karl J. Ploetz, _A  Handbook of Universal History_, translated by W. H. Tillinghast (Boston,  1915, Houghton Mifflin Co., $3.00).      SYLLABI    The _Illustrated Topics for Ancient History_, arranged by D. C. Knowlton  (Philadelphia, McKinley Publishing Co., 65 cents), contain much valuable  material in the shape of a syllabus, source quotations, outline maps,  pictures, and other aids. The following syllabi have been prepared for  collegiate instruction:    Botsford, G. W. _A Syllabus of Roman History_ (N. Y., 1915, Macmillan, 50  cents).    Munro, D. C., and SELLERY, G. C. _A Syllabus of Medieval History, 395-  1500_ (N. Y., 1913, Longmans, Green, and Co., $1.00).    Richardson, O.

ATLASES    An admirable collection of maps for school use is W. R. Shepherd,  _Historical Atlas_ (N. Y., 1911, Holt, $2.50), with about two hundred and  fifty maps covering the historical field. The latest and one of the best  of the classical atlases is _Murray's Small Classical Atlas_, edited by G.  B. Grundy (N. Y., 1904, Oxford University Press, American Branch, $1.35).  A special feature of this work is the adoption of the system of colored  contours to indicate configuration. The _Atlas of Ancient and Classical  Geography_ in \"Everyman's Library\" (N. Y., 1910, Dutton, 35 cents) might  well be purchased by every student. Other valuable works are E. W. Dow,  _Atlas of European History_ (N. Y., 1907, Holt, $1.50) and Ramsay Muir, _A  New School Atlas of Modern History_ (N. Y., 1911, Holt, $1.25). Much use  can be made of the inexpensive and handy _Literary and Historical Atlas of  Europe_ by J. G. Bartholomew in \"Everyman's Library\" (N. Y., 1910, Dutton,  35 cents).    WALL MAPS AND CHARTS    Kiepert's _New Wall Maps of Ancient History_ (Chicago, Rand, McNally, and  Co.) and Johnston's _Classical Series_ (Chicago, A. J. Nystrom and Co.)  may be obtained singly, mounted on common rollers, or by sets in a case  with spring rollers. The text is in Latin. The Spruner-Bretschneider  _Historical Maps_ are ten in number, size 62 x 52 inches, and cover the  period from A.D. 350 to 1815. The text is in German (Chicago, Nystrom,  each $6.00; Rand, McNally, and Co., each $6.50). Johnston's _Maps of  English and European History_ are sixteen in number, size 40 x 30 inches,  and include four maps of ancient history (Chicago, Nystrom, each $2.50). A  new series of _European History Maps_, thirty-nine in number, size 44 x 32  inches, has been prepared for the study of ancient history by Professors  J. H. Breasted and C. F. Huth, and for medieval and modern history by  Professor S. B. Harding (Chicago, Denoyer-Geppert Co., complete set with  tripod stand, $52.00; in two spring roller cases, $73.00). These maps may  also be had separately. The maps in this admirable series omit all  irrelevant detail, present place names in the modern English form, and in  choice of subject matter emphasize the American viewpoint. The school  should also possess good physical wall maps such as the Sydow-Habenicht or  the Kiepert series, both to be obtained from Rand, McNally, and Co. The  text is in German. Phillips's _Model Test Maps_ and Johnston's _New Series  of Physical Wall Maps_ are obtainable from A. J. Nystrom and Co. The only  large charts available are those prepared by MacCoun for his _Historical  Geography Charts of Europe_. The two sections, \"Ancient and Classical\" and  \"Medieval and Modern,\" are sold separately (N. Y., Silver, Burdett, and  Co., $15.00). A helpful series of _Blackboard Outline Maps_ is issued by  J. L. Engle, Beaver, Penn. These are wall maps, printed with paint on  blackboard cloth, for use with an ordinary crayon. Such maps are also sold  by the Denoyer-Geppert Co., Chicago.    OUTLINE MAPS    The \"Studies\" following each chapter of this book include various  exercises for which small outline maps are required. Such maps are sold by  D. C. Heath and Co., Boston, New York, Chicago. Useful atlases of outline  maps are also to be had of the McKinley Publishing Co., Philadelphia,  Atkinson, Mentzer and Grover, Chicago, W. B. Harison, New York City, and  of other publishers.    ILLUSTRATIONS    The best photographs of ancient works of art must usually be obtained from  the foreign publishers in Naples, Florence, Rome, Munich, Paris, Athens,  and London, or from their American agents. Such photographs, in the usual  size, 8 x 10 inches, sell, unmounted, at from 6 to 8 francs a dozen. All  dealers in lantern slides issue descriptive catalogues of a great variety  of archaeological subjects. In addition to photographs and lantern slides,  a collection of stereoscopic views is very helpful in giving vividness and  interest to instruction in ancient history. An admirable series of  photographs for the stereoscope, including Egypt, Palestine, Greece, and  Italy, is issued by Underwood and Underwood, New York City. The same firm  supplies convenient maps and handbooks for use in this connection. The  Keystone stereographs, prepared by the Keystone View Company, Meadville,  Penn., may also be cordially recommended. The architecture, costumes,  amusements, and occupations of the Middle Ages in England are shown in  _Longmans' Historical Illustrations_ (six portfolios, each containing  twelve plates in black-and-white, Longmans, Green, and Co., 90 cents, each  portfolio). The same firm issues _Longmans' Historical Wall Pictures_,  consisting of twelve colored pictures from original paintings illustrating  English history (each picture, separately, 80 cents; in a portfolio,  $10.50). Other notable collections are Lehmann's _Geographical Pictures,  Historical Pictures_, and _Types of Nations_, and Cybulski's _Historical  Pictures_ (Chicago, Denoyer-Geppert Co.; each picture separately mounted  on rollers, $1.35 to $2.25).

Have respectable servants been employed by thee in offices that are  respectable, indifferent ones in indifferent offices, and low ones in  offices that are low? Hast thou appointed to high offices ministers  that are guileless and of well conduct for generations and above the  common run? Oppressest thou not thy people with cruel and severe  punishment? And, O bull of the Bharata race, do thy ministers rule thy  kingdom under thy orders? Do thy ministers ever slight thee like  sacrificial priests slighting men that are fallen (and incapable of  performing any more sacrifices) or like wives slighting husbands that  are proud and incontinent in their behaviour? Is the commander of thy  forces possessed of sufficient confidence, brave, intelligent, patient,  well-conducted, of good birth, devoted to thee, and competent? Treatest  thou with consideration and regard the chief officers of thy army that  are skilled in every kind of welfare, are forward, well-behaved, and  endued with prowess? Givest thou to thy troops their sanctioned rations  and pay in the appointed time? Thou dost not oppress them by  withholding these? Knowest thou that the misery caused by arrears of  pay and irregularity in the distribution of rations driveth the troops  to mutiny, and that is called by the learned to be one of the greatest  of mischiefs? Are all the principal high-born men devoted to thee, and  ready with cheerfulness to lay down their lives in battle for thy sake?  I hope no single individual of passions uncontrolled is ever permitted  by thee to rule as he likes a number of concerns at the same time  appertaining to the army? Is any servant of thine, who hath  accomplished well a particular business by the employment of special  ability, disappointed in obtaining from thee a little more regard, and  an increase of food and pay? I hope thou rewardest persons of learning  and humility, and skill in every kind of knowledge with gifts of wealth  and honour proportionate to their qualifications. Dost thou support, O  bull in the Bharata race, the wives and children of men that have given  their lives for thee and have been distressed on thy account?  Cherishest thou, O son of Pritha, with paternal affection the foe that  hath been weakened, or him also that hath sought thy shelter, having  been vanquished in battle? O lord of Earth, art thou equal unto all  men, and can every one approach thee without fear, as if thou wert  their mother and father? And O bull of the Bharata race, marchest thou,  without loss of time, and reflecting well upon three kinds of forces,  against thy foe when thou hearest that he is in distress? O subjugator  of all foes beginnest thou thy march when the time cometh, having taken  into consideration all the omens you might see, the resolutions thou  hast made, and that the ultimate victory depends upon the twelve  mandalas (such as reserves, ambuscades, &c, and payment of pay to the  troops in advance)? And, O persecutor of all foes, givest thou gems and  jewels, unto the principal officers of enemy, as they deserve, without  thy enemy's knowledge? O son of Pritha, seekest thou to conquer thy  incensed foes that are slaves to their passions, having first conquered  thy own soul and obtained the mastery over thy own senses? Before thou  marchest out against thy foes, dost thou properly employ the four arts  of reconciliation, gift (of wealth) producing disunion, and application  of force? O monarch, goest thou out against thy enemies, having first  strengthened thy own kingdom? And having gone out against them,  exertest thou to the utmost to obtain victory over them? And having  conquered them, seekest thou to protect them with care? Are thy army  consisting of four kinds of forces, viz., the regular troops, the  allies, the mercenaries, and the irregulars, each furnished with the  eight ingredients, viz., cars, elephants, horses, offices, infantry,  camp-followers, spies possessing a thorough knowledge of the country,  and ensigns led out against thy enemies after having been well trained  by superior officers? O oppressor of all foes, O great king, I hope  thou slayest thy foes without regarding their seasons of reaping and of  famine? O king, I hope thy servants and agents in thy own kingdom and  in the kingdoms of thy foes continue to look after their respective  duties and to protect one another. O monarch, I hope trusted servants  have been employed by thee to look after thy food, the robes thou  wearest and the perfumes thou usest. I hope, O king, thy treasury,  barns, stables arsenals, and women's apartments, are all protected by  servants devoted to thee and ever seeking thy welfare. I hope, O  monarch, thou protectest first thyself from thy domestic and public  servants, then from those servants of thy relatives and from one  another. Do thy servants, O king, ever speak to thee in the forenoon  regarding thy extravagant expenditure in respect of thy drinks, sports,  and women? Is thy expenditure always covered by a fourth, a third or a  half of thy income? Cherishest thou always, with food and wealth,  relatives, superiors, merchants, the aged, and other proteges, and the  distressed? Do the accountants and clerks employed by thee in looking  after thy income and expenditure, always appraise thee every day in the  forenoon of thy income and expenditure? Dismissest thou without fault  servants accomplished in business and popular and devoted to thy  welfare? O Bharata, dost thou employ superior, indifferent, and low  men, after examining them well in offices they deserve? O monarch,  employest thou in thy business persons that are thievish or open to  temptation, or hostile, or minors? Persecutest thou thy kingdom by the  help of thievish or covetous men, or minors, or women? Are the  agriculturists in thy kingdom contented. Are large tanks and lakes  constructed all over thy kingdom at proper distances, without  agriculture being in thy realm entirely dependent on the showers of  heaven? Are the agriculturists in thy kingdom wanting in either seed or  food? Grantest thou with kindness loans (of seed-grains) unto the  tillers, taking only a fourth in excess of every measure by the  hundred? O child, are the four professions of agriculture, trade,  cattle-rearing, and lending at interest, carried on by honest men? Upon  these O monarch, depends the happiness of thy people. O king, do the  five brave and wise men, employed in the five offices of protecting the  city, the citadel, the merchants, and the agriculturists, and punishing  the criminals, always benefit thy kingdom by working in union with one  another? For the protection of thy city, have the villages been made  like towns, and the hamlets and outskirts of villages like villages?  Are all these entirely under thy supervision and sway? Are thieves and  robbers that sack thy town pursued by thy police over the even and  uneven parts of thy kingdom? Consolest thou women and are they  protected in thy realm? I hope thou placest not any confidence in them,  nor divulgest any secret before any of them? O monarch, having heard of  any danger and having reflected on it also, liest thou in the inner  apartments enjoying every agreeable object? Having slept during the  second and the third divisions of the night, thinkest thou of religion  and profit in the fourth division wakefully. O son of Pandu, rising  from bed at the proper time and dressing thyself well, showest thou  thyself to thy people, accompanied by ministers conversant with the  auspiciousness or otherwise of moments? O represser of all foes, do men  dressed in red and armed with swords and adorned with ornaments stand  by thy side to protect thy person? O monarch! behavest thou like the  god of justice himself unto those that deserve punishment and those  that deserve worship, unto those that are dear to thee and those that  thou likest not? O son of Pritha, seekest thou to cure bodily diseases  by medicines and fasts, and mental illness with the advice of the aged?  I hope that the physicians engaged in looking after thy health are well  conversant with the eight kinds of treatment and are all attached and  devoted to thee. Happeneth it ever, O monarch, that from covetousness  or folly or pride thou failest to decide between the plaintiff and the  defendant who have come to thee? Deprivest thou, through covetousness  or folly, of their pensions the proteges who have sought thy shelter  from trustfulness or love? Do the people that inhabit thy realm, bought  by thy foes, ever seek to raise disputes with thee, uniting themselves  with one another? Are those amongst thy foes that are feeble always  repressed by the help of troops that are strong, by the help of both  counsels and troops? Are all the principal chieftains (of thy empire)  all devoted to thee? Are they ready to lay down their lives for thy  sake, commanded by thee? Dost thou worship Brahmanas and wise men  according to their merits in respect of various branches of learning? I  tell thee, such worship is without doubt, highly beneficial to thee.  Hast thou faith in the religion based on the three Vedas and practised  by men who have gone before thee? Dost thou carefully follow the  practices that were followed by them? Are accomplished Brahmanas  entertained in thy house and in thy presence with nutritive and  excellent food, and do they also obtain pecuniary gifts at the  conclusion of those feasts? Dost thou, with passions under complete  control and with singleness of mind, strive to perform the sacrifices  called Vajapeya and Pundarika with their full complement of rites?  Bowest thou unto thy relatives and superiors, the aged, the gods, the  ascetics, the Brahmanas, and the tall trees (banian) in villages, that  are of so much benefit to people? O sinless one, causest thou ever  grief or anger in any one? Do priests capable of granting thee  auspicious fruits ever stand by thy"]]]
