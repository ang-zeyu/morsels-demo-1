When Guleesh said from what he saw he thought the girl was not  satisfied with the marriage that was going to take place in the palace  before he and the sheehogues broke it up, there came a red blush into  the girl's cheek, and he was more certain than ever that she had sooner  be as she was--badly as she was--than be the married wife of the man  she hated. When Guleesh said that he would be very thankful to the  priest if he would keep her in his own house, the kind man said he  would do that as long as Guleesh pleased, but that he did not know what  they ought to do with her, because they had no means of sending her  back to her father again.    Guleesh answered that he was uneasy about the same thing, and that he  saw nothing to do but to keep quiet until they should find some  opportunity of doing something better. They made it up then between  themselves that the priest should let on that it was his brother's  daughter he had, who was come on a visit to him from another county,  and that he should tell everybody that she was dumb, and do his best to  keep every one away from her. They told the young girl what it was they  intended to do, and she showed by her eyes that she was obliged to them.    Guleesh went home then, and when his people asked him where he had  been, he said that he had been asleep at the foot of the ditch, and had  passed the night there.    There was great wonderment on the priest's neighbours at the girl who  came so suddenly to his house without any one knowing where she was  from, or what business she had there. Some of the people said that  everything was not as it ought to be, and others, that Guleesh was not  like the same man that was in it before, and that it was a great story,  how he was drawing every day to the priest's house, and that the priest  had a wish and a respect for him, a thing they could not clear up at  all.    That was true for them, indeed, for it was seldom the day went by but  Guleesh would go to the priest's house, and have a talk with him, and  as often as he would come he used to hope to find the young lady well  again, and with leave to speak; but, alas! she remained dumb and  silent, without relief or cure. Since she had no other means of  talking, she carried on a sort of conversation between herself and  himself, by moving her hand and fingers, winking her eyes, opening and  shutting her mouth, laughing or smiling, and a thousand other signs, so  that it was not long until they understood each other very well.  Guleesh was always thinking how he should send her back to her father;  but there was no one to go with her, and he himself did not know what  road to go, for he had never been out of his own country before the  night he brought her away with him. Nor had the priest any better  knowledge than he; but when Guleesh asked him, he wrote three or four  letters to the king of France, and gave them to buyers and sellers of  wares, who used to be going from place to place across the sea; but  they all went astray, and never a one came to the king's hand.    This was the way they were for many months, and Guleesh was falling  deeper and deeper in love with her every day, and it was plain to  himself and the priest that she liked him. The boy feared greatly at  last, lest the king should really hear where his daughter was, and take  her back from himself, and he besought the priest to write no more, but  to leave the matter to God.    So they passed the time for a year, until there came a day when Guleesh  was lying by himself, on the grass, on the last day of the last month  in autumn, and he was thinking over again in his own mind of everything  that happened to him from the day that he went with the sheehogues  across the sea. He remembered then, suddenly, that it was one November  night that he was standing at the gable of the house, when the  whirlwind came, and the sheehogues in it, and he said to himself: \"We  have November night again to-day, and I'll stand in the same place I  was last year, until I see if the good people come again. Perhaps I  might see or hear something that would be useful to me, and might bring  back her talk again to Mary\"--that was the name himself and the priest  called the king's daughter, for neither of them knew her right name. He  told his intention to the priest, and the priest gave him his blessing.    Guleesh accordingly went to the old rath when the night was darkening,  and he stood with his bent elbow leaning on a grey old flag, waiting  till the middle of the night should come. The moon rose slowly; and it  was like a knob of fire behind him; and there was a white fog which was  raised up over the fields of grass and all damp places, through the  coolness of the night after a great heat in the day. The night was calm  as is a lake when there is not a breath of wind to move a wave on it,  and there was no sound to be heard but the _cronawn_ of the insects  that would go by from time to time, or the hoarse sudden scream of the  wild-geese, as they passed from lake to lake, half a mile up in the air  over his head; or the sharp whistle of the golden and green plover,  rising and lying, lying and rising, as they do on a calm night. There  were a thousand thousand bright stars shining over his head, and there  was a little frost out, which left the grass under his foot white and  crisp.    He stood there for an hour, for two hours, for three hours, and the  frost increased greatly, so that he heard the breaking of the  _traneens_ under his foot as often as he moved. He was thinking, in his  own mind, at last, that the sheehogues would not come that night, and  that it was as good for him to return back again, when he heard a sound  far away from him, coming towards him, and he recognised what it was at  the first moment. The sound increased, and at first it was like the  beating of waves on a stony shore, and then it was like the falling of  a great waterfall, and at last it was like a loud storm in the tops of  the trees, and then the whirlwind burst into the rath of one rout, and  the sheehogues were in it.    It all went by him so suddenly that he lost his breath with it, but he  came to himself on the spot, and put an ear on himself, listening to  what they would say.    Scarcely had they gathered into the rath till they all began shouting,  and screaming, and talking amongst themselves; and then each one of  them cried out: \"My horse, and bridle, and saddle! My horse, and  bridle, and saddle!\" and Guleesh took courage, and called out as loudly  as any of them: \"My horse, and bridle, and saddle! My horse, and  bridle, and saddle!\" But before the word was well out of his mouth,  another man cried out: \"Ora! Guleesh, my boy, are you here with us  again? How are you getting on with your woman? There's no use in your  calling for your horse to-night. I'll go bail you won't play such a  trick on us again. It was a good trick you played on us last year?\"    \"It was,\" said another man; \"he won't do it again.\"    \"Isn't he a prime lad, the same lad! to take a woman with him that  never said as much to him as, 'How do you do?' since this time last  year!\" says the third man.    \"Perhaps be likes to be looking at her,\" said another voice.    \"And if the _omadawn_ only knew that there's an herb growing up by his  own door, and if he were to boil it and give it to her, she'd be well,\"  said another voice.    \"That's true for you.\"    \"He is an omadawn.\"    \"Don't bother your head with him; we'll be going.\"    \"We'll leave the _bodach_ as he is.\"    And with that they rose up into the air, and out with them with one  _roolya-boolya_ the way they came; and they left poor Guleesh standing  where they found him, and the two eyes going out of his head, looking  after them and wondering.    He did not stand long till he returned back, and he thinking in his own  mind on all he saw and heard, and wondering whether there was really an  herb at his own door that would bring back the talk to the king's  daughter. \"It can't be,\" says he to himself, \"that they would tell it  to me, if there was any virtue in it; but perhaps the sheehogue didn't  observe himself when he let the word slip out of his mouth. I'll search  well as soon as the sun rises, whether there's any plant growing beside  the house except thistles and dockings.\"    He went home, and as tired as he was he did not sleep a wink until the  sun rose on the morrow. He got up then, and it was the first thing he  did to go out and search well through the grass round about the house,  trying could he get any herb that he did not recognise. And, indeed, he  was not long searching till he observed a large strange herb that was  growing up just by the gable of the house.    He went over to it, and observed it closely, and saw that there were  seven little branches coming out of the stalk, and seven leaves growing  on every branch_een_ of them; and that there was a white sap in the  leaves. \"It's very wonderful,\" said he to himself, \"that I never  noticed this herb before.

My friends, I confess it:        Great displeasure I take lying alone in my bed.      But it's a horror to fear on the pathways of love you'll discover        Snakes and their venom beneath roses of eager desire--      That at the moment supreme, when I'm yielding to pleasure so fully,        Right at my head as it droops, hissing disease may approach.      That's why Faustina as my companion in bed makes me happy:        Loving she always remains faithful, as I am to her.      Young men are aroused in their passions by obstacles and by excitement;        I prefer to go slow, savoring pleasures secure.      Is it not bliss to exchange tender kisses containing no dangers,        Sucking into our lungs, carefree, our partner's own life?      That is the way our long nights of enjoyment are passed. We listen,        Breast against breast, to the storm, pouring down rain in the wind      Morning begins to dawn, we expect from these hours approaching        Blossoms that will adorn festive the coming new day.      Quirites, permit me the joy, and may this, of all pleasures on earth the        First and the last, be vouchsafed all of mankind by the god.          XXII      Ah, to uphold one's respectable name is not easy. The Lady        Fame has an ancient foe: Cupid, my master and lord.      Oh, by the way, have you heard of the cause of their mutual hatred?        It's an old story, I think--Let me just tell it again.      Powerful ever the goddess, but nevertheless to her fellows        Overbearing and rude, quite unendurable. She      Had by the gods since time out of mind at their banquets been dreaded,        Yelling with brassiest voice orders to great and to small.      Once, in her arrogance even maintained that she had subjected        To her own will, as her slave, Jove's most illustrious son.      \"One of these days, O father of deities,\" cried she in triumph,        \"I shall be bringing you my--Hercules, as if new born.      Don't think that Hercules be still that boy whom Alcmene once bore you;        His adulation of me makes him now god upon earth.      When toward Olympus he gazes, I've no doubt you hope that he's looking        Piously toward your knees. Hardly. He's looking for me.      Worthiest man! O the vision of winning my favor makes easy        Hitherto unexplored paths, under that powerful foot.      I do my part, for I meet him halfway and proclaim his adventures        Praising his name in advance, even before he's begun.      One day you'll wed me to Hercules.  Hero who Amazons conquered        That day will overwhelm me. Happily I'll call him:  spouse.\"      All of the gods kept their counsel, and none would reply to the braggart,        Lest in a pique she devise vengeance against one of them.      Cupid, escaping attention, slipped off to enslave, however, her hero:        Artlessly conquering by--force of a beautiful girl,      Afterward decked out his couple in mute masquerade:  lionskin        Over her shoulders, the club leaned (by much toil) at her side;      Wiry stiff hair of the hero larded with blossoms, a distaff        Laid in his fist, to conform strength to the dalliance of love.      Scene now completed and ready to tease, he goes scampering, shouting        For all Olympus to hear: \"Come, see these glorious deeds!      Heaven and Earth and the Sun on his indefatigable journey        Over that infinite path never did witness the like!\"      Everyone hastened, gulled by the dissolute boy, who feigning        Earnest, had summoned them all (Fame by no means lagged behind).      Which of the gods will now smile in sweet condescension on Cupid?        --Juno! delighted, of course, seeing a man humbled so.      Fame, on the other hand, stood there ashamed, embarrassed, despairing.        First she just laughed, saying: \"Gods, be not deceived. It's a masque.      I know my hero too well to be fooled by disguises of actors.\"        Soon, though, in pain she perceived: Hercules, none but he.      (Vulcan had not been one thousandth so vexed to discover his playmate        Under his meshes ensnared, caught with his own lusty friend,      Lying just as the wiles of the net at the most crucial moment        Deftly embraced their embrace, trapping their instant of joy.      How those boys, Bacchus and Mercury, guffawed, and freely admitted:        Sweet must be the repose, lying on bosom so fine      Of this magnificent woman. They turned to Vulcan entreating:        \"Do not release them just yet. Let us inspect them once more.\"      And the old cuckold was cuckold enough to comply with their wishes.)        As for poor Fame, in all haste, burning with wrath she must flee.      Since then no armistice has been proclaimed to the feuding between them.        Let her but favor a man, hot in pursuit is the boy.      He whom Fame honors most can least defend against Cupid,        And her most dang'rous attacks strike the most morally proud.      Whoever tries to escape him is dragged down from bad deeds to worse ones.        Yes, he will offer you girls--if like a fool you despise      These, only then do you feel from his bow the arrows most vicious:        Heat of man's love for man, ardent desires toward beasts.      For those ashamed of him Cupid reserves the bitterest passions,        Mingling for hypocrites their pleasure in vice and remorse.      But, at the same time, the goddess seeks him, she's watching and list'ning.        Should find him with you, ill disposed will she be:      Frighten you, frowning austerely, contemptuously, violently casting        Into the worst of repute houses he's known to frequent.      Ah, it's the same with me, too. I haven't escaped her, the goddess.        Jealously she seeks me out, sweet secret love to expose.      I will submit to the ancient law and in silence revere her,        For, when great lords fall out, I like the Greeks must atone.          XXIII      However comely be strength, or free and undaunted comportment,        Secrecy is for a man most important of all.      Mighty subduer of cities, Discretion, O princess of nations,        Goddess whom I adore, safely you've led me thus far.      Now, though, what fate shall befall me? My frivolous muse has now opened        --Cupid, the scamp--opens lips hitherto sealed so well.      Difficult is it, alas, to conceal the shame of a monarch;        Hide it can neither his crown, nor a tight Phrygian cap:      Midas has asses ears! the first servant discovers--O horror!        Shame of this secret so weighs, Midas unburdens his heart.      Into the earth for safekeeping the servant must bury the story,        Easing in this way the king:  earth must conceal the tale.      Reeds in a trice are sprouting and rustling in murmuring breezes:        \"Midas, o Midas the King--bears the ears of an ass!\"      Mine is a secret more pleasant, but even more difficult keeping:        Out of abundance of heart eagerly speaketh my mouth.      None of my ladyfriends dare I confide in, for they would but chide me;        Nor any gentleman friend, lest he be rival to me.      Rapture proclaim to the grove, to the echoing cliffs perorate it?        One can do that if one's young, or if one's lonely enough.      I to hexameters tell, in pentameters I will confide it:        During the day she was joy, happiness all the night long.      Courted by so many suitors, avoided the snares that were set her        Now by one bolder than I, now by another in guile,      Cleverly, daintily, always slipped past them, and sure of the byways,        Comes to her lover's embrace, where he so eagerly waits.      Luna! Don't rise yet. She's coming, and must not be seen by the neighbor!        Breezes, rustle the leaves: muffle the sound of her feet.      And as for you, little poems, o grow and flower, your blossoms        Cradling themselves in the air, tepid and soft with love's breath.      Wafting, betray to Quirites, as Midas' reeds did with cheap gossip,        One happy couple in love, and their sweet secret, at last.          XXIV      I in the back of the garden, the last of the gods, in a corner,        Ineptly formed, must I stand. Evil the inroads of time.      Cucumber vines grow entwining about this primeval lingam,        Cracking it almost in two under the weight of the fruit.      Faggots are heaped all about me against the cold of the winter,        Which I so hate for the crows settling then down on my head,      Which they befoul very shamefully. Summer's no better: the servants        Empty their bowels and show insolent, naked behinds.      Filth, above and below! I was clearly in danger of turning        Into filth myself, toadstool, rotten wood!      Now, by your efforts, O noblest of artists, I shall recover        With fellow gods my just place. And it's no more than my due.      Jupiter's throne, so dishonestly won, it was I who secured it:        Color and ivory, marble and bronze, not to mention the poems.      Now, all intelligent men look upon me in kindness. They like to        Form their own image of me, just as the poet has done.      Nor do the girls take offense when they see me--by no means the matrons.        None finds me ugly today, though I am monstrously strong.      Half a foot long, as reward, your glorious rod (dear poet)        Proudly shall strut from your loins, when but your dearest commands,      Nor shall your member grow weary until you've enjoyed the full dozen        Artful positions the great poet Philainis describes.          ABOUT THE ELEGIES      Goethe cultivated a special, italianate hand for this portfolio of  twenty-four \"elegies,\" so called because he was emulating the elegiasts  of Imperial Rome, Tibullus, Propertius, Catullus.  The Elegies have  never before been published as here, together in the cyclical form of  their original conception.  Experts even denied that the two priapeia (I  & XXIV)"]]]
