Now if you live in a city or town large enough to support an  electrical supply store, there you will find the necessary apparatus  on sale, and someone who can tell you what you want to know about it  and how it works. If you live away from the marts and hives of  industry you can send to various makers of wireless apparatus  [Footnote: A list of makers of wireless apparatus will be found in the  _Appendix_.] for their catalogues and price-lists and these will give  you much useful information. But in either case it is the better plan  for you to know before you start in to buy an outfit exactly what  apparatus you need to produce the result you have in mind, and this  you can gain in easy steps by reading this book.    Kinds of Wireless Systems.--There are two distinct kinds of wireless  systems and these are: the _wireless telegraph_ system, and the  _wireless telephone_ system. The difference between the wireless  telegraph and the wireless telephone is that the former transmits  messages by means of a _telegraph key_, and the latter transmits  conversation and music by means of a _microphone transmitter_. In  other words, the same difference exists between them in this respect  as between the Morse telegraph and the Bell telephone.    Parts of a Wireless System.--Every complete wireless station, whether  telegraph or telephone, consists of three chief separate and distinct  parts and these are: (a) the _aerial wire system_, or _antenna_ as it  is often called, (b) the _transmitter_, or _sender_, and (c) the  _receiver_, or, more properly, the _receptor_. The aerial wire is  precisely the same for either wireless telegraphy or wireless  telephony. The transmitter of a wireless telegraph set generally uses  a _spark gap_ for setting up the electric oscillations, while usually  for wireless telephony a _vacuum tube_ is employed for this purpose.  The receptor for wireless telegraphy and telephony is the same and may  include either a _crystal detector_ or a _vacuum tube detector_, as  will be explained presently.    The Easiest Way to Start.--First of all you must obtain a government  license to operate a sending set, but you do not need a license to put  up and use a receiving set, though you are required by law to keep  secret any messages which you may overhear. Since no license is needed  for a receiving set the easiest way to break into the wireless game is  to put up an aerial and hook up a receiving set to it; you can then  listen-in and hear what is going on in the all-pervading ether around  you, and you will soon find enough to make things highly entertaining.    Nearly all the big wireless companies have great stations fitted with  powerful telephone transmitters and at given hours of the day and  night they send out songs by popular singers, dance music by jazz  orchestras, fashion talks by and for the ladies, agricultural reports,  government weather forecasts and other interesting features. Then by  simply shifting the slide on your tuning coil you can often tune-in  someone who is sending _Morse_, that is, messages in the dot and dash  code, or, perhaps a friend who has a wireless telephone transmitter  and is talking. Of course, if you want to _talk back_ you must have a  wireless transmitter, either telegraphic or telephonic, and this is a  much more expensive part of the apparatus than the receptor, both in  its initial cost and in its operation. A wireless telegraph  transmitter is less costly than a wireless telephone transmitter and  it is a very good scheme for you to learn to send and receive  telegraphic messages.    At the present time, however, there are fifteen amateur receiving  stations in the United States to every sending station, so you can see  that the majority of wireless folks care more for listening in to the  broadcasting of news and music than to sending out messages on their  own account. The easiest way to begin wireless, then, is to put up an  aerial and hook up a receiving set to it.    About Aerial Wire Systems.--To the beginner who wants to install a  wireless station the aerial wire system usually looms up as the  biggest obstacle of all, and especially is this true if his house is  without a flag pole, or other elevation from which the aerial wire can  be conveniently suspended.    If you live in the congested part of a big city where there are no  yards and, particularly, if you live in a flat building or an  apartment house, you will have to string your aerial wire on the roof,  and to do this you should get the owner's, or agent's, permission.  This is usually an easy thing to do where you only intend to receive  messages, for one or two thin wires supported at either end of the  building are all that are needed. If for any reason you cannot put  your aerial on the roof then run a wire along the building outside of  your apartment, and, finally, if this is not feasible, connect your  receiver to a wire strung up in your room, or even to an iron or a  brass bed, and you can still get the near-by stations.    An important part of the aerial wire system is the _ground_, that is,  your receiving set must not only be connected with the aerial wire,  but with a wire that leads to and makes good contact with the moist  earth of the ground. Where a house or a building is piped for gas,  water or steam, it is easy to make a ground connection, for all you  have to do is to fasten the wire to one of the pipes with a clamp.  [Footnote: Pipes are often insulated from the ground, which makes them  useless for this purpose.] Where the house is isolated then a lot of  wires or a sheet of copper or of zinc must be buried in the ground at  a sufficient depth to insure their being kept moist.    About the Receiving Apparatus.--You can either buy the parts of the  receiving apparatus separate and hook them up yourself, or you can buy  the apparatus already assembled in a set which is, in the beginning,  perhaps, the better way.    The simplest receiving set consists of (1) a _detector_, (2) a _tuning  coil_, and (3) a _telephone receiver_ and these three pieces of  apparatus are, of course, connected together and are also connected to  the aerial and ground as the diagram in Fig. 1 clearly shows. There  are two chief kinds of detectors used at the present time and these  are: (a) the _crystal detector_, and (b) the _vacuum tube detector_.  The crystal detector is the cheapest and simplest, but it is not as  sensitive as the vacuum tube detector and it requires frequent  adjustment. A crystal detector can be used with or without a battery  while the vacuum tube detector requires two small batteries.    [Illustration: Fig. 1.--Simple Receiving Set.]    A tuning coil of the simplest kind consists of a single layer of  copper wire wound on a cylinder with an adjustable, or sliding,  contact, but for sharp tuning you need a _loose coupled tuning coil_.  Where a single coil tuner is used a _fixed_ condenser should be  connected around the telephone receivers. Where a loose coupled tuner  is employed you should have a variable condenser connected across the  _closed oscillation circuit_ and a _fixed condenser_ across the  telephone receivers.    When listening-in to distant stations the energy of the received  wireless waves is often so very feeble that in order to hear  distinctly an _amplifier_ must be used. To amplify the incoming sounds  a vacuum tube made like a detector is used and sometimes as many as  half-a-dozen of these tubes are connected in the receiving circuit, or  in _cascade_, as it is called, when the sounds are _amplified_, that  is magnified, many hundreds of times.    The telephone receiver of a receiving set is equally as important as  the detector. A single receiver can be used but a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6948"],[0,"The Secrets of the German War Office (#4)"],[1,"inister, and although it was  quite obvious I was sparring for time he seemed in no way inclined to  rush the execution.  Five minutes went; ten minutes went and looking  at his watch, which showed five minutes to eight (although it was fast  getting dusk, I could see that watch-dial distinctly), shrugging his  shoulders and saying, \"I can delay no longer,\" he called a sergeant,  who placed me with my shoulders to the wall and offered me a  handkerchief.  I didn't want a handkerchief.  A few sharp orders and  twelve Mauser tubes pointed their ugly black snouts directly at me.    I hate to tell my sensation just then.  Frankly, I felt nothing  clearly.  The only thing I remember distinctly was the third man in  the second file held his gun in rather a slipshod manner, aiming it  first at my midriff, next pointing it at my nose--which strangely  enough caused me intense annoyance.  How long we stood thus I don't  know.  The next thing I remember was a rattle of grounding arms and  the sight of two other officers, excitedly gesticulating with the one  in charge of the firing squad.  All three presently came towards me  and one pulling out a flask of cognac with a polite bow offered me a  drink.  I needed it; but didn't take it.  All this time I had been  standing motionless with my arms folded across my breast.  I heard one  say to the other, \"Nitchka Curacha\" (no coward).  If he had only  known.    Indeed, had I anticipated such an experience, had I known the things I  know now I doubt if I would have been so pleased with the results of  my first visit to Koenigergratzerstrasse 70, where the Intelligence  Department of the German Admiralty is quartered.  Will the reader step  back with me in the narrative to the day of my officially joining the  Service?  Returning to my hotel after my interview with Captain von  Tappken in his office, I began to reflect.    I had not entered the Service out of pure adventure or for monetary  reasons alone.  Money has never appealed to me as the all-powerful  thing in life.  I have always had enough for creature comforts and as  for adventure I had had my fill during the Boer War and my world  wanderings.  No, I had joined the German Secret Service for quite a  different reason.  I was thinking of the influences that had pressed  me out of my destined groove, by every human right my own.  I remember  how sanguine Count Reitzenstein was that through the Service I ought  to gain the power I had lost.  But as I sat in the hotel room had  occult powers been given me, I never would have taken up Secret  Service work.  But one is not quite as wise at twenty-four as at  thirty-nine.    Well satisfied with my prospects, I arose early the next morning and  walked briskly to Captain Tappken's office.  Punctually at ten o'clock  I announced myself at the Admiralty and after the usual procedure with  the door man, I was received by Herr von Stammer, private secretary of  Captain Tappken.  A very astute and calculating gentleman is Herr von  Stammer.  Suave, genial, talkative, he has the plausible and unstudied  art of extracting information without committing himself in turn.  A  marvelous encyclopÃ¦dia of devious Secret Service facts, an ideal  tutor.    When we were alone in his office, von Stammer began by saying  abruptly:    \"From now on, you must be entirely and absolutely at our Service.  You  will report daily at twelve noon by telephoning a certain number.  At  all times you must be accessible.  You will pay close attention to the  following rules:    \"Absolute silence in regard to your missions.  No conversation with  minor officials but only with the respective heads of departments or  to whomever you are sent.  You will make no memoranda nor carry  written documents.  You will never discuss your affairs with any  employee in the Service whom you may meet.  You are not likely to meet  many.  It is strictly against the rules to become friendly or intimate  with any agent.  You must abstain from intoxicating liquors.  You are  not permitted to have any women associates.  You will be known to us  by a number.  You will sign all your reports by that number.  Always  avoid telephoning, telegraphing and cabling as much as possible.  In  urgent cases do so, but use the cipher that will be supplied to you.\"    He went on to give numerous other minor details and instructions,  elaborating the system, but which might prove wearisome here.  I was  in his office all the forenoon, and when he ushered me out I half  expected to be called into von Tappken's presence to be sent on my  first mission.  Instead of that, I had to wait five months before I  was given my first work and an exceedingly unimportant thing it was.  During those five months I was kept at a steady grind of schooling in  certain things.  Day after day, week after week, I was grounded in  subjects that were essential to efficient Secret Service work.    Broadly, they could be divided into four classes--topography,  trigonometry, naval construction and drawing.  The reasons for these  you will see from my missions.  My tutors were all experts in the  Imperial Service.  A Secret Service agent sent out to investigate and  report on the condition, situation, and armament of a fort like Verdun  in France must be able to make correct estimates of distances, height,  angles, conditions of the ground, etc.  This can only be done by a man  of the correct scientific training.  He must have the science of  topography at his finger tips; he must be able to make quick and  accurate calculations using trigonometry, as well as possessing skill  as a draftsman.  In my mission to Port Arthur, where I had to report  on the defenses, I found this training invaluable.    The same applies to the subject of naval construction.  Before  entering the German Secret Service, I certainly knew the difference  between a torpedo and a torpedo boat destroyer, but naturally could  not give an accurate description of the various types of destroyers  and torpedoes.  My instructor in this subject was Lieutenant Captain  Kurt Steffens, torpedo expert of the Intelligence Department of the  Imperial Navy.  After a month of tutelage under him, I was able to  tell the various types of torpedoes, submarines, and mines, etc., in  use by the principal Powers.  I could even tell by the peculiar  whistle it made whether the torpedo that was being discharged was a  Whitehead or a Brennan.    I was also drilled in the construction of every known kind of naval  gun.  Dozens of model war-crafts were shown to me and explained.  I  saw the model of every warship in the world.  For days at a time I was  made to sit before charts that hung from the walls of certain rooms in  the Intelligence Department and study the silhouettes of every known  varying type of war-craft.  I was schooled in this until I could tell  at a glance what type of a battleship, cruiser, or destroyer it was,  whether it was peculiar to the English, French, Russian or United  States Navy.  As I shall show in relating one of my missions to  England, I was brushed up on the silhouette study of British warships,  for I had to be able to discern and classify them at long range.  The  different ranking officers of the navies of the world, their uniforms,  the personnel of battleships, the systems of flag signals, and codes,  were explained to me in detail.  I was given large books in which were  colored plates of the uniforms and signal flags of every navy in the  world.  I had to study these until at a glance I could tell the rank  and station of the officers and men of the principal navies.  The same  with the signal flags.  I pored over those books night after night  into the early hours of the morning.  My regular hours for tuition  were from ten to twelve in the forenoon and from two until six in the  afternoon.  But it was impossible to compress all the work into that  time.  I was anxious to get my first mission, and I presume I did a  great deal of cramming.    My study was not all in Berlin.  I spent most of my time there at  Koenigergratzerstrasse 70 and at the Zeughaus, the great museum of the  German General Staff.  But there were side trips to the big government  works at Kiel and Wilhelmshafen.  There I was taught every detail of  the mechanics of naval construction and I was not pronounced equipped  until I could talk intelligently about every unassembled part of a  gun, torpedo tube, or mine.    In the course of my five months' instruction under the various experts  of the Prussian Service I had many opportunities to observe the  exhaustive thoroughness and the minuteness of detail which the German  General Staff possesses.  I did not lose the chance of this  opportunity.  I really did observe and see more than was intended for  me to see.  Of the amazing amount of labor, time and money that has  been spent to gather the information contained in the secret archives  of the German General Staff, the marvelous system of war that has been  perfected in the German Empire, I shall tell when I consider the  secrets of the War Machine.    Naturally, I soon came to know still other things than what they  taught me.  I began to consider the whole proposition of Secret  Service, and before relating my first important mission for Germany I  shall tell you some of the general secrets of the System.    There are four systems of Secret Service in Europe, the four leading  powers each possessing one.  First in systematic efficiency is the  German, next comes the Russian, then the French, and English.  England  has a very efficient service in India and her Asiatic possessions, but  has only lately entered the European field.  Last but not least comes  the International Secret Service Bureau with headquarters in Belgium,  a semi-private concern which procures reliable information for anyone  who will pay for it.  This service is generally entrusted with the  procuring of technical details, such as the plans of"]]]
