It is a  remarkable phenomenon, that by a particular position of the ground,  and the lowering of the ridge of division to south-west, the Rio Pao  separates itself from the little system of interior rivers to which it  originally belonged, and for a century past has communicated, through  the channel of the Apure and the Orinoco, with the ocean. What has  been here effected on a small scale by the hand of man, nature often  performs, either by progressively elevating the level of the soil, or  by those falls of the ground occasioned by violent earthquakes. It is  probable, that in the lapse of ages, several rivers of Soudan, and of  New Holland, which are now lost in the sands, or in inland basins,  will open for themselves a course to the shores of the ocean. We  cannot at least doubt, that in both continents there are systems of  interior rivers, which may be considered as not entirely developed;  and which communicate with each other, either in the time of great  risings, or by permanent bifurcations.    The Rio Pao has scooped itself out a bed so deep and broad, that in  the season of rains, when the Cano Grande de Cambury inundates all the  land to the north-west of Guigue, the waters of this Cano, and those  of the lake of Valencia, flow back into the Rio Pao itself; so that  this river, instead of adding water to the lake, tends rather to carry  it away. We see something similar in North America, where geographers  have represented on their maps an imaginary chain of mountains,  between the great lakes of Canada and the country of the Miamis. At  the time of floods, the waters flowing into the lakes communicate with  those which run into the Mississippi; and it is practicable to proceed  by boats from the sources of the river St. Mary to the Wabash, as well  as from the Chicago to the Illinois. These analogous facts appear to  me well worthy of the attention of hydrographers.    The land that surrounds the lake of Valencia being entirely flat and  even, a diminution of a few inches in the level of the water exposes  to view a vast extent of ground covered with fertile mud and organic  remains.* (* This I observed daily in the Lake of Mexico.) In  proportion as the lake retires, cultivation advances towards the new  shore. These natural desiccations, so important to agriculture, have  been considerable during the last ten years, in which America has  suffered from great droughts. Instead of marking the sinuosities of  the present banks of the lake, I have advised the rich landholders in  these countries to fix columns of granite in the basin itself, in  order to observe from year to year the mean height of the waters. The  Marquis del Toro has undertaken to put this design into execution,  employing the fine granite of the Sierra de Mariara, and establishing  limnometers, on a bottom of gneiss rock, so common in the lake of  Valencia.    It is impossible to anticipate the limits, more or less narrow, to  which this basin of water will one day be confined, when an  equilibrium between the streams flowing in and the produce of  evaporation and filtration, shall be completely established. The idea  very generally spread, that the lake will soon entirely disappear,  seems to me chimerical. If in consequence of great earthquakes, or  other causes equally mysterious, ten very humid years should succeed  to long droughts; if the mountains should again become clothed with  forests, and great trees overshadow the shore and the plains of  Aragua, we should more probably see the volume of the waters augment,  and menace that beautiful cultivation which now trenches on the basin  of the lake.    While some of the cultivators of the valleys of Aragua fear the total  disappearance of the lake, and others its return to the banks it has  deserted, we hear the question gravely discussed at Caracas, whether  it would not be advisable, in order to give greater extent to  agriculture, to conduct the waters of the lake into the Llanos, by  digging a canal towards the Rio Pao. The possibility* of this  enterprise cannot be denied, particularly by having recourse to  tunnels, or subterranean canals. (The dividing ridge, namely, that  which divides the waters between the valleys of Aragua and the Llanos,  lowers so much towards the west of Guigue, as we have already  observed, that there are ravines which conduct the waters of the Cano  de Cambury, the Rio Valencia, and the Guataparo, in the time of  floods, to the Rio Pao; but it would be easier to open a navigable  canal from the lake of Valencia to the Orinoco, by the Pao, the  Portuguesa, and the Apure, than to dig a draining canal level with the  bottom of the lake. This bottom, according to the sounding, and my  barometric measurements, is 40 toises less than 222, or 182 above the  surface of the ocean. On the road from Guigue to the Llanos, by the  table-land of La Villa de Cura, I found, to the south of the dividing  ridge, and on its southern declivity, no point of level corresponding  to the 182 toises, except near San Juan. The absolute height of this  village is 194 toises. But, I repeat that, farther towards the west,  in the country between the Cano de Cambury and the sources of the Rio  Pao, which I was not able to visit, the point of level of the bottom  of the lake is much further north.) The progressive retreat of the  waters has given birth to the beautiful and luxuriant plains of  Maracay, Cura, Mocundo, Guigue, and Santa Cruz del Escoval, planted  with tobacco, sugar-canes, coffee, indigo, and cacao; but how can it  be doubted for a moment that the lake alone spreads fertility over  this country? If deprived of the enormous mass of vapour which the  surface of the waters sends forth daily into the atmosphere, the  valleys of Aragua would become as dry and barren as the surrounding  mountains.    The mean depth of the lake is from twelve to fifteen fathoms; the  deepest parts are not, as is generally admitted, eighty, but  thirty-five or forty deep. Such is the result of soundings made with  the greatest care by Don Antonio Manzano. When we reflect on the vast  depths of all the lakes of Switzerland, which, notwithstanding their  position in high valleys, almost reach the level of the Mediterranean,  it appears surprising that greater cavities are not found at the  bottom of the lake of Valencia, which is also an Alpine lake. The  deepest places are between the rocky island of Burro and the point of  Cana Fistula, and opposite the high mountains of Mariara. But in  general the southern part of the lake is deeper than the northern: nor  must we forget that, if all the shores be now low, the southern part  of the basin is the nearest to a chain of mountains with abrupt  declivities; and we know that even the sea is generally deepest where  the coast is elevated, rocky, or perpendicular.    The temperature of the lake at the surface during my abode in the  valleys of Aragua, in the month of February, was constantly from 23 to  23.7 degrees, consequently a little below the mean temperature of the  air. This may be from the effect of evaporation, which carries off  caloric from the air and the water; or because a great mass of water  does not follow with an equal rapidity the changes in the temperature  of the atmosphere, and the lake receives streams which rise from  several cold springs in the neighbouring mountains. I have to regret  that, notwithstanding its small depth, I could not determine the  temperature of the water at thirty or forty fathoms. I was not  provided with the thermometrical sounding apparatus which I had used  in the Alpine lakes of Salzburg, and in the Caribbean Sea. The  experiments of Saussure prove that, on both sides of the Alps, the  lakes which are from one hundred and ninety to two hundred and  seventy-four toises of absolute elevation* (* This is the difference  between the absolute elevations of the lakes of Geneva and Thun.)  have, in the middle of winter, at nine hundred, at six hundred, and  sometimes even at one hundred and fifty feet of depth, a uniform  temperature from 4.3 to 6 degrees: but these experiments have not yet  been repeated in lakes situated under the torrid zone. The strata of  cold water in Switzerland are of an enormous thickness. They have been  found so near the surface in the lakes of Geneva and Bienne, that the  decrement of heat in the water was one centesimal degree for ten or  fifteen feet; that is to say, eight times more rapid than in the  ocean, and forty-eight times more rapid than in the atmosphere. In the  temperate zone, where the heat of the atmosphere sinks to the freezing  point, and far lower, the bottom of a lake, even were it not  surrounded by glaciers and mountains covered with eternal snow, must  contain particles of water which, having during winter acquired at the  surface the maximum of their density, between 3.4 and 4.4 degrees,  have consequently fallen to the greatest depth. Other particles, the  temperature of which is +0.5 degrees, far from placing themselves  below the stratum at 4 degrees, can only find their hydrostatic  equilibrium above that stratum. They will descend lower only when  their temperature is augmented 3 or 4 degrees by the contact of strata  less cold. If water in cooling continued to condense uniformly to the  freezing point, there would be found, in very deep lakes and basins  having no communication with each other (whatever the latitude of the  place), a stratum of water, the temperature of which would be nearly  equal to the maximum of refrigeration above the freezing point, which  the lower regions of the ambient atmosphere annually attain. Hence it  is probable, that, in the plains of the torrid zone, or in the valleys  but little elevated, the mean heat of which is from 25.5 to 27"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7015"],[0,"Buddhist Psalms translated from the Japanese of Shinran Shonin (#4)"],[1,"having so received instruction revealed  unto us, who are of all evil-doers worst, the true way, the refuge  of His divine promise that absolveth all the sins of men.    78. For when the full time was come that by the will of our Lord and  of Vaidehi the teaching of the Pure Land should be made known here  on Earth, Ajata-Satru, her son, sinned this sin, Varshakara his  minister bearing testimony against it.    79. It is needful that the heart of a man be opened unto the Faith  universal which He who is Blessed hath shown us, forsaking the  belief that his own works shall save him, for in every man the power  to perform righteous deeds is differing.      CONCERNING THE LESSER SUTRA    80. The Eternal Father is called the Buddha of Infinite Light,  because very mightily He holdeth in safety all beings dwelling in  the Ten Regions of the world who, by His merciful enlightenment,  recite His Holy Name.    81. The myriad Buddhas, unnumbered as the sands of Ganges, counsel  all having life to trust in the Supernal Virtue of the Holy Name,  declaring that weighed against this even righteous deeds are the  lesser good.    82. The innumerable Buddhas, countless as the sands of Ganges, are a  testimony and a shield to all that have life in this sorrowful and  sinful world, declaring unto them that teaching most high and  difficult of acceptance, which is the true faith.    83. Whoso attaineth unto a Soul clear and enduring as diamond shall  testify unto his thankfulness for the limitless grace of the Blessed  One, for even the testimony and the safeguarding that he hath of all  the Buddhas proceed only from the fulfilment of His most merciful  promise.    84. The innumerable Buddhas, countless as the sands of Ganges, guide  into a sure trust in the Holy Name those sinful creatures and  evil-hearted that wander in the darkness of this wicked world  bearing the five signs of degeneration upon it.      OF THE MANY SUTRAS CONCERNING THE INFINITE ONE    85. Having great pity, our Eternal Father lighteneth the dark night  of ignorance, manifesting Himself in that Land of Joy as the Buddha  of Infinite Light which enlighteneth all the worlds with its  immeasurable glory.    86. That Lord most compassionate, the Buddha of immeasurable Light,  He who had attained unto the Supreme Wisdom even before the myriads  of Kalpas were, pitying them that know not, made himself manifest in  the Palace of Kapila as the Lord Sakya-muni.    87. If a man had the duration of all the myriad Kalpas, had he  innumerable tongues and each of these tongues innumerable voices,  yet should he vainly essay the praises of that Blessed One.    88. The Lord instructeth us that the way into Paradise is straight  and easy. Therefore whoso receiveth not this Truth is, in verity,  called a man that hath not eyes to see nor ears to hear.    89. The One true freedom is the Highest, and the Absolute is perfect  freedom. And when we attain unto that freedom, for us shall desire  and doubt vanish away.    90. When every man is beloved of us, even as the son of our own  body, there is the Universal Mind made perfect in us. And this shall  be in Paradise.    91. He who is in all things supreme, is Himself Nirvana, and Nirvana  is that true light that abideth in the Land that is to come, but  this world cannot know it.    92. Our Lord instructeth us that he who rejoiceth in his faith is,  in so doing, in unity with the Highest. For true faith is the seed  of light, and the seed of true light is in itself the potentiality  of that which is Deity.    93. Whoso trusteth not in the Supreme Wisdom of the Enlightened One,  clinging unto his own purblind knowledge, must suffer by fire for  long Kalpas of ages.      CONCERNING THE WELFARE OF THE PRESENT WORLD    94. He that hath unending pity, the Buddha of Infinite Life, hath  given unto us in the Sutra of Golden Light a teaching concerning  long life, that the way of long life and the welfare of the people  might be made known unto them.    95. Dengyo-Daishi, he who taught the Tendai-shu in the mount of  Hiye, hath compassionately instructed us that we should recite  Namuamida-butsu, that Holiest Name, as a sure shield against the  seven sorts of calamities.    96. Whoso reciteth the Holy Name, that is higher than all other  virtues, shall be set free from the fetters of the past, the  present, and the future.    97. To him that reciteth the Holy Name shall be good unending even  in this world, for the sin of his former births is vanquished and  his youth set free from death.    98. To him that reciteth the Holy Name, shall Brahma and Chakra the  great king bring homage, and about him shall heavenly beings and  benignant deities keep watch throughout the days and nights.    99. That man that reciteth the Holy Name shall the four mighty  Regents in Heaven guard through the days and nights against the  disturbance of all evil spirits.    100. To him that reciteth the Holy Name shall the Deity of the Earth  bring homage, watching over him throughout the day and night, as the  shadow follows its substance.    101. To him who reciteth the Holy Name, Nanda and Upananda the Naga  Kings, together with their attendant deities shall bring homage,  watching over him throughout the day and night.    102. To him who reciteth the Holy Name, the King of Death, together  with his ministers in the five worlds, shall do reverence, guarding  him throughout the days and nights.    103. Mara, the Tempter, he who is Ruler of that heaven, where  pleasures are collected, hath sworn unto the Lord to shield him from  temptation who reciteth the Holy Name.    104. All good deities in Earth and Heaven shall be gracious unto him  who reciteth the Holy Name, shielding him throughout the days and  nights.    105. All evil spirits in heaven and earth tremble before that  believer who standeth upon the Immutable promise. For even in this  world hath he the mind of Divine Illumination.    106. Kwannon and Seishi, the Bodhisattvas of incarnate Pity and  Wisdom, together with their companions, innumerable as the sands of  Ganges, shall be beside him who reciteth the Holy Name, even as the  shadow cleaves to the substance.    107. Within the Light of Buddha of Infinite Light are unnumbered  Buddhas, and of these, each and every one shall shield him who hath  within him the true Faith.    108. Whoso reciteth the Holy Name shall be surrounded himself by  those Buddhas who cannot be numbered, who in the Ten Regions with  joy protect and guide him.    Upon the Sutra of Suraigama-Samadhi, I, Shinran Shonin, have uttered  these eight lauds praising the virtue of Seishi the Bodhisattva of  Wisdom.    109. Seishi, he who is the Bodhisattva of Wisdom, having  comprehended the fullness of the Holiest Name, rising from his seat,  prostrated himself beneath the feet of our Lord, worshipping Him, he  and his fellowship, and thus he spake:    110. \"O my Lord, in the ancient time, before the Kalpas innumerable  as the sands of Ganges, there was manifest in this world a Buddha,  and His Name was called--The Buddha of Infinite Light.    111. \"In His footsteps twelve Buddhas followed, and twelve long  Kalpas have rolled away. And of these Buddhas the last was He that  is called that Buddha in whose glory the Sun and Moon are even as  darkness.    112. \"Unto me hath that Buddha revealed the Path of the meditation  of the Supreme--that meditation wherein He instructeth us that all  the Buddhas of all the Ten Regions compassionate as even as a father  pitieth his child.    113. Whoso seeketh refuge in Buddha, as a child in the bosom of his  mother shall verily perceive Him now or in the time that shall be.  And it shall be soon.    114. \"As a man encompassed by the cloud of incense casteth sweet  odours about him, so he that trusteth in the Holy Promise is  spiritually endued with the Divine Essence.    115. \"When I was initiate in right doing, I attained unto the high  way of that assurance that freed me from birth and death, through  the teaching of the Noble Doctrine of the Holy Name.    \"Therefore in this world, rejoicing, I guide the faithful believer  into the way of Purity.\"    116. Now with all praise let us give thanks unto the merciful  goodness of the Bodhisattva of Wisdom.      OF THANKSGIVING FOR NAGARJUNA, THE GREAT TEACHER OF INDIA    117. Nagarjuna, the great teacher, setting forth in many excellent  writings the praise of the Kingdom of Purity, hath instructed us to  recite the Holy Name.    118. For the Lord Buddha declared in prophecy that in India, in the  Southern Parts, should arise a great Teacher, trampling upon the  false teachings of affirmation and denial.    119. Nagarjuna, the Great Teacher, he who mightily set forth the  noble doctrine of the greater Vehicle, and himself attained unto  that height whereon a man rejoiceth eternally in the Faith, hath  very sweetly persuaded men that they should receive the teaching of  the Holy Name.    120. Nagarjuna, that great priest, setting forth the two ways--the  way that is straight and plain, and the way of high austerity,  leadeth very gently to the Ark of the Divine Promise such as are  driven through the weariness of births and deaths.    121. He who receiveth this teaching of Nagarjuna the Great Teacher,  should recite always the Holy Name, believing the Divine Promise of  the Buddha of Infinite Light.    122. Whoso would quickly attain unto that resting-place where  illusion ceaseth, should recite the Holy Name holding his mind in  steadfast piety.    123. One Ark only, that Ark of the Divine Promise of our merciful  Father, doth voyage and bear us unto the shore of the eternal  peace--even us who so long have drifted hither and thither in the  ocean of birth and death.    124. This great priest hath in one utterance set forth that the Lord  is Ruler indeed of the sacred teaching, and that herein are the holy  Bodhisattvas His ministers. Therefore should we bring homage unto  our Lord.    125. The "]]]
