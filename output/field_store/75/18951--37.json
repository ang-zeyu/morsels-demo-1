And when the morn was come, they went to the fields with their things;  and their hearts were pleased exceedingly with their task in the  beginning of their work. And it came to pass after this that as they  were in the field they stopped for corn, and he sent his younger  brother, saying, \"Haste thou, bring to us corn from the farm.\" And the  younger brother found the wife of his elder brother, as she was sitting  tiring her hair. He said to her, \"Get up, and give to me corn, that I  may run to the field, for my elder brother hastened me; do not delay.\"  She said to him, \"Go, open the bin, and thou shalt take to thyself  according to thy will, that I may not drop my locks of hair while I  dress them.\"    The youth went into the stable; he took a large measure, for he desired  to take much corn; he loaded it with wheat and barley; and he went out  carrying it. She said to him, \"How much of the corn that is wanted, is  that which is on thy shoulder?\" He said to her, \"Three bushels of  barley, and two of wheat, in all five; these are what are upon my  shoulder:\" thus said he to her.  And she conversed with him, saying,  \"There is great strength in thee, for I see thy might every day.\" And  her heart knew him with the knowledge of youth. And she arose and came  to him, and conversed with him, saying, \"Come, stay with me, and it  shall be well for thee, and I will make for thee beautiful garments.\"  Then the youth became like a panther of the south with fury at the evil  speech which she had made to him; and she feared greatly. And he spake  unto her, saying, \"Behold thou art to me as a mother, thy husband is to  me as a father, for he who is elder than I has brought me up. What is  this wickedness that thou hast said to me? Say it not to me again. For I  will not tell it to any man, for I will not let it be uttered by the  mouth of any man.\" He lifted up his burden, and he went to the field and  came to his elder brother; and they took up their work, to labour at  their task.    Now afterward, at eventime, his elder brother was returning to his  house; and the younger brother was following after his oxen, and he  loaded himself with all the things of the field; and he brought his oxen  before him, to make them lie down in their stable which was in the farm.  And behold the wife of the elder brother was afraid for the words which  she had said. She took a parcel of fat, she became like one who is  evilly beaten, desiring to say to her husband, \"It is thy younger  brother who has done this wrong.\" Her husband returned in the even, as  was his wont of every day; he came unto his house; he found his wife ill  of violence; she did not give him water upon his hands as he used to  have, she did not make a light before him, his house was in darkness,  and she was lying very sick. Her husband said to her, \"Who has spoken  with thee?\"    Behold she said, \"No one has spoken with me except thy younger brother.  When he came to take for thee corn he found me sitting alone; he said to  me, 'Come, let us stay together, tie up thy hair:' thus spake he to me.  I did not listen to him, but thus spake I to him: 'Behold, am I not thy  mother, is not thy elder brother to thee as a father?' And he feared,  and he beat me to stop me from making report to thee, and if thou  lettest him live I shall die. Now behold he is coming in the evening;  and I complain of these wicked words, for he would have done this even  in daylight.\"    And the elder brother became as a panther of the south; he sharpened his  knife; he took it in his hand; he stood behind the door of his stable to  slay his younger brother as he came in the evening to bring his cattle  into the stable.    Now the sun went down, and he loaded himself with herbs in his daily  manner. He came, and his foremost cow entered the stable, and she said  to her keeper, \"Behold thou thy elder brother standing before thee with  his knife to slay thee; flee from before him.\" He heard what his first  cow had said; and the next entering, she also said likewise. He looked  beneath the door of the stable; he saw the feet of his elder brother; he  was standing behind the door, and his knife was in his hand. He cast  down his load to the ground, and betook himself to flee swiftly; and his  elder brother pursued after him with his knife. Then the younger brother  cried out unto Ra Harakhti, saying, \"My good Lord! Thou art he who  divides the evil from the good.\" And Ra stood and heard all his cry; and  Ra made a wide water between him and his elder brother, and it was full  of crocodiles; and the one brother was on one bank, and the other on the  other bank; and the elder brother smote twice on his hands at not  slaying him. Thus did he. And the younger brother called to the elder on  the bank, saying, \"Stand still until the dawn of day; and when Ra  ariseth, I shall judge with thee before Him, and He discerneth between  the good and the evil. For I shall not be with thee any more for ever; I  shall not be in the place in which thou art; I shall go to the valley of  the acacia.\"    Now when the land was lightened, and the next day appeared, Ra Harakhti  arose, and one looked unto the other. And the youth spake with his elder  brother, saying, \"Wherefore earnest thou after me to slay me in  craftiness, when thou didst not hear the words of my mouth? For I am thy  brother in truth, and thou art to me as a father, and thy wife even as a  mother: is it not so? Verily, when I was sent to bring for us corn, thy  wife said to me, 'Come, stay with me;' for behold this has been turned  over unto thee into another wise.\" And he caused him to understand of  all that happened with him and his wife. And he swore an oath by Ra  Har-akhti, saying, \"Thy coming to slay me by deceit with thy knife was  an abomination.\" Then the youth took a knife, and cut off of his flesh,  and cast it into the water, and the fish swallowed it. He failed; he  became faint; and his elder brother cursed his own heart greatly; he  stood weeping for him afar off; he knew not how to pass over to where  his younger brother was, because of the crocodiles. And the younger  brother called unto him, saying, \"Whereas thou hast devised  an evil thing, wilt thou not also devise a good thing, even like that  which I would do unto thee? When thou goest to thy house thou must look  to thy cattle, for I shall not stay in the place where thou art; I am  going to the valley of the acacia. And now as to what thou shalt do for  me; it is even that thou shalt come to seek after me, if thou perceivest  a matter, namely, that there are things happening unto me. And this is  what shall come to pass, that I shall draw out my soul, and I shall put  it upon the top of the flowers of the acacia, and when the acacia is cut  down, and it falls to the ground, and thou comest to seek for it, if  thou searchest for it seven years do not let thy heart be wearied. For  thou wilt find it, and thou must put it in a cup of cold water, and  expect that I shall live again, that I may make answer to what has been  done wrong.. And thou shalt know of this, that is to say, that things  are happening to me, when one shall give to thee a cup of beer in thy hand,  and it shall be troubled; stay not then, for verily it shall come to  pass with thee.\"    And the youth went to the valley of the acacia; and his elder brother  went unto his house; his hand was laid on his head, and he cast dust on  his head; he came to his house, and he slew his wife, he cast her to the  dogs, and he sat in mourning for his younger brother.    Now many days after these things, the younger brother was in the valley  of the acacia; there was none with him; he spent his time in hunting the  beasts of the desert, and he came back in the even to lie down under the  acacia, which bore his soul upon the topmost flower. And after this he  built himself a tower with his own hands, in the valley of the acacia;  it was full of all good things, that he might provide for himself a home.    And he went out from his tower, and he met the Nine Gods, who were  walking forth to look upon the whole land.  The Nine Gods talked one  with another, and they said unto him, \"Ho!  Bata, bull of the Nine Gods,  art thou remaining alone? Thou hast left thy village for the wife of  Anpu, thy elder brother. Behold his wife is slain. Thou hast given him  an answer to all that was transgressed against thee.\" And their hearts  were vexed for him exceedingly. And Ra Harakhti said to Khnumu, \"Behold,  frame thou a woman for Bata, that he may not remain alive alone.\" And  Khnumu made for him a mate to dwell with him.    She was more beautiful in her limbs than any woman who is in the whole  land. The essence of every god was in her. The seven Hathors came to see  her: they said with one mouth, \"She will die a sharp death.\"    And Bata loved her very exceedingly, and she dwelt in his house; he  passed his time in hunting the beasts of the desert, and brought and  laid them before her. He said, \"Go not outside, lest the sea seize thee;  for I cannot rescue thee from it, for I am a woman like thee; my soul is  placed on the head of the flower of the acacia; and if another find it,  I must fight with him.\" And he opened unto her his heart in all its nature.    Now after these things Bata went to hunt in his daily manner. And the  young girl went to walk under the acacia which was by the side of her  house. Then the sea saw her, and cast its waves up after her. She betook  herself to flee from before it. She entered her house. And the sea  called unto the acacia, saying, \"Oh, would that I could seize her!\" And  the acacia brought a lock from her hair, and the sea carried it to  Egypt, and dropped it in the place of the fullers of Pharaoh's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7423"],[0,"Mike (#4)"],[1," Let's go  in here. It's too far to sweat to Cook's.\"    It was about a mile from the tea-shop to the school. Mike's first  impression on arriving at the school grounds was of his smallness and  insignificance. Everything looked so big--the buildings, the grounds,  everything. He felt out of the picture. He was glad that he had met  Wyatt. To make his entrance into this strange land alone would have  been more of an ordeal than he would have cared to face.    \"That's Wain's,\" said Wyatt, pointing to one of half a dozen large  houses which lined the road on the south side of the cricket field.  Mike followed his finger, and took in the size of his new home.    \"I say, it's jolly big,\" he said. \"How many fellows are there in it?\"    \"Thirty-one this term, I believe.\"    \"That's more than there were at King-Hall's.\"    \"What's King-Hall's?\"    \"The private school I was at. At Emsworth.\"    Emsworth seemed very remote and unreal to him as he spoke.    They skirted the cricket field, walking along the path that divided  the two terraces. The Wrykyn playing-fields were formed of a series of  huge steps, cut out of the hill. At the top of the hill came the  school. On the first terrace was a sort of informal practice ground,  where, though no games were played on it, there was a good deal of  punting and drop-kicking in the winter and fielding-practice in the  summer. The next terrace was the biggest of all, and formed the first  eleven cricket ground, a beautiful piece of turf, a shade too narrow  for its length, bounded on the terrace side by a sharply sloping bank,  some fifteen feet deep, and on the other by the precipice leading to  the next terrace. At the far end of the ground stood the pavilion, and  beside it a little ivy-covered rabbit-hutch for the scorers. Old  Wrykynians always claimed that it was the prettiest school ground in  England. It certainly had the finest view. From the verandah of the  pavilion you could look over three counties.    Wain's house wore an empty and desolate appearance. There were signs  of activity, however, inside; and a smell of soap and warm water told  of preparations recently completed.    Wyatt took Mike into the matron's room, a small room opening out of  the main passage.    \"This is Jackson,\" he said. \"Which dormitory is he in, Miss Payne?\"    The matron consulted a paper.    \"He's in yours, Wyatt.\"    \"Good business. Who's in the other bed? There are going to be three of  us, aren't there?\"    \"Fereira was to have slept there, but we have just heard that he is  not coming back this term. He has had to go on a sea-voyage for his  health.\"    \"Seems queer any one actually taking the trouble to keep Fereira in  the world,\" said Wyatt. \"I've often thought of giving him Rough On  Rats myself. Come along, Jackson, and I'll show you the room.\"    They went along the passage, and up a flight of stairs.    \"Here you are,\" said Wyatt.    It was a fair-sized room. The window, heavily barred, looked out over  a large garden.    \"I used to sleep here alone last term,\" said Wyatt, \"but the house is  so full now they've turned it into a dormitory.\"    \"I say, I wish these bars weren't here. It would be rather a rag to  get out of the window on to that wall at night, and hop down into the  garden and explore,\" said Mike.    Wyatt looked at him curiously, and moved to the window.    \"I'm not going to let you do it, of course,\" he said, \"because you'd  go getting caught, and dropped on, which isn't good for one in one's  first term; but just to amuse you----\"    He jerked at the middle bar, and the next moment he was standing with  it in his hand, and the way to the garden was clear.    \"By Jove!\" said Mike.    \"That's simply an object-lesson, you know,\" said Wyatt, replacing the  bar, and pushing the screws back into their putty. \"I get out at night  myself because I think my health needs it. Besides, it's my last term,  anyhow, so it doesn't matter what I do. But if I find you trying to  cut out in the small hours, there'll be trouble. See?\"    \"All right,\" said Mike, reluctantly. \"But I wish you'd let me.\"    \"Not if I know it. Promise you won't try it on.\"    \"All right. But, I say, what do you do out there?\"    \"I shoot at cats with an air-pistol, the beauty of which is that even  if you hit them it doesn't hurt--simply keeps them bright and  interested in life; and if you miss you've had all the fun anyhow.  Have you ever shot at a rocketing cat? Finest mark you can have.  Society's latest craze. Buy a pistol and see life.\"    \"I wish you'd let me come.\"    \"I daresay you do. Not much, however. Now, if you like, I'll take you  over the rest of the school. You'll have to see it sooner or later, so  you may as well get it over at once.\"          CHAPTER IV    AT THE NETS      There are few better things in life than a public school summer term.  The winter term is good, especially towards the end, and there are  points, though not many, about the Easter term: but it is in the  summer that one really appreciates public school life. The freedom of  it, after the restrictions of even the most easy-going private school,  is intoxicating. The change is almost as great as that from public  school to 'Varsity.    For Mike the path was made particularly easy. The only drawback to  going to a big school for the first time is the fact that one is made  to feel so very small and inconspicuous. New boys who have been  leading lights at their private schools feel it acutely for the first  week. At one time it was the custom, if we may believe writers of a  generation or so back, for boys to take quite an embarrassing interest  in the newcomer. He was asked a rain of questions, and was, generally,  in the very centre of the stage. Nowadays an absolute lack of interest  is the fashion. A new boy arrives, and there he is, one of a crowd.    Mike was saved this salutary treatment to a large extent, at first by  virtue of the greatness of his family, and, later, by his own  performances on the cricket field. His three elder brothers were  objects of veneration to most Wrykynians, and Mike got a certain  amount of reflected glory from them. The brother of first-class  cricketers has a dignity of his own. Then Bob was a help. He was on  the verge of the cricket team and had been the school full-back for  two seasons. Mike found that people came up and spoke to him, anxious  to know if he were Jackson's brother; and became friendly when he  replied in the affirmative. Influential relations are a help in every  stage of life.    It was Wyatt who gave him his first chance at cricket. There were nets  on the first afternoon of term for all old colours of the three teams  and a dozen or so of those most likely to fill the vacant places.  Wyatt was there, of course. He had got his first eleven cap in the  previous season as a mighty hitter and a fair slow bowler. Mike met  him crossing the field with his cricket bag.    \"Hullo, where are you off to?\" asked Wyatt. \"Coming to watch the  nets?\"    Mike had no particular programme for the afternoon. Junior cricket had  not begun, and it was a little difficult to know how to fill in the  time.    \"I tell you what,\" said Wyatt, \"nip into the house and shove on some  things, and I'll try and get Burgess to let you have a knock later  on.\"    This suited Mike admirably. A quarter of an hour later he was sitting  at the back of the first eleven net, watching the practice.    Burgess, the captain of the Wrykyn team, made no pretence of being a  bat. He was the school fast bowler and concentrated his energies on  that department of the game. He sometimes took ten minutes at the  wicket after everybody else had had an innings, but it was to bowl  that he came to the nets.    He was bowling now to one of the old colours whose name Mike did not  know. Wyatt and one of the professionals were the other two bowlers.  Two nets away Firby-Smith, who had changed his pince-nez for a pair of  huge spectacles, was performing rather ineffectively against some very  bad bowling. Mike fixed his attention on the first eleven man.    He was evidently a good bat. There was style and power in his batting.  He had a way of gliding Burgess's fastest to leg which Mike admired  greatly. He was succeeded at the end of a quarter of an hour by  another eleven man, and then Bob appeared.    It was soon made evident that this was not Bob's day. Nobody is at his  best on the first day of term; but Bob was worse than he had any right  to be. He scratched forward at nearly everything, and when Burgess,  who had been resting, took up the ball again, he had each stump  uprooted in a regular series in seven balls. Once he skied one of  Wyatt's slows over the net behind the wicket; and Mike, jumping up,  caught him neatly.    \"Thanks,\" said Bob austerely, as Mike returned the ball to him. He  seemed depressed.    Towards the end of the afternoon, Wyatt went up to Burgess.    \"Burgess,\" he said, \"see that kid sitting behind the net?\"    \"With the naked eye,\" said Burgess. \"Why?\"    \"He's just come to Wain's. He's Bob Jackson's brother, and I've a sort  of idea that he's a bit of a bat. I told him I'd ask you if he could  have a knock. Why not send him in at the end net? There's nobody there  now.\"    Burgess's amiability off the field equalled his ruthlessness when  bowling.    \"All right,\" he said. \"Only if you think that I'm going to sweat to  bowl to him, you're making a fatal error.\"    \"You needn't do a thing. Just sit and watch. I rather fancy this kid's  something special.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Mike put on Wyatt's pads and gloves, borrowed his bat, and walked  round into the net.    \"Not in a funk, are you?\" asked Wyatt, as he passed.    Mike grinned. The fact was that he had far too good an opinion of  himself to be nervous. An entirely modest person seldom makes a good  batsman. Batting is one of those things which demand first and  foremost a thorough belief in"]]]
