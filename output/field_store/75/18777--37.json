(3) \"Le Crime a Deux,\" by Scipio Sighele (translated from the Italian),  Lyons, 1893.    In the cases of Eyraud and Bompard, both man and woman are idle, vicious  criminals by instinct. They come together, lead an abandoned life,  sinking lower and lower in moral degradation. In the hour of need, crime  presents itself as a simple expedient for which neither of them has any  natural aversion. The repugnance to evil, if they ever felt it, has  long since disappeared from their natures. The man is serious, the woman  frivolous, but the criminal tendency in both cases is the same; each  performs his or her part in the crime with characteristic aptitude.  Mrs. Manning was a creature of much firmer character than her husband,  a woman of strong passions, a redoubtable murderess. Without her  dominating force Manning might never have committed murder. But he was a  criminal before the crime, more than suspected as a railway official of  complicity in a considerable train robbery; in his case the suggestion  of murder involved only the taking of a step farther in a criminal  career. Manning suffered from nerves almost as badly as Macbeth; after  the deed he sought to drown the prickings of terror and remorse by heavy  drinking Mrs. Manning was never troubled with any feelings of this kind;  after the murder of O'Connor the gratification of her sexual passion  seemed uppermost in her mind; and she met the consequences of her crime  fearlessly. Burke and Hare were a couple of ruffians, tempted by what  must have seemed almost fabulous wealth to men of their wretched  poverty to commit a series of cruel murders. Hare, with his queer,  Mephistophelian countenance, was the wickeder of the two. Burke became  haunted as time went on and flew to drink to banish horror, but Hare  would seem to have been free from such \"compunctious visitings of  Nature.\" He kept his head and turned King's evidence.    In the case of the Peltzer brothers we have a man who is of good social  position, falling desperately in love with the wife of a successful  barrister. The wife, though unhappy in her domestic life, refuses to  become her lover's mistress; marriage is the only way to secure her. So  Armand Peltzer plots to murder the husband. For this purpose he calls in  the help of a brother, a ne'er-do-well, who has left his native country  under a cloud. He sends for this dubious person to Europe, and there  between them they plan the murder of the inconvenient husband. Though  the idea of the crime comes from the one brother, the other receives the  idea without repugnance and enters wholeheartedly into the commission of  the murder. The ascendency of the one is evident, but he knows his  man, is sure that he will have no difficulty in securing the other's  co-operation in his felonious purpose. Armand Peltzer should have lived  in the Italy of the Renaissance.    The crime was cunningly devised, and methodically and successfully  accomplished. Only an over-anxiety to secure the fruits of it led to its  detection. Barre and Lebiez are a perfect criminal couple, both young  men of good education, trained to better things, but the one idle,  greedy and vicious, the other cynical, indifferent, inclined at best to  a lazy sentimentalism. Barre is a needy stockbroker at the end of his  tether, desperate to find an expedient for raising the wind, Lebiez  a medical student who writes morbid verses to a skull and lectures on  Darwinism. To Barre belongs the original suggestion to murder an old  woman who sells milk and is reputed to have savings. But his friend  and former schoolfellow, Lebiez, accepts the suggestion placidly, and  reconciles himself to the murder of an unnecessary old woman by the  same argument as that used by Raskolnikoff in \"Crime and Punishment\" to  justify the killing of his victim.    In all the cases here quoted the couples are essentially criminal  couples. From whichever of the two comes the first suggestion of crime,  it falls on soil already prepared to receive it; the response to the  suggestion is immediate. In degree of guilt there is little or nothing  to choose between them. But the more interesting instances of dual crime  are those in which one innocent hitherto of crime, to whom it is morally  repugnant, is persuaded by another to the commission of a criminal act,  as Cassius persuades Brutus; Iago, Othello. Cassius is a criminal  by instinct. Placed in a social position which removes him from the  temptation to ordinary crime, circumstances combine in his case to bring  out the criminal tendency and give it free play in the projected murder  of Caesar. Sour, envious, unscrupulous, the suggestion to kill Caesar  under the guise of the public weal is in reality a gratification  to Cassius of his own ignoble instincts, and the deliberate  unscrupulousness with which he seeks to corrupt the honourable metal,  seduce the noble mind of his friend, is typical of the man's innate  dishonesty. Cassius belongs to that particular type of the envious  nature which Shakespeare is fond of exemplifying with more or less  degree of villainy in such characters as Iago, Edmund, and Don John,  of which Robert Butler, whose career is given in this book, is a living  instance. Cassius on public grounds tempts Brutus to crime as subtly as  on private grounds Iago tempts Othello, and with something of the same  malicious satisfaction; the soliloquy of Cassius at the end of the  second scene of the first act is that of a bad man and a false friend.  Indeed, the quarrel between Brutus and Cassius after the murder of  Caesar loses much of its sincerity and pathos unless we can forget for  the moment the real character of Cassius. But the interest in the cases  of Cassius and Brutus, Iago and Othello, lies not so much in the  nature of the prompter of the crime. The instances in which an honest,  honourable man is by force of another's suggestion converted into a  criminal are psychologically remarkable. It is to be expected that we  should look in the annals of real crime for confirmation of the truth to  life of stories such as these, told in fiction or drama.    The strongest influence, under which the naturally non-criminal person  may be tempted in violation of instinct and better nature to the  commission of a crime, is that of love or passion. Examples of this kind  are frequent in the annals of crime. There is none more striking than  that of the Widow Gras and Natalis Gaudry. Here a man, brave, honest, of  hitherto irreproachable character, is tempted by a woman to commit the  most cruel and infamous of crimes. At first he repels the suggestion;  at last, when his senses have been excited, his passion inflamed by the  cunning of the woman, as the jealous passion of Othello is played on and  excited by Iago, the patriotism of Brutus artfully exploited by Cassius,  he yields to the repeated solicitation and does a deed in every way  repugnant to his normal character. Nothing seems so blinding in its  effect on the moral sense as passion. It obscures all sense of humour,  proportion, congruity; the murder of the man or woman who stands in  the way of its full enjoyment becomes an act of inverted justice to  the perpetrators; they reconcile themselves to it by the most perverse  reasoning until they come to regard it as an act, in which they may  justifiably invoke the help of God; eroticism and religion are often  jumbled up together in this strange medley of conflicting emotions.    A woman, urging her lover to the murder of her husband, writes of the  roses that are to deck the path of the lovers as soon as the crime is  accomplished; she sends him flowers and in the same letter asks if he  has got the necessary cartridges. Her husband has been ill; she hopes  that it is God helping them to the desired end; she burns a candle  on the altar of a saint for the success of their murderous plan.(4) A  jealous husband setting out to kill his wife carries in his pockets,  beside a knife and a service revolver, a rosary, a medal of the Virgin  and a holy image.(5) Marie Boyer in the blindness of her passion and  jealousy believes God to be helping her to get rid of her mother.           (4) Case of Garnier and the woman Aveline, 1884.         (5) Case of the Comte  de Cornulier: \"Un An de Justice,\" Henri Varennes, 1901.      A lover persuades the wife to get rid of her husband. For a whole year  he instils the poison into her soul until she can struggle no longer  against the obsession; he offers to do the deed, but she writes that she  would rather suffer all the risks and consequences herself. \"How many  times,\" she writes, \"have I wished to go away, leave home, but it meant  leaving my children, losing them for ever.. that made my lover jealous,  he believed that I could not bring myself to leave my husband. But if my  husband were out of the way then I would keep my children, and my  lover would see in my crime a striking proof of my devotion.\" A curious  farrago of slavish passion, motherly love and murder.(6)           (6) Case of Madame Weiss and the engineer Roques. If I may be permitted  the reference, there is an account of this case and that of Barre and  Lebiez in my book \"French Criminals of the Nineteenth Century.\"      There are some women such as Marie Boyer and Gabrielle Fenayrou, who may  be described as passively criminal, chameleon-like, taking colour from  their surroundings. By the force of a man's influence they commit a  dreadful crime, in the one instance it is matricide, in the other the  murder of a former lover, but neither of the women is profoundly vicious  or criminal in her instincts. In prison they become exemplary, their  crime a thing of the past.    Gabrielle Fenayrou during her imprisonment, having won the confidence  of the religious sisters in charge of the convicts, is appointed head  of one of the workshops. Marie Boyer is so contrite,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/448"],[0,"The Psychology of Revolution (#4)"],[1,"lace, that such movements are never  spontaneous, and secondly, that reason takes no part in their  elaboration.    The force of the political and religious beliefs which have moved  the world resides precisely in the fact that, being born of  affective and mystic elements, they are neither created nor  directed by reason.    Political or religious beliefs have a common origin and obey the  same laws.  They are formed not with the aid of reason, but more  often contrary to all reason.  Buddhism, Islamism, the  Reformation, Jacobinism, Socialism, &c., seem very different  forms of thought.  Yet they have identical affective and mystic  bases, and obey a logic that has no affinity with rational logic.    Political revolutions may result from beliefs established in the  minds of men, but many other causes produce them.  The word  discontent sums them up.  As soon as discontent is generalised a  party is formed which often becomes strong enough to struggle  against the Government.    Discontent must generally have been accumulating for a long time  in order to produce its effects.  For this reason a revolution  does not always represent a phenomenon in process of termination  followed by another which is commencing but rather a continuous  phenomenon, having somewhat accelerated its evolution.  All the  modern revolutions, however, have been abrupt movements,  entailing the instantaneous overthrow of governments.  Such, for  example, were the Brazilian, Portuguese, Turkish, and Chinese  revolutions.    To the contrary of what might be supposed, the very conservative  peoples are addicted to the most violent revolutions.  Being  conservative, they are not able to evolve slowly, or to adapt  themselves to variations of environment, so that when the  discrepancy becomes too extreme they are bound to adapt  themselves suddenly.  This sudden evolution constitutes a  revolution.    Peoples able to adapt themselves progressively do not always  escape revolution.  It was only by means of a revolution that the  English, in 1688, were able to terminate the struggle which had  dragged on for a century between the monarchy, which sought to  make itself absolute, and the nation, which claimed the right to  govern itself through the medium of its representatives.    The great revolutions have usually commenced from the top, not  from the bottom; but once the people is unchained it is to the  people that revolution owes its might.    It is obvious that revolutions have never taken place, and will  never take place, save with the aid of an important fraction of  the army.  Royalty did not disappear in France on the day when  Louis XVI. was guillotined, but at the precise moment when his  mutinous troops refused to defend him.    It is more particularly by mental contagion that armies become  disaffected, being indifferent enough at heart to the established  order of things.  As soon as the coalition of a few officers had  succeeded in overthrowing the Turkish Government the Greek  officers thought to imitate them and to change their government,  although there was no analogy between the two regimes.    A military movement may overthrow a government--and in the  Spanish republics the Government is hardly ever destroyed by any  other means--but if the revolution is to be productive of great  results it must always be based upon general discontent and  general hopes.    Unless it is universal and excessive, discontent alone is not  sufficient to bring about a revolution.  It is easy to lead a  handful of men to pillage, destroy, and massacre, but to raise a  whole people, or any great portion of that people, calls for the  continuous or repeated action of leaders.  These exaggerate the  discontent; they persuade the discontented that the government is  the sole cause of all the trouble, especially of the prevailing  dearth, and assure men that the new system proposed by them will  engender an age of felicity.  These ideas germinate, propagating  themselves by suggestion and contagion, and the moment arrives  when the revolution is ripe.    In this fashion the Christian Revolution and the French  Revolution were prepared.  That the latter was effected in a few  years, while the first required many, was due to the fact that  the French Revolution promptly had an armed force at its  disposal, while Christianity was long in winning material power.  In the beginning its only adepts were the lowly, the poor, and  the slaves, filled with enthusiasm by the prospect of seeing  their miserable life transformed into an eternity of delight.  By  a phenomenon of contagion from below, of which history affords us  more than one example, the doctrine finally invaded the upper  strata of the nation, but it was a long time before an  emperor considered the new faith sufficiently widespread to be  adopted as the official religion.      4.  The Results of Political Revolutions.      When a political party is triumphant it naturally seeks to  organise society in accordance with its interests.  The  organisation will differ accordingly as the revolution has been  effected by the soldiers, the Radicals, or the Conservatives, &c.    The new laws and institutions will depend on the interests of the  triumphant party and of the classes which have assisted it--the  clergy for instance.    If the revolution has triumphed only after a violent struggle, as  was the case with the French Revolution, the victors will reject  at one sweep the whole arsenal of the old law.  The supporters of  the fallen regime will be persecuted, exiled, or exterminated.    The maximum of violence in these persecutions is attained when  the triumphant party is defending a belief in addition to its  material interests.  Then the conquered need hope for no pity.  Thus may be explained the expulsion of the Moors from Spain, the  autodafes of the Inquisition, the executions of the  Convention, and the recent laws against the religious  congregations in France.    The absolute power which is assumed by the victors leads them  sometimes to extreme measures, such as the Convention's decree  that gold was to be replaced by paper, that goods were to be sold  at determined prices, &c.  Very soon it runs up against a wall of  unavoidable necessities, which turn opinion against its tyranny,  and finally leave it defenceless before attack, as befell at the  end of the French Revolution.  The same thing happened  recently to a Socialist Australian ministry composed almost  exclusively of working-men.  It enacted laws so absurd, and  accorded such privileges to the trade unions, that public opinion  rebelled against it so unanimously that in three months it was  overthrown.    But the cases we have considered are exceptional.  The majority  of revolutions have been accomplished in order to place a new  sovereign in power.  Now this sovereign knows very well that the  first condition of maintaining his power consists in not too  exclusively favouring a single class, but in seeking to  conciliate all.  To do this he will establish a sort of  equilibrium between them, so as not to be dominated by any one of  these classes.  To allow one class to become predominant is to  condemn himself presently to accept that class as his master.  This law is one of the most certain of political psychology.  The  kings of France understood it very well when they struggled so  energetically against the encroachments first of the nobility and  then of the clergy.  If they had not done so their fate would  have been that of the German Emperors of the Middle Ages, who,  excommunicated by the Pope, were reduced, like Henry IV. at  Canossa, to make a pilgrimage and humbly to sue for the Pope's  forgiveness.    This same law has continually been verified during the course of  history.  When at the end of the Roman Empire the military caste  became preponderant, the emperors depended entirely upon their  soldiers, who appointed and deposed them at will.    It was therefore a great advantage for France that she was so  long governed by a monarch almost absolute, supposed to  hold his power by divine right, and surrounded therefore by a  considerable prestige.  Without such an authority he could have  controlled neither the feudal nobility, nor the clergy, nor the  parliaments.  If Poland, towards the end of the sixteenth  century, had also possessed an absolute and respected monarchy,  she would not have descended the path of decadence which led to  her disappearance from the map of Europe.    We have shewn in this chapter that political revolutions may be  accompanied by important social transformations.  We shall soon  see how slight are these transformations compared to those  produced by religious revolutions.        CHAPTER II    RELIGIOUS REVOLUTIONS    1.  The importance of the study of Religious Revolutions in  respect of the comprehension of the great Political Revolutions.      A portion of this work will be devoted to the French Revolution.  It was full of acts of violence which naturally had their  psychological causes.    These exceptional events will always fill us with astonishment,  and we even feel them to be inexplicable.  They become  comprehensible, however, if we consider that the French  Revolution, constituting a new religion, was bound to obey the  laws which condition the propagation of all beliefs.  Its fury  and its hecatombs will then become intelligible.    In studying the history of a great religious revolution, that of  the Reformation, we shall see that a number of psychological  elements which figured therein were equally active during the  French Revolution.  In both we observe the insignificant bearing  of the rational value of a belief upon its propagation, the  inefficacy of persecution, the impossibility of tolerance between  contrary beliefs, and the violence and the desperate struggles  resulting from the conflict of different faiths.  We also observe  the exploitation of a belief by "]]]
