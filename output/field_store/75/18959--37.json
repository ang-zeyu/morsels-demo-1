The tops of the mountains  which used to be covered with grass now lay deeply hidden underneath a  heavy burden of snow.    Then, one morning, a number of wild people, different from the other  creatures who lived in that neighbourhood, came wandering down from the  region of the high peaks. They looked lean and appeared to be starving.  They uttered sounds which no one could understand. They seemed to  say that they were hungry. There was not food enough for both the old  inhabitants and the newcomers. When they tried to stay more than a few  days there was a terrible battle with claw-like hands and feet and whole  families were killed. The others fled back to their mountain slopes and  died in the next blizzard.    But the people in the forest were greatly frightened. All the time the  days grew shorter and the nights grew colder than they ought to have  been.    Finally, in a gap between two high hills, there appeared a tiny speck  of greenish ice. Rapidly it increased in size. A gigantic glacier came  sliding downhill. Huge stones were being pushed into the valley. With  the noise of a dozen thunderstorms torrents of ice and mud and blocks of  granite suddenly tumbled among the people of the forest and killed them  while they slept. Century old trees were crushed into kindling wood. And  then it began to snow.    It snowed for months and months. All the plants died and the animals  fled in search of the southern sun. Man hoisted his young upon his  back and followed them. But he could not travel as fast as the wilder  creatures and he was forced to choose between quick thinking or quick  dying. He seems to have preferred the former for he has managed to  survive the terrible glacial periods which upon four different occasions  threatened to kill every human being on the face of the earth.    In the first place it was necessary that man clothe himself lest  he freeze to death. He learned how to dig holes and cover them with  branches and leaves and in these traps he caught bears and hyenas, which  he then killed with heavy stones and whose skins he used as coats for  himself and his family.    Next came the housing problem. This was simple. Many animals were in the  habit of sleeping in dark caves. Man now followed their example, drove  the animals out of their warm homes and claimed them for his own.    Even so, the climate was too severe for most people and the old and the  young died at a terrible rate. Then a genius bethought himself of  the use of fire. Once, while out hunting, he had been caught in a  forest-fire. He remembered that he had been almost roasted to death by  the flames. Thus far fire had been an enemy. Now it became a friend. A  dead tree was dragged into the cave and lighted by means of smouldering  branches from a burning wood. This turned the cave into a cozy little  room.    And then one evening a dead chicken fell into the fire. It was not  rescued until it had been well roasted. Man discovered that meat tasted  better when cooked and he then and there discarded one of the old habits  which he had shared with the other animals and began to prepare his  food.    In this way thousands of years passed. Only the people with the  cleverest brains survived. They had to struggle day and night against  cold and hunger. They were forced to invent tools. They learned how to  sharpen stones into axes and how to make hammers. They were obliged to  put up large stores of food for the endless days of the winter and they  found that clay could be made into bowls and jars and hardened in the  rays of the sun. And so the glacial period, which had threatened to  destroy the human race, became its greatest teacher because it forced  man to use his brain.          HIEROGLYPHICS    THE EGYPTIANS INVENT THE ART OF WRITING AND THE RECORD OF HISTORY BEGINS      THESE earliest ancestors of ours who lived in the great European  wilderness were rapidly learning many new things. It is safe to say that  in due course of time they would have given up the ways of savages and  would have developed a civilisation of their own. But suddenly there  came an end to their isolation. They were discovered.    A traveller from an unknown southland who had dared to cross the sea  and the high mountain passes had found his way to the wild people of the  European continent. He came from Africa. His home was in Egypt.    The valley of the Nile had developed a high stage of civilisation  thousands of years before the people of the west had dreamed of the  possibilities of a fork or a wheel or a house. And we shall therefore  leave our great-great-grandfathers in their caves, while we visit  the southern and eastern shores of the Mediterranean, where stood the  earliest school of the human race.    The Egyptians have taught us many things. They were excellent farmers.  They knew all about irrigation. They built temples which were afterwards  copied by the Greeks and which served as the earliest models for the  churches in which we worship nowadays. They had invented a calendar  which proved such a useful instrument for the purpose of measuring time  that it has survived with a few changes until today. But most important  of all, the Egyptians had learned how to preserve speech for the benefit  of future generations. They had invented the art of writing.    We are so accustomed to newspapers and books and magazines that we take  it for granted that the world has always been able to read and write.  As a matter of fact, writing, the most important of all inventions, is  quite new. Without written documents we would be like cats and dogs, who  can only teach their kittens and their puppies a few simple things and  who, because they cannot write, possess no way in which they can make  use of the experience of those generations of cats and dogs that have  gone before.    In the first century before our era, when the Romans came to Egypt, they  found the valley full of strange little pictures which seemed to have  something to do with the history of the country. But the Romans were not  interested in \"anything foreign\" and did not inquire into the origin of  these queer figures which covered the walls of the temples and the walls  of the palaces and endless reams of flat sheets made out of the papyrus  reed. The last of the Egyptian priests who had understood the holy art  of making such pictures had died several years before. Egypt deprived  of its independence had become a store-house filled with important  historical documents which no one could decipher and which were of no  earthly use to either man or beast.    Seventeen centuries went by and Egypt remained a land of mystery. But  in the year 1798 a French general by the name of Bonaparte happened to  visit eastern Africa to prepare for an attack upon the British Indian  Colonies. He did not get beyond the Nile, and his campaign was a  failure. But, quite accidentally, the famous French expedition solved  the problem of the ancient Egyptian picture-language.    One day a young French officer, much bored by the dreary life of his  little fortress on the Rosetta river (a mouth of the Nile) decided to  spend a few idle hours rummaging among the ruins of the Nile Delta. And  behold! he found a stone which greatly puzzled him. Like everything else  in Egypt it was covered with little figures. But this particular slab of  black basalt was different from anything that had ever been discovered.  It carried three inscriptions. One of these was in Greek. The Greek  language was known. \"All that is necessary,\" so he reasoned, \"is to  compare the Greek text with the Egyptian figures, and they will at once  tell their secrets.\"    The plan sounded simple enough but it took more than twenty years to  solve the riddle. In the year 1802 a French professor by the name of  Champollion began to compare the Greek and the Egyptian texts of  the famous Rosetta stone. In the year 1823 he announced that he had  discovered the meaning of fourteen little figures. A short time later  he died from overwork, but the main principles of Egyptian writing had  become known. Today the story of the valley of the Nile is better known  to us than the story of the Mississippi River. We possess a written  record which covers four thousand years of chronicled history.    As the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics (the word means \"sacred writing\")  have played such a very great role in history, (a few of them in  modified form have even found their way into our own alphabet,) you  ought to know something about the ingenious system which was used fifty  centuries ago to preserve the spoken word for the benefit of the coming  generations.    Of course, you know what a sign language is. Every Indian story of our  western plains has a chapter devoted to strange messages writter{sic}  in the form of little pictures which tell how many buffaloes were killed  and how many hunters there were in a certain party. As a rule it is not  difficult to understand the meaning of such messages.    Ancient Egyptian, however, was not a sign language. The clever people of  the Nile had passed beyond that stage long before. Their pictures meant  a great deal more than the object which they represented, as I shall try  to explain to you now.    Suppose that you were Champollion, and that you were examining a stack  of papyrus sheets, all covered with hieroglyphics. Suddenly you came  across a picture of a man with a saw. \"Very well,\" you would say, \"that  means of course that a farmer went out to cut down a tree.\" Then you  take another papyrus. It tells the story of a queen who had died at the  age of eighty-two. In the midst of a sentence appears the picture of the  man with the saw. Queens of eighty-two do not handle saws. The picture  therefore must mean something else. But what?    That is the riddle which the Frenchman finally solved. He discovered  that the Egyptians were the first to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/766"],[0,"David Copperfield (#4)"],[1,"r. Chillip, as soon as he had courage, 'I am  happy to congratulate you. All is now over, ma'am, and well over.'    During the five minutes or so that Mr. Chillip devoted to the delivery  of this oration, my aunt eyed him narrowly.    'How is she?' said my aunt, folding her arms with her bonnet still tied  on one of them.    'Well, ma'am, she will soon be quite comfortable, I hope,' returned Mr.  Chillip. 'Quite as comfortable as we can expect a young mother to be,  under these melancholy domestic circumstances. There cannot be any  objection to your seeing her presently, ma'am. It may do her good.'    'And SHE. How is SHE?' said my aunt, sharply.    Mr. Chillip laid his head a little more on one side, and looked at my  aunt like an amiable bird.    'The baby,' said my aunt. 'How is she?'    'Ma'am,' returned Mr. Chillip, 'I apprehended you had known. It's a  boy.'    My aunt said never a word, but took her bonnet by the strings, in the  manner of a sling, aimed a blow at Mr. Chillip's head with it, put it on  bent, walked out, and never came back. She vanished like a discontented  fairy; or like one of those supernatural beings, whom it was popularly  supposed I was entitled to see; and never came back any more.    No. I lay in my basket, and my mother lay in her bed; but Betsey  Trotwood Copperfield was for ever in the land of dreams and shadows, the  tremendous region whence I had so lately travelled; and the light upon  the window of our room shone out upon the earthly bourne of all such  travellers, and the mound above the ashes and the dust that once was he,  without whom I had never been.        CHAPTER 2. I OBSERVE      The first objects that assume a distinct presence before me, as I look  far back, into the blank of my infancy, are my mother with her pretty  hair and youthful shape, and Peggotty with no shape at all, and eyes so  dark that they seemed to darken their whole neighbourhood in her face,  and cheeks and arms so hard and red that I wondered the birds didn't  peck her in preference to apples.    I believe I can remember these two at a little distance apart, dwarfed  to my sight by stooping down or kneeling on the floor, and I going  unsteadily from the one to the other. I have an impression on my mind  which I cannot distinguish from actual remembrance, of the touch of  Peggotty's forefinger as she used to hold it out to me, and of its being  roughened by needlework, like a pocket nutmeg-grater.    This may be fancy, though I think the memory of most of us can go  farther back into such times than many of us suppose; just as I believe  the power of observation in numbers of very young children to be quite  wonderful for its closeness and accuracy. Indeed, I think that most  grown men who are remarkable in this respect, may with greater propriety  be said not to have lost the faculty, than to have acquired it; the  rather, as I generally observe such men to retain a certain freshness,  and gentleness, and capacity of being pleased, which are also an  inheritance they have preserved from their childhood.    I might have a misgiving that I am 'meandering' in stopping to say this,  but that it brings me to remark that I build these conclusions, in part  upon my own experience of myself; and if it should appear from  anything I may set down in this narrative that I was a child of close  observation, or that as a man I have a strong memory of my childhood, I  undoubtedly lay claim to both of these characteristics.    Looking back, as I was saying, into the blank of my infancy, the first  objects I can remember as standing out by themselves from a confusion of  things, are my mother and Peggotty. What else do I remember? Let me see.      There comes out of the cloud, our house--not new to me, but quite  familiar, in its earliest remembrance. On the ground-floor is Peggotty's  kitchen, opening into a back yard; with a pigeon-house on a pole, in  the centre, without any pigeons in it; a great dog-kennel in a corner,  without any dog; and a quantity of fowls that look terribly tall to me,  walking about, in a menacing and ferocious manner. There is one cock who  gets upon a post to crow, and seems to take particular notice of me as  I look at him through the kitchen window, who makes me shiver, he is so  fierce. Of the geese outside the side-gate who come waddling after  me with their long necks stretched out when I go that way, I dream at  night: as a man environed by wild beasts might dream of lions.    Here is a long passage--what an enormous perspective I make of  it!--leading from Peggotty's kitchen to the front door. A dark  store-room opens out of it, and that is a place to be run past at  night; for I don't know what may be among those tubs and jars and old  tea-chests, when there is nobody in there with a dimly-burning light,  letting a mouldy air come out of the door, in which there is the smell  of soap, pickles, pepper, candles, and coffee, all at one whiff. Then  there are the two parlours: the parlour in which we sit of an evening,  my mother and I and Peggotty--for Peggotty is quite our companion, when  her work is done and we are alone--and the best parlour where we sit  on a Sunday; grandly, but not so comfortably. There is something of a  doleful air about that room to me, for Peggotty has told me--I don't  know when, but apparently ages ago--about my father's funeral, and the  company having their black cloaks put on. One Sunday night my mother  reads to Peggotty and me in there, how Lazarus was raised up from the  dead. And I am so frightened that they are afterwards obliged to take me  out of bed, and show me the quiet churchyard out of the bedroom window,  with the dead all lying in their graves at rest, below the solemn moon.    There is nothing half so green that I know anywhere, as the grass of  that churchyard; nothing half so shady as its trees; nothing half so  quiet as its tombstones. The sheep are feeding there, when I kneel up,  early in the morning, in my little bed in a closet within my mother's  room, to look out at it; and I see the red light shining on the  sun-dial, and think within myself, 'Is the sun-dial glad, I wonder, that  it can tell the time again?'    Here is our pew in the church. What a high-backed pew! With a window  near it, out of which our house can be seen, and IS seen many times  during the morning's service, by Peggotty, who likes to make herself  as sure as she can that it's not being robbed, or is not in flames. But  though Peggotty's eye wanders, she is much offended if mine does,  and frowns to me, as I stand upon the seat, that I am to look at the  clergyman. But I can't always look at him--I know him without that white  thing on, and I am afraid of his wondering why I stare so, and perhaps  stopping the service to inquire--and what am I to do? It's a dreadful  thing to gape, but I must do something. I look at my mother, but she  pretends not to see me. I look at a boy in the aisle, and he makes faces  at me. I look at the sunlight coming in at the open door through  the porch, and there I see a stray sheep--I don't mean a sinner, but  mutton--half making up his mind to come into the church. I feel that  if I looked at him any longer, I might be tempted to say something out  loud; and what would become of me then! I look up at the monumental  tablets on the wall, and try to think of Mr. Bodgers late of this  parish, and what the feelings of Mrs. Bodgers must have been, when  affliction sore, long time Mr. Bodgers bore, and physicians were in  vain. I wonder whether they called in Mr. Chillip, and he was in vain;  and if so, how he likes to be reminded of it once a week. I look from  Mr. Chillip, in his Sunday neckcloth, to the pulpit; and think what a  good place it would be to play in, and what a castle it would make, with  another boy coming up the stairs to attack it, and having the velvet  cushion with the tassels thrown down on his head. In time my eyes  gradually shut up; and, from seeming to hear the clergyman singing a  drowsy song in the heat, I hear nothing, until I fall off the seat with  a crash, and am taken out, more dead than alive, by Peggotty.    And now I see the outside of our house, with the latticed  bedroom-windows standing open to let in the sweet-smelling air, and the  ragged old rooks'-nests still dangling in the elm-trees at the bottom  of the front garden. Now I am in the garden at the back, beyond the  yard where the empty pigeon-house and dog-kennel are--a very preserve  of butterflies, as I remember it, with a high fence, and a gate and  padlock; where the fruit clusters on the trees, riper and richer than  fruit has ever been since, in any other garden, and where my  mother gathers some in a basket, while I stand by, bolting furtive  gooseberries, and trying to look unmoved. A great wind rises, and the  summer is gone in a moment. We are playing in the winter twilight,  dancing about the parlour. When my mother is out of breath and rests  herself in an elbow-chair, I watch her winding her bright curls round  her fingers, and straitening her waist, and nobody knows better than I  do that she likes to look so well, and is proud of being so pretty.    That is among my very earliest impressions. That, and a sense that we  were both a little afraid of Peggotty, and submitted ourselves in most  things to her direction, were among the first opinions--if they may be  so called--that I ever derived from what I saw.    Peggotty and I were sitting one night by the parlour fire, alone. I  had been reading to Peggotty about crocodiles. I must have read very  perspicuously, or the poor soul must have been deeply interested, for I  remember she had a cloudy impression, after I had done, that they were  a sort of vegetable. I was tired of reading, and dead sleepy; but  having leave, as a high treat, to sit up until my mother came home from  spending the evening at a neighbour's, I would rather have died upon  my post (of"]]]
