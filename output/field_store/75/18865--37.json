At last, his distant Huron fires aflame  We saw, and nearer, nearer still we came.    I, bound behind him in the captive's place,  Scarcely could see the outline of his face.  I smiled, and laid my cheek against his back:  \"Loose thou my hands,\" I said. \"This pace let slack.  Forget we now that thou and I are foes.  I like thee well, and wish to clasp thee close;  I like the courage of thine eye and brow;  I like thee better than my Mohawk now.\"    He cut the cords; we ceased our maddened haste  I wound my arms about his tawny waist;  My hand crept up the buckskin of his belt;  His knife hilt in my burning palm I felt;  One hand caressed his cheek, the other drew  The weapon softly--\"I love you, love you,\"  I whispered, \"love you as my life.\"  And--buried in his back his scalping knife.    Ha! how I rode, rode as a sea wind-chased,  Mad with sudden freedom, mad with haste,  Back to my Mohawk and my home. I lashed  That horse to foam, as on and on I dashed.  Plunging thro' creek and river, bush and trail,  On, on I galloped like a northern gale.  And then my distant Mohawk's fires aflame  I saw, as nearer, nearer still I came,  My hands all wet, stained with a life's red dye,  But pure my soul, pure as those stars on high--  \"My Mohawk's pure white star, Ojistoh, still am I.\"        [1] God, in the Mohawk language.        AS RED MEN DIE      Captive! Is there a hell to him like this?  A taunt more galling than the Huron's hiss?  He--proud and scornful, he--who laughed at law,  He--scion of the deadly Iroquois,  He--the bloodthirsty, he--the Mohawk chief,  He--who despises pain and sneers at grief,  Here in the hated Huron's vicious clutch,  That even captive he disdains to touch!    Captive! But _never_ conquered; Mohawk brave  Stoops not to be to _any_ man a slave;  Least, to the puny tribe his soul abhors,  The tribe whose wigwams sprinkle Simcoe's shores.  With scowling brow he stands and courage high,  Watching with haughty and defiant eye  His captors, as they council o'er his fate,  Or strive his boldness to intimidate.  Then fling they unto him the choice;                                    \"Wilt thou  Walk o'er the bed of fire that waits thee now--  Walk with uncovered feet upon the coals,  Until thou reach the ghostly Land of Souls,  And, with thy Mohawk death-song please our ear?  Or wilt thou with the women rest thee here?\"  His eyes flash like an eagle's, and his hands  Clench at the insult. Like a god he stands.  \"Prepare the fire!\" he scornfully demands.    He knoweth not that this same jeering band  Will bite the dust--will lick the Mohawk's hand;  Will kneel and cower at the Mohawk's feet;  Will shrink when Mohawk war drums wildly beat.    His death will be avenged with hideous hate  By Iroquois, swift to annihilate  His vile detested captors, that now flaunt  Their war clubs in his face with sneer and taunt,  Not thinking, soon that reeking, red, and raw,  Their scalps will deck the belts of Iroquois.    The path of coals outstretches, white with heat,  A forest fir's length--ready for his feet.  Unflinching as a rock he steps along  The burning mass, and sings his wild war song;  Sings, as he sang when once he used to roam  Throughout the forests of his southern home,  Where, down the Genesee, the water roars,  Where gentle Mohawk purls between its shores,  Songs, that of exploit and of prowess tell;  Songs of the Iroquois invincible.    Up the long trail of fire he boasting goes,  Dancing a war dance to defy his foes.  His flesh is scorched, his muscles burn and shrink,  But still he dances to death's awful brink.    The eagle plume that crests his haughty head  Will _never_ droop until his heart be dead.  Slower and slower yet his footstep swings,  Wilder and wilder still his death-song rings,  Fiercer and fiercer thro' the forest bounds  His voice that leaps to Happier Hunting Grounds.  One savage yell--                          Then loyal to his race,  He bends to death--but _never_ to disgrace.        THE PILOT OF THE PLAINS      \"False,\" they said, \"thy Pale-face lover, from the land of waking morn;  Rise and wed thy Redskin wooer, nobler warrior ne'er was born;  Cease thy watching, cease thy dreaming,      Show the white thine Indian scorn.\"    Thus they taunted her, declaring, \"He remembers naught of thee:  Likely some white maid he wooeth, far beyond the inland sea.\"  But she answered ever kindly,      \"He will come again to me,\"    Till the dusk of Indian summer crept athwart the western skies;  But a deeper dusk was burning in her dark and dreaming eyes,  As she scanned the rolling prairie,      Where the foothills fall, and rise.    Till the autumn came and vanished, till the season of the rains,  Till the western world lay fettered in midwinter's crystal chains,  Still she listened for his coming,      Still she watched the distant plains.    Then a night with nor'land tempest, nor'land snows a-swirling fast,  Out upon the pathless prairie came the Pale-face through the blast,  Calling, calling, \"Yakonwita,      I am coming, love, at last.\"    Hovered night above, about him, dark its wings and cold and dread;  Never unto trail or tepee were his straying footsteps led;  Till benumbed, he sank, and pillowed      On the drifting snows his head,    Saying, \"O! my Yakonwita call me, call me, be my guide  To the lodge beyond the prairie--for I vowed ere winter died  I would come again, beloved;      I would claim my Indian bride.\"    \"Yakonwita, Yakonwita!\" Oh, the dreariness that strains  Through the voice that calling, quivers, till a whisper but remains,  \"Yakonwita, Yakonwita,      I am lost upon the plains.\"    But the Silent Spirit hushed him, lulled him as he cried anew,  \"Save me, save me! O! beloved, I am Pale but I am true.  Yakonwita, Yakonwita,      I am dying, love, for you.\"    Leagues afar, across the prairie, she had risen from her bed,  Roused her kinsmen from their slumber: \"He has come to-night,\" she said.  \"I can hear him calling, calling;      But his voice is as the dead.    \"Listen!\" and they sate all silent, while the tempest louder grew,  And a spirit-voice called faintly, \"I am dying, love, for you.\"  Then they wailed, \"O! Yakonwita.      He was Pale, but he was true.\"    Wrapped she then her ermine round her, stepped without the tepee door,  Saying, \"I must follow, follow, though he call for evermore,  Yakonwita, Yakonwita;\"      And they never saw her more.    Late at night, say Indian hunters, when the starlight clouds or wanes,  Far away they see a maiden, misty as the autumn rains,  Guiding with her lamp of moonlight      Hunters lost upon the plains.        THE CATTLE THIEF      They were coming across the prairie, they were      galloping hard and fast;  For the eyes of those desperate riders had sighted      their man at last--  Sighted him off to Eastward, where the Cree      encampment lay,  Where the cotton woods fringed the river, miles and      miles away.  Mistake him? Never! Mistake him? the famous      Eagle Chief!  That terror to all the settlers, that desperate Cattle      Thief--  That monstrous, fearless Indian, who lorded it over      the plain,  Who thieved and raided, and scouted, who rode like      a hurricane!  But they've tracked him across the prairie; they've      followed him hard and fast;  For those desperate English settlers have sighted      their man at last.    Up they wheeled to the tepees, all their British      blood aflame,  Bent on bullets and bloodshed, bent on bringing      down their game;  But they searched in vain for the Cattle Thief: that      lion had left his lair,  And they cursed like a troop of demons--for the      women alone were there.  \"The sneaking Indian coward,\" they hissed; \"he      hides while yet he can;  He'll come in the night for cattle, but he's scared      to face a _man_.\"  \"Never!\" and up from the cotton woods rang the      voice of Eagle Chief;  And right out into the open stepped, unarmed, the      Cattle Thief.  Was that the game they had coveted? Scarce fifty      years had rolled  Over that fleshless, hungry frame, starved to the      bone and old;  Over that wrinkled, tawny skin, unfed by the      warmth of blood.  Over those hungry, hollow eyes that glared for the      sight of food.    He turned, like a hunted lion: \"I know not fear,\"      said he;  And the words outleapt from his shrunken lips in      the language of the Cree.  \"I'll fight you, white-skins, one by one, till I      kill you _all_,\" he said;  But the threat was scarcely uttered, ere a dozen      balls of lead  Whizzed through the air about him like a shower      of metal rain,  And the gaunt old Indian Cattle Thief dropped      dead on the open plain.  And that band of cursing settlers gave one      triumphant yell,  And rushed like a pack of demons on the body that      writhed and fell.  \"Cut the fiend up into inches, throw his carcass      on the plain;  Let the wolves eat the cursed Indian, he'd have      treated us the same.\"  A dozen hands responded, a dozen knives gleamed      high,  But the first stroke was arrested by a woman's      strange, wild cry.  And out into the open, with a courage past      belief,  She dashed, and spread her blanket o'er the corpse      of the Cattle Thief;  And the words outleapt from her shrunken lips in      the language of the Cree,  \"If you mean to touch that body, you must cut      your way through _me_.\"  And that band of cursing settlers dropped      backward one by one,  For they knew that an Indian woman roused, was      a woman to let alone.  And then she raved in a frenzy that they scarcely      understood,  Raved of the wrongs she had suffered since her      earliest babyhood:  \"Stand back, stand back, you white-skins, touch      that dead man to your shame;  You have stolen my father's spirit, but his body I      only claim.  You have killed him, but you shall not dare to      touch him now he's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5630"],[0,"The Story of \"Mormonism\" and The Philosophy of \"Mormonism\" (#4)"],[1,"of these lands  by force.  Throughout the book of revelations regarded by the  people as law specially directed to them, they are told to save  their riches that they may purchase the inheritance promised them  of God.  Everywhere are they told to maintain peace; the sword is  never offered as their symbol of conquest.  Their gathering is to  be like that of the Jews at Jerusalem--a pacific one, and in  their taking possession of what they regard as a land of promise,  no one previously located there shall be denied his rights.    A spirit of fierce persecution raged in Jackson and surrounding  counties of Missouri.  An appeal was made to the executive of the  state, but little encouragement was returned.  The lieutenant-  governor, Lilburn W. Boggs, afterward governor, was a pronounced  \"Mormon\"-hater, and throughout the period of the troubles, he  manifested sympathy with the persecutors.    One of the circuit judges who was asked to issue a peace warrant  refused to do so, but advised the \"Mormons\" to arm themselves and  meet the force of the outlaws with organized resistance.  This  advice was not pleasing to the Latter-day Saints, whose religion  enjoined tolerance and peace; but they so far heeded it as to arm  a small force; and when the outlaws next came upon them, the  people were not entirely unprepared.  A \"Mormon\" rebellion was  now proclaimed.  The people had been goaded to desperation.  The  militia was ordered out, and the \"Mormons\" were disarmed.  The  mob was unrestrained in its eagerness for revenge.  The \"Mormons\"  engaged able lawyers to institute and maintain legal proceedings  against their foes, and this step, the right to which one would  think could be denied no American citizen, called forth such an  uproar of popular wrath as to affect almost the entire state.    It was winter; but the inclemency of the year only suited the  better the purpose of the oppressor.  Homes were destroyed, men  torn from their families were brutally beaten, tarred and  feathered; women with babes in their arms were forced to flee  half-clad into the solitude of the prairie to escape from  mobocratic violence.  Their sufferings have never yet been fitly  chronicled by human scribe.  Making their way across the river,  most of the refugees found shelter among the more hospitable  people of Clay County, and afterward established themselves in  Caldwell County, therein founding the city of Far West.  County  and state judges, the governor, and even the President of the  United States, were appealed to in turn for redress.  The  national executive, Andrew Jackson, while expressing sympathy for  the persecuted people, deplored his lack of power to interfere  with the administration or non-administration of state laws; the  national officials could do nothing; the state officials would do  naught.    But the expulsion from Jackson County was but a prelude to the  tragedy soon to follow.  A single scene of the bloody drama is  known as the Haun's Mill massacre.  A small settlement had been  founded by \"Mormon\" families on Shoal Creek, and here on the 30th  of October, 1838, a company of two hundred and forty fell upon  the hapless settlers and butchered a score.  No respect was paid  to age or sex; grey heads, and infant lips that scarcely had  learned to lisp a word, vigorous manhood and immature youth,  mother and maiden, fared alike in the scene of carnage, and their  bodies were thrown into an old well.    In October, 1838, the Governor of Missouri, the same Lilburn W.  Boggs, issued his infamous exterminating order, and called upon  the militia of the state to execute it.  The language of this  document, signed by the executive of a sovereign state of the  Union, declared that the \"Mormons\" must be driven from the state  or exterminated.  Be it said to the honor of some of the officers  entrusted with the terrible commission, that when they learned  its true significance they resigned their authority rather than  have anything to do with what they designated a cold-blooded  butchery.  But tools were not wanting, as indeed they never have  been, for murder and its kindred outrages.  What the heart of man  can conceive, the hand of man will find a way to execute.  The  awful work was carried out with dread dispatch.  Oh, what a  record to read; what a picture to gaze upon; how awful the fact!  An official edict offering expatriation or death to a peaceable  community with no crime proved against them, and guilty of no  offense other than that of choosing to differ in opinion from the  masses!  American school boys read with emotions of horror of the  Albigenses, driven, beaten and killed, with a papal legate  directing the butchery; and of the Vaudois, hunted and hounded  like beasts as the effect of a royal decree; and they yet shall  read in the history of their own country of scenes as terrible as  these in the exhibition of injustice and inhuman hate.    In the dread alternative offered them, the people determined  again to abandon their homes; but whither should they go?  Already they had fled before the lawless oppressor over well nigh  half a continent; already were they on the frontiers of the  country that they had regarded as the land of promised liberty.  Thus far every move had carried them westward, but farther west  they could not go unless they went entirely beyond the country of  their birth, and gave up their hope of protection under the  Constitution, which to them had ever been an inspired instrument,  the majesty of which, as they had never doubted, would be some  day vindicated, even to securing for them the rights of American  citizens.  This time their faces were turned toward the east; and  a host numbering from ten to twelve thousand, including many  women and children, abandoned their homes and fled before their  murderous pursuers, reddening the snow with bloody footprints as  they journeyed.  They crossed the Mississippi and sought  protection on the soil of Illinois.  There their sad condition  evoked for a time general commiseration.    The press of the state denounced the treatment of the people by  the Missourians and vindicated the character of the \"Mormons\" as  peaceable and law-abiding citizens.  College professors published  expressions of their horror over the cruel crusade; state  officials, including even the governor, gave substantial evidence  of their sympathy and good feeling.  This lull in the storm of  outrage that had so long raged about them offered a strange  contrast to their usual treatment.  Let it not be thought that  all the people of Illinois were their friends; from the first,  opposition was manifest, but their condition was so greatly  bettered that they might have thought the advent of their Zion to  be near at hand.    I stated that professional men, and even college professors  raised their voices in commiseration of the \"Mormon\" situation  and in denouncing the \"Mormon\" oppressors.  Prof. Turner of  Illinois College wrote:        Who began the quarrel?  Was it the \"Mormons?\"  Is it      not notorious on the contrary that they were hunted      like wild beasts from county to county before they      made any resistance?  Did they ever, as a body,      refuse obedience to the laws, when called upon to do      so, until driven to desperation by repeated threats      and assaults by the mob?  Did the state ever make      one decent effort to defend them as fellow-citizens      in their rights or to redress their wrongs?  Let the      conduct of its governors and attorneys and the fate      of their final petitions answer!  Have any who      plundered and openly insulted the \"Mormons\" ever      been brought to the punishment due to their crimes?      Let boasting murderers of begging and helpless      infancy answer!  Has the state ever remunerated even      those known to be innocent for the loss of either      their property or their arms?  Did either the pulpit      or the press through the state raise a note of      remonstrance or alarm?  Let the clergymen who      abetted and the editors who encouraged the mob      answer!    As a sample of the press comments against the brutality of the  Missourians I quote a paragraph from the Quincy _Argus_, March  16, 1839:        We have no language sufficiently strong for the      expression of our indignation and shame at the recent      transaction in a sister state, and that state,      Missouri, a state of which we had long been proud,      alike for her men and history, but now so fallen that      we could wish her star stricken from the bright      constellation of the Union.  We say we know of no      language sufficiently strong for the expression of      our shame and abhorrence of her recent conduct.  She      has written her own character in letters of blood,      and stained it by acts of merciless cruelty and      brutality that the waters of ages cannot efface.  It      will be observed that an organized mob, aided by      many of the civil and military officers of Missouri,      with Gov. Boggs at their head, have been the      prominent actors in this business, incited too, it      appears, against the \"Mormons\" by political hatred,      and by the additional motives of plunder and revenge.      They have but too well put in execution their threats      of extermination and expulsion, and fully wreaked      their vengeance on a body of industrious and      enterprising men, who had never wronged nor wished to      wrong them, but on the contrary had ever comported      themselves as good and honest citizens, living under      the same laws, and having the same right with      themselves to the sacred immunities of life, liberty      and property.        CHAPTER III    Settling in and about the obscure village of Commerce, the  \"Mormon\" refugees soon demonstrated anew the marvelous  recuperative power with which they were endowed, and a city  seemed to spring from the earth.
