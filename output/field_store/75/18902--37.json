[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6440"],[0,"Elsie Dinsmore (#4)"],[1,"kneeling down with the open Bible  before her, she poured out her story of sins and sorrows, in simple,  child-like words, into the ears of the dear Saviour whom she loved so  well; confessing that when she had done well and suffered for it, she  had not taken it patiently, and earnestly pleading that she might be  made like unto the meek and lowly Jesus. Low sobs burst from her  burdened heart, and the tears of penitence fell upon the pages of the  holy book. But when she rose from her knees, her load of sin and sorrow  was all gone, and her heart made light and happy with a sweet sense of  peace and pardon. Once again, as often before, the little Elsie was  made to experience the blessedness of \"the man whose transgression is  forgiven, whose sin is covered.\"    She now set to work diligently at her studies, and ere the party  returned was quite prepared to meet Miss Day, having attended  faithfully to all she had required of her. The lesson was recited  without the smallest mistake, every figure of the examples worked out  correctly, and the page of the copy-book neatly and carefully written.    Miss Day had been in a very captious mood all day, and seemed really  provoked that Elsie had not given her the smallest excuse for  fault-finding. Handing the book back to her, she said, very coldly, \"I  see you can do your duties well enough when you choose.\"    Elsie felt keenly the injustice of the remark, and longed to say that  she had tried quite as earnestly in the morning; but she resolutely  crushed down the indignant feeling, and calling to mind the rash words  that had cost her so many repentant tears, she replied meekly, \"I am  sorry I did not succeed better this morning, Miss Day, though I did  really try; and I am still more sorry for the saucy answer I gave you;  and I ask your pardon for it.\"    \"You _ought_ to be sorry,\" replied Miss Day, severely, \"and I hope you  are; for it was a very impertinent speech indeed, and deserving of a  much more severe punishment than you received. Now go, and never let me  hear anything of the kind from you again.\"    Poor little Elsie's eyes filled with tears at these ungracious words,  accompanied by a still more ungracious manner; but she turned away  without a word, and placing her books and slate carefully in her desk,  left the room.    Rose Allison was sitting alone in her room that evening, thinking of  her far-distant home, when hearing a gentle rap at her door, she rose  and opened it to find Elsie standing there with her little Bible in her  hand.    \"Come in, darling,\" she said, stooping to give the little one a kiss;  \"I am very glad to see you.\"    \"I may stay with you for half an hour, Miss Allison, if you like,\" said  the child, seating herself on the low ottoman pointed out by Rose, \"and  then mammy is coming to put me to bed.\"    \"It will be a very pleasant half-hour to both of us, I hope,\" replied  Rose, opening her Bible.    They read a chapter together--Rose now and then pausing to make a few  explanations--and then kneeling down, she offered up a prayer for the  teachings of the Spirit, and for God's blessing on themselves and all  their dear ones.    \"Dear little Elsie,\" she said, folding the child in her arms, when they  had risen from their knees, \"how I love you already, and how very glad  I am to find that there is one in this house beside myself who loves  Jesus, and loves to study His word, and to call upon His name.\"    \"Yes, dear Miss Allison; and there is _more_ than one, for mammy loves  Him, too, very dearly,\" replied the little girl, earnestly.    \"Does she, darling? Then I must love her, too, for I cannot help loving  all who love my Saviour.\"    Then Rose sat down, and drawing the little girl to a seat on her knee,  they talked sweetly together of the race they were running, and the  prize they hoped to obtain at the end of it; of the battle they were  fighting, and the invisible foes with whom they were called to  struggle--the armor that had been provided, and of Him who had promised  to be the Captain of their salvation, and to bring them off more than  conquerors. They were pilgrims in the same straight and narrow way, and  it was very pleasant thus to walk a little while together. \"Then they  that feared the Lord spake often one to another; and the Lord hearkened  and heard it; and a book of remembrance was written before Him for them  that feared the Lord, and that thought upon His name. And they shall be  mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels;  and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.\"    \"That is mammy coming for me,\" said Elsie, as a low knock was heard at  the door.    \"Come in,\" said Rose, and the door opened, and a very nice colored  woman of middle age, looking beautifully neat in her snow-white apron  and turban, entered with a low courtesy, asking, \"Is my little missus  ready for bed now?\"    \"Yes,\" said Elsie, jumping off Rose's lap; \"but come here, mammy; I  want to introduce you to Miss Allison.\"    \"How do you do, Aunt Chloe? I am very glad to know you, since Elsie  tells me you are a servant of the same blessed Master whom I love and  try to serve,\" said Rose, putting her small white hand cordially into  Chloe's dusky one.    \"'Deed I hope I is, missus,\" replied Chloe, pressing it fervently in  both of hers. \"I's only a poor old black sinner, but de good Lord  Jesus, He loves me jes de same as if I was white, an' I love Him an'  all His chillen with all my heart.\"    \"Yes, Aunt Chloe,\" said Rose, \"He is our peace, and hath made both one,  and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us; so that  we are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the  saints and of the household of God; and are built upon the foundation  of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief  corner-stone.\"    \"Yes, missus, dat's it for sure; ole Chloe knows dat's in de Bible; an'  if we be built on dat bressed corner-stone, we's safe ebery one; I'se  heard it many's de time, an' it fills dis ole heart with joy an' peace  in believing,\" she exclaimed, raising her tearful eyes and clasping her  hands. \"But good night, missus; I must put my chile to bed,\" she added,  taking Elsie's hand.    \"Good-night, Aunt Chloe; come in again,\" said Rose. \"And good-night to  you, too, dear little Elsie,\" folding the little girl again in her arms.    \"Ain't dat a bressed young lady, darlin'!\" exclaimed Chloe, earnestly,  as she began the business of preparing her young charge for bed.    \"O mammy, I love her so much! she's so good and kind,\" replied the  child, \"and she loves Jesus, and loves to talk about Him.\"    \"She reminds me of your dear mamma, Miss Elsie, but she's not so  handsome,\" replied the nurse, with a tear in her eye; \"ole Chloe tinks  dere's nebber any lady so beautiful as her dear young missus was.\"    Elsie drew out the miniature and kissed it, murmuring, \"Dear, darling  mamma,\" then put it back in her bosom again, for she always wore it day  and night. She was standing in her white night-dress, the tiny white  feet just peeping from under it, while Chloe brushed back her curls and  put on her night-cap.    \"Dere now, darlin', you's ready for bed,\" she exclaimed, giving the  child a hug and a kiss.    \"No, mammy, not quite,\" replied the little girl, and gliding away to  the side of the bed, she knelt down and offered up her evening prayer.  Then, coming back to the toilet table, she opened her little Bible,  saying, \"Now, mammy, I will read you a chapter while you are getting  ready for bed.\"    The room was large and airy, and Aunt Chloe, who was never willing to  leave her nursling, but watched over her night and day with the most  devoted affection, slept in a cot bed in one corner.    \"Tank you, my dear young missus, you's berry good,\" she said, beginning  the preparations for the night by taking off her turban and replacing  it by a thick night-cap.    When the chapter was finished Elsie got into bed, saying, \"Now, mammy,  you may put out the light as soon as you please; and be sure to call me  early in the morning, for I have a lesson to learn before breakfast.\"    \"That I will, darlin',\" replied the old woman, spreading the cover  carefully over her. \"Good-night, my pet, your ole mammy hopes her chile  will have pleasant dreams.\"    Rose Allison was an early riser, and as the breakfast hour at Roselands  was eight o'clock, she always had an hour or two for reading before it  was time to join the family circle. She had asked Elsie to come to her  at half-past seven, and punctually at the hour the little girl's gentle  rap was heard at her door.    \"Come in,\" said Rose, and Elsie entered, looking as bright and fresh  and rosy as the morning. She had her little Bible under her arm, and a  bouquet of fresh flowers in her hand. \"Good-morning, dear Miss  Allison,\" she said, dropping a graceful courtesy as she presented it.  \"I have come to read, and I have just been out to gather these for you,  because I know you love flowers.\"    \"Thank you, darling, they are very lovely,\" said Rose, accepting the  gift and bestowing a caress upon the giver. \"You are quite punctual,\"  she added, \"and now we can have our half-hour together before  breakfast.\"    The time was spent profitably and pleasantly, and passed so quickly  that both were surprised when the breakfast bell rang.    Miss Allison spent the whole fall and winter at Roselands; and it was  very seldom during all that time that she and Elsie failed to have  their morning and evening reading and prayer together. Rose was often  made to wonder at the depth of the little girl's piety and the  knowledge of divine things she possessed. But Elsie had had the best of  teaching. Chloe, though entirely uneducated, was a simple-minded,  earnest Christian, and with a heart full of love to Jesus, had, as we  have seen, early endeavored to lead the little one to Him, and Mrs.  Murray--t"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6462"],[0,"An Introduction to the mortuary customs of the North American Indians (#4)"],[1," dwell in.    George Gibbs [Footnote: Schoolcraft's Hist. Indian Tribes of the  United States Pt. 3, 1853, p. 140]  gives the following account of  burial among the Klamath and Trinity Indians of the Northwest coast.    The graves which are in the immediate vicinity of their houses exhibit  very considerable taste and a laudable care. The dead are inclosed in  rude coffins formed by placing four boards around the body and covered  with earth to some depth; a heavy plank often supported by upright  head and foot stones is laid upon the top or stones are built up into  a wall about a foot above the ground and the top flagged with others.  The graves of the chiefs are surrounded by neat wooden palings, each  pale ornamented with a feather from the tail of the bald eagle.  Baskets are usually staked down by the side according to the wealth or  popularity of the individual and sometimes other articles for ornament  or use are suspended over them. The funeral ceremonies occupy three  days during which the soul of the deceased is in danger from _O-mah-  u_ or the devil. To preserve it from this peril a fire is kept up  at the grave and the friends of the deceased howl around it to scare  away the demon. Should they not be successful in this the soul is  carried down the river, subject, however, to redemption by _Peh-ho  wan_ on payment of a big knife. After the expiration of three days  it is all well with them.    The question may well be asked, is the big knife a \"sop to Cerberus\"?    Capt. F. E. Grossman, [Footnote: Rep. Smithson. Inst., 1871, p. 414]  USA, furnishes the following account of burial among the Pimas of  Arizona:    \"The Pimas tie the bodies of their dead with ropes, passing the latter  around the neck and under the knees and then drawing them tight until  the body is doubled up and forced into a sitting position. They dig  the grave from four to five feet deep and perfectly round (about two  feet in diameter), then hollow out to one side of the bottom of this  grave a sort of vault large enough to contain the body. Here the body  is deposited, the grave is filled up level with the ground, and poles,  trees, or pieces of timber placed upon the grave to protect the  remains from the coyotes (a species of wolf). Burials usually take  place at night, without much ceremony. The mourners chant during the  burial, but signs of grief are rare. The bodies of their dead are  buried, if possible, immediately after death has taken place, and the  graves are generally prepared before the patients die. Sometimes sick  persons (for whom the graves had already been dug) recovered; in such  cases the graves are left open until the persons for whom they were  intended die. Open graves of this kind can be seen in several of their  burial-grounds. Places of burial are selected some distance from the  village, and, if possible, in a grove of mesquite bushes. Immediately  after the remains have been buried, the house and personal effects of  the deceased are burned, and his horses and cattle killed, the meat  being cooked as a repast for the mourners. The nearest relatives of  the deceased, as a sign of their sorrow, remain in the village for  weeks and sometimes months; the men cut off about six inches of their  long hair, while the women cut their hair quite short\"    The Coyotero Apaches, according to Dr. W. J. Hoffman, [Footnote: U.S.  Geol. Surv. of Terr. for 1876, p. 473] in disposing of their dead,  seem to be actuated by the desire to spare themselves any needless  trouble, and prepare the defunct and the grave in this manner.    \"The Coyoteros, upon the death of a member of the tribe, partially  wrap up the corpse and deposit it into the cavity left by the removal  of a small rock or the stump of a tree. After the body has been  crammed into the smallest possible space the rock or stump is again  rolled into its former position, when a number of stones are placed  around the base to keep out the coyotes. The nearest of kin usually  mourn for the period of one month, during that time giving utterance  at intervals to the most dismal lamentations, which are apparently  sincere. During the day this obligation is frequently neglected or  forgotten, but when the mourner is reminded of his duty he renews his  howling with evident interest. This custom of mourning for the period  of thirty days corresponds to that formerly observed by the Natchez.\"    Somewhat similar to this rude mode of sepulture is that described in  the life of Moses Van Campen, which relates to the Indians formerly  inhabiting Pennsylvania:    \"Directly after the Indians proceeded to bury those who had fallen in  battle, which they did by rolling an old log from its place and laying  the body in the hollow thus made, and then heaping upon it a little  earth\"    As a somewhat curious, if not exceptional, interment, the following  account, relating to the Indians of New York is furnished, by Mr.  Franklin B. Hough, who has extracted it from an unpublished journal of  the agents of a French company kept in 1794:    \"Saw Indian graves on the plateau of Independence Rock. The Indians  plant a stake on the right side of the head of the deceased and bury  them in a bark canoe. Their children come every year to bring  provisions to the place where their fathers are buried. One of the  graves had fallen in and we observed in the soil some sticks for  stretching skins, the remains of a canoe, &c., and the two straps for  carrying it, and near the place where the head lay were the traces of  a fire which they had kindled for the soul of the deceased to come and  warm itself by and to partake of the food deposited near it.    \"These were probably the Massasauga Indians, then inhabiting the north  shore of Lake Ontario, but who were rather intruders here, the country  being claimed by the Oneidas.\"    It is not to be denied that the use of canoes for coffins has  occasionally been remarked, for the writer in 1875 removed from the  graves at Santa Barbara an entire skeleton which was discovered in a  redwood canoe, but it is thought that the individual may have been a  noted fisherman, particularly as the implements of his vocation--nets,  fish-spears, &c.--were near him, and this burial was only an  exemplification of the well-rooted belief common to all Indians, that  the spirit in the next world makes use of the same articles as were  employed in this one. It should be added that of the many hundreds of  skeletons uncovered at Santa Barbara the one mentioned presented the  only example of the kind.    Among the Indians of the Mosquito coast, in Central America, canoe  burial in the ground, according to Bancroft [Footnote: Native Races of  Pacific States, 1874, vol. 1, p 744.], was common, and is thus  described:    \"The corpse is wrapped in cloth and placed in one-half of a pitpan  which has been cut in two. Friends assemble for the funeral and drown  their grief in _mushla_, the women giving vent to their sorrow by  dashing themselves on the ground until covered with blood, and  inflicting other tortures, occasionally even committing suicide. As it  is supposed that the evil spirit seeks to obtain possession of the  body, musicians are called in to lull it to sleep while preparations  are made for its removal. All at once four naked men, who have  disguised themselves with paint so as not to be recognized and  punished by _Wulasha_, rush out from a neighboring hut, and,  seizing a rope attached to the canoe, drag it into the woods, followed  by the music and the crowd. Here the pitpan is lowered into the grave  with bow, arrow, spear, paddle, and other implements to serve the  departed in the land beyond, then the other half of the boat is placed  over the body. A rude hut is constructed over the grave, serving as a  receptacle for the choice food, drink, and other articles placed there  from time to time by relatives.\"        BURIAL IN CABINS, WIGWAMS, OR HOUSES.      While there is a certain degree of similitude between the above-noted  methods and the one to be mentioned subsequently--_lodge_ burial--  they differ, inasmuch as the latter are examples of surface or aerial  burial, and must consequently fall under another caption. The  narratives which are now to be given afford a clear idea of the former  kind of burial.    Bartram [Footnote: Bartram's Travels, 1791, pp. 515.] relates the  following regarding the Muscogulges of the Carolinas:    \"The Muscogulges bury their deceased in the earth; they dig a four-  foot, square, deep pit under the cabin, or couch which the deceased  laid on in his house, lining the grave with cypress bark, when they  place the corpse in a sitting posture, as if it were alive, depositing  with him his gun, tomahawk, pipe, and such other matters as he had the  greatest value for in his lifetime. His eldest wife, or the queen  dowager, has the second choice of his possessions, and the remaining  effects are divided among his other wives and children.\"    According to Bernard Roman, the \"funeral customs of the Chickasaws did  not differ materially from those of the Muscogulges. They interred the  dead as soon as the breath left the body, and beneath the couch in  which the deceased expired.\"    The Navajos of New Mexico and Arizona, a tribe living a considerable  distance from the Chickasaws, follow somewhat similar customs, as  related by Dr. John Menard, formerly a physician to their agency.    \"The Navajo custom is to leave the body where it dies, closing up the  house or hogan or covering the body with stones or brush. In case the  body is removed, it is taken to a cleft in the rocks and thrown in,  and stones piled over. The person touching or carrying the body, first  takes off all his clothes and afterwards washes his body with water  before putting them on or mingling with the living. When a body is  removed from a house or hogan, the hogan is burned down, and the place  in every case abandoned, as the belief is that"]]]
