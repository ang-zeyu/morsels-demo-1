These facts are made apparent in the pages of  this and the two preceding volumes of the HISTORY OF THE CHURCH. The  facts cannot be questioned. They are written out most circumstantially  in the Prophet's story. Times, places, and names are given of the  incidents related, and the more important of these may be corroborated  by histories of these events other than our own.    The persecutions then of the Latter-day Saints in Missouri, and their  final expulsion from that state, were crimes against the enlightenment  of the age and of the state where the acts occurred; a crime against  the constitutions and institutions both of the state of Missouri and  of the United States; as also a crime against the Christian religion.  All this we have in mind when speaking of the severity and cruelty of  these compared with other persecutions. The state of Missouri was {XIX}  guilty of a greater crime when it persecuted the Latter-day Saints than  states were which in the barbarous times of the dark ages persecuted  their people; though when estimated in net results there may have been  more murders and robberies, greater destruction of property, and more  wide-spread suffering in the latter than in the former.    It is in the light of the principle here laid down that I propose to  review the causes of the persecutions of the Latter-day Saints in  Missouri.    _The People of Missouri and the Saints_.    The people of the state of Missouri, and especially those living in  western and upper Missouri, in the early decades of the nineteenth  century, were chiefly from the states of the South--from Kentucky,  Tennessee, Virginia, and the Carolinas. This is not stated as a matter  of reproach, for among the American people there have been no better  or nobler citizens of the Republic than the people of the states  enumerated. I merely make the statement in order to present a fact, and  because other facts grow out of it. To say that Missouri was settled by  emigrants from the states of the South carries with it the explanation  why Missouri was one of the slave states, and her people attached  to the social and industrial methods of life attendant upon that  circumstance. That is to say, they looked with contempt upon manual  labor; regarding it as menial and proper only for slaves to perform.  With that idea is closely related another; namely, that white people  who from circumstances were compelled to perform manual labor, or who  followed it from principle, in the eyes of the people of the South were  of an inferior class; contemptuously characterized by some as \"white  trash,\" and by others, inclined to be more polite, as \"poor whites.\"    Freedom from manual labor gave to those of active dispositions in such  communities an opportunity to follow the more desirable vocations  of professional life; the law, medicine, the Christian ministry,  merchandising and general business; or leisure for political or  military activities; or the pursuit of pleasure, fishing, hunting,  horse racing, and social life generally. These conditions naturally  resulted in pride, often in arrogance, and a desperate sort of courage,  which held honor high and weakness and cowardice in contempt; also  something of intolerance for those disposed to set themselves against  such an order of things.    The reader will recognize, of course, that I have so far in mind  only the better element of the population, the least of the evils  and some of the advantages resulting from such industrial and social  conditions. There were, however, quite different and more serious  results than any {XX} yet noted arising from this system of society.  While those disposed to activity and inclined to honorable pursuits  might enjoy certain advantages from the system, on the other hand, it  fostered man's natural inclination to idleness and love of ease that  comes of idleness; and fostered jealousy and bitterness against those  more industrious and successful. In such a class the system led to  ignorance, irreligion, and criminal tendencies; constituting them a  dangerous element in the community. It was doubtless this class the  Prophet Joseph had in mind when he said soon after his first arrival in  western Missouri: \"Our reflections were great, coming as we had from  a highly cultivated state of society in the East, and standing now  upon the confines or western limits of the United States, and looking  into the vast wilderness of those that sat in darkness. How natural it  was to observe the degradation, leanness of intellect, ferocity and  jealousy of a people that were nearly a century behind the times, and  to feel for those who roamed about without the benefit of civilization,  refinement, or religion!\"    Many of the positions in the higher walks of life, in western Missouri,  were sought by the unworthy, the corruptible and the vicious--men  who sought all the advantages of the southern ideals of life without  possessing the refining virtues which for generations in the older  states of the south made some of the evils of the social system that  obtained there at least tolerable. Such were the Brazeales, the  Wilsons, the Hunters, the Kavanaughs, the Likens, the Loveladys, the  McCartys, the McCoys, the Pixleys, the Simsons, the Silvers, the  Westons, the Gilliams, the Birches, the Blacks, the Bogarts, the  Clarks, the Liveseys, and the Penistons.    Another circumstance which influenced somewhat the character of western  Missouri's population in the early decades of the nineteenth century,  was the fact that these sections of the state constituted part of the  frontiers of the United States, and here had gravitated a more or less  lawless class which sought the security of proximity to the boundary  lines of the United States, from whose confines they could make their  escape in the event of being hard pressed for violations of law in the  older states whence they had come, or in their new habitat. Such were  the Lovels, the Hawkins, the Heatherleys and many others.    The Latter-day Saints who settled in Missouri from 1831 to 1839 had  come for the most part from the New England States and New York.  There were, therefore, marked differences in character between  them and the old settlers of Missouri; differences of ideas as to  industrial and social life; of moral and religious life. The Saints  were descendants chiefly of the Puritans, and both by inheritance  and training had fallen heirs to the Puritan's strict views of  industry, religion and morality. The Puritans taught that all labor  was honorable, and industry a duty. {XXI} Religion occupied a large  share of their attention--entered in fact into all the affairs of  life--though its duties meant largely a regular attendance upon church  service; a strict observance of the proprieties while there; a rigid  observance throughout of the Sabbath day. Neither work nor amusements  were tolerated on that day. In the olden time among some of their  forefathers it had been unlawful to sit in Boston Common on the Sabbath  or to walk in the streets of Boston, except to church. Once a man was  publicly whipped for shooting a fowl on Sunday. A woman was threatened  with banishment for smiling in church. A person absent from church for  more than one Sunday was in danger of being fined, whipped, or set  in the stocks. Swearing was prohibited in nearly all the New England  colonies, and a split stick was sometimes placed on the swearer's  tongue. [2]    Both food and dress were plain, and the latter, in some instances, was  regulated by law. Amusements were few. Dancing and card-playing were  forbidden, and there was little music. The state sought to take entire  charge of the individual, and supposed that tendency toward immorality  could be stemmed by legislation. In early Connecticut no one under  twenty was allowed to use tobacco, and none to use it more than once  a day. The laws were severe and the penalties cruel. The stocks and  whipping-post and pillory were in frequent requisition to correct moral  delinquents. An offender might be made to stand on a stool in church  with the name of his misdemeanor displayed on his breast. Among the  common punishments were cropping or boring the ears and branding with a  hot iron. [3]    Of course in later years there was a general relaxation from these  severities, and many of these customs and laws, by the time our  generation of Saints came on the scene, were obsolete. Still, the moral  and spiritual atmosphere in which the Saints and their fathers had been  reared was austere in its moral character, and stood in marked contrast  to the moral atmosphere of the South, where, in respect of such things  as church attendance, religious observances, personal liberty in  eating, drinking and amusements, there was wider freedom.    In the sparsely settled country of western Missouri, the descendants  of the old cavaliers and their following, who settled the South, and  the descendants of the Puritans, who settled the North, were to meet:  and very naturally one may see in these antagonistic elements--aside  from the cause of antagonism which will be found in the newly revealed  religion of the Latter-d"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47708"],[0,"Biography and Family Record of Lorenzo Snow (#4)"],[1,"ather.--Cane crop.--Five hundred and  forty-nine baptisms.--King David Kalakauna is coming to visit  the Saints.--Great preparations for his reception.--Houses  decorated.--Inscriptions.--Breakfast is waiting.--The steamer  comes.--The King is escorted between two files of men, women and  children.--Cheers.--Introductions.--Breakfast, then to the meeting  house.--Reception.--Singing choirs.--Dedication prayer by President  Partridge.--The King speaks approvingly of the Saints.--Meeting  adjourned.--A \"big feast\" prepared by the natives.--What composed  of.--How the King was seated.--How he ate.--How they all, numbering  one thousand, ate.--The King escorted to the steamer.--A national  custom.--Splendid conference.--Number of the Saints.

Lorenzo Snow, son of Oliver and Rosetta L. Pettibone Snow, was born  April 3, 1814, in Mantua, Portage County, Ohio. Our father was a native  of Massachusetts, our mother of Connecticut, and were descendants of  the genuine Puritan stock--those who fled from religious persecution in  the \"old world,\" and landed on Plymouth Rock, of historic celebrity.    Early in the settlement of that portion of country now known as the  Middle States, our parents, with their family, consisting of two  daughters, Leonora Abigail, and Eliza Roxcy, (the writer of this  history,) left the home of their youth, and moved to what was at that  period considered the extreme West, or, as it was sometimes styled,  \"the jumping off place,\" and settled in Mantua, Portage County, Ohio,  making the eleventh family in the township. There two daughters and  three sons were added to the family, to wit: Amanda Percy, Melissa,  Lorenzo, Lucius Augustus, and Samuel Pearce.    Many times, and with intense interest, have their children listened to  recitals of the hardships our parents encountered, and the privations  they endured in that new and heavily timbered country, so very  forbidding when compared with the beautiful prairie landscapes of the  West. But as true and worthy representatives of our noble ancestors,  our parents were proof against discouragement,"]]]
