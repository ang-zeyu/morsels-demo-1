We should never have been led to question this belief but for  the fact that, at any rate in the case of sight, it seems as if the  sense-datum itself were instinctively believed to be the independent  object, whereas argument shows that the object cannot be identical  with the sense-datum. This discovery, however--which is not at all  paradoxical in the case of taste and smell and sound, and only slightly  so in the case of touch--leaves undiminished our instinctive belief that  there _are_ objects _corresponding_ to our sense-data. Since this belief  does not lead to any difficulties, but on the contrary tends to simplify  and systematize our account of our experiences, there seems no good  reason for rejecting it. We may therefore admit--though with a slight  doubt derived from dreams--that the external world does really exist,  and is not wholly dependent for its existence upon our continuing to  perceive it.    The argument which has led us to this conclusion is doubtless less  strong than we could wish, but it is typical of many philosophical  arguments, and it is therefore worth while to consider briefly its  general character and validity. All knowledge, we find, must be built  up upon our instinctive beliefs, and if these are rejected, nothing  is left. But among our instinctive beliefs some are much stronger than  others, while many have, by habit and association, become entangled with  other beliefs, not really instinctive, but falsely supposed to be part  of what is believed instinctively.    Philosophy should show us the hierarchy of our instinctive beliefs,  beginning with those we hold most strongly, and presenting each as much  isolated and as free from irrelevant additions as possible. It should  take care to show that, in the form in which they are finally set forth,  our instinctive beliefs do not clash, but form a harmonious system.  There can never be any reason for rejecting one instinctive belief  except that it clashes with others; thus, if they are found to  harmonize, the whole system becomes worthy of acceptance.    It is of course _possible_ that all or any of our beliefs may be  mistaken, and therefore all ought to be held with at least some slight  element of doubt. But we cannot have _reason_ to reject a belief except  on the ground of some other belief. Hence, by organizing our instinctive  beliefs and their consequences, by considering which among them is most  possible, if necessary, to modify or abandon, we can arrive, on the  basis of accepting as our sole data what we instinctively believe, at an  orderly systematic organization of our knowledge, in which, though the  _possibility_ of error remains, its likelihood is diminished by the  interrelation of the parts and by the critical scrutiny which has  preceded acquiescence.    This function, at least, philosophy can perform. Most philosophers,  rightly or wrongly, believe that philosophy can do much more than  this--that it can give us knowledge, not otherwise attainable,  concerning the universe as a whole, and concerning the nature of  ultimate reality. Whether this be the case or not, the more modest  function we have spoken of can certainly be performed by philosophy, and  certainly suffices, for those who have once begun to doubt the adequacy  of common sense, to justify the arduous and difficult labours that  philosophical problems involve.        CHAPTER III. THE NATURE OF MATTER    In the preceding chapter we agreed, though without being able to  find demonstrative reasons, that it is rational to believe that our  sense-data--for example, those which we regard as associated with my  table--are really signs of the existence of something independent of us  and our perceptions. That is to say, over and above the sensations of  colour, hardness, noise, and so on, which make up the appearance of  the table to me, I assume that there is something else, of which these  things are appearances. The colour ceases to exist if I shut my eyes,  the sensation of hardness ceases to exist if I remove my arm from  contact with the table, the sound ceases to exist if I cease to rap the  table with my knuckles. But I do not believe that when all these things  cease the table ceases. On the contrary, I believe that it is because  the table exists continuously that all these sense-data will reappear  when I open my eyes, replace my arm, and begin again to rap with my  knuckles. The question we have to consider in this chapter is: What  is the nature of this real table, which persists independently of my  perception of it?    To this question physical science gives an answer, somewhat incomplete  it is true, and in part still very hypothetical, but yet deserving of  respect so far as it goes. Physical science, more or less unconsciously,  has drifted into the view that all natural phenomena ought to be reduced  to motions. Light and heat and sound are all due to wave-motions, which  travel from the body emitting them to the person who sees light or feels  heat or hears sound. That which has the wave-motion is either aether or  'gross matter', but in either case is what the philosopher would call  matter. The only properties which science assigns to it are position in  space, and the power of motion according to the laws of motion. Science  does not deny that it _may_ have other properties; but if so, such other  properties are not useful to the man of science, and in no way assist  him in explaining the phenomena.    It is sometimes said that 'light _is_ a form of wave-motion', but this  is misleading, for the light which we immediately see, which we know  directly by means of our senses, is _not_ a form of wave-motion, but  something quite different--something which we all know if we are not  blind, though we cannot describe it so as to convey our knowledge to a  man who is blind. A wave-motion, on the contrary, could quite well be  described to a blind man, since he can acquire a knowledge of space by  the sense of touch; and he can experience a wave-motion by a sea voyage  almost as well as we can. But this, which a blind man can understand, is  not what we mean by _light_: we mean by _light_ just that which a blind  man can never understand, and which we can never describe to him.    Now this something, which all of us who are not blind know, is not,  according to science, really to be found in the outer world: it is  something caused by the action of certain waves upon the eyes and nerves  and brain of the person who sees the light. When it is said that light  _is_ waves, what is really meant is that waves are the physical cause of  our sensations of light. But light itself, the thing which seeing people  experience and blind people do not, is not supposed by science to form  any part of the world that is independent of us and our senses. And very  similar remarks would apply to other kinds of sensations.    It is not only colours and sounds and so on that are absent from the  scientific world of matter, but also _space_ as we get it through sight  or touch. It is essential to science that its matter should be in _a_  space, but the space in which it is cannot be exactly the space we see  or feel. To begin with, space as we see it is not the same as space as  we get it by the sense of touch; it is only by experience in infancy  that we learn how to touch things we see, or how to get a sight of  things which we feel touching us. But the space of science is neutral as  between touch and sight; thus it cannot be either the space of touch or  the space of sight.    Again, different people see the same object as of different shapes,  according to their point of view. A circular coin, for example, though  we should always _judge_ it to be circular, will _look_ oval unless we  are straight in front of it. When we judge that it _is_ circular, we are  judging that it has a real shape which is not its apparent shape, but  belongs to it intrinsically apart from its appearance. But this real  shape, which is what concerns science, must be in a real space, not  the same as anybody's _apparent_ space. The real space is public, the  apparent space is private to the percipient. In different people's  _private_ spaces the same object seems to have different shapes; thus  the real space, in which it has its real shape, must be different from  the private spaces. The space of science, therefore, though _connected_  with the spaces we see and feel, is not identical with them, and the  manner of its connexion requires investigation.    We agreed provisionally that physical objects cannot be quite like  our sense-data, but may be regarded as _causing_ our sensations.  These physical objects are in the space of science, which we may call  'physical' space. It is important to notice that, if our sensations  are to be caused by physical objects, there must be a physical space  containing these objects and our sense-organs and nerves and brain. We  get a sensation of touch from an object when we are in contact with it;  that is to say, when some part of our body occupies a place in physical  space quite close to the space occupied by the object. We see an object  (roughly speaking) when no opaque body is between the object and our  eyes in physical space. Similarly, we only hear or smell or taste an  object when we are sufficiently near to it, or when it touches the  tongue, or has some suitable position in physical space relatively to  our body. We cannot begin to state what different sensations we shall  derive from a given object under different circumstances unless we  regard the object and our body as both in one physical space, for it is  mainly the relative positions of the object and our body that determine  what sensations we shall derive from the object.    Now our sense-data are situated in our private spaces, either the space  of sight or the space of touch or such vaguer spaces as other senses  may give us.

It is the dream of my whole life to be Honourable  Pesca, M.P.!\"    The next morning I sent my testimonials to the Professor's employer in  Portland Place.  Three days passed, and I concluded, with secret  satisfaction, that my papers had not been found sufficiently explicit.  On the fourth day, however, an answer came.  It announced that Mr.  Fairlie accepted my services, and requested me to start for Cumberland  immediately.  All the necessary instructions for my journey were  carefully and clearly added in a postscript.    I made my arrangements, unwillingly enough, for leaving London early  the next day.  Towards evening Pesca looked in, on his way to a  dinner-party, to bid me good-bye.    \"I shall dry my tears in your absence,\" said the Professor gaily, \"with  this glorious thought.  It is my auspicious hand that has given the  first push to your fortune in the world.  Go, my friend! When your sun  shines in Cumberland (English proverb), in the name of heaven make your  hay.  Marry one of the two young Misses; become Honourable Hartright,  M.P.; and when you are on the top of the ladder remember that Pesca, at  the bottom, has done it all!\"    I tried to laugh with my little friend over his parting jest, but my  spirits were not to be commanded.  Something jarred in me almost  painfully while he was speaking his light farewell words.    When I was left alone again nothing remained to be done but to walk to  the Hampstead cottage and bid my mother and Sarah good-bye.        IV    The heat had been painfully oppressive all day, and it was now a close  and sultry night.    My mother and sister had spoken so many last words, and had begged me  to wait another five minutes so many times, that it was nearly midnight  when the servant locked the garden-gate behind me.  I walked forward a  few paces on the shortest way back to London, then stopped and  hesitated.    The moon was full and broad in the dark blue starless sky, and the  broken ground of the heath looked wild enough in the mysterious light  to be hundreds of miles away from the great city that lay beneath it.  The idea of descending any sooner than I could help into the heat and  gloom of London repelled me.  The prospect of going to bed in my  airless chambers, and the prospect of gradual suffocation, seemed, in  my present restless frame of mind and body, to be one and the same  thing.  I determined to stroll home in the purer air by the most  roundabout way I could take; to follow the white winding paths across  the lonely heath; and to approach London through its most open suburb  by striking into the Finchley Road, and so getting back, in the cool of  the new morning, by the western side of the Regent's Park.    I wound my way down slowly over the heath, enjoying the divine  stillness of the scene, and admiring the soft alternations of light and  shade as they followed each other over the broken ground on every side  of me.  So long as I was proceeding through this first and prettiest  part of my night walk my mind remained passively open to the  impressions produced by the view; and I thought but little on any  subject--indeed, so far as my own sensations were concerned, I can  hardly say that I thought at all.    But when I had left the heath and had turned into the by-road, where  there was less to see, the ideas naturally engendered by the  approaching change in my habits and occupations gradually drew more and  more of my attention exclusively to themselves.  By the time I had  arrived at the end of the road I had become completely absorbed in my  own fanciful visions of Limmeridge House, of Mr. Fairlie, and of the  two ladies whose practice in the art of water-colour painting I was so  soon to superintend.    I had now arrived at that particular point of my walk where four roads  met--the road to Hampstead, along which I had returned, the road to  Finchley, the road to West End, and the road back to London.  I had  mechanically turned in this latter direction, and was strolling along  the lonely high-road--idly wondering, I remember, what the Cumberland  young ladies would look like--when, in one moment, every drop of blood  in my body was brought to a stop by the touch of a hand laid lightly  and suddenly on my shoulder from behind me.    I turned on the instant, with my fingers tightening round the handle of  my stick.    There, in the middle of the broad bright high-road--there, as if it had  that moment sprung out of the earth or dropped from the heaven--stood  the figure of a solitary Woman, dressed from head to foot in white  garments, her face bent in grave inquiry on mine, her hand pointing to  the dark cloud over London, as I faced her.    I was far too seriously startled by the suddenness with which this  extraordinary apparition stood before me, in the dead of night and in  that lonely place, to ask what she wanted.  The strange woman spoke  first.    \"Is that the road to London?\" she said.    I looked attentively at her, as she put that singular question to me.  It was then nearly one o'clock.  All I could discern distinctly by the  moonlight was a colourless, youthful face, meagre and sharp to look at  about the cheeks and chin; large, grave, wistfully attentive eyes;  nervous, uncertain lips; and light hair of a pale, brownish-yellow hue.  There was nothing wild, nothing immodest in her manner: it was quiet  and self-controlled, a little melancholy and a little touched by  suspicion; not exactly the manner of a lady, and, at the same time, not  the manner of a woman in the humblest rank of life.  The voice, little  as I had yet heard of it, had something curiously still and mechanical  in its tones, and the utterance was remarkably rapid. She held a small  bag in her hand: and her dress--bonnet, shawl, and gown all of  white--was, so far as I could guess, certainly not composed of very  delicate or very expensive materials.  Her figure was slight, and  rather above the average height--her gait and actions free from the  slightest approach to extravagance.  This was all that I could observe  of her in the dim light and under the perplexingly strange  circumstances of our meeting.  What sort of a woman she was, and how  she came to be out alone in the high-road, an hour after midnight, I  altogether failed to guess.  The one thing of which I felt certain was,  that the grossest of mankind could not have misconstrued her motive in  speaking, even at that suspiciously late hour and in that suspiciously  lonely place.    \"Did you hear me?\" she said, still quietly and rapidly, and without the  least fretfulness or impatience.  \"I asked if that was the way to  London.\"    \"Yes,\" I replied, \"that is the way: it leads to St. John's Wood and the  Regent's Park.  You must excuse my not answering you before.  I was  rather startled by your sudden appearance in the road; and I am, even  now, quite unable to account for it.\"    \"You don't suspect me of doing anything wrong, do you? I have done  nothing wrong.  I have met with an accident--I am very unfortunate in  being here alone so late.  Why do you suspect me of doing wrong?\"    She spoke with unnecessary earnestness and agitation, and shrank back  from me several paces.  I did my best to reassure her.    \"Pray don't suppose that I have any idea of suspecting you,\" I said,  \"or any other wish than to be of assistance to you, if I can.  I only  wondered at your appearance in the road, because it seemed to me to be  empty the instant before I saw you.\"    She turned, and pointed back to a place at the junction of the road to  London and the road to Hampstead, where there was a gap in the hedge.    \"I heard you coming,\" she said, \"and hid there to see what sort of man  you were, before I risked speaking.  I doubted and feared about it till  you passed; and then I was obliged to steal after you, and touch you.\"    Steal after me and touch me? Why not call to me? Strange, to say the  least of it.    \"May I trust you?\" she asked.  \"You don't think the worse of me because  I have met with an accident?\" She stopped in confusion; shifted her bag  from one hand to the other; and sighed bitterly.    The loneliness and helplessness of the woman touched me.  The natural  impulse to assist her and to spare her got the better of the judgment,  the caution, the worldly tact, which an older, wiser, and colder man  might have summoned to help him in this strange emergency.    \"You may trust me for any harmless purpose,\" I said.  \"If it troubles  you to explain your strange situation to me, don't think of returning  to the subject again.  I have no right to ask you for any explanations.  Tell me how I can help you; and if I can, I will.\"    \"You are very kind, and I am very, very thankful to have met you.\" The  first touch of womanly tenderness that I had heard from her trembled in  her voice as she said the words; but no tears glistened in those large,  wistfully attentive eyes of hers, which were still fixed on me.  \"I  have only been in London once before,\" she went on, more and more  rapidly, \"and I know nothing about that side of it, yonder.  Can I get  a fly, or a carriage of any kind? Is it too late? I don't know.  If you  could show me where to get a fly--and if you will only promise not to  interfere with me, and to let me leave you, when and how I please--I  have a friend in London who will be glad to receive me--I want nothing  else--will you promise?\"    She looked anxiously up and down the road; shifted her bag again from  one hand to the other; repeated the words, \"Will you promise?\" and  looked hard in my face, with a pleading fear and confusion that it  troubled me to see.    What could I do? Here was a stranger utterly and helplessly at my  mercy--and that stranger a forlorn woman.  No house was near; no one  was passing whom I could consult; and no earthly right"]]]
