Well, what next do you propose to do, Polly?\" asked Mr. King.    \"Now that we know that you will allow us to have it,\" cried Polly in a  rapture, \"why, we can think up splendid things. We've only the play  written so far, sir.\"    \"Polly wrote the most,\" said Jasper.    \"Oh, no, Jasper! I only put in the bits,\" said Polly. \"He planned  it?--every single bit, Jasper did.\"    \"Well, she thought up the dragons, and the cave, and\"?--    \"Oh! that was easy enough,\" said Polly, guilty of interrupting,  \"because you see something has to carry off the Princess Clotilde.\"    \"Oh, now! you are not going to frighten my little girl,\" cried Mr.  King. \"I protest against the whole thing if you do,\" and he put out his  hand. \"Come, Phronsie,\" when, as of old, she hurried to his side  obediently.    \"Oh! we are going to show her the boys, and how we dress them up just  like dragons,\" cried Polly, \"and while they are prancing around and  slashing their tails at rehearsal, I'm going to keep saying, 'That's  nothing but Jasper and Ben and Clare, you know, Phronsie,' till I get  her accustomed to them. You won't be frightened, will you, pet, at  those dear, sweet old dragons?\" she ended, and getting on her knees,  she looked imploringly into Phronsie's brown eyes.    \"N--no,\" said Phronsie, slowly, \"not if they are really Jasper and Ben  and Clare.\"    \"They really will be,\" cried Polly, enchanted at her success, \"Jasper  and Ben and Clare; and they will give you a ride, and show you a cave,  oh! and perfect quantities of things; you can't think how many!\"    Phronsie clapped her hands and laughed aloud in glee.    \"Oh! I don't care if they are true dragons, Polly, I don't,\" she cried,  dreadfully excited. \"Make 'em real big live ones, do; do make them big,  and let me ride on their backs.\"    \"These will be just as real,\" said Polly comfortingly, \"that is,  they'll act real, only there will be boys inside of them. Oh! we'll  have them nice, dear, don't you fear.\"    \"But I'd really rather have true ones,\" sighed Phronsie.          III    THE REHEARSAL      \"Now, Phronsie,\" said Polly, on her knees before the Princess, who was  slowly evolving into \"a thing of beauty,\" \"do hold still just a minute,  dear. There,\" as she thrust in another pin, then turned her head  critically to view her work, \"I do hope that is right.\"    Phronsie sighed. \"May I just stretch a wee little bit, Polly,\" she  asked timidly, \"before you pin it up? Just a very little bit?\"    \"To be sure you may,\" said Polly, looking into the flushed little face;  \"I'll tell you, you may walk over to the window and back, once; that'll  rest you and give me a chance to see what is the matter with that back  drapery.\"    So Phronsie, well pleased, gathered up the embyro robe of the Princess  and moved off, a bewildering tangle of silver spangles and floating  lace, drawn over the skirt of one of Mrs. Whitney's white satin gowns.    \"There ought to be a dash of royal purple somewhere,\" said Polly,  sitting on the floor to see her go, and resting her tired hands on her  knees. \"Now where shall I get it, and where shall I put it when I do  have it?\" She wrinkled up her eyebrows a moment, lost in thought over  the momentous problem. \"Oh! I know,\" and she sprang up exultingly.  \"Phronsie, won't this be perfectly lovely? we can take that piece of  tissue paper Auntie gave you, and I can cut out little knots and  sashes. It is so soft, that in the gaslight they will look like silk.  How fine!\"    \"Can't I be a Princess unless you sew up that purple paper?\" asked  Phronsie, pausing suddenly to look over her shoulder in dismay at Polly.    \"Why, yes, you can be, of course,\" said Polly, \"but you can't be as  good a one as if you had a dash of royal purple about you. What's a bit  of tissue paper to the glory of being a Princess?\" she cried, with  sparkling eyes. \"Dear me, I wish I could be one.\"    \"Well, you may have it, Polly,\" said Phronsie with a sigh, \"and then  afterwards I'll rip it all off and smooth it out, and it will be almost  as good as new.\"    \"I think there won't be much left of it when the play is over,\" cried  Polly with a laugh; \"why, the dragons are going to carry you off to  their cave, you know, and you are to be rescued by the knight, just  think, Phronsie! You can't expect to have such perfectly delightful  times, and come out with a quantity of tissue paper all safe. Something  has to be scarified to royalty, child.\"    Phronsie sighed again. But as Polly approved of royalty so highly, she  immediately lent herself to the anticipations of the pleasure before  her, smothering all lesser considerations.    \"When you get your little silver cap on with one of Auntie's diamond  rings sewed in it, why, you'll be too magnificent for anything,\" said  Polly, now pulling and patting with fresh enthusiasm, since the \"purple  dash\" was forthcoming.    \"Princesses don't wear silver caps with diamond rings sewed in them,\"  observed Phronsie wisely.    \"Of course not; they have diamonds by the bushel, and don't need to sew  rings in their caps to make them sparkle,\" said Polly, plaiting and  pinning rapidly, \"but in dressing up for a play, we have to take a  poetic license. There, turn just one bit to the right, Phronsie dear.\"    \"What's poetic license?\" demanded Phronsie, wrenching her imagination  off from the bushel of diamonds to seize practical information.    \"Oh! when a man writes verses and says things that aren't so,\" said  Polly, her mind on the many details before her.    \"But he ought not to,\" cried Phronsie, with wide eyes, \"say things that  are not so. I thought poets were always very good, Polly.\"    \"Oh! well, people let him,\" said Polly, carelessly, \"because he puts it  into poetry. It would never do in prose; that would be quite shocking.\"    \"Oh!\" said Phronsie, finding the conversation some alleviation to the  fitting-on process.    \"Now this left side,\" said Polly, twisting her head to obtain a good  view of the point in question, \"is just right; I couldn't do it any  better if I were to try a thousand times. Why won't this other one  behave, and fall into a pretty curve, I wonder?\"    Phronsie yawned softly as the brown eyes were safely behind her.    \"I shall gather it up anyway, so,\" and Polly crushed the refractory  folds recklessly in one hand; \"that's the way Mary Gibbs's hat  trimmings look, and I'm sure they're a complete success. Oh! that's  lovely,\" cried Polly, at the effect. \"Now, that's the treatment the  whole drapery needs,\" she added in the tone of an art connoisseur. \"Oh!\"    A rushing noise announced the approach of two or three boys, together  with the barking of Prince, as they all ran down the wide hall.    \"O dear, dear!\" exclaimed Polly, hurriedly pulling and pinning, \"there  come the boys to rehearse. It can't be four o'clock,\" as the door  opened and three members of the cast entered.    \"It's quarter-past four,\" said Jasper, laughing and pulling out his  watch; \"we gave you an extra fifteen minutes, as you had such a lot to  do. Dear me! but you are fine, Phronsie. I make my obeisance to  Princess Clotilde!\" and he bowed low to the little silver and white  figure, as did the other two boys, and then drew off to witness the  final touches.    \"It's a most dreadful thing,\" cried Polly, pushing back the brown waves  from her brow, as she also fell off to their point of view, \"to get up  a princess. I had no idea it was such a piece of work.\"    \"You have scored an immense success,\" said Jasper enthusiastically.  \"Oh, Phronsie! you will make the hit of the season.\"    \"You'll think it is even much nicer when it is done,\" said Polly,  vastly relieved that Jasper had given such a kind verdict. \"It's to  have a dash of royal purple on that right side, and in one of the  shoulder knots, and to catch up her train.\"    \"That will be very pretty, I don't doubt,\" said Jasper, trying to  resolve himself into the cold critic, \"but it seems to me it is almost  perfect now, Polly.\"    \"Oh! thank you so much,\" she cried, with blooming cheeks. \"How do you  like it, Clare and Bensie?\"    \"I can't tell,\" said Ben, slowly regarding the Princess on all sides;  \"it's so transforming.\"    \"It's tiptop!\" cried Clare. \"It out-princesses any princess I've ever  imagined.\"    \"Well, it's a perfect relief,\" said Polly, \"to have you boys come in.  I've been working so over it that I was ready to say it was horrid.  It's too bad, isn't it, that Dick can't be here to-day to rehearse his  part?\"    \"To be sure,\" exclaimed Jasper, looking around, \"where is the  Princess's page?\"    \"He's gone to the dentist's,\" said Polly, making a wry face. \"Auntie  had to make the appointment for this afternoon, and we couldn't put off  the rehearsal; Clare can't come any other time, you know.\"    Phronsie turned an anxious face to the window. \"I hope he's not being  hurt very much,\" she said slowly.    \"I don't believe he is,\" Polly made haste to answer most cheerfully,  \"it was only one tooth, you know, Phronsie, to be filled. Auntie says  Dr. Porter told her the rest are all right.\"    But a cloud rested on the Princess's face. \"One tooth is something,\"  she said.    \"Just think how nice it will be when it is all over, and Dick comes  scampering in,\" cried Jasper, with great hilarity.    \"Do climb up on the sofa, Phronsie,\" urged Polly, looking into the pale  little face, \"you must sit down and rest a bit, you're so tired.\"    \"I will read the prologue while she rests,\" said Jasper.    \"So you can,\" said Polly. \"Take care, child,\" in alarm, \"you mustn't  curl up in the corner like that; princesses don't ever do so.\"    \"Don't they?\" said Phronsie, flying off from the lovely corner, to  straighten out again into the dignity required; \"not when they are  little girls, Polly?\"    \"No, indeed,\" said Polly, with a rescuing hand among the silver  spangles and lace; \"they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5637"],[0,"Literary and Philosophical Essays: French, German and Italian (#4)"],[1,"or nothing approach us at  our end: And if we consider, how many more there remaine, besides  this accident, which in number more than millions seeme to threaten  us, and hang over us; we shall find, that be we sound or sicke,  lustie or weake, at sea or at land, abroad or at home, fighting or  at rest, in the middest of a battell or, in our beds, she is ever  alike neere unto us. Nemo altero fragilior est, nemo in crastinum  sui certior: \"No man is weaker then other; none surer of himselfe  (to live) till to morrow.\" Whatsoever I have to doe before death,  all leasure to end the same seemeth short unto me, yea were it but  of one houre. Some body, not long since turning over my writing  tables, found by chance a memoriall of something I would have done  after my death: I told him (as indeed it was true), that being but a  mile from my house, and in perfect health and lustie, I had made  haste to write it, because I could not assure my self I should ever  come home in safety: As one that am ever hatching of mine owne  thoughts, and place them in my selfe: I am ever prepared about that  which I may be: nor can death (come when she please) put me in mind  of any new thing. A man should ever, as much as in him lieth, be  ready booted to take his journey, and above all things, looke he  have then nothing to doe but with himselfe.         Quid brevi fortes jaculamur aevo       Multa:       [Footnote: Hor. 1. ii. Od. Xiv]         To aime why are we ever bold,       At many things in so short hold?    For then we shall have worke sufficient, without any more accrease.  Some man complaineth more that death doth hinder him from the  assured course of an hoped for victorie, than of death it selfe;  another cries out, he should give place to her, before he have  married his daughter, or directed the course of his childrens  bringing up; another bewaileth he must forgoe his wives company;  another moaneth the losse of his children, the chiefest commodities  of his being. I am now by meanes of the mercy of God in such a  taking, that without regret or grieving at any worldly matter, I am  prepared to dislodge, whensoever he shall please to call me: I am  every where free: my farewell is soone taken of all my friends,  except of my selfe. No man did ever pre pare himselfe to quit the  world more simply and fully, or more generally spake of all thoughts  of it, than I am assured I shall doe. The deadest deaths are the  best.       --Miser, de miser (aiunt) omnia ademit.       Vna dies infesta mihi tot praemia vitae:       [Footnote: Luce. 1. iii. 941.]         O wretch, O wretch (friends cry), one day,       All joyes of life hath tane away:    And the builder,       --manent (saith he) opera interrupta,       minaeque Murorum ingentes.       [Footnote: Virg. Aen. 1. iv. 88.]         The workes unfinisht lie,       And walls that threatned hie.    A man should designe nothing so long afore-hand, or at least with  such an intent, as to passionate[Footnote: Long passionately.]  himselfe to see the end of it; we are all borne to be doing.         Cum moriar, medium solvar et inter opus       [Footnote: Ovid. Am. 1. ii. El. x. 36]         When dying I my selfe shall spend,       Ere halfe my businesse come to end.    I would have a man to be doing, and to prolong his lives offices as  much as lieth in him, and let death seize upon me whilest I am  setting my cabiges, carelesse of her dart, but more of my unperfect  garden. I saw one die, who being at his last gaspe, uncessantly  complained against his destinie, and that death should so unkindly  cut him off in the middest of an historie which he had in hand, and  was now come to the fifteenth or sixteenth of our Kings.         Illud in his rebus non addunt, nec tibi earum,       Iam desiderium rerum super insidet uno.       [Footnote: Luce. 1. iii. 44.]         Friends adde not that in this case, now no more       Shalt thou desire, or want things wisht before.    A man should rid himselfe of these vulgar and hurtful humours. Even  as Churchyards were first place adjoyning unto churches, and in the  most frequented places of the City, to enure (as Lycurgus said) the  common people, women and children, not to be skared at the sight of  a dead man, and to the end that continuall spectacle of bones,  sculs, tombes, graves and burials, should forewarne us of our  condition, and fatall end.         Quin etiam exhilarare viris convivia caede       Mos olim, et miscere epulis spectacula dira       Certantum ferro, saepe et super ipsa cadentum       Pocula, respersis non parco sanguine mensis.       [Footnote: Syl. 1. xi. 51]         Nay more, the manner was to welcome guests,       And with dire shewes of slaughter to mix feasts.       Of them that fought at sharpe, and with bords tainted       Of them with much bloud, who o'er full cups fainted.    And even as the AEgyptians after their feastings and carousings  caused a great image of death to be brought in and shewed to the  guests and bytanders, by one that cried aloud, \"Drinke and be merry,  for such shalt thou be when thou art dead: \"So have I learned this  custome or lesson, to have alwaies death, not only in my  imagination, but continually in my mouth. And there is nothing I  desire more to be informed of than of the death of men; that is to  say, what words, what countenance, and what face they shew at their  death; and in reading of histories, which I so attentively observe.  It appeareth by the shuffling and hudling up[Footnote: Collecting]  of my examples, I affect[Footnote: Like] no subject so particularly  as this. Were I a composer of books, I would keepe a register,  commented of the divers deaths, which in teaching men to die, should  after teach them to live. Dicearcus made one of that title, but of  another and lesse profitable end. Some man will say to mee, the  effect exceeds the thought so farre, that there is no fence so sure,  or cunning so certaine, but a man shall either lose or forget if he  come once to that point; let them say what they list: to premeditate  on it, giveth no doubt a great advantage: and it is nothing, at the  least, to goe so farre without dismay or alteration, or without an  ague? There belongs more to it: Nature her selfe lends her hand, and  gives us courage. If it be a short and violent death, wee have no  leisure to feare it; if otherwise, I perceive that according as I  engage my selfe in sicknesse, I doe naturally fall into some  disdaine and contempt of life. I finde that I have more adoe to  digest this resolution, that I shall die when I am in health, than I  have when I am troubled with a fever: forsomuch as I have no more  such fast hold on the commodities of life, whereof I begin to lose  the use and pleasure, and view death in the face with a lesse  undanted looke, which makes me hope, that the further I goe from  that, and the nearer I approach to this, so much more easily doe I  enter in composition for their exchange. Even as I have tried in  many other occurrences, which Caesar affirmed, that often some  things seeme greater, being farre from us, than if they bee neere at  hand: I have found that being in perfect health, I have much more  beene frighted with sicknesse, than when I have felt it. The  jollitie wherein I live, the pleasure and the strength make the  other seeme so disproportionable from that, that by imagination I  amplifie these commodities by one moitie, and apprehended them much  more heavie and burthensome, than I feele them when I have them upon  my shoulders. The same I hope will happen to me of death. Consider  we by the ordinary mutations, and daily declinations which we  suffer, how Nature deprives us of the sight of our losse and  empairing; what hath an aged man left him of his youths vigor, and  of his forepast life?         Heu senibus vita portio quanta manet       [Footnote: Com. Gal. 1. i. 16.]         Alas to men in yeares how small       A part of life is left in all?    Caesar, to a tired and crazed [Footnote: diseased] Souldier of his  guard, who in the open street came to him, to beg leave he might  cause himselfe to be put to death; viewing his decrepit behaviour,  answered pleasantly: \"Doest thou thinke to be alive then?\" Were man  all at once to fall into it, I doe not thinke we should be able to  beare such a change, but being faire and gently led on by her hand,  in a slow, and as it were unperceived descent, by little and little,  and step by step, she roules us into that miserable state, and day  by day seekes to acquaint us with it. So that when youth failes in  us, we feele, nay we perceive no shaking or transchange at all in  our selves: which in essence and veritie is a harder death, than  that of a languishing and irkesome life, or that of age. Forsomuch  as the leape from an ill being unto a not being, is not so dangerous  or steepie; as it is from a delightfull and flourishing being unto a  painfull and sorrowfull condition. A weake bending, and faint  stopping bodie hath lesse strength to beare and under goe a heavie  burden: So hath our soule. She must bee rouzed and raised against  the violence and force of this adversarie. For as it is impossible  she should take any rest whilest she feareth: whereof if she be  assured (which is a thing exceeding humane [Footnote: human]  condition) she may boast that it is impossible unquietnesse,  torment, and feare, much lesse the least displeasure should lodge in  her.         Non vultus instantis tyranni       Mente quatit solida, neque Auster,       Dux inquieti turbidus Adria,       Nec fulminantis magna Jovis manus.       [Footnote: Hor. I. iii.
