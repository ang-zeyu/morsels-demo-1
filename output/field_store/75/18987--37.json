She was only ascending the ladder  [6] when she shouted, \"Suan Suan, my fortunate son!\"    \"What is it, mother?\" said Suan.    \"I told the king that you could tell him who stole the princess's  ring.\"    \"Foolish mother, do you want me to die?\" said Suan, trembling.    Suan had scarcely spoken these words when the king's carriage came. The  coachman was a courtier. This man was really the one who had stolen  the princess's ring. When Suan was in the carriage, he exclaimed in  great sorrow, \"Death is at hand!\" Then he blasphemed, and said aloud  to himself, \"You will lose your life now.\"    The coachman thought that Suan was addressing him. He said to himself,  \"I once heard that this man is a good guesser. He must know that  it was I who stole the ring, because he said that my death is at  hand.\" So he knelt before Suan, and said, \"Pity me! Don't tell the  king that it was I who stole the ring!\"    Suan was surprised at what the coachman said. After thinking for a  moment, he asked, \"Where is the ring?\"    \"Here it is.\"    \"All right! Listen, and I will tell you what you must do in order  that you may not be punished by the king. You must catch one of the  king's geese to-night, and make it swallow the ring.\"    The coachman did what Suan had told him to do. He caught a goose and  opened its mouth. He then dropped the ring into it, and pressed the  bird's throat until it swallowed the ring.    The next morning the king called Suan, and said, \"Tell me now who  stole my daughter's ring.\"    \"May I have a candle? I cannot guess right if I have no candle,\"  said Suan.    The king gave him one. He lighted it and put it on a round table. He  then looked up and down. He went around the table several times,  uttering Latin words. Lastly he said in a loud voice, \"Mi domine!\"    \"Where is the ring?\" said the king.    Suan replied,--              \"Singsing na nawala          Ninakao ang akala          Ay nas' 'big ng gansa,\"--      which meant that the ring was not stolen, but had been swallowed by  a goose. The king ordered all the geese to be killed. In the crop of  one of them they found the ring. In great joy the king patted Suan  on the back, and said, \"You are truly the wisest boy in the world.\"    The next day there was a great entertainment, and Suan and the princess  were married.            In a country on the other side of the sea was living a rich man named  Mayabong. This man heard that the King of Campao had a son-in-law  who was a good guesser. So he filled one of his cascos with gold  and silver, and sailed to Campao. He went to the palace, and said,  \"King, is it true that your son-in-law is a good guesser?\"    \"Yes,\" said the king.    \"Should you like to have a contest with me? If your son-in-law can  tell how many seeds these melons I have brought here contain, I will  give you that casco filled with gold and silver on the sea; but if he  fails, you are to give me the same amount of money as I have brought.\"    The king agreed. Mayabong told him that they would meet at the public  square the next day.    When Mayabong had gone away, the king called Suan, and said, \"Mayabong  has challenged me to a contest. You are to guess how many seeds the  melons he has contain. Can you do it?\" Suan was ashamed to refuse;  so, even though he knew that he could not tell how many seeds a melon  contained, he answered, \"Yes.\"    When night came, Suan could not sleep. He was wondering what to do. At  last he decided to drown himself in the sea. So he went to the shore  and got into a tub. \"I must drown myself far out, so that no one may  find my body. If they see it, they will say that I was not truly a  good guesser,\" he said to himself. He rowed and rowed until he was  very tired. It so happened that he reached the place where Mayabong's  casco was anchored. There he heard somebody talking. \"How many seeds  has the green melon?\" said one. \"Five,\" answered another. \"How many  seeds has the yellow one?\"--\"Six.\"    When Suan heard how many seeds each melon contained, he immediately  rowed back to shore and went home.    The next morning Suan met Mayabong at the public square, as  agreed. Mayabong held up a green melon, and said, \"How many seeds  does this melon contain?\"    \"Five seeds,\" answered Suan, after uttering some Latin words.    The melon was cut, and was found to contain five seeds. The king  shouted, \"We are right!\"    Mayabong then held up another melon, and said, \"How many does this  one contain?\"    Seeing that it was the yellow melon, Suan said, \"It contains six.\"    When the melon was cut, it was found that Suan was right again. So  he won the contest.    Now, Mayabong wanted to win his money back again. So he took a bottle  and filled it with dung, and covered it tightly. He challenged the  king again to a contest. But when Suan refused this time, because he  had no idea as to what was in the bottle, the king said, \"I let you  marry my daughter, because I thought that you were a good guesser. Now  you must prove that you are. If you refuse, you will lose your life.\"    When Mayabong asked what the bottle contained, Suan, filled with rage,  picked it up and hurled it down on the floor, saying, \"I consider  that you are all waste to me.\" [7] When the bottle was broken, it  was found to contain waste, or dung. In great joy the king crowned  Suan to succeed him. Thus Suan lived happily the rest of his life  with his wife the princess.        Notes.    Two other printed variants are--    (c) \"Juan the Guesser\" (in H. E. Fansler's Types of Prose Narratives  [Chicago, 1911], pp. 73-77).    (d) \"Juan Pusong\" (JAFL 19 : 107-108).    This story seems to be fairly widespread among the Filipinos: there  is no doubt of its popularity. The distinguishing incidents of the  type are as follows:--    A1 Lazy son decides that he will go to school no longer, and (A2)  with his ABC book or a pencil and pad of paper, he has no trouble in  making his parents think him wise. (A3) He tells his mother that he has  learned to be a prophet and can discover hidden things. (A4) He spies  on his mother, and then \"guesses\" what she has prepared for supper.    B He hides his father's plough (cattle), and then finds it for  him. (B1) Plays similar trick on his uncle, thereby establishing his  reputation as a diviner.    C King's daughter loses ring, and the king sends for Juan to find it  under penalty of death if he fails, or (C1) his mother volunteers  her son's services. (C2) He accidentally discovers the thief by an  ejaculation of sorrow, or (C3) shrewdly picks out the guilty one from  among the soldiers.    In either case he causes the ring to be hid in a secret place or  swallowed by a goose (turkey), in whose body it is found the next day.    D Juan marries the princess.    E By overhearing a conversation, Juan is able to tell the number of  seeds in an orange (melon), and to win a large sum of money from a  neighboring king who has come to bet with hero's father-in-law.    F Hero required to accept another bet, as to the contents of three  jars. (Method as in E,--swimming out to neighboring king's casco and  overhearing conversation.)    G Ejaculation guess as to contents of golden ball (bottle).    H Afraid of being called on for further demonstration of his skill,  hero burns his \"magic\" book.    These incidents are distributed among the four forms of the story  as follows:--          Version a       A1A4C1C3DEG      Version b       A1A2BB1C1C2DEG      Version c       A1A2BCC2DE(accidentally hears answer)FH      Version d       A1A3A4EB      A concluding adventure is sometimes added to version c, \"Juan  the Guesser.\" King and queen of another country visit palace of  Juan's father-in-law and want their newly-born child baptized. Juan  is selected to be godfather. When called upon to sign the baptism  certificate, he instantly dies of shame, pen in hand: he cannot write  even his own name.            A connection between our story and Europe at once suggests  itself. \"Dr. Knowall\" (Grimm, No. 98) is perhaps the best-known,  though by no means the fullest, Western version. Bolte and Polivka  (2 [1915] : 402) give the skeleton of the cycle as follows:--    A1 A peasant with the name of Crab (Cricket, Rat), who buys a  physician's costume and calls himself Dr. Knowall, or (A2) who would  like to satiate himself once with three days' eating, (B) discovers  the thieves who have stolen from a distinguished gentleman a ring  (treasure), by calling out upon the entrance of the servants (or at  the end of the three days), \"That is the first (second, third)!\" (C)  He also guesses what is in the covered dish (or closed hand) while  commiserating himself, \"Poor Crab (Cricket, Rat)!\" (D1) Through  a purgative he by chance helps to find a stolen horse, or (D2) he  discovers the horse that has previously been concealed by him. (E) He  gets a living among the peasants, upon whom he has made an impression  with a short or unintelligible sermon or through the crashing-down  of the pulpit, which has previously been sawed through by him.    Bolte lists over a hundred and fifty stories containing one or more  incidents of this cycle. The discovery of the ring inside a domestic  fowl (sometimes animal) is found in most of the European versions,  as is likewise the \"ejaculation guess\" (our C3 and G).    These two details, however, are also found in Oriental forms of  the story, which, as a whole, have some peculiarly distinctive  traits. These (see Bolte-Polivka, 2 : 407) are (1) the role of the  wife, (2) the collapsing of the room, (3) the burning of the magic  book. The appearance in the Philippine versions of two of these motifs  (one in modified form), together with a third (the betting-contest  between the two kings, which is undoubtedly Eastern in origin),  leads us to believe that our story of \"Juan the Guesser\" is in large  measure descended directly from Oriental tradition, though it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/830"],[0,"The Argonautica (#4)"],[1,"Heracles bade; and warlike Jason himself rose up, glad at heart, and  thus addressed the eager throng:    (ll. 351-362) \"If ye entrust your glory to my care, no longer as before  let our path be hindered. Now at last let us propitiate Phoebus with  sacrifice and straightway prepare a feast. And until my thralls come,  the overseers of my steading, whose care it is to choose out oxen from  the herd and drive them hither, we will drag down the ship to the sea,  and do ye place all the tackling within, and draw lots for the benches  for rowing. Meantime let us build upon the beach an altar to Apollo  Embasius [1101] who by an oracle promised to point out and show me the  paths of the sea, if by sacrifice to him I should begin my venture for  King Pelias.\"    (ll. 363-393) He spake, and was the first to turn to the work, and they  stood up in obedience to him; and they heaped their garments, one upon  the other, on a smooth stone, which the sea did not strike with its  waves, but the stormy surge had cleansed it long before. First of all,  by the command of Argus, they strongly girded the ship with a rope well  twisted within, [1102] stretching it tight on each side, in order that  the planks might be well compacted by the bolts and might withstand the  opposing force of the surge. And they quickly dug a trench as wide as  the space the ship covered, and at the prow as far into the sea as it  would run when drawn down by their hands. And they ever dug deeper in  front of the stem, and in the furrow laid polished rollers; and inclined  the ship down upon the first rollers, that so she might glide and be  borne on by them. And above, on both sides, reversing the oars, they  fastened them round the thole-pins, so as to project a cubit's space.  And the heroes themselves stood on both sides at the oars in a row, and  pushed forward with chest and hand at once. And then Tiphys leapt on  board to urge the youths to push at the right moment; and calling  on them he shouted loudly; and they at once, leaning with all their  strength, with one push started the ship from her place, and strained  with their feet, forcing her onward; and Pelian Argo followed swiftly;  and they on each side shouted as they rushed on. And then the rollers  groaned under the sturdy keel as they were chafed, and round them rose  up a dark smoke owing to the weight, and she glided into the sea; but  the heroes stood there and kept dragging her back as she sped onward.  And round the thole-pins they fitted the oars, and in the ship they  placed the mast and the well-made sails and the stores.    (ll. 394-401) Now when they had carefully paid heed to everything, first  they distributed the benches by lot, two men occupying one seat; but the  middle bench they chose for Heracles and Ancaeus apart from the other  heroes, Ancaeus who dwelt in Tegea. For them alone they left the middle  bench just as it was and not by lot; and with one consent they entrusted  Tiphys with guarding the helm of the well-stemmed ship.    (ll. 402-410) Next, piling up shingle near the sea, they raised there  an altar on the shore to Apollo, under the name of Actius [1103] and  Embasius, and quickly spread above it logs of dried olive-wood. Meantime  the herdsmen of Aeson's son had driven before them from the herd two  steers. These the younger comrades dragged near the altars, and the  others brought lustral water and barley meal, and Jason prayed, calling  on Apollo the god of his fathers:    (ll. 411-424) \"Hear, O King, that dwellest in Pagasae and the city  Aesonis, the city called by my father's name, thou who didst promise me,  when I sought thy oracle at Pytho, to show the fulfilment and goal of my  journey, for thou thyself hast been the cause of my venture; now do thou  thyself guide the ship with my comrades safe and sound, thither and back  again to Hellas. Then in thy honour hereafter we will lay again on thy  altar the bright offerings of bulls--all of us who return; and other  gifts in countless numbers I will bring to Pytho and Ortygia. And now,  come, Far-darter, accept this sacrifice at our hands, which first of  all we have offered thee for this ship on our embarcation; and grant, O  King, that with a prosperous wind I may loose the hawsers, relying on  thy counsel, and may the breeze blow softly with which we shall sail  over the sea in fair weather.\"    (ll. 425-439) He spake, and with his prayer cast the barley meal.  And they two girded themselves to slay the steers, proud Ancaeus and  Heracles. The latter with his club smote one steer mid-head on the brow,  and falling in a heap on the spot, it sank to the ground; and Ancaeus  struck the broad neck of the other with his axe of bronze, and shore  through the mighty sinews; and it fell prone on both its horns. Their  comrades quickly severed the victims' throats, and flayed the hides:  they sundered the joints and carved the flesh, then cut out the sacred  thigh bones, and covering them all together closely with fat burnt them  upon cloven wood. And Aeson's son poured out pure libations, and Idmon  rejoiced beholding the flame as it gleamed on every side from the  sacrifice, and the smoke of it mounting up with good omen in dark spiral  columns; and quickly he spake outright the will of Leto's son:    (ll. 440-447) \"For you it is the will of heaven and destiny that  ye shall return here with the fleece; but meanwhile both going and  returning, countless trials await you. But it is my lot, by the hateful  decree of a god, to die somewhere afar off on the mainland of Asia.  Thus, though I learnt my fate from evil omens even before now, I have  left my fatherland to embark on the ship, that so after my embarking  fair fame may be left me in my house.\"    (ll. 448-462) Thus he spake; and the youths hearing the divine utterance  rejoiced at their return, but grief seized them for the fate of  Idmon. Now at the hour when the sun passes his noon-tide halt and the  ploughlands are just being shadowed by the rocks, as the sun slopes  towards the evening dusk, at that hour all the heroes spread leaves  thickly upon the sand and lay down in rows in front of the hoary  surf-line; and near them were spread vast stores of viands and sweet  wine, which the cupbearers had drawn off in pitchers; afterwards they  told tales one to another in turn, such as youths often tell when at  the feast and the bowl they take delightful pastime, and insatiable  insolence is far away. But here the son of Aeson, all helpless, was  brooding over each event in his mind, like one oppressed with thought.  And Idas noted him and assailed him with loud voice:    (ll. 463-471) \"Son of Aeson, what is this plan thou art turning over in  mind. Speak out thy thought in the midst. Does fear come on and master  thee, fear, that confounds cowards? Be witness now my impetuous spear,  wherewith in wars I win renown beyond all others (nor does Zeus aid me  so much as my own spear), that no woe will be fatal, no venture will be  unachieved, while Idas follows, even though a god should oppose thee.  Such a helpmeet am I that thou bringest from Arene.\"    (ll. 472-475) He spake, and holding a brimming goblet in both hands  drank off the unmixed sweet wine; and his lips and dark cheeks were  drenched with it; and all the heroes clamoured together and Idmon spoke  out openly:    (ll. 480-484) \"Vain wretch, thou art devising destruction for thyself  before the time. Does the pure wine cause thy bold heart to swell in thy  breast to thy ruin, and has it set thee on to dishonour the gods? Other  words of comfort there are with which a man might encourage his comrade;  but thou hast spoken with utter recklessness. Such taunts, the tale  goes, did the sons of Aloeus once blurt out against the blessed gods,  and thou dost no wise equal them in valour; nevertheless they were both  slain by the swift arrows of Leto's son, mighty though they were.\"    (ll. 485-486) Thus he spake, and Aphareian Iclas laughed out, loud and  long, and eyeing him askance replied with biting words:    (ll. 487-491) \"Come now, tell me this by thy prophetic art, whether for  me too the gods will bring to pass such doom as thy father promised for  the sons of Aloeus. And bethink thee how thou wilt escape from my hands  alive, if thou art caught making a prophecy vain as the idle wind.\"    (ll. 492-495) Thus in wrath Idas reviled him, and the strife would  have gone further had not their comrades and Aeson's son himself with  indignant cry restrained the contending chiefs; and Orpheus lifted his  lyre in his left hand and made essay to sing.    (ll. 496-511) He sang how the earth, the heaven and the sea, once  mingled together in one form, after deadly strife were separated each  from other; and how the stars and the moon and the paths of the sun ever  keep their fixed place in the sky; and how the mountains rose, and how  the resounding rivers with their nymphs came into being and all creeping  things. And he sang how first of all Ophion and Eurynome, daughter of  Ocean, held the sway of snowy Olympus, and how through strength of arm  one yielded his prerogative to Cronos and the other to Rhea, and how  they fell into the waves of Ocean; but the other two meanwhile ruled  over the blessed Titan-gods, while Zeus, still a child and with the  thoughts of a child, dwelt in the Dictaean cave; and the earthborn  Cyclopes had not yet armed him with the bolt, with thunder and  lightning; for these things give renown to Zeus.    (ll. 512-518) He ended, and stayed his lyre and divine voice. But though  he had ceased they still bent forward with eagerness all hushed to  quiet, with ears intent on the enchanting strain; such a charm of song  had he left behind in their hearts. Not long after they mixed libations  in honour of Zeus, with pious rites as is customary, and poured them  upon the burning tongues, and bethought them of sleep in the darkness.
