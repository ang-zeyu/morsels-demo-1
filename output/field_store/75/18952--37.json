Do keep  that; it's the prettiest thing I got.\"    \"I will,\" answered Effie, and held it fast until the last smiling face  was gone, the surprise all over, and she safe in her own bed, too tired  and happy for anything but sleep.    \"Mamma, it was a beautiful surprise, and I thank you so much! I don't  see how you did it; but I like it best of all the Christmases I ever  had, and mean to make one every year. I had my splendid big present, and  here is the dear little one to keep for love of poor Katy; so even that  part of my wish came true.\"    And Effie fell asleep with a happy smile on her lips, her one humble  gift still in her hand, and a new love for Christmas in her heart that  never changed through a long life spent in doing good.      [Illustration: \"Hollo, what do you want?\" he asked, staring at her.]          II.    THE CANDY COUNTRY.      \"I shall take mamma's red sun-umbrella, it is so warm, and none of the  children at school will have one like it,\" said Lily, one day, as she  went through the hall.    \"The wind is very high; I'm afraid you'll be blown away if you carry  that big thing,\" called Nurse from the window, as the red umbrella went  bobbing down the garden walk with a small girl under it.    \"I wish it would; I always wanted to go up in a balloon,\" answered Lily,  as she struggled out of the gate.    She got on very well till she came to the bridge and stopped to look  over the railing at the water running by so fast, and the turtles  sunning themselves on the rocks. Lily was fond of throwing stones at  them; it was so funny to watch them tumble, heels over head, splash into  the water. Now, when she saw three big fellows close by, she stooped for  a stone, and just at that minute a gale of wind nearly took the  umbrella out of her hand. She clutched it fast; and away she went like  a thistle-down, right up in the air, over river and hill, houses and  trees, faster and faster, till her head spun round, her breath was all  gone, and she had to let go. The dear red umbrella flew away like a  leaf; and Lily fell down, down, till she went crash into a tree which  grew in such a curious place that she forgot her fright as she sat  looking about her, wondering what part of the world it could be.    The tree looked as if made of glass or colored sugar; for she could see  through the red cherries, the green leaves, and the brown branches. An  agreeable smell met her nose; and she said at once, as any child  would, \"I smell candy!\" She picked a cherry and ate it. Oh, how good it  was!--all sugar and no stone. The next discovery was such a delightful  one that she nearly fell off her perch; for by touching her tongue here  and there, she found that the whole tree was made of candy. Think what  fun to sit and break off twigs of barley sugar, candied cherries, and  leaves that tasted like peppermint and sassafras!    Lily rocked and ate till she finished the top of the little tree;  then she climbed down and strolled along, making more surprising and  agreeable discoveries as she went.    What looked like snow under her feet was white sugar; the rocks were  lumps of chocolate, the flowers of all colors and tastes; and every  sort of fruit grew on these delightful trees. Little white houses soon  appeared; and here lived the dainty candy-people, all made of the best  sugar, and painted to look like real people.    Dear little men and women, looking as if they had stepped off of wedding  cakes and bonbons, went about in their gay sugar clothes, laughing  and talking in the sweetest voices. Bits of babies rocked in open-work  cradles, and sugar boys and girls played with sugar toys in the most  natural way. Carriages rolled along the jujube streets, drawn by the  red and yellow barley horses we all love so well; cows fed in the green  fields, and sugar birds sang in the trees.    Lily listened, and in a moment she understood what the song said,--      \"Sweet! Sweet!    Come, come and eat,    Dear little girls    With yellow curls;    For here you'll find    Sweets to your mind.    On every tree    Sugar-plums you'll see;    In every dell    Grows the caramel.    Over every wall    Gum-drops fall;    Molasses flows    Where our river goes    Under your feet    Lies sugar sweet;    Over your head    Grow almonds red.    Our lily and rose    Are not for the nose;    Our flowers we pluck    To eat or suck    And, oh! what bliss    When two friends kiss,    For they honey sip    From lip to lip!    And all you meet,    In house or street,    At work or play,    Sweethearts are they.    So, little dear,    Pray feel no fear;    Go where you will;    Eat, eat your fill.    Here is a feast    From west to east;    And you can say,    Ere you go away,    'At last I stand    In dear Candy-land,    And no more can stuff;    For once I've enough.'    Sweet! Sweet!    Tweet! Tweet!    Tweedle-dee!    Tweedle-dee!\"    \"That is the most interesting song I ever heard,\" said Lily, clapping  her sticky hands and dancing along toward a fine palace of white cream  candy, with pillars of striped peppermint stick, and a roof of frosting  that made it look like the Milan Cathedral.    \"I'll live here, and eat candy all day long, with no tiresome school or  patchwork to spoil my fun,\" said Lily.    So she ran up the chocolate steps into the pretty rooms, where all the  chairs and tables were of different colored candies, and the beds  of spun sugar. A fountain of lemonade supplied drink; and floors  of ice-cream that never melted kept people and things from sticking  together, as they would have done had it been warm.    For a long while Lily was quite happy, going about tasting so many  different kinds of sweeties, talking to the little people, who were very  amiable, and finding out curious things about them and their country.    The babies were made of plain sugar, but the grown people had different  flavors. The young ladies were flavored with violet, rose, and orange;  the gentlemen were apt to have cordials of some sort inside of them, as  she found when she ate one now and then slyly, and got her tongue  bitten by the hot, strong taste as a punishment The old people tasted of  peppermint, clove, and such comfortable things, good for pain; but the  old maids had lemon, hoarhound, flag-root, and all sorts of sour, bitter  things in them, and did not get eaten much. Lily soon learned to know  the characters of her new friends by a single taste, and some she  never touched but once. The dear babies melted in her mouth, and the  delicately flavored young ladies she was very fond of. Dr. Ginger was  called to her more than once when so much candy made her teeth ache, and  she found him a very hot-tempered little man; but he stopped the pain,  so she was glad to see him.    A lime-drop boy and a little pink checker-berry girl were her favorite  playmates; and they had fine times making mud-pies by scraping the  chocolate rocks and mixing this dust with honey from the wells near by.  These they could eat; and Lily thought this much better than throwing  away the pies, as she had to do at home. They had candy-pulls very  often, and made swings of long loops of molasses candy, and bird's-nests  with almond eggs, out of which came birds who sang sweetly. They played  football with big bull's-eyes, sailed in sugar boats on lakes of syrup,  fished in rivers of molasses, and rode the barley horses all over the  country.    Lily discovered that it never rained, but snowed white sugar. There was  no sun, as it would have been too hot; but a large yellow lozenge made a  nice moon, and red and white comfits were the stars.    The people all lived on sugar, and never quarrelled. No one was ill; and  if any got broken, as sometimes happened with such brittle creatures,  they just stuck the parts together and were all right again. The way  they grew old was to get thinner and thinner till there was danger of  their vanishing. Then the friends of the old person put him in a neat  coffin, and carried him to the great golden urn which stood in their  largest temple, always full of a certain fine syrup; and here he was  dipped and dipped till he was stout and strong again, and went home to  enjoy himself for a long time as good as new.    This was very interesting to Lily, and she went to many funerals. But  the weddings were better still; for the lovely white brides were so  sweet Lily longed to eat them. The feasts were delicious; and everybody  went in their best clothes, and danced at the ball till they got so warm  half-a-dozen would stick together and have to be taken to the ice-cream  room to cool off. Then the little pair would drive away in a fine  carriage with white horses to a new palace in some other part of the  country, and Lily would have another pleasant place to visit.    But by and by, when she had seen everything, and eaten so much sweet  stuff that at last she longed for plain bread and butter, she began to  get cross, as children always do when they live on candy; and the little  people wished she would go away, for they were afraid of her. No wonder,  when she would catch up a dear sugar baby and eat him, or break some  respectable old grandmamma all into bits because she reproved her for  naughty ways. Lily calmly sat down on the biggest church, crushing it  flat, and even tried to poke the moon out of the sky in a pet one day.  The king ordered her to go home; but she said, \"I won't!\" and bit his  head off, crown and all.    Such a wail went up at this awful deed that she ran away out of the  city, fearing some one would put poison in her candy, since she had no  other food.    \"I suppose I shall get somewhere if I keep walking; and I can't starve,  though I hate the sight of this horrid stuff,\" she said to herself, as  she hurried over the mountains of Gibraltar Rock that divided the city  of Saccharissa from the great desert of brown sugar that lay beyond.

In ran father and son, laughing and saying, \"See, what fine things the  thunder has brought us!\" Then the bird rattled the millstone against the  eaves of the house a third time; and the stepmother said: \"It thunders  again, perhaps the thunder has brought something for me,\" and she  ran out; but the moment she stepped outside the door, down fell the  millstone on her head; and so she died.          THE OLD WOMAN AND HER PIG    An old woman was sweeping her house, and she found a little crooked  sixpence. \"What,\" said she, \"shall I do with this little sixpence? I  will go to market, and buy a little pig.\"    As she was coming home, she came to a stile: but the piggy wouldn't go  over the stile.    She went a little further, and she met a dog. So she said to the dog:  \"Dog! bite pig; piggy won't go over the stile; and I shan't get home  to-night.\" But the dog wouldn't.    She went a little further, and she met a stick. So she said: \"Stick!  stick! beat dog! dog won't bite pig; piggy won't get over the stile; and  I shan't get home to-night.\" But the stick wouldn't.    She went a little further, and she met a fire. So she said: \"Fire! fire!  burn stick; stick won't beat dog; dog won't bite pig; piggy won't get  over the stile; and I shan't get home to-night.\" But the fire wouldn't.    She went a little further, and she met some water. So she said: \"Water,  water! quench fire; fire won't burn stick; stick won't beat dog; dog  won't bite pig; piggy won't get over the stile; and I shan't get home  to-night.\" But the water wouldn't.    She went a little further, and she met an ox. So she said: \"Ox! ox!  drink water; water won't quench fire; fire won't burn stick; stick won't  beat dog; dog won't bite pig; piggy won't get over the stile; and I  shan't get home to-night.\" But the ox wouldn't.    She went a little further, and she met a butcher. So she said: \"Butcher!  butcher! kill ox; ox won't drink water; water won't quench fire; fire  won't burn stick; stick won't beat dog; dog won't bite pig; piggy won't  get over the stile; and I shan't get home to-night.\" But the butcher  wouldn't.    She went a little further, and she met a rope. So she said: \"Rope! rope!  hang butcher; butcher won't kill ox; ox won't drink water; water won't  quench fire; fire won't burn stick; stick won't beat dog; dog won't bite  pig; piggy won't get over the stile; and I shan't get home to-night.\"  But the rope wouldn't.    She went a little further, and she met a rat. So she said: \"Rat! rat!  gnaw rope; rope won't hang butcher; butcher won't kill ox; ox won't  drink water; water won't quench fire; fire won't burn stick; stick won't  beat dog; dog won't bite pig; piggy won't get over the stile; and I  shan't get home to-night.\" But the rat wouldn't.    She went a little further, and she met a cat. So she said: \"Cat! cat!  kill rat; rat won't gnaw rope; rope won't hang butcher; butcher won't  kill ox; ox won't drink water; water won't quench fire; fire won't burn  stick; stick won't beat dog; dog won't bite pig; piggy won't get over  the stile; and I shan't get home to-night.\" But the cat said to her, \"If  you will go to yonder cow, and fetch me a saucer of milk, I will kill  the rat.\" So away went the old woman to the cow.    But the cow said to her: \"If you will go to yonder hay-stack, and fetch  me a handful of hay, I'll give you the milk.\" So away went the old woman  to the haystack and she brought the hay to the cow.    As soon as the cow had eaten the hay, she gave the old woman the milk;  and away she went with it in a saucer to the cat.    As soon as the cat had lapped up the milk, the cat began to kill the  rat; the rat began to gnaw the rope; the rope began to hang the butcher;  the butcher began to kill the ox; the ox began to drink the water; the  water began to quench the fire; the fire began to burn the stick; the  stick began to beat the dog; the dog began to bite the pig; the little  pig in a fright jumped over the stile, and so the old woman got home  that night.          HOW JACK WENT TO SEEK HIS FORTUNE    Once on a time there was a boy named Jack, and one morning he started to  go and seek his fortune.    He hadn't gone very far before he met a cat.    \"Where are you going, Jack?\" said the cat.    \"I am going to seek my fortune.\"    \"May I go with you?\"    \"Yes,\" said Jack, \"the more the merrier.\"    So on they went, jiggelty-jolt, jiggelty-jolt.    They went a little further and they met a dog.    \"Where are you going, Jack?\" said the dog.    \"I am going to seek my fortune.\"    \"May I go with you?\"    \"Yes,\" said Jack, \"the more the merrier.\"    So on they went, jiggelty-jolt, jiggelty-jolt. They went a little  further and they met a goat.    \"Where are you going, Jack?\" said the goat.    \"I am going to seek my fortune.\"    \"May I go with you?\"    \"Yes,\" said Jack, \"the more the merrier.\"    So on they went, jiggelty-jolt, jiggelty-jolt.    They went a little further and they met a bull.    \"Where are you going, Jack?\" said the bull.    \"I am going to seek my fortune.\"    \"May I go with you?\"    \"Yes,\" said Jack, \"the more the merrier.\"    So on they went, jiggelty-jolt, jiggelty-jolt.    They went a little further and they met a rooster.    \"Where are you going, Jack?\" said the rooster.    \"I am going to seek my fortune.\"    \"May I go with you?\"    \"Yes,\" said Jack, \"the more the merrier.\"    So on they went, jiggelty-jolt, jiggelty-jolt.    Well, they went on till it was about dark, and they began to think of  some place where they could spend the night. About this time they came  in sight of a house, and Jack told them to keep still while he went up  and looked in through the window. And there were some robbers counting  over their money. Then Jack went back and told them to wait till he gave  the word, and then to make all the noise they could. So when they were  all ready Jack gave the word, and the cat mewed, and the dog barked, and  the goat bleated, and the bull bellowed, and the rooster crowed, and all  together they made such a dreadful noise that it frightened the robbers  all away.    And then they went in and took possession of the house. Jack was afraid  the robbers would come back in the night, and so when it came time to go  to bed he put the cat in the rocking-chair, and he put the dog under the  table, and he put the goat upstairs, and he put the bull down cellar,  and the rooster flew up on to the roof, and Jack went to bed.    By-and-by the robbers saw it was all dark and they sent one man back to  the house to look after their money. Before long he came back in a great  fright and told them his story.    \"I went back to the house,\" said he, \"and went in and tried to sit down  in the rocking-chair, and there was an old woman knitting, and she stuck  her knitting-needles into me.\" That was the cat, you know.    \"I went to the table to look after the money and there was a shoemaker  under the table, and he stuck his awl into me.\" That was the dog, you  know.    \"I started to go upstairs, and there was a man up there threshing, and  he knocked me down with his flail.\" That was the goat, you know.    \"I started to go down cellar, and there was a man down there chopping  wood, and he knocked me up with his axe.\" That was the bull, you know.    \"But I shouldn't have minded all that if it hadn't been for that little  fellow on top of the house, who kept a-hollering, 'Chuck him up to me-e!  Chuck him up to me-e!'\" Of course that was the cock-a-doodle-do.          MR. VINEGAR    Mr. and Mrs. Vinegar lived in a vinegar bottle. Now, one day, when Mr.  Vinegar was from home, Mrs. Vinegar, who was a very good housewife, was  busily sweeping her house, when an unlucky thump of the broom brought  the whole house clitter-clatter, clitter-clatter, about her ears. In an  agony of grief she rushed forth to meet her husband.    On seeing him she exclaimed, \"Oh, Mr. Vinegar, Mr. Vinegar, we are  ruined, I have knocked the house down, and it is all to pieces!\" Mr.  Vinegar then said: \"My dear, let us see what can be done. Here is  the door; I will take it on my back, and we will go forth to seek our  fortune.\"    They walked all that day, and at nightfall entered a thick forest. They  were both very, very tired, and Mr. Vinegar said: \"My love, I will climb  up into a tree, drag up the door, and you shall follow.\" He accordingly  did so, and they both stretched their weary limbs on the door, and fell  fast asleep.    In the middle of the night Mr. Vinegar was disturbed by the sound of  voices underneath, and to his horror and dismay found that it was a band  of thieves met to divide their booty.    \"Here, Jack,\" said one, \"here's five pounds for you; here, Bill, here's  ten pounds for you; here, Bob, here's three pounds for you.\"    Mr. Vinegar could listen no longer; his terror was so great that he  trembled and trembled, and shook down the door on their heads. Away  scampered the thieves, but Mr. Vinegar dared not quit his retreat till  broad daylight.    He then scrambled out of the tree, and went to lift up the door. What  did he see but a number of golden guineas. \"Come down, Mrs. Vinegar,\" he  cried; \"come down, I say; our fortune's made, our fortune's made! Come  down, I say.\"    Mrs. Vinegar got down as fast as she could, and when she saw the money  she jumped for joy. \"Now, my dear,\" said she, \"I'll tell you what you  shall do. There is a fair at the neighbouring town; you shall take these  forty guineas and buy a cow. I can make butter and cheese, which  you shall sell at market, and we shall then be able to live very  comfortably.\"    Mr. Vinegar joyfully agrees, takes the money, and off he goes to the  fair. When he arrived, he walked up and down, and at length saw a  beautiful red cow. It was an excellent milker, and perfect in every  way. \"Oh,\" thought Mr. Vinegar, \"if I had but that cow, I should be the  happiest, man alive.\"    So he offers the"]]]
