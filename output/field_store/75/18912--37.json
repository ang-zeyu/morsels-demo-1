After which, having put down seven and  sixpence, one week's rent in advance, he was presented with a grubby  receipt and an enormous latchkey, and the _seance_ was at an end.  Mike wandered out of the house. A few steps took him to the railings  that bounded the College grounds. It was late August, and the evenings  had begun to close in. The cricket-field looked very cool and spacious  in the dim light, with the school buildings looming vague and shadowy  through the slight mist. The little gate by the railway bridge was not  locked. He went in, and walked slowly across the turf towards the big  clump of trees which marked the division between the cricket and  football fields. It was all very pleasant and soothing after the  pantomime dame and her stuffy bed-sitting room. He sat down on a bench  beside the second eleven telegraph-board, and looked across the ground  at the pavilion. For the first time that day he began to feel really  home-sick. Up till now the excitement of a strange venture had borne  him up; but the cricket-field and the pavilion reminded him so sharply  of Wrykyn. They brought home to him with a cutting distinctness, the  absolute finality of his break with the old order of things. Summers  would come and go, matches would be played on this ground with all the  glory of big scores and keen finishes; but he was done. 'He was a jolly  good bat at school. Top of the Wrykyn averages two years. But didn't do  anything after he left. Went into the city or something.' That was what  they would say of him, if they didn't quite forget him.    The clock on the tower over the senior block chimed quarter after  quarter, but Mike sat on, thinking. It was quite late when he got up,  and began to walk back to Acacia Road. He felt cold and stiff and very  miserable.          4. First Steps in a Business Career      The City received Mike with the same aloofness with which the more  western portion of London had welcomed him on the previous day. Nobody  seemed to look at him. He was permitted to alight at St Paul's and make  his way up Queen Victoria Street without any demonstration. He followed  the human stream till he reached the Mansion House, and eventually  found himself at the massive building of the New Asiatic Bank, Limited.    The difficulty now was to know how to make an effective entrance. There  was the bank, and here was he. How had he better set about breaking it  to the authorities that he had positively arrived and was ready to  start earning his four pound ten _per mensem_? Inside, the bank  seemed to be in a state of some confusion. Men were moving about in an  apparently irresolute manner. Nobody seemed actually to be working. As  a matter of fact, the business of a bank does not start very early in  the morning. Mike had arrived before things had really begun to move.  As he stood near the doorway, one or two panting figures rushed up the  steps, and flung themselves at a large book which stood on the counter  near the door. Mike was to come to know this book well. In it, if you  were an _employe_ of the New Asiatic Bank, you had to inscribe  your name every morning. It was removed at ten sharp to the  accountant's room, and if you reached the bank a certain number of  times in the year too late to sign, bang went your bonus.    After a while things began to settle down. The stir and confusion  gradually ceased. All down the length of the bank, figures could be  seen, seated on stools and writing hieroglyphics in large letters. A  benevolent-looking man, with spectacles and a straggling grey beard,  crossed the gangway close to where Mike was standing. Mike put the  thing to him, as man to man.    'Could you tell me,' he said, 'what I'm supposed to do? I've just  joined the bank.' The benevolent man stopped, and looked at him with a  pair of mild blue eyes. 'I think, perhaps, that your best plan would be  to see the manager,' he said. 'Yes, I should certainly do that. He will  tell you what work you have to do. If you will permit me, I will show  you the way.'    'It's awfully good of you,' said Mike. He felt very grateful. After his  experience of London, it was a pleasant change to find someone who  really seemed to care what happened to him. His heart warmed to the  benevolent man.    'It feels strange to you, perhaps, at first, Mr--'    'Jackson.'    'Mr Jackson. My name is Waller. I have been in the City some time, but  I can still recall my first day. But one shakes down. One shakes down  quite quickly. Here is the manager's room. If you go in, he will tell  you what to do.'    'Thanks awfully,' said Mike.    'Not at all.' He ambled off on the quest which Mike had interrupted,  turning, as he went, to bestow a mild smile of encouragement on the new  arrival. There was something about Mr Waller which reminded Mike  pleasantly of the White Knight in 'Alice through the Looking-glass.'    Mike knocked at the managerial door, and went in.    Two men were sitting at the table. The one facing the door was writing  when Mike went in. He continued to write all the time he was in the  room. Conversation between other people in his presence had apparently  no interest for him, nor was it able to disturb him in any way.    The other man was talking into a telephone. Mike waited till he had  finished. Then he coughed. The man turned round. Mike had thought, as  he looked at his back and heard his voice, that something about his  appearance or his way of speaking was familiar. He was right. The man  in the chair was Mr Bickersdyke, the cross-screen pedestrian.    These reunions are very awkward. Mike was frankly unequal to the  situation. Psmith, in his place, would have opened the conversation,  and relaxed the tension with some remark on the weather or the state of  the crops. Mike merely stood wrapped in silence, as in a garment.    That the recognition was mutual was evident from Mr Bickersdyke's look.  But apart from this, he gave no sign of having already had the pleasure  of making Mike's acquaintance. He merely stared at him as if he were a  blot on the arrangement of the furniture, and said, 'Well?'    The most difficult parts to play in real life as well as on the stage  are those in which no 'business' is arranged for the performer. It was  all very well for Mr Bickersdyke. He had been 'discovered sitting'. But  Mike had had to enter, and he wished now that there was something he  could do instead of merely standing and speaking.    'I've come,' was the best speech he could think of. It was not a good  speech. It was too sinister. He felt that even as he said it. It was  the sort of thing Mephistopheles would have said to Faust by way of  opening conversation. And he was not sure, either, whether he ought not  to have added, 'Sir.'    Apparently such subtleties of address were not necessary, for Mr  Bickersdyke did not start up and shout, 'This language to me!' or  anything of that kind. He merely said, 'Oh! And who are you?'    'Jackson,' said Mike. It was irritating, this assumption on Mr  Bickersdyke's part that they had never met before.    'Jackson? Ah, yes. You have joined the staff?'    Mike rather liked this way of putting it. It lent a certain dignity to  the proceedings, making him feel like some important person for whose  services there had been strenuous competition. He seemed to see the  bank's directors being reassured by the chairman. ('I am happy to say,  gentlemen, that our profits for the past year are 3,000,006-2-2 1/2  pounds--(cheers)--and'--impressively--'that we have finally succeeded  in inducing Mr Mike Jackson--(sensation)--to--er--in fact, to join the  staff!' (Frantic cheers, in which the chairman joined.)    'Yes,' he said.    Mr Bickersdyke pressed a bell on the table beside him, and picking up a  pen, began to write. Of Mike he took no further notice, leaving that  toy of Fate standing stranded in the middle of the room.    After a few moments one of the men in fancy dress, whom Mike had seen  hanging about the gangway, and whom he afterwards found to be  messengers, appeared. Mr Bickersdyke looked up.    'Ask Mr Bannister to step this way,' he said.    The messenger disappeared, and presently the door opened again to admit  a shock-headed youth with paper cuff-protectors round his wrists.    'This is Mr Jackson, a new member of the staff. He will take your place  in the postage department. You will go into the cash department, under  Mr Waller. Kindly show him what he has to do.'    Mike followed Mr Bannister out. On the other side of the door the  shock-headed one became communicative.    'Whew!' he said, mopping his brow. 'That's the sort of thing which  gives me the pip. When William came and said old Bick wanted to see me,  I said to him, \"William, my boy, my number is up. This is the sack.\" I  made certain that Rossiter had run me in for something. He's been  waiting for a chance to do it for weeks, only I've been as good as gold  and haven't given it him. I pity you going into the postage. There's  one thing, though. If you can stick it for about a month, you'll get  through all right. Men are always leaving for the East, and then you  get shunted on into another department, and the next new man goes into  the postage. That's the best of this place. It's not like one of those  banks where you stay in London all your life. You only have three years  here, and then you get your orders, and go to one of the branches in  the East, where you're the dickens of a big pot straight away, with a  big screw and a dozen native Johnnies under you. Bit of all right,  that. I shan't get my orders for another two and a half years and more,  worse luck. Still, it's something to look forward to.'    'Who's Rossiter?' asked Mike.    'The head of the postage department. Fussy little brute. Won't leave  you alone.

But now  this is not true, as will be evident to any one who will consider this  question in the most approved method. As, in an inquiry into every other  subject, it is necessary to separate the different parts of which it is  compounded, till we arrive at their first elements, which are the most  minute parts thereof; so by the same proceeding we shall acquire a  knowledge of the primary parts of a city and see wherein they differ  from each other, and whether the rules of art will give us any  assistance in examining into each of these things which are mentioned.            CHAPTER II      Now if in this particular science any one would attend to its original  seeds, and their first shoot, he would then as in others have the  subject perfectly before him; and perceive, in the first place, that it  is requisite that those should be joined together whose species cannot  exist without each other, as the male and the female, for the business  of propagation; and this not through choice, but by that natural impulse  which acts both upon plants and animals also, for the purpose of their  leaving behind them others like themselves. It is also from natural  causes that some beings command and others obey, that each may obtain  their mutual safety; for a being who is endowed with a mind capable  of reflection and forethought is by nature the superior and governor,  whereas he whose excellence is merely corporeal is formect to be a  slave; whence it follows that the different state of master [1252b] and  slave is equally advantageous to both. But there is a natural difference  between a female and a slave: for nature is not like the artists  who make the Delphic swords for the use of the poor, but for every  particular purpose she has her separate instruments, and thus her ends  are most complete, for whatsoever is employed on one subject only,  brings that one to much greater perfection than when employed on many;  and yet among the barbarians, a female and a slave are upon a level in  the community, the reason for which is, that amongst them there are none  qualified by nature to govern, therefore their society can be nothing  but between slaves of different sexes. For which reason the poets say,  it is proper for the Greeks to govern the barbarians, as if a barbarian  and a slave were by nature one. Now of these two societies the domestic  is the first, and Hesiod is right when he says, \"First a house, then  a wife, then an ox for the plough,\" for the poor man has always an ox  before a household slave. That society then which nature has established  for daily support is the domestic, and those who compose it are called  by Charondas _homosipuoi_, and by Epimenides the Cretan _homokapnoi_;  but the society of many families, which was first instituted for their  lasting, mutual advantage, is called a village, and a village is most  naturally composed of the descendants of one family, whom some persons  call homogalaktes, the children and the children's children thereof: for  which reason cities were originally governed by kings, as the barbarian  states now are, which are composed of those who had before submitted to  kingly government; for every family is governed by the elder, as are the  branches thereof, on account of their relationship thereunto, which  is what Homer says, \"Each one ruled his wife and child;\" and in this  scattered manner they formerly lived. And the opinion which universally  prevails, that the gods themselves are subject to kingly government,  arises from hence, that all men formerly were, and many are so now; and  as they imagined themselves to be made in the likeness of the gods, so  they supposed their manner of life must needs be the same. And when many  villages so entirely join themselves together as in every respect to  form but one society, that society is a city, and contains in itself, if  I may so speak, the end and perfection of government: first founded that  we might live, but continued that we may live happily. For which reason  every city must be allowed to be the work of nature, if we admit that  the original society between male and female is; for to this as their  end all subordinate societies tend, and the end of everything is the  nature of it. For what every being is in its most perfect state, that  certainly is the nature of that being, whether it be a man, a horse, or  a house: besides, whatsoever produces the final cause and the end which  we [1253a] desire, must be best; but a government complete in itself is  that final cause and what is best. Hence it is evident that a city is  a natural production, and that man is naturally a political animal, and  that whosoever is naturally and not accidentally unfit for society, must  be either inferior or superior to man: thus the man in Homer, who is  reviled for being \"without society, without law, without family.\" Such  a one must naturally be of a quarrelsome disposition, and as solitary as  the birds. The gift of speech also evidently proves that man is a more  social animal than the bees, or any of the herding cattle: for nature,  as we say, does nothing in vain, and man is the only animal who enjoys  it. Voice indeed, as being the token of pleasure and pain, is imparted  to others also, and thus much their nature is capable of, to perceive  pleasure and pain, and to impart these sensations to others; but it is  by speech that we are enabled to express what is useful for us, and what  is hurtful, and of course what is just and what is unjust: for in  this particular man differs from other animals, that he alone has  a perception of good and evil, of just and unjust, and it is a  participation of these common sentiments which forms a family and a  city. Besides, the notion of a city naturally precedes that of a family  or an individual, for the whole must necessarily be prior to the parts,  for if you take away the whole man, you cannot say a foot or a hand  remains, unless by equivocation, as supposing a hand of stone to be  made, but that would only be a dead one; but everything is understood to  be this or that by its energic qualities and powers, so that when these  no longer remain, neither can that be said to be the same, but something  of the same name. That a city then precedes an individual is plain,  for if an individual is not in himself sufficient to compose a perfect  government, he is to a city as other parts are to a whole; but he that  is incapable of society, or so complete in himself as not to want it,  makes no part of a city, as a beast or a god. There is then in all  persons a natural impetus to associate with each other in this manner,  and he who first founded civil society was the cause of the greatest  good; for as by the completion of it man is the most excellent of all  living beings, so without law and justice he would be the worst of all,  for nothing is so difficult to subdue as injustice in arms: but these  arms man is born with, namely, prudence and valour, which he may apply  to the most opposite purposes, for he who abuses them will be the most  wicked, the most cruel, the most lustful, and most gluttonous being  imaginable; for justice is a political virtue, by the rules of it the  state is regulated, and these rules are the criterion of what is right.            CHAPTER III      SINCE it is now evident of what parts a city is composed, it will be  necessary to treat first of family government, for every city is made  up of families, and every family [1253b] has again its separate parts of  which it is composed. When a family is complete, it consists of freemen  and slaves; but as in every subject we should begin with examining into  the smallest parts of which it consists, and as the first and smallest  parts of a family are the master and slave, the husband and wife, the  father and child, let us first inquire into these three, what each of  them may be, and what they ought to be; that is to say, the herile, the  nuptial, and the paternal. Let these then be considered as the three  distinct parts of a family: some think that the providing what is  necessary for the family is something different from the government of  it, others that this is the greatest part of it; it shall be considered  separately; but we will first speak of a master and a slave, that we  may both understand the nature of those things which are absolutely  necessary, and also try if we can learn anything better on this subject  than what is already known. Some persons have thought that the power of  the master over his slave originates from his superior knowledge, and  that this knowledge is the same in the master, the magistrate, and the  king, as we have already said; but others think that herile government  is contrary to nature, and that it is the law which makes one man a  slave and another free, but that in nature there is no difference; for  which reason that power cannot be founded in justice, but in force.          CHAPTER IV      Since then a subsistence is necessary in every family, the means of  procuring it certainly makes up part of the management of a family, for  without necessaries it is impossible to live, and to live well. As  in all arts which are brought to perfection it is necessary that they  should have their proper instruments if they would complete their works,  so is it in the art of managing a family: now of instruments some of  them are alive, others inanimate; thus with respect to the pilot of the  ship, the tiller is without life, the sailor is alive; for a servant  is as an instrument in many arts. Thus property is as an instrument  to living; an estate is a multitude of instruments; so a slave is an  animated instrument, but every one that can minister of himself is more  valuable than any other instrument; for if every instrument, at command,  or from a preconception of its master's will, could accomplish its work  (as"]]]
