Therefore they'll bear him hard--the poor old man!  And there is none to shield him from their gripe.  Come what come may, I must go home again.    FURST.  Compose yourself, and wait in patience till  We get some tidings o'er from Unterwald.  Away! away! I hear a knock! Perhaps  A message from the viceroy! Get thee in!  You are not safe from Landenberger's [6] arm  In Uri, for these tyrants pull together.    MELCHTHAL.  They teach us Switzers what we ought to do.    FURST.  Away! I'll call you when the coast is clear.       [MELCHTHAL retires.    Unhappy youth! I dare not tell him all  The evil that my boding heart predicts!  Who's there? The door ne'er opens but I look  For tidings of mishap. Suspicion lurks  With darkling treachery in every nook.  Even to our inmost rooms they force their way,  These myrmidons of power; and soon we'll need  To fasten bolts and bars upon our doors.       [He opens the door and steps back in surprise as     WERNER STAUFFACHER enters.    What do I see? You, Werner? Now, by Heaven!  A valued guest, indeed. No man e'er set  His foot across this threshold more esteemed.  Welcome! thrice welcome, Werner, to my roof!  What brings you here? What seek you here in Uri?    STAUFFACHER (shakes FURST by the hand).  The olden times and olden Switzerland.    FURST.  You bring them with you. See how I'm rejoiced,  My heart leaps at the very sight of you.  Sit down--sit down, and tell me how you left  Your charming wife, fair Gertrude? Iberg's child,  And clever as her father. Not a man,  That wends from Germany, by Meinrad's Cell, [7]  To Italy, but praises far and wide  Your house's hospitality. But say,  Have you come here direct from Flueelen,  And have you noticed nothing on your way,  Before you halted at my door?    STAUFFACHER (sits down).                  I saw  A work in progress, as I came along,  I little thought to see--that likes me ill.    FURST.  O friend! you've lighted on my thought at once.    STAUFFACHER.  Such things in Uri ne'er were known before.  Never was prison here in man's remembrance,  Nor ever any stronghold but the grave.    FURST.  You name it well. It is the grave of freedom.    STAUFFACHER.  Friend, Walter Furst, I will be plain with you.  No idle curiosity it is  That brings me here, but heavy cares. I left  Thraldom at home, and thraldom meets me here.  Our wrongs, e'en now, are more than we can bear.  And who shall tell us where they are to end?  From eldest time the Switzer has been free,  Accustomed only to the mildest rule.  Such things as now we suffer ne'er were known  Since herdsmen first drove cattle to the hills.    FURST.  Yes, our oppressions are unparalleled!  Why, even our own good lord of Attinghaus,  Who lived in olden times, himself declares  They are no longer to be tamely borne.    STAUFFACHER.  In Unterwalden yonder 'tis the same;  And bloody has the retribution been.  The imperial seneschal, the Wolfshot, who  At Rossberg dwelt, longed for forbidden fruits--  Baumgarten's wife, that lives at Alzellen,  He wished to overcome in shameful sort,  On which the husband slew him with his axe.    FURST.  Oh, Heaven is just in all its judgments still!  Baumgarten, say you? A most worthy man.  Has he escaped, and is he safely hid?    STAUFFACHER.  Your son-in-law conveyed him o'er the lake,  And he lies hidden in my house at Steinen.  He brought the tidings with him of a thing  That has been done at Sarnen, worse than all,  A thing to make the very heart run blood!    FURST (attentively).  Say on. What is it?    STAUFFACHER.             There dwells in Melchthal, then,  Just as you enter by the road from Kearns,  An upright man, named Henry of the Halden,  A man of weight and influence in the Diet.    FURST.  Who knows him not? But what of him? Proceed.    STAUFFACHER.  The Landenberg, to punish some offence,  Committed by the old man's son, it seems,  Had given command to take the youth's best pair  Of oxen from his plough: on which the lad  Struck down the messenger and took to flight.    FURST.  But the old father--tell me, what of him?    STAUFFACHER.  The Landenberg sent for him, and required  He should produce his son upon the spot;  And when the old man protested, and with truth,  That he knew nothing of the fugitive,  The tyrant called his torturers.    FURST (springs up and tries to lead him to the other side).                   Hush, no more!    STAUFFACHER (with increasing warmth).  \"And though thy son,\" he cried, \"Has escaped me now,  I have thee fast, and thou shalt feel my vengeance.\"  With that they flung the old man to the earth,  And plunged the pointed steel into his eyes.    FURST.  Merciful heavens!    MELCHTHAL (rushing out).            Into his eyes, his eyes?    STAUFFACHER (addresses himself in astonishment to WALTER FURST).  Who is this youth?    MELCHTHAL (grasping him convulsively).            Into his eyes? Speak, speak!    FURST.  Oh, miserable hour!    STAUFFACHER.             Who is it, tell me?       [STAUFFACHER makes a sign to him.    It is his son! All righteous heaven!    MELCHTHAL.                      And I  Must be from thence! What! into both his eyes?    FURST.  Be calm, be calm; and bear it like a man!    MELCHTHAL.  And all for me--for my mad wilful folly!  Blind, did you say? Quite blind--and both his eyes?    STAUFFACHER.  Even so. The fountain of his sight's dried up.  He ne'er will see the blessed sunshine more.    FURST.  Oh, spare his anguish!    MELCHTHAL.              Never, never more!       [Presses his hands upon his eyes and is silent for some     moments; then turning from one to the other, speaks in a     subdued tone, broken by sobs.    O the eye's light, of all the gifts of heaven,  The dearest, best! From light all beings live--  Each fair created thing--the very plants  Turn with a joyful transport to the light,  And he--he must drag on through all his days  In endless darkness! Never more for him  The sunny meads shall glow, the flowerets bloom;  Nor shall he more behold the roseate tints  Of the iced mountain top! To die is nothing,  But to have life, and not have sight--oh, that  Is misery indeed! Why do you look  So piteously at me? I have two eyes,  Yet to my poor blind father can give neither!  No, not one gleam of that great sea of light,  That with its dazzling splendor floods my gaze.    STAUFFACHER.  Ah, I must swell the measure of your grief,  Instead of soothing it. The worst, alas!  Remains to tell. They've stripped him of his all;  Naught have they left him, save his staff, on which,  Blind and in rags, he moves from door to door.    MELCHTHAL.  Naught but his staff to the old eyeless man!  Stripped of his all--even of the light of day,  The common blessing of the meanest wretch.  Tell me no more of patience, of concealment!  Oh, what a base and coward thing am I,  That on mine own security I thought  And took no care of thine! Thy precious head  Left as a pledge within the tyrant's grasp!  Hence, craven-hearted prudence, hence! And all  My thoughts be vengeance, and the despot's blood!  I'll seek him straight--no power shall stay me now--  And at his hands demand my father's eyes.  I'll beard him 'mid a thousand myrmidons!  What's life to me, if in his heart's best blood  I cool the fever of this mighty anguish.                    [He is going.    FURST.  Stay, this is madness, Melchthal! What avails  Your single arm against his power? He sits  At Sarnen high within his lordly keep,  And, safe within its battlemented walls,  May laugh to scorn your unavailing rage.    MELCHTHAL.  And though he sat within the icy domes  Of yon far Schreckhorn--ay, or higher, where  Veiled since eternity, the Jungfrau soars,  Still to the tyrant would I make my way;  With twenty comrades minded like myself,  I'd lay his fastness level with the earth!  And if none follow me, and if you all,  In terror for your homesteads and your herds,  Bow in submission to the tyrant's yoke,  I'll call the herdsmen on the hills around me,  And there beneath heaven's free and boundless roof,  Where men still feel as men, and hearts are true  Proclaim aloud this foul enormity!    STAUFFACHER (to FURST).  'Tis at its height--and are we then to wait  Till some extremity----    MELCHTHAL.              What extremity  Remains for apprehension, where men's eyes  Have ceased to be secure within their sockets?  Are we defenceless? Wherefore did we learn  To bend the crossbow--wield the battle-axe?  What living creature, but in its despair,  Finds for itself a weapon of defence?  The baited stag will turn, and with the show  Of his dread antlers hold the hounds at bay;  The chamois drags the huntsman down the abyss;  The very ox, the partner of man's toil,  The sharer of his roof, that meekly bends  The strength of his huge neck beneath the yoke,  Springs up, if he's provoked, whets his strong horn,  And tosses his tormenter to the clouds.    FURST.  If the three Cantons thought as we three do,  Something might, then, be done, with good effect.    STAUFFACHER.  When Uri calls, when Unterwald replies,  Schwytz will be mindful of her ancient league. [8]    MELCHTHAL.  I've many friends in Unterwald, and none  That would not gladly venture life and limb  If fairly backed and aided by the rest.  Oh, sage and reverend fathers of this land,  Here do I stand before your riper years,  An unskilled youth whose voice must in the Diet  Still be subdued into respectful silence.  Do not, because that I am young and want  Experience, slight my counsel and my words.  'Tis not the wantonness of youthful blood  That fires my spirit; but a pang so deep  That even the flinty rocks must pity me.  You, too, are fathers, heads of families,  And you must wish to have a virtuous son  To reverence your gray hairs and shield your eyes  With pious and affectionate regard.  Do not, I pray, because in limb and fortune  You still are unassailed,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6791"],[0,"Mary Stuart: A Tragedy (#4)"],[1,"     [He pauses.    I saw then, not your picture, but yourself--  Oh, what a treasure do these walls enclose!  No prison this, but the abode of gods,  More splendid far than England's royal court.  Happy, thrice happy he, whose envied lot  Permits to breathe the selfsame air with you!  It is a prudent policy in her  To bury you so deep! All England's youth  Would rise at once in general mutiny,  And not a sword lie quiet in its sheath:  Rebellion would uprear its giant head,  Through all this peaceful isle, if Britons once  Beheld their captive queen.    MARY.                 'Twere well with her,  If every Briton saw her with your eyes!    MORTIMER.  Were each, like me, a witness of your wrongs,  Your meekness, and the noble fortitude  With which you suffer these indignities--  Would you not then emerge from all these trials  Like a true queen? Your prison's infamy,  Hath it despoiled your beauty of its charms?  You are deprived of all that graces life,  Yet round you life and light eternal beam.  Ne'er on this threshold can I set my foot,  That my poor heart with anguish is not torn,  Nor ravished with delight at gazing on you.  Yet fearfully the fatal time draws near,  And danger hourly growing presses on.  I can delay no longer--can no more  Conceal the dreadful news.    MARY.                My sentence then!  It is pronounced? Speak freely--I can bear it.    MORTIMER.  It is pronounced! The two-and-forty judges  Have given the verdict, \"guilty\"; and the Houses  Of Lords and Commons, with the citizens  Of London, eagerly and urgently  Demand the execution of the sentence:--  The queen alone still craftily delays,  That she may be constrained to yield, but not  From feelings of humanity or mercy.    MARY (collected).  Sir, I am not surprised, nor terrified.  I have been long prepared for such a message.  Too well I know my judges. After all  Their cruel treatment I can well conceive  They dare not now restore my liberty.  I know their aim: they mean to keep me here  In everlasting bondage, and to bury,  In the sepulchral darkness of my prison,  My vengeance with me, and my rightful claims.    MORTIMER.  Oh, no, my gracious queen;--they stop not there:  Oppression will not be content to do  Its work by halves:--as long as e'en you live,  Distrust and fear will haunt the English queen.  No dungeon can inter you deep enough;  Your death alone can make her throne secure.    MARY.  Will she then dare, regardless of the shame,  Lay my crowned head upon the fatal block?    MORTIMER.  She will most surely dare it, doubt it not.    MARY.  And can she thus roll in the very dust  Her own, and every monarch's majesty?    MORTIMER.  She thinks on nothing now but present danger,  Nor looks to that which is so far removed.    MARY.  And fears she not the dread revenge of France?    MORTIMER.  With France she makes an everlasting peace;  And gives to Anjou's duke her throne and hand.    MARY.  Will not the King of Spain rise up in arms?    MORTIMER.  She fears not a collected world in arms?  If with her people she remains at peace.    MARY.  Were this a spectacle for British eyes?    MORTIMER.  This land, my queen, has, in these latter days,  Seen many a royal woman from the throne  Descend and mount the scaffold:--her own mother  And Catherine Howard trod this fatal path;  And was not Lady Grey a crowned head?    MARY (after a pause).  No, Mortimer, vain fears have blinded you;  'Tis but the honest care of your true heart,  Which conjures up these empty apprehensions.  It is not, sir, the scaffold that I fear:  There are so many still and secret means  By which her majesty of England may  Set all my claims to rest. Oh, trust me, ere  An executioner is found for me,  Assassins will be hired to do their work.  'Tis that which makes me tremble, Mortimer:  I never lift the goblet to my lips  Without an inward shuddering, lest the draught  May have been mingled by my sister's love.    MORTIMER.  No:--neither open or disguised murder  Shall e'er prevail against you:--fear no more;  All is prepared;--twelve nobles of the land  Are my confederates, and have pledged to-day,  Upon the sacrament, their faith to free you,  With dauntless arm, from this captivity.  Count Aubespine, the French ambassador,  Knows of our plot, and offers his assistance:  'Tis in his palace that we hold our meetings.    NARY.  You make me tremble, sir, but not for joy!  An evil boding penetrates my heart.  Know you, then, what you risk? Are you not scared  By Babington and Tichburn's bloody heads,  Set up as warnings upon London's bridge?  Nor by the ruin of those many victims  Who have, in such attempts, found certain death,  And only made my chains the heavier?  Fly hence, deluded, most unhappy youth!  Fly, if there yet be time for you, before  That crafty spy, Lord Burleigh, track your schemes,  And mix his traitors in your secret plots.  Fly hence:--as yet, success hath never smiled  On Mary Stuart's champions.    MORTIMER.                 I am not scared  By Babington and Tichburn's bloody heads  Set up as warnings upon London's bridge;  Nor by the ruin of those many victims  Who have, in such attempts, found certain death:  They also found therein immortal honor,  And death, in rescuing you, is dearest bliss.    MARY.  It is in vain: nor force nor guile can save me:--  My enemies are watchful, and the power  Is in their hands. It is not Paulet only  And his dependent host; all England guards  My prison gates: Elizabeth's free will  Alone can open them.    MORTIMER.             Expect not that.    MARY.  One man alone on earth can open them.    MORTIMER.  Oh, let me know his name!    MARY.                Lord Leicester.    MORTIMER.                        He!       [Starts back in wonder.    The Earl of Leicester! Your most bloody foe,  The favorite of Elizabeth! through him----    MARY.  If I am to be saved at all, 'twill be  Through him, and him alone. Go to him, sir;  Freely confide in him: and, as a proof  You come from me, present this paper to him.       [She takes a paper from her bosom; MORTIMER draws back,     and hesitates to take it.    It doth contain my portrait:--take it, sir;  I've borne it long about me; but your uncle's  Close watchfulness has cut me off from all  Communication with him;--you were sent  By my good angel.       [He takes it.    MORTIMER.            Oh, my queen! Explain  This mystery.    MARY.          Lord Leicester will resolve it.  Confide in him, and he'll confide in you.  Who comes?    KENNEDY (entering hastily).        'Tis Paulet; and he brings with him  A nobleman from court.    MORTIMER.              It is Lord Burleigh.  Collect yourself, my queen, and strive to hear  The news he brings with equanimity.       [He retires through a side door, and KENNEDY follows him.        SCENE VII.       Enter LORD BURLEIGH, and PAULET.    PAULET (to MARY).  You wished to-day assurance of your fate;  My Lord of Burleigh brings it to you now;  Hear it with resignation, as beseems you.    MARY.  I hope with dignity, as it becomes  My innocence, and my exalted station.    BURLEIGH.  I come deputed from the court of justice.    MARY.  Lord Burleigh lends that court his willing tongue,  Which was already guided by his spirit.    PAULET.  You speak as if no stranger to the sentence.    MARY.  Lord Burleigh brings it; therefore do I know it.    PAULET.  [It would become you better, Lady Stuart,  To listen less to hatred.    MARY.                I but name  My enemy: I said not that I hate him.]  But to the matter, sir.    BURLEIGH.               You have acknowledged  The jurisdiction of the two-and-forty.    MARY.  My lord, excuse me, if I am obliged  So soon to interrupt you. I acknowledged,  Say you, the competence of the commission?  I never have acknowledged it, my lord;  How could I so? I could not give away  My own prerogative, the intrusted rights  Of my own people, the inheritance  Of my own son, and every monarch's honor  [The very laws of England say I could not.]  It is enacted by the English laws  That every one who stands arraigned of crime  Shall plead before a jury of his equals:  Who is my equal in this high commission?  Kings only are my peers.    BURLEIGH.               But yet you heard  The points of accusation, answered them  Before the court----    MARY.            'Tis true, I was deceived  By Hatton's crafty counsel:--he advised me,  For my own honor, and in confidence  In my good cause, and my most strong defence,  To listen to the points of accusation,  And prove their falsehoods. This, my lord, I did  From personal respect for the lords' names,  Not their usurped charge, which I disclaim.    BURLEIGH.  Acknowledge you the court, or not, that is  Only a point of mere formality,  Which cannot here arrest the course of justice.  You breathe the air of England; you enjoy  The law's protection, and its benefits;  You therefore are its subject.    MARY.                  Sir, I breathe  The air within an English prison walls:  Is that to live in England; to enjoy  Protection from its laws? I scarcely know  And never have I pledged my faith to keep them.  I am no member of this realm; I am  An independent, and a foreign queen.    BURLEIGH.  And do you think that the mere name of queen  Can serve you as a charter to foment  In other countries, with impunity,  This bloody discord? Where would be the state's  Security, if the stern sword of justice  Could not as freely smite the guilty brow  Of the imperial stranger as the beggar's?    MARY.  I do not wish to be exempt from judgment,  It is the judges only I disclaim.    BURLEIGH.  The judges? How now, madam? Are they then  Base wretches, snatched at hazard from the crowd?  Vile wranglers that make sale of truth and justice;  Oppression's willing hirelings, and its tools?  Are they not all the foremost of this land,  Too independent to be else than honest,  And too exalted not to soar above  The fear of kings, or base servility?  Are they not those who rule a"]]]
