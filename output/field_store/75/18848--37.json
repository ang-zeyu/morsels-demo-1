But, as it turned out, this was good fortune for the young  painter-monk, for in those hill towns of Umbria where the brothers  sought refuge there were pictures to be studied which delighted his  eyes with their beauty, and taught him many a lesson which he could  never have learned on the quiet slopes of Fiesole.    The hill towns of Italy are very much the same to-day as they were in  those days. Long winding roads lead upwards from the plain below to the  city gates, and there on the summit of the hill the little town is  built. The tall white houses cluster close together, and the  overhanging eaves seem almost to meet across the narrow paved streets,  and always there is the great square, with the church the centre of all.    It would be almost a day's journey to follow the white road that leads  down from Perugia across the plain to the little hill town of Assisi,  and many a spring morning saw the painter-monk setting out on the  convent donkey before sunrise and returning when the sun had set. He  would thread his way up between the olive-trees until he reached the  city gates, and pass into the little town without hindrance. For the  followers of St. Francis in their brown robes would be glad to welcome  a stranger monk, though his black robe showed that he belonged to a  different order. Any one who came to see the glory of their city, the  church where their saint lay, which Giotto had covered with his  wonderful pictures, was never refused admittance.    How often then must Fra Angelico have knelt in the dim light of that  lower church of Assisi, learning his lesson on his knees, as was ever  his habit. Then home again he would wend his way, his eyes filled with  visions of those beautiful pictures, and his hand longing for the  pencil and brush, that he might add new beauty to his own work from  what he had learned.    Several years passed by, and at last the brothers were allowed to  return to their convent home of San Dominico at Fiesole, and there they  lived peaceably for a long time. We cannot tell exactly what pictures  our painter-monk painted during those peaceful years, but we know he  must have been looking out with wise, seeing eyes, drinking in all the  beauty that was spread around him.    At his feet lay Florence, with its towers and palaces, the Arno running  through it like a silver thread, and beyond, the purple of the Tuscan  hills. All around on the sheltered hillside were green vines and  fruit-trees, olives and cypresses, fields flaming in spring with  scarlet anemones or golden with great yellow tulips, and hedges of  rose-bushes covered with clusters of pink blossoms. No wonder, then,  such beauty sunk into his heart, and we see in his pictures the pure  fresh colour of the spring flowers, with no shadow of dark or evil  things.    Soon the fame of the painter began to be whispered outside the convent  walls, and reached the ears of Cosimo da Medici, one of the powerful  rulers of Florence. He offered the monks a new home, and, when they  were settled in the convent of San Marco in Florence, he invited Fra  Angelico to fresco the walls.    One by one the heavenly pictures were painted upon the walls of the  cells and cloister of the new home. How the brothers must have crowded  round to see each new fresco as it was finished, and how anxious they  would be to see which picture was to be near their own particular bed.  In all the frescoes, whether he painted the gentle Virgin bending  before the angel messenger, or tried to show the glory of the ascended  Lord, the artist-monk would always introduce one or more of the  convent's special saints, which made the brothers feel that the  pictures were their very own. Fra Angelico had a kind word and smile  for all the brothers. He was never impatient, and no one ever saw him  angry, for he was as humble and gentle as the saints whose pictures he  loved to paint.    It is told of him, too, that he never took a brush or pencil in his  hand without a prayer that his work might be to the glory of God. Often  when he painted the sufferings of our Lord, the tears would be seen  running down his cheeks and almost blinding his eyes.    There is an old legend which tells of a certain monk who, when he was  busily illuminating a page of his missal, was called away to do some  service for the poor. He went unwillingly, the legend says, for he  longed to put the last touches to the holy picture he was painting; but  when he returned, lo! he found his work finished by angel hands.    Often when we look at some of Fra Angelico's pictures we are reminded  of this legend, and feel that he too might have been helped by those  same angel hands. Did they indeed touch his eyes that he might catch  glimpses of a Heaven where saints were swinging their golden censers,  and white-robed angels danced in the flowery meadows of Paradise? We  cannot tell; but this we know, that no other painter has ever shown us  such a glory of heavenly things.    Best of all, the angel-painter loved to paint pictures of the life of  our Lord; and in the picture I have shown you, you will see the tender  care with which he has drawn the head of the Infant Jesus with His  little golden halo, the Madonna in her robe of purest blue, holding the  Baby close in her arms, St. Joseph the guardian walking at the side,  and all around the flowers and trees which he loved so well in the  quiet home of Fiesole.    He did not care for fame or power, this dreamy painter of angels, and  when the Pope invited him to Rome to paint the walls of a chapel there,  he thought no more of the glory and honour than if he was but called  upon to paint another cell at San Marco.    But when the Pope had seen what this quiet monk could do, he called the  artist to him.    'A man who can paint such pictures,' he said, 'must be a good man, and  one who will do well whatever he undertakes. Will you, then, do other  work for me, and become my Archbishop at Florence?' But the painter was  startled and dismayed.    'I cannot teach or preach or govern men,' he said, 'I can but use my  gift of painting for the glory of God. Let me rather be as I am, for it  is safer to obey than to rule.'    But though he would not take this honour himself, he told the Pope of a  friend of his, a humble brother, Fra Antonino, at the convent of San  Marco, who was well fitted to do the work. So the Pope took the  painter's advice, and the choice was so wise and good, that to this day  the Florentine people talk lovingly of their good bishop Antonino.    It was while he was at work in Rome that Fra Angelico died, so his body  does not rest in his own beloved Florence. But if his body lies in  Rome, his gentle spirit still seems to hover around the old convent of  San Marco, and there we learn to know and love him best. Little wonder  that in after ages they looked upon him almost as a saint, and gave him  the title of 'Beato,' or the blessed angel-painter.        MASACCIO    It must have been about the same time when Fra Angelico was covering  the walls of San Marco with his angel pictures, that a very different  kind of painter was working in the Carmine church in Florence.    This was no gentle, refined monk, but just an ordinary man of the  world--an awkward, good-natured person, who, as long as he had pictures  to paint, cared for little else. Why, he would even forget to ask for  payment when his work was done; and as to taking care of his clothes,  or trying to keep himself tidy, that was a thing he never thought of!    What trouble his mother must have had with him when he was a boy! It  was no use sending him on an errand, he would forget it before he had  gone a hundred yards, and he was so careless and untidy that it was  enough to make any one lose patience with him. But only let him have a  pencil and a smooth surface on which to draw, and he was a different  boy.    It is said that even now, in the little town of Castello San Giovanni,  some eighteen miles from Florence, where Tommaso was born, there are  still some wonderfully good figures to be seen, drawn by him when he  was quite a little boy. Certainly there was no carelessness and nothing  untidy about his work.    As the boy grew older all his longings would turn towards Florence, the  beautiful city where there was everything to learn and to see, and so  he was sent to become a pupil in the studio of Masolino, a great  Florentine painter. But though his drawings improved, his careless  habits continued the same.    'There goes Tommaso the painter,' the people would say, watching the  big awkward figure passing through the streets on his way to work.  'Truly he pays but little heed to his appearance. Look but at his  untidy hair and the holes in his boots.'    'Ay, indeed!' another would answer; 'and yet it is said if only people  paid him all they owed he would have gold enough and to spare. But what  cares he so long as he has his paints and brushes? \"Masaccio\" would be  a fitter name for him than Tommaso.'    So the name Masaccio, or Ugly Tom, came to be that by which the big  awkward painter was known. But no one thinks of the unkind meaning of  the nickname now, for Masaccio is honoured as one of the great names in  the history of Art.    This painter, careless of many things, cared with all his heart and  soul for the work he had chosen to do. It seemed to him that painters  had always failed to make their pictures like living things. The  pictures they painted were flat, not round as a figure should be, and  very often the feet did not look as if they were standing on the ground  at all, but pointed downwards as if they were hanging in the air.    So he worked with light and shadow and careful drawing until the  figures he drew looked rounded instead of flat, and their feet were  planted firmly on the ground. His models were taken from the ordinary  Florentine youths whom he saw daily in the studio, but he drew them as  no one had drawn "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5307"],[0,"The Letters of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart — Volume 01 (#4)"],[1,"una.--Subito dopo  pranzo giuochiamo a Potsch [Boccia].

[FOOTNOTE: \"of the same kind. Excuse my  writing so badly, but the reason is that I have a bit of a headache  myself.\"]    Haydn's twelfth minuet, which you sent me, pleases me very much; you  have composed an inimitable bass for it, and without the slightest  fault. I do beg that you will often exercise yourself in such things.  Mamma must not forget to see that the guns are both polished up. Tell me  how Master Canary is? Does he still sing? and still whistle? Do you know  why I am thinking about the canary? Because we have one in our ante-room  that chirps out a G sharp just like ours. [Footnote: Mozart was  extremely fond of animals, and later in life had always birds in his  room.] A propos, Herr Johannes [Hagenauer], no doubt, received the  letter of congratulation which we intended to write to him? But if he  has not got it, I will tell him myself, when we meet in Salzburg, what  ought to have been in it. Yesterday we wore our new clothes; we were as  handsome as angels. My kind regards to Nandl; she must not fail to pray  diligently for me.    Jomelli's opera is to be given on the 30th. We saw the king and queen at  mass in the court chapel at Portici, and we also saw Vesuvius. Naples is  beautiful, but as crowded with people as Vienna or Paris. As for London  and Naples, I think that in point of insolence on the part of the people  Naples almost surpasses London; because here the lazzaroni have their  regular head or leader, who receives twenty-five ducati d'argento  monthly from the king for keeping the lazzaroni in order.    Madame de' Amicis sings in the opera--we were there. Caffaro is to  compose the second opera, Ciccio di Majo the third, but who is to  compose the fourth is not yet known. Be sure you go regularly to  Mirabell, to hear the Litanies, and listen to the \"Regina Coeli\" or the  \"Salve Regina,\" and sleep sound, and take care to have no evil dreams.  My most transcendent regards to Herr von Schiedenhofen--tralaliera!  tralaliera! Tell him to learn the repetition minuet on the piano, to be  sure to DO so, and DO not let him forget it. He must DO this in order  to DO me the favor to let me accompany him some day or other. DO give my  best compliments to all my friends, and DO continue to live happily, and  DO not die, but DO live on, that you may be able to DO another letter  for me, and I DO one for you, and thus we shall go on DOING till we can  DO something worth DOING; but I am one of those who will go on DOING  till all DOINGS are at an end.

Madame de' Amicis sings incomparably, and so does Aprile,  who used to sing at Milan. The dancing is miserably pretentious. The  theatre beautiful. The King has been brought up in the rough Neapolitan  fashion, and at the opera always stands on a stool, so that he may look  a little taller than the Queen, who is beautiful and so gracious, for  she bowed to me in the most condescending manner no less than six times  on the Molo.        15.
