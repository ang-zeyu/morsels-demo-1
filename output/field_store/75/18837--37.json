[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5113"],[0,"The Confessions of a Beachcomber (#4)"],[1,"it all was that the artificial emotions  of the town had been, haply, abandoned! The blood tingled with keen  appreciation of the crispness, the cleanliness of the air. We had won  disregard of all the bother and contradictions, the vanities and  absurdities of the toilful, wayward, human world, and had acquired a  glorious sense of irresponsibleness and independence.    This--this was our life we were beginning to live--our very own life; not  life hampered and restricted by the wills, wishes and whims of others;  unencumbered by the domineering wisdom, unembarrassed by the formal  courtesies of the crowd.    September and the gin-gee, the quaint, grey-barked, soft-wooded tree with  broad, rough, sage-green leaves, and florets massed in clumps to resemble  sunflowers, was in all its pride, attracting relays of honey-imbibing  birds during the day, and at night dozens of squeaking flying-foxes.  Within a few yards of high-water stands a flame-tree (ERYTHRINA INDICA)  the \"bingum\" of the blacks. Devoid of leaves in this leafy month, the  bingum arrays itself in a robe of royal red. All birds and manner of  birds, and butterflies and bees and beetles, which have regard for colour  and sweetness come hither to feast. Sulphur-crested cockatoos sail down  upon the red raiment of the tree, and tear from it shreds until all the  grass is ruddy with refuse, and their snowy breasts stained as though  their feast was of blood instead of colourless nectar. For many days here  is a scene of a perpetual banquet--a noisy, cheerful, frolicsome revel.  Cockatoos scream with excitement and gladness; honey-eaters whistle and  call; drongos chatter and scold the rest of the banqueters; the tiny  sun-bird twitters feeble protests; bees and beetles maintain a murmurous  soothful sound, a drowsy blending of hum and buzz from the rising of the  sun until the going down thereof.    The dark compactness of the jungle, the steadfast but disorderly array of  the forest, the blotches of verdant grass, the fringe of yellow-flowered  hibiscus and the sapful native cabbage, give way in turn to the greys and  yellows of the sand in alternate bands. The slowly-heaving sea trailing  the narrowest flounce of lace on the beach, the dainty form of Purtaboi,  and the varying tones of great Australia beyond combine to complete the  scene, and to confirm the thought that here is the ideal spot, the freest  spot, the spot where dreams may harden into realities, where unvexed  peace may smile.    There is naught to remind of the foetidness, the blare and glare of the  streets. None of        \"The weariness, the fever and the fret,      There, where men sit and hear each other groan.\"    You may follow up the creeks until they become miniature ravines, or  broaden out into pockets with precipitous sides, where twilight reigns  perpetually, and where sweet soft gases are generated by innumerable  plants, and distilled from the warm moist soil. How grateful and  revivifying! Among the half-lit crowded groves might not another Medea  gather enchanted herbs such as \"did renew old Aeson.\"    Past the rocky horn of Brammo Bay, another crescent indents the base of  the hill. Exposed to the north-east breeze, the turmoil of innumerable  gales has torn tons upon tons of coral from the out-lying reef, and cast  up the debris, with tinkling chips and fragments of shells, on the sand  for the sun and the tepid rains to bleach into dazzling whiteness. The  coral drift has swept up among the dull grey rocks and made a ridge  beneath the pendant branches of the trees, as if to establish a contrast  between the sombre tints of the jungle and the blueness of the sea.  Midway along the curve of vegetation a bingum flaunts its mantle--a  single daub of demonstrative colouring. Away to the north stand out the  Barnard Islands, and the island-like headland of Double-Point.    Rocky walls and ledges intersected by narrow clefts in which the sea  boils, gigantic masses of detached granite split and weathered into  strange shapes and corniced and bridged at high water-mark by oysters,  bold escarpments and medleys of huge boulders, extend along the weather  side. No landing, except in the calmest weather, is possible. To gain a  sandy beach, the south-east end of the island, passing through a deep  channel separating the rocky islet of Wooln-garin, must be turned.  Although there are no great cliffs, no awesome precipices on the weather  side, the bluff rocks present many grotesque features, and the foliage is  for the most part wildly luxuriant.    From what has been already said, it may be gleaned that in the opinion of  the most interested person the island is gilt-edged. So indeed it is, in  fact, when certain natural conditions consequent on the presence of coral  are fulfilled. A phenomenally high tide deposited upon the rocks a slimy,  fragile organism of the sea, in incomprehensible myriads which, drying,  adhered smoothly in true alignment. With the sun at the proper angle  there appeared, as far as the irregularity of the coast line permitted, a  shining band, broken only where the face of the rock was uneven and  detached--a zone of gold bestowed upon the island by the amorous sea. But  on the beach the slime which transformed the grey and brown rocks was  nothing but an inconsistent, dirty, grey-green, crisp, ill-smelling  streak, that haply vanished in a couple of days. As I see less of the  weather side than I do of the beach, I argue to myself that it is nearer  perfection to be minus a streak of dirt than plus a golden edge.    At no season of the year is the island fragrantless. The prevailing  perception may be of lush grasses mingled with the soft odour of their  frail flowers; or the resin and honey of blossoming bloodwoods; or the  essence from myriads of other eucalyptus leaves massaged by the winds.  The incomparable beach-loving calophyllums yield a profuse but tender  fragrance reminiscent of English meadow-sweet, and the flowers of a  vigorous trailer (CANAVILA OBTUSIFOLIA), for ever exploring the bare sand  at high-water mark, resembles the sweet-pea in form and perfume. The  white cedar (MELIA COMPOSITA) is a welcome and not unworthy substitute in  appearance and perfume for English lilac. The aromatic pandanus and many  varieties of acacia, each has its appointed time and season; while at odd  intervals the air is saturated with the rich and far-spreading incense of  the melaleuca, and for many weeks together with the honeyed excellence of  the swamp mahogany (TRISTANIA SUAVOSLENS) and the over-rich cloyness of  the cockatoo apple (CAREYA AUSTRALIS). Strong and spicy are the odours of  the plants and trees that gather on the edge of and crowd in the jungle,  the so-called native ginger, nutmeg, quandong, milkwood, bean-tree, the  kirri-cue of the blacks (EUPOMATIA LAURINA), koie-yan (FARADAYA  SPLENDIDA), with its great white flowers and snowy fruit, and many  others. Hoya, heavy and indolent, trails across and dangles from the  rocks; the river mangrove dispenses its sweetness in an unexpected  locality; and from the heart of the jungle come wafts of warm breath,  which, mingling with exhalation from foliage and flower, is diffused  broadcast. The odour of the jungle is definite--earthy somewhat, but of  earth clean, wholesome and moist--the smell of moss, fern and fungus  blended with balsam, spice and sweetness.    Many a time, home-returning at night--when the black contours of the  island loomed up in the distance against the pure tropic sky tremulous  with myriads of unsullied stars--has its tepid fragrance drifted across  the water as a salutation and a greeting. It has long been a fancy of  mine that the island has a distinctive odour, soft and pliant, rich and  vigorous. Other mixtures of forest and jungle may smell as strong, but  none has the rare blend which I recognise and gloat over whensoever,  after infrequent absences for a day or two, I return to accept of it in  grateful sniffs. In such a fervid and encouraging clime distillation is  continuous and prodigious. Heat and moisture and a plethora of raw  material, leaves, flowers, soft, sappy and fragrant woods, growing grass  and moist earth, these are the essential elements for the manufacture of  ethereal and soul-soothing odours suggestive of tangible flavours.    I know of but one particular plant that is absolutely repellent. Its  large flowers are of vivid gold, pure and refined; the unmixed odour is  obscene. A creeper of the jungle bears small yellow flowers (slightly  resembling those of the mango, save that they are produced in frail loose  cymes instead of on vigorous panicles), the excessive sweetness of which  approaches nauseousness. But its essence mingles with the rest, and the  compound is singularly rich and acceptable.    On sandy stretches and along the deltas of the creeks are fragrant,  gigantic \"spider lilies\" (CRINIUM). I do not pretend to catalogue  botanically all the plants that contribute to the specific odour of the  island. I cannot address them individually in scientific phraseology,  though with all I am on terms of easy familiarity, the outcome of  seasoned admiration. They please by the form and colour of their  blossoms, and ring ever-recurring and timeful changes, so that month by  month we enjoy the progress of the perfumes, the blending of some, the  individual excellence of others. In endeavouring to convey to the unelect  an impression of their variety and acceptableness, am I not but  discharging a debt of gratitude?    As far as I am aware, but four or five epiphytal orchids add to the  scents of the island; and as they have not Christian names, their pagan  titles must suffice--CYMBIDIUM SUAVE, ERIA FITZALANI, BULBOPHYLLUM  BAILEYI, DENDROBIUM TERETIFOLIUM and D. UNDULATUM. The latter is not  commonly credited with perfume; but when it grows in great unmolested  masses its contribution is pleasant, if not very decided. The pretty "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/512"],[0,"Mosses from an Old Manse, and Other Stories (#4)"],[1,"not be.\"    \"I submit,\" replied she calmly. \"And, Aylmer, I shall quaff whatever  draught you bring me; but it will be on the same principle that would  induce me to take a dose of poison if offered by your hand.\"    \"My noble wife,\" said Aylmer, deeply moved, \"I knew not the height and  depth of your nature until now. Nothing shall be concealed. Know, then,  that this crimson hand, superficial as it seems, has clutched its grasp  into your being with a strength of which I had no previous conception.  I have already administered agents powerful enough to do aught except  to change your entire physical system. Only one thing remains to be  tried. If that fail us we are ruined.\"    \"Why did you hesitate to tell me this?\" asked she.    \"Because, Georgiana,\" said Aylmer, in a low voice, \"there is danger.\"    \"Danger? There is but one danger--that this horrible stigma shall be  left upon my cheek!\" cried Georgiana. \"Remove it, remove it, whatever  be the cost, or we shall both go mad!\"    \"Heaven knows your words are too true,\" said Aylmer, sadly. \"And now,  dearest, return to your boudoir. In a little while all will be tested.\"    He conducted her back and took leave of her with a solemn tenderness  which spoke far more than his words how much was now at stake. After  his departure Georgiana became rapt in musings. She considered the  character of Aylmer, and did it completer justice than at any previous  moment. Her heart exulted, while it trembled, at his honorable love--so  pure and lofty that it would accept nothing less than perfection nor  miserably make itself contented with an earthlier nature than he had  dreamed of. She felt how much more precious was such a sentiment than  that meaner kind which would have borne with the imperfection for her  sake, and have been guilty of treason to holy love by degrading its  perfect idea to the level of the actual; and with her whole spirit she  prayed that, for a single moment, she might satisfy his highest and  deepest conception. Longer than one moment she well knew it could not  be; for his spirit was ever on the march, ever ascending, and each  instant required something that was beyond the scope of the instant  before.    The sound of her husband's footsteps aroused her. He bore a crystal  goblet containing a liquor colorless as water, but bright enough to be  the draught of immortality. Aylmer was pale; but it seemed rather the  consequence of a highly-wrought state of mind and tension of spirit  than of fear or doubt.    \"The concoction of the draught has been perfect,\" said he, in answer to  Georgiana's look. \"Unless all my science have deceived me, it cannot  fail.\"    \"Save on your account, my dearest Aylmer,\" observed his wife, \"I might  wish to put off this birthmark of mortality by relinquishing mortality  itself in preference to any other mode. Life is but a sad possession to  those who have attained precisely the degree of moral advancement at  which I stand. Were I weaker and blinder it might be happiness. Were I  stronger, it might be endured hopefully. But, being what I find myself,  methinks I am of all mortals the most fit to die.\"    \"You are fit for heaven without tasting death!\" replied her husband  \"But why do we speak of dying? The draught cannot fail. Behold its  effect upon this plant.\"    On the window seat there stood a geranium diseased with yellow  blotches, which had overspread all its leaves. Aylmer poured a small  quantity of the liquid upon the soil in which it grew. In a little  time, when the roots of the plant had taken up the moisture, the  unsightly blotches began to be extinguished in a living verdure.    \"There needed no proof,\" said Georgiana, quietly. \"Give me the goblet I  joyfully stake all upon your word.\"    \"Drink, then, thou lofty creature!\" exclaimed Aylmer, with fervid  admiration. \"There is no taint of imperfection on thy spirit. Thy  sensible frame, too, shall soon be all perfect.\"    She quaffed the liquid and returned the goblet to his hand.    \"It is grateful,\" said she with a placid smile. \"Methinks it is like  water from a heavenly fountain; for it contains I know not what of  unobtrusive fragrance and deliciousness. It allays a feverish thirst  that had parched me for many days. Now, dearest, let me sleep. My  earthly senses are closing over my spirit like the leaves around the  heart of a rose at sunset.\"    She spoke the last words with a gentle reluctance, as if it required  almost more energy than she could command to pronounce the faint and  lingering syllables. Scarcely had they loitered through her lips ere  she was lost in slumber. Aylmer sat by her side, watching her aspect  with the emotions proper to a man the whole value of whose existence  was involved in the process now to be tested. Mingled with this mood,  however, was the philosophic investigation characteristic of the man of  science. Not the minutest symptom escaped him. A heightened flush of  the cheek, a slight irregularity of breath, a quiver of the eyelid, a  hardly perceptible tremor through the frame,--such were the details  which, as the moments passed, he wrote down in his folio volume.  Intense thought had set its stamp upon every previous page of that  volume, but the thoughts of years were all concentrated upon the last.    While thus employed, he failed not to gaze often at the fatal hand, and  not without a shudder. Yet once, by a strange and unaccountable impulse  he pressed it with his lips. His spirit recoiled, however, in the very  act, and Georgiana, out of the midst of her deep sleep, moved uneasily  and murmured as if in remonstrance. Again Aylmer resumed his watch. Nor  was it without avail. The crimson hand, which at first had been  strongly visible upon the marble paleness of Georgiana's cheek, now  grew more faintly outlined. She remained not less pale than ever; but  the birthmark with every breath that came and went, lost somewhat of  its former distinctness. Its presence had been awful; its departure was  more awful still. Watch the stain of the rainbow fading out the sky,  and you will know how that mysterious symbol passed away.    \"By Heaven! it is well-nigh gone!\" said Aylmer to himself, in almost  irrepressible ecstasy. \"I can scarcely trace it now. Success! success!  And now it is like the faintest rose color. The lightest flush of blood  across her cheek would overcome it. But she is so pale!\"    He drew aside the window curtain and suffered the light of natural day  to fall into the room and rest upon her cheek. At the same time he  heard a gross, hoarse chuckle, which he had long known as his servant  Aminadab's expression of delight.    \"Ah, clod! ah, earthly mass!\" cried Aylmer, laughing in a sort of  frenzy, \"you have served me well! Matter and spirit--earth and  heaven--have both done their part in this! Laugh, thing of the senses!  You have earned the right to laugh.\"    These exclamations broke Georgiana's sleep. She slowly unclosed her  eyes and gazed into the mirror which her husband had arranged for that  purpose. A faint smile flitted over her lips when she recognized how  barely perceptible was now that crimson hand which had once blazed  forth with such disastrous brilliancy as to scare away all their  happiness. But then her eyes sought Aylmer's face with a trouble and  anxiety that he could by no means account for.    \"My poor Aylmer!\" murmured she.    \"Poor? Nay, richest, happiest, most favored!\" exclaimed he. \"My  peerless bride, it is successful! You are perfect!\"    \"My poor Aylmer,\" she repeated, with a more than human tenderness, \"you  have aimed loftily; you have done nobly. Do not repent that with so  high and pure a feeling, you have rejected the best the earth could  offer. Aylmer, dearest Aylmer, I am dying!\"    Alas! it was too true! The fatal hand had grappled with the mystery of  life, and was the bond by which an angelic spirit kept itself in union  with a mortal frame. As the last crimson tint of the birthmark--that  sole token of human imperfection--faded from her cheek, the parting  breath of the now perfect woman passed into the atmosphere, and her  soul, lingering a moment near her husband, took its heavenward flight.  Then a hoarse, chuckling laugh was heard again! Thus ever does the  gross fatality of earth exult in its invariable triumph over the  immortal essence which, in this dim sphere of half development, demands  the completeness of a higher state. Yet, had Alymer reached a  profounder wisdom, he need not thus have flung away the happiness which  would have woven his mortal life of the selfsame texture with the  celestial. The momentary circumstance was too strong for him; he failed  to look beyond the shadowy scope of time, and, living once for all in  eternity, to find the perfect future in the present.        YOUNG GOODMAN BROWN    Young Goodman Brown came forth at sunset into the street at Salem  village; but put his head back, after crossing the threshold, to  exchange a parting kiss with his young wife. And Faith, as the wife was  aptly named, thrust her own pretty head into the street, letting the  wind play with the pink ribbons of her cap while she called to Goodman  Brown.    \"Dearest heart,\" whispered she, softly and rather sadly, when her lips  were close to his ear, \"prithee put off your journey until sunrise and  sleep in your own bed to-night. A lone woman is troubled with such  dreams and such thoughts that she's afeard of herself sometimes. Pray  tarry with me this night, dear husband, of all nights in the year.\"    \"My love and my Faith,\" replied young Goodman Brown, \"of all nights in  the year, this one night must I tarry away from thee. My journey, as  thou callest it, forth and back again, must needs be done 'twixt now  and sunrise. What, my sweet, pretty wife, dost thou doubt me already,  and we but three months married?\"    \"Then God bless you!\" said Faith, with the pink ribbons; \"and may you  find all well when you come back.\"    \"A"]]]
