[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4671"],[0,"The Story of the Pony Express (#4)"],[1,"trail crossed into  Nebraska near Rock Creek and pushed on through Big Sandy and Liberty  Farm, to Thirty-two-mile Creek. From thence it passed over the prairie  divide to the Platte River, the valley of which was followed to Fort  Kearney. This route had already been made famous by the Mormons when  they journeyed to Utah in 1847. It had also been followed by many of the  California gold-seekers in 1848-49 and by Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston  and his army when they marched west from Fort Leavenworth to suppress  the \"Mormon War\" of 1857-58.    For about three hundred miles out of Fort Kearney, the trail followed  the prairies; for two thirds of this distance, it clung to the south  bank of the Platte, passing through Plum Creek and Midway[3]. At  Cottonwood Springs the junction of the North and South branches of the  Platte was reached. From here the course moved steadily westward,  through Fremont's Springs, O'Fallon's Bluffs, Alkali, Beauvais Ranch,  and Diamond Springs to Julesburg, on the South fork of the Platte. Here  the stream was forded and the rider then followed the course of Lodge  Pole Creek in a northwesterly direction to Thirty Mile Ridge. Thence he  journeyed to Mud Springs, Court-House Rock, Chimney Rock, and Scott's  Bluffs to Fort Laramie. From this point he passed through the foot-hills  to the base of the Rockies, then over the mountains through South Pass  and to Fort Bridger. Then to Salt Lake City, Camp Floyd, Ruby Valley,  Mountain Wells, across the Humboldt River in Nevada to Bisbys', Carson  City, and to Placerville, California; thence to Folsom and Sacramento.  Here the mail was taken by a fast steamer down the Sacramento River to  San Francisco.    A large part of this route traversed the wildest regions of the  Continent. Along the entire course there were but four military posts  and they were strung along at intervals of from two hundred and fifty to  three hundred and fifty miles from each other. Over most of the journey  there were only small way stations to break the awful monotony.  Topographically, the trail covered nearly six hundred miles of rolling  prairie, intersected here and there by streams fringed with timber. The  nature of the mountainous regions, the deserts, and alkali plains as  avenues of horseback travel is well understood. Throughout these areas  the men and horses had to endure such risks as rocky chasms, snow  slides, and treacherous streams, as well as storms of sand and snow. The  worst part of the journey lay between Salt Lake City and Sacramento,  where for several hundred miles the route ran through a desert, much of  it a bed of alkali dust where no living creature could long survive. It  was not merely these dangers of dire exposure and privation that  threatened, for wherever the country permitted of human life, Indians  abounded. From the Platte River valley westward, the old route sped over  by the Pony Express is today substantially that of the Union Pacific and  Southern Pacific Railroads.    In California, the region most benefited by the express, the opening of  the line was likewise awaited with the keenest anticipation. Of course  there had been at the outset a few dissenting opinions, the gist of the  opposing sentiment being that the Indians would make the operation of  the route impossible. One newspaper went so far as to say that it was  \"Simply inviting slaughter upon all the foolhardy young men who had been  engaged as riders\". But the California spirit would not down. A vast  majority of the people favored the enterprise and clamored for it; and  before the express had been long in operation, all classes were united  in the conviction that they could not do without it.    At San Francisco and Sacramento, then the two most important towns in  the far West, great preparations were made to celebrate the first  outgoing and incoming mails. On April 3rd, at the same hour the express  started from St. Joseph[4], the eastbound mail was placed on board a  steamer at San Francisco and sent up the river, accompanied by an  enthusiastic delegation of business men. On the arrival of the pouch and  its escort at Sacramento, the capital city, they were greeted with the  blare of bands, the firing of guns, and the clanging of gongs. Flags  were unfurled and floral decorations lined the streets. That night the  first rider for the East, Harry Roff, left the city on a white broncho.  He rode the first twenty miles in fifty-nine minutes, changing mounts  once. He next took a fresh horse at Folsom and pushed on fifty-five  miles farther to Placerville. Here he was relieved by \"Boston,\" who  carried the mail to Friday Station, crossing the Sierras en route. Next  came Sam Hamilton who rode through Geneva, Carson City, Dayton, and  Reed's Station to Fort Churchill, seventy-five miles in all. This point,  one hundred and eighty-five miles out of Sacramento had been reached in  fifteen hours and twenty minutes, in spite of the Sierra Divide where  the snow drifts were thirty feet deep and where the Company had to keep  a drove of pack mules moving in order to keep the passageway clear. From  Fort Churchill into Ruby Valley went H. J. Faust; from Ruby Valley to  Shell Creek the courier was \"Josh\" Perkins; then came Jim Gentry who  carried the mail to Deep Creek, and he was followed by \"Let\" Huntington  who pushed on to Simpson's Springs. From Simpson's to Camp Floyd rode  John Fisher, and from the latter place Major Egan carried the mail into  Salt Lake City, arriving April 7, at 11:45 P. M.[5] The obstacles to  fast travel had been numerous because of snow in the mountains, and  stormy spring weather with its attendant discomfort and bad going. Yet  the schedule had been maintained, and the last seventy-five miles into  Salt Lake City had been ridden in five hours and fifteen minutes.    At that time Placerville and Carson City were the terminals of a local  telegraph line. News had been flashed back from Carson on April 4 that  the rider had passed that point safely. After that came an anxious wait  until April 12 when the arrival of the west-bound express announced that  all was well.    The first trip of the Pony Express westbound from St. Joseph to  Sacramento was made in nine days and twenty-three hours. East-bound, the  run was covered in eleven days and twelve hours. The average time of  these two performances was barely half that required by the Butterfield  stage over the Southern route. The pony had clipped ten full days from  the schedule of its predecessor, and shown that it could keep its  schedule--which was as follows:      From St. Joseph to Salt Lake City--124 hours.      From Salt Lake City to Carson City--218 hours, from starting point.      From Carson City to Sacramento--232 hours, from starting point.      From Sacramento to San Francisco--240 hours, from starting point.    From the very first trip, expressions of genuine appreciation of the new  service were shown all along the line. The first express which reached  Salt Lake City eastbound on the night of April 7, led the Deseret News,  the leading paper of that town to say that: \"Although a telegraph is  very desirable, we feel well-satisfied with this achievement for, the  present.\" Two days later, the first west-bound express bound from St.  Joseph reached the Mormon capital. Oddly enough this rider carried news  of an act to amend a bill just proposed in the United States Senate,  providing that Utah be organized into Nevada Territory under the name  and leadership of the latter[6]. Many of the Mormons, like numerous  persons in California, had at first believed the Pony Express an  impossibility, but now that it had been demonstrated wholly feasible,  they were delighted with its success, whether it brought them good news  or bad; for it had brought Utah within six days of the Missouri River  and within seven days of Washington City. Prior to this, under the old  stage coach regime, the people of that territory had been accustomed to  receive their news of the world from six weeks to three months old.    Probably no greater demonstrations were ever held in California cities  than when the first incoming express arrived. Its schedule having been  announced in the daily papers a week ahead, the people were ready with  their welcome. At Sacramento, as when the pony mail had first come up  from San Francisco, practically the whole town turned out. Stores were  closed and business everywhere suspended. State officials and other  citizens of prominence addressed great crowds in commemoration of the  wonderful achievement. Patriotic airs were played and sung and no  attempt was made to check the merry-making of the populace. After a  hurried stop to deliver local mail, the pouch was rushed aboard the fast  sailing steamer Antelope, and the trip down the stream begun. Although  San Francisco was not reached until the dead of night, the arrival of  the express mail was the signal for a hilarious reception. Whistles were  blown, bells jangled, and the California Band turned out. The city fire  department, suddenly aroused by the uproar, rushed into the street,  expecting to find a conflagration, but on recalling the true state of  affairs, the firemen joined in with spirit. The express courier was then  formally escorted by a huge procession from the steamship dock to the  office of the Alta Telegraph, the official Western terminal, and the  momentous trip had ended.    The first Pony Express from St. Joseph brought a message of  congratulation from President Buchanan to Governor Downey of California,  which was first telegraphed to the Missouri River town. It also brought  one or two official government communications, some New York, Chicago,  and St. Louis newspapers, a few bank drafts, and some business letters  addressed to banks and commercial houses in San Francisco--about  eighty-five pieces of mail in all[7]. And it had brought news from the  East only nine days on the road."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4675"],[0,"The Sea-Witch; Or, The African Quadroon: A Story of the Slave Coast (#4)"],[1,"this startling gale; he  never once left his post, every inch of the vessel seemed under his eye,  and not the least trifle of duty was for a moment forgotten. If  possible, he was more particular than usual that his orders in the  smallest item were strictly observed, and thus with his iron will and  strong intelligence he mastered every contingency of the hour, imparting  that indispensable confidence among his people so requisite to perfect  control. There was a firmness now expressed in the compressed lips, and  a sternness in the eye, that had not before been manifested, while there  was a breathing of authority in his smallest order.    In an instant more the scene was changed! With terrific violence the  vessel flew up in the wind with the rapidity of thought, and a report  like that of a score of cannons fired at the same moment, was heard  above the roar of the winds.    \"What lubberly trick is this?\" shouted the captain, fiercely, to the old  tar who held his station at the wheel, and on whose faithfulness  everything depended.    \"The wheel rope has parted on the larboard side, your honor,\" was the  reply.    \"That is no man's fault,\" said his commander. \"Bear a hand here, Mr.  Faulkner, and bend on a fresh wheel rope. Be lively; sir, be lively!\"    The sails had been blown from the bolt-ropes, in an instant of time, and  the vessel now lay wallowing in the sea. Now once more was seen the  power of discipline and the coolness of the young commander, whose word  was law in that floating community. Fifty voices were raised in shouts  above the storm, suggesting this expedient and that, but that agile  figure, which we have already described, sprang lightly into the mizzen  shrouds, and with a voice that was heard by every soul on board the \"Sea  Witch,\" shouted sternly:    \"Silence in the ship!\"    Not a voice was heard, and every man quietly awaited his order, looking  abashed that there had been a tongue heard save his who had the right  alone to speak.    \"Cast the gasket off the foot of the fore and aft foresail.\"    \"Ay, ay, sir!\" responded the mate, who having secured the rudder, now  hastened by his commander, followed by a dozen hands, to execute the  order.    \"Haul the sheet to port!\"    \"Ay, ay, sir!\"    \"Belay that!\"    As the vessel felt the power of the canvass thus opportunely loosed and  brought to bear, she gradually paid off before the wind, and once more  had steerage way. Another foresail was now bent, and this time  double-reefed, the foretopsail, too, was bent, close-reefed and furled,  while the fore and aft foresail was once more stowed, leaving the \"Sea  Witch\" to scud under double-reefed foresail.    Five days of steady blow continued before the vessel could again show  more than a small portion of her canvass. Then the wind once more hauled  to the northwest, and the \"Sea Witch\" donned heir fore and aft rig on  all her masts steering close-hauled again due cast, until the lofty  headlands of the Cape de Verds hove gradually in sight, and the fleet  clipper craft made her anchorage in the harbor of Port Praya.    The \"Sea Witch,\" whatever her business in this harbor, seemed able to  transact it without venturing inside the forts, or taking stronger  moorings than a single anchor could afford her. At this she rode with  mysterious quiet. Not a soul of the full complement of men on board were  visible from the shore; now and then perhaps the head of some taller  hand than his fellows might loom up above the bulwarks at the waist, or  a solitary seaman creep quietly aloft to reave a sheet through some  block, or secure some portion of the rigging. The captain scarcely  waited for his land-tackle to hold the vessel before a quarter-boat was  lowered away, and with a half-dozen sturdy fellows as its crew pulled  boldly towards the main landing, where he stepped ashore and  disappeared.    A suspicious eye would have marked the manner in which the sails upon  the \"Sea Witch\" had been secured, and the way in which she was moored.  If need be, three minutes would have covered her with canvass, and  slipping her cable she could in that space of time, had the order been  issued from her quarter deck, have been under way and looking once more  seaward. Whatever her business, it was very clear that promptness,  secrecy, and large precaution were elements of its success.    Nor had these characteristics, which we have named, escaped entire  observation of the people on shore, for at the nearest point of land a  group of idlers were visible, who stood gazing at and discussing the  character of the vessel, while at the same moment her young commander  was seen with his boat's crew pulling back from the landing to his  craft. His business was brief enough, for even now the anchor is once  more away. The gallant ship spreads her broad wings one by one, and  gracefully bending to the power of the breeze, glides, like a fleet  courser, over the fathomless depths of the sea, while the mind that  controls her motions again assumes his reverie on the quarter-deck.          CHAPTER IV.    BRAMBLE PARK.      CHANGING the field of our story from the blue waves to that of land, we  must ask the reader to go back with us for a period of years from that  wherein our story has opened, to the fertile country and  highly-cultivated lands in the neighborhood of Manchester, England. Sir  Robert Bramble's estate was some eight miles from the large  manufacturing town just named, and embraced within its grounds some of  the most delightfully situated spots within a day's ride in any  direction. Parks, gardens, ponds, groves, stables and fine animals; in  short, every accompaniment to a fine English estate. Sir Robert was a  man of not much force of character, had inherited his estates, and had  partly exhausted his income so far as to render a degree of economy  imperatively necessary, a fact which was not calculated to render any  more amiable a naturally irritable disposition.    The family at Bramble Park, as the estate was called, consisted of Sir  Robert and his lady, a weak-minded, but once beautiful woman, and two  sons, Robert and Charles, the eldest at this period some twelve years of  age, the youngest about nine; the usual number of servants, in doors and  out; made up the household. Sir Robert's could hardly be said to be a  very happy household, notwithstanding there seemed to be every element  and requisite to be found there for peaceful domestic happiness; and  perhaps it would have puzzled a casual observer to have ascertained  wherein laid the root of that evil, which, like a poisonous upas, seemed  to spread its branches through the household.    There was a cloud apparently shadowing each face there; there was  constantly some trouble of a domestic character. Sir Robert and Lady  Bramble seemed to be not on the best of terms with each other, and the  servants wore a hang-dog look, as though they expected at any moment to  be called to account for some piece of rascality. There was, however,  one pleasant face in that household, though even that seemed tempered by  sadness; this was the youngest brother, Charles. He was, or rather would  have been, a cheerful, happy boy, but for the malign influence of his  brother Robert, who seemed his opposite in almost everything. Robert was  jealous, irritable and revengeful; Charles was open-hearted, mild and  forgiving. Robert was cruel to both servants and animals; Charles was  kind to all, and a favorite with all; even the dumb animals avoided one  and adhered to the other, instinctively knowing a friend.    Robert was the first born and the favorite with his mother, whom he  ruled literally in all things, while Sir Robert, looking upon him as the  legal heir and representative of his name, of course considered him in a  somewhat different light from that in which he regarded Charles. At  times it seemed as though an evil spirit had taken possession of  Robert's heart, and he delighted in oppressing, domineering over and  abusing his brother, who, though he did not lack for spirit, yet could  never bring it to bear against Robert. He meekly bore his reproaches and  abuse, and even at times had suffered personal chastisement at his hands  without complaint to his parents, rather than irritate both them and  himself by referring to so disagreeable a matter. With a naturally  patient disposition, he suffered much without complaint.    Sir Robert and Lady Bramble seemed blind to the fact that the unbounded  indulgence which they yielded to their eldest child was rendering still  worse a disposition and habit which were already an affliction in  themselves. But Robert was persevering, and would always carry his  point, let it be what it might, teasing and cajoling the mother until  she granted his wishes however absurd they might be. He domineered over  every one, mother, father, servant maids and servant men; he was the  terror of all.    Charles added to his light-heartedness and cheerfulness of spirit, great  agility, and for a boy of his age, remarkable strength, in which matters  Robert was deficient, and here his jealousy found ample scope. Charles,  too, was remarkably apt with his studies, whereas Robert generally ended  his lessons by quarrelling with his tutor, and setting both father and  mother against him, by which reason the worthy who filled that post at  Bramble Park was usually changed at least once in six or eight weeks,  and thus were matters at the period to which we refer. It seemed as  though Robert was never happy unless he was doing some one harm, or  distressing some of the many pet animals about the spacious grounds; in  this latter occupation he passed much of his leisure time, and was a  great adept at the business.    A fine St. Charles spaniel, belonging to Lady Bramble, had one day,  after being teased beyond forbearance by Robert, at last in  self-defence, snapped at and lightly bit him, in revenge for which the"]]]
