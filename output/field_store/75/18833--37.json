But in a short time what consternation there was throughout the city.  When the proud and fond parents attempted to unbutton their children's  dresses, in order to prepare them for bed, not a single costume would  come off. The buttons buttoned again as fast as they were unbuttoned;  even if they pulled out a pin, in it would slip again in a twinkling;  and when a string was untied it tied itself up again into a bowknot. The  parents were dreadfully frightened. But the children were so tired out  they finally let them go to bed in their fancy costumes and thought  perhaps they would come off better in the morning. So Red Riding-hood  went to bed in her little red cloak holding fast to her basket full of  dainties for her grandmother, and Bo-Peep slept with her crook in her  hand.    The children all went to bed readily enough, they were so very  tired, even though they had to go in this strange array. All but the  fairies--they danced and pirouetted and would not be still.    \"We want to swing on the blades of grass,\" they kept saying, \"and play  hide and seek in the lily cups, and take a nap between the leaves of the  roses.\"    The poor charwomen and coal-heavers, whose children the fairies were for  the most part, stared at them in great distress. They did not know  what to do with these radiant, frisky little creatures into which their  Johnnys and their Pollys and Betseys were so suddenly transformed. But  the fairies went to bed quietly enough when daylight came, and were soon  fast asleep.    There was no further trouble till twelve o'clock, when all the children  woke up. Then a great wave of alarm spread over the city. Not one of the  costumes would come off then. The buttons buttoned as fast as they were  unbuttoned; the pins quilted themselves in as fast as they were pulled  out; and the strings flew round like lightning and twisted themselves  into bow-knots as fast as they were untied.    And that was not the worst of it; every one of the children seemed to  have become, in reality, the character which he or she had assumed.    The Mayor's daughter declared she was going to tend her geese out in the  pasture, and the shepherdesses sprang out of their little beds of down,  throwing aside their silken quilts, and cried that they must go out and  watch their sheep. The princesses jumped up from their straw pallets,  and wanted to go to court; and all the rest of them likewise. Poor  little Red Riding-hood sobbed and sobbed because she couldn't go  and carry her basket to her grandmother, and as she didn't have any  grandmother she couldn't go, of course, and her parents were very much  doubled. It was all so mysterious and dreadful. The news spread very  rapidly over the city, and soon a great crowd gathered around the new  Costumer's shop for every one thought he must be responsible for all  this mischief.    The shop door was locked; but they soon battered it down with stones.  When they rushed in the Costumer was not there; he had disappeared with  all his wares. Then they did not know what to do. But it was evident  that they must do something before long for the state of affairs was  growing worse and worse.    The Mayor's little daughter braced her back up against the tapestried  wall, and planted her two feet in their thick shoes firmly. \"I will go  and tend my geese,\" she kept crying. \"I won't eat my breakfast. I won't  go out in the park. I won't go to school. I'm going to tend my geese--I  will, I will, I will!\"    And the princesses trailed their rich trains over the rough unpainted  floors in their parents' poor little huts, and held their crowned heads  very high and demanded to be taken to court. The princesses were mostly  geese-girls when they were their proper selves, and their geese were  suffering, and their poor parents did not know what they were going to  do and they wrung their hands and wept as they gazed on their gorgeously  apparelled children.    Finally the Mayor called a meeting of the Aldermen, and they all  assembled in the City Hall. Nearly every one of them had a son or  a daughter who was a chimney-sweep, or a little watch-girl, or a  shepherdess. They appointed a chairman and they took a great many votes  and contrary votes but they did not agree on anything, until every one  proposed that they consult the Wise Woman. Then they all held up their  hands, and voted to, unanimously.    So the whole board of Aldermen set out, walking by twos, with the Mayor  at their head, to consult the Wise Woman. The Aldermen were all very  fleshy, and carried gold-headed canes which they swung very high at  every step. They held their heads well back, and their chins stiff,  and whenever they met common people they sniffed gently. They were very  imposing.    The Wise Woman lived in a little hut on the outskirts of the city. She  kept a Black Cat, except for her, she was all alone. She was very  old, and had brought up a great many children, and she was considered  remarkably wise.    But when the Aldermen reached her hut and found her seated by the fire,  holding her Black Cat, a new difficulty presented itself. She had always  been quite deaf and people had been obliged to scream as loud as they  could in order to make her hear; but lately she had grown much deafer,  and when the Aldermen attempted to lay the case before her she could  not hear a word. In fact, she was so very deaf that she could not  distinguish a tone below G-sharp. The Aldermen screamed till they were  quite red in the faces, but all to no purpose: none of them could get up  to G-sharp of course.    So the Aldermen all went back, swinging their gold-headed canes, and  they had another meeting in the City Hall. Then they decided to send the  highest Soprano Singer in the church choir to the Wise Woman; she could  sing up to G-sharp just as easy as not. So the high Soprano Singer set  out for the Wise Woman's in the Mayor's coach, and the Aldermen marched  behind, swinging their gold-headed canes.    The High Soprano Singer put her head down close to the Wise Woman's ear,  and sung all about the Christmas Masquerade and the dreadful dilemma  everybody was in, in G-sharp--she even went higher, sometimes, and the  Wise Woman heard every word.    She nodded three times, and every time she nodded she looked wiser.    \"Go home, and give 'em a spoonful of castor-oil, all 'round,\" she piped  up; then she took a pinch of snuff, and wouldn't say any more.    So the Aldermen went home, and every one took a district and marched  through it, with a servant carrying an immense bowl and spoon, and every  child had to take a dose of castor-oil.    But it didn't do a bit of good. The children cried and struggled when  they were forced to take the castor-oil; but, two minutes afterward,  the chimney-sweeps were crying for their brooms, and the princesses  screaming because they couldn't go to court, and the Mayor's daughter,  who had been given a double dose, cried louder and more sturdily: \"I  want to go and tend my geese. I will go and tend my geese.\"    So the Aldermen took the high Soprano Singer, and they consulted the  Wise Woman again. She was taking a nap this time, and the Singer had to  sing up to B-flat before she could wake her. Then she was very cross and  the Black Cat put up his back and spit at the Aldermen.    \"Give 'em a spanking all 'round,\" she snapped out, \"and if that don't  work put 'em to bed without their supper.\"    Then the Aldermen marched back to try that; and all the children in the  city were spanked, and when that didn't do any good they were put to  bed without any supper. But the next morning when they woke up they were  worse than ever.    The Mayor and Aldermen were very indignant, and considered that they  had been imposed upon and insulted. So they set out for the Wise Woman  again, with the high Soprano Singer.    She sang in G-sharp how the Aldermen and the Mayor considered her an  impostor, and did not think she was wise at all, and they wished her to  take her Black Cat and move beyond the limits of the city.    She sang it beautifully; it sounded like the very finest Italian opera  music.    \"Deary me,\" piped the Wise Woman, when she had finished, \"how very grand  these gentlemen are.\" Her Black Cat put up his back and spit.    \"Five times one Black Cat are five Black Cats,\" said the Wise Woman. And  directly there were five Black Cats spitting and miauling.    \"Five times five Black Cats are twenty-five Black Cats.\" And then there  were twenty-five of the angry little beasts.    \"Five times twenty-five Black Cats are one hundred and twenty-five Black  Cats,\" added the Wise Woman with a chuckle.    Then the Mayor and the Aldermen and the high Soprano Singer fled  precipitately out the door and back to the city. One hundred and  twenty-five Black Cats had seemed to fill the Wise Woman's hut full, and  when they all spit and miauled together it was dreadful. The visitors  could not wait for her to multiply Black Cats any longer.    As winter wore on and spring came, the condition of things grew more  intolerable. Physicians had been consulted, who advised that the  children should be allowed to follow their own bents, for fear of injury  to their constitutions. So the rich Aldermen's daughters were actually  out in the fields herding sheep, and their sons sweeping chimneys or  carrying newspapers; and while the poor charwomen's and coal-heavers,  children spent their time like princesses and fairies. Such a  topsy-turvy state of society was shocking. While the Mayor's little  daughter was tending geese out in the meadow like any common goose-girl,  her pretty elder sister, Violetta, felt very sad about it and used often  to cast about in her mind for some way of relief.    When cherries were ripe in spring, Violetta thought she would ask the  Cherry-man about it. She thought the Cherry-man quite"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50661"],[0,"Dave Dawson at Singapore (#4)"],[1," white light had filled his  brain, the light disappeared, and he realized that the plane was  cutting crazily down sidewise toward the rolling blue swells that were  now perilously close. The engine cowling looked as though it had been  hit by a twenty-ton tank. The metal was hanging in gleaming ribbons.  And as for the engine itself, one whole side of the powerful radial  engine was just so much mangled junk.    Sight and action became one for Dave. Even as he saw what the exploding  shell from the mysterious submarine's gun had done, he slammed on  opposite control hard and slowly got the Swordfish back onto even keel.  But shell fragments had parted a couple of the cables and no sooner  was the plane on even keel than it struggled to slump down by the wing  again. As a matter of fact, had the water not been but inches from the  bottom of the pontoon, and Dave able to sit down quickly, the plane  would have cartwheeled over and gone in wingtips first to really crack  up. As it was, the hasty emergency landing made Dave's teeth click, and  his backbone to feel as though it had been snapped off in half a dozen  places. However, the plane stayed put on its pontoon, and in a couple  of seconds the stars and comets ceased dancing around inside Dave's  head.    The first thing he did was to twist his head around and look for the  strange submarine. But it wasn't anywhere to be seen. It had obviously  crash-dived once the Swordfish had been hit. There wasn't even the  froth of its wake to be seen. Dave took a good look in all directions,  and then looked at Freddy Farmer's wide eyed and slightly pale face. He  grinned and touched a finger to his flying helmet.    \"Weren't in a hurry to get any place, were you, boss?\" he called out.  \"I think we've had an accident. In fact, I'm cockeyed sure of it,  boss.\"    The kidding words snapped the strain that was gripping the English  youth. Freddy slowly relaxed, swallowed a couple of times, and then  matched Dave's grin.    \"It doesn't matter, driver,\" he said. Then with a wave of his hand,  \"Welcome to Singapore. Nice place, isn't it?\"    \"Oh, jolly, as the beef eating English say,\" Dave mimicked with a  chuckle. \"A trifle on the wet side, though. You okay, Freddy?\"    \"My heart's stuck fast against my back teeth,\" the other said. \"I  fancy, though, it'll drop back into place in a moment. But that was the  damnedest ever, Dave. What in the world do you think?\"    Dave gave a shake of his head and heaved a long puzzled sigh.    \"I can't even try to guess, much less think,\" he finally grunted.  \"Thank the gods that only one shell hit us ... and it on the nose.  About ten feet farther back and you and I would be going places right  now full of slivers of steel. What do you think?\"    \"Less than that, I'm afraid,\" Freddy said, and cast anxious eyes about  the surface of the surrounding water. \"To tell the truth, I feel like  I've just awakened from a horrible nightmare.\"    \"Take a look at our engine!\" Dave growled. \"It was no nightmare, son.  Say, Freddy. You won't laugh, will you?\"    \"Lord knows I could do with a good laugh right now,\" the English youth  said and unbuckled his uncomfortable parachute harness. \"But what's on  your mind? I promise not to laugh.\"    \"Those guys who came popping out on that sub's deck like rabbits,\" Dave  said after a long frowning pause. \"Know what they looked like to me?\"    \"What?\"    \"Like Japs,\" Dave said, straight faced.    Freddy Farmer gulped and blinked. It was a couple of seconds before he  could get his tongue to form the word.    \"Japs?\" he gasped.    \"Sure, Japs,\" Dave repeated. \"You know, short for Japanese. I'll bet  you that was a Jap submarine, and those guys who let fly at us were  Japs.\"    The English youth pondered over that a moment, and meanwhile kept up  his nervous-eyed search of the surrounding rolling swells.    \"They did have the Japanese build, I'll admit,\" he finally said.  \"But.... Lord! It's fantastic, Dave! Why in the world would a Jap  submarine come to the surface and blast away at us? We're not even  carrying a torpedo, to say nothing of bombs.\"    \"But we are carrying a two-way radio,\" Dave pointed out gravely. \"It  could be that they didn't want anybody to know they were this close to  Singapore. They didn't hear us use the radio, so decided to surprise  us and blast us before we could use it. I only hope they don't surface  again and make sure with those bow guns. Say! What are you hunting for  anyway?\"    \"What do you think?\" Freddy Farmer snapped. \"I'm hoping they _don't_  come back to the surface, either. That they'll believe they got us with  that one blast. But, Dave, it's still fantastic. England's not at war  with Japan. Standers of the Harkness would have been informed if war  was declared while we were at sea. And he certainly would have told his  officers.\"    \"You and your English rules of war!\" Dave groaned. \"Look, little man,  they don't _declare_ war any more these days. You only find out you're  at war when you feel the pain of the knife going into your back. But I  only said they _looked_ like Japs. Maybe they weren't. Maybe they grow  them that way in Hitlerland, now. Who can tell?\"    \"Well, I guess it doesn't make much difference who they were,\" Freddy  said with a shrug. \"The point is, _here_ we are, and _what_ are we  going to do about it.\"    \"We could swim,\" Dave grunted, \"but I never was very good at making  friends with man-eating sharks. If you must know the truth, I figure  we've got to sit here and wait.\"    \"But that might be forever!\" Freddy cried in a startled voice.    \"Yeah, a long time,\" Dave said, and tapped a finger to his head. \"Stop  wondering about the Japs, pal, and relax and use your brains. Or did  you leave them in England?\"    \"Very funny!\" Freddy growled. \"But just what are you being so long  winded about? Come on, spit it out!\"    \"What would you do without me always around to hold your hand, and dry  your tears,\" Dave taunted with a grin. \"We sit here until they come out  and pick us up, of course.\"    \"Until _they_ come out?\" Freddy echoed sharply. \"Who knows where we...?\"    He stopped short and made a face as though he had bitten his tongue.  Then he grinned sheepishly as the flush came into his cheeks.    \"Sorry, old thing,\" he mumbled. \"Stupid of me, wasn't it? I see what  you mean, of course. When Air Vice Marshal Bostworth doesn't see us  return from a two hour mystery patrol over this area, he'll jolly well  send out search planes, eh?\"    \"He'd jolly well better!\" Dave grunted and fished for the chocolate  bars he always carried. \"Or I'll punch him right on the nose if I ever  meet up with him again. He got us into this, and he can get us out!  Here, have a hunk of chocolate. And don't chew with your mouth open.  It's not nice, and it makes me nervous.\"    Freddy Farmer shrugged when he could think of no fitting retort to that  one. However, he accepted one of the bars of chocolate, and both boys  fell to eating and silently staring out over the expanse of rolling  blue water that seemed to touch no land in any direction.          CHAPTER FOUR    _Satan Over Singapore_      Exactly five hours later the two boys were still staring out across  the rolling blue swells, and in between times they had searched and  researched the blazing China Sea skies with their tired eyes. But from  then until now they had seen nothing to bring joy or alarm to their  hearts. No planes or ships had appeared, and although they had kidded  and horsed around to keep each other's spirits at a high level, tiny  fears, and dreads, and doubts, were little by little boring deeper  into their thoughts. For five hours neither had seen the slightest  sign of anything that might mean rescue. And for five solid hours each  had expected the mysterious submarine to rise to the surface again  and really finish them off. After all, they had been shot down by the  undersea boat's guns for reasons they still couldn't figure out. But  just to be shot down and left floating alive was something else again.  That is, unless the crew and officers of that strange submarine were of  the belief that they had died.    Licking his dry lips, Dave half turned in the seat and shot a quick  glance back at Freddy Farmer. There was a set smile on the English  youth's lips, but the tightness at the corners of his eyes, and a  faint line of worry that creased his forehead told that the youth was  struggling inwardly to keep control of his jangled nerves and not go  haywire.    \"I think I forgot to ask you,\" Dave said. \"Just how did you like your  visit to Singapore, anyway?\"    \"Top-hole!\" Freddy said with a forced smile. \"So ... so stimulating,  and educational, you know. Fact is, I don't believe I'll ever forget  it. One of the milestones in my life.\"    \"Speaking of things educational,\" Dawson said to keep the conversation  alive, \"what do you know about Singapore, anyway?\"    \"Ask me, and find out, my little man,\" Freddy said with a little wave  of his hand.    Dave dragged down the corners of his mouth, and squinted at his pal.    \"A smart guy, huh?\" he grunted. \"Okay, I will ask you a few things.  First, what does Singapore mean?\"    \"Don't you know?\" Freddy retorted.    \"Come on, none of that stuff!\" Dave cried. \"Stop crawling, young man.  Tell teacher, or else admit you're dumb. What does Singapore mean?\"    \"Singapore means nothing!\" Freddy shot at him. \"It is the modern  spelling of the city's real name centuries ago. Then it was Singhapura.  That is a Sanskrit word that means City of the Lion.\"    Dave made a mock bow and went through the motions of tipping his hat.    \"Well, knock me over with a Flying Fortress!\" he exclaimed. \"I guess  the guy did spend two or three years in school. Okay, tell me some  more, sonny.\"    \"It's rather a nice sort of place, if you go in for that sort of  place,\" Freddy said gravely. \"It is an island, of course. It was picked  as a British navy outpost by a Sir"]]]
