By these people it was artfully suggested to the Indians, that their  new oppressors were of the race of those who had driven them from the  sea, and were progressively advancing on their territories until scarce  a hunting ground or a village would be left to them. They described  them, moreover, as being the hereditary enemies of their great father,  the King of France, with whose governors they had buried the hatchet  for ever, and smoked the calumet of perpetual peace. Fired by these  wily suggestions, the high and jealous spirit of the Indian chiefs took  the alarm, and they beheld with impatience the \"Red Coat,\" or  \"Saganaw,\" [Footnote: This word thus pronounced by themselves, in  reference to the English soldiery, is, in all probability, derived from  the original English settlers in Saganaw Bay.] usurping, as they deemed  it, those possessions which had so recently acknowledged the supremacy  of the pale flag of their ancient ally. The cause of the Indians, and  that of the Canadians, became, in some degree, identified as one, and  each felt it was the interest, and it may be said the natural instinct,  of both, to hold communionship of purpose, and to indulge the same  jealousies and fears. Such was the state of things in 1763, the period  at which our story commences,--an epoch fruitful in designs of  hostility and treachery on the part of the Indians, who, too crafty and  too politic to manifest their feelings by overt acts declaratory of the  hatred carefully instilled into their breasts, sought every opportunity  to compass the destruction of the English, wherever they were most  vulnerable to the effects of stratagem. Several inferior forts situated  on the Ohio had already fallen into their hands, when they summoned all  their address and cunning to accomplish the fall of the two important  though remote posts of Detroit and Michilimackinac. For a length of  time they were baffled by the activity and vigilance of the respective  governors of these forts, who had had too much fatal experience in the  fate of their companions not to be perpetually on the alert against  their guile; but when they had at length, in some degree, succeeded in  lulling the suspicions of the English, they determined on a scheme,  suggested by a leading chief, a man of more than ordinary character,  which promised fair to rid them altogether of a race they so cordially  detested. We will not, however, mar the interest of our tale, by  anticipating, at this early stage, either the nature or the success of  a stratagem which forms the essential groundwork of our story.    While giving, for the information of the many, what, we trust, will not  be considered a too compendious outline of the Canadas, and the events  connected with them, we are led to remark, that, powerful as was the  feeling of hostility cherished by the French Canadians towards the  English when the yoke of early conquest yet hung heavily on them, this  feeling eventually died away under the mild influence of a government  that preserved to them the exercise of all their customary privileges,  and abolished all invidious distinctions between the descendants of  France and those of the mother-country. So universally, too, has this  system of conciliation been pursued, we believe we may with safety  aver, of all the numerous colonies that have succumbed to the genius  and power of England, there are none whose inhabitants entertain  stronger feelings of attachment and loyalty to her than those of  Canada; and whatever may be the transient differences,--differences  growing entirely out of circumstances and interests of a local  character, and in no way tending to impeach the acknowledged fidelity  of the mass of French Canadians,--whatever, we repeat, may be the  ephemeral differences that occasionally spring up between the governors  of those provinces and individual members of the Houses of Assembly,  they must, in no way, be construed into a general feeling of  disaffection towards the English crown.    In proportion also as the Canadians have felt and acknowledged the  beneficent effects arising from a change of rulers, so have the Indian  tribes been gradually weaned from their first fierce principle of  hostility, until they have subsequently become as much distinguished by  their attachment to, as they were three quarters of a century ago  remarkable for their untameable aversion for, every thing that bore the  English name, or assumed the English character. Indeed, the hatred  which they bore to the original colonists has been continued to their  descendants, the subjects of the United States; and the same spirit of  union subsisted between the natives and British troops, and people of  Canada, during the late American war, that at an earlier period of the  history of that country prevailed so powerfully to the disadvantage of  England.    And now we have explained a course of events which were in some measure  necessary to the full understanding of the country by the majority of  our readers, we shall, in furtherance of the same object, proceed to  sketch a few of the most prominent scenes more immediately before us.    The fort of Detroit, as it was originally constructed by the French,  stands in the middle of a common, or description of small prairie,  bounded by woods, which, though now partially thinned in their  outskirts, were at that period untouched by the hand of civilisation.  Erected at a distance of about half a mile from the banks of the river,  which at that particular point are high and precipitous, it stood then  just far enough from the woods that swept round it in a semicircular  form to be secure from the rifle of the Indian; while from its  batteries it commanded a range of country on every hand, which no enemy  unsupported by cannon could traverse with impunity. Immediately in the  rear, and on the skirt of the wood, the French had constructed a sort  of bomb-proof, possibly intended to serve as a cover to the workmen  originally employed in clearing the woods, but long since suffered to  fall into decay. Without the fortification rose a strong and triple  line of pickets, each of about two feet and a half in circumference,  and so fitted into each other as to leave no other interstices than  those which were perforated for the discharge of musketry. They were  formed of the hardest and most knotted pines that could be procured;  the sharp points of which were seasoned by fire until they acquired  nearly the durability and consistency of iron. Beyond these firmly  imbedded pickets was a ditch, encircling the fort, of about twenty feet  in width, and of proportionate depth, the only communication over which  to and from the garrison was by means of a drawbridge, protected by a  strong chevaux-de-frise. The only gate with which the fortress was  provided faced the river; on the more immediate banks of which, and to  the left of the fort, rose the yet infant and straggling village that  bore the name of both. Numerous farm-houses, however, almost joining  each other, contributed to form a continuity of many miles along the  borders of the river, both on the right and on the left; while the  opposite shores of Canada, distinctly seen in the distance, presented,  as far as the eye could reach, the same enlivening character of  fertility. The banks, covered with verdure on either shore, were more  or less undulating at intervals; but in general they were high without  being abrupt, and picturesque without being bold, presenting, in their  partial cultivation, a striking contrast to the dark, tall, and  frowning forests bounding every point of the perspective.    At a distance of about five miles on the left of the town the course of  the river was interrupted by a small and thickly wooded island, along  whose sandy beach occasionally rose the low cabin or wigwam which the  birch canoe, carefully upturned and left to dry upon the sands,  attested to be the temporary habitation of the wandering Indian. That  branch of the river which swept by the shores of Canada was (as at this  day) the only navigable one for vessels of burden, while that on the  opposite coast abounded in shallows and bars, affording passage merely  to the light barks of the natives, which seemed literally to skim the  very surface of its waves. Midway, between that point of the continent  which immediately faced the eastern extremity of the island we have  just named and the town of Detroit, flowed a small tributary river, the  approaches to which, on either hand, were over a slightly sloping  ground, the view of which could be entirely commanded from the fort.  The depth of this river, now nearly dried up, at that period varied  from three to ten or twelve feet; and over this, at a distance of about  twenty yards from the Detroit, into which it emptied itself, rose,  communicating with the high road, a bridge, which will more than once  be noticed in the course of our tale. Even to the present hour it  retains the name given to it during these disastrous times; and there  are few modern Canadians, or even Americans, who traverse the \"Bloody  Bridge,\" especially at the still hours of advanced night, without  recalling to memory the tragic events of those days, (handed down as  they have been by their fathers, who were eye-witnesses of the  transaction,) and peopling the surrounding gloom with the shades of  those whose life-blood erst crimsoned the once pure waters of that now  nearly exhausted stream; and whose mangled and headless corpses were  slowly borne by its tranquil current into the bosom of the parent  river, where all traces of them finally disappeared.    These are the minuter"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49131"],[0,"Wings over England (#4)"],[1," been there and finished wrecking it. If not, we'll be the first  to look it over.\"    The discovering of the wreck was no great task. The plane had cut a path  through a cluster of young trees. In doing this it had stripped off its  wings, but its cabin, motor, and instrument board had been left in fair  condition.    \"The R. A. F. will want to look at this,\" Brand said. \"They'll want to  know if the Huns have discovered any new tricks,--a bomb sight, or  something like that.\"    He tried the cabin door. It stuck. Seizing a bar from the smashed  landing gear he pried the door open. As he did so something fell at his  feet. It was a long, flat pigskin billfold.    Throwing back the flap, he pulled out a handful of papers. The first of  these appeared to be some sort of flying orders. He could not read the  German print, but the names, written in by hand, were plain enough.    \"Fritz Steinbeck,\" the boy read aloud. \"That may be the dark-haired  fellow we caught first.\"    \"What are the other names?\" Dave asked.    \"Hans Schlitz, and Nicholas Schlitz. Sayee--\" Brand stared. \"They may be  brothers.\"    \"And they are!\" he exclaimed in a low, tense whisper ten seconds later.  \"Look! Here's their picture together.\" He held up a thin card.    \"Look almost like twins,\" Dave suggested.    \"Nope,\" Brand concluded after a second look. \"The one we caught is the  older of the two. I only hope,\" his brow wrinkled, \"that they get this  fellow Nicholas. If they don't--well--\" he heaved a deep sigh. \"His name  may be Nicholas, but for us, if he harbors a grudge, as his brother  surely does, he may prove to be Old Nick, the devil himself.\" He did his  best to suppress a shudder. \"I'll put this in my pocket.\" He stowed the  billfold away. \"Turn it in at the airport tomorrow. Mother will be down  tonight. I want to talk the affair over with her.    \"Hey, you!\" he called a moment later as a boy who could scarcely have  been past sixteen put in an appearance. \"You've got a gun.\"    \"That I have,\" the boy grinned.    \"Want a job?\"    \"That I do. I'm tired of tramping.\"    \"Right. You just keep an eye on this wreck until someone from the R. A.  F. comes along.\"    \"A Royal Air Force man.\" The boy grinned again. \"I'll sure enough be  glad to meet one.\"    \"You'll get a chance, all right,\" Brand promised. \"They won't miss  this.\"    To Dave he said: \"Come on. We'll go down now.\"    They made their way through the shadows cast by young trees in silence.  Arrived at the upper side of the broad meadow overlooking the homestead  and the village beyond, as if struck by the beauty of the view, they  paused to stand there motionless.    How different were their thoughts at that moment!    The American boy was thinking: \"How strangely beautiful it all is, as if  it had been arranged with great care so that a famous artist might paint  it.\"    It was just that--the farmhouse built of native stone, centuries old,  stood in the midst of orchards and gardens all green and gold with the  colors of autumn. Brightest speck of all was Cherry sitting on the gray  rocks.    \"How like a sprite she is,\" Dave was thinking. \"And how like an angel  she can sing!\"    Beyond the farmstead was a broad, green pasture dotted with black and  white cattle. To the right of this its walls shattered but still  upright, a great, gray Norman castle cast a long, dark shadow.    \"It's like the shadow of war on a weary world,\" the boy thought.    As his gaze turned to the left his face brightened. \"The village,\" he  whispered. Never before, he thought, had there been such a village. With  its winding street following the whimsical meandering of a narrow  stream, with its houses set irregularly along hillsides that sloped away  on either side, with gardens running back to the edge of a great grove  of beech, oak and yew trees, it all seemed part of a picture-book dream.    \"And yet,\" he thought, \"the people in that village are quite human. They  are kind, simple and good. The baker, the blacksmith, the cobbler, and  all the rest,--how really wonderful they are! And so kind to a stranger!  And yet,\"--He was thinking what it might be like tomorrow, or the day  after--if the war lasted. And it would last!    As for Brand, he was thinking quite simply and steadfastly, \"That's my  home down there. It's always been my home--has been the home of my  people for generations. And yet, if the purpose of one man, or perhaps  two, had been carried out on this perfect autumn day, it would have been  no home--only a pile of rocks. And beneath that pile would have been the  crushed forms of three persons I love.\"    \"This,\" he said aloud, \"is war. Come on.\" His voice was hoarse. \"Let's  get on down.\"                                        _Chapter V_                               The Young Lord      The house in which the Ramseys lived was large. Its kitchen was  immense--large as the entire first floor of a modern American home. Its  fireplace took a five-foot log at its back. Walled round with two-foot  thick stone, with flagstone floor and massive beamed ceiling, this room  seemed the inside of a fort. And that, in days long gone bye, it might  very well have been, for a moat--in these days dry and grown up to  shrubs--ran round the house.    It was in this great room, when the day's work was done and night had  shut out both the beauty and the horror of the day, that the family  gathered about the cheery fire.    Over the massive glowing logs a teakettle sang. By the hearth lay Flash,  the golden collie. Back of him, on a rug, the two young girls played at  jacks. Dave, who sat nearest to them, noted with approval that their  hair was now neatly combed, their dresses clean, their faces  shining--\"That's the part Alice plays,\" he thought with approval.    As his eyes swept the circle, Alice knitting, Cherry smiling over a  book, Jock and Brand talking about cattle that had strayed, he thought:  \"This is indeed a happy home.\"    At that moment there came the sound of a motor, followed by a loud honk.  At once Cherry, with cheeks aglow, was at the door.    She ushered in a young man of medium height, with smooth dark hair and  smiling black eyes.    \"Good evening, everybody,\" he exclaimed. \"Thought I'd just drop by to  see how you liked the bombing. Stirred you up a bit. I'll bet on that.  I--\" He paused as his eyes fell on Dave. Dave was new to him. So too  were the small girls who stared up at him.    \"Lord Applegate,\" Cherry began, \"I want you--\"    \"Forget about the Lord part,\" the young man laughed. \"I'm not yet a  lord. If ever I receive the title it will never fit. Call me Harmon, as  you've always done, or Lieutenant Applegate of the R. A. F.\"    \"That,\" Brand exclaimed, \"is an honor indeed. I only wish--\" He did not  finish but stared enviously at the Lieutenant's uniform. \"I'd be content  if I were only a private,\" he whispered under his breath.    \"Well, anyway,\" Cherry laughingly began all over, \"I want you to meet  David Barnes. He's from America. His uncle is a war reporter who knew  father in the World War. And so--\"    \"So he's paying you a visit. That's fine.\" The young lord who wasn't yet  a lord but was a Lieutenant in the Royal Air Force shook hands with  Dave, then accepted a place beside him.    \"Where did you get the children, Cherry?\" Applegate asked, looking down  at the pair who had resumed their game.    \"Oh, they are Alice's,\" Cherry laughed.    \"Nice work, Alice,\" the Young Lord said. \"It must have been a very long  time since I was here.\"    \"It has been,\" Alice agreed. \"Quite too long. But these children,--they  are refugees from London. Bombed out, you know.    \"You should have seen them when they came!\" she added in a low voice,  with a grimace. \"Their mothers came with them. But they couldn't stand  the eternal silence of this place.\"    \"So they left you the children?\" said Applegate. \"Good old Alice!\"    \"Oh, they're really a joy!\" The girl's face lighted.    \"But Harm!\" Her face sobered. \"That plane dropped a bomb on the old  playhouse. Blew it to bits. You know, you used to come and play with us  sometimes long ago--with dolls and things,\" she added teasingly.    \"With dolls! Good heavens!\" he exclaimed.    \"And today the dolls had their heads blown off,\" Cherry added. \"Just  think! It might have been our heads that were blown off!\"    \"Yes,\" the young man's face sobered, \"it might have been. That was a  real scrap. Didn't come out so badly on the whole. Did they catch the  men who bailed out?\"    \"Two of them.\" Brand's brow wrinkled. \"The Home Guard tells me the other  got away.\"    \"Oh, they'll catch him,\" Applegate prophesied cheerfully.    \"I'm not so sure about that.\" Brand did not smile. \"They did find his  parachute and his uniform half hidden under leaves.\"    \"Oh! Fixing to turn into a spy!\" Applegate's face sobered.    \"Alice,\" the younger of the two children called. \"What is a spy?\"    \"A spy,\" said Cherry, \"steals secrets.\"    \"And blows up castles and bridges. A terrible man!\" said Alice. \"I know  all about it. I'll tell you a story about a spy when it's time for bed.\"    \"Ooo.\" Peggy gave a delectable shiver. \"After that we won't dare go to  sleep!\"    \"The most astonishing thing,\"--Brand leaned forward in his chair--\"is  that one of the men we captured today is the son of the prisoner who  worked on this farm more than twenty years ago.\"    \"What?\" Applegate exclaimed. \"It can't be possible!\"    \"How do you expect us to believe that?\" Cherry demanded with a wave of  the hand.    \"I'll leave it to Dave and Jock,\" Brand defended.    \"That's right,\" Jock agreed. Dave nodded his head.    \"See?\" Brand's voice was low. \"What's more, I'm almost sure the fellow  who eluded us is his brother. If you don't believe that, look at this  picture.\" He passed the paper and the photo around.    \"Hans Schlitz,\" Applegate said, musingly, \"That's the name, right  enough. I've often heard my mother speak of him. Gloomy, brooding sort  of fellow, he was."]]]
