I  thought Mrs. Carr was to carry it on.\"    \"So she did, for a time, but a woman ain't fit for a public position of  that kind. So I applied for the position, and got it.\"    \"What's Mrs. Carr going to do?\"    \"She's got her pension,\" said Ebenezer, shortly.    \"Eight dollars a month, isn't it?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"That ain't much to support a family.\"    \"She'll have to do something else, then, I suppose.\"    \"There isn't much to do in Wayneboro.\"    \"That isn't my lookout. She can take in sewing, or washing,\" suggested  Ebenezer, who did not trouble himself much about the care of his  neighbors. \"Besides there's Herbert--he can earn something.\"    \"But I'm to take his place.\"    \"Oh well, I ain't under any obligations to provide them a livin'. I've  got enough to take care of myself and my family.\"    \"You'd better have let her keep the post office,\" said Eben. He was  not less selfish than his father, but then his own interests were not  concerned. He would not have scrupled, in his father's case, to do  precisely the same.    \"It's lucky I've got a little extra income,\" said Ebenezer, bitterly;  \"now I've got your bills to pay.\"    \"I suppose I shall have to accept your offer, father,\" said Eben, \"for  the present; but I hope you'll think better of my California plan after  a while. Why, there's a fellow I know went out there last year, went up  to the mines, and now he's worth five thousand dollars!\"    \"Then he must be a very different sort of a person from you,\" retorted  his father, sagaciously. \"You would never succeed there, if you can't in  Boston.\"    \"I've never had a chance to try,\" grumbled Eben.    There was sound sense in what his father said. Failure at home is very  likely to be followed by failure away from home. There have been cases  that seemed to disprove my assertion, but in such cases failure has only  been changed into success by earnest work. I say to my young readers,  therefore, never give up a certainty at home to tempt the chances of  success in a distant State, unless you are prepared for disappointment.    When the engagement had been made with Eben, Mr. Graham called Herbert  to his presence.    \"Herbert,\" said he, \"I won't need you after Saturday night. My son is  going into the store, and will do all I require. You can tell him how to  prepare the mails, et cetery.\"    \"Very well, sir,\" answered Herbert. It was not wholly a surprise, but  it was a disappointment, for he did not know how he could make three  dollars a week in any other way, unless he left Wayneboro.          CHAPTER V. EBEN'S SCHEME.        Saturday night came, and with it the end of Herbert's engagement in the  post office.    He pocketed the three dollars which his employer grudgingly gave him,  and set out on his way home.    \"Wait a minute, Herbert,\" said Eben. \"I'll walk with you.\"    Herbert didn't care much for Eben's company but he was too polite to say  so. He waited therefore, till Eben appeared with hat and cane.    \"I'm sorry to cut you out of your place, Herbert,\" said the young man.    \"Thank you,\" answered Herbert.    \"It isn't my fault, for I don't want to go into the store,\" proceeded  Eben. \"A fellow that's stood behind the counter in a city store is fit  for something better, but it's the old man's fault.\"    Herbert made no comment, and Eben proceeded:    \"Yes,\" said he, \"it's the old man's fault. He's awfully stingy, you know  that yourself.\"    Herbert did know it, but thought it would not be in good taste to say  so.    \"I suppose Wayneboro is rather dull for you after living in the city,\"  he remarked.    \"I should say so. This village is a dull hole, and yet father expects  me to stay here cooped up in a little country store. I won't stay here  long, you may be sure of that.\"    \"Where will you go?\"    \"I don't know yet. I want to go to California, but I can't unless the  old man comes down with the requisite amount of tin. You'll soon have  your situation back again. I won't stand in your way.\"    \"I'm not very particular about going back,\" said Herbert, \"but I must  find something to do.\"    \"Just so!\" said Eben. \"The place will do well enough for a boy like you,  but I am a young man, and entitled to look higher. By the way, I've got  something in view that may bring me in five thousand dollars within a  month.\"    Herbert stared at his companion in surprise, not knowing any short cut  to wealth.    \"Do you mean it?\" he asked, incredulously.    \"Yes,\" said Eben.    \"I suppose you don't care to tell what it is?\"    \"Oh, I don't mind--it's a lottery.\"    \"Oh!\" said Herbert, in a tone of disappointment.    \"Yes,\" answered Eben. \"You may think lotteries are a fraud and all  that, but I know a man in Boston who drew last month a prize of fifteen  thousand dollars. The ticket only cost him a dollar. What do you say to  that?\"    \"Such cases can't be very common,\" said Herbert, who had a good share of  common sense.    \"Not so uncommon as you think,\" returned Eben, nodding. \"I don't mean to  say that many draw prizes as large as that, but there are other prizes  of five thousand dollars, and one thousand, and so on. It would be very  comfortable to draw a prize of even five hundred, wouldn't it now?\"    Herbert admitted that it would.    \"I'd send for a ticket by Monday morning's mail,\" continued Eben, \"if  I wasn't so hard up. The old man's mad because I ran into debt, and he  won't give me a cent. Will you do me a favor?\"    \"What is it?\" asked Herbert, cautiously.    \"Lend me two dollars. You've got it, I know, because you were paid off  to-night. I would send for two tickets, and agree to give you quarter of  what I draw. Isn't that fair?\"    \"It may be,\" said Herbert, \"but I haven't any money to lend.\"    \"You have three dollars in your pocket at this moment.\"    \"Yes, but it isn't mine. I must hand it to mother.\"    \"And give up the chance of winning a prize. I'll promise to give you  half of whatever I draw, besides paying back the money.\"    \"Thank you, but I can't spare the money.\"    \"You are getting as miserly as the old man,\" said Eben, with a forced  laugh.    \"Eben,\" said Herbert, seriously, \"you don't seem to understand our  position. Mother has lost the post office, and has but eight dollars a  month income. I've earned three dollars this week, but next week I  may earn nothing. You see, I can't afford to spend money for lottery  tickets.\"    \"Suppose by your caution you lose five hundred dollars. Nothing risk,  nothing gain!\"    \"I have no money to risk,\" said Herbert, firmly.    \"Oh, well, do as you please!\" said Eben, evidently disappointed. \"I  thought I'd make you the offer, because I should like to see you win a  big prize.\"    \"Thank you for your friendly intention,\" said Herbert, \"but I am afraid  there are a good many more blanks than prizes. If there were not, it  wouldn't pay the lottery men to carry on the business.\"    This was common sense, and I cannot forbear at this point to press it  upon the attention of my young reader. Of all schemes of gaining wealth,  about the most foolish is spending money for lottery tickets. It  has been estimated by a sagacious writer that there is about as much  likelihood of drawing a large prize in a lottery as of being struck by  lightning and that, let us hope, is very small.    \"I guess I won't go any farther,\" said Eben, abruptly, having become  convinced that Herbert could not be prevailed upon to lend him money.    \"Good-night, then,\" said Herbert \"Good-night.\"    \"Well, mother, I'm out of work,\" said Herbert, as he entered the little  sitting room, and threw down his week's wages. Our young hero was of a  cheerful temperament but he looked and felt sober when he said this.    \"But for the Grahams we should have a comfortable living,\" the boy  proceeded. \"First, the father took away the post office from you, and  now the son has robbed me of my place.\"    \"Don't be discouraged, Herbert,\" said his mother. \"God will find us a  way out of our troubles.\"    Herbert had been trained to have a reverence for religion, and had faith  in the providential care of his heavenly Father, and his mother's words  recalled his cheerfulness.    \"You are right, mother,\" he said, more hopefully. \"I was feeling  low-spirited to-night, but I won't feel so any more. I don't see how we  are to live, but I won't let it trouble me tonight.\"    \"Let us do our part, and leave the rest to God,\" said Mrs. Carr. \"He  won't support us in idleness, but I am sure that in some way relief will  come if we are ready to help ourselves.\"    \"God helps them that help themselves,\" repeated Herbert.    \"Exactly so. To-morrow is Sunday, and we won't let any worldly anxieties  spoil that day for us. When Monday comes, we will think over what is  best to be done.\"    The next day Herbert and his mother attended church in neat apparel, and  those who saw their cheerful faces were not likely to guess the serious  condition of their affairs. They were not in debt, to be sure, but,  unless employment came soon, they were likely to be ere long, for they  had barely enough money ahead to last them two weeks.    Monday morning came, and brought its burden of care.    \"I wish there was a factory in Wayneboro,\" said Herbert. \"I am told that  boys of my age sometimes earn six or seven dollars a week.\"    \"I have heard so. Here there seems nothing, except working on a farm.\"    \"And the farmers expect boys to take their pay principally in board.\"    \"That is a consideration, but, if possible, I hope we shall not be  separated at meals.\"    \"I will try other things first,\" said Herbert. \"How would you like some  fish for dinner, mother? My time isn't of any particular value, and I  might as well go fishing.\"    \"Do so, Herbert. It will save our buying meat, which, indeed, we can  hardly afford to do.\"    Herbert felt that anything was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5760"],[0,"Two Trips to Gorilla Land and the Cataracts of the Congo, Volume 1 (#4)"],[1,"by more powerful rivals--a  hot-bed of dysentery and yellow fever, a blot upon the fair face  of earth, even African earth--for a new and fresh country, with a  comparatively good climate, in which the thermometer ranges  between 65Â° (Fahr.) and 90Â°, with a barometer as high as the heat  allows; and where, being at home and unwatched, they could  subject a lingering slave-trade to a regular British putting-  down. But, when matters came to the point in 1870-71, the  proposed bargain excited a storm of sentimental wrath which was  as queer as unexpected. The French object to part with the  Gaboon, as the Germans appear inclined to settle upon the Ogobe  River. In England, cotton, civilization, and even Christianity  were thrust forward by half-a-dozen merchants, and by a few venal  colonial prints. The question assumed the angriest aspect; and,  lastly, the Prussian-French war underwrote the negotiations with  a finis pro temp. I hope to see them renewed; and I hope still  more ardently to see the day when we shall either put our so-  called \"colonies\" on the West Coast of Africa to their only  proper use, convict stations, or when, if we are determined upon  consuming our own crime at home, we shall make up our minds to  restore them to the negro and the hyaena, their \"old  inhabitants.\"    At the time of my visit, the Gaboon River had four English  traders; viz.    1. Messrs. Laughland and Co., provision-merchants, Fernando Po  and Glasgow. Their resident agent was Mr. Kirkwood.    2. Messrs. Hatton and Cookson, general merchants, Liverpool.  Their chief agent, Mr. R.B.N. Walker, who had known the river for  eleven years (1865), had left a few days before my arrival; his  successor, Mr. R.B. Knight, had also sailed for Cape Palmas, to  engage Kru-men, and Mr. Hogg had been left in charge.    3. Messrs. Wookey and Dyer, general merchants, Liverpool. Agents,  Messrs. Gordon and Bryant.    4. Messrs. Bruford and Townsend, of Bristol. Agent, Captain  Townsend.    The resident agents for the Hamburg houses were Messrs. Henert  and Bremer.    The English traders in the Gaboon are nominally protected by the  Consulate of Sao Paulo de Loanda, but the distance appears too  great for consul or cruizer. They are naturally anxious for some  support, and they agitate for an unpaid Consular Agent: at  present they have, in African parlance, no \"back.\" A Kruman,  offended by a ration of plantains, when he prefers rice, runs to  the Plateau, and lays some fictitious complaint before the  Commandant. Monsieur summons the merchant, condemns him to pay a  fine, and dismisses the affair without even permitting a protest.  Hence, impudent robbery occurs every day. The discontent of the  white reacts upon his clients the black men; of late, les Gabons,  as the French call the natives, have gone so far as to declare  that foreigners have no right to the upper river, which is all  private property. The line drawn by them is at Fetish Rock, off  Pointe FranÃ§aise, near the native village of MpÃ­ra, about half a  mile above the Plateau; and they would hail with pleasure a  transfer to masters who are not so uncommonly ready with their  gros canons.    The Gaboon trade is chronicled by John Barbot, Agent-General of  the French West African Company, \"Description of the Coast of  South Guinea,\" Churchill, vol. v. book iv. chap. 9; and the chief  items were, and still are, ivory and beeswax. Of the former,  90,000 lbs. may be exported when the home prices are good, and  sometimes the total has reached 100 tons. Hippopotamus tusks are  dying out, being now worth only 2s. per lb. Other exports are  caoutchouc, ebony (of which the best comes from the Congo), and  camwood or barwood (a Tephrosia). M. du Chaillu calls it the  \"Ego-tree;\" the natives (Mpongwe) name the tree Igo, and the  billet EzÃ­go.                                      Chapter II.          The Departure.--the Tornado.--arrival at \"The Bush.\"        I set out early on March 19th, a day, at that time, to me the  most melancholy in the year, but now regarded with philosophic  indifference. A parting visit to the gallant \"Griffons,\" who  threw the slipper, in the shape of three hearty cheers and a  \"tiger,\" wasted a whole morning. It was 12.30 P.M. before the  mission boat turned her head towards the southern bank, and her  crew began to pull in the desultory manner of the undisciplined  negro.    The morning had been clear but close, till a fine sea breeze set  in unusually early. \"The doctor\" seldom rises in the Gaboon  before noon at this season; often he delays his visit till 2  P.M., and sometimes he does not appear at all. On the other hand,  he is fond of late hours. Before we had progressed a mile,  suspicious gatherings of slaty-blue cloud-heaps advanced from the  north-east against the wind, with a steady and pertinacious  speed, showing that mischief was meant. The \"cruel, crawling sea\"  began to rough, purr, and tumble; a heavy cross swell from the  south-west dandled the up-torn mangrove twigs, as they floated  past us down stream, and threatened to swamp the deeply laden and  cranky old boat, which was far off letter A1 of Lloyd's. The  oarsmen became sulky because they were not allowed to make sail,  which, in case of a sudden squall, could not have been taken in  under half an hour. Patience! Little can be done, on the first  day, with these demi-semi-Europeanized Africans, except to  succeed in the inevitable trial of strength.    The purple sky-ground backing the Gaboon's upper course admirably  set off all its features. Upon the sea horizon, where the river  measures some thirty miles across, I could distinctly see the  junction of the two main branches, the true Olo' Mpongwe, the  main stream flowing from the Eastern Ghats, and the Rembwe  (Ramboue) or south-eastern influent. At the confluence, tree-  dots, tipping the watery marge, denoted what Barbot calls the  \"Pongo Islands.\" These are the quoin-shaped mass \"DÃ¡mbe\" (Orleans  Island) alias \"Coniquet\" (the Conelet), often corrupted to  Konikey; the Konig Island of the old Hollander,[FN#3] and the  Prince's Island of the ancient Briton. It was so called because  held by the MwÃ¡ni-pongo, who was to this region what the MwÃ¡ni-  congo was farther south. The palace was large but very mean, a  shell of woven reeds roofed with banana leaves: the people, then  mere savages, called their St. James' \"Goli-patta,\" or \"Royal  House,\" in imitation of a more civilized race near Cape Lopez.  The imperial islet is some six miles in circumference; it was  once very well peopled, and here ships used to be careened. The  northern point which starts out to meet it is Ovindo (OwÃ«endo of  old), alias Red Point, alias \"Rodney's,\" remarkable for its fair  savannah, of which feature more presently. In mid-stream lies  Mbini (Embenee), successively Papegay, Parrot--there is one in  every Europeo-African river--and Adelaide Island.    Between Ovindo Point, at the northern bend of the stream, stand  the so-called \"English villages,\" divided from the French by  marshy ground submerged during heavy rains. The highest upstream  is Olomi, Otonda-naga, or town of \"Cabinda,\" a son of the late  king. Next comes Glass Town, belonging to a dynasty which has  lasted a century--longer than many of its European brethren. In  1787 a large ship-bell was sent as a token of regard by a Bristol  house, Sydenham and Co., to an old, old \"King Glass,\" whose  descendants still reign. Olomi and Glass Town are preferred by  the English, as their factories catch the sea-breeze better than  can Le Plateau: the nearer swamps are now almost drained off, and  the distance from the \"authorities\" is enough for comfort. Follow  Comba (Komba) and Tom Case, the latter called after Case Glass, a  scion of the Glasses, who was preferred as captain's \"tradesman\"  by Captain Vidal, R.N., in 1827, because he had \"two virtues  which rarely fall to the lot of savages, namely, a mild, quiet  manner, and a low tone of voice when speaking.\" Tom Qua Ben,  justly proud of the \"laced coat of a mail coach guard,\" was  chosen by Captain Boteler, R.N. The list concludes with Butabeya,  James Town, and Mpira.    These villages are not built street-wise after Mpongwe fashion.  They are scatters of shabby mat-huts, abandoned after every  freeman's death; and they hardly emerge from the luxuriant  undergrowth of manioc and banana, sensitive plant and physic nut  (Jatropha Curcas), clustering round a palm here and there. Often  they are made to look extra mean by a noble \"cottonwood,\" or  Bombax (Pentandrium), standing on its stalwart braces like an old  sea-dog with parted legs; extending its roots over a square acre  of soil, shedding filmy shade upon the surrounding underwood, and  at all times ready, like a certain chestnut, to shelter a hundred  horses.    Between the Plateau and Santa Clara, beginning some two miles  below the former, are those hated and hating rivals, Louis Town,  Qua Ben, and Prince Krinje, the French settlements. The latter is  named after a venerable villain who took in every white man with  whom he had dealings, till the new colony abolished that  exclusive agency, that monopoly so sacred in negro eyes, which  here corresponded with the AbbÃ¡nat of the Somal. Mr. Wilson (p.  252) recounts with zest a notable trick played by this \"little,  old, grey-headed, humpback man\" upon Captain BouÃ«t-Willaumez, and  Mr. W. Winwood Reade (chap, xi.) has ably dramatized \"Krinji,  King George and the Commandant.\" On another occasion, the whole  population of the Gaboon was compelled by a French man-o-war to  pay \"Prince Cringy's\" debts, and he fell into disfavour only when  he attempted to wreck a frigate by way of turning an honest  penny.    But soon we had something to think of besides the view. The  tumultuous assemblage of dark, dense clouds, resting upon the  river-surface in our rear, formed line or rather lines, step upon  step, and tier on tier. While the sun shone"]]]
