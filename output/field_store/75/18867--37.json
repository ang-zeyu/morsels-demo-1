And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech,  782 years, making him 969 years old when he died 5:26,27. Lamech lived  after he begat Noah, 595 years; making him 777 years old when he died.  5:30,31.    41. Agreeably to this account, Adam died in the 930th year of the  world; Enoch was translated in the 987th, Seth died in the 1042nd; Enos  in the 1140th; Cainan in the 1235th; Mahalaleel in the 1290th; Jared  in the 1422nd; Lamech in the 1651st; and Methuselah in the 1656th, it  being the same year in which the flood came.    42. So that Noah was 84 years old when Enos died, 176 when Cainan died,  234 when Mahalaleel died, 366 when Jared died, 595 when Lamech died,  and 600 when Methuselah died.    43. We can see from this that Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared,  Methuselah, Lamech, and Noah, all lived on the earth at the same time;  and that Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared, Methuselah, and Lamech, were  all acquainted with both Adam and Noah.    44. From the foregoing it is easily to be seen, not only how the  knowledge of God came into the world, but upon what principle it  was preserved: that from the time it was first communicated, it was  retained in the minds of righteous men, who taught, not only their own  posterity, but the world; so that there was no need of a new revelation  to man, after Adam's creation to Noah, to give them the first idea, or  notion of the existence of a God: and not only of a God, but of the  true and living God.    45. Having traced the chronology of the world from Adam to Noah, we  will now trace it from Noah to Abraham. Noah was 502 years old When  Shem was born; 98 years afterwards the flood came, being the 600th year  of Noah's age. And Moses informs us that Noah lived after the flood,  350 years, making him 950 years old when he died. Genesis 9:28-29.    46. Shem was 100 years old when Arphaxad was born. Genesis 11:10.  Arphaxad was 35 when Salah was born. Gen. 11:12. Salah was 30 when Eber  was born. 11:14. Eber was 34 when Peleg was born, in whose days the  earth was divided. 11:16. Peleg was 30 when Reu was born. 11:18. Reu  was 32 when Serug was born. 11:20. Serug was 30 when Nahor was born.  11:22. Nahor was 29 when Terah was born. 11:24. Terah was 70 when Haran  and Abraham were born. 11:26.    47. There is some difficulty in the account given by Moses of Abraham's  birth. Some have supposed that Abraham was not born until Terah was 130  years old. This conclusion is drawn from a variety of scriptures, which  are not to our purpose at present to quote. Neither is it a matter of  any consequence to us whether Abraham was born when Terah was 70 years  old, or 130. But in order that there may no doubt exist upon any mind  in relation to the object lying immediately before us, in presenting  the present chronology we will date the birth of Abraham at the latest  period, that is, when Terah was 130 years old. It appears from this  account that from the flood to the birth of Abraham, was 352 years.    48. Moses informs us that Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad, 500  years. Gen. 11:11. This added to 100 years, which was his age when  Arphaxad was born, makes him 600 years old when he died. Arphaxad lived  after he begat Salah, 403 years. 11:13. This added to 35 years, which  was his age when Salah was born, makes him 438 years old when he died.  Salah lived after he begat Eber, 403 years. 11:15.--This added to 30  years, which was his age when Eber was born, makes him 433 years old  when he died.--Eber lived after he begat Peleg, 430 years. 11:17. This  added to 34 years, which was his age when Peleg was born, makes him  464 years old. Peleg lived after he begat Reu, 209 years. 11:19. This  added to 30 years, which was his age when Reu was born, makes him 239  years old when he died. Reu lived, after he begat Serug, 207 years.  Gen. 11:21. This added to 32 years, which was his age when Serug was  born, makes him 239 years old when he died. Serug lived after he begat  Nahor, 200 years. 11:23. This added to 30 years, which was his age when  Nahor was born, makes him 230 years old when he died. Nahor lived after  he begat Terah, 119 years. 11:25. This added to 29 years, which was his  age when Terah was born, makes him 148 years old when he died. Terah  was 130 years old when Abraham was born, and is supposed to have lived  75 years after his birth: making him 205 years old when he died.    49. Agreeable to this last account, Peleg died in the 1996th year of  the world, Nahor in the 1997th, and Noah in the 2006th. So that Peleg,  in whose days the earth was divided, and Nahor, the grandfather of  Abraham, both died before Noah--the former being 239 years old, and the  latter 148. And who cannot but see that they must have had a long and  intimate acquaintance with Noah?    50. Reu died in the 2026th year of the world, Serug in the 2049th,  Terah in the 2083rd, Arphaxad in the 2096th, Salah in the 2126th, Shem  in the 2158th, Abraham in the 2183rd, and Eber in the 2187th: which was  four years after Abraham's death. And Eber was the fourth from Noah.    51. Nahor, Abraham's brother, was 58 years old when Noah died, Terah  128, Serug 187, Reu 219, Eber 283, Salah 313, Arphaxad 344, and Shem  448.    52. It appears from this account, that Nahor, brother of Abraham,  Terah, Nahor, Serug, Reu, Peleg, Eber, Salah, Arphaxad, Shem, and Noah,  all lived on the earth at the same time. And that Abraham was 18 years  old when Reu died, 41 when Serug and his brother Nahor died, 75 when  Terah died, 88 when Arphaxad died, 118 when Salah died, 150 when Shem  died, and that Eber lived 4 years after Abraham's death. And that Shem,  Arphaxad, Salah, Eber, Reu, Serug, Terah, and Nahor, the brother of  Abraham, and Abraham, lived at the same time.--And that Nahor, brother  of Abraham, Terah, Serug, Reu, Eber, Salah, Arphaxad, and Shem, were  all acquainted with both Noah and Abraham.    53. We have now traced the chronology of the world agreeable to the  account given in our present Bible, from Adam to Abraham, and have  clearly determined, beyond the power of controversy, that there was  no difficulty in preserving the knowledge of God in the world from  the creation of Adam, and the manifestation made to his immediate  descendants, as set forth in the former part of this lecture, so that  the students in this class need not have any dubiety resting on their  minds, on this subject; for they can easily see, that it is impossible  for it to be otherwise; but that the knowledge of the existence of a  God, must have continued from father to son, as a matter of tradition  at least. For we cannot suppose, that a knowledge of this important  fact, could have existed in the mind of any of the before--mentioned  individuals, without their having made it known to their posterity.    54. We have now shown how it was that the first thought ever existed  in the mind of any individual, that there was such a Being as a God,  who had created and did uphold all things: that it was by reason of the  manifestation which he first made to our father Adam, when he stood in  his presence, and conversed with him face to face, at the time of his  creation.    55. Let us here observe, that after any portion of the human family  are made acquainted with the important fact that there is a God, who  has created and does uphold all things, the extent of their knowledge,  respecting his character and glory, will depend upon their diligence  and faithfulness in seeking after him, until like Enoch the brother of  Jared, and Moses, they shall obtain faith in God, and power with him to  behold him face to face.    56. We have now clearly set forth how it is, and how it was, that  God became an object of faith for rational beings; and also, upon  what foundation the testimony was based, which excited the inquiry  and diligent search of the ancient saints, to seek after and obtain  a knowledge of the glory of God; and we have seen that it was human  testimony, and human testimony only, that excited this enquiry, in  the first instance, in their minds--it was the credence they gave to  the testimony of their fathers--this testimony having aroused their  minds to inquire after the knowledge of God, the enquiry frequently  terminated, indeed always terminated when rightly pursued, in the most  glorious discoveries, and eternal certainty.    _Question_.--Is there a being who has faith in himself, independently?    _Answer_.--There is. Q. Who is it? A. It is God. Q. How do you prove  that God has faith in himself independently?    A. Because he is omnipotent, omnipresent, and omniscient; without  beginning of days or end of life, and in him all fullness dwells. Eph  1:23: Which is his body, the fullness of him that filleth all in all.  Col 1:19. For it pleased the Father, that in him should all fullness  dwell. [§ II. ¶ 2.]    Q. Is he the object in whom the faith of all other rational and  accountable beings center, for life and salvation?    A. He is.    Q. How do you prove it?    A. Isa. 45:22. Look unto me and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth:  for I am God, and there is none else. Romans 11:34,35,36. For who hath  known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counselor? or who  hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?  For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things, to whom be  glory for ever. Amen. Isa. 40: from the 8th to the 18th verses. O Zion  that bringest good tidings; [or, O thou that tellest good tidings to  Zion?] get you up into the high mountain: O Jerusalem, that bringest  good tidings; [or, O thou that tellest good tidings to Jerusalem] lift  up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the  cities of Judah, Behold your God! Behold the Lord your God will come  with strong hand [or, against the strong]; and his arm shall rule for  him: behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him. [Or, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5669"],[0,"Considerations on Representative Government (#4)"],[1,"of a government are not a fixed  thing, but different in different states of society; much more  extensive in a backward than in an advanced state. And, secondly, the  character of a government or set of political institutions can not be  sufficiently estimated while we confine our attention to the  legitimate sphere of governmental functions; for, though the goodness  of a government is necessarily circumscribed within that sphere, its  badness unhappily is not. Every kind and degree of evil of which  mankind are susceptible may be inflicted on them by their government,  and none of the good which social existence is capable of can be any  further realized than as the constitution of the government is  compatible with, and allows scope for, its attainment. Not to speak of  indirect effects, the direct meddling of the public authorities has no  necessary limits but those of human life, and the influence of  government on the well-being of society can be considered or estimated  in reference to nothing less than the whole of the interests of  humanity.    Being thus obliged to place before ourselves, as the test of good and  bad government, so complex an object as the aggregate interests of  society, we would willingly attempt some kind of classification of  those interests, which, bringing them before the mind in definite  groups, might give indication of the qualities by which a form of  government is fitted to promote those various interests respectively.  It would be a great facility if we could say the good of society  consists of such and such elements; one of these elements requires  such conditions, another such others; the government, then, which  unites in the greatest degree all these conditions, must be the best.  The theory of government would thus be built up from the separate  theorems of the elements which compose a good state of society.    Unfortunately, to enumerate and classify the constituents of social  well-being, so as to admit of the formation of such theorems is no  easy task. Most of those who, in the last or present generation, have  applied themselves to the philosophy of politics in any comprehensive  spirit, have felt the importance of such a classification, but the  attempts which have been made toward it are as yet limited, so far as  I am aware, to a single step. The classification begins and ends with  a partition of the exigencies of society between the two heads of  Order and Progress (in the phraseology of French thinkers); Permanence  and Progression, in the words of Coleridge. This division is plausible  and seductive, from the apparently clean-cut opposition between its  two members, and the remarkable difference between the sentiments to  which they appeal. But I apprehend that (however admissible for  purposes of popular discourse) the distinction between Order, or  Permanence and Progress, employed to define the qualities necessary in  a government, is unscientific and incorrect.    For, first, what are Order and Progress? Concerning Progress there is  no difficulty, or none which is apparent at first sight. When Progress  is spoken of as one of the wants of human society, it may be supposed  to mean Improvement. That is a tolerably distinct idea. But what is  Order? Sometimes it means more, sometimes less, but hardly ever the  whole of what human society needs except improvement.    In its narrowest acceptation, Order means Obedience. A government is  said to preserve order if it succeeds in getting itself obeyed. But  there are different degrees of obedience, and it is not every degree  that is commendable. Only an unmitigated despotism demands that the  individual citizen shall obey unconditionally every mandate of persons  in authority. We must at least limit the definition to such mandates  as are general, and issued in the deliberate form of laws. Order, thus  understood, expresses, doubtless, an indispensable attribute of  government. Those who are unable to make their ordinances obeyed, can  not be said to govern. But, though a necessary condition, this is not  the object of government. That it should make itself obeyed is  requisite, in order that it may accomplish some other purpose. We are  still to seek what is this other purpose, which government ought to  fulfill abstractedly from the idea of improvement, and which has to be  fulfilled in every society, whether stationary or progressive.    In a sense somewhat more enlarged, Order means the preservation of  peace by the cessation of private violence. Order is said to exist  where the people of the country have, as a general rule, ceased to  prosecute their quarrels by private force, and acquired the habit of  referring the decision of their disputes and the redress of their  injuries to the public authorities. But in this larger use of the  term, as well as in the former narrow one, Order expresses rather one  of the conditions of government, than either its purpose or the  criterion of its excellence; for the habit may be well established of  submitting to the government, and referring all disputed matters to  its authority, and yet the manner in which the government deals with  those disputed matters, and with the other things about which it  concerns itself, may differ by the whole interval which divides the  best from the worst possible.    If we intend to comprise in the idea of Order all that society  requires from its government which is not included in the idea of  Progress, we must define Order as the preservation of all kinds and  amounts of good which already exist, and Progress as consisting in the  increase of them. This distinction does comprehend in one or the other  section every thing which a government can be required to promote.  But, thus understood, it affords no basis for a philosophy of  government. We can not say that, in constituting a polity, certain  provisions ought to be made for Order and certain others for Progress,  since the conditions of Order, in the sense now indicated, and those  of Progress, are not opposite, but the same. The agencies which tend  to preserve the social good which already exists are the very same  which promote the increase of it, and _vice versa_, the sole  difference being, that a greater degree of those agencies is required  for the latter purpose than for the former.    What, for example, are the qualities in the citizens individually  which conduce most to keep up the amount of good conduct, of good  management, of success and prosperity, which already exist in society?  Every body will agree that those qualities are industry, integrity,  justice, and prudence. But are not these, of all qualities, the most  conducive to improvement? and is not any growth of these virtues in  the community in itself the greatest of improvements? If so, whatever  qualities in the government are promotive of industry, integrity,  justice, and prudence, conduce alike to permanence and to progression,  only there is needed more of those qualities to make the society  decidedly progressive than merely to keep it permanent.    What, again, are the particular attributes in human beings which seem  to have a more especial reference to Progress, and do not so directly  suggest the ideas of Order and Preservation? They are chiefly the  qualities of mental activity, enterprise, and courage. But are not all  these qualities fully as much required for preserving the good we have  as for adding to it? If there is any thing certain in human affairs,  it is that valuable acquisitions are only to be retained by the  continuation of the same energies which gained them. Things left to  take care of themselves inevitably decay. Those whom success induces  to relax their habits of care and thoughtfulness, and their  willingness to encounter disagreeables, seldom long retain their good  fortune at its height. The mental attribute which seems exclusively  dedicated to Progress, and is the culmination of the tendencies to it,  is Originality, or Invention. Yet this is no less necessary for  Permanence, since, in the inevitable changes of human affairs, new  inconveniences and dangers continually grow up, which must be  encountered by new resources and contrivances, in order to keep things  going on even only as well as they did before. Whatever qualities,  therefore, in a government, tend to encourage activity, energy,  courage, originality, are requisites of Permanence as well as of  Progress, only a somewhat less degree of them will, on the average,  suffice for the former purpose than for the latter.    To pass now from the mental to the outward and objective requisites of  society: it is impossible to point out any contrivance in politics, or  arrangement of social affairs, which conduces to Order only, or to  Progress only; whatever tends to either promotes both. Take, for  instance, the common institution of a police. Order is the object  which seems most immediately interested in the efficiency of this part  of the social organization. Yet, if it is effectual to promote Order,  that is, if it represses crime, and enables every one to feel his  person and property secure, can any state of things be more conducive  to Progress? The greater security of property is one of the main  conditions and causes of greater production, which is Progress in its  most familiar and vulgarest aspect. The better repression of crime  represses the dispositions which tend to crime, and this is Progress  in a somewhat higher sense. The release of the individual from the  cares and anxieties of a state of imperfect protection sets his  faculties free to be employed in any new effort for improving his own  state and that of others, while the same cause, by attaching him to  social existence, and making him no longer see present or prospective  enemies in his fellow creatures, fosters all those feelings of  kindness and fellowship towards others, and interest in the general  well-being of the"]]]
