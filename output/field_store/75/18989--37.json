Take that egg somewhere where it can't be hatched for  two thousand years, and where, when that time's up, some one will light  a fire of sweet wood and aromatic gums, and put the egg in to hatch;\"  and you see it's all come out exactly as I said. The words were no  sooner out of my beak than egg and carpet disappeared. The royal lovers  assisted to arrange my pile, and soothed my last moments. I burnt myself  up and knew no more till I awoke on yonder altar.'    It pointed its claw at the grate.    'But the carpet,' said Robert, 'the magic carpet that takes you anywhere  you wish. What became of that?'    'Oh, THAT?' said the Phoenix, carelessly--'I should say that that is the  carpet. I remember the pattern perfectly.'    It pointed as it spoke to the floor, where lay the carpet which mother  had bought in the Kentish Town Road for twenty-two shillings and  ninepence.    At that instant father's latch-key was heard in the door.    'OH,' whispered Cyril, 'now we shall catch it for not being in bed!'    'Wish yourself there,' said the Phoenix, in a hurried whisper, 'and then  wish the carpet back in its place.'    No sooner said than done. It made one a little giddy, certainly, and a  little breathless; but when things seemed right way up again, there the  children were, in bed, and the lights were out.    They heard the soft voice of the Phoenix through the darkness.    'I shall sleep on the cornice above your curtains,' it said. 'Please  don't mention me to your kinsfolk.'    'Not much good,' said Robert, 'they'd never believe us. I say,' he  called through the half-open door to the girls; 'talk about adventures  and things happening. We ought to be able to get some fun out of a magic  carpet AND a Phoenix.'    'Rather,' said the girls, in bed.    'Children,' said father, on the stairs, 'go to sleep at once. What do  you mean by talking at this time of night?'    No answer was expected to this question, but under the bedclothes Cyril  murmured one.    'Mean?' he said. 'Don't know what we mean. I don't know what anything  means.'    'But we've got a magic carpet AND a Phoenix,' said Robert.    'You'll get something else if father comes in and catches you,' said  Cyril. 'Shut up, I tell you.'    Robert shut up. But he knew as well as you do that the adventures of  that carpet and that Phoenix were only just beginning.    Father and mother had not the least idea of what had happened in their  absence. This is often the case, even when there are no magic carpets or  Phoenixes in the house.    The next morning--but I am sure you would rather wait till the next  chapter before you hear about THAT.        CHAPTER 2. THE TOPLESS TOWER      The children had seen the Phoenix-egg hatched in the flames in their own  nursery grate, and had heard from it how the carpet on their own nursery  floor was really the wishing carpet, which would take them anywhere they  chose. The carpet had transported them to bed just at the right  moment, and the Phoenix had gone to roost on the cornice supporting the  window-curtains of the boys' room.    'Excuse me,' said a gentle voice, and a courteous beak opened, very  kindly and delicately, the right eye of Cyril. 'I hear the slaves below  preparing food. Awaken! A word of explanation and arrangement... I do  wish you wouldn't--'    The Phoenix stopped speaking and fluttered away crossly to the  cornice-pole; for Cyril had hit out, as boys do when they are awakened  suddenly, and the Phoenix was not used to boys, and his feelings, if not  his wings, were hurt.    'Sorry,' said Cyril, coming awake all in a minute. 'Do come back! What  was it you were saying? Something about bacon and rations?'    The Phoenix fluttered back to the brass rail at the foot of the bed.    'I say--you ARE real,' said Cyril. 'How ripping! And the carpet?'    'The carpet is as real as it ever was,' said the Phoenix, rather  contemptuously; 'but, of course, a carpet's only a carpet, whereas a  Phoenix is superlatively a Phoenix.'    'Yes, indeed,' said Cyril, 'I see it is. Oh, what luck! Wake up, Bobs!  There's jolly well something to wake up for today. And it's Saturday,  too.'    'I've been reflecting,' said the Phoenix, 'during the silent watches  of the night, and I could not avoid the conclusion that you were quite  insufficiently astonished at my appearance yesterday. The ancients were  always VERY surprised. Did you, by chance, EXPECT my egg to hatch?'    'Not us,' Cyril said.    'And if we had,' said Anthea, who had come in in her nightie when she  heard the silvery voice of the Phoenix, 'we could never, never have  expected it to hatch anything so splendid as you.'    The bird smiled. Perhaps you've never seen a bird smile?    'You see,' said Anthea, wrapping herself in the boys' counterpane, for  the morning was chill, 'we've had things happen to us before;' and she  told the story of the Psammead, or sand-fairy.    'Ah yes,' said the Phoenix; 'Psammeads were rare, even in my time. I  remember I used to be called the Psammead of the Desert. I was always  having compliments paid me; I can't think why.'    'Can YOU give wishes, then?' asked Jane, who had now come in too.    'Oh, dear me, no,' said the Phoenix, contemptuously, 'at least--but I  hear footsteps approaching. I hasten to conceal myself.' And it did.    I think I said that this day was Saturday. It was also cook's birthday,  and mother had allowed her and Eliza to go to the Crystal Palace with a  party of friends, so Jane and Anthea of course had to help to make beds  and to wash up the breakfast cups, and little things like that. Robert  and Cyril intended to spend the morning in conversation with the  Phoenix, but the bird had its own ideas about this.    'I must have an hour or two's quiet,' it said, 'I really must. My nerves  will give way unless I can get a little rest. You must remember it's two  thousand years since I had any conversation--I'm out of practice, and I  must take care of myself. I've often been told that mine is a valuable  life.' So it nestled down inside an old hatbox of father's, which had  been brought down from the box-room some days before, when a helmet was  suddenly needed for a game of tournaments, with its golden head under  its golden wing, and went to sleep. So then Robert and Cyril moved  the table back and were going to sit on the carpet and wish themselves  somewhere else. But before they could decide on the place, Cyril said--    'I don't know. Perhaps it's rather sneakish to begin without the girls.'    'They'll be all the morning,' said Robert, impatiently. And then a thing  inside him, which tiresome books sometimes call the 'inward monitor',  said, 'Why don't you help them, then?'    Cyril's 'inward monitor' happened to say the same thing at the same  moment, so the boys went and helped to wash up the tea-cups, and to dust  the drawing-room. Robert was so interested that he proposed to clean  the front doorsteps--a thing he had never been allowed to do. Nor was  he allowed to do it on this occasion. One reason was that it had already  been done by cook.    When all the housework was finished, the girls dressed the happy,  wriggling baby in his blue highwayman coat and three-cornered hat, and  kept him amused while mother changed her dress and got ready to take  him over to granny's. Mother always went to granny's every Saturday,  and generally some of the children went with her; but today they were to  keep house. And their hearts were full of joyous and delightful feelings  every time they remembered that the house they would have to keep had a  Phoenix in it, AND a wishing carpet.    You can always keep the Lamb good and happy for quite a long time if you  play the Noah's Ark game with him. It is quite simple. He just sits on  your lap and tells you what animal he is, and then you say the little  poetry piece about whatever animal he chooses to be.    Of course, some of the animals, like the zebra and the tiger, haven't  got any poetry, because they are so difficult to rhyme to. The Lamb  knows quite well which are the poetry animals.    'I'm a baby bear!' said the Lamb, snugging down; and Anthea began:           'I love my little baby bear,       I love his nose and toes and hair;       I like to hold him in my arm,       And keep him VERY safe and warm.'      And when she said 'very', of course there was a real bear's hug.    Then came the eel, and the Lamb was tickled till he wriggled exactly  like a real one:           'I love my little baby eel,       He is so squidglety to feel;       He'll be an eel when he is big--       But now he's just--a--tiny SNIG!'      Perhaps you didn't know that a snig was a baby eel? It is, though, and  the Lamb knew it.    'Hedgehog now-!' he said; and Anthea went on:           'My baby hedgehog, how I like ye,       Though your back's so prickly-spiky;       Your front is very soft, I've found,       So I must love you front ways round!'      And then she loved him front ways round, while he squealed with  pleasure.    It is a very baby game, and, of course, the rhymes are only meant for  very, very small people--not for people who are old enough to read  books, so I won't tell you any more of them.    By the time the Lamb had been a baby lion and a baby weazel, and a baby  rabbit and a baby rat, mother was ready; and she and the Lamb, having  been kissed by everybody and hugged as thoroughly as it is possible to  be when you're dressed for out-of-doors, were seen to the tram by the  boys. When the boys came back, every one looked at every one else and  said--    'Now!'    They locked the front door and they locked the back door, and they  fastened all the windows. They moved the table and chairs off the  carpet, and Anthea swept it.    'We must show it a LITTLE attention,' she said kindly. 'We'll give it  tea-leaves next time. Carpets like tea-leaves.'    Then every one put on its out-door things, because as Cyril said, they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8390"],[0,"Buddhism and Buddhists in China (#4)"],[1,"is far larger,  if the various subdivisions are included.    To indicate the manifold differences between these groups in Buddhism  would take us far afield and would not be profitable. It will be of  interest, however, to consider some of the chief sects. One of the sects  introduced from India is the Pure Land or the Ching T'u which holds  before the believer the \"Western Paradise\" gained through faith in  Amitâbha. Any one, no matter what his life may have been, may enter the  Western Paradise by repeating the name of Amitâbha. This sect is  widespread in China. In Japan there are two branches of it known as the  Nishi-Hongwanji and the Higashi-Hongwanji with their head monasteries in  Kyoto. They are the most progressive sects in Japan and are carrying on  missionary work in China, the Hawaiian Islands and in the United States.    Another strong sect is the Meditative sect or the Ch'an Men (Zen in  Japan). This was introduced by Bodhidharma, or Tamo, who arrived in the  capital of China in the year 520 A.D. On his arrival the emperor Wu Ti  tried to impress the sage with his greatness saying: \"We have built  temples, multiplied the Scriptures, encouraged many to join the Order:  is not there much merit in all this?\" \"None,\" was the blunt reply. \"But  what say the holy books? Do they not promise rewards for such deeds?\"  \"There is nothing holy.\" \"But you, yourself, are you not one of the holy  ones?\" \"I don't know.\" \"Who are you?\" \"I don't know.\" Thus introduced,  the great man proceeded to open his missionary-labors by sitting down  opposite a wall arid gazing at it for the next nine years. From this he  has been called the \"wall-gazer.\" He and his successors promulgated the  doctrine that neither the scriptures, the ritual nor the organization,  in fact nothing outward had any value in the attainment of  enlightenment. They held that the heart of the universe is Buddha and  that apart from the heart or the thought all is unreal. They thought  themselves back into the universal Buddha and then found the Buddha  heart in all nature. Thus they awakened the spirit which permeated  nature, art and literature and made the whole world kin with the spirit  of the Buddha.        \"The golden light upon the sunkist peaks,    The water murmuring in the pebbly creeks,    Are Buddha. In the stillness, hark, he speaks!\"      [Footnote: K. J. Saunders in _Epochs of Buddhist History._]    Such pantheism and quietism often lead to a confusion in moral  relations, but these mystics were quite correct in their morals because  they checked up their mysticism with the moral system of the Buddha.    Still another important sect originated in the sixth century A. D. on  Chinese soil, namely, the T'ien T'ai (Japanese Tendai), so called  because it started in a monastery situated on the beautiful T'ien T'ai  mountains south of Ningpo. Chih K'ai, the founder, realized that  Buddhism contained a great mass of contradictory teachings and practice,  all attributed to the Buddha. He sought for a harmonizing principle and  found it in the arbitrary theory that these teachings were given to  different people on five different occasions and hence the  discrepancies. The practical message of this sect has been that all  beings have the Buddha heart and that the Buddha loves all beings, so  that all beings may attain salvation, which consists in the full  realization of the Buddha heart latent in them.    There was a time when these sects were very active and flourishing in  China. At the present time the various tendencies for which they stood  have been adopted by Buddhism as a whole and the various sectaries,  though still keeping the name of the sect, live peacefully in the same  monastery. All the monasteries practice meditation, believe in the  paradise of Amitâbha, and are enjoying the ironic calm advocated by the  T'ien T'ai. While the struggle among the sects of China has been  followed by a calm which resembles stagnation, those in Japan are very  active and the reader is referred to the volume of this series on  Japanese Buddhism for further treatment of the subject.    When Buddhism entered China it brought with it a new world. It was new  _practical_ and new spiritually. It brought a knowledge unknown  before regarding the heavenly bodies, regarding nature and regarding  medicine, and a practice vastly above the realm of magical arts. In  addition to these practical benefits, Buddhism proclaimed a new  spiritual universe far more real and extensive than any of which the  Chinese had dreamed, and peopled with spiritual beings having  characteristics entirely novel. In comparison with this new universe or  series of universes which Indian imagination had created, the Chinese  universe was wooden and geometric. Since it was an organized system and  a greater rather than a different one, the Chinese people readily  accepted it and made it their own.    Buddhism not only enlarged the universe and gave the individual a range  of opportunity hitherto unsuspected, but it introduced a scheme of  religious practice, or rather several of them, enabling the individual  devotee to attain a place in this spiritual universe through his own  efforts. These \"ways\" of salvation were quite in harmony with Chinese  ideas. They resembled what had already been a part of the national  practice and so were readily adopted and adapted by the Chinese.    Buddhism rendered a great service to the Chinese through its new  estimate of the individual. Ancient China scarcely recognized the  individual. He was merged in the family and the clan. Taoists, to be  sure, talked of \"immortals\" and Confucianism exhibited its typical  personality, or \"princely man,\" but these were thought of as supermen,  as ideals. The classics of China had very little to say about the common  people. The great common crowd was submerged. Buddhism, on the other  hand, gave every individual a distinct place in the great wheel  _dharma,_ the law, and made it possible for him to reach the very  highest goal of salvation. This introduced a genuinely new element into  the social and family life of the Chinese people.    Buddhism was so markedly superior to any one of the four other methods  of expressing the religious life, that it quickly won practical  recognition as the real religion of China. Confucianism may be called  the doctrine of the learned classes. It formulates their principles of  life, but it is in no strict sense a popular religion. It is rather a  state ritual, or a scheme of personal and social ethics. Taoism  recognizes the immediate influence of the spirit world, but it ministers  only to local ideals and needs. In the usages of family and community  life, ancestor worship has a definite place, but an occasional one.  Buddhism was able to leave untouched each of these expressions of  Chinese personal and social life, and yet it went far beyond them in  ministering to religious development. Its ideas of being, of moral  responsibility and of religious relationships furnished a new psychology  which with all its imperfections far surpassed that of the Chinese.  Buddhism's organization was so satisfying and adaptable that not only  was it taken over readily by the Chinese, but it has also persisted in  China without marked changes since its introduction. Most of all it  stressed personal salvation and promised an escape from the impersonal  world of distress and hunger which surrounds the average Chinese into a  heaven ruled by Amitâbha [Footnote: Amitâbha, meaning \"infinite light,\"  is the Sanskrit name of one of the Buddhas moat highly revered in China.  The usual Chinese equivalent is Omi-To-Fo.] the Merciful. The  obligations of Buddhism are very definite and universally recognized. It  enforces high standards of living, but has added significance because it  draws each devotee into a sort of fellowship with the divine, and mates  not this life alone, but this life plus a future life, the end of human  activity. Buddhism, therefore, really expresses the deepest religious  life of the people of China.    It will be worth while to note some illustrations of the conviction of  the Chinese people that there are three religions to which they owe  allegiance and yet that these are essentially one. They often say, \"The  three teachings are the whole teaching.\" An old scholar is reported to  have remarked, \"The three roads are different, but they lead to the same  source.\" A common story reports that Confucius was asked in the other  world about drinking wine, which Buddhists forbid but Taoists permit.  Confucius replied: \"If I do not drink I become a Buddha. If I drink I  become an Immortal. Well, if there is wine, I shall drink; if there is  none, I shall abstain.\" This expresses characteristically the Chinese  habit of adaptation. Such a decision sounds quite up to date.    The Ethical Culture Society of Peking, recently organized, has upon its  walls pictures of Buddha, Lao Tzu, Confucius and Christ. Its members  claim to worship Shang Ti as the god of all religions. An offshoot of  this society, the T'ung Shan She, associates the three founders very  closely with Christ. It claims to have a deeper revelation of Christ  than the Christians themselves. A new organization, the Tao Yuan, plans  to harmonize the three old religions with Mohammedanism and  Christianity.    Buddhism has consistently and continually striven to bring about a unity  of religion in China by interpenetrating Confucianism and Taoism. Quite  early the Buddhists invented the story that the Bodhisattva Ju T'ung was  really Confucius incarnate. There was at one time a Buddhist temple to  Confucius in the province of Shantung. The Buddhists also gave out the  story that Bodhisattva Kas'yapa was the incarnation of Lao Tzu, the  founder of Taoism. An artist painted Lao Tzu transformed into a Buddha,  seated in a lotus bud with a halo about his head. In front of the Buddha  was Confucius doing reverence. "]]]
