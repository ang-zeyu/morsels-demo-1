[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7386"],[0,"Egyptian Tales, Translated from the Papyri: First series, IVth to XIIth dynasty (#4)"],[1,"by his  sons; and as the beginning is lost, eight lines are here added to  explain this and introduce the subject. The actual papyrus begins with  the last few words of a previous tale concerning some other magician  under an earlier king. Then comes the tale of Khafra, next that of  Bau-f-ra, and lastly that of Hor-dedef.    It need hardly be said that these tales are quite fictitious. The king  and his successor Khafra are real, but the other sons cannot be  identified; and the confusion of supposing three kings of the Vth  Dynasty to be triplets born early in the IVth Dynasty, shows what very  vague ideas of their own history the Egyptians had when these tales were  formed. This does not prevent our seeing that they embodied some very  important traditions, and gives us an unequalled picture of the early  civilisation.    In the earliest tale or the three there seems at first sight merely a  sketch of faithlessness and revenge. But there is probably much more  in it. To read it aright we must bear in mind the position of woman in  ancient Egypt. If, in later ages, Islam has gone to the extreme of the  man determining his own divorce at a word, in early times almost the  opposite system prevailed. All property belonged to the woman; all  that a man could earn, or inherit, was made over to his wife; and  families always reckoned back further on the mother's side than the  father's. As the changes in historical times have been in the  direction of men's rights, it is very unlikely that this system of  female predominance was invented or introduced, but rather that it  descends from primitive times. In this tale we see, then, at the  beginning of our knowledge of the country, the clashing of two  different social systems. The reciter is strong for men's rights, he  brings destruction on the wife, and never even gives her name, but  always calls her merely \"the wife of Uba-aner.\" But behind all this  there is probably the remains of a very different system. The servant  employed by the mistress seems to see nothing outrageous in her  proceedings; and even the steward, who is on the master's side, waits  a day or two before reporting matters. When we remember the supremacy  in properly and descent which women held in Egypt, and then read this  tale, it seems that it belongs to the close of a social system like  that of the Nairs, in which the lady makes her selection--with  variations from time to time. The incident of sending a present of  clothing is curiously like the tale about a certain English envoy,  whose proprieties were sadly ruffled in the Nair country, when a lady  sent him a grand shawl with an intimation of her choice. The  priestesses of Amen retained to the last this privilege of choice, as  being under divine, and not human protection; but it seems to have  become unseemly in late times.    The hinging of this tale, and of those that follow it, upon the use of  magic, shows how thoroughly the belief in magic powers was ingrained  in the Egyptians. Now such a belief implies the presence of magicians,  and shows how familiar must have been the claim to such powers, and  the practising of the tricks of witchcraft, so prevalent in Africa in  modern times. The efficacy of a model, such as this crocodile of wax,  is an idea continually met with in Egypt. The system of tomb furniture  and decoration, of _ka_ statues, of _ushabtis_ or figures to work for  the deceased, and the models placed in foundation deposits, all show  how a model was supposed to have the efficacy of an actual reality.  Even in the latest tale of all (written in Ptolemaic times), Setnau  makes a model of a boat and men, to be sunk in the river to work for  him. The reconversion of the crocodile to wax, on being taken up by  the magician, reminds us of the serpent becoming again a rod when  taken up by Aaron.    The punishment of burning alive is very rarely, if ever, mentioned in  Egyptian history, though it occurs in modern Egyptian tales: and it  looks as if it were brought in here rather as a dire horror for the  climax than as a probable incident. The place of the penalty, in front  of the harem, or the private portion of the palace, was evidently for  the intimidation of other ladies.    At the close of each tale, King Khufu, to whom it is told, orders  funerary offerings by the usual formula, to be presented in honour of  the king under whom the wonder took place. On the tablets of the tombs  in the early times, there is usually recorded the offering--or, rather,  the pious desire that there should be offered--thousands of loaves, of  oxen, of gazelles, of cranes, &c., for a deceased person. Such  expression cost no more by the thousand than by the dozen, so thousands  came to be the usual expression in all ordaining of offerings.    We are so accustomed to think of tedium as something modern, that it  seems strange to find in the oldest tales [Page 16] in the world how the  first king of whom we know anything was bored by his pleasures. A reward  for discovering a new pleasure is the very basis of the tale of Sneferu;  and the wise man's remedy of a day in the country is still the best  resource, though all that we know as human history has tried its  experiments in enjoyment since then. The flavour of the ballet thrown  in, by the introduction of the damsels of the household clad in fishing  nets, is not yet obsolete in modern amusements; and even in this century  Muhammed Ali had resource to the same way of killing time, as he was  rowed about by his _harem,_ but on an artificial lake.    The use of two large oars for steering explains the detail of the  story.  The oars were one on each side of the stern, and were each  managed by a steerer. From the tale we see that the steerer led the  song of the rowers, and if the leader ceased, all that side of the  boat ceased also.. The position of the lost jewel upon the hair shows  that it was in a fillet set with inlaying, like that seen on early  figures, such as Nefert at Medum, who wears a fillet of rosettes to  retain the hair; and the position of the steering oar attached to a  post, with the handle rising high in the air, explains how it could  strike the fillet and displace the jewel.    The last tale is really double, a tale within a tale. It begins with  the wonders done by Dedi, and then goes on with the [Page 22] history  or the children about whom he prophesied to Khufu.    The village of Dedi was probably near Medum, as in the temple of Sneferu  at Medum an offering was found presented by a worshipper to the gods  of Ded-sneferu: hence the background which is here given for the scene  of Hordedef leading old Dedi. The translation of \"the designs of the  dwelling of Tahuti\" is not certain; but the passage seems to refer to  some architectural plan which was desired for the pyramid.    The story of Rud-didet is remarkable historically. She is said to be  wife of the priest of Ra, her children are sons of Ra, and they are the  first three kings of the Vth dynasty, and supplanted the line of Khufu.  This points to the Vth Dynasty having been a priestly usurpation; and on  looking at its history we see two confirmations of this. The title \"Son  of Ra\" is so common in most ages in Egypt that it is taken for granted,  and is applied in lists to any second cartouche; but it is not found  until well into the Vth Dynasty; the earlier kings were not descendants  of Ra, and it is only on arriving at this dynasty, which claimed descent  from Ra, through the wife of the priest of Ra, that we find the claim  of each king to be a \"son of Ra.\" Another confirmation of this  priestly descent is the abundance of priesthoods established for the  kings of the Vth Dynasty; a care which agrees with their having a  priestly origin; while in the tale it is particularly said that they  would build up the temples, furnish the altars with offerings, supply  the tables of libations, and increase the religious endowments.    The names of the three children are a play upon the names of the first  three kings of the Vth Dynasty. User-kaf is made into User-ref;  Sahu-ra is written Sah-ra; and Kaka is Kaku; thus making allusions to  their births. The comparison of the hair to true lapis lazuli seems  very strange; but there is often a confusion between black aind blue  in uneducated races, and _azrak_ means either dark blue or green, or  black, at present in Arabic. Lapis lazuli is brought in to the name of  the queen of Ramessu VI., who was called \"gold and lazuli,\"  _Nub-khesdeb;_ recalling the comparison here of personal beauty to  these precious materials.    It is noticeable here that in a tale of the Vth Dynasty, certainly  written as early as the XIIth Dynasty, we find professional dancers  commonly recognised, and going on travels through the country, with a  porter.    From this tale we also learn that Egyptian women underwent a  purification of fourteen days, during which they kept apart and did not  attend to any household matters. The mistress of the house here inquires  if the preparations are made for the feast on her return to household  affairs; and hears then how the beer cannot be made for lack of the barley.    The securing of the sack is just in accord with the remains of this  early period; the use of boxes, of thongs of leather for tying and of  clay sealings for securing property, were all familiar matters in the  XIIth Dynasty, as we learn from Kahun.    The present close of the tale is evidently only a stage in it, when the  treacherous maid meets with the common doom of the wicked in Egyptian  romance. How it was continued is a matter of speculation, but Khufu  ought certainly to reappear and to order great rewards for Dedi, who up  to this has only had maintenance on his requisite scale provided for  him. Yet it is imperative that the children shall be saved from his  wrath, as they are the kings of the Vth Dynasty. There may be a long  episode lost of their flight and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7401"],[0,"A Crystal Age (#4)"],[1,". I was absorbed in admiration of her graceful figure,  and--shall I be forgiven for mentioning such a detail?--her exquisitely  rounded legs under her brief and beautiful garments. To my mind the  garment was quite long enough. Every time I spoke, for my companion  still maintained the conversation and I was obliged to reply, she hung  back a little to catch my words. At such times she would also turn her  pretty head partially round so as to see me: then her glances, beginning  at my face, would wander down to my legs, and her lips would twitch and  curl a little, seeming to express disgust and amusement at the same  time. I was beginning to hate my legs, or rather my trousers, for I  considered that under them I had as good a pair of calves as any man in  the company.    Presently I thought of something to say, something very simple, which my  dignified old friend would be able to answer without intimating that he  considered me a wild man of the woods or an escaped lunatic.    \"Can you tell me,\" I said pleasantly, \"what is the name of your nearest  town or city? how far it is from this place, and how I can get there?\"    At this question, or series of questions, the young girl turned quite  round, and, waiting until I was even with her, she continued her walk at  my side, although still holding her companion's hand.    The old man looked at me with a grave smile--that smile was fast  becoming intolerable--and said: \"Are you so fond of honey, Smith? You  shall have as much as you require without disturbing the bees. They are  now taking advantage of this second spring to lay by a sufficient  provision before winter sets in.\"    After pondering some time over these enigmatical words, I said: \"I  daresay we are at cross purposes again. I mean,\" I added hurriedly,  seeing the inquiring look on his face, \"that we do not exactly  understand each other, for the subject of honey was not in my thoughts.\"    \"What, then, do you mean by a city?\" he asked.    \"What do I mean? Why, a city, I take it, is nothing more than a  collection or congeries of houses--hundreds and thousands, or hundreds  _of_ thousands of houses, all built close together, where one can  live very comfortably for years without seeing a blade of grass.\"    \"I am afraid,\" he returned, \"that the accident you met with in the  mountains must have caused some injury to your brain; for I cannot in  any other way account for these strange fantasies.\"    \"Do you mean seriously to tell me, sir, that you have never even heard  of the existence of a city, where millions of human beings live crowded  together in a small space? Of course I mean a small space comparatively;  for in some cities you might walk all day without getting into the  fields; and a city like that might be compared to a beehive so large  that a bee might fly in a straight line all day without getting out of  it.\"    It struck me the moment I finished speaking that this comparison was not  quite right somehow; but he did not ask me to explain: he had evidently  ceased to pay any attention to what I said. The girl looked at me with  an expression of pity, not to say contempt, and I felt at the same time  ashamed and vexed. This served to rouse a kind of dogged spirit in me,  and I returned to the subject once more.    \"Surely,\" I said, \"you have heard of such cities as Paris, Vienna, Rome,  Athens, Babylon, Jerusalem?\"    He only shook his head, and walked on in silence.    \"And London! London is the capital of England. Why,\" I exclaimed,  beginning to see light, and wondering at myself for not having seen it  sooner, \"you are at present talking to me in the English language.\"    \"I fail to understand your meaning, and am even inclined to doubt that  you have any,\" said he, a little ruffled. \"I am addressing you in the  language of human beings--that is all.\"    \"Well, it seems awfully puzzling,\" said I; \"but I hope you don't think I  have been indulging in--well, tarradiddles.\" Then, seeing that I was  making matters no clearer, I added: \"I mean that I have not been telling  untruths.\"    \"I could not think that,\" he answered sternly. \"It would indeed be a  clouded mind which could mistake mere disordered fancies for willful  offenses against the truth. I have no doubt that when you have recovered  from the effects of your late accident these vain thoughts and  imaginations will cease to trouble you.\"    \"And in the meantime, perhaps, I had better say as little as possible,\"  said I, with considerable temper. \"At present we do not seem able to  understand each other at all.\"    \"You are right, we do not,\" he said; and then added with a grave smile,  \"although I must allow that this last remark of yours is quite  intelligible.\"    \"I'm glad of that,\" I returned. \"It is distressing to talk and not to be  understood; it is like men calling to each other in a high wind, hearing  voices but not able to distinguish words.\"    \"Again I understand you,\" said he approvingly; while the beautiful girl  bestowed on me the coveted reward of a smile, which had no pity or  contempt in it.    \"I think,\" I continued, determined to follow up this new train of ideas  on which I had so luckily stumbled, \"that we are not so far apart in  mind after all. About some things we stand quite away from each other,  like the widely diverging branches of a tree; but, like the branches, we  have a meeting-place, and this is, I fancy, in that part of our nature  where our feelings are. My accident in the hills has not disarranged  that part of me, I am sure, and I can give you an instance. A little  while ago when I was standing behind the bushes watching you all, I saw  this young lady----\"    Here a look of surprise and inquiry from the girl warned me that I was  once more plunging into obscurity.    \"When I saw _you_,\" I continued, somewhat amused at her manner,  \"cast yourself on the earth to kiss the cold face of one you had loved  in life, I felt the tears of sympathy come to my own eyes.\"    \"Oh, how strange!\" she exclaimed, flashing on me a glance from her  green, mysterious eyes; and then, to increase my wonder and delight, she  deliberately placed her hand in mine.    \"And yet not strange,\" said the old man, by way of comment on her words.    \"It seemed strange to Yoletta that one so unlike us outwardly should be  so like us in heart,\" remarked the young man at her side.    There was something about this speech which I did not altogether like,  though I could not detect anything like sarcasm in the tone of the  speaker.    \"And yet,\" continued the lovely girl, \"you never saw him living--never  heard his sweet voice, which still seems to come back to me like a  melody from the distance.\"    \"Was he your father?\" I asked.    The question seemed to surprise her very much. \"_He_ is our  father,\" she returned, with a glance at the old gentleman, which seemed  strange, for he certainly looked aged enough to be her great-grandfather.    He smiled and said: \"You forget, my daughter, that I am as little known  to this stranger to our country as all the great and illustrious  personages he has mentioned are to us.\"    At this point I began to lose interest in the conversation. It was  enough for me to feel that I held that precious hand in mine, and  presently I felt tempted to administer a gentle squeeze. She looked at  me and smiled, then glanced over my whole person, the survey finishing  at my boots, which seemed to have a disagreeable fascination for her.  She shivered slightly, and withdrew her hand from mine, and in my heart  I cursed those rusty, thick-soled monstrosities in which my feet were  cased. However, we were all on a better footing now; and I resolved for  the future to avoid all dangerous topics, historical and geographical,  and confine myself to subjects relating to the emotional side of our  natures.    At the end our way to the house was over a green turf, among great trees  as in a park; and as there was no road or path, the first sight of the  building seen near, when we emerged from the trees, came as a surprise.  There were no gardens, lawns, inclosures or hedges near it, nor  cultivation of any kind. It was like a wilderness, and the house  produced the effect of a noble ruin. It was a hilly stone country where  masses of stone cropped out here and there among the woods and on the  green slopes, and it appeared that the house had been raised on the  natural foundation of one of these rocks standing a little above the  river that flowed behind it. The stone was gray, tinged with red, and  the whole rock, covering an acre or so of ground, had been worn or hewn  down to form a vast platform which stood about a dozen feet above the  surrounding green level. The sloping and buttressed sides of the  platform were clothed with ivy, wild shrubs, and various flowering  plants. Broad, shallow steps led up to the house, which was all of the  same material--reddish-gray stone; and the main entrance was beneath a  lofty portico, the sculptured entablature of which was supported by  sixteen huge caryatides, standing on round massive pedestals. The  building was not high as a castle or cathedral; it was a dwelling-place,  and had but one floor, and resembled a ruin to my eyes because of the  extreme antiquity of its appearance, the weather-worn condition and  massiveness of the sculptured surfaces, and the masses of ancient ivy  covering it in places. On the central portion of the building rested a  great dome-shaped roof, resembling ground glass of a pale reddish tint,  producing the effect of a cloud resting on the stony summit of a hill.    I remained standing on the grass about thirty yards from the first steps  after the others had gone in, all but the old gentleman, who still kept  with me. By-and-by, withdrawing to a stone bench under an oak-tree, he  motioned to me to take a seat by his side. He said nothing, but appeared  to be quietly enjoying my undisguised surprise and admiration.    \"A noble"]]]
