It was a very deep well, and the curb  was of rough, undressed stones. Over it, the queer, pagoda-like roof,  built by Uncle Stephen on his return from a voyage to China, was covered  with yet leafless vines.    \"It's so pretty, when the vines leaf out and hang down in long  festoons,\" said the Story Girl. \"The birds build their nests in it. A  pair of wild canaries come here every summer. And ferns grow out between  the stones of the well as far down as you can see. The water is lovely.  Uncle Edward preached his finest sermon about the Bethlehem well  where David's soldiers went to get him water, and he illustrated it by  describing his old well at the homestead--this very well--and how in  foreign lands he had longed for its sparkling water. So you see it is  quite famous.\"    \"There's a cup just like the one that used to be here in father's time,\"  exclaimed Felix, pointing to an old-fashioned shallow cup of clouded  blue ware on a little shelf inside the curb.    \"It is the very same cup,\" said the Story Girl impressively. \"Isn't it  an amazing thing? That cup has been here for forty years, and hundreds  of people have drunk from it, and it has never been broken. Aunt Julia  dropped it down the well once, but they fished it up, not hurt a bit  except for that little nick in the rim. I think it is bound up with the  fortunes of the King family, like the Luck of Edenhall in Longfellow's  poem. It is the last cup of Grandmother King's second best set. Her best  set is still complete. Aunt Olivia has it. You must get her to show it  to you. It's so pretty, with red berries all over it, and the funniest  little pot-bellied cream jug. Aunt Olivia never uses it except on a  family anniversary.\"    We took a drink from the blue cup and then went to find our birthday  trees. We were rather disappointed to find them quite large, sturdy  ones. It seemed to us that they should still be in the sapling stage  corresponding to our boyhood.    \"Your apples are lovely to eat,\" the Story Girl said to me, \"but Felix's  are only good for pies. Those two big trees behind them are the twins'  trees--my mother and Uncle Felix, you know. The apples are so dead sweet  that nobody but us children and the French boys can eat them. And that  tall, slender tree over there, with the branches all growing straight  up, is a seedling that came up of itself, and NOBODY can eat its apples,  they are so sour and bitter. Even the pigs won't eat them. Aunt Janet  tried to make pies of them once, because she said she hated to see them  going to waste. But she never tried again. She said it was better to  waste apples alone than apples and sugar too. And then she tried giving  them away to the French hired men, but they wouldn't even carry them  home.\"    The Story Girl's words fell on the morning air like pearls and diamonds.  Even her prepositions and conjunctions had untold charm, hinting at  mystery and laughter and magic bound up in everything she mentioned.  Apple pies and sour seedlings and pigs became straightway invested with  a glamour of romance.    \"I like to hear you talk,\" said Felix in his grave, stodgy way.    \"Everybody does,\" said the Story Girl coolly. \"I'm glad you like the way  I talk. But I want you to like ME, too--AS WELL as you like Felicity and  Cecily. Not BETTER. I wanted that once but I've got over it. I found  out in Sunday School, the day the minister taught our class, that it was  selfish. But I want you to like me AS WELL.\"    \"Well, I will, for one,\" said Felix emphatically. I think he was  remembering that Felicity had called him fat.    Cecily now joined us. It appeared that it was Felicity's morning to help  prepare breakfast, therefore she could not come. We all went to Uncle  Stephen's Walk.    This was a double row of apple trees, running down the western side of  the orchard. Uncle Stephen was the first born of Abraham and Elizabeth  King. He had none of grandfather's abiding love for woods and meadows  and the kindly ways of the warm red earth. Grandmother King had been a  Ward, and in Uncle Stephen the blood of the seafaring race claimed its  own. To sea he must go, despite the pleadings and tears of a reluctant  mother; and it was from the sea he came to set out his avenue in the  orchard with trees brought from a foreign land.    Then he sailed away again--and the ship was never heard of more. The  gray first came in grandmother's brown hair in those months of waiting.  The, for the first time, the orchard heard the sound of weeping and was  consecrated by a sorrow.    \"When the blossoms come out it's wonderful to walk here,\" said the  Story Girl. \"It's like a dream of fairyland--as if you were walking in  a king's palace. The apples are delicious, and in winter it's a splendid  place for coasting.\"    From the Walk we went to the Pulpit Stone--a huge gray boulder, as high  as a man's head, in the southeastern corner. It was straight and smooth  in front, but sloped down in natural steps behind, with a ledge midway  on which one could stand. It had played an important part in the games  of our uncles and aunts, being fortified castle, Indian ambush, throne,  pulpit, or concert platform, as occasion required. Uncle Edward had  preached his first sermon at the age of eight from that old gray  boulder; and Aunt Julia, whose voice was to delight thousands, sang her  earliest madrigals there.    The Story Girl mounted to the ledge, sat on the rim, and looked at us.  Pat sat gravely at its base and daintily washed his face with his black  paws.    \"Now for your stories about the orchard,\" said I.    \"There are two important ones,\" said the Story Girl. \"The story of the  Poet Who Was Kissed, and the Tale of the Family Ghost. Which one shall I  tell?\"    \"Tell them both,\" said Felix greedily, \"but tell the ghost one first.\"    \"I don't know.\" The Story Girl looked dubious. \"That sort of story ought  to be told in the twilight among the shadows. Then it would frighten the  souls out of your bodies.\"    We thought it might be more agreeable not to have the souls frightened  out of our bodies, and we voted for the Family Ghost.    \"Ghost stories are more comfortable in daytime,\" said Felix.    The Story Girl began it and we listened avidly. Cecily, who had heard it  many times before, listened just as eagerly as we did. She declared to  me afterwards that no matter how often the Story Girl told a story it  always seemed as new and exciting as if you had just heard it for the  first time.    \"Long, long ago,\" began the Story Girl, her voice giving us an  impression of remote antiquity, \"even before Grandfather King was born,  an orphan cousin of his lived here with his parents. Her name was Emily  King. She was very small and very sweet. She had soft brown eyes that  were too timid to look straight at anybody--like Cecily's there--and  long, sleek, brown curls--like mine; and she had a tiny birthmark like a  pink butterfly on one cheek--right here.    \"Of course, there was no orchard here then. It was just a field;  but there was a clump of white birches in it, right where that big,  spreading tree of Uncle Alec's is now, and Emily liked to sit among the  ferns under the birches and read or sew. She had a lover. His name was  Malcolm Ward and he was as handsome as a prince. She loved him with all  her heart and he loved her the same; but they had never spoken about  it. They used to meet under the birches and talk about everything except  love. One day he told her he was coming the next day to ask A VERY  IMPORTANT QUESTION, and he wanted to find her under the birches when he  came. Emily promised to meet him there. I am sure she stayed awake that  night, thinking about it, and wondering what the important question  would be, although she knew perfectly well. I would have. And the next  day she dressed herself beautifully in her best pale blue muslin and  sleeked her curls and went smiling to the birches. And while she was  waiting there, thinking such lovely thoughts, a neighbour's boy came  running up--a boy who didn't know about her romance--and cried out that  Malcolm Ward had been killed by his gun going off accidentally. Emily  just put her hands to her heart--so--and fell, all white and broken  among the ferns. And when she came back to life she never cried or  lamented. She was CHANGED. She was never, never like herself again; and  she was never contented unless she was dressed in her blue muslin and  waiting under the birches. She got paler and paler every day, but the  pink butterfly grew redder, until it looked just like a stain of blood  on her white cheek. When the winter came she died.
