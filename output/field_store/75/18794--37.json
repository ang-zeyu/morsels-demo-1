He also handed Phil a scrap of paper, on which he penciled:      \"LIONEL LAKE, No. 237 Broadway.\"      \"I'm ever so much obliged,\" he said. \"Good-by. I get out at the next  station.\"    Phil was congratulating himself on his good stroke of business, when the  conductor entered the car, followed by a young lady. When they came to  where Phil was seated, the young lady said:    \"That is my ring on that boy's finger?\"    \"Aha! we've found the thief, then!\" said the conductor. \"Boy, give up  the ring you stole from this young lady!\"    As he spoke he placed his hand on Phil's shoulder.    \"Stole!\" repeated Phil, gasping. \"I don't understand you.\"    \"Oh, yes, you do!\" said the conductor roughly.        CHAPTER V.    AN OVERBEARING CONDUCTOR    No matter how honest a boy may be, a sudden charge of theft is likely to  make him look confused and guilty.    Such was the case with Phil.    \"I assure you,\" he said earnestly, \"that I did not steal this ring.\"    \"Where did you get it, then?\" demanded the conductor roughly.    He was one of those men who, in any position, will make themselves  disagreeable. Moreover, he was a man who always thought ill of others,  when there was any chance of doing so. In fact, he preferred to credit  his fellows with bad qualities rather than with good.    \"It was handed me by a young man who just left the car,\" said Phil.    \"That's a likely story,\" sneered the conductor.    \"Young men are not in the habit of giving valuable rings to strangers.\"    \"He did not give it to me, I advanced him five dollars on it.\"    \"What was the young man's name?\" asked the conductor incredulously.    \"There's his name and address,\" answered Phil, drawing from his pocket  the paper handed him by Mr. Lake.    \"Lionel Lake, 237 Broadway,\" repeated the conductor. \"If there is any  such person, which I very much doubt, you are probably a confederate of  his.\"    \"You have no right to say this,\" returned Phil indignantly.    \"I haven't, haven't I?\" snapped the conductor.    \"Do you know what I am going to do with you?\"    \"If you wish me to return the ring to this young lady, I will do so, if  she is positive it is hers.\"    \"Yes, you must do that, but it won't get you out of trouble. I shall  hand you over to a policeman as soon as we reach New York.\"    Phil was certainly dismayed, for he felt that it might be difficult for  him to prove that he came honestly in possession of the ring.    \"The fact is,\" added the conductor, \"your story is too thin.\"    \"Conductor,\" said a new voice, \"you are doing the boy an injustice.\"    The speaker was an old man with gray hair, but of form still robust,  though he was at least sixty five. He sat in the seat just behind Phil.    \"Thank you, sir,\" said Phil gratefully.    \"I understand my business,\" said the conductor impertinently, \"and don't  need any instructions from you.\"    \"Young man,\" said the old gentleman, in a very dignified tone, \"I have  usually found officials of your class polite and gentlemanly, but you  are an exception.\"    \"Who are you?\" asked the conductor rudely. \"What right have you to put  in your oar?\"    \"As to who I am, I will answer you by and by. In reference to the boy,  I have to say that his story is correct. I heard the whole conversation  between him and the young man from whom he received the ring, and I can  testify that he has told the truth.\"    \"At any rate he has received stolen property.\"    \"Not knowing it to be stolen. The young man was an entire stranger to  him, and though I suspected that he was an unscrupulous adventurer, the  boy has not had experience enough to judge men.\"    \"Very well. If he's innocent he can prove it when he's brought to  trial,\" said the conductor. \"As for you, sir, it's none of your  business.\"    \"Young man, you asked me a short time since who I am. Do you want to  know?\"    \"I am not very particular.\"    \"Then, sir, I have to inform you that I am Richard Grant, the president  of this road.\"    The conductor's face was a curious and interesting study when he heard  this announcement. He knew that the old man whom he had insulted had  a right to discharge him from his position, and bully as he had shown  himself, he was now inclined to humble himself to save his place.    \"I beg your pardon, sir,\" he said in a composed tone. \"If I had known  who you were I wouldn't have spoken as I did.\"    \"I had a claim to be treated like a gentleman, even if I had no  connection with the road,\" he said.    \"If you say the boy's all right, I won't interfere with him,\" continued  the conductor.    \"My testimony would clear him from any charge that might be brought  against him,\" said the president. \"I saw him enter the car, and know he  has had no opportunity to take the ring.\"    \"If he'll give me back the ring, that's all I want,\" said the young  lady.    \"That I am willing to do, though I lose five dollars by it,\" said  Philip.    \"Do so, my boy,\" said the president. \"I take it for granted that the  young lady's claim is a just one.\"    Upon this Philip drew the ring from his finger and handed it to the  young lady, who went back to the car where her friends were sitting.    \"I hope, sir,\" said the conductor anxiously, \"that you won't be  prejudiced against me on account of this affair.\"    \"I am sorry to say that I can't help feeling prejudiced against you,\"  returned the president dryly; \"but I won't allow this feeling to injure  you if, upon inquiring, I find that you are otherwise an efficient  officer.\"    \"Thank you, sir.\"    \"I am glad that my presence has saved this boy from being the victim of  an injustice. Let this be a lesson to you in future.\"    The conductor walked away, looking quite chop-fallen, and Philip turned  to his new friend.    \"I am very much indebted to you, sir,\" he said. \"But for you I should  have found myself in serious trouble.\"    \"I am glad to have prevented an injustice, my lad. I am sorry I could  not save you from loss also. That enterprising rogue has gone off with  five dollars belonging to you. I hope the loss will not be a serious one  to you.\"    \"It was more than a third part of my capital, sir,\" said Phil, rather  ruefully.    \"I am sorry for that. I suppose, however, you are not dependent upon  your own resources?\"    \"Yes, sir, I am.\"    \"Have you no parents, then?\" asked Mr. Grant, with interest.    \"No, sir; that is, I have a step-mother.\"    \"And what are your plans, if you are willing to tell me?\"    \"I am going to New York to try to make a living.\"    \"I cannot commend your plan, my young friend, unless there is a good  reason for it.\"      \"I think there is a good reason for it, sir.\"    \"I hope you have not run away from home?\"    \"No, sir; I left home with my step-mother's knowledge and consent.\"    \"That is well. I don't want wholly to discourage you, and so I will tell  you that I, too, came to New York at your age with the same object in  view, with less money in my pocket than you possess.\"    \"And now you are the president of a railroad!\" said Phil hopefully.    \"Yes; but I had a hard struggle before I reached that position.\"    \"I am not afraid of hard work, sir.\"    \"That is in your favor. Perhaps you may be as lucky as I have been. You  may call at my office in the city, if you feel inclined.\"    As Mr. Grant spoke he put in Phil's hand a card bearing his name and  address, in Wall Street.    \"Thank you, sir,\" said Phil gratefully. \"I shall be glad to call. I may  need advice.\"    \"If you seek advice and follow it you will be an exception to the  general rule,\" said the president, smiling. \"One thing more--you have  met with a loss which, to you, is a serious one. Allow me to bear it,  and accept this bill.\"    \"But, sir, it is not right that you should bear it,\" commenced Phil.  Then, looking at the bill, he said: \"Haven't you made a mistake? This is  a TEN-dollar bill.\"    \"I know it. Accept the other five as an evidence of my interest in you.  By the way, I go to Philadelphia and Washington before my return to New  York, and shall not return for three or four days. After that time you  will find me at my office.    \"I am in luck after all,\" thought Phil cheerfully, \"in spite of the mean  trick of Mr. Lionel Lake.\"        CHAPTER VI.    SIGNOR ORLANDO.    So Phil reached New York in very fair spirits. He found himself, thanks  to the liberality of Mr. Grant, in a better financial position than when  he left home.    As he left the depot and found himself in the streets of New York, he  felt like a stranger upon the threshold of a new life. He knew almost  nothing about the great city he had entered, and was at a loss where to  seek for lodgings.    \"It's a cold day,\" said a sociable voice at his elbow.    Looking around, Phil saw that the speaker was a sallow-complexioned  young man, with black hair and mustache, a loose black felt hat, crushed  at the crown, giving him rather a rakish look.    \"Yes, sir,\" answered Phil politely.    \"Stranger in the city, I expect?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Never mind the sir. I ain't used to ceremony. I am Signor Orlando.\"    \"Signor Orlando!\" repeated Phil, rather puzzled.    \"Are you an Italian?\"    \"Well, yes,\" returned Signor Orlando, with a wink, \"that's what I am, or  what people think me; but I was born in Vermont, and am half Irish and  half Yankee.\"    \"How did you come by your name, then?\"    \"I took it,\" answered his companion. \"You see, dear boy, I'm a  professional.\"    \"A what?\"    \"A professional--singer and clog-dancer. I believe I am pretty well  known to the public,\" continued Signor Orlando complacently. \"Last  summer I traveled with Jenks & Brown's circus. Of course you've heard of  THEM. Through the winter I am employed at Bowerman's Varieties, in the  Bowery. I appear every night, and at two matinees weekly.\"    It must"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46202"],[0,"A New Witness for God (Volume 1 of 3) (#4)"],[1,"ary, is multiplied. Protestant Christendom is divided into  numerous sects between some of which the gulf of separation is almost  as broad and deep as that which separates Protestants from Catholics.  Such is the distracted condition of Protestant Christendom that sects  are daily multiplying, and confusion is constantly increasing. Nor can  one refrain from saying with Cardinal Gibbons, that \"This multiplying  of creeds is a crying scandal, and a great stumbling-block in the way  of the conversion of the heathen nations.\" [10] And I will add, equally  a stumbling-block to the conversion of the unbelievers living among  Christians.    This last class of persons named, the unbelievers living among  Christians, we must now consider; and note the effect of their assaults  upon Christianity. They are, for the most part, without organization;  without unity of purpose, except in so far as they are united in their  disbelief of revealed religion. Their position being essentially a  negative one, the incentive to organization is not active. It requires  unity of purpose and organization of effort to build; those who content  themselves with pointing out the defects, real or imagined, of the  work of the builders, or saying the structure does not answer well  the purposes for which it was erected, feel no such necessity for  organization as the builders do.    In consequence of having no organization, infidels keep no account of  their numerical strength; they publish no statistics, and therefore we  have no way of estimating how numerous they are. But no one with large  acquaintance in Christian countries, and who is in touch with the trend  of modern religious thought, can doubt that the number of unbelievers  is considerable, and their influence upon the Christian religion more  damaging than Christian enthusiasts are willing to admit.    What a motley crowd this great body of unbelievers is! First is the  downright atheist who says plainly, \"There is no God. Nothing but blind  force is operating in the universe; there is no Providence whose will  can interrupt the destined course of nature.\" Providence they set down  as a dream. \"The universe and all its varied phenomena are generated  by natural forces out of cosmic atoms, and into atoms to be again  resolved,\" is their creed.    Following the atheist is the deist, who, while not one whit behind the  atheist in rejecting revealed religion, is of the opinion that mind  is somewhere operating in the universe, but refuses to recognize that  intelligence as associated with a personality. Still that Intelligence,  whatever or wherever it be, is God; but with them is always \"It,\" never  \"He.\"    Then comes the agnostic. He prefers to suspend his judgment on  the question of Deity; and with a modesty, not always free from  affectation, says, \"I don't know. The evidence in the case is not  quite clear; in fact it is sometimes quite conflicting.\" He questions;  is debating; but you find his sympathies, at bottom, on the side of  unbelief.    Next to the agnostic comes the rationalist, who, while he leaves God  more or less of an open question, has his mind made up in respect to  Jesus Christ. He recognizes him as a good man, though mistaken on many  questions; but though he strips Jesus of all divinity, he nevertheless  recognizes him as the friend of God and of man; and sees embodied in  him, moreover, \"the symbol of those religious forces in man which are  primitive, essential and universal.\" [11]    Such are the varied classes which assail the Christian religion. Their  methods of assault, though having much in common, are as varied as  the kinds of unbelievers. The atheist mockingly asks if there be a  God why he does not make himself manifest to all the world; why he  keeps himself shrouded in mystery? Why not reveal himself to all as  well as to a chosen few? Pushing aside the testimony of those who say  they have stood in his presence, he boldly asserts there is no God,  because no one has ever seen him; he has not made himself known to men,  and in conclusion he points to the natural and uninterrupted order of  things in the universe as proof that all things are governed by blind  forces instead of intelligence, whether a personality or apart from  personality.    The deists say nearly all that the atheists say; but admitting an  intelligence back of all phenomena in the universe, they pretend to  read his will in the book of nature, [12] and contrast its perfections  with the imperfections of all written books of revelation. To them  the Bible--the Christian volume of revelation--is imperfect and  contradictory; it teaches a morality and seems to tolerate practices  unworthy of a Being of infinite goodness.    The agnostics join with the deists in their objections. They see all  the contradictions, imperfections and alleged immorality that deists  see in the Christian volume of revelation; and with them question the  authenticity and credibility of the scriptures. If they differ from  the deists in anything, it is simply in arriving at a less positive  conclusion. But the worst is to come.    There has arisen within our century, mainly in Germany, a class of  theological writers, who indeed profess a reverence both for the name  and person of Jesus Christ, and a real regard, moreover, for the  scriptures as \"embodiments of what is purest and holiest in religious  feeling;\" and yet they degrade Christ to a mere name, and strip the  scriptures of all their force as the word of God, by denying the  historical character of the Biblical narrative. Starting with the  postulate that the miraculous is impossible and never happens, or at  least has never been proven, [13] they relegate the scriptures--the New  Testament as well as the Old--to the realms of poetry, legend or myth,  because they are filled with accounts of the miraculous. [14]    This movement of theological thought had its origin in a new science,  the science of historical criticism, which had its birth in our own  nineteenth century. The new science consisted simply in applying to the  mass of materials on which much of ancient history had been hitherto  based--myths, legends and oral traditions--the rules [15] embodying  the judgment of sound discretion upon the value of different sorts  of evidence. The effect of the application of this principle to the  materials out of which our ancient histories were constructed, was to  banish to the realms of pure myth or doubtful legend much which our  fathers accepted as historical fact. The relations of ancient authors  are no longer received with as ready a belief as formerly; nor are  all ancient authors any longer put upon the same footing and regarded  as equally credible, or all parts of their work supposed to rest upon  the same basis. [16] Many old, fond theories have been shattered;  in some respects the whole face of antiquity has been changed, [17]  and instead of now looking upon the ancients as demi-gods, and the  condition in which they lived as being something supernatural, we  are made to feel that they were men of like passions with ourselves,  possessed of the same weaknesses, actuated by the same motives of self  interest, ambition, jealousy, love, hatred; and that the conditions  surrounding them were no more supernatural than those which surround  us. The science of historical criticism by the application of its main  principle has stripped ancient times of their prodigies, and has either  brought those demi-gods of legend to earth and made them appear very  human, or has banished them entirely from real existence.    So long as the leading principle of this new science was applied to  profane history alone; and the revolution it inaugurated confined  to smashing the myths of ancient Greece, Rome, Babylon, Egypt and  India, no complaints were heard. Indeed, the work was very generally  applauded. But when the same principle began to be applied to what, by  Christians at least, was considered sacred history, then an exception  was pleaded.    This difficulty was met by orthodox believers much in the same way that  an earlier question, one about miracles, was met by Conyers Middleton.  It will be remembered that the Catholic Church has always claimed for  herself the power of working miracles from the earliest days until the  present; and cites, in confirmation of her claims, testimony that seems  at once respectable and sufficient. The Protestants, with the Anglican  Church at their head, in the discussions to which reference is here  made, conceded that the possession of the gift of working miracles was  _prima facie_ evidence of divine authority and soundness of faith. [18]  So much being conceded, Protestants were puzzled when to fix the date  that miracles ceased. They were certain that no miracles had happened  in their times, but were equally positive that they had occurred in  the early Christian centuries. But the recent testimony presented by  their Catholic opponents was just as worthy of belief as the testimony  of the early Christian Fathers; in some respects it was better,  because it was within reach for examination. What was to be done? If  this recent testimony of the Catholic Church concerning miracles was  to be rejected, could the earlier testimony of the Christian Fathers  stand? The discussion had reached this point when Middleton published  his \"Free Inquiry,\" in which he held that the miracles claimed by  the Catholic Church, both in former and recent times must stand or  fall together. For if the testimony of the early Christian Fathers  and contemporary witnesses could confirm the former, the testimony of  the recent witnesses, being just as respectable as the former, and  hence as worthy of belief, would confirm the latter. Middleton met  the difficulty by rejecting all testimony to miracles after the close  of the apostolic age. When it was suggested that the New Testament  miracles might be treated in a like"]]]
