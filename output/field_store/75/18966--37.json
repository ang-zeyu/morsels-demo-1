He was not to get rid of Fret  Offut just yet, as we shall soon see.          Chapter V    On the Island of Robinson Crusoe        Ho! for South America!    Bravely did the good steamer _Standish_ keep on her long, and, at  times, stormy voyage to the far distant shore of Western South America.  She escaped the severest storms of the Northern Atlantic, Grossed the  equatorial line in fine shape, and stemmed the farious wrath of Cape Horn  in safety. But every one on board felt freer and in better spirits, when  at last they entered the Pacific regions where storms are of rare  occurrence.    The steamer's destination was Valparaiso, Chili, and the commander talked  of getting into port shortly.    Among those looking most hopefully forward to the termination of the  voyage was our hero, who had been sent by his employers on the responsible  errand of seeing that one of their engines was properly delivered and put  into good running order. He fondly believed it was the great opportunity  of his life.    He was never more surprised than he was upon finding at the last moment  that Fret Offut had been delegated to accompany him as helper.    At first he could not believe it; but there the awkward youth was, and  that he was sent for that purpose was plainly indicated by the order from  John Fowler & Co.    To his still greater surprise, the other seemed to have forgotten or  overlooked their differences, and he greeted Jack with all the warmth of  an old friend.    \"If he can afford to be friendly I can,\" thought Jack, who was not a  person to cherish long any bitterness of feeling against another, and he  resolved to treat Fret as well as possible.    This, coupled with that bond of sympathy for an associate one is sure to  have on leaving those dear to him far behind, made the two seem somewhat  like friends.    Had Jack known the truth, known the frequent and long conversations his  deceitful companion had held with the plotting Furniss, and how the latter  had worked to get Offut sent on this voyage with him, our hero would have  felt different toward the other. The second boss's parting words had been:  \"Remember you owe this opportunity to me, Fret Offut, who might have gone  but for my willingness to let you. Don't forget either that if, for any  reason, North does not get to Valparaiso you will step into his place, and  gain the honor he is anxious to get.\"    This was spoken with such signs and indications as only one in the secret  could understand, and young Offut nodded knowingly, as much as to say:    \"I understand perfectly, and will not fail in my part to gain our ends.\"    It may have been that the looked-for opportunity did not come, as he had  expected, or that his courage failed him in his cowardly purpose, for no  harm befel Jack until on the evening before the day, which, if nothing  unfavorable occurred, the commander had promised would bring them within  sight of land. Jack stood by the quarter-rail a long time watching the sun  sink into the distant water, and then the silent coming of the stars into  the firmament overhead.    It was a beautiful evening, though fleecy clouds were beginning to fringe  the horizon, and he was certain the whole sky would be obscured soon.    But his mind was more engrossed with thoughts of his parents and Jenny at  home than with the calm grandeur of a tropical sea, and he was wondering  how many months must pass before he should be able to meet her, when the  sound of a cat-like step behind him arrested his attention.    Thinking of no harm, he turned slowly to greet the one approaching, to  find himself confronted by the tall figure of Fret Offut.    A look of wild fierceness was on the other's features, and before Jack  could speak his arms were uplifted, swinging overhead a belaying pin.    Reading at a glance Offut's horrible purpose, Jack attempted to seize his  upraised hands, but he had barely made a move before the weapon descended  upon him!    With an indistinct recollection of a dull sense of pain in his head, Jack  knew no more until he was brought back to consciousness by the feeling of  water around him and it slowly dawned upon him that he had been sent  overboard from the ship into the sea by the blow from Fret Offut.    It was too dark for him to see any distance, so he listened for some sound  of the steamer.    Once he thought he caught the regular swish, swish of the big wheel; but  he must have been mistaken, for after a moment he realized that the  _Standish_ was not within hearing.    He had begun to shout for help, and this shouting he kept up until he was  hoarse, and he felt that it would be better to save all of his strength in  the great battle for life ahead.    No one, who has not been there, can know the utter hoplessness of being  castaway upon the great, boundless ocean with not even a plank to keep him  from a watery grave.    Jack North was brave and sanguine, but for a time he felt that it was  useless for him to try and keep up. Then the thought of home and loved  ones, with all the bright dreams and hopes of life, gave him the  resolution to fight for victory over defeat until the very last. He had  heard of sailors who had been cast away, and who had managed to keep  afloat a whole night and day. Might not he keep from drowning until  morning?    At any rate he would not give up while he had the strength to struggle  against fate.    Buoyed up with hopes which he knew were groundless, he swam on and on  through the dark expanse of waters girdling him.    When he had gone as far as he deemed prudent he would turn upon his back  and thus float upon the bosom of the great deep, borne by its ceaseless  tide he knew not whither.    Perhaps he was being carried further and further out to sea, or it might  be he was slowly approaching the shore of the southern continent.    That was the longest, most gloomy night Jack North ever knew. He saw nor  heard nothing of the steamer during the long hours of darkness and  desolation.    With the first faint streak of daylight he scanned the surrounding sea  with anxious, eager gaze. But whither he would look, north, south, east or  west, not an object broke the monotony of the view.    He felt that he was hopelessly lost, and he wondered in his despair if his  true fate would be known.    As it grew lighter he continued to watch the sea for some welcome sight,  until he saw, away on his left, a dark rim on the horizon. Was it a cloud  or--land?    He dared not hope it was the latter at first, but as it grew plainer he  felt a thrill of joy pass through his worn-out frame.    \"Land!\" he cried, coming near drowning in the exuberance of his new-found  discovery.    Even after he had seen land it seemed he was doomed to disappointment.    It did not appear that he had strength to reach it. Still the prospect  ahead served to give power to his weary limbs and a new lease of endurance  to his overworked body.    As he swam nearer he saw that great pointed peaks pierced the sky wherever  he looked, while abrupt walls of rock rose from the water's edge to the  height of many hundred feet.    These he realized could not be scaled by him, and as he gazed on the gray,  moss-covered rocks dripping with the spray of the ocean that continually  beat against their rugged sides, hopelessness again came near overpowering  him.    Above the granite front of this lonely island, as he believed it to be, he  could see stupendous ridges of reddish earth rise in countless numbers and  always running back toward the centre, with here and there green pastures  of grass, but he looked in vain for a break in the adamantine barrier  which made this ocean-bound realm unapproachable.    In his despair he was nearly overjoyed to suddenly see a boat, with two  men in it, come around an angle of the rock-bound shore.    He shouted as loudly as he could in his exhausted state for help, and then  gave up the battle, and sank.    But strong arms were near, and the boatmen, hearing his cries, rowed  rapidly to his assistance and picked him up as he was going down for the  last time.    When Jack recovered consciousness he found himself lying on a rude couch,  with a friendly face looking into his and his hand held by the same  person.    \"Well, here you are,\" said the man. \"I had about given up looking for you  to come out of it. You must have had a long, hard pull against the sea.\"    \"Where am I?\" asked Jack. \"Who are you?\"    \"You are on the island of Robinson Crusoe. As to myself, I am an American  by the name of William Pearce. Before I shall ask you even your name I  shall advise you to keep quiet and go to sleep if you can. You are among  friends.\"    Jack was fain to follow this well-meant advice, and a few minutes later he  was sound asleep.    It was nearly night before he awoke, and even then his friend would not  allow him to leave his couch.    \"Here is a dish of goat's milk and I will soon have some warm oat  porridge.\"    Jack felt stronger when he had partaken of the simple food offered him,  but he was still too weak to move about very much, and in less than five  minutes he was again asleep.    He did not awake until the following morning this time, when he found  himself in pretty good condition.    His host being absent at the time, he had an opportunity to examine his  surroundings. He found himself in a small hut built of the straw of wild  oats, interwoven with long, slender sticks, while the roof was treated in  the same way. Only a few rather primitive utensils of cooking and living  were to be seen, and he was wondering what sort of a hermit he had fallen  in with when the man entered.    He was past middle life, with a sunburned, bearded and honest countenance.    Upon seeing that Jack had awakened,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7849"],[0,"The Trial (#4)"],[1,"seeing them in their group by the  photographs, but these characterless, anaemic young people were indeed  officials from his bank, not colleagues of his, that was putting it too  high and it showed a gap in the omniscience of the supervisor, but they  were nonetheless junior members of staff at the bank.  How could K. have  failed to see that?  How occupied he must have been with the supervisor  and the policemen not to have recognised these three!  Rabensteiner,  with his stiff demeanour and swinging hands, Kullich, with his blonde  hair and deep-set eyes, and Kaminer, with his involuntary grin caused by  chronic muscle spasms.  \"Good morning,\" said K. after a while, extending  his hand to the gentlemen as they bowed correctly to him.  \"I didn't  recognise you at all.  So, we'll go into work now, shall we?\"  The  gentlemen laughed and nodded enthusiastically, as if that was what they  had been waiting for all the time, except that K. had left his hat in  his room so they all dashed, one after another, into the room to fetch  it, which caused a certain amount of embarrassment.  K. stood where he  was and watched them through the open double doorway, the last to go, of  course, was the apathetic Rabensteiner who had broken into no more than  an elegant trot.  Kaminer got to the hat and K., as he often had to do  at the bank, forcibly reminded himself that the grin was not deliberate,  that he in fact wasn't able to grin deliberately.  At that moment Mrs.  Grubach opened the door from the hallway into the living room where all  the people were.  She did not seem to feel guilty about anything at all,  and K., as often before, looked down at the belt of her apron which, for  no reason, cut so deeply into her hefty body.  Once downstairs, K., with  his watch in his hand, decided to take a taxi - he had already been  delayed by half an hour and there was no need to make the delay any  longer.  Kaminer ran to the corner to summon it, and the two others were  making obvious efforts to keep K. diverted when Kullich pointed to the  doorway of the house on the other side of the street where the large man  with the blonde goatee beard appeared and, a little embarrassed at first  at letting himself be seen in his full height, stepped back to the wall  and leant against it.  The old couple were probably still on the stairs.  K. was cross with Kullich for pointing out this man whom he had already  seen himself, in fact whom he had been expecting. \"Don't look at him!\"  he snapped, without noticing how odd it was to speak to free men in this  way.  But there was no explanation needed anyway as just then the taxi  arrived, they sat inside and set off.  Inside the taxi, K. remembered  that he had not noticed the supervisor and the policemen leaving - the  supervisor had stopped him noticing the three bank staff and now the  three bank staff had stopped him noticing the supervisor.  This showed  that K. was not very attentive, and he resolved to watch himself more  carefully in this respect.  Nonetheless, he gave it no thought as he  twisted himself round and leant over onto the rear shelf of the car to  catch sight of the supervisor and the policemen if he could.  But he  turned back round straight away and leant comfortably into the corner of  the taxi without even having made the effort to see anyone.  Although it  did not seem like it, now was just the time when he needed some  encouragement, but the gentlemen seemed tired just then, Rabensteiner  looked out of the car to the right, Kullich to the left and only Kaminer  was there with his grin at K.'s service.  It would have been inhumane to  make fun of that.            That spring, whenever possible, K. usually spent his evenings  after work - he usually stayed in the office until nine o'clock - with a  short walk, either by himself or in the company of some of the bank  officials, and then he would go into a pub where he would sit at the  regulars' table with mostly older men until eleven.  There were,  however, also exceptions to this habit, times, for instance, when K. was  invited by the bank's manager (whom he greatly respected for his  industry and trustworthiness) to go with him for a ride in his car or to  eat dinner with him at his large house.  K. would also go, once a week,  to see a girl called Elsa who worked as a waitress in a wine bar through  the night until late in the morning.  During the daytime she only  received visitors while still in bed.            That evening, though, - the day had passed quickly with a lot of  hard work and many respectful and friendly birthday greetings - K.  wanted to go straight home.  Each time he had any small break from the  day's work he considered, without knowing exactly what he had in mind,  that Mrs. Grubach's flat seemed to have been put into great disarray by  the events of that morning, and that it was up to him to put it back  into order.  Once order had been restored, every trace of those events  would have been erased and everything would take its previous course  once more.  In particular, there was nothing to fear from the three bank  officials, they had immersed themselves back into their paperwork and  there was no alteration to be seen in them.  K. had called each of them,  separately or all together, into his office that day for no other reason  than to observe them; he was always satisfied and had always been able  to let them go again.            At half past nine that evening, when he arrived back in front of  the building where he lived, he met a young lad in the doorway who was  standing there, his legs apart and smoking a pipe.  \"Who are you?\"  immediately asked K., bringing his face close to the lad's, as it was  hard to see in the half light of the landing.  \"I'm the landlord's son,  sir,\" answered the lad, taking the pipe from his mouth and stepping to  one side.  \"The landlord's son?\" asked K., and impatiently knocked on  the ground with his stick.  \"Did you want anything, sir?  Would you like  me to fetch my father?\"  \"No, no,\" said K., there was something  forgiving in his voice, as if the boy had harmed him in some way and he  was excusing him.  \"It's alright,\" he said then, and went on, but before  going up the stairs he turned round once more.            He could have gone directly to his room, but as he wanted to speak  with Mrs. Grubach he went straight to her door and knocked.  She was sat  at the table with a knitted stocking and a pile of old stockings in  front of her.  K. apologised, a little embarrassed at coming so late,  but Mrs. Grubach was very friendly and did not want to hear any apology,  she was always ready to speak to him, he knew very well that he was her  best and her favourite tenant.  K. looked round the room, it looked  exactly as it usually did, the breakfast dishes, which had been on the  table by the window that morning, had already been cleared away.  \"A  woman's hands will do many things when no-one's looking,\" he thought, he  might himself have smashed all the dishes on the spot but certainly  would not have been able to carry it all out.  He looked at Mrs. Grubach  with some gratitude.  \"Why are you working so late?\" he asked.  They  were now both sitting at the table, and K. now and then sank his hands  into the pile of stockings.  \"There's a lot of work to do,\" she said,  \"during the day I belong to the tenants; if I'm to sort out my own  things there are only the evenings left to me.\"  \"I fear I may have  caused you some exceptional work today.\"  \"How do you mean, Mr. K.?\" she  asked, becoming more interested and leaving her work in her lap.  \"I  mean the men who were here this morning.\"  \"Oh, I see,\" she said, and  went peacefully back to what she was doing, \"that was no trouble, not  especially.\"  K. looked on in silence as she took up the knitted  stocking once more.  She seems surprised at my mentioning it, he  thought, she seems to think it's improper for me to mention it.  All the  more important for me to do so.  An old woman is the only person I can  speak about it with.  \"But it must have caused some work for you,\" he  said then, \"but it won't happen again.\" \"No, it can't happen again,\" she  agreed, and smiled at K. in a way that was almost pained.  \"Do you mean  that seriously?\" asked K.  \"Yes,\" she said, more gently, \"but the  important thing is you mustn't take it too hard.  There are so many  awful things happening in the world!  As you're being so honest with me,  Mr. K., I can admit to you that I listened to a little of what was going  on from behind the door, and that those two policemen told me one or two  things as well.  It's all to do with your happiness, and that's  something that's quite close to my heart, perhaps more than it should be  as I am, after all, only your landlady. Anyway, so I heard one or two  things but I can't really say that it's about anything very serious.  No.  You have been arrested, but it's not in the same way as when they  arrest a thief.  If you're arrested in the same way as a thief, then  it's bad, but an arrest like this ... .  It seems to me that it's  something very complicated - forgive me if I'm saying something stupid -  something very complicated that I don't understand, but something that  you don't really need to understand anyway.\"            \"There's nothing stupid about what you've said, Mrs. Grubach, or  at least I partly agree with you, only, the way I judge the whole thing  is harsher than yours, and think it's not only not something complicated  but simply a fuss about nothing.  I was just caught unawares, that's  what happened.  If I had got up as soon as I was awake without letting  myself get confused because Anna wasn't there, if I'd got up and paid no  regard to anyone who might have been in my way and come straight to you,  if I'd done something like having my breakfast in the kitchen as an  exception, asked you to bring my clothes from my room, in short, if I  had behaved"]]]
