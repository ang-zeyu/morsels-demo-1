(#4)"],[1,"thing here and there about a knight that was likely  to advertise--no, I mean a knight that had influence; and he also  had a neat gift of exaggeration, for in his time he had kept door  for a pious hermit who lived in a sty and worked miracles.    Of course this novice's report lacked whoop and crash and lurid  description, and therefore wanted the true ring; but its antique  wording was quaint and sweet and simple, and full of the fragrances  and flavors of the time, and these little merits made up in a measure  for its more important lacks.  Here is an extract from it:      Then Sir Brian de les Isles and Grummore Grummorsum,    knights of the castle, encountered with Sir Aglovale and    Sir Tor, and Sir Tor smote down Sir Grummore Grummorsum    to the earth.  Then came Sir Carados of the dolorous    tower, and Sir Turquine, knights of the castle, and    there encountered with them Sir Percivale de Galis    and Sir Lamorak de Galis, that were two brethren, and    there encountered Sir Percivale with Sir Carados, and    either brake their spears unto their hands, and then    Sir Turquine with Sir Lamorak, and either of them smote    down other, horse and all, to the earth, and either    parties rescued other and horsed them again.  And Sir    Arnold, and Sir Gauter, knights of the castle,    encountered with Sir Brandiles and Sir Kay, and these    four knights encountered mightily, and brake their    spears to their hands.  Then came Sir Pertolope from    the castle, and there encountered with him Sir Lionel,    and there Sir Pertolope the green knight smote down Sir    Lionel, brother to Sir Launcelot.  All this was marked    by noble heralds, who bare him best, and their names.    Then Sir Bleobaris brake his spear upon Sir Gareth,    but of that stroke Sir Bleobaris fell to the earth.    When Sir Galihodin saw that, he bad Sir Gareth keep him,    and Sir Gareth smote him to the earth.  Then Sir Galihud    gat a spear to avenge his brother, and in the same wise    Sir Gareth served him, and Sir Dinadan and his brother    La Cote Male Taile, and Sir Sagramore le Disirous, and    Sir Dodinas le Savage; all these he bare down with one    spear.  When King Aswisance of Ireland saw Sir Gareth    fare so he marvelled what he might be, that one time    seemed green, and another time, at his again coming,    he seemed blue.  And thus at every course that he rode    to and fro he changed his color, so that there might    neither king nor knight have ready cognizance of him.    Then Sir Agwisance the King of Ireland encountered    with Sir Gareth, and there Sir Gareth smote him from    his horse, saddle and all.  And then came King Carados    of Scotland, and Sir Gareth smote him down horse and    man.  And in the same wise he served King Uriens of the    land of Gore.  And then there came in Sir Bagdemagus,    and Sir Gareth smote him down horse and man to the    earth.  And Bagdemagus's son Meliganus brake a spear    upon Sir Gareth mightily and knightly.  And then Sir    Galahault the noble prince cried on high, Knight with    the many colors, well hast thou justed; now make thee    ready that I may just with thee.  Sir Gareth heard him,    and he gat a great spear, and so they encountered    together, and there the prince brake his spear; but Sir    Gareth smote him upon the left side of the helm, that    he reeled here and there, and he had fallen down had not    his men recovered him.  Truly, said King Arthur, that    knight with the many colors is a good knight.  Wherefore    the king called unto him Sir Launcelot, and prayed him    to encounter with that knight.  Sir, said Launcelot, I    may as well find in my heart for to forbear him at    this time, for he hath had travail enough this day, and    when a good knight doth so well upon some day, it is    no good knight's part to let him of his worship, and,    namely, when he seeth a knight hath done so great    labour; for peradventure, said Sir Launcelot, his    quarrel is here this day, and peradventure he is best    beloved with this lady of all that be here, for I see    well he paineth himself and enforceth him to do great    deeds, and therefore, said Sir Launcelot, as for me,    this day he shall have the honour; though it lay in my    power to put him from it, I would not.    There was an unpleasant little episode that day, which for reasons  of state I struck out of my priest's report.  You will have noticed  that Garry was doing some great fighting in the engagement.  When  I say Garry I mean Sir Gareth.  Garry was my private pet name  for him; it suggests that I had a deep affection for him, and that  was the case.  But it was a private pet name only, and never spoken  aloud to any one, much less to him; being a noble, he would not  have endured a familiarity like that from me.  Well, to proceed:  I sat in the private box set apart for me as the king's minister.  While Sir Dinadan was waiting for his turn to enter the lists,  he came in there and sat down and began to talk; for he was always  making up to me, because I was a stranger and he liked to have  a fresh market for his jokes, the most of them having reached that  stage of wear where the teller has to do the laughing himself while  the other person looks sick.  I had always responded to his efforts  as well as I could, and felt a very deep and real kindness for him,  too, for the reason that if by malice of fate he knew the one  particular anecdote which I had heard oftenest and had most hated  and most loathed all my life, he had at least spared it me.  It was  one which I had heard attributed to every humorous person who  had ever stood on American soil, from Columbus down to Artemus Ward.  It was about a humorous lecturer who flooded an ignorant audience  with the killingest jokes for an hour and never got a laugh; and  then when he was leaving, some gray simpletons wrung him gratefully  by the hand and said it had been the funniest thing they had ever  heard, and \"it was all they could do to keep from laughin' right  out in meetin'.\"  That anecdote never saw the day that it was  worth the telling; and yet I had sat under the telling of it  hundreds and thousands and millions and billions of times, and  cried and cursed all the way through.  Then who can hope to know  what my feelings were, to hear this armor-plated ass start in on  it again, in the murky twilight of tradition, before the dawn of  history, while even Lactantius might be referred to as \"the late  Lactantius,\" and the Crusades wouldn't be born for five hundred  years yet?  Just as he finished, the call-boy came; so, haw-hawing  like a demon, he went rattling and clanking out like a crate of  loose castings, and I knew nothing more.  It was some minutes  before I came to, and then I opened my eyes just in time to see  Sir Gareth fetch him an awful welt, and I unconsciously out with  the prayer, \"I hope to gracious he's killed!\"  But by ill-luck,  before I had got half through with the words, Sir Gareth crashed  into Sir Sagramor le Desirous and sent him thundering over his  horse's crupper, and Sir Sagramor caught my remark and thought  I meant it for _him_.    Well, whenever one of those people got a thing into his head,  there was no getting it out again.  I knew that, so I saved my  breath, and offered no explanations.  As soon as Sir Sagramor  got well, he notified me that there was a little account to settle  between us, and he named a day three or four years in the future;  place of settlement, the lists where the offense had been given.  I said I would be ready when he got back.  You see, he was going  for the Holy Grail.  The boys all took a flier at the Holy Grail  now and then.  It was a several years' cruise.  They always put in  the long absence snooping around, in the most conscientious way,  though none of them had any idea where the Holy Grail really was,  and I don't think any of them actually expected to find it, or  would have known what to do with it if he _had_ run across it.  You see, it was just the Northwest Passage of that day, as you may  say; that was all.  Every year expeditions went out holy grailing,  and next year relief expeditions went out to hunt for _them_.  There  was worlds of reputation in it, but no money.  Why, they actually  wanted _me_ to put in!  Well, I should smile.        CHAPTER X    BEGINNINGS OF CIVILIZATION    The Round Table soon heard of the challenge, and of course it was  a good deal discussed, for such things interested the boys.  The king thought I ought now to set forth in quest of adventures,  so that I might gain renown and be the more worthy to meet  Sir Sagramor when the several years should have rolled away.  I excused myself for the present; I said it would take me three  or four years yet to get things well fixed up and going smoothly;  then I should be ready; all the chances were that at the end of  that time Sir Sagramor would still be out grailing, so no valuable  time would be lost by the postponement; I should then have been  in office six or seven years, and I believed my system and machinery  would be so well developed that I could take a holiday without  its working any harm.    I was pretty well satisfied with what I had already accomplished.  In various quiet nooks and corners I had the beginnings of all  sorts of industries under way--nuclei of future vast factories,  the iron and steel missionaries of my future civilization.  In these  were gathered together the brightest young minds I could find,  and I kept agents out raking the country for more, all the time.  I was training a crowd of ignorant folk into experts--experts  in every sort of handiwork and scientific calling.  These nurseries  of mine went smoothly and privately along undisturbed in their  obscure country retreats, for nobody was allowed to come into their  precincts without a special permit--for I was afraid of the Church.    I had started a teacher-factory and a lot of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7244"],[0,"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Part 3. (#4)"],[1,"my opportunity  came about the middle of the next afternoon.  We were crossing  a vast meadow by way of short-cut, and I was musing absently,  hearing nothing, seeing nothing, when Sandy suddenly interrupted  a remark which she had begun that morning, with the cry:    \"Defend thee, lord!--peril of life is toward!\"    And she slipped down from the horse and ran a little way and stood.  I looked up and saw, far off in the shade of a tree, half a dozen  armed knights and their squires; and straightway there was bustle  among them and tightening of saddle-girths for the mount.  My pipe  was ready and would have been lit, if I had not been lost in  thinking about how to banish oppression from this land and restore  to all its people their stolen rights and manhood without disobliging  anybody.  I lit up at once, and by the time I had got a good head  of reserved steam on, here they came.  All together, too; none of  those chivalrous magnanimities which one reads so much about  --one courtly rascal at a time, and the rest standing by to see fair  play.  No, they came in a body, they came with a whirr and a rush,  they came like a volley from a battery; came with heads low down,  plumes streaming out behind, lances advanced at a level.  It was  a handsome sight, a beautiful sight--for a man up a tree.  I laid  my lance in rest and waited, with my heart beating, till the iron  wave was just ready to break over me, then spouted a column of  white smoke through the bars of my helmet.  You should have seen  the wave go to pieces and scatter!  This was a finer sight than  the other one.    But these people stopped, two or three hundred yards away, and  this troubled me.  My satisfaction collapsed, and fear came;  I judged I was a lost man.  But Sandy was radiant; and was going  to be eloquent--but I stopped her, and told her my magic had  miscarried, somehow or other, and she must mount, with all despatch,  and we must ride for life.  No, she wouldn't.  She said that my  enchantment had disabled those knights; they were not riding on,  because they couldn't; wait, they would drop out of their saddles  presently, and we would get their horses and harness.  I could not  deceive such trusting simplicity, so I said it was a mistake; that  when my fireworks killed at all, they killed instantly; no, the men  would not die, there was something wrong about my apparatus,  I couldn't tell what; but we must hurry and get away, for those  people would attack us again, in a minute.  Sandy laughed, and said:    \"Lack-a-day, sir, they be not of that breed!  Sir Launcelot will  give battle to dragons, and will abide by them, and will assail  them again, and yet again, and still again, until he do conquer  and destroy them; and so likewise will Sir Pellinore and Sir Aglovale  and Sir Carados, and mayhap others, but there be none else that  will venture it, let the idle say what the idle will.  And, la,  as to yonder base rufflers, think ye they have not their fill,  but yet desire more?\"    \"Well, then, what are they waiting for?  Why don't they leave?  Nobody's hindering.  Good land, I'm willing to let bygones be  bygones, I'm sure.\"    \"Leave, is it?  Oh, give thyself easement as to that.  They dream  not of it, no, not they.  They wait to yield them.\"    \"Come--really, is that 'sooth'--as you people say?  If they want to,  why don't they?\"    \"It would like them much; but an ye wot how dragons are esteemed,  ye would not hold them blamable. They fear to come.\"    \"Well, then, suppose I go to them instead, and--\"    \"Ah, wit ye well they would not abide your coming.  I will go.\"    And she did.  She was a handy person to have along on a raid.  I would have considered this a doubtful errand, myself.  I presently  saw the knights riding away, and Sandy coming back.  That was  a relief.  I judged she had somehow failed to get the first innings  --I mean in the conversation; otherwise the interview wouldn't have  been so short.  But it turned out that she had managed the business  well; in fact, admirably.  She said that when she told those people  I was The Boss, it hit them where they lived: \"smote them sore  with fear and dread\" was her word; and then they were ready to  put up with anything she might require.  So she swore them to appear  at Arthur's court within two days and yield them, with horse and  harness, and be my knights henceforth, and subject to my command.  How much better she managed that thing than I should have done  it myself!  She was a daisy.        CHAPTER XV    SANDY'S TALE    \"And so I'm proprietor of some knights,\" said I, as we rode off.  \"Who would ever have supposed that I should live to list up assets  of that sort.  I shan't know what to do with them; unless I raffle  them off.  How many of them are there, Sandy?\"    \"Seven, please you, sir, and their squires.\"    \"It is a good haul.  Who are they?  Where do they hang out?\"    \"Where do they hang out?\"    \"Yes, where do they live?\"    \"Ah, I understood thee not.  That will I tell eftsoons.\"  Then she  said musingly, and softly, turning the words daintily over her  tongue: \"Hang they out--hang they out--where hang--where do they  hang out; eh, right so; where do they hang out.  Of a truth the  phrase hath a fair and winsome grace, and is prettily worded  withal.  I will repeat it anon and anon in mine idlesse, whereby  I may peradventure learn it.  Where do they hang out.  Even so!  already it falleth trippingly from my tongue, and forasmuch as--\"    \"Don't forget the cowboys, Sandy.\"    \"Cowboys?\"    \"Yes; the knights, you know: You were going to tell me about them.  A while back, you remember.  Figuratively speaking, game's called.\"    \"Game--\"    \"Yes, yes, yes!  Go to the bat.  I mean, get to work on your  statistics, and don't burn so much kindling getting your fire  started.  Tell me about the knights.\"    \"I will well, and lightly will begin.  So they two departed and  rode into a great forest.  And--\"    \"Great Scott!\"    You see, I recognized my mistake at once.  I had set her works  a-going; it was my own fault; she would be thirty days getting down  to those facts.  And she generally began without a preface and  finished without a result.  If you interrupted her she would either  go right along without noticing, or answer with a couple of words,  and go back and say the sentence over again.  So, interruptions  only did harm; and yet I had to interrupt, and interrupt pretty  frequently, too, in order to save my life; a person would die if  he let her monotony drip on him right along all day.    \"Great Scott!\" I said in my distress.  She went right back and  began over again:    \"So they two departed and rode into a great forest.  And--\"    \"_Which_ two?\"    \"Sir Gawaine and Sir Uwaine.  And so they came to an abbey of monks,  and there were well lodged.  So on the morn they heard their masses  in the abbey, and so they rode forth till they came to a great  forest; then was Sir Gawaine ware in a valley by a turret, of  twelve fair damsels, and two knights armed on great horses, and  the damsels went to and fro by a tree.  And then was Sir Gawaine  ware how there hung a white shield on that tree, and ever as the  damsels came by it they spit upon it, and some threw mire upon  the shield--\"    \"Now, if I hadn't seen the like myself in this country, Sandy,  I wouldn't believe it.  But I've seen it, and I can just see those  creatures now, parading before that shield and acting like that.  The women here do certainly act like all possessed.  Yes, and  I mean your best, too, society's very choicest brands.  The humblest  hello-girl along ten thousand miles of wire could teach gentleness,  patience, modesty, manners, to the highest duchess in Arthur's land.\"    \"Hello-girl?\"    \"Yes, but don't you ask me to explain; it's a new kind of a girl;  they don't have them here; one often speaks sharply to them when  they are not the least in fault, and he can't get over feeling  sorry for it and ashamed of himself in thirteen hundred years,  it's such shabby mean conduct and so unprovoked; the fact is,  no gentleman ever does it--though I--well, I myself, if I've got  to confess--\"    \"Peradventure she--\"    \"Never mind her; never mind her; I tell you I couldn't ever explain  her so you would understand.\"    \"Even so be it, sith ye are so minded.  Then Sir Gawaine and  Sir Uwaine went and saluted them, and asked them why they did that  despite to the shield.  Sirs, said the damsels, we shall tell you.  There is a knight in this country that owneth this white shield,  and he is a passing good man of his hands, but he hateth all  ladies and gentlewomen, and therefore we do all this despite to  the shield.  I will say you, said Sir Gawaine, it beseemeth evil  a good knight to despise all ladies and gentlewomen, and peradventure  though he hate you he hath some cause, and peradventure he loveth  in some other places ladies and gentlewomen, and to be loved again,  and he such a man of prowess as ye speak of--\"    \"Man of prowess--yes, that is the man to please them, Sandy.  Man of brains--that is a thing they never think of.  Tom Sayers  --John Heenan--John L. Sullivan--pity but you could be here.  You  would have your legs under the Round Table and a 'Sir' in front  of your names within the twenty-four hours; and you could bring  about a new distribution of the married princesses and duchesses  of the Court in another twenty-four.  The fact is, it is just  a sort of polished-up court of Comanches, and there isn't a squaw  in it who doesn't stand ready at the dropping of a hat to desert  to the buck with the biggest string of scalps at his belt.\"    \"--and he be such a man of prowess as ye speak of, said Sir Gawaine.  Now, what is his name?  Sir, said they, his name is Marhaus the  king's son of Ireland.\"    \"Son of the king of Ireland, you mean; the other form doesn't mean  anything.  And look out and hold on tight, now, we must jump  this gully....  There, we are"]]]
