I am  sure your uncle and aunt must be good and worthy people, or you would  not love them so much; and for YOUR friends, Princess, there is always  room in the Land of Oz.\"    Dorothy was delighted, yet not altogether surprised, for she had clung  to the hope that Ozma would be kind enough to grant her request.  When,  indeed, had her powerful and faithful friend refused her anything?    \"But you must not call me 'Princess',\" she said; \"for after this I  shall live on the little farm with Uncle Henry and Aunt Em, and  princesses ought not to live on farms.\"    \"Princess Dorothy will not,\" replied Ozma with her sweet smile.  \"You  are going to live in your own rooms in this palace, and be my constant  companion.\"    \"But Uncle Henry--\" began Dorothy.    \"Oh, he is old, and has worked enough in his lifetime,\" interrupted the  girl Ruler; \"so we must find a place for your uncle and aunt where they  will be comfortable and happy and need not work more than they care to.  When shall we transport them here, Dorothy?\"    \"I promised to go and see them again before they were turned out of the  farmhouse,\" answered Dorothy; \"so--perhaps next Saturday--\"    \"But why wait so long?\" asked Ozma.  \"And why make the journey back to  Kansas again?  Let us surprise them, and bring them here without any  warning.\"    \"I'm not sure that they believe in the Land of Oz,\" said Dorothy,  \"though I've told 'em 'bout it lots of times.\"    \"They'll believe when they see it,\" declared Ozma; \"and if they are  told they are to make a magical journey to our fairyland, it may make  them nervous.  I think the best way will be to use the Magic Belt  without warning them, and when they have arrived you can explain to  them whatever they do not understand.\"    \"Perhaps that's best,\" decided Dorothy.  \"There isn't much use in their  staying at the farm until they are put out, 'cause it's much nicer  here.\"    \"Then to-morrow morning they shall come here,\" said Princess Ozma.  \"I  will order Jellia Jamb, who is the palace housekeeper, to have rooms  all prepared for them, and after breakfast we will get the Magic Belt  and by its aid transport your uncle and aunt to the Emerald City.\"    \"Thank you, Ozma!\" cried Dorothy, kissing her friend gratefully.    \"And now,\" Ozma proposed, \"let us take a walk in the gardens before we  dress for dinner.  Come, Dorothy dear!\"        4.  How The Nome King Planned Revenge    The reason most people are bad is because they do not try to be good.  Now, the Nome King had never tried to be good, so he was very bad  indeed.  Having decided to conquer the Land of Oz and to destroy the  Emerald City and enslave all its people, King Roquat the Red kept  planning ways to do this dreadful thing, and the more he planned the  more he believed he would be able to accomplish it.    About the time Dorothy went to Ozma the Nome King called his Chief  Steward to him and said:    \"Kaliko, I think I shall make you the General of my armies.\"    \"I think you won't,\" replied Kaliko, positively.    \"Why not?\" inquired the King, reaching for his scepter with the big  sapphire.    \"Because I'm your Chief Steward and know nothing of warfare,\" said  Kaliko, preparing to dodge if anything were thrown at him.  \"I manage  all the affairs of your kingdom better than you could yourself, and  you'll never find another Steward as good as I am.  But there are a  hundred Nomes better fitted to command your army, and your Generals get  thrown away so often that I have no desire to be one of them.\"    \"Ah, there is some truth in your remarks, Kaliko,\" remarked the King,  deciding not to throw the scepter.  \"Summon my army to assemble in the  Great Cavern.\"    Kaliko bowed and retired, and in a few minutes returned to say that the  army was assembled.  So the King went out upon a balcony that  overlooked the Great Cavern, where fifty thousand Nomes, all armed with  swords and pikes, stood marshaled in military array.    When they were not required as soldiers all these Nomes were metal  workers and miners, and they had hammered so much at the forges and dug  so hard with pick and shovel that they had acquired great muscular  strength.  They were strangely formed creatures, rather round and not  very tall.  Their toes were curly and their ears broad and flat.    In time of war every Nome left his forge or mine and became part of the  great army of King Roquat.  The soldiers wore rock-colored uniforms and  were excellently drilled.    The King looked upon this tremendous army, which stood silently arrayed  before him, and a cruel smile curled the corners of his mouth, for he  saw that his legions were very powerful.  Then he addressed them from  the balcony, saying:    \"I have thrown away General Blug, because he did not please me.  So I  want another General to command this army.  Who is next in command?\"    \"I am,\" replied Colonel Crinkle, a dapper-looking Nome, as he stepped  forward to salute his monarch.    The King looked at him carefully and said:    \"I want you to march this army through an underground tunnel, which I  am going to bore, to the Emerald City of Oz.  When you get there I want  you to conquer the Oz people, destroy them and their city, and bring  all their gold and silver and precious stones back to my cavern.  Also  you are to recapture my Magic Belt and return it to me.  Will you do  this, General Crinkle?\"    \"No, your Majesty,\" replied the Nome; \"for it can't be done.\"    \"Oh indeed!\" exclaimed the King.  Then he turned to his servants and  said: \"Please take General Crinkle to the torture chamber.  There you  will kindly slice him into thin slices.  Afterward you may feed him to  the seven-headed dogs.\"    \"Anything to oblige your Majesty,\" replied the servants, politely, and  led the condemned man away.    When they had gone, the King addressed the army again.    \"Listen!\" said he.  \"The General who is to command my armies must  promise to carry out my orders.  If he fails he will share the fate of  poor Crinkle.  Now, then, who will volunteer to lead my hosts to the  Emerald City?\"    For a time no one moved and all were silent.  Then an old Nome with  white whiskers so long that they were tied around his waist to prevent  their tripping him up, stepped out of the ranks and saluted the King.    \"I'd like to ask a few questions, your Majesty,\" he said.    \"Go ahead,\" replied the King.    \"These Oz people are quite good, are they not?\"    \"As good as apple pie,\" said the King.    \"And they are happy, I suppose?\" continued the old Nome.    \"Happy as the day is long,\" said the King.    \"And contented and prosperous?\" inquired the Nome.    \"Very much so,\" said the King.    \"Well, your Majesty,\" remarked he of the white whiskers, \"I think I  should like to undertake the job, so I'll be your General.  I hate good  people; I detest happy people; I'm opposed to any one who is contented  and prosperous.  That is why I am so fond of your Majesty.  Make me  your General and I'll promise to conquer and destroy the Oz people.  If  I fail I'm ready to be sliced thin and fed to the seven-headed dogs.\"    \"Very good!  Very good, indeed!  That's the way to talk!\" cried Roquat  the Red, who was greatly pleased.  \"What is your name, General?\"    \"I'm called Guph, your Majesty.\"    \"Well, Guph, come with me to my private cave, and we'll talk it over.\"  Then he turned to the army.  \"Nomes and soldiers,\" said he, \"you are to  obey the commands of General Guph until he becomes dog-feed.  Any man  who fails to obey his new General will be promptly thrown away.  You  are now dismissed.\"    Guph went to the King's private cave and sat down upon an amethyst  chair and put his feet on the arm of the King's ruby throne.  Then he  lighted his pipe and threw the live coal he had taken from his pocket  upon the King's left foot and puffed the smoke into the King's eyes and  made himself comfortable.  For he was a wise old Nome, and he knew that  the best way to get along with Roquat the Red was to show that he was  not afraid of him.    \"I'm ready for the talk, your Majesty,\" he said.    The King coughed and looked at his new General fiercely.    \"Do you not tremble to take such liberties with your monarch?\" he asked.    \"Oh no,\" replied Guph, calmly, and he blew a wreath of smoke that  curled around the King's nose and made him sneeze.  \"You want to  conquer the Emerald City, and I'm the only Nome in all your dominions  who can conquer it.  So you will be very careful not to hurt me until I  have carried out your wishes.  After that--\"    \"Well, what then?\" inquired the King.    \"Then you will be so grateful to me that you won't care to hurt me,\"  replied the General.    \"That is a very good argument,\" said Roquat.  \"But suppose you fail?\"    \"Then it's the slicing machine.  I agree to that,\" announced Guph.  \"But if you do as I tell you there will be no failure.  The trouble  with you, Roquat, is that you don't think carefully enough.  I do.  You  would go ahead and march through your tunnel into Oz, and get defeated  and driven back.  I won't.  And the reason I won't is because when I  march I'll have all my plans made, and a host of allies to assist my  Nomes.\"    \"What do you mean by that?\" asked the King.    \"I'll explain, King Roquat.  You're going to attack a fairy country,  and a mighty fairy country, too.  They haven't much of an army in Oz,  but the Princess who ruled them has a fairy wand; and the little girl  Dorothy has your Magic Belt; and at the North of the Emerald City lives  a clever sorceress called Glinda the Good, who commands the spirits of  the air.  Also I have heard that there is a wonderful Wizard in Ozma's  palace, who is so skillful that people used to pay him money in America  to see him perform.

He  was, however, not a missionary to be favourably received by the  public.  He seems to have behaved in a way quite opposite to that in  which a modern pastor treats his flock.  We imagine him to have been  a religious teacher entirely different in every point from a popular  Christian missionary of our age.  The latter would smile or try to  smile at every face he happens to see and would talk sociably; while  the former would not smile at any face, but would stare at it with  the large glaring eyes that penetrated to the innermost soul.  The  latter would keep himself scrupulously clean, shaving, combing,  brushing, polishing, oiling, perfuming, while the former would be  entirely indifferent to his apparel, being always clad in a faded  yellow robe.  The latter would compose his sermon with a great care,  making use of rhetorical art, and speak with force and elegance;  while the former would sit as absolutely silent as the bear, and kick  one off, if one should approach him with idle questions.      [FN#23]  Buddhist historians differ in opinion respecting the date of  Bodhidharma's appearance in China.  Compare Chwen Fah Chan Tsung Lun  (Den bo sho ju ron) and Hwui Yuen (E-gen).        3. Bodhidharma and the Emperor Wu.    No sooner had Bodhidharma landed at Kwang Cheu in Southern China than  he was invited by the Emperor[FN#24] Wu, who was an enthusiastic  Buddhist and good scholar, to proceed to his capital of Chin Liang.  When he was received in audience, His Majesty asked him: \"We have  built temples, copied holy scriptures, ordered monks and nuns to be  converted.  Is there any merit, Reverend Sir, in our conduct?\"  The  royal host, in all probability, expected a smooth, flattering answer  from the lips of his new guest, extolling his virtues, and promising  him heavenly rewards, but the Blue-eyed Brahmin bluntly answered: \"No  merit at all.\"  This unexpected reply must have put the Emperor to shame and doubt in  no small degree, who was informed simply of the doctrines of the  orthodox Buddhist sects.  'Why not,' he might have thought within  himself, 'why all this is futile?  By what authority does he declare  all this meritless?  What holy text can be quoted to justify his  assertion?  What is his view in reference to the different doctrines  taught by Shakya Muni?  What does he hold as the first principle of  Buddhism?'  Thus thinking, he inquired: \"What is the holy truth, or  the first principle?\"  The answer was no less astonishing: \"That  principle transcends all.  There is nothing holy.\"      [FN#24]  The Emperor Wu (Bu-Tei) of the Liang dynasty, whose reign  was A.D. 502-549.]      The crowned creature was completely at a loss to see what the teacher  meant.  Perhaps he might have thought: 'Why is nothing holy?  Are  there not holy men, Holy Truths, Holy Paths stated in the scriptures?   Is he himself not one of the holy men?'  \"Then who is that confronts  us?\" asked the monarch again.  \"I know not, your majesty,\" was the  laconic reply of Bodhidharma, who now saw that his new faith was  beyond the understanding of the Emperor.    The elephant can hardly keep company with rabbits.  The petty  orthodoxy can by no means keep pace with the elephantine stride of  Zen.  No wonder that Bodhidharma left not only the palace of the  Emperor Wu, but also the State of Liang, and went to the State of  Northern Wei.[FN#25]  There he spent nine years in the Shao  Lin[FN#26] Monastery, mostly sitting silent in meditation with his  face to the wall, and earned for himself the appellation of 'the  wall-gazing Brahmin.'  This name itself suggests that the  significance of his mission was not appreciated by his  contemporaries.  But neither he was nor they were to blame, because  the lion's importance is appreciated only by the lion.  A great  personage is no less great because of his unpopularity among his  fellow men, just as the great Pang[FN#27] is no less great because of  his unpopularity among the winged creatures.  Bodhidharma was not  popular to the degree that he was envied by his contemporary  Buddhists, who, as we are told by his biographers, attempted to  poison him three times,[FN#28] but without success.      [FN#25]  Northern Gi dynasty (A.D. 386-534).    [FN#26]  Sho-rin-ji, erected by the Emperor Hiao Ming of Northern Wei  A.D. 497.    [FN#27]  Chwang-tsz in his famous parable compares a great sage with  the Pang, an imaginary bird of enormous size, with its wings of  ninety thousand miles.  The bird is laughed at by wrens and sparrows  because of its excessive size.    [FN#28]  This reminds us of Nan Yoh Hwui Sz (Nan-gaku-e-shi, died  A.D. 577), who is said to have learned Zen under Bodhidharma. He says  in his statement of a vow that he was poisoned three times by those  who envied him.        4. Bodhidharma and his Successor the Second Patriarch.    China was not, however, an uncultivated[FN#29] land for the seed of  Zen--nay, there had been many practisers of Zen before Bodhidharma.      [FN#29]  The translation of Hinayana Zen sutras first paved the way  for our faith.  Fourteen Zen sutras, including such important books  as Mahanapanadhyana-sutra, Dhyanacarya-dharmasanyjnya-sutra,  Dhyanacarya-saptatrimcadvarga-sutra, were translated by Ngan Shi Kao  (An-sei-ko) as early as A.D. 148-170.  Cullamargabhumi-sutra was  translated by K' Yao (Shi-yo) in A.D. 185; Dharmatara-dhyana-sutra by  Buddhabhadra in A.D. 398-421;  Dhyananisthitasamadhi-dharma-parygya-sutra by Kumarajiva in A.D. 402;  'An Abridged Law on the Importance of Meditation' by Kumarajiva in  A.D. 405; Pancadvara-dhyanasutra-maharthadharma by Dharmamitra in  A.D. 424-441.  Furthermore, Mahayana books closely related to the  doctrine of Zen were not unknown to China before Bodhidharma.  Pratyutpanna-buddhasammukhavasthita-samadhi was translated by K' Leu  Cia Chan (Shi-ru-ga-sen) in A.D. 164-186; Vimalakirttinirdeca-sutra,  which is much used in Zen, by Kumarajiva in A.D. 384-412;  Lankavatara-sutra, which is said to have been pointed out by  Bodhidharma as the best explanation of Zen, by Gunabhadra in A.D.  433; Saddharma-pundarika-sutra, in its complete form, by Kumarajiva  in A.D. 406; Avatamsaka-sutra by Buddhabhadra in A.D. 418;  Mahaparinirvana-sutra by Dharmaraksa in A.D. 423.    If we are not mistaken, Kumarajiva, who came to China A.D. 384, made  a valuable contribution towards the foundation of Zen in that  country, not merely through his translation of Zen sutras above  mentioned, but by the education of his disciples, such as Sang Chao  (So-jo, died A.D. 414), Sang Shang (So-sho, whose writings  undoubtedly influenced later Zen teachers.  A more important  personage in the history of Zen previous to the Blue-eyed Brahmin is  Buddhabhadra, a well-known Zen master, who came over to China A.D.  406.  His translation of Dharmatara-dhyana-sutra (which is said to  have been preached by Bodhidharma himself when he was in India) and  that of Avatamsaka-sutra may be said without exaggeration to have  laid the corner-stone for Zen.  He gave a course of lectures on the  Zen sutra for the first time in China in A.D. 413, and it was through  his instruction that many native practisers of Zen were produced, of  whom Chi Yen (Chi-gon) and Huen Kao (Gen-ko) are well known.  In  these days Zen should have been in the ascendant in India, because  almost all Indian scholars-at least those known to us-were called Zen  teachers-for instance, Buddhabhadra, Buddhasena, Dharmadhi, and some  others were all Zen scholars.    Chinese Buddhist scholars did no less than Indian teachers toward the  uprising of Zen.  The foremost among them is Hwui Yuen (E-on, died  A.D. 414), who practised Zen by the instruction of Buddhabhadra.  He  founded the Society of the White Lotus, which comprised eighteen  eminent scholars of the age among its members, for the purpose of  practising Meditation and of adoring Buddha Amitabha.  We must not  forget that during the Western and the Eastern Tsin (Shin) dynasties  (A.D. 265-420) both Taoism and Buddhism grew prosperous to no small  extent.  And China produced, on the one hand, Taoists of an eccentric  type, such as the Seven Wise Men of the Bamboo Forest, while she gave  birth to many recluse-like men of letters, such as Tao Yuen Ming  (To-yen-mei, died A.D. 427) and some others on the other.  Besides  there were some scholars who studied Buddhism in connection with  Taoism and Confucianism, and led a secluded life.  To the last class  of scholars belonged Chwen Hih (Hu dai shi), known as Chwen the  Great.  He is said to have been accustomed to wear a Confucianist  hat, a Buddhist robe, and Taoist shoes.  It was in A.D. 534 that he  presented a memorial to the Emperor Wu, in which he explained the  three grades of good.  \"The Highest Good consists,\" says he, \"in the  emptiness of mind and non-attachment.  Transcendence is its cause,  and Nirvana is its result.  The Middle Good consists in morality and  good administration.  It results in a peaceful and happy life in  Heaven and in Earth.  The Lowest Good consists in love and protection  of sentient beings.\"  Thus his idea of good, as the reader will see  without difficulty, is the result of a compromise of Taoism and  Buddhism.  Sin Wang Ming (Sin-o-mei, On the Mind-King), one of his  masterpieces, together with other minor poems, are still used as a  textbook of Zen.  This fact unmistakably proves that Taoist element  found its way into the constituents of Zen from its very outset in  China.      All that he had to do was to wait for an earnest seeker after the  spirit of Shakya Muni.  Therefore he waited, and waited not in vain,  for at last there came a learned Confucianist, Shang Kwang (Shin-ko)"]]]
