Owing, perhaps, to my unusually  nervous state, I was slower than common in losing consciousness, but at  length a delicious drowsiness stole over me.        Chapter 3    \"He is going to open his eyes. He had better see but one of us at  first.\"    \"Promise me, then, that you will not tell him.\"    The first voice was a man's, the second a woman's, and both spoke in  whispers.    \"I will see how he seems,\" replied the man.    \"No, no, promise me,\" persisted the other.    \"Let her have her way,\" whispered a third voice, also a woman.    \"Well, well, I promise, then,\" answered the man. \"Quick, go! He is  coming out of it.\"    There was a rustle of garments and I opened my eyes. A fine looking man  of perhaps sixty was bending over me, an expression of much benevolence  mingled with great curiosity upon his features. He was an utter  stranger. I raised myself on an elbow and looked around. The room was  empty. I certainly had never been in it before, or one furnished like  it. I looked back at my companion. He smiled.    \"How do you feel?\" he inquired.    \"Where am I?\" I demanded.    \"You are in my house,\" was the reply.    \"How came I here?\"    \"We will talk about that when you are stronger. Meanwhile, I beg you  will feel no anxiety. You are among friends and in good hands. How do  you feel?\"    \"A bit queerly,\" I replied, \"but I am well, I suppose. Will you tell me  how I came to be indebted to your hospitality? What has happened to me?  How came I here? It was in my own house that I went to sleep.\"    \"There will be time enough for explanations later,\" my unknown host  replied, with a reassuring smile. \"It will be better to avoid agitating  talk until you are a little more yourself. Will you oblige me by taking  a couple of swallows of this mixture? It will do you good. I am a  physician.\"    I repelled the glass with my hand and sat up on the couch, although  with an effort, for my head was strangely light.    \"I insist upon knowing at once where I am and what you have been doing  with me,\" I said.    \"My dear sir,\" responded my companion, \"let me beg that you will not  agitate yourself. I would rather you did not insist upon explanations  so soon, but if you do, I will try to satisfy you, provided you will  first take this draught, which will strengthen you somewhat.\"    I thereupon drank what he offered me. Then he said, \"It is not so  simple a matter as you evidently suppose to tell you how you came here.  You can tell me quite as much on that point as I can tell you. You have  just been roused from a deep sleep, or, more properly, trance. So much  I can tell you. You say you were in your own house when you fell into  that sleep. May I ask you when that was?\"    \"When?\" I replied, \"when? Why, last evening, of course, at about ten  o'clock. I left my man Sawyer orders to call me at nine o'clock. What  has become of Sawyer?\"    \"I can't precisely tell you that,\" replied my companion, regarding me  with a curious expression, \"but I am sure that he is excusable for not  being here. And now can you tell me a little more explicitly when it  was that you fell into that sleep, the date, I mean?\"    \"Why, last night, of course; I said so, didn't I? that is, unless I  have overslept an entire day. Great heavens! that cannot be possible;  and yet I have an odd sensation of having slept a long time. It was  Decoration Day that I went to sleep.\"    \"Decoration Day?\"    \"Yes, Monday, the 30th.\"    \"Pardon me, the 30th of what?\"    \"Why, of this month, of course, unless I have slept into June, but that  can't be.\"    \"This month is September.\"    \"September! You don't mean that I've slept since May! God in heaven!  Why, it is incredible.\"    \"We shall see,\" replied my companion; \"you say that it was May 30th  when you went to sleep?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"May I ask of what year?\"    I stared blankly at him, incapable of speech, for some moments.    \"Of what year?\" I feebly echoed at last.    \"Yes, of what year, if you please? After you have told me that I shall  be able to tell you how long you have slept.\"    \"It was the year 1887,\" I said.    My companion insisted that I should take another draught from the  glass, and felt my pulse.    \"My dear sir,\" he said, \"your manner indicates that you are a man of  culture, which I am aware was by no means the matter of course in your  day it now is. No doubt, then, you have yourself made the observation  that nothing in this world can be truly said to be more wonderful than  anything else. The causes of all phenomena are equally adequate, and  the results equally matters of course. That you should be startled by  what I shall tell you is to be expected; but I am confident that you  will not permit it to affect your equanimity unduly. Your appearance is  that of a young man of barely thirty, and your bodily condition seems  not greatly different from that of one just roused from a somewhat too  long and profound sleep, and yet this is the tenth day of September in  the year 2000, and you have slept exactly one hundred and thirteen  years, three months, and eleven days.\"    Feeling partially dazed, I drank a cup of some sort of broth at my  companion's suggestion, and, immediately afterward becoming very  drowsy, went off into a deep sleep.    When I awoke it was broad daylight in the room, which had been lighted  artificially when I was awake before. My mysterious host was sitting  near. He was not looking at me when I opened my eyes, and I had a good  opportunity to study him and meditate upon my extraordinary situation,  before he observed that I was awake. My giddiness was all gone, and my  mind perfectly clear. The story that I had been asleep one hundred and  thirteen years, which, in my former weak and bewildered condition, I  had accepted without question, recurred to me now only to be rejected  as a preposterous attempt at an imposture, the motive of which it was  impossible remotely to surmise.    Something extraordinary had certainly happened to account for my waking  up in this strange house with this unknown companion, but my fancy was  utterly impotent to suggest more than the wildest guess as to what that  something might have been. Could it be that I was the victim of some  sort of conspiracy? It looked so, certainly; and yet, if human  lineaments ever gave true evidence, it was certain that this man by my  side, with a face so refined and ingenuous, was no party to any scheme  of crime or outrage. Then it occurred to me to question if I might not  be the butt of some elaborate practical joke on the part of friends who  had somehow learned the secret of my underground chamber and taken this  means of impressing me with the peril of mesmeric experiments. There  were great difficulties in the way of this theory; Sawyer would never  have betrayed me, nor had I any friends at all likely to undertake such  an enterprise; nevertheless the supposition that I was the victim of a  practical joke seemed on the whole the only one tenable. Half expecting  to catch a glimpse of some familiar face grinning from behind a chair  or curtain, I looked carefully about the room. When my eyes next rested  on my companion, he was looking at me.    \"You have had a fine nap of twelve hours,\" he said briskly, \"and I can  see that it has done you good. You look much better. Your color is good  and your eyes are bright. How do you feel?\"    \"I never felt better,\" I said, sitting up.    \"You remember your first waking, no doubt,\" he pursued, \"and your  surprise when I told you how long you had been asleep?\"    \"You said, I believe, that I had slept one hundred and thirteen years.\"    \"Exactly.\"    \"You will admit,\" I said, with an ironical smile, \"that the story was  rather an improbable one.\"    \"Extraordinary, I admit,\" he responded, \"but given the proper  conditions, not improbable nor inconsistent with what we know of the  trance state. When complete, as in your case, the vital functions are  absolutely suspended, and there is no waste of the tissues. No limit  can be set to the possible duration of a trance when the external  conditions protect the body from physical injury. This trance of yours  is indeed the longest of which there is any positive record, but there  is no known reason wherefore, had you not been discovered and had the  chamber in which we found you continued intact, you might not have  remained in a state of suspended animation till, at the end of  indefinite ages, the gradual refrigeration of the earth had destroyed  the bodily tissues and set the spirit free.\"    I had to admit that, if I were indeed the victim of a practical joke,  its authors had chosen an admirable agent for carrying out their  imposition. The impressive and even eloquent manner of this man would  have lent dignity to an argument that the moon was made of cheese. The  smile with which I had regarded him as he advanced his trance  hypothesis did not appear to confuse him in the slightest degree.    \"Perhaps,\" I said, \"you will go on and favor me with some particulars  as to the circumstances under which you discovered this chamber of  which you speak, and its contents. I enjoy good fiction.\"    \"In this case,\" was the grave reply, \"no fiction could be so strange as  the truth. You must know that these many years I have been cherishing  the idea of building a laboratory in the large garden beside this  house, for the purpose of chemical experiments for which I have a  taste. Last Thursday the excavation for the cellar was at last begun.  It was completed by that night, and Friday the masons were to have  come. Thursday night we had a tremendous deluge of rain, and Friday  morning I found my cellar a frog-pond and the walls quite washed down.  My daughter, who had come out to view the disaster with me,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/626"],[0,"The Love of Books: The Philobiblon of Richard de Bury (#4)"],[1,"beyond all riches, what man living  according to nature would not feel the desire of books?  And although  we know that swine trample pearls under foot, the wise man will not  therefore be deterred from gathering the pearls that lie before him.  A  library of wisdom, then, is more precious than all wealth, and all  things that are desirable cannot be compared to it.  Whoever therefore  claims to be zealous of truth, of happiness, of wisdom or knowledge,  aye, even of the faith, must needs become a lover of books.        CHAPTER III    WHAT WE ARE TO THINK OF THE PRICE IN THE BUYING OF BOOKS    From what has been said we draw this corollary welcome to us, but (as  we believe) acceptable to few: namely, that no dearness of price ought  to hinder a man from the buying of books, if he has the money that is  demanded for them, unless it be to withstand the malice of the seller  or to await a more favourable opportunity of buying.  For if it is  wisdom only that makes the price of books, which is an infinite  treasure to mankind, and if the value of books is unspeakable, as the  premises show, how shall the bargain be shown to be dear where an  infinite good is being bought? Wherefore, that books are to be gladly  bought and unwillingly sold, Solomon, the sun of men, exhorts us in the  Proverbs: Buy the truth, he says, and sell not wisdom.  But what we are  trying to show by rhetoric or logic, let us prove by examples from  history.  The arch-philosopher Aristotle, whom Averroes regards as the  law of Nature, bought a few books of Speusippus straightway after his  death for 72,000 sesterces.  Plato, before him in time, but after him  in learning, bought the book of Philolaus the Pythagorean, from which  he is said to have taken the Timaeus, for 10,000 denaries, as Aulus  Gellius relates in the Noctes Atticae. Now Aulus Gellius relates this  that the foolish may consider how wise men despise money in comparison  with books.  And on the other hand, that we may know that folly and  pride go together, let us here relate the folly of Tarquin the Proud in  despising books, as also related by Aulus Gellius.  An old woman,  utterly unknown, is said to have come to Tarquin the Proud, the seventh  king of Rome, offering to sell nine books, in which (as she declared)  sacred oracles were contained, but she asked an immense sum for them,  insomuch that the king said she was mad.  In anger she flung three  books into the fire, and still asked the same sum for the rest.  When  the king refused it, again she flung three others into the fire and  still asked the same price for the three that were left.  At last,  astonished beyond measure, Tarquin was glad to pay for three books the  same price for which he might have bought nine.  The old woman  straightway disappeared, and was never seen before or after.  These  were the Sibylline books, which the Romans consulted as a divine oracle  by some one of the Quindecemvirs, and this is believed to have been the  origin of the Quindecemvirate.  What did this Sibyl teach the proud  king by this bold deed, except that the vessels of wisdom, holy books,  exceed all human estimation; and, as Gregory says of the kingdom of  Heaven:  They are worth all that thou hast?        CHAPTER IV    THE COMPLAINT OF BOOKS AGAINST THE CLERGY ALREADY PROMOTED    A generation of vipers destroying their own parent and base offspring  of the ungrateful cuckoo, who when he has grown strong slays his nurse,  the giver of his strength, are degenerate clerks with regard to books.  Bring it again to mind and consider faithfully what ye receive through  books, and ye will find that books are as it were the creators of your  distinction, without which other favourers would have been wanting.    In sooth, while still untrained and helpless ye crept up to us, ye  spake as children, ye thought as children, ye cried as children and  begged to be made partakers of our milk.  But we being straightway  moved by your tears gave you the breast of grammar to suck, which ye  plied continually with teeth and tongue, until ye lost your native  barbarousness and learned to speak with our tongues the mighty things  of God.  And next we clad you with the goodly garments of philosophy,  rhetoric and dialectic, of which we had and have a store, while ye were  naked as a tablet to be painted on.  For all the household of  philosophy are clothed with garments, that the nakedness and rawness of  the intellect may be covered. After this, providing you with the  fourfold wings of the quadrivials that ye might be winged like the  seraphs and so mount above the cherubim, we sent you to a friend at  whose door, if only ye importunately knocked, ye might borrow the three  loaves of the Knowledge of the Trinity, in which consists the final  felicity of every sojourner below.  Nay, if ye deny that ye had these  privileges, we boldly declare that ye either lost them by your  carelessness, or that through your sloth ye spurned them when offered  to you. If these things seem but a light matter to you, we will add yet  greater things.  Ye are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy  race, ye are a peculiar people chosen into the lot of God, ye are  priests and ministers of God, nay, ye are called the very Church of  God, as though the laity were not to be called churchmen.  Ye, being  preferred to the laity, sing psalms and hymns in the chancel, and,  serving the altar and living by the altar, make the true body of  Christ, wherein God Himself has honoured you not only above the laity,  but even a little higher than the angels.  For to whom of His angels  has He said at any time:  Thou art a priest for ever after the order of  Melchisedech?  Ye dispense the patrimony of the crucified one to the  poor, wherein it is required of stewards that a man be found faithful.  Ye are shepherds of the Lord's flock, as well in example of life as in  the word of doctrine, which is bound to repay you with milk and wool.    Who are the givers of all these things, O clerks?  Is it not books?  Do  ye remember therefore, we pray, how many and how great liberties and  privileges are bestowed upon the clergy through us?  In truth, taught  by us who are the vessels of wisdom and intellect, ye ascend the  teacher's chair and are called of men Rabbi.  By us ye become  marvellous in the eyes of the laity, like great lights in the world,  and possess the dignities of the Church according to your various  stations.  By us, while ye still lack the first down upon your cheeks,  ye are established in your early years and bear the tonsure on your  heads, while the dread sentence of the Church is heard: Touch not mine  anointed and do my prophets no harm, and he who has rashly touched them  let him forthwith by his own blow be smitten violently with the wound  of an anathema.  At length yielding your lives to wickedness, reaching  the two paths of Pythagoras, ye choose the left branch, and going  backward ye let go the lot of God which ye had first assumed, becoming  companions of thieves.  And thus ever going from bad to worse, dyed  with theft and murder and manifold impurities, your fame and conscience  stained by sins, at the bidding of justice ye are confined in manacles  and fetters, and are kept to be punished by a most shameful death.  Then your friend is put far away, nor is there any to mourn your lot.  Peter swears that he knows not the man: the people cry to the judge:  Crucify, crucify Him!  If thou let this man go, thou act not Caesar's  friend.  Now all refuge has perished, for ye must stand before the  judgment-seat, and there is no appeal, but only hanging is in store for  you. While the wretched man's heart is thus filled with woe and only  the sorrowing Muses bedew their cheeks with tears, in his strait is  heard on every side the wailing appeal to us, and to avoid the danger  of impending death he shows the slight sign of the ancient tonsure  which we bestowed upon him, begging that we may be called to his aid  and bear witness to the privilege bestowed upon him.  Then straightway  touched with pity we run to meet the prodigal son and snatch the  fugitive slave from the gates of death.  The book he has not forgotten  is handed to him to be read, and while with lips stammering with fear  he reads a few words, the power of the judge is loosed, the accuser is  withdrawn, and death is put to flight.  O marvellous virtue of an  empiric verse!  O saving antidote of dreadful ruin!  O precious reading  of the psalter, which for this alone deserves to be called the book of  life! Let the laity undergo the judgment of the secular arm, that  either sewn up in sacks they may be carried out to Neptune, or planted  in the earth may fructify for Pluto, or may be offered amid the flames  as a fattened holocaust to Vulcan, or at least may be hung up as a  victim to Juno: while our nursling at a single reading of the book of  life is handed over to the custody of the Bishop, and rigour is changed  to favour, and the forum being transferred from the laity, death is  routed by the clerk who is the nursling of books.    But now let us speak of the clerks who are vessels of virtue.  Which of  you about to preach ascends the pulpit or the rostrum without in some  way consulting us?  Which of you enters the schools to teach or to  dispute without relying upon our support?  First of all, it behoves you  to eat the book with Ezechiel, that the belly of your memory may be  sweetened within, and thus as with the panther refreshed, to whose  breath all beasts and cattle long to approach, the sweet savour of the  spices it has eaten may shed a perfume without.  Thus our nature  secretly working in our own, listeners hasten up gladly, as the  load-stone draws the iron nothing loth.  What an infinite host of books  lie at Paris or Athens, and at the same time resound in Britain and in  Rome! In truth, while resting they yet move, and while retaining their  own places they are"]]]
