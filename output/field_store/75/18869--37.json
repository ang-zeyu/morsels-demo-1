The colts, he says,  run about with their dams on all expeditions, till weaned; for  that it is the custom of the Arabs to ride their mares, as  thinking them the fleetest, and not their horses; from whence we  may infer, that the mare colts are best fed and taken care of.  That if you ask one of these banditti to sell his mare, his answer  is, that on her speed depends his own head. He says also, the  stone colts are so little regarded, that it is difficult to find a  Horse of any tolerable size and shape amongst them.    If this then is the case, shall we be any longer at a loss to  account for the deformity of an animal, who, from his infancy, is  neglected, starved, and dried up, for want of juices? or shall we  wonder that his offspring, produced in a land of plenty, of whom  the greatest care is taken, who is defended from the extremity of  heat and cold, whose food is never limited, and whose vessels are  filled with the juices of the sweetest herbage, shall we wonder, I  say, that his offspring, so brought up, should acquire a more  perfect shape and size than his progenitor? or if the Sire is not  able to race, shall we wonder that the Son, whose shape is more  perfect, should excel his Sire in all performances?    But there is another reason why many of the very finest of these  foreign Horses cannot race: our observations of them will shew us,  that though their shoulders in general exceedingly incline  backwards, yet their fore-legs stand very much under them; but in  different Horses this position is more or less observable. This,  (when I considered the laws of nature) appeared to me the greatest  imperfection a Stallion could possibly have: but when this  gentleman informed me it was the custom of the Turks always to  keep each fore-leg of the Horse chained to the hinder one, of each  side, when not in action, I no longer considered it as a natural,  but an acquired imperfection. Shall we now wonder that such an  one, though ever so well made in other respects, cannot race in  spite of all his blood? But the custom of the Arabs in this  respect, he says, his memory does not extend to. I well remember  this to be the case of the Godolphin Arabian when I saw him, who  stood bent at knees, and with his fore-legs trembling under him:  such is the case of Mosco's grey Horse in some degree. In our  country we frequently see Horses stand pawing their litter under  them with their fore-feet; our custom to prevent it is to put  hobbles on their fore-legs, and this will produce the same  position in a greater or less degree, though not so conspicuous as  in some of those foreign Horses, who have been habituated from  their youth to this confined method of standing. His royal  highness the duke of Cumberland has a very remarkable instance of  this, in a Horse called Muley Ishmael, which is otherwise, the  most elegant Horse I ever yet beheld. Whether this position is  natural or acquired, will be best determined by his produce.  Suppose now this Horse should be tried, and found no racer, shall  he be condemned as a Stallion, and the fault imputed to his  blood; or on the other hand, if his colts are strait** upon their  legs, and found to be good racers, shall the perfection of such  colt be imputed to the blood of the father, when we can account  for speed in the one, and the want of it in the other, from the  different attitude of each Horse? We are further acquainted, that  the Horses we call Turks, are in reality Arabs; that the true  Turkish Horse, is a large, heavy, majestic animal, of no speed,  designed to ride on for state and grandeur; that it is the custom  of the bashaws in Arabia occasionally to choose, from their  provinces, such colts as they like, and send them to the grand  seignior's stables which they do at their own price, and which the  Arabs, who breed them, look upon as a very great hardship. These  colts are again picked and culled, after having been some time in  the grand seignior's stables, and the refuse disposed of at his  pleasure, so that the fine Horses found in the possession of the  Turks, are either some of these which are cast from the grand  seignior's stables, or which the Turks buy from the Arabs whilst  they are young.   And he farther acquaints us with the reason why  the Turks choose these Arabian Horses when young, because, if  continued long in the hands of the Arabs, they are small, stunted,  and deformed in shape; whereas, when brought into Turkey, a land  of greater plenty than the deserts of Arabia, they acquire a  greater perfection both of size and shape. Now, whether these  Turks and Arabs are of the same or different extraction, may  perhaps be very little to our purpose; but it is absurd to  suppose that providence has bestowed a virtue on a part only of  this species produced in any one country, (which species was  undoubtedly designed for the use of man) and that mankind should  not be able, in any age, to determine with precision this virtue,  or fix any criterion, whereby to judge with any certainty.    Seeing then, this is the case, how shall we account for the  various perfection and imperfection in the breed of these foreign  Horses; for we perceive it not determined to those of Turkey,  Barbary, or Arabia, but from each of these countries some good,  some bad Stallions are sent us? What shall we do? Shall we  continue to impute it to the good old phrase of blood, the  particular virtue of which, no man ever yet could ascertain, in  any one particular instance, since Horses were first created? or  shall we say that nature has given these foreign Horses a finer  texture, a finer attitude, and more power than any other Horses we  know of; and that these very Horses, and their descendants always  did, and always will surpass each other in speed and bottom,  according to their different degrees of power, shape, elegance,  and proportion? But there is also a certain length determined to  some particular parts of this animal, absolutely necessary to  velocity, of the particularity and propriety of which length, all  jockeys appear to be intirely** ignorant, from the latitude of  their expression, which is that a racer must have length  somewhere.    If I might now be allowed to give my opinion of this propriety of  length, I should say it consisted in the depth and declivity of  the shoulders, and in the length of the quarters and thighs, and  the insertion of the muscles thereof. The effect of the different  position or attitude of the shoulders in all Horses, is very  demonstrable: if we consider the motion of a shoulder, we shall  find it limited to a certain degree by the ligamentous and the  tendinous parts, which confine it to its proper sphere of acting;  so that if the shoulder stand upright, the Horse will not be able  to put his toes far before him, but will acquire only such a  particular degree of space at each step or movement; but if the  shoulders have a declivity in them, he cannot only put his toes  farther before him, but a greater purchase of ground will be  obtained at every stroke.    The certainty of this effect in the declivity of the shoulders  will be known by every man's observation; and it is also easily  demonstrated by the principles of mechanics, by which we learn,  that if a weight is applied to a pulley, in order to shut a door,  and that weight be allowed to fall immediately and perpendicularly  from the door, it will not pull it too with that velocity as it  will do if an angle be acquired, and the weight pass over a wheel  removed to a very little distance from the door.    Nevertheless, there is no general rule without exception, for we  now and then find a Horse to be a good racer, who has not this  declivity in his shoulders, but from a length in his thighs and  quarters has a sufficient share of speed. Add to this, there is  another advantage obtained to the Horse besides velocity by this  declivity of the shoulders, for his weight is removed farther  back, and placed more in the center of his body, by which an  equilibrium is acquired, and every muscle bears a more equal share  of weight and action; so that the nearer the articulation of the  quarters approach to the superior part of the shoulders, so much  the shorter will the back be, and as much more expanded as the  chest is, so much stronger will the animal be, and will also have  a larger space for the organs of respiration to exert themselves.    But I would not be understood to mean, that the shortness of the  back, or capacity of the chest, will constitute a racer; far from  it: but that in any given and proportioned length, from the bosom  of the Horse to the setting on of the dock, the nearer the  superior points of the shoulders approach to the quarters, so much  better able will the carcase be to sustain and bring through the  weight; and as much as the shoulders themselves prevail in depth,  and the quarters and thighs in length, so much greater will be the  velocity of the Horse, because a greater purchase of ground is  hereby obtained at every stroke.    It is by this property of length, strength of carcase, and the  power of the muscles, that foreign Horse excel all others, and it  is by the same advantages they excel each other also, and not by  any innate virtue, or principle of the mind, which must be  understood by the word blood, if any thing at all is intended to  be understood by it; and this is a truth every man would be  convinced of, if he would divest himself of partiality to  particular blood, and confide in his own observation of Horses and  their performances.    Sedbury was an instance of this great power, in whom we find all  the muscles rising very luxuriant, and with a remarkable  prominence. The famous Childers was a like instance of it. These  two Horses were remarkably good, but we have been absurd enough to  condemn the blood of both at various times; in one, because he had  bad feet, and"]]]
