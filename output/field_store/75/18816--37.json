[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47730"],[0,"Defense of the Faith and the Saints (Volume 1 of 2) (#4)"],[1," of the Jewish scripture  of which Christendom in the face of modern criticism--commonly called  the \"Higher Criticism\"--stands much in need. That criticism, as is  well known, is not directed so much to textual errors which may have  found their way into the great collection of sacred books, as it is to  utterly destroy the authorship and all idea of the divine inspiration  of them. This modern criticism has decided that Moses is not the  author of the Pentateuch, and indeed, the authorship not only of the  Pentateuch but of nearly all the prophets and even the books of the New  Testament is unsettled in the minds of many. The Book of Mormon gives  an account of a colony of Israelites that left Palestine six hundred  years before Christ, which colony carried with it a copy of the law of  Moses and the writings of the Prophets down to the days of Jeremiah.  These scriptures they preserved with great care, handing them down from  generation to generation, and from them both they and their descendants  learned of the hand dealings of God with his children in ancient times.  When the civilization of these people on the Western Hemisphere was  overthrown, and their records in order to preserve them were hidden by  righteous men, the truths which their fathers had learned from them  were preserved--though somewhat distorted--in their traditions. Thus is  accounted for the knowledge of the creation, the flood, the coming of  the Messiah, which Europeans found among the races inhabiting America  at the time of its discovery. Portions of the ancient Jewish Scriptures  which these colonists brought with them to America were transcribed  into the Book of Mormon, and there they stand in the translations  that have been made of it to testify not only to the existence of the  writings of Moses and the other prophets at least six hundred years  before Christ, but to testify also that the records which have come  down to us from the Jews are substantially correct. More important as  confirming the accuracy and inspiration of the Jewish Scriptures, more  potent to silence the new forms of unbelief which have arisen in modern  times, more powerful to confirm the faith of believers in God's word is  this new volume of scripture--the voice of nations of people who sought  and found God--than all the newly deciphered hieroglyphics of Egypt, or  the still more recent evidences that come from the ancient cities of  Assyria: and for this reason we make bold to invite the attention of  our Christian brethren to the consideration of this New Witness for God.    Besides preaching the Gospel for the salvation of men, \"Mormonism\" has  an especial mission, viz: to prepare the earth for the coming and reign  of Messiah. This mission authorizes the servants of God to warn mankind  of the judgments which shall precede that appearing, and to call upon  all men to repent of their sins, that they may escape the threatened  calamities. This preparatory work includes the gathering together of  the dispersed tribes of Israel and placing them in possession of the  lands which God, by covenant, gave to their fathers. It contemplates  the erection of a great city upon this continent of America to be  called \"Zion,\" the abode of the pure in heart, from whence the law of  God shall go forth to all the world. It contemplates the restoration of  the Jews to the city of their forefathers, the rebuilding of Jerusalem,  from whence shall go forth the word of the Lord.    Then shall the earth rest from its wickedness, as all the prophets have  predicted; then shall peace and truth and righteousness spread over  all the world, and all the tribes and kindreds of men shall know how  pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity.    Splendid as this consummation is, \"Mormonism,\" instructed by divine  wisdom, looks even beyond it, and contemplates the time when this earth  shall receive even a fuller redemption, and become a celestial sphere,  the abode of resurrected, celestial beings forever, who shall dwell  always in the presence of God.    In conclusion, let me say that \"Mormonism\" accepts and includes within  its boundary-lines all truth. It is progressive and is destined  to become the religion of the age. Within it is scope for all the  intelligence that shall flow unto it. \"Within its atmosphere is room  for every intellectual wing.\" It does not, as some have supposed,  thrive best where ignorance is most profound, nor does it depend  upon superstition and ignorance for its existence and perpetuity. It  possesses within itself principles of native strength that will enable  it to weather every storm, outlive all hatred born of ignorance and  prejudice; and it will yet prove itself to be what indeed it is, the  gospel of Jesus Christ, the power of God unto Salvation to all those  who believe and obey it, the Church of Jesus Christ.        II.    THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE CHURCH TO THE CHRISTIAN SECTS: THE DOCTRINE OF  TWO CHURCHES ONLY.    FOREWORD.    The following is an address delivered at the seventy-sixth Annual  Conference of the Church, held at Salt Lake City, in April, 1906. The  remarks consider two very important statements in our authoritative  books. The first one is found in the Pearl of Great Price, where the  prophet Joseph states what the answer to his question was, when asking  the Lord which of the sects was the true Church, and which he should  join. Of that incident he said:        \"I was answered that I must join none of them, for they were all      wrong; and the personage who addressed me said that all their      creeds were an abomination in his sight; that those professors were      all corrupt:\"    The second statement is in the Book of Mormon, where the declaration is  made that,        \"There are, save two churches only; the one is the church of the      Lamb of God, and the other is the church of the devil; wherefore,      whoso belongeth not to the church of the Lamb of God, belongeth to      that great church, which is the mother of abominations; and she is      the whore of all the earth.\"    The first of these statements, it is claimed, not only \"unchurches  all Christians,\" but proclaims the universal corruption of individual  Christians. The second statement is generally supposed to stigmatize  the Church of Rome as the church of the devil. Both these questions are  considered in the article which follows.    II.    THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE CHURCH TO THE CHRISTIAN SECTS: THE DOCTRINE OF  TWO CHURCHES ONLY.    Among the things important for the Saints of God to understand, among  the things important for the world to understand respecting the  Latter-day Saints, is the relationship that we sustain to the religious  world; and I do not know that there is anything to which I could devote  the few minutes at my disposal to better advantage than in pointing out  that relationship, if I can obtain, through your faith and mine, the  liberty that comes from the possession of the Spirit of the Lord.    The first revelation that the Lord gave to the Prophet Joseph Smith  had a bearing upon this subject. You remember that the Prophet went  to the Lord to ascertain which of all the sects of religion was his  church, desiring, of course, to unite himself with that church which  the Lord would designate as his. In reply to that question the Lord,  in substance, said that all the sects were wrong; that he did not  acknowledge them as his church; \"their creeds were an abomination in  his sight; those professors were all corrupt;\" [A] and the Prophet was  told that he must join none of them, but was promised that in due time  he would be used as God's instrument in the establishment of the Church  of Christ in the earth.    [Footnote A: The assertion, \"those professors were all corrupt,\" must  not be taken as referring to the whole body of Christians; but rather  as referring to the teachers of their creeds--the \"professors;\" that  term not being used in the sense of \"confessors\" of the creeds, who  merely accept their doctrine from the teachings of the \"professors.\"  This interpretation is justified from the immediate context of the  passage: \"They (the professors) draw near to me with their lips,  but their hearts are far from me; they (the \"professors\") teach for  doctrine the commandments of men.\" This context clearly proves that  the charge of \"corruption\" is limited at least to the teachers, to  the \"professors,\" not to the whole body of Christians. Moreover, I  am convinced myself that the declaration is still further limited  to the \"professors\" who founded and by that act taught to the world  the creeds that are an abomination in the sight of God--a fact not  at all difficult of belief, or proof, upon an analysis of the creeds  themselves. And those who originally could form such conceptions of  God and man and the purposes of human existence, as the creeds teach,  were certainly men of warped understandings, men of perverted or  corrupted minds. But as to the whole body of Christians, we know that  there were at the time of the opening of this new dispensation of the  Gospel, and now, many who were not only not corrupt, except for the  ordinary weaknesses or \"corruption\" of our human nature,--but virtuous,  hungering and thirsting after righteousness, seeking after God, and  hindered from finding him only by the abominable creeds formulated by  the \"professors\" of the passage here considered.]    Because of this great revelation, by which the errors of ages were  swept aside and the ground cleared for the re-establishment of the  Church of Christ among men, it has placed us, in a way, in an attitude  of antagonism to the religious world. We have been resisted to some  extent because of this attitude of antagonism; and it is quite possible  that we ourselves have not understood the true relationship in which  we stand to the religious world, by more or less of misapprehension  respecting this great revelation.

Even in times of  peace, most men live lives of monotonous labor, most women are  condemned to a drudgery which almost kills the possibility of  happiness before youth is past, most children are allowed to grow up  in ignorance of all that would enlarge their thoughts or stimulate  their imagination.  The few who are more fortunate are rendered  illiberal by their unjust privileges, and oppressive through fear of  the awakening indignation of the masses.  From the highest to the  lowest, almost all men are absorbed in the economic struggle: the  struggle to acquire what is their due or to retain what is not their  due.  Material possessions, in fact or in desire, dominate our  outlook, usually to the exclusion of all generous and creative  impulses.  Possessiveness--the passion to have and to hold--is the  ultimate source of war, and the foundation of all the ills from which  the political world is suffering.  Only by diminishing the strength of  this passion and its hold upon our daily lives can new institutions  bring permanent benefit to mankind.    Institutions which will diminish the sway of greed are possible, but  only through a complete reconstruction of our whole economic system.  Capitalism and the wage system must be abolished; they are twin  monsters which are eating up the life of the world.  In place of them  we need a system which will hold in cheek men's predatory impulses,  and will diminish the economic injustice that allows some to be rich  in idleness while others are poor in spite of unremitting labor; but  above all we need a system which will destroy the tyranny of the  employer, by making men at the same time secure against destitution  and able to find scope for individual initiative in the control of the  industry by which they live.  A better system can do all these things,  and can be established by the democracy whenever it grows weary of  enduring evils which there is no reason to endure.    We may distinguish four purposes at which an economic system may aim:  first, it may aim at the greatest possible production of goods and at  facilitating technical progress; second, it may aim at securing  distributive justice; third, it may aim at giving security against  destitution; and, fourth, it may aim at liberating creative impulses  and diminishing possessive impulses.    Of these four purposes the last is the most important.  Security is  chiefly important as a means to it.  State socialism, though it might  give material security and more justice than we have at present, would  probably fail to liberate creative impulses or produce a progressive  society.    Our present system fails in all four purposes.  It is chiefly defended  on the ground that it achieves the first of the four purposes, namely,  the greatest possible production of material goods, but it only does  this in a very short-sighted way, by methods which are wasteful in the  long run both of human material and of natural resources.    Capitalistic enterprise involves a ruthless belief in the importance  of increasing material production to the utmost possible extent now  and in the immediate future.  In obedience to this belief, new  portions of the earth's surface are continually brought under the sway  of industrialism.  Vast tracts of Africa become recruiting grounds for  the labor required in the gold and diamond mines of the Rand,  Rhodesia, and Kimberley; for this purpose, the population is  demoralized, taxed, driven into revolt, and exposed to the  contamination of European vice and disease.  Healthy and vigorous  races from Southern Europe are tempted to America, where sweating and  slum life reduce their vitality if they do not actually cause their  death.  What damage is done to our own urban populations by the  conditions under which they live, we all know.  And what is true of  the human riches of the world is no less true of the physical  resources.  The mines, forests, and wheat-fields of the world are all  being exploited at a rate which must practically exhaust them at no  distant date.  On the side of material production, the world is living  too fast; in a kind of delirium, almost all the energy of the world  has rushed into the immediate production of something, no matter what,  and no matter at what cost.  And yet our present system is defended on  the ground that it safeguards progress!    It cannot be said that our present economic system is any more  successful in regard to the other three objects which ought to be  aimed at.  Among the many obvious evils of capitalism and the wage  system, none are more glaring than that they encourage predatory  instincts, that they allow economic injustice, and that they give  great scope to the tyranny of the employer.    As to predatory instincts, we may say, broadly speaking, that in a  state of nature there would be two ways of acquiring riches--one by  production, the other by robbery.  Under our existing system, although  what is recognized as robbery is forbidden, there are nevertheless  many ways of becoming rich without contributing anything to the wealth  of the community.  Ownership of land or capital, whether acquired or  inherited, gives a legal right to a permanent income.  Although most  people have to produce in order to live, a privileged minority are  able to live in luxury without producing anything at all.  As these  are the men who are not only the most fortunate but also the most  respected, there is a general desire to enter their ranks, and a  widespread unwillingness to face the fact that there is no  justification whatever for incomes derived in this way.  And apart  from the passive enjoyment of rent or interest, the methods of  acquiring wealth are very largely predatory.  It is not, as a rule, by  means of useful inventions, or of any other action which increases the  general wealth of the community, that men amass fortunes; it is much  more often by skill in exploiting or circumventing others.  Nor is it  only among the rich that our present regime promotes a narrowly  acquisitive spirit.  The constant risk of destitution compels most men  to fill a great part of their time and thought with the economic  struggle.  There is a theory that this increases the total output of  wealth by the community.  But for reasons to which I shall return  later, I believe this theory to be wholly mistaken.    Economic injustice is perhaps the most obvious evil of our present  system.  It would be utterly absurd to maintain that the men who  inherit great wealth deserve better of the community than those who  have to work for their living.  I am not prepared to maintain that  economic justice requires an exactly equal income for everybody.  Some  kinds of work require a larger income for efficiency than others do;  but there is economic injustice as soon as a man has more than his  share, unless it is because his efficiency in his work requires it, or  as a reward for some definite service.  But this point is so obvious  that it needs no elaboration.    The modern growth of monopolies in the shape of trusts, cartels,  federations of employers and so on has greatly increased the power of  the capitalist to levy toll on the community.  This tendency will not  cease of itself, but only through definite action on the part of those  who do not profit by the capitalist regime.  Unfortunately the  distinction between the proletariat and the capitalist is not so sharp  as it was in the minds of socialist theorizers.  Trade-unions have  funds in various securities; friendly societies are large capitalists;  and many individuals eke out their wages by invested savings.  All  this increases the difficulty of any clear-cut radical change in our  economic system.  But it does not diminish the desirability of such a  change.    Such a system as that suggested by the French syndicalists, in which  each trade would be self-governing and completely independent, without  the control of any central authority, would not secure economic  justice.  Some trades are in a much stronger bargaining position than  others.  Coal and transport, for example, could paralyze the national  life, and could levy blackmail by threatening to do so.  On the other  hand, such people as school teachers, for example, could rouse very  little terror by the threat of a strike and would be in a very weak  bargaining position.  Justice can never be secured by any system of  unrestrained force exercised by interested parties in their own  interests.  For this reason the abolition of the state, which the  syndicalists seem to desire, would be a measure not compatible with  economic justice.    The tyranny of the employer, which at present robs the greater part of  most men's lives of all liberty and all initiative, is unavoidable so  long as the employer retains the right of dismissal with consequent  loss of pay.  This right is supposed to be essential in order that men  may have an incentive to work thoroughly.  But as men grow more  civilized, incentives based on hope become increasingly preferable to  those that are based on fear.  It would be far better that men should  be rewarded for working well than that they should be punished for  working badly.  This system is already in operation in the civil  service, where a man is only dismissed for some exceptional degree of  vice or virtue, such as murder or illegal abstention from it.  Sufficient pay to ensure a livelihood ought to be given to every  person who is willing to work, independently of the question whether  the particular work at which he is skilled is wanted at the moment or  not.  If it is not wanted, some new trade which is wanted ought to be  taught at the public expense.  Why, for example, should a hansom-cab  driver be allowed to suffer on account of the introduction of taxies?  He has not committed any crime, and the fact that his work is no  longer wanted is due to causes entirely outside his control."]]]
