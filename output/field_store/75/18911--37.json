But  everyone has something to make him happy, and, unless there is famine  or pestilence, these people have their wives and children and home,  just as people have in England and other countries.  The only person  who need be unhappy is the one who has no one to love.    So we have learnt a little about that part of Africa called Egypt--the  land of the Nile--and about the people who live in it.  We must  remember that all the other people who live on the North Coast of  Africa, in Tunis, Algeria, and Morocco, are something like the  Egyptians, also speaking Arabic, and different from the dark-skinned  people who live farther south where it is very hot.                                     III                               -----------                    THE SAHARA, THE GREAT SANDY DESERT                          1. What the Desert is Like    In the last chapter we were reading about Egypt, and we said that on  the West of Egypt lay the Great Desert.  Now a desert is a place where  for some reason no food will grow.  In some deserts the soil is too  bad; in some the ground is covered with salt; in others, like the  Sahara, there are no rivers.  In some places in the Sahara there is  water coming up through a crack in the rocks.  This water is called a  \"spring,\" and wherever one is found, trees and grass and food will  grow.  Such a place is called an \"oasis.\" In the big oases there are  villages and towns.  But the sun is so hot that before the water from  the spring has flowed very far it is dried up, and beyond that nothing  will grow.  So when we think of the Sahara we have to try and picture  to ourselves a very big country, full of hills and valleys, but with  no rivers or lakes.  It is a journey of many months to cross the  Sahara, and day after day there is nothing to see but sand--sand, not  flat, but in ridges of hills like great waves of the sea.  When people  are travelling across this desert, they get very tired of looking at  nothing but sand all day.  Then, at last, as the sun sets, they reach  an oasis where there is water and bananas and date-trees, and perhaps  houses and people.  Sometimes great winds blow in the desert and bring  a sandstorm.  Then the sand beats hard against everything.  If  travellers meet a sandstorm, they have to throw themselves face  downwards on the ground to keep the sand out of their eyes and mouth.  Very often people who live in the desert have bad eyes, and many are  blind because of the sandstorms.                            2. How the Desert Came    Long, long ago, the Sahara was not quite so dry as it is now.  There  were rivers then, which have dried up since.  When there was water,  food would grow, and people could keep sheep and cattle.  In those  days there were several large cities there.  But when the water began  to dry up, the ground became sandy and nothing would grow.  Then,  whenever the wind blew, the sand was carried along and began to cover  up the houses and temples.  The people had moved away because their  food would not grow, and soon the sand completely covered the old  cities.  For a long time they were buried, until some Europeans went  to see what they could find out about the people who lived there long  ago.  Then they dug and dug in the sand, and found the old houses and  temples.  But digging in the desert is very hard work, because it is  very hot, and there is very little water and food.  Often, too, a  great wind arises and brings a sandstorm.  Then the sand drifts back  again to the places already cleared.                     3. The Desert Peoples (_a_) Berbers    It is surprising to find that there are a great many people living in  this desert region of North Africa.  There are three kinds of people  there.  Firstly, there are the Berbers, who live always in a little  town or village on a big oasis, and grow their own food.  Secondly,  there are the Bedouin, who live in large wandering tribes.  These keep  sheep and goats and camels, and stay on a small oasis until their  herds have eaten all the grass on it, and then move on to another  place.  Thirdly, there are the Arab traders, whose business is to go  south of the desert to get ivory and gold, and to take these back to  Egypt and to the great cities north of the desert to sell.  All these  people speak Arabic and are Mohammedans.    The Berbers who live in the towns on the great oasis, where there is a  large spring of water, are a different race from the Arabs, the  Egyptians, or the dark-skinned people of farther south.  They are much  darker-skinned than the Egyptians and the Bedouin.  In the past many  different races of South Europe, as well as the Arabs, have conquered  them and intermarried with them, but they still remain a distinct  race, though their customs are like those of other Moslems.  They make  their houses of bricks dried in the sun, and build them so close  together that people can step from one roof to another across the  street.  The roofs are flat, so that they can sit or sleep on them at  night when it is very hot inside the house.  All round the outside of  the towns are brick walls with gates that are shut at night for fear  of robbers.    These people live very much like the town-people in Egypt, only they  are much poorer.  They can buy things from the traders in the caravans  which stop at their village for the night, but as they cannot grow or  make many things to give in exchange, most people have to be content  with the earthenware cooking-pots and the cloth they can make  themselves.  The women draw water and prepare the food and look after  the children.  Then they weave flax and wool into cloth.  Their dress  is something like that of the poor Egyptians.  The children have to  herd the sheep and goats, which at night sleep in the house with their  owners.  The men hoe the gardens and grow the millet and barley for  food, and the flax for cloth.  The chief food of these people is bread  made of millet-flour kneaded with milk and baked in a hole in the  ground.  The flour is ground between two stones placed one on the top  of the other, the upper one having one or two handles by which it can  be moved round.  The people in these small, crowded towns in the  middle of the desert must live very narrow lives, and they do not know  much about anything outside their own village.  Journeys in the desert  are very dangerous because of sandstorms and the difficulty of finding  the way where there are no roads, and more especially because of  robbers.  So people never go on journeys unless they can join a big  company with plenty of men ready to fight if the robbers attack them.                     4. The Desert Peoples (_b_) Bedouin    The second kind of people who have their home in the desert are the  Bedouin.  These are Arabs who once lived in another desert in Arabia,  but long, long ago many of them came to live in the Sahara.  The  Bedouin live in tents made of poles with dark cloth of goats' hair or  camels' hair spread across them for walls and roof.  They travel in  large tribes, and put up their tents on a small oasis where there is  no town.  These people still live as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob lived  long ago, before the Israelites built their towns.  On the oasis their  camels, horses, sheep, and goats can find water to drink and grass to  eat.  When all the food has been eaten they pack up the tents and  everything they have and put it on the backs of the animals.  Then the  men and women and children all mount camels and horses and donkeys,  and the whole tribe moves to another oasis.  These people drink  camels' milk and eat the dates and bananas and other fruit they find  where they pitch their tents.  They also bring these fruits to the  Berber towns, and exchange them for flour to make bread and for coffee  to drink.  Coffee is a berry which is first roasted, then, when water  is boiled and poured on to it, it makes a strong, brown liquid which  Arabs and Europeans like to drink.  The women weave camels' hair into  clothes and blankets, and goats' hair into tent-covers.  The Bedouin  men are always ready to fight with their guns and lances; sometimes  they are robbers, but most of them travel from place to place, only  fighting if others attack them.  There is always a chief in each tribe  of Bedouin, and in each village of the Berbers, but away in the desert  there are many bands of robbers who will not obey any law, and  everyone has to fight for himself against these people.  The Bedouin  love their animals, especially their camels and their horses.  It is  quite natural that they should do so, because often a man would die in  the desert if his horse or camel would not work well and carry him  faithfully until they reached water.  Sometimes when the people lose  their way in the pathless sand, the horses and camels can find it.                     5. The Desert Peoples (_c_) Traders    The third kind of people who are found in the Sahara are the traders.  These, like the Bedouin, are Arabs, but often their homes are in some  town, either on the edge of the desert or in Egypt.  They travel from  the great North African towns and from Egypt, across the desert to the  rich countries south of it, where the dark-skinned people live.  There, south of the Sahara, they buy ivory and dyed goat-skins and  other things in exchange for cloth and beads, and return with their  merchandise to the northern towns again.  Many years ago they used to  capture slaves, but they cannot often do so now, because the Christian  Europeans try to stop trading in slaves.  The journeys of the traders  take many months, because often they have to go by a long road in  order to find water.  So they travel from oasis to oasis seeking shade  and water.  Sometimes they have to ride three or four days to reach  the next drinking-place.  Then they have to carry water for themselves  in goat-skins."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6702"],[0,"Life of Harriet Beecher Stowe (#4)"],[1,"e. It was a happy hour when he brought home and set up in his  bookcase Cotton Mather's 'Magnalia,' in a new edition of two volumes.  What wonderful stories those! Stories too about my own country. Stories  that made me feel the very ground I trod on to be consecrated by some  special dealing of God's Providence.\"    In continuing these reminiscences Mrs. Stowe describes as follows her  sensations upon first hearing the Declaration of Independence: \"I  had never heard it before, and even now had but a vague idea of what  was meant by some parts of it. Still I gathered enough from the recital  of the abuses and injuries that had driven my nation to this course to  feel myself swelling with indignation, and ready with all my little  mind and strength to applaud the concluding passage, which Colonel  Talmadge rendered with resounding majesty. I was as ready as any of  them to pledge my life, fortune, and sacred honor for such a cause.  The heroic element was strong in me, having come down by ordinary  generation from a long line of Puritan ancestry, and just now it made  me long to do something, I knew not what: to fight for my country, or  to make some declaration on my own account.\"    When Harriet was nearly six years old her father married as his second  wife Miss Harriet Porter of Portland, Maine, and Mrs. Stowe thus  describes her new mother: \"I slept in the nursery with my two younger  brothers. We knew that father was gone away somewhere on a journey  and was expected home, therefore the sound of a bustle in the house  the more easily awoke us. As father came into our room our new mother  followed him. She was very fair, with bright blue eyes, and soft auburn  hair bound round with a black velvet bandeau, and to us she seemed very  beautiful.    \"Never did stepmother make a prettier or sweeter impression. The  morning following her arrival we looked at her with awe. She seemed to  us so fair, so delicate, so elegant, that we were almost afraid to go  near her. We must have appeared to her as rough, red-faced, country  children, honest, obedient, and bashful. She was peculiarly dainty  and neat in all her ways and arrangements, and I used to feel breezy,  rough, and rude in her presence.    \"In her religion she was distinguished for a most unfaltering  Christ-worship. She was of a type noble but severe, naturally hard,  correct, exact and exacting, with intense natural and moral ideality.  Had it not been that Doctor Payson had set up and kept before her a  tender, human, loving Christ, she would have been only a conscientious  bigot. This image, however, gave softness and warmth to her religious  life, and I have since noticed how her Christ-enthusiasm has sprung up  in the hearts of all her children.\"    In writing to her old home of her first impressions of her new one,  Mrs. Beecher says: \"It is a very lovely family, and with heartfelt  gratitude I observed how cheerful and healthy they were. The sentiment  is greatly increased, since I perceive them to be of agreeable habits  and some of them of uncommon intellect.\"    This new mother proved to be indeed all that the name implies to her  husband's children, and never did they have occasion to call her aught  other than blessed.    Another year finds a new baby brother, Frederick by name, added to  the family. At this time too we catch a characteristic glimpse of  Harriet in one of her sister Catherine's letters. She says: \"Last week  we interred Tom junior with funeral honors by the side of old Tom of  happy memory. Our Harriet is chief mourner always at their funerals.  She asked for what she called an _epithet_ for the gravestone of Tom  junior, which I gave as follows:--        \"Here lies our Kit,       Who had a fit,         And acted queer,       Shot with a gun,       Her race is run,         And she lies here.\"    In June, 1820, little Frederick died from scarlet fever, and Harriet  was seized with a violent attack of the same dread disease; but, after  a severe struggle, recovered.    Following her happy, hearty child-life, we find her tramping through  the woods or going on fishing excursions with her brothers, sitting  thoughtfully in her father's study, listening eagerly to the animated  theological discussions of the day, visiting her grandmother at Nut  Plains, and figuring as one of the brightest scholars in the Litchfield  Academy, taught by Mr. John Brace and Miss Pierce. When she was eleven  years old her brother Edward wrote of her: \"Harriet reads everything  she can lay hands on, and sews and knits diligently.\"    At this time she was no longer the youngest girl of the family, for  another sister (Isabella) had been born in 1822. This event served  greatly to mature her, as she was intrusted with much of the care of  the baby out of school hours. It was not, however, allowed to interfere  in any way with her studies, and, under the skillful direction of her  beloved teachers, she seemed to absorb knowledge with every sense.  She herself writes: \"Much of the training and inspiration of my early  days consisted not in the things that I was supposed to be studying,  but in hearing, while seated unnoticed at my desk, the conversation  of Mr. Brace with the older classes. There, from hour to hour, I  listened with eager ears to historical criticisms and discussions,  or to recitations in such works as Paley's Moral Philosophy, Blair's  Rhetoric, Allison on Taste, all full of most awakening suggestions to  my thoughts.    \"Mr. Brace exceeded all teachers I ever knew in the faculty of teaching  composition. The constant excitement in which he kept the minds of his  pupils, the wide and varied regions of thought into which he led them,  formed a preparation for composition, the main requisite for which is  to have something which one feels interested to say.\"    In her tenth year Harriet began what to her was the fascinating work  of writing compositions, and so rapidly did she progress that at the  school exhibition held when she was twelve years old, hers was one of  the two or three essays selected to be read aloud before the august  assembly of visitors attracted by the occasion.    Of this event Mrs. Stowe writes: \"I remember well the scene at that  exhibition, to me so eventful. The hall was crowded with all the  literati of Litchfield. Before them all our compositions were read  aloud. When mine was read I noticed that father, who was sitting on  high by Mr. Brace, brightened and looked interested, and at the close  I heard him ask, 'Who wrote that composition?' 'Your daughter, sir,'  was the answer. It was the proudest moment of my life. There was no  mistaking father's face when he was pleased, and to have interested him  was past all juvenile triumphs.\"    That composition has been carefully preserved, and on the old yellow  sheets the cramped childish handwriting is still distinctly legible.  As the first literary production of one who afterwards attained such  distinction as a writer, it is deemed of sufficient value and interest  to be embodied in this biography exactly as it was written and read  sixty-five years ago. The subject was certainly a grave one to be  handled by a child of twelve.      CAN THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL BE PROVED BY THE LIGHT OF NATURE?        It has justly been concluded by the philosophers      of every age that \"The proper study of mankind is      man,\" and his nature and composition, both physical      and mental, have been subjects of the most critical      examination. In the course of these researches many      have been at a loss to account for the change which      takes place in the body at the time of death. By some      it has been attributed to the flight of its tenant, and      by others to its final annihilation.        The questions, \"What becomes of the soul at the time      of death?\" and, if it be not annihilated, \"What is      its destiny after death?\" are those which, from the      interest that we all feel in them, will probably      engross universal attention.        In pursuing these inquiries it will be necessary to      divest ourselves of all that knowledge which we have      obtained from the light which revelation has shed over      them, and place ourselves in the same position as the      philosophers of past ages when considering the same      subject.        The first argument which has been advanced to prove      the immortality of the soul is drawn from the nature      of the mind itself. It has (say the supporters of      this theory) no composition of parts, and therefore,      as there are no particles, is not susceptible of      divisibility and cannot be acted upon by decay, and      therefore if it will not decay it will exist forever.        Now because the mind is not susceptible of decay      effected in the ordinary way by a gradual separation of      particles, affords no proof that that same omnipotent      power which created it cannot by another simple      exertion of power again reduce it to nothing. The only      reason for belief which this argument affords is that      the soul cannot be acted upon by decay. But it does not      prove that it cannot destroy its existence. Therefore,      for the validity of this argument, it must either be      proved that the \"Creator\" has not the power to destroy      it, or that he has not the will; but as neither of      these can be established, our immortality is left      dependent on the pleasure of the Creator. But it is      said that it is evident that the Creator designed the      soul for immortality, or he would never have created it      so essentially different from the body, for had they      both been designed for the same end they would both      have been created alike, as there would have been no      object in forming them otherwise. This only proves that      the soul and body had not the same destinations. Now      of what these destinations are we know nothing, and      after much useless "]]]
