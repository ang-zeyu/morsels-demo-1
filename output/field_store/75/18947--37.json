And he had forbidden all sorts of games,  because he said they were a waste of time.    So that now, though he wanted dreadfully to forbid something else, he  could not think of anything.    Then he had an idea, and this was it:    He told his servants to cut a long pole. And they cut a very long pole.  Then he said to them, \"Go into the hall and bring me one of my hats.  Not my best hat, which I wear on Sundays and on State occasions; nor  yet my second-best, which I wear every day; nor yet, again, the one I  wear when I am out hunting, for all these I need. Fetch me, rather, the  oldest of my hats.\" And they fetched him the very oldest of his hats.  Then he said, \"Put it on top of the pole.\" And they put it right on top  of the pole. And, last of all, he said, \"Go and set up the pole in the  middle of the meadow just outside the gates of the town.\" And they went  and set up the pole in the very middle of the meadow just outside the  gates of the town.    Then he sent his heralds out to north and south and east and west to  summon the people together, because he said he had something very  important and special to say to them. And the people came in tens, and  fifties, and hundreds, men, women, and children; and they stood waiting  in front of the Palace steps till Gessler the Governor should come out  and say something very important and special to them.    And punctually at eleven o'clock, Gessler, having finished a capital  breakfast, came out on to the top step and spoke to them.    \"Ladies and gentlemen,\"--he began. (A voice from the crowd: \"Speak  up!\")    \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he began again, in a louder voice, \"if I could  catch the man who said 'Speak up!' I would have him bitten in the neck  by wild elephants. (Applause.) I have called you to this place to-day  to explain to you my reason for putting up a pole, on the top of which  is one of my caps, in the meadow just outside the city gates. It is  this: You all, I know, respect and love me.\" Here he paused for the  audience to cheer, but as they remained quite silent he went on: \"You  would all, I know, like to come to my Palace every day and do reverence  to me. (A voice: 'No, no!') If I could catch the man who said 'No, no!'  I would have him stung on the soles of the feet by pink scorpions; and  if he was the same man who said 'Speak up!' a little while ago, the  number of scorpions should be doubled. (Loud applause.) As I was saying  before I was interrupted, I know you would like to come to my Palace  and do reverence to me there. But, as you are many and space is  limited, I am obliged to refuse you that pleasure. However, being  anxious not to disappoint you, I have set up my cap in the meadow, and  you may do reverence to _that_. In fact, you _must_. Everybody is  to look on that cap as if it were me. (A voice: 'It ain't so ugly as  you!') If I could catch the man who made that remark I would have him  tied up and teased by trained bluebottles. (Deafening applause.) In  fact, to put the matter briefly, if anybody crosses that meadow without  bowing down before that cap, my soldiers will arrest him, and I will  have him pecked on the nose by infuriated blackbirds. So there!  Soldiers, move that crowd on!\"    And Gessler disappeared indoors again, just as a volley of eggs and  cabbages whistled through the air. And the soldiers began to hustle the  crowd down the various streets till the open space in front of the  Palace gates was quite cleared of them. All this happened the day  before Tell and Walter set out for the town.          CHAPTER VII      Having set up the pole and cap in the meadow, Gessler sent two of his  bodyguard, Friesshardt (I should think you would be safe in pronouncing  this Freeze-hard, but you had better ask somebody who knows) and  Leuthold, to keep watch there all day, and see that nobody passed by  without kneeling down before the pole and taking off his hat to it.    But the people, who prided themselves on being what they called  _ueppen zie schnuffen_, or, as we should say, \"up to snuff,\" and  equal to every occasion, had already seen a way out of the difficulty.  They knew that if they crossed the meadow they must bow down before the  pole, which they did not want to do, so it occurred to them that an  ingenious way of preventing this would be not to cross the meadow. So  they went the long way round, and the two soldiers spent a lonely day.    \"What I sez,\" said Friesshardt, \"is, wot's the use of us wasting our  time here?\" (Friesshardt was not a very well-educated man, and he did  not speak good grammar.) \"None of these here people ain't a-going to  bow down to that there hat. Of course they ain't. Why, I can remember  the time when this meadow was like a fair--everybody a-shoving and  a-jostling one another for elbow-room; and look at it now! It's a desert.  That's what it is, a desert. What's the good of us wasting of our time  here, I sez. That's what I sez.    \"And they're artful, too, mind yer,\" he continued. \"Why, only this  morning, I sez to myself, 'Friesshardt,' I sez, 'you just wait till  twelve o'clock,' I sez, ''cos that's when they leave the council-house,  and then they'll _have_ to cross the meadow. And then we'll see  what we _shall_ see,' I sez. Like that, I sez. Bitter-like, yer  know. 'We'll see,' I sez, 'what we _shall_ see.' So I waited, and  at twelve o'clock out they came, dozens of them, and began to cross the  meadow. 'And now,' sez I to myself, 'look out for larks.' But what  happened? Why, when they came to the pole, the priest stood in front of  it, and the sacristan rang the bell, and they all fell down on their  knees. But they were saying their prayers, not doing obeisance to the  hat. That's what _they_ were doing. Artful--that's what _they_ are!\"    And Friesshardt kicked the foot of the pole viciously with his iron  boot.    \"It's my belief,\" said Leuthold (Leuthold is the thin soldier you see  in the picture)--\"it's my firm belief that they are laughing at us.  There! Listen to that!\"    A voice made itself heard from behind a rock not far off.    \"Where did you get that hat?\" said the voice.    \"There!\" grumbled Leuthold; \"they're always at it. Last time it was,  'Who's your hatter?' Why, we're the laughing-stock of the place. We're  like two rogues in a pillory. 'Tis rank disgrace for one who wears a  sword to stand as sentry o'er an empty hat. To make obeisance to a hat!  I' faith, such a command is downright foolery!\"    \"Well,\" said Friesshardt, \"and why not bow before an empty hat? Thou  hast oft bow'd before an empty skull. Ha, ha! I was always one for a  joke, yer know.\"    \"Here come some people,\" said Leuthold. \"At last! And they're only the  rabble, after all. You don't catch any of the better sort of people  coming here.\"    A crowd was beginning to collect on the edge of the meadow. Its numbers  swelled every minute, until quite a hundred of the commoner sort must  have been gathered together. They stood pointing at the pole and  talking among themselves, but nobody made any movement to cross the  meadow.    At last somebody shouted \"Yah!\"    The soldiers took no notice.    Somebody else cried \"Booh!\"'    \"Pass along there, pass along!\" said the soldiers.    Cries of \"Where did you get that hat?\" began to come from the body of  the crowd. When the Swiss invented a catch-phrase they did not drop it  in a hurry.    \"Where--did--you--get--that--HAT?\" they shouted.    Friesshardt and Leuthold stood like two statues in armour, paying no  attention to the remarks of the rabble. This annoyed the rabble. They  began to be more personal.    \"You in the second-hand lobster-tin,\" shouted one--he meant  Friesshardt, whose suit of armour, though no longer new, hardly  deserved this description--\"who's your hatter?\"    \"Can't yer see,\" shouted a friend, when Friesshardt made no reply, \"the  pore thing ain't alive? 'E's stuffed!\"    Roars of laughter greeted this sally. Friesshardt, in spite of the fact  that he enjoyed a joke, turned pink.    \"'E's blushing!\" shrieked a voice.    Friesshardt turned purple.    Then things got still more exciting.    \"'Ere,\" said a rough voice in the crowd impatiently, \"wot's the good of  _torkin'_ to 'em? Gimme that 'ere egg, missus!\"    And in another instant an egg flew across the meadow, and burst over  Leuthold's shoulder. The crowd howled with delight. This was something  _like_ fun, thought they, and the next moment eggs, cabbages,  cats, and missiles of every sort darkened the air. The two soldiers  raved and shouted, but did not dare to leave their post. At last, just  as the storm was at its height, it ceased, as if by magic. Everyone in  the crowd turned round, and, as he turned, jumped into the air and  waved his hat.    [Illustration: PLATE III]    A deafening cheer went up.    \"Hurrah!\" cried the mob; \"here comes good old Tell! _Now_ there's  going to be a jolly row!\"          CHAPTER VIII      Tell came striding along, Walter by his side, and his cross-bow over  his shoulder. He knew nothing about the hat having been placed on the  pole, and he was surprised to see such a large crowd gathered in the  meadow. He bowed to the crowd in his polite way, and the crowd gave  three cheers and one more, and he bowed again.    \"Hullo!\" said Walter suddenly; \"look at that hat up there, father. On  the pole.\"    \"What is the hat to us?\" said Tell; and he began to walk across the  meadow with an air of great dignity, and Walter walked by his side,  trying to look just like him.    \"Here! hi!\" shouted the soldiers. \"Stop! You haven't bowed down to the  cap.\"    [Illustration: PLATE IV]    Tell looked scornful, but said nothing. Walter looked still more  scornful.    \"Ho, there!\" shouted Friesshardt, standing in front of him. \"I bid you  stand in the Emperor's name.\"    \"My"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/73"],[0,"The Red Badge of Courage: An Episode of the American Civil War (#4)"],[1,"rank to rank.  The company wags all made their best endeavors.  The regiment tramped  to the tune of laughter.    The blatant soldier often convulsed whole files by his biting sarcasms  aimed at the tall one.    And it was not long before all the men seemed to forget their mission.  Whole brigades grinned in unison, and regiments laughed.    A rather fat soldier attempted to pilfer a horse from a dooryard.  He  planned to load his knapsack upon it.  He was escaping with his prize  when a young girl rushed from the house and grabbed the animal's mane.  There followed a wrangle.  The young girl, with pink cheeks and shining  eyes, stood like a dauntless statue.    The observant regiment, standing at rest in the roadway, whooped at  once, and entered whole-souled upon the side of the maiden.  The men  became so engrossed in this affair that they entirely ceased to  remember their own large war.  They jeered the piratical private, and  called attention to various defects in his personal appearance; and  they were wildly enthusiastic in support of the young girl.    To her, from some distance, came bold advice.  \"Hit him with a stick.\"    There were crows and catcalls showered upon him when he retreated  without the horse.  The regiment rejoiced at his downfall.  Loud and  vociferous congratulations were showered upon the maiden, who stood  panting and regarding the troops with defiance.    At nightfall the column broke into regimental pieces, and the fragments  went into the fields to camp.  Tents sprang up like strange plants.  Camp fires, like red, peculiar blossoms, dotted the night.    The youth kept from intercourse with his companions as much as  circumstances would allow him.  In the evening he wandered a few paces  into the gloom.  From this little distance the many fires, with the  black forms of men passing to and fro before the crimson rays, made  weird and satanic effects.    He lay down in the grass.  The blades pressed tenderly against his  cheek.  The moon had been lighted and was hung in a treetop.  The  liquid stillness of the night enveloping him made him feel vast pity  for himself.  There was a caress in the soft winds; and the whole mood  of the darkness, he thought, was one of sympathy for himself in his  distress.    He wished, without reserve, that he was at home again making the  endless rounds from the house to the barn, from the barn to the fields,  from the fields to the barn, from the barn to the house.  He remembered  he had so often cursed the brindle cow and her mates, and had sometimes  flung milking stools.  But, from his present point of view, there was a  halo of happiness about each of their heads, and he would have  sacrificed all the brass buttons on the continent to have been enabled  to return to them.  He told himself that he was not formed for a  soldier.  And he mused seriously upon the radical differences between  himself and those men who were dodging implike around the fires.    As he mused thus he heard the rustle of grass, and, upon turning his  head, discovered the loud soldier.  He called out, \"Oh, Wilson!\"    The latter approached and looked down.  \"Why, hello, Henry; is it you?  What are you doing here?\"    \"Oh, thinking,\" said the youth.    The other sat down and carefully lighted his pipe.  \"You're getting  blue my boy.  You're looking thundering peek-ed.  What the dickens is  wrong with you?\"    \"Oh, nothing,\" said the youth.    The loud soldier launched then into the subject of the anticipated  fight.  \"Oh, we've got 'em now!\"  As he spoke his boyish face was  wreathed in a gleeful smile, and his voice had an exultant ring.  \"We've got 'em now.  At last, by the eternal thunders, we'll lick 'em  good!\"    \"If the truth was known,\" he added, more soberly, \"they've licked _us_  about every clip up to now; but this time--this time--we'll lick 'em  good!\"    \"I thought you was objecting to this march a little while ago,\" said  the youth coldly.    \"Oh, it wasn't that,\" explained the other.  \"I don't mind marching, if  there's going to be fighting at the end of it.  What I hate is this  getting moved here and moved there, with no good coming of it, as far  as I can see, excepting sore feet and damned short rations.\"    \"Well, Jim Conklin says we'll get plenty of fighting this time.\"    \"He's right for once, I guess, though I can't see how it come.  This  time we're in for a big battle, and we've got the best end of it,  certain sure.  Gee rod! how we will thump 'em!\"    He arose and began to pace to and fro excitedly.  The thrill of his  enthusiasm made him walk with an elastic step.  He was sprightly,  vigorous, fiery in his belief in success.  He looked into the future  with clear proud eye, and he swore with the air of an old soldier.    The youth watched him for a moment in silence.  When he finally spoke  his voice was as bitter as dregs.  \"Oh, you're going to do great  things, I s'pose!\"    The loud soldier blew a thoughtful cloud of smoke from his pipe.  \"Oh,  I don't know,\" he remarked with dignity; \"I don't know.  I s'pose I'll  do as well as the rest.  I'm going to try like thunder.\"  He evidently  complimented himself upon the modesty of this statement.    \"How do you know you won't run when the time comes?\" asked the youth.    \"Run?\" said the loud one; \"run?--of course not!\"  He laughed.    \"Well,\" continued the youth, \"lots of good-a-'nough men have thought  they was going to do great things before the fight, but when the time  come they skedaddled.\"    \"Oh, that's all true, I s'pose,\" replied the other; \"but I'm not going  to skedaddle.  The man that bets on my running will lose his money,  that's all.\"  He nodded confidently.    \"Oh, shucks!\" said the youth.  \"You ain't the bravest man in the world,  are you?\"    \"No, I ain't,\" exclaimed the loud soldier indignantly; \"and I didn't  say I was the bravest man in the world, neither.  I said I was going to  do my share of fighting--that's what I said.  And I am, too.  Who are  you, anyhow?  You talk as if you thought you was Napoleon Bonaparte.\"  He glared at the youth for a moment, and then strode away.    The youth called in a savage voice after his comrade:  \"Well, you  needn't git mad about it!\"  But the other continued on his way and made  no reply.    He felt alone in space when his injured comrade had disappeared.  His  failure to discover any mite of resemblance in their viewpoints made  him more miserable than before.  No one seemed to be wrestling with  such a terrific personal problem.  He was a mental outcast.    He went slowly to his tent and stretched himself on a blanket by the  side of the snoring tall soldier.  In the darkness he saw visions of a  thousand-tongued fear that would babble at his back and cause him to  flee, while others were going coolly about their country's business.  He admitted that he would not be able to cope with this monster.  He  felt that every nerve in his body would be an ear to hear the voices,  while other men would remain stolid and deaf.    And as he sweated with the pain of these thoughts, he could hear low,  serene sentences.  \"I'll bid five.\"  \"Make it six.\"  \"Seven.\" \"Seven  goes.\"    He stared at the red, shivering reflection of a fire on the white wall  of his tent until, exhausted and ill from the monotony of his  suffering, he fell asleep.          Chapter 3      When another night came, the columns, changed to purple streaks, filed  across two pontoon bridges.  A glaring fire wine-tinted the waters of  the river.  Its rays, shining upon the moving masses of troops, brought  forth here and there sudden gleams of silver or gold.  Upon the other  shore a dark and mysterious range of hills was curved against the sky.  The insect voices of the night sang solemnly.    After this crossing the youth assured himself that at any moment they  might be suddenly and fearfully assaulted from the caves of the  lowering woods.  He kept his eyes watchfully upon the darkness.    But his regiment went unmolested to a camping place, and its soldiers  slept the brave sleep of wearied men.  In the morning they were routed  out with early energy, and hustled along a narrow road that led deep  into the forest.    It was during this rapid march that the regiment lost many of the marks  of a new command.    The men had begun to count the miles upon their fingers, and they grew  tired.  \"Sore feet an' damned short rations, that's all,\" said the loud  soldier.  There was perspiration and grumblings.  After a time they  began to shed their knapsacks.  Some tossed them unconcernedly down;  others hid them carefully, asserting their plans to return for them at  some convenient time.  Men extricated themselves from thick shirts.  Presently few carried anything but their necessary clothing, blankets,  haversacks, canteens, and arms and ammunition.  \"You can now eat and  shoot,\" said the tall soldier to the youth.  \"That's all you want to  do.\"    There was sudden change from the ponderous infantry of theory to the  light and speedy infantry of practice.  The regiment, relieved of a  burden, received a new impetus.  But there was much loss of valuable  knapsacks, and, on the whole, very good shirts.    But the regiment was not yet veteranlike in appearance.  Veteran  regiments in the army were likely to be very small aggregations of men.  Once, when the command had first come to the field, some perambulating  veterans, noting the length of their column, had accosted them thus:  \"Hey, fellers, what brigade is that?\" And when the men had replied that  they formed a regiment and not a brigade, the older soldiers had  laughed, and said, \"O Gawd!\"    Also, there was too great a similarity in the hats.  The hats of a  regiment should properly represent the history of headgear for a period  of years.  And, moreover, there were no letters of faded gold speaking  from the colors.  They were new and beautiful, and the color bearer  habitually oiled the pole.    Presently the army again"]]]
