It isn't the money!\" cried Tom.  \"Don't think that for a  moment.  You see the European war has called for the use of a large  number of aeroplanes, and as the pilots of them frequently have to  fight, and so can not give their whole attention to the machines, some  form of automatic stabilizer is needed to prevent them turning turtle,  or going off at a wrong tangent.    \"So I have been working out a sort of modified gyroscope, and it seems  to answer the purpose.  I have already received advance orders for a  number of my devices from abroad, and as they are destined to save  lives I feel that I ought to keep on with my work.    \"I'd like to go, don't misunderstand me, but I can't go at this time.  It is out of the question.  If you wait a year, or maybe six months----\"    \"No, it is impossible to wait, Tom,\" declared Professor Bumper.    \"Is it so important then to hurry?\" asked Mr. Damon.  \"You did not  mention that to me, Professor Bumper.\"    \"No, I did not have time.  There are so many ends to my concerns.  But,  Tom Swift, you simply must go!\"    \"I can't, my dear professor, much as I should like to.\"    \"But, Tom, think of it!\" cried Mr. Damon, who was as much excited as  was the little bald-headed scientist.  \"You never saw such an idol of  gold as this.  What's its name?\" and he looked questioningly at the  professor.    \"Quitzel the idol is called,\" supplied Professor Bumper.  \"And it is  supposed to be in a buried city named Kurzon, somewhere in the Sierra  de Merendon range of mountains, in the vicinity of the Copan valley.  Copan is a city, or maybe we'll find it only a town when we get there,  and it is not far from the borders of Guatemala.    \"Tom, if I could show you the translations I have made of the ancient  documents, referring to this idol and the wonderful city over which it  kept guard, I'm sure you'd come with us.\"    \"Please don't tempt me,\" Tom said with a laugh.  \"I'm only too anxious  to go, and if it wasn't for the stabilizer I'd be with you in a minute.  But---- Well, you'll have to get along without me.  Maybe I can join  you later.\"    \"What's this about the idol keeping guard over the ancient city?\" asked  Ned, for he was interested in strange stories.    \"It seems,\" explained the professor, \"that in the early days there was  a strange race of people, inhabiting Central America, with a somewhat  high civilization, only traces of which remained when the Spaniards  came.    \"But these traces, and such hieroglyphics, or, to be more exact  pictographs, as I have been able to decipher from the old documents,  tell of one country, or perhaps it was only a city, over which this  great golden idol of Quitzel presided.    \"There is in some of these papers a description of the idol, which is  not exactly a beauty, judged from modern standards.  But the main fact  is that it is made of solid gold, and may weigh anywhere from one to  two tons.\"    \"Two tons of gold!\" cried New Newton.  \"Why, if that's the case it  would be worth----\" and he fell to doing a sum in mental arithmetic.    \"I am not so concerned about the monetary value of the statue as I am  about its antiquity,\" went on Professor Bumper.  \"There are other  statues in this buried city of Kurzon, and though they may not be so  valuable they will give me a wealth of material for my research work.\"    \"How do you know there are other statues?\" asked Mr. Damon.    \"Because my documents tell me so.  It was because the people made other  idols, in opposition, as it were, to Quitzel, that their city or  country was destroyed.  At least that is the legend.  Quitzel, so the  story goes, wanted to be the chief god, and when the image of a rival  was set up in the temple near him, he toppled over in anger, and part  of the temple went with him, the whole place being buried in ruins.  All the inhabitants were killed, and trace of the ancient city was lost  forever.  No, I hope not forever, for I expect to find it.\"    \"If all the people were killed, and the city buried, how did the story  of Quitzel become known?\" asked Mr. Damon.    \"One only of the priests in the temple of Quitzel escaped and set down  part of the tale,\" said the professor.  \"It is his narrative, or one  based on it, that I have given you.\"    \"And now, what I want to do, is to go and make a search for this buried  city.  I have fairly good directions as to how it may be reached.  We  will have little difficulty in getting to Honduras, as there are fruit  steamers frequently sailing.  Of course going into the interior--to the  Copan valley--is going to be harder.  But an expedition from a large  college was recently there and succeeded, after much labor, in  excavating part of a buried city.  Whether or not it was Kurzon I am  unable to say.    \"But if there was one ancient city there must be more.  So I want to  make an attempt.  And I counted on you, Tom.  You have had considerable  experience in strange quarters of the earth, and you're just the one to  help me.  I don't need money, for I have interested a certain  millionaire, and my own college will put up part of the funds.\"    \"Oh, it isn't a question of money,\" said Tom.  \"It's time.\"    \"That's just what it is with me!\" exclaimed Professor Bumper.  \"I  haven't any time to lose.  My rivals may, even now, be on their way to  Honduras!\"    \"Your rivals!\" cried Tom.  \"You didn't say anything about them!\"    \"No, I believe I didn't. There were so many other things to talk about.  But there is a rival archaeologist who would ask nothing better than to  get ahead of me in this matter.  He is younger than I am, and youth is  a big asset nowadays.\"    \"Pooh! You're not old!\" cried Mr. Damon.  \"You're no older than I am,  and I'm still young.  I'm a lot younger than some of these boys who are  afraid to tackle a trip through a tropical wilderness,\" and he  playfully nudged Tom in the ribs.    \"I'm not a bit afraid!\" retorted the young inventor.    \"No, I know you're not,\" laughed Mr. Damon.  \"But I've got to say  something, Tom, to stir you up.  Ned, how about you?  Would you go?\"    \"I can't, unless Tom does.  You see I'm his financial man now.\"    \"There you are, Tom Swift!\" cried Mr. Damon.  \"You see you are holding  back a number of persons just because you don't want to go.\"    \"I certainly wouldn't like to go without Tom,\" said the professor  slowly.  \"I really need his help.  You know, Tom, we would never have  found the city of Pelone if it had not been for you and your marvelous  powder.  The conditions in the Copan valley are likely to be still more  difficult to overcome, and I feel that I risk failure without your  young energy and your inventive mind to aid in the work and to suggest  possible means of attaining our object.  Come, Tom, reconsider, and  decide to make the trip.\"    \"And my promise to go was dependent on Tom's agreement to accompany  us,\" said Mr. Damon.    \"Come on!\" urged the professor, much as one boy might urge another to  take part in a ball game.  \"Don't let my rival get ahead of me.\"    \"I wouldn't like to see that,\" Tom said slowly.  \"Who is he--any one I  know?\"    \"I don't believe so, Tom.  He's connected with a large, new college  that has plenty of money to spend on explorations and research work.  Beecher is his name--Fenimore Beecher.\"    \"Beecher!\" exclaimed Tom, and there was such a change in his manner  that his friends could not help noticing it.  He jumped to his feet,  his eyes snapping, and he looked eagerly and anxiously at Professor  Bumper.    \"Did you say his name was Fenimore Beecher?\" Tom asked in a tense voice.    \"That's what it is--Professor Fenimore Beecher.  He is really a learned  young man, and thoroughly in earnest, though I do not like his manner.  But he is trying to get ahead of me, which may account for my feeling.\"    Tom Swift did not answer.  Instead he hurried from the room with a  murmured apology.    \"I'll be back in about five minutes,\" he said, as he went out.    \"Well, what's up now?\" asked Mr. Damon of Ned, as the young inventor  departed.  \"What set him off that way?\"    \"The mention of Beecher's name, evidently.  Though I never heard him  mention such a person before.\"    \"Nor did I ever hear Professor Beecher speak of Tom,\" said the  bald-headed scientist.  \"Well, we'll just have to wait until----\"    At that moment Tom came back into the room.    \"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"I have reconsidered my refusal to go to the  Copan valley after the idol of gold.  I'm going with you!\"    \"Good!\" cried Professor Bumper.    \"Fine!\" ejaculated Mr. Damon.  \"Bless my time-table!  I thought you'd  come around, Tom Swift.\"    \"But what about your stabilizer?\" asked Ned.    \"I was just talking to my father about it,\" the young inventor replied.  \"He will be able to put the finishing touches on it.  So I'll leave it  with him.  As soon as I can get ready I'll go, since you say haste is  necessary, Professor Bumper.\"    \"It is, if we are to get ahead of Beecher.\"    \"Then we'll get ahead of him!\" cried Tom.  \"I'm with you now from the  start to the finish.  I'll show him what I can do!\" he added, while Ned  and the others wondered at the sudden change in their friend's manner.          CHAPTER V    THE LITTLE GREEN GOD      \"Tom how soon can we go?\" asked Professor Bumper, as he began arranging  his papers, maps and documents ready to place them back in the valise.    \"Within a week, if you want to start that soon.\"    \"The sooner the better.  A week will suit me.  I don't know just what  Beecher's plans are, but, he may try to get on the ground first.  Though, without boasting, I may say that he has not had as much  experience as I have had, thanks to you, Tom, when you helped me find  the lost city of Pelone.\"    \"Well, I hope we'll be as successful this time,\" murmured Tom.  \"I  don't want to see Beecher beat you.\"   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5000"],[0,"The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci — Complete (#4)"],[1,"writing and the next.    [Footnote: 1. In the history of Florence in the early part of the  XVIth century _Piero di Braccio Martelli_ is frequently mentioned as  _Commissario della Signoria_. He was famous for his learning and at  his death left four books on Mathematics ready for the press; comp.  LITTA, _Famiglie celebri Italiane_, _Famiglia Martelli di  Firenze_.--In the Official Catalogue of MSS. in the Brit.

The Christian era was computed in  Florence at that time from the Incarnation (Lady day, March 25th).  Hence this should be 1509 by our reckoning.    3. _racolto tratto di molte carte le quali io ho qui copiate_. We  must suppose that Leonardo means that he has copied out his own MSS.  and not those of others. The first thirteen leaves of the MS. in the  Brit. Mus. are a fair copy of some notes on physics.]    Suggestions for the arrangement of MSS treating of particular  subjects.(5-8).    5.    Of digging a canal. Put this in the Book of useful inventions and in  proving them bring forward the propositions already proved. And this  is the proper order; since if you wished to show the usefulness of  any plan you would be obliged again to devise new machines to prove  its utility and thus would confuse the order of the forty Books and  also the order of the diagrams; that is to say you would have to mix  up practice with theory, which would produce a confused and  incoherent work.    6.    I am not to blame for putting forward, in the course of my work on  science, any general rule derived from a previous conclusion.    7.    The Book of the science of Mechanics must precede the Book of useful  inventions.--Have your books on anatomy bound! [Footnote: 4. The  numerous notes on anatomy written on loose leaves and now in the  Royal collection at Windsor can best be classified in four Books,  corresponding to the different character and size of the paper. When  Leonardo speaks of '_li tua libri di notomia_', he probably means  the MSS. which still exist; if this hypothesis is correct the  present condition of these leaves might seem to prove that he only  carried out his purpose with one of the Books on anatomy. A borrowed  book on Anatomy is mentioned in F.O.]    8.    The order of your book must proceed on this plan: first simple  beams, then (those) supported from below, then suspended in part,  then wholly [suspended]. Then beams as supporting other weights  [Footnote: 4. Leonardo's notes on Mechanics are extraordinarily  numerous; but, for the reasons assigned in my introduction, they  have not been included in the present work.].    General introductions to the book on Painting (9-13).    9.    INTRODUCTION.    Seeing that I can find no subject specially useful or  pleasing--since the men who have come before me have taken for their  own every useful or necessary theme--I must do like one who, being  poor, comes last to the fair, and can find no other way of providing  himself than by taking all the things already seen by other buyers,  and not taken but refused by reason of their lesser value. I, then,  will load my humble pack with this despised and rejected  merchandise, the refuse of so many buyers; and will go about to  distribute it, not indeed in great cities, but in the poorer towns,  taking such a price as the wares I offer may be worth. [Footnote: It  need hardly be pointed out that there is in this 'Proemio' a covert  irony. In the second and third prefaces, Leonardo characterises his  rivals and opponents more closely. His protest is directed against  Neo-latinism as professed by most of the humanists of his time; its  futility is now no longer questioned.]    10.    INTRODUCTION.    I know that many will call this useless work [Footnote: 3. questa  essere opera inutile. By opera we must here understand libro di  pittura and particularly the treatise on Perspective.]; and they  will be those of whom Demetrius [Footnote: 4. Demetrio. \"With regard  to the passage attributed to Demetrius\", Dr. H. MÜLLER STRÜBING  writes, \"I know not what to make of it. It is certainly not  Demetrius Phalereus that is meant and it can hardly be Demetrius  Poliorcetes. Who then can it be--for the name is a very common one?  It may be a clerical error for Demades and the maxim is quite in the  spirit of his writings I have not however been able to find any  corresponding passage either in the 'Fragments' (C. MULLER, _Orat.  Att._, II. 441) nor in the Supplements collected by DIETZ (_Rhein.  Mus._, vol. 29, p. 108).\"    The same passage occurs as a simple Memorandum in the MS. Tr. 57,  apparently as a note for this '_Proemio_' thus affording some data  as to the time where these introductions were written.] declared  that he took no more account of the wind that came out their mouth  in words, than of that they expelled from their lower parts: men who  desire nothing but material riches and are absolutely devoid of that  of wisdom, which is the food and the only true riches of the mind.  For so much more worthy as the soul is than the body, so much more  noble are the possessions of the soul than those of the body. And  often, when I see one of these men take this work in his hand, I  wonder that he does not put it to his nose, like a monkey, or ask me  if it is something good to eat.    [Footnote: In the original, the Proemio dì prospettiva cioè  dell'uffitio dell'occhio (see No. 21) stands between this and the  preceding one, No. 9.]    INTRODUCTION.    I am fully concious that, not being a literary man, certain  presumptuous persons will think that they may reasonably blame me;  alleging that I am not a man of letters. Foolish folks! do they not  know that I might retort as Marius did to the Roman Patricians  [Footnote 21: _Come Mario disse ai patriti Romani_. \"I am unable to  find the words here attributed by Leonardo to Marius, either in  Plutarch's Life of Marius or in the Apophthegmata (_Moralia_,  p.202). Nor do they occur in the writings of Valerius Maximus (who  frequently mentions Marius) nor in Velleius Paterculus (II, 11 to  43), Dio Cassius, Aulus Gellius, or Macrobius. Professor E.  MENDELSON of Dorpat, the editor of Herodian, assures me that no such  passage is the found in that author\" (communication from Dr. MULLER  STRUBING). Leonardo evidently meant to allude to some well known  incident in Roman history and the mention of Marius is the result  probably of some confusion. We may perhaps read, for Marius,  Menenius Agrippa, though in that case it is true we must alter  Patriti to Plebei. The change is a serious one. but it would render  the passage perfectly clear.] by saying: That they, who deck  themselves out in the labours of others will not allow me my own.  They will say that I, having no literary skill, cannot properly  express that which I desire to treat of [Footnote 26: _le mie cose  .... che d'altra parola_. This can hardly be reconciled with Mons.  RAVAISSON'S estimate of L. da Vinci's learning. \"_Leonard de Vinci  etait un admirateur et un disciple des anciens, aussi bien dans  l'art que dans la science et il tenait a passer pour tel meme aux  yeux de la posterite._\" _Gaz. des Beaux arts. Oct. 1877.]; but they  do not know that my subjects are to be dealt with by experience  rather than by words [Footnote 28: See Footnote 26]; and  [experience] has been the mistress of those who wrote well. And so,  as mistress, I will cite her in all cases.    11.    Though I may not, like them, be able to quote other authors, I shall  rely on that which is much greater and more worthy:--on experience,  the mistress of their Masters. They go about puffed up and pompous,  dressed and decorated with [the fruits], not of their own labours,  but of those of others. And they will not allow me my own. They will  scorn me as an inventor; but how much more might they--who are not  inventors but vaunters and declaimers of the works of others--be  blamed.    INTRODUCTION.    And those men who are inventors and interpreters between Nature and  Man, as compared with boasters and declaimers of the works of  others, must be regarded and not otherwise esteemed than as the  object in front of a mirror, when compared with its image seen in  the mirror. For the first is something in itself, and the other  nothingness.--Folks little indebted to Nature, since it is only by  chance that they wear the human form and without it I might class  them with the herds of beasts.    12.    Many will think they may reasonably blame me by alleging that my  proofs are opposed to the authority of certain men held in the  highest reverence by their inexperienced judgments; not considering  that my works are the issue of pure and simple experience, who is  the one true mistress. These rules are sufficient to enable you to  know the true from the false--and this aids men to look only for  things that are possible and with due moderation--and not to wrap  yourself in ignorance, a thing which can have no good result, so  that in despair you would give yourself up to melancholy.    13.    Among all the studies of natural causes and reasons Light chiefly  delights the beholder; and among the great features of Mathematics  the certainty of its demonstrations is what preeminently (tends to)  elevate the mind of the investigator. Perspective, therefore, must  be preferred to all the discourses and systems of human learning. In  this branch [of science] the beam of light is explained on those  methods of demonstration which form the glory not so much of  Mathematics as of Physics and are graced with the flowers of both  [Footnote: 5. Such of Leonardo's notes on Optics or on Perspective  as bear exclusively on Mathematics or Physics could not be included  in the arrangement of the _libro di pittura_ which is here presented  to the reader.
