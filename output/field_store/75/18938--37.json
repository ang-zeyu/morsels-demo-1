You have  got a front. You mugged that stuff away, and you'll have to get us out  of the mess.\"    It made him wild to be called a mug, and we swore and growled at each  other for a while; but we daren't speak loud enough to have a fight, so  at last I agreed to toss up for it, and I lost.    Bill started to give me some of his points, but I shut him up quick.    \"You've had your turn, and made a mess of it,\" I said. \"For God's sake  give me a show. Now, I'll go into the bar and ask for the swags, and  carry them out on to the veranda, and then go back to settle up. You  keep him talking all the time. You dump the two swags together, and  smoke like sheol. That's all you've got to do.\"    I went into the bar, got the swags front the missus, carried them out on  to the veranda, and then went back.    Stiffner came in.    \"Good morning!\"    \"Good morning, sir,\" says Stiffner.    \"It'll be a nice day, I think?\"    \"Yes, I think so. I suppose you are going on?\"    \"Yes, we'll have to make a move to-day.\"    Then I hooked carelessly on to the counter with one elbow, and looked  dreamy-like out across the clearing, and presently I gave a sort of sigh  and said: \"Ah, well! I think I'll have a beer.\"    \"Right you are! Where's your mate?\"    \"Oh, he's round at the back. He'll be round directly; but he ain't  drinking this morning.\"    Stiffner laughed that nasty empty laugh of his. He thought Bill was  whipping the cat.    \"What's yours, boss?\" I said.    \"Thankee!... Here's luck!\"    \"Here's luck!\"    The country was pretty open round there--the nearest timber was better  than a mile away, and I wanted to give Bill a good start across the flat  before the go-as-you-can commenced; so I talked for a while, and while  we were talking I thought I might as well go the whole hog--I might as  well die for a pound as a penny, if I had to die; and if I hadn't I'd  have the pound to the good, anyway, so to speak. Anyhow, the risk would  be about the same, or less, for I might have the spirit to run harder  the more I had to run for--the more spirits I had to run for, in fact,  as it turned out--so I says:    \"I think I'll take one of them there flasks of whisky to last us on the  road.\"    \"Right y'are,\" says Stiffner. \"What'll ye have--a small one or a big  one?\"    \"Oh, a big one, I think--if I can get it into my pocket.\"    \"It'll be a tight squeeze,\" he said, and he laughed.    \"I'll try,\" I said. \"Bet you two drinks I'll get it in.\"    \"Done!\" he says. \"The top inside coat-pocket, and no tearing.\"    It was a big bottle, and all my pockets were small; but I got it into  the pocket he'd betted against. It was a tight squeeze, but I got it in.    Then we both laughed, but his laugh was nastier than usual, because it  was meant to be pleasant, and he'd lost two drinks; and my laugh wasn't  easy--I was anxious as to which of us would laugh next.    Just then I noticed something, and an idea struck me--about the most  up-to-date idea that ever struck me in my life. I noticed that Stiffner  was limping on his right foot this morning, so I said to him:    \"What's up with your foot?\" putting my hand in my pocket. \"Oh, it's a  crimson nail in my boot,\" he said. \"I thought I got the blanky thing out  this morning; but I didn't.\"    There just happened to be an old bag of shoemaker's tools in the bar,  belonging to an old cobbler who was lying dead drunk on the veranda. So  I said, taking my hand out of my pocket again:    \"Lend us the boot, and I'll fix it in a minute. That's my old trade.\"    \"Oh, so you're a shoemaker,\" he said. \"I'd never have thought it.\"    He laughs one of his useless laughs that wasn't wanted, and slips off  the boot--he hadn't laced it up--and hands it across the bar to me.  It was an ugly brute--a great thick, iron-bound, boiler-plated navvy's  boot. It made me feel sore when I looked at it.    I got the bag and pretended to fix the nail; but I didn't.    \"There's a couple of nails gone from the sole,\" I said. \"I'll put 'em  in if I can find any hobnails, and it'll save the sole,\" and I rooted in  the bag and found a good long nail, and shoved it right through the sole  on the sly. He'd been a bit of a sprinter in his time, and I thought  it might be better for me in the near future if the spikes of his  running-shoes were inside.    \"There, you'll find that better, I fancy,\" I said, standing the boot on  the bar counter, but keeping my hand on it in an absent-minded kind of  way. Presently I yawned and stretched myself, and said in a careless  way:    \"Ah, well! How's the slate?\" He scratched the back of his head and  pretended to think.    \"Oh, well, we'll call it thirty bob.\"    Perhaps he thought I'd slap down two quid.    \"Well,\" I says, \"and what will you do supposing we don't pay you?\"    He looked blank for a moment. Then he fired up and gasped and choked  once or twice; and then he cooled down suddenly and laughed his nastiest  laugh--he was one of those men who always laugh when they're wild--and  said in a nasty, quiet tone:    \"You thundering, jumped-up crawlers! If you don't (something) well part  up I'll take your swags and (something) well kick your gory pants so you  won't be able to sit down for a month--or stand up either!\"    \"Well, the sooner you begin the better,\" I said; and I chucked the boot  into a corner and bolted.      He jumped the bar counter, got his boot, and came after me. He paused  to slip the boot on--but he only made one step, and then gave a howl and  slung the boot off and rushed back. When I looked round again he'd got  a slipper on, and was coming--and gaining on me, too. I shifted scenery  pretty quick the next five minutes. But I was soon pumped. My heart  began to beat against the ceiling of my head, and my lungs all choked  up in my throat. When I guessed he was getting within kicking distance  I glanced round so's to dodge the kick. He let out; but I shied just in  time. He missed fire, and the slipper went about twenty feet up in the  air and fell in a waterhole.    He was done then, for the ground was stubbly and stony. I seen Bill on  ahead pegging out for the horizon, and I took after him and reached for  the timber for all I was worth, for I'd seen Stiffner's missus coming  with a shovel--to bury the remains, I suppose; and those two were a good  match--Stiffner and his missus, I mean.    Bill looked round once, and melted into the bush pretty soon after that.  When I caught up he was about done; but I grabbed my swag and we pushed  on, for I told Bill that I'd seen Stiffner making for the stables when  I'd last looked round; and Bill thought that we'd better get lost in the  bush as soon as ever we could, and stay lost, too, for Stiffner was a  man that couldn't stand being had.    The first thing that Bill said when we got safe into camp was: \"I told  you that we'd pull through all right. You need never be frightened when  you're travelling with me. Just take my advice and leave things to me,  and we'll hang out all right. Now-.\"    But I shut him up. He made me mad.    \"Why, you--! What the sheol did _you_ do?\"    \"Do?\" he says. \"I got away with the swags, didn't I? Where'd they be now  if it wasn't for me?\"    Then I sat on him pretty hard for his pretensions, and paid him out for  all the patronage he'd worked off on me, and called him a mug straight,  and walked round him, so to speak, and blowed, and told him never to  pretend to me again that he was a battler.    Then, when I thought I'd licked him into form, I cooled down and soaped  him up a bit; but I never thought that he had three climaxes and a  crisis in store for me.    He took it all pretty cool; he let me have my fling, and gave me time to  get breath; then he leaned languidly over on his right side, shoved his  left hand down into his left trouserpocket, and brought up a boot-lace,  a box of matches, and nine-and-six.    As soon as I got the focus of it I gasped:    \"Where the deuce did you get that?\"    \"I had it all along,\" he said, \"but I seen at the pub that you had the  show to chew a lug, so I thought we'd save it--nine-and-sixpences ain't  picked up every day.\"    Then he leaned over on his left, went down into the other pocket, and  came up with a piece of tobacco and half-a-sovereign.    My eyes bulged out.    \"Where the blazes did you get that from?\" I yelled.    \"That,\" he said, \"was the half-quid you give me last night. Half-quids  ain't to be thrown away these times; and, besides, I had a down on  Stiffner, and meant to pay him out; I reckoned that if we wasn't sharp  enough to take him down we hadn't any business to be supposed to be  alive. Anyway, I guessed we'd do it; and so we did--and got a bottle of  whisky into the bargain.\"    Then he leaned back, tired-like, against the log, and dredged his upper  left-hand waistcoat-pocket, and brought up a sovereign wrapped in a  pound note. Then he waited for me to speak; but I couldn't. I got my  mouth open, but couldn't get it shut again.    \"I got that out of the mugs last night, but I thought that we'd want it,  and might as well keep it. Quids ain't so easily picked up, nowadays;  and, besides, we need stuff more'n Stiffner does, and so--\"    \"And did he know you had the stuff?\" I gasped.    \"Oh, yes, that's the fun of it. That's what made him so excited. He was  in the parlour all the time I was playing. But we might as well have a  drink!    \"We did. I wanted it.\"      Bill turned in by-and-by, and looked like a sleeping innocent in the  moonlight. I sat up late, and smoked, and thought hard, and watched  Bill, and turned in, and thought till near daylight, and then went to  sleep, and had a nightmare about it. I dreamed I chased Stiffner forty  miles to buy his pub, and that Bill turned out to be his nephew.    Bill divvied up all right, and gave me half a crown over,"]]]
