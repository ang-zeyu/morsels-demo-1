[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/470"],[0,"Heretics (#4)"],[1,"leave us  face to face with the problem of a human consciousness filled with very  definite images of evil, and with no definite image of good. To us  light must be henceforward the dark thing--the thing of which we cannot  speak.  To us, as to Milton's devils in Pandemonium, it is darkness  that is visible.  The human race, according to religion, fell once, and  in falling gained knowledge of good and of evil. Now we have fallen a  second time, and only the knowledge of evil remains to us.    A great silent collapse, an enormous unspoken disappointment, has in  our time fallen on our Northern civilization.  All previous ages have  sweated and been crucified in an attempt to realize what is really the  right life, what was really the good man. A definite part of the modern  world has come beyond question to the conclusion that there is no  answer to these questions, that the most that we can do is to set up a  few notice-boards at places of obvious danger, to warn men, for  instance, against drinking themselves to death, or ignoring the mere  existence of their neighbours.  Ibsen is the first to return from the  baffled hunt to bring us the tidings of great failure.    Every one of the popular modern phrases and ideals is a dodge in order  to shirk the problem of what is good. We are fond of talking about  \"liberty\"; that, as we talk of it, is a dodge to avoid discussing what  is good.  We are fond of talking about \"progress\"; that is a dodge to  avoid discussing what is good. We are fond of talking about  \"education\"; that is a dodge to avoid discussing what is good.  The  modern man says, \"Let us leave all these arbitrary standards and  embrace liberty.\" This is, logically rendered, \"Let us not decide what  is good, but let it be considered good not to decide it.\"  He says,  \"Away with your old moral formulae; I am for progress.\" This, logically  stated, means, \"Let us not settle what is good; but let us settle  whether we are getting more of it.\" He says, \"Neither in religion nor  morality, my friend, lie the hopes of the race, but in education.\"  This, clearly expressed, means, \"We cannot decide what is good, but let  us give it to our children.\"    Mr. H.G. Wells, that exceedingly clear-sighted man, has pointed out in  a recent work that this has happened in connection with economic  questions. The old economists, he says, made generalizations, and they  were (in Mr. Wells's view) mostly wrong.  But the new economists, he  says, seem to have lost the power of making any generalizations at all.  And they cover this incapacity with a general claim to be, in specific  cases, regarded as \"experts\", a claim \"proper enough in a hairdresser  or a fashionable physician, but indecent in a philosopher or a man of  science.\" But in spite of the refreshing rationality with which Mr.  Wells has indicated this, it must also be said that he himself has  fallen into the same enormous modern error.  In the opening pages of  that excellent book MANKIND IN THE MAKING, he dismisses the ideals of  art, religion, abstract morality, and the rest, and says that he is  going to consider men in their chief function, the function of  parenthood. He is going to discuss life as a \"tissue of births.\"  He is  not going to ask what will produce satisfactory saints or satisfactory  heroes, but what will produce satisfactory fathers and mothers.  The  whole is set forward so sensibly that it is a few moments at least  before the reader realises that it is another example of unconscious  shirking.  What is the good of begetting a man until we have settled  what is the good of being a man? You are merely handing on to him a  problem you dare not settle yourself. It is as if a man were asked,  \"What is the use of a hammer?\" and answered, \"To make hammers\"; and  when asked, \"And of those hammers, what is the use?\" answered, \"To make  hammers again\". Just as such a man would be perpetually putting off the  question of the ultimate use of carpentry, so Mr. Wells and all the  rest of us are by these phrases successfully putting off the question  of the ultimate value of the human life.    The case of the general talk of \"progress\" is, indeed, an extreme one.  As enunciated today, \"progress\" is simply a comparative of which we  have not settled the superlative. We meet every ideal of religion,  patriotism, beauty, or brute pleasure with the alternative ideal of  progress--that is to say, we meet every proposal of getting something  that we know about, with an alternative proposal of getting a great  deal more of nobody knows what.  Progress, properly understood, has,  indeed, a most dignified and legitimate meaning.  But as used in  opposition to precise moral ideals, it is ludicrous.  So far from it  being the truth that the ideal of progress is to be set against that of  ethical or religious finality, the reverse is the truth. Nobody has any  business to use the word \"progress\" unless he has a definite creed and  a cast-iron code of morals. Nobody can be progressive without being  doctrinal; I might almost say that nobody can be progressive without  being infallible--at any rate, without believing in some infallibility.  For progress by its very name indicates a direction; and the moment we  are in the least doubtful about the direction, we become in the same  degree doubtful about the progress. Never perhaps since the beginning  of the world has there been an age that had less right to use the word  \"progress\" than we. In the Catholic twelfth century, in the philosophic  eighteenth century, the direction may have been a good or a bad one,  men may have differed more or less about how far they went, and in what  direction, but about the direction they did in the main agree, and  consequently they had the genuine sensation of progress. But it is  precisely about the direction that we disagree. Whether the future  excellence lies in more law or less law, in more liberty or less  liberty; whether property will be finally concentrated or finally cut  up; whether sexual passion will reach its sanest in an almost virgin  intellectualism or in a full animal freedom; whether we should love  everybody with Tolstoy, or spare nobody with Nietzsche;--these are the  things about which we are actually fighting most.  It is not merely  true that the age which has settled least what is progress is this  \"progressive\" age. It is, moreover, true that the people who have  settled least what is progress are the most \"progressive\" people in it.  The ordinary mass, the men who have never troubled about progress,  might be trusted perhaps to progress.  The particular individuals who  talk about progress would certainly fly to the four winds of heaven  when the pistol-shot started the race. I do not, therefore, say that  the word \"progress\" is unmeaning; I say it is unmeaning without the  previous definition of a moral doctrine, and that it can only be  applied to groups of persons who hold that doctrine in common.  Progress is not an illegitimate word, but it is logically evident that  it is illegitimate for us. It is a sacred word, a word which could only  rightly be used by rigid believers and in the ages of faith.        III.  On Mr. Rudyard Kipling and Making the World Small    There is no such thing on earth as an uninteresting subject; the only  thing that can exist is an uninterested person. Nothing is more keenly  required than a defence of bores. When Byron divided humanity into the  bores and bored, he omitted to notice that the higher qualities exist  entirely in the bores, the lower qualities in the bored, among whom he  counted himself. The bore, by his starry enthusiasm, his solemn  happiness, may, in some sense, have proved himself poetical.  The bored  has certainly proved himself prosaic.    We might, no doubt, find it a nuisance to count all the blades of grass  or all the leaves of the trees; but this would not be because of our  boldness or gaiety, but because of our lack of boldness and gaiety. The  bore would go onward, bold and gay, and find the blades of grass as  splendid as the swords of an army.  The bore is stronger and more  joyous than we are; he is a demigod--nay, he is a god. For it is the  gods who do not tire of the iteration of things; to them the nightfall  is always new, and the last rose as red as the first.    The sense that everything is poetical is a thing solid and absolute; it  is not a mere matter of phraseology or persuasion.  It is not merely  true, it is ascertainable.  Men may be challenged to deny it; men may  be challenged to mention anything that is not a matter of poetry. I  remember a long time ago a sensible sub-editor coming up to me with a  book in his hand, called \"Mr. Smith,\" or \"The Smith Family,\" or some  such thing.  He said, \"Well, you won't get any of your damned mysticism  out of this,\" or words to that effect.  I am happy to say that I  undeceived him; but the victory was too obvious and easy. In most cases  the name is unpoetical, although the fact is poetical. In the case of  Smith, the name is so poetical that it must be an arduous and heroic  matter for the man to live up to it. The name of Smith is the name of  the one trade that even kings respected, it could claim half the glory  of that arma virumque which all epics acclaimed.  The spirit of the  smithy is so close to the spirit of song that it has mixed in a million  poems, and every blacksmith is a harmonious blacksmith.    Even the village children feel that in some dim way the smith is  poetic, as the grocer and the cobbler are not poetic, when they feast  on the dancing sparks and deafening blows in the cavern of that  creative violence.  The brute repose of Nature, the passionate cunning  of man, the strongest of earthly metals, the wierdest of earthly  elements, the unconquerable iron subdued by its only conqueror, the  wheel and the ploughshare, the sword and the steam-hammer, the arraying  of armies and the whole legend of arms,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47109"],[0,"Gospel Doctrine: Selections from the Sermons and Writings of Joseph F. Smith (#4)"],[1,"principles are always true and  are always absolutely necessary for the salvation of the children of  men, no matter who they are or where they are. These principles are  always true, and you cannot get away from them. No other name, under  heaven, is given, but that of Jesus Christ, by which you can be saved  or exalted in the Kingdom of God. No man can enter into the kingdom  of heaven except he be born again of the water and of the Spirit.  These principles are indispensable, for God has declared them. Not  only has Christ declared them by his own voice, and his disciples from  generation to generation, in the olden time, but in these latter days,  they have taken up the same testimony and declared these things to the  world. They are true today as they were true then, and we must obey  these things.--_Apr. C. R.,_ 1911, pp. 7, 8.    MAN'S GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT. The greatest achievement mankind can make  in this world is to familiarize themselves with divine truth, so  thoroughly, so perfectly, that the example or conduct of no creature  living in the world can ever turn them away from the knowledge that  they have obtained. \"In the footsteps of the Master,\" the greatest of  all the teachers that this world has ever received, is the {5} safest  and surest course to pursue that I know of in the world. We can absorb  the precepts, the doctrines and the divine word of the Master, without  any fear that the exemplar will fail of carrying out and executing his  own precepts and fulfilling his own doctrines and requirements.    From my boyhood I have desired to learn the principles of the gospel  in such a way and to such an extent that it would matter not to me who  might fall from the truth, who might make a mistake, who might fail to  continue to follow the example of the Master, my foundation would be  sure and certain in the truths that I have learned, though all men else  go astray and fail of obedience to them. We all have heard of people  who have pinned their faith to the arm of flesh, who have felt that  their belief, their confidence and their love for the principles of  the gospel of Jesus Christ would be shattered, if their ideals--those  possibly who first taught them the principles of the gospel--should  make a mistake, falter or fall.    I know of but One in all the world who can be taken as the first and  only perfect standard for us to follow, and he is the Only Begotten Son  of God. I would feel sorry indeed, if I had a friend or an associate  in this life who would turn away from the plan of life and salvation  because I might stumble or make a failure of my life. I want no man  to lean upon me nor to follow me, only so far as I am a consistent  follower in the footsteps of the Master.--_Juvenile Instructor,_ 1915,  Vol. 50, pp. 738, 739.    TRUTH AND RIGHTEOUSNESS WILL PREVAIL. I do not expect any victory,  any triumph, anything to boast of, to come to the Latter-day Saints,  except upon the principles of righteousness and of truth. Truth and  righteousness will prevail and endure. If we will only continue to  build upon the principles of righteousness, of truth, of justice, and  of honor, I say to you there is no power beneath the celestial kingdom  that can stay the progress of this work. And as {6} this work shall  progress, and shall gain power and influence among men, so the powers  of the adversary and of darkness will diminish before the advancement  and growth of this kingdom, until the kingdom of God, and not of men,  will triumph.--_Apr. C. R.,_ 1914, p. 4.    REALITY OF THE FAITH OF THE SAINTS. There is no doubt in the minds  of Latter-day Saints in relation to the existence and personage of  the Lord God Almighty, who is the Father of our Lord and Savior Jesus  Christ. There is no doubt in the minds of Latter-day Saints that Jesus  is the Son of God, being begotten of the Father in the flesh. And there  is no Latter-day Saint in all the world but knows as truly and as fully  as God can impart that knowledge to the soul of man, that he shall live  again after death, and that men and women shall be associated together  as God has ordained, and they have been united by his power, to dwell  together forever and forever; and they shall know as they are known,  they shall see as they are seen, and they shall understand as God  understands; for they are his children.--_Apr. C. R.,_ 1907, p. 39.    MEANING OF SCIENCE. True science is that system of reasoning which  brings to the fore the simple, plain truth. The Savior of the world was  pre-eminently the Scientist of this earth, and the truths he uttered  1900 years ago have withstood the assaults of science and prejudice and  hate.--_Logan Journal,_ Logan, February 6, 1912.    ALL TRUTH FROM GOD. Let us sustain the cause of Zion. Let no man  speak lightly of the principles of the gospel. Let no one treat  lightly the ordinances of the house of God. Let no one hold in  derision the Priesthood that the Lord has restored to the earth,  which is the authority that he has given unto men. Let no man look  contemptuously upon the organization of the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints as it has been established in the earth through the  instrumentality of the Prophet Joseph Smith, {7} whom the Lord raised  up when he was but a child to lay the foundation of the same. Let no  man treat these things lightly or doubtingly; but let every man seek  earnestly to understand the truth and teach his children to become  familiar with those truths of heaven that have been restored to the  earth in the latter-days. I believe with all my soul in God the Father  and our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. I believe with all my might,  mind and strength in the Savior of the world, and in the principle of  redemption from death and sin. I believe in the divine mission of the  Prophet Joseph Smith. I believe in all the truth that I know, and I  believe that there are many principles of eternal truth that still lie  hidden from me and from the understanding of men, which will yet be  revealed by the power of God unto his faithful servants. I believe that  the Lord has revealed to the children of men all that they know. I do  not believe that any man has discovered any principle of science, or  art, in mechanism, or mathematics, or anything else, that God did not  know before man did. Man is indebted to the Source of all intelligence  and truth, for the knowledge that he possesses; and all who will yield  obedience to the promptings of the Spirit, which lead to virtue, to  honor, to the love of God and man, and to the love of truth and that  which is ennobling and enlarging to the soul, will get a cleaner, a  more expansive, and a more direct and conclusive knowledge of God's  truths than anyone else can obtain. I tell you this, because I know it  is true. The Lord Almighty lives; he made the heavens and the earth,  and the fountains of water; and we are his children, his offspring,  and we are not here by chance. The Lord designed our coming, and the  object of our being. He designs that we shall accomplish our mission,  to become conformed to the likeness and image of Jesus Christ, that,  like him, we may be without sin unto salvation, like him we may be  filled with pure intelligence, and like him we may be exalted to the  right {8} hand of the Father, to sit upon thrones and have dominion,  and power in the sphere in which we shall be called to act. I testify  to this doctrine, for the Lord has made me to know and feel the truth  of it from the crown of my head to the soles of my feet. I love good,  honorable men--even men who may be mistaken, as far as their judgment  is concerned, but who try to do right; I love them for the reason that  they are my brethren, the sons of my Father, and I would that they  might all see the truth as it is in Christ Jesus, and accept it, and  receive all the benefits of it, in time and throughout all eternity. If  the Lord has revealed to the world the plan of salvation and redemption  from sin, by which men may be exalted again into his presence and  partake of eternal life with him, I submit, as a proposition that  cannot be controverted, that no man can be exalted in the presence of  God and attain to a fulness of glory and happiness in his kingdom and  presence, save and except he will obey the plan that God has devised  and revealed.--_Apr. C. R.,_ 1902, pp. 85, 86.    THE SAINTS MAY KNOW THE TRUTH. To the faithful Latter-day Saint is  given the right to know the truth, as God knows it; and no power  beneath the celestial kingdom can lead him astray, darken his  understanding, becloud his mind or dim his faith or his knowledge of  the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ. It can't be done, for the  light of God shines brighter than the illumination of a falsehood and  error; therefore, those who possess the light of Christ, the spirit of  revelation and the knowledge of God, rise above all these vagaries in  the world; they know of this doctrine, that it is of God and not of  man.--_Oct. C. R.,_ 1909, p. 9.    HOW THE TRUTH MAY BE KNOWN. It is a wicked and adulterous generation  that seeketh after a sign. Show me Latter-day Saints who have to feed  upon miracles, signs and visions in order to keep them steadfast in the  Church, and {9} I will show you members of the Church who are not in  good standing before God, and who are walking in slippery paths. It is  not by marvelous manifestations unto us that we shall be established  in the truth, but it is by humility and faithful obedience to the  commandments and laws of God. When I as a boy first started out in  the ministry, I would frequently go out and ask the Lord to show me  some marvelous thing, in order that I might receive a testimony. But  the Lord withheld marvels from me, and showed me the truth, line upon  line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little, until he  made me to know the truth from the crown of my head to the soles of my  feet,"]]]
