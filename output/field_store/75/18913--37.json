Homer's position, however, is peculiar: just as he was in the  serious style the poet of poets, standing alone not only through the  literary excellence, but also through the dramatic character of his  imitations, so too he was the first to outline for us the general forms  of Comedy by producing not a dramatic invective, but a dramatic picture  of the Ridiculous; his _Margites_ in fact stands in the same relation  to our comedies as the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_ to our tragedies. As soon,  however, as Tragedy and Comedy appeared in the field, those naturally  drawn to the one line of poetry became writers of comedies instead of  iambs, and those naturally drawn to the other, writers of tragedies  instead of epics, because these new modes of art were grander and of  more esteem than the old.    If it be asked whether Tragedy is now all that it need be in its  formative elements, to consider that, and decide it theoretically and in  relation to the theatres, is a matter for another inquiry.    It certainly began in improvisations--as did also Comedy; the one  originating with the authors of the Dithyramb, the other with those of  the phallic songs, which still survive as institutions in many of our  cities. And its advance after that was little by little, through their  improving on whatever they had before them at each stage. It was in fact  only after a long series of changes that the movement of Tragedy stopped  on its attaining to its natural form. (1) The number of actors was first  increased to two by Aeschylus, who curtailed the business of the Chorus,  and made the dialogue, or spoken portion, take the leading part in the  play. (2) A third actor and scenery were due to Sophocles. (3) Tragedy  acquired also its magnitude. Discarding short stories and a ludicrous  diction, through its passing out of its satyric stage, it assumed,  though only at a late point in its progress, a tone of dignity; and  its metre changed then from trochaic to iambic. The reason for their  original use of the trochaic tetrameter was that their poetry was  satyric and more connected with dancing than it now is. As soon,  however, as a spoken part came in, nature herself found the appropriate  metre. The iambic, we know, is the most speakable of metres, as is shown  by the fact that we very often fall into it in conversation, whereas we  rarely talk hexameters, and only when we depart from the speaking tone  of voice. (4) Another change was a plurality of episodes or acts. As for  the remaining matters, the superadded embellishments and the account of  their introduction, these must be taken as said, as it would probably be  a long piece of work to go through the details.          5      As for Comedy, it is (as has been observed) an imitation of men worse  than the average; worse, however, not as regards any and every sort of  fault, but only as regards one particular kind, the Ridiculous, which  is a species of the Ugly. The Ridiculous may be defined as a mistake  or deformity not productive of pain or harm to others; the mask, for  instance, that excites laughter, is something ugly and distorted without  causing pain.    Though the successive changes in Tragedy and their authors are not  unknown, we cannot say the same of Comedy; its early stages passed  unnoticed, because it was not as yet taken up in a serious way. It was  only at a late point in its progress that a chorus of comedians was  officially granted by the archon; they used to be mere volunteers. It  had also already certain definite forms at the time when the record of  those termed comic poets begins. Who it was who supplied it with masks,  or prologues, or a plurality of actors and the like, has remained  unknown. The invented Fable, or Plot, however, originated in Sicily,  with Epicharmus and Phormis; of Athenian poets Crates was the first  to drop the Comedy of invective and frame stories of a general and  non-personal nature, in other words, Fables or Plots.    Epic poetry, then, has been seen to agree with Tragedy to this extent,  that of being an imitation of serious subjects in a grand kind of verse.  It differs from it, however, (1) in that it is in one kind of verse and  in narrative form; and (2) in its length--which is due to its action  having no fixed limit of time, whereas Tragedy endeavours to keep as far  as possible within a single circuit of the sun, or something near that.  This, I say, is another point of difference between them, though at  first the practice in this respect was just the same in tragedies as  in epic poems. They differ also (3) in their constituents, some being  common to both and others peculiar to Tragedy--hence a judge of good and  bad in Tragedy is a judge of that in epic poetry also. All the parts of  an epic are included in Tragedy; but those of Tragedy are not all of  them to be found in the Epic.          6      Reserving hexameter poetry and Comedy for consideration hereafter, let  us proceed now to the discussion of Tragedy; before doing so, however,  we must gather up the definition resulting from what has been said. A  tragedy, then, is the imitation of an action that is serious and also,  as having magnitude, complete in itself; in language with pleasurable  accessories, each kind brought in separately in the parts of the work;  in a dramatic, not in a narrative form; with incidents arousing pity and  fear, wherewith to accomplish its catharsis of such emotions. Here by  'language with pleasurable accessories' I mean that with rhythm and  harmony or song superadded; and by 'the kinds separately' I mean that  some portions are worked out with verse only, and others in turn with  song.    I. As they act the stories, it follows that in the first place the  Spectacle (or stage-appearance of the actors) must be some part of the  whole; and in the second Melody and Diction, these two being the  means of their imitation. Here by 'Diction' I mean merely this, the  composition of the verses; and by 'Melody', what is too completely  understood to require explanation. But further: the subject represented  also is an action; and the action involves agents, who must necessarily  have their distinctive qualities both of character and thought, since it  is from these that we ascribe certain qualities to their actions. There  are in the natural order of things, therefore, two causes, Character and  Thought, of their actions, and consequently of their success or failure  in their lives. Now the action (that which was done) is represented in  the play by the Fable or Plot. The Fable, in our present sense of the  term, is simply this, the combination of the incidents, or things done  in the story; whereas Character is what makes us ascribe certain moral  qualities to the agents; and Thought is shown in all they say when  proving a particular point or, it may be, enunciating a general truth.  There are six parts consequently of every tragedy, as a whole, that  is, of such or such quality, viz. a Fable or Plot, Characters, Diction,  Thought, Spectacle and Melody; two of them arising from the means, one  from the manner, and three from the objects of the dramatic imitation;  and there is nothing else besides these six. Of these, its formative  elements, then, not a few of the dramatists have made due use, as every  play, one may say, admits of Spectacle, Character, Fable, Diction,  Melody, and Thought.    II. The most important of the six is the combination of the incidents of  the story.    Tragedy is essentially an imitation not of persons but of action and  life, of happiness and misery. All human happiness or misery takes the  form of action; the end for which we live is a certain kind of  activity, not a quality. Character gives us qualities, but it is in  our actions--what we do--that we are happy or the reverse. In a play  accordingly they do not act in order to portray the Characters; they  include the Characters for the sake of the action. So that it is the  action in it, i.e. its Fable or Plot, that is the end and purpose of  the tragedy; and the end is everywhere the chief thing. Besides this,  a tragedy is impossible without action, but there may be one without  Character. The tragedies of most of the moderns are characterless--a  defect common among poets of all kinds, and with its counterpart in  painting in Zeuxis as compared with Polygnotus; for whereas the latter  is strong in character, the work of Zeuxis is devoid of it. And again:  one may string together a series of characteristic speeches of the  utmost finish as regards Diction and Thought, and yet fail to produce  the true tragic effect; but one will have much better success with  a tragedy which, however inferior in these respects, has a Plot, a  combination of incidents, in it. And again: the most powerful elements  of attraction in Tragedy, the Peripeties and Discoveries, are parts of  the Plot. A further proof is in the fact that beginners succeed earlier  with the Diction and Characters than with the construction of a  story; and the same may be said of nearly all the early dramatists. We  maintain, therefore, that the first essential, the life and soul, so  to speak, of Tragedy is the Plot; and that the Characters come  second--compare the parallel in painting, where the most beautiful  colours laid on without order will not give one the same pleasure as a  simple black-and-white sketch of a portrait. We maintain that Tragedy is  primarily an imitation of action, and that it is mainly for the sake of  the action that it imitates the personal agents. Third comes the element  of Thought, i.e. the power of saying whatever can be said, or what is  appropriate to the occasion. This is what, in the speeches in Tragedy,  falls under the arts of Politics and Rhetoric; for the older poets  make their personages discourse like statesmen, and the moderns like  rhetoricians. One must not confuse it with Character.

Some of the best superintendents confirm the  first tales of innocence, and Dr. Zachos told me last night that on his  plantation, a sequestered one, \"they had absolutely no vices.\" Nor have  these men of mine yet shown any worth mentioning; since I took command  I have heard of no man intoxicated, and there has been but one small  quarrel. I suppose that scarcely a white regiment in the army shows  so little swearing. Take the \"Progressive Friends\" and put them in red  trousers, and I verily believe they would fill a guard-house sooner  than these men. If camp regulations are violated, it seems to be usually  through heedlessness. They love passionately three things besides their  spiritual incantations; namely, sugar, home, and tobacco. This last  affection brings tears to their eyes, almost, when they speak of their  urgent need of pay; they speak of their last-remembered quid as if it  were some deceased relative, too early lost, and to be mourned forever.  As for sugar, no white man can drink coffee after they have sweetened it  to their liking.    I see that the pride which military life creates may cause the  plantation trickeries to diminish. For instance, these men make the most  admirable sentinels. It is far harder to pass the camp lines at night  than in the camp from which I came; and I have seen none of that  disposition to connive at the offences of members of one's own company  which is so troublesome among white soldiers. Nor are they lazy, either  about work or drill; in all respects they seem better material for  soldiers than I had dared to hope.    There is one company in particular, all Florida men, which I certainly  think the finest-looking company I ever saw, white or black; they range  admirably in size, have remarkable erectness and ease of carriage, and  really march splendidly. Not a visitor but notices them; yet they have  been under drill only a fortnight, and a part only two days. They have  all been slaves, and very few are even mulattoes.      December 4, 1862.    \"Dwelling in tents, with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.\" This condition  is certainly mine,--and with a multitude of patriarchs beside, not to  mention Caesar and Pompey, Hercules and Bacchus.    A moving life, tented at night, this experience has been mine in civil  society, if society be civil before the luxurious forest fires of  Maine and the Adirondack, or upon the lonely prairies of Kansas. But a  stationary tent life, deliberately going to housekeeping under canvas, I  have never had before, though in our barrack life at \"Camp Wool\" I often  wished for it.    The accommodations here are about as liberal as my quarters there,  two wall-tents being placed end to end, for office and bedroom, and  separated at will by a \"fly\" of canvas. There is a good board floor and  mop-board, effectually excluding dampness and draughts, and everything  but sand, which on windy days penetrates everywhere. The office  furniture consists of a good desk or secretary, a very clumsy and  disastrous settee, and a remarkable chair. The desk is a bequest of the  slaveholders, and the settee of the slaves, being ecclesiastical in its  origin, and appertaining to the little old church or \"praise-house,\"  now used for commissary purposes. The chair is a composite structure: I  found a cane seat on a dust-heap, which a black sergeant combined with  two legs from a broken bedstead and two more from an oak-bough. I sit  on it with a pride of conscious invention, mitigated by profound  insecurity. Bedroom furniture, a couch made of gun-boxes covered with  condemned blankets, another settee, two pails, a tin cup, tin basin  (we prize any tin or wooden ware as savages prize iron), and a valise,  regulation size. Seriously considered, nothing more appears needful,  unless ambition might crave another chair for company, and, perhaps,  something for a wash-stand higher than a settee.    To-day it rains hard, and the wind quivers through the closed canvas,  and makes one feel at sea. All the talk of the camp outside is fused  into a cheerful and indistinguishable murmur, pierced through at every  moment by the wail of the hovering plover. Sometimes a face, black or  white, peers through the entrance with some message. Since the light  readily penetrates, though the rain cannot, the tent conveys a feeling  of charmed security, as if an invisible boundary checked the pattering  drops and held the moaning wind. The front tent I share, as yet, with my  adjutant; in the inner apartment I reign supreme, bounded in a nutshell,  with no bad dreams.    In all pleasant weather the outer \"fly\" is open, and men pass and  repass, a chattering throng. I think of Emerson's Saadi, \"As thou  sittest at thy door, on the desert's yellow floor,\"--for these bare  sand-plains, gray above, are always yellow when upturned, and there  seems a tinge of Orientalism in all our life.    Thrice a day we go to the plantation-houses for our meals,  camp-arrangements being yet very imperfect. The officers board in  different messes, the adjutant and I still clinging to the household of  William Washington,--William the quiet and the courteous, the pattern  of house-servants, William the noiseless, the observing, the  discriminating, who knows everything that can be got, and how to cook  it. William and his tidy, lady-like little spouse Hetty--a pair of  wedded lovers, if ever I saw one--set our table in their one room,  half-way between an un glazed window and a large wood-fire, such as is  often welcome. Thanks to the adjutant, we are provided with the social  magnificence of napkins; while (lest pride take too high a flight)  our table-cloth consists of two \"New York Tribunes\" and a \"Leslie's  Pictorial.\" Every steamer brings us a clean table-cloth. Here are we  forever supplied with pork and oysters and sweet potatoes and rice and  hominy and corn-bread and milk; also mysterious griddle-cakes of corn  and pumpkin; also preserves made of pumpkin-chips, and other  fanciful productions of Ethiop art. Mr. E. promised the  plantation-superintendents who should come down here \"all the luxuries  of home,\" and we certainly have much apparent, if little real variety.  Once William produced with some palpitation something fricasseed,  which he boldly termed chicken; it was very small, and seemed in some  undeveloped condition of ante-natal toughness. After the meal he frankly  avowed it for a squirrel.      December 5, 1862.    Give these people their tongues, their feet, and their leisure, and they  are happy. At every twilight the air is full of singing, talking, and  clapping of hands in unison. One of their favorite songs is full of  plaintive cadences; it is not, I think, a Methodist tune, and I wonder  where they obtained a chant of such beauty.     \"I can't stay behind, my Lord, I can't stay behind!    O, my father is gone, my father is gone,    My father is gone into heaven, my Lord!      I can't stay behind!    Dere's room enough, room enough,    Room enough in de heaven for de sojer:      Can't stay behind!\"    It always excites them to have us looking on, yet they sing these songs  at all times and seasons. I have heard this very song dimly droning on  near midnight, and, tracing it into the recesses of a cook-house, have  found an old fellow coiled away among the pots and provisions, chanting  away with his \"Can't stay behind, sinner,\" till I made him leave his  song behind.    This evening, after working themselves up to the highest pitch, a party  suddenly rushed off, got a barrel, and mounted some man upon it, who  said, \"Gib anoder song, boys, and I'se gib you a speech.\" After some  hesitation and sundry shouts of \"Rise de sing, somebody,\" and \"Stan'  up for Jesus, brud-der,\" irreverently put in by the juveniles, they got  upon the John Brown song, always a favorite, adding a jubilant verse  which I had never before heard,--\"We'll beat Beauregard on de clare  battlefield.\" Then came the promised speech, and then no less than seven  other speeches by as many men, on a variety of barrels, each orator  being affectionately tugged to the pedestal and set on end by his  special constituency. Every speech was good, without exception; with the  queerest oddities of phrase and pronunciation, there was an invariable  enthusiasm, a pungency of statement, and an understanding of the points  at issue, which made them all rather thrilling. Those long-winded  slaves in \"Among the Pines\" seemed rather fictitious and literary in  comparison. The most eloquent, perhaps, was Corporal Price Lambkin, just  arrived from Fernandina, who evidently had a previous reputation among  them. His historical references were very interesting. He reminded them  that he had predicted this war ever since Fremont's time, to which  some of the crowd assented; he gave a very intelligent account of that  Presidential campaign, and then described most impressively the secret  anxiety of the slaves in Florida to know all about President Lincoln's  election, and told how they all refused to work on the fourth of March,  expecting their freedom to date from that day. He finally brought out  one of the few really impressive appeals for the American flag that I  have ever heard. \"Our mas'rs dey hab lib under de flag, dey got dere  wealth under it, and ebryting beautiful for dere chilen. Under it dey  hab grind us up, and put us in dere pocket for money. But de fus' minute  dey tink dat ole flag mean freedom for we colored people, dey pull it  right down, and run up de rag ob dere own.\" (Immense applause). \"But  we'll neber desert de ole flag, boys, neber; we hab lib under it for  eighteen hundred sixty-two years, and we'll die for it now.\" With which  overpowering discharge of chronology-at-long-range, this most effective  of stump-speeches closed.
