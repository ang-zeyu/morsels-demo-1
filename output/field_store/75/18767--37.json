There was at the time a poor, weakly soldier of our company whose  wife cooked for our mess.  She was somewhat of a flirt, and rather  fond of admiration.  Sergeant Broderick was attracted to her, and  hung around the mess-house more than the husband fancied; so he  reported the matter to Lieutenant Taylor, who reproved Broderick  for his behavior.  A few days afterward the husband again appealed  to his commanding officer (Taylor), who exclaimed: \"Haven't you got  a musket?  Can't you defend your own family?\"  Very soon after a  shot was heard down by the mess-house, and it transpired that the  husband had actually shot Broderick, inflicting a wound which  proved mortal.  The law and army regulations required that the man  should be sent to the nearest civil court, which was at St.  Augustine; accordingly, the prisoner and necessary witnesses were  sent up by the next monthly steamer.  Among the latter were  lieutenant Taylor and the pilot Ashlock.    After they had been gone about a month, the sentinel on the roof-top  of our quarters reported the smoke of a steamer approaching the bar,  and, as I was acting quartermaster, I took a boat and pulled down to  get the mail.  I reached the log-but in which the pilots lived, and  saw them start with their boat across the bar, board the steamer,  and then return.  Ashlock was at his old post at the steering-oar,  with two ladies, who soon came to the landing, having passed through  a very heavy surf, and I was presented to one as Mrs. Ashlock, and  the other as her sister, a very pretty little Minorcan girl of about  fourteen years of age.  Mrs. Ashlock herself was probably eighteen  or twenty years old, and a very handsome woman.  I was hurriedly  informed that the murder trial was in progress at St. Augustine;  that Ashlock had given his testimony, and had availed himself of the  chance to take a wife to share with him the solitude of his desolate  hut on the beach at Indian River. He had brought ashore his wife,  her sister, and their chests, with the mail, and had orders to  return immediately to the steamer (Gaston or Harney) to bring ashore  some soldiers belonging to another company, E (Braggs), which had  been ordered from St. Augustine to Fort Pierce.  Ashlock left his  wife and her sister standing on the beach near the pilot-hut, and  started back with his whale-boat across the bar.  I also took the  mail and started up to the fort, and had hardly reached the wharf  when I observed another boat following me.  As soon as this reached  the wharf the men reported that Ashlock and all his crew, with the  exception of one man, had been drowned a few minutes after I had  left the beach. They said his surf-boat had reached the steamer, had  taken on board a load of soldiers, some eight or ten, and had  started back through the surf, when on the bar a heavy breaker upset  the boat, and all were lost except the boy who pulled the bow-oar,  who clung to the rope or painter, hauled himself to the upset boat,  held on, drifted with it outside the breakers, and was finally  beached near a mile down the coast. They reported also that the  steamer had got up anchor, run in as close to the bar as she could,  paused awhile, and then had started down the coast.    I instantly took a fresh crew of soldiers and returned to the bar;  there sat poor Mrs. Ashlock on her chest of clothes, a weeping  widow, who had seen her husband perish amid sharks and waves; she  clung to the hope that the steamer had picked him up, but, strange  to say, he could not swim, although he had been employed on the  water all his life.    Her sister was more demonstrative, and wailed as one lost to all  hope and life.  She appealed to us all to do miracles to save the  struggling men in the waves, though two hours had already passed,  and to have gone out then among those heavy breakers, with an  inexperienced crew, would have been worse than suicide.  All I  could do was to reorganize the guard at the beach, take the two  desolate females up to the fort, and give them the use of my own  quarters.  Very soon their anguish was quieted, and they began to  look, for the return of their steamer with Ashlock and his rescued  crew.  The next day I went again to the beach with Lieutenant Ord,  and we found that one or two bodies had been washed ashore, torn  all to pieces by the sharks, which literally swarmed the inlet at  every new tide.  In a few days the weather moderated, and the  steamer returned from the south, but the surf was so high that she  anchored a mile off.  I went out myself, in the whale or surf boat,  over that terrible bar with a crew of soldiers, boarded the  steamer, and learned that none other of Ashlock's crew except the  one before mentioned had been saved; but, on the contrary, the  captain of the steamer had sent one of his own boats to their  rescue, which was likewise upset in the surf, and, out of the three  men in her, one had drifted back outside the breakers, clinging to  the upturned boat, and was picked up.  This sad and fatal  catastrophe made us all afraid of that bar, and in returning to the  shore I adopted the more prudent course of beaching the boat below  the inlet, which insured us a good ducking, but was attended with  less risk to life.    I had to return to the fort and bear to Mrs. Ashlock the absolute  truth, that her husband was lost forever.    Meantime her sister had entirely recovered her equilibrium, and  being the guest of the officers, who were extremely courteous to  her, she did not lament so loudly the calamity that saved them a  long life of banishment on the beach of Indian River.  By the first  opportunity they were sent back to St. Augustine, the possessors of  all of Ashlock's worldly goods and effects, consisting of a good  rifle, several cast-nets, hand-lines, etc., etc., besides some  three hundred dollars in money, which was due him by the  quartermaster for his services as pilot.  I afterward saw these  ladies at St. Augustine, and years afterward the younger one came  to Charleston, South Carolina, the wife of the somewhat famous  Captain Thistle, agent for the United States for live-oak in  Florida, who was noted as the first of the troublesome class of  inventors of modern artillery.  He was the inventor of a gun that  \"did not recoil at all,\" or \"if anything it recoiled a little  forward.\"    One day, in the summer of 1841, the sentinel on the housetop at  Fort Pierce called out, \"Indians!  Indians!\" Everybody sprang to  his gun, the companies formed promptly on the parade-ground, and  soon were reported as approaching the post, from the pine-woods in  rear, four Indians on horseback.  They rode straight up to the  gateway, dismounted, and came in.  They were conducted by the  officer of the day to the commanding officer, Major Childs, who sat  on the porch in front of his own room.  After the usual pause, one  of them, a black man named Joe, who spoke English, said they had  been sent in by Coacoochee (Wild Cat), one of the most noted of the  Seminole chiefs, to see the big chief of the post.  He gradually  unwrapped a piece of paper, which was passed over to Major Childs,  who read it, and it was in the nature of a \"Safe Guard\" for \"Wild  Cat\" to come into Fort Pierce to receive provisions and assistance  while collecting his tribe, with the purpose of emigrating to their  reservation west of Arkansas.  The paper was signed by General  Worth, who had succeeded General Taylor, at Tampa Bay, in command  of all the troops in Florida.  Major Childs inquired, \"Where is  Coacoochee?\" and was answered, \"Close by,\" when Joe explained that  he had been sent in by his chief to see if the paper was all right.  Major Childs said it was \"all right,\" and that Coacoochee ought to  come in himself.  Joe offered to go out and bring him in, when  Major Childs ordered me to take eight or ten mounted men and go out  to escort him in.  Detailing ten men to saddle up, and taking Joe  and one Indian boy along on their own ponies, I started out under  their guidance.    We continued to ride five or six miles, when I began to suspect  treachery, of which I had heard so much in former years, and had  been specially cautioned against by the older officers; but Joe  always answered, \"Only a little way.\"   At last we approached one  of those close hammocks, so well known in Florida, standing like an  island in the interminable pine-forest, with a pond of water near  it.  On its edge I noticed a few Indians loitering, which Joe  pointed out as the place.  Apprehensive of treachery, I halted the  guard, gave orders to the sergeant to watch me closely, and rode  forward alone with the two Indian guides.  As we neared the  hammock, about a dozen Indian warriors rose up and waited for us.  When in their midst I inquired for the chief, Coacoochee.  He  approached my horse and, slapping his breast, said, \"Me  Coacoochee.\"  He was a very handsome young Indian warrior, not more  than twenty-five years old, but in his then dress could hardly be  distinguished from the rest.  I then explained to him, through Joe,  that I had been sent by my \"chief\" to escort him into the fort.  He  wanted me to get down and \"talk\" I told him that I had no \"talk\" in  me, but that, on his reaching the post, he could talk as much as he  pleased with the \"big chief,\" Major Childs.  They all seemed to be  indifferent, and in no hurry; and I noticed that all their guns  were leaning against a tree.  I beckoned to the sergeant, who  advanced rapidly with his escort, and told him to secure the  rifles, which he proceeded to do.  Coacoochee pretended to be very  angry, but I explained to him that his warriors were tired and mine  were not, and that the soldiers would carry the guns on their  horses.  I told him I would provide him a horse to ride, and the  sooner he was ready the better for all.  He then stripped, washed  himself in the pond, and began to dress"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4362"],[0,"Personal Memoirs of P. H. Sheridan, General, United States Army — Complete (#4)"],[1,"John H. King, now  on the retired list, then a captain in the First Infantry, came to  our camp in pursuit of a marauding band of hostile Indians, and I was  enabled to put him also on the trail.  He soon overtook them, and  killing two without loss to himself, the band dispersed like a flock  of quail and left him nothing to follow.  He returned to our camp  shortly after, and the few friendly Indian scouts he had with him  held a grand pow-wow and dance over the scalps of the fallen braves.    Around La Pendencia, as at La Pena, the country abounded in deer,  antelope, wild turkeys, and quail, and we killed enough to supply  abundantly the whole command with the meat portion of the ration.  Some mornings Frankman and I would bring in as many as seven deer,  and our hunting expeditions made me so familiar with the region  between our camp and Fort Duncan, the headquarters of the regiment,  that I was soon enabled to suggest a more direct route of  communication than the circuitous one then traversed, and in  a short time it was established.    Up to this time I had been on detached duty, but soon my own company  was ordered into the field to occupy a position on Turkey Creek,  about ten or twelve miles west of the Nueces River, on the road from  San Antonio to Fort Duncan, and I was required to join the company.  Here constant work and scouting were necessary, as our camp was  specially located with reference to protecting from Indian raids the  road running from San Antonio to Fort Duncan, and on to the interior  of Mexico.  In those days this road was the great line of travel, and  Mexican caravans were frequently passing over it, to and fro, in such  a disorganized condition as often to invite attack from marauding  Comanches and Lipans.  Our time, therefore, was incessantly occupied  in scouting, but our labors were much lightened because they were  directed with intelligence and justice by Captain McLean, whose  agreeable manners and upright methods are still so impressed on my  memory that to this day I look back upon my service with \"D\" Company  of the First Infantry as among those events which I remember with  most pleasure.    In this manner my first summer of active field duty passed rapidly  away, and in the fall my company returned to Fort Duncan to go into  winter quarters.  These quarters, when constructed, consisted of \"A\"  tents pitched under a shed improvised by the company.  With only  these accommodations I at first lived around as best I could until  the command was quartered, and then, requesting a detail of wagons  from the quartermaster, I went out some thirty miles to get poles to  build a more comfortable habitation for myself.  In a few days enough  poles for the construction of a modest residence were secured and  brought in, and then the building of my house began.  First, the  poles were cut the proper length, planted in a trench around four  sides of a square of very small proportions, and secured at the top  by string-pieces stretched from one angle to another, in which  half-notches hack been made at proper intervals to receive the  uprights.  The poles were then made rigid by strips nailed on  half-way to the ground, giving the sides of the structure firmness,  but the interstices were large and frequent; still, with the aid of  some old condemned paulins obtained from the quartermaster, the walls  were covered and the necessity for chinking obviated.  This method of  covering the holes in the side walls also possessed the advantage of  permitting some little light to penetrate to the interior of the  house, and avoided the necessity of constructing a window, for which,  by the way, no glass could have been obtained.  Next a good large  fire-place and chimney were built in one corner by means of stones  and mud, and then the roof was put on--a thatched one of prairie  grass.  The floor was dirt compactly tamped.    My furniture was very primitive: a chair or two, with about the same  number of camp stools, a cot, and a rickety old bureau that I  obtained in some way not now remembered.  My washstand consisted of a  board about three feet long, resting on legs formed by driving sticks  into the ground until they held it at about the proper height from  the floor.  This washstand was the most expensive piece of furniture  I owned, the board having cost me three dollars, and even then I  obtained it as a favor, for lumber on the Rio Grande was so scarce in  those days that to possess even the smallest quantity was to indulge  in great luxury.  Indeed, about all that reached the post was what  came in the shape of bacon boxes, and the boards from these were  reserved for coffins in which to bury our dead.    In this rude habitation I spent a happy winter, and was more  comfortably off than many of the officers, who had built none, but  lived in tents and took the chances of \"Northers.\" During this period  our food was principally the soldier's ration: flour, pickled pork,  nasty bacon--cured in the dust of ground charcoal--and fresh beef, of  which we had a plentiful supply, supplemented with game of various  kinds.  The sugar, coffee, and smaller parts of the ration were good,  but we had no vegetables, and the few jars of preserves and some few  vegetables kept by the sutler were too expensive to be indulged in.  So during all the period I lived at Fort Duncan and its sub-camps,  nearly sixteen months, fresh vegetables were practically  unobtainable.  To prevent scurvy we used the juice of the maguey  plant, called pulque, and to obtain a supply of this anti-scorbutic I  was often detailed to march the company out about forty miles, cut  the plant, load up two or three wagons with the stalks, and carry  them to camp.  Here the juice was extracted by a rude press, and put  in bottles until it fermented and became worse in odor than  sulphureted hydrogen.  At reveille roll-call every morning this  fermented liquor was dealt out to the company, and as it was my duty,  in my capacity of subaltern, to attend these roll-calls and see that  the men took their ration of pulque, I always began the duty by  drinking a cup of the repulsive stuff myself.  Though hard to  swallow, its well-known specific qualities in the prevention and cure  of scurvy were familiar to all, so every man in the command gulped  down his share notwithstanding its vile taste and odor.    Considering our isolation, the winter passed very pleasantly to us  all.  The post was a large one, its officers congenial, and we had  many enjoyable occasions.  Dances, races, and horseback riding filled  in much of the time, and occasional raids from Indians furnished more  serious occupation in the way of a scout now and then.  The proximity  of the Indians at times rendered the surrounding country somewhat  dangerous for individuals or small parties at a distance from the  fort; but few thought the savages would come near, so many risks were  doubtless run by various officers, who carried the familiar  six-shooter as their only weapon while out horseback riding, until  suddenly we were awakened to the dangers we had been incurring.    About mid-winter a party of hostile Lipans made a swoop around and  skirting the garrison, killing a herder--a discharged drummer-boy--in  sight of the flag-staff.  Of course great excitement followed.  Captain J. G. Walker, of the Mounted Rifles, immediately started with  his company in pursuit of the Indians, and I was directed to  accompany the command.  Not far away we found the body of the boy  filled with arrows, and near him the body of a fine looking young  Indian, whom the lad had undoubtedly killed before he was himself  overpowered.  We were not a great distance behind the Indians when  the boy's body was discovered, and having good trailers we gained on  them rapidly, with the prospect of overhauling them, but as soon as  they found we were getting near they headed for the Rio Grande, made  the crossing to the opposite bank, and were in Mexico before we could  overtake them.  When on the other side of the boundary they grew very  brave, daring us to come over to fight them, well aware all the time  that the international line prevented us from continuing the pursuit.  So we had to return to the post without reward for our exertion  except the consciousness of having made the best effort we could to  catch the murderers.  That night, in company with Lieutenant Thomas  G. Williams, I crossed over the river to the Mexican village of  Piedras Negras, and on going to a house where a large baille, or  dance, was going on we found among those present two of the Indians  we had been chasing.  As soon as they saw us they strung their bows  for a fight, and we drew our six-shooters, but the Mexicans quickly  closed in around the Indians and forced them out of the house--or  rude jackal--where the \"ball\" was being held, and they escaped.  We  learned later something about the nature of the fight the drummer had  made, and that his death had cost them dear, for, in addition to the  Indian killed and lying by his side, he had mortally wounded another  and seriously wounded a third, with the three shots that he had  fired.    At this period I took up the notion of making a study of ornithology,  incited to it possibly by the great number of bright-colored birds  that made their winter homes along the Rio Grande, and I spent many a  leisure hour in catching specimens by means of stick traps, with  which I found little difficulty in securing almost every variety of  the feathered tribes.  I made my traps by placing four sticks of a  length suited to the size desired so as to form a square, and  building up on them in log-cabin fashion until the structure came  almost to a point by contraction of the corners.  Then the sticks  were made secure, the trap placed at some secluded spot, and from the  centre to the outside a trench was dug in the ground, and thinly  covered when a depth had been"]]]
