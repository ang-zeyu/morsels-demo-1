In any need you may call upon the  Nymphs, the Ryls, the Knooks and the Fairies, and they will serve you  gladly.  I, the Master Woodsman of the World, have said it, and my Word  is the Law!\"    Claus looked upon Ak with grateful eyes.    \"This will make me mighty among men,\" he replied.  \"Protected by these  kind friends I may be able to make thousands of little children happy.  I will try very hard to do my duty, and I know the Forest people will  give me their sympathy and help.\"    \"We will!\" said the Fairy Queen, earnestly.    \"We will!\" cried the merry Ryls, laughing.    \"We will!\" shouted the crooked Knooks, scowling.    \"We will!\" exclaimed the sweet nymphs, proudly.  But Necile said  nothing.  She only folded Claus in her arms and kissed him tenderly.    \"The world is big,\" continued the boy, turning again to his loyal  friends, \"but men are everywhere.  I shall begin my work near my  friends, so that if I meet with misfortune I can come to the Forest for  counsel or help.\"    With that he gave them all a loving look and turned away.  There was no  need to say good by, by for him the sweet, wild life of the Forest was  over.  He went forth bravely to meet his doom--the doom of the race of  man--the necessity to worry and work.    But Ak, who knew the boy's heart, was merciful and guided his steps.      Coming through Burzee to its eastern edge Claus reached the Laughing  Valley of Hohaho.  On each side were rolling green hills, and a brook  wandered midway between them to wind afar off beyond the valley.  At  his back was the grim Forest; at the far end of the valley a broad  plain.  The eyes of the young man, which had until now reflected his  grave thoughts, became brighter as he stood silent, looking out upon  the Laughing Valley.  Then on a sudden his eyes twinkled, as stars do  on a still night, and grew merry and wide.    For at his feet the cowslips and daisies smiled on him in friendly  regard; the breeze whistled gaily as it passed by and fluttered the  locks on his forehead; the brook laughed joyously as it leaped over the  pebbles and swept around the green curves of its banks; the bees sang  sweet songs as they flew from dandelion to daffodil; the beetles  chirruped happily in the long grass, and the sunbeams glinted  pleasantly over all the scene.    \"Here,\" cried Claus, stretching out his arms as if to embrace the  Valley, \"will I make my home!\"    That was many, many years ago.  It has been his home ever since.  It is  his home now.          MANHOOD        1.  The Laughing Valley    When Claus came the Valley was empty save for the grass, the brook, the  wildflowers, the bees and the butterflies.  If he would make his home  here and live after the fashion of men he must have a house.  This  puzzled him at first, but while he stood smiling in the sunshine he  suddenly found beside him old Nelko, the servant of the Master  Woodsman.  Nelko bore an ax, strong and broad, with blade that gleamed  like burnished silver.  This he placed in the young man's hand, then  disappeared without a word.    Claus understood, and turning to the Forest's edge he selected a number  of fallen tree-trunks, which he began to clear of their dead branches.  He would not cut into a living tree.  His life among the nymphs who  guarded the Forest had taught him that a live tree is sacred, being a  created thing endowed with feeling.  But with the dead and fallen trees  it was different.  They had fulfilled their destiny, as active members  of the Forest community, and now it was fitting that their remains  should minister to the needs of man.    The ax bit deep into the logs at every stroke.  It seemed to have a  force of its own, and Claus had but to swing and guide it.    When shadows began creeping over the green hills to lie in the Valley  overnight, the young man had chopped many logs into equal lengths and  proper shapes for building a house such as he had seen the poorer  classes of men inhabit.  Then, resolving to await another day before he  tried to fit the logs together, Claus ate some of the sweet roots he  well knew how to find, drank deeply from the laughing brook, and lay  down to sleep on the grass, first seeking a spot where no flowers grew,  lest the weight of his body should crush them.    And while he slumbered and breathed in the perfume of the wondrous  Valley the Spirit of Happiness crept into his heart and drove out all  terror and care and misgivings.  Never more would the face of Claus be  clouded with anxieties; never more would the trials of life weigh him  down as with a burden.  The Laughing Valley had claimed him for its own.    Would that we all might live in that delightful place!--but then,  maybe, it would become overcrowded.  For ages it had awaited a tenant.  Was it chance that led young Claus to make his home in this happy vale?  Or may we guess that his thoughtful friends, the immortals, had  directed his steps when he wandered away from Burzee to seek a home in  the great world?    Certain it is that while the moon peered over the hilltop and flooded  with its soft beams the body of the sleeping stranger, the Laughing  Valley was filled with the queer, crooked shapes of the friendly  Knooks.  These people spoke no words, but worked with skill and  swiftness.  The logs Claus had trimmed with his bright ax were carried  to a spot beside the brook and fitted one upon another, and during the  night a strong and roomy dwelling was built.    The birds came sweeping into the Valley at daybreak, and their songs,  so seldom heard in the deep wood, aroused the stranger.  He rubbed the  web of sleep from his eyelids and looked around.  The house met his  gaze.    \"I must thank the Knooks for this,\" said he, gratefully.  Then he  walked to his dwelling and entered at the doorway.  A large room faced  him, having a fireplace at the end and a table and bench in the middle.  Beside the fireplace was a cupboard.  Another doorway was beyond.  Claus entered here, also, and saw a smaller room with a bed against the  wall and a stool set near a small stand.  On the bed were many layers  of dried moss brought from the Forest.    \"Indeed, it is a palace!\" exclaimed the smiling Claus.  \"I must thank  the good Knooks again, for their knowledge of man's needs as well as  for their labors in my behalf.\"    He left his new home with a glad feeling that he was not quite alone in  the world, although he had chosen to abandon his Forest life.  Friendships are not easily broken, and the immortals are everywhere.    Upon reaching the brook he drank of the pure water, and then sat down  on the bank to laugh at the mischievous gambols of the ripples as they  pushed one another against rocks or crowded desperately to see which  should first reach the turn beyond.  And as they raced away he listened  to the song they sang:      \"Rushing, pushing, on we go!    Not a wave may gently flow--      All are too excited.      Ev'ry drop, delighted,    Turns to spray in merry play    As we tumble on our way!\"      Next Claus searched for roots to eat, while the daffodils turned their  little eyes up to him laughingly and lisped their dainty song:      \"Blooming fairly, growing rarely,      Never flowerets were so gay!    Perfume breathing, joy bequeathing,      As our colors we display.\"      It made Claus laugh to hear the little things voice their happiness as  they nodded gracefully on their stems.  But another strain caught his  ear as the sunbeams fell gently across his face and whispered:      \"Here is gladness, that our rays      Warm the valley through the days;    Here is happiness, to give      Comfort unto all who live!\"      \"Yes!\" cried Claus in answer, \"there is happiness and joy in all things  here.  The Laughing Valley is a valley of peace and good-will.\"    He passed the day talking with the ants and beetles and exchanging  jokes with the light-hearted butterflies.  And at night he lay on his  bed of soft moss and slept soundly.    Then came the Fairies, merry but noiseless, bringing skillets and pots  and dishes and pans and all the tools necessary to prepare food and to  comfort a mortal.  With these they filled cupboard and fireplace,  finally placing a stout suit of wool clothing on the stool by the  bedside.    When Claus awoke he rubbed his eyes again, and laughed, and spoke aloud  his thanks to the Fairies and the Master Woodsman who had sent them.  With eager joy he examined all his new possessions, wondering what some  might be used for.  But, in the days when he had clung to the girdle of  the great Ak and visited the cities of men, his eyes had been quick to  note all the manners and customs of the race to which he belonged; so  he guessed from the gifts brought by the Fairies that the Master  expected him hereafter to live in the fashion of his fellow-creatures.    \"Which means that I must plow the earth and plant corn,\" he reflected;  \"so that when winter comes I shall have garnered food in plenty.\"    But, as he stood in the grassy Valley, he saw that to turn up the earth  in furrows would be to destroy hundreds of pretty, helpless flowers, as  well as thousands of the tender blades of grass.  And this he could not  bear to do.    Therefore he stretched out his arms and uttered a peculiar whistle he  had learned in the Forest, afterward crying:    \"Ryls of the Field Flowers--come to me!\"    Instantly a dozen of the queer little Ryls were squatting upon the  ground before him, and they nodded to him in cheerful greeting.    Claus gazed upon them earnestly.    \"Your brothers of the Forest,\" he said, \"I have known and loved many  years.  I shall love you, also, when we have become friends.  To me the  laws of the Ryls, whether those of the Forest or of the field, are  sacred.  I have never wilfully destroyed one of the flowers you tend so  carefully; but I must plant grain to use for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5201"],[0,"Don Juan Tenorio (#4)"],[1,"   Let Avellaneda continue  con la historia de don Luis.            with the story of Don Luis.
