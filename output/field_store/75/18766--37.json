You will then understand something of my electrical powers.\"    They followed him at once, although with unbelieving faces, and on the  way Rob clasped the little machine to his left wrist, so that his coat  sleeve nearly hid it.    When they reached the lawn at the back of the house Rob kissed them all  good-by, much to his sisters' amusement, and turned the indicator of  the little instrument to the word \"up.\"    Immediately he began to rise into the air.    \"Don't worry about me!\" he called down to them.  \"Good-by!\"    Mrs. Joslyn, with a scream of terror, hid her face in her hands.    \"He'll break his neck!\" cried the astounded father, tipping back his  head to look after his departing son.    \"Come back!  Come back!\" shouted the girls to the soaring adventurer.    \"I will--some day!\" was the far-away answer.    Having risen high enough to pass over the tallest tree or steeple, Rob  put the indicator to the east of the compass-dial and at once began  moving rapidly in that direction.    The sensation was delightful.  He rode as gently as a feather floats,  without any exertion at all on his own part; yet he moved so swiftly  that he easily distanced a railway train that was speeding in the same  direction.    \"This is great!\" reflected the youth.  \"Here I am, traveling in fine  style, without a penny to pay any one!  And I've enough food to last me  a month in my coat pocket.  This electricity is the proper stuff, after  all!  And the Demon's a trump, and no mistake.  Whee-ee!  How small  everything looks down below there.  The people are bugs, and the houses  are soap-boxes, and the trees are like clumps of grass.  I seem to be  passing over a town.  Guess I'll drop down a bit, and take in the  sights.\"    He pointed the indicator to the word \"down,\" and at once began dropping  through the air.  He experienced the sensation one feels while  descending in an elevator.  When he reached a point just above the town  he put the indicator to the zero mark and remained stationary, while he  examined the place.  But there was nothing to interest him,  particularly; so after a brief survey he once more ascended and  continued his journey toward the east.    At about two o'clock in the afternoon he reached the city of Boston,  and alighting unobserved in a quiet street he walked around for several  hours enjoying the sights and wondering what people would think of him  if they but knew his remarkable powers.  But as he looked just like any  other boy no one noticed him in any way.    It was nearly evening, and Rob had wandered down by the wharves to look  at the shipping, when his attention was called to an ugly looking bull  dog, which ran toward him and began barking ferociously.    \"Get out!\" said the boy, carelessly, and made a kick at the brute.    The dog uttered a fierce growl and sprang upon him with bared teeth and  flashing red eyes.  Instantly Rob drew the electric tube from his  pocket, pointed it at the dog and pressed the button.  Almost at the  same moment the dog gave a yelp, rolled over once or twice and lay  still.    \"I guess that'll settle him,\" laughed the boy; but just then he heard  an angry shout, and looking around saw a policeman running toward him.    \"Kill me dog, will ye--eh?\" yelled the officer; \"well, I'll just run ye  in for that same, an' ye'll spend the night in the lockup!\" And on he  came, with drawn club in one hand and a big revolver in the other.    \"You'll have to catch me first,\" said Rob, still laughing, and to the  amazement of the policeman he began rising straight into the air.    \"Come down here!  Come down, or I'll shoot!\" shouted the fellow,  flourishing his revolver.    Rob was afraid he would; so, to avoid accidents, he pointed the tube at  him and pressed the button.  The red-whiskered policeman keeled over  quite gracefully and fell across the body of the dog, while Rob  continued to mount upward until he was out of sight of those in the  streets.    \"That was a narrow escape,\" he thought, breathing more freely.  \"I  hated to paralyze that policeman, but he might have sent a bullet after  me.  Anyhow, he'll be all right again in an hour, so I needn't worry.\"    It was beginning to grow dark, and he wondered what he should do next.  Had he possessed any money he would have descended to the town and  taken a bed at a hotel, but he had left home without a single penny.  Fortunately the nights were warm at this season, so he determined to  travel all night, that he might reach by morning some place he had  never before visited.    Cuba had always interested him, and he judged it ought to lie in a  southeasterly direction from Boston.  So he set the indicator to that  point and began gliding swiftly toward the southeast.    He now remembered that it was twenty-four hours since he had eaten the  first electrical tablet.  As he rode through the air he consumed  another.  All hunger at once left him, while he felt the same  invigorating sensations as before.    After a time the moon came out, and Rob amused himself gazing at the  countless stars in the sky and wondering if the Demon was right when he  said the world was the most important of all the planets.    But presently he grew sleepy, and before he realized what was happening  he had fallen into a sound and peaceful slumber, while the indicator  still pointed to the southeast and he continued to move rapidly through  the cool night air.          5.  The Cannibal Island      Doubtless the adventures of the day had tired Rob, for he slept  throughout the night as comfortably as if he had been within his own  room, lying upon his own bed.  When, at last, he opened his eyes and  gazed sleepily about him, he found himself over a great body of water,  moving along with considerable speed.    \"It's the ocean, of course,\" he said to himself.  \"I haven't reached  Cuba yet.\"    It is to be regretted that Rob's knowledge of geography was so  superficial; for, as he had intended to reach Cuba, he should have  taken a course almost southwest from Boston, instead of southeast.  The  sad result of his ignorance you will presently learn, for during the  entire day he continued to travel over a boundless waste of ocean,  without the sight of even an island to cheer him.    The sun shone so hot that he regretted he had not brought an umbrella.  But he wore a wide-brimmed straw hat, which protected him somewhat, and  he finally discovered that by rising to a considerable distance above  the ocean he avoided the reflection of the sun upon the water and also  came with the current of good breeze.    Of course he dared no stop, for there was no place to land; so he  calmly continued his journey.    \"It may be I've missed Cuba,\" he thought; \"but I can not change my  course now, for if I did I might get lost, and never be able to find  land again.  If I keep on as I am I shall be sure to reach land of some  sort, in time, and when I wish to return home I can set the indicator  to the northwest and that will take me directly back to Boston.\"    This was good reasoning, but the rash youth had no idea he was speeding  over the ocean, or that he was destined to arrive shortly at the  barbarous island of Brava, off the coast of Africa.  Yet such was the  case; just as the sun sank over the edge of the waves he saw, to his  great relief, a large island directly in his path.    He dropped to a lower position in the air, and when he judged himself  to be over the center of the island he turned the indicator to zero and  stopped short.    The country was beautifully wooded, while pretty brooks sparkled  through the rich green foliage of the trees.  The island sloped upwards  from the sea-coast in all directions, rising to a hill that was almost  a mountain in the center.  There were two open spaces, one on each side  of the island, and Rob saw that these spaces were occupied by  queer-looking huts built from brushwood and branches of trees.  This  showed that the island was inhabited, but as Rob had no idea what  island it was he wisely determined not to meet the natives until he had  discovered what they were like and whether they were disposed to be  friendly.    So he moved over the hill, the top of which proved to be a flat,  grass-covered plateau about fifty feet in diameter.  Finding it could  not be easily reached from below, on account of its steep sides, and  contained neither men nor animals, he alighted on the hill-top and  touched his feet to the earth for the first time in twenty-four hours.    The ride through the air had not tired him in the least; in fact, he  felt as fresh and vigorous as if he had been resting throughout the  journey.  As he walked upon the soft grass of the plateau he felt  elated, and compared himself to the explorers of ancient days; for it  was evident that civilization had not yet reached this delightful spot.    There was scarcely any twilight in this tropical climate and it grew  dark quickly.  Within a few minutes the entire island, save where he  stood, became dim and indistinct.  He ate his daily tablet, and after  watching the red glow fade in the western sky and the gray shadows of  night settle around him he stretched himself comfortably upon the grass  and went to sleep.    The events of the day must have deepened his slumber, for when he awoke  the sun was shining almost directly over him, showing that the day was  well advanced.  He stood up, rubbed the sleep from his eyes and decided  he would like a drink of water.  From where he stood he could see  several little brooks following winding paths through the forest, so he  settled upon one that seemed farthest from the brushwood villages, and  turning his indicator in that direction soon floated through the air to  a sheltered spot upon the bank.    Kneeling down, he enjoyed a long, refreshing drink of the clear water,  but as he started to regain his feet a coil of rope was suddenly thrown  about him,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43607"],[0,"Builders of United Italy (#4)"],[1," through Europe, the love of glory, a passion for  study, the necessity for preserving my freedom, in order to speak and  write the truth without restraint--all these reasons powerfully warned  me that under a despotic government it is sufficiently difficult even to  live single, and that no one who reflects deeply will either become a  husband or a father; thus I crossed the Arno and arrived at Siena.\"    In Siena he met a company of strongly intellectual people, and from one  of these, a friend who became a close confidant, he gained the idea of  writing a tragedy founded upon the conspiracy of the Pazzi. Here he also  wrote the first two books of an essay upon Tyranny, which was printed  several years later. Thoroughly absorbed in his literary work Alfieri  moved to Florence at the beginning of the winter, and took up his  residence there.    At that time there were living in Florence, under the titles of Count  and Countess of Albany, Charles Edward, \"the Young Pretender\" to the  English throne, and his wife. The latter, who had been Louisa, Princess  of Stolbergh, had been married when nineteen to the Stuart prince, who  was considerably her elder. Charles Edward had an unsavory reputation  and knew more drunk than sober moments. As a result the young Countess,  who was very beautiful and extremely fond of the fine arts and of  society, was the object of much romantic pity. When Alfieri came to  Florence he found the entire city at the feet of the Countess. Every  one condemned the Count's quarrelsome, tyrannical, libertine nature,  every one praised the Countess's sweet and sunny disposition. Friends  offered to introduce Alfieri to the star of Florence, but he declined  on the ground that he always shunned women who were the most beautiful  and most admired. He could not avoid, however, seeing her in the park  and at the theater, and the first sight of her was destined never to be  effaced. Thus he writes of her: \"The first impression she made on me  was infinitely agreeable. Large black eyes full of fire and gentleness,  joined to a fair complexion and flaxen hair, gave to her beauty a  brilliancy difficult to withstand. Twenty-five years of age, possessing  a taste for letters and the fine arts, an amiable character, an immense  fortune, and placed in domestic circumstances of a very painful nature,  how was it possible to escape where so many reasons existed for loving?\"    De Stendhal gives an account of their first meeting, which if inaccurate  (it does not appear in Alfieri's memoirs) is at least characteristic of  the man. According to this story Alfieri was presented to the Countess  in one of the galleries of Florence, and noticed at the time that the  lady was much interested in a portrait on the walls of Charles XII. She  told the poet that she admired the costume exceedingly. Two days later  Alfieri appeared in Florence dressed exactly like the portrait of the  Swedish King, and so presented himself before the Countess. The act was  quite in keeping with the poet's nature.    Alfieri made a determined effort to fight against the passion he had  cause to fear, and made a hurried journey to Rome. He could not stay  there, and returned to Florence, stopping at Siena to see his friend  Gandellini, to whom he spoke of the Countess, and who did not counsel  him against giving way to the fascination.    On his return to Florence he acknowledged that he was deeply in love.  This love, however, he felt ennobled him, and instead of causing him  to give up his work, continually inspired him to new literary heights.  He wrote, \"I soon perceived that the object of my present attachment,  far from impeding my progress in the pursuit of useful knowledge, or  deranging my studies, like the frivolous woman with whom I was formerly  enamoured, urged me on by her example to everything dignified and  praiseworthy. Having once learned to know and appreciate so rare and  valuable a friend, I yielded myself up entirely to her influence.\" From  the commencement of this new affection, the best and most lasting of his  life, date the finest works of his genius.    There had been long delays in settling Alfieri's estate in Piedmont,  and arranging that he might live in Tuscany, but the presence of the  Countess urged him imperatively to remain in Florence. When the business  arrangements were finally at an end he found it would be necessary  for him to curtail his former expensive style of living. This he did,  giving up his horses, all his servants, except a valet and cook, and  most of his personal luxuries. Books were the only expense he indulged  in, he acquired gradually a very large and choice library. He took a  small house, and devoted himself to his dramas, seeing as much as he  could in leisure moments of the beautiful Countess. During these three  quiet years he wrote his tragedies \"Virginia,\" \"Agemennone,\" \"Don  Garzia,\" \"Maria Stuarda,\" and \"Oreste,\" a poem on the death of Duke  Alexander, killed by Lorenzino de' Medici, had rewritten his drama of  \"Filippo,\" and partly prepared the tragedies \"Timoleone,\" \"Ottavia,\"  and \"Rosmunda.\" All of these works are built on the classic Grecian  model, and flame with hatred of tyranny, and burn with civic virtue.  In that they show their kinship to the author's times. De Sanctis,  always a brilliant critic, says: \"The situations that Alfieri has chosen  in his tragedies have a visible relation to the social state, to the  fears, and to the hopes of his own time. It is always resistance to  oppression, of man against man, of people against tyrant.... In the  classicism of Alfieri there is no positive side. It is an ideal Rome and  Greece, outside of time and space, floating in the vague ... which his  contemporaries filled up with their own life.\"    At about the end of the dramatist's third year of residence in Florence,  the ill-treatment of the Countess of Albany by her husband caused her  friends, and chief among them Alfieri, to plan for her release from such  servitude. To this end they secured her entrance first into a convent at  Florence, and then, with the consent of the Grand Duke of Tuscany and  the Count's own brother the Cardinal of York, her removal to Rome. So  afraid were her friends lest the Count should effect a rescue that they  surrounded her carriage with a body of horsemen as she left Florence,  and Alfieri rode on the coach box until she was well on her road.    While the Countess had been in Florence, Alfieri had worked assiduously  there; now that she was gone he found composition impossible, and after  a very short interval went to Naples, planning to wait there until  he should learn what the Countess would do. It was not long before  it became apparent that the courts of Europe had taken up the wife's  cause against her husband. The Pope gave her a pension and approved of  her taking apartments in the house of her brother-in-law. The court of  France gave her the pension which the Count had previously indignantly  declined as being insufficient for his position. Alfieri learned at last  that the Countess was living in entire independence of her husband, and  after a further stay of a month in Naples in order to avoid possible  scandal he moved to Rome, and took up his residence there.    With this new settled existence he began to write again, and produced  at this time \"Saul,\" his fourteenth tragedy, and one of his finest  works. He took infinite pains with all his dramas, planned them again  and again, wrote version after version, and then selected the forms he  preferred after careful judgment, polished them line by line and word  by word until he was satisfied. He wished to try the effect of his  characters upon an audience, and had himself acted, together with some  of his friends, his play of \"Antigone.\" He found he had not mistaken his  ability as a dramatist. At about the same time he published part of his  works, sending four dramas to the printer. Their publication excited  immediate and flattering attention. His life in Rome was the most  delightful he had yet known. His house was a pleasant villa near the  Baths of Diocletian. Here he wrote and studied in the morning. Later in  the day he went for long rides through the neighboring country, and the  evenings he spent with the woman who had become his chief inspiration.    In time, however, the poet's visits to the Countess became the subject  of unfavorable comment, and the Cardinal, her brother-in-law, brought  the matter to the attention of the Papal Court. Realizing the delicacy  of the situation, Alfieri reluctantly decided that he must quit Rome,  and in May, 1783, he set out again as a wanderer, his ambition lost, his  life offering him no further interests.    As in early youth he now took to rapid traveling for solace, carrying on  at the same time a continual correspondence with the Countess. He wrote  a few sonnets, but found that his mind was too unsettled to allow him  to engage in any more lengthy labors. He went to France, and then to  England, and in each country visited scenes which the impetuosity of his  youth had neglected. Horses again made their appeal to him in London,  and he bought fourteen, \"as many horses as he had written tragedies,\"  he states. With these horses he soon returned to Turin, and made a short  visit to his mother, whom he had not seen for a long time. When he left  her he went to Piacenza, and here he heard that the Countess had at last  been released from the restraint under which she had lived at Rome, and  that as her health was delicate she had gone to Baden. He was in two  minds as to his course, the thought of possible calumny to her bade him  refrain from going to Baden at once, and he tried to content himself  in Siena with his old friend Gandellini. The continual interchange of  letters gradually wore away his resolution, and at last the time came  when he could keep from her no longer. August 4, 1784, he set out to  join her "]]]
