Those kind words! The most agreeable sound which ever  meets the ear of sorrowing, grieving childhood.    Example rendered her words efficacious. Day by day there was a manifest  change of deportment towards \"Nig.\" Her speeches often drew merriment  from the children; no one could do more to enliven their favorite  pastimes than Frado. Mary could not endure to see her thus noticed, yet  knew not how to prevent it. She could not influence her schoolmates as  she wished. She had not gained their affections by winning ways and  yielding points of controversy. On the contrary, she was self-willed,  domineering; every day reported \"mad\" by some of her companions. She  availed herself of the only alternative, abuse and taunts, as they  returned from school. This was not satisfactory; she wanted to use  physical force \"to subdue her,\" to \"keep her down.\"    There was, on their way home, a field intersected by a stream over which  a single plank was placed for a crossing. It occurred to Mary that it  would be a punishment to Nig to compel her to cross over; so she dragged  her to the edge, and told her authoritatively to go over. Nig hesitated,  resisted. Mary placed herself behind the child, and, in the struggle to  force her over, lost her footing and plunged into the stream. Some of  the larger scholars being in sight, ran, and thus prevented Mary from  drowning and Frado from falling. Nig scampered home fast as possible,  and Mary went to the nearest house, dripping, to procure a change of  garments. She came loitering home, half crying, exclaiming, \"Nig pushed  me into the stream!\" She then related the particulars. Nig was called  from the kitchen. Mary stood with anger flashing in her eyes. Mr.  Bellmont sat quietly reading his paper. He had witnessed too many of  Miss Mary's outbreaks to be startled. Mrs. Bellmont interrogated Nig.    \"I didn't do it! I didn't do it!\" answered Nig, passionately, and then  related the occurrence truthfully.    The discrepancy greatly enraged Mrs. Bellmont. With loud accusations and  angry gestures she approached the child. Turning to her husband, she  asked,    \"Will you sit still, there, and hear that black nigger call Mary a  liar?\"    \"How do we know but she has told the truth? I shall not punish her,\" he  replied, and left the house, as he usually did when a tempest threatened  to envelop him. No sooner was he out of sight than Mrs. B. and Mary  commenced beating her inhumanly; then propping her mouth open with a  piece of wood, shut her up in a dark room, without any supper. For  employment, while the tempest raged within, Mr. Bellmont went for the  cows, a task belonging to Frado, and thus unintentionally prolonged her  pain. At dark Jack came in, and seeing Mary, accosted her with, \"So you  thought you'd vent your spite on Nig, did you? Why can't you let her  alone? It was good enough for you to get a ducking, only you did not  stay in half long enough.\"    \"Stop!\" said his mother. \"You shall never talk so before me. You would  have that little nigger trample on Mary, would you? She came home with a  lie; it made Mary's story false.\"    \"What was Mary's story?\" asked Jack.    It was related.    \"Now,\" said Jack, sallying into a chair, \"the school-children happened  to see it all, and they tell the same story Nig does. Which is most  likely to be true, what a dozen agree they saw, or the contrary?\"    \"It is very strange you will believe what others say against your  sister,\" retorted his mother, with flashing eye. \"I think it is time  your father subdued you.\"    \"Father is a sensible man,\" argued Jack. \"He would not wrong a dog.  Where IS Frado?\" he continued.    \"Mother gave her a good whipping and shut her up,\" replied Mary.    Just then Mr. Bellmont entered, and asked if Frado was \"shut up yet.\"    The knowledge of her innocence, the perfidy of his sister, worked  fearfully on Jack. He bounded from his chair, searched every room till  he found the child; her mouth wedged apart, her face swollen, and full  of pain.    How Jack pitied her! He relieved her jaws, brought her some supper, took  her to her room, comforted her as well as he knew how, sat by her till  she fell asleep, and then left for the sitting room. As he passed his  mother, he remarked, \"If that was the way Frado was to be treated, he  hoped she would never wake again!\" He then imparted her situation to his  father, who seemed untouched, till a glance at Jack exposed a tearful  eye. Jack went early to her next morning. She awoke sad, but refreshed.  After breakfast Jack took her with him to the field, and kept her  through the day. But it could not be so generally. She must return to  school, to her household duties. He resolved to do what he could to  protect her from Mary and his mother. He bought her a dog, which became  a great favorite with both. The invalid, Jane, would gladly befriend  her; but she had not the strength to brave the iron will of her mother.  Kind words and affectionate glances were the only expressions of  sympathy she could safely indulge in. The men employed on the farm were  always glad to hear her prattle; she was a great favorite with them.  Mrs. Bellmont allowed them the privilege of talking with her in the  kitchen. She did not fear but she should have ample opportunity of  subduing her when they were away. Three months of schooling, summer and  winter, she enjoyed for three years. Her winter over-dress was a  cast-off overcoat, once worn by Jack, and a sun-bonnet. It was a source  of great merriment to the scholars, but Nig's retorts were so mirthful,  and their satisfaction so evident in attributing the selection to \"Old  Granny Bellmont,\" that it was not painful to Nig or pleasurable to Mary.  Her jollity was not to be quenched by whipping or scolding. In Mrs.  Bellmont's presence she was under restraint; but in the kitchen, and  among her schoolmates, the pent up fires burst forth. She was ever at  some sly prank when unseen by her teacher, in school hours; not  unfrequently some outburst of merriment, of which she was the original,  was charged upon some innocent mate, and punishment inflicted which she  merited. They enjoyed her antics so fully that any of them would suffer  wrongfully to keep open the avenues of mirth. She would venture far  beyond propriety, thus shielded and countenanced.    The teacher's desk was supplied with drawers, in which were stored his  books and other et ceteras of the profession. The children observed Nig  very busy there one morning before school, as they flitted in  occasionally from their play outside. The master came; called the  children to order; opened a drawer to take the book the occasion  required; when out poured a volume of smoke. \"Fire! fire!\" screamed he,  at the top of his voice. By this time he had become sufficiently  acquainted with the peculiar odor, to know he was imposed upon. The  scholars shouted with laughter to see the terror of the dupe, who,  feeling abashed at the needless fright, made no very strict  investigation, and Nig once more escaped punishment. She had provided  herself with cigars, and puffing, puffing away at the crack of the  drawer, had filled it with smoke, and then closed it tightly to deceive  the teacher, and amuse the scholars. The interim of terms was filled up  with a variety of duties new and peculiar. At home, no matter how  powerful the heat when sent to rake hay or guard the grazing herd, she  was never permitted to shield her skin from the sun. She was not many  shades darker than Mary now; what a calamity it would be ever to hear  the contrast spoken of. Mrs. Bellmont was determined the sun should have  full power to darken the shade which nature had first bestowed upon her  as best befitting.          CHAPTER IV.    A FRIEND FOR NIG.        \"Hours of my youth! when nurtured in my breast,      To love a stranger, friendship made me blest:--      Friendship, the dear peculiar bond of youth,      When every artless bosom throbs with truth;      Untaught by worldly wisdom how to feign;      And check each impulse with prudential reign;      When all we feel our honest souls disclose--      In love to friends, in open hate to foes;      No varnished tales the lips of youth repeat,      No dear-bought knowledge purchased by deceit.\"        BYRON.        WITH what differing emotions have the denizens of earth awaited the  approach of to-day. Some sufferer has counted the vibrations of the  pendulum impatient for its dawn, who, now that it has arrived, is  anxious for its close. The votary of pleasure, conscious of yesterday's  void, wishes for power to arrest time's haste till a few more hours of  mirth shall be enjoyed. The unfortunate are yet gazing in vain for  goldenedged clouds they fancied would appear in their horizon. The good  man feels that he has accomplished too little for the Master, and sighs  that another day must so soon close. Innocent childhood, weary of its  stay, longs for another morrow; busy manhood cries, hold! hold! and  pursues it to another's dawn. All are dissatisfied. All crave some good  not yet possessed, which time is expected to bring with all its morrows.    Was it strange that, to a disconsolate child, three years should seem a  long, long time? During school time she had rest from Mrs. Bellmont's  tyranny. She was now nine years old; time, her mistress said, such  privileges should cease.    She could now read and spell, and knew the elementary steps in grammar,  arithmetic, and writing. Her education completed, as SHE said, Mrs.  Bellmont felt that her time and person belonged solely to her.

Johnny looked at Mr. Blacksnake and saw that Mr.  Blacksnake didn't look half as big as Johnny had always thought he did.  He made up his mind that as he had found the old log first, he had the  best right to it.    \"I found it first and I'm going to keep it!\" snapped Johnny Chuck,  and with every hair on end and gritting his teeth, he walked straight  towards Mr. Blacksnake.    Now Mr. Blacksnake is a great bluffer, while at heart he is really a  coward. With a fierce hiss he rushed right at Johnny Chuck, expecting  to see him turn tail and run. But Johnny stood his ground and showed all  his sharp teeth. Instead of attacking Johnny, Mr. Blacksnake glided past  him and sneaked away through the grass.    Johnny Chuck chuckled as he crept into the hollow log.    \"Only a coward runs away without fighting,\" he murmured sleepily.          IX. ANOTHER STRANGE CHUCK      Johnny Chuck awoke just as jolly, round, red Mr. Sun pulled his own  nightcap off. At first Johnny couldn't think where he was. He blinked  and blinked. Then he rolled over. \"Ouch!\" cried Johnny Chuck. You see he  was so stiff and sore from his great fight the day before, that it hurt  to roll over. But when he felt the smart of those wounds, he remembered  where he was. He was in the old hollow log that he had found on the edge  of the Green Meadows just before dark. It was the first time that Johnny  had ever slept anywhere, excepting underground, and as he lay blinking  his eyes, it seemed very strange and rather nice, too.    \"Well, well, well! What are you doing here?\" cried a sharp voice.    Johnny Chuck looked towards the open end of the old log. There, peeping  in, was a little face as sharp as the voice.    \"Hello, Chatterer!\" cried Johnny.    \"I say, what are you doing here?\" persisted Chatterer the Red Squirrel,  for it was he.    \"Just waking up,\" replied Johnny, with a grin.    \"It's time,\" replied Chatterer. \"But that isn't telling me what you are  doing so far from home.\"    \"I haven't any home,\" said Johnny, his face growing just a wee bit  wistful.    \"You haven't any home!\" Chatterer's voice sounded as if he didn't think  he had heard aright. \"What have you done with it?\"    \"Given it to Jimmy Skunk,\" replied Johnny Chuck.    Now Chatterer never gives anything to anybody, and how any one could  give away his home was more than he could understand. He stared at  Johnny as if he thought Johnny had gone crazy. Finally he found his  tongue. \"I don't believe it!\" he snapped. \"If Jimmy Skunk has got your  old home, it's because he put you out of it.\"    \"No such thing! I'd like to see Jimmy Skunk or anybody else put me out  of my home!\" Johnny Chuck spoke scornfully. \"I gave it to him because  I didn't want it any longer. I'm going to see the world, and then I'm  going to build me a new home. Everybody else seems to be building new  homes this spring; why shouldn't I?\"    \"I'm not!\" retorted Chatterer. \"I know enough to know when I am well  off.        \"Who has a discontented heart       Is sure to play a sorry part.\"    Johnny Chuck crawled out of the old log and stretched himself somewhat  painfully. \"That may be, but there are different kinds of discontent.         Who never looks for better things       Will live his life in little rings.    Well, I must be moving along, if I am to see the world.\" So Johnny Chuck  bade Chatterer good-by and started on. It was very delightful to wander  over the Green Meadows on such a beautiful spring morning. The violets  and the wind-flowers nodded to him, and the dandelions smiled up at him.  Johnny almost forgot his torn clothes and the bites and scratches of his  great fight with the gray old Chuck the day before. It was fun to just  go where he pleased and not have a care in the world.    He was thinking of this, as he sat up to look over the Green Meadows.  His heart gave a great throb. What was that over near the lone elm-tree?  It was--yes, it certainly was another Chuck! Could it be the old gray  Chuck come back for another fight? A great anger filled the heart of  Johnny Chuck, and he whistled sharply. The strange Chuck didn't answer.  Johnny ground his teeth and started for the lone elm-tree. He would show  this other Chuck who was master of the Green Meadows!          X. WHY JOHNNY CHUCK DIDN'T FIGHT           Anger is an awful thing;       It never stops to reason.       It boils right over all at once,       No matter what the season.    It was so with Johnny Chuck. The minute he caught sight of the strange  Chuck over by the lone elm-tree, anger filled his heart and fairly  boiled over, until he was in a terrible rage. Of course it was foolish,  very foolish indeed. The strange Chuck hadn't said or done anything to  make Johnny Chuck angry, not the least thing in the world, excepting to  come down on to the Green Meadows. Now the Green Meadows are very broad,  and there is room for many Chucks. It was pure selfishness on the part  of Johnny Chuck to want to drive away every other Chuck.    But anger never stops to reason. It didn't now. Johnny Chuck hurried as  fast as his short legs could take him towards the lone elm-tree, and in  his mind was just one thought--to drive that strange Chuck off the Green  Meadows and to punish him so that he never, never would dare even think  of coming back. So great was Johnny's anger that every hair stood on  end, and as he ran he chattered and scolded.    \"I'll fix him! These are my Green Meadows, and no one else has any  business here unless I say so! I'll fix him! I'll fix him!\"    Then Johnny would grind his teeth, and in his eyes was the ugliest look.  He wasn't nice to see, not a bit nice. The Merry Little Breezes of Old  Mother West Wind didn't know what to make of him. Could this be the  Johnny Chuck they had known so long, the good-natured, happy Johnny  Chuck whom everybody loved? They drew away from him, for they didn't  want anything to do with any one in such a frightful temper. But Johnny  Chuck didn't even notice, and if he had he wouldn't have cared. That  is the trouble with anger. It crowds out everything else, when it once  fills the heart.    When Johnny had first seen the stranger, he had thought right away that  it was the old gray Chuck with whom he had had such a terrible fight the  day before and whom he whipped. Perhaps that was one reason for Johnny  Chuck's terrible anger now, for the old gray Chuck had tried to drive  Johnny Chuck off the Green Meadows.    But when he had to stop for breath and sat up to look again, he saw that  it wasn't the old gray Chuck at all. It was a younger Chuck and much  smaller than the old gray Chuck. It was smaller than Johnny himself.    \"He'll be all the easier to whip,\" muttered Johnny, as he started on  again, never once thinking of how unfair it would be to fight with one  smaller than himself. That was because he was so angry. Anger never is  fair.    Pretty soon he reached the lone elm-tree. The stranger wasn't to be  seen! No, Sir, the stranger wasn't anywhere in sight. Johnny Chuck sat  up and looked this way and looked that way, but the stranger was nowhere  in sight.    \"Pooh!\" said Johnny Chuck, \"He's afraid to fight! He's a coward. But  he can't get away from me so easily. He's hiding, and I'll find him and  then---\" Johnny didn't finish, but he ground his teeth, and it wasn't a  pleasant sound to hear.    So Johnny Chuck hunted for the stranger, and the longer he hunted the  angrier he grew. Somehow the stranger managed to keep out of his  sight. He was almost ready to give up, when he almost stumbled over the  stranger, hiding in a little clump of bushes. And then a funny thing  happened. What do you think it was?    Why, all the anger left Johnny Chuck. His hair no longer stood on end.  He didn't know why, but all of a sudden he felt foolish, very foolish  indeed.    \"Who are you?\" he demanded gruffly.    \"I--I'm Polly Chuck,\" replied the stranger, in a small, timid voice.          XI. THE GREATEST THING IN THE WORLD      Johnny Chuck had begun to think about his clothes. Yes, Sir, he spent a  whole lot of time thinking about how he looked and wishing that he had  a handsomer coat. For the first time in all his life he began to envy  Reddy Fox, because of the beautiful red coat of which Reddy is so proud.  It seemed to Johnny that his own coat was so plain and so dull that no  one would look at it twice. Besides, it was torn now, because of the  great fight Johnny had had with the old gray Chuck who came down from  the Old Pasture. Johnny smoothed it down and brushed it carefully and  tried to make himself look as spick and span as he knew how.    \"Oh, dear!\" he sighed. \"I don't see why Old Mother Nature didn't give me  as handsome a coat as she did Reddy Fox. And there are Jimmy Skunk  and Happy Jack the Gray Squirrel and--and--why, almost every one has a  handsomer coat than I have!\" Now this wasn't at all like Johnny Chuck.  First he had been discontented with his house and had given it to Jimmy  Skunk. Now he was discontented with his clothes. What was coming over  Johnny Chuck? He really didn't know himself. At least, he wouldn't have  admitted that he knew. But right down deep in his heart was a great  desire--the desire to have Polly Chuck admire him. Yes, Sir, that is  what it was! And it seemed to him that she would admire him a great deal  more if he wore fine clothes. You see, he hadn't learned yet what Peter  Rabbit had learned a long time ago, which is that         Fine clothes but catch the passing eye;       Fine deeds win love from low and high.    So Johnny Chuck wished and wished that he had a handsome suit, but as he  didn't, and no amount of wishing would bring him one, he just made the  one he did have look as good as he could, and then went in search of  Polly Chuck.    Sometimes she would not notice him at all. Sometimes he would find her  shyly peeping at him from behind a clump "]]]
