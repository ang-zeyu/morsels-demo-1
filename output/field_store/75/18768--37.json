[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4363"],[0,"Beyond Good and Evil (#4)"],[1," perhaps just dawning on five or six minds that natural  philosophy is only a world-exposition and world-arrangement (according  to us, if I may say so!) and NOT a world-explanation; but in so far as  it is based on belief in the senses, it is regarded as more, and for a  long time to come must be regarded as more--namely, as an explanation.  It has eyes and fingers of its own, it has ocular evidence and  palpableness of its own: this operates fascinatingly, persuasively, and  CONVINCINGLY upon an age with fundamentally plebeian tastes--in fact, it  follows instinctively the canon of truth of eternal popular sensualism.  What is clear, what is \"explained\"? Only that which can be seen and  felt--one must pursue every problem thus far. Obversely, however, the  charm of the Platonic mode of thought, which was an ARISTOCRATIC mode,  consisted precisely in RESISTANCE to obvious sense-evidence--perhaps  among men who enjoyed even stronger and more fastidious senses than our  contemporaries, but who knew how to find a higher triumph in remaining  masters of them: and this by means of pale, cold, grey conceptional  networks which they threw over the motley whirl of the senses--the  mob of the senses, as Plato said. In this overcoming of the world, and  interpreting of the world in the manner of Plato, there was an ENJOYMENT  different from that which the physicists of today offer us--and likewise  the Darwinists and anti-teleologists among the physiological workers,  with their principle of the \"smallest possible effort,\" and the greatest  possible blunder. \"Where there is nothing more to see or to grasp, there  is also nothing more for men to do\"--that is certainly an imperative  different from the Platonic one, but it may notwithstanding be the right  imperative for a hardy, laborious race of machinists and bridge-builders  of the future, who have nothing but ROUGH work to perform.    15. To study physiology with a clear conscience, one must insist on  the fact that the sense-organs are not phenomena in the sense of the  idealistic philosophy; as such they certainly could not be causes!  Sensualism, therefore, at least as regulative hypothesis, if not as  heuristic principle. What? And others say even that the external world  is the work of our organs? But then our body, as a part of this external  world, would be the work of our organs! But then our organs themselves  would be the work of our organs! It seems to me that this is a  complete REDUCTIO AD ABSURDUM, if the conception CAUSA SUI is something  fundamentally absurd. Consequently, the external world is NOT the work  of our organs--?    16. There are still harmless self-observers who believe that there are  \"immediate certainties\"; for instance, \"I think,\" or as the superstition  of Schopenhauer puts it, \"I will\"; as though cognition here got hold  of its object purely and simply as \"the thing in itself,\" without any  falsification taking place either on the part of the subject or the  object. I would repeat it, however, a hundred times, that \"immediate  certainty,\" as well as \"absolute knowledge\" and the \"thing in itself,\"  involve a CONTRADICTIO IN ADJECTO; we really ought to free ourselves  from the misleading significance of words! The people on their part may  think that cognition is knowing all about things, but the philosopher  must say to himself: \"When I analyze the process that is expressed in  the sentence, 'I think,' I find a whole series of daring assertions, the  argumentative proof of which would be difficult, perhaps impossible:  for instance, that it is _I_ who think, that there must necessarily be  something that thinks, that thinking is an activity and operation on the  part of a being who is thought of as a cause, that there is an 'ego,'  and finally, that it is already determined what is to be designated by  thinking--that I KNOW what thinking is. For if I had not already decided  within myself what it is, by what standard could I determine whether  that which is just happening is not perhaps 'willing' or 'feeling'? In  short, the assertion 'I think,' assumes that I COMPARE my state at the  present moment with other states of myself which I know, in order to  determine what it is; on account of this retrospective connection with  further 'knowledge,' it has, at any rate, no immediate certainty for  me.\"--In place of the \"immediate certainty\" in which the people may  believe in the special case, the philosopher thus finds a series of  metaphysical questions presented to him, veritable conscience questions  of the intellect, to wit: \"Whence did I get the notion of 'thinking'?  Why do I believe in cause and effect? What gives me the right to speak  of an 'ego,' and even of an 'ego' as cause, and finally of an 'ego'  as cause of thought?\" He who ventures to answer these metaphysical  questions at once by an appeal to a sort of INTUITIVE perception, like  the person who says, \"I think, and know that this, at least, is  true, actual, and certain\"--will encounter a smile and two notes of  interrogation in a philosopher nowadays. \"Sir,\" the philosopher will  perhaps give him to understand, \"it is improbable that you are not  mistaken, but why should it be the truth?\"    17. With regard to the superstitions of logicians, I shall never tire  of emphasizing a small, terse fact, which is unwillingly recognized by  these credulous minds--namely, that a thought comes when \"it\" wishes,  and not when \"I\" wish; so that it is a PERVERSION of the facts of the  case to say that the subject \"I\" is the condition of the predicate  \"think.\" ONE thinks; but that this \"one\" is precisely the famous old  \"ego,\" is, to put it mildly, only a supposition, an assertion, and  assuredly not an \"immediate certainty.\" After all, one has even gone too  far with this \"one thinks\"--even the \"one\" contains an INTERPRETATION of  the process, and does not belong to the process itself. One infers here  according to the usual grammatical formula--\"To think is an activity;  every activity requires an agency that is active; consequently\"... It  was pretty much on the same lines that the older atomism sought, besides  the operating \"power,\" the material particle wherein it resides and out  of which it operates--the atom. More rigorous minds, however, learnt at  last to get along without this \"earth-residuum,\" and perhaps some day we  shall accustom ourselves, even from the logician's point of view, to  get along without the little \"one\" (to which the worthy old \"ego\" has  refined itself).    18. It is certainly not the least charm of a theory that it is  refutable; it is precisely thereby that it attracts the more subtle  minds. It seems that the hundred-times-refuted theory of the \"free will\"  owes its persistence to this charm alone; some one is always appearing  who feels himself strong enough to refute it.    19. Philosophers are accustomed to speak of the will as though it were  the best-known thing in the world; indeed, Schopenhauer has given us  to understand that the will alone is really known to us, absolutely and  completely known, without deduction or addition. But it again and  again seems to me that in this case Schopenhauer also only did what  philosophers are in the habit of doing--he seems to have adopted a  POPULAR PREJUDICE and exaggerated it. Willing seems to me to be above  all something COMPLICATED, something that is a unity only in name--and  it is precisely in a name that popular prejudice lurks, which has got  the mastery over the inadequate precautions of philosophers in all ages.  So let us for once be more cautious, let us be \"unphilosophical\": let  us say that in all willing there is firstly a plurality of sensations,  namely, the sensation of the condition \"AWAY FROM WHICH we go,\" the  sensation of the condition \"TOWARDS WHICH we go,\" the sensation of this  \"FROM\" and \"TOWARDS\" itself, and then besides, an accompanying muscular  sensation, which, even without our putting in motion \"arms and legs,\"  commences its action by force of habit, directly we \"will\" anything.  Therefore, just as sensations (and indeed many kinds of sensations) are  to be recognized as ingredients of the will, so, in the second place,  thinking is also to be recognized; in every act of the will there is  a ruling thought;--and let us not imagine it possible to sever this  thought from the \"willing,\" as if the will would then remain over!  In the third place, the will is not only a complex of sensation and  thinking, but it is above all an EMOTION, and in fact the emotion of the  command. That which is termed \"freedom of the will\" is essentially the  emotion of supremacy in respect to him who must obey: \"I am free, 'he'  must obey\"--this consciousness is inherent in every will; and equally  so the straining of the attention, the straight look which fixes itself  exclusively on one thing, the unconditional judgment that \"this and  nothing else is necessary now,\" the inward certainty that obedience  will be rendered--and whatever else pertains to the position of the  commander. A man who WILLS commands something within himself which  renders obedience, or which he believes renders obedience. But now let  us notice what is the strangest thing about the will,--this affair so  extremely complex, for which the people have only one name. Inasmuch as  in the given circumstances we are at the same time the commanding AND  the obeying parties, and as the obeying party we know the sensations of  constraint, impulsion, pressure, resistance, and motion, which usually  commence immediately after the act of will; inasmuch as, on the other  hand, we are accustomed to disregard this duality, and to deceive  ourselves about it by means of the synthetic term \"I\": a whole series  of erroneous conclusions, and consequently of false judgments about the  will itself, has become attached to the act of willing--to such a degree  that he who wills believes firmly that willing SUFFICES for action.  Since in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4367"],[0,"Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant, Complete (#4)"],[1," above all, there were no reporters prying into other  people's private affairs.  Consequently it did not become generally  known that there was a vacancy at West Point from our district until I  was appointed.  I presume Mrs. Bailey confided to my mother the fact  that Bartlett had been dismissed, and that the doctor had forbidden his  son's return home.    The Honorable Thomas L. Hamer, one of the ablest men Ohio ever produced,  was our member of Congress at the time, and had the right of nomination.  He and my father had been members of the same debating society (where  they were generally pitted on opposite sides), and intimate personal  friends from their early manhood up to a few years before.  In politics  they differed. Hamer was a life-long Democrat, while my father was a  Whig. They had a warm discussion, which finally became angry--over some  act of President Jackson, the removal of the deposit of public moneys, I  think--after which they never spoke until after my appointment.  I know  both of them felt badly over this estrangement, and would have been glad  at any time to come to a reconciliation; but neither would make the  advance.  Under these circumstances my father would not write to Hamer  for the appointment, but he wrote to Thomas Morris, United States  Senator from Ohio, informing him that there was a vacancy at West Point  from our district, and that he would be glad if I could be appointed to  fill it.  This letter, I presume, was turned over to Mr. Hamer, and, as  there was no other applicant, he cheerfully appointed me.  This healed  the breach between the two, never after reopened.    Besides the argument used by my father in favor of my going to West  Point--that \"he thought I would go\"--there was another very strong  inducement.  I had always a great desire to travel.  I was already the  best travelled boy in Georgetown, except the sons of one man, John  Walker, who had emigrated to Texas with his family, and immigrated back  as soon as he could get the means to do so.  In his short stay in Texas  he acquired a very different opinion of the country from what one would  form going there now.    I had been east to Wheeling, Virginia, and north to the Western Reserve,  in Ohio, west to Louisville, and south to Bourbon County, Kentucky,  besides having driven or ridden pretty much over the whole country  within fifty miles of home.  Going to West Point would give me the  opportunity of visiting the two great cities of the continent,  Philadelphia and New York.  This was enough.  When these places were  visited I would have been glad to have had a steamboat or railroad  collision, or any other accident happen, by which I might have received  a temporary injury sufficient to make me ineligible, for a time, to  enter the Academy.  Nothing of the kind occurred, and I had to face the  music.    Georgetown has a remarkable record for a western village.  It is, and  has been from its earliest existence, a democratic town.  There was  probably no time during the rebellion when, if the opportunity could  have been afforded, it would not have voted for Jefferson Davis for  President of the United States, over Mr. Lincoln, or any other  representative of his party; unless it was immediately after some of  John Morgan's men, in his celebrated raid through Ohio, spent a few  hours in the village.  The rebels helped themselves to whatever they  could find, horses, boots and shoes, especially horses, and many ordered  meals to be prepared for them by the families.  This was no doubt a far  pleasanter duty for some families than it would have been to render a  like service for Union soldiers.  The line between the Rebel and Union  element in Georgetown was so marked that it led to divisions even in the  churches.  There were churches in that part of Ohio where treason was  preached regularly, and where, to secure membership, hostility to the  government, to the war and to the liberation of the slaves, was far more  essential than a belief in the authenticity or credibility of the Bible.  There were men in Georgetown who filled all the requirements for  membership in these churches.    Yet this far-off western village, with a population, including old and  young, male and female, of about one thousand--about enough for the  organization of a single regiment if all had been men capable of bearing  arms--furnished the Union army four general officers and one colonel,  West Point graduates, and nine generals and field officers of  Volunteers, that I can think of. Of the graduates from West Point, all  had citizenship elsewhere at the breaking out of the rebellion, except  possibly General A. V. Kautz, who had remained in the army from his  graduation.  Two of the colonels also entered the service from other  localities.  The other seven, General McGroierty, Colonels White, Fyffe,  Loudon and Marshall, Majors King and Bailey, were all residents of  Georgetown when the war broke out, and all of them, who were alive at  the close, returned there.  Major Bailey was the cadet who had preceded  me at West Point.  He was killed in West Virginia, in his first  engagement.  As far as I know, every boy who has entered West Point from  that village since my time has been graduated.    I took passage on a steamer at Ripley, Ohio, for Pittsburg, about the  middle of May, 1839.  Western boats at that day did not make regular  trips at stated times, but would stop anywhere, and for any length of  time, for passengers or freight.  I have myself been detained two or  three days at a place after steam was up, the gang planks, all but one,  drawn in, and after the time advertised for starting had expired.  On  this occasion we had no vexatious delays, and in about three days  Pittsburg was reached.  From Pittsburg I chose passage by the canal to  Harrisburg, rather than by the more expeditious stage.  This gave a  better opportunity of enjoying the fine scenery of Western Pennsylvania,  and I had rather a dread of reaching my destination at all.  At that  time the canal was much patronized by travellers, and, with the  comfortable packets of the period, no mode of conveyance could be more  pleasant, when time was not an object.  From Harrisburg to Philadelphia  there was a railroad, the first I had ever seen, except the one on which  I had just crossed the summit of the Alleghany Mountains, and over which  canal boats were transported.  In travelling by the road from  Harrisburg, I thought the perfection of rapid transit had been reached.  We travelled at least eighteen miles an hour, when at full speed, and  made the whole distance averaging probably as much as twelve miles an  hour.  This seemed like annihilating space.  I stopped five days in  Philadelphia, saw about every street in the city, attended the theatre,  visited Girard College (which was then in course of construction), and  got reprimanded from home afterwards, for dallying by the way so long.  My sojourn in New York was shorter, but long enough to enable me to see  the city very well.  I reported at West Point on the 30th or 31st of  May, and about two weeks later passed my examination for admission,  without difficulty, very much to my surprise.    A military life had no charms for me, and I had not the faintest idea of  staying in the army even if I should be graduated, which I did not  expect.  The encampment which preceded the commencement of academic  studies was very wearisome and uninteresting.  When the 28th of August  came--the date for breaking up camp and going into barracks--I felt as  though I had been at West Point always, and that if I staid to  graduation, I would have to remain always.  I did not take hold of my  studies with avidity, in fact I rarely ever read over a lesson the  second time during my entire cadetship.  I could not sit in my room  doing nothing.  There is a fine library connected with the Academy from  which cadets can get books to read in their quarters.  I devoted more  time to these, than to books relating to the course of studies.  Much of  the time, I am sorry to say, was devoted to novels, but not those of a  trashy sort.  I read all of Bulwer's then published, Cooper's,  Marryat's, Scott's, Washington Irving's works, Lever's, and many others  that I do not now remember.  Mathematics was very easy to me, so that  when January came, I passed the examination, taking a good standing in  that branch.  In French, the only other study at that time in the first  year's course, my standing was very low.  In fact, if the class had been  turned the other end foremost I should have been near head.  I never  succeeded in getting squarely at either end of my class, in any one  study, during the four years.  I came near it in French, artillery,  infantry and cavalry tactics, and conduct.    Early in the session of the Congress which met in December, 1839, a bill  was discussed abolishing the Military Academy.  I saw in this an  honorable way to obtain a discharge, and read the debates with much  interest, but with impatience at the delay in taking action, for I was  selfish enough to favor the bill.  It never passed, and a year later,  although the time hung drearily with me, I would have been sorry to have  seen it succeed.  My idea then was to get through the course, secure a  detail for a few years as assistant professor of mathematics at the  Academy, and afterwards obtain a permanent position as professor in some  respectable college; but circumstances always did shape my course  different from my plans.    At the end of two years the class received the usual furlough, extending  from the close of the June examination to the 28th of August.  This I  enjoyed beyond any other period of my life.  My father had sold out his  business in Georgetown--where my youth had been spent, and to which my  day-dreams carried me back as my future home, if I should ever be able  to retire on a competency.  He had moved to Bethel, only twelve"]]]
