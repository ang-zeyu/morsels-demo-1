That a time would surely come when  men would exclaim that Truth and Light cannot be in Thee, for no  one could have left them in a greater perplexity and mental  suffering than Thou has done, lading them with so many cares and  insoluble problems. Thus, it is Thyself who hast laid the  foundation for the destruction of Thine own kingdom and no one  but Thou is to be blamed for it.    \"'Meantime, every chance of success was offered Thee. There are  three Powers, three unique Forces upon earth, capable of  conquering for ever by charming the conscience of these weak  rebels--men--for their own good; and these Forces are: Miracle,  Mystery and Authority. Thou hast rejected all the three, and thus  wert the first to set them an example. When the terrible and  all-wise spirit placed Thee on a pinnacle of the temple and said unto  Thee, \"If Thou be the son of God, cast Thyself down, for it is  written, He shall give His angels charge concerning Thee: and in  their hands they shall bear Thee up, lest at any time Thou dash  Thy foot against a stone!\"--for thus Thy faith in Thy father  should have been made evident, Thou didst refuse to accept his  suggestion and didst not follow it. Oh, undoubtedly, Thou didst  act in this with all the magnificent pride of a god, but then  men--that weak and rebel race--are they also gods, to understand  Thy refusal? Of course, Thou didst well know that by taking one  single step forward, by making the slightest motion to throw  Thyself down, Thou wouldst have tempted \"the Lord Thy God,\" lost  suddenly all faith in Him, and dashed Thyself to atoms against  that same earth which Thou camest to save, and thus wouldst have  allowed the wise spirit which tempted Thee to triumph and  rejoice. But, then, how many such as Thee are to be found on this  globe, I ask Thee? Couldst Thou ever for a moment imagine that  men would have the same strength to resist such a temptation? Is  human nature calculated to reject miracle, and trust, during the  most terrible moments in life, when the most momentous, painful  and perplexing problems struggle within man's soul, to the free  decisions of his heart for the true solution? Oh, Thou knewest  well that that action of Thine would remain recorded in books for  ages to come, reaching to the confines of the globe, and Thy hope  was, that following Thy example, man would remain true to his  God, without needing any miracle to keep his faith alive! But  Thou knewest not, it seems, that no sooner would man reject  miracle than he would reject God likewise, for he seeketh less  God than \"a sign\" from Him. And thus, as it is beyond the power  of man to remain without miracles, so, rather than live without,  he will create for himself new wonders of his own making; and he  will bow to and worship the soothsayer's miracles, the old  witch's sorcery, were he a rebel, a heretic, and an atheist a  hundred times over. Thy refusal to come down from the cross when  people, mocking and wagging their heads were saying to Thee--\"Save  Thyself if Thou be the son of God, and we will believe in  Thee,\" was due to the same determination--not to enslave man  through miracle, but to obtain faith in Thee freely and apart  from any miraculous influence. Thou thirstest for free and  uninfluenced love, and refuses the passionate adoration of the  slave before a Potency which would have subjected his will once  for ever. Thou judgest of men too highly here, again, for though  rebels they be, they are born slaves and nothing more. Behold,  and judge of them once more, now that fifteen centuries have  elapsed since that moment. Look at them, whom Thou didst try to  elevate unto Thee! I swear man is weaker and lower than Thou hast  ever imagined him to be! Can he ever do that which Thou art said  to have accomplished? By valuing him so highly Thou hast acted as  if there were no love for him in Thine heart, for Thou hast  demanded of him more than he could ever give--Thou, who lovest  him more than Thyself! Hadst Thou esteemed him less, less wouldst  Thou have demanded of him, and that would have been more like  love, for his burden would have been made thereby lighter. Man is  weak and cowardly. What matters it, if he now riots and rebels  throughout the world against our will and power, and prides  himself upon that rebellion? It is but the petty pride and vanity  of a school-boy. It is the rioting of little children, getting up  a mutiny in the class-room and driving their schoolmaster out of  it. But it will not last long, and when the day of their triumph  is over, they will have to pay dearly for it. They will destroy  the temples and raze them to the ground, flooding the earth with  blood. But the foolish children will have to learn some day that,  rebels though they be and riotous from nature, they are too weak  to maintain the spirit of mutiny for any length of time. Suffused  with idiotic tears, they will confess that He who created them  rebellious undoubtedly did so but to mock them. They will  pronounce these words in despair, and such blasphemous utterances  will but add to their misery--for human nature cannot endure  blasphemy, and takes her own revenge in the end.    \"'And thus, after all Thou has suffered for mankind and its  freedom, the present fate of men may be summed up in three words:  Unrest, Confusion, Misery! Thy great prophet John records in his  vision, that he saw, during the first resurrection of the chosen  servants of God--\"the number of them which were sealed\" in their  foreheads, \"twelve thousand\" of every tribe. But were they,  indeed, as many? Then they must have been gods, not men. They had  shared Thy Cross for long years, suffered scores of years' hunger  and thirst in dreary wildernesses and deserts, feeding upon  locusts and roots--and of these children of free love for Thee,  and self-sacrifice in Thy name, Thou mayest well feel proud. But  remember that these are but a few thousands--of gods, not men;  and how about all others? And why should the weakest be held  guilty for not being able to endure what the strongest have  endured? Why should a soul incapable of containing such terrible  gifts be punished for its weakness? Didst Thou really come to,  and for, the \"elect\" alone? If so, then the mystery will remain  for ever mysterious to our finite minds. And if a mystery, then  were we right to proclaim it as one, and preach it, teaching them  that neither their freely given love to Thee nor freedom of  conscience were essential, but only that incomprehensible mystery  which they must blindly obey even against the dictates of their  conscience. Thus did we. We corrected and improved Thy teaching  and based it upon \"Miracle, Mystery, and Authority.\" And men  rejoiced at finding themselves led once more like a herd of  cattle, and at  finding their hearts  at last delivered of the  terrible burden laid upon them by Thee, which caused them so much  suffering. Tell me, were we right in doing as we did. Did not we  show our great love for humanity, by realizing in such a humble  spirit its helplessness, by so mercifully lightening its great  burden, and by permitting and remitting for its weak nature every  sin, provided it be committed with our authorization? For what,  then, hast Thou come again to trouble us in our work? And why  lookest Thou at me so penetratingly with Thy meek eyes, and in  such a silence? Rather shouldst Thou feel wroth, for I need not  Thy love, I reject it, and love Thee not, myself. Why should I  conceal the truth from Thee? I know but too well with whom I am  now talking! What I had to say was known to Thee before, I read  it in Thine eye. How should I conceal from Thee our secret? If  perchance Thou wouldst hear it from my own lips, then listen: We  are not with Thee, but with him, and that is our secret! For  centuries have we abandoned Thee to follow him, yes--eight  centuries. Eight hundred years now since we accepted from him the  gift rejected by Thee with indignation; that last gift which he  offered Thee from the high mountain when, showing all the  kingdoms of the world and the glory of them, he saith unto Thee:  \"All these things will I give Thee, if Thou will fall down and  worship me!\" We took Rome from him and the glaive of Caesar, and  declared ourselves alone the kings of this earth, its sole kings,  though our work is not yet fully accomplished. But who is to  blame for it? Our work is but in its incipient stage, but it is  nevertheless started. We may have long to wait until its  culmination, and mankind have to suffer much, but we shall reach  the goal some day, and become sole Caesars, and then will be the  time to think of universal happiness for men.    \"'Thou couldst accept the glaive of Caesar Thyself; why didst  Thou reject the offer? By accepting from the powerful spirit his  third offer Thou would have realized every aspiration man seeketh  for himself on earth; man would have found a constant object for  worship; one to deliver his conscience up to, and one that should  unite all together into one common and harmonious ant-hill; for  an innate necessity for universal union constitutes the third and  final affliction of mankind. Humanity as a whole has ever aspired  to unite itself universally. Many were, the great nations with  great histories, but the greater they were, the more unhappy they  felt, as they felt the stronger necessity of a universal union  among men. Great conquerors, like Timoor and Tchengis-Khan,  passed like a cyclone upon the face of the earth in their efforts  to conquer the universe, but even they, albeit unconsciously,  expressed the same aspiration towards universal and common union.  In accepting the kingdom of the world and Caesar's purple, one  would found a universal kingdom and secure to mankind eternal  peace.

You see I am not  alarmed; neither in truth ought I to be so. He runs no risk, and  you will soon see the king his uncle appear with him again, and  bring him back safe and sound. For he will have the same advantage  his uncle and I have, of living equally in the sea and upon the  land.' The queen his mother and the princesses his relations  confirmed the same thing; yet all they said had no effect on the  king's fright, from which he could not recover till he saw Prince  Beder appear again before him.    The sea at length became troubled, when immediately King Saleh  arose with the young prince in his arms, and holding him up in the  air, he re-entered at the same window he went out at. The King of  Persia being overjoyed to see Prince Beder again, and astonished  that he was as calm as before he lost sight of him, King Saleh  said, 'Sir, was not your majesty in a great fright, when you first  saw me plunge into the sea with the prince my nephew?'    'Alas! Prince,' answered the King of Persia, 'I cannot express my  concern. I thought him lost from that very moment, and you now  restore life to me by bringing him again.'    'I thought as much,' replied King Saleh, 'though you had not the  least reason to apprehend any danger; for, before I plunged into  the sea with him I pronounced over him certain mysterious words,  which were engraven on the seal of the great Solomon, the son of  David. We do the same to all those children that are born in the  regions at the bottom of the sea, by virtue of which they receive  the same privileges that we have over those people who inhabit the  earth. From what your majesty has observed, you may easily see what  advantage your son Prince Beder has acquired by his birth, for as  long as he lives, and as often as he pleases, he will be at liberty  to plunge into the sea, and traverse the vast empires it contains  in its bosom.'    Having so spoken, King Saleh, who had restored Prince Beder to his  nurse's arms, opened a box he had fetched from his palace in the  little time he had disappeared. It was filled with three hundred  diamonds, as large as pigeons' eggs, a like number of rubies of  extraordinary size, as many emerald wands, each half a foot long,  and thirty strings or necklaces of pearl, consisting each of ten  feet. 'Sir,' said he to the King of Persia, presenting him with  this box, 'when I was first summoned by the queen my sister, I knew  not what part of the earth she was in, or that she had the honour  to be married to so great a monarch. This made us come empty  handed. As we cannot express how much we have been obliged to your  majesty, I beg you to accept this small token of gratitude, in  acknowledgment of the many particular favours you have been pleased  to show her.'    It is impossible to express how greatly the King of Persia was  surprised at the sight of so much riches, enclosed in so little  compass. 'What! Prince,' cried he, 'do you call so inestimable a  present a small token of your gratitude? I declare once more, you  have never been in the least obliged to me, neither the queen your  mother nor you. Madam,' continued he, turning to Gulnare, 'the king  your brother has put me into the greatest confusion; and I would  beg of him to permit me to refuse his present, were I not afraid of  disobliging him; do you therefore endeavour to obtain his leave  that I may be excused accepting it.'    'Sir,' replied King Saleh, 'I am not at all surprised that your  majesty thinks this present so extraordinary. I know you are not  accustomed upon earth to see precious stones of this quality and  quantity: but if you knew, as I do, the mines whence these jewels  were taken, and that it is in my power to form a treasure greater  than those of all the kings of the earth, you would wonder we  should have the boldness to make you a present of so small a value.  I beseech you, therefore, not to regard it in that light, but on  account of the sincere friendship which obliges us to offer it to  you not to give us the mortification of refusing it.' This obliged  the King of Persia to accept the present, for which he returned  many thanks both to King Saleh and the queen his mother.    A few days after, King Saleh gave the King of Persia to understand  that the queen his mother, the princesses his relations and  himself, could have no greater pleasure than to spend their whole  lives at his court; but that having been so long absent from their  own kingdom, where their presence was absolutely necessary, they  begged of him not to take it ill if they took leave of him and  Queen Gulnare. The King of Persia assured them he was very sorry  that it was not in his power to return their visit in their own  dominions; but he added, 'As I am verily persuaded you will not  forget Queen Gulnare, but come and see her now and then, I hope I  shall have the honour to see you again more than once.'    Many tears were shed on both sides upon their separation. King  Saleh departed first; but the queen his mother, and the princesses  his relations, were fain to force themselves in a manner from the  embraces of Queen Gulnare, who could not prevail upon herself to  let them go. This royal company were no sooner out of sight than  the King of Persia said to Queen Gulnare, 'Madam, I should have  looked with suspicion upon the person that had pretended to pass  those off upon me for true wonders, of which I myself have been an  eye-witness from the time I have been honoured with your  illustrious family at my court. But I cannot refuse to believe my  own eyes; and shall remember it as long as I live, and never cease  to bless Heaven for sending you to me, instead of to any other  prince.'                          PRINCE BEDER AND THE PRINCESS GIAUHARA.        Young Prince Beder was brought up and educated in the palace under  the care of the King and Queen of Persia. He gave them great  pleasure as he advanced in years by his agreeable manners, and by  the justness of whatever he said; King Saleh his uncle, the queen  his grandmother, and the princesses his relations, came from time  to time to see him. He was easily taught to read and write, and was  instructed in all the sciences that became a prince of his rank.    When he arrived at the age of fifteen he was very wise and prudent.  The king, who had almost from his cradle discovered in him these  virtues so necessary for a monarch, and who moreover began to  perceive the infirmities of old age coming upon himself every day,  would not wait till death gave him possession of the throne, but  purposed to resign it to him. He had no great difficulty to make  his council consent to it; and the people heard this with so much  the more joy, because they considered Prince Beder worthy to govern  them. They saw that he treated all mankind with that goodness which  invited them to approach him; that he heard favourably all who had  anything to say to him; that he answered everybody with a goodness  that was peculiar to him; and that he refused nobody anything that  had the least appearance of justice.    The day for the ceremony was appointed. In the midst of the whole  assembly, which was larger than usual, the King of Persia, then  sitting on his throne, came down from it, took the crown from off  his head, put it on that of Prince Beder, and having seated him in  his place, kissed his hand, as a token that he resigned his  authority to him. After which he took his place among the crowd of  viziers and emirs below the throne.    Hereupon the viziers, emirs, and other principal officers, came  immediately and threw themselves at the new king's feet, taking  each the oath of fidelity according to their rank. Then the grand  vizier made a report of various important matters, on which the  young king gave judgment with admirable prudence and sagacity that  surprised all the council. He next turned out several governors  convicted of mal-administration, and put others in their place,  with wonderful and just discernment. He at length left the council,  accompanied by the late king his father, and went to see his  mother, Queen Gulnare. The queen no sooner saw him coming with his  crown upon his head, than she ran to him, and embraced him with  tenderness, wishing him a long and prosperous reign.    The first year of his reign King Beder acquitted himself of all his  royal functions with great care. Above all, he took care to inform  himself of the state of his affairs, and all that might in any way  contribute towards the happiness of his people. Next year, having  left the administration to his council, under the direction of the  old king his father, he went out of his capital, under pretext of  diverting himself with hunting; but his real intention was to visit  all the provinces of his kingdom, that he might reform all abuses  there, establish good order and discipline everywhere, and take  from all ill-minded princes, his neighbours, any opportunities of  attempting any thing against the security and tranquillity of his  subjects, by showing himself on his frontiers.    It required no less than a whole year for this young king to carry  out his plans. Soon after his return, the old king his father fell  so dangerously ill that he knew at once he should never recover. He  waited for his last moment with great tranquillity, and his only  care was to recommend the ministers and other lords of his son's  court to remain faithful to him: and there was not one but  willingly renewed his oath as freely as at first. He died, at  length, to the great grief of King Beder and Queen Gulnare, who  caused his corpse to be borne to a stately mausoleum, worthy of his  rank and dignity.    The funeral ended, King Beder found no difficulty in complying with  that ancient custom in Persia to mourn for the dead a whole month,  and not to be seen by anybody during "]]]
