While the Minne-poetry was the tender homage  offered to the beauty, the gentleness, the grace, and charm of noble  women of this world, legendary poetry was the homage given to the Virgin  Mother, the Queen of Heaven, transfiguring earthly love into a heavenly  and eternal love.\"    \"For the twelfth and thirteenth centuries were the time of woman cultus,  such as has never been before or since seen; it is also the time of the  deepest and simplest and truest, most enthusiastic and faithful  veneration of the Virgin Mary. If we, by a certain effort, manage to  place ourselves back on the standpoint of childlike poetic faith of that  time, and set aside in thought the materializing and exaggeration of the  hagiology and Mariolatry produced by later centuries, rendering the  reaction of the Reformation unavoidable--if now in our age, turned  exclusively to logical ideas and a negative dialectic, we live again by  thought in those ages of feeling and poetry--if we acknowledge all these  things to be something more than harmless play of words and fancy, and as  the true lifelike contents of the period, then we can properly appreciate  this legendary poetry as a necessary link in the crown of pearls of our  ancient poetry.\"    In short, the first classical period of German literature was a time of  youthful freshness, of pure harmony, plunged in verse and song, full of  the richest tones and the noblest rhythm, so that rhyme and song alone  must be looked for as the form of poetic creations. Accordingly it had  no proper prose. Like our own youth, it was a happy, free, and true  youth, it knew no prose; like us it dreamed to speechless songs; and as  we expressed our youthful language and hopes, woes and joys, in rhyme and  song, thus a whole people and age had its beautiful youth full of song  and verse tones. The life was poetry and poetry was the life.    Then came degeneracy and artifice; after that the great shock of the  Reformation; subsequently a servile and pedantic study of classical forms  without imbibing their spirit, but preparing the way for a truer art  spirit, extracted from their study by the masterly criticism of  Winckelmann and Lessing, till the second classical period of German  literature and poetry bloomed forth in full beauty, blending the national  and legendary elements so well expressed by Herder with the highest  effusions of dramatic poetry, partly creative and partly imitative of the  Greek models, in Schiller and Goethe.    Modern German literature presents a very remarkable spectacle, though far  from unique in history, for there we see criticism begetting genius.    Lessing, the founder of the modern German drama, sought to banish all  pomp from the theatre, and in doing so some critics have thought that he  banished the ideal and fell into affectation. At any rate, his  \"Dramaturgy\" is full of original ideas, and when he drew out the sphere  of poetry contrasted with that of painting in his \"Laocoon,\" all Germany  resounded with his praise. \"With that delight,\" says Goethe, \"we saluted  this luminous ray which a thinker of the first order caused to break  forth from its clouds. It is necessary to have all the fire of youth to  conceive the effect produced on us by the 'Laocoon' of Lessing.\" Another  great contemporary, whose name is imperishable as that of art, struck a  mortal blow at a false taste in the study of the antique. Winckelmann  questioned the works of the Greek chisel with an intelligence full of  love, and initiated his countrymen into poetry by a feeling for  sculpture! What an enthusiasm he displayed for classical beauty! what a  worship of the form! what a fervor of paganism is found in its eloquent  pages when he also comments on the admirable group of the Laocoon, or the  still purer masterpiece of the Apollo of Belvedere.    These men were the vanguard of the great Germanic army; Schiller and  Goethe alone formed its main column. In them German poetry shows itself  in its perfection, and completely realizes the ideal designed for it by  the critic. Every factitious precept and conventional law was now  overthrown; these poetical Protestants broke away entirely from the yoke  of tradition. Yet their genius was not without a rule. Every work bears  in itself the organic laws of its development. Thus, although they laugh  at the famous precept of the three unities, it is because they dig still  deeper down to the root of things, to grasp the true principle from which  the precept issued. \"Men have not understood,\" said Goethe, \"the basis  of this law. The law of the comprehensive--'das Fassliche'--is the  principle; and the three unities have only value as far as they attain  it. When they become an obstacle to the comprehension it is madness to  wish to observe them. The Greeks themselves, from whom the rule is  derived, did not always follow it. In the 'Phaeton' of Euripides, and in  other pieces, there was change, place; accordingly they prefer to give a  perfect exposition of their subject, rather than blindly respect a law  never very essential in itself. The pieces of Shakspeare violate in the  highest degree the unity of time and of place; but they are full of  comprehensiveness; nothing is easier to grasp, and for that reason they  would have found favor with the Greeks. The French poets tried to obey  exactly the law of the three unities; but they violate the law of  comprehensiveness, as they do not expound dramatic subjects by dramas but  by recitals.\"    Poetical creation was therefore viewed as free, but at the same time  responsible. Immediately, as if fecundity were the reward of  correctness, the German theatre became filled with true and living  characters. The stage widens under their steps that they may have room  to move. History with its great proportions and its terrible lessons, is  now able to take place on the stage. The whole Thirty Years' War passes  before us in \"Wallenstein.\" We hear the tumult of camps, the disorder of  a fanatical and undisciplined army, peasants, recruits, sutlers,  soldiers. The illusion is complete, and enthusiasm breaks out among the  spectators. Similar merits attach to many other of Schiller's plays.    This new drama, which seemed to give all to the natural sphere, concedes  still more to the ideal. An able critic has said the details which are  the truth of history are also its poetry. Here the German school  professes a principle of the highest learning, and one that seems to be  borrowed from its profoundest philosophers; it is that of the universal  beauty of life, of the identity of beauty and existence. \"Our  aesthetics,\" says Goethe, \"speak a great deal of poetical or antipoetical  subjects; fundamentally there is no subject that has not its poetry; it  is for the poet to find it there.\"    Schiller and Goethe divide the empire over modern German poetry, and  represent its two principal powers; the one, Schiller, impassioned and  lyrical, pours his soul over all the subjects he touches; in him every  composition, ode, or drama is always one of his noble ideas, borrowing  its dress and ornament from the external world. He is a poet especially  through the heart, by the force with which he rushes in and carries you  with him. Goethe is especially an epic; no doubt he paints the passions  with admirable truth, but he commands them; like the god of the seas in  Virgil, he raises above the angry waves his calm and sublime forehead.    After this glance at the position and chief characteristics of Schiller,  it may be useful to offer a few remarks on those of the principal works  in this volume, his Aesthetical Letters and Essays. Schiller, in his  Aesthetical Essays, did not choose the pure abstract method of deduction  and conception like Kant, nor the historical like Herder, who strove thus  to account for the genesis of our ideas of beauty and art. He struck out  a middle path, which presents certain deficiencies to the advocates of  either of these two systems. He leans upon Kantian ideas, but without  scholastic constraint. Pure speculation, which seeks to set free the  form from all contents and matter, was remote from his creative genius,  to which the world of matter and sense was no hinderance, but a necessary  envelop for his forms.    His removal to Jena in 1791, and acquaintance with Reinhold, familiarized  him with the Kantian philosophy, but he only appreciated it by halves.  The bare and bald dealing with fundamental principles was at this time  equally repulsive to Goethe and Schiller, the man of the world and the  man of life. But Schiller did not find anywhere at that time justice  done to the dignity of art, or honor to the substantial value of beauty.    The Aesthetical Essays in this volume appeared for the most part since  1792, in the \"Thalia\" and the \"Hours\" periodicals. The first \"On the  Ground of our Pleasure in Tragic Subjects\" (1792), applies Kantian  principles of the sublime to tragedy, and shows Schiller's lofty estimate  of this class of poetry. With Kant he shows that the source of all  pleasure is suitableness; the touching and sublime elicit this feeling,  implying the existence of unsuitableness. In this article he makes the  aim and source of art to consist in giving enjoyment, in pleasing. To  nature pleasure is a mediate object, to art its main object. The same  proposition appears "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/68"],[0,"Warlord of Mars (#4)"],[1,"   As though turned to stone I sat in tense and rigid silence, straining  my eyes into the utter darkness before me in an effort to discover  if the boat were occupied.    It was entirely possible that there might be men on board it  who were still ignorant of my presence, for the boat was scraping  gently against the rocks upon one side, so that the gentle touch  of my boat upon the other easily could have gone unnoticed.    Peer as I would I could not penetrate the darkness, and then I  listened intently for the sound of breathing near me; but except  for the noise of the rapids, the soft scraping of the boats, and the  lapping of the water at their sides I could distinguish no sound.  As usual, I thought rapidly.    A rope lay coiled in the bottom of my own craft.  Very softly I  gathered it up, and making one end fast to the bronze ring in the  prow I stepped gingerly into the boat beside me.  In one hand I  grasped the rope, in the other my keen long-sword.    For a full minute, perhaps, I stood motionless after entering the  strange craft.  It had rocked a trifle beneath my weight, but it  had been the scraping of its side against the side of my own boat  that had seemed most likely to alarm its occupants, if there were  any.    But there was no answering sound, and a moment later I had felt  from stem to stern and found the boat deserted.    Groping with my hands along the face of the rocks to which the  craft was moored, I discovered a narrow ledge which I knew must be  the avenue taken by those who had come before me.  That they could  be none other than Thurid and his party I was convinced by the size  and build of the boat I had found.    Calling to Woola to follow me I stepped out upon the ledge.  The  great, savage brute, agile as a cat, crept after me.    As he passed through the boat that had been occupied by Thurid and  the therns he emitted a single low growl, and when he came beside  me upon the ledge and my hand rested upon his neck I felt his short  mane bristling with anger.  I think he sensed telepathically the  recent presence of an enemy, for I had made no effort to impart to  him the nature of our quest or the status of those we tracked.    This omission I now made haste to correct, and, after the manner  of green Martians with their beasts, I let him know partially by  the weird and uncanny telepathy of Barsoom and partly by word of  mouth that we were upon the trail of those who had recently occupied  the boat through which we had just passed.    A soft purr, like that of a great cat, indicated that Woola  understood, and then, with a word to him to follow, I turned to  the right along the ledge, but scarcely had I done so than I felt  his mighty fangs tugging at my leathern harness.    As I turned to discover the cause of his act he continued to pull  me steadily in the opposite direction, nor would he desist until  I had turned about and indicated that I would follow him voluntarily.    Never had I known him to be in error in a matter of tracking, so  it was with a feeling of entire security that I moved cautiously in  the huge beast's wake.  Through Cimmerian darkness he moved along  the narrow ledge beside the boiling rapids.    As we advanced, the way led from beneath the overhanging cliffs  out into a dim light, and then it was that I saw that the trail  had been cut from the living rock, and that it ran up along the  river's side beyond the rapids.    For hours we followed the dark and gloomy river farther and farther  into the bowels of Mars.  From the direction and distance I knew  that we must be well beneath the Valley Dor, and possibly beneath  the Sea of Omean as well--it could not be much farther now to the  Temple of the Sun.    Even as my mind framed the thought, Woola halted suddenly before a  narrow, arched doorway in the cliff by the trail's side.  Quickly  he crouched back away from the entrance, at the same time turning  his eyes toward me.    Words could not have more plainly told me that danger of some sort  lay near by, and so I pressed quietly forward to his side, and  passing him looked into the aperture at our right.    Before me was a fair-sized chamber that, from its appointments, I  knew must have at one time been a guardroom.  There were racks for  weapons, and slightly raised platforms for the sleeping silks and  furs of the warriors, but now its only occupants were two of the  therns who had been of the party with Thurid and Matai Shang.    The men were in earnest conversation, and from their tones it was  apparent that they were entirely unaware that they had listeners.    \"I tell you,\" one of them was saying, \"I do not trust the black  one.  There was no necessity for leaving us here to guard the way.  Against what, pray, should we guard this long-forgotten, abysmal  path?  It was but a ruse to divide our numbers.    \"He will have Matai Shang leave others elsewhere on some pretext or  other, and then at last he will fall upon us with his confederates  and slay us all.\"    \"I believe you, Lakor,\" replied the other, \"there can never be  aught else than deadly hatred between thern and First Born.  And  what think you of the ridiculous matter of the light?  'Let the  light shine with the intensity of three radium units for fifty  tals, and for one xat let it shine with the intensity of one radium  unit, and then for twenty-five tals with nine units.'  Those were  his very words, and to think that wise old Matai Shang should listen  to such foolishness.\"    \"Indeed, it is silly,\" replied Lakor.  \"It will open nothing other  than the way to a quick death for us all.  He had to make some  answer when Matai Shang asked him flatly what he should do when he  came to the Temple of the Sun, and so he made his answer quickly  from his imagination--I would wager a hekkador's diadem that he  could not now repeat it himself.\"    \"Let us not remain here longer, Lakor,\" spoke the other thern.  \"Perchance if we hasten after them we may come in time to rescue  Matai Shang, and wreak our own vengeance upon the black dator.  What say you?\"    \"Never in a long life,\" answered Lakor, \"have I disobeyed a single  command of the Father of Therns.  I shall stay here until I rot if  he does not return to bid me elsewhere.\"    Lakor's companion shook his head.    \"You are my superior,\" he said; \"I cannot do other than you sanction,  though I still believe that we are foolish to remain.\"    I, too, thought that they were foolish to remain, for I saw from  Woola's actions that the trail led through the room where the two  therns held guard.  I had no reason to harbor any considerable love  for this race of self-deified demons, yet I would have passed them  by were it possible without molesting them.    It was worth trying anyway, for a fight might delay us considerably,  or even put an end entirely to my search--better men than I have  gone down before fighters of meaner ability than that possessed by  the fierce thern warriors.    Signaling Woola to heel I stepped suddenly into the room before the  two men.  At sight of me their long-swords flashed from the harness  at their sides, but I raised my hand in a gesture of restraint.    \"I seek Thurid, the black dator,\" I said.  \"My quarrel is with him,  not with you.  Let me pass then in peace, for if I mistake not he  is as much your enemy as mine, and you can have no cause to protect  him.\"    They lowered their swords and Lakor spoke.    \"I know not whom you may be, with the white skin of a thern and  the black hair of a red man; but were it only Thurid whose safety  were at stake you might pass, and welcome, in so far as we be  concerned.    \"Tell us who you be, and what mission calls you to this unknown  world beneath the Valley Dor, then maybe we can see our way to let  you pass upon the errand which we should like to undertake would  our orders permit.\"    I was surprised that neither of them had recognized me, for I  thought that I was quite sufficiently well known either by personal  experience or reputation to every thern upon Barsoom as to make my  identity immediately apparent in any part of the planet.  In fact,  I was the only white man upon Mars whose hair was black and whose  eyes were gray, with the exception of my son, Carthoris.    To reveal my identity might be to precipitate an attack, for every  thern upon Barsoom knew that to me they owed the fall of their  age-old spiritual supremacy.  On the other hand my reputation as  a fighting man might be sufficient to pass me by these two were  their livers not of the right complexion to welcome a battle to  the death.    To be quite candid I did not attempt to delude myself with any such  sophistry, since I knew well that upon war-like Mars there are few  cowards, and that every man, whether prince, priest, or peasant,  glories in deadly strife.  And so I gripped my long-sword the  tighter as I replied to Lakor.    \"I believe that you will see the wisdom of permitting me to pass  unmolested,\" I said, \"for it would avail you nothing to die uselessly  in the rocky bowels of Barsoom merely to protect a hereditary enemy,  such as Thurid, Dator of the First Born.    \"That you shall die should you elect to oppose me is evidenced by  the moldering corpses of all the many great Barsoomian warriors  who have gone down beneath this blade--I am John Carter, Prince of  Helium.\"    For a moment that name seemed to paralyze the two men; but only  for a moment, and then the younger of them, with a vile name upon  his lips, rushed toward me with ready sword.    He had been standing a little behind his companion, Lakor, during  our parley, and now, ere he could engage me, the older man grasped  his harness and drew him back.    \"Hold!\" commanded Lakor.  \"There will be plenty of time to fight if  we find it wise to fight at all.  There be good reasons why every  thern upon Barsoom should yearn to spill the blood of the blasphemer,  the sacrilegist; but let us mix wisdom with our"]]]
