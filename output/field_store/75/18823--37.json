Edward himself led  the charge on Warwick's centre, and having his best troops under his  command, pressed forward with such force and vehemence that he pierced  Somerset's lines and threw them into confusion.    Just as Warwick's right had outflanked the king's left, so his own  left was outflanked by Gloucester. Warwick's troops fought with great  bravery, and, in spite of the disaster to his centre, were holding their  ground until Oxford, returning from his pursuit of the king's left, came  back through the mist. The king's emblem was a sun, that of Oxford  a star with streaming rays. In the dim light this was mistaken by  Warwick's men for the king's device, and believing that Oxford was far  away on the right, they received him with a discharge of arrows. This  was at once returned, and a conflict took place. At last the mistake was  discovered, but the confusion caused was irreparable. Warwick and  Oxford each suspected the other of treachery, and the king's right still  pressing on, the confusion increased, and the battle, which had been so  nearly won by the Earl, soon became a complete defeat, and by ten in the  morning Warwick's army was in full flight.    Accounts differ as to the strength of the forces engaged, but it is  probable that there was no great inequality, and that each party brought  some fifteen thousand men into the field. The number of slain is also  very uncertain, some historians placing the total at ten thousand,  others as low as one thousand; but from the number of nobles who fell,  the former computation is probably nearest to the truth. Warwick, his  brother Montague, and many other nobles and gentlemen, were killed, the  only great nobles on his side who escaped being the Earls of Somerset  and Oxford; many were also killed on Edward's side, and the slaughter  among the ordinary fighting men was greater than usual.    Hitherto in the battles that had been fought during the civil war; while  the leaders taken on the field were frequently executed, the common  soldiers were permitted to return to their homes, as they had only  been acting under the orders of their feudal superiors, and were not  considered responsible for their acts. At Barnet, however, Edward,  smarting from the humiliation he had suffered by his enforced flight  from England, owing to the whole country declaring for his rival, gave  orders that no quarter was to be granted. It was an anxious day at St.  Albans, where many ladies whose husbands were with Warwick's army had,  like Dame Tresham, taken up their quarters. It was but a few miles from  the field of battle. In the event of victory they could at once join  their husbands, while in case of defeat they could take refuge in the  sanctuary of the abbey. Messengers the night before had brought the news  that the battle would begin at the dawn of day, and with intense anxiety  they waited for the news.    Dame Tresham and her son attended early mass at the abbey, and had  returned to their lodgings, when Sir Thomas rode up at full speed.  His armour was dinted and his plume shorn away from his helmet. As he  entered the house he was met by his wife, who had run downstairs as she  heard his horse stop at the door. A glance at his face was sufficient to  tell the news.    \"We have lost the day,\" he said. \"Warwick and Montague are both killed.  All is lost here for the present. Which will you do, my love, ride with  me to the West, where Queen Margaret will speedily land, if indeed she  has not landed already, or take sanctuary here with the boy?\"    \"I will go with you,\" she said. \"I would vastly rather do so.\"    \"I will tell you more on the road,\" he said. \"There is no time to be  lost now.\"    The woman of the house was called, and at once set her son to saddle  the other horse and to give a feed to that of the knight. Dame Tresham  busied herself with packing the saddlebags while her husband partook of  a hasty meal; and ten minutes after his arrival they set off, Gervaise  riding behind his father, while the latter led the horse on which his  wife was mounted. A thick mist hung over the country.    \"This mist told against us in the battle, wife, for as we advanced our  forces fell into confusion, and more than once friend attacked friend,  believing that he was an enemy. However, it has proved an advantage to  us now, for it has enabled great numbers to escape who might otherwise  have been followed and cut down. I was very fortunate. I had left my  horse at a little farmhouse two miles in the rear of our camp, and in  the fog had but small hope of finding it; but soon after leaving the  battlefield, I came upon a rustic hurrying in the same direction as  myself, and upon questioning him it turned out that he was a hand on  the very farm at which I had left the horse. He had, with two or three  others, stolen out after midnight to see the battle, and was now making  his way home again, having seen indeed but little, but having learned  from fugitives that we had been defeated. He guided me to the farmhouse,  which otherwise I should assuredly never have reached. His master was  favourable to our party, and let the man take one of the cart horses, on  which he rode as my guide until he had placed me upon the high road to  St. Albans, and I was then able to gallop on at full speed.\"    \"And Warwick and his brother Montague are both killed?\"    \"Both. The great Earl will make and unmake no more kings. He has been a  curse to England, with his boundless ambition, his vast possessions, and  his readiness to change sides and to embroil the country in civil war  for purely personal ends. The great nobles are a curse to the  country, wife. They are, it is true, a check upon kingly ill doing and  oppression; but were they, with their great arrays of retainers and  feudal followers, out of the way, methinks that the citizens and yeomen  would be able to hold their own against any king.\"    \"Was the battle a hard fought one?\"    \"I know but little of what passed, except near the standard of Warwick  himself. There the fighting was fierce indeed, for it was against the  Earl that the king finally directed his chief onslaught. Doubtless he  was actuated both by a deep personal resentment against the Earl for the  part he had played and the humiliation he had inflicted upon him, and  also by the knowledge that a defeat of Warwick personally would be the  heaviest blow that he could inflict upon the cause of Lancaster.\"    \"Then do you think the cause is lost?\"    \"I say not that. Pembroke has a strong force in Wales, and if the West  rises, and Queen Margaret on landing can join him, we may yet prevail;  but I fear that the news of the field of Barnet will deter many from  joining us. Men may risk lands and lives for a cause which seems to  offer a fair prospect of success, but they can hardly be blamed for  holding back when they see that the chances are all against them.  Moreover, as a Frenchwoman, it cannot be denied that Margaret has never  been popular in England, and her arrival here, aided by French gold and  surrounded by Frenchmen, will tell against her with the country people.  I went as far as I could on the day before I left Amboise, urging her on  no account to come hither until matters were settled. It would have been  infinitely better had the young prince come alone, and landed in the  West without a single follower. The people would have admired his trust  in them, and would, I am sure, have gathered strongly round his banner.  However, we must still hope for the best. Fortune was against us today:  it may be with us next time we give battle. And with parties so equally  divided throughout the country a signal victory would bring such vast  numbers to our banners that Edward would again find it necessary to  cross the seas.\"        CHAPTER II THE BATTLE OF TEWKESBURY      Riding fast, Sir Thomas Tresham crossed the Thames at Reading before any  news of the battle of Barnet had arrived there. On the third day after  leaving St. Albans he reached Westbury, and there heard that the news  had been received of the queen's landing at Plymouth on the very day on  which her friends had been defeated at Barnet, and that she had already  been joined by the Duke of Somerset, the Earl of Devon, and others, and  that Exeter had been named as the point of rendezvous for her friends.  As the Lancastrians were in the majority in Wiltshire and Somerset,  there was no longer any fear of arrest by partisans of York, and after  resting for a day Sir Thomas Tresham rode quietly on to Exeter, where  the queen had already arrived.    The battle of Barnet had not, in reality, greatly weakened the  Lancastrian cause. The Earl of Warwick was so detested by the adherents  of the Red Rose that comparatively few of them had joined him, and the  fight was rather between the two sections of Yorkists than between York  and Lancaster. The Earl's death had broken up his party, and York and  Lancaster were now face to face with each other, without his disturbing  influence on either side. Among those who had joined the queen was  Tresham's great friend, the Grand Prior of St. John's. Sir Thomas took  up his lodgings in the house where he had established himself. The queen  was greatly pleased at the arrival of Dame Tresham, and at her earnest  request the latter shared her apartments, while Gervaise remained with  his father.    \"So this is the young Knight of St. John,\" the prior said, on the  evening of the arrival of Sir Thomas. \"I would, Tresham, that I were at  present at Rhodes, doing battle with the infidels, rather than engaged  in this warfare against Englishmen and fellow Christians.\"    \"I can well understand that,\" Sir Thomas said.    \"I could not hold aloof here, Tresham.

We noticed the marked  resemblance between you and Mabel, and when you told us your name was  Allison we all felt that you might be Mabel's mother. Do you feel strong  enough to hear our story and to tell us yours?\"    \"Tell me quickly,\" exclaimed Mrs. Allison eagerly, recovering in a  measure from her violent agitation. \"I must know the truth. It seems  incredible that I should find my lost baby girl alive and in good hands.  I am surely dreaming. It cannot be true. Yet she has the same sweet,  serious expression in her brown eyes that she had in babyhood. Even her  middle name, Isabel, that her father insisted upon giving her because it  is mine!\"    Anne, dreading another outbreak, gently interposed. \"Try and be calm,  Mrs. Allison, while we tell you about Mabel.\"    Then Anne began with the winning of the freshman prize by Mabel at the  close of her freshman year, and the interest she had aroused in the girl  chums, and followed with the story of her adoption by the Phi Sigma Tau.    Mrs. Allison listened in rapt attention until Anne had finished. \"God is  good,\" she murmured. \"A higher power surely willed that Mabel should  find true and worthy friends.\"    Then she began questioning Mabel about her life in the orphanage. Did  Mabel have any recollection of the day she was brought there? Had Mary  Stevens, the attendant, ever described the clothing that she had worn  when found?    \"I have the baby pins I wore with me. Jessica asked me to wear them  to-day,\" replied Mabel, who looked like a person just awakened from a  deep sleep. She had not yet reached a full comprehension of what it all  meant.    \"Let me see them,\" cried Mrs. Allison.    Mabel mechanically detached one of the little gold pins from her collar  and handed it to Mrs. Allison, who examined it closely for a moment,  then dropping it with a little cry, again clasped Mabel in her arms.    \"They are the pins I had specially made and engraved for you,\" she said.  \"There is no longer any doubt. You are my lost child.\"    At these words a light of complete understanding seemed to dawn upon  Mabel, and with a cry of rapture she wound her arms about her mother's  neck.    It was a joyful, though rather a trying moment for the four chums, who  were seized with a hysterical desire to laugh and cry in the same  breath. Grace made a slight motion toward the door, which her friends  were not slow to comprehend. It was her intention to slip quietly away  and leave the mother and daughter alone with their new-found happiness.    Before she could put her plan into execution, however, Mrs. Allison  divined her intention and turning quickly toward her, said, \"Don't go,  Grace. I feel as though you girls belonged to me, too. Besides, you have  not heard my part of this story yet.\"    \"Perhaps you are hardly strong enough to tell us after so much  excitement,\" deprecated Grace.    \"My dear, I feel as though I had just begun to live,\" answered Mrs.  Allison. \"The past has been one long dreary blank. If you only knew the  years of agony I have passed through. When you hear my story you will  understand why this reunion is little short of miraculous.    \"My home is in Denver. Mabel was born there,\" continued Mrs. Allison.  \"Fourteen years ago this summer my husband and I decided to spend the  summer in Europe, taking with us our baby daughter, Mabel, and her  nurse.    \"On the morning that we were to sail, circumstances arose that made it  necessary for my husband and myself to be in New York until almost  sailing time. He therefore sent the nurse, a French woman, who was  thoroughly familiar with the city, on ahead to the vessel, with Mabel in  her care. We had barely time to catch the boat and were met by the  nurse, who said that she had left Mabel asleep in one of the state rooms  engaged for us. It was not until we had put out to sea that we  discovered that Mabel was missing, and a thorough search of the ship was  at once made. The nurse persisted in her statement that Mabel went  aboard with her. Every nook and cranny of the ship was overhauled, but  my child could not be found, and the supposition was that she had in  some way fallen overboard.    \"I was distracted with grief, and nearly lost my reason, and when we  reached the other side I passed into a long illness. It was many weeks  before I returned to consciousness of my affairs, and the terrible  realization that my baby was gone forever. I felt as though I could not  face the future without her. I had scarcely recovered from the first  shock attending my great loss, when my husband contracted typhoid fever  and died after an illness of five weeks.    \"We were in Florence, Italy, at the time and I prayed that I might die,  too. It was during those dark hours that Mrs. Gibson proved her  friendship for me. She sailed for Italy the instant she received the  cablegram announcing my husband's death, and brought me back to America  with her. I spent a year with her in her New York home, before returning  to Denver. Since then I have never been east until this summer.    \"Four months ago I received a letter from the nurse who had charge of  Mabel on the day of her disappearance. It was a great surprise to me, as  she had left us directly after we landed with the intention of returning  to France. But the news the letter contained was a far greater surprise,  for she stated that Mabel had never gone aboard the vessel.    \"The nurse had had some personal business to attend to before going  aboard, and in order to save time had taken Mabel with her. In some  inexplicable manner Mabel had strayed from her side. She had made  frantic search for the child and finally, not daring to go to us with  the truth, had conceived the idea of making us believe that she had  taken Mabel aboard the ship. She had bribed the purser, a Frenchman whom  she knew, to corroborate her story, and had succeeded in her treacherous  design.    \"She wrote that she had longed over and over again to confess the truth,  but had not dared to do so. She had heart trouble, she said, and her  days were numbered. Therefore she felt that she must confess the truth  before it became too late.    \"You can imagine,\" said Mrs. Allison, \"the effect this letter had upon  me. For fourteen years I had mourned my child as dead. It seemed  infinitely worse to hear that she had not died then, but was perhaps  alive, and in what circumstances?    \"The day I received the letter I took the train for the east, wiring the  Gibsons to meet me, and aided by them engaged the best detective service  upon the case. There was little or nothing to furnish us with a clue,  for the nurse's lying statement had misled us; we were out at sea before  we knew positively that Mabel had disappeared, and my long illness in  Europe, followed by my husband's death kept me from instituting a  thorough search of New York City.    \"I was bound for New York in answer to a summons from the men engaged on  the case, when this accident occurred. Mr. Gibson had offered to make  the journey for me, but I felt that I alone must hear the first  news--and to think that through that blessed accident I stumbled upon my  little girl.\" She ceased speaking and with streaming eyes again clasped  Mabel in a fond embrace.    The chums found their own eyes wet, during this recital, but of the  four, Jessica appeared to be the most deeply moved. Mabel had meant more  to her than to the others, and she found herself facing the severest  trial that had so far entered her young life. She drew a deep breath,  then went bravely over to Mrs. Allison, saying with quivering lips:    \"It is very, very hard to give Mabel up. She is the child of our  sorority, but she belongs most of all to me. She is the dearest girl  imaginable, and neither hardship nor poverty have marred her. She is  sweet, unselfish and wholesome, and always will be. I am glad, glad,  glad that her dream has at last been realized, and I should be the most  selfish girl in the world if I didn't rejoice at her good fortune.\"    She smiled through her tears at Mabel, who rushed over to her and  exclaimed:    \"Jessica, dearest, you know perfectly well how much I do and always  shall love you, and Grace and Anne and Nora, too.\"    The four girls lingered a few moments, then said good-bye to Mrs.  Allison and Mabel, who was to remain for the present with her mother.  She kissed her friends tenderly, promising to see them the next day.    \"I'll be in school to-morrow unless mother needs me here,\" she said with  such a world of fond pride in her voice that the girls who had so  willingly befriended her felt that their loss was a matter of small  consequence when compared with the glorious fact that Mabel had come  into her own.          CHAPTER IV    GRACE TURNS IN THE FIRE ALARM      \"I wonder what sort of excitement we shall have next?\" remarked Grace  Harlowe to her three friends one afternoon as they gathered in the  senior locker-room, before leaving school.    Three weeks had elapsed since Mabel Allison and her mother had met in  Room 47 of the hospital, and many events had transpired in that short  space of time.    The girl chums had been entertained at \"Hawk's Nest\" by Mrs. Gibson, and  were in consequence the most important persons in the Girls' High  School. They had found Mrs. Gibson charming, and had been invited to  repeat their visit at an early date. Mabel's story had circulated  throughout Oakdale, and she and her friends were the topic of the hour.    The one cloud on their horizon had been the fact of the inevitable  separation. They had begged and entreated Mrs. Allison to take up her  residence in Oakdale for the balance of Mabel's junior year, but on  account of home matters she had been unable to comply with their wishes.  So Mabel had departed for Denver with her mother, while the chums had  kissed her and cried over her and had"]]]
