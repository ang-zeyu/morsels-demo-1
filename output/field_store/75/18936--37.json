Naturally anxious as we were for a speedy journey, the  possibility of failure in hitting the one open passage lent the  additional charm of uncertainty to our voyage; not charming, however, to  the poor emigrants whose stock of provisions was too scanty to admit of a  long stay on board, while the commissariat of the steamer was not  prepared to supply them. Knowing this, the captain--a pleasant, handsome  man--quoting the saying that \"Fortune favours the brave,\" put on steam.    By eight o'clock on Sunday morning we had met great blocks of ice, and  grown accustomed to hearing them bump against the side of the boat; and  before noon we were well into the icefields, with loose blocks of ice on  every side, and a rough surface of piled-up masses as far as the eye  could see. Up a narrow strip of blue water we steamed, the passage  closing in our wake. Then the way became blocked ahead, while the vessel  heeled to one side with a lurch, as a great block went under her keel.  The captain held on steadily but slowly, stopping the machinery until a  large berg was passed, and taking advantage of an opening created by the  waves as they bore the floes upon their crests. As the ice-blocks closed  in behind us the certainty of being unable to return, and the difficulty  of going ahead, gave increased excitement to our adventure.    One of its strangest features was the heat. Though clothed in the  lightest summer dresses, we were uncomfortably warm--and this with miles  of ice around us! The warm land-breeze, and our captain's promptitude and  determination, enabled us to reach Duluth that evening. A change of wind  the same night drove the ice back into the bay, and from the hotel  windows we saw and commiserated four vessels locked fast, their crews and  passengers suffering from cold and short rations for four days. The  change of wind made us glad of our fur jackets.    Duluth, situated on the rocky north, or Minnesota, shore of the extreme  western end of Lake Superior--otherwise St. Louis Bay--was apparently  planned in expectation of its one day becoming the principal centre of  commerce between America and Canada--in short, the great capital of the  lakes. Everything is on a large scale. The streets are broad; the wharves  and warehouses extensive; the hotels immense; the custom-house and other  public buildings massive and capacious enough to accommodate any number  of extra clerks when the rush of business shall come--a rush which is  still in the future. During the day and a half we spent there, the hotel  omnibus and one other team were the only locomotives, and a lame man and  a water-carrier with a patch over his eye the only dwellers in Duluth we  saw; while the people from our boat seemed to be the only visitors who  woke the echoes in the sleepy place. It was like a city in a fairy tale,  over which a spell had been cast; its very cleanliness was depressing,  and so suggestive of disuse, that I think a mass of mud scraped off the  road might have given some appearance of traffic and life to the scene.    There _are_ people in Duluth, however, though it is difficult to say  where they hide themselves; for some of our party went to service in a  little church on a hill, and came back charmed with the eloquence of the  clergyman and the sweetness of the voices in the quartette choir, to say  nothing of several pretty girls they noticed amongst the congregation.  Still, Duluth will always seem to me like a city in a dream. On the  opposite, or Wisconsin shore of the lake, is Superior City, a pretty,  half-built town, rising slowly into commercial importance. Unfortunately  we were unable to cross to it.    I cannot leave Duluth without speaking of the \"girls\" in the hotel, as  they were called, in order not to wound the sensitive democracy of the  Yankee nature, which abhors the name of servant. There were three in the  great dining-saloon, whose superabundance of empty chairs and tables gave  even greater dreariness to the house than its long, empty corridors.  Pretty fair girls they were, neat in dress, but so tightly laced that it  was painful to look at them. Their slow, stiff, automatic movements were  suggestive of machinery, and in keeping with the sleepy spell cast over  the town. All the lithe, living gracefulness of their figures was  destroyed for the sake of drawing in an inch or two of belt. Watching  them, I attacked my breakfast with greater energy, to prove to myself  that there was something substantial about the premises.    One word respecting the treatment of luggage in that part of the world by  porters and officials, whose organ of destructiveness seems to be  abnormally developed. Boxes were thrown pell-mell into the hold, or  tossed on end out of high baggage-vans, with such unnecessary violence  that nothing less than cases of solid iron or stronger metal could have  stood it. Trunks, \"stationary\" boxes warranted to stand any ill-usage,  were cracked and broken; and the poor emigrants' boxes, of comparatively  slight construction, soon became a mass of ruins, with their contents  scattered on the ground. It was the same everywhere--at Duluth, at  Glyndon, and at Fisher's Landing, where we took the Red River boat. At  Glyndon half the baggage was piled on an open truck, and the heavy rain  we passed through that night completed the ruin the officials began. A  member of the Hudson Bay Company, who had travelled a great deal over  this continent, said he found it best to carry his baggage in a small  hand-valise, or in a very large trunk so heavy that it required two men  to move it; anything between the two was invariably smashed.

After leaving Duluth at four o'clock on Tuesday morning by rail, the  country through which we passed was very beautiful. Lake succeeded lake,  then came wooded hills and tiny mountain streams, crossed by high  bridges. These bridges were without parapets, and so narrow that, looking  out of the window of the car, one saw a deep gorge sixty or seventy feet  below. One railway bridge across the Mississippi--a narrow enough stream  there, at least to eyes accustomed to the broad St. Lawrence--was more  than seventy feet high, and so unsafe that trains were allowed only to  creep slowly across it. The rapids on the St. Louis River, along the  banks of which the Northern Pacific runs, are magnificent. For some miles  the high banks occasionally almost shut out the view; then, as the train  winds round a sharp curve, a mountain torrent of foaming water bursts  upon the gaze. Rocks tower above it, with great trees bending from their  heights; in the stream are huge boulders round which the water whirls and  hisses, sending its spray high over the rugged banks, in every nook and  crevice of which grow long ferns and graceful wild-flowers. Then follows  a long smooth stretch of water with grassy wooded shores, and through the  trees one catches distant glimpses of yet wider and more beautiful falls  than those just passed.    We breakfasted at Braynor at nine o'clock, and heard with pleasure that  we had forty-five minutes wherein to satisfy exhausted nature. Everything  was delicious, and we should have done the fare even greater justice had  we known that it was the last good meal we should obtain for thirty-six  hours. When we returned to the car we were greatly amused by an  irrepressible fellow-traveller, whose over-politeness and loquacity  savoured of a morning dram or two.    He insisted on pointing out the exact spot--marked by a tall,  rough-looking post with a cross-tree on it, that stood near the  rails--where two Indians had been \"lynched\" for some crime by the  citizens; which exploit being regarded with _pardonable_ pride by  them, was boasted of to travellers accordingly. Volumes might be written  on Yankee oppression of the poor Red-skins, and yet leave the disgraceful  story but half told.    Our train was crowded, and during the morning two rather well-dressed  black-eyed men came on board. The conductor told us they were the pests  of that part of the road--three card-mont√© men--and that in spite of  being carefully warned many travellers, especially amongst the well-to-do  farmer class emigrating to Manitoba, were daily fleeced by them, there  being no apparent redress, as they are sharp enough to evade any direct  breach of the law. These men succeeded in drawing two boys of eighteen or  twenty into their toils, and obtained possession of their watches, as  well as all the money they had about them. When the lads protested  vehemently, the sharpers offered to return the former upon receipt of  five dollars, which they knew their victims did not possess. To our great  relief, the men got off at the station where we stopped for dinner.    We changed trains at Glyndon for the branch line, then only recently laid  to Fisher's Landing, but since that time continued to the frontier  station of Pembina. There was only one passenger car to hold all those  who had comfortably filled three on the other line, and it would be  difficult to convey any idea of the crowding and crushing that ensued to  obtain seats, and pack away the numerous travelling-bags and  provision-baskets brought by the emigrants from Ontario. Having gentlemen  with us, we were soon provided for; but just before the train started, a  very dirty, fashionably dressed young woman, carrying an equally dirty  baby, came in. Looking about her, and not finding a vacant seat, she said  in an insolent tone, giving her head a toss--    \"No"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7128"],[0,"Indian Fairy Tales (#4)"],[1,"to marry the Princess Labam had to fight with these  demons; \"for,\" said the king to himself, \"perhaps the demons may be  killed, and then I shall be rid of them.\"    When he heard of the demons the Raja's son was very sad. \"What can I  do?\" he said to himself. \"How can I fight with these two demons?\" Then  he thought of his tiger: and the tiger and his wife came to him and  said, \"Why are you so sad?\" The Raja's son answered, \"The king has  ordered me to fight with his two demons and kill them. How can I do  this?\" \"Do not be frightened,\" said the tiger. \"Be happy. I and my  wife will fight with them for you.\"    [Illustration:]    Then the Raja's son took out of his bag two splendid coats. They were  all gold and silver, and covered with pearls and diamonds. These he  put on the tigers to make them beautiful, and he took them to the  king, and said to him, \"May these tigers fight your demons for me?\"  \"Yes,\" said the king, who did not care in the least who killed his  demons, provided they were killed. \"Then call your demons,\" said the  Raja's son, \"and these tigers will fight them.\" The king did so, and  the tigers and the demons fought and fought until the tigers had  killed the demons.    \"That is good,\" said the king. \"But you must do something else before  I give you my daughter. Up in the sky I have a kettle-drum. You must  go and beat it. If you cannot do this, I will kill you.\"    The Raja's son thought of his little bed; so he went to the old  woman's house and sat on his bed. \"Little bed,\" he said, \"up in the  sky is the king's kettle-drum. I want to go to it.\" The bed flew up  with him, and the Raja's son beat the drum, and the king heard him.  Still, when he came down, the king would not give him his daughter.  \"You have,\" he said to the prince, \"done the three things I told you  to do; but you must do one thing more.\" \"If I can, I will,\" said the  Raja's son.    Then the king showed him the trunk of a tree that was lying near his  court-house. It was a very, very thick trunk. He gave the prince a wax  hatchet, and said, \"To-morrow morning you must cut this trunk in two  with this wax hatchet.\"    The Raja's son went back to the old woman's house. He was very sad,  and thought that now the Raja would certainly kill him. \"I had his oil  crushed out by the ants,\" he said to himself. \"I had his demons killed  by the tigers. My bed helped me to beat his kettle-drum. But now what  can I do? How can I cut that thick tree-trunk in two with a wax  hatchet?\"    At night he went on his bed to see the princess. \"To-morrow,\" he said  to her, \"your father will kill me.\" \"Why?\" asked the princess.    \"He has told me to cut a thick tree-trunk in two with a wax hatchet.  How can I ever do that?\" said the Raja's son. \"Do not be afraid,\" said  the princess; \"do as I bid you, and you will cut it in two quite  easily.\"    Then she pulled out a hair from her head, and gave it to the prince.  \"To-morrow,\" she said, \"when no one is near you, you must say to the  tree-trunk, 'The Princess Labam commands you to let yourself be cut in  two by this hair.' Then stretch the hair down the edge of the wax  hatchet's blade.\"    The prince next day did exactly as the princess had told him; and the  minute the hair that was stretched down the edge of the hatchet-blade  touched the tree-trunk it split into two pieces.    The king said, \"Now you can marry my daughter.\" Then the wedding took  place. All the Rajas and kings of the countries round were asked to  come to it, and there were great rejoicings. After a few days the  prince's son said to his wife, \"Let us go to my father's country.\" The  Princess Labam's father gave them a quantity of camels and horses and  rupees and servants; and they travelled in great state to the prince's  country, where they lived happily.    The prince always kept his bag, bowl, bed, and stick; only, as no one  ever came to make war on him, he never needed to use the stick.          The Lambikin      Once upon a time there was a wee wee Lambikin, who frolicked about on  his little tottery legs, and enjoyed himself amazingly.    Now one day he set off to visit his Granny, and was jumping with joy  to think of all the good things he should get from her, when who  should he meet but a Jackal, who looked at the tender young morsel and  said: \"Lambikin! Lambikin! I'll EAT YOU!\"    [Illustration:]    But Lambikin only gave a little frisk and said:        \"To Granny's house I go,      Where I shall fatter grow,      Then you can eat me so.\"    The Jackal thought this reasonable, and let Lambikin pass.    By-and-by he met a Vulture, and the Vulture, looking hungrily at the  tender morsel before him, said: \"Lambikin! Lambikin! I'll EAT YOU!\"    [Illustration:]    But Lambikin only gave a little frisk, and said:        \"To Granny's house I go,      Where I shall fatter grow,      Then you can eat me so.\"    The Vulture thought this reasonable, and let Lambikin pass.    And by-and-by he met a Tiger, and then a Wolf, and a Dog, and an  Eagle, and all these, when they saw the tender little morsel, said:  \"Lambikin! Lambikin! I'll EAT YOU!\"    [Illustration:]    But to all of them Lambikin replied, with a little frisk:        \"To Granny's house I go,      Where I shall fatter grow,      Then you can eat me so.\"    At last he reached his Granny's house, and said, all in a great hurry,  \"Granny, dear, I've promised to get very fat; so, as people ought to  keep their promises, please put me into the corn-bin _at once_.\"    So his Granny said he was a good boy, and put him into the corn-bin,  and there the greedy little Lambikin stayed for seven days, and ate,  and ate, and ate, until he could scarcely waddle, and his Granny said  he was fat enough for anything, and must go home. But cunning little  Lambikin said that would never do, for some animal would be sure to  eat him on the way back, he was so plump and tender.    \"I'll tell you what you must do,\" said Master Lambikin, \"you must make  a little drumikin out of the skin of my little brother who died, and  then I can sit inside and trundle along nicely, for I'm as tight as a  drum myself.\"    [Illustration:]    So his Granny made a nice little drumikin out of his brother's skin,  with the wool inside, and Lambikin curled himself up snug and warm in  the middle, and trundled away gaily. Soon he met with the Eagle, who  called out:        \"Drumikin! Drumikin!      Have you seen Lambikin?\"    And Mr. Lambikin, curled up in his soft warm nest, replied:        \"Fallen into the fire, and so will you      On little Drumikin.  Tum-pa, tum-too!\"    \"How very annoying!\" sighed the Eagle, thinking regretfully of the  tender morsel he had let slip.    Meanwhile Lambikin trundled along, laughing to himself, and singing:        \"Tum-pa, tum-too;      Tum-pa, tum-too!\"    Every animal and bird he met asked him the same question:        \"Drumikin! Drumikin!      Have you seen Lambikin?\"    And to each of them the little slyboots replied:        \"Fallen into the fire, and so will you      On little Drumikin. Tum-pa, tum too;      Tum-pa, tum-too; Tum-pa, tum-too!\"    Then they all sighed to think of the tender little morsel they had let  slip.    At last the Jackal came limping along, for all his sorry looks as  sharp as a needle, and he too called out--        \"Drumikin! Drumikin!      Have you seen Lambikin?\"    And Lambikin, curled up in his snug little nest, replied gaily:        \"Fallen into the fire, and so will you      On little Drumikin! Tum-pa----\"    But he never got any further, for the Jackal recognised his voice at  once, and cried: \"Hullo! you've turned yourself inside out, have you?  Just you come out of that!\"    Whereupon he tore open Drumikin and gobbled up Lambikin.          Punchkin    [Illustration:]      Once upon a time there was a Raja who had seven beautiful daughters.  They were all good girls; but the youngest, named Balna, was more  clever than the rest. The Raja's wife died when they were quite little  children, so these seven poor Princesses were left with no mother to  take care of them.    The Raja's daughters took it by turns to cook their father's dinner  every day, whilst he was absent deliberating with his Ministers on the  affairs of the nation.    About this time the Prudhan died, leaving a widow and one daughter;  and every day, every day, when the seven Princesses were preparing  their father's dinner, the Prudhan's widow and daughter would come and  beg for a little fire from the hearth. Then Balna used to say to her  sisters, \"Send that woman away; send her away. Let her get the fire at  her own house. What does she want with ours? If we allow her to come  here, we shall suffer for it some day.\"    But the other sisters would answer, \"Be quiet, Balna; why must you  always be quarrelling with this poor woman? Let her take some fire if  she likes.\" Then the Prudhan's widow used to go to the hearth and take  a few sticks from it; and whilst no one was looking, she would quickly  throw some mud into the midst of the dishes which were being prepared  for the Raja's dinner.    Now the Raja was very fond of his daughters. Ever since their mother's  death they had cooked his dinner with their own hands, in order to  avoid the danger of his being poisoned by his enemies. So, when he  found the mud mixed up with his dinner, he thought it must arise from  their carelessness, as it did not seem likely that any one should have  put mud there on purpose; but being very kind he did not like to  reprove them for it, although this spoiling of the curry was repeated  many successive days.    At last, one day, he determined to hide, and watch his daughters  cooking, and see how it all happened; so he went into the next room,  and watched them through a hole in the wall.    There he saw his seven daughters carefully washing the rice and  preparing the curry, and as each dish was completed, they put it by  the fire ready to be cooked. Next he noticed"]]]
