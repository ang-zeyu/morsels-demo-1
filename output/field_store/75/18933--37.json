Yet here a great number of  them were in perhaps as embarrassing a position as ever diplomatists  were called upon to unravel. When nine dogs are assembled round one  bone, it is rarely on the bone alone that teeth-marks are found at the  close of the proceedings.    Prince Otto of Saxe-Pfennig set himself resolutely to grapple with the  problem. His chance of grappling successfully with it was not improved  by the stream of telegrams which arrived daily from his Imperial  Master, demanding to know whether he had yet subjugated the country,  and if not, why not. He had replied guardedly, stating the difficulties  which lay in his way, and had received the following: \"At once mailed  fist display. On Get or out Get.--WILHELM.\"    It was then that the distracted prince saw that steps must be taken at  once.    Carefully-worded letters were despatched by District Messenger boys to  the other generals. Towards nightfall the replies began to come in,  and, having read them, the Prince saw that this business could never be  settled without a personal interview. Many of the replies were  absolutely incoherent.    Raisuli, apologising for delay on the ground that he had been away in  the Isle of Dogs cracking a crib, wrote suggesting that the Germans and  Moroccans should combine with a view to playing the Confidence Trick on  the Swiss general, who seemed a simple sort of chap. \"Reminds me of  dear old Maclean,\" wrote Raisuli. \"There is money in this. Will you  come in? Wire in the morning.\"    The general of the Monaco forces thought the best way would be to  settle the thing by means of a game of chance of the odd-man-out class.  He knew a splendid game called Slippery Sam. He could teach them the  rules in half a minute.    The reply of Prince Ping Pong Pang of China was probably brilliant and  scholarly, but it was expressed in Chinese characters of the Ming  period, which Prince Otto did not understand; and even if he had it  would have done him no good, for he tried to read it from the top  downwards instead of from the bottom up.    The Young Turks, as might have been expected, wrote in their customary  flippant, cheeky style. They were full of mischief, as usual. The body  of the letter, scrawled in a round, schoolboy hand, dealt principally  with the details of the booby-trap which the general had successfully  laid for his head of staff. \"He was frightfully shirty,\" concluded the  note jubilantly.    From the Bollygolla camp the messenger-boy returned without a scalp,  and with a verbal message to the effect that the King could neither  read nor write.    Grand Duke Vodkakoff, from the Russian lines, replied in his smooth,  cynical, Russian way:--\"You appear anxious, my dear prince, to scratch  the other entrants. May I beg you to remember what happens when you  scratch a Russian?\"    As for the Mad Mullah's reply, it was simply pure delirium. The journey  from Somaliland, and his meeting with his friend Mr. Dillon, appeared  to have had the worse effects on his sanity. He opened with the  statement that he was a tea-pot: and that was the only really coherent  remark he made.    Prince Otto placed a hand wearily on his throbbing brow.    \"We must have a conference,\" he said. \"It is the only way.\"    Next day eight invitations to dinner went out from the German camp.           *       *       *       *       *    It would be idle to say that the dinner, as a dinner, was a complete  success. Half-way through the Swiss general missed his diamond  solitaire, and cold glances were cast at Raisuli, who sat on his  immediate left. Then the King of Bollygolla's table-manners were  frankly inelegant. When he wanted a thing, he grabbed for it. And he  seemed to want nearly everything. Nor was the behaviour of the leader  of the Young Turks all that could be desired. There had been some talk  of only allowing him to come down to dessert; but he had squashed in,  as he briefly put it, and it would be paltering with the truth to say  that he had not had far more champagne than was good for him. Also, the  general of Monaco had brought a pack of cards with him, and was  spoiling the harmony by trying to induce Prince Ping Pong Pang to find  the lady. And the brainless laugh of the Mad Mullah was very trying.    Altogether Prince Otto was glad when the cloth was removed, and the  waiters left the company to smoke and talk business.    Anyone who has had anything to do with the higher diplomacy is aware  that diplomatic language stands in a class by itself. It is a language  specially designed to deceive the chance listener.    Thus when Prince Otto, turning to Grand Duke Vodkakoff, said quietly,  \"I hear the crops are coming on nicely down Kent way,\" the habitual  frequenter of diplomatic circles would have understood, as did the  Grand Duke, that what he really meant was, \"Now about this business.  What do you propose to do?\"    The company, with the exception of the representative of the Young  Turks, who was drinking _creme de menthe_ out of a tumbler, the  Mullah and the King of Bollygolla bent forward, deeply interested, to  catch the Russian's reply. Much would depend on this.    Vodkakoff carelessly flicked the ash off his cigarette.    \"So I hear,\" he said slowly. \"But in Shropshire, they tell me, they are  having trouble with the mangel-wurzels.\"    The prince frowned at this typical piece of shifty Russian diplomacy.    \"How is your Highness getting on with your Highness's roller-skating?\"  he enquired guardedly.    The Russian smiled a subtle smile.    \"Poorly,\" he said, \"poorly. The last time I tried the outside edge I  thought somebody had thrown the building at me.\"    Prince Otto flushed. He was a plain, blunt man, and he hated this  beating about the bush.    \"Why does a chicken cross the road?\" he demanded, almost angrily.    The Russian raised his eyebrows, and smiled, but made no reply. The  prince, resolved to give him no chance of wriggling away from the  point, pressed him hotly.    \"Think of a number,\" he cried. \"Double it. Add ten. Take away the  number you first thought of. Divide it by three, and what is the  result?\"    There was an awed silence. Surely the Russian, expert at evasion as he  was, could not parry so direct a challenge as this.    He threw away his cigarette and lit a cigar.    \"I understand,\" he said, with a tinkle of defiance in his voice, \"that  the Suffragettes, as a last resource, propose to capture Mr. Asquith  and sing the Suffragette Anthem to him.\"    A startled gasp ran round the table.    \"Because the higher he flies, the fewer?\" asked Prince Otto, with  sinister calm.    \"Because the higher he flies, the fewer,\" said the Russian smoothly,  but with the smoothness of a treacherous sea.    There was another gasp. The situation was becoming alarmingly tense.    \"You are plain-spoken, your Highness,\" said Prince Otto slowly.    At this moment the tension was relieved by the Young Turk falling off  his chair with a crash on to the floor. Everyone jumped up startled.  Raisuli took advantage of the confusion to pocket a silver ash-tray.    The interruption had a good effect. Frowns relaxed. The wranglers began  to see that they had allowed their feelings to run away with them. It  was with a conciliatory smile that Prince Otto, filling the Grand  Duke's glass, observed:    \"Trumper is perhaps the prettier bat, but I confess I admire Fry's  robust driving.\"    The Russian was won over. He extended his hand.    \"Two down and three to play, and the red near the top corner pocket,\"  he said with that half-Oriental charm which he knew so well how to  exhibit on occasion.    The two shook hands warmly.    And so it was settled, the Russian having, as we have seen, waived his  claim to bombard London in his turn, there was no obstacle to a  peaceful settlement. It was obvious that the superior forces of the  Germans and Russians gave them, if they did but combine, the key to the  situation. The decision they arrived at was, as set forth above, as  follows. After the fashion of the moment, the Russian and German  generals decided to draw the Colour Line. That meant that the troops of  China, Somaliland, Bollygolla, as well as Raisuli and the Young Turks,  were ruled out. They would be given a week in which to leave the  country. Resistance would be useless. The combined forces of the  Germans, Russians, Swiss, and Monacoans were overwhelming, especially  as the Chinese had not recovered from their wanderings in Wales and  were far too footsore still to think of serious fighting.    When they had left, the remaining four Powers would continue the  invasion jointly.           *        *        *        *        *    Prince Otto of Saxe-Pfennig went to bed that night, comfortably  conscious of a good work well done. He saw his way now clear before  him.    But he had made one miscalculation. He had not reckoned with Clarence  Chugwater.            Part Two          Chapter 1    IN THE BOY SCOUTS' CAMP      Night!    Night in Aldwych!    In the centre of that vast tract of unreclaimed prairie known to  Londoners as the Aldwych Site there shone feebly, seeming almost to  emphasise the darkness and desolation of the scene, a single light.    It was the camp-fire of the Boy Scouts.    The night was raw and windy. A fine rain had been falling for some  hours. The date of September the First. For just a month England had  been in the grip of the invaders. The coloured section of the hostile  force had either reached its home by now, or was well on its way. The  public had seen it go with a certain regret. Not since the visit of the  Shah had such an attractive topic of conversation been afforded them.  Several comic journalists had built up a reputation and a large price  per thousand words on the King of Bollygolla alone. Theatres had  benefited by the index of a large, new, unsophisticated public. A piece  at the Waldorf Theatre had run for a whole fortnight, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/706"],[0,"The Amateur Cracksman (#4)"],[1,"paralysis.  And there I stood, shining my light and holding my phial  with a keener interest than I had ever brought to any honest avocation.  And there knelt A. J. Raffles, with his black hair tumbled, and the  same watchful, quiet, determined half-smile with which I have seen him  send down over after over in a county match!    At last the chain of holes was complete, the lock wrenched out bodily,  and a splendid bare arm plunged up to the shoulder through the  aperture, and through the bars of the iron gate beyond.    \"Now,\" whispered Raffles, \"if there's only one lock it'll be in the  middle.  Joy!  Here it is!  Only let me pick it, and we're through at  last.\"    He withdrew his arm, a skeleton key was selected from the bunch, and  then back went his arm to the shoulder.  It was a breathless moment.  I  heard the heart throbbing in my body, the very watch ticking in my  pocket, and ever and anon the tinkle-tinkle of the skeleton key.  Then--at last--there came a single unmistakable click.  In another  minute the mahogany door and the iron gate yawned behind us; and  Raffles was sitting on an office table, wiping his face, with the  lantern throwing a steady beam by his side.    We were now in a bare and roomy lobby behind the shop, but separated  therefrom by an iron curtain, the very sight of which filled me with  despair. Raffles, however, did not appear in the least depressed, but  hung up his coat and hat on some pegs in the lobby before examining  this curtain with his lantern.    \"That's nothing,\" said he, after a minute's inspection; \"we'll be  through that in no time, but there's a door on the other side which may  give us trouble.\"    \"Another door!\" I groaned.  \"And how do you mean to tackle this thing?\"    \"Prise it up with the jointed jimmy.  The weak point of these iron  curtains is the leverage you can get from below.  But it makes a noise,  and this is where you're coming in, Bunny; this is where I couldn't do  without you.  I must have you overhead to knock through when the  street's clear. I'll come with you and show a light.\"    Well, you may imagine how little I liked the prospect of this lonely  vigil; and yet there was something very stimulating in the vital  responsibility which it involved.  Hitherto I had been a mere  spectator.  Now I was to take part in the game. And the fresh  excitement made me more than ever insensible to those considerations of  conscience and of safety which were already as dead nerves in my breast.    So I took my post without a murmur in the front room above the shop.  The fixtures had been left for the refusal of the incoming tenant, and  fortunately for us they included Venetian blinds which were already  down.  It was the simplest matter in the world to stand peeping through  the laths into the street, to beat twice with my foot when anybody was  approaching, and once when all was clear again.  The noises that even I  could hear below, with the exception of one metallic crash at the  beginning, were indeed incredibly slight; but they ceased altogether at  each double rap from my toe; and a policeman passed quite half a dozen  times beneath my eyes, and the man whom I took to be the jeweller's  watchman oftener still, during the better part of an hour that I spent  at the window.  Once, indeed, my heart was in my mouth, but only once.  It was when the watchman stopped and peered through the peep-hole into  the lighted shop.  I waited for his whistle--I waited for the gallows  or the gaol!  But my signals had been studiously obeyed, and the man  passed on in undisturbed serenity.    In the end I had a signal in my turn, and retraced my steps with  lighted matches, down the broad stairs, down the narrow ones, across  the area, and up into the lobby where Raffles awaited me with an  outstretched hand.    \"Well done, my boy!\" said he.  \"You're the same good man in a pinch,  and you shall have your reward.  I've got a thousand pounds' worth if  I've got a penn'oth.  It's all in my pockets.  And here's something  else I found in this locker; very decent port and some cigars, meant  for poor dear Danby's business friends.  Take a pull, and you shall  light up presently.  I've found a lavatory, too, and we must have a  wash-and-brush-up before we go, for I'm as black as your boot.\"    The iron curtain was down, but he insisted on raising it until I could  peep through the glass door on the other side and see his handiwork in  the shop beyond.  Here two electric lights were left burning all night  long, and in their cold white rays I could at first see nothing amiss.  I looked along an orderly lane, an empty glass counter on my left,  glass cupboards of untouched silver on my right, and facing me the  filmy black eye of the peep-hole that shone like a stage moon on the  street.  The counter had not been emptied by Raffles; its contents were  in the Chubb's safe, which he had given up at a glance; nor had he  looked at the silver, except to choose a cigarette case for me.  He had  confined himself entirely to the shop window.  This was in three  compartments, each secured for the night by removable panels with  separate locks. Raffles had removed them a few hours before their time,  and the electric light shone on a corrugated shutter bare as the ribs  of an empty carcase.  Every article of value was gone from the one  place which was invisible from the little window in the door; elsewhere  all was as it had been left overnight. And but for a train of mangled  doors behind the iron curtain, a bottle of wine and a cigar-box with  which liberties had been taken, a rather black towel in the lavatory, a  burnt match here and there, and our finger-marks on the dusty  banisters, not a trace of our visit did we leave.    \"Had it in my head for long?\" said Raffles, as we strolled through the  streets towards dawn, for all the world as though we were returning  from a dance.  \"No, Bunny, I never thought of it till I saw that upper  part empty about a month ago, and bought a few things in the shop to  get the lie of the land.  That reminds me that I never paid for them;  but, by Jove, I will to-morrow, and if that isn't poetic justice, what  is?  One visit showed me the possibilities of the place, but a second  convinced me of its impossibilities without a pal.  So I had  practically given up the idea, when you came along on the very night  and in the very plight for it!  But here we are at the Albany, and I  hope there's some fire left; for I don't know how you feel, Bunny, but  for my part I'm as cold as Keats's owl.\"    He could think of Keats on his way from a felony!  He could hanker for  his fireside like another!  Floodgates were loosed within me, and the  plain English of our adventure rushed over me as cold as ice.  Raffles  was a burglar.  I had helped him to commit one burglary, therefore I  was a burglar, too.  Yet I could stand and warm myself by his fire, and  watch him empty his pockets, as though we had done nothing wonderful or  wicked!    My blood froze.  My heart sickened.  My brain whirled.  How I had liked  this villain!  How I had admired him!  Now my liking and admiration  must turn to loathing and disgust.  I waited for the change.  I longed  to feel it in my heart.  But--I longed and I waited in vain!    I saw that he was emptying his pockets; the table sparkled with their  hoard.  Rings by the dozen, diamonds by the score; bracelets, pendants,  aigrettes, necklaces, pearls, rubies, amethysts, sapphires; and  diamonds always, diamonds in everything, flashing bayonets of light,  dazzling me--blinding me--making me disbelieve because I could no  longer forget.  Last of all came no gem, indeed, but my own revolver  from an inner pocket. And that struck a chord.  I suppose I said  something--my hand flew out.  I can see Raffles now, as he looked at me  once more with a high arch over each clear eye.  I can see him pick out  the cartridges with his quiet, cynical smile, before he would give me  my pistol back again.    \"You mayn't believe it, Bunny,\" said he, \"but I never carried a loaded  one before.  On the whole I think it gives one confidence.  Yet it  would be very awkward if anything went wrong; one might use it, and  that's not the game at all, though I have often thought that the  murderer who has just done the trick must have great sensations before  things get too hot for him.  Don't look so distressed, my dear chap.  I've never had those sensations, and I don't suppose I ever shall.\"    \"But this much you have done before?\" said I hoarsely.    \"Before?  My dear Bunny, you offend me!  Did it look like a first  attempt?  Of course I have done it before.\"    \"Often?\"    \"Well--no!  Not often enough to destroy the charm, at all events;  never, as a matter of fact, unless I'm cursedly hard up.  Did you hear  about the Thimbleby diamonds?  Well, that was the last time--and a poor  lot of paste they were.  Then there was the little business of the  Dormer house-boat at Henley last year.  That was mine also--such as it  was.  I've never brought off a really big coup yet; when I do I shall  chuck it up.\"    Yes, I remembered both cases very well.  To think that he was their  author!  It was incredible, outrageous, inconceivable.  Then my eyes  would fall upon the table, twinkling and glittering in a hundred  places, and incredulity was at an end.    \"How came you to begin?\" I asked, as curiosity overcame mere wonder,  and a fascination for his career gradually wove itself into my  fascination for the man.    \"Ah! that's a long story,\" said Raffles.  \"It was in the Colonies, when  I was out there playing cricket.  It's too long a story to tell you  now, but I was in much the same fix that you were in to-night, and it  was my only way out.  I never meant it for anything more; but I'd  tasted blood, and it was all over with me.  Why should I work when I  could steal?  Why settle down to some humdrum uncongenial billet, when  excitement, romance, danger"]]]
