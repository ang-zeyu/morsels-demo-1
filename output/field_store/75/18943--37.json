(#4)"],[1," forearms resting on his knees,  his long hair hanging like a fringe before his face, and he was  muttering to himself.  He raised his chin and looked us slowly  over, in a listless dull way, blinking with the distress of the  torchlight, then dropped his head and fell to muttering again  and took no further notice of us.  There were some pathetically  suggestive dumb witnesses present.  On his wrists and ankles were  cicatrices, old smooth scars, and fastened to the stone on which  he sat was a chain with manacles and fetters attached; but this  apparatus lay idle on the ground, and was thick with rust.  Chains  cease to be needed after the spirit has gone out of a prisoner.    I could not rouse the man; so I said we would take him to her,  and see--to the bride who was the fairest thing in the earth to him,  once--roses, pearls, and dew made flesh, for him; a wonder-work,  the master-work of nature: with eyes like no other eyes, and voice  like no other voice, and a freshness, and lithe young grace, and  beauty, that belonged properly to the creatures of dreams--as he  thought--and to no other.  The sight of her would set his stagnant  blood leaping; the sight of her--    But it was a disappointment.  They sat together on the ground and  looked dimly wondering into each other's faces a while, with a  sort of weak animal curiosity; then forgot each other's presence,  and dropped their eyes, and you saw that they were away again and  wandering in some far land of dreams and shadows that we know  nothing about.    I had them taken out and sent to their friends.  The queen did not  like it much.  Not that she felt any personal interest in the matter,  but she thought it disrespectful to Sir Breuse Sance Pite.  However,  I assured her that if he found he couldn't stand it I would fix him  so that he could.    I set forty-seven prisoners loose out of those awful rat-holes,  and left only one in captivity.  He was a lord, and had killed  another lord, a sort of kinsman of the queen.  That other lord  had ambushed him to assassinate him, but this fellow had got the  best of him and cut his throat.  However, it was not for that that  I left him jailed, but for maliciously destroying the only public  well in one of his wretched villages.  The queen was bound to hang  him for killing her kinsman, but I would not allow it: it was no  crime to kill an assassin.  But I said I was willing to let her  hang him for destroying the well; so she concluded to put up with  that, as it was better than nothing.    Dear me, for what trifling offenses the most of those forty-seven  men and women were shut up there!  Indeed, some were there for  no distinct offense at all, but only to gratify somebody's spite;  and not always the queen's by any means, but a friend's.  The newest  prisoner's crime was a mere remark which he had made.  He said  he believed that men were about all alike, and one man as good  as another, barring clothes.  He said he believed that if you were  to strip the nation naked and send a stranger through the crowd, he  couldn't tell the king from a quack doctor, nor a duke from a hotel  clerk.  Apparently here was a man whose brains had not been reduced  to an ineffectual mush by idiotic training.  I set him loose and  sent him to the Factory.    Some of the cells carved in the living rock were just behind the  face of the precipice, and in each of these an arrow-slit had been  pierced outward to the daylight, and so the captive had a thin  ray from the blessed sun for his comfort.  The case of one of  these poor fellows was particularly hard.  From his dusky swallow's  hole high up in that vast wall of native rock he could peer out  through the arrow-slit and see his own home off yonder in the  valley; and for twenty-two years he had watched it, with heartache  and longing, through that crack.  He could see the lights shine  there at night, and in the daytime he could see figures go in and  come out--his wife and children, some of them, no doubt, though  he could not make out at that distance.  In the course of years  he noted festivities there, and tried to rejoice, and wondered  if they were weddings or what they might be.  And he noted funerals;  and they wrung his heart.  He could make out the coffin, but he  could not determine its size, and so could not tell whether it was  wife or child.  He could see the procession form, with priests  and mourners, and move solemnly away, bearing the secret with  them.  He had left behind him five children and a wife; and in  nineteen years he had seen five funerals issue, and none of them  humble enough in pomp to denote a servant.  So he had lost five  of his treasures; there must still be one remaining--one now  infinitely, unspeakably precious,--but _which_ one? wife, or child?  That was the question that tortured him, by night and by day,  asleep and awake.  Well, to have an interest, of some sort, and  half a ray of light, when you are in a dungeon, is a great support  to the body and preserver of the intellect.  This man was in pretty  good condition yet.  By the time he had finished telling me his  distressful tale, I was in the same state of mind that you would  have been in yourself, if you have got average human curiosity;  that is to say, I was as burning up as he was to find out which  member of the family it was that was left.  So I took him over  home myself; and an amazing kind of a surprise party it was, too  --typhoons and cyclones of frantic joy, and whole Niagaras of happy  tears; and by George! we found the aforetime young matron graying  toward the imminent verge of her half century, and the babies all  men and women, and some of them married and experimenting familywise  themselves--for not a soul of the tribe was dead!  Conceive of the  ingenious devilishness of that queen: she had a special hatred for  this prisoner, and she had _invented_ all those funerals herself,  to scorch his heart with; and the sublimest stroke of genius of  the whole thing was leaving the family-invoice a funeral _short_,  so as to let him wear his poor old soul out guessing.    But for me, he never would have got out.  Morgan le Fay hated him  with her whole heart, and she never would have softened toward him.  And yet his crime was committed more in thoughtlessness than  deliberate depravity.  He had said she had red hair.  Well, she  had; but that was no way to speak of it.  When red-headed people  are above a certain social grade their hair is auburn.    Consider it: among these forty-seven captives there were five  whose names, offenses, and dates of incarceration were no longer  known!  One woman and four men--all bent, and wrinkled, and  mind-extinguished patriarchs.  They themselves had long ago forgotten  these details; at any rate they had mere vague theories about them,  nothing definite and nothing that they repeated twice in the same  way.  The succession of priests whose office it had been to pray  daily with the captives and remind them that God had put them  there, for some wise purpose or other, and teach them that patience,  humbleness, and submission to oppression was what He loved to see  in parties of a subordinate rank, had traditions about these poor  old human ruins, but nothing more.  These traditions went but  little way, for they concerned the length of the incarceration only,  and not the names of the offenses.  And even by the help of  tradition the only thing that could be proven was that none of  the five had seen daylight for thirty-five years: how much longer  this privation has lasted was not guessable.  The king and the queen  knew nothing about these poor creatures, except that they were  heirlooms, assets inherited, along with the throne, from the former  firm.  Nothing of their history had been transmitted with their  persons, and so the inheriting owners had considered them of no  value, and had felt no interest in them.  I said to the queen:    \"Then why in the world didn't you set them free?\"    The question was a puzzler.  She didn't know _why_ she hadn't, the  thing had never come up in her mind.  So here she was, forecasting  the veritable history of future prisoners of the Castle d'If,  without knowing it.  It seemed plain to me now, that with her  training, those inherited prisoners were merely property--nothing  more, nothing less.  Well, when we inherit property, it does not  occur to us to throw it away, even when we do not value it.    When I brought my procession of human bats up into the open world  and the glare of the afternoon sun--previously blindfolding them,  in charity for eyes so long untortured by light--they were a  spectacle to look at.  Skeletons, scarecrows, goblins, pathetic  frights, every one; legitimatest possible children of Monarchy  by the Grace of God and the Established Church.  I muttered absently:    \"I _wish_ I could photograph them!\"    You have seen that kind of people who will never let on that they  don't know the meaning of a new big word.  The more ignorant they  are, the more pitifully certain they are to pretend you haven't  shot over their heads.  The queen was just one of that sort, and  was always making the stupidest blunders by reason of it.  She  hesitated a moment; then her face brightened up with sudden  comprehension, and she said she would do it for me.    I thought to myself: She? why what can she know about photography?  But it was a poor time to be thinking.  When I looked around, she  was moving on the procession with an axe!    Well, she certainly was a curious one, was Morgan le Fay.  I have  seen a good many kinds of women in my time, but she laid over them  all for variety.  And how sharply characteristic of her this episode  was.  She had no more idea than a horse of how to photograph  a procession; but being in doubt, it was just like her to try  to do it with an axe.        CHAPTER XIX    KNIGHT-ERRANTRY AS A TRADE    Sandy and I were on the road again, next morning, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7246"],[0,"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Part 5. (#4)"],[1,"is  doing, and yet can't tell what a person is doing who isn't three  yards from you?  Persons behind me know what I am doing with my  right hand--they will indorse you if you tell correctly.\"  He was  still dumb.  \"Very well, I'll tell you why you don't speak up and  tell; it is because you don't know.  _You_ a magician!  Good friends,  this tramp is a mere fraud and liar.\"    This distressed the monks and terrified them.  They were not used  to hearing these awful beings called names, and they did not know  what might be the consequence.  There was a dead silence now;  superstitious bodings were in every mind.  The magician began to  pull his wits together, and when he presently smiled an easy,  nonchalant smile, it spread a mighty relief around; for it indicated  that his mood was not destructive.  He said:    \"It hath struck me speechless, the frivolity of this person's  speech.  Let all know, if perchance there be any who know it not,  that enchanters of my degree deign not to concern themselves with  the doings of any but kings, princes, emperors, them that be born  in the purple and them only.  Had ye asked me what Arthur the great  king is doing, it were another matter, and I had told ye; but the  doings of a subject interest me not.\"    \"Oh, I misunderstood you.  I thought you said 'anybody,' and so  I supposed 'anybody' included--well, anybody; that is, everybody.\"    \"It doth--anybody that is of lofty birth; and the better if  he be royal.\"    \"That, it meseemeth, might well be,\" said the abbot, who saw his  opportunity to smooth things and avert disaster, \"for it were not  likely that so wonderful a gift as this would be conferred for  the revelation of the concerns of lesser beings than such as be  born near to the summits of greatness.  Our Arthur the king--\"    \"Would you know of him?\" broke in the enchanter.    \"Most gladly, yea, and gratefully.\"    Everybody was full of awe and interest again right away, the  incorrigible idiots.  They watched the incantations absorbingly,  and looked at me with a \"There, now, what can you say to that?\"  air, when the announcement came:    \"The king is weary with the chase, and lieth in his palace these  two hours sleeping a dreamless sleep.\"    \"God's benison upon him!\" said the abbot, and crossed himself;  \"may that sleep be to the refreshment of his body and his soul.\"    \"And so it might be, if he were sleeping,\" I said, \"but the king  is not sleeping, the king rides.\"    Here was trouble again--a conflict of authority.  Nobody knew which  of us to believe; I still had some reputation left.  The magician's  scorn was stirred, and he said:    \"Lo, I have seen many wonderful soothsayers and prophets and  magicians in my life days, but none before that could sit idle and  see to the heart of things with never an incantation to help.\"    \"You have lived in the woods, and lost much by it.  I use incantations  myself, as this good brotherhood are aware--but only on occasions  of moment.\"    When it comes to sarcasming, I reckon I know how to keep my end up.  That jab made this fellow squirm.  The abbot inquired after the  queen and the court, and got this information:    \"They be all on sleep, being overcome by fatigue, like as to the king.\"    I said:    \"That is merely another lie.  Half of them are about their amusements,  the queen and the other half are not sleeping, they ride.  Now  perhaps you can spread yourself a little, and tell us where the king  and queen and all that are this moment riding with them are going?\"    \"They sleep now, as I said; but on the morrow they will ride,  for they go a journey toward the sea.\"    \"And where will they be the day after to-morrow at vespers?\"    \"Far to the north of Camelot, and half their journey will be done.\"    \"That is another lie, by the space of a hundred and fifty miles.  Their journey will not be merely half done, it will be all done,  and they will be _here_, in this valley.\"    _That_ was a noble shot!  It set the abbot and the monks in a whirl  of excitement, and it rocked the enchanter to his base.  I followed  the thing right up:    \"If the king does not arrive, I will have myself ridden on a rail:  if he does I will ride you on a rail instead.\"    Next day I went up to the telephone office and found that the king  had passed through two towns that were on the line.  I spotted  his progress on the succeeding day in the same way.  I kept these  matters to myself.  The third day's reports showed that if he  kept up his gait he would arrive by four in the afternoon.  There  was still no sign anywhere of interest in his coming; there seemed  to be no preparations making to receive him in state; a strange  thing, truly.  Only one thing could explain this: that other  magician had been cutting under me, sure.  This was true.  I asked  a friend of mine, a monk, about it, and he said, yes, the magician  had tried some further enchantments and found out that the court  had concluded to make no journey at all, but stay at home.  Think  of that!  Observe how much a reputation was worth in such a country.  These people had seen me do the very showiest bit of magic in  history, and the only one within their memory that had a positive  value, and yet here they were, ready to take up with an adventurer  who could offer no evidence of his powers but his mere unproven word.    However, it was not good politics to let the king come without  any fuss and feathers at all, so I went down and drummed up a  procession of pilgrims and smoked out a batch of hermits and  started them out at two o'clock to meet him.  And that was the  sort of state he arrived in.  The abbot was helpless with rage  and humiliation when I brought him out on a balcony and showed  him the head of the state marching in and never a monk on hand to  offer him welcome, and no stir of life or clang of joy-bell to glad  his spirit.  He took one look and then flew to rouse out his forces.  The next minute the bells were dinning furiously, and the various  buildings were vomiting monks and nuns, who went swarming in a  rush toward the coming procession; and with them went that magician  --and he was on a rail, too, by the abbot's order; and his reputation  was in the mud, and mine was in the sky again.  Yes, a man can  keep his trademark current in such a country, but he can't sit  around and do it; he has got to be on deck and attending to business  right along.        CHAPTER XXV    A COMPETITIVE EXAMINATION    When the king traveled for change of air, or made a progress, or  visited a distant noble whom he wished to bankrupt with the cost  of his keep, part of the administration moved with him.  It was  a fashion of the time.  The Commission charged with the examination  of candidates for posts in the army came with the king to the  Valley, whereas they could have transacted their business just  as well at home.  And although this expedition was strictly a  holiday excursion for the king, he kept some of his business  functions going just the same.  He touched for the evil, as usual;  he held court in the gate at sunrise and tried cases, for he was  himself Chief Justice of the King's Bench.    He shone very well in this latter office.  He was a wise and humane  judge, and he clearly did his honest best and fairest,--according  to his lights.  That is a large reservation.  His lights--I mean  his rearing--often colored his decisions.  Whenever there was a  dispute between a noble or gentleman and a person of lower degree,  the king's leanings and sympathies were for the former class always,  whether he suspected it or not.  It was impossible that this should  be otherwise.  The blunting effects of slavery upon the slaveholder's  moral perceptions are known and conceded, the world over; and a  privileged class, an aristocracy, is but a band of slaveholders  under another name.  This has a harsh sound, and yet should not  be offensive to any--even to the noble himself--unless the fact  itself be an offense: for the statement simply formulates a fact.  The repulsive feature of slavery is the _thing_, not its name.  One  needs but to hear an aristocrat speak of the classes that are below  him to recognize--and in but indifferently modified measure  --the very air and tone of the actual slaveholder; and behind these  are the slaveholder's spirit, the slaveholder's blunted feeling.  They are the result of the same cause in both cases: the possessor's  old and inbred custom of regarding himself as a superior being.  The king's judgments wrought frequent injustices, but it was merely  the fault of his training, his natural and unalterable sympathies.  He was as unfitted for a judgeship as would be the average mother  for the position of milk-distributor to starving children in  famine-time; her own children would fare a shade better than the rest.    One very curious case came before the king.  A young girl, an  orphan, who had a considerable estate, married a fine young fellow  who had nothing.  The girl's property was within a seigniory held  by the Church.  The bishop of the diocese, an arrogant scion of  the great nobility, claimed the girl's estate on the ground that  she had married privately, and thus had cheated the Church out  of one of its rights as lord of the seigniory--the one heretofore  referred to as le droit du seigneur.  The penalty of refusal or  avoidance was confiscation.  The girl's defense was, that the  lordship of the seigniory was vested in the bishop, and the  particular right here involved was not transferable, but must be  exercised by the lord himself or stand vacated; and that an older  law, of the Church itself, strictly barred the bishop from exercising  it.  It was a very odd case, indeed.    It reminded me of something I had read in my youth about the  ingenious way in which the aldermen of London raised the money  that built the Mansion House.
