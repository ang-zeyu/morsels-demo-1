If we stay here, the Blacks might come this way and their  dingo dogs hunt us to death. To get to a safe place we must pass their  camp. That is a little risky, but we must go that way. We can do this  easily if the dogs don't get scent of us, as all the Blacks are prancing  about and making a noise, having a kind of game in fact, and they are so  amused that we ought to get past quite safely. I've done it many times  before at night.\"    Dot looked round to say good-bye to the Koala, but the little animal had  heard the Kangaroo speak of Blacks, and that word suggested to its empty  little head that it must keep its skin whole, so, without waiting to be  polite to Dot, it had sneaked up its gum tree and was well out of sight.    Without wasting time, Dot settled in the Kangaroo's pouch, and they  started upon their perilous way.    For some distance the Kangaroo hopped along boldly, with an occasional  warning to Dot to shut her eyes as they plunged through the bushes; but  after crossing a watercourse, and climbing a stiff hill, she whispered  that they must both keep quite silent, and told Dot to listen as she  stopped for a moment.    Dot could hear to their right a murmuring of voices, and a steady  beating sound. \"Their camp is over there,\" said the Kangaroo, \"that is  the sound of their game.\"    \"Can't we go some other way?\" asked Dot. \"No,\" answered the Kangaroo,  \"because past that place we can reach some very wild country where it  would be hard for them to pursue us. We shall have to pass quite close  to their playground.\" So in perfect silence they went on.    [Illustration: THE CORROBOREE]    The Kangaroo seemed to Dot to approach the whereabouts of the  Blackfellows as cautiously as when they had visited the water-hole the  first night. Dot's little heart beat fast as the sound of the Blacks'  corroboree became clearer and clearer, and they neared the scene of the  dance. Soon she could hear the stamping of feet, the beating of weapons  together, and the wild chanting; and sometimes there were the whimpering  of dogs, and the cry of children at the camp a little distance from the  corroboree ground.    The Kangaroo showed no signs of fear at the increasing noise of the  Blacks, but every sound of a dog caused it to stop and twist about its  big ears and sensitive nose, as it sniffed and listened.    Soon Dot could see a great red glare of firelight through the trees  ahead of their track, and she knew that in that place the tribe of Black  men were having a festive dance.    If they had gone on their way it is possible that they would have  slipped past the Blacks without danger. But although the Kangaroo is as  timid an animal as any in the bush, it is also very curious, and Dot's  Kangaroo wished to peep at the corroboree. She whispered to Dot that it  would be nice for a little Human to see some other Humans after being so  long amongst bush creatures, and said, also, that there would be no  great danger in hopping to a rock that would command a view of the open  ground where the corroboree was being held. Of course Dot thought this  would be great fun, so the Kangaroo took her to the rock, where they  peeped through the trees and saw before them the weird scene and dance.    Dot nearly screamed with fright at the sight. She had thought she would  see a few Black folk, not a crowd of such terrible people as she beheld.  They did not look like human beings at all, but like dreadful demons,  they were so wicked and ugly in appearance. The men who were dancing  were without clothes, but their black bodies were painted with red and  white stripes, and bits of down and feathers were stuck on their skin.  Some had only white stripes over the places where their bones were,  which made them look like skeletons flitting before the fire, or in and  out of the surrounding darkness. The dancing men were divided from the  rest of the tribe by a row of fires, which, burning brightly, lit the  horrid scene with a lurid red light. The firelight seemed to make the  ferocious faces of the tribe still more hideous. The tribe people were  squatting in rows on the ground, beating boomerangs and spears together,  or striking bags of skin with sticks, to make an accompaniment to the  wailing song they sang. Sometimes the women would cease beating the skin  bags to clap their hands and strike their sides, yelling the words of  the corroboree song, as the painted figures, like fiends and skeletons,  danced before the row of fires.    It was a terrifying sight to Dot. \"Oh, Kangaroo!\" she whispered, \"they  are dreadful, horrid creatures.\"    \"They're just Humans,\" replied the Kangaroo, indulgently.    \"But white Humans are not like that,\" said Dot.    \"All Humans are the same underneath, they all kill kangaroos,\" said the  Kangaroo. \"Look there! they are playing at killing us in their dance.\"    Dot looked once more at the hideous figures as they left the fire and  began acting like actors. One of the Blackfellows had come from a little  bower of trees, and wore a few skins so arranged as to make him look as  much like a kangaroo as possible, whilst he worked a stick which he  pretended was a kangaroo's tail, and hopped about. The other painted  savages were creeping in and out of the bushes with their spears and  boomerangs as if they were hunting, and the dressed-up kangaroo made  believe not to see them, but stooped down, nibbling grass.    \"What an idea of a kangaroo!\" sniffed Dot's friend, \"why, a real  kangaroo would have smelt or heard those Humans, and have bounded away  far out of sight by now.\"    \"But it's all sham,\" said Dot; \"the Black man couldn't be a real  kangaroo.\"    \"Then it just shows how stupid Humans are to try and be one,\" said her  friend. \"Humans think themselves so clever,\" she continued, \"but just  see what bad kangaroos they make--such a simple thing to do, too! But  their legs bend the wrong way for jumping, and that stick isn't any good  for a tail, and it has to be worked with those big, clumsy arms. Just  see, too, how those skins fit! Why it's enough to make a kangaroo's  sides split with laughter to see such foolery!\" Dot's friend peeped at  the Black's acting with the contempt to be expected of a real kangaroo,  who saw human beings pretending to be one of those noble animals. Dot  thought the Kangaroo had never looked so grand before. She was so tall,  so big, and yet so graceful: a really beautiful creature.    \"Well, that's over!\" remarked the Kangaroo, as one of the Blacks  pretended to spear the dressed-up Blackfellow, and all the rest began to  dance around, whilst the sham kangaroo made believe to be dead. \"Well, I  forgive their killing such a silly creature! There wasn't a jump in it.\"    After more dancing to the singing and noise of the on-lookers, a  Blackfellow came from the little bower in the dim background, with a  battered straw hat on, and a few rags tied round his neck and wrist, in  imitation of a collar and cuffs. The fellow tried to act the part of a  white man, although he had no more clothes on than the old hat and rags.  But, after a great deal of dancing, he strutted about, pulled up the rag  collar, made a great fuss with his rag cuffs, and kept taking off his  old straw hat to the other Blackfellows, and to the rest of the tribe,  who kept up the noise on the other side of the fires.    \"Now this is better!\" said the Kangaroo, with a smile. \"It's very silly,  but Willy Wagtail says that is just the way Humans go on in the town.  Black Humans can act being white Humans, but they are of no good as  kangaroos.\"    Dot thought that if men behaved like that in towns it must be very  strange. She had not seen any like the acting Blackfellow at her cottage  home. But she did not say anything, for it was quite clear in her little  mind that Blackfellows, kangaroos, and willy wagtails had a very poor  opinion of white people. She felt that they must all be wrong; but, all  the same, she sometimes wished she could be a noble kangaroo, and not a  despised human being.    \"I wish I were not a little white girl,\" she whispered to the Kangaroo.    The gentle animal patted her kindly with her delicate black hands.    \"You are as nice now as my baby kangaroo,\" she said sadly, \"but you will  have to grow into a real white Human. For some reason there have to be  all sorts of creatures on the earth. There are hawks, snakes, dingoes  and humans, and no one can tell for what good they exist. They must have  dropped on to this world by mistake for another, where there could only  have been themselves. After all,\" said the kind animal, \"it wouldn't do  for every one to be a kangaroo, for I doubt if there would be enough  grass; but you may become an improved Human.\"    \"How could I be that?\" asked Dot, eagerly.    \"Never wear kangaroo leather boots--never use kangaroo skin rugs,  and,\"--here it hesitated a little, as though the subject were a most  unpleasant one to mention.    \"Never do what?\" enquired Dot, anxious to know all that she should do,  so as to be improved.    \"Never, never eat kangaroo-tail soup!\" said the Kangaroo, solemnly.    \"I never will,\" said Dot, earnestly, \"I will be an improved Human.\"    This conversation had been so serious to both Dot and the Kangaroo, that  they had quite forgotten the perilousness of their position. Perhaps  this was because the kangaroo cannot think, but it quickly jumped to the  conclusion that they were in danger.    Whilst they had been peeping at the corroboree, and talking, the dingo  dogs that had been prowling around the camp, had caught scent of the  Kangaroo; and, following the trail, had set up an angry snapping and  howling.    The instant this sound was heard by the Kangaroo, she made an immense  bound, and as she seemed to fly through the bush, Dot could hear the  sounds of the corroboree give place to a noise of shouting and disorder:  the dingo dogs and the Blacks were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18900"],[0,"A Text-Book of the History of Painting (#10)"],[1,"painting, but Italian painting had no father. Cimabue was simply a man  of more originality and ability than his contemporaries, and departed  further from the art teachings of the time without decidedly opposing  them. He retained the Byzantine pattern, but loosened the lines of  drapery somewhat, turned the head to one side, infused the figure with  a little appearance of life. His contemporaries elsewhere in Italy  were doing the same thing, and none of them was any more than a link  in the progressive chain.    Cimabue's pupil, Giotto (1266?-1337), was a great improver on all his  predecessors because he was a man of extraordinary genius. He would  have been great in any time, and yet he was not great enough to throw  off wholly the Byzantine traditions. He tried to do it. He studied  nature in a general way, changed the type of face somewhat by making  the jaw squarer, and gave it expression and nobility. To the figure he  gave more motion, dramatic gesture, life. The drapery was cast in  broader, simpler masses, with some regard for line, and the form and  movement of the body were somewhat emphasized through it. In methods  Giotto was more knowing, but not essentially different from his  contemporaries; his subjects were from the common stock of religious  story; but his imaginative force and invention were his own. Bound by  the conventionalities of his time he could still create a work of  nobility and power. He came too early for the highest achievement. He  had genius, feeling, fancy, almost everything except accurate  knowledge of the laws of nature and art. His art was the best of its  time, but it still lacked, nor did that of his immediate followers go  much beyond it technically.    Taddeo Gaddi (1300?-1366?) was Giotto's chief pupil, a painter of much  feeling, but lacking in the large elements of construction and in the  dramatic force of his master. Agnolo Gaddi (1333?-1396?), Antonio  Veneziano (1312?-1388?), Giovanni da Milano (fl. 1366), Andrea da  Firenze (fl. 1377), were all followers of the Giotto methods, and were  so similar in their styles that their works are often confused and  erroneously attributed. Giottino (1324?-1357?) was a supposed imitator  of Giotto, of whom little is known. Orcagna (1329?-1376?) still  further advanced the Giottesque type and method. He gathered up and  united in himself all the art teachings of his time. In working out  problems of form and in delicacy and charm of expression he went  beyond his predecessors. He was a many-sided genius, knowing not only  in a matter of natural appearance, but in color problems, in  perspective, shadows, and light. His art was further along toward the  Renaissance than that of any other Giottesque. He almost changed the  character of painting, and yet did not live near enough to the  fifteenth century to accomplish it completely. Spinello Aretino  (1332?-1410?) was the last of the great Giotto followers. He carried  out the teachings of the school in technical features, such as  composition, drawing, and relief by color rather than by light, but he  lacked the creative power of Giotto. In fact, none of the Giottesque  can be said to have improved upon the master, taking him as a whole.  Toward the beginning of the fifteenth century the school rather  declined.    SIENNESE SCHOOL: The art teachings and traditions of the past seemed  deeper rooted at Sienna than at Florence. Nor was there so much  attempt to shake them off as at Florence. Giotto broke the immobility  of the Byzantine model by showing the draped figure in action. So also  did the Siennese to some extent, but they cared more for the  expression of the spiritual than the beauty of the natural. The  Florentines were robust, resolute, even a little coarse at times; the  Siennese were more refined and sentimental. Their fancy ran to  sweetness of face rather than to bodily vigor. Again, their art was  more ornate, richer in costume, color, and detail than Florentine art;  but it was also more finical and narrow in scope.    [Illustration: FIG. 24.--A. LORENZETTI. PEACE (DETAIL). TOWN-HALL,  SIENNA.]    There was little advance upon Byzantinism in the work of Guido da  Sienna (fl. 1275). Even Duccio (1260?----?), the real founder of the  Siennese school, retained Byzantine methods and adopted the school  subjects, but he perfected details of form, such as the hands and  feet, and while retaining the long Byzantine face, gave it a  melancholy tenderness of expression. He possessed no dramatic force,  but had a refined workmanship for his time--a workmanship perhaps  better, all told, than that of his Florentine contemporary, Cimabue.  Simone di Martino (1283?-1344?) changed the type somewhat by rounding  the form. His drawing was not always correct, but in color he was good  and in detail exact and minute. He probably profited somewhat by the  example of Giotto.    The Siennese who came the nearest to Giotto's excellence were the  brothers Ambrogio (fl. 1342) and Pietro (fl. 1350) Lorenzetti. There  is little known about them except that they worked together in a  similar manner. The most of their work has perished, but what remains  shows an intellectual grasp equal to any of the age. The Sienna  frescos by Ambrogio Lorenzetti are strong in facial character, and  some of the figures, like that of the white-robed Peace, are beautiful  in their flow of line. Lippo Memmi (?-1356), Bartolo di Fredi  (1330-1410), and Taddeo di Bartolo (1362-1422), were other painters of  the school. The late men rather carried detail to excess, and the  school grew conventional instead of advancing.    TRANSITION PAINTERS: Several painters, Starnina (1354-1413), Gentile  da Fabriano (1360?-1440?), Fra Angelico (1387-1455), have been put  down in art history as the makers of the transition from Gothic to  Renaissance painting. They hardly deserve the title. There was no  transition. The development went on, and these painters, coming late  in the fourteenth century and living into the fifteenth, simply showed  the changing style, the advance in the study of nature and the technic  of art. Starnina's work gave strong evidence of the study of form, but  it was no such work as Masaccio's. There is always a little of the  past in the present, and these painters showed traces of Byzantinism  in details of the face and figure, in coloring, and in gold embossing.    Gentile had all that nicety of finish and richness of detail and color  characteristic of the Siennese. Being closer to the Renaissance than  his predecessors he was more of a nature student. He was the first man  to show the effect of sunlight in landscape, the first one to put a  gold sun in the sky. He never, however, outgrew Gothic methods and  really belongs in the fourteenth century. This is true of Fra  Angelico. Though he lived far into the Early Renaissance he did not  change his style and manner of work in conformity with the work of  others about him. He was the last inheritor of the Giottesque  traditions. Religious sentiment was the strong feature of his art. He  was behind Giotto and Lorenzetti in power and in imagination, and  behind Orcagna as a painter. He knew little of light, shade,  perspective, and color, and in characterization was feeble, except in  some late work. One face or type answered him for all classes of  people--a sweet, fair face, full of divine tenderness. His art had  enough nature in it to express his meanings, but little more. He was  pre-eminently a devout painter, and really the last of the great  religionists in painting.    [Illustration: FIG. 25.--FRA ANGELICO. ANGEL (DETAIL).
