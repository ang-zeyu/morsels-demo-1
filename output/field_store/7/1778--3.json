The Influence of Religion    Apart from this, the influence of Confucianism would have been even  greater than it was, but for the imperial partiality periodically  shown for rival doctrines, such as Buddhism and Taoism, which threw  their weight on the side of the supernatural, and which at times  were exalted to such great heights as to be officially recognized as  State religions. These, Buddhism especially, appealed to the popular  imagination and love of the marvellous. Buddhism spoke of the future  state and the nature of the gods in no uncertain tones. It showed  men how to reach the one and attain to the other. Its founder was  virtuous; his commandments pure and life-sustaining. It supplied in  great part what Confucianism lacked. And, as in the fifth and sixth  centuries A.D., when Buddhism and Taoism joined forces and a working  union existed between them, they practically excluded for the time  all the \"chilly growth of Confucian classicism.\"    Other opponents of myth, including a critical philosopher of great  ability, we shall have occasion to notice presently.      History and Myth    The sobriety and accuracy of Chinese historians is proverbial. I  have dilated upon this in another work, and need add here only what  I inadvertently omitted there--a point hitherto unnoticed or at least  unremarked--that the very word for history in Chinese (_shih_) means  impartiality or an impartial annalist. It has been said that where  there is much myth there is little history, and _vice versa_, and  though this may not be universally true, undoubtedly the persistently  truthful recording of facts, events, and sayings, even at the risk  of loss, yea, and actual loss of life of the historian as the result  of his refusal to make false entries in his chronicle at the bidding  of the emperor (as in the case of the historiographers of Ch'i in  547 B.C.), indicates a type of mind which would require some very  strong stimulus to cause it to soar very far into the hazy realms of  fanciful imagination.      Chinese Rigidity    A further cause, already hinted at above, for the arrest of  intellectual progress is to be found in the growth of the nation  in size during many centuries of isolation from the main stream  of world-civilization, without that increase in heterogeneity  which comes from the moulding by forces external to itself. \"As  iron sharpeneth iron, so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his  friend.\" Consequently we find China what is known to sociology as an  'aggregate of the first order,' which during its evolution has parted  with its internal life-heat without absorbing enough from external  sources to enable it to retain the plastic condition necessary to  further, or at least rapid, development. It is in a state of rigidity,  a state recognized and understood by the sociologist in his study of  the evolution of nations.      The Prerequisites to Myth    But the mere increase of constructive imagination is not sufficient  to produce myth. If it were, it would be reasonable to argue that  as intellectual progress goes on myths become more numerous, and the  greater the progress the greater the number of myths. This we do not  find. In fact, if constructive imagination went on increasing without  the intervention of any further factor, there need not necessarily be  any myth at all. We might almost say that the reverse is the case. We  connect myth with primitive folk, not with the greatest philosophers  or the most advanced nations--not, that is, with the most advanced  stages of national progress wherein constructive imagination makes  the nation great and strong. In these stages the philosopher studies  or criticizes myth, he does not make it.    In order that there may be myth, three further conditions must be  fulfilled. There must, as we have seen, be constructive imagination,  but, nevertheless, there must not be too much of it. As stated above,  mythology, or rather myth, is the _unscientific_ man's explanation. If  the constructive imagination is so great that it becomes self-critical,  if the story-teller doubts his own story, if, in short, his mind is  scientific enough to see that his explanation is no explanation at all,  then there can be no myth properly so called. As in religion, unless  the myth-maker believes in his myth with all his heart and soul and  strength, and each new disciple, as it is cared for and grows under  his hands during the course of years, holds that he must put his shoes  from off his feet because the place whereon he treads is holy ground,  the faith will not be propagated, for it will lack the vital spark  which alone can make it a living thing.      Stimulus Necessary    The next condition is that there must be a stimulus. It is not ideas,  but feelings, which govern the world, and in the history of mythology  where feeling is absent we find either weak imitation or repetition  of the myths of other peoples (though this must not be confused  with certain elements which seem to be common to the myths of all  races), or concoction, contamination, or \"genealogical tree-making,\"  or myths originated by \"leisurely, peaceful tradition\" and lacking  the essential qualities which appeal to the human soul and make their  possessors very careful to preserve them among their most loved and  valued treasures. But, on the other hand, where feeling is stirred,  where the requisite stimulus exists, where the people are in great  danger, or allured by the prize of some breathless adventure, the  contact produces the spark of divine poetry, the myths are full of  artistic, philosophic, and religious suggestiveness, and have abiding  significance and charm. They are the children, the poetic fruit, of  great labour and serious struggles, revealing the most fundamental  forces, hopes, and cravings of the human soul. Nations highly strung,  undergoing strenuous emotion, intensely energized by constant conflict  with other nations, have their imagination stimulated to exceptional  poetic creativeness. The background of the Danaids is Egyptian,  not Greek, but it was the danger in which the Greeks were placed in  their wars with the sons of the land of the Pharaohs that stimulated  the Greek imagination to the creation of that great myth.    This explains why so many of the greatest myths have their staging,  not in the country itself whose treasured possessions they are, but  where that country is 'playing the great game,' is carrying on wars  decisive of far-reaching national events, which arouse to the greatest  pitch of excitement the feelings both of the combatants and of those  who are watching them from their homes. It is by such great events,  not by the romance-writer in his peaceful study, that mythology, like  literature, is \"incisively determined.\" Imagination, we saw, goes  _pari passu_ with intellectual progress, and intellectual progress,  in early times, is furthered not so much by the mere contact as  by the actual conflict of nations. And we see also that myths may,  and very frequently do, have a character quite different from that  of the nation to which they appertain, for environment plays a most  important part both in their inception and subsequent growth--a truth  too obvious to need detailed elaboration.      Persistent Soul-expression    A third condition is that the type of imagination must be persistent  through fairly long periods of time, otherwise not only will there  be an absence of sufficient feeling or momentum to cause the myths  to be repeated and kept alive and transmitted to posterity, but the  inducement to add to them and so enable them to mature and become  complete and finished off and sufficiently attractive to appeal to  the human mind in spite of the foreign character they often bear will  be lacking. In other words, myths and legends grow. They resemble not  so much the narrative of the story-teller or novelist as a gradually  developing art like music, or a body of ideas like philosophy. They  are human and natural, though they express the thought not of any one  individual mind, but of the folk-soul, exemplifying in poetical form  some great psychological or physiographical truth.      The Character of Chinese Myth    The nature of the case thus forbids us to expect to find the Chinese  myths exhibiting the advanced state and brilliant heterogeneity of  those which have become part of the world's permanent literature. We  must expect them to be true to type and conditions, as we expect the  other ideas of the Chinese to be, and looking for them in the light  of this knowledge we shall find them just where we should expect to  find them.    The great sagas and eddas exalted among the world's literary  masterpieces, and forming part of the very life of a large number of  its inhabitants, are absent in China. \"The Chinese people,\" says one  well-known sinologist, \"are not prone to mythological invention.\" \"He  who expects to find in Tibet,\" says another writer, \"the poetical  charm of Greek or Germanic mythology will be disappointed. There is  a striking poverty of imagination in all the myths and legends. A  great monotony pervades them all. Many of their stories, taken from  the sacred texts, are quite puerile and insipid. It may be noted  that the Chinese mythology labours under the same defect.\" And  then there comes the crushing judgment of an over-zealous Christian  missionary sinologist: \"There is no hierarchy of gods brought in to  rule and inhabit the world they made, no conclave on Mount Olympus,  nor judgment of the mortal soul by Osiris, no transfer of human love  and hate, passions and hopes, to the powers above; all here is ascribed  to disembodied agencies or principles, and their works are represented  as moving on in quiet order. There is no religion [!], no imagination;  all is impassible, passionless, uninteresting.... It has not, as in  Greece and Egypt, been explained in sublime poetry, shadowed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15255"],[0,"Hinduism and Buddhism, An Historical Sketch, Vol. 1 (#10)"],[1,"tends towards conciliating contemporary orthodoxy, for it now prohibits  the slaughter of cattle, accords a partial recognition to caste, affirms  its belief in karma and apparently approves a form of the Yoga  philosophy. Though it is not yet accepted as a form of orthodox  Hinduism, it seems probable that concessions on both sides will produce  this result before long. It numbers at present only about a quarter of a  million but is said to be rapidly increasing, especially in the United  Provinces and Panjab, and to be remarkable for the completeness and  efficiency of its organization. It maintains missionary colleges,  orphanages and schools. Affiliated to it is a society for the  purification (shuddhi) of Mohammedans, Christians and outcasts, that is  for turning them into Hindus and giving them some kind of caste. It  would appear that those who undergo this purification do not always  become members of the Samaj but are merged in the ordinary Hindu  community where they are accepted without opposition if also without  enthusiasm.      10. _Change and Permanence in Buddhism_    Thus we have a record of Indian thought for about 3000 years. It has  directly affected such distant points as Balkh, Java and Japan and it is  still living and active. But life and action mean change and such wide  extension in time and space implies variety. We talk of converting  foreign countries but the religion which is transplanted also undergoes  conversion or else it cannot enter new brains and hearts. Buddhism in  Ceylon and Japan, Christianity in Scotland and Russia are not the same,  although professing to reverence the same teachers. It is easy to argue  the other way, but it can only be done by setting aside as non-essential  differences of great practical importance. Europeans are ready enough to  admit that Buddhism is changeable and easily corrupted but it is not  singular in that respect[31]. I doubt if Lhasa and Tantrism are further  from the teaching of Gotama than the Papacy, the Inquisition, and the  religion of the German Emperor, from the teaching of Christ.    A religion is the expression of the thought of a particular age and  cannot really be permanent in other ages which have other thoughts. The  apparent permanence of Christianity is due first to the suppression of  much original teaching, such as Christ's turning the cheek to the smiter  and Paul's belief in the coming end of the world, and secondly to the  adoption of new social ideals which have no place in the New Testament,  such as the abolition of slavery and the improved status of women.    Buddhism arising out of Brahmanism suggests a comparison with  Christianity arising out of Judaism, but the comparison breaks down in  most points of detail. But there is one real resemblance, namely that  Buddhism and Christianity have both won their greatest triumphs outside  the land of their birth. The flowers of the mind, if they can be  transplanted at all, often flourish with special vigour on alien soil.  Witness the triumphs of Islam in the hands of the Turks and Mughals, the  progress of Nestorianism in Central Asia, and the spread of Manichaeism  in both the East and West outside the limits of Persia. Even so Lamaism  in Tibet and Amidism in Japan, though scholars may regard them as  singular perversions, have more vitality than any branch of Buddhism  which has existed in India since the seventh century. But even here the  parallel with Christian sects is imperfect. It would be more complete if  Palestine had been the centre from which different phases of  Christianity radiated during some twelve centuries, for this is the  relation between Indian and foreign Buddhism. Lamaism is not the  teaching of the Buddha travestied by Tibetans but a late form of Indian  Buddhism exported to Tibet and modified there in some external features  (such as ecclesiastical organization and art) but not differing greatly  in doctrine from Bengali Buddhism of the eleventh century. And even  Amidism appears to have originated not in the Far East but in Gandhara  and the adjacent lands. Thus the many varieties of Buddhism now existing  are due partly to local colour but even more to the workings of the  restless Hindu mind which during many centuries after the Christian era  continued to invent for it novelties in metaphysics and mythology.    The preservation of a very ancient form of Buddhism in Ceylon[32] is  truly remarkable, for if in many countries Buddhism has shown itself  fluid and protean, it here manifests a stability which can hardly be  paralleled except in Judaism. The Sinhalese, unlike the Hindus, had no  native propensity to speculation. They were content to classify,  summarize and expound the teaching of the Pitakas without restating it  in the light of their own imagination. Whereas the most stable form of  Christianity is the Church of Rome, which began by making considerable  additions to the doctrine of the New Testament, the most stable form of  Buddhism is neither a transformation of the old nor a protest against  innovation but simply the continuation of a very ancient sect in strange  lands[33]. This ancient Buddhism, like Islam which is also simple and  stable, is somewhat open to the charge of engaging in disputes about  trivial details[34], but alike in Ceylon, Burma and Siam, it has not  only shown remarkable persistence but has become a truly national  religion, the glory and comfort of those who profess it.      11. _Rebirth and the Nature of the Soul_    The most characteristic doctrine of Indian religion--rarely absent in  India and imported by Buddhism into all the countries which it  influenced--is that called metempsychosis, the transmigration of the soul  or reincarnation. The last of these terms best expresses Indian,  especially Buddhist, ideas but still the usual Sanskrit equivalent,  _Samsara_, means migration. The body breaks up at death but something  passes on and migrates to another equally transitory tenement. Neither  Brahmans nor Buddhists seem to contemplate the possibility that the  human soul may be a temporary manifestation of the Eternal Spirit which  comes to an end at death--a leaf on a tree or a momentary ripple on the  water. It is always regarded as passing through many births, a wave  traversing the ocean.    Hindu speculation has never passed through the materialistic phase, and  the doctrine that the soul is annihilated at death is extremely rare in  India. Even rarer perhaps is the doctrine that it usually enters on a  permanent existence, happy or otherwise. The idea underlying the  transmigration theory is that every state which we call existence must  come to an end. If the soul can be isolated from all the accidents and  accessories attaching to it, then there may be a state of permanence and  peace but not a state comparable with human existence, however enlarged  and glorified. But why does not this conviction of impermanence lead to  the simpler conclusion that the end of physical life is the end of all  life? Because the Hindus have an equally strong conviction of  continuity: everything passes away and changes but it is not true to say  of anything that it arises from nothing or passes into nothing. If human  organisms (or any other organisms) are mere machines, if there is  nothing more to be said about a corpse than about a smashed watch, then  (the Hindu thinks) the universe is not continuous. Its continuity means  for him that there is something which eternally manifests itself in  perishable forms but does not perish with them any more than water when  a pitcher is broken or fire that passes from the wood it has consumed to  fresh fuel.    These metaphors suggest that the doctrine of transmigration or  reincarnation does not promise what we call personal immortality. I  confess that I cannot understand how there can be personality in the  ordinary human sense without a body. When we think of a friend, we think  of a body and a character, thoughts and feelings, all of them connected  with that body and many of them conditioned by it. But the immortal soul  is commonly esteemed to be something equally present in a new born babe,  a youth and an old man. If so, it cannot be a personality in the  ordinary sense, for no one could recognize the spirit of a departed  friend, if it is something which was present in him the day he was born  and different from all the characteristics which he acquired during  life. The belief that we shall recognize our friends in another world  assumes that these characteristics are immortal, but it is hard to  understand how they can be so, especially as it is also assumed that  there is nothing immortal in a dog, which possesses affection and  intelligence, but that there is something immortal in a new born infant  which cannot be said to possess either.    In one way metempsychosis raises insuperable difficulties to the  survival of personality, for if you become someone else, especially an  animal, you are no longer yourself according to any ordinary use of  language. But one of the principal forms taken by the doctrine in India  makes a modified survival intelligible. For it is held that a new born  child brings with it as a result of actions done in previous lives  certain predispositions and these after being developed and modified in  the course of that child's life are transmitted to its next existence.    As to the method of transmission there are various theories, for in  India the belief in reincarnation is not so much a dogma as an instinct  innate in all and only occasionally justified by philosophers, not  because it was disputed but because they felt bound to show that their  own systems were compatible with it. One explanation is that given by  the Vedanta philosophy, according to which the soul is accompanied in  its migrations by the _Sukshmasarira_ or subtle body, a counterpart of  the mortal body but transparent and invisible, though"]]]
