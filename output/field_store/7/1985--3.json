It  overcomes and includes all the other collective centers. Like unto the ray  of the sun, it dispels entirely the darkness encompassing all the regions,  bestows ideal life, and causes the effulgence of divine illumination.  Through the breaths of the Holy Spirit it performs miracles; the Orient  and the Occident embrace each other, the North and South become intimates  and associates, conflicting and contending opinions disappear,  antagonistic aims are brushed aside, the law of the struggle for existence  is abrogated, and the canopy of the oneness of the world of humanity is  raised on the apex of the globe, casting its shade over all the races of  men. Consequently, the real Collective Center is the body of the divine  teachings, which include all the degrees and embrace all the universal  relations and necessary laws of humanity.    4 Consider! The people of the East and the West were in the utmost  strangeness. Now to what a high degree they are acquainted with each other  and united together! How far are the inhabitants of Persia from the  remotest countries of America! And now observe how great has been the  influence of the heavenly power, for the distance of thousands of miles  has become identical with one step! How various nations that have had no  relations or similarity with each other are now united and agreed through  this divine potency! Indeed to God belongs power in the past and in the  future! And verily God is powerful over all things!    5 Consider the flowers of a garden. Though differing in kind, color, form,  and shape, yet, inasmuch as they are refreshed by the waters of one  spring, revived by the breath of one wind, invigorated by the rays of one  sun, this diversity increaseth their charm, and addeth unto their beauty.  How unpleasing to the eye if all the flowers and plants, the leaves and  blossoms, the fruits, the branches and the trees of that garden were all  of the same shape and color! Diversity of hues, form and shape, enricheth  and adorneth the garden, and heighteneth the effect thereof. In like  manner, when divers shades of thought, temperament and character, are  brought together under the power and influence of one central agency, the  beauty and glory of human perfection will be revealed and made manifest.  Naught but the celestial potency of the Word of God, which ruleth and  transcendeth the realities of all things, is capable of harmonizing the  divergent thoughts, sentiments, ideas, and convictions of the children of  men.    6 Therefore, the believers of God throughout all the republics of America,  through the divine power, must become the cause of the promotion of  heavenly teachings and the establishment of the oneness of humanity. Every  one of the important souls must arise, blowing over all parts of America  the breath of life, conferring upon the people a new spirit, baptizing  them with the fire of the love of God, the water of life, and the breaths  of the Holy Spirit so that the second birth may become realized. For it is  written in the Gospel: \"That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that  which is born of the Spirit is spirit.\"(22)    7 Therefore, O ye believers of God in the United States and Canada! Select  ye important personages, or else they by themselves, becoming severed from  rest and composure of the world, may arise and travel throughout Alaska,  the republic of Mexico, and south of Mexico in the Central American  republics, such as Guatemala, Honduras, Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica,  Panama and Belize; and through the great South American republics, such as  Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Brazil, French Guiana, Dutch Guiana, British  Guiana, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and Chile; also in the group of  the West Indies islands, such as Cuba, Haiti, Puerto Rico, Jamaica and  Santo Domingo, and the group of islands of the Lesser Antilles, the  Islands of Bahama and the Islands of Bermuda; likewise to the islands to  the east, west and north of South America, such as Trinidad, Falkland  Islands, Galapagos Islands, Juan Fernandez and Tobago. Visit ye especially  the city of Bahia, on the eastern shore of Brazil. Because in the past  years this city was christened with the name, BAHIA, there is no doubt  that it has been through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.    8 Consequently, the believers of God must display the utmost effort,  upraise the divine melody throughout those regions, promulgate the  heavenly teachings and waft over all the spirit of eternal life, so that  those republics may become so illumined with the splendors and the  effulgences of the Sun of Reality that they may become the objects of the  praise and commendation of all other countries. Likewise, ye must give  great attention to the Republic of Panama, for in that point the Occident  and the Orient find each other united through the Panama Canal, and it is  also situated between the two great oceans. That place will become very  important in the future. The teachings, once established there, will unite  the East and the West, the North and the South.    9 Hence the intention must be purified, the effort ennobled and exalted,  so that you may establish affinity between the hearts of the world of  humanity. This glorious aim will not become realized save through the  promotion of divine teachings which are the foundations of the holy  religions.    10 Consider how the religions of God served the world of humanity! How the  religion of Torah became conducive to the glory and honor and progress of  the Israelitish nation! How the breaths of the Holy Spirit of His Holiness  Christ created affinity and unity between divergent communities and  quarreling families! How the sacred power of His Holiness Muhammad became  the means of uniting and harmonizing the contentious tribes and the  different clans of Peninsular Arabia--to such an extent that one thousand  tribes were welded into one tribe; strife and discord were done away with;  all of them unitedly and with one accord strove in advancing the cause of  culture and civilization, and thus were freed from the lowest degree of  degradation, soaring toward the height of everlasting glory! Is it  possible to find a greater Collective Center in the phenomenal world than  this? In comparison to this divine Collective Center, the national  collective center, the patriotic collective center, the political  collective center and the cultural and intellectual collective center are  like child's play!    11 Now strive ye that the Collective Center of the sacred religions--for  the inculcation of which all the Prophets were manifested and which is no  other than the spirit of the divine teachings--be spread in all parts of  America, so that each one of you may shine forth from the horizon of  reality like unto the morning star, divine illumination may overcome the  darkness of nature, and the world of humanity may become enlightened. This  is the most great work! Should you become confirmed therein, this world  will become another world, the surface of the earth will become the  delectable paradise, and eternal Institutions be founded.    Let whosoever travels to different parts to teach, peruse over mountain,  desert, land and sea this supplication:    O GOD! O God! Thou seest my weakness, lowliness and humility before Thy  creatures; nevertheless, I have trusted in Thee and have arisen in the  promotion of Thy teachings among Thy strong servants, relying on Thy power  and might.    O Lord! I am a broken-winged bird and desire to soar in Thy limitless  space. How is it possible for me to do this save through Thy providence  and grace, Thy confirmation and assistance.    O Lord! Have pity on my weakness, and strengthen me with Thy power. O  Lord! Have pity on my impotence, and assist me with Thy might and majesty.    O Lord! Should the breath of the Holy Spirit confirm the weakest of  creatures, he would attain all to which he aspireth and would possess  anything he desireth. Indeed, Thou hast assisted Thy servants in the past  and, though they were the weakest of Thy creatures, the lowliest of Thy  servants and the most insignificant of those who lived upon the earth,  through Thy sanction and potency they took precedence over the most  glorious of Thy people and the most noble of mankind. Whereas formerly  they were as moths, they became as royal falcons, and whereas before they  were as brooks, they became as seas, through Thy bestowal and Thy mercy.  They became, through Thy most great favor, stars shining on the horizon of  guidance, birds singing in the rose gardens of immortality, lions roaring  in the forests of knowledge and wisdom, and whales swimming in the oceans  of life.    Verily, Thou art the Clement, the Powerful, the Mighty, and the Most  Merciful of the merciful.              FOOTNOTES          1 Qur'an 22:5.        2 Cf. Mark 16:15.        3 Cf.

It has its indirect manifestations in the gradual diffusion of the  spirit of world solidarity which is spontaneously arising out of the  welter of a disorganized society.    It would be stimulating to follow the history of the growth and  development of this lofty conception which must increasingly engage the  attention of the responsible custodians of the destinies of peoples and  nations. To the states and principalities just emerging from the welter of  the great Napoleonic upheaval, whose chief preoccupation was either to  recover their rights to an independent existence or to achieve their  national unity, the conception of world solidarity seemed not only remote  but inconceivable. It was not until the forces of nationalism had  succeeded in overthrowing the foundations of the Holy Alliance that had  sought to curb their rising power, that the possibility of a world order,  transcending in its range the political institutions these nations had  established, came to be seriously entertained. It was not until after the  World War that these exponents of arrogant nationalism came to regard such  an order as the object of a pernicious doctrine tending to sap that  essential loyalty upon which the continued existence of their national  life depended. With a vigor that recalled the energy with which the  members of the Holy Alliance sought to stifle the spirit of a rising  nationalism among the peoples liberated from the Napoleonic yoke, these  champions of an unfettered national sovereignty, in their turn, have  labored and are still laboring to discredit principles upon which their  own salvation must ultimately depend.    The fierce opposition which greeted the abortive scheme of the Geneva  Protocol; the ridicule poured upon the proposal for a United States of  Europe which was subsequently advanced, and the failure of the general  scheme for the economic union of Europe, may appear as setbacks to the  efforts which a handful of foresighted people are earnestly exerting to  advance this noble ideal. And yet, are we not justified in deriving fresh  encouragement when we observe that the very consideration of such  proposals is in itself an evidence of their steady growth in the minds and  hearts of men? In the organized attempts that are being made to discredit  so exalted a conception are we not witnessing the repetition, on a larger  scale, of those stirring struggles and fierce controversies that preceded  the birth, and assisted in the reconstruction, of the unified nations of  the West?          The Federation of Mankind      To take but one instance. How confident were the assertions made in the  days preceding the unification of the states of the North American  continent regarding the insuperable barriers that stood in the way of  their ultimate federation! Was it not widely and emphatically declared  that the conflicting interests, the mutual distrust, the differences of  government and habit that divided the states were such as no force,  whether spiritual or temporal, could ever hope to harmonize or control?  And yet how different were the conditions prevailing a hundred and fifty  years ago from those that characterize present-day society! It would  indeed be no exaggeration to say that the absence of those facilities  which modern scientific progress has placed at the service of humanity in  our time made of the problem of welding the American states into a single  federation, similar though they were in certain traditions, a task  infinitely more complex than that which confronts a divided humanity in  its efforts to achieve the unification of all mankind.    Who knows that for so exalted a conception to take shape a suffering more  intense than any it has yet experienced will have to be inflicted upon  humanity? Could anything less than the fire of a civil war with all its  violence and vicissitudes--a war that nearly rent the great American  Republic--have welded the states, not only into a Union of independent  units, but into a Nation, in spite of all the ethnic differences that  characterized its component parts? That so fundamental a revolution,  involving such far-reaching changes in the structure of society, can be  achieved through the ordinary processes of diplomacy and education seems  highly improbable. We have but to turn our gaze to humanity's  blood-stained history to realize that nothing short of intense mental as  well as physical agony has been able to precipitate those epoch-making  changes that constitute the greatest landmarks in the history of human  civilization.          The Fire of Ordeal      Great and far-reaching as have been those changes in the past, they cannot  appear, when viewed in their proper perspective, except as subsidiary  adjustments preluding that transformation of unparalleled majesty and  scope which humanity is in this age bound to undergo. That the forces of a  world catastrophe can alone precipitate such a new phase of human thought  is, alas, becoming increasingly apparent. That nothing short of the fire  of a severe ordeal, unparalleled in its intensity, can fuse and weld the  discordant entities that constitute the elements of present-day  civilization, into the integral components of the world commonwealth of  the future, is a truth which future events will increasingly demonstrate.    The prophetic voice of Baha'u'llah warning, in the concluding passages of  the Hidden Words, \"the peoples of the world\" that \"an unforeseen calamity  is following them and that grievous retribution awaiteth them\" throws  indeed a lurid light upon the immediate fortunes of sorrowing humanity.  Nothing but a fiery ordeal, out of which humanity will emerge, chastened  and prepared, can succeed in implanting that sense of responsibility which  the leaders of a new-born age must arise to shoulder.    I would again direct your attention to those ominous words of Baha'u'llah  which I have already quoted: \"And when the appointed hour is come, there  shall suddenly appear that which shall cause the limbs of mankind to  quake.\"    Has not 'Abdu'l-Baha Himself asserted in unequivocal language that  \"another war, fiercer than the last, will assuredly break out\"?    Upon the consummation of this colossal, this unspeakably glorious  enterprise--an enterprise that baffled the resources of Roman statesmanship  and which Napoleon's desperate efforts failed to achieve--will depend the  ultimate realization of that millennium of which poets of all ages have  sung and seers have long dreamed. Upon it will depend the fulfillment of  the prophecies uttered by the Prophets of old when swords shall be beaten  into ploughshares and the lion and the lamb lie down together. It alone  can usher in the Kingdom of the Heavenly Father as anticipated by the  Faith of Jesus Christ. It alone can lay the foundation for the New World  Order visualized by Baha'u'llah--a World Order that shall reflect, however  dimly, upon this earthly plane, the ineffable splendors of the Abha  Kingdom.    One word more in conclusion. The proclamation of the Oneness of  Mankind--the head corner-stone of Baha'u'llah's all-embracing dominion--can  under no circumstances be compared with such expressions of pious hope as  have been uttered in the past. His is not merely a call which He raised,  alone and unaided, in the face of the relentless and combined opposition  of two of the most powerful Oriental potentates of His day--while Himself  an exile and prisoner in their hands. It implies at once a warning and a  promise--a warning that in it lies the sole means for the salvation of a  greatly suffering world, a promise that its realization is at hand.    Uttered at a time when its possibility had not yet been seriously  envisaged in any part of the world, it has, by virtue of that celestial  potency which the Spirit of Baha'u'llah has breathed into it, come at last  to be regarded, by an increasing number of thoughtful men, not only as an  approaching possibility, but as the necessary outcome of the forces now  operating in the world.          The Mouthpiece of God      Surely the world, contracted and transformed into a single highly complex  organism by the marvellous progress achieved in the realm of physical  science, by the world-wide expansion of commerce and industry, and  struggling, under the pressure of world economic forces, amidst the  pitfalls of a materialistic civilization, stands in dire need of a  restatement of the Truth underlying all the Revelations of the past in a  language suited to its essential requirements. And what voice other than  that of Baha'u'llah--the Mouthpiece of God for this age--is capable of  effecting a transformation of society as radical as that which He has  already accomplished in the hearts of those men and women, so diversified  and seemingly irreconcilable, who constitute the body of His declared  followers throughout the world?    That such a mighty conception is fast budding out in the minds of men,  that voices are being raised in its support, that its salient features  must fast crystallize in the consciousness of those who are in authority,  few indeed can doubt. That its modest beginnings have already taken shape  in the world-wide Administration with which the adherents of the Faith of  Baha'u'llah stand associated only those whose hearts are tainted by  prejudice can fail to perceive.    Ours, dearly-beloved co-workers, is the paramount duty to continue, with  undimmed vision and unabated zeal, to assist in the final erection of that  Edifice the foundations of which Baha'u'llah has laid in our hearts, to  derive added hope and strength from the general trend of recent events,  however dark their immediate effects, and to pray with unremitting fervor  that He may hasten the approach of the realization of that Wondrous Vision  which constitutes the brightest emanation of His Mind"]]]
