[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16528"],[0,"Forty-one years in India: from subaltern to commander-in-chief (#10)"],[1,"we returned for a few days to  Srinagar, the capital of Kashmir, to enjoy the pleasures of more  civilized society. Srinagar is so well known nowadays, and has been  so often described in poetry and prose, that it is needless for me to  dwell at length upon its delights, which, I am inclined to think, are  greater in imagination than in reality. It has been called the Venice  of the East, and in some respects it certainly does remind one of the  'Bride of the Sea,' both in its picturesqueness and (when one gets  into the small and tortuous canals) its unsavouriness. Even at the  time of which I am writing it was dilapidated, and the houses looked  exactly like those made by children out of a pack of cards, which a  puff of wind might be expected to destroy. Of late years the greater  part of the city has been injured by earthquakes, and Srinagar looks  more than ever like a card city. The great beauty of the place in  those days was the wooden bridges covered with creepers, and gay with  booths and shops of all descriptions, which spanned the Jhelum at  intervals for the three miles the river runs through the town--now,  alas! for the artistic traveller, no more. Booths and shops have been  swept away, and the creepers have disappeared--decidedly an advantage  from a sanitary point of view, but destructive of the quaint  picturesqueness of the town.    The floating gardens are a unique and very pretty characteristic of  Srinagar. The lake is nowhere deeper than ten or twelve feet, and in  some places much less. These gardens are made by driving stakes into  the bed of the lake, long enough to project three or four feet above  the surface of the water. These stakes are placed at intervals in an  oblong form, and are bound together by reeds and rushes twined in and  out and across, until a kind of stationary raft is made, on which  earth and turf are piled. In this soil seeds are sown, and the crops  of melons and other fruits raised in these fertile beds are extremely  fine and abundant.    The magnificent chunar-trees are another very beautiful feature of the  country. They grow to a great height and girth, and so luxuriant and  dense is their foliage that I have sat reading and writing for hours  during heavy rain under one of these trees and kept perfectly dry.    The immediate vicinity of Srinagar is very pretty, and the whole  valley of Kashmir is lovely beyond description: surrounded by  beautifully-wooded mountains, intersected with streams and lakes, and  gay with flowers of every description, for in Kashmir many of the  gorgeous eastern plants and the more simple but sweeter ones of  England meet on common ground. To it may appropriately be applied the  Persian couplet:      'Agar fardos baru-i zamin ast, hamin ast, hamin ast'    (If there be an Elysium on earth, it is this, it is this).    The soil is extremely productive; anything will grow in it. Put a  stick into the ground, and in an extraordinary short space of time it  becomes a tree and bears fruit. What were we about, to sell such a  country for three quarters of a million sterling? It would have made  the most perfect sanatorium for our troops, and furnished an admirable  field for British enterprise and colonization, its climate being as  near perfection as anything can be.    How sad it is that, in a country 'where every prospect pleases,  only man' should be 'vile'! And man, as he existed in Kashmir, was  vile--vile, because so miserable. The Mahomedan inhabitants were being  ground down by Hindu rulers, who seized all their earnings, leaving  them barely sufficient to keep body and soul together. What interest  could such people have in cultivating their land, or doing any work  beyond what was necessary to mere existence? However hard they might  labour, their efforts would benefit neither themselves nor their  children, and so their only thought was to get through life with  as little exertion as possible--in the summer sitting in the sun  absolutely idle the greater part of the day, and in the winter wrapped  up in their blankets, under which were concealed curious little  vessels called _kangris_, holding two or three bits of live charcoal.  Every Kashmiri still carries one of these _kangris_, as the most  economical way of keeping himself warm.    Early in September we said good-bye to the happy valley and returned  to Peshawar, where I rejoined the Mountain Battery.    In November, to my great delight, I was given my jacket. At first my  happiness was somewhat damped by the fact that the troop to which I  was posted was stationed at Umballa. I did not want to leave Peshawar,  and in the end I had not to do so, as a vacancy most opportunely  occurred in one of the troops of Horse Artillery at that station,  which was given to me.    Life on the frontier in those days had a great charm for most young  men; there was always something of interest going on; military  expeditions were constantly taking place, or being speculated upon,  and one lived in hope of being amongst those chosen for active  service. Peshawar, too, notwithstanding its unhealthiness, was a  favourite station with officers. To me it was particularly pleasant,  for it had the largest force of Artillery of any station in India  except Meerut; the mess was a good one, and was composed of as nice  a set of fellows as were to be found in the army. In addition to the  officers of the regiment, there were a certain number of honorary  members; all the staff and civilians belonged to the Artillery mess,  and on guest-nights we sat down as many as sixty to dinner. Another  attraction was the 'coffee shop,' an institution which has now almost  ceased to exist, at which we all congregated after morning parade and  freely discussed the home and local news.    The troop to which I was posted was composed of a magnificent body of  men, nearly all Irishmen, most of whom could have lifted me up  with one hand. They were fine riders, and needed to be so, for the  stud-horses used for Artillery purposes at that time were not the  quiet, well-broken animals of the present day. I used to try my  hand at riding them all in turn, and thus learnt to understand and  appreciate the amount of nerve, patience, and skill necessary to  the making of a good Horse Artillery 'driver,' with the additional  advantage that I was brought into constant contact with the men. It  also qualified me to ride in the officers' team for the regimental  brake. The brake, it must be understood, was drawn by six horses, each  ridden postilion fashion by an officer.    My troop was commanded by Captain Barr, a dear old fellow who had seen  a good deal of service and was much liked by officers and men, but  hardly the figure for a Horse Artilleryman, as he weighed about  seventeen stone. On a troop parade Barr took up his position well  in advance and made his own pace, but on brigade parades he had to  conform to the movements of the other arms, and on these occasions he  used to tell one of the subalterns as he galloped past him to come  'left about' at the right time without waiting for his order. This, of  course, we were always careful to do, and by the time we had come into  action Barr had caught us up and was at his post.    During the winter of 1854-55 I had several returns of Peshawar fever,  and by the beginning of the spring I was so reduced that I was given  eight months' leave on medical certificate, with orders to report  myself at Mian Mir at its expiration, in view to my going through the  riding course, there being no Riding-Master at Peshawar.    I decided to return to Kashmir in the first instance, and thence to  march across the Himalayas to Simla.    On my way into Kashmir I was fortunate enough to fall in with a very  agreeable travelling companion--Lieutenant John Watson.[6] He was then  Adjutant of the 1st Punjab Cavalry, and was looked upon as one of  the most promising officers of the Frontier Force. We spent a very  enjoyable time in Kashmir, and early in August I started for Simla  with two brother officers named Light and Mercer, whose acquaintance  I had only recently made, but who turned out to be very pleasant  fellow-travellers.    We marched _via_ Kishtwar, Chamba, and Dharmsala, a distance of about  400 miles, through most beautiful scenery. At the last-named place I  parted from my companions, who travelled onwards to Simla by the Kulu  valley, while I took the shorter route _via_ Bilaspur.    The Simla of those days was not the busy and important place it  has since become. The Governor-General seldom visited it, and the  Commander-in-Chief only spent a summer there occasionally. When I  arrived, Sir William Gomm, the Commander-in-Chief of that day, who had  been spending the hot weather months there, was about to give up his  command, and Colonel Grant,[7] who had been his Adjutant-General, had  left not long before.    The only thing of interest to myself which occurred during the month I  remained at Simla was that I lunched with Colonel Arthur Becher, the  Quartermaster-General. I think I hear my reader say, 'Not a very  remarkable event to chronicle.' But that lunch was a memorable one to  me; indeed, it was the turning-point in my career, for my host was  good enough to say he should like to have me in his department some  day, and this meant a great deal to me. Joining a department at that  time generally resulted in remaining in it for the greater part  of one's service. There was then no limit to the tenure of staff  appointments, and the object of every ambitious young officer was to  get into one department or another--political, civil, or the army  staff. My father had always impressed upon me that the political  department was _the_ one to aspire to, and failing that, the  Quartermaster-General's, as in the latter there was the best chance of  seeing service. I had cherished a sort of vague hope that I might some  day be lucky enough to become a Deputy"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1653"],[0,"The Imitation of Christ (#10)"],[1,"and  profit in others, thou shalt too often experience loss.  If thou  seekest Jesus in all things thou shalt verily find Jesus, but if  thou seekest thyself thou shalt also find thyself, but to thine  own hurt.  For if a man seeketh not Jesus he is more hurtful to  himself than all the world and all his adversaries.    (1) Isaiah xl. 6.      CHAPTER VIII    Of the intimate love of Jesus    When Jesus is present all is well and nothing seemeth hard, but  when Jesus is not present everything is hard.  When Jesus  speaketh not within, our comfort is nothing worth, but if Jesus  speaketh but a single word great is the comfort we experience.  Did not Mary Magdalene rise up quickly from the place where she  wept when Martha said to her, The Master is come and calleth for  thee?(1)  Happy hour when Jesus calleth thee from tears to the  joy of the spirit!  How dry and hard art thou without Jesus!  How  senseless and vain if thou desirest aught beyond Jesus!  Is not  this greater loss than if thou shouldst lose the whole world?    2. What can the world profit thee without Jesus?  To be without  Jesus is the nethermost hell, and to be with Jesus is sweet  paradise.  If Jesus were with thee no enemy could hurt thee.  He  who findeth Jesus findeth a good treasure, yea, good above all  good; and he who loseth Jesus loseth exceeding much, yea, more  than the whole world.  Most poor is he who liveth without Jesus,  and most rich is he who is much with Jesus.    3. It is great skill to know how to live with Jesus, and to know  how to hold Jesus is great wisdom.  Be thou humble and peaceable  and Jesus shall be with thee.  Be godly and quiet, and Jesus will  remain with thee.  Thou canst quickly drive away Jesus and lose  His favour if thou wilt turn away to the outer things.  And if  thou hast put Him to flight and lost Him, to whom wilt thou flee,  and whom then wilt thou seek for a friend?  Without a friend thou  canst not live long, and if Jesus be not thy friend above all  thou shalt be very sad and desolate.  Madly therefore doest thou  if thou trusteth or findest joy in any other.  It is preferable  to have the whole world against thee, than Jesus offended with  thee.  Therefore of all that are dear to thee, let Jesus be  specially loved.    4. Let all be loved for Jesus' sake, but Jesus for His own.  Jesus Christ alone is to be specially loved, for He alone is  found good and faithful above all friends.  For His sake and in  Him let both enemies and friends be dear to thee, and pray for  them all that they may all know and love Him.  Never desire to be  specially praised or loved, because this belongeth to God alone,  who hath none like unto Himself.  Nor wish thou that any one set  his heart on thee, nor do thou give thyself up to the love of  any, but let Jesus be in thee and in every good man.    5. Be pure and free within thyself, and be not entangled by any  created thing.  Thou oughtest to bring a bare and clean heart to  God, if thou desirest to be ready to see how gracious the Lord  is.  And in truth, unless thou be prevented and drawn on by His  grace, thou wilt not attain to this, that having cast out and  dismissed all else, thou alone art united to God.  For when the  grace of God cometh to a man, then he becometh able to do all  things, and when it departeth then he will be poor and weak and  given up unto troubles.  In these thou art not to be cast down  nor to despair, but to rest with calm mind on the will of God,  and to bear all things which come upon thee unto the praise of  Jesus Christ; for after winter cometh summer, after night  returneth day, after the tempest a great calm.    (1) John xi. 28.      CHAPTER IX    Of the lack of all comfort    It is no hard thing to despise human comfort when divine is  present.  It is a great thing, yea very great, to be able to bear  the loss both of human and divine comfort; and for the love of  God willingly to bear exile of heart, and in nought to seek  oneself, nor to look to one's own merit.  What great matter is  it, if thou be cheerful of heart and devout when favour cometh to  thee?  That is an hour wherein all rejoice.  Pleasantly enough  doth he ride whom the grace of God carrieth.  And what marvel, if  he feeleth no burden who is carried by the Almighty, and is led  onwards by the Guide from on high?    2. We are willing to accept anything for comfort, and it is  difficult for a man to be freed from himself.  The holy martyr  Laurence overcame the love of the world and even of his priestly  master, because he despised everything in the world which seemed  to be pleasant; and for the love of Christ he calmly suffered  even God's chief priest, Sixtus, whom he dearly loved, to be  taken from him.  Thus by the love of the Creator he overcame the  love of man, and instead of human comfort he chose rather God's  good pleasure.  So also learn thou to resign any near and beloved  friend for the love of God.  Nor take it amiss when thou hast  been deserted by a friend, knowing that we must all be parted  from one another at last.    3. Mightily and long must a man strive within himself before he  learn altogether to overcome himself, and to draw his whole  affection towards God.  When a man resteth upon himself, he  easily slippeth away unto human comforts.  But a true lover of  Christ, and a diligent seeker after virtue, falleth not back upon  those comforts, nor seeketh such sweetness as may be tasted and  handled, but desireth rather hard exercises, and to undertake  severe labours for Christ.    4. When, therefore, spiritual comfort is given by God, receive it  with giving of thanks, and know that it is the gift of God, not  thy desert.  Be not lifted up, rejoice not overmuch nor foolishly  presume, but rather be more humble for the gift, more wary and  more careful in all thy doings; for that hour will pass away, and  temptation will follow.  When comfort is taken from thee, do not  straightway despair, but wait for the heavenly visitation with  humility and patience, for God is able to give thee back greater  favour and consolation.  This is not new nor strange to those who  have made trial of the way of God, for with the great saints and  the ancient prophets there was often this manner of change.    5. Wherefore one said when the favour of God was present with  him, I said in my prosperity I shall never be moved,(1) but he  goeth on to say what he felt within himself when the favour  departed: Thou didst turn Thy face from me, and I was troubled.  In spite whereof he in no wise despaireth, but the more instantly  entreateth God, and saith, Unto Thee, O Lord, will I cry, and  will pray unto my God; and then he receiveth the fruit of his  prayer, and testifieth how he hath been heard, saying, The Lord  heard me and had mercy upon me, the Lord was my helper.  But  wherein?  Thou hast turned my heaviness into joy, Thou hast put  off my sackcloth and girded me with gladness.  If it was thus  with the great saints, we who are poor and needy ought not to  despair if we are sometimes in the warmth and sometimes in the  cold, for the Spirit cometh and goeth according to the good  pleasure of His will.  Wherefore holy Job saith, Thou dost visit  him in the morning, and suddenly Thou dost prove him.(2)    6. Whereupon then can I hope, or wherein may I trust, save only  in the great mercy of God, and the hope of heavenly grace?  For  whether good men are with me, godly brethren or faithful friends,  whether holy books or beautiful discourses, whether sweet hymns  and songs, all these help but little, and have but little savour  when I am deserted by God's favour and left to mine own poverty.  There is no better remedy, then, than patience and denial of  self, and an abiding in the will of God.    7. I have never found any man so religious and godly, but that he  felt sometimes a withdrawal of the divine favour, and lack of  fervour.  No saint was ever so filled with rapture, so  enlightened, but that sooner or later he was tempted.  For he is  not worthy of the great vision of God, who, for God's sake, hath  not been exercised by some temptation.  For temptation is wont  to go before as a sign of the comfort which shall follow, and  heavenly comfort is promised to those who are proved by  temptation.  As it is written, To him that overcometh I will  give to eat of the tree of life.(3)    8. Divine comfort is given that a man may be stronger to bear  adversities.  And temptation followeth, lest he be lifted up  because of the benefit.  The devil sleepeth not; thy flesh is not  yet dead; therefore, cease thou not to make thyself ready unto  the battle, for enemies stand on thy right hand and on thy left,  and they are never at rest.    (1) Psalm xxx. 6.  (2) Job vii. 18.  (3) Revelation ii. 7.      CHAPTER X    Of gratitude for the Grace of God    Why seekest thou rest when thou art born to labour?  Prepare  thyself for patience more than for comforts, and for bearing the  cross more than for joy.  For who among the men of this world  would not gladly receive consolation and spiritual joy if he  might always have it?  For spiritual comforts exceed all the  delights of the world, and all the pleasures of the flesh.  For  all worldly delights are either empty or unclean, whilst  spiritual delights alone are pleasant and honourable, the  offspring of virtue, and poured forth by God into pure minds.  But no man can always enjoy these divine comforts at his own  will, because the season of temptation ceaseth not for long.    2. Great is the difference between a visitation from above and  false liberty of spirit and great confidence in self.  God doeth  well in giving us the grace of comfort, but man doeth ill in not  immediately giving God thanks thereof.  And thus the gifts of  grace are not able to flow unto us, because we are ungrateful to  the Author of them, and return them not wholly to the Fountain  whence they flow.  For grace ever becometh the portion of"]]]
