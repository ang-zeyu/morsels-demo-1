Solomon Dubno (1738-1813) was all his life a bee in search of flowers,  to turn their sweetness into honey. Having exhausted the knowledge of  his Volhynian instructors, he went to Galicia, where he became  proficient in Hebrew grammar and Biblical exegesis. Thence, attracted by  its rich collection of books, he left for Amsterdam, where he spent five  years in study and research. Finally he settled in Berlin, and earned a  livelihood by teaching among others the children of Mendelssohn. The  gentle disposition and profound learning of the Polish emigrant made a  favorable impression on the Berlin sage, who invited him to participate  in his translation of the Bible, which revolutionized the Judaism of the  nineteenth century more than the Septuagint that of the first century.  The result was the _Biur_ (commentary), which he, together with his  countryman, Aaron Yaroslav, also a teacher, wrote on several books of  the Bible. Comparatively few of Dubno's works have been published, but  judging from such as are known we may safely pronounce him a master of  the Massorah and a scholar of unusual attainments. Of his poems  Delitzsch says that they are \"in the truest sense Hebrew in expression,  Biblical in imagery and subject-matter, medieval in rhyme and rhythm,  and in general genuinely Jewish in manner of treatment,\"--laudation  which this exacting critic bestowed on no other Hebrew poet of his time.  It was mainly through the endeavors of Dubno that Mendelssohn's  Pentateuch, later regarded with suspicion, was everywhere bought and  studied eagerly.[23]    One better known to the outside world than Dubno, and who has engraved  his name forever on the history of theology and philosophy, was Solomon  Maimon (Nieszvicz, Lithuania, 1754--Niedersiegersdorf, Silesia, 1800).  In his famous autobiography is mirrored the lot of hundreds of his  countrymen who, like him, left their homes and hearths, their nearest  and dearest, and led a wretched and miserable existence, all because  they were anxious to be _ma'amike be-hakmah_ (\"delvers in knowledge\"),  as he himself might have said, and avail themselves of the opportunities  for acquiring the truth and wisdom unattainable in their own land.    But Maimon was doomed to suffer abroad even more than at home. He was  one of those unfortunates whose sufferings are regarded as  well-deserved. His exceptional ability was never to develop to its  fullest capacity. Great injustice has been done to him, not only by the  rabid orthodox, who denied him a grave in their cemetery, but even by  the enlightened historian Graetz. Fortunately he left behind him his  _Lebensgeschichte_, among the best of its kind in German literature, in  which, with the frankness of a Rousseau, he described the events of his  short and checkered career.[24]    From this admirable work, in which he neither hides his follies nor  flaunts his talents, we learn that Maimon possessed rare virtues. His  sympathy for the poor, his ready helpfulness even at the sacrifice of  himself, rendered him as uncommon in moral action as in philosophic  speculation. To the English reader a striking parallelism suggests  itself between him and his contemporary Oliver Goldsmith. Both were  afflicted with generosity above their fortunes; both had a \"knack at  hoping,\" which led frequently to their undoing; neither could subscribe  easily to the \"decent formalities of rigid virtue\"; and, as of the  latter we may also say of the former, in the language of a reviewer, \"He  had lights and shadows, virtues and foibles--vices you cannot call them,  be you never so unkind.\"    As Goldsmith came to London, so came Maimon to Berlin, \"without friends,  recommendation, money, or impudence.\" His only luggage was two  manuscripts: a commentary on the works of Maimuni, whose name he had  adopted, and to whom he paid divine reverence; and a treatise in which  he attempted to rationalize the recondite doctrines of the Cabbala, and  which he always kept by him \"as a monument of the struggle of the human  mind after perfection in spite of all hindrances which were put in its  way.\" The little bundle, which, to the zealot Jewish elders of that  community, seemed sufficient indication that Maimon was tainted with  heresy, and that his intentions were to devote himself to the study of  science and philosophy, proved a great impediment to entering Berlin;  and when, after a long, incredible struggle, he was finally admitted, he  found himself incapable of earning a livelihood. In his childlike  naivete he was betrayed by the very persons upon whom he relied most.  All this could not deaden his love for knowledge and truth. By chance he  obtained Wolff's _Metaphysics_, and this marked a new epoch in his life.  \"Not only the sublime science in itself,\" says he, \"but also the order  and mathematical method of the celebrated author, the precision of his  explanations, the exactness of his reasoning, and the scientific  arrangement of his expositions--all this kindled a new light in my  mind.\"    So profound a thinker could not for long be a mere pupil. Wolff's  argument _a posteriori_ for the existence of God, in accordance with his  philosophic hobby, the \"principle of sufficient reason,\" displeased him  wholly. A Hebrew letter to Mendelssohn, in which he shook the foundation  of the _Metaphysics_ by means of his irrefutable ontology, won him the  admiration of the Berlin sage, who invited him to become his daily  guest.    Maimon's intellect unfolded from day to day, until, some time  afterwards, he astonished the philosophic world by his great work, _Die  Transcendentale Philosophie_ (Berlin, 1790), in reference to which Kant  wrote to his beloved disciple Marcus Herz: \"A mere glance at it enabled  me to recognize its merits, and showed me, that not only had none of my  opponents understood me and the main problem so well, but very few could  claim so much penetration as Herr Maimon in profound inquiries of this  sort.\" He demolished the prevalent Leibnitzo-Wolffian system in it, and  proved that even the Kantian theory, though irrefutable from a dogmatic  point of view, is exposed to severe attacks from the skeptic's point of  view.    Thenceforth he became a leading figure in philosophic controversy. In  1793 he published _Ueber die Progresse der Philosophie_; in 1794,  _Versuch einer neuen Logik_, and _Die Kategorien des Aristoteles_, and,  three years later, _Kritische Untersuchungen ueber den menschlichen  Geist_ (Berlin, 1797), wherein he originated a speculative, monistic  idealism, which pervaded not only philosophy, but all sciences during  the first half of the nineteenth century, the system by which Fichte,  Schelling, and Hegel were influenced. According to Bernfeld, he was the  greatest Jewish philosopher since the time of Spinoza, with whose depth  of reasoning he combined an ease and straightforwardness of illustration  characteristic of Benjamin Franklin.[25]    With all this he remained an ardent lover of the Talmud to the last. In  fact, his philosophy is distinctively Jewish. Like Spinoza, he exhibited  the effects of the Cabbala and of rabbinic speculation, with which he  had been familiar from childhood. The honor of the Talmudic sages was  always dear to him, and he never mentioned them without expressing  profound respect. Persecuted though he was by his German coreligionists,  he never bore them a grudge. As a man he loved them as brothers, but as  a philosopher he could not subscribe to their views implicitly. But for  friends and benefactors his affection was unusually strong. With what  love he talks of Mendelssohn in the chapter dedicated to him in his  autobiography, even though \"he could not explain the persistency of  Mendelssohn and the Wolffians generally in adhering to their system,  except as a political dodge, and a piece of hypocrisy, by which they  studiously endeavored to descend to the mode of thinking common to the  popular mind!\" His devotion to his wife was not diminished even after he  had been compelled to divorce her because of his supposed heretical  proclivities. \"When the subject [of his divorce] came up in  conversation, it was easy,\" says his biographer,[26] \"to read in his  face the deep sorrow he felt: his liveliness then faded away sensibly.  By and by he would become perfectly silent, was incapable of further  entertainment, and went home earlier than usual.\" Of his Russo-Polish  brethren he speaks in the highest terms. He cannot bestow too much  praise on their care for the poor and the sick, and he always hoped once  more to see his native land, to whose king he dedicated his  _Transcendental Philosophy_. \"For,\" says he, \"the Polish Jews are,  indeed, for the most part not enlightened by science; their manners and  way of life are still rude, but they are loyal to the religion of their  fathers and to the laws of their country.\"[27]    It is because I regard him as the greatest Maskil of his time that I  have dwelt on Maimon at such length. Mendelssohn's philosophy, if he had  an original system, has long since passed into oblivion; Maimon's will  be studied as long as Spinoza, Leibnitz, and Kant are in vogue. His  importance to us does not lie in the circumstance that his  autobiography--\"that wonderful bit of Autobiography,\" as George Eliot  speaks of it, or \"that curious and rare book,\" as Dean Milman calls  it--and the pictures drawn of him by Berthold Auerbach and Israel  Zangwill[28] have made him the hero of some of the world's best  biographies and novels. Over and above this, he is the prototype of his  unfortunate countrymen during the days of transition. He embodied the  aspiration, courage, and disappointments of them all, and if, as Carlyle  said, \"the history of the world is the history of its great men,\"  Maimon's life should be studied by all interested in the Kulturkampf of  the"]]]
