It must, therefore, have had a brisk  and flourishing foreign trade at an exceedingly remote period. No  doubt numerous alien merchants were attracted to its cities, and it  may be that they induced or encouraged Semitic and other raiders to  overthrow governments and form military aristocracies, so that they  themselves might obtain necessary concessions and achieve a degree of  political ascendancy. It does not follow, however, that the peasant  class was greatly affected by periodic revolutions of this kind, which  brought little more to them than a change of rulers. The needs of the  country necessitated the continuance of agricultural methods and the  rigid observance of existing land laws; indeed, these constituted the  basis of Sumerian prosperity. Conquerors have ever sought reward not  merely in spoil, but also the services of the conquered. In northern  Babylonia the invaders apparently found it necessary to conciliate and  secure the continued allegiance of the tillers of the soil. Law and  religion being closely associated, they had to adapt their gods to  suit the requirements of existing social and political organizations.  A deity of pastoral nomads had to receive attributes which would give  him an agricultural significance; one of rural character had to be  changed to respond to the various calls of city life. Besides, local  gods could not be ignored on account of their popularity. As a result,  imported beliefs and religious customs must have been fused and  absorbed according to their bearing on modes of life in various  localities. It is probable that the complex character of certain  deities was due to the process of adjustment to which they were  subjected in new environments.    The petty kingdoms of Sumeria appear to have been tribal in origin.  Each city was presided over by a deity who was the nominal owner of  the surrounding arable land, farms were rented or purchased from the  priesthood, and pasture was held in common. As in Egypt, where we  find, for instance, the artisan god Ptah supreme at Memphis, the sun  god Ra at Heliopolis, and the cat goddess Bast at Bubastis, the  various local Sumerian and Akkadian deities had distinctive  characteristics, and similarly showed a tendency to absorb the  attributes of their rivals. The chief deity of a state was the central  figure in a pantheon, which had its political aspect and influenced  the growth of local theology. Cities, however, did not, as a rule,  bear the names of deities, which suggests that several were founded  when Sumerian religion was in its early animistic stages, and gods and  goddesses were not sharply defined from the various spirit groups.    A distinctive and characteristic Sumerian god was Ea, who was supreme  at the ancient sea-deserted port of Eridu. He is identified with the  Oannes of Berosus,[31] who referred to the deity as \"a creature  endowed with reason, with a body like that of a fish, with feet below  like those of a man, with a fish's tail\". This description recalls the  familiar figures of Egyptian gods and priests attired in the skins of  the sacred animals from whom their powers were derived, and the fairy  lore about swan maids and men, and the seals and other animals who  could divest themselves of their \"skin coverings\" and appear in human  shape. Originally Ea may have been a sacred fish. The Indian creative  gods Brahma and Vishnu had fish forms. In Sanskrit literature Manu,  the eponymous \"first man\", is instructed by the fish to build a ship  in which to save himself when the world would be purged by the rising  waters. Ea befriended in similar manner the Babylonian Noah, called  Pir-napishtim, advising him to build a vessel so as to be prepared for  the approaching Deluge. Indeed the Indian legend appears to throw  light on the original Sumerian conception of Ea. It relates that when  the fish was small and in danger of being swallowed by other fish in a  stream it appealed to Manu for protection. The sage at once lifted up  the fish and placed it in a jar of water. It gradually increased in  bulk, and he transferred it next to a tank and then to the river  Ganges. In time the fish complained to Manu that the river was too  small for it, so he carried it to the sea. For these services the god  in fish form instructed Manu regarding the approaching flood, and  afterwards piloted his ship through the weltering waters until it  rested on a mountain top.[32]    If this Indian myth is of Babylonian origin, as appears probable, it  may be that the spirit of the river Euphrates, \"the soul of the land\",  was identified with a migrating fish. The growth of the fish suggests  the growth of the river rising in flood. In Celtic folk tales high  tides and valley floods are accounted for by the presence of a \"great  beast\" in sea, loch, or river. In a class of legends, \"specially  connected with the worship of Atargatis\", wrote Professor Robertson  Smith, \"the divine life of the waters resides in the sacred fish that  inhabit them. Atargatis and her son, according to a legend common to  Hierapolis and Ascalon, plunged into the waters--in the first case the  Euphrates, in the second the sacred pool at the temple near the  town--and were changed into fishes\". The idea is that \"where a god  dies, that is, ceases to exist in human form, his life passes into the  waters where he is buried; and this again is merely a theory to bring  the divine water or the divine fish into harmony with anthropomorphic  ideas. The same thing was sometimes effected in another way by saying  that the anthropomorphic deity was born from the water, as Aphrodite  sprang from sea foam, or as Atargatis, in another form of the  Euphrates legend, ... was born of an egg which the sacred fishes found  in the Euphrates and pushed ashore.\"[33]    As \"Shar Apsi\", Ea was the \"King of the Watery Deep\". The reference,  however, according to Jastrow, \"is not to the salt ocean, but the  sweet waters flowing under the earth which feed the streams, and  through streams and canals irrigate the fields\".[34] As Babylonia was  fertilized by its rivers, Ea, the fish god, was a fertilizing deity.  In Egypt the \"Mother of Mendes\" is depicted carrying a fish upon her  head; she links with Isis and Hathor; her husband is Ba-neb-Tettu, a  form of Ptah, Osiris, and Ra, and as a god of fertility he is  symbolized by the ram. Another Egyptian fish deity was the god Rem,  whose name signifies \"to weep\"; he wept fertilizing tears, and corn  was sown and reaped amidst lamentations. He may be identical with  Remi, who was a phase of Sebek, the crocodile god, a developed  attribute of Nu, the vague primitive Egyptian deity who symbolized the  primordial deep. The connection between a fish god and a corn god is  not necessarily remote when we consider that in Babylonia and Egypt  the harvest was the gift of the rivers.    The Euphrates, indeed, was hailed as a creator of all that grew on its  banks.        O thou River who didst create all things,      When the great gods dug thee out,      They set prosperity upon thy banks,      Within thee Ea, the King of the Deep, created his dwelling...      Thou judgest the cause of mankind!      O River, thou art mighty! O River, thou art supreme!      O River, thou art righteous![35]    In serving Ea, the embodiment or the water spirit, by leading him, as  the Indian Manu led the Creator and \"Preserver\" in fish form, from  river to water pot, water pot to pond or canal, and then again to  river and ocean, the Babylonians became expert engineers and  experienced agriculturists, the makers of bricks, the builders of  cities, the framers of laws. Indeed, their civilization was a growth  of Ea worship. Ea was their instructor. Berosus states that, as  Oannes, he lived in the Persian Gulf, and every day came ashore to  instruct the inhabitants of Eridu how to make canals, to grow crops,  to work metals, to make pottery and bricks, and to build temples; he  was the artisan god--Nun-ura, \"god of the potter\"; Kuski-banda, \"god  of goldsmiths\", &c.--the divine patron of the arts and crafts. \"Ea  knoweth everything\", chanted the hymn maker. He taught the people how  to form and use alphabetic signs and instructed them in mathematics:  he gave them their code of laws. Like the Egyptian artisan god Ptah,  and the linking deity Khnumu, Ea was the \"potter or moulder of gods  and man\". Ptah moulded the first man on his potter's wheel: he also  moulded the sun and moon; he shaped the universe and hammered out the  copper sky. Ea built the world \"as an architect builds a house\".[36]  Similarly the Vedic Indra, who wielded a hammer like Ptah, fashioned  the universe after the simple manner in which the Aryans made their  wooden dwellings.[37]    Like Ptah, Ea also developed from an artisan god into a sublime  Creator in the highest sense, not merely as a producer of crops. His  word became the creative force; he named those things he desired to  be, and they came into existence. \"Who but Ea creates things\",  exclaimed a priestly poet. This change from artisan god to creator  (Nudimmud) may have been due to the tendency of early religious cults  to attach to their chief god the attributes of rivals exalted at other  centres.    Ea, whose name is also rendered Aa, was identified with Ya, Ya'u, or  Au, the Jah of the Hebrews. \"In Ya-Daganu, 'Jah is Dagon'\", writes  Professor Pinches, \"we have the elements reversed, showing a wish to  identify Jah with Dagon, rather than Dagon with Jah; whilst another  interesting name, Au-Aa, shows an identification of Jah with Aa, two  names which have every appearance of being etymologically connected.\"  Jah's name \"is one of the words for 'god' in the Assyro-Babylonian  language\".[38]    Ea was \"Enki\", \"lord of the world\", or \"lord of what is beneath\";  Amma-ana-ki, \"lord of heaven and earth\"; Sa-kalama, \"ruler of the  land\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16658"],[0,"Piano and Song (#10)"],[1,"has already been battered to pieces  by you, how far you can carry the _pianissimo_ and _fortissimo_, and  still preserve the tone within the limits of beauty and simplicity. You  will thus be able to interpret a piece with at least superficial  correctness, without mortally wounding a cultivated ear by exaggerations  and by maltreatment of the instrument and its two pedals.    This style of playing has nevertheless found its numerous defenders and  admirers in our century, which has made every thing possible. This  senseless enslavement and abuse of the piano has been said to be \"all  the rage;\" a fine expression of our piano critics to justify insane  stamping and soft-pedal sentimentality.    How far what I have here said relates to our modern errors in singing,  and how far it may be applied to them, I leave to the intelligence of my  readers and to my explanations in subsequent chapters.    To return to my theme: I have still one word on this subject for  rational players. Even they use the soft pedal too much and too often,  and at unsuitable places; for instance, in the midst of a piece, without  any preparatory pause; in melodies which require to be lightly executed;  or in rapid passages which are to be played _piano_. This is especially  to be noticed with players who are obliged to use instruments of a  powerful tone and stiff, heavy action, on which it is difficult to  insure a delicate shading in _piano_ and _forte_. For this reason, a  sensible and experienced teacher, whose sole aim is the true and the  beautiful, should make the attainment of an elastic touch and  well-grounded style of playing an indispensable requirement. I prefer  that the soft pedal should be used but seldom, and, if the pedal which  raises the dampers is used at the same time, it must be only with the  greatest nicety. The soft pedal may be used in an echo; but should be  preceded by a slight pause, and then should be employed throughout the  period, because the ear must accustom itself gradually to this tender,  maidenly, sentimental tone. There must again be a slight pause before  the transition to the usual more masculine tone, with the three strings.  The soft pedal is, moreover, most effective in slow movements with full  chords, which allow time to bring out the singing tone, in which  consists the advantage of the stroke of the hammers on two strings  alone.          CHAPTER VII.    A MUSICAL TEA-PARTY AT THE HOUSE OF JOHN SPRIGGINS.      I once more introduce my readers to the scenes of my active, musical  life, with an invitation to accompany me to a musical tea-party. My  object is, in a short and entertaining manner, to remove very common  prejudices; to correct mistaken ideas; to reprove the followers of mere  routine; to oppose to malicious cavilling the sound opinions of an  experienced teacher; to scourge dogmatic narrow-mindedness; and in this  way to advance my method of instruction.           *       *       *       *       *    DRAMATIS PERSONAE.    JOHN SPRIGGINS _(jovial and narrow-minded, a member of  an ancient musical family)._  MRS. SPRIGGINS _(irritable, envious, and malicious)._  LIZZIE, _their daughter, 13, years old (lively and pert)._  SHEPARD, _her piano-teacher (very laborious)._  DOMINIE, _a piano-master (very stern)._  EMMA, _his daughter, a pianist (silent and musical)._      MRS. SPRIGGINS (_to Dominie_). So this is your daughter who is to give a  concert to-morrow? She is said to have less talent than your eldest  daughter. With her, they say, nothing requires any labor.    DOMINIE. You must ask my eldest daughter herself about that. I have  hitherto held the opinion that both of them played correctly, musically,  and perhaps finely, and yet both differently: that is the triumph of a  musical education. But this cheap comparative criticism is already too  thoroughly worn out. Pray what else have you on your mind?    MRS. S. Have you not yet sent your younger daughter to school? They say  your eldest could neither read nor write at fourteen years of age.    DOMINIE. My daughters always have a private teacher in the house, in  connection with whom I instruct them in music, in order that their  literary education shall occupy fewer hours, and that they shall have  time left for exercise in the open air to invigorate the body; while  other children are exhausted with nine hours a day at schools and  institutes, and are obliged to pay for this with the loss of their  health and the joyousness of youth.    MRS. S. It is very well known that your daughters are obliged to play  the whole day long.    DOMINIE. And not all night too? You probably might explain their skill  in that way. I am astonished that you have not heard that too, since  you have picked up so many shocking stories about me and my daughters.    MRS. S. (_dismisses the subject, and asks suddenly_). Now just how old  is your daughter Emma?    DOMINIE. She is just sixteen years and seven weeks old.    MRS. S. Does she speak French?    DOMINIE. Oui, elle parle Francais, and in musical tones, too,--a  language which is understood all over the world.    MRS. S. But she is so silent! Does she like to play?    DOMINIE. You have given her no opportunity to speak, she is certainly  not forth-putting. For the last two years she has taken great pleasure  in playing.    MRS. S. You acknowledge, then, that formerly you had to force her to it?    DOMINIE. In the earlier years of her natural development, as she was a  stranger to vanity and other unworthy motives, she certainly played, or  rather pursued her serious studies, chiefly from obedience and habit.  Does your daughter of thirteen years old always practise her exercises  without being required to do so? Does she like to go to school every  day? Does she always sew and knit without being reminded of it?    MRS. S. (_interrupting_). Oh, I see you are quite in love with your  daughters! But they say you are terribly strict and cruel in the musical  education of your children; and, in fact, always.    DOMINIE. Do you suppose I do this from affection? or do you infer it,  because they have proved artists, or because they look so blooming and  healthy, or because they write such fine letters, or because they have  not grown crooked over embroidery, or because they are so innocent,  unaffected, and modest? or--    MRS. S. (_irritably_). We will drop that subject. But I must give you  one piece of good advice. Do not make your daughter Emma exert herself  too much, as you have done with your eldest daughter.    DOMINIE. If that is so, Mrs. Spriggins, it seems to have agreed with her  very well.    MRS. S. (_vehemently_). But she would have been better--    DOMINIE. If she had not played at all? That I can't tell exactly, as I  said yesterday. Well, you are satisfied now with Emma's state of health?    MRS. S. It is of no use to advise such people as you.    DOMINIE. I have always devoted myself to my business as a teacher, and  have daily taken counsel with myself about the education of my  daughters, and of other pupils whom I have formed for artists; and, it  must be acknowledged, I have done so with some ability.    MRS. S. (_not attending to him, but turning to Emma_). But does it not  make your fingers ache to play such difficult music?    DOMINIE. Only when her teacher raps her on the knuckles, and that I  never do.         (_Emma looks at the parrot which is hanging in the parlor, and       strokes the great bull-dog._)    JOHN SPRIGGINS (_entering with his daughter Lizzie_). Herr Dominie, will  you be so good as to hear our daughter Lizzie play, and advise us  whether to continue in the same course. Music is, in fact, hereditary in  our family. My wife played a little, too, in her youth, and I once  played on the violin; but my teacher told me I had no talent for it, no  ear, and no idea of time, and that I scraped too much.    DOMINIE. Very curious! He must have been mistaken!    JOHN S. But I always was devotedly fond of music. My father and my  grandfather, on our estate, often used to play the organ for the  organist in church, and the tenants always knew when they were playing.  My father used often to tell that story at table. Ha, ha! It was very  droll!    DOMINIE. Curious!    JOHN S. Well, to return to my violin. I gave it up after a year, because  it seemed rather scratchy to me, too.    DOMINIE. Curious! Probably your ear and your taste had become more  cultivated.    JOHN S. Afterwards, when I accepted an office, my wife said to me, \"My  dear, what a pity it is about your violin.\" So I had it restrung, and  took a teacher. It seems as if it were only yesterday.    DOMINIE (_casting down his eyes,--the servant brings ice_). That was very  curious!    JOHN S. But the government horn-player thought he could not get on in  duets with me.    DOMINIE. Curious! So you were obliged to play only solos? But to return  to your daughter. Will you be good enough to play me something, Miss  Lizzie?    MRS. S. (_condescendingly, in a low voice_). She is a little timid and  embarrassed at playing before your daughter Emma.    EMMA. You really need not be so.    MRS. S. Bring \"Les Graces\" by Herz, and Rosellen's \"Tremolo.\"    LIZZIE. But, mamma, I have forgotten that piece by Herz, and I have not  learned the \"Tremolo\" very well yet. That is always the way with me. Mr.  Shepard says I may console myself: it was always the same with his other  scholars. He says I shall finally make my way. But Mr. Shepard is so  strict. Are you very strict, Herr Dominie?    MRS. S. Why, my child, you have heard me say so before. Herr Dominie is  the very strictest--but (_playfully_) he will not acknowledge it.    DOMINIE. There is one thing you must allow, Mrs. Spriggins,--that my  pupils always take pleasure in my lessons; and that must be the case  because their progress is evident and gives them delight, and every  thing is developed in the most natural way.    MRS. S. (_less sharply_). We won't"]]]
