Our windows opened upon a  very pleasant view; a river flows at the foot of the wall--the Brenta or  the Bacchiglione, I know not which, for both water Padua. The banks of  this watercourse were adorned with old houses and long walls, and trees,  too, overhung the banks; some rather picturesque rows of piles, from  which the fishermen cast their lines with that patience characteristic  of them in all countries; huts with nets and linen hanging from the  windows to dry, formed under the sun's rays a very pretty subject for a  water-color.    After dinner we went to the Cafe Pedrocchi, celebrated throughout all  Italy for its magnificence. Nothing could be more monumentally classic.  There are nothing but pillars, columnets, ovolos, and palm leaves of the  Percier and Fontain kind, the whole very fine and lavish of marble.  What was most curious was some immense maps forming a tapestry and  representing the different divisions of the world on an enormous scale.  This somewhat pedantic decoration gives to the hall an academic air; and  one is surprized not to see a chair in place of the bar, with a  professor in his gown in place of a dispenser of lemonade.    The University of Padua was formerly famous. In the thirteenth century  eighteen thousand young men, a whole people of scholars, followed the  lessons of the learned professors, among whom later Galileo figured, one  of whose bones is preserved there as a relic, a relic of a martyr who  suffered for the truth. The facade of the University is very beautiful;  four Doric columns give it a severe and monumental air; but solitude  reigns in the class-rooms where to-day scarcely a thousand students can  be reckoned....    We paid a visit to the Cathedral dedicated to Saint Anthony, who enjoys  at Padua the same reputation as Saint Januarius at Naples. He is the  \"genius loci,\" the Saint venerated above all others. He used to perform  not less than thirty miracles each day, if Casanova[17] is to be  believed. Such a performance fairly earned for him his surname of  Thaumaturge, but this prodigious zeal has fallen off greatly.  Nevertheless, the reputation of the saint has not suffered, and so many  masses are paid for at his altar that the number of the priests of the  cathedral and of days in the year are not sufficient. To liquidate the  accounts, the Pope has granted permission, at the end of the year, for  masses to be said, each, one of which is of the value of a thousand; in  this fashion Saint Anthony is saved from being bankrupt to his faithful  devotees.    On the place which adjoins the cathedral, a beautiful equestrian statue  by Donatello, in bronze, rises to view, the first which had been cast  since the days of antiquity, representing a leader of banditti:  Gattamelata, a brigand who surely did not deserve that honor. But the  artist has given him a superb bearing and a spirited figure with his  baton of a Roman emperor, and it is entirely sufficient....    One thing which must not be neglected in passing through Padua is a  visit to the old Church of the Arena, situated at the rear of a garden  of luxuriant vegetation, where it would certainly not be conjectured to  be located unless one were advised of the fact. It is entirely painted  in its interior by Giotto. Not a single column, not a single rib, nor  architectural division interrupts that vast tapestry of frescoes. The  general aspect is soft, azure, starry, like a beautiful, calm sky;  ultramarine dominates; thirty compartments of large dimensions,  indicated by simple lines, contain the life of the Virgin and of her  Divine Son in all their details; they might be called illustrations in  miniature of a gigantic missal. The personages, by naive anachronisms  very precious for history, are clothed in the mode of the times in which  Giotto painted.    Below these compositions of the purest religious feeling, a painted  plinth shows the seven deadly sins symbolized in an ingenious manner,  and other allegorical figures of a very good style; a Paradise and a  Hell, subjects which greatly imprest the minds of the artists of that  epoch, complete this marvelous whole. There are in these paintings weird  and touching details; children issue from their little coffins to mount  to Paradise with a joyous ardor, and launch themselves forth to go to  play upon the blossoming turf of the celestial garden; others stretch  forth their hands to their half-resurrected mothers. The remark may also  be made that all the devils and vices are obese, while the angels and  virtues are thin and slender. The painter wishes to mark the  preponderance of matter in the one class and of spirit in the other.          FERRARA[18]    BY THEOPHILE GAUTIER      Ferrara rises solitary in the midst of a flat country more rich than  picturesque. When one enters it by the broad street which leads to the  square, the aspect of the city is imposing and monumental. A palace with  a grand staircase occupies a corner of this vast square; it might be a  court-house or a town hall, for people of all classes were entering and  departing through its wide doors....    The castle of the ancient dukes of Ferrara, which is to be found a  little farther on, has a fine feudal aspect. It is a vast collection of  towers joined together by high walls crowned with a battlement forming  a cornice, and which emerge from a great moat full of water, over which  one enters by a protected bridge. The castle, built wholly of brick or  of stones reddened by the sun, has a vermilion tint which deprives it of  its imposing effect. It is too much like a decoration of a melodrama.    It was in this castle that the famous Lucretia Borgia lived, whom Victor  Hugo has made such a monster for us, and whom Ariosto depicts as a model  of chastity, grace and virtue; that blonde Lucretia who wrote letters  breathing the purest love, and some of whose hair, fine as silk and  shining as gold, Byron possest. It was there that the dramas of Tasso  and Ariosto and Guarini were played; there that those brilliant orgies  took place, mingled with poisonings and assassinations, which  characterized that learned and artistic, refined and criminal, period of  Italy.    It is the custom to pay a pious visit to the problematical dungeon in  which Tasso, mad with love and grief, passed so many years, according to  the poetic legend which grew up concerning his misfortune. We did not  have time to spare and we regretted it very little. This dungeon, a  perfectly correct sketch of which we have before our eyes, consists only  of four walls, ceiled by a low arch. At the back is to be seen a window  grated by heavy bars and a door with big bolts. It is quite unlikely  that in this obscure hole, tapestried with cobwebs, Tasso could have  worked and retouched his poem, composed sonnets, and occupied himself  with small details of toilet, such as the quality of the velvet of his  cap and the silk of his stockings, and with kitchen details, such as  with what kind of sugar he ought to powder his salad, that which he had  not being fine enough for his liking. Neither did we see the house of  Ariosto, another required pilgrimage. Not to speak of the little faith  which one should place in these unauthenticated traditions, in these  relics without character, we prefer to seek Ariosto in the \"Orlando  Furioso,\" and Tasso in the \"Jerusalem Delivree\" or in the fine drama of  Goethe.    The life of Ferrara is concentrated on the Plaza Nuova, in front of the  church and in the neighborhood of the castle. Life has not yet abandoned  this heart of the city; but in proportion as one moves away from it, it  becomes more feeble, paralysis begins, death gains; silence, solitude,  and grass invade the streets; one feels that one is wandering about a  Thebes peopled with ghosts of the past and from which the living have  evaporated like water which has dried up. There is nothing more sad than  to see the corpse of a dead city slowly falling into dust in the sun and  rain. One at least buries human bodies.          LAKE LUGANO[19]    BY VICTOR TISSOT      On emerging from the second tunnel,[20] beyond a wild and narrow gorge,  there lies suddenly before us, as in a gorgeous fairyland or in the  landscape of a dream, the blue expanse of Lake Lugano, with its setting  of green meadows and purple mountains, with the many-colored village  spires, and the great white fronts of the hotels and villas. Oh, what a  wonderful picture!    We feel as if we were going down into an enchanted garden that has been  hidden by the great snowy walls of the Alps. The air is full of the  perfume of roses and jessamine. The hedges are in flower, butterflies  are dancing, insects are humming, birds are singing. Up above, in the  mountain, is snow, ice, winter, and silence; here there is sunshine,  life, joy, love--all the living delights of spring and summer. Golden  harvests are shining on the plains, and the lake in the distance is like  a piece of the sky brought down to earth.    Lugano is already Italy, not only because of the richness of the soil  and the magnificence of the vegetation, but also as regards the  language, the manners, and the picturesque costumes. In each valley the  dress is different; in one place the women wear a short skirt, an apron  held in by a girdle, and a bright colored bodice; in another they wear a  cap above which is a large shady hat; in the Val Maroblio they have a  woolen dress not very different from that of the Capuchins.    The men have not the square figure, the slow, heavy walk of the people  of Basle and Lucerne; they are brisk, vigorous, easy; and the women have  something of the wavy suppleness of vine branches twining among the  trees. These people have the happy, childlike joyousness, the frank  good-nature, of those who live in the open air, who do not shut  themselves up in their houses, but grow freely like the flowers under"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19068"],[0,"Household Stories (#10)"],[1,"kly, and takes the pistol out of the  holster and shoots the horse dead with it, he will save the young King.  But who knows that? and he that knows it and does it will become stone  from toe to knee.\" Then said the second,    \"I know further, that if the horse should be killed, the young King will  not even then be sure of his bride. When they arrive at the castle there  will lie a wrought bride-shirt in a dish, and it will seem all woven of  gold and silver, but it is really of sulphur and pitch, and if he puts  it on it will burn him to the marrow of his bones.\" The third raven  said,    \"Is there no remedy?\"    \"Oh yes,\" answered the second; \"if another man with gloves on picks up  the shirt, and throws it into the fire, so that it is consumed, then is  the young King delivered. But what avails that? He who knows it and does  it will be turned into stone from his heart to his knee.\" Then spoke the  third,    \"I know yet more, that even when the bride-shirt is burnt up the King is  not sure of his bride; when at the wedding the dance begins, and the  young Queen dances, she will suddenly grow pale and fall to the earth as  if she were dead, and unless some one lifts her up and takes three drops  of blood from her right breast, she will die. But he that knows this and  does this will become stone from the crown of his head to the sole of  his foot.\"    When the ravens had spoken thus among themselves they flew away.  Faithful John had understood it all, and from that time he remained  quiet and sad, for he thought to himself that were he to conceal what he  had heard from his master, misfortune would befall; and were he to  discover it his own life would be sacrificed. At last, however, he said  within himself,    \"I will save my master, though I myself should perish!\"    So when they came on land, it happened just as the ravens had foretold,  there sprang forward a splendid fox-red horse.    \"Come on!\" said the King, \"he shall carry me to the castle,\" and was  going to mount, when Faithful John passed before him and mounted  quickly, drew the pistol out of the holster, and shot the horse dead.  Then the other servants of the king cried out (for they did not wish  well to Faithful John),    \"How shameful to kill that beautiful animal that was to have carried the  king to his castle.\" But the King said,    \"Hold your tongues, and let him be: he is my Faithful John; he knows  what is the good of it.\"    Then they went up to the castle, and there stood in the hall a dish,  and the wrought bride-shirt that lay on it seemed as if of gold and  silver. The young King went up to it and was going to put it on, but  Faithful John pushed him away, picked it up with his gloved hands, threw  it quickly on the fire, and there let it burn. The other servants began  grumbling again, and said,    \"Look, he is even burning up the king's bridal shirt!\" But the young  King said,    \"Who knows but that there may be a good reason for it? let him be, he is  my Faithful John.\"    Then the wedding feast was held; and the bride led the dance; Faithful  John watched her carefully, and all at once she grew pale and fell down  as if she were dead. Then he went quickly to her, and carried her into a  chamber hard by, laid her down, and kneeling, took three drops of blood  from her right breast. Immediately she drew breath again and raised  herself up, but the young King witnessing all, and not knowing why  Faithful John had done this, grew very angry, and cried out,    \"Throw him into prison!\"    The next morning Faithful John was condemned to death and led to the  gallows, and as he stood there ready to suffer, he said,    \"He who is about to die is permitted to speak once before his end; may I  claim that right?\"    \"Yes,\" answered the King, \"it is granted to you.\" Then said Faithful  John,    \"I have been condemned unjustly, for I have always been faithful,\" and  he related how he had heard on the sea voyage the talk of the ravens,  and how he had done everything in order to save his master. Then cried  the King,    \"O my Faithful John, pardon! pardon! lead him down!\" But Faithful John,  as he spoke the last words, fell lifeless, and became stone.    The King and Queen had great grief because of this, and the King said,    \"Ah, how could I have evil-rewarded such faithfulness!\" and he caused  the stone image to be lifted up and put to stand in his sleeping-room by  the side of his bed. And as often as he saw it he wept and said,    \"Would that I could bring thee back to life, my Faithful John!\"    After some time the Queen bore twins--two little sons--that grew and  thrived, and were the joy of their parents. One day, when the Queen was  in church, the two children were sitting and playing with their father,  and he gazed at the stone image full of sadness, sighed, and cried,    \"Oh that I could bring thee back to life, my Faithful John!\" Then the  stone began to speak, and said,    \"Yes, thou canst bring me back to life again, if thou wilt bestow  therefor thy best-beloved.\" Then cried the King,    \"All that I have in the world will I give up for thee!\" The stone went  on to say,    \"If thou wilt cut off the heads of thy two children with thy own hand,  and besmear me with their blood, I shall receive life again.\"    The King was horror-struck at the thought that he must put his beloved  children to death, but he remembered all John's faithfulness, and how he  had died for him, and he drew his sword and cut off his children's heads  with his own hand. And when he had besmeared the stone with their blood  life returned to it, and Faithful John stood alive and well before him;  and he said to the king,    \"Thy faithfulness shall not be unrewarded,\" and, taking up the heads of  the children, he set them on again, and besmeared the wound with their  blood, upon which in a moment they were whole again, and jumped about,  and went on playing as if nothing had happened to them.    Now was the King full of joy; and when he saw the Queen coming he put  the Faithful John and the two children in a great chest. When she came  in he said to her,    \"Hast thou prayed in church?\"    \"Yes,\" answered she, \"but I was thinking all the while of Faithful John,  and how he came to such great misfortune through us.\"    \"Then,\" said he, \"dear wife, we can give him life again, but it will  cost us both our little sons, whom we must sacrifice.\"    The Queen grew pale and sick at heart, but said,    \"We owe it him, because of his great faithfulness.\"    Then the King rejoiced because she thought as he did, and he went and  unlocked the chest and took out the children and Faithful John, and  said,    \"God be praised, he is delivered, and our little sons are ours again;\"  and he related to her how it had come to pass.    After that they all lived together in happiness to their lives' end.          THE WONDERFUL MUSICIAN      THERE was once a wonderful musician, and he was one day walking through  a wood all alone, thinking of this and that: and when he had nothing  more left to think about, he said to himself,    \"I shall grow tired of being in this wood, so I will bring out a good  companion.\"    So he took the fiddle that hung at his back and fiddled so that the wood  echoed. Before long a wolf came through the thicket and trotted up to  him.    \"Oh, here comes a wolf! I had no particular wish for such company,\" said  the musician: but the wolf drew nearer, and said to him,    \"Ho, you musician, how finely you play! I must learn how to play too.\"    \"That is easily done,\" answered the musician, \"you have only to do  exactly as I tell you.\"    \"O musician,\" said the wolf, \"I will obey you, as a scholar does his  master.\"    The musician told him to come with him. As they went a part of the way  together they came to an old oak tree, which was hollow within and cleft  through the middle.    \"Look here,\" said the musician, \"if you want to learn how to fiddle, you  must put your fore feet in this cleft.\"    The wolf obeyed, but the musician took up a stone and quickly wedged  both his paws with one stroke, so fast, that the wolf was a prisoner,  and there obliged to stop.    \"Stay there until I come back again,\" said the musician, and went his  way.    After a while he said again to himself,    \"I shall grow weary here in this wood; I will bring out another  companion,\" and he took his fiddle and fiddled away in the wood. Before  long a fox came slinking through the trees.    \"Oh, here comes a fox!\" said the musician; \"I had no particular wish for  such company.\"    The fox came up to him and said,    \"O my dear musician, how finely you play! I must learn how to play too.\"    \"That is easily done,\" said the musician, \"you have only to do exactly  as I tell you.\"    \"O musician,\" answered the fox, \"I will obey you, as a scholar his  master.\"    \"Follow me,\" said the musician; and as they went a part of the way  together they came to a footpath with a high hedge on each side. Then  the musician stopped, and taking hold of a hazel-branch bent it down to  the earth, and put his foot on the end of it; then he bent down a branch  from the other side, and said: \"Come on, little fox, if you wish to  learn something, reach me your left fore foot.\"    The fox obeyed, and the musician bound the foot to the left hand branch.    \"Now, little fox,\" said he, \"reach me the right one;\" then he bound it  to the right hand branch. And when he had seen that the knots were fast  enough he let go, and the branches flew back and caught up the fox,  shaking and struggling, in the air.    \"Wait there until I come back again,\" said the musician, and went his  way.    By and by he said to himself: \"I shall grow weary in this wood; I will  bring out another companion.\"    So he took his fiddle, and the sound echoed through the wood. Then a  hare sprang out before him.    \"Oh, here comes a hare!\" said he, \"that's not what I want.\"    \"Ah, my dear musician,\" said the hare, \"how finely you"]]]
