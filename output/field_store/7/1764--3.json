If a person is able to express himself  in some real way, to give himself to socially needed work; if he can  reproduce himself intellectually and spiritually in artistic  production, in invention, in literature, in social betterment, he is  drawing on an age-old reservoir of creative energy, and by so doing is  relieving himself of inner tension which would otherwise seek less  beneficent ways of expression.    The world knew all this intuitively for a long time before it knew it  theoretically. The novelists, who are unconsciously among the best  psychologists, have thoroughly worked the vein. The average man knows  it. \"He was disappointed in love,\" we say, \"and we thought he would go  to pieces, but now he has found himself in his work\"; or, \"She will go  mad if she doesn't find some one who needs her.\" It is only lately  that science has caught up with intuition, but now the physicians and  psychologists who have had the most intimate and first-hand  acquaintance with the human heart are recognizing, to a man, this  unique power of the love-instinct and its possibilities for creative  work of every sort.[14]    [Footnote 14: Among those who have shown this connection between the  love-force and creative work are Freud, Jung, Jelliffe, White, Brill,  Jones, Wright, Frink, and the late Dr. Putnam of Harvard University,  who writes: \"Freud has never asserted it as his opinion and it  certainly is not mine, that this is the only root from which artistic  expression springs. On the other hand, it is probable that all  artistic productions are partly referable to this source. A close  examination of many of them would enable any one to justify the  opinion that it is a source largely drawn upon.\"--_Human Motives_. p.  87.]      =Higher Levels.= Freud has called this spiritualization of natural  forces by a term borrowed from chemistry. As a solid is \"sublimated\"  when transformed into a gas, so a primal impulse is said to be  \"sublimated\" when it is diverted from its original object and made to  serve other ends. By this power of sublimation the little  exhibitionist, who loved to show himself, may become an actor; the  \"cruel\" boy who loved to dissect animals may become a surgeon; the  sexually curious child may turn his curiosity to other things and  become a scholar; the \"born mother,\" if denied children of her own or  having finished with their upbringing, may take to herself the  children of the city, working for better laws and better care for  needy little ones; the man or woman whose sex-instinct is too strong  to find expression in legitimate, direct ways, may find it a valuable  resource, an increment of energy for creative work, along whatever  line his talent may lie.    There is no more marvelous provision in all life than this power of  sublimation of one form of energy into another, a provision shadowing  forth almost limitless possibilities for higher adaptations and for  growth in character. As we think of the distance we have already  traveled and the endless possibilities of ever higher excursions of  the life-force, we feel like echoing Paul's words: \"He who began a  good work in you will perfect it unto the end.\" The history of the  past holds great promise for the future.    =When Sublimation Fails.= But in the meantime we cannot congratulate  ourselves too heartily. Sublimation too often fails. There are too  many nervous wrecks by the way, too many weak indulgers of original  desires, too many repressed, starved lives with no outlet for their  misunderstood yearnings; and, as we shall see, too many people who, in  spite of a big lifework, fail to find satisfaction because of  unnecessary handicaps carried over from their childhood days.  \"Society's great task is, therefore, the understanding of the  life-force, its manifold efforts at expression and the way of  attaining this, and to provide as free and expansive ways as possible  for the creative energy which is to work marvelous things for the  future.\"    If \"the understanding of the life force\" is to be available for use,  it must be the property of the average man and woman, the fathers and  mothers of our children, the teachers and physicians who act as their  advisers and friends.[15] This chapter is intended to do its bit  toward such a general understanding.    [Footnote 15: \"Appropriate educational processes might perhaps guide  this enormous impulsive energy toward the maintenance instead of the  destruction of marriage and the family. But up to the present time,  education with respect to this moral issue has commonly lacked any  such constructive method. The social standard and the individual  impulse have simply collided, and the individual has been left to  resolve the conflict, for the most part by his own resources.\"--G.A.  Coe: _Psychology of Religion_, p. 150.]      PARENTAL INSTINCT AND TENDER EMOTION    =Until They Can Fly.= Only half of Nature's need is met by the  reproductive instinct. Her carefulness in this direction would be  largely wasted without that other impulse which she has planted, the  impulse to protect the new lives until they are old enough to fend for  themselves. The higher the type of life and the greater the future  demands, the longer is the period of preparation and consequent period  of parental care. This fact, coupled with man's power for lasting  relationships through the organization of permanent sentiments, has  made the, bond between parent and child an enduring one. Needless to  say, this relationship is among the most beautiful on earth, the  source of an incalculable amount of joy and gain. However, as we have  already suggested, there lurks here, as in every beneficent force, a  danger. If parents forget what they are for, and try to foster a more  than ordinary tie, they make themselves a menace to those whom they  most love. Any exaggeration is abnormal. If the childhood bond is  over-strong, or the childhood dependence too long cultivated, then the  relationship has overstepped its purpose, and, as we shall later see,  has laid the foundation for a future neurosis.    =Mothering the World.= Probably no instinct has so many ways of  indirect expression as this mothering impulse of protection. Aroused  by the cry of a child in distress, or by the thought of the weakness,  or need, or ill-treatment of any defenseless creature, this  mother-father impulse is at the root of altruism, gratitude, love,  pity, benevolence, and all unselfish actions.    There is still a great difference of opinion as to how man's spiritual  nature came into being; still discussion as to whether it developed  out of crude beginnings as the rest of his physical and mental  endowment has developed, or whether it was added from the outside as  something entirely new. Be that as it may, the fact remains that man  has as an innate part of his being an altruistic tendency, an  unselfish care for the welfare of others, a relationship to society as  a whole,--a relationship which is the only foundation of health and  happiness and which brings sure disaster if ignored. The egoistic  tendencies are only a part of human nature. Part of us is naturally  socially minded, unselfish, spiritual, capable of responding to the  call to lose our lives in order that others may find theirs.      SUMMARY    Civilized man as he is to-day is a product of the past and can be  understood only as that past is understood. The conflicts with which  he is confronted are the direct outcome of the evolutional history of  the race and of its attempt to adapt its primitive instincts to  present-day ideals.    Character is what we do with our instincts. According to Freud, all  of a man's traits are the result of his unchanged original impulses,  or of his reactions against those impulses, or of his sublimation of  them. In other words, there are three things we may do with our  instincts. We may follow our primal desires, we may deny their  existence, or we may use them for ends which are in harmony with our  lives as we want them to be. As the first course leads to degeneracy,  the second to nervous illness, and the third to happy usefulness, it  is obviously important to learn the way of sublimation. Sometimes this  is accomplished unconsciously by the life-force, but sometimes  sublimation fails, and is reestablished only when the conscious mind  gains an understanding of the great forces of life. This method of  reeducation of the personality as a means of treatment in nervousness  is called psycho-therapy.    =Religion's Contribution.= If it be asked why, amid all this  discussion of instincts and motives we have made no mention of that  great energizer religion, we answer that we have by no means forgotten  it, but that we have been dealing solely with those primary tendencies  out of which all of the compound emotions are made. Man has been  described as instinctively and incurably religious, but there seems no  doubt that religion is a compound reaction, made up of  love,--sympathetic response to the parental love of God,--fear,  negative self-feeling, and positive self-feeling in the shape of  aspiration for the desired ideal of character; all woven into several  compound emotions such as awe, gratitude, and reverence.    It goes almost without saying that religion, if it be vital, is one of  the greatest sources of moral energy and spiritual dynamic, and that  it is and always has been one of the greatest aids to sublimation that  man has found. A force like the Christian religion, which sets the  highest ideal of character and makes man want to live up to it, and  which at the same time says, \"You can. Here is strength to help you\";  which unifies life and fills it with purpose; which furnishes the  highest love-object and turns the thought outward to the good of  mankind--such a force could hardly fail to be a dynamic factor in the  effort toward sublimation.

Oh, but the mere  circumstance of being without sensation is miserable. It might be so if  being without sensation were the same thing as wanting it; but as it is  evident there can be nothing of any kind in that which has no  existence, what can there be afflicting to that which can neither feel  want nor be sensible of anything? We might be said to have repeated  this over too often, only that here lies all that the soul shudders at  from the fear of death. For whoever can clearly apprehend that which is  as manifest as the light--that when both soul and body are consumed,  and there is a total destruction, then that which was an animal becomes  nothing--will clearly see that there is no difference between a  Hippocentaur, which never had existence, and King Agamemnon, and that  M. Camillus is no more concerned about this present civil war than I  was at the sacking of Rome, when he was living.    XXXVIII. Why, then, should Camillus be affected with the thoughts of  these things happening three hundred and fifty years after his time?  And why should I be uneasy it I were to expect that some nation might  possess itself of this city ten thousand years hence? Because so great  is our regard for our country, as not to be measured by our own  feeling, but by its own actual safety.    Death, then, which threatens us daily from a thousand accidents, and  which, by reason of the shortness of life, can never be far off, does  not deter a wise man from making such provision for his country and his  family as he hopes may last forever; and from regarding posterity, of  which he can never have any real perception, as belonging to himself.  Wherefore a man may act for eternity, even though he be persuaded that  his soul is mortal; not, indeed, from a desire of glory, which he will  be insensible of, but from a principle of virtue, which glory will  inevitably attend, though that is not his object. The process, indeed,  of nature is this: that just in the same manner as our birth was the  beginning of things with us, so death will be the end; and as we were  noways concerned with anything before we were born, so neither shall we  be after we are dead. And in this state of things where can the evil  be, since death has no connection with either the living or the dead?  The one have no existence at all, the other are not yet affected by it.  They who make the least of death consider it as having a great  resemblance to sleep; as if any one would choose to live ninety years  on condition that, at the expiration of sixty, he should sleep out the  remainder. The very swine would not accept of life on those terms, much  less I. Endymion, indeed, if you listen to fables, slept once on a time  on Latmus, a mountain of Caria, and for such a length of time that I  imagine he is not as yet awake. Do you think that he is concerned at  the Moon's being in difficulties, though it was by her that he was  thrown into that sleep, in order that she might kiss him while  sleeping. For what should he be concerned for who has not even any  sensation? You look on sleep as an image of death, and you take that on  you daily; and have you, then, any doubt that there is no sensation in  death, when you see there is none in sleep, which is its near  resemblance?    XXXIX. Away, then, with those follies, which are little better than the  old women's dreams, such as that it is miserable to die before our  time. What time do you mean? That of nature? But she has only lent you  life, as she might lend you money, without fixing any certain time for  its repayment. Have you any grounds of complaint, then, that she  recalls it at her pleasure? for you received it on these terms. They  that complain thus allow that if a young child dies, the survivors  ought to bear his loss with equanimity; that if an infant in the cradle  dies, they ought not even to utter a complaint; and yet nature has been  more severe with them in demanding back what she gave. They answer by  saying that such have not tasted the sweets of life; while the other  had begun to conceive hopes of great happiness, and, indeed, had begun  to realize them. Men judge better in other things, and allow a part to  be preferable to none. Why do they not admit the same estimate in life?  Though Callimachus does not speak amiss in saying that more tears had  flowed from Priam than his son; yet they are thought happier who die  after they have reached old age. It would be hard to say why; for I do  not apprehend that any one, if a longer life were granted to him, would  find it happier. There is nothing more agreeable to a man than  prudence, which old age most certainly bestows on a man, though it may  strip him of everything else. But what age is long, or what is there at  all long to a man? Does not        Old age, though unregarded, still attend      On childhood's pastimes, as the cares of men?    But because there is nothing beyond old age, we call that long: all  these things are said to be long or short, according to the proportion  of time they were given us for. Artistotle saith there is a kind of  insect near the river Hypanis, which runs from a certain part of Europe  into the Pontus, whose life consists but of one day; those that die at  the eighth hour die in full age; those who die when the sun sets are  very old, especially when the days are at the longest. Compare our  longest life with eternity, and we shall be found almost as short-lived  as those little animals.    XL. Let us, then, despise all these follies--for what softer name can I  give to such levities?--and let us lay the foundation of our happiness  in the strength and greatness of our minds, in a contempt and disregard  of all earthly things, and in the practice of every virtue. For at  present we are enervated by the softness of our imaginations, so that,  should we leave this world before the promises of our fortune-tellers  are made good to us, we should think ourselves deprived of some great  advantages, and seem disappointed and forlorn. But if, through life, we  are in continual suspense, still expecting, still desiring, and are in  continual pain and torture, good Gods! how pleasant must that journey  be which ends in security and ease! How pleased am I with Theramenes!  Of how exalted a soul does he appear! For, although we never read of  him without tears, yet that illustrious man is not to be lamented in  his death, who, when he had been imprisoned by the command of the  thirty tyrants, drank off, at one draught, as if he had been thirsty,  the poisoned cup, and threw the remainder out of it with such force  that it sounded as it fell; and then, on hearing the sound of the  drops, he said, with a smile, \"I drink this to the most excellent  Critias,\" who had been his most bitter enemy; for it is customary among  the Greeks, at their banquets, to name the person to whom they intend  to deliver the cup. This celebrated man was pleasant to the last, even  when he had received the poison into his bowels, and truly foretold the  death of that man whom he named when he drank the poison, and that  death soon followed. Who that thinks death an evil could approve of the  evenness of temper in this great man at the instant of dying? Socrates  came, a few years after, to the same prison and the same cup by as  great iniquity on the part of his judges as the tyrants displayed when  they executed Theramenes. What a speech is that which Plato makes him  deliver before his judges, after they had condemned him to death!    XLI. \"I am not without hopes, O judges, that it is a favorable  circumstance for me that I am condemned to die; for one of these two  things must necessarily happen--either that death will deprive me  entirely of all sense, or else that, by dying, I shall go from hence  into some other place; wherefore, if all sense is utterly extinguished,  and if death is like that sleep which sometimes is so undisturbed as to  be even without the visions of dreams--in that case, O ye good Gods!  what gain is it to die? or what length of days can be imagined which  would be preferable to such a night? And if the constant course of  future time is to resemble that night, who is happier than I am? But if  on the other hand, what is said be true, namely, that death is but a  removal to those regions where the souls of the departed dwell, then  that state must be more happy still to have escaped from those who call  themselves judges, and to appear before such as are truly so--Minos,  Rhadamanthus, AEacus, Triptolemus--and to meet with those who have lived  with justice and probity![23] Can this change of abode appear otherwise  than great to you? What bounds can you set to the value of conversing  with Orpheus, and Musaeus, and Homer, and Hesiod? I would even, were it  possible, willingly die often, in order to prove the certainty of what  I speak of. What delight must it be to meet with Palamedes, and Ajax,  and others, who have been betrayed by the iniquity of their judges!  Then, also, should I experience the wisdom of even that king of kings,  who led his vast troops to Troy, and the prudence of Ulysses and  Sisyphus: nor should I then be condemned for prosecuting my inquiries  on such subjects in the same way in which I have done here on earth.  And even you, my judges, you, I mean, who have voted for my acquittal,  do not you fear death, for nothing bad can befall a good man, whether  he be alive or dead; nor are his concerns ever overlooked by the Gods;  nor in my case either has this befallen me by chance; and I have  nothing to charge those men with who accused or condemned me but the  fact that they believed that they were doing me harm.\" In this manner  he proceeded. There is no part of his speech which I admire more than  his last words: \"But it is time,\" says he, \"for me now to go hence,  that I may die; and for you, that you may continue to live.
