Grethel perceived her wicked thoughts  and said, \"I do not know how to do it; how shall I get in?\" \"You  stupid goose,\" said she, \"the opening is big enough. See, I could even  get in myself!\" and she got up, and put her head into the oven. Then  Grethel gave her a push, so that she fell right in, and shutting the  iron door bolted it. Oh! how horribly the witch howled; but Grethel  ran away, and left her to burn to ashes.    [Illustration]    Now she ran to Hansel, and, opening the door, called out, \"Hansel we  are saved; the old witch is dead?\"    So he sprang out, like a bird from his cage when the door was opened;  and they were so glad that they fell upon each other's neck, and  kissed each other over and over again. And now, as there was nothing  to fear, they went back to the witch's house, where in every corner  were caskets full of pearls and precious stones. \"These are better  than pebbles,\" said Hansel, putting as many into his pocket as it  would hold; while Grethel thought, \"I will take some home too,\" and  filled her apron full.    \"We must be off now,\" said Hansel, \"and get out of this enchanted  forest;\" but when they had walked for two hours they came to a large  piece of water.    \"We cannot get over,\" said Hansel; \"I can see no bridge at all.\" \"And  there is no boat either,\" said Grethel, \"but there swims a white duck,  I will ask her to help us over;\" and she sang,          \"Little Duck, good little Duck,        Grethel and Hansel, together we stand;        There is neither stile nor bridge,        Take us on your back to land.\"    So the Duck came to them, and Hansel sat himself on, and bade his  sister sit beside him. \"No,\" replied Grethel, \"that will be too much  for the Duck, she shall take us over one at a time.\" This the good  little bird did, and when both were happily arrived on the other side,  and had gone a little way, they came to a well-known wood, which they  knew the better every step they went, and at last they perceived their  father's house. Then they began to run, and rushing into the house,  they fell upon their father's neck. He had not had one happy hour  since he had left the children in the forest; and his wife was dead.  Grethel shook her apron, and the pearls and precious stones rolled out  upon the floor, and Hansel threw down one handful after the other  out of his pocket. Then all their sorrows were ended, and they lived  together in great happiness.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          SNOW-WHITE AND ROSE-RED      A poor widow once lived in a little cottage. In front of the cottage  was a garden, in which were growing two rose trees; one of these bore  white roses, and the other red.    She had two children, who resembled the rose trees. One was called  Snow-White, and the other Rose-Red; and they were as religious and  loving, busy and untiring, as any two children ever were.    Snow-White was more gentle, and quieter than her sister, who liked  better skipping about the fields, seeking flowers, and catching summer  birds; while Snow-White stayed at home with her mother, either helping  her in her work, or, when that was done, reading aloud.    The two children had the greatest affection the one for the other.  They were always seen hand in hand; and should Snow-White say to her  sister, \"We will never separate,\" the other would reply, \"Not while  we live,\" the mother adding, \"That which one has, let her always share  with the other.\"    They constantly ran together in the woods, collecting ripe berries;  but not a single animal would have injured them; quite the reverse,  they all felt the greatest esteem for the young creatures. The hare  came to eat parsley from their hands, the deer grazed by their side,  the stag bounded past them unheeding; the birds, likewise, did not  stir from the bough, but sang in entire security. No mischance befell  them; if benighted in the wood, they lay down on the moss to repose  and sleep till the morning; and their mother was satisfied as to their  safety, and felt no fear about them.    Once, when they had spent the night in the wood, and the bright  sunrise awoke them, they saw a beautiful child, in a snow-white  robe, shining like diamonds, sitting close to the spot where they had  reposed. She arose when they opened their eyes, and looked kindly at  them; but said no word, and passed from their sight into the wood.  When the children looked around they saw they had been sleeping on  the edge of a precipice, and would surely have fallen over if they had  gone forward two steps further in the darkness. Their mother said  the beautiful child must have been the angel who watches over good  children.    Snow-White and Rose-Red kept their mother's cottage so clean that it  gave pleasure only to look in. In summer-time Rose-Red attended to the  house, and every morning, before her mother awoke, placed by her bed  a bouquet which had in it a rose from each of the rose-trees. In  winter-time Snow-White set light to the fire, and put on the kettle,  after polishing it until it was like gold for brightness. In the  evening, when snow was falling, her mother would bid her bolt the  door, and then, sitting by the hearth, the good widow would read aloud  to them from a big book while the little girls were spinning. Close  by them lay a lamb, and a white pigeon, with its head tucked under its  wing, was on a perch behind.    [Illustration]    One evening, as they were all sitting cosily together like this, there  was a knock at the door, as if someone wished to come in.    \"Make haste, Rose-Red!\" said her mother; \"open the door; it is surely  some traveller seeking shelter.\" Rose-Red accordingly pulled back the  bolt, expecting to see some poor man. But it was nothing of the kind;  it was a bear, that thrust his big head in at the open door. Rose-Red  cried out and sprang back, the lamb bleated, the dove fluttered her  wings and Snow-White hid herself behind her mother's bed. The bear  began speaking, and said, \"Do not be afraid: I will not do you any  harm; I am half-frozen, and would like to warm myself a little at your  fire.\"    \"Poor bear!\" the mother replied; \"come in and lie by the fire; only be  careful that your hair is not burnt.\" Then she called Snow-White and  Rose-Red, telling them that the bear was kind, and would not harm  them. They came, as she bade them, and presently the lamb and the dove  drew near also without fear.    \"Children,\" begged the bear; \"knock some of the snow off my coat.\" So  they brought the broom and brushed the bear's coat quite clean.    After that he stretched himself out in front of the fire, and pleased  himself by growling a little, only to show that he was happy and  comfortable. Before long they were all quite good friends, and the  children began to play with their unlooked for visitor, pulling his  thick fur, or placing their feet on his back, or rolling him over and  over. Then they took a slender hazel twig, using it upon his thick  coat, and they laughed when he growled. The bear permitted them to  amuse themselves in this way, only occasionally calling out, when it  went a little too far, \"Children, spare me an inch of life!\"    [Illustration]    When it was night, and all were making ready to go to bed, the widow  told the bear, \"You may stay here and lie by the hearth, if you like,  so that you will be sheltered from the cold and from the bad weather.\"    The offer was accepted, but when morning came, as the day broke in  the east, the two children let him out, and over the snow he went back  into the wood.    After this, every evening at the same time the bear came, lay by the  fire, and allowed the children to play with him; so they became quite  fond of their curious playmate, and the door was not ever bolted in  the evening until he had appeared.    When springtime came, and all around began to look green and bright,  one morning the bear said to Snow-White, \"Now I must leave you, and  all the summer long I shall not be able to come back.\"    \"Where, then, are you going, dear bear?\" asked Snow-White. \"I have to  go to the woods to protect my treasure from the bad dwarfs. In winter  time when the earth is frozen hard, they must remain underground, and  cannot make their way through; but now that the sunshine has thawed  the earth they can come to the surface, and whatever gets into their  hands, or is brought to their caves, seldom, if ever, again sees  daylight.\"    Snow-White was very sad when she said good-bye to the good-natured  beast, and unfastened the door, that he might go; but in going out he  was caught by a hook in the lintel, and a scrap of his fur being torn,  Snow-White thought there was something shining like gold through the  rent; but he went out so quickly that she could not feel certain what  it was, and soon he was hidden among the trees.    One day the mother sent her children into the wood to pick up sticks.  They found a big tree lying on the ground. It had been felled, and  towards the roots they noticed something skipping and springing, which  they could not make out, as it was sometimes hidden in the grasses.

Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s tatting cotton No. 100,  tatting-pin No. 3; 1 piece of very fine cord.    This collar is ornamented with a triangle and a border of a very  effective pattern. The triangle is begun in the centre, by working for  each of the three leaves 5 double stitches, 5 purl divided one from the  other by 2 double stitches, and 5 more double stitches. When the third  leaf is completed, fasten off and cut the cotton. Now take, instead of  the cotton wound upon the shuttle, a piece of extremely fine cord, over  which work with the cotton from the reel the following row of  stitches:--1 double stitch, fasten the cotton to the centre purl of one  of the three leaves, * 2 double stitches, 5 purl divided one from the  other by 2 double stitches, 3 double stitches, fasten the cotton to the  centre purl of the nearest leaf, 2 double stitches, 9 purl divided one  from the other by 3 double stitches, 2 double stitches fastened to the  same purl as before. Repeat from * twice more, then fasten off, and cut  the cord and the cotton. Begin afresh, and work 3 small circles, each  composed of 12 plain stitches placed quite close together (these form  one of the corners of the triangle), then at small distances one from  the other work 13 similar circles, every second one of which is fastened  to one purl of the row of    [Illustration: 54.--Linen Collar trimmed with Tatting.]    stitches worked over the cord (see illustration). Cut away from the  collar the piece of linen which is to be replaced by the triangle, fold  in the edges and work them round in button-hole stitch, and fill up the  space with the triangle. For the border, work first * one circle  composed of 3 double stitches, 4 purl divided one from the other by 2  double stitches, 3 more double stitches; take up the cord once more and  work over it, 3 double stitches, then, without cord, 1 circle composed  of 2 double stitches, 12 purl divided one from the other by 2 double  stitches, 2 more double stitches; take up the cord again and work over  it 3 double stitches, 4 purl divided each by 2 double stitches, 3 double  stitches. Fasten the cotton to the third purl (reckoning from the last)  of the second circle worked without cord; 3 double stitches fastened to  the fourth purl of the row of stitches worked over the cord (see  illustration), 2 double stitches, 6 purl divided each by 2 double  stitches, 3 double stitches fastened to the purl of next circle, 3  double stitches fastened to the last purl of the row, 2 double stitches,  3 purl divided each by 2 double stitches, 3 double stitches; fasten the  cotton to the sixth purl of the circle (reckoning from the beginning), 4  double stitches. Repeat from *. Work over the top of the border a  crochet edging similar to that round the diamond pattern of collar No.  49. For the point of the border, at the corner of the collar, see  illustration No. 54.           *       *       *       *       *    55.--_Tatted Collar_.    Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s tatting cotton No. 100;  tatting-pin No. 1.    This collar is worked with very fine tatting cotton. It consists of four  branched tatted patterns and of separate tatted circles, fastened on to  one another as seen in illustration. The four branched patterns are  worked as follow:--3 double, 1 purl, 7 times alternately 2 double, 1  purl, then 3 double, and join the knots into a circle. Work 3 similar  leaves close to this 1st leaf, but instead of working the 1st purl,  fasten them on to the last purl of the preceding leaf; besides this,  instead of    [Illustration: 55.--Tatted Collar.]    working the last purl of the 4th branch, fasten it on to the first purl  of the 1st branch. When 1 such four-branched pattern is completed, knot  both ends of the cotton together and cut them off. Make a row of similar  patterns by joining them on to the 2 middle purl of a branch of the  preceding pattern, instead of working the 2 middle purl of the last  branch (see illustration). Two rows of similar patterns are joined by  the above-mentioned circles, consisting of 32 double stitches, by  fastening these circles from illustration between four branched  patterns. Begin each circle with 2 double stitches, fasten it on to the  corresponding purl of the four-branched pattern, work again 2 double,  fasten on to the next purl, and continue in the same manner till the  circle is sufficiently large. Each circle is ornamented with lace  stitch. The collar is edged round the neck with close button-hole  stitches.           *       *       *       *       *    56.--_Tatted Collar_.

This pattern is suitable for trimming cravats, collars,  pocket-handkerchiefs, petticoats, &c., according to the size of the  cotton with which it is worked. Work first the round of circles which  incloses the leaves, overlapping each other in the centre; begin with  the smallest circle, which is at the top of the pattern; it consists of  3 double, 1 purl, 7 double, 1 purl, 7 double, 1 purl, 3 double. Then  work at a short distance another circle like the preceding one, only  work 8 double instead of 7, and instead of working the first purl,  fasten the circle on to the last purl of the preceding circle; all the  other circles are fastened on to each other in the same manner. The next  circle, worked again at a distance of about one-fifth of an inch, has 4  double; fasten it on to the preceding circle, 9 double, 1 purl, 9  double, 1 purl, 4 double. The following four circles are worked like the  preceding one; only work in the first of these circles 10 double instead  of 9, in the second 11 double, in the third 12 double.
