On the other hand, the results show a  far-reaching correspondence between efficiency in the experiment and  efficiency in the actual service. With a relatively small number of  experiments this correspondence cannot be expected to be complete, the  more as a large number of secondary features must enter which  interfere with an exact correlation between experiment and standing in  the railway company. We must consider, for instance, that those men  whom the company naturally selects as models are men who have had  twenty to thirty years of service without accidents, but consequently  they are rather old men, who no longer have the elasticity of youth  and are naturally less able to think themselves into an artificial  situation like that of such an experiment, and who have been for a  long time removed from contact with book work. It is therefore not  surprising, but only to be expected, that such older, model men, while  doing fair work in the test, are yet not seldom far surpassed by  bright, quick, young motormen who are twenty years younger, even  though they are not yet ideal motormen. Moreover, the standing in the  company often depends upon features which have nothing to do with the  mental make-up of the man, while the experiment has to be confined to  these mental conditions which favor accidents. It is quite possible  that a man may happen to experience a slight collision, even though no  conditions for the accident were lying in his mental make-up. But we  may go still further. The experiment refers to those sides of his mind  which make him able to foresee the danger points, and that is  decidedly the most essential factor and the one from which most can be  hoped for the safety of the public. But this does not exclude the  possibility that some other mental traits may become causes of  accidents. The man may be too daring and may like to run risks, or he  may still need discipline, or he may not be sufficiently acquainted  with the local conditions. Any such secondary factors may cause some  slight accidents with the man who shows rather fair results in the  experimental test of his foresight. Finally, we must not forget that  some men enter into such tests under a certain nervous tension and  therefore may not show so well at the very first test as their mental  equipment should allow. Hence it is decidedly desirable not to rely on  the first test, but to repeat it. If those various interferences are  taken into account, the correspondence between efficiency and the  results of the tests is fairly satisfactory. It justified me in  proposing that the experiments be continued and in regarding it as  quite possible that later tests on the basis of this principle may be  introduced at the employment of motormen.    A difficulty is presented by the valuation of the numerical results.  The mere number of omissions alone cannot be decisive, as it is clear  that no intelligent man would make any omissions if he should give an  unlimited amount of time to it; for instance, if he were to spend  fifteen minutes on those 12 cards. But this is the same thing as to  say that a motorman would not run over any one if he were to drive his  car one mile in an hour. The practical problem is to combine the  greatest possible speed with the smallest number of oversights and  both factors must therefore be considered. The subject who makes  relatively many mistakes but uses a very short time must be  acknowledged to be as good as the man who makes fewer mistakes but  takes a longer time. In the results which I have gathered in  experiments with motormen, no one has gone through those 12 cards in a  shorter time than 140 seconds, while the longest time was 427 seconds.  On the other hand, no one of the motormen made less than 4 omissions,  while the worst ones made 28 omissions. I abstract from one extreme  case with 36 omissions. On the whole, we may say that the time  fluctuates between 180 and 420, the mistakes between 4 and 28. The aim  is to find a formula which gives full value to both factors and makes  the material directly comparable in the form of one numerical value  instead of the two. If we were simply to add the number of seconds and  the number of omissions, the omissions would count far too little,  inasmuch as 10 additional omissions would then mean no more than 10  additional seconds. On the other hand, if we were to multiply the two  figures the omissions would mean by far too much, as the transition  from 4 mistakes to 8 mistakes would then be as great a change as the  transition from 200 to 400 seconds, that is, from the one extreme of  time to the other. Evidently we balance both factors if we multiply  the number of omissions by 10 and add them to the number of seconds.  The variations between 4 and 28 omissions are 24 steps, which  multiplied by 10 correspond to the 240 steps which lie between 180 and  420 seconds. On that basis any additional 50 seconds would be equal to  5 additional omissions. If of two men one takes 100 seconds less than  his neighbor, he is equal to him in his ability to satisfy the demands  of the service, if he makes 10 mistakes more.    On the basis of this calculation I find that the old, well-trained  motormen come to a result of about 450, and I should consider that an  average standard. This would mean that a man who uses 400 seconds  would not be allowed to make more than 5 omissions, in 350 seconds not  more than 10, in 300 not more than 15, in 250 not more than 20, under  the condition that these are the results of the first set of  experiments. Where there are more than 20 omissions made, mere  quickness ought not to be allowed as a substitute. The man who takes  150 seconds and makes 30 mistakes would come up to the same standard  level of 450. Yet his characteristics would probably not serve the  interests of the service. He would speed up his car and would make  better time than any one else, but would be liable to accidents. I  should consider 20 mistakes with a time not longer than 250 as the  permissible maximum. Among the younger motormen whom I examined, the  best result was 290, in which 270 seconds were used and only 2  omissions made. Results below 350 may be considered as very good. One  man, for instance, carried out the experiment in 237 seconds with 11  mistakes, which gives the result 347. From 350 to 450 may be counted  as fair, 450 to 550 as mediocre, and over 550 as very poor. In the  case of old men, who may be expected to adjust themselves less easily  to artificial experiments, the limits may be shifted. If the  experiments are made repeatedly, the valuation of the results must be  changed accordingly. The training of the men in literary and  mathematical work or in experimentation may be considered, as our  experiments have shown that highly educated young people with long  training in experimental observations can pass through the test much  more quickly than any one of the motormen could. Among the most  advanced graduate students who do research work in my Harvard  laboratory there was no one whose result was more than 275, while, as  I said, among all the motormen there was no one whose result was less  than 290. The best result reached was by a student who passed through  the test in 223 seconds with only 1 mistake, the total therefore being  233. Next came a student who did it in 215 seconds with 3 mistakes,  total, 245; then in 228 seconds with 2 omissions, total, 248, and so  on.    I recapitulate: With men on the educational level and at the age that  comes in question for their first appointment in the service of an  electric railway company, the test proposed ought to be applied  according to this scheme. If they make more than 20 mistakes, they  ought to be excluded; if they make less than 20 mistakes, the number  of omissions is to be multiplied by 10 and added to the number of  seconds. If the sum is less than 350, their mental fitness for the  avoidance of accidents is very high, between 350 and 450 fair, and  more than 550 not acceptable under any conditions. I submit this,  however, with the emphasis on my previous statement that the  investigation is still in its first stage, and that it will need a  long cooeperation between science and industry in order to determine  the desirable modifications and special conditions which may become  necessary in making the employment of men partly dependent upon such  psychological tests. There can be no doubt that the experiments could  be improved in many directions. But even in this first, not adequately  tested, form, an experimental investigation of this kind which demands  from each individual hardly 10 minutes would be sufficient to exclude  perhaps one fourth of those who are nowadays accepted into the service  as motormen. This 25 per cent of the applicants do not deserve any  blame. In many other occupations they might render excellent service;  they are neither careless nor reckless, and they do not act against  instructions, but their psychical mechanism makes them unfit for that  particular combination of attention and imagination which ought to be  demanded for the special task of the motorman. If the many thousands  of injury and the many hundreds of death cases could be reduced by  such a test at least to a half, then the conditions of transportation  would have been improved more than by any alterations in the technical  apparatus, which usually are the only objects of interest in the  discussion of specialists. The whole world of industry will have to  learn the great lesson, that of the three great factors, material,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15164"],[0,"Folk Tales Every Child Should Know (#10)"],[1,"leave of his father, mounted his horse, and rode away in  search of his bride. It came to pass that he rode through a vast forest,  and through the forest he rode on and on till he lost the road. And as  he was wandering with his horse in thickets and amongst rocks and  morasses, not knowing which way to turn, he heard somebody shout behind  him, \"Hi! stop!\" The prince looked round, and saw a tall man hastening  after him. \"Stop and take me with you, and take me into your service,  and you won't regret it!\" \"Who are you,\" said the prince, \"and what can  you do?\" \"My name is Long, and I can extend myself. Do you see a bird's  nest in that pine yonder? I will bring you the nest down without having  to climb up.\"    Long then began to extend himself; his body grew rapidly till it was as  tall as the pine; he then reached the nest, and in a moment contracted  himself again and gave it to the prince. \"You know your business well,  but what's the use of birds' nests to me, if you can't conduct me out of  this forest?\"    \"Ahem! that's an easy matter,\" said Long, and began to extend himself  till he was thrice as high as the highest fir in the forest, looked  round, and said: \"Here on this side we have the nearest way out of the  forest.\" He then contracted himself, took the horse by the bridle, and  before the prince had any idea of it, they were beyond the forest.  Before them was a long and wide plain, and beyond the plain tall gray  rocks like the walls of a large town, and mountains overgrown with  forest trees.    \"Yonder, sir, goes my comrade!\" said Long, and pointed suddenly to the  plain; \"you should take him also into your service; I believe he would  serve you well.\" \"Shout to him, and call him hither, that I may see what  he is good for.\" \"It is a little too far, sir,\" said Long; \"he would  hardly hear me, and it would take a long time before he came, because he  has a great deal to carry. I'll jump after him instead.\" Then Long again  extended himself to such a height that his head plunged into the clouds,  made two or three steps, took his comrade by the arm, and placed him  before the prince. He was a short, thick-set fellow, with a paunch like  a sixty-four-gallon cask. \"Who are you?\" demanded the prince, \"and what  can you do?\" \"My name, sir, is Broad; I can widen myself.\" \"Give me a  specimen.\" \"Ride quick, sir, quick, back into the forest!\" cried Broad,  as he began to blow himself out.    The prince didn't understand why he was to ride away; but seeing that  Long made all haste to get into the forest, he spurred his horse and  rode full gallop after him. It was high time that he did ride away, or  else Broad would have squashed him, horse and all, as his paunch rapidly  grew in all directions; it filled everything everywhere, just as if a  mountain had rolled up. Broad then ceased to blow himself out, and took  himself in again, raising such a wind that the trees in the forest bowed  and bent, and became what he was at first. \"You have played me a nice  trick,\" said the prince, \"but I shan't find such a fellow every day;  come with me.\"    They proceeded further. When they approached the rocks, they met a man  who had his eyes bandaged with a handkerchief. \"Sir, this is our third  comrade,\" said Long, \"you ought to take him also into your service. I'm  sure he won't eat his victuals for naught.\"    \"Who are you?\" the prince asked him, \"and why are your eyes bandaged?  You don't see your way!\" \"No, sir, quite the contrary! It is just  because I see too well that I am obliged to bandage my eyes; I see with  bandaged eyes just as well as others with unbandaged eyes; and if I  unbandage them I look everything through and through, and when I gaze  sharply at anything it catches fire and bursts into flame, and what  can't burn splits into pieces. For this reason my name is Sharpsight.\"  He then turned to a rock opposite, removed the bandage, and fixed his  flaming eyes upon it; the rock began to crackle, pieces flew on every  side, and in a very short time nothing of it remained but a heap of  sand, on which something glittered like fire. Sharpsight went to fetch  it, and brought it to the prince. It was pure gold.    \"Heigho! you're a fellow that money can't purchase!\" said the prince.  \"He is a fool who wouldn't make use of your services, and if you have  such good sight, look and tell me whether it is far to the iron castle,  and what is now going on there?\" \"If you rode by yourself, sir,\"  answered Sharpsight, \"maybe you wouldn't get there within a year; but  with us you'll arrive to-day--they're just getting supper ready for us.\"  \"And what is my bride doing?\"        \"An iron lattice is before her,         In a tower that's high         She doth sit and sigh,       A wizard watch and ward keeps o'er her.\"    The prince cried, \"Whoever is well disposed, help me to set her free!\"  They all promised to help him. They guided him among the gray rocks  through the breach that Sharpsight had made in them with his eyes, and  farther and farther on through rocks, through high mountains and deep  forests, and wherever there was any obstacle in the road, forthwith it  was removed by the three comrades. And when the sun was declining toward  the west, the mountains began to become lower, the forests less dense,  and the rocks concealed themselves amongst the heath; and when it was  almost on the point of setting, the prince saw not far before him an  iron castle; and when it was actually setting, he rode by an iron bridge  to the gate, and as soon as it had set, up rose the iron bridge of  itself, the gate closed with a single movement, and the prince and his  companions were captives in the iron castle.    When they had looked round the court, the prince put his horse up in the  stable, where everything was ready for it, and then they went into the  castle. In the court, in the stable, in the castle hall, and in the  rooms, they saw in the twilight many richly-dressed people, gentlemen  and servants, but not one of them stirred--they were all turned to  stone. They went through several rooms, and came into the supper-room.  This was brilliantly lighted up, and in the midst was a table, and on it  plenty of good meats and drinks, and covers were laid for four persons.  They waited and waited, thinking that some one would come: but when  nobody came for a long time, they sat down and ate and drank what the  palate fancied.    When they had done eating, they looked about to find where to sleep.  Thereupon the door flew open unexpectedly all at once, and into the room  came the wizard; a bent old man in a long black garb, with a bald head,  a gray beard down to his knees, and three iron hoops instead of a  girdle. By the hand he led a beautiful, very beautiful damsel, dressed  in white; she had a silver girdle round her waist, and a crown of pearls  on her head, but was pale and sad, as if she had risen from the grave.  The prince recognized her at once, sprang forward, and went to meet her;  but before he could utter a word the wizard addressed him: \"I know for  what you have come; you want to take the princess away. Well, be it so!  Take her, if you can keep her in sight for three nights, so that she  doesn't vanish from you. If she vanishes, you will be turned into stone  as well as your three servants; like all who have come before you.\" He  then motioned the princess to a seat and departed.    The prince could not take his eyes off the princess, so beautiful was  she. He began to talk to her, and asked her all manner of questions, but  she neither answered nor smiled, nor looked at any one more than if she  had been of marble. He sat down by her, and determined not to sleep all  night long lest she should vanish from him, and, to make surer, Long  extended himself like a strap, and wound himself round the whole room  along the wall; Broad posted himself in the doorway, swelled himself up,  and stopped it up so tight that not even a mouse could have slipped  through; while Sharpsight placed himself against a pillar in the midst  of the room on the look-out. But after a time they all began to nod,  fell asleep, and slept the whole night, just as if the wizard had thrown  them into the water.    In the morning, when it began to dawn, the prince was the first to wake,  but--as if a knife had been thrust into his heart--the princess was  gone! He forthwith awoke his servants, and asked what was to be done.  \"Never mind, sir,\" said Sharpsight, and looked sharply out through the  window, \"I see her already. A hundred miles hence is a forest, in the  midst of the forest an old oak, and on the top of the oak an acorn, and  she is that acorn.\" Long immediately took him on his shoulders, extended  himself, and went ten miles at a step, while Sharpsight showed him the  way.    No more time elapsed than would have been wanted to move once round a  cottage before they were back again, and Long delivered the acorn to the  prince. \"Sir, let it fall on the ground.\" The prince let it fall and  that moment the princess stood beside him. And when the sun began to  show itself beyond the mountains, the folding doors flew open with a  crash, and the wizard entered the room and smiled spitefully; but when  he saw the princess he frowned, growled, and bang! one of the iron hoops  which he wore splintered and sprang off him. He then took the damsel by  the hand and led her away.    The whole day after the prince had nothing to do but walk up and down  the castle, and round about the castle, and look at the wonderful  things that were there. It was everywhere as if life had been lost in a  single moment. In one hall he saw a prince, who held in both hands a  brandished sword, as if he intended to cleave somebody in twain; but the  blow never fell: he had been turned into stone. In one chamber was a  knight turned into stone, just as if he had been fleeing from some one  in terror, and, stumbling on the threshold, had taken a"]]]
