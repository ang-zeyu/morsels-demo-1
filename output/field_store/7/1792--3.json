Lead thou the way in the venture, I will follow after thee,\"  said Gascoyne.    As Myles had said, the climbing from roof to roof was a matter easy  enough to an active pair of lads like themselves; but when, by-and-by,  they reached the wall of the tower itself, they found the hidden window  much higher from the roof than they had judged from below--perhaps ten  or twelve feet--and it was, besides, beyond the eaves and out of their  reach.    Myles looked up and looked down. Above was the bushy thickness of the  ivy, the branches as thick as a woman's wrist, knotted and intertwined;  below was the stone pavement of a narrow inner court between two of the  stable buildings.    \"Methinks I can climb to yon place,\" said he.    \"Thou'lt break thy neck an thou tryest,\" said Gascoyne, hastily.    \"Nay,\" quoth Myles, \"I trust not; but break or make, we get not there  without trying. So here goeth for the venture.\"    \"Thou art a hare-brained knave as ever drew breath of life,\" quoth  Gascoyne, \"and will cause me to come to grief some of these fine days.  Ne'theless, an thou be Jack Fool and lead the way, go, and I will be Tom  Fool and follow anon. If thy neck is worth so little, mine is worth no  more.\"    It was indeed a perilous climb, but that special providence which guards  reckless lads befriended them, as it has thousands of their kind before  and since. So, by climbing from one knotted, clinging stem to another,  they were presently seated snugly in the ivied niche in the window. It  was barred from within by a crumbling shutter, the rusty fastening of  which, after some little effort upon the part of the two, gave way, and  entering the narrow opening, they found themselves in a small triangular  passage-way, from which a steep flight of stone steps led down through a  hollow in the massive wall to the room below.    At the bottom of the steps was a heavy oaken door, which stood ajar,  hanging upon a single rusty hinge, and from the room within a dull, gray  light glimmered faintly. Myles pushed the door farther open; it creaked  and grated horribly on its rusty hinge, and, as in instant answer to  the discordant shriek, came a faint piping squeaking, a rustling and a  pattering of soft footsteps.    \"The ghosts!\" cried Gascoyne, in a quavering whisper, and for a moment  Myles felt the chill of goose-flesh creep up and down his spine. But the  next moment he laughed.    \"Nay,\" said he, \"they be rats. Look at yon fellow, Francis! Be'st as big  as Mother Joan's kitten. Give me that stone.\" He flung it at the rat,  and it flew clattering across the floor. There was another pattering  rustle of hundreds of feet, and then a breathless silence.    The boys stood looking around them, and a strange enough sight it was.  The room was a perfect circle of about twenty feet across, and was  piled high with an indistinguishable mass of lumber--rude tables, ruder  chairs, ancient chests, bits and remnants of cloth and sacking and  leather, old helmets and pieces of armor of a by-gone time, broken  spears and pole-axes, pots and pans and kitchen furniture of all sorts  and kinds.    A straight beam of sunlight fell through a broken shutter like a bar of  gold, and fell upon the floor in a long streak of dazzling light that  illuminated the whole room with a yellow glow.    \"By 'r Lady!\" said Gascoyne at last, in a hushed voice, \"here is Father  Time's garret for sure. Didst ever see the like, Myles? Look at yon  arbalist; sure Brutus himself used such an one!\"    \"Nay,\" said Myles; \"but look at this saddle. Marry, here be'st a rat's  nest in it.\"    Clouds of dust rose as they rummaged among the mouldering mass, setting  them coughing and sneezing. Now and then a great gray rat would shoot  out beneath their very feet, and disappear, like a sudden shadow, into  some hole or cranny in the wall.    \"Come,\" said Myles at last, brushing the dust from his jacket, \"an we  tarry here longer we will have chance to see no other sights; the sun is  falling low.\"    An arched stair-way upon the opposite side of the room from which they  had entered wound upward through the wall, the stone steps being lighted  by narrow slits of windows cut through the massive masonry. Above the  room they had just left was another of the same shape and size, but with  an oak floor, sagging and rising into hollows and hills, where the joist  had rotted away beneath. It was bare and empty, and not even a rat  was to be seen. Above was another room; above that, another; all the  passages and stairways which connected the one story with the other  being built in the wall, which was, where solid, perhaps fifteen feet  thick.    From the third floor a straight flight of steps led upward to a closed  door, from the other side of which shone the dazzling brightness of  sunlight, and whence came a strange noise--a soft rustling, a melodious  murmur. The boys put their shoulders against the door, which was  fastened, and pushed with might and main--once, twice; suddenly the  lock gave way, and out they pitched headlong into a blaze of sunlight.  A deafening clapping and uproar sounded in their ears, and scores of  pigeons, suddenly disturbed, rose in stormy flight.    They sat up and looked around them in silent wonder. They were in a  bower of leafy green. It was the top story of the tower, the roof of  which had crumbled and toppled in, leaving it open to the sky, with only  here and there a slanting beam or two supporting a portion of the tiled  roof, affording shelter for the nests of the pigeons crowded closely  together. Over everything the ivy had grown in a mantling sheet--a  net-work of shimmering green, through which the sunlight fell  flickering.    \"This passeth wonder,\" said Gascoyne, at last breaking the silence.    \"Aye,\" said Myles, \"I did never see the like in all my life.\" Then,  \"Look, yonder is a room beyond; let us see what it is, Francis.\"    Entering an arched door-way, the two found themselves in a beautiful  little vaulted chapel, about eighteen feet long and twelve or fifteen  wide. It comprised the crown of one of the large massive buttresses, and  from it opened the row of arched windows which could be seen from below  through the green shimmering of the ivy leaves. The boys pushed aside  the trailing tendrils and looked out and down. The whole castle lay  spread below them, with the busy people unconsciously intent upon the  matters of their daily work. They could see the gardener, with bowed  back, patiently working among the flowers in the garden, the stable-boys  below grooming the horses, a bevy of ladies in the privy garden playing  at shuttlecock with battledoors of wood, a group of gentlemen walking  up and down in front of the Earl's house. They could see the household  servants hurrying hither and thither, two little scullions at  fisticuffs, and a kitchen girl standing in the door-way scratching her  frowzy head.    It was all like a puppetshow of real life, each acting unconsciously a  part in the play. The cool wind came in through the rustling leaves and  fanned their cheeks, hot with the climb up the winding stair-way.    \"We will call it our Eyry,\" said Gascoyne \"and we will be the hawks that  live here.\" And that was how it got its name.    The next day Myles had the armorer make him a score of large spikes,  which he and Gascoyne drove between the ivy branches and into the cement  of the wall, and so made a safe passageway by which to reach the window  niche in the wall.        CHAPTER 11    THE TWO friends kept the secret of the Eyry to themselves for a little  while, now and then visiting the old tower to rummage among the lumber  stored in the lower room, or to loiter away the afternoon in the windy  solitudes of the upper heights. And in that little time, when the  ancient keep was to them a small world unknown to any but themselves--a  world far away above all the dull matters of every-day life--they talked  of many things that might else never have been known to one another.  Mostly they spoke the crude romantic thoughts and desires of boyhood's  time--chaff thrown to the wind, in which, however, lay a few stray  seeds, fated to fall to good earth, and to ripen to fruition in  manhood's day.    In the intimate talks of that time Myles imparted something of his  honest solidity to Gascoyne's somewhat weathercock nature, and to  Myles's ruder and more uncouth character Gascoyne lent a tone of his  gentler manners, learned in his pagehood service as attendant upon the  Countess and her ladies.    In other things, also, the character and experience of the one lad  helped to supply what was lacking in the other. Myles was replete with  old Latin gestes, fables, and sermons picked up during his school life,  in those intervals of his more serious studies when Prior Edward had  permitted him to browse in the greener pastures of the Gesta Romanorum  and the Disciplina Clericalis of the monastery library, and Gascoyne was  never weary of hearing him tell those marvellous stories culled from the  crabbed Latin of the old manuscript volumes.    Upon his part Gascoyne was full of the lore of the waiting-room and  the antechamber, and Myles, who in all his life had never known a lady,  young or old, excepting his mother, was never tired of lying silently  listening to Gascoyne's chatter of the gay doings of the castle  gentle-life, in which he had taken part so often in the merry days of  his pagehood.    \"I do wonder,\" said Myles, quaintly, \"that thou couldst ever find the  courage to bespeak a young maid, Francis. Never did I do so, nor ever  could. Rather would I face three strong men than one young damsel.\"    Whereupon Gascoyne burst out laughing. \"Marry!\" quoth he, \"they be  no such terrible things, but gentle and pleasant spoken, and soft and  smooth as any cat.\"    \"No matter for that,\" said Myles; \"I would not face one such for  worlds.\"    It was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15580"],[0,"The Rustlers of Pecos County (#10)"],[1," not drunk, and I'm on the square,\" I said bluntly. \"You've taken me  for a no-good cow puncher without any brains. Wake up, Morton. If you  never size up your neighbors any better than you have me--well, you  won't get any richer.\"    It was sheer enjoyment for me to make my remarks to these men, pregnant  with meaning. Morton showed his pleasure, his interest, but his faith  held aloof.    \"I've got some money. I had some. Then the cards have run lucky. Will  you let me in on some kind of deal? Will you start me up as a stockman,  with a little herd all my own?\"    \"Russ, this's durn strange, comin' from Sampson's cowboy,\" he said.    \"I'm not in his outfit. My job's with Miss Sampson. She's fine, but the  old man? Nit! He's been after me for weeks. I won't last long. That's  one reason why I want to start up for myself.\"    \"Hoden sent you to me, did he? Poor ol' Jim. Wal, Russ, to come out  flat-footed, you'd be foolish to buy cattle now. I don't want to take  your money an' see you lose out. Better go back across the Pecos where  the rustlers ain't so strong. I haven't had more'n twenty-five-hundred  head of stock for ten years. The rustlers let me hang on to a breedin'  herd. Kind of them, ain't it?\"    \"Sort of kind. All I hear is rustlers.\" I replied with impatience. \"You  see, I haven't ever lived long in a rustler-run county. Who heads the  gang anyway?\"    Frank Morton looked at me with a curiously-amused smile.    \"I hear lots about Jack Blome and Snecker. Everybody calls them out and  out bad. Do they head this mysterious gang?\"    \"Russ, I opine Blome an' Snecker parade themselves off boss rustlers  same as gun throwers. But thet's the love such men have for bein'  thought hell. That's brains headin' the rustler gang hereabouts.\"    \"Maybe Blome and Snecker are blinds. Savvy what I mean, Morton? Maybe  there's more in the parade than just the fame of it.\"    Morton snapped his big jaw as if to shut in impulsive words.    \"Look here, Morton. I'm not so young in years even if I am young west of  the Pecos. I can figure ahead. It stands to reason, no matter how damn  strong these rustlers are, how hidden their work, however involved with  supposedly honest men--they can't last.\"    \"They come with the pioneers an' they'll last as long as thar's a single  steer left,\" he declared.    \"Well, if you take that view of circumstances I just figure you as one  of the rustlers!\"    Morton looked as if he were about to brain me with the butt of his whip.  His anger flashed by then as unworthy of him, and, something striking  him as funny, he boomed out a laugh.    \"It's not so funny,\" I went on. \"If you're going to pretend a yellow  streak, what else will I think?\"    \"Pretend?\" he repeated.    \"Sure. You can't fool me, Morton. I know men of nerve. And here in Pecos  they're not any different from those in other places. I say if you show  anything like a lack of sand it's all bluff.    \"By nature you've got nerve. There are a lot of men round Linrock who're  afraid of their shadows, afraid to be out after dark, afraid to open  their mouths. But you're not one.    \"So, I say, if you claim these rustlers will last, you're pretending  lack of nerve just to help the popular idea along. For they can't last.    \"Morton, I don't want to be a hard-riding cowboy all my days. Do you  think I'd let fear of a gang of rustlers stop me from going in business  with a rancher? Nit! What you need out here in Pecos is some new  blood--a few youngsters like me to get you old guys started. Savvy what  I mean?\"    \"Wal, I reckon I do,\" he replied, looking as if a storm had blown over  him.    I gauged the hold the rustler gang had on Linrock by the difficult job  it was to stir this really courageous old cattleman. He had grown up  with the evil. To him it must have been a necessary one, the same as dry  seasons and cyclones.    \"Russ, I'll look you up the next time I come to town,\" he said soberly.    We parted, and I, more than content with the meeting, retraced my steps  down street to the Hope So saloon.    Here I entered, bent on tasks as sincere as the ones just finished, but  displeasing, because I had to mix with a low, profane set, to cultivate  them, to drink occasionally despite my deftness at emptying glasses on  the floor, to gamble with them and strangers, always playing the part of  a flush and flashy cowboy, half drunk, ready to laugh or fight.    On the night of the fifth day after Steele's departure, I went, as was  my habit, to the rendezvous we maintained at the pile of rocks out in  the open.    The night was clear, bright starlight, without any moon, and for this  latter fact safer to be abroad. Often from my covert I had seen dark  figures skulking in and out of Linrock.    It would have been interesting to hold up these mysterious travelers; so  far, however, this had not been our game. I had enough to keep my own  tracks hidden, and my own comings and goings.    I liked to be out in the night, with the darkness close down to the  earth, and the feeling of a limitless open all around. Not only did I  listen for Steele's soft step, but for any sound--the yelp of coyote or  mourn of wolf, the creak of wind in the dead brush, the distant clatter  of hoofs, a woman's singing voice faint from the town.    This time, just when I was about to give up for that evening, Steele  came looming like a black giant long before I heard his soft step. It  was good to feel his grip, even if it hurt, because after five days I  had begun to worry.    \"Well, old boy, how's tricks?\" he asked easily.    \"Well, old man, did you land that son of a gun in jail?\"    \"You bet I did. And he'll stay there for a while. Del Rio rather liked  the idea, Russ. All right there. I side-stepped Sanderson on the way  back. But over here at the little village--Sampson they call it--I was  held up. Couldn't help it, because there wasn't any road around.\"    \"Held up?\" I queried.    \"That's it, the buckboard was held up. I got into the brush in time to  save my bacon. They began to shoot too soon.\"    \"Did you get any of them?\"    \"Didn't stay to see,\" he chuckled. \"Had to hoof it to Linrock, and it's  a good long walk.\"    \"Been to your 'dobe yet to-night?\"    \"I slipped in at the back. Russ, it bothered me some to make sure no one  was laying for me in the dark.\"    \"You'll have to get a safer place. Why not take to the open every  night?\"    \"Russ, that's well enough on a trail. But I need grub, and I've got to  have a few comforts. I'll risk the 'dobe yet a little.\"    Then I narrated all that I had seen and done and heard during his  absence, holding back one thing. What I did tell him sobered him at  once, brought the quiet, somber mood, the thoughtful air.    \"So that's all. Well, it's enough.\"    \"All pertaining to our job, Vaughn,\" I replied. \"The rest is sentiment,  perhaps. I had a pretty bad case of moons over the little Langdon girl.  But we quarreled. And it's ended now. Just as well, too, because if  she'd....\"    \"Russ, did you honestly care for her? The real thing, I mean?\"    \"I--I'm afraid so. I'm sort of hurt inside. But, hell! There's one thing  sure, a love affair might have hindered me, made me soft. I'm glad it's  over.\"    He said no more, but his big hand pressing on my knee told me of his  sympathy, another indication that there was nothing wanting in this  Ranger.    \"The other thing concerns you,\" I went on, somehow reluctant now to tell  this. \"You remember how I heard Wright making you out vile to Miss  Sampson? Swore you'd never come back? Well, after he had gone, when  Sally said he'd meant you'd be killed, Miss Sampson felt bad about it.  She said she ought to be glad if someone killed you, but she couldn't  be. She called you a bloody ruffian, yet she didn't want you shot.    \"She said some things about the difference between your hideous  character and your splendid stature. Called you a magnificent  fellow--that was it. Well, then she choked up and confessed something to  Sally in shame and disgrace.\"    \"Shame--disgrace?\" echoed Steele, greatly interested. \"What?\"    \"She confessed she had been taken with you--had her little dream about  you. And she hated herself for it.\"    Never, I thought, would I forget Vaughn Steele's eyes. It did not  matter that it was dark; I saw the fixed gleam, then the leaping,  shadowy light.    \"Did she say that?\" His voice was not quite steady. \"Wonderful! Even if  it only lasted a minute! She might--we might--If it wasn't for this  hellish job! Russ, has it dawned on you yet, what I've got to do to  Diane Sampson?\"    \"Yes,\" I replied. \"Vaughn, you haven't gone sweet on her?\"    What else could I make of that terrible thing in his eyes? He did not  reply to that at all. I thought my arm would break in his clutch.    \"You said you knew what I've got to do to Diane Sampson,\" he repeated  hoarsely.    \"Yes, you've got to ruin her happiness, if not her life.\"    \"Why? Speak out, Russ. All this comes like a blow. There for a little I  hoped you had worked out things differently from me. No hope. Ruin her  life! Why?\"    I could explain this strange agitation in Steele in no other way except  that realization had brought keen suffering as incomprehensible as it  was painful. I could not tell if it came from suddenly divined love for  Diane Sampson equally with a poignant conviction that his fate was to  wreck her. But I did see that he needed to speak out the brutal truth.    \"Steele, old man, you'll ruin Diane Sampson, because, as arrest looks  improbable to me, you'll have to kill her father.\"    \"My God! Why, why? Say it!\"    \"Because Sampson is the leader of the Linrock gang of rustlers.\"    That night before we parted we had gone rather deeply into the plan of  action for the immediate future.    First I gave Steele my earnest counsel and then as stiff an argument as  I knew how to put up, all anent the absolute necessity of his eternal  vigilance. If he got shot in a fair"]]]
