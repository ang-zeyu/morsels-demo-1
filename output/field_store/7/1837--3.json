He gave every indication, in a word, at this early age, of  possessing that uncommon combination of mental and personal qualities  which fits those who possess it to secure and maintain a great  ascendency among mankind.    The unnatural union which had been formed on the death of Ethelwolf  between his youthful widow and her aged husband's son did not long  continue. The people of England were very much shocked at such a  marriage, and a great prelate, the Bishop of Winchester, remonstrated  against it with such sternness and authority, that Ethelbald not only  soon put his wife away, but submitted to a severe penance which the  bishop imposed upon him in retribution for his sin. Judith, thus  forsaken, soon afterward sold the lands and estates which her two  husbands had severally granted her, and, taking a final leave of  Alfred, whom she tenderly loved, she returned to her native land.  Not long after this, she was married a third time, to a continental  prince, whose dominions lay between the Baltic and the Rhine, and  from this period she disappears entirely from the stage of Alfred's  history.          CHAPTER V.    STATE OF ENGLAND.      Having thus brought down the narrative of Alfred's early life as far  and as fully as the records that remain enable us to do so, we resume  the general history of the national affairs by returning to the  subject of the depredations and conquests of the Danes, and the  circumstances connected with Alfred's accession to the throne.    To give the reader some definite and clear ideas of the nature of  this warfare, it will be well to describe in detail some few of the  incidents and scenes which ancient historians have recorded. The  following was one case which occurred:    The Danes, it must be premised, were particularly hostile to the  monasteries and religious establishments of the Anglo-Saxons. In the  first place, they were themselves pagans, and they hated Christianity.  In the second place, they knew that these places of sacred seclusion  were often the depositories selected for the custody or concealment of  treasure; and, besides the treasures which kings and potentates often  placed in them for safety, these establishments possessed utensils of  gold and silver for the service of the chapels, and a great variety  of valuable gifts, such as pious saints or penitent sinners were  continually bequeathing to them. The Danes were, consequently, never  better pleased than when sacking an abbey or a monastery. In such  exploits they gratified their terrible animal propensities, both of  hatred and love, by the cruelties which they perpetrated personally  upon the monks and the nuns, and at the same time enriched their  coffers with the most valuable spoils. A dreadful tale is told of  one company of nuns, who, in the consternation and terror which they  endured at the approach of a band of Danes, mutilated their faces in a  manner too horrid to be described, as the only means left to them for  protection against the brutality of their foes. They followed,  in adopting this measure, the advice and the example of the lady  superior. It was effectual.    There was a certain abbey, called Crowland, which was in those days  one of the most celebrated in the island. It was situated near the  southern border of Lincolnshire, which lies on the eastern side of  England. There is a great shallow bay, called The Wash, on this  eastern shore, and it is surrounded by a broad tract of low and marshy  land, which is drained by long canals, and traversed by roads built  upon embankments. Dikes skirt the margins of the streams, and  wind-mills are engaged in perpetual toil to raise the water from the  fields into the channels by which it is conveyed away.    Crowland is at the confluence of two rivers, which flow sluggishly  through this flat but beautiful and verdant region. The remains of the  old abbey still stand, built on piles driven into the marshy ground,  and they form at the present time a very interesting mass of ruins.  The year before Alfred acceded to the throne, the abbey was in all its  glory; and on one occasion it furnished _two hundred_ men, who went  out under the command of one of the monks, named Friar Joly, to join  the English armies and fight the Danes.    The English army was too small notwithstanding this desperate effort  to strengthen it. They stood, however, all day in a compact band,  protecting themselves with their shields from the arrows of the foot  soldiers of the enemy, and with their pikes from the onset of the  cavalry. At night the Danes retired, as if giving up the contest;  but as soon as the Saxons, now released from their positions of  confinement and restraint, had separated a little, and began to  feel somewhat more secure, their implacable foes returned again and  attacked them in separate masses, and with more fury than before. The  Saxons endeavored in vain either to defend themselves or escape. As  fast as their comrades were killed, the survivors stood upon the heaps  of the slain, to gain what little advantage they could from so slight  an elevation. Nearly all at length were killed. A few escaped into a  neighboring wood, where they lay concealed during the day following,  and then, when the darkness of the succeeding night came to enable  them to conceal their journey, they made their way to the abbey, to  make known to the anxious inmates of it the destruction of the army,  and to warn them of the imminence of the impending danger to which  they were now exposed.    A dreadful scene of consternation and terror ensued. The affrighted  messengers told their tale, breathless and wayworn, at the door of the  chapel, where the monks were engaged at their devotions. The aisles  were filled with exclamations of alarm and despairing lamentations.  The abbot, whose name was Theodore, immediately began to take measures  suited to the emergency. He resolved to retain at the monastery only  some aged monks and a few children, whose utter defenselessness, he  thought, would disarm the ferocity and vengeance of the Danes. The  rest, only about thirty, however, in number--nearly all the brethren  having gone out under the Friar Joly into the great battle--were put  on board a boat to be sent down the river. It seems at first view a  strange idea to send away the vigorous and strong, and keep the infirm  and helpless at the scene of danger; but the monks knew very well that  all resistance was vain, and that, consequently, their greatest safety  would lie in the absence of all appearance of the possibility of  resistance.    The treasures were sent away, too, with all the men. They hastily  collected all the valuables together, the relics, the jewels, and all  of the gold and silver plate which could be easily removed, and  placed them in a boat--packing them as securely as their haste and  trepidation allowed. The boats glided down the river till they came to  a lonely spot, where an anchorite or sort of hermit lived in solitude.  The men and the treasures were to be intrusted to his charge. He  concealed the men in the thickets and other hiding-places in the  woods, and buried the treasures.    In the mean time, as soon as the boats and the party of monks which  accompanied them had left the abbey, the Abbot Theodore and the old  monks that remained with him urged on the work of concealing that part  of the treasures which had not been taken away. All of the plate which  could not be easily transported, and a certain very rich and costly  table employed for the service of the altar, and many sacred and  expensive garments used by the higher priests in their ceremonies, had  been left behind, as they could not be easily removed. These the abbot  and the monks concealed in the most secure places that they could  find, and then, clothing themselves in their priestly robes, they  assembled in the chapel, and resumed their exercises of devotion. To  be found in so sacred a place and engaged in so holy an avocation  would have been a great protection from any Christian soldiery; but  the monks entirely misconceived the nature of the impulses by which  human nature is governed, in supposing that it would have any  restraining influence upon the pagan Danes. The first thing the  ferocious marauders did, on breaking into the sacred precincts of  the chapel, was to cut down the venerable abbot at the altar, in his  sacerdotal robes, and then to push forward the work of slaying every  other inmate of the abbey, feeble and helpless as they were. Only one  was saved.    This one was a boy, about ten years old. His name was Turgar. He was  a handsome boy, and one of the Danish chieftains was struck with his  countenance and air, in the midst of the slaughter, and took pity on  him. The chieftain's name was Count Sidroc. Sidroc drew Turgar out  of the immediate scene of danger, and gave him a Danish garment,  directing him, at the same time, to throw aside his own, and then to  follow him wherever he went, and keep close to his side, as if he were  a Dane. The boy, relieved from his terrors by this hope of protection,  obeyed implicitly. He followed Sidroc every where, and his life  was saved. The Danes, after killing all the others, ransacked and  plundered the monastery, broke open the tombs in their search for  concealed treasures, and, after taking all that they could discover,  they set the edifices on fire wherever they could find wood-work that  would burn, and went away, leaving the bodies slowly burning in the  grand and terrible funeral pile.    From Crowland the marauders proceeded, taking Turgar with them, to  another large and wealthy abbey in the neighborhood, which they  plundered and destroyed, as they had the abbey at Crowland. Sidroc  made Turgar his own attendant, keeping him always near him. When  the expedition had completed their second conquest, they packed the  valuables which they had obtained from both"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16546"],[0,"Hinduism and Buddhism, An Historical Sketch, Vol. 2 (#10)"],[1,"of Amitabha's paradise, though it strains the doctrine of  Karma to the utmost, does not repudiate it. For the believer performs  an act--to wit, the invocation of Amitabha--to which has been attached  the wonderful result that the performer is reborn in a blessed state.  This is not essentially different from the idea found in the Pali  Canon that attentions paid to a Buddha may be rewarded by a happy  rebirth in heaven.[100]    Mahayanist metaphysics, like all other departments of this theology,  are beset by the difficulty that the authorities who treat of them are  not always in accord and do not pretend to be in accord. The idea that  variety is permissible in belief and conduct is deeply rooted in later  Buddhism: there are many vehicles, some better than others no doubt  and some very ramshackle, but all are capable of conveying their  passengers to salvation. Nominally the Mahayana was divided into only  two schools of philosophy: practically every important treatise  propounds a system with features of its own. The two schools are the  Yogacaras and Madhyamikas.[101] Both are idealists and deny the  reality of the external world, but whereas the Yogacaras (also called  Vijnanavadins) admit that Vijnana or consciousness and the series of  states of which it consists are real, the Madhyamikas refuse the title  of reality to both the subjective and the objective world and hence  gained a reputation of being complete nihilists. Probably the  Madhyamikas are the older school.    Both schools attach importance to the distinction between relative and  absolute knowledge. Relative knowledge is true for human beings living  in the world: that is to say it is not more false than the world of  appearance in which they live. The Hinayanist doctrines are true in  this sense. Absolute knowledge rises above the world of appearance and  is altogether true but difficult to express in words. The Yogacara  makes three divisions, dividing the inferior knowledge into two. It  distinguishes first illusory knowledge (_parikalpita_) such as  mistaking a piece of rope for a snake or belief in the existence of  individual souls. Secondly knowledge which depends on the relations of  things (_paratantra_) and which though not absolutely wrong is  necessarily limited, such as belief in the real existence of ropes and  snakes. And thirdly absolute knowledge (_parinishpanna_), which  understands all things as the manifestation of an underlying  principle. The Madhyamikas more simply divide knowledge into  _samvriti-satya_ and _paramartha-satya_, that is the truth of  every-day life and transcendental truth. The world and ordinary  religion with its doctrines and injunctions about good works are real  and true as _samvriti_ but in absolute truth (_paramartham_) we  attain Nirvana and then the world with its human Buddhas and its gods  exists no more. The word _sunyam_ or _sunyata_, that is _void_, is  often used as the equivalent of _paramartham_. Void must be understood  as meaning not an abyss of nothingness but that which is found to be  devoid of all the attributes which we try to ascribe to it. The world  of ordinary experience is not void, for a great number of statements  can be made about it, but absolute truth is void, because nothing  whatever can be predicated of it. Yet even this colourless designation  is not perfectly accurate,[102] because neither being nor not-being  can be predicated of absolute truth. It is for this reason, namely  that they admit neither being nor not-being but something between the  two, that the followers of Nagarjuna are known as the Madhyamikas or  school of the middle doctrine, though the European reader is tempted  to say that their theories are extreme to the point of being a  _reductio ad absurdum_ of the whole system. Yet though much of their  logic seems late and useless sophistry, its affinity to early Buddhism  cannot be denied. The fourfold proposition that the answer to certain  questions cannot be any of the statements \"is,\" \"is not,\" \"both is and  is not,\" \"neither is nor is not,\" is part of the earliest known  stratum of Buddhism. The Buddha himself is represented as saying[103]  that most people hold either to a belief in being or to a belief in  not being. But neither belief is possible for one who considers the  question with full knowledge. \"That things have being is one extreme:  that things have no being is the other extreme. These extremes have  been avoided by the Tathagata and it is a middle doctrine that he  teaches,\" namely, dependent origination as explained in the chain of  twelve links. The Madhyamika theory that objects have no absolute and  independent existence but appear to exist in virtue of their relations  is a restatement of this ancient dictum.    The Mahayanist doctors find an ethical meaning in their negations. If  things possessed _svabhava_, real, absolute, self-determined  existence, then the four truths and especially the cessation of  suffering and attainment of sanctity would be impossible. For if  things were due not to causation but to their own self-determining  nature (and the Hindus always seem to understand real existence in  this sense) cessation of evil and attainment of the good would be  alike impossible: the four Noble Truths imply a world which is in a  state of constant becoming, that is a world which is not really  existent.    But for all that the doctrine of _sunyata_ as stated in the Madhyamika  aphorisms ascribed to Nagarjuna leaves an impression of audacious and  ingenious sophistry. After laying down that every object in the world  exists only in relation to every other object and has no  self-existence, the treatise proceeds to prove that rest and motion  are alike impossible. We speak about the path along which we are  passing but there is really no such thing, for if we divide the path  accurately, it always proves separable into the part which has been  passed over and the part which will be passed over. There is no part  which is being passed over. This of course amounts to a denial of the  existence of present time. Time consists of past and future separated  by an indivisible and immeasurable instant. The minimum of time which  has any meaning for us implies a change, and two elements, a former  and a subsequent. The present minute or the present hour are  fallacious expressions.[104]    Therefore no one ever _is passing_ along a path. Again you cannot  logically say that the passer is passing, for the sentence is  redundant: the verb adds nothing to the noun and _vice versa_: but on  the other hand you clearly cannot say that the non-passer is passing.  Again if you say that the passer and the passing are identical, you  overlook the distinction between the agent and the act and both become  unreal. But you cannot maintain that the passer is different from the  passing, for a passer as distinct from passing and passing as  distinct from a passer have no meaning. \"But how can two entities  exist at all, if they exist neither as identical with one another nor  as different from one another?\"    The above, though much abridged, gives an idea of the logic of these  sutras. They proceed to show that all manner of things, such as the  five skandhas, the elements, contact, attachment, fire and fuel,  origination, continuation and extinction have no real existence.  Similar reasoning is then applied to religious topics: the world of  transmigration as well as bondage and liberation are declared  non-existent. In reality no soul is in bondage and none is  released.[105] Similarly Karma, the Buddha himself, the four truths,  Nirvana and the twelve links in the chain of causation are all unreal.  This is not a declaration of scepticism. It means that the Buddha as a  human or celestial being and Nirvana as a state attainable in this  world are conceivable only in connection with this world and  therefore, like the world, unreal. No religious idea can enter into  the unreal (that is the practical) life of the world unless it is  itself unreal. This sounds a topsy turvy argument but it is really the  same as the Advaita doctrine. The Vedanta is on the one hand a scheme  of salvation for liberating souls which transmigrate unceasingly in a  world ruled by a personal God. But when true knowledge is attained,  the soul sees that it is identical with the Highest Brahman and that  souls which are in bondage and God who rules the world are illusions  like the world itself. But the Advaita has at least a verbal  superiority over the Madhyamika philosophy, for in its terminology  Brahman is the real and the existent contrasted with the world of  illusion. The result of giving to what the Advaita calls the real and  existent the name of sunyata or void is disconcerting. To say that  everything without distinction is non-existent is much the same as  saying that everything is existent. It only means that a wrong sense  is habitually given to the word exist, as if it meant to be  self-contained and without relation to other objects. Unless we can  make a verbal contrast and assert that there is something which does  exist, it seems futile to insist on the unreality of the world. Yet  this mode of thought is not confined to text-books on logic. It  invades the scriptures, and appears (for instance) in the Diamond  Cutter[106] which is still one of the most venerated books of devotion  in China and Japan. In this work the Buddha explains that a  Bodhisattva must resolve to deliver all living beings and yet must  understand that after he has thus delivered innumerable beings, no one  has been delivered. And why? Because no one is to be called a  Bodhisattva for whom there exists the idea of a being, or person.  Similarly a saint does not think that he is a saint, for if he did so  think, he would believe in a self, and a person.
