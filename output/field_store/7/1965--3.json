[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19145"],[0,"The Time Traders (#10)"],[1,".    \"Our post?\" Ross asked in a whisper.    Ashe nodded. He was studying the scene with an intent absorption which,  Ross knew, would impress every important detail upon his mind. That the  place had been burned was clear from the first. But why and by whom was  a problem vital to the two lurking in the brush.    It took them almost an hour to cross the valley--an hour of hiding,  casting about, searching. They had made a complete circle of the  destroyed post and Ashe stood in the shadow of a copse, rubbing clots of  mud from his hands and frowning up at the charred posts.    \"They weren't rushed. Or if they were, the attackers covered their trail  afterward--\" Ross ventured.    The older man shook his head. \"Tribesmen would not have muddled a trail  if they had won. No, this was no regular attack. There have been no  signs of a war party coming or leaving.\"    \"Then what?\" demanded Ross.    \"Lightning for one thing--and we'd better hope it was that. Or--\"  Ashe's blue eyes were very cold and bleak, as cold and bleak as the  countryside about them.    \"Or--?\" Ross dared to prompt him.    \"Or we have made contact with the Reds in the wrong way!\"    Ross's hand instinctively went to the dagger at his belt. Little help a  dagger would be in an unequal struggle like this! They were only two in  a thin web of men strung out through centuries of time with orders to  seek out that which did not fit properly into the pattern of the past:  to locate the enemy wherever in history or prehistory he had gone to  earth. Had the Reds been searching, too, and was this first disaster  their victory?    The time traders had their evidence when they at last ventured into what  had been the heart of Outpost Gog. Ross, inexperienced as he was in such  matters, could not mistake the signs of the explosion. There was a  crater on the crown of the hill, and Ashe stood apart from it, eying the  fragments about them--scorched wood, blackened stone.    \"The Reds?\"    \"It must have been. This damage was done by explosives.\"    It was clear why Outpost Gog could not report the disaster. The attack  had destroyed their one link with the post on this time level; the  concealed communicator had gone up with the blast.    \"Eleven--\" Ashe's finger tapped on the ornate buckle of his wide belt.  \"We have about ten days to stick it out,\" he added, \"and it seems we may  be able to use them to better advantage than just letting you learn how  it feels to walk about some four thousand years before you were born. We  have to find out--if we can--what happened here and why!\"    Ross gazed at the mess. \"Dig?\" he asked.    \"Some digging is indicated.\"    So they dug. Finally, black with charcoal smudges and sick with the  evidences of death they had chanced upon, they collapsed on the cleanest  spot they could find.    \"They must have hit at night,\" Ashe said slowly. \"Only at that time  would they find everyone here. Men don't trust a night filled with  ghosts, and our agents conform to local custom as usual. All of the post  people could be erased with one bomb at night.\"    All except two of them had been true Beaker traders, including women and  children. No Beaker trading post was large, and this one was unusually  small. The attacker had wiped out some twenty people, eighteen of them  innocent victims.    \"How long ago?\" Ross wanted to know.    \"Maybe two days. And this attack came without any warning, or Sandy  would have sent a message. He had no suspicions at all; his last reports  were all routine, which means that if they were on to him--and they must  have been, judging by the results--he was not even aware of it.\"    \"What do we do now?\"    Ashe looked at him. \"We wash--no--\" he corrected himself--\"we don't! We  go to Nodren's village. We are frightened, grief-stricken. We have found  our kinsmen dead under strange circumstances. We ask questions of one to  whom I am known as an inhabitant of this post.\"    So, covered with dirt, they walked along the trackway toward the  neighboring village with a weariness they did not have to counterfeit.    The dog sighted or perhaps scented them first. It was a rough-coated  beast, showing its fangs with a wolflike ferocity. But it was smaller  than a wolf, and it barked between its warning snarls. Ashe brought his  bow from beneath the shelter of his cloak and held it ready.    \"Ho, one comes to speak with Nodren--Nodren of the Hill!\"    Only the dog snapped and snarled. Ashe rubbed his forearm across his  face, the gesture of a weary and heartsick man, smearing the ash and  grime into an awesome mask.    \"Who speaks to Nodren--?\" There was a different twist to the  pronunciation of some words, but Ross was able to understand.    \"One who has hunted with him and feasted with him. The one who gave into  his hand the friendship gift of the ever-sharp knife. It is Assha of the  traders----\"    \"Go far from us, man of ill luck. You who are hunted by the evil  spirits.\" The last was a shrill cry.    Ashe remained where he was, facing into the bushes which hid the  tribesman.    \"Who speaks for Nodren yet not with the voice of Nodren?\" he demanded.  \"This is Assha who asks. We have drunk blood together and faced the  white wolf and the wild boar in their fury. Nodren lets not others speak  for him, for Nodren is a man and a chief!\"    \"And you are cursed!\" A stone flew through the air, striking a rain pool  and spattering mud on Ashe's boots. \"Go and take your evil with you!\"    \"Is it from the hand of Nodren or Nodren's young men that doom came upon  those of my blood? Have war arrows passed between the place of the  traders and the town of Nodren? Is that why you hide in the shadows so  that I, Assha, cannot look upon the face of one who speaks boldly and  throws stones?\"    \"No war arrows between us, trader. _We_ do not provoke the spirits of  the hills. No fire comes from the sky at night to eat us up with a noise  of many thunders. Lurgha speaks in such thunders; Lurgha's hand smites  with such fire. You have the Wrath of Lurgha upon you, trader! Keep  away from us lest Lurgha's wrath fall upon us also.\"    Lurgha was the local storm god, Ross recalled. The sound of thunder and  fire coming out of the sky at night--the bomb! Perhaps the very method  of attack on the post would defeat Ashe's attempt to learn anything from  these neighbors. The superstitions of the people would lead them to shun  both the site of the post and Ashe himself as cursed and taboo.    \"If the Wrath of Lurgha had struck at Assha, would Assha still live to  walk upon this road?\" Ashe prodded the ground with the tip of his  bowstave. \"Yet Assha walks, as you see him; Assha talks, as you hear  him. It is ridiculous to answer him with the nonsense of little  children----\"    \"Spirits so walk and talk to unlucky men,\" retorted the man in hiding.  \"It may be the spirit of Assha who does so now--\"    Ashe made a sudden leap. There was a flurry of action behind the bush  screen and he reappeared, dragging into the gray light of the rainy day  a wriggling captive, whom he bumped without ceremony onto the beaten  earth of the road.    The man was bearded, wearing his thick mop of black hair in a round  topknot secured by a hide loop. He wore a skin tunic, now in  considerable disarray, which was held in place with a woven, tasseled  belt.    \"Ho, so it is Lal of the Quick Tongue who speaks so loudly of spirits  and the Wrath of Lurgha!\" Ashe studied his captive. \"Now, Lal, since you  speak for Nodren--which I believe will greatly surprise him--you will  continue to tell me of this Wrath of Lurgha from the night skies and  what has happened to Sanfra, who was my brother, and those others of my  kin. I am Assha, and you know of the wrath of Assha and how it ate up  Twist-tooth, the outlaw, when he came in with his evil men. The Wrath of  Lurgha is hot, but so too is the wrath of Assha.\" Ashe contorted his  face in such a way that Lal squirmed and looked away. When the tribesman  spoke, all his former authority and bluster had gone.    \"Assha knows that I am as his dog. Let him not turn upon me his  swift-cutting big knife, nor the arrows from his lightning bow. It was  the Wrath of Lurgha which smote the place on the hill, first the thunder  of his fist meeting the earth, and then the fire which he breathed upon  those whom he would slay----\"    \"And this you saw with your own eyes, Lal?\"    The shaggy head shook an emphatic negative. \"Assha knows that Lal is no  chief who can stand and look upon the wonders of Lurgha's might and keep  his eyes in his head. Nodren himself saw this wonder----\"    \"And if Lurgha came in the night, when all men keep to their homes and  leave the outer world to the restless spirits, how did Nodren see his  coming?\"    Lal crouched lower to the ground, his eyes darting to the bushes and the  freedom they promised, then back to Ashe's firmly planted boots.    \"I am not a chief, Assha. How could I know in what way or for what  reason Nodren saw the coming of Lurgha----?\"    \"Fool!\" A second voice, that of a woman, spat the word from the brush  which fringed the roadway. \"Speak to Assha with a straight tongue. If he  is a spirit, he will know that you do not tell him the truth. And if he  has been spared by Lurgha....\" She showed her wonderment with a hiss of  indrawn breath.    So urged, Lal mumbled sullenly, \"It is said that there came a message  for one to witness the Wrath of Lurgha in its descent upon the  outlanders so that Nodren and the men of Nodren would truly know that  the traders were cursed, and should be put to the spear should they  come here again----\"    \"This message--how was it brought? Did the voice of Lurgha sound in  Nodren's ear alone, or came it by the tongue of some man?\"    \"Ahee!\" Lal lay flat on the ground, his hands over his ears.    \"Lal is a fool and fears his own shadow as it skips before him on a  sunny day!\" Out of the bushes stepped a young woman, obviously of some"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19164"],[0,"Lectures on Art, Delivered Before the University of Oxford in Hilary Term, 1870 (#10)"],[1," our senses produced by the architecture, that we receive the  first strong impressions of what we afterwards contend for as absolute  truth. I particularly wish you to notice how it is always by help of  human art that such a result is attained, because, remember always, I am  neither disputing nor asserting the truth of any theological  doctrine;--that is not my province;--I am only questioning the  expediency of enforcing that doctrine by the help of architecture. Put a  rough stone for an altar under the hawthorn on a village  green;--separate a portion of the green itself with an ordinary paling  from the rest;--then consecrate, with whatever form you choose, the  space of grass you have enclosed, and meet within the wooden fence as  often as you desire to pray or preach; yet you will not easily fasten an  impression in the minds of the villagers, that God inhabits the space of  grass inside the fence, and does not extend His presence to the common  beyond it: and that the daisies and violets on one side of the railing  are holy,--on the other, profane. But, instead of a wooden fence, build  a wall, pave the interior space; roof it over, so as to make it  comparatively dark;--and you may persuade the villagers with ease that  you have built a house which Deity inhabits, or that you have become, in  the old French phrase, a \"logeur du Bon Dieu.\"      61. And farther, though I have no desire to introduce any question as to  the truth of what we thus architecturally teach, I would desire you most  strictly to determine what is intended to be taught.    Do not think I underrate--I am among the last men living who would  underrate,--the importance of the sentiments connected with their church  to the population of a pastoral village. I admit, in its fullest extent,  the moral value of the scene, which is almost always one of perfect  purity and peace; and of the sense of supernatural love and protection,  which fills and surrounds the low aisles and homely porch. But the  question I desire earnestly to leave with you is, whether all the earth  ought not to be peaceful and pure, and the acknowledgment of the Divine  protection, as universal as its reality? That in a mysterious way the  presence of Deity is vouchsafed where it is sought, and withdrawn where  it is forgotten, must of course be granted as the first postulate in the  enquiry: but the point for our decision is just this, whether it ought  always to be sought in one place only, and forgotten in every other.    It may be replied, that since it is impossible to consecrate the entire  space of the earth, it is better thus to secure a portion of it than  none: but surely, if so, we ought to make some effort to enlarge the  favoured ground, and even look forward to a time when in English  villages there may be a God's acre tenanted by the living, not the  dead; and when we shall rather look with aversion and fear to the  remnant of ground that is set apart as profane, than with reverence to a  narrow portion of it enclosed as holy.      62. But now, farther. Suppose it be admitted that by enclosing ground  with walls, and performing certain ceremonies there habitually, some  kind of sanctity is indeed secured within that space,--still the  question remains open whether it be advisable for religious purposes to  decorate the enclosure. For separation the mere walls would be enough.  What is the purpose of your decoration?    Let us take an instance--the most noble with which I am acquainted, the  Cathedral of Chartres. You have there the most splendid coloured glass,  and the richest sculpture, and the grandest proportions of building,  united to produce a sensation of pleasure and awe. We profess that this  is to honour the Deity; or, in other words, that it is pleasing to Him  that we should delight our eyes with blue and golden colours, and  solemnise our spirits by the sight of large stones laid one on another,  and ingeniously carved.      63. I do not think it can be doubted that it _is_ pleasing to Him when  we do this; for He has Himself prepared for us, nearly every morning and  evening, windows painted with Divine art, in blue and gold and  vermilion: windows lighted from within by the lustre of that heaven  which we may assume, at least with more certainty than any consecrated  ground, to be one of His dwelling-places. Again, in every mountain side,  and cliff of rude sea shore, He has heaped stones one upon another of  greater magnitude than those of Chartres Cathedral, and sculptured them  with floral ornament,--surely not less sacred because living?      64. Must it not then be only because we love our own work better than  His, that we respect the lucent glass, but not the lucent clouds; that  we weave embroidered robes with ingenious fingers, and make bright the  gilded vaults we have beautifully ordained--while yet we have not  considered the heavens, the work of His fingers, nor the stars of the  strange vault which He has ordained? And do we dream that by carving  fonts and lifting pillars in His honour, who cuts the way of the rivers  among the rocks, and at whose reproof the pillars of the earth are  astonished, we shall obtain pardon for the dishonour done to the hills  and streams by which He has appointed our dwelling-place;--for the  infection of their sweet air with poison;--for the burning up of their  tender grass and flowers with fire, and for spreading such a shame of  mixed luxury and misery over our native land, as if we laboured only  that, at least here in England, we might be able to give the lie to the  song, whether of the Cherubim above, or Church beneath--\"Holy, holy,  Lord God of all creatures; Heaven--_and Earth_--are full of Thy glory\"?      65. And how much more there is that I long to say to you; and how much,  I hope, that you would like to answer to me, or to question me of! But I  can say no more to-day. We are not, I trust, at the end of our talks or  thoughts together; but, if it were so, and I never spoke to you more,  this that I have said to you I should have been glad to have been  permitted to say; and this, farther, which is the sum of it,--That we  may have splendour of art again, and with that, we may truly praise and  honour our Maker, and with that set forth the beauty and holiness of all  that He has made: but only after we have striven with our whole hearts  first to sanctify the temple of the body and spirit of every child that  has no roof to cover its head from the cold, and no walls to guard its  soul from corruption, in this our English land.    One word more.    What I have suggested hitherto, respecting the relations of Art to  Religion, you must receive throughout as merely motive of thought;  though you must have well seen that my own convictions were established  finally on some of the points in question. But I must, in conclusion,  tell you something that I _know_;--which, if you truly labour, you will  one day know also; and which I trust some of you will believe, now.    During the minutes in which you have been listening to me, I suppose  that almost at every other sentence those whose habit of mind has been  one of veneration for established forms and faiths, must have been in  dread that I was about to say, or in pang of regret at my having said,  what seemed to them an irreverent or reckless word touching vitally  important things.    So far from this being the fact, it is just because the feelings that I  most desire to cultivate in your minds are those of reverence and  admiration, that I am so earnest to prevent you from being moved to  either by trivial or false semblances. _This_ is the thing which I  KNOW--and which, if you labour faithfully, you shall know also,--that in  Reverence is the chief joy and power of life;--Reverence, for what is  pure and bright in your own youth; for what is true and tried in the age  of others; for all that is gracious among the living,--great among the  dead,--and marvellous, in the Powers that cannot die.          LECTURE III    THE RELATION OF ART TO MORALS      66. You probably recollect that, in the beginning of my last lecture, it  was stated that fine art had, and could have, but three functions: the  enforcing of the religious sentiments of men, the perfecting their  ethical state, and the doing them material service. We have to-day to  examine, the mode of its action in the second power--that of perfecting  the morality, or ethical state, of men.    Perfecting, observe--not producing.    You must have the right moral state first, or you cannot have the art.  But when the art is once obtained, its reflected action enhances and  completes the moral state out of which it arose, and, above all,  communicates the exultation to other minds which are already morally  capable of the like.      67. For instance, take the art of singing, and the simplest perfect  master of it (up to the limits of his nature) whom you can find;--a  skylark. From him you may learn what it is to \"sing for joy.\" You must  get the moral state first, the pure gladness, then give it finished  expression; and it is perfected in itself, and made communicable to  other creatures capable of such joy. But it is incommunicable to those  who are not prepared to receive it.    Now, all right human song is, similarly, the finished expression, by  art, of the joy or grief of noble persons, for right causes. And  accurately in proportion to the rightness of the cause, and purity of  the emotion, is the possibility of the fine art. A maiden may sing of  her lost love, but a miser cannot sing of his lost money. And with  absolute precision, from highest to lowest, _the fineness of the  possible art is an index of the moral purity and majesty of the emotion  it expresses_. You may test it practically at any instant. Question with  yourselves respecting any feeling that has taken strong possession of  your mind, \"Could this be sung by a master, and sung nobly, with a true  melody "]]]
