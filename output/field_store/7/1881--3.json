The worship of Amon had been the means of  introducing that of Ea and of Horus, and Osiris as lord of the dead,  while Phtah, Sokhit, Atumu, and the Memphite and Heliopolitan gods were  worshipped only in isolated parts of the province. A being, however,  of less exalted rank shared with the lords of heaven the favour of the  people. This was the Pharaoh, who as the son of Amon was foreordained to  receive divine honours, sometimes figuring, as at Bohani, as the third  member of a triad, at other times as head of the Ennead. Usirtasen  III. had had his chapels at Semneh and at Kummeh, they were restored by  Thutmosis III., who claimed a share of the worship offered in them,  and whose son, Amenothes II., also assumed the symbols and functions of  divinity.    [Illustration: 059.jpg ONE OF THE RAMS OF AMENOTHES III]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Mons. de Mertens.    Amenothes I. was venerated in the province of Kari, and Amenothes III.,  when founding the fortress Hait-Khammait* in the neighbourhood of a  Nubian village, on a spot now known as Soleb, built a temple there, of  which he himself was the protecting genius.**         * The name signifies literally \"the Citadel of Khammait,\"       and it is formed, as Lepsius recognised from the first, from       the name of the Sparrow-hawk Khammait, \"Mait rising as       Goddess,\" which Amenothes had assumed on his accession.         ** Lepsius recognised the nature of the divinity worshipped       in this temple; the deified statue of the king, \"his living       statue on earth,\" which represented the god of the temple,       is there named \"Nibmauri, lord of Nubia.\" Thutmosis III. had       already worked at Soleb.    The edifice was of considerable size, and the columns and walls  remaining reveal an art as perfect as that shown in the best monuments  at Thebes. It was approached by an avenue of ram-headed sphinxes, while  colossal statues of lions and hawks, the sacred animals of the district,  adorned the building. The sovereign condescended to preside in person  at its dedication on one of his journeys to the southern part of his  empire, and the mutilated pictures still visible on the facade show the  order and detail of the ceremony observed on this occasion. The king,  with the crown upon his head, stood before the centre gate, accompanied  by the queen and his minister Amenothes, the son of Hapi, who was better  acquainted than any other man of his time with the mysteries of the  ritual.*         * On Amenothes, the son of Hapi, see p. 56 of the present       volume; it will be seen in the following chapter, in       connection with the Egyptian accounts of the Exodus, what       tradition made of him.    The king then struck the door twelve times with his mace of white stone,  and when the approach to the first hall was opened, he repeated the  operation at the threshold of the sanctuary previous to entering and  placing his statue there. He deposited it on the painted and gilded  wooden platform on which the gods were exhibited on feast-days,  and enthroned beside it the other images which were thenceforth to  constitute the local Ennead, after which he kindled the sacred fire  before them. The queen, with the priests and nobles, all bearing  torches, then passed through the halls, stopping from time to time  to perform acts of purification, or to recite formulas to dispel evil  spirits and pernicious influences; finally, a triumphal procession was  formed, and the whole _cortege_ returned to the palace, where a banquet  brought the day's festivities to a close.* It was Amenothes III.  himself, or rather one of his statues animated by his double, who  occupied the chief place in the new building. Indeed, wherever we come  across a temple in Nubia dedicated to a king, we find the homage of the  inhabitants always offered to the image of the founder, which spoke to  them in oracles. All the southern part of the country beyond the  second cataract is full of traces of Amenothes, and the evidence of  the veneration shown to him would lead us to conclude that he played an  important part in the organisation of the country. Sedeinga possessed  a small temple under the patronage of his wife Tii. The ruins of a  sanctuary which he dedicated to Anion, the Sun-god, have been discovered  at Gebel-Barkal; Amenothes seems to have been the first to perceive the  advantages offered by the site, and to have endeavoured to transform  the barbarian village of Napata into a large Egyptian city. Some of the  monuments with which he adorned Soleb were transported, in later times,  to Gebel-Barkal, among them some rams and lions of rare beauty. They lie  at rest with their paws crossed, the head erect, and their expression  suggesting both power and repose.** As we descend the Nile, traces of  the work of this king are less frequent, and their place is taken by  those of his predecessors, as at Sai, at Semneh, at Wady Haifa, at  Amada, at Ibrim, and at Dakkeh. Distant traces of Amenothes again  appear in the neighbourhood of the first cataract, and in the island of  Elephantine, which he endeavoured to restore to its ancient splendour.         * Thus the small temple of Sarrah, to the north of Wady       Haifa, is dedicated to \"the living statue of Ramses II. in       the land of Nubia,\" a statue to which his Majesty gave the       name of \"Usirmari Zosir-Shafi.\"         ** One of the rams was removed from Gebel-Barkal by Lepsius,       and is now in the Berlin Museum, as well as the pedestal of       one of the hawks. Prisse has shown that these two monuments       originally adorned the temple of Soleb, and that they were       afterwards transported to Napata by an Ethiopian king, who       engraved his name on the pedestal of one of them.    [Illustration: 062.jpg ONE OF THE LIONS OF GEBEL-BARKAL]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from one of the two lions of Gebel-       Barkal in the British Museum    Two of the small buildings which he there dedicated to Khnumu, the local  god, were still in existence at the beginning of the present century.  That least damaged, on the south side of the island, consisted of  a single chamber nearly forty feet in length. The sandstone walls,  terminating in a curved cornice, rested on a hollow substructure  raised rather more than six feet above the ground, and surrounded by  a breast-high parapet. A portico ran round the building, having seven  square pillars on each of its two sides, while at each end stood two  columns having lotus-shaped capitals; a flight of ten or twelve steps  between two walls of the same height as the basement, projected in  front, and afforded access to the cella. The two columns of the facade  were further apart than those at the opposite end of the building, and  showed a glimpse of a richly decorated door, while a second door opened  under the peristyle at the further extremity. The walls were covered  with the half-brutish profile of the good Khnumu, and those of his  two companions, Anukit and Satit, the spirits of stormy waters. The  treatment of these figures was broad and simple, the style free, light,  and graceful, the colouring soft; and the harmonious beauty of the whole  is unsurpassed by anything at Thebes itself. It was, in fact, a kind of  oratory, built on a scale to suit the capacities of a decaying town, but  the design was so delicately conceived in its miniature proportions that  nothing more graceful can be imagined.*         * Amenothes II. erected some small obelisks at Elephantine,       one of which is at present in England. The two buildings of       Amenothes III. at Elephantine were still in existence at the       beginning of the present century. They have been described       and drawn by French scholars; between 1822 and 1825 they       were destroyed, and the materials used for building barracks       and magazines at Syene.    Ancient Egypt and its feudal cities, Ombos, Edfu,* Nekhabit, Esneh,**  Medamot,*** Coptos,**** Denderah, Abydos, Memphis,^ and Heliopolis,  profited largely by the generosity of the Pharaohs.         * The works undertaken by Thutmosis III. in the temple of       Edfu are mentioned in an inscription of the Ptolemaic       period; some portions are still to be seen among the ruins       of the town.         ** An inscription of the Roman period attributes the       rebuilding of the great temple of Esneh to Thutmosis III.       Grebaut discovered some fragments of it in the quay of the       modern town.         *** Amenothes II. appears to have built the existing temple.         **** The temple of Hathor was built by Thutmosis III. Some       fragments found in the Ptolemaic masonry bear the cartouche       of Thutmosis IV.         ^ Amenothes II. certainly carried on works at Memphis, for       he opened a new quarry at Turah, in the year IV. Amenothes       III. also worked limestone quarries, and built at Saqqarah       the earliest chapels of the Serapeum which are at present       known to us.    Since the close of the XIIth dynasty these cities had depended entirely  on their own resources, and their public buildings were either in ruins,  or quite inadequate to the needs of the population, but now gold from  Syria and Kush furnished them with the means of restoration. The Delta  itself shared in this architectural revival, but it had suffered too  severely under the struggle between the Theban kings and the Shepherds  to recover itself as quickly as the remainder of the country. All  effort was concentrated on those of its nomes which lay on the Eastern  frontier, or which were "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17326"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chald√¶a, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 6 (of 12) (#10)"],[1,"of their excavations so as to avoid piercing a neighbouring  tomb. The architect's design was usually a mere project which could be  modified at will, and, which he did not feel bound to carry out with  fidelity; the actual measurements of the tomb of Ramses IV. are almost  everywhere at variance with the numbers and arrangement of the working  drawing of it which has been preserved to us in a papyrus. The general  disposition of the royal tombs, however, is far from being complicated;  we have at the entrance the rectangular door, usually surmounted by the  sun, represented by a yellow disk, before which the sovereign kneels  with his hands raised in the posture of adoration; this gave access to  a passage sloping gently downwards, and broken here and there by a level  landing and steps, leading to a first chamber of varying amplitude, at  the further end of which a second passage opened which descended to one  or more apartments, the last of which, contained the coffin. The oldest  rock-tombs present some noteworthy exceptions to this plan, particularly  those of Seti I. and Ramses III.; but from the time of Ramses IV., there  is no difference to be remarked in them except in the degree of finish  of the wall-paintings or in the length of the passages. The shortest of  the latter extends some fifty-two feet into the rock, while the longest  never exceeds three hundred and ninety feet. The same artifices  which had been used by the pyramid-builders to defeat the designs of  robbers--false mummy-pits, painted and sculptured walls built across  passages, stairs concealed under a movable stone in the corner of a  chamber--were also employed by the Theban engineers. The decoration of  the walls was suggested, as in earlier times, by the needs of the royal  soul, with this difference--that the Thebans set themselves to render  visible to his eyes by paintings that which the Memphites had been  content to present to his intelligence in writing, so that the Pharaoh  could now see what his ancestors had been able merely to read on the  walls of their tombs. Where the inscribed texts in the burial-chamber  of Unas state that Unas, incarnate in the Sun, and thus representing  Osiris, sails over the waters on high or glides into the Elysian fields,  the sculptured or painted scenes in the interior of the Theban catacombs  display to the eye Ramses occupying the place of the god in the solar  bark and in the fields of laid. Where the walls of Unas bear only the  prayers recited over the mummy for the opening of his mouth, for the  restoration of the use of his limbs, for his clothing, perfuming, and  nourishment, we see depicted on those of Seti I. or Ramses IV. the  mummies of these kings and the statues of their doubles in the hands  of the priests, who are portrayed in the performance of these various  offices. The starry ceilings of the pyramids reproduce the aspect of the  sky, but without giving the names of the stars: on the ceilings of some  of the Ramesside rock-tombs, on the other hand, the constellations are  represented, each with its proper figure, while astronomical tables give  the position of the heavenly bodies at intervals of fifteen days, so  that the soul could tell at a glance into what region of the firmament  the course of the bark would bring him each night. In the earlier  Ramesside tombs, under Seti I. and Ramses II., the execution of these  subjects shows evidence of a care and skill which are quite marvellous,  and both figures and hieroglyphics betray the hand of accomplished  artists. But in the tomb of Ramses III. the work has already begun to  show signs of inferiority, and the majority of the scenes are coloured  in a very summary fashion; a raw yellow predominates, and the tones of  the reds and blues remind us of a child's first efforts at painting.  This decline is even more marked under the succeeding Ramessides; the  drawing has deteriorated, the tints have become more and more crude,  and the latest paintings seem but a lamentable caricature of the earlier  ones.    The courtiers and all those connected with the worship of  Amon-Ra--priests, prophets, singers, and functionaries connected with  the necropolis--shared the same belief with regard to the future world  as their sovereign, and they carried their faith in the sun's power  to the point of identifying themselves with him after death, and of  substituting the name of Ra for that of Osiris; they either did not  venture, however, to go further than this, or were unable to introduce  into their tombs all that we find in the Bab el-Moluk. They confined  themselves to writing briefly on their own coffins, or confiding to  the mummies of their fellow-believers, in addition to the \"Book of the  Dead,\" a copy of the \"Book of knowing what there is in Hades,\" or of  some other mystic writing which was in harmony with their creed. Hastily  prepared copies of these were sold by unscrupulous scribes, often badly  written and almost always incomplete, in which were hurriedly set  down haphazard the episodes of the course of the sun with explanatory  illustrations. The representations of the gods in them are but little  better than caricatures, the text is full of faults and scarcely  decipherable, and it is at times difficult to recognize the  correspondence of the scenes and prayers with those in the royal tombs.  Although Amon had become the supreme god, at least for this class of  the initiated, he was by no means the sole deity worshipped by the  Egyptians: the other divinities previously associated with him still  held their own beside him, or were further defined and invested with  a more decided personality. The goddess regarded as his partner was at  first represented as childless, in spite of the name of Maut or Mut--the  mother--by which she was invoked, and Amon was supposed to have adopted  Montu, the god of Hermonthis, in order to complete his triad. Montu,  however, formerly the sovereign of the Theban plain, and lord over Amon  himself, was of too exalted a rank to play the inferior part of a divine  son.    [Illustration: 074.jpg KHONSU* AND TEMPLE OF KHONSU**.]         * Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a bronze statuette in the       Gizeh Museum.         ** Drawn by Thuillier: A is the pylon, B the court, C the       hypostyle hall, E the passage isolating the sanctuary, D the       sanctuary, F the opisthodomos with its usual chambers.    The priests were, therefore, obliged to fall back upon a personage  of lesser importance, named Khonsu, who up to that period had been  relegated to an obscure position in the celestial hierarchy. How they  came to identify him with the moon, and subsequently with Osiris and  Thot, is as yet unexplained,* but the assimilation had taken place  before the XIXth dynasty drew to its close. Khonsu, thus honoured, soon  became a favourite deity with both the people and the upper classes,  at first merely supplementing Montu, but finally supplanting him in the  third place of the Triad. From the time of Sesostris onwards, Theban  dogma acknowledged him alone side by side with Amon-Ra and Mut the  divine mother.         * It is possible that this assimilation originated in the       fact that Khonsu is derived from the verb \"khonsu,\" to       navigate: Khonsu would thus have been he who crossed the       heavens in his bark--that is, the moon-god.    [Illustration: 075.jpg THE TEMPLE OF KHONSU AT KARNAK]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Beato.    It was now incumbent on the Pharaoh to erect to this newly made  favourite a temple whose size and magnificence should be worthy of the  rank to which his votaries had exalted him. To this end, Ramses III.  chose a suitable site to the south of the hypostyle hall of Karnak,  close to a corner of the enclosing wall, and there laid the foundations  of a temple which his successors took nearly a century to finish.*         * The proof that the temple was founded by Ramses III. is       furnished by the inscriptions of the sanctuary and the       surrounding chambers.    Its proportions are by no means perfect, the sculpture is wanting in  refinement, the painting is coarse, and the masonry was so faulty, that  it was found necessary in several places to cover it with a coat of  stucco before the bas-reliefs could be carved on the walls; yet, in  spite of all this, its general arrangement is so fine, that it may  well be regarded, in preference to other more graceful or magnificent  buildings, as the typical temple of the Theban period. It is divided  into two parts, separated from each other by a solid wall. In the centre  of the smaller of these is placed the Holy of Holies, which opens  at both ends into a passage ten feet in width, isolating it from the  surrounding buildings. To the right and left of the sanctuary are dark  chambers, and behind it is a hall supported by four columns, into which  open seven small apartments. This formed the dwelling-place of the god  and his compeers. The sanctuary communicates, by means of two doors  placed in the southern wall, with a hypostyle hall of greater width  than depth, divided by its pillars into a nave and two aisles. The  four columns of the nave are twenty-three feet in height, and have  bell-shaped capitals, while those of the aisles, two on either side, are  eighteen feet high, and are crowned with lotiform capitals.    [Illustration: 077.jpg THE COURT OF THE TEMPLE OF KHONSU]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Beato.    The roof of the nave was thus five feet higher than those of the aisles,  and in the clear storey thus formed, stone gratings, similar to those  in the temple of Amon, admitted light to the building. The courtyard,  surrounded by a fine colonnade of two rows of columns, was square, and  was entered by four side posterns in addition to the open gateway at the  end placed between two quadrangular towers.
