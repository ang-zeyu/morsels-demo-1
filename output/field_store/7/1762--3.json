Contrectation signifies a desire to touch the skin.          II    THE INFANTILE SEXUALITY      It is a part of popular belief about the sexual impulse that it is  absent in childhood and that it first appears in the period of life  known as puberty. This, though a common error, is serious in its  consequences and is chiefly due to our present ignorance of the  fundamental principles of the sexual life. A comprehensive study of the  sexual manifestations of childhood would probably reveal to us the  existence of the essential features of the sexual impulse, and would  make us acquainted with its development and its composition from various  sources.    *The Neglect of the Infantile.*--It is remarkable that those writers who  endeavor to explain the qualities and reactions of the adult individual  have given so much more attention to the ancestral period than to the  period of the individual's own existence--that is, they have attributed  more influence to heredity than to childhood. As a matter of fact, it  might well be supposed that the influence of the latter period would be  easier to understand, and that it would be entitled to more  consideration than heredity.[1] To be sure, one occasionally finds in  medical literature notes on the premature sexual activities of small  children, about erections and masturbation and even actions resembling  coitus, but these are referred to merely as exceptional occurrences, as  curiosities, or as deterring examples of premature perversity. No author  has to my knowledge recognized the normality of the sexual impulse in  childhood, and in the numerous writings on the development of the child  the chapter on \"Sexual Development\" is usually passed over.[2]    *Infantile Amnesia.*--This remarkable negligence is due partly to  conventional considerations, which influence the writers on account of  their own bringing up, and partly to a psychic phenomenon which has thus  far remained unexplained. I refer to the peculiar amnesia which veils  from most people (not from all!) the first years of their childhood,  usually the first six or eight years. So far it has not occurred to us  that this amnesia ought to surprise us, though we have good reasons for  surprise. For we are informed that in those years from which we later  obtain nothing except a few incomprehensible memory fragments, we have  vividly reacted to impressions, that we have manifested pain and  pleasure like any human being, that we have evinced love, jealousy, and  other passions as they then affected us; indeed we are told that we have  uttered remarks which proved to grown-ups that we possessed  understanding and a budding power of judgment. Still we know nothing of  all this when we become older. Why does our memory lag behind all our  other psychic activities? We really have reason to believe that at no  time of life are we more capable of impressions and reproductions than  during the years of childhood.[3]    On the other hand we must assume, or we may convince ourselves through  psychological observations on others, that the very impressions which we  have forgotten have nevertheless left the deepest traces in our psychic  life, and acted as determinants for our whole future development. We  conclude therefore that we do not deal with a real forgetting of  infantile impressions but rather with an amnesia similar to that  observed in neurotics for later experiences, the nature of which  consists in their being detained from consciousness (repression). But  what forces bring about this repression of the infantile impressions? He  who can solve this riddle will also explain hysterical amnesia.    We shall not, however, hesitate to assert that the existence of the  infantile amnesia gives us a new point of comparison between the psychic  states of the child and those of the psychoneurotic. We have already  encountered another point of comparison when confronted by the fact that  the sexuality of the psychoneurotic preserves the infantile character or  has returned to it. May there not be an ultimate connection between the  infantile and the hysterical amnesias?    The connection between the infantile and the hysterical amnesias is  really more than a mere play of wit. The hysterical amnesia which serves  the repression can only be explained by the fact that the individual  already possesses a sum of recollections which have been withdrawn from  conscious disposal and which by associative connection now seize that  which is acted upon by the repelling forces of the repression emanating  from consciousness.[4] We may say that without infantile amnesia there  would be no hysterical amnesia.    I believe that the infantile amnesia which causes the individual to look  upon his childhood as if it were a _prehistoric_ time and conceals from  him the beginning of his own sexual life--that this amnesia is  responsible for the fact that one does not usually attribute any value  to the infantile period in the development of the sexual life. One  single observer cannot fill the gap which has been thus produced in our  knowledge. As early as 1896 I had already emphasized the significance of  childhood for the origin of certain important phenomena connected with  the sexual life, and since then I have not ceased to put into the  foreground the importance of the infantile factor for sexuality.      THE SEXUAL LATENCY PERIOD OF CHILDHOOD AND ITS INTERRUPTIONS    The extraordinary frequent discoveries of apparently abnormal and  exceptional sexual manifestations in childhood, as well as the  discovery of infantile reminiscences in neurotics, which were hitherto  unconscious, allow us to sketch the following picture of the sexual  behavior of childhood.[5]    It seems certain that the newborn child brings with it the germs of  sexual feelings which continue to develop for some time and then succumb  to a progressive suppression, which is in turn broken through by the  proper advances of the sexual development and which can be checked by  individual idiosyncrasies. Nothing is known concerning the laws and  periodicity of this oscillating course of development. It seems,  however, that the sexual life of the child mostly manifests itself in  the third or fourth year in some form accessible to observation.[6]    *The Sexual Inhibition.*--It is during this period of total or at least  partial latency that the psychic forces develop which later act as  inhibitions on the sexual life, and narrow its direction like dams.  These psychic forces are loathing, shame, and moral and esthetic ideal  demands. We may gain the impression that the erection of these dams in  the civilized child is the work of education; and surely education  contributes much to it. In reality, however, this development is  organically determined and can occasionally be produced without the help  of education. Indeed education remains properly within its assigned  realm only if it strictly follows the path of the organic determinant  and impresses it somewhat cleaner and deeper.    *Reaction Formation and Sublimation.*--What are the means that  accomplish these very important constructions so significant for the  later personal culture and normality? They are probably brought about at  the cost of the infantile sexuality itself, the influx of which has not  stopped even in this latency period--the energy of which indeed has been  turned away either wholly or partially from sexual utilization and  conducted to other aims. The historians of civilization seem to be  unanimous in the opinion that such deviation of sexual motive powers  from sexual aims to new aims, a process which merits the name of  _sublimation_, has furnished powerful components for all cultural  accomplishments. We will therefore add that the same process acts in the  development of every individual, and that it begins to act in the sexual  latency period.[7]    We can also venture an opinion about the mechanisms of such sublimation.  The sexual feelings of these infantile years on the one hand could not  be utilizable, since the procreating functions are postponed,--this is  the chief character of the latency period; on the other hand, they would  in themselves be perverse, as they would emanate from erogenous zones  and would be born of impulses which in the individual's course of  development could only evoke a feeling of displeasure. They therefore  awaken contrary forces (feelings of reaction), which in order to  suppress such displeasure, build up the above mentioned psychic dams:  loathing, shame, and morality.[8]    *The Interruptions of the Latency Period.*--Without deluding ourselves  as to the hypothetical nature and deficient clearness of our  understanding regarding the infantile period of latency and delay, we  will return to reality and state that such a utilization of the  infantile sexuality represents an ideal bringing up from which the  development of the individual usually deviates in some measure and often  very considerably. A portion of the sexual manifestation which has  withdrawn from sublimation occasionally breaks through, or a sexual  activity remains throughout the whole duration of the latency period  until the reinforced breaking through of the sexual impulse in puberty.  In so far as they have paid any attention to infantile sexuality the  educators behave as if they shared our views concerning the formation of  the moral forces of defence at the cost of sexuality, and as if they  knew that sexual activity makes the child uneducable; for the educators  consider all sexual manifestations of the child as an \"evil\" in the face  of which little can be accomplished. We have, however, every reason for  directing our attention to those phenomena so much feared by the  educators, for we expect to find in them the solution of the primitive  formation of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14970"],[0,"Academica (#10)"],[1,"superficial[260]. We  are thus relieved from the necessity of forcing the meaning of the word  _commoveris_[261], from which Krische infers that the dialogue, entitled  _Hortensius_, had ended in a conversion to philosophy of the orator from  whom it was named. To any such conversion we have nowhere else any  allusion.    The relation in which Hortensius stood to Cicero, also his character and  attainments, are too well known to need mention here. He seems to have been  as nearly innocent of any acquaintance with philosophy as it was possible  for an educated man to be. Cicero's materials for the speech of Hortensius  were, doubtless, drawn from the published works and oral teaching of  Antiochus.    The speech of Hortensius was answered by Cicero himself. If my view of the  preceding speech is correct, it follows that Cicero in his reply pursued  the same course which he takes in his answer to Varro, part of which is  preserved in the _Academica Posteriora_[262]. He justified the New Academy  by showing that it was in essential harmony with the Old, and also with  those ancient philosophers who preceded Plato. Lucullus, therefore,  reproves him as a rebel in philosophy, who appeals to great and ancient  names like a seditious tribune[263]. Unfair use had been made, according to  Lucullus, of Empedocles, Anaxagoras, Democritus, Parmenides, Xenophanes,  Plato, and Socrates[264]. But Cicero did not merely give a historical  summary. He must have dealt with the theory of [Greek: kataleptike  phantasia] and [Greek: ennoiai] (which though really Stoic had been adopted  by Antiochus), since he found it necessary to \"manufacture\" (_fabricari_)  Latin terms to represent the Greek[265]. He probably also commented on the  headlong rashness with which the dogmatists gave their assent to the truth  of phenomena. To this a retort is made by Lucullus[266]. That Cicero's  criticism of the dogmatic schools was incomplete may be seen by the fact  that he had not had occasion to Latinize the terms [Greek: katalepsis]  (i.e. in the abstract, as opposed to the individual [Greek: kataleptike  phantasia]), [Greek: enargeia, horme, apodeixis, dogma, oikeion, adela,  epoche], nearly all important terms in the Stoic, and to some extent in the  Antiochean system, all of which Lucullus is obliged to translate for  himself[267]. The more the matter is examined the more clearly does it  appear that the main purpose of Cicero in this speech was to justify from  the history of philosophy the position of the New Academy, and not to  advance sceptical arguments against experience, which were reserved for his  answer to Lucullus. In his later speech, he expressly tells us that such  sceptical paradoxes as were advanced by him in the first day's discourse  were really out of place, and were merely introduced in order to disarm  Lucullus, who was to speak next[268]. Yet these arguments must have  occupied some considerable space in Cicero's speech, although foreign to  its main intention[269]. He probably gave a summary classification of the  sensations, with the reasons for refusing to assent to the truth of each  class[270]. The whole constitution and tenor of the elaborate speech of  Cicero in the _Lucullus_ proves that no general or minute demonstration of  the impossibility of [Greek: episteme] in the dogmatic sense had been  attempted in his statement of the day before. Cicero's argument in the  _Catulus_ was allowed by Lucullus to have considerably damaged the cause of  Antiochus[271]. The three speeches of Catulus, Hortensius, and Cicero had  gone over nearly the whole ground marked out for the discussion[272], but  only cursorily, so that there was plenty of room for a more minute  examination in the _Lucullus_.    One question remains: how far did Cicero defend Philo against the attack of  Catulus? Krische believes that the argument of Catulus was answered point  by point. In this opinion I cannot concur. Cicero never appears elsewhere  as the defender of Philo's reactionary doctrines[273]. The expressions of  Lucullus seem to imply that this part of his teaching had been dismissed by  all the disputants[274]. It follows that when Cicero, in his letter of  dedication to Varro, describes his own part as that of Philo (_partes mihi  sumpsi Philonis_[275]), he merely attaches Philo's name to those general  New Academic doctrines which had been so brilliantly supported by the pupil  of Clitomachus in his earlier days. The two chief sources for Cicero's  speech in the _Catulus_ were, doubtless, Philo himself and Clitomachus.    In that intermediate form of the _Academica_, where Cato and Brutus  appeared in the place of Hortensius and Lucullus, there can be no doubt  that Brutus occupied a more prominent position than Cato. Consequently Cato  must have taken the comparatively inferior part of Hortensius, while Brutus  took that of Lucullus. It may perhaps seem strange that a Stoic of the  Stoics like Cato should be chosen to represent Antiochus, however much that  philosopher may have borrowed from Zeno. The role given to Hortensius,  however, was in my view such as any cultivated man might sustain who had  not definitely committed himself to sceptical principles. So eminent an  Antiochean as Brutus cannot have been reduced to the comparatively  secondary position assigned to Hortensius in the _Academica Priora_. He  would naturally occupy the place given to Varro in the second edition[276].  If this be true, Brutus would not speak at length in the first half of the  work. Cato is not closely enough connected with the _Academica_ to render  it necessary to treat of him farther.    b. _The \"Lucullus.\"_    The day after the discussion narrated in the _Catulus_, during which  Lucullus had been merely a looker-on, the whole party left the Cuman villa  of Catulus early in the morning, and came to that of Hortensius at  Bauli[277]. In the evening, if the wind favoured, Lucullus was to leave for  his villa at Neapolis, Cicero for his at Pompeii[278]. Bauli was a little  place on the gulf of Baiae, close to Cimmerium, round which so many legends  lingered[279]. The scenery in view was magnificent[280]. As the party were  seated in the xystus with its polished floor and lines of statues, the  waves rippled at their feet, and the sea away to the horizon glistened and  quivered under the bright sun, and changed colour under the freshening  breeze. Within sight lay the Cuman shore and Puteoli, thirty stadia  distant[281].    Cicero strove to give vividness to the dialogue and to keep it perfectly  free from anachronisms. Diodotus is spoken of as still living, although  when the words were written he had been dead for many years[282]. The  surprise of Hortensius, who is but a learner in philosophy, at the wisdom  of Lucullus, is very dramatic[283]. The many political and private troubles  which were pressing upon Cicero when he wrote the work are kept carefully  out of sight. Still we can catch here and there traces of thoughts and  plans which were actively employing the author's mind at Astura. His  intention to visit Tusculum has left its mark on the last section of the  book, while in the last but one the _De Finibus_, the _De Natura Deorum_  and other works are shadowed forth[284]. In another passage the design of  the _Tusculan Disputations_, which was carried out immediately after the  publication of the _Academica_ and _De Finibus_, is clearly to be  seen[285].    Hortensius and Catulus now sink to a secondary position in the  conversation, which is resumed by Lucullus. His speech is especially  acknowledged by Cicero to be drawn from the works of Antiochus[286]. Nearly  all that is known of the learning of Lucullus is told in Cicero's dialogue,  and the passages already quoted from the letters. He seems at least to have  dallied with culture, although his chief energy, as a private citizen, was  directed to the care of his fish-ponds[287]. In his train when he went to  Sicily was the poet Archias, and during the whole of his residence in the  East he sought to attach learned men to his person. At Alexandria he was  found in the company of Antiochus, Aristus, Heraclitus Tyrius, Tetrilius  Rogus and the Selii, all men of philosophic tastes[288]. He is several  times mentioned by Pliny in the _Natural History_ as the patron of Greek  artists. Yet, as we have already seen, Cicero acknowledged in his letters  to Atticus that Lucullus was no philosopher. He has to be propped up, like  Catulus, by the authority of another person. All his arguments are  explicitly stated to be derived from a discussion in which he had heard  Antiochus engage. The speech of Lucullus was, as I have said, mainly a  reply to that of Cicero in the _Catulus_. Any closer examination of its  contents must be postponed till I come to annotate its actual text. The  same may be said of Cicero's answer.    In the intermediate form of the _Academica_, the speech of Lucullus was no  doubt transferred to Brutus, but as he has only such a slight connection  with the work, I do not think it necessary to do much more than call  attention to the fact. I may, however, notice the close relationship in  which Brutus stood to the other persons with whom we have had to deal. He  was nephew of Cato, whose half-sister Servilia was wife of Lucullus[289].  Cato was tutor to Lucullus' son, with Cicero for a sort of adviser: while  Hortensius had married a divorced wife of Cato. All of them were of the  Senatorial party, and Cato and Brutus lived to be present, with Cicero,  during the war between Pompey and Caesar. Brutus and Cicero were both  friends of Antiochus and Aristus, whose pupil Brutus was[290].    c. _The Second Edition._    When Cicero dedicated the _Academica_ to Varro, very slight alterations  were necessary in the scenery and other accessories of the piece. Cicero  had a villa close to the Cuman villa of Catulus and almost within sight of  Hortensius' villa at Bauli[291]. Varro's"]]]
