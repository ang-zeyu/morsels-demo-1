Since the need of organs for blood varies  with their activity, the muscular coat serves in this way a very necessary  purpose.                                    [Fig. 21]      Fig. 21--Diagram of network of capillaries between a very small artery and   a very small vein. Shading indicates the change of color of the blood as      it passes through the capillaries. _S._ Places between capillaries                            occupied by the cells.      *Capillaries.*--The capillaries consist of a network of minute blood  vessels which connect the terminations of the smallest arteries with the  beginnings of the smallest veins (Fig. 21). They have an average diameter  of less than one two-thousandth of an inch (12  mu) and an average length of  less than one twenty-fifth of an inch (1 millimeter). Their walls consist  of a single coat which is continuous with the lining of the arteries and  veins. This coat is formed of a single layer of thin, flat cells placed  edge to edge (Fig. 22). With a few exceptions, the capillaries are found  in great abundance in all parts of the body.                                    [Fig. 22]      Fig. 22--*Surface of capillary* highly magnified, showing its coat of thin                          cells placed edge to edge.      *Functions of the Capillaries.*--On account of the thinness of their walls,  the capillaries are able to serve a twofold purpose in the body:    1. They admit materials into the blood vessels.    2. They allow materials to pass from the blood vessels to the surrounding  tissues.    When it is remembered that the blood, as blood, does not escape from the  blood vessels under normal conditions, the importance of the work of the  capillaries is apparent. To serve its purpose as a carrier, there must be  places where the blood can load up with the materials which it is to  carry, and places also where these can be unloaded. Such places are  supplied by the capillaries.    The capillaries also serve the purpose of spreading the blood out and of  bringing it very near the individual cells in all parts of the body (Fig.  21).    *Functions of Arteries and Veins.*--While the capillaries provide the means  whereby materials may both enter and leave the blood, the arteries and  veins serve the general purpose of passing the blood from one set of  capillaries to another. Since pressure is necessary for moving the blood,  these tubes must connect with the source of the pressure, which is the  heart. In the arteries and veins the blood neither receives nor gives up  material, but having received or given up material at one set of  capillaries, it is then pushed through these tubes to where it can serve a  similar purpose in another set of capillaries (Fig. 23).    *Divisions of the Circulation.*--Man, in common with all warm-blooded  animals, has a double circulation, a fact which explains the double  structure of his heart. The two divisions are known as the _pulmonary_ and  the _systemic_ circulations. By the former the blood passes from the right  ventricle through the lungs, and is then returned to the left auricle; by  the latter it passes from the left ventricle through all parts of the  body, returning to the right auricle.    The general plan of the circulation is indicated in Fig. 23. All the blood  flows continuously through both circulations and passes the various parts  in the following order: right auricle, tricuspid valve, right ventricle,  right semilunar valve, pulmonary artery and its branches, capillaries of  the lungs, pulmonary veins, left auricle, mitral valve, left ventricle,  left semilunar valve, aorta and its branches, systemic capillaries, the  smaller veins, superior and inferior venae cavae, and then again into the  right auricle.    In the pulmonary capillaries the blood gives up carbon dioxide and  receives oxygen, changing from a dark red to a bright red color. In the  systemic capillaries it gives up oxygen, receives carbon dioxide and other  impurities, and changes back to a dark red color.    In addition to the two main divisions of the circulation, special circuits  are found in various places. Such a circuit in the liver is called the  _portal_ circulation, and another in the kidneys is termed the _renal_  circulation. To some extent the blood supply to the walls of the heart is  also outside of the general movement; it is called the _coronary_  circulation.                                    [Fig. 23]        Fig. 23--*General scheme of the circulation*, showing places where the   blood takes on and gives off materials. 1. Body in general. 2. Lungs. 3.   Kidneys. 4. Liver. 5. Organs of digestion. 6. Lymph ducts. 7. Pulmonary                              artery. 8. Aorta.      *Blood Pressure and Velocity.*--The blood, in obedience to physical laws,  passes continuously through the blood vessels, moving always from a place  of greater to one of less pressure. Through the contraction of the  ventricles, a relatively high pressure is maintained in the arteries  nearest the heart.(21) This pressure diminishes rapidly in the small  arteries, becomes comparatively slight in the capillaries, and falls  practically to nothing in the veins. Near the heart in the superior and  inferior venae cavae, the pressure at intervals is said to be _negative_.  This means that the blood from these veins is actually drawn into the  right auricle by the expansion of the chest walls in breathing.(22)    The velocity of the blood is greatest in the arteries, less in the veins,  and _much_ less in the capillaries than in either the arteries or the  veins. The slower flow of the blood through the capillaries is accounted  for by the fact that their united area is many times greater than that of  the arteries which supply, or the veins which relieve, them. This allows  the same quantity of blood, flowing through them in a given time, a wider  channel and causes it to move more slowly. The time required for a  complete circulation is less than one minute.    *Summary of Causes of Circulation.*--The chief factor in the circulation of  the blood is, of course, the heart. The ventricles keep a pressure on the  blood which is sufficient to force it through all the blood tubes and back  to the auricles. The heart is aided in its work by the elasticity of the  arteries, which keeps the blood under pressure while the ventricles are in  a state of relaxation. It is also aided by the muscles and elastic tissue  in all of the blood vessels. These, by keeping the blood vessels in a  state of \"tone,\" or so contracted that their capacity just equals the  volume of the blood, enable pressure from the heart to be transmitted to  all parts of the blood stream. A further aid to the circulation is found  in the valves in the veins, which enable muscular contraction within the  body, and variable pressure upon its surface, to drive the blood toward  the heart. The heart is also aided to some extent by the movements of the  chest walls in breathing. The organs Of circulation are under the control  of the nervous system (Chapter XVIII).        HYGIENE OF THE CIRCULATION      *Care of the Heart.*--The heart, consisting largely of muscle, is subject  to the laws of muscular exercise. It may be injured by over-exertion, but  is strengthened by a moderate increase in its usual work.(23) It may even  be subjected to great exertion without danger, if it be trained by  gradually increasing its work. Such training, by giving the heart time to  gain in size and strength, prepares it for tasks that could not at first  be accomplished.    In taking up a new exercise requiring considerable exertion, precautions  should be observed to prevent an overstrain of the heart. The heart of the  amateur athlete, bicyclist, or mountain climber is frequently injured by  attempting more than the previous training warrants. The new work should  be taken up gradually, and feats requiring a large outlay of physical  energy should be attempted only after long periods of training.    Since the heart is controlled by the nervous system, it frequently becomes  irregular in its action through conditions that exhaust the nervous  energy. Palpitations of the heart, the missing of beats, and pains in the  heart region frequently arise from this cause. It is through their effect  upon the nervous system that worry, overstudy, undue excitement, and  dissipation cause disturbances of the heart. In all such cases the remedy  lies in the removal of the cause. The nervous system should also be \"toned  up\" through rest, plenty of sleep, and moderate exercise in the open air.    *Effect of Drugs.*--A number of substances classed as drugs, mainly by  their action on the nervous system, produce undesirable effects upon the  organs of circulation. Unfortunately some of these are extensively used,  alcohol being one of them. If taken in any but small quantities, alcohol  is a disturbing factor in the circulation. It increases the rate of the  heart beat and dilates the capillaries. Its effect upon the capillaries is  shown by the \"bloodshot\" eye and the \"red nose\" of the hard drinker.  Another bad effect from the use of much alcohol is the weakening of the  heart through the accumulation of fat around this organ and within the  heart muscle. The use of alcohol also leads in many cases to a hardening  of the walls of the arteries, such as occurs in old age. This effect makes  the use of alcohol especially dangerous for those in advanced years.    Tobacco contains a drug, called nicotine, which has a bad effect upon the  heart in at least two ways: 1. When the use of tobacco is begun in early  life, it interferes with the growth of the heart, leading to its weakness  in the adult. 2. When used in considerable quantity, by young or old, it  causes a nervous condition both distressing and dangerous, known as  \"tobacco heart.\"  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18790"],[0,"The Insect Folk (#10)"],[1," glued fast so it will not fall off.    It hatches into a little dot of a katydid that has no wings, but, like  the larvae of the other insects we know about, it eats and grows and  moults, and at last its wings and the rest of its body are full grown.    It casts its skin for the last time; it is no longer a larva, but a  full-grown insect.    Yes, May, we call the young of all insects larvae.    [Illustration]    See this dainty katydid that Charlie has caught for us.    How pretty it is!    Its feelers are like long green threads.    And how sensitive they are!    It quickly starts away when we touch one of the feelers.    Yes, Mollie, the katydid walks more than the grasshopper.    It can jump well with those long, slender hind legs. How beautiful its  hind legs are! They are longer and more delicate than those of the  grasshopper.    And its wings, how gauzy and dainty! Its wing covers are not so stiff as  those of the grasshopper. They look almost like flying wings, they are  so delicate.    See, they open, and fasten themselves open, like the wing covers of the  grasshopper; and when they are at rest they overlap like the wings of  the grasshopper.    The inner wings are like fine lace.    They look too delicate for use, and yet the katydid flies very well  indeed with them.    They are a little longer than the wing covers.    [Illustration]    When the katydid is at rest you can see the tips of the wings extending  beyond the ends of the wing covers.    The part of the inner wing that extends beyond the wing covers is green,  like the wing covers, you see.    But the rest of the inner wing is not green, it is like very thin glass,  or like fine isinglass.    Look for a moment at the long curved ovipositor of the female katydid.    If you look sharp, you will see teeth on it like a little saw. It is  with these teeth the little katydid is able to rasp the surface of the  twigs, and make a place to fasten her eggs to.    Her wings are wrapped about her form like an ample cloak of green.    [Illustration]    Now, my little katydid, you may fly away if you want to.    We are very much obliged to you for letting us look at you, and we hope  we have not troubled you too much.    See her go!    How prettily the katydids fly.    They seem almost like little birds.    I am sure they love to fly about in the bright summer-time.    Happy katydids.          THE CRICKET-LIKE GRASSHOPPERS    [Illustration]      Now what strange-looking little creature are you?    John says it looks like a grasshopper, only it has no wings and its body  is not that of a grasshopper.    May says it looks like a cricket, only it has the long legs of a  grasshopper.    It is called the cricket-like grasshopper, and it is partly like a  cricket, as you see, and partly like a grasshopper.    It is a funny little fellow that lives around in dark corners, usually  in the woods.    Do see those long, spiny legs!    [Illustration]    How he _can_ jump.    He has strong, short, sharp spines on the femurs and on the tibias.    He has spines on all his legs, and what long feet he has!    Yes, Nell, his antennae are longer than anything else about him. I  should think they would be in his way.    He has no wings at all, and he never will have any.    He has two pairs of feelers in front of his mouth that show very  plainly. They show more plainly than the mouth parts of the grasshopper,  though they are quite like them.    Yes, Ned, they are larger than the mouth parts of the grasshopper.    There is another little fellow very similar to the cricket-like  grasshopper.    It has no wings, and the top of the thorax is like a broad shield.    It is called the shield-backed grasshopper.    See if you can find one of them.    [Illustration]          THE CHEERY CRICKET PEOPLE    [Illustration]      Chirp! chirp!    Chirp! chirp!    Ah, listen to that cheery song. It is the cricket on the hearth singing  thus gayly.    Dear little cricket; he lives in the corner by the fireplace. When all  is still we hear his cheery chirp! chirp! chirp!    Sometimes he comes peering out and runs across the hearth, a little  black fireside fairy.    Do you know one of the prettiest stories in the world has been written  about a cricket?    Charles Dickens wrote it, and it is called \"The Cricket on the Hearth.\"    Be sure to read this beautiful story. If you do not own it, ask to have  it for Christmas. It is in the book of \"Christmas Tales,\" a book that  everybody ought to have.    Grasshoppers and katydids are pleasant people, but they live out of  doors, and they do not seem quite so much like our very own little  friends as the crickets.    Of course the crickets live out of doors, too, only once in a while one  of them comes into the house to live with us.    We hear them chirping in the grass and among the stones.    [Illustration]    There is a certain place near the seashore where the rocks are alive  with the black cricket folk.    They come peeping out at you from all sides. They skip over the rocks,  and you will often see a pair of long feelers and an inquisitive little  head looking around a corner.    You too, know there are crickets, little Nell?    Let us go and see them.    Ah, yes, there is one, looking at us out of inquisitive eyes, over there  by that big stone.    [Illustration]    Of course they are cousins to the grasshoppers. I knew you would guess  that right away.    Yes, John, the little cricket people have flat backs.    Their wing covers do not make a peaked roof over their backs, but are  flat on top and bent down at the sides like a box cover.    [Illustration]    They are not so long as the wings of the grasshopper, but they overlap  on top.    Sometimes they are not so long as the body of the cricket.    Just watch now!    How spry the cricket folk are!    They jump well, but they also run well. They are always running about as  though they enjoyed it.    It is not easy to catch one of them unless we, too, are \"as spry as a  cricket.\"    Funny little rascals, to come peeping at us like that, from out the  crevices in the stones.    When we stir,--pop! they are back out of sight.    They eat leaves, and they enjoy a piece of nice, ripe fruit, or a bit of  juicy vegetable.    See here, one has jumped on my hand and is sitting quite still.    It is a male cricket.    [Illustration]    How do I know that?    May says because it has no ovipositor.    Yes, that is one way to know.    Look at his wing covers.    [Illustration: MALE CRICKET]    See how they are ribbed.    [Illustration: FEMALE CRICKET]    Now look at this cricket Mabel has caught. It is a female, and its  wings, you see, are not ornamented like those of the male.    [Illustration]    Do you know the meaning of his heavily ribbed wing covers?    Why, his wing covers are his musical instruments. See one of them  magnified.    It is divided into spaces like so many little drum-heads. The ridge that  runs across the top of the wing is something like a file in structure.    When little Mr. Cricket is in the mood for chirping, he raises his wing  covers and rubs them together.    This throws the stiff membranes of which the wing covers are made into  vibration, and the result is the cheery call of our little black fairy.    Little Nell says the cricket is more like a brownie than a fairy, and  maybe she is right.    You can easily see the crickets rub their wings together if you watch in  the fall of the year.    John says, Why do you have to watch in the fall of the year?    Now who can guess?    Yes, May, it is because the crickets are then full-grown, and have  large wing covers. At first, in the early summer, they have no wings,  and so of course, we could not see them chirp.    The whole grasshopper tribe is a vocal one; the males all have musical  instruments, and in Japan, the people are so fond of the song of _their_  grasshopper folk, which are not quite like ours, that they make tiny  cages for them.    The chirpers are caught and put in these cages, and sold in the city  streets.    Yes, little Nell, the crickets make molasses. So do the katydids.    All these little hopping neighbors of ours seem to understand the useful  art of molasses making.    The mole crickets are different from the others.    [Illustration]    They burrow in the ground like a mole, and we do not often see them.    The strangest thing about them is their hands.    No, of course they are not really hands, but they look like them.    All the joints of the fore legs are modified to form strong digging  tools, and they look very much like the paws of the mole.    [Illustration]    They are troublesome fellows, sometimes, when they eat the tender roots  of the vegetables in the garden.    You all have seen the little tree cricket, but you might not recognize  it as a cricket, it is such a pale little creature.    Its light green body may often be seen on bushes in the summer-time,  and, if you look carefully, the form will tell you what the little one  is.    [Illustration]          A LARGE FAMILY    [Illustration]      The crickets, grasshoppers, walking sticks, praying mantes, and  cockroaches, strange as it may seem, are all near relatives to each  other.    They all belong to one large family or order, the ORTHOPTERA.    Or-thop-te-ra, is it not a hard word!    It will not seem so hard when you know what it means.    It comes from two Greek words _orthos_, meaning straight, and _pteron_,  meaning a wing.    Straight-wing.    And do you know, it does not mean that the _upper_ wings are straight,  but that the under wings are folded down in long straight lines.    Now let us see if we can tell in what ways all of our Orthoptera are  alike.    They all have--?    \"Four wings\"--that is right, little Nell.    What, John? the walking sticks have no wings?    [Illustration]    Not our walking sticks, but yet they belong to a winged family. You  remember the tropical walking sticks that have queer leaf-like"]]]
