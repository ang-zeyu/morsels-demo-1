Maida showed Rosie her books, her Venetian beads, all her cherished  possessions. Rosie liked the canaries better than anything. \"Just  think of having six!\" she said. Then, sitting upstairs in Maida's  bedroom, the two little girls had a long confidential talk.    \"I've been just crazy to know you, Maida,\" Rosie confessed. \"But  there was no way of getting acquainted, for you always stayed in the  store. I had to wait until I could tease mother to buy me a top.\"    \"That's funny,\" Maida said, \"for I was just wild to know you. I kept  hoping that you'd come in. I hope you'll come often, Rosie, for I  don't know any other little girl of my own age.\"    \"You know Laura Lathrop, don't you?\" Rosie asked with a sideways  look.    \"Yes, but I don't like her.\"    \"Nobody likes her,\" Rosie said. \"She's too much of a smarty-cat. She  loves to get people over there and then show off before them. And  then she puts on so many airs. I won't have anything to do with  her.\"    From the open window came the shrill scream of Miss Allison's  parrot. \"What do you think of that?\" it called over and over again.    \"Isn't that a clever bird?\" Rosie asked admiringly. \"His name is  Tony. I have lots of fun with him. Did you ever see a parrot that  could talk, before?\"    \"Oh, yes, we have several at Pride's.\"    \"Pride's?\"    \"Pride's Crossing. That's where we go summers.\"    \"And what do your parrots say?\"    \"One talked in French. He used to say 'Taisez-vous' so much that  sometimes we would have to put a cover over the cage to stop him.\"    \"And did you have other animals besides parrots?\" Rosie asked. \"I  love animals.\"    \"Oh, yes, we had horses and dogs and cats and rabbits and dancing  mice and marmosets and macaws and parokets and--I guess I've  forgotten some of them. But if you like animals, you ought to go to  our place in the Adirondacks--there are deer preserves there and  pheasants and peacocks.\"    \"Who do they belong to?\"    \"My father.\"    Rosie considered this. \"Does he keep a bird-place?\" she asked in a  puzzled tone.    \"No.\" Maida's tone was a little puzzled too. She did not know what a  bird-place was.    \"Well, did he sell them?\"    \"I don't think he ever sold any. He gave a great many away, though.\"    When Rosie went home, Maida walked as far as her gate with her.    \"Want to know a secret, Maida?\" Rosie asked suddenly, her eyes  dancing with mischief.    \"Oh, yes. I love secrets.\"    \"Cross your throat then.\"    Maida did not know how to cross her throat but Rosie taught her.    \"Well, then,\" Rosie whispered, \"my mother doesn't know that I went  to your house. She sent me to bed for being naughty. And I got up  and dressed and climbed out my window on to the shed without anybody  knowing it. She'll never know the difference.\"    \"Oh, Rosie,\" Maida said in a horrified tone, \"Please never do it  again.\" In spite of herself, Maida's eyes twinkled.    But Rosie only laughed. Maida watched her steal into her yard,  watched her climb over the shed, watched her disappear through the  window.    But she grieved over the matter as she walked home. Perhaps it was  because she was thinking so deeply that she did not notice how quiet  they all were in the living-room. But as she crossed the threshold,  a pair of arms seized her and swung her into the air.    \"Oh, papa, papa,\" she whispered, cuddling her face against his, \"how  glad I am to see you.\"    He marched with her over to the light.    \"Well, little shop-keeper,\" he said after a long pause in which he  studied her keenly, \"you're beginning to look like a real live  girl.\" He dropped her gently to her feet. \"Now show me your shop.\"                                  CHAPTER V: PRIMROSE COURT      But during that first two weeks a continual rush of business made  long days for Maida. All the children in the neighborhood were  curious to see the place. It had been dark and dingy as long as they  could remember. Now it was always bright and pretty--always sweet  with the perfume of flowers, always gay with the music of birds. But  more, the children wanted to see the lame little girl who \"tended  store,\" who seemed to try so hard to please her customers and who  was so affectionate and respectful with the old, old lady whom she  called \"Granny.\"    At noon and night the bell sounded a continuous tinkle.    For a week Maida kept rather close to the shop. She wanted to get  acquainted with all her customers. Moreover, she wanted to find out  which of the things she had bought sold quickly and which were  unpopular.    After a day or two her life fell into a regular programme.    Early in the morning she would put the shop to rights for the day's  sale, dusting, replacing the things she had sold, rearranging them  often according to some pretty new scheme.    About eight o'clock the bell would call her into the shop and it  would be brisk work until nine. Then would come a rest of three  hours, broken only by an occasional customer. In this interval she  often worked in the yard, raking up the leaves that fell from vine  and bush, picking the bravely-blooming dahlias, gathering sprays of  woodbine for the vases, scattering crumbs to the birds.    At twelve the children would begin to flood the shop again and Maida  would be on her feet constantly until two. Between two and four came  another long rest. After school trade started up again. Often it  lasted until six, when she locked the door for the night.    In her leisure moments she used to watch the people coming and going  in Primrose Court. With Rosie's and Dicky's help, she soon knew  everybody by name. She discovered by degrees that on the right side  of the court lived the Hales, the Clarks, the Doyles and the Dores;  on the left side, the Duncans, the Brines and the Allisons. In the  big house at the back lived the Lathrops.    Betsy was a great delight to Maida, for the neighborhood brimmed  with stories of her mischief. She had buried her best doll in the  ash-barrel, thrown her mother's pocketbook down the cesspool, put  all the clean laundry into a tub of water and painted the parlor  fireplace with tomato catsup. In a single afternoon, having become  secretly possessed of a pair of scissors, she cut all the fringe off  the parlor furniture, cut great scallops in the parlor curtains, cut  great patches of fur off the cat's back. When her mother found her,  she was busy cutting her own hair.    Often Granny would hear the door slam on Maida's hurried rush from  the shop. Hobbling to the window, she would see the child leading  Betsy by the hand. \"Running away again,\" was all Maida would say.  Occasionally Maida would call in a vexed tone, \"Now _how_ did she  creep past the window without my seeing her?\" And outside would be  rosy-cheeked, brass-buttoned Mr. Flanagan, carrying Betsy home. Once  Billy arrived at the shop, bearing Betsy in his arms. \"She was  almost to the bridge,\" he said, \"when I caught sight of her from the  car window. The little tramp!\"    Betsy never seemed to mind being caught. For an instant the little  rosebud that was her mouth would part over the tiny pearls that were  her teeth. This roguish smile seemed to say: \"You wait until the  next time. You won't catch me then.\"    Sometimes Betsy would come into the shop for an hour's play. Maida  loved to have her there but it was like entertaining a whirlwind.  Betsy had a strong curiosity to see what the drawers and boxes  contained. Everything had to be put back in its place when she left.    Next to the Hales lived the Clarks. By the end of the first week  Maida was the chief adoration of the Clark twins. Dorothy and Mabel  were just as good as Betsy was naughty. When they came over to see  Maida, they played quietly with whatever she chose to give them. It  was an hour, ordinarily, before they could be made to talk above a  whisper. If they saw Maida coming into the court, they would run to  her side, slipping a hot little hand into each of hers. Attended  always by this roly-poly bodyguard, Maida would limp from group to  group of the playing children. Nobody in Primrose Court could tell  the Clark twins apart. Maida soon learned the difference although  she could never explain it to anybody else. \"It's something you have  to feel,\" she said.    Billy Potter enjoyed the twins as much as Maida did. \"Good morning,  Dorothy-Mabel,\" he always said when he met one of them; \"is this you  or your sister?\" And he always answered their whispered remarks with  whispers so much softer than theirs that he finally succeeded in  forcing them to raise their shy little voices.    The Doyles and the Dores lived in one house next to the Clarks,  Molly and Tim on the first floor, Dicky and Delia above. Maida  became very fond of the Doyle children. Like Betsy, they were too  young to go to school and she saw a good deal of them in the lonely  school hours. The puddle was an endless source of amusement to them.  As long as it remained, they entertained themselves playing along  its shores.    \"There's that choild in the water again,\" Granny would cry from the  living-room.    Looking out, Maida would see Tim spread out on all fours. Like an  obstinate little pig, he would lie still until Molly picked him up.  She would take him home and in a few moments he would reappear in  fresh, clean clothes again.    \"Hello, Tim,\" Billy Potter would say whenever they met. \"Fallen into  a pud-muddle lately?\"    The word _pud-muddle_ always sent Tim off into peals of laughter. It  was the only thing Maida had discovered that could make him laugh,  for he was as serious as Molly was merry. Molly certainly was the  jolliest little girl in the court--Maida had never seen her with  anything but a smiling face.    Dicky's mother went to work so early and came back so late that  Maida had never seen her. But Dicky soon became an intimate. Maida  had begun the reading lessons and Dicky was so eager to get on that  they were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17546"],[0,"The Lion of Saint Mark: A Story of Venice in the Fourteenth Century (#10)"],[1,"of the republic, with our rights  and privileges, which cannot be infringed even by the most powerful;  and the poorest citizen has an equal right to make himself as  proficient in the arms, which he may be called upon to wield in defence  of the state, as the Doge himself. In your country also, I believe, all  men are obliged to learn the use of arms, to practise shooting at the  butts, and to make themselves efficient, if called upon to take part in  the wars of the country. And I have heard that at the jousts, the  champions of the city of London have ere now held their own against  those of the court.\"    \"They have done so,\" Francis said; \"and yet, I know not why, it is  considered unseemly for the sons of well-to-do citizens to be too fond  of military exercises.\"    \"The idea is a foolish one,\" the Venetian said hotly. \"I myself have, a  score of times, defended my ships against corsairs and pirates,  Genoese, and other enemies. I have fought against the Greeks, and been  forced to busy myself in more than one serious fray in the streets of  Constantinople, Alexandria, and other ports, and have served in the  galleys of the state. All men who live by trade must be in favour of  peace; but they must also be prepared to defend their goods, and the  better able they are to do it, the more the honour to them.    \"But here we are at the Piazzetta.\"    A group of nobles were standing near the landing place, and Signor  Polani at once went up to them, and introduced Francis to them as the  gentleman who had done his daughter and their kinswoman such good  service. Francis was warmly thanked and congratulated by them all.    \"Will you wait near the entrance?\" Signor Polani said. \"I see that my  young cousin, Matteo, has accompanied his father, and you will, no  doubt, find enough to say to each other while we are with the council.\"    The gentlemen entered the palace, and Matteo, who had remained  respectfully at a short distance from the seniors, at once joined his  friend.    \"Well, Francis, I congratulate you heartily, though I feel quite  jealous of you. It was splendid to think of your dashing up in your  gondola, and carrying off my pretty cousins from the clutches of that  villain, Ruggiero Mocenigo, just as he was about to lay his hands on  them.\"    \"Are you sure it was Ruggiero, Matteo?\"    \"Oh, there can't be any doubt about it. You know, he had asked for  Maria's hand, and when Polani refused him, had gone off muttering  threats. You know what his character is. He is capable of any evil  action; besides, they say that he has dissipated his patrimony, in  gaming and other extravagances at Constantinople, and is deep in the  hands of the Jews. If he could have succeeded in carrying off Maria it  would more than have mended his fortunes, for she and her sister are  acknowledged to be the richest heiresses in Venice. Oh, there is not a  shadow of doubt that it's he.    \"You won't hear me saying anything against your love of prowling about  in that gondola of yours, since it has brought you such a piece of good  fortune--for it is a piece of good fortune, Francis, to have rendered  such a service to Polani, to say nothing of all the rest of us who are  connected with his family. I can tell you that there are scores of  young men of good birth in Venice, who would give their right hand to  have done what you did.\"    \"I should have considered myself fortunate to have been of service to  any girls threatened by violence, though they had only been fishermen's  daughters,\" Francis said; \"but I am specially pleased because they are  relatives of yours, Matteo.\"    \"To say nothing to their being two of the prettiest girls in Venice,\"  Matteo added slyly.    \"That counts for something too, no doubt,\" Francis said laughing,  \"though I didn't think of it.    \"I wonder,\" he went on gravely, \"whether that was Ruggiero whom I  struck down, and whether he came up again to the surface. He has very  powerful connections, you know, Matteo; and if I have gained friends, I  shall also have gained enemies by the night's work.\"    \"That is so,\" Matteo agreed. \"For your sake, I own that I hope that  Ruggiero is at present at the bottom of the canal. He was certainly no  credit to his friends; and although they would of course have stood by  him, I do not think they will feel, at heart, in any way displeased to  know that he will trouble them no longer. But if his men got him out  again, I should say you had best be careful, for Ruggiero is about the  last man in Venice I should care to have as an enemy. However, we won't  look at the unpleasant side of the matter, and will hope that his  career has been brought to a close.\"    \"I don't know which way to hope,\" Francis said gravely. \"He will  certainly be a dangerous enemy if he is alive; and yet the thought of  having killed a man troubles me much.\"    \"It would not trouble me at all if I were in your place,\" Matteo said.  \"If you had not killed him, you may be very sure that he would have  killed you, and that the deed would have caused him no compunction  whatever. It was a fair fight, just as if it had been a hostile galley  in mid-sea; and I don't see why the thought of having rid Venice of one  of her worst citizens need trouble you in any way.\"    \"You see I have been brought up with rather different ideas to yours,  Matteo. My father, as a trader, is adverse to fighting of all  kinds--save, of course, in defence of one's country; and although he  has not blamed me in any way for the part I took, I can see that he is  much disquieted, and indeed speaks of sending me back to England at  once.\"    \"Oh, I hope not!\" Matteo said earnestly. \"Hitherto you and I have been  great friends, Francis, but we shall be more in future. All Polani's  friends will regard you as one of themselves; and I was even thinking,  on my way here, that perhaps you and I might enter the service of the  state together, and get appointed to a war galley in a few years.\"    \"My father's hair would stand up at the thought, Matteo; though, for  myself, I should like nothing so well. However, that could never have  been. Still I am sorry, indeed, at the thought of leaving Venice. I  have been very happy here, and I have made friends, and there is always  something to do or talk about; and the life in London would be so dull  in comparison. But here comes one of the ushers from the palace.\"    The official came up to them, and asked if either of them was Messer  Francisco Hammond, and, finding that he had come to the right person,  requested Francis to follow him.        Chapter 4: Carried Off.      It was with a feeling of considerable discomfort, and some awe, that  Francis Hammond followed his conductor to the chamber of the Council.  It was a large and stately apartment. The decorations were magnificent,  and large pictures, representing events in the wars of Venice, hung  round the walls. The ceiling was also superbly painted. The cornices  were heavily gilded. Curtains of worked tapestry hung by the windows,  and fell behind him as he entered the door.    At a table of horseshoe shape eleven councillors, clad in the long  scarlet robes, trimmed with ermine, which were the distinguishing dress  of Venetian senators, were seated--the doge himself acting as  president. On their heads they wore black velvet caps, flat at the top,  and in shape somewhat resembling the flat Scotch bonnet. Signor Polani  and his companions were seated in chairs, facing the table.    When Francis entered the gondolier was giving evidence as to the attack  upon his boat. Several questions were asked him when he had finished,  and he was then told to retire. The usher then brought Francis forward.    \"This is Messer Francisco Hammond,\" he said.    \"Tell your story your own way,\" the doge said.    Francis related the story of the attack on the gondola, and the escape  of the ladies in his boat.    \"How came you, a foreigner and a youth, to interfere in a fray of this  kind?\" one of the councillors asked.    \"I did not stop to think of my being a stranger, or a youth,\" Francis  replied quietly. \"I heard the screams of women in distress, and felt  naturally bound to render them what aid I could.\"    \"Did you know who the ladies were?\"    \"I knew them only by sight. My friend Matteo Giustiniani had pointed  them out to me, on one occasion, as being the daughters of Signor  Polani, and connections of his. When their gondola had passed mine, a  few minutes previously, I recognized their faces by the light of the  torches in their boat.\"    \"Were the torches burning brightly?\" another of the council asked;  \"because it may be that this attack was not intended against them, but  against some others.\"    \"The light was bright enough for me to recognize their faces at a  glance,\" Francis said, \"and also the yellow and white sashes of their  gondoliers.\"    \"Did you see any badge or cognizance, either on the gondola or on the  persons of the assailants?\"    \"I did not,\" Francis said. \"They certainly wore none. One of the  torches in the Polani gondola had been extinguished in the fray, but  the other was still burning, and, had the gondoliers worn coloured  sashes or other distinguishing marks, I should have noticed them.\"    \"Should you recognize, were you to see them again, any of the  assailants?\"    \"I should not,\" Francis said. \"They were all masked.\"    \"You say you struck down the one who appeared to be their leader with  an oar, as he was about to leap into your boat. How was it the oar was  in your hand instead of that of your gondolier?\"    \"I was myself rowing,\" Francis said. \"In London, rowing is an amusement  of which boys of all classes are fond, and since I have been out here  with my father I have learned to row a gondola; and sometimes, when I  am out of an evening, I take an oar as well as my gondolier, enjoying  the exercise and the speed at which the boat goes along. I was not  rowing when the signora's boat"]]]
