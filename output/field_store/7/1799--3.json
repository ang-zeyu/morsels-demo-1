But she seemed curious about him. Bessy Bell came  and sat beside her, watching Lane.    \"Daren, do you dance?\" queried Helen. \"You used to be good. But  dancing is not the same. It's all fox-trot, toddle, shimmy nowadays.\"    \"I'm afraid my dancing days are over,\" replied Lane.    \"How so? I see you came back with two legs and arms.\"    \"Yes. But I was shot twice through one leg--it's about all I can do to  walk now.\"    Following his easy laugh, a little silence ensued. Helen's green eyes  seemed to narrow and concentrate on Lane. Dick Swann inhaled a deep  draught of his cigarette, then let the smoke curl up from his lips to  enter his nostrils. Mackay rather uneasily shifted his feet. And Bessy  Bell gazed with wonderful violet eyes at Lane.    \"Oh! You were _shot_!\" she whispered.    \"Yes,\" replied Lane, and looked directly at her, prompted by her  singular tone. A glance was enough to show Lane that this very young  girl was an entirely new type to him. She seemed to vibrate with  intensity. All the graceful lines of her body seemed strangely  instinct with pulsing life. She was bottled lightning. In a flash Lane  sensed what made her different from the fifteen-year-olds he  remembered before the war. It was what made his sister Lorna  different. He felt it in Helen's scrutiny of him, in the speculation  of her eyes. Then Bessy Bell leaned toward Lane, and softly,  reverently touched the medal upon his breast.    \"The _Croix de Guerre_,\" she said, in awe. \"That's the French badge of  honor.... It means you must have done something great.... You must  have--_killed_ Germans!\"    Bessy sank back upon the lounge, clasping her hands, and her eyes  appeared to darken, to turn purple with quickening thought and  emotion. Her exclamation brought the third girl of the party over to  the lounge. She was all eyes. Her apathy had vanished. She did not  see the sulky young fellow who had followed her.    Lane could have laughed aloud. He read the shallow souls of these  older girls. They could not help their instincts and he had learned  that it was instinctive with women to become emotional over soldiers.  Bessy Bell was a child. Hero-worship shone from her speaking eyes.  Whatever other young men might be to her, no one of them could compare  with a soldier.    The situation had its pathos, its tragedy, and its gratification for  Lane. He saw clearly, and felt with the acuteness of a woman. Helen  had jilted him for such young men as these. So in the feeling of the  moment it cost him nothing to thrill and fascinate these girls with  the story of how he had been shot through the leg. It pleased him to  see Helen's green eyes dilate, to see Bessy Bell shudder. Presently  Lane turned to speak to the supercilious Swann.    \"I didn't have the luck to run across you in France!\" he queried.    \"No. I didn't go,\" replied Swann.    \"How was that? Didn't the draft get you?\"    \"Yes. But my eyes were bad. And my father needed me at the works. We  had a big army contract in steel.\"    \"Oh, I see,\" returned Lane, with a subtle alteration of manner he  could not, did not want to control. But it was unmistakable in its  detachment. Next his gaze on Mackay did not require the accompaniment  of a query.    \"I was under weight. They wouldn't accept me,\" he explained.    Bessy Bell looked at Mackay disdainfully. \"Why didn't you drink a  bucketful of water--same as Billy Means did? He got in.\"    Helen laughed gayly. \"What! Mac drink water? He'd be ill.... Come,  let's dance. Dick put on that new one. Daren, you can watch us dance.\"    Swann did as he was bidden, and as a loud, violent discordance blared  out of the machine he threw away his cigarette, and turned to Helen.  She seemed to leap at him. She had a pantherish grace. Swann drew her  closely to him, with his arm all the way round her, while her arm  encircled his neck. They began a fast swaying walk, in which Swann  appeared to be forcing the girl over backwards. They swayed, and  turned, and glided; they made strange abrupt movements in accordance  with the jerky tune; they halted at the end of a walk to make little  steps forward and back; then they began to bounce and sway together in  a motion that Lane instantly recognized as a toddle. Lane remembered  the one-step, the fox-trot and other new dances of an earlier day,  when the craze for new dancing had become general, but this sort of  gyration was vastly something else. It disgusted Lane. He felt the  blood surge to his face. He watched Helen Wrapp in the arms of Swann,  and he realized, whatever had been the state of his heart on his  return home, he did not love her now. Even if the war had not  disrupted his mind in an unaccountable way, even if he had loved Helen  Wrapp right up to that moment, such singular abandonment to a  distorted strange music, to the close and unmistakably sensual embrace  of a man--that spectacle would have killed his love.    Lane turned his gaze away. The young fellow Vancey was pulling at  Bessy Bell, and she shook his hand off. \"No, Roy, I don't want to  dance.\" Lane heard above the jarring, stringing notes. Mackay was  smoking, and looked on as if bored. In a moment more the Victrola  rasped out its last note.    Helen's face was flushed and moist. Her bosom heaved. Her gown hung  closely to her lissom and rather full form. A singular expression of  excitement, of titillation, almost wild, a softer expression almost  dreamy, died out of her face. Lane saw Swann lead Helen up to a small  table beside the Victrola. Here stood a large pitcher of lemonade, and  a number of glasses. Swann filled a glass half full, from the pitcher,  and then, deliberately pulling a silver flask from his hip pocket he  poured some of its dark red contents into the glass. Helen took it  from him, and turned to Lane with a half-mocking glance.    \"Daren, I remember you never drank,\" she said. \"Maybe the war made a  man of you!... Will you have a sip of lemonade with a shot in it?\"    \"No, thank you,\" replied Lane.    \"Didn't you drink over there?\" she queried.    \"Only when I had to,\" he rejoined, shortly.    All of the four dancers partook of a drink of lemonade, strengthened  by something from Swann's flask. Lane was quick to observe that when  it was pressed upon Bessy Bell she refused to take it: \"I hate booze,\"  she said, with a grimace. His further impression of Bessy Bell, then,  was that she had just fallen in with this older crowd, and  sophisticated though she was, had not yet been corrupted. The  divination of this heightened his interest.    \"Well, Daren, you old prune, what'd you think of the toddle?\" asked  Helen, as she took a cigarette offered by Swann and tipped it between  her red lips.    \"Is that what you danced?\"    \"I'll say so. And Dick and I are considered pretty spiffy.\"    \"I don't think much of it, Helen,\" replied Lane, deliberately. \"If you  care to--to do that sort of thing I'd imagine you'd rather do it  alone.\"    \"Oh Lord, you talk like mother,\" she exclaimed.    \"Lane, you're out of date,\" said Swann, with a little sneer.    Lane took a long, steady glance at Swann, but did not reply.    \"Daren, everybody has been dancing jazz. It's the rage. The old dances  were slow. The new ones have pep and snap.\"    \"So I see. They have more than that,\" returned Lane. \"But pray, never  mind me. I'm out of date. Go ahead and dance.... If you'd rather, I'll  leave and call on you some other time.\"    \"No, you stay,\" she replied. \"I'll chase this bunch pretty soon.\"    \"Well, you won't chase me. I'll go,\" spoke up Swann, sullenly, with a  fling of his cigarette.    \"You needn't hurt yourself,\" returned Helen, sarcastically.    \"So long, people,\" said Swann to the others. But it was perfectly  obvious that he did not include Lane. It was also obvious, at least to  Lane, that Swann showed something of intolerance and mastery in the  dark, sullen glance he bestowed upon Helen. She followed him across  the room and out into the hall, from whence her guarded voice sounded  unintelligibly. But Lane's keen ear, despite the starting of the  Victrola, caught Swann's equally low, yet clearer reply. \"You can't  kid me. I'm on. You'll vamp Lane if he lets you. Go to it!\"    As Helen came back into the room Mackay ran for her, and locking her  in the same embrace--even a tighter one than Swann's--he fell into the  strange steps that had so shocked Lane. Moreover, he was manifestly a  skilful dancer, and showed the thin, lithe, supple body of one trained  down by this or some other violent exercise.    Lane did not watch the dancers this time. Again Bessy Bell refused to  get up from the lounge. The youth was insistent. He pawed at her. And  manifestly she did not like that, for her face flamed, and she  snapped: \"Stop it--you bonehead! Can't you see I want to sit here by  Mr. Lane?\"    The youth slouched away fuming to himself.    Whereupon Lane got up, and seated himself beside Bessy so that he need  not shout to be heard.    \"That was nice of you, Miss Bell--but rather hard on the youngster,\"  said Lane.    \"He makes me sick. All he wants to do is lolly-gag.... Besides, after  what you said to Helen about the jazz I wouldn't dance in front of you  on a bet.\"    She was forceful, frank, naive. She was impressed by his nearness; but  Lane saw that it was the fact of his being a soldier with a record,  not his mere physical propinquity that affected her. She seemed both  bold and shy. But she did not show any modesty. Her short skirt came  above her bare knees, and she did not try to hide them from Lane's  sight. At fifteen, like his sister Lorna, this girl had the  development of a young woman. She breathed health, and something  elusive that Lane could not catch. If it had not been for her apparent  lack of shame, and her rouged lips and cheeks, and her plucked  eyebrows, she would have been exceedingly alluring. But no beauty,  however striking, could "]]]
