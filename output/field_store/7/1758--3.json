We're taking a big  risk on the chance of selling him.\"    \"Oh, go ahead and kill him if you want to,\" the other man shrugged his  shoulders. \"Let your spite keep you from making a thousand dollars.\"    He held out a bottle, \"Here's the chloroform. Go on, finish the job if  you're going to.\"    \"I don't believe you can sell him,\" sneered William. \"You just said that  because you knew I was going to kill him before I left here.\"    \"If you didn't hate dogs the way you do,\" replied Shorty, \"you'd know  that he'll sell for a thousand dollars as soon as he is over the  Canadian line. The man I told you about will buy that dog without a  question.\"    \"Some one will recognize the dog before we get there, if the old man  stirs things up.\"    \"Not when I get him fixed,\" bragged Shorty.    \"There's no time to fool with him,\" persisted William, \"We've got to get  away quick.\"    \"Let me alone,\" snapped Shorty. \"This is my end of the job. If you stop  picking on the dog, I'll have no trouble with him. I never knew a dog  from the time we were kids that didn't hate you on sight.\"    \"Yes, and you're a regular fool over them,\" William retorted. \"You take  care of him and get the money for him, and I'll look out for the machine  and sell that. But you've got to keep that dog muzzled or there'll be  trouble coming your way fast and plenty. See?\"    Shorty did not answer and William went out. Jan and Shorty faced each  other. The dog's muscles were taut, his eyes alert. The man looked at  him steadily.    \"You're the dandiest, spunkiest dog I ever saw,\" he said at last, as  though sure that Jan understood the words. \"I like you, old fellow, and  I'd turn you loose, if I dared.\"    He placed a pan of water in front of the dog and the angry gleam  softened in Jan's eyes. He thrust his nose into the pan but the muzzle  was too tight to permit him to drink. The dog looked up at Shorty, who  reached out his hand. Jan's tail waved, then he felt fingers run lightly  along his shoulders, fumble at the buckle of the muzzle and the cruel  thing fell to the floor. Before the dog lapped the water that he craved,  he stared into Shorty's face and saw a kindly smile that told him this  man was a friend. Jan's hot tongue touched Shorty's hand before turning  to lap the cool liquid.    \"You'll be all right now,\" Shorty said as he rubbed the places where the  strap had cut deeply. Then when Jan had finished drinking, the man fed  him bits of meat.    After the meal was over, Shorty took a pair of clippers and cropped  Jan's long hair close to the skin. It did not hurt, so the dog submitted  quietly. A sponge and bucket of dark liquid were brought by the man and  Jan was thoroughly saturated, until the dye dripped to the floor.    \"Got to put on that muzzle, boy, before he gets back,\" but this time the  strips did not hurt so badly.    William chuckled when he saw the dog. \"Great stunt, Shorty! The  poundmaster wouldn't know his own dog if he caught him now!\"    He picked up a couple of bundles and a suitcase, while Shorty led Jan by  the rope. They were in a deep canyon, where no sound of the ocean could  be heard. Jan did not know the place. He had never been away from the  noise of the surf since living in California. A big, black automobile  stood under a tree. William tossed the things into it and climbed to the  front seat with a laugh.    \"The police will have as much trouble finding a grey machine as the  poundman will have finding a long-haired St. Bernard dog. We'll hit the  road lively at night and camp in the day. There's just one thing you've  got to remember. If I see you getting stuck on that dog I'm going to  kill him. I'm taking him along because you said you could sell him, and  I'm not going to stand any nonsense about it.\"    Shorty's only answer was to open the back door of the machine and motion  the dog to jump. He obeyed and curled on the floor. Shorty sat in the  back seat while William drove.    Jan did not sleep during the long, dark hours they sped over the road.  He kept wondering what the captain would think, and hoping he could get  back home some way. Once in a while he lifted his head as a flash of  light showed another automobile passing. At daybreak William turned into  thick brush and drove over rough ground until they stopped beside a  shallow stream.    Still muzzled, Jan leaped from the car and followed Shorty, but he  watched William closely. The dog was tied after he had been allowed to  drink at the creek. William loafed while Shorty made coffee and cooked a  meal, which the older man ate, grumbling all the time. Then he threw  himself on the ground and dragged his hat over his face.    Shorty fed Jan, and after clearing away the breakfast things, moved  closer to the dog. Jan's tail rustled the dry leaves and twigs, as  Shorty, with a boyish smile, stretched on the ground beside him. A hand  touched one of Jan's ears and pulled it gently, but the hand was  friendly and the dog's eyes showed he understood. Then, tired from the  long ride, Shorty and Jan slept soundly.    At dusk another meal was prepared and eaten, and they started again on  their journey. For two more days and nights they travelled in the dark  and camped in hidden places during the day, so that no one could see  them. The muzzle was never taken again from Jan's nose, for William  watched constantly and repeated his warnings several times. He did not  know, however, that Shorty eased the strap so that the wire and leather  could not cut, and in this way he made Jan as comfortable as was  possible.    The night of the third day there was a full moon, and dim shadows were  cast by scattered trees near the road. It was very warm and Jan's muzzle  worried him; then, too, he was stiff from lack of the exercise to which  he had been accustomed. Shorty noticed the dog's restlessness and leaned  down. His fingers slipped under the strap and wires, then touched the  buckle at the side of the head. Jan squirmed nearer and wagged his tail.  Each night when they were well on the way, Shorty did this much to help  the dog, but he had to tighten the muzzle before William turned the  machine from the road to camp for the day.    As Shorty leaned over, the car reached a clear place in the road, where  the moon shone brightly. Shorty did not see William turn, but a brutal  fist struck full force against Shorty's face and he tumbled from the  seat into the bottom of the automobile against Jan.    The dog growled, but the growl was meant for William, not Shorty. Then  Jan knew that Shorty was up on his feet and both men were swearing and  fighting, while the automobile twisted from side to side of the road,  and was going faster and faster. There was a crash. Jan whirled over and  over through the air and as he struck the ground he heard a man's scream  of pain. He did not know whether it was Shorty or William who cried out,  but he did know that he was free, and he dashed into the darkness of  the thick trees, not knowing where he was going, not caring where he  went, only the one thing was in his mind--he was leaving William behind  and he must run as fast as he could.          Chapter IX    JAN'S JOURNEY TO THE LAND OF MAKE-BELIEVE      After the first wild dash for freedom, Jan settled to a steady jog for  the rest of the night. When dawn came, some instinct made him turn into  the brush where it grew most thickly. His one fear now was that William  might find him. His one wish was to get back home. He did not know what  kept him moving toward the south. He had nothing to guide him save the  strange feeling that made him sure if he just kept on, some day he would  reach the gate of the bungalow and see Hippity-Hop and the captain  watching down the street for him.    Jan was able to lap water when he found it, but he could not fight, nor  eat, even if he had found food, for the muzzle clamped his jaws  together. He knew better now than to tug at it with his claws or rub it  against the ground. The second night he was very hungry, but he started  hopefully on his way, plodding steadily in the same direction. At dawn  he was faint and weak from hunger and exhaustion, and when it grew dark  again he did not want to move. Then he thought of the captain. Wearily  Jan rose to his feet and with low-hanging head he dragged slowly along.    The fourth day after the escape, he was too weak to struggle further,  and lay limp on the ground, with his eyes closed. He wanted to keep  perfectly still, though he was suffering keenly from thirst, for he had  not found any water that day. A rabbit darted from the thick brush close  to Jan's head. The rustling of leaves made the dog's eyes open. He saw  the little creature sit up in sudden fright, but Jan did not try to  catch it, he was too tired and besides he knew that the muzzle held him  a prisoner. So he watched the rabbit hop about him fearlessly, until the  sound of steps in dry leaves startled it into the bushes.    Jan heard the steps, too. He thought William had found him, and knowing  that he could not fight nor defend himself, he dragged himself wearily  to his feet and staggered with trembling legs a few, short steps. Then  he dropped heavily.    Voices sounded. Jan's ears lifted and quivered, his eyes brightened and  his tail moved slightly. He was not afraid of children. They had always  loved and petted him. Once more he rose and slowly pushed through the  thicket to an open place where two little girls laughed and chattered as  they picked wild blackberries into a small tin pail.    He edged toward the sunbonnets bobbing over the pail. The children heard  the rustle and turned about, then the pail dropped, the berries spilled  on the ground and the sunbonnet children ran, screaming wildly, \"Father!  Father! It's a big, black bear to eat all of us up!\"    The dog halted, wondering why they ran from him.

I have been told by many of their  teachers that the difficulty in teaching these children is not so much  to make them work as to rouse them to a sense of the importance of speed  and accuracy, and yet we often see children from this class growing into  men and women of very high intellectual ability.    There are also some who think that the Native has no great capacity for  mechanics and engineering generally, but I have seen so many instances  of mechanical resourcefulness and inventiveness in Natives who have only  had a superficial acquaintance with machinery that I cannot doubt that  with technical education like that given to European apprentices they  will attain to proficiency equal to that of the whites.    I do not profess the knowledge of a pedagogue in these matters. I speak  simply from an insight gained through many years of observation and  study at first hand. I have listened to thousands of old Native men of  many different tribes in my time, I have heard them speak their inmost  thoughts, not through interpreters--who ever learned anything through an  interpreter?--I have studied these people in and out of Court,  officially and privately, in their kraals and in the veld during many  years, and I say that I can find nothing whatever throughout the whole  gamut of the Native's conscious life and soul to differentiate him from  other human beings in other parts of the world. In his sense of sorrow  and of humour, in his moral intuitions, in his percipience of proportion  and in all the subtle elements that go to make up the mental  constitution of modern man, I see no difference in him from the European  variety which to-day stands at the highest point of human achievement,  but I freely confess that the African Native has so far shown a lack of  that will to think analytically and critically which in the civilised  man is the result of a continuous discontent with things as they are, a  discontent which has urged him up to his present plane of racial  supremacy.    But the reason for the fact that the African Natives have never thought  as hard and as long as the ancient and modern peoples of other lands  lies not, I think, in a lack of inherent capacity but in a lack of  opportunity, the meaning of which now comes to be considered.      ACHIEVEMENT.    We have now come to the point where an answer must be given to the  question: If the African Natives are on the whole endowed with a mental  capacity equal to that possessed by the Europeans why have they never  achieved any civilisation at all comparable with those cultures which  have been successively set up by the people of Europe, Asia and Ancient  America?    If we take it for granted that the Africans have never achieved a  civilisation similar to those that date back beyond the limits of  history, a premiss by no means assured seeing that there are signs of  cycles of civilisations coming before those of which we have written or  monumental records and of whose ethnic origin there is no certain  knowledge, then the question may appear to have no other answer than  the assumed lack of inherent capacity in the black race, but let us  consider the matter closely.    The question asked depends upon the proposition that achievement is the  sole test of capacity or, in other words, that achievement must  necessarily follow capacity, and this is a proposition by no means free  from doubt. It is plain that a desire to achieve is a condition  precedent to achievement but it is equally plain that there may well be  ability without ambition. The question why civilisation has not followed  apparent capacity may with equal propriety be asked about races whose  mental abilities have never been doubted. Consider, for instance, two  such widely separated races as the Red Indians of our own times and the  Northmen who roamed over the seas in the days of Alfred the Great.    The North American Indians, though they achieved no civilisation to be  compared with the cultures of Mexico and Peru, yet conserved a very high  degree of initiative in other directions. According to competent  observers, these people have shown a capacity for wiliness and a power  of divination of the obscured workings of nature and of the human mind  which have never been surpassed elsewhere. That the high moral and  mental status of these people is fully recognised by their European  successors is proved by the fact that many Americans in high stations  to-day actually boast of having in their veins the blood of the North  American Indian. And yet these highly gifted people had not when  Columbus discovered America attained to the knowledge of iron. Despite  the advantages of a most favourable environment and a stimulating  climate, the Red Indians were in point of mechanical development behind  the earliest Bantu; they had no iron implements, no tillage and no  settled or permanent abodes, and whatever may have been the cause of  their lack of development, the fact remains that there was no  achievement despite undeniable capacity.    The early Scandinavians who lived in a state of barbarism ages before  and long after Egypt, Mesopotamia, India, Greece and Rome developed  their various civilisations, furnish another illustration of the fact  that there may well be capacity without accomplishment, for no one can  doubt the keenness of the minds of these people who have advanced to the  front ranks of human endeavour. These rude sea-rovers must have lived in  what is generally supposed to have been a most stimulating climate  during long ages while other races in Southern Europe and in Asia built  up mighty civilisations within environments that seem to have been far  less incitative of progress.    Although the broad facts of history are known to us the causes that have  contributed in the past to keep down some races while other peoples who  were no better endowed or situated rose to the greatest heights of human  effort cannot be stated with certainty. It is easy to cite the  circumstances that are commonly conjectured as accounting for the origin  and growth of civilisation, such as soil, climate and geographical  position, but it is equally easy to point to times and places when and  where great civilisations have arisen under conditions that have  concurred elsewhere with miserable stagnation in rude barbarism.    Climate is, perhaps, the factor which is most generally condescended  upon as being the chief of the causes that contribute to that  collective accomplishment which we call civilisation, but the connection  between the two things is far from clear, indeed it seems to be often  negatived by actual facts. Seeing, for instance, that the easy fruition  of desire which is possible in tropical and sub-tropical latitudes does  away with the idea of necessity as the mother of invention in those  parts of the world it becomes difficult to see how tool-using man, who  is generally supposed to have originated somewhere in the warm belts,  came to take the first and the most difficult steps in the upward  progress where there was so little, if any, incentive to that sustained  effort and concentration of the mind which is required for the thinking  out of the most difficult of all thoughts, the first principles of any  art or craft. Why, we may well ask, should the primitive African have  worried about cultivating the soil where edible roots and berries  abounded? Why should he have bothered about making fire where there was  no need of artificial warmth or for the cooking of food? Why should he  have cudgeled his brains to fashion weapons and to contrive snares for  the killing of game of which he was in no more need than his vegetarian  cousins, the anthropoid apes? Why should there have been progress where  the environment provided no stimuli therefore, in other words, why  should primitive man have moved forward where indulgent nature allowed  him to stand still?    If we believe, with Darwin and other students, that our primitive  ancestors emerged from somewhere within the warm zones, we cannot avoid  the difficulty of reconciling that supposition with the theory that  civilisation is in the first instance the result of a stimulating  environment. If on the other hand, we surmise that _homo sapiens_  originated in the colder parts of the world we still have to account for  the fact that his further progress was made not in those parts but in  warmer latitudes where a genial climate afforded no apparent provocation  for continued effort in the way of invention and general development.    It would seem that the innate tendency to conservatism latent in man,  the disposition to leave things as they are and to stick to the familiar  devil rather than fly to unknown gods, is in itself sufficient to  account for those lapses in mass-achievement and those long periods of  stagnation which mark the course of mankind everywhere. We see how Egypt  hovered for centuries on the brink of the discovery of the alphabet but  never attained thereto. The exponents of the so-called \"pulsatory  hypothesis\" can hardly claim that a change in the climate will explain  the fact seeing that the neighbouring people were able to accomplish  this great feat under very similar climatic conditions. We see how China  developed a wonderful civilisation while the Western world lay steeped  in barbarism, and then went to sleep till now. The size of that great  country made possible always the friction between people coming from  widely separated localities, which we believe to be conducive to  progress, and the climate and general environment seems to have been no  less favourable than in Europe and America. We see how the Arabs made  great conquests and enriched the world with many patient and accurate  observations and then came to a standstill and remained as they are  to-day in serene contentment, strangers to the very idea of progress."]]]
