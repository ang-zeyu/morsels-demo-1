The squire went away just at the time, and did not come  back for months afterwards, and after that he was altogether changed.  Before, he had been one of the most popular men in this part of the  country, but now he shut himself up, gave up all his acquaintances, and  never went outside the park gates except to come down to church. I  remember it gave us quite a shock when we saw him for the first  time--he seemed to have grown an old man all at once. Everyone said  that the death of his son had broken his heart.    \"And Aggie is his granddaughter! Well, well, you have astonished me.  But why did you not tell me before?\"    \"There were a good many reasons, ma'am. I thought, in the first place,  you might refuse me, if you knew, for it might do you harm. The squire  is a vindictive man, and he is landlord of your house; and if he came  to know that you had knowingly taken in his granddaughter, there was no  saying how he might have viewed it. Then, if you had known it, you  might have thought you ought to keep her in, and not let her run about  the country with your son; and altogether, it would not have been so  comfortable for you or her. I chose to put her at Sidmouth because I  wanted to come here often, to hear how the squire was going on; for if  he had been taken ill I should have told him sooner than I intended.\"    \"But why did you not tell him before?\" Mrs. Walsham asked.    \"Just selfishness, ma'am. I could not bring myself to run the risk of  having to give her up. She was mine as much as his, and was a hundred  times more to me than she could be to him. I took her a baby from her  dead mother's arms. I fed her and nursed her, taught her her first  words and her first prayer. Why should I offer to give her up to him  who, likely enough, would not accept the offer when it was made to him?  But I always intended to make it some day. It was my duty to give her  the chance at least; but I kept on putting off the day, till that  Saturday when she was so nearly drowned; then I saw my duty before me.\"    \"I had, from the first, put aside a hundred pounds, to give her more of  an education than I could do; but if it hadn't been for that fall into  the sea, it might have been years before I carried out my plan. Then I  saw it could not go on any longer. She was getting too old and too bold  to sit quiet while I was showing my box. She had had a narrow escape,  and who could say what might happen the next time she got into  mischief? Then I bethought me that the squire was growing old, and that  it was better not to put it off too long. So, ma'am, I came to you and  made up my mind to put her with you.\"    \"And you had your way,\" Mrs. Walsham said, smiling, \"though it was with  some difficulty.\"    \"I expected it would be difficult, ma'am; but I made up my mind to  that, and had you kept on refusing I should, as a last chance, have  told you whose child she was.\"    \"But why me?\" Mrs. Walsham asked. \"Why were you so particularly anxious  that she should come to me, of all people?\"    The sergeant smiled.    \"It's difficult to tell you, ma'am, but I had a reason.\"    \"But what was it?\" Mrs. Walsham persisted.    The sergeant hesitated.    \"You may think me an old fool, ma'am, but I will tell you what fancy  came into my mind. Your son saved Aggie's life. He was twelve years  old, she was five, seven years' difference.\"    \"Why, what nonsense, sergeant!\" Mrs. Walsham broke in with a laugh.  \"You don't mean to say that fancy entered your head!\"    \"It did, ma'am,\" Sergeant Wilks said gravely. \"I liked the look of the  boy much. He was brave and modest, and a gentleman. I spoke about him  to the fishermen that night, and everyone had a good word for him; so I  said to myself, 'I can't reward him for what he has done directly, but  it may be that I can indirectly.'    \"Aggie is only a child, but she has a loving, faithful little heart,  and I said to myself, 'If I throw her with this boy, who, she knows,  has saved her life, for two years, she is sure to have a strong  affection for him.'    \"Many things may happen afterwards. If the squire takes her they will  be separated. He may get to care for someone, and so may she, but it's  just giving him a chance.    \"Then, too, I thought a little about myself. I liked to fancy that,  even though she would have to go from me to the squire, my little plan  may yet turn out, and it would be I, not he, who had arranged for the  future happiness of my little darling. I shouldn't have told you all  this, ma'am; but you would have it.\"    \"I am glad you brought her to me, Sergeant Wilks, anyhow,\" Mrs. Walsham  said, \"for I love her dearly, and she has been a great pleasure to me;  but what you are talking about is simply nonsense. My son is a good  boy, and will, I hope, grow up an honourable gentleman like his father;  but he cannot look so high as the granddaughter of Squire Linthorne.\"    \"More unequal marriages have been made than that, ma'am,\" the sergeant  said sturdily; \"but we won't say more about it. I have thought it over  and over, many a hundred times, as I wheeled my box across the hills,  and it don't seem to me impossible. I will agree that the squire would  never say yes; but the squire may be in his grave years before Aggie  comes to think about marriage. Besides, it is more than likely that he  will have nothing to say to my pet. If his pride made him cast his son  off, rather than acknowledge my daughter as his, it will keep him from  acknowledging her daughter as his grandchild. I hope it will, with all  my heart; I hope so.\"    \"In that case, Sergeant Wilks,\" Mrs. Walsham said, \"let this be her  home for the time. Before you told me your story, I had made up my mind  to ask you to let her remain with me. You need feel under no  obligation, for the money you have paid me is amply sufficient to pay  for the expenses of what she eats for years. It will be a real pleasure  for me to keep her, for she has become a part of the house, and we  should miss her sorely, indeed. She is quick and intelligent, and I  will teach her all I know, and can train her up to take a situation as  a governess in a gentleman's family, or perhaps--\" and she laughed,  \"your little romance might come true some day, and she can in that case  stop in this home until James makes her another.\"    \"You are very kind, ma'am,\" the sergeant said. \"Truly kind indeed; and  I humbly accept your offer, except that so long as I live she shall be  no expense to you. I earn more than enough for my wants, and can, at  any rate, do something towards preventing her from being altogether a  burden on your hands. And now, ma'am, how would you recommend me to go  to work with the vindictive old man up at the Hall?\"    \"I shouldn't have thought he was vindictive. That is not at all the  character he bears.\"    \"No,\" the sergeant said, \"I hear him spoken well of; but I have seen,  in other cases, men, who have had the name of being pleasant and  generous, were yet tyrants and brutes in their own family. I judge him  as I found him--a hard hearted, tyrannical, vindictive father. I think  I had better not see him myself. We have never met. I have never set  eyes on him save here in church; but he regarded me as responsible for  the folly of his son. He wrote me a violent letter, and said I had  inveigled the lad into the marriage; and although I might have told him  it was false, I did not answer his letter, for the mischief was done  then, and I hoped he would cool down in time.    \"However, that is all past now; but I don't wish to see him. I was  thinking of letting the child go to the Hall by herself, and drop in  suddenly upon him. She is very like her father, and may possibly take  his heart by storm.\"    \"Yes,\" Mrs. Walsham assented. \"Now I know who she is, I can see the  likeness strongly. Yes; I should think that that would be the best way.  People often yield to a sudden impulse, who will resist if approached  formally or from a distance. But have you any reason to suppose that he  will not receive her? Did he refuse at first to undertake the charge of  the child? Does he even know that she is alive? It may be that, all  these years, he has been anxious to have her with him, and that you  have been doing him injustice altogether.\"    \"I never thought of it in that light,\" the sergeant said, after a  pause. \"He never came near his son when he lay dying, never wrote a  line in answer to his letters. If a man could not forgive his son when  he lay dying, how could he care for a grandchild he had never seen?\"    \"That may be so, Sergeant Wilks; but his son's death certainly broke  him down terribly, and it may be that he will gladly receive his  granddaughter.    \"But there are the young ones back again. I will think over what you  have been telling me, and we can discuss it again tomorrow.\"        Chapter 4: The Squire's Granddaughter.      The following day another council was held, and Mrs. Walsham told the  sergeant that, on thinking it over, she had concluded that the best way  would be to take the old butler at the Hall, who had served the family  for forty-five years, into their confidence, and to ask him to arrange  how best Aggie might be introduced to the squire.    \"I have been thinking over what you said, ma'am, and it may be that you  are right, and that I have partly misjudged the squire. I hope so, for  Aggie's sake, and yet I cannot help feeling sorry. I have always felt  almost sure he would have nothing to say to her, and I have clung to  the hope that I should not lose my little girl. I know, of course, how  much better it will be for her, and have done all I could to make her  so that she should be fit for it, if he took her. But it will be a  wrench, ma'am. I can't help feeling it will be a wrench;\" and the old  soldier's voice quivered as he spoke.    \"It cannot be otherwise,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17770"],[0,"Christmas Stories And Legends (#10)"],[1," looking  out, they saw a band of children in shining garments approaching the  house. They were playing on golden harps, and the air was full of  melody.    Suddenly the Stranger Child stood before them; no longer cold and  ragged, but clad in silvery light.    His soft voice said: \"I was cold and you took Me in. I was hungry, and  you fed Me. I was tired, and you gave Me your bed. I am the Christ  Child, wandering through the world to bring peace and happiness to all  good children. As you have given to Me, so may this tree every year  give rich fruit to you.\"    So saying, He broke a branch from the fir tree that grew near the  door, and He planted it in the ground and disappeared. But the branch  grew into a great tree, and every year it bore wonderful golden fruit  for the kind children.    [*] From \"For the Children's Hour,\" by Bailey and Lewis.

LITTLE JEAN[*]    A Christmas Story      Long ago, and far from here, in a country with a name too hard to  pronounce, there lived a little boy named Jean. In many ways, he was  just like the boys here, for there are many Johns over here, are there  not? Then too, Jean lived with his auntie, and some of our boys do  that too. His father and mother were dead, and that is true here  sometimes, isn't it? But in some ways things were quite different with  Jean. In the first place his auntie was very, very cross, and she  often made him climb up his ladder to his little garret room to go to  sleep on his pallet of straw, without any supper, save a dry crust.  His stockings had holes in the heels, and toes and knees, because his  auntie never had time to mend them, and his shoes would have been worn  out all the time if they had not been such strong wooden shoes--for in  that country the boys all wore wooden shoes. Jean did many a little  service around the place, for his auntie made him work for his daily  bread, and he chopped the wood and swept the paths and made the fires  and ran the errands, but he never heard anyone say \"Thank you.\"    Jean's happiest days were at school, and I wonder if he was like our  boys in that? There his playmates wore much better clothes and good  stockings too, and warm top coats, but they never thought of making  fun of Jean, for they all loved to play with him. One morning Jean  started off to school (which was next to the big church), and when he  got there he found the children all so happy and gay and dressed in  their best clothes, and he heard one boy say, \"Won't it be jolly  tomorrow with the big tree full of oranges and popcorn and candy, and  the candles burning?\" And another added, \"Won't it be fun to see the  things in our shoes in the morning, the goodies that boys love?\" And  another said, \"My, but we have a big, fat goose at our house, stuffed  with plums and just brown to a turn,\" and he smacked his lips as he  thought of it. And Jean began to wonder about that beautiful tree and  wish that one would grow at his house. And he thought about his wooden  shoes and knew there would be no goodies in them for him in the  morning. Then he heard one boy say, \"Don't you love Christmas?\" And  Jean said, \"Christmas! why, what is Christmas?\" But just then the  teacher came in and said, \"Boys, come into the church now and hear the  music.\" And so the boys marched one behind the other just as they do  in school here, and they went into the great church. Jean thought it  was beautiful in there! The soft light, the warm pleasant air, the  flowers, and the marble altar, and then the music! Oh, such music Jean  had never heard, and somehow as he sat on the high-backed bench and  listened, his own heart grew very warm although he could not  understand why, and he loved so to hear them singing: \"Peace on earth,  good will to men.\" And it began to sing itself over and over in his  heart, this sweet, sweet song of \"Peace on earth, good will to men.\"  Then the time came to go home, and the boys all shouted, \"Good-bye,  Jean! and Merry Christmas!\" And though Jean didn't know about \"Merry  Christmas,\" he kept singing in his little warmed heart, \"Peace on  earth, good will to men,\" and then he was glad the other boys could  have the tree and the goose and the wooden shoes full of goodies even  if he couldn't.    As Jean went home the snow began to fall and the big flakes lodged on  his shoulders and cap and hands, but he didn't mind the cold for his  heart was so warm. By and by as he ran down the street he passed a  tall house with the steps going up from the street, and there sitting  on the bottom step he saw a little boy with soft curling hair and a  beautiful face, leaning his head against the stone house, fast asleep.  Somehow as Jean looked at the sleeping face, his own heart grew still  and quiet and warm, and he felt like he could look at it forever, and  suddenly he caught himself singing softly under his breath, \"Peace on  earth, good will to men.\" And then he looked down at the little boy's  feet and he saw that he was barefooted and his little feet were purple  with the cold. As Jean looked at the feet, and then at the face of the  child, and thought of the sweet song in his heart, he said, \"Oh! I  wish I could give him my shoes, for I have stockings to keep me warm,  but auntie would be so mad! And the more he looked and thought, the  more he longed to give his shoes away, until all at once he said, \"I  know what I'll do, I'll give him one shoe and one stocking and then he  won't be so cold,\" and he felt as though he couldn't get his shoe and  stocking off fast enough to give them to the little child. So gently  and tenderly he lifted the little cold foot in his hand to put on the  shoe that he did not waken the sleeping boy, even when he had put the  stocking on the other foot, and then as he stood up again and took a  last look at the lovely face, before he knew it he was singing aloud,  \"Peace on earth, good will to men.\" Then he hopped off home in the  snow with the happiest heart he had ever had.    Now, I wish the story turned out differently and that his auntie said  when he told her about it, \"I'm so glad you did it, Jean.\" But she was  so very cross, that she slapped Jean and sent him off to bed without  any supper, saying, \"You had no right to give away that shoe and  stocking for my money paid for them!\" Somehow Jean didn't mind doing  without supper that night and he soon went fast asleep and dreamed a  beautiful dream, for he thought he was still singing \"Peace on earth,  good will to men!\" And he saw a vision of the little sleeping boy,  that grew into a tall and gentle man with a radiant face who walked to  and fro in Jean's dream, singing with him \"Peace on earth, good will  to men!\" Then morning came and outside his window, Jean heard the  voices of children singing, \"Glory to God in the highest, on earth  peace, good will to men!\" And he heard a very strange sound too, for  his auntie's voice, soft and gentle, said, \"Jean, wake up, and come  down and see what has happened,\" and Jean came down the ladder and lo!  there was a wonderful tree just like the other boys were having today,  and a goose, and by the fireplace his own wooden shoe, and beside it  the mate that he had given to the sleeping child, and far in the  distance Jean heard the children's voices singing as they ran down the  street, \"Peace, peace on earth, good will to men!\" Then the room grew  very still and peaceful and Jean's heart did too--and through the  silence there came a voice so tender and loving--so gentle that the  auntie's eyes were full of tears, and Jean wanted to listen forever,  and the voice said, \"Jean, inasmuch as ye did it unto one of the least  of these, my brethren, ye did it unto ME.\"    [*] Adapted from the French of Francois Coppee, by Nannie-Lee-Frayser.          HOW THE FIR TREE BECAME THE CHRISTMAS TREE[*]    By Aunt Hede, in \"Kindergarten Magazine\"      This is the story of how the fir tree became the Christmas tree.    At the time when the Christ Child was born all the people, the  animals, and the trees, and plants were very happy. The Child was born  to bring peace and happiness to the whole world. People came daily to  see the little One, and they always brought gifts with them.    There were three trees standing near the crypt which saw the people,  and they wished that they, too, might give presents to the Christ  Child.    The Palm said: \"I will choose my most beautiful leaf, and place it as  a fan over the Child.\"    \"And I,\" said the Olive, \"will sprinkle sweet-smelling oil upon His  head.\"    \"What can I give to the Child?\" asked the Fir, who stood near.    \"You!\" cried the others. \"You have nothing to offer Him. Your needles  would prick Him, and your tears are sticky.\"    So the poor little Fir tree was very unhappy, and it said: \"Yes, you  are right. I have nothing to offer the Christ Child.\"    Now, quite near the trees stood the Christmas Angel, who had heard all  that the trees had said. The Angel was sorry for the Fir tree who was  so lowly and without envy of the other trees. So, when it was dark,  and the stars came out, he begged a few of the little stars to come  down and rest upon the branches of the Fir tree. They did as the  Christmas Angel asked, and the Fir tree shone suddenly with a  beautiful light.    And, at that very moment, the Christ Child opened His eyes--for He had  been asleep--and as the lovely light fell upon Him He smiled.    Every year people keep the dear Christmas Child's birthday by giving  gifts to each other, and every year, in remembrance of His first  birthday, the Christmas Angel places in every house a fir tree, also.  Covered with starry candles it shines for the children as the stars  shone for the Christ Child. The Fir tree was rewarded for its  meekness, for to no other tree is it given to shine upon so many happy  faces.    [*] From \"For the Children's Hour,\" by Bailey and Lewis."]]]
