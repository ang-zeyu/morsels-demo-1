(15) Mr. Karslake also (_ibid._, p. 43) notes that the outer  entrenchment at Silchester, which is thought to be pre-Roman, does not  coincide with the south-eastern front of the Roman town-walls, as we  have all supposed, but runs as much as 300 yards outside them.      _Herefordshire_    See p. 62, below.      _Herts_    (16) Mr. Urban A. Smith, the Herts County Surveyor, submitted in 1912  to his County Council a Report on the Roman roads of the county, which  is now printed in the _Transactions of the East Herts Archaeological  Society_ (v. 117-31). It deals mainly with the surviving traces of  these roads and the question of preserving them in public use. The roads  selected as Roman are by no means all certain or probable Roman roads.  The article is furnished with a map, which however omits several names  used in the text.      _Kent_    (17) A few notes on the Roman Pharos at Dover and on some unexplained  pits near it, by Lieut. Peck, R.E., are given in the _Journal of the  British Archaeological Association_ (xx. 248 foll.).    (18) In the _Transactions of the Greenwich Antiquarian Society_ (vol. i,  parts 3, 4) Mr. J. M. Stone and Mr. J. E. de Montmorency write on the  line which the Roman road from Dover and Canterbury to London followed  near Greenwich. Its course is quite clear as far west as the outskirts  of Greenwich; thence it is doubtful all the way to London. In these  papers evidence is advanced that a piece of road was closed in the lower  part of Greenwich Park in 1434 and it is suggested that this was a bit  of the lost Roman line. If so, the road ran straight on from Shooter's  Hill, across Greenwich Park and the site of the Hospital School, towards  the mouth of Deptford Creek. It is, however, hard to see how it crossed  that obstacle, or why it should have run so near the Thames at this  point, where the shore must have been very marshy.      _Lancashire_    (19) In the _Transactions of the Lancashire and Cheshire Antiquarian  Society_ (xxxi. 69-87) Mr. W. Harrison discusses the Roman road which  runs from Ribchester to Overborough for twenty-seven lonely miles  through the hills of north-east Lancashire. He does not profess to add  to our knowledge of the line of the road; he directs attention rather  to the reasons for the course which the road pursues, its diversions  from the straight line, and its gradients. He notes also, as others  have noted, the absence of any intermediate fort half-way along the  twenty-seven miles. Probably there was such a fort; but it must have  stood in the wildest part of the road, almost in the heart of the Forest  of Bowland and perhaps somewhere in Croasdale, and it has never been  detected. The greater ease of the lowland route from Ribchester by  Lancaster to Overborough may have led to the early abandonment of  the shorter mountain track and of any post which guarded its central  portion. That, at any rate, is the suggestion which I would offer to  Lancashire antiquaries as a working hypothesis.    (20) In the same journal Mr. J. W. Jackson lists some animal remains  found among the Roman remains of Manchester (pp. 113-18).      _Lincolnshire_    (21) Samian fragments, mostly of the second century but including shape  '29', found in making new streets and sewers in Lincoln, are noted in  _Lincolnshire Notes and Queries_, xiii. 1-4.    (22) In south Lincolnshire, between Ulceby and Dexthorpe, chance  excavation has revealed tiles, potsherds, iron nails, and a few late  coins (Victorinus-Constantine junior, nob. caes.) on a site which has  previously yielded Roman scraps (_ibid._, p. 34). The tiles point to  some sort of farm or other dwelling.      _London_    (23) In his new volume _London_ (London, 1914) Sir L. Gomme continues  his efforts to prove that English London can trace direct and  uninterrupted descent from Roman Londinium. Though, he says (p. 9),  'Roman civilization certainly ceased in Britain with the Anglo-Saxon  conquest, ... amidst the wreckage London was able to continue its use  of the Roman city constitution in its new position as an English city'.  I can only record my conviction that not all his generous enthusiasm  provides proof that Roman London survived the coming of the English.  The root-error in his arguments is perhaps a failure to realize the  Roman side of the argument. He says, for instance, that, though not  a 'colonia', Londinium had the rank of 'municipium civium Romanorum'.  There is not the least reason to think that it was a 'municipium'.  So again, his references to a 'botontinus' on Hampstead Heath (p. 86),  to the 'jurisdictional terminus' of Roman London at Mile End (p. 95),  to its 'pomerium' (p. 98), its right of forming commercial alliances  with other cities, which 'lasted into the Middle Ages and is a direct  survival of the system adopted in Roman towns' (p. 101), its position  as a 'city-state' and its relation to the choice of Emperors (pp. 105,  130)--all this has nothing to do with the real Londinium; these things  did not exist in the Roman town. When Sir Laurence goes on to assert  that 'the ritual of St. Paul's down to the seventeenth century preserved  the actual rites of the worship of Diana', he again falls short of  proof. What part of the ritual and what rites of Diana?[10]    [Footnote 10: Sir Laurence alludes (p. 77) to a Caerwent inscription as  unpublished. It has probably appeared in print a dozen times; I have had  the misfortune to publish it three times over myself. Its meaning is not  quite correctly stated on p. 77.]    (24) In the December number of the _Journal of the British  Archaeological Association_ (xx. 307) Mr. F. Lambert, of the Guildhall  Museum, prints pertinent criticisms of Sir L. Gomme's volume, much  in the direction of my preceding paragraphs. He also makes useful  observations on Roman London. In particular, he attacks the difficult  problem of the date when its town-walls were built. Here he agrees with  those who ascribe them to the second century, and for two main reasons.  First, he thinks that the occurrence of early Roman potsherds at certain  points near the walls proves the town to have grown to its full extent  by about A.D. 100. Secondly, he points to the foundations of the Roman  gate at Newgate; as they are shallower than those of the adjacent  town-walls, he dates the gate after the walls and thus obtains (as  he hopes) an early date for the walls. Both points were worth raising,  but I doubt if either proves Mr. Lambert's case. For (_a_) the potsherds  come mostly from groups of rubbish-pits--such as those which Mr.  Lambert himself has lately done good work in helping to explore--and  rubbish-pits, especially in groups, lie rather outside the inhabited  areas of towns. Those of London itself suggest to me that the place had  _not_ reached its full area by A.D. 100 (see above, p. 23). (_b_) The  Newgate foundations are harder to unravel. As a rule, Roman town-gates  had large super-structures and needed stronger foundations than the  town-walls. At Newgate, where the superstructure must have been  comparatively slender, the published plans show that under a part, at  least, of the gate-towers the undisturbed subsoil rises higher than  beneath the adjacent town-walls. According to the elevation published by  Dr. Norman and Mr. F. W. Reader in _Archaeologia_ lxiii, plate lvii, the  wall-builders at this point stopped their deep foundation trenches for  the full width of the gateway (98 feet), or at least dug them shallower  there. No motive for such action could be conceived except the wish to  leave a passage for a gate. There would seem, therefore, to have been an  entrance into Roman London at Newgate as early as the building of the  walls, and there may have been such an entrance even before the erection  of these walls. Dr. Norman has, however, warned me that plate lvii goes  much beyond the actual evidence (see plate lvi); practically, we do not  know enough to form conjectures of any value on this point.    (25) In the _Journal of the Royal Institute of British Architects_ for  April 11, 1914 (xxi. 333), Mr. W. R. Davidge prints a lecture on the  Development of London which deals mostly with present and future London  but also contains a new theory as to the Roman town. Hitherto, most  writers have agreed that, while Londinium may have been laid out on a  regular town-plan, no discoverable trace of such plan survived, nor  could any existing street be said to run to any serious extent on Roman  lines. Mr. Davidge devises a rectangular plan of oblong blocks, and  finds vestiges of Roman streets in the present Cheapside, Cannon Street,  Gracechurch Street, and Birchin Lane. In a later number of the same  journal (Aug. 29, p. 52) I have given some reasons for not accepting  this view. First, Mr. Davidge's list of four survivals would be too  brief to prove much if the survivals were proved. Secondly, Roman  structural remains seem to have been found under all the streets in  question, and it is, therefore, plain that they do not run on the lines  of Roman thoroughfares. Thirdly, his suggested plan brings none of his  conjectured Roman streets (except one) to any of the various known gates  of Londinium; it requires us to assume a number of other gates for which  there is neither probability nor proof.    (26) In the Post Office Magazine, _St. Martin's-le-Grand_ (Jan. and July  1914), Mr. Thos. Wilson, then Clerk of the Works, gives details, with  illustrations, of the Roman rubbish-pits lately excavated at the General  Post Office (see above, p. 23).      _Norfolk_    (27) In the earlier pages (1-45) of his _Roman Camp at Burgh Castle_  (London, 1913) Mr. L. H. Dahl deals with the Roman fort at Burgh Castle  (Gariannonum), near Yarmouth, which formed part of the fourth-century  _Litus Saxonicum_. His account, which is not very technical, seems based  on "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19116"],[0,"How to Sing (#10)"],[1,"proceeds from one semitone to another; each is different;  each, as you go on, requires greater height, wherefore the position of  the organs cannot remain the same for several different tones. But, as  there should never be an abrupt change audible in the way of singing,  so should there never be an abrupt change felt in the sensations of  the singer's throat. Every tone must be imperceptibly prepared in an  elastic channel and must produce an easy feeling in the singer, as  well as an agreeable impression upon the listener.    The small peak indicated in the illustration is enormously extensible  and can be shifted into infinite varieties of position. However  unimportant its raising and lowering may appear, they are nevertheless  of great importance for the tone and the singer. The focal point of  the breath, that forms simultaneously the attack and the body of the  tone, by the operation of the abdominal breath pressure against the  chest, is always firmly placed on, beneath, or behind the nose.  Without body even the finest pianissimo has no significance. The very  highest unmixed head tones are an exception, and they can express  nothing. There can be no body expected in them. Their soaring quality  of sound endures no pressure, and consequently gives no expression,  which is possible only through an admixture of palatal resonance.  Their only significance is gained through their pure euphony.    All vowels, too, must keep their point of resonance uninterruptedly on  the palate. All beauty in the art of song, in cantilena as well as in  all technique, consists chiefly in uninterrupted connection between  the tone and the word, in the flexible connection of the soft palate  with the hard, in the continually elastic adjustment of the former  to the latter. This means simply the elastic form, which the breath  must fill in every corner of resonating surface without interruption,  as long as the tone lasts.    [Illustration: Red line denotes softest point on the palate.]    If the singer will control his tone,--and in practising he must always  do so,--he needs only to test it to see whether he can easily make it  softer without perceptible change in the position of the organs, and  carry it higher toward the nose and the cavities of the forehead; that  is, prepare a form for its continuation upward.    _In this way he can learn how much height a tone needs without being  too high, and how much it often lacks in height and duration to sound  high enough._    In this way remarkable faults become evident! The reason why a tone  sounds too low--the so-called transition tones from the lower to the  middle range and from this to the higher, come up for consideration  chiefly--is that the pillars of the fauces are raised too high toward  the back, preventing the head tones from sounding at the same time; or  the soft palate is lowered too far under the nose, which results in  pressing the tone too long and too far toward the teeth. This fault is  met with in very many singers, in all kinds of voices, and in almost  the same places. It comes only from an unyielding retention of the  same resonating point for several tones and a failure to bring in the  resonance of the head cavities. The \"propagation form,\" or continuing  form,[2] must always be prepared consciously, for without it artistic  singing is not to be thought of.    [Footnote 2: \"Fortpflanzungsform\": the preparation made in the vocal  organs for taking the next tone before leaving the one under  production, so that the succeeding tones shall all be of like  character and quality.]    The neglect of this most important principle usually results in  overstraining the vocal cords and throat muscles. This is followed  first by singing flat, and later by the appearance of the hideous  tremolo (see Tremolo) to which so many singers fall victims. The  cause of a tone's being too sharp is the dwelling too long on the  resonance of the head cavities, where the tone should already have  been mixed with palatal resonance. With very young voices this can  easily happen, and can also result from weariness, when the bodily  strength is not developed sufficiently to endure the fatigue of  practising. A very circumspect course must then be followed.          SECTION XVI    WHITE VOICES      There are also singers, male and female, who use too much head tone  through their entire compass; such voices are called \"white.\" Their  use of the palatal resonance being insufficient, they are not able to  make a deeper impression, because their power of expression is  practically nothing. Frau Wedekind and Madame Melba are instances of  this. In such cases it would be advisable to raise the pillars of the  fauces a little higher, and place the larynx somewhat lower, and to  mingle judiciously with all the other vowels, the vowel sound _oo_,  that requires a lower position of the larynx. The voices would become  warmer and would sound more expressive. As soon as the singer is able  to create easily and inaudibly on every tone the correct propagation  form for the next tone, all questions as to register must disappear.  He must not, however, be drilled on _registers_; several tones must  not be forced on one and the same point. Every tone should be put  naturally into its own place; should receive the pitch, duration, and  strength it needs for its perfection. And one master rules it  all,--the ear!    The goal is, unfortunately, so seldom reached because it can be  reached only through the moderation that comes from mastery; and,  alas! only true masters practise it.    It may be accepted as true that the lower ranges of the voice have the  greatest strength, the middle ranges the greatest power of expression,  the higher the greatest carrying power.    The best mixture--all three together--may be developed to the highest  art by the skill of the individual, often, indeed, only by a good ear  for it. Whenever expression of the word's significance, beauty of the  vocal material, and perfection of phrasing are found united in the  highest degree, it is due either to knowledge or to a natural skill in  the innumerable ways of fitting the sung word to the particular  resonance--connections that are suitable to realize its significance,  and hence its spirit. They are brought out by a stronger inclination  toward one or the other of the resonance surfaces, without, however,  injuring the connection or the beauty of the musical phrase. Here  aesthetic feeling plays the chief part, for whatever may be its power  and its truthfulness, the result must always be beautiful,--that is,  restrained within proper limits.    This law, too, remains the same for all voices. It is a question of  the entire compass of a voice trained for artistic singing, one that  is intrusted with the greatest of tasks, to interpret works of art  that are no popular songs, but, for the most part, human tragedies.  Most male singers--tenors especially--consider it beneath them,  generally, indeed, unnatural or ridiculous, to use the falsetto,  which is a part of all male voices, as the head tones are a part of  all female voices. They do not understand how to make use of its  assistance, because they often have no idea of its existence, or know  it only in its unmixed purity--that is, its thinnest quality. Of its  proper application they have not the remotest conception. Their  singing is generally in accordance with their ignorance.    The mixture is present by nature in all kinds of voices, but singers  must possess the skill and knowledge to employ it, else the natural  advantage goes for nothing.          SECTION XVII    THEODOR WACHTEL      The most perfect singer that I remember in my Berlin experience was  Theodor Wachtel in this respect, that with his voice of rare splendor,  he united all that vocal art which, as it seems, is destined quite to  disappear from among us. How beautiful were his coloratura, his  trills,--simply flawless! Phrasing, force, fulness of tone, and beauty  were perfect, musically without a blemish. If he did not go outside  the range of Arnold, G. Brown, Stradella, Vasco, the Postillion and  Lionel, it was probably because he felt that he was not equal to  interpreting the Wagnerian spirit. In this he was very wise. As one of  the first of vocal artists, whose voice was superbly trained and was  preserved to the end of his life, I have had to pay to Wachtel the  tribute of the most complete admiration and recognition, in contrast  to many others who thought themselves greater than he, and yet were  not worthy to unloose the latchet of his shoes.    Recently the little Italian tenor Bonci has won my hearty admiration  for his splendidly equalized voice, his perfect art, and his knowledge  of his resources; and notwithstanding the almost ludicrous figure that  he cut in serious parts, he elicited hearty applause. Cannot German  tenors, too, learn to sing _well_, even if they do interpret Wagner?  Will they not learn, for the sake of this very master, that it is  their duty not to use their voices recklessly?    Is it not disrespectful toward our greatest masters that they always  have to play hide and seek with the _bel canto_, the trill, and  coloratura? Not till one has fully realized the difficulties of the  art of song, does it really become of value and significance. Not till  then are one's eyes opened to the duty owed not only to one's self  but to the public.    The appreciation of a difficulty makes study doubly attractive; the  laborious ascent of a summit which no one can contest, is the  attainment of a goal.    Voices in which the palatal resonance--and so, power--is the  predominating factor, are the hardest to manage and to preserve. They  are generally called chest voices. Uncommon power and fulness of tone  in the middle ranges are extremely seductive. Only rarely are people  found with sense enough to renounce such an excess of fulness in favor  of the head"]]]
