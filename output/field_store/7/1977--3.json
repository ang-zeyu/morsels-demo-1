Let neither think that anything short of genuine  love, extreme patience, true humility, consummate tact, sound initiative,  mature wisdom, and deliberate, persistent, and prayerful effort, can  succeed in blotting out the stain which this patent evil has left on the  fair name of their common country. Let them rather believe, and be firmly  convinced, that on their mutual understanding, their amity, and sustained  cooperation, must depend, more than on any other force or organization  operating outside the circle of their Faith, the deflection of that  dangerous course so greatly feared by 'Abdu'l-Baha, and the  materialization of the hopes He cherished for their joint contribution to  the fulfillment of that country's glorious destiny.    Dearly beloved friends! A rectitude of conduct which, in all its  manifestations, offers a striking contrast to the deceitfulness and  corruption that characterize the political life of the nation and of the  parties and factions that compose it; a holiness and chastity that are  diametrically opposed to the moral laxity and licentiousness which defile  the character of a not inconsiderable proportion of its citizens; an  interracial fellowship completely purged from the curse of racial  prejudice which stigmatizes the vast majority of its people--these are the  weapons which the American believers can and must wield in their double  crusade, first to regenerate the inward life of their own community, and  next to assail the long-standing evils that have entrenched themselves in  the life of their nation. The perfection of such weapons, the wise and  effective utilization of every one of them, more than the furtherance of  any particular plan, or the devising of any special scheme, or the  accumulation of any amount of material resources, can prepare them for the  time when the Hand of Destiny will have directed them to assist in  creating and in bringing into operation that World Order which is now  incubating within the worldwide administrative institutions of their  Faith.    In the conduct of this twofold crusade the valiant warriors struggling in  the name and for the Cause of Baha'u'llah must, of necessity, encounter  stiff resistance, and suffer many a setback. Their own instincts, no less  than the fury of conservative forces, the opposition of vested interests,  and the objections of a corrupt and pleasure-seeking generation, must be  reckoned with, resolutely resisted, and completely overcome. As their  defensive measures for the impending struggle are organized and extended,  storms of abuse and ridicule, and campaigns of condemnation and  misrepresentation, may be unloosed against them. Their Faith, they may  soon find, has been assaulted, their motives misconstrued, their aims  defamed, their aspirations derided, their institutions scorned, their  influence belittled, their authority undermined, and their Cause, at  times, deserted by a few who will either be incapable of appreciating the  nature of their ideals, or unwilling to bear the brunt of the mounting  criticisms which such a contest is sure to involve. \"Because of  'Abdu'l-Baha,\" the beloved Master has prophesied, \"many a test will be  visited upon you. Troubles will befall you, and suffering afflict you.\"    Let not, however, the invincible army of Baha'u'llah, who in the West, and  at one of its potential storm centers is to fight, in His name and for His  sake, one of its fiercest and most glorious battles, be afraid of any  criticism that might be directed against it. Let it not be deterred by any  condemnation with which the tongue of the slanderer may seek to debase its  motives. Let it not recoil before the threatening advance of the forces of  fanaticism, of orthodoxy, of corruption, and of prejudice that may be  leagued against it. The voice of criticism is a voice that indirectly  reinforces the proclamation of its Cause. Unpopularity but serves to throw  into greater relief the contrast between it and its adversaries, while  ostracism is itself the magnetic power that must eventually win over to  its camp the most vociferous and inveterate amongst its foes. Already in  the land where the greatest battles of the Faith have been fought, and its  most rapacious enemies have lived, the march of events, the slow yet  steady infiltration of its ideals, and the fulfillment of its prophecies,  have resulted not only in disarming and in transforming the character of  some of its most redoubtable enemies, but also in securing their firm and  unreserved allegiance to its Founders. So complete a transformation, so  startling a reversal of attitude, can only be effected if that chosen  vehicle which is designed to carry the Message of Baha'u'llah to the  hungry, the restless, and unshepherded multitudes is itself thoroughly  cleansed from the defilements which it seeks to remove.    It is upon you, therefore, my best-beloved friends, that I wish to impress  not only the urgency and imperative necessity of your holy task, but also  the limitless possibilities which it possesses of raising to such an  exalted level not only the life and activities of your own community, but  the motives and standards that govern the relationships existing among the  people to which you belong. Undismayed by the formidable nature of this  task, you will, I am confident, meet as befits you the challenge of these  times, so fraught with peril, so full of corruption, and yet so pregnant  with the promise of a future so bright that no previous age in the annals  of mankind can rival its glory.            \"DEARLY BELOVED FRIENDS! I HAVE ATTEMPTED, IN THE BEGINNING ...\"      Dearly beloved friends! I have attempted, in the beginning of these pages,  to convey an idea of the glorious opportunities as well as the tremendous  responsibilities which, as a result of the persecution of the far-flung  Faith of Baha'u'llah, now face the community of the American believers, at  so critical a stage in the Formative Period of their Faith, and in so  crucial an epoch in the world's history. I have dwelt sufficiently upon  the character of the mission which in a not too distant future that  community must, through the impelling force of circumstances, arise and  carry out. I have uttered the warning which I felt would be necessary to a  clearer understanding, and a better discharge, of the tasks lying ahead of  it. I have set forth, and stressed as far as it was in my power, those  exalted and dynamic virtues, those lofty standards, which, difficult as  they are to attain, constitute nonetheless the essential requirements for  the success of those tasks. A word, I believe, should now be said in  connection with the material aspect of their immediate task, upon the  termination of which, at its appointed time, must depend not only the  unfoldment of the subsequent stages in the Divine Plan envisaged by  'Abdu'l-Baha, but also the acquisition of those capacities which will  qualify them to discharge, in the fullness of time, the duties and  responsibilities demanded by that greater mission which it is their  privilege to perform.    The Seven Year Plan, with its twofold aspects of Temple ornamentation and  extension of teaching activity, embracing both the Northern and Southern  American continents, is now well advanced into its second year, and offers  to anyone who has observed its progress in recent months signs that are  extremely heartening and which augur well for the attainment of its  objectives within the allotted time. The successive steps designed to  facilitate, and covering the entire field of, the work to be achieved in  connection with the exterior ornamentation of the Temple have for the most  part been taken. The final phase which is to mark the triumphant  conclusion of a thirty-year old enterprise has at long last been entered.  The initial contract connected with the first and main story of that  historic edifice has been signed. The Fund associated with the beloved  name of the Greatest Holy Leaf has been launched. The uninterrupted  continuation to its very end of so laudable an enterprise is now assured.  The poignant memories of one whose heart so greatly rejoiced at the  rearing of the superstructure of this sacred House will so energize the  final exertions required to complete it as to dissipate any doubt that may  yet linger in any mind as to the capacity of its builders to worthily  consummate their task.    The teaching aspect of the Plan must now be pondered. Its challenge must  be met, and its requirements studied, weighed, and fulfilled. Superb and  irresistible as is the beauty of the first Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar of the  West, majestic as are its dimensions, unique as is its architecture, and  priceless as are the ideals and the aspirations which it symbolizes, it  should be regarded, at the present time, as no more than an instrument for  a more effective propagation of the Cause and a wider diffusion of its  teachings. In this respect it should be viewed in the same light as the  administrative institutions of the Faith which are designed as vehicles  for the proper dissemination of its ideals, its tenets, and its verities.    It is, therefore, to the teaching requirements of the Seven Year Plan that  the community of the American believers must henceforth direct their  careful and sustained attention. The entire community must, as one man,  arise to fulfill them. To teach the Cause of God, to proclaim its truths,  to defend its interests, to demonstrate, by words as well as by deeds, its  indispensability, its potency, and universality, should at no time be  regarded as the exclusive concern or sole privilege of Baha'i  administrative institutions, be they Assemblies, or committees. All must  participate, however humble their origin, however limited their  experience, however restricted their means, however deficient"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19250"],[0,"`Abdu'l-Bahá in London (#10)"],[1,"ck, crippled and poorly nourished  children. Mothers carrying their little ones followed him, and a friend  explained that this great visitor had come over the seas from the Holy  Land where Jesus was born.    All day long people of every condition gathered about the gate for a  chance of seeing him, and more than sixty drove or cycled to Vanners to  see him, many wishing to question him on some special subject. Among them  were the clergy of several denominations, a head master of a boys' public  school, a member of Parliament, a doctor, a famous political writer, the  vice-chancellor of a University, several journalists, a well known poet,  and a magistrate from London.    He will long be remembered as he sat in the bow window in the afternoon  sunshine, his arm round a very ragged but very happy little boy, who had  come to ask 'Abdu'l-Baha for sixpence for his money box and for his  invalid mother, whilst round him in the room were gathered men and women  discussing Education, Socialism, the first Reform Bill, and the relation  of submarines and wireless telegraphy to the new era on which man is  entering.    During the evening a young betrothed couple in the village, who had read  some of the Baha'i books, begged permission to come to him. They entered  shyly, the man, led by the girl. 'Abdu'l-Baha rose to greet them, and made  them take a place in the circle. He talked earnestly to them upon the  sacredness of marriage, the beauty of a real union, and the importance of  the little child and its education. Before they left he blessed them, and  touched their hair and foreheads with a Persian perfume.            EDUCATION      'Abdu'l-Baha laid great stress on Education. He said \"The girl's education  is of more importance today than the boy's, for she is the mother of the  future race. It is the duty of all to look after the children. Those  without children should, if possible, make themselves responsible for the  education of a child.\"    The condition of the destitute in the country villages as well as in  London impressed 'Abdu'l-Baha greatly. In an earnest talk with the Rector  of a Parish, 'Abdu'l-Baha said: \"I find England awake; there is spiritual  life here. But your poor are so very poor! This should not be. On the one  hand you have wealth, and great luxury; on the other hand men and women  are living in the extremities of hunger and want. This great contrast of  life is one of the blots on the civilization of this enlightened age.    \"You must turn attention more earnestly to the betterment of the  conditions of the poor. Do not be satisfied until each one with whom you  are concerned is to you as a member of your family. Regard each one either  as a father, or as a brother, or as a sister, or as a mother, or as a  child. If you can attain to this, your difficulties will vanish, you will  know what to do. This is the teaching of Baha'u'llah.\"            THE CHANGE OF HEART      To one who spoke of the people's desire to possess the land, and of the  strong under-current of rebellion on the part of the labouring classes,  'Abdu'l-Baha said: \"Fighting, and the employment of force, even for the  right cause, will not bring about good results. The oppressed who have  right on their side, must not take that right by force; the evil would  continue. Hearts must be changed. The rich must wish to give! Life in man  should be like a flame, warming all with whom it comes into contact. The  spiritually awakened are like to bright torches in the sight of God, they  give light and comfort to their fellows.\"    When asked if he did not find the manners of the English rude and awkward,  compared with those of the East, 'Abdu'l-Baha said he had not felt this.  As a nation increases in spirituality, the the manners become different.            CHRIST AND BAHA'U'LLAH      A friend asked how the teachings of Baha'u'llah contrasted with the  teachings of Jesus Christ. \"The teachings are the same.\" declared  'Abdu'l-Baha; \"It is the same foundation and the same temple. Truth is  one, and without division. The teachings of Jesus are in a concentrated  form. Men do not agree to this day as to the meaning of many of His  sayings. His teachings are as a flower in the bud. Today, the bud is  unfolding into a flower! Baha'u'llah has expanded and fulfilled the  teachings, and has applied them in detail to the whole world.    \"There are no solitaries and no hermits among the Baha'is. Man must work  with his fellows. Everyone should have some trade, or art or profession,  be he rich or poor, and with this he must serve humanity. This service is  acceptable as the highest form of worship.\"            ART      A painter asked: \"Is art a worthy vocation?\" 'Abdu'l-Baha turning to her  impressively, said: \"Art is worship.\"    An actor mentioned the drama, and its influence. \"The drama is of the  utmost importance.\" said 'Abdu'l-Baha. \"It has been a great educational  power in the past; it will be so again.\" He described how as a young boy  he witnessed the Mystery Play of 'Ali's Betrayal and Passion, and how it  affected him so deeply that he wept and could not sleep for many nights.            SYMBOLS      Someone wished to know if it were a good custom to wear a symbol, as, for  instance, a cross. He said: \"You wear the cross for remembrance, it  concentrates your thoughts; it has no magical power. Baha'is often wear a  stone with the greatest name engraved on it: there is no magical influence  in the stone; it is a reminder, and companion. If you are about to do some  selfish or hasty action, and your glance falls on the ring on your hand,  you will remember and change your intention.\"            ESPERANTO      A friend enquired concerning Baha'u'llah's prophecy in the Words of  Paradise, that a universal language would be formed, and desired to know  if Esperanto would be the language chosen.    \"The love and effort put into Esperanto will not be lost,\" he answered,  \"but no one person can construct a Universal Language. It must be made by  a Council representing all countries, and must contain words from  different languages. It will be governed by the simplest rules, and there  will be no exceptions; neither will there be gender, nor extra and silent  letters. Everything indicated will have but one name. In Arabic there are  hundreds of names for the camel! In the schools of each nation the mother  tongue will be taught, as well as the revised Universal Language.\"            TOLSTOY      The same questioner said: \"I have read much of Tolstoy and I see a  parallel between his teachings and yours. In one of his books he speaks of  the Enigma of Life, and describes how life is wasted in our endeavour to  find the Key. But Tolstoy goes on to say: 'There is a man in Persia who  holds the secret.'\"    \"Yes,\" said 'Abdu'l-Baha, \"I received a letter from Tolstoy, and in it he  said that he wished to write a book upon Baha'u'llah.\"            HEALING      A friend interested in healing quoted the words of Baha'u'llah: \"If one is  sick, let him go to the greatest physician.\"    'Abdu'l-Baha said: \"There is but one power which heals--that is God. The  state or condition through which the healing takes place is the confidence  of the heart. By some this state is reached through pills, powders, and  physicians. By others through hygiene, fasting, and prayer. By others  through direct perception.\"    On another occasion 'Abdu'l-Baha said with regard to the same subject,  \"All that we see around us is the work of mind. It is mind in the herb and  in the mineral that acts on the human body, and changes its condition.\"  The talk developed into a learned dissertation on the Philosophy of  Aristotle.            DEATH      A friend asked: \"How should one look forward to death?\"    'Abdu'l-Baha answered: \"How does one look forward to the goal of any  journey? With hope and with expectation. It is even so with the end of  this earthly journey. In the next world, man will find himself freed from  many of the disabilities under which he now suffers. Those who have passed  on through death, have a sphere of their own. It is not removed from ours;  their work, the work of the Kingdom, is ours; but it is sanctified from  what we call 'time and place.' Time with us is measured by the sun. When  there is no more sunrise, and no more sunset, that kind of time does not  exist for man. Those who have ascended have different attributes from  those who are still on earth, yet there is no real separation.    \"In prayer there is a mingling of station, a mingling of condition. Pray  for them as they pray for you! When you do not know it, and are in a  receptive attitude, they are able to make suggestions to you, if you are  in difficulty. This sometimes happens in sleep, but there is no phenomenal  intercourse! That which seems like phenomenal intercourse has another  explanation.\" The questioner exclaimed; \"But I have heard a voice!\"  'Abdu'l-Baha said: \"Yes, that is possible; we hear voices clearly in  dreams. It is not with the physical ear that you heard; the spirit of  those that have passed on are freed from sense-life, and do not use  physical means. It is not possible to put these great matters into human  words; the language of man is the language of children, and man's  explanation often leads astray.\"    Someone present asked how it was that in prayer and meditation the heart  often turns with instinctive appeal to some friend who has passed into the  next life.    'Abdu'l-Baha answered: \"It is a law of God's creation that the weak should  lean upon the strong. Those to whom you turn may be the mediators of God's  power to you, even as when on earth. But it is the One Holy Spirit that  strengthens all men.\" Hereupon another friend referred to the communing of  Jesus on the Mount of Transfiguration with Moses and Elijah; and  'Abdu'l-Baha said: \"The faithful are ever sustained by the presence of the  Supreme Concourse. In the Supreme Concourse"]]]
