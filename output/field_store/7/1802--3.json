By frequent repetitions these motions acquire associations, which  continue during our lives, and even after the destruction of the greatest  part of the sensorium; for the heart of a viper or frog will continue to  pulsate long after it is taken from the body; and when it has entirely  ceased to move, if any part of it is goaded with a pin, the whole heart  will again renew its pulsations. This kind of connection we shall term  irritative association, to distinguish it from sensitive and voluntary  associations.    2. In like manner many of our ideas are originally excited in tribes; as  all the objects of sight, after we become so well acquainted with the laws  of vision, as to distinguish figure and distance as well as colour; or in  trains, as while we pass along the objects that surround us. The tribes  thus received by irritation become associated by habit, and have been  termed complex ideas by the writers of metaphysics, as this book, or that  orange. The trains have received no particular name, but these are alike  associations of ideas, and frequently continue during our lives. So the  taste of a pine-apple, though we eat it blindfold, recalls the colour and  shape of it; and we can scarcely think on solidity without figure.    II. 1. By the various efforts of our sensations to acquire or avoid their  objects, many muscles are daily brought into successive or synchronous  actions; these become associated by habit, and are then excited together  with great facility, and in many instances gain indissoluble connections.  So the play of puppies and kittens is a representation of their mode of  fighting or of taking their prey; and the motions of the muscles necessary  for those purposes become associated by habit, and gain a great adroitness  of action by these early repetitions: so the motions of the abdominal  muscles, which were originally brought into concurrent action, with the  protrusive motion of the rectum or bladder by sensation, become so  conjoined with them by habit, that they not only easily obey these  sensations occasioned by the stimulus of the excrement and urine, but are  brought into violent and unrestrainable action in the strangury and  tenesmus. This kind of connection we shall term sensitive association.    2. So many of our ideas, that have been excited together or in succession  by our sensations, gain synchronous or successive associations, that are  sometimes indissoluble but with life. Hence the idea of an inhuman or  dishonourable action perpetually calls up before us the idea of the wretch  that was guilty of it. And hence those unconquerable antipathies are  formed, which some people have to the sight of peculiar kinds of food, of  which in their infancy they have eaten to excess or by constraint.    III. 1. In learning any mechanic art, as music, dancing, or the use of the  sword, we teach many of our muscles to act together or in succession by  repeated voluntary efforts; which by habit become formed into tribes or  trains of association, and serve all our purposes with great facility, and  in some instances acquire an indissoluble union. These motions are  gradually formed into a habit of acting together by a multitude of  repetitions, whilst they are yet separately causable by the will, as is  evident from the long time that is taken up by children in learning to walk  and to speak; and is experienced by every one, when he first attempts to  skate upon the ice or to swim: these we shall term voluntary associations.    2. All these muscular movements, when they are thus associated into tribes  or trains, become afterwards not only obedient to volition, but to the  sensations and irritations; and the same movement composes a part of many  different tribes or trains of motion. Thus a single muscle, when it acts in  consort with its neighbours on one side, assists to move the limb in one  direction; and in another, when, it acts with those in its neighbourhood on  the other side; and in other directions, when it acts separately or jointly  with those that lie immediately under or above it; and all these with equal  facility after their associations have been well established.    The facility, with which each muscle changes from one associated tribe to  another, and that either backwards or forwards, is well observable in the  muscles of the arm in moving the windlass of an air-pump; and the slowness  of those muscular movements, that have not been associated by habit, may be  experienced by any one, who shall attempt to saw the air quick  perpendicularly with one hand, and horizontally with the other at the same  time.    3. In learning every kind of science we voluntarily associate many tribes  and trains of ideas, which afterwards are ready for all the purposes either  of volition, sensation, or irritation; and in some instances acquire  indissoluble habits of acting together, so as to affect our reasoning, and  influence our actions. Hence the necessity of a good education.    These associate ideas are gradually formed into habits of acting together  by frequent repetition, while they are yet separately obedient to the will;  as is evident from the difficulty we experience in gaining so exact an idea  of the front of St. Paul's church, as to be able to delineate it with  accuracy, or in recollecting a poem of a few pages.    And these ideas, thus associated into tribes, not only make up the parts of  the trains of volition, sensation, and irritation; but the same idea  composes a part of many different tribes and trains of ideas. So the simple  idea of whiteness composes a part of the complex idea of snow, milk, ivory;  and the complex idea of the letter A composes a part of the several  associated trains of ideas that make up the variety of words, in which this  letter enters.    The numerous trains of these associated ideas are divided by Mr. Hume into  three classes, which he has termed contiguity, causation, and resemblance.  Nor should we wonder to find them thus connected together, since it is the  business of our lives to dispose them into those three classes; and we  become valuable to ourselves and our friends, as we succeed in it. Those  who have combined an extensive class of ideas by the contiguity of time or  place, are men learned in the history of mankind, and of the sciences they  have cultivated. Those who have connected a great class of ideas of  resemblances, possess the source of the ornaments of poetry and oratory,  and of all rational analogy. While those who have connected great classes  of ideas of causation, are furnished with the powers of producing effects.  These are the men of active wisdom, who lead armies to victory, and  kingdoms to prosperity; or discover and improve the sciences, which  meliorate and adorn the condition of humanity.           *       *       *       *       *    SECT. XI.    ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE SENSORIAL POWERS.        I. _Stimulation is of various kinds adapted to the organs of sense, to      the muscles, to hollow membranes, and glands. Some objects irritate our      senses by repeated impulses._ II. 1. _Sensation and volition frequently      affect the whole sensorium._ 2. _Emotions, passions, appetites._ 3.      _Origin of desire and aversion. Criterion of voluntary actions,      difference of brutes and men._ 4. _Sensibility and voluntarity._ III.      _Associations formed before nativity, irritative motions mistaken for      officiated ones._    _Irritation._    I. The various organs of sense require various kinds of stimulation to  excite them into action; the particles of light penetrate the cornea and  humours of the eye, and then irritate the naked retina; rapid particles,  dissolved or diffused in water or saliva, and odorous ones, mixed or  combined with the air, irritate the extremities of the nerves of taste and  smell; which either penetrate, or are expanded on the membranes of the  tongue and nostrils; the auditory nerves are stimulated by the vibrations  of the atmosphere communicated by means of the tympanum and of the fluid,  whether of air or of water, behind it; and the nerves of touch by the  hardness of surrounding bodies, though the cuticle is interposed between  these bodies and the medulla of the nerve.    As the nerves of the senses have each their appropriated objects, which  stimulate them into activity; so the muscular fibres, which are the  terminations of other sets of nerves, have their peculiar objects, which  excite them into action; the longitudinal muscles are stimulated into  contraction by extension, whence the stretching or pandiculation after a  long continued posture, during which they have been kept in a state of  extension; and the hollow muscles are excited into action by distention, as  those of the rectum and bladder are induced to protrude their contents from  their sense of the distention rather than of the acrimony of those  contents.    There are other objects adapted to stimulate the nerves, which terminate in  variety of membranes, and those especially which form the terminations of  canals; thus the preparations of mercury particularly affect the salivary  glands, ipecacuanha the stomach, aloe the sphincter of the anus,  cantharides that of the bladder, and lastly every gland of the body appears  to be indued with a kind of taste, by which it selects or forms each its  peculiar fluid from the blood; and by which it is irritated into activity.    Many of these external properties of bodies, which stimulate our organs of  sense, do not seem to effect this by a single impulse, but by repeated  impulses; as the nerve of the ear is probably not excitable by a single  vibration of air, nor the optic nerve by a single particle of light; which  circumstance produces some analogy between those two senses, at the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15709"],[0,"The Christmas Angel (#10)"],[1,"\"His face shines like the  Baby's that I saw once in the Church.
