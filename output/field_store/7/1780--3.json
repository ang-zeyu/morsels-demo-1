Then he thought of a plan. \"I'll give a  big run and a long jump and maybe I can jump over the auto, and then the  auto will bump into the dog, and I will be safe!\" he cried.    So he took a long run, and just as the auto was going to hit him, Uncle  Wiggily gave a big jump, right up into the air. He didn't jump quite  quickly enough, however, for one of the big rubber tires ran over his toe,  but he wasn't much hurt. And what do you think he did? Why, he landed  right in the auto, on the seat beside a little boy.    And that dog was so frightened of the automobile that he howled and  yowled, and his teeth chattered, and he tucked his tail between his legs,  and ran home.    \"Oh, the bunny! The bunny!\" cried the little boy, as he saw Uncle Wiggly.  \"May we keep him, papa?\"    \"I guess so,\" said the boy's papa. \"Anyhow his foot is hurt, and we'll  take care of him until it gets well. My, but he is a good jumper, though!\"    So the man stopped the auto, and picked up Uncle Wiggily's crutch and  valise, which the old gentleman rabbit had dropped when he jumped upon the  seat beside the boy, and then the car went on. And Uncle Wiggily wasn't a  bit frightened at being in an auto, for he knew the boy and man would be  kind to him.    \"Perhaps I shall find my fortune now,\" the rabbit gentleman said. And the  little boy patted him on the back, and stroked his long ears.    Now, in the story after this I'll tell you what happened to Uncle Wiggily  at the little boy's house, and in case our door key doesn't get locked  out, and have to sleep in the park, you are going to hear about Uncle  Wiggily in a boat.          STORY XIV    UNCLE WIGGILY IN A BOAT      \"Poor rabbit!\" exclaimed the little boy in the automobile, as he rubbed  Uncle Wiggily's ears. \"I wonder if his foot is much hurt, papa?\"    \"I don't know,\" answered the man, as he steered the machine down the road.  \"I'll have the doctor look at it.\"    \"Oh, indeed, it isn't hurt much,\" spoke up Uncle Wiggily. \"The rubber tire  was soft, you see. But my rheumatism is much worse on account of running  so fast.\"    \"What's this? Well, of all things! This rabbit can talk!\" cried the man in  surprise.    \"Of course he can, papa,\" said the boy. \"Lots of rabbits can talk. Why,  there's Sammie and Susie Littletail; they can talk, and maybe this rabbit  knows them.\"    \"I'm their uncle,\" said the old gentleman rabbit, making a bow.    \"Oh, then, you must be Uncle Wiggily Longears!\" cried the little boy.  \"Oh, I've always wanted to see you, and now I can!\"    \"Well, it is very strange to meet you this way,\" said the man. \"Still, I  am glad you are not hurt, Uncle Wiggily. And so you are out seeking your  fortune,\" for the rabbit had told them about his travels. \"Perhaps you  would like to rest at our house for a few days. We can give you a nice  room, with a brass bed, and a bath-tub to yourself, and you can have your  meals in bed, if you can't come down stairs.\"    \"Oh, I am not used to that kind of a life,\" said the old gentleman rabbit.  \"I would rather live out of doors. If you can get me some clean straw to  lie on, and once in a while a carrot or a turnip, and a bit of lettuce and  some cabbage leaves now and then, I'll be all right. And as soon as my  foot is well I'll travel on.\"    \"Oh, what good times we'll have!\" cried the little boy. \"Our house is near  a lake, and I have a motor boat. And I'll give you a ride in it.\"    Well, Uncle Wiggily thought that would be nice, and he was rather glad,  after all, that he had jumped into the auto. So pretty soon they came to  the place where the boy lived. Oh, it was a fine, large house, with lots  of grounds, lawns and gardens all around it. And there were several dogs  on the place, but the little boy spoke to them all, telling them that the  rabbit was his friend Uncle Wiggily, who must not be bitten or barked at  on any account.    \"Oh, we heard about him from Fido Flip-Flop,\" said big dog Rover. \"We  wouldn't hurt Uncle Wiggily for two worlds, and part of another one, and a  bag of peanuts.\"    So Uncle Wiggily was given a nice bed of straw in one of the empty  dog-houses, and the boy got him some cabbage and lettuce, and the rabbit  made himself a sandwich of them, with some bread and butter which he had  in his satchel.    Then the rabbit and the dogs talked together, and the rabbit told of his  travels, and what had happened to him so far.    \"Wonderful! Wonderful!\" exclaimed the old dog Rover. \"You should write a  book about your fortune.\"    \"I haven't found it yet, but perhaps I may, and then I'll write the book,\"  said Uncle Wiggily, combing out his whiskers.    That night the boy put a soft rag and some salve on the rabbit's sore  foot, and he also gave him some liniment for his rheumatism, and in the  morning Uncle Wiggily was much better. He and the boy and the dogs had  lots of fun playing together on the smooth, green, grassy lawn. They  played tag, and hide-and-go-seek, and a new game called \"Don't Let the  Ragman Take Your Rubber Boots.\" And the dog Rover pretended he was the  ragman.    \"Now, then, we'll all go out in my motor boat,\" said the boy, so he and  Uncle Wiggily and the dogs went down to the lake and, surely enough, there  was the boat, the nicest one you could wish for. There was a little cabin  in it, and seats out on deck, and a little engine that went \"choo-choo!\"  and pushed the boat through the water.    In the boat they all had a fine ride around the lake, which was almost  like the one where you go to a Sunday-school picnic, and then it was time  for dinner. And, as a special treat, when they got on shore, Uncle Wiggily  was given carrot ice cream, with chopped-up turnips in it. And oh, how  good it was to him!    Well, the days passed, and Uncle Wiggily was getting so he could walk  along pretty well, for his foot was all cured, and he began to think of  going on once more to seek his fortune. And then something happened. One  day the boy went out alone in a rowboat to see if he could find any fish.  And before he knew it his boat had tipped over, spilling him out into the  water, and he couldn't swim. Wasn't that dreadful?    \"Oh! Help! Help!\" he cried, as the water came up to his chin.    My, but it's awful to be tipped over in a boat! and I and I hope if you  can't swim you'll never go out in one alone. And there was that poor boy  splashing around in the water, and almost drowned.    \"Save me! Save me!\" the boy cried. \"Oh, save me!\"    Well, as it happened, Uncle Wiggily was walking along the shore of the  lake just then. He saw the little boy fall out of the boat, and he heard  him cry.    \"I'll save you if I can!\" exclaimed the brave old rabbit. \"Come on, Rover,  we'll go out in the motor boat and rescue him.\"    \"Bow-wow! Bow-wow! Sure! Sure!\" cried Cover, wagging his tail.    So he and Uncle Wiggily ran down, and jumped into the motor boat. And they  knew just how to start the engine and run it, for the boy had showed them.    \"Bang-bang!\" went the engine. \"Whizz-whizz!\" went the boat through the  water.    \"Faster! Faster!\" cried Uncle Wiggily, who was steering the boat, while  Rover ran the engine. \"Go faster!\"    So Rover made it go as fast as he could, and then all of a sudden that boy  went down under the water, out of sight.    \"Oh, he's drowned!\" cried Uncle Wiggily sorrowfully.    But he wasn't, I'm glad to say. Just then along came Nurse Jane  Fuzzy-Wuzzy, the muskrat, swimming. And she dived away down under and  helped bring that boy up to the top of the water, and then Uncle Wiggily  and Cover grabbed him as the muskrat lifted him up, and they pulled him  into the motor boat, and so saved his life. And oh! how thankful he was  when he was safe on shore, and he was careful never to fall in the water  again.    Now, in case the clothes wringer doesn't squeeze all the juice out of my  breakfast orange, I'll tell you in the next story about Uncle Wiggily  making a cherry pie.          STORY XV    UNCLE WIGGILY MAKES A PIE      Do you remember the little boy whom Uncle Wiggily helped save after he  fell out of the boat? Well, that boy's papa was so glad because Uncle  Wiggily had helped save the little chap from drowning that he couldn't do  enough for the old gentleman rabbit.    \"You can stay here forever, and have carrot ice cream every day if you  like,\" the man said.    \"Oh, thank you very much, but I think I'll travel on,\" replied Uncle  Wiggily. \"I have still to seek my fortune.\"    \"Why, _I_ will give you a fortune!\" said the boy's papa. \"I will give you  a thousand million dollars, and a penny besides.\"    \"That would be a fine fortune,\" spoke the rabbit, \"but I would much rather  find my own. It is no fun when you get a thing given to you. It is better  to earn it yourself, and then you think more of it.\"    \"Yes, that is so,\" said the man. \"Well, we will be sorry to see you go.\"    Uncle Wiggily started off the next day, once more to seek his fortune, and  the little boy felt so sad at seeing him go that he cried, and put his  arms around the old gentleman rabbit, and kissed him between the ears. And  Uncle Wiggily felt badly, too.    Well, the old gentleman rabbit traveled on and on for several days after  that, sleeping under hay stacks part of the time, or in empty hollow  stumps, and sometimes he dug a burrow for himself in the soft ground.    And one afternoon, just as the sun was getting ready to go to bed for the  night, Uncle Wiggily came to an open place in the woods where there was a  cave, made of a lot of little stones piled up together.    \"My! I wonder who lives there?\" thought the rabbit. \"It is too small for a  giant to live in, but there may be a bad bear or a savage fox in there. I  guess I'd better get away from here.\"    Well, Uncle Wiggily was just going, when, all at once, a voice cried out:    \"Here, hold on there!\"    The rabbit looked back, and he saw a great big porcupine, or hedgehog--you  know, those"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15293"],[0,"Influences of Geographic Environment (#10)"],[1,"an  opportunity to satisfy an old grudge against England. The territory  gained was sold to the United States in 1867. This is the one instance  in Russian history of any attempt at maritime expansion, and also of any  withdrawal from territory to which the Muscovite power had once  established its claim. This fact alone would indicate that only  excessively tempting geographic conditions led the Russians into an  economic and political venture which neither the previously developed  aptitudes of the people nor the conditions of population and historical  development on the Siberian seaboard were able to sustain.    [Sidenote: The larger conception of the environment.]    The history and culture of a people embody the effects of previous  habitats and of their final environment; but this means something more  than local geographic conditions. It involves influences emanating from  far beyond the borders. No country, no continent, no sea, mountain or  river is restricted to itself in the influence which it either exercises  or receives. The history of Austria cannot be understood merely from  Austrian ground. Austrian territory is part of the Mediterranean  hinterland, and therefore has been linked historically with Rome, Italy,  and the Adriatic. It is a part of the upper Danube Valley and therefore  shares much of its history with Bavaria and Germany, while the lower  Danube has linked it with the Black Sea, Greece, the Russian steppes,  and Asia. The Asiatic Hungarians have pushed forward their ethnic  boundary nearly to Vienna. The Austrian capital has seen the warring  Turks beneath its walls, and shapes its foreign policy with a view to  the relative strength of the Sultan and the Czar.    [Sidenote: Unity of the earth.]    The earth is an inseparable whole. Each country or sea is physically and  historically intelligible only as a portion of that whole. Currents and  wind-systems of the oceans modify the climate of the nearby continents,  and direct the first daring navigations of their peoples. The  alternating monsoons of the Indian Ocean guided Arab merchantmen from  ancient times back and forth between the Red Sea and the Malabar coast  of India.[33] The Equatorial Current and the northeast trade-wind  carried the timid ships of Columbus across the Atlantic to America. The  Gulf Stream and the prevailing westerlies later gave English vessels the  advantage on the return voyage. Europe is a part of the Atlantic coast.  This is a fact so significant that the North Atlantic has become a  European sea. The United States also is a part of the Atlantic coast:  this is the dominant fact of American history. China forms a section of  the Pacific rim. This is the fact back of the geographic distribution of  Chinese emigration to Annam, Tonkin, Siam, Malacca, the Philippines,  East Indies, Borneo, Australia, Hawaiian Islands, the Pacific Coast  States, British Columbia, the Alaskan coast southward from Bristol Bay  in Bering Sea, Ecuador and Peru.    As the earth is one, so is humanity. Its unity of species points to some  degree of communication through a long prehistoric past. Universal  history is not entitled to the name unless it embraces all parts of the  earth and all peoples, whether savage or civilized. To fill the gaps in  the written record it must turn to ethnology and geography, which by  tracing the distribution and movements of primitive peoples can often  reconstruct the most important features of their history.    Anthropo-geographic problems are never simple. They must all be viewed  in the long perspective of evolution and the historical past. They  require allowance for the dominance of different geographic factors at  different periods, and for a possible range of geographic influences  wide as the earth itself. In the investigator they call for pains-taking  analysis and, above all, an open mind.      NOTES TO CHAPTER I    [1] George Adam Smith, Historical Geography of the Holy Land, pp.  149-157.

CHAPTER II    CLASSES OF GEOGRAPHIC INFLUENCES      Into almost every anthropo-geographical problem the element of  environment enters in different phases, with different modes of  operation and varying degrees of importance. Since the causal conception  of geography demands a detailed analysis of all the relations between  environment and human development, it is advisable to distinguish the  various classes of geographic influences.    [Sidenote: Physical effects.]    Four fundamental classes of effects can be distinguished.    1. The first class includes direct physical effects of environment,  similar to those exerted on plants and animals by their habitat. Certain  geographic conditions, more conspicuously those of climate, apply  certain stimuli to which man, like the lower animals, responds by an  adaption of his organism to his environment. Many physiological  peculiarities of man are due to physical effects of environment, which  doubtless operated very strongly in the earliest stages of human  development, and in those shadowy ages contributed to the  differentiation of races. The unity of the human species is as clearly  established as the diversity of races and peoples, whose divergences  must be interpreted chiefly as modifications in response to various  habitats in long periods of time.    [Sidenote: Variation and natural conditions.]    Such modifications have probably been numerous in the persistent and  unending movements, shiftings, and migrations which have made up the  long prehistoric history of man. If the origin of species is found in  variability and inheritance, variation is undoubtedly influenced by a  change of natural conditions. To quote Darwin, \"In one sense the  conditions of life may be said, not only to cause variability, either  directly or indirectly, but likewise to include natural selection, for  the conditions determine whether this or that variety shall survive.\"[34]  The variability of man does not mean that every external influence  leaves its mark upon him, but that man as an organism, by the  preservation of beneficent variations and the elimination of deleterious  ones, is gradually adapted to his environment, so that he can utilize  most completely that which it contributes to his needs. This  self-maintenance under outward influences is an essential part of the  conception of life which Herbert Spencer defines as the correspondence  between internal conditions and external circumstances, or August Comte  as the harmony between the living being and the surrounding medium or  _milieu_.    According to Virchow, the distinction of races rests upon hereditary  variations, but heredity itself cannot become active till the  characteristic or _Zustand_ is produced which is to be handed down.[35]  But environment determines what variation shall become stable enough to  be passed on by heredity. For instance, we can hardly err in attributing  the great lung capacity, massive chests, and abnormally large torsos of  the Quichua and Aymara Indians inhabiting the high Andean plateaus to  the rarified air found at an altitude of 10,000 or 15,000 feet above sea  level. Whether these have been acquired by centuries of extreme lung  expansion, or represent the survival of a chance variation of undoubted  advantage, they are a product of the environment. They are a serious  handicap when the Aymara Indian descends to the plains, where he either  dies off or leaves descendants with diminishing"]]]
