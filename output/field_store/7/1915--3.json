ROGER WILLIAMS  (1600-1684).      82. Roger Williams comes to Boston; he preaches in Salem and in  Plymouth; his friendship for the Indians.--Shortly after Governor  John Winthrop and his company settled Boston,[1] a young minister  named Roger Williams came over from England to join them.    [Illustration: THE CHURCH IN WHICH ROGER WILLIAMS PREACHED IN SALEM.  IT IS STILL STANDING.]    Mr. Williams soon became a great friend to the Indians and while he  preached at Salem,[2] near Boston, and at Plymouth, he came to know  many of them. He took pains to learn their language, and he spent  a great deal of time talking with the chief Massasoit[3] and his men,  in their dirty, smoky wigwams. He made the savages feel that, as he  said, his whole heart's desire was to do them good. For this reason  they were always glad to see him and ready to help him. A time came,  as we shall presently see, when they were able to do quite as much  for him as he could for them.    [Footnote 1: See paragraph 73.]    [Footnote 2: Salem (Sa'lem).]    [Footnote 3: See paragraph 68.]      83. Who owned the greater part of America? what the king of England  thought; what Roger Williams thought and said.--The company that had  settled Boston held the land by permission of the king of England.  He considered that most of the land in America belonged to him,  because John Cabot[4] had discovered it.    But Roger Williams said that the king had no right to the land unless  he bought it of the Indians, who were living here when the English  came.    Now the people of Massachusetts were always quite willing to pay the  Indians a fair price for whatever land they wanted; but many of them  were afraid to have Mr. Williams preach and write as he did. They  believed that if they allowed him to go on speaking out so boldly  against the king that the English monarch would get so angry that  he would take away Massachusetts from them and give it to a new  company. In that case, those who had settled here would lose  everything. For this reason the people of Boston tried to make the  young minister agree to keep silent on this subject.    [Footnote 4: See paragraph 22.]      84. A constable is sent to arrest Roger Williams; he escapes to the  woods, and goes to Mount Hope.--But Mr. Williams was not one of the  kind to keep silent. Then the chief men of Boston sent a constable  down to Salem with orders to seize him and send him back to England.  When he heard that the constable was after him, Mr. Williams slipped  quietly out of his house and escaped to the woods.    There was a heavy depth of snow on the ground, but the young man made  up his mind that he would go to his old friend Massasoit, and ask  him to help him in his trouble.    [Illustration: Map showing Roger Williams's route from Salem to  Mount Hope.]    Massasoit lived near Mount Hope, in what is now Rhode Island, about  eighty miles southwest from Salem. There were no roads through the  woods, and it was a long, dreary journey to make on foot, but Mr.  Williams did not hesitate. He took a hatchet to chop fire-wood, a  flint and steel to strike fire with,--for in those days people had  no matches,--and, last of all, a pocket-compass to aid him in finding  his way through the thick forest.    [Illustration: Striking fire with flint and steel. The sparks were  caught on some old, half-burnt rag, and were then blown to a blaze.]    All day he waded wearily on through the deep snow, only stopping now  and then to rest or to look at his compass and make sure that he was  going in the right direction. At night he would gather wood enough  to make a little fire to warm himself or to melt some snow for drink.  Then he would cut down a few boughs for a bed, or, if he was lucky  enough to find a large, hollow tree, he would creep into that. There  he would fall asleep, while listening to the howling of the wind or  to the fiercer howling of the hungry wolves prowling about the woods.    [Illustration: ROGER WILLIAMS WADING THROUGH THE SNOW.]    At length, after much suffering from cold and want of food, he managed  to reach Massasoit's wigwam. There the big-hearted Indian chief gave  him a warm welcome. He took him into his poor cabin and kept him till  spring--there was no board bill to pay. All the Indians liked the  young minister, and even Canonicus,[5] that savage chief of a  neighboring tribe, who had dared Governor Bradford to fight, said  that he \"loved him as his own son.\"    [Footnote 5: Canonicus: see paragraph 70.]      85. Roger Williams at Seekonk;[6] \"What cheer, friend?\"--When the  warm days came, in the spring of 1636, Mr. Williams began building  a log hut for himself at Seekonk, on the east bank of the Seekonk  River. But he was told that his cabin stood on ground owned by the  people of Massachusetts; so he, with a few friends who had joined  him, took a canoe and paddled down stream to find a new place to build.    [Illustration: Map of Rhode Island.]    \"What cheer, friend? what cheer?\" shouted some Indians who were  standing on a rock on the western bank of the river. That was the  Indian way of saying How do you do, and just then Roger Williams was  right glad to hear it. He landed on what is now called \"What Cheer  Rock,\"[7] and had a talk with the red men. They told him that there  was a fine spring of water round the point of land a little further  down. He went there, and liked the spot so much that he decided to  stop. His friend Canonicus owned the land, and he gladly let him have  what he needed. Roger Williams believed that a kind Providence had  guided him to this pleasant place, and for this reason he named it  PROVIDENCE.    Providence was the first settlement made in America which set its  doors wide open to every one who wished to come and live there. Not  only all Christians, but Jews, and even men who went to no church  whatever, could go there and be at peace. This great and good work  was done by Roger Williams. Providence grew in time to be the chief  city in the state of Rhode Island. When the Revolution began, every  man and boy in the state, from sixteen to sixty, stood ready to fight  for liberty.    [Footnote 6: Seekonk (See'konk).]    [Footnote 7: \"What Cheer Rock\" is on the east side of the city of  Providence.]      86. Summary.--Roger Williams, a young minister of Salem,  Massachusetts, declared that the Indians, and not the king of England,  owned the land in America. The governor of Massachusetts was afraid  that if Mr. Williams kept on saying these things the king would hear  of it and would take away the land held by the people of Boston and  the other settlements. He therefore sent a constable to arrest the  young minister and put him on board a ship going back to England.  When Mr. Williams knew this, he fled to the Indian chief, Massasoit.  In 1636 Roger Williams began building Providence. Providence was the  first settlement in America which offered a home to all men without  asking them anything whatever about their religious belief.      Who was Roger Williams? What is said about him and the Indians? Who  did Mr. Williams think first owned the land in America? How did many  of the people of Massachusetts feel about Mr. Williams? What did the  chief men of Boston do? What did Mr. Williams do? Describe his journey  to Mount Hope. What did Massasoit do for Mr. Williams? What did Mr.  Williams do at Seekonk? What happened after that? Why did he name  the settlement Providence? What is said of Providence? What about  the Revolution?          KING PHILIP  (Time of the Indian War, 1675-1676).      87. Death of Massasoit; Wamsutta[1] and Philip; Wamsutta's sudden  death.--When the Indian chief Massasoit[2] died, the people of  Plymouth lost one of their best friends. Massasoit left two sons,  one named Wamsutta, who became chief in his father's place, and the  other called Philip. They both lived near Mount Hope, in Rhode  Island.    The governor of Plymouth heard that Wamsutta was stirring up the  Indians to make war on the whites, and he sent for the Indian chief  to come to him and give an account of himself. Wamsutta went, but  on his way back he suddenly fell sick, and soon after he reached home  he died. His young wife was a woman who was thought a great deal of  by her tribe, and she told them that she felt sure the white people  had poisoned her husband in order to get rid of him. This was not  true, but the Indians believed it.    [Footnote 1: Wamsutta (Wam-sut'ta).]    [Footnote 2: Massasoit: see paragraph 68.]      88. Philip becomes chief; why he hated the white men; how the white  men had got possession of the Indian lands.--Philip now became chief.  He called himself \"King Philip.\" His palace was a wigwam made of bark.  On great occasions he wore a bright red blanket and a kind of crown  made of a broad belt ornamented with shells. King Philip hated the  white people because, in the first place, he believed that they had  murdered his brother; and next, because he saw that they were growing  stronger in numbers every year, while the Indians were becoming  weaker.    [Illustration: THE BELT WHICH KING PHILIP WORE FOR A CROWN.]    When the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth, Massasoit, Philip's father,  held all the country from Cape Cod back to the eastern shores of  Narragansett Bay; that is, a strip about thirty miles wide. The white  settlers bought a small piece of this land. After a while they bought  more, and so they kept on until in about fifty years they got nearly"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18134"],[0,"Sixteen Months in Four German Prisons: Wesel, Sennelager, Klingelputz, Ruhleben (#10)"],[1," yard we were lined up, still two paces apart and under the  hawk-eyes of the guard. Then the first man from one end advanced to the  pump, alongside which stood two soldiers with fixed bayonets with which  the man was prodded if he evinced signs of lingering or dwelling unduly  over his work. The duty involved cleaning out the sanitary pan, in which  by the way dependence had to be placed upon the hands alone, no mop or  cloth being allowed. Then the jug had to be refilled from the pump,  which was a crazy old appliance worked by hand. I may say that so far as  we prisoners residing in the ill-famed avenue were concerned we had to  depend upon water entirely for washing purposes--soap was an unheard-of  luxury--while a towel was unknown. Under these circumstances it was  impossible to keep clean. Shaving was another pleasure which we were  denied, and I may say that the prisoners residing in the salubrious  neighbourhood of the condemned cells had the most unkempt and ragged  appearance it is possible to conceive. When the man had finished his  task he marched to the opposite end of the line, his place being  immediately taken by the next man, and so on until the work was  completed, which usually involved about ten minutes.    Although intercourse was rendered impossible by the vigilance and number  of the guards yet I was able to take stock of my neighbours. We were a  small but cosmopolitan family, the French predominating. For some  inscrutable reason the Germans appear to have been unusually successful  in their haul of French spies, although doubtless the great majority  were as innocent of the charge of espionage as I was. Yet we were a  motley throng and I do not think any self-respecting tramps would have  chummed up with us. Many of my fellow prisoners bore unmistakable  evidences of premature old age--the fruits of solitary confinement, lack  of exercise, and insufficient food. Others seemed half-witted and dazed  as a result of the brutal treatment which they had received. Some were  so weak that they could scarcely manipulate the crazy pump. Many were  garbed only in trousers, being void of boots, socks, shirts and vest.  Unkempt beards concealed thin, worn and haggard faces studded with red  bloodshot eyes.    While I was waiting in the line my attention was arrested by one man,  who formed a member of our party. He was a German, but he did not  appear as if he had been guilty of any heinous crime--at least not one  of sufficient calibre to bring him into our Avenue. He was well built,  of attractive personality, and was well dressed in a blue suit complete  with clean collar, tie and other details.    Who was he? What was he doing with us? Was he a spy? My curiosity was  thoroughly aroused. I became interested in him, and strange to say the  sentiment was mutual because he could not take his eyes from me. I  keenly wanted to speak to him but this was frankly out of the question.  Yet we seemed to be drawing together.    I did not attempt to speak but contrived by sundry movements and  shuffling on one pretext or another to get closer to him. Then I  resorted to subterfuge. Standing with my hands in front of me I began to  twiddle my fingers rapidly. The action appeared to be natural and did  not arouse the slightest suspicion. Within the limitations available I  was forming some of the letters of the deaf and dumb alphabet with which  I am fully acquainted and dexterous. Did he understand the language? I  watched him closely. Presently I saw his fingers begin to move with  apparent equal aimlessness. I watched intently. He was answering me and  to my joy I discovered that he understood English.    Our fingers were now working briskly and we carried on a brief  monosyllabic conversation while the other prisoners were completing  their work. From him I learned that I was certainly in great danger. But  he urged me to cheer up. Then he asked me the number of my cell, which I  gave. He replied that he was directly opposite me, and he told me to  look out for him whenever I got a chance, which, needless to say, under  the stringency of my life, was not likely to be often. He had such a  frank open face that I felt as if I could trust him, although I had come  to regard every German, no matter how apparently innocent his  conversation might be, with the gravest suspicion. But a quaint, quiet,  suppressed smile which he gave restored my confidence completely.    The hours dragged along as during the previous day. It was wearying and  exhausting. I refused all my food and was making an imposing collection  of bowls of foodstuff. None was taken away. The gaoler merely observed  that I had not touched anything, but he made no comment. When night fell  I essayed to lie down, but this was impossible. The sores on my  projecting thigh bones had broken into large wounds which were now  bleeding and suppurating and were so painful as to render lying down  impossible. As a matter of fact more than two months passed before those  wounds healed and the scars are still visible.    I was lying as best I could upon my bed vainly striving to woo sleep. It  was about midnight. The key grated in the lock and a young officer  entered. He was gruff of manner, but according to the German standard  was not unkind. I found that his manner was merely a mask to dissipate  any suspicion among others who might be prowling round, such is the  distrust of one German of another. After he had shut the door his manner  changed completely and he was disposed to be affable. But I resented his  intrusion. Had he come to fathom me? Was he an emissary seeking to  induce me to commit myself inadvertently? Frankly I thought so. He spoke  softly and his voice was intentionally kind, while he spoke English  perfectly.    \"I would like to help you,\" he began.    \"Would you?\" I retorted cynically.    \"Yes, I am very fond of the English. I have lived in London several  years and have many friends over there.\"    \"Well, it's a thousand pities we don't serve some of your blighted  countrymen the same as they are serving me,\" I shot back.    \"Yes, I know. I am very sorry for you. But it is our way. Now I,  myself, don't think you are a spy. I think your story is honest and  straightforward.\"    \"Then why in the name of Heaven don't they treat me so until they have  tried me?\"    \"Ah! That is the English way. Here, in Germany, a man is guilty until he  is found innocent!\"    \"Oh! So that's your much-vaunted German 'Kultur,' is it?\" I laughed  sarcastically.    Seeing that I was a bit overwrought he sought to pacify me.    \"Would you like a cigarette?\"    At the thought of a smoke I nearly jumped for joy. There was nothing for  which I had been yearning so much as the solace of a cigarette. I took  one from his proffered case.    \"H'sh! I cannot stay any longer now. The guard might get suspicious. But  I will do all I can for you. I will come to see you every night at this  time. I will make you as comfortable as I can as a return for the many  courtesies and kindnesses I received while in London. Now light up and  jump up to the ventilator to puff the smoke out. If they smell tobacco  in the cell you will get into serious trouble.\"    He bade me good-night and the next instant I was at the window to enjoy  the only peaceful few minutes of pleasure which had come my way since my  arrest. My smoke completed I settled down to sleep with additional  comfort.    At 2.30 in the morning I was once more awakened. The door flew open and  in rushed my friend the young officer. He was terribly agitated. He  grasped both my hands and I felt that he was trembling like a leaf. His  voice was so broken that he could scarcely speak.    \"Good God! Do you know what has happened? Great Britain has declared war  on Germany!\" Like a child he burst out crying. As for myself I knew  hardly what to think. I had been hoping against hope that the  circumstance of our still keeping friendly relations would facilitate my  speedy release. This hope was fairly blasted now, and I was certain to  meet with far shorter shrift and harsher treatment than had already been  meted out to me. I may say that this was the first intelligence I had  received about the outbreak of war with Great Britain.    Stifling his emotion the officer went on.    \"I am very sorry it has happened. I shall not be able to see you again!\"    \"Why?\"    \"I have to leave for the front. I have ten minutes to say farewell to my  poor old mother.\" Here he broke down once more. \"My poor mother,\" he  wailed. \"It will kill her. She does not know a soul in Wesel. We are  utter strangers. I was summoned back from London only a week or two  ago.\" He gave vent to another outburst of sobbing.    \"Cheer up!\" I said soothingly, \"you'll see her when you come back!\"    \"Come back?\" he echoed bitterly. \"No! I shall never come back. I shall  never see her again! Good-bye! Remember that I always thought kindly of  the English. But I won't forget you before I go!\"    His fatalistic resignation somewhat moved me. He was inwardly convinced  that he was going to his death. But I appreciated his sparing a little  of his bare ten minutes to give me a parting visit. I also thank him for  remembering me as he had promised. Shortly after he had gone the gaoler  came to my cell with a sack of fresh straw to serve as a mattress. The  young officer had paid him to extend me this slight privilege. To me it  was like a Heaven-sent blessing, because it enabled me to seek a little  repose without subjecting my bleeding hips to further damage.    During the following day, Wednesday, I was enabled to snatch a peep of  the corridor without, owing to the gaoler paying me a visit in response  to my summons. To my utter astonishment, looking across the corridor, I  saw the mysterious prisoner with whom I had been talking by aid of the  mute alphabet, lounging at the door of his open cell smoking a cigar.  This discovery startled me, and I decided "]]]
