For, the Sutrakira  remarks, the creative principle of the world is additional to, i.e.  other than, the individual soul, the difference of the two being  distinctly declared by Scripture.--The way in which the three Sutras  constituting this adhikara/n/a are treated by /S/a@nkara on the one hand  and Ramanuja on the other is characteristic. Ramanuja throughout simply  follows the words of the Sutras, of which Sutra 21 formulates the  objection based on such texts as 'Thou art that,' while Sutra 22 replies  that Brahman is different from the soul, since that is expressly  declared by Scripture. /S/a@nkara, on the other hand, sees himself  obliged to add that the difference of the two, plainly maintained in  Sutra 22, is not real, but due to the soul's fictitious limiting  adjuncts.    Adhik. VIII (24, 25) shows that Brahman, although destitute of material  and instruments of action, may yet produce the world, just as gods by  their mere power create palaces, animals, and the like, and as milk by  itself turns into curds.    Adhik. IX (26-29) explains that, according to the express doctrine of  Scripture, Brahman does not in its entirety pass over into the world,  and, although emitting the world from itself, yet remains one and  undivided. This is possible, according to /S/a@nkara, because the world  is unreal; according to Ramanuja, because the creation is merely the  visible and tangible manifestation of what previously existed in Brahman  in a subtle imperceptible condition.    Adhik. X (30, 31) teaches that Brahman, although destitute of  instruments of action, is enabled to create the world by means of the  manifold powers which it possesses.    Adhik. XI (32, 33) assigns the motive of the creation, or, more properly  expressed, teaches that Brahman, in creating the world, has no motive in  the strict sense of the word, but follows a mere sportive impulse.    Adhik. XII (34-36) justifies Brahman from the charges of partiality and  cruelty which might be brought against it owing to the inequality of  position and fate of the various animate beings, and the universal  suffering of the world. Brahman, as a creator and dispenser, acts with a  view to the merit and demerit of the individual souls, and has so acted  from all eternity.    Adhik. XIII (37) sums up the preceding argumentation by declaring that  all the qualities of Brahman--omniscience and so on--are such as to  capacitate it for the creation of the world.      PADA II.      The task of the second pada is to refute, by arguments independent of  Vedic passages, the more important philosophical theories concerning the  origin of the world which are opposed to the Vedanta view.--The first  adhikara/n/a (1-10) is directed against the Sa@nkhyas, whose doctrine  had already been touched upon incidentally in several previous places,  and aims at proving that a non-intelligent first cause, such as the  pradhana of the Sa@nkhyas, is unable to create and dispose.--The second  adhikara/n/a (11-17) refutes the Vai/s/eshika tenet that the world  originates from atoms set in motion by the ad/ri/sh/t/a.--The third and  fourth adhikara/n/as are directed against various schools of Bauddha  philosophers. Adhik. III (18-27) impugns the view of the so-called  sarvastitvavadins, or bahyarthavadins, who maintain the reality of an  external as well as an internal world; Adhik. IV (28-32) is directed  against the vij/n/anavadins, according to whom ideas are the only  reality.--The last Sutra of this adhikara/n/a is treated by Ramanuja as  a separate adhikara/n/a refuting the view of the Madhyamikas, who teach  that everything is void, i.e. that nothing whatever is real.--Adhik. V  (33-36) is directed against the doctrine of the Jainas; Adhik. VI  (37-41) against those philosophical schools which teach that a highest  Lord is not the material but only the operative cause of the world.    The last adhikara/n/a of the pada (42-45) refers, according to the  unanimous statement of the commentators, to the doctrine of the  Bhagavatas or Pa/nk/aratras. But /S/a@nkara and Ramanuja totally  disagree as to the drift of the Sutrakara's opinion regarding that  system. According to the former it is condemned like the systems  previously referred to; according to the latter it is approved  of.--Sutras 42 and 43, according to both commentators, raise objections  against the system; Sutra 42 being directed against the doctrine that  from the highest being, called Vasudeva, there is originated  Sa@nkarsha/n/a, i.e. the jiva, on the ground that thereby those  scriptural passages would be contradicted which teach the soul's  eternity; and Sutra 43 impugning the doctrine that from Sa@nkarsha/n/a  there springs Pradyumna, i.e. the manas.--The Sutra on which the  difference of interpretation turns is 44. Literally translated it runs,  'Or, on account of there being' (or, 'their being') 'knowledge and so  on, there is non-contradiction of that.'--This means, according to  /S/a@nkara, 'Or, if in consequence of the existence of knowledge and so  on (on the part of Sa@nkarsha/n/a, &c. they be taken not as soul, mind,  &c. but as Lords of pre-eminent knowledge, &c.), yet there is  non-contradiction of that (viz. of the objection raised in Sutra 42  against the Bhagavata doctrine).'--According to Ramanuja, on the other  hand, the Sutra has to be explained as follows: 'Or, rather there is  noncontradiction of that (i.e. the Pa/nk/aratra doctrine) on account of  their being knowledge and so on (i.e. on account of their being  Brahman).' Which means: Since Sa@nkarsha/n/a and so on are merely forms  of manifestation of Brahman, the Pa/nk/aratra doctrine, according to  which they spring from Brahman, is not contradicted.--The form of the  Sutra makes it difficult for us to decide which of the two  interpretations is the right one; it, however, appears to me that the  explanations of the 'va' and of the 'tat,' implied in Ramanuja's  comment, are more natural than those resulting from /S/a@nkara's  interpretation. Nor would it be an unnatural proceeding to close the  polemical pada with a defence of that doctrine which--in spite of  objections--has to be viewed as the true one.      PADA III.      The third pada discusses the question whether the different forms of  existence which, in their totality, constitute the world have an origin  or not, i.e. whether they are co-eternal with Brahman, or issue from it  and are refunded into it at stated intervals.    The first seven adhikara/n/as treat of the five elementary  substances.--Adhik. I (1-7) teaches that the ether is not co-eternal  with Brahman, but springs from it as its first effect.--Adhik. II (8)  shows that air springs from ether; Adhik. IV, V, VI (10; 11; 12) that  fire springs from air, water from fire, earth from water.--Adhik. III  (9) explains by way of digression that Brahman, which is not some  special entity, but quite generally 'that which is,' cannot have  originated from anything else.    Adhik. VII (13) demonstrates that the origination of one element from  another is due, not to the latter in itself, but to Brahman acting in  it.    Adhik. VIII (14) teaches that the reabsorption of the elements into  Brahman takes place in the inverse order of their emission.    Adhik. IX (15) remarks that the indicated order in which the emission  and the reabsorption of the elementary substances take place is not  interfered with by the creation and reabsorption of the organs of the  soul, i.e. the sense organs and the internal organ (manas); for they  also are of elemental nature, and as such created and retracted together  with the elements of which they consist.    The remainder of the pada is taken up by a discussion of the nature of  the individual soul, the jiva.--Adhik. X (16) teaches that expressions  such as 'Devadatta is born,' 'Devadatta has died,' strictly apply to the  body only, and are transferred to the soul in so far only as it is  connected with a body.    Adhik. XI (17) teaches that the individual soul is, according to  Scripture, permanent, eternal, and therefore not, like the ether and the  other elements, produced from Brahman at the time of creation.--This  Sutra is of course commented on in a very different manner by /S/a@nkara  on the one hand and Ramanuja on the other. According to the former, the  jiva is in reality identical--and as such co-eternal--with Brahman; what  originates is merely the soul's connexion with its limiting adjuncts,  and that connexion is moreover illusory.--According to Ramanuja, the  jiva is indeed an effect of Brahman, but has existed in Brahman from all  eternity as an individual being and as a mode (prakara) of Brahman. So  indeed have also the material elements; yet there is an important  distinction owing to which the elements may be said to originate at the  time of creation, while the same cannot be said of the soul. Previously  to creation the material elements exist in a subtle condition in which  they possess none of the qualities that later on render them the objects  of ordinary experience; hence, when passing over into the gross state at  the time of creation, they may be said to originate. The souls, on the  other hand, possess at all times the same essential qualities, i.e. they  are cognizing agents; only, whenever a new creation takes place, they  associate themselves with bodies, and their intelligence therewith  undergoes a certain expansion or development (vikasa); contrasting with  the unevolved or contracted state (sanko/k/a) which characterised it  during the preceding pralaya. But this change is not a change of  essential nature (svarupanyathabhava) and hence we have to distinguish  the souls as permanent entities from the material elements which at the  time of each creation and reabsorption change their essential  characteristics.    Adhik. XII (18) defines the nature of the individual soul. The Sutra  declares that the soul is 'j/n/a.' This means, according to /S/a@nka"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16331"],[0,"New York Times Current History: The European War from the Beginning to March (#10)"],[1,"last moment offered  the hand of mediation, but Russia is responsible for the war, and that  the Foreign Office at London was fully cognizant of this fact.    Furthermore, the \"White Paper\" shows that England's claim that she  entered this war solely as a protector of the small nations is a fable.    The documents reproduced in the \"White Paper\" do not begin until July  20, and only a few introductory dispatches before the 24th are given.  The first of the very important reports of the British Ambassador at St.  Petersburg, Sir George Buchanan, to the Secretary of State, Grey, is  dated on that day; on the same day the note addressed by Austria-Hungary  to the Servian Government had been brought to the knowledge of the  European Cabinets, and the British Ambassador conferred with the Russian  Minister of Foreign Affairs, M. Sazonof, over this matter. The French  Minister also took part in this conference. When the latter and M.  Sazonof, in the most insistent way, tried to prove to Buchanan that  England, together with Russia and France, must assume a threatening  attitude toward Austria-Hungary and Germany, the British Ambassador  replied:         I said that I would telegraph a full report to you of what their       Excellencies had just said to me. I could not, of course, speak in       the name of his Majesty's Government, but personally I saw no       reason to expect any declaration of solidarity from his Majesty's       Government that would entail an unconditional engagement on their       part to support Russia and France by force of arms. Direct British       interests in Servia were nil, and a war on behalf of that country       would never be sanctioned by British public opinion.--(British       \"White Paper\" No. 6.)    The British Ambassador thereupon asked the question whether Russia was  thinking of eventually declaring war on Austria. The following was the  answer:         M. Sazonof said that he himself thought that Russian mobilization       would at any rate have to be carried out; but a council of       Ministers was being held this afternoon to consider the whole       question....    The dispatch continues:         French Ambassador and M. Sazonof both continue to press me for a       declaration of complete solidarity of his Majesty's Government with       French and Russian Governments.... (British \"White Paper\" No. 6.)    This shows plainly that the Russian mobilization must have been planned  even before July 24, for otherwise M. Sazonof could not have spoken of  the necessity of carrying it through.    It is furthermore very remarkable that the Russian Minister on this  early day spoke of the mobilization in general and not of the partial  mobilization against Austria-Hungary.    Finally we find that the British Government was fully informed at the  very latest on July 24--it may have had before it previous documents,  but they are not contained in the \"White Paper\"--concerning Russian  mobilization and thereby the development of Russian and French politics  that had to be anticipated.    Russian Aggression.    Had there been any doubts concerning these matters on the part of the  British Government, the continual urging of Russian and French  diplomatists must have made things plain. Russia's aggressive  policy, and not the Austrian declaration of war on Servia, which did not  come until five days later, led to the European war. Servia meant so  little to England, although England traditionally poses as a protector  of small nations, that the British Ambassador in St. Petersburg was able  to describe England's interest in the kingdom on the Save as \"nil.\" Only  later, after the beginning of the war, England warmed up to Servia, and  in the aforementioned speech Mr. Lloyd George found the most hearty  tones in speaking of the heroic fight of this \"little nation,\" although  he was obliged to admit simultaneously that its' history is not  untainted.    On the day following that conversation, on July 25, the British  Ambassador had another talk with M. Sasonof, during the course of which  he felt obliged to express to the Russian Government a serious warning  concerning its mobilization.         On my expressing the earnest hope that Russia would not precipitate       war by mobilizing until you had had time to use your influence in       favor of peace his Excellency assured me that Russia had no       aggressive intentions and she would take no action until it was       forced on her. Austria's action was in reality directed against       Russia. She aimed at overthrowing the present status quo in the       Balkans and establishing her own hegemony there. He did not believe       that Germany really wanted war, but her attitude was decided by       ours. If we took our stand firmly with France and Russia there       would be no war. If we failed them now rivers of blood would flow       and we would in the end be dragged into war....         I said all I could to impress prudence on the Minister for Foreign       Affairs and warned him that if Russia mobilized Germany would not       be content with mere mobilization or give Russia time to carry out       hers, but would probably declare war at once! His Excellency       replied that Russia could not allow Austria to crush Servia and       become the predominant power in the Balkans, and, if she feels       secure of the support of France, she will face all the risks of       war. He assured me once more that he did not wish to precipitate a       conflict, but that unless Germany could restrain Austria I could       regard the situation as desperate.--(British \"White Paper\" No. 17.)    A more convincing contradiction of the claim that Germany fell upon  unexpectant Russia can hardly be imagined. Sazonof's conversation with  the British Ambassador shows that Russia had decided from the beginning  to bring about the war, unless Austria would subject itself to Russia's  dictation.    Now, Russia was not alone concerned about Servia, but from its viewpoint  Austria-Hungary must not maintain the preponderant position in the  Balkans.    Sure of French help, Russia was determined to work against this. The  reports of the British representative do not suggest with a word that  Germany was responsible for the war; on the contrary, Sir Buchanan  again, on his own account, warned the Russian Government to keep aloof  from military measures, in his conversation with M. Sazonof on July 27,  although the \"White Paper\" does not show that he had received any  instructions by Sir Edward Grey.         His Excellency must not, if our efforts were to be successful, do       anything to precipitate a conflict. In these circumstances I       trusted that the Russian Government would defer the mobilization       ukase for as long as possible, and that troops would not be allowed       to cross the frontier even when it was issued.--(British \"White       Paper,\" No, 44.)    Just as its own Ambassador in Petersburg pointed out to the British  Government the dangers of Russian mobilization, England did not lack  German warnings. On July 28 the British Ambassador in Berlin, Sir E.  Goschen, reported as follows by wire concerning a conversation with the  Imperial Chancellor:         ... but if the news were true which he had just read in the papers,       that Russia had mobilized fourteen army corps in the South, he       thought the situation was very serious, and he himself would be in       a very difficult position, as in these circumstances it would be       out of his power to continue to preach moderation at Vienna. He       added that Austria, who as yet was only partially mobilizing, would       have to take similar measures, and if war were to result Russia       would be entirely responsible.--(British \"White Paper\" No. 71.)    In a telegram of Mr. Goschen's of July 30, reporting a conversation with  the Secretary of State, von Jagow, it is stated:         He begged me to impress on you difficulty of Germany's       position in view of Russian mobilization and military measures       which he hears are being taken in France.--(British \"White Paper\"       No. 98.)    The British Government has added a few further publications to its  \"White Paper.\" Among these is a report of the hitherto British  Ambassador in Vienna, Sir Maurice de Bunsen. The document is dated Sept.  1; that is, a full month after the outbreak of the war. The tendency of  this publication is not only to unburden Russia and England from all  blame and to put it upon German and Austro-Hungarian politics, but it  attempts to make Germany responsible for the war to greater extent than  Austria-Hungary in trying to sow dissension between the two allies.    Ambassador de Bunsen represents matters as if Germany, through its  ultimatum to Russia on July 31, had roughly interrupted negotiations  promising success then going on between Vienna and Petersburg. In this  report it is stated:         (Retranslated.) M. Schebeko [the Russian Ambassador at Vienna] on       July 28th attempted to induce the Austrian Government to authorize       Count Scapary to continue negotiations which he had been carrying       on with M. Sazonof and which appeared very promising. Count       Berchtold on this day declined, but two days later, July 30th,       although Russia then had already started partial mobilization       against Austria, he received M. Schebeko again in the most       courteous manner and gave his consent to continuation of the pour       parleurs.... On Aug. 1st M. Schebeko informed me that Austria was       ready to submit to mediation those parts of its note to Servia       which appeared to be irreconcilable to the independence of       Servia.... Unfortunately these pour parleurs in St. Petersburg and       Vienna were suddenly broken off by the quarrel being removed to the       more dangerous territory of a direct conflict between Germany and       Russia.
