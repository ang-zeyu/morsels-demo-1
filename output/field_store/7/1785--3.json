We will let these circles of colored paper stand for the atoms of carbon,  hydrogen, and oxygen in grape sugar,--the largest, which are red, for the  oxygen; the second size, which you notice are black, will represent atoms  of carbon; while the little blue ones will make you think of hydrogen.    If you remember that it takes one atom of carbon and two of oxygen to make  carbonic acid gas; also, that two atoms of carbon, one of oxygen, and six  of hydrogen to form alcohol, you can easily find that two atoms of carbonic  acid gas and two atoms of alcohol may be formed from an atom of sugar. So  the more sugar a juice contains the more alcohol may be formed from it.    _CIDER._--Cider is made by pressing the juice out of apples. This sweet  cider ferments, and the sugar part of it changes into carbonic acid gas and  alcohol. People who do not understand this go on drinking cider, not  knowing that it makes drunkards of those who drink much of a beverage which  seems so pleasant and harmless.    _WINES._--Wines are made from the juices of fruits which have sugar in  them, especially grapes. Sometimes people have what they call _home-made  wines_, which they make from blackberries, currants, elderberries,  gooseberries, cherries, or other fruits. They may ask you to take some,  saying, \"This will do you no harm; we did not put any alcohol into it.\"  They do not know what you have learned, that alcohol is always formed in  fermented juices which contain sugar. It does not wait to be put into the  home-made wines; it quietly comes in as they are getting made, at home or  any other place, and will make people drunk as surely as when it is found  in brandy or any other liquor.    Some of the wines in the stores are made from grape juice, but many more  are made by mixing hurtful and poisonous things together to make the liquor  strong, and give it what is called a fine color and good taste.    _BEER AND ALES._--These are made from grains and hops, which contain no  sugar, it is true, but are composed of starch, which may be changed into  sugar. When a seed of grain is put into the ground and begins to grow, the  starch in it becomes sugar, which feeds the young plant. When a brewer  wishes to make beer, he takes some grain, puts it in a dark place, wets it,  and leaves it to sprout, or begin to grow. Then he puts it into an oven to  dry it, and make it stop growing. This makes what is called _malt_. The  malt is mashed and soaked in warm water to get the sugar out of it; this  forms a liquid called _sweet wort_. The wort is separated from the mashed  grain and boiled; yeast is mixed with it to help it to ferment more  quickly; it soon becomes changed; a dirty yellow scum filled with bubbles  comes to the top, which we know is the poisonous carbonic acid gas; the  other poison, alcohol, stays in the liquid and makes the beer taste good to  those who like it.    Liquors made from grain are called _malt liquors_. Lager beer, and all  kinds of ales and porters, are malt liquors. They make people dull,  sluggish, and stupid who drink much of them. They do much mischief in the  body, though it takes a larger quantity of any one of them to make a person  drunk than it does of whiskey or brandy.

How does the sugar in grapes and other fruits become alcohol?--\"By  fermenting.\" Yes, and liquors made by fermenting are called _fermented  liquors_. What other alcoholic drinks have you heard about beside cider,  wines, beer, and ales?--\"Gin, whiskey, brandy, rum.\" These are stronger  than the fermented liquors, that is, they contain more alcohol; they are  made by what is called _distillation_.    If you boil water, and let the steam from it fall upon a cold plate, the  steam will change back into liquid and become _distilled_ water. Making a  liquid boil, catching the vapor or steam and cooling it, is what we mean by  distillation.    If two or more liquids are mixed together, the one that boils with the  least heat will be drawn off first. The alcohol of beer, cider, and wines  is mixed with water; it boils at a lower heat than water, so can be drawn  off from it very easily. This does not make more alcohol, it only makes the  alcohol stronger by separating it from the water.    When beer or any other alcoholic liquor is to be distilled, it is poured  into a large copper boiler, called a _still_, and boiled. A tube carries  the vapor from the boiler into a cask filled with cold water. This tube is  coiled like a spiral line or worm through the cask; it is called _the worm  of the still_, and the cask is _the worm-tub_. As the vapor passes through  the tube, it cools and drops out at the end into the worm-tub, changed into  a liquid stronger in alcohol than that from which it was drawn or  distilled.    In this way gin is made from beer, brandy from wine, and rum from fermented  molasses. These are very strong drinks, and only hard drinkers like them.  But very few people begin by taking these; they first learn to like alcohol  by drinking cider, beer, or wine, and end with gin, whiskey, or rum when  they have become drunkards.

Raw alcohol does not do much harm to people because it is too strong for  them to drink much of it; but the alcohol hidden in cider, ale, wine,  whiskey, and other alcoholic drinks kills not less than _sixty thousand_  persons in this country every year, besides those who die from its use in  other parts of the world.    There is great excitement when there is a mad dog around; and, if any one  is bitten and dies from the dreadful hydrophobia, people are ready to  destroy all the dogs of the neighborhood; but when a drunkard dies from  delirium tremens or alcohol craziness, how few take any notice of the cause  of his death, or do all they can to wage war against the use of alcoholic  liquors.    But why do we say such hard things against these liquors which some people  love so well and think so harmless? In what way do they hurt and kill  people? Let us see. Where does what we drink go after it has been put into  the mouth?--\"Into the stomach.\" If it were the right thing to go into the  stomach, into what would it be changed?--\"Into something which helps to  make good blood.\"    Learned men, who have examined and carefully studied about these things,  tell us that _the stomach is hurt_ by alcohol, because the fiery fluid is  not food, but poison which makes the stomach very sore, and gives it hard  work to do. The veins of the stomach take it up and send it into the liver.  The liver, which is a large organ weighing about four pounds, lies on the  right side below the lungs; its work is, to help make the blood pure. It  can do nothing with alcohol, so it drives it along to the heart; the heart  sends it to the lungs; the lungs throw some of it out through the breath,  which smells of the vile stuff that has been poisoning every part it has  passed through since it entered the mouth.    Some of the alcohol does not get out of the lungs through the breath, but  goes with the blood back to the heart, and from the heart is sent through  the arteries to every part of the body. No part of the body wants it.    _The Skin_ drives some of it out, through its little pores, with the  perspiration.    _The Kidneys_, which lie in the back below the waist, on each side of the  spine, send off some of the poison.    Yet some of it gets into _the brain_, and there does very much mischief, of  which you will learn more by and by. You know, if the brain is hurt, the  mind cannot do its work of thinking properly; thus, alcohol does great  _harm to the mind_ through the brain.    _The muscles_ and _the bones_ are hurt by not being supplied with pure  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15446"],[0,"Vocal Mastery (#10)"],[1,"accommodates between three and four  hundred patients. The whole institution is maintained from her own  private income. During the war she generously gave of her time and art  to sing for the soldiers and aided the cause of the Allies and the Red  Cross whenever possible. For her labors of love in this direction, she  has the distinction of being decorated by a special gold medal of honor,  by both the French and Italian Governments; a distinction only conferred  on two others beside herself.    After our conference, I thanked her for giving me an hour from her  crowded day. She took my hand and pressed it warmly in both hers.    \"Please do not quite forget me, Madame.\"    \"Indeed not, will you forget me?\"    \"No, I shall always remember this delightful hour.\"    \"Then, you see, I cannot forget you!\" and she gave my hand a parting  squeeze.          VIII    =ANTONIO SCOTTI=    TRAINING AMERICAN SINGERS FOR OPERA      A singer of finished art and ripe experience is Antonio Scotti. His  operatic career has been rich in development, and he stands to-day at  the top of the ladder, as one of the most admired dramatic baritones of  our time.    One of Naples' sons, he made a first appearance on the stage at Malta,  in 1889. Successful engagements in Milan, Rome, Madrid, Russia and  Buenos Aires followed. In 1899 he came to London, singing _Don Giovanni_  at Covent Garden. A few months thereafter, he came to New York and began  his first season at the Metropolitan. His vocal and histrionic gifts won  instant recognition here and for the past twenty years he has been one  of the most dependable artists of each regular season.      CHARACTERIZATION    [Illustration: [handwritten note] To Miss Harriette Brower Cordially A  Scotti New York 1920]    With all his varied endowments, it seldom or never falls to the lot of a  baritone to impersonate the lover; on the contrary it seems to be his  metier to portray the villain. Scotti has been forced to hide his true  personality behind the mask of a Scarpia, a Tonio, an Iago, and last but  not least, the most repulsive yet subtle of all his villains--Chim-Fang,  in _L'Oracolo_. Perhaps the most famous of them all is Scarpia. But what  a Scarpia, the quintessence of the polished, elegant knave! The  refinement of Mr. Scotti's art gives to each role distinct  characteristics which separate it from all the others.      OPPORTUNITY FOR THE AMERICAN SINGER    Mr. Scotti has done and is doing much for the young American singer, by  not only drilling the inexperienced ones, but also by giving them  opportunity to appear in opera on tour. To begin this enterprise, the  great baritone turned impresario, engaged a company of young singers,  most of them Americans, and, when his season at the Metropolitan was at  an end, took this company, at his own expense, on a southern trip,  giving opera in many cities.    Discussing his venture on one occasion, Mr. Scotti said:    \"It was an experiment in several ways. First, I had an all-American  company, which was indeed an experiment. I had some fine artists in the  principal roles, with lesser known ones in smaller parts. With these I  worked personally, teaching them how to act, thus preparing them for  further career in the field of opera. I like to work with the younger  and less experienced ones, for it gives me real pleasure to watch how  they improve, when they have the opportunity.    \"Of course I am obliged to choose my material carefully, for many more  apply for places than I can ever accept.      ITALIAN OPERA IN AMERICA    \"So closely is Italy identified with all that pertains to opera,\" he  continued, \"that the question of the future of Italian opera in America  interests me immensely. It has been my privilege to devote some of the  best years of my life to singing in Italian opera in this wonderful  country of yours. One is continually impressed with the great advance  America has made and is making along all musical lines. It is marvelous,  though you who live here may not be awake to the fact. Musicians in  Europe and other parts of the world, who have never been here, can form  no conception of the musical activities here.    \"It is very gratifying to me, as an Italian, to realize that the  operatic compositions of my country must play an important part in the  future of American musical art. It seems to me there is more intrinsic  value--more variety in the works of modern Italian composers than in  those of other nations. We know the operas of Mozart are largely founded  on Italian models.    \"Of the great modern Italian composers, I feel that Puccini is the most  important, because he has a more intimate appreciation of theatrical  values. He seems to know just what kind of music will fit a series of  words or a scene, which will best bring out the dramatic sense.  Montemezzi is also very great in this respect. This in no way detracts  from what Mascagni, Leoncavallo and others have accomplished. It is only  my personal estimate of Puccini as a composer. The two most popular  operas to-day are _Aida_ and _Madame Butterfly_, and they will always  draw large audiences, although American people are prone to attend the  opera for the purpose of hearing some particular singer and not for the  sake of the work of the composer. In other countries this is not so  often the case. We must hope this condition will be overcome in due  time, for the reason that it now often happens that good performances  are missed by the public who are only attracted when some much heralded  celebrity sings.\"      AMERICAN COMPOSERS    Asked for his views regarding American operatic composers, Mr. Scotti  said:    \"American composers often spoil their chances of success by selecting  uninteresting and uninspired stories, which either describe some doleful  historic incident or illustrate some Indian legend, in which no one of  to-day is interested, and which is so far removed from actual life that  it becomes at once artificial, academic and preposterous. Puccini spends  years searching for suitable librettos, as great composers have always  done. When he finds a story that is worthy he turns it into an opera.  But he will wait till he discovers the right kind of a plot. No wonder  he has success. In writing modern music dramas, as all young Americans  endeavor to do, they will never be successful unless they are careful to  pick out really dramatic stories to set to music.\"      OPERATIC TRAINING    On a certain occasion I had an opportunity to confer with this popular  baritone, and learn more in regard to his experiences as impresario.  This meeting was held in the little back office of the Metropolitan, a  tiny spot, which should be--and doubtless is--dear to every member of  the company. Those four walls, if they would speak, could tell many  interesting stories of singers and musicians, famed in the world of art  and letters, who daily pass through its doors, or sit chatting on its  worn leather-covered benches, exchanging views on this performance or  that, or on the desirability or difficulty of certain roles. Even while  we were in earnest conference, Director Gatti-Casazza passed through the  room, stopping long enough to say a pleasant word and offer a clasp of  the hand. Mr. Guard, too, flitted by in haste, but had time to give a  friendly greeting.    Mr. Scotti was in genial mood and spoke with enthusiasm of his  activities with a favorite project--his own opera company. To the  question as to whether he found young American singers in too great  haste to come before the public, before they were sufficiently prepared,  thus proving they were superficial in their studies, he replied:    \"No, I do not find this to be the case. As a general rule, young  American singers have a good foundation to build upon. They have good  voices to start with; they are eager to learn and they study carefully.  What they lack most--those who go in for opera I mean--is stage routine  and a knowledge of acting. This, as I have said before, I try to give  them. I do not give lessons in singing to these young aspirants, as I  might in this way gain the enmity of vocal teachers; but I help the  untried singers to act their parts. Of course all depends on the  mentality--how long a process of training the singer needs. The  coloratura requires more time to perfect this manner of singing than  others need; but some are much quicker at it than others.    \"It is well I am blessed with good health, as my task is extremely  arduous. When on tour, I sing every night, besides constantly rehearsing  my company. We are ninety in all, including our orchestra. It is indeed  a great undertaking. I do not do it for money, for I make nothing  personally out of it, and you can imagine how heavy the expenses are;  four thousand dollars a week, merely for transportation. But I do it for  the sake of art, and to spread the love of modern Italian opera over  this great, wonderful country, the greatest country for music that  exists to-day. And the plan succeeds far beyond my hopes; for where we  gave one performance in a place, we now, on our second visit, can give  three--four. Next year we shall go to California.    \"So we are doing our part, both to aid the young singer who sorely needs  experience and to educate the masses and general public to love what is  best in modern Italian opera!\"          IX    =ROSA RAISA=    PATIENCE AND PERSEVERANCE WIN RESULTS      To the present day opera goers the name of Rosa Raisa stands for a  compelling force. In whatever role she appears, she is always a  commanding figure, both physically, dramatically and musically. Her  feeling for dramatic climax, the intensity with which she projects each  character assumed, the sincerity and self forgetfulness of her  naturalistic interpretation, make every role notable. Her voice is a  rich, powerful soprano, vibrantly sweet when at its softest--like a  rushing torrent of passion in intense"]]]
