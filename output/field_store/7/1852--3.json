There  was still a beaten way between the tree-boles, though not overwide,  albeit, a highway, since it pierced the wood.  So thereby he went at a  soft pace for the saving of his horse, and thought but little of all he  had been told of the perils of the way, and not a little of the fair  maid whom he had left behind at the Thorp.    After a while the thick beech-wood gave out, and he came into a place  where great oaks grew, fair and stately, as though some lord's  wood-reeve had taken care that they should not grow over close  together, and betwixt them the greensward was fine, unbroken, and  flowery.  Thereby as he rode he beheld deer, both buck and hart and  roe, and other wild things, but for a long while no man.    The afternoon wore and still he rode the oak wood, and deemed it a  goodly forest for the greatest king on earth.  At last he came to where  another road crossed the way he followed, and about the crossway was  the ground clearer of trees, while beyond it the trees grew thicker,  and there was some underwood of holly and thorn as the ground fell off  as towards a little dale.    There Ralph drew rein, because he doubted in his mind which was his  right road toward the Burg of the Four Friths; so he got off his horse  and abode a little, if perchance any might come by; he looked about  him, and noted on the road that crossed his, and the sward about it,  the sign of many horses having gone by, and deemed that they had passed  but a little while.  So he lay on the ground to rest him and let his  horse stray about and bite the grass; for the beast loved him and would  come at his call or his whistle.    Ralph was drowsy when he lay down, and though he said to himself that  he would nowise go to sleep, yet as oft happens, he had no defence to  make against sleepiness, and presently his hands relaxed, his head fell  aside, and he slept quietly.  When he woke up in a little space of  time, he knew at once that something had awaked him and that he had not  had his sleep out; for in his ears was the trampling of horse-hoofs and  the clashing of weapons and loud speech of men.  So he leapt up  hastily, and while he was yet scarce awake, took to whistling on his  horse; but even therewith those men were upon him, and two came up to  him and laid hold of him; and when he asked them what they would, they  bade him hold his peace.    Now his eyes cleared, and he saw that those men were in goodly  war-gear, and bore coats of plate, and cuir-bouilly, or of bright  steel; they held long spears and were girt with good swords; there was  a pennon with them, green, whereon was done a golden tower, embattled,  amidst of four white ways; and the same token bore many of the men on  their coats and sleeves.  Unto this same pennon he was brought by the  two men who had taken him, and under it, on a white horse, sat a Knight  bravely armed at all points with the Tower and Four Ways on his green  surcoat; and beside him was an ancient man-at-arms, with nought but an  oak wreath on his bare head, and his white beard falling low over his  coat:  but behind these twain a tall young man, also on a white horse  and very gaily clad, upheld the pennon.  On one side of these three  were five men, unarmed, clad in green coats, with a leafless tree done  on them in gold:  they were stout carles, bearded and fierce-faced:  their hands were bound behind their backs and their feet tied together  under their horses' bellies.  The company of those about the Knight,  Ralph deemed, would number ten score men.    So when those twain stayed Ralph before the Knight, he turned to the  old man and said:    \"It is of no avail asking this lither lad if he be of them or no: for  no will be his answer.  But what sayest thou, Oliver?\"    The ancient man drew closer to Ralph and looked at him up and down and  all about; for those two turned him about as if he had been a joint of  flesh on the roasting-jack; and at last he said:    \"His beard is sprouting, else might ye have taken him for a maid of  theirs, one of those of whom we wot.  But to say sooth I seem to know  the fashion of his gear, even as Duke Jacob knew Joseph's tabard.  So  ask him whence he is, lord, and if he lie, then I bid bind him and lead  him away, that we may have a true tale out of him; otherwise let him go  and take his chance; for we will not waste the bread of the Good Town  on him.\"    The Knight looked hard on Ralph, and spake to him somewhat courteously:    \"Whence art thou, fair Sir, and what is thy name? for we have many foes  in the wildwood.\"    Ralph reddened as he answered:  \"I am of Upmeads beyond the down  country; and I pray thee let me be gone on mine errands.  It is meet  that thou deal with thine own robbers and reivers, but not with me.\"    Then cried out one of the bounden men:  \"Thou liest, lad, we be no  robbers.\" But he of the Knight's company who stood by him smote the man  on the mouth and said:  \"Hold thy peace, runagate!  Thou shalt give  tongue to-morrow when the hangman hath thee under his hands.\"    The Knight took no heed of this; but turned to the ancient warrior and  said: \"Hath he spoken truth so far?\"    \"Yea, Sir Aymer,\" quoth Oliver; \"And now meseems I know him better than  he knoweth me.\"    Therewith he turned to Ralph and said:  \"How fareth Long Nicholas, my  lord?\"    Ralph reddened again:  \"He is well,\" said he.    Then said the Knight:  \"Is the young man of a worthy house, Oliver?\"    But ere the elder could speak, Ralph brake in and said: \"Old warrior, I  bid thee not to tell out my name, as thou lovest Nicholas.\"    Old Oliver laughed and said:  \"Well, Nicholas and I have been friends  in a way, as well as foes; and for the sake of the old days his name  shall help thee, young lord.\" Then he said to his Knight:  \"Yea, Sir  Aymer, he is of a goodly house and an ancient; but thou hearest how he  adjureth me.  Ye shall let his name alone.\"    The Knight looked silently on Ralph for a while; then he said: \"Wilt  thou wend with us to the Burg of the Four Friths, fair Sir?  Wert thou  not faring thither?  Or what else dost thou in the Wood Perilous?\"    Ralph turned it over in his mind; and though he saw no cause why he  should not join himself to their company, yet something in his heart  forbade him to rise to the fly too eagerly; so he did but say: \"I am  seeking adventures, fair lord.\"    The Knight smiled:  \"Then mayst thou fill thy budget with them if thou  goest with us,\" quoth he.  Now Ralph did not know how he might gainsay  so many men at arms in the long run, though he were scarce willing to  go; so he made no haste to answer; and even therewith came a man  running, through the wood up from the dale; a long, lean carle, meet  for running, with brogues on his feet, and nought else but a shirt; the  company parted before him to right and left to let him come to the  Knight, as though he had been looked for; and when he was beside him,  the Knight leaned down while the carle spake softly to him and all men  drew out of ear-shot.  And when the carle had given his message the  Knight drew himself straight up in his saddle again and lifted up his  hand and cried out:    \"Oliver!  Oliver! lead on the way thou wottest!  Spur! spur, all men!\"    Therewith he blew one blast from a horn which hung at his saddle-bow;  the runner leapt up behind old Oliver, and the whole company went off  at a smart trot somewhat south-east, slantwise of the cross-roads,  where the wood was nought cumbered with undergrowth; and presently they  were all gone to the last horse-tail, and no man took any more note of  Ralph.        CHAPTER 9    Another Adventure in the Wood Perilous      Ralph left alone pondered a little; and thought that he would by no  means go hastily to the Burg of the Four Friths.  Said he to himself;  This want-way is all unlike to the one near our house at home:  for  belike adventures shall befall here: I will even abide here for an hour  or two; but will have my horse by me and keep awake, lest something hap  to me unawares.    Therewith he whistled for Falcon his horse, and the beast came to him,  and whinnied for love of him, and Ralph smiled and tied him to a  sapling anigh, and himself sat down on the grass, and pondered many  things; as to what folk were about at Upmeads, and how his brethren  were faring; and it was now about five hours after noon, and the sun's  rays fell aslant through the boughs of the noble oaks, and the scent of  the grass and bracken trodden by the horse-hoofs of that company went  up into the warm summer air.  A while he sat musing but awake, though  the faint sound of a little stream in the dale below mingled with all  the lesser noises of the forest did its best to soothe him to sleep  again:  and presently had its way with him; for he leaned his head back  on the bracken, and in a minute or two was sleeping once more and  dreaming some dream made up of masterless memories of past days.    When he awoke again he lay still a little while, wondering where in the  world he was, but as the drowsiness left him, he arose and looked  about, and saw that the sun was sinking low and gilding the oakboles  red.  He stood awhile and watched the gambols of three hares, who had  drawn nigh him while he slept, and now noted him not; and a little way  he saw through the trees a hart and two hinds going slowly from grass  to grass, feeding in the cool eventide; but presently he saw them raise  their heads and amble off down the slope of the little dale, and  therewith he himself turned his face sharply toward the north-west, for  he was fine-eared as well as sharp-eyed, and on a little wind which had  just arisen came down to him the sound of horse-hoofs once more.    So he went up to Falcon and loosed him, and stood by him bridle in  hand, and looked to it that his sword was handy to him: and he  hearkened, and the sound drew nigher and nigher to him."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16921"],[0,"Plague Ship (#10)"],[1,"on the very edge of the reef,  aimed a beam into the bloody waves. If the gorp was affected by this  attack he could not tell, for both attacker and victim could no longer be  seen.    But Ali had better luck in rescuing the Salarik who shared his particular  section of reef, and the native, gashed and spurting blood from a wound  in his thigh, was hauled to safety. While the gorp, coiling too slowly  under the Terran ray, was literally hewn to pieces by the revengeful  knives of the hunter's kin.    The fight broke into a series of individual duels carried on now by the  light of the torches as the evening closed in. The last of the purple  patches had burned away to nothing. Dane crouched by his standard torch,  his eyes fastened on the sea, watching for an ominous vee of ripples  betraying another gorp on its way to launch against the rock barrier.    There was such wild confusion along that line of water sprayed rocks  that he had no idea of how the engagement was going. But so far the  gorp showed no signs of having had enough.    Dane was shaken out of his absorption by another scream. One, he was  sure, which had not come from any Salariki throat. He got to his  feet. Rip was stationed four men beyond him. Yes, the tall  Astrogator-apprentice was there, outlined against torch flare. Ali?  No--there was the assistant Engineer. Weeks? But Weeks was picking his  way back along the reef toward the shore, haste expressed in every line  of his figure. The scream sounded for a second time, freezing the  Terrans.    \"Come back--!\" That was Weeks gesturing violently at the shore and  something floundering in the protecting circle of the reef. The younger  Salariki who had been feeding the fire were now clustered at the water's  edge.    Ali ran and with a leap covered the last few feet, landing reckless knee  deep in the waves. Dane saw light strike on his rod as he swung it in a  wide arc to center on the struggle churning the water into foam. A third  scream died to a moan and then the Salariki dashed into the sea, their  nets spread, drawing back with them through the surf a dark and now quiet  mass.    The fact that at least one gorp had managed to get on the inner side of  the reef made an impression on the rest of the native hunters. After an  uncertain minute or two Groft gave the signal to withdraw--which they did  with grisly trophies. Dane counted seven gorp bodies--which did not  include the prisoner ashore. And more might have slid into the sea to  die. On the other hand two Salariki were dead--one had been drawn into  the sea before Dane's eyes--and at least one was badly wounded. But who  had been pulled down in the shallows--some one sent out from the Queen  with a message?    Dane raced back along the reef, not waiting to pull up his torch, and  before he reached the shore Rip was overtaking him. But the man who lay  groaning on the sand was not from the Queen. The torn and bloodstained  tunic covering his lacerated shoulders had the I-S badge. Ali was already  at work on his wounds, giving temporary first aid from his belt kit. To  all their questions he was stubbornly silent--either he couldn't or  wouldn't answer.    In the end they helped the Salariki rig three stretchers. On one the  largest, the captive gorp, still curled in a round carapace protected  ball, was bound with the net. The second supported the wounded Salarik  clansman and onto the third the Terrans lifted the I-S man.    \"We'll deliver him to his own ship,\" Rip decided. \"He must have tailed us  here as a spy--\" He asked a passing Salarik as to where they could find  the Company spacer.    \"They might just think we are responsible,\" Ali pointed out. \"But I see  your point. If we do pack him back to the Queen and he doesn't make it,  they might say that we fired his rockets for him. All right, boys, let's  up-ship--he doesn't look too good to me.\"    With a torch-bearing Salarik boy as a guide, they hurried along a path  taking in turns the burden of the stretcher. Luckily the I-S ship was  even closer to the sea than the Queen and as they crossed the slagged  ground, congealed by the break fire, they were trotting.    Though the Company ship was probably one of the smallest Inter-Solar  carried on her rosters, it was a third again as large as the Queen--with  part of that third undoubtedly dedicated to extra cargo space. Beside her  their own spacer would seem not only smaller, but battered and worn. But  no Free Trader would have willingly assumed the badges of a Company man,  not even for the command of such a ship fresh from the cradles of a  builder.    When a man went up from the training Pool for his first assignment, he  was sent to the ship where his temperament, training and abilities best  fitted. And those who were designated as Free Traders would never fit  into the pattern of Company men. Of late years the breech between those  who lived under the strict parental control of one of the five great  galaxy wide organizations and those still too much of an individual to  live any life but that of a half-explorer-half-pioneer which was the Free  Trader's, had widened alarmingly. Antagonism flared, rivalry was strong.  But as yet the great Companies themselves were at polite cold war with  one another for the big plums of the scattered systems. The Free Traders  took the crumbs and there was not much disputing--save in cases such as  had arisen on Sargol, when suddenly crumbs assumed the guise of very rich  cake, rich and large enough to attract a giant.    The party from the Queen was given a peremptory challenge as they reached  the other ship's ramp. Rip demanded to see the officer of the watch and  then told the story of the wounded man as far as they knew it. The Eysie  was hurried aboard--nor did his shipmates give a word of thanks.    \"That's that.\" Rip shrugged. \"Let's go before they slam the hatch so hard  they'll rock their ship off her fins!\"    \"Polite, aren't they?\" asked Weeks mildly.    \"What do you expect of Eysies?\" Ali wanted to know. \"To them Free Traders  are just rim planet trash. Let's report back where we are appreciated.\"    They took a short cut which brought them back to the Queen and they filed  up her ramp to make their report to the Captain.    But they were not yet satisfied with Groft and his gorp slayers. No  Salarik appeared for trade in the morning--surprising the Terrans.  Instead a second delegation, this time of older men and a storm priest,  visited the spacer with an invitation to attend Paft's funeral feast, a  rite which would be followed by the formal elevation of Groft to his  father's position, now that he had revenged that parent. And from remarks  dropped by members of the delegation it was plain that the bearing of the  Terrans who had joined the hunting party was esteemed to have been in  highest accord with Salariki tradition.    They drew lots to decide which two must remain with the ship and the rest  perfumed themselves so as to give no offense which might upset their now  cordial relations. Again it was mid-afternoon when the Salariki escort  sent to do them honor waited at the edge of the wood and Mura and Tang  saw them off. With a herald booming before them, they traveled the beaten  earth road in the opposite direction from the trading center, off through  the forest until they came to a wide section of several miles which had  been rigorously cleared of any vegetation which might give cover to a  lurking enemy. In the center of this was a twelve-foot-high stockade of  the bright red, burnished wood which had attracted Weeks on the shore.  Each paling was the trunk of a tree and it had been sharpened at the top  to a wicked point. On the field side was a wide ditch, crossed at the  gate by a bridge, the planking of which might be removed at will. And as  Dane passed over he looked down into the moat that was dry. The Salariki  did not depend upon water for a defense--but on something else which his  experience of the previous night had taught him to respect. There was no  mistaking that shade of purple. The highly inflammable scum the hunters  had burnt from the top of the waves had been brought inland and lay a  greasy blanket some eight feet below. It would only be necessary to toss  a torch on that and the defenders of the stockade would create a wall of  fire to baffle any attackers. The Salariki knew how to make the most of  their world's natural resources.          Chapter VI    DUELIST'S CHALLENGE      Inside the red stockade there was a crowded community. The Salariki  demanded privacy of a kind, and even the unmarried warriors did not share  barracks, but each had a small cubicle of his own. So that the mud brick  and timber erections of one of their clan cities resembled nothing so  much as the comb cells of a busy beehive. Although Paft's was considered  a large clan, it numbered only about two hundred fighting men and their  numerous wives, children and captive servants. Not all of them normally  lived at this center, but for the funeral feasting they had  assembled--which meant a lot of doubling up and tenting out under  makeshift cover between the regular buildings of the town. So that the  Terrans were glad to be guided through this crowded maze to the Great  Hall which was its heart.    As the trading center had been, the hall was a circular enclosure open to  the sky above but divided in wheel-spoke fashion with posts of the red  wood, each supporting a metal basket filled with imflammable material.  Here were no lowly stools or trading tables. One vast circular board,  broken only by a gap at the foot, ran completely around the wall. At the  end opposite the entrance was the high chair of the chieftain, set on a  two step dais. Though the feast had not yet officially begun, the Terrans  saw that the majority of the places were already occupied.    They were led around the perimeter of the enclosure to places not far  from the high seat. Van"]]]
