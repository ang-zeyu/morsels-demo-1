They who could not understand her soul were made  spiritual, as it were, by the magic of her beauty--they who had no heart  for poetry had ears, at least, for the melody of her voice. Seeing her  thus surrounded, purifying and brightening all things with her presence,  Glaucus almost for the first time felt the nobleness of his own  nature--he felt how unworthy of the goddess of his dreams had been his  companions and his pursuits.  A veil seemed lifted from his eyes; he saw  that immeasurable distance between himself and his associates which the  deceiving mists of pleasure had hitherto concealed; he was refined by a  sense of his courage in aspiring to Ione.  He felt that henceforth it  was his destiny to look upward and to soar.  He could no longer breathe  that name, which sounded to the sense of his ardent fancy as something  sacred and divine, to lewd and vulgar ears.  She was no longer the  beautiful girl once seen and passionately remembered--she was already  the mistress, the divinity of his soul.  This feeling who has not  experienced?--If thou hast not, then thou hast never loved.    When Clodius therefore spoke to him in affected transport of the beauty  of Ione, Glaucus felt only resentment and disgust that such lips should  dare to praise her; he answered coldly, and the Roman imagined that his  passion was cured instead of heightened.  Clodius scarcely regretted it,  for he was anxious that Glaucus should marry an heiress yet more richly  endowed--Julia, the daughter of the wealthy Diomed, whose gold the  gamester imagined he could readily divert into his own coffers.  Their  conversation did not flow with its usual ease; and no sooner had Clodius  left him than Glaucus bent his way to the house of Ione.  In passing by  the threshold he again encountered Nydia, who had finished her graceful  task.  She knew his step on the instant.    'You are early abroad?' said she.    'Yes; for the skies of Campania rebuke the sluggard who neglects them.'    'Ah, would I could see them!' murmured the blind girl, but so low that  Glaucus did not overhear the complaint.    The Thessalian lingered on the threshold a few moments, and then guiding  her steps by a long staff, which she used with great dexterity, she took  her way homeward.  She soon turned from the more gaudy streets, and  entered a quarter of the town but little loved by the decorous and the  sober.  But from the low and rude evidences of vice around her she was  saved by her misfortune.  And at that hour the streets were quiet and  silent, nor was her youthful ear shocked by the sounds which too often  broke along the obscene and obscure haunts she patiently and sadly  traversed.    She knocked at the back-door of a sort of tavern; it opened, and a rude  voice bade her give an account of the sesterces.  Ere she could reply,  another voice, less vulgarly accented, said:    'Never mind those petty profits, my Burbo.  The girl's voice will be  wanted again soon at our rich friend's revels; and he pays, as thou  knowest, pretty high for his nightingales' tongues.    'Oh, I hope not--I trust not,' cried Nydia, trembling.  'I will beg from  sunrise to sunset, but send me not there.'    'And why?' asked the same voice.    'Because--because I am young, and delicately born, and the female  companions I meet there are not fit associates for one who--who...'    'Is a slave in the house of Burbo,' returned the voice ironically, and  with a coarse laugh.    The Thessalian put down the flowers, and, leaning her face on her hands,  wept silently.    Meanwhile, Glaucus sought the house of the beautiful Neapolitan. He  found Ione sitting amidst her attendants, who were at work around her.  Her harp stood at her side, for Ione herself was unusually idle, perhaps  unusually thoughtful, that day.  He thought her even more beautiful by  the morning light and in her simple robe, than amidst the blazing lamps,  and decorated with the costly jewels of the previous night: not the less  so from a certain paleness that overspread her transparent hues--not the  less so from the blush that mounted over them when he approached.  Accustomed to flatter, flattery died upon his lips when he addressed  Ione.  He felt it beneath her to utter the homage which every look  conveyed.  They spoke of Greece; this was a theme on which Ione loved  rather to listen than to converse: it was a theme on which the Greek  could have been eloquent for ever.  He described to her the silver olive  groves that yet clad the banks of Ilyssus, and the temples, already  despoiled of half their glories--but how beautiful in decay!  He looked  back on the melancholy city of Harmodius the free, and Pericles the  magnificent, from the height of that distant memory, which mellowed into  one hazy light all the ruder and darker shades.  He had seen the land of  poetry chiefly in the poetical age of early youth; and the associations  of patriotism were blended with those of the flush and spring of life.  And Ione listened to him, absorbed and mute; dearer were those accents,  and those descriptions, than all the prodigal adulation of her  numberless adorers.  Was it a sin to love her countryman? she loved  Athens in him--the gods of her race, the land of her dreams, spoke to  her in his voice!  From that time they daily saw each other.  At the  cool of the evening they made excursions on the placid sea.  By night  they met again in Ione's porticoes and halls.  Their love was sudden,  but it was strong; it filled all the sources of their life.  Heart--brain--sense--imagination, all were its ministers and priests.  As you take some obstacle from two objects that have a mutual  attraction, they met, and united at once; their wonder was, that they  had lived separate so long.  And it was natural that they should so  love.  Young, beautiful, and gifted--of the same birth, and the same  soul--there was poetry in their very union.  They imagined the heavens  smiled upon their affection.  As the persecuted seek refuge at the  shrine, so they recognized in the altar of their love an asylum from the  sorrows of earth; they covered it with flowers--they knew not of the  serpents that lay coiled behind.    One evening, the fifth after their first meeting at Pompeii, Glaucus and  Ione, with a small party of chosen friends, were returning from an  excursion round the bay; their vessel skimmed lightly over the twilight  waters, whose lucid mirror was only broken by the dripping oars.  As the  rest of the party conversed gaily with each other, Glaucus lay at the  feet of Ione, and he would have looked up in her face, but he did not  dare.  Ione broke the pause between them.    'My poor brother,' said she, sighing, 'how once he would have enjoyed  this hour!'    'Your brother!' said Glaucus; 'I have not seen him.  Occupied with you,  I have thought of nothing else, or I should have asked if that was not  your brother for whose companionship you left me at the Temple of  Minerva, in Neapolis?'    'It was.'    'And is he here?'    'He is.    'At Pompeii! and not constantly with you?  Impossible!'    'He has other duties,' answered Ione, sadly; 'he is a priest of Isis.'    'So young, too; and that priesthood, in its laws at least, so severe!'  said the warm and bright-hearted Greek, in surprise and pity. 'What  could have been his inducement?'    'He was always enthusiastic and fervent in religious devotion: and the  eloquence of an Egyptian--our friend and guardian--kindled in him the  pious desire to consecrate his life to the most mystic of our deities.  Perhaps in the intenseness of his zeal, he found in the severity of that  peculiar priesthood its peculiar attraction.'    'And he does not repent his choice?--I trust he is happy.'    Ione sighed deeply, and lowered her veil over her eyes.    'I wish,' said she, after a pause, 'that he had not been so hasty.  Perhaps, like all who expect too much, he is revolted too easily!'    'Then he is not happy in his new condition.  And this Egyptian, was he a  priest himself? was he interested in recruits to the sacred band?    'No.  His main interest was in our happiness.  He thought he promoted  that of my brother.  We were left orphans.'    'Like myself,' said Glaucus, with a deep meaning in his voice.    Ione cast down her eyes as she resumed:    'And Arbaces sought to supply the place of our parent.  You must know  him. He loves genius.'    'Arbaces! I know him already; at least, we speak when we meet.  But for  your praise I would not seek to know more of him.  My heart inclines  readily to most of my kind.  But that dark Egyptian, with his gloomy  brow and icy smiles, seems to me to sadden the very sun. One would think  that, like Epimenides, the Cretan, he had spent forty years in a cave,  and had found something unnatural in the daylight ever afterwards.'    'Yet, like Epimenides, he is kind, and wise, and gentle,' answered Ione.    'Oh, happy that he has thy praise!  He needs no other virtues to make  him dear to me.'    'His calm, his coldness,' said Ione, evasively pursuing the subject,  'are perhaps but the exhaustion of past sufferings; as yonder mountain  (and she pointed to Vesuvius), which we see dark and tranquil in the  distance, once nursed the fires for ever quenched.'    They both gazed on the mountain as Ione said these words; the rest of  the sky was bathed in rosy and tender hues, but over that grey summit,  rising amidst the woods and vineyards that then clomb half-way up the  ascent, there hung a black and ominous cloud, the single frown of the  landscape.  A sudden and unaccountable gloom came over each as they thus  gazed; and in that sympathy which love had already taught them, and  which bade them, in the slightest shadows of emotion, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15659"],[0,"The Beacon Second Reader (#10)"],[1,"out of bits of wood with her knife. She worked  and worked until there were ten sets of the small letters:        a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z    and six sets of the large letters:        A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z    She then made the little tots spell words with her wooden letters. Take  the word \"plum-pudding\" (and who can think of a better one!); the first  little child picked up the letter p, the next l, the next u, the next m,  and so on, until the whole word was spelled.    If a child took up a wrong letter, he was to pay a fine or play no more.    Each morning, with her basket full of wooden letters, Margery went  around from house to house. The little children learned to read very  fast.    Can you see Margery with her basket of letters in this picture?    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    The first house she came to was Farmer Wilson's. See, here it is.    Margery stopped and ran up to the door. Tap, tap, tap.    \"Who is there?\"    \"Only little Goody Two Shoes,\" said Margery, \"come to teach Billy.\"    \"Is that you, little Goody?\" said Mrs. Wilson. \"I am glad to see you.\"    Then out came the little boy.    \"How do, Doody Two Shoes,\" said he, not being able to speak plainly.    Margery took little Billy by the hand and led him to a quiet spot under  a tree. Then she threw the letters on the ground all mixed up together  like this:        z a y w b m p j f x c o q g e k v n i d h r i t u s    Billy picked them up, calling each one by its right name, and put them  all in just their right places. They now looked like this:        a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z    Do you think you could have done as well as little Billy?    The next place Margery came to was Farmer Simpson's, and here it is.    [Illustration]    \"Bowwow, wow,\" said the dog at the door.    \"Be still, sir,\" said Mrs. Simpson. \"Why do you bark at little Two  Shoes? Come, Alice, here is Goody Two Shoes ready to teach you.\"    Then out came the little one.    \"Well, Alice,\" said Two Shoes, \"have you learned your lesson?\"    \"Yes, indeed, I have,\" said the little one, and taking the letters, she  formed them in this way:        ba be bi bo bu da de di do du      fa fe fi fo fu ha he hi ho hu    As she formed them she gave their exact sounds.    The next place Margery came to was Gaffer Cook's house. Here a number of  poor children all came around her at once. These children had been to  her school longer than the first little tots, and could read words and  lines.    This is what Margery gave them to read:    \"He that will thrive must rise by five.\"    \"Truth can be blamed, but cannot be shamed.\"    \"A friend in your need is a friend indeed.\"    \"A wise head makes a close mouth.\"    \"A lie stands upon one leg, but truth upon two.\"    \"A good boy will make a good man.\"    \"Honor your parents and the world will honor you.\"    \"Love your friends and your friends will love you.\"    Did you ever read lines like these in your school reader?      LITTLE GOODY TWO SHOES--IV    At last Margery grew up and was given a real school to teach and a real  schoolroom to teach in. She still used her little wooden letters, and  made the children fetch each one to spell the words.    One day, as Margery was going home from school, she saw some bad boys  who had caught a young crow. She went over to them and gave them a penny  for the poor little bird, and took him home.    Margery called the crow Ralph, and under her care he grew into a very  fine bird indeed. She even taught him to speak and to pick out a few of  the letters.    Some time after this a poor lamb had lost his mother, and the farmer was  about to kill him. Margery bought him and took him home with her to play  with the children. This lamb she called Will, and a pretty fellow he  was. Do look at him. See him run and play with the children.    [Illustration]    The lamb was trained to carry home the books and the slates of the  children who behaved well at school. See what a fine, strong fellow he  is, and how he trudges along.    [Illustration]    Margery also had a present of a little dog. His name was Jumper. Look at  him sitting up and begging in the picture.    Did you ever see a dog with such bright eyes? He almost seems able to  talk.    [Illustration]    Jumper, Jumper, Jumper! He was always playing and jumping about, and  Jumper was a good name for him. His place was just outside the door. See  how he sits, the saucy fellow!    [Illustration]      LITTLE GOODY TWO SHOES--V    One day Jumper came whining into the schoolroom. He took hold of  Margery's dress and pulled and pulled.    \"What do you wish, dear Jumper?\" asked Margery.    But the dog only whined and pulled her toward the door. At last Margery  went outdoors to see what was the matter.    Then Jumper left her and ran back into the schoolroom. He took hold of  the dress of one of the little girls and tugged and tugged. At length  she too followed Jumper to the door.    By this time all the children were on their feet and quickly followed  the teacher out of the schoolroom.    They were none too soon. The last little girl had hardly passed the door  when, with a great crash, the roof fell in.    All the children were safe, but what had become of Margery's dear books  and letters and other things?    Margery did not lose her school. A rich man who lived near ordered the  schoolhouse to be rebuilt at his own expense.    Another gentleman, Sir Charles Jones, having heard of Margery's good  sense, offered her a home if she would teach his daughter. In fact he  finally fell in love with Margery, and they were married in the great  church. And what do you think! On her wedding day, while the bells were  ringing, Margery's brother Tommy came home. He had become the captain of  a great ship. He had sailed to many lands, and he brought her all kinds  of presents. Do you think she deserved to be very happy?    She did not forget the children, you may be sure. A house in the village  was fitted up as a school, and all the boys and girls were taught to  read and write.    _Ascribed to_ GOLDSMITH              ONE STEP AND THEN ANOTHER          One step and then another,        And the longest walk is ended;      One stitch and then another,        And the largest rent is mended.

She said, as she watched their curious flight,      \"Little black things, good night, good night!\"        The horses neighed, and the oxen lowed,      The sheep's \"bleat, bleat!\" came over the road;      All seeming to say, with a quiet delight,      \"Good little girl, good night, good night!\"        She did not say to the sun, \"Good night!\"      Though she saw him there like a ball of light,      For she knew he had God's time to keep      All over the world, and never could sleep.        The tall pink foxglove bowed his head;      The violets curtsied and went to bed;      And good little Lucy tied up her hair,      And said, on her knees, her favorite prayer.        And while on her pillow she softly lay,      She knew nothing more till again it was day;      And all things said to the beautiful sun,      \"Good morning, good morning! our work is begun.\"        LORD HOUGHTON          [Illustration]    DAVID AND GOLIATH--I    Philistines  guarding  Goliath      Long, long ago there lived, in the country of Israel a boy named David.    He was a shepherd boy, and all day long he watched the quiet sheep as  they ate sweet grass on the hillside.    Although David was only a boy, he was tall and strong and brave.    When he knew he was in the right, he feared nothing.    David's quiet life did not last long.    There was a great war between the people of Israel and men called the  Philistines.    All the strong men in David's town went to join the army of Israel.    David could not go, as he had to tend the sheep, but his three older  brothers went to the war.    For a long time David's father heard nothing from his three oldest boys.    At length he called David to him and said, \"Take to your brothers a bag  of this corn and these ten loaves of bread. Find out how your brothers  are, and bring word to me.\"    The next morning David rose very early, and taking the bag of corn and  the loaves of bread, he went to the camp where his brothers were.    The camp of Israel was on the side of a high mountain.    Across the valley from this mountain and on the side of another mountain  was the camp of the Philistines.    After David had come to the camp and had found his brothers, shouts of  anger and fear came from the soldiers.    David looked across the valley to the camp of the Philistines.    There he saw a huge soldier dressed in shining armor.    This giant soldier carried a great spear and shield.    \"Who is that man?\" asked David.    \"Do you not know? That is Goliath,\" said the soldiers. \"Every day he  comes out and dares any man on our side to meet him in battle.\"    \"Does no one of our soldiers dare to meet him?\" asked David.    [Illustration]    \"We have no man so strong as he in our whole army,\" said the soldiers.    The giant from the opposite hillside shouted with a loud voice, and  again dared the army of Israel to choose a man to meet him.    David was a brave boy; he was stirred to anger at the sight of this  great giant.    \"Is not God on the side of our people?\" he asked. \"I will fight with  this man, even though he kill me.\"      DAVID AND GOLIATH--II    The king of"]]]
