Such movement may, sometimes, have become  habitual from one's profession or employment; but in learners, also, there  is often a predisposition to this fault.    Second--It is not unusual to see a speaker use only the lower half of his  arm. This always gives a stiff and constrained manner to delivery. Let the  whole arm move, and let the movement be free and flowing.    Third--As a general rule, let the hand be open, with the fingers slightly  curved. It then seems liberal, communicative, and candid; and, in some  degree, gives that expression to the style of delivery. Of course there  are passages which require the clinched hand, the pointed finger, etc.,  etc.; but these are used to give a particular expression.    Fourth--In the movements of the arm, study variety and the grace of curved  lines.    When a gesture is made with one arm only, the eye should be cast in the  direction of that arm; not at it, but over it.    All speakers employ, more or less, the motions of the head. In reference  to that member, we make but one observation. Avoid the continuous shaking  and bobbing of the head, which is so conspicuous in the action of many  ambitious public speakers.    The beauty and force of all gesture consist in its timely, judicious, and  natural employment, when it can serve to illustrate the meaning or give  emphasis to the force of an important passage. The usual fault of young  speakers is too much action. To emphasize all parts alike, is equivalent  to no emphasis; and by employing forcible gestures on unimportant  passages, we diminish our power to render other parts impressive.        ELOCUTION AND READING. (57)    The business of training youth in elocution, must be commenced in  childhood. The first school is the nursery. There, at least, may be formed  a distinct articulation, which is the first requisite for good speaking.  How rarely is it found in perfection among our orators.    \"Words,\" says one, referring to articulation, should \"be delivered out  from the lips, as beautiful coins, newly issued from the mint; deeply and  accurately impressed, perfectly finished; neatly struck by the proper  organs, distinct, in due succession, and of due weight.\" How rarely do we  hear a speaker whose tongue, teeth, and lips, do their office so perfectly  as to answer to this beautiful description! And the common faults in  articulation, it should be remembered, take their rise from the very  nursery.    Grace in eloquence, in the pulpit, at the bar, can not be separated from  grace in the ordinary manners, in private life, in the social circle, in  the family. It can not well be superinduced upon all the other  acquisitions of youth, any more than that nameless, but invaluable,  quality called good breeding. Begin, therefore, the work of forming the  orator with the child; not merely by teaching him to declaim, but what is  of more consequence, by observing and correcting his daily manners,  motions, and attitudes. You can say, when he comes into your apartment, or  presents you with something, a book or letter, in an awkward and  blundering manner, \"Return, and enter this room again,\" or, \"Present me  that book in a different manner,\" or, \"Put yourself in a different  attitude.\" You can explain to him the difference between thrusting or  pushing out his hand and arm, in straight lines and at acute angles, and  moving them in flowing circular lines, and easy graceful action. He will  readily understand you. Nothing is more true than that the motions of  children are originally graceful; it is by suffering them to be perverted,  that we lay the foundation of invincible awkwardness in later life.    In schools for children, it ought to be a leading object to teach the art  of reading. It ought to occupy threefold more time than it does. The  teachers of these schools should labor to improve themselves. They should  feel that to them, for a time, are committed the future orators of the  land.    It is better that a girl should return from school a first-rate reader,  than a first-rate performer on the pianoforte. The accomplishment, in its  perfection, would give more pleasure. The voice of song is not sweeter  than the voice of eloquence; and there may be eloquent readers, as well as  eloquent speakers. We speak of perfection in this art: and it is  something, we must say in defense of our preference, which we have never  yet seen. Let the same pains be devoted to reading, as are required to  form an accomplished performer on an instrument; let us have, as the  ancients had, the formers of the voice, the music masters of the reading  voice; let us see years devoted to this accomplishment, and then we should  be prepared to stand the comparison.    Reading is indeed, a most intellectual accomplishment. So is music, too,  in its perfection. We do by no means undervalue this noble and most  delightful art, to which Socrates applied himself even in his old age. But  one recommendation of the art of reading is, that it requires a constant  exercise of mind. It involves, in its perfection, the whole art of  criticism on language. A man may possess a fine genius without being a  perfect reader; but he can not be a perfect reader without genius.    ON MODULATION. (59)    FROM LLOYD.      'T is not enough the voice' be sound and clear',    'T is modulation' that must charm the ear.    When desperate heroes grieve with tedious moan,    And whine their sorrows in a seesaw tone,    The same soft sounds of unimpassioned woes,    Can only make the yawning hearers doze.      The voice all modes of passion can express    That marks the proper word with proper stress:    But none emphatic can that speaker call,    Who lays an equal emphasis on all.      Some o'er the tongue the labored measure roll,    Slow and deliberate as the parting toll;    Point every stop, mark every pause so strong,    Their words like stage processions stalk along.      All affectation but creates disgust;    And e'en in speaking, we may seem too just.    In vain for them' the pleasing measure flows,    Whose recitation runs it all to prose:    Repeating what the poet sets not down,    The verb disjointing from its favorite noun,    While pause, and break, and repetition join    To make it discord in each tuneful line'.      Some' placid natures fill the allotted scene    With lifeless drawls, insipid and serene;    While others' thunder every couplet o'er,    And almost crack your ears with rant and roar;    More nature oft, and finer strokes are shown    In the low whisper than tempestuous tone;    And Hamlet's hollow voice and fixed amaze,    More powerful terror to the mind conveys    Than he, who, swollen with impetuous rage,    Bullies the bulky phantom of the stage.      He who, in earnest studies o'er his part,    Will find true nature cling about his heart.    The modes of grief are not included all    In the white handkerchief and mournful drawl:    A single look' more marks the internal woe,    Than all the windings of the lengthened Oh'!          MCGUFFEY'S SIXTH READER. (61)        MCGUFFEY'S SIXTH READER. (63)      SELECTIONS FOR READING.      I. ANECDOTE OF THE DUKE OF NEWCASTLE.    A laughable story was circulated during the administration of the old Duke  of Newcastle, and retailed to the public in various forms. This nobleman,  with many good points, was remarkable for being profuse of his promises on  all occasions, and valued himself particularly on being able to anticipate  the words or the wants of the various persons who attended his levees,  before they uttered a word. This sometimes led him into ridiculous  embarrassment; and it was this proneness to lavish promises, which gave  occasion for the following anecdote:    At the election of a certain borough in Cornwall, where the opposite  interests were almost equally poised, a single vote was of the highest  importance. This object the Duke, by well applied argument and personal  application, at length attained; and the gentleman he recommended, gained  the election. In the warmth of gratitude, his grace poured forth  acknowledgments and promises without ceasing, on the fortunate possessor  of the casting vote; called him his best and dearest friend; protested,  that he should consider himself as forever indebted to him; and that he  would serve him by night or by day.    The Cornish voter, who was an honest fellow, and would not have thought  himself entitled to any reward, but for such a torrent of acknowledgments,  thanked the Duke for his kindness, and told him the supervisor of excise  was old and infirm, and, if he would have the goodness to recommend his  son-in-law to the commissioners, in case of the old man's death, he should  think himself and his family bound to render his grace every assistance in  their power, on any future occasion.    \"My dear friend, why do you ask for such a trifling employment?\" exclaimed  his grace; \"your relative shall have it the moment the place is vacant, if  you will but call my attention to it.\"    \"But how shall I get admitted to you, my lord? For in London, I  understand, it is a very difficult business to get a sight of you great  folks, though you are so kind and complaisant to us in the country.\"    \"The instant the man dies,\" replied the Duke, \"set out posthaste for  London; drive directly to my house, and, be it by night or by day, thunder  at the door; I will leave word with my porter to show you upstairs  directly; and the employment shall be disposed of according to your  wishes.\"    The parties separated; the Duke drove to a friend's house in the  neighborhood, without a wish or desire to see his new acquaintance till  that day seven years; but the memory of the Cornish elector, not being  burdened with such a variety of objects, was more retentive. The  supervisor died a few months after, and the Duke's humble friend,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16767"],[0,"Half-hours with the Telescope (#10)"],[1,"the same field  with these are seen many other stars.    The stars [gamma]^{1} and [gamma]^{2} may also be seen in a single  field, the distance between them being about half the moon's mean  diameter. The former is quadruple, the components being yellow, bluish,  pale blue, and blue.    Turn next to the stars [beta] and [gamma] Lyrae, the former a multiple,  the latter an unequal double star. It is not, however, in these respects  that these stars are chiefly interesting, but for their variability. The  variability of [gamma] has not indeed been fully established, though it  is certain that, having once been less bright, [gamma] is now  considerably brighter than [beta]. The change, however, may be due to  the variation of [beta] alone. This star is one of the most remarkable  variables known. Its period is 12d. 21h. 53m. 10s. In this time it  passes from a maximum brilliancy--that of a star of the 3.4  magnitude--to a minimum lustre equal to that of a star of the 4.3  magnitude, thence to the same maximum brilliancy as before, thence to  another minimum of lustre--that of a star of the 4.5 magnitude--and so  to its maximum lustre again, when the cycle of changes recommences.  These remarkable changes seem to point to the existence of two unequal  dark satellites, whose dimensions bear a much greater proportion to  those of the bright components of [beta] Lyrae than the dimensions of the  members of the Solar System bear to those of the sun. In this case, at  any rate, the conjecture hazarded about Algol, that the star revolves  around a dark central orb, would be insufficient to account for the  observed variation.    Nearly midway between [beta] and [gamma] lies the wonderful ring-nebula  57 M, of which an imperfect idea will be conveyed by the last figure of  Plate 3. This nebula was discovered in 1772, by Darquier, at Toulouse.  It is seen as a ring of light with very moderate telescopic power. In a  good 3-1/2-inch telescope the nebula exhibits a mottled appearance and a  sparkling light. Larger instruments exhibit a faint light within the  ring; and in Lord Rosse's great Telescope \"wisps of stars\" are seen  within, and faint streaks of light stream from the outer border of the  ring. This nebula has been subjected to spectrum-analysis by Mr.  Huggins. It turns out to be a gaseous nebula! In fact, ring-nebulae--of  which only seven have been detected--seem to belong to the same class as  the planetary nebulae, all of which exhibit the line-spectrum indicative  of gaseity. The brightest of the three lines seen in the spectrum of the  ring-nebula in Lyra presents a rather peculiar appearance, \"since it  consists,\" says Mr. Huggins, \"of two bright dots, corresponding to  sections of the ring, and between these there is not darkness, but an  excessively faint line joining them. This observation makes it probable  that the faint nebulous matter occupying the central portion is similar  in constitution to that of the ring.\"    The constellation Hercules also contains many very interesting objects.  Let us first inspect a nebula presenting a remarkable contrast with that  just described. I refer to the nebula 13 M, known as Halley's nebula  (Plate 3). This nebula is visible to the naked eye, and in a good  telescope it is a most wonderful object: \"perhaps no one ever saw it for  the first time without uttering a shout of wonder.\" It requires a very  powerful telescope completely to resolve this fine nebula, but the  outlying streamers may be resolved with a good 3-inch telescope. Sir W.  Herschel considered that the number of the stars composing this  wonderful object was at least 14,000. The accepted views respecting  nebulae would place this and other clusters far beyond the limits of our  sidereal system, and would make the component stars not very unequal (on  the average) to our own sun. It seems to me far more probable, on the  contrary, that the cluster belongs to our own system, and that its  components are very much smaller than the average of separate stars.  Perhaps the whole mass of the cluster does not exceed that of an average  first-magnitude star.    The nebulae 92 M and 50 H may be found, after a little searching, from  the positions indicated in the map. They are both well worthy of study,  the former being a very bright globular cluster, the latter a bright and  large round nebula. The spectra of these, as of the great cluster,  resemble the solar spectrum, being continuous, though, of course, very  much fainter.    The star [delta] Herculis (seen at the bottom of the map) is a wide and  easy double--a beautiful object. The components, situated as shown in  Plate 3, are of the fourth and eighth magnitude, and coloured  respectively greenish-white and grape-red.    The star [kappa] Herculis is not shown in the map, but may be very  readily found, lying between the two gammas, [gamma] Herculis and  [gamma] Serpentis (_see_ Frontispiece, Map 2), rather nearer the latter.  It is a wide double, the components of fifth and seventh magnitude, the  larger yellowish-white, the smaller ruddy yellow.[5]    Ras Algethi, or [alpha] Herculis, is also beyond the limits of the map,  but may be easily found by means of Map 2, Frontispiece. It is, properly  speaking, a multiple star. Considered as a double, the arrangement of  the components is that shown in Plate 3. The larger is of magnitude  3-1/2, the smaller of magnitude 5-1/2; the former orange, the latter  emerald. The companion stars are small, and require a good telescope to  be well seen. Ras Algethi is a variable, changing from magnitude 3 to  magnitude 3-1/2 in a period of 66-1/3 days.    The star [rho] Herculis is a closer double. The components are 3\".7  apart, and situated as shown in Plate 3. The larger is of magnitude 4,  the smaller 5-1/2; the former bluish-white, the latter pale emerald.    There are other objects within the range of our map which are well  worthy of study. Such are [mu] Draconis, a beautiful miniature of  Castor; [gamma]^{1} and [gamma]^{2} Draconis, a wide double, the  distance between the components being nearly 62\" (both grey); and  [gamma]^{1} and [gamma]^{2} Coronae, a naked-eye double, the components  being 6' apart, and each double with a good 3-inch telescope.    We turn, however, to another region of the sky. Low down, towards the  south is seen the small constellation Corvus, recognised by its  irregular quadrilateral of stars. Of the two upper stars, the left-hand  one is Algorab, a wide double, the components placed as in Plate 3,  23\".5 apart, the larger of magnitude 3, the smaller 8-1/2, the colours  pale yellow and purple.    There is a red star in this neighbourhood which is well worth looking  for. To the right of Corvus is the constellation Crater, easily  recognised as forming a tolerably well-marked small group. The star  Alkes, or [alpha] Crateris, must first be found. It is far from being  the brightest star in the constellation, and may be assumed to have  diminished considerably in brilliancy since it was entitled [alpha] by  Bayer. It will easily be found, however, by means of the observer's star  maps. If now the telescope be directed to Alkes, there will be found,  following him at a distance of 42.5 s, and about one minute southerly, a  small red star, R. Crateris. Like most red stars, this one is a  variable. A somewhat smaller blue star may be seen in the same field.    There is another red star which may be found pretty easily at this  season. First find the stars [eta] and [omicron] Leonis, the former  forming with Regulus (now lying towards the south-west, and almost  exactly midway between the zenith and the horizon) the handle of the  Sickle in Leo, the other farther off from Regulus towards the right, but  lower down. Now sweep from [omicron] towards [eta] with a low power.[6]  There will be found a sixth-magnitude star about one-fourth of the way  from [omicron] to [eta]. South, following this, will be found a group of  four stars, of which one is crimson. This is the star R Leonis. Like R  Crateris and R Leporis it is variable.    Next, let the observer turn towards the south again. Above Corvus, in  the position shown in the Frontispiece, there are to be seen five stars,  forming a sort of wide V with somewhat bowed legs. At the angle is the  star [gamma] Virginis, a noted double. In 1756 the components were 6-1/2  seconds apart. They gradually approached till, in 1836, they could not  be separated by the largest telescopes. Since then they have been  separating, and they are now 4-1/2 seconds apart, situated as shown in  Plate 3. They are nearly equal in magnitude (4), and both pale yellow.    The star [gamma] Leonis is a closer and more beautiful double. It will  be found above Regulus, and is the brightest star on the blade of the  Sickle. The components are separated by about 3-1/5 seconds, the larger  of the second, the smaller of the fourth magnitude; the former  yellow-orange, the latter greenish-yellow.    Lastly, the star [iota] Leonis may be tried. It will be a pretty severe  test for our observer's telescope, the components being only 2\".4 apart,  and the smaller scarcely exceeding the eighth magnitude. The brighter  (fourth magnitude) is pale yellow, the other light blue.          CHAPTER IV.    A HALF-HOUR WITH BOOTES, SCORPIO, OPHIUCHUS, ETC.      We now commence a series of observations suited to the third quarter of  the year, and to the following hours:--Ten o'clock on the 22nd of July;  nine on the 8th of August; eight on the 23rd of August; seven on the 8th  of October; and intermediate hours on days intermediate to these.    We look first for the Great Bear towards the north-west, and thence find  the Pole-star. Turning towards the north we see Capella and [beta]  Aurigae low down and slightly towards the left of the exact north point.
