Starvation at  the outset is reduced to a minimum.    It is interesting to note, too, that anticipations of higher types, so  to speak, often occur among lower races. An animal here and there  among the simpler forms hits upon some device essentially similar to  that of some higher group with which it is really quite unrelated. For  example, those who have read my account of the common earwig (given in  the sixth chapter of \"Flashlights on Nature\") will recollect how that  lowly insect sits on her eggs much as a hen does, and brings up her  brood of callow grubs as if they were chickens. In much the same way,  anticipations of the mammalian type occur pretty frequently among  lower animals. Our commonest English lizard, for example, which  frequents moors and sandhills, does not lay or deposit its eggs at  all, but hatches them out in its own body, and so apparently brings  them forth alive: while among snakes, the same habit occurs in the  adder or viper. The very name _viper_, indeed, is a corruption of  _vivipara_, the snake which produces living young. Still more closely  do some birds resemble mammals in the habit of secreting a sort of  milk for the sustenance of their nestlings. Most people think the  phrase \"pigeon's milk\" is much like the phrase \"the horse-marines,\" a  burlesque name for an absurd and impossible monstrosity. But it is  nothing of the sort: it answers to a real fact in the economy of  certain doves, which eat grain or seeds, grind and digest it in their  own gizzards into a fine soft pulp or porridge, and then feed their  young with it from their crops and beaks. This is thus a sort of  bird-like imitation of milk. Only the cow or the goat takes grass or  leaves, chews, swallows, and digests them, and manufactures from them  in her own body that much more nutritive substance, milk, with which  all mammals feed their infant offspring.    Now, after this rather long preamble, I am going to show you in this  present article a few other examples of special care taken of the  young in certain quarters where it might be least expected. Fish are  not creatures from which we look for marked domestic virtues: yet we  may find them there abundantly. Let us begin with that familiar friend  of our childhood, the common English stickleback.    Which of us cannot look back in youth to the mysteries of the  stickleback fisheries? Captains courageous, we sailed forth with bent  pin and piece of thread, to woo the wily quarry with half an inch of  chopped earthworm. For stickleback abound in every running stream and  pond in England. They are beautiful little creatures, too, when you  come to examine them, great favorites in the fresh-water aquarium; the  male in particular is exquisitely colored, his hues growing brighter  and his sheen more conspicuous at the pairing season. There are many  species of sticklebacks--in England we have three very different  kinds--but all are alike in one point which gives them their common  name, that is to say, in their aggressive and protective prickliness.  They are armed against all comers. The dorsal fin is partly replaced  in the whole family by strong spines or \"stickles,\" which differ in  number in the different species. One of our English sorts is a lover  of salt water: he lives in the sea, especially off the Cornish coast,  and has fifteen stickles or spines; on which account he is commonly  known as the Fifteen-spined Stickleback; our other two sorts belong to  fresher waters, and are known as the Ten-spined and the Three-spined  respectively.    The special peculiarity of the male stickleback consists in the fact  that he is, above all things, a model father. In his acute sense of  parental responsibility he has few equals. When spring comes round, he  first exhibits his consciousness of his coming charge by suddenly  enduing himself in a glowing coat of many colors and of iridescent  brilliancy. That is in order to charm the eyes of the prospective  mate, or rather mates, for I may as well confess the sad truth at once  that our amiable friend is a good parent but an abandoned polygamist.  We all know that       \"In the spring a fuller crimson comes upon the robin's breast;      In the spring the wanton lapwing gets himself another crest;      In the spring a livelier iris changes on the burnish'd dove;      In the spring a young man's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love.\"    Not to be out of the fashion, therefore, the romantic stickleback does  precisely the same thing as all these distinguished and poetical  compeers. And he does it for the same reason, too; because he wants to  get himself an appropriate partner. \"There is a great deal of human  nature in man,\" it has been said: I am always inclined to add, \"And  there is a great deal of human nature in plants and animals.\" The more  we know of our dumb relations, the more closely do we realize the  kinship between us. Fish in the spring are like young men at a  fair--all eager for the attention of their prospective partners.    [Illustration: NO. 1. FEMALE STICKLEBACK ABOUT TO ENTER NEST.]    The first care of the male stickleback, when he has acquired his  courting suit, is to build a suitable home for his future wives and  children. So he picks up stems of grass and water-weeds with his  mouth, and weaves them deftly into a compact nest as perfect as a  bird's, though some what different in shape and pattern, it rather  resembles a barrel, open at both ends, as though the bottom were  knocked out: this form is rendered necessary because the eggs, when  laid, have to be constantly aerated by passing a current of water  through the nest as I shall describe hereafter. No. 1 shows us such a  nest when completed, with the female stickleback loitering about  undecided as to whether or not she shall plunge and enter it. You  will observe that the fabric is woven round a fixed support of some  waving water-weeds; but the cunning little architect does not trust in  this matter to his textile skill alone; he cements the straws and  other materials together with a gummy mortar of mucous threads  secreted for the purpose by his internal organs.    [Illustration: NO. 2. FEMALE STICKLEBACK LAYING EGGS IN NEST.]    As soon as the building operations are fully completed, the eager  little householder sallies forth into his pond or brook in search of  a mate who will come and stock his neatly-built home for him. At this  stage of the proceedings, his wedding-garment becomes even more  brilliant and glancing than ever; he gleams in silver and changeful  gems; when he finds his lady-love, he dances round her, \"mad with  excitement,\" as Darwin well phrased it, looking his handsomest and  best with his lustrous colours glistening like an opal. If she will  listen to his suit, he grows wild with delight, and coaxes her into  the nest with most affectionate endearments. In No. 2, as you  perceive, the mate of his choice has been induced to enter, and is  laying her eggs in the dainty home his care has provided for her. The  father fish, meanwhile dances and capers around, in a _pas de  triomphe_ at the success of his endeavors.    One wife, however, does not suffice to fill the nest with eggs; and  the stickleback is a firm believer in the advantages of large  families. So, as soon as his first mate has laid all her spawn, he  sets out once more in search of another. Thus he goes on until the  home is quite full of eggs, bringing back one wife after another, in  proportion to his success in wooing and fighting. For, like almost all  polygamists, your stickleback is a terrible fighter. The males join  wager of battle with one another for possession of their mates; in  their fierce duels they make fearful use of the formidable spines on  their backs, sometimes entirely ripping up and cutting to pieces their  ill-fated adversary. The spines thus answer to the spurs of the  gamecock or the antlers of the deer; they are masculine weapons in the  struggle for mates. Indeed, you may take it for granted that brilliant  colors and decorative adjuncts in animals almost invariably go with  irascible tempers, pugnacious habits, and the practice of fighting for  the possession of the harem. The consequence is, with the  sticklebacks, that many males get killed during the struggle for  supremacy, so that the survivors wed half a dozen wives each, like  little Turks that they are in their watery seraglios. Only the most  beautiful and courageous fish succeed in gaining a harem of their own:  and thus the wager of battle tells in the end for the advantage of the  race, by eliminating the maimed, the ugly, and the cowardly, and  encouraging the strong, the handsome, the enterprising, and the  valiant. This is nature's way of preventing degeneracy.    In No. 3 the nest is seen full of eggs, and the excellent father now  comes out in his best light as their guardian and protector. He  watches over them with ceaseless care, freeing them from parasites,  and warding off the attacks of would-be enemies who desire to devour  them, even though the intruder be several times his own size. The  spines on his back here stand him once more in good stead: for small  as he is, the stickleback is not an antagonist to be lightly despised:  he can inflict a wound which a perch or a trout knows how to estimate  at its full value. But that is not all the good parent's duty. He  takes the eggs out of the nest every now and then with his snout, airs  them a little in the fresh water outside, and then replaces and  rearranges them, so that all may get a fair share of oxygen and may  hatch out about simultaneously. It is this question of oxygen, indeed,  which gives the father fish all the greatest trouble. That necessary  of life is dissolved in water in very small quantities; and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18281"],[0,"An Account of the Proceedings on the Trial of Susan B. Anthony, on the Charge of (#10)"],[1,"horlton_, appellant, _vs. Lings_, respondent, came before  the Court of Common Pleas in England in 1869. It was an appeal from the  decision of the revising barrister, for the borough of Manchester, to  the effect \"that Mary Abbott, being a woman, was not entitled to be  placed on the register.\" Her right was perfect in all respects excepting  that of sex. The court, after a very full and able discussion of the  subject, sustained the decision of the revising barrister, denying to  women the right to be placed on the register, and consequently denying  their right to vote. The decision rested upon the peculiar phraseology  of several Acts of Parliament, and the point decided has no  applicability here. My object in referring to the case has been to call  attention to the fact stated by the reporter, _that appeals of 5,436  other women were consolidated and decided with this_. No better evidence  could be furnished of the extent and earnestness of the claim of women  in England to exercise the elective franchise.--_Law Rep. Com. Pleas,  4-374._    I infer, without being able to say how the fact is, that the votes given  by women, as mentioned in the newspapers, were given at municipal  elections merely, and that the cases decided by the Court of Common  Pleas relate to elections for members of Parliament.    Another objection is, that the right to hold office must attend the  right to vote, and that women are not qualified to discharge the duties  of responsible offices.    I beg leave to answer this objection by asking one or more questions.  How many of the male bipeds who do our voting are qualified to hold high  offices? How many of the large class to whom the right of voting is  supposed to have been secured by the fifteenth amendment, are qualified  to hold office?    Whenever the qualifications of persons to discharge the duties of  responsible offices is made the test of their right to vote, and we are  to have a competitive examination on that subject, open to all  claimants, my client will be content to enter the lists, and take her  chances among the candidates for such honors.    But the practice of the world, and our own practice, give the lie to  this objection. Compare the administration of female sovereigns of great  kingdoms, from Semiramis to Victoria, with the average administration of  male sovereigns, and which will suffer by the comparison? How often have  mothers governed large kingdoms, as regents, during the minority of  their sons, and governed them well? Such offices as the \"sovereigns\" who  rule them in this country have allowed women to hold (they having no  voice on the subject), they have discharged the duties of with ever  increasing satisfaction to the public; and Congress has lately passed  an act, making the official bonds of married women valid, so that they  could be appointed to the office of postmaster.    The case of _Olive vs. Ingraham (7 Modern Rep. 263)_ was an action  brought to try the title to an office. On the death of the sexton of the  parish of St. Butolph, the place was to be filled by election, the  voters being the housekeepers who \"paid Scot and lot\" in the parish. The  widow of the deceased sexton (Sarah Bly) entered the lists against  Olive, the plaintiff in the suit, and received 169 indisputable votes,  and 40 votes given by women who were \"housekeepers, and paid to church  and poor.\" The plaintiff had 174 indisputable votes, and 22 votes given  by such women as voted for Mrs. Bly. Mrs. Bly was declared elected. The  action was brought to test two questions: 1. Whether women were legal  voters; and 2. Whether a woman was capable of holding the office. The  case was four times argued in the King's Bench, and all the judges  delivered opinions, holding that the women were competent voters; that  the widow was properly elected, and could hold the office.    In the course of the discussion it was shown that women had held many  offices, those of constable, church warden, overseer of the poor, keeper  of the \"gate house\" (a public prison), governess of a house of  correction, keeper of castles, sheriffs of counties, and high constable  of England.    If women are legally competent to hold minor offices, I would be glad to  have the rule of law, or of propriety, shown which should exclude them  from higher offices, and which marks the line between those which they  may and those which they may not hold.    Another objection is that women cannot serve as soldiers. To this I  answer that capacity for military service has never been made a test of  the right to vote. If it were, young men from sixteen to twenty-one  would be entitled to vote, and old men from sixty and up-wards would  not. If that were the test, some women would present much stronger  claims than many of the male sex.    Another objection is that engaging in political controversies is not  consistent with the feminine character. Upon that subject, women  themselves are the best judges, and if political duties should be found  inconsistent with female delicacy, we may rest assured that women will  either effect a change in the character of political contests, or  decline to engage in them. This subject may be safely left to their  sense of delicacy and propriety.    If any difficulty on this account should occur, it may not be impossible  to receive the votes of women at their places of residence. This method  of voting was practiced in ancient Rome under the republic; and it will  be remembered that when the votes of the soldiers who were fighting our  battles in the Southern States were needed to sustain their friends at  home, no difficulty was found in the way of taking their votes at their  respective camps.    I humbly submit to your honor, therefore, that on the constitutional  grounds to which I have referred, Miss Anthony had a lawful right to  vote; that her vote was properly received and counted; that the first  section of the fourteenth amendment secured to her that right, and did  not need the aid of any further legislation.    But conceding that I may be in error in supposing that Miss Anthony had  a right to vote, she has been guilty of no crime, if she voted in good  faith believing that she had such right.    This proposition appears to me so obvious, that were it not for the  severity to my client of the consequences which may follow a conviction,  I should not deem it necessary to discuss it.    To make out the offence, it is incumbent on the prosecution to show  affirmatively, not only that the defendant knowingly voted, but that she  so voted _knowing that she had no right to vote_. That is, the term  \"knowingly,\" applies, not to the fact of voting, but to the fact of  _want of right_. Any other interpretation of the language would be  absurd. We cannot conceive of a case where a party could vote without  knowledge of the fact of voting, and to apply the term \"knowingly\" to  the more act of voting, would make nonsense of the statute. This word  was inserted as defining the essence of the offence, and it limits the  criminality to cases where the voting is not only without right, but  where it is done wilfully, with a _knowledge that it is without right_.  Short of that there is no offence within the statute. This would be so  upon well established principles, even if the word \"knowingly\" had been  omitted, but that word was inserted to prevent the possibility of doubt  on the subject, and to furnish security against the inability of stupid  or prejudiced judges or jurors, to distinguish between wilful wrong and  innocent mistake. If the statute had been merely, that \"if at any  election for representative in Congress any person shall vote without  having a lawful right to vote, such person shall be deemed guilty of a  crime,\" there could have been justly no conviction under it, without  proof that the party voted _knowing_ that he had not a right to vote. If  he voted innocently supposing he had the right to vote, but had not, it  would not be an offence within the statute. An innocent mistake is not a  crime, and no amount of judicial decisions can make it such.    Mr. Bishop says, (1 Cr. Law, Sec.205): \"There can be no crime unless _a  culpable intent_ accompanies the criminal act.\" The same author, (1 Cr.  Prac. Sec.521), repeated in other words, the same idea: \"In order to  render a party criminally responsible, _a vicious will_ must concur with  a wrongful act.\"    I quote from a more distinguished author: \"_Felony is always accompanied  with an evil intention, and therefore shall not be imputed to a mere  mistake, or misanimadversion_, as where persons break open a door, in  order to execute a warrant, which will not justify such proceeding:  _Affectio enim tua nomen imponit operi tuo: item crimen non contrahitur  nisi nocendi, voluntas intercedat_,\" which, as I understand, may read:  \"For your volition puts the name upon your act; and _a crime is not  committed unless the will of the offender takes part in it_.\"              1 Hawk. P.C., p. 99, Ch. 85, Sec.3.    This quotation by Hawkins is, I believe, from Bracton, which carries the  principle back to a very early period in the existence of the common  law. It is a principle, however, which underlies all law, and must have  been recognized at all times, wherever criminal law has been  administered, with even the slightest reference to the principles of  common morality and justice.    I quote again on this subject from Mr. Bishop: \"The doctrine of _the  intent_ as it prevails in the criminal law, is necessarily _one of the  foundation principles of public justice_. There is only one criterion by  which the guilt of man is to be tested. It is whether the mind is  criminal. Criminal law relates only to crime. And neither in  philosophical speculation, nor in religious or moral sentiment, would  any people in any age allow that a man should be deemed guilty unless  his mind was so. It is, therefore, a principle of our"]]]
