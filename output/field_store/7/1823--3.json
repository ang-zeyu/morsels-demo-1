It is his office to  regulate the solemnities, and emblazon the arms of the sovereign,  knights, and officers of the most noble order of the Garter.  Garter-King-at-Arms likewise presides over all heraldic ceremonies of  the Court. His crown of gold is formed with oak leaves, one shorter  than the other, springing from a circlet of gold, having engraved upon  it the words \"MISERERE MEI DEUS.\" His tabard, as principal herald, is  of crimson velvet, splendidly embroidered with the arms of England.    Clarencieux and Norroy are called provincial kings-at-arms, the former  regulating all things connected with Heraldry in the provinces south  of the Trent; the latter in the provinces north of the Trent. They  have likewise crowns; and though the office of herald is not of so  much importance now as it was formerly, it is still considered a post  of great honour and emolument.    There are eight heralds that are not kings-at-arms. Their tabards  are of silk, embroidered with the royal arms. They are called York,  Lancaster, Somerset, Richmond, Chester, and Windsor. George the First  created a new herald called Hanover, and another called Gloucester.    The kings-at-arms, heralds, and pursuivants, form the Heralds'  College, by whom all matters connected with the coats of arms of every  gentleman in the kingdom are arranged and determined.    HILTED. The handle of a sword tinctured.    [Illustration: Hilted]    Ex. Argent, a sword proper couped, hilted or.    [Illustration: HONOUR POINT]    HONOUR POINT. That part of the shield between the precise middle chief  and the fess point. In the annexed example the large dot in the centre  shows the fess point; the point within the letter D, the _honour  point_. See p. 6. [CHAP. II.]    HORNED. This term is used to denote that the horn of a unicorn is of a  different tincture from his body.    [Illustration: Horned]    Ex. Azure, three unicorns' heads proper, erased, horned or.    HUMETTY. A term used to denote an ordinary, parts of which are couped  or cut off, so that it does not touch the edges of the shield.    [Illustration: Humetty]    Ex. Argent, a fess humetty gules, between three mullets sable.    [Illustration: HURTS]    HURTS. Blue roundlets: the colour is expressed in the name; therefore  the tincture is not otherwise named in emblazoning a coat of arms.    [Illustration: Spearhead imbued.]    IMBUED. Weapons spotted with blood are said to be imbued. The example  shows a spearhead imbued.    IMPALED. Two coats of arms, conjoined paleways, in one shield.    [Illustration: Impaled]    Ex. Argent, a fess gules, impaled with argent, a bend azure. See p.  38. [CHAP. VI.]    INCRESCENT. The new moon, with her horns turned towards the dexter  side of the shield.    [Illustration: Increscent]    Ex. Azure, a moon increscent argent.    INDENTED. A serrated figure, much smaller than the dancette.    [Illustration: Indented]    Ex. Or, a chief gules, indented.    INESCUTCHEON. The name given to small escutcheons forming a bearing of  a coat of arms.    [Illustration: Inescutcheon]    Ex. Argent, three inescutcheons gules.    INVECTED. A line formed with small semicircles, with the points turned  inward. Any ordinary drawn with this line is called invected.    [Illustration: Invected]    Ex. Argent, a bend gules, invected between two hurts.    ISSUANT, or ISSUING. Rays or other charges proceeding from any part of  the escutcheon. See RAY.    KNIGHT. A title of honour conferred upon a subject for eminent  services performed in war. In the course of time, knights that had  gained riches and high titles formed societies under the control and  direction of their monarchs in every part of Europe. The limits of  this work will only permit us to notice the orders of knighthood  introduced into England.    The KNIGHTS-BACHELORS were the earliest order of knighthood in  England. The title was conferred for services in war. It was merely  personal, and, like the knighthood conferred upon individuals at the  present time, did not descend to their posterity.    [Illustration: Knights-Banneret]    KNIGHTS-BANNERET. This ancient and honourable order has become  extinct. It obtained the title of banneret from the knights having  the right of having a square banner borne before them on the field  of battle, and at jousts and tournaments. Sir W. Segar gives the  following account of the creation of a knight-banneret:--\"It is a  military order, and can only be conferred upon persons that have  performed some heroic act in the field. When this action is known to  the king, or general of the army, he commands the attendance of the  gallant warrior, who is led, between two knights, into the presence of  the king or general with his pennon of arms in his hand, and there  the heralds proclaim his merit, and declare him fit to become a  knight-banneret, and thenceforth to display a banner in the field.  Then the king or general causes the point of the pennon to be cut off  to make it square; it is then placed at the top of his lance, and the  new-made knight returns to his tent, the trumpets sounding before  him.\" Knights-banneret were certainly created in the reign of Edward  I., but how long before that time it is impossible to tell.    KNIGHTS OF THE GARTER. This is considered the most honourable order  of knighthood in Europe: it was founded by Edward III. in 1349; the  fraternity consists of twenty-six knights, to which are added the  princes of the blood royal. The king of England is the sovereign of  the order; their officers are a prelate, chancellor, registrar, and  king-at-arms.    The college of the order is in Windsor Castle, with the chapel of St.  George and the chapter-house. These buildings were erected by the  royal founder expressly for the accommodation of the knights of the  garter.    The garter is considered the principal ensign of this order: it is  worn on the left leg below the knee; it is formed of blue velvet,  edged with gold: on the velvet is embroidered the motto of the order,  HONI SOIT QUI MAL Y PENSE.    The collar is of gold, weighing thirty ounces troy weight, and  contains twenty-six garters enamelled proper, in each a rose gules  between; the garters are connected by knots. The George is attached to  this collar: it represents St. George (the patron Saint of the order)  attacking the dragon; it is of gold enamelled, and may be enriched  with jewels at the pleasure of the possessor.    THE KNIGHTS OF ST. PATRICK. This illustrious Irish order was founded  by George III., 1783. It consists of the sovereign, a grand  master, the princes of the blood royal, and thirteen knights. The  lord-lieutenant for the time being is grand master. The device on the  jewel of this order is argent, a cross saltier gules surmounted with  a trefoil vert, charged with three imperial crowns or, the whole  inclosed in a circle of gold, bearing the motto QUIS SEPARABIT.  MDCCLXXXIII. An engraving of this jewel will be found on the sinister  side of the title-page.    THE KNIGHTS OF THE THISTLE. The most ancient order of the Thistle was  founded by James V. of Scotland, 1540, and revived by James II., king  of Great Britain, 1687, incorporated by Queen Anne, whose statutes  were confirmed by George I. The order consists of the sovereign and  twelve brethren or knights. Their motto is the national motto, NEMO ME  IMPUNE LACESSET; their badge or jewel, St. Andrew, supporting a cross,  surrounded with rays of gold, an engraving of which will be found on  the dexter side of the title-page.    [Illustration: Knight and Baronet]    KNIGHT AND BARONET. A degree of honour next to a baron, created by  King James I. to induce the English gentry to settle in the province  of Ulster. The title is knight and baronet; it is hereditary: the arms  are distinguished by an augmentation of a human hand gules, generally  borne on an escutcheon in the centre of the shield.    [Illustration: Knight and Baronet of Nova Scotia]    KNIGHT AND BARONET OF NOVA SCOTIA. A new creation during the reign  of George I. to induce capitalists to settle in that part of North  America. The title is hereditary: the arms are argent, St. Andrew's  Cross gules surtout, an escutcheon or, with a lion rampant gules  within a double tressure of the same, surmounted by a king's crown as  a crest.    KNIGHTS OF THE BATH. An ancient and honourable military order of  knighthood. The date of its origin is too remote to be traced with  certainty: by some authors it is said to have been instituted in  Normandy before the Conquest; it was re-established in England by  Henry IV., and revived by George I. The chapel of this order is Henry  VII.'s chapel in Westminster Abbey: the Dean of Westminster for the  time being is always dean of the order of the Bath. The number of the  knights is according to the pleasure of the sovereign. At the close of  the late war the Prince Regent, afterwards George IV., remodelled this  order of knighthood; and to enable himself to bestow marks of honour  upon the naval and military officers that had distinguished themselves  on the ocean and in the field, he divided the order into three  classes: first, all the noblemen that were Knights of the Bath were  henceforth to be called Knights Grand Crosses of the Bath, which  was also the title of the commanders of fleets and armies that were  rewarded by being admitted into the highest class of this noble order.    The second class are called Knights Commanders of the Bath; a great  number of naval and military officers above the rank of captains in  the navy and majors in the army are admitted into this class.    The third class is styled Companions of the Order of the Bath, and is  open to officers of inferior rank.    The Knights Grand Crosses of the Bath attach the initials K.G.C.B. to  their names and titles.    The Knights Commanders use the initials K.C.B.    The Companions are known by the initials C.B.

A tendency to act only becomes  effectively ingrained in us in proportion to the uninterrupted frequency  with which the actions actually occur, and the brain 'grows' to their  use. When a resolve or a fine glow of feeling is allowed to evaporate  without bearing practical fruit, it is worse than a chance lost: it  works so as positively to hinder future resolutions and emotions from  taking the normal path of discharge. There is no more contemptible type  of human character than that of the nerveless sentimentalist and  dreamer, who spends his life in a weltering sea of sensibility, but  never does a concrete manly deed.    This leads to a fourth maxim. _Don't preach too much to your pupils or  abound in good talk in the abstract_. Lie in wait rather for the  practical opportunities, be prompt to seize those as they pass, and thus  at one operation get your pupils both to think, to feel, and to do. The  strokes of _behavior_ are what give the new set to the character, and  work the good habits into its organic tissue. Preaching and talking too  soon become an ineffectual bore.           *       *       *       *       *    There is a passage in Darwin's short autobiography which has been often  quoted, and which, for the sake of its bearing on our subject of habit,  I must now quote again. Darwin says: \"Up to the age of thirty or beyond  it, poetry of many kinds gave me great pleasure; and even as a schoolboy  I took intense delight in Shakespeare, especially in the historical  plays. I have also said that pictures formerly gave me considerable, and  music very great delight. But now for many years I cannot endure to read  a line of poetry. I have tried lately to read Shakespeare, and found it  so intolerably dull that it nauseated me. I have also almost lost my  taste for pictures or music.... My mind seems to have become a kind of  machine for grinding general laws out of large collections of facts; but  why this should have caused the atrophy of that part of the brain alone,  on which the higher tastes depend, I cannot conceive.... If I had to  live my life again, I would have made a rule to read some poetry and  listen to some music at least once every week; for perhaps the parts of  my brain now atrophied would thus have been kept alive through use. The  loss of these tastes is a loss of happiness, and may possibly be  injurious to the intellect, and more probably to the moral character, by  enfeebling the emotional part of our nature.\"    We all intend when young to be all that may become a man, before the  destroyer cuts us down. We wish and expect to enjoy poetry always, to  grow more and more intelligent about pictures and music, to keep in  touch with spiritual and religious ideas, and even not to let the  greater philosophic thoughts of our time develop quite beyond our view.  We mean all this in youth, I say; and yet in how many middle-aged men  and women is such an honest and sanguine expectation fulfilled? Surely,  in comparatively few; and the laws of habit show us why. Some interest  in each of these things arises in everybody at the proper age; but, if  not persistently fed with the appropriate matter, instead of growing  into a powerful and necessary habit, it atrophies and dies, choked by  the rival interests to which the daily food is given. We make ourselves  into Darwins in this negative respect by persistently ignoring the  essential practical conditions of our case. We say abstractly: \"I mean  to enjoy poetry, and to absorb a lot of it, of course. I fully intend to  keep up my love of music, to read the books that shall give new turns to  the thought of my time, to keep my higher spiritual side alive, etc.\"  But we do not attack these things concretely, and we do not begin  _to-day. _We forget that every good that is worth possessing must be  paid for in strokes of daily effort. We postpone and postpone, until  those smiling possibilities are dead. Whereas ten minutes a day of  poetry, of spiritual reading or meditation, and an hour or two a week at  music, pictures, or philosophy, provided we began _now_ and suffered no  remission, would infallibly give us in due time the fulness of all we  desire. By neglecting the necessary concrete labor, by sparing  ourselves the little daily tax, we are positively digging the graves of  our higher possibilities. This is a point concerning which you teachers  might well give a little timely information to your older and more  aspiring pupils.    According as a function receives daily exercise or not, the man becomes  a different kind of being in later life. We have lately had a number of  accomplished Hindoo visitors at Cambridge, who talked freely of life and  philosophy. More than one of them has confided to me that the sight of  our faces, all contracted as they are with the habitual American  over-intensity and anxiety of expression, and our ungraceful and  distorted attitudes when sitting, made on him a very painful impression.  \"I do not see,\" said one, \"how it is possible for you to live as you do,  without a single minute in your day deliberately given to tranquillity  and meditation. It is an invariable part of our Hindoo life to retire  for at least half an hour daily into silence, to relax our muscles,  govern our breathing, and meditate on eternal things. Every Hindoo child  is trained to this from a very early age.\" The good fruits of such a  discipline were obvious in the physical repose and lack of tension, and  the wonderful smoothness and calmness of facial expression, and  imperturbability of manner of these Orientals. I felt that my countrymen  were depriving themselves of an essential grace of character. How many  American children ever hear it said by parent or teacher, that they  should moderate their piercing voices, that they should relax their  unused muscles, and as far as possible, when sitting, sit quite still?  Not one in a thousand, not one in five thousand! Yet, from its reflex  influence on the inner mental states, this ceaseless over-tension,  over-motion, and over-expression are working on us grievous national  harm.    I beg you teachers to think a little seriously of this matter. Perhaps  you can help our rising generation of Americans toward the beginning of  a better set of personal ideals.[B]         [B] See the Address on the Gospel of Relaxation, later in       this volume.           *       *       *       *       *    To go back now to our general maxims, I may at last, as a fifth and  final practical maxim about habits, offer something like this: _Keep the  faculty of effort alive in you by a little gratuitous exercise every  day._ That is, be systematically heroic in little unnecessary points, do  every day or two something for no other reason than its difficulty, so  that, when the hour of dire need draws nigh, it may find you not  unnerved and untrained to stand the test. Asceticism of this sort is  like the insurance which a man pays on his house and goods. The tax does  him no good at the time, and possibly may never bring him a return. But,  if the fire _does_ come, his having paid it will be his salvation from  ruin. So with the man who has daily inured himself to habits of  concentrated attention, energetic volition, and self-denial in  unnecessary things. He will stand like a tower when everything rocks  around him, and his softer fellow-mortals are winnowed like chaff in the  blast.           *       *       *       *       *    I have been accused, when talking of the subject of habit, of making old  habits appear so strong that the acquiring of new ones, and particularly  anything like a sudden reform or conversion, would be made impossible by  my doctrine. Of course, this would suffice to condemn the latter; for  sudden conversions, however infrequent they may be, unquestionably do  occur. But there is no incompatibility between the general laws I have  laid down and the most startling sudden alterations in the way of  character. New habits _can_ be launched, I have expressly said, on  condition of there being new stimuli and new excitements. Now life  abounds in these, and sometimes they are such critical and revolutionary  experiences that they change a man's whole scale of values and system of  ideas. In such cases, the old order of his habits will be ruptured; and,  if the new motives are lasting, new habits will be formed, and build up  in him a new or regenerate 'nature.'    All this kind of fact I fully allow. But the general laws of habit are  no wise altered thereby, and the physiological study of mental  conditions still remains on the whole the most powerful ally of  hortatory ethics. The hell to be endured hereafter, of which theology  tells, is no worse than the hell we make for ourselves in this world by  habitually fashioning our characters in the wrong way. Could the young  but realize how soon they will become mere walking bundles of habits,  they would give more heed to their conduct while in the plastic state.  We are spinning our own fates, good or evil, and never to be undone.  Every smallest stroke of virtue or of vice leaves its never-so-little  scar. The drunken Rip Van Winkle, in Jefferson's play, excuses himself  for every fresh dereliction by saying, \"I won't count this time!\" Well,  he may not count it, and a kind Heaven may not count it; but it is being  counted none the less. Down among his nerve-cells and fibres the  molecules are counting it, registering and storing it up to be used  against him when the next temptation comes. Nothing we ever do is, in  strict scientific literalness, wiped out.    Of course, this has its good side as well as its bad one. As we become  permanent drunkards by so many separate drinks, so we become saints in  the moral, and authorities and experts in the practical and scientific  spheres, by so many separate acts and hours of work.
