[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15663"],[0,"Ancient Egypt (#10)"],[1,"the Greeks represented by Men or Menes.  M'na was born at Tena (This or Thinis) in Upper Egypt, where his  ancestors had borne sway before him. He was the first to master the  Lower country, and thus to unite under a single sceptre the \"two  Egypts\"--the long narrow Nile valley and the broad Delta plain. Having  placed on his head the double crown which thenceforth symbolized  dominion over both tracts, his first thought was that a new capital was  needed. Egypt could not, he felt, be ruled conveniently from the  latitude of Thebes, or from any site in the Upper country; it required a  capital which should abut on both regions, and so command both. Nature  pointed out one only fit locality, the junction of the plain with the  vale--\"the balance of the two regions,\" as the Egyptians called it; the  place where the narrow \"Upper Country\" terminates, and Egypt opens out  into the wide smiling plain that thence spreads itself on every side to  the sea. Hence there would be easy access to both regions; both would  be, in a way, commanded; here, too, was a readily defensible position,  one assailable only in front. Experience has shown that the instinct of  the first founder was right, or that his political and strategic  foresight was extraordinary. Though circumstances, once and again,  transferred the seat of government to Thebes or Alexandria, yet such  removals were short-lived. The force of geographic fact was too strong  to be permanently overcome, and after a few centuries power gravitated  back to the centre pointed out by nature.    If we may believe the tradition, there was, when the idea of building  the new capital arose, a difficulty in obtaining a site in all respects  advantageous. The Nile, before debouching upon the plain, hugged for  many miles the base of the Libyan hills, and was thus on the wrong side  of the valley. It was wanted on the other side, in order to be a  water-bulwark against an Asiatic invader. The founder, therefore, before  building his city, undertook a gigantic work. He raised a great  embankment across the natural course of the river; and, forcing it from  its bed, made it enter a new channel and run midway down the valley, or,  if anything, rather towards its eastern side. He thus obtained the  bulwark against invasion that he required, and he had an ample site for  his capital between the new channel of the stream and the foot of the  western hills.    It is undoubtedly strange to hear of such a work being constructed at  the very dawn of history, by a population that was just becoming a  people. But in Egypt precocity is the rule--a Minerva starts full-grown  from the head of Jove. The pyramids themselves cannot be placed very  long after the supposed reign of Menes; and the engineering skill  implied in the pyramids is simply of a piece with that attributed to the  founder of Memphis.    In ancient times a city was nothing without a temple; and the capital  city of the most religious people in the world could not by any  possibility lack that centre of civic life which its chief temple always  was to every ancient town. Philosophy must settle the question how it  came to pass that religious ideas were in ancient times so universally  prevalent and so strongly pronounced. History is only bound to note the  fact. Coeval, then, with the foundation of the city of Menes was,  according to the tradition, the erection of a great temple to  Phthah--\"the Revealer,\" the Divine artificer, by whom the world and man  were created, and the hidden thought of the remote Supreme Being was  made manifest to His creatures, Phthah's temple lay within the town, and  was originally a _naos_ or \"cell,\" a single building probably not unlike  that between the Sphinx's paws at Ghizeh, situated within a _temenos_,  or \"sacred enclosure,\" watered from the river, and no doubt planted with  trees. Like the medieval cathedrals, the building grew with the lapse  of centuries, great kings continually adding new structures to the main  edifice, and enriching it with statuary and painting. Herodotus saw it  in its full glory, and calls it \"a vast edifice, very worthy of  commemoration.\" Abd-el-Latif saw it in its decline, and notes the beauty  of its remains: \"the great monolithic shrine of breccia verde, nine  cubits high, eight long, and seven broad, the doors which swung on  hinges of stone, the well-carven statues, and the lions terrific in  their aspect.\"[7] At the present day scarcely a trace remains. One  broken colossus of the Great Ramesses, till very recently prostrate, and  a few nondescript fragments, alone continue on the spot, to attest to  moderns the position of that antique fane, which the Egyptians  themselves regarded as the oldest in their land.    The new city received from its founder the name of Men-nefer--\"the Good  Abode.\" It was also known as Ei-Ptah--\"the House of Phthah.\" From the  former name came the prevailing appellations--the \"Memphis\" of the  Greeks and Romans, the \"Moph\" of the Hebrews, the \"Mimpi\" of the  Assyrians, and the name still given to the ruins, \"Tel-Monf.\" It was  indeed a \"good abode\"--watered by an unfailing stream, navigable from  the sea, which at once brought it supplies and afforded it a strong  protection, surrounded on three sides by the richest and most productive  alluvium, close to quarries of excellent stone, warm in winter, fanned  by the cool northern breezes in the summer-time, within easy reach of  the sea, yet not so near as to attract the cupidity of pirates. Few  capitals have been more favourably placed. It was inevitable that when  the old town went to ruins, a new one should spring up in its stead.  Memphis still exists, in a certain sense, in the glories of the modern  Cairo, which occupies an adjacent site, and is composed largely of the  same materials.    The Egyptians knew no more of their first king than that he turned the  course of the Nile, founded Memphis, built the nucleus of the great  temple of Phthah, and \"was devoured by a hippopotamus.\" This last fact  is related with all due gravity by Manetho, notwithstanding that the  hippopotamus is a graminivorous animal, one that \"eats grass like an ox\"  (Job xi. 15). Probably the old Egyptian writer whom he followed meant  that M'na at last fell a victim to Taourt, the Goddess of Evil, to whom  the hippopotamus was sacred, and who was herself figured as a  hippopotamus erect. This would be merely equivalent to relating that he  succumbed to death. Manetho gave him a reign of sixty-two years.    The question is asked by the modern critics, who will take nothing on  trust, \"Have we in Menes a real Egyptian, a being of flesh and blood,  one who truly lived, breathed, fought, built, ruled, and at last died?  Or are we still dealing with a phantom, as much as when we spoke of Seb,  and Thoth, and Osiris, and Set, and Horus?\" The answer seems to be, that  we cannot tell. The Egyptians believed in Menes as a man; they placed  him at the head of their dynastic lists; but they had no contemporary  monument to show inscribed with his name. A name like that of Menes is  found at the beginning of things in so many nations, that on that  account alone the word would be suspicious; in Greece it is Minos, in  Phrygia Manis, in Lydia Manes, in India Menu, in Germany Mannus. And  again, the name of the founder is so like that of the city which he  founded, that another suspicion arises--Have we not here one of the many  instances of a personal name made out of a local one, as Nin or Ninus  from Nineveh (Ninua), Romulus from Roma, and the like? Probably we shall  do best to acquiesce in the judgment of Dr. Birch: \"Menes must be placed  among those founders of monarchies whose personal existence a severe and  enlightened criticism doubts or denies.\"    The city was, however, a reality, the embankment was a reality, the  temple of Phthah was a reality, and the founding of a kingdom in Egypt,  which included both the Upper and the Lower country some considerable  time before the date of Abraham, was a reality, which the sternest  criticism need not--nay, cannot--doubt. All antiquity attests that the  valley of the Nile was one of the first seats of civilization. Abraham  found a settled government established there when he visited the  country, and a consecutive series of monuments carries the date of the  first civilization at least as far back as B.C. 2700--probably further.    If the great Menes, then, notwithstanding all that we are told of his  doings, be a mere shadowy personage, little more than _magni nominis  umbra_, what shall we say of his twenty or thirty successors of the  first, second, and third dynasties? What but that they are shadows of  shadows? The native monuments of the early Ramesside period (about B.C.  1400-1300) assign to this time some twenty-five names of kings; but they  do not agree in their order, nor do they altogether agree in the names.  The kings, if they were kings, have left no history--we can only by  conjecture attach to them any particular buildings, we can give no  account of their actions, we can assign no chronology to their reigns.  They are of no more importance in the \"story of Egypt\" than the Alban  kings in the \"story of Rome.\" \"Non ragionam di loro, ma guarda e passi.\"    The first living, breathing, acting, flesh-and-blood personage, whom  so-called histories of Egypt present to us, is a certain Sneferu, or  Seneferu, whom the Egyptians seem to have regarded as the first monarch  of their fourth dynasty. Sneferu--called by Manetho, we know not why,  Soris--has left us a representation of himself, and an inscription. On  the rocks of Wady Magharah, in the Sinaitic peninsula, may be seen to  this day an incised tablet representing the monarch in the act of  smiting an enemy, whom he holds by the hair of his head, with a mace.  The action is apparently emblematic, for at the side we see the words  _Ta satu_, \"Smiter of the nations;\" and it is a fair"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15665"],[0,"New Latin Grammar (#10)"],[1,"fortiorum       fortiorum    _Dat._  fortibus        fortibus        fortioribus     fortioribus    _Acc._  fortes, -is     fortia          fortiores, -is  fortiora    _Voc._  fortes          fortia          fortiores       fortiora    _Abl._  fortibus        fortibus        fortioribus     fortioribus    1.

It will be observed that vetus is declined as a pure Consonant-Stem;  i.e. Ablative Singular in -e, Genitive Plural in -um, Nominative Plural  Neuter in -a, and Accusative Plural Masculine and Feminine in -es only. In  the same way are declined compos, _controlling_; dives, _rich_; particeps,  _sharing_; pauper, _poor_; princeps, _chief_; sospes, _safe_; superstes,  _surviving_. Yet dives always has Neut. Plu. ditia.    2. Inops, _needy_, and memor, _mindful_, have Ablative Singular inopi,  memori, but Genitive Plural inopum, memorum.    3. Participles in -ans and -ens follow the declension of i-stems. But they  do not have -i the Ablative, except when employed as adjectives; when used  as participles or as substantives, they have -e; as,--      a sapienti viro, _by a wise man_; but    a sapiente, _by a philosopher._    Tarquinio regnante, _under the reign of Tarquin._    4. Plus, in the Singular, is always a noun.    5. In the Ablative Singular, adjectives, when used as substantives,--      a) usually retain the adjective declension; as,--        aequalis, _contemporary_, Abl. aequali.      consularis, _ex-consul_, Abl. consulari      So names of Months; as, Aprili, _April_; Decembri, _December_.      b) But adjectives used as proper names have -e in the Ablative Singular;    as, Celere, Celer; Juvenale, _Juvenal_.      c) Patrials in -as, -atis and -is, -itis, when designating places    regularly have -i; as, in Arpinati, _on the estate at Arpinum_, yet -e,    when used of persons; as, ab Arpinate, _by an Arpinatian_.    6. A very few indeclinable adjectives occur, the chief of which are frugi,  _frugal_; nequam, _worthless_.    7. In poetry, adjectives and participles in -ns sometimes form the Gen.  Plu. in -um instead of -ium; as, venientum, _of those coming_.           *       *       *       *       *    COMPARISON OF ADJECTIVES.    71. 1. There are three degrees of Comparison,--the Positive, the  Comparative, and the Superlative.    2. The Comparative is regularly formed by adding -ior (Neut. -ius), and the  Superlative by adding -issimus (-a, -um), to the Stem of the Positive  deprived of its final vowel; as,--      altus, _high_,              altior, _higher_,   altissimus, _highest_,                                                    _very high_.    fortis, _brave_,            fortior,            fortissimus.    felix, _fortunate_,         felicior,           felicissimus.    So also Participles, when used as Adjectives; as,--      doctus, _learned_,          doctior,            doctissimus.    egens, _needy_,             egentior,           egentissimus.    3. Adjectives in -er form the Superlative by appending -rimus to the  Nominative of the Positive. The Comparative is regular. Thus:--      asper, _rough_,             asperior,           asperrimus.    pulcher, _beautiful_,       pulchrior,          pulcherrimus.    acer, _sharp_,              acrior,             acerrimus.    celer, _swift_,             celerior,           celerrimus.      a. Notice maturus, maturior, maturissimus or maturrimus.    4. Five Adjectives in -ilis form the Superlative by adding -limus to the  Stem of the Positive deprived of its final vowel. The Comparative is  regular. Thus:--      facilis, _easy_,            facilior,           facillimus.    difficilis, _diffcult_,     difficilior,        difficillimus.    similis, _like_,            similior,           simillimus.    dissimilis, _unlike_,       dissimilior,        dissimillimus.    humilis, _low_,             humilior,           humillimus.    5. Adjectives in -dicus, -ficus, and -volus form the Comparative and  Superlative as though from forms in -dicens, -ficens, -volens. Thus:--      maledicus, _slanderous_,    maledicentior,      maledicentissimus.    magnificus, _magnificent_,  magnificentior,     magnificentissimus.    benevolus, _kindly_,        benevolentior,      benevolentissimus.      a. Positives in -dicens and -volens occur in early Latin; as maledicens,    benevolens.    6. Dives has the Comparative divitior or ditior; Superlative divitissimus  or ditissimus.    Irregular Comparison.    72. Several Adjectives vary the Stem in Comparison; _viz_.--      bonus, _good_,              melior,             optimus.    malus, _bad_,               pejor,              pessimus.    parvus, _small_,            minor,              minimus.    magnus, _large_,            major,              maximus.    multus, _much_,             plus,               plurimus,    frugi, _thrifty_,           frugalior,          frugalissimus,    nequam, _worthless_,        nequior,            nequissimus.    Defective Comparison.    73. 1. Positive lacking entirely,--      (Cf. prae, _in front    prior, _former_,        primus, _first_    of_.)    (Cf. citra, _this side  citerior, _on this      citimus, _near_.    of_.)                   side_,    (Cf. ultra, _beyond_.)  ulterior, _farther_,    ultimus, _farthest_.    (Cf. intra, _within_.)  interior, _inner_,      intimus, _inmost_    (Cf. prope, _near_.)    propior, _nearer_,      proximus, _nearest_.    (Cf. de, _down_.)       deterior, _inferior_,   deterrimus, _worst_.    (Cf. archaic potis,     potior, _preferable_,   potissimus, _chiefest_    _possible_.)    2. Positive occurring only in special cases,--      postero die, anno,      posterior, _later_,     postremus, _latest_,    etc. _the following                             _last_.    day_, etc.,                                     postumus, _late-born_,    posteri,                                        _posthumous_.    _descendants_,    exteri,                 exterior, _outer_       extremus, extimus,    _foreigners_,                                   _outermost_.    nationes exterae,    _foreign nations_,    inferi, _gods of the    inferior, _lower_,      infimus, imus,    lower world_,                                   _lowest_.    Mare Inferum,    _Mediterranean Sea_,    superi, _gods           superior, _higher_,     supremus, _last_.    above_,                                         summus, _highest_.    Mare Superum,    _Adriatic Sea_,    3. Comparative lacking.      vetus, _old_,            ----[17]              veterrimus.    fidus, _faithful_,       ----                  fidissimus.    novus, _new_,            ----[18]              novissimus,[19] _last_.    sacer, _sacred_,         ----                  sacerrimus.    falsus, _false_,         ----                  falsissimus.    Also in some other words less frequently used.    4. Superlative lacking.      alacer, _lively_,        alacrior,             ----    ingens, _great_,         ingentior,            ----    salutaris, _wholesome_,  salutarior,           ----    juvenis, _young_,        junior,               ----[20]    senex, _old_,            senior.               ----[21]      a. The Superlative is lacking also in many adjectives in -alis, -ilis,    -ilis, -bilis, and in a few others.    Comparison by _Magis_ and _Maxime_.    74. Many adjectives do not admit terminational comparison, but form the  Comparative and Superlative degrees by prefixing magis (_more_) and maxime  (_most_). Here belong--    1. Many adjectives ending in -alis, -aris, -idus, -ilis, -icus, imus, inus,  -orus.    2. Adjectives in -us, preceded by a vowel; as, idoneus, _adapted_; arduus,  _steep_; necessarius, _necessary_.      a. Adjectives in -quus, of course, do not come under this rule. The first    u in such cases is not a vowel,"]]]
