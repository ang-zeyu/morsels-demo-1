You didn't tell any one else, did you?\"    He looked up at her again and found her studying him curiously. \"You're  not the man I saw,\" she said, as if she were satisfying herself on that  point. \"I've wondered since--but I was sure, too, that I had seen it.  Why mustn't I tell any one?\"    Lone did not reply at once. The girl's eyes were disconcertingly direct,  her voice and her manner disturbed him with their judicial calmness, so  at variance with the wildness he remembered.    \"Well, it's hard to explain,\" he said at last. \"You're strange to this  country, and you don't know all the ins and outs of--things. It wouldn't  do any good to you or anybody else, and it might do a lot of harm.\" His  eyes nicked her face with a wistful glance. \"You don't know me--I really  haven't got any right to ask or expect you to trust me. But I wish you  would, to the extent of forgetting that you saw--or thought you  saw--anything that night in Rock City.\"    Lorraine shivered and covered her eyes swiftly with one hand. His words  had brought back too sharply that scene. But she shook off the emotion  and faced him again.    \"I saw a man murdered,\" she cried. \"I wasn't sure afterwards; sometimes  I thought I had dreamed it. But I was sure I saw it. I saw the horse go  by, running--and you want me to keep still about that? What harm could  it do to tell? Perhaps it's true--perhaps I did see it all. I might  think you were trying to cover up something--only, you're not the man I  saw--or thought I saw.\"    \"No, of course I'm not. You dreamed the whole thing, and the way you  talked to me was so wild, folks would say you're crazy if they heard you  tell it. You're a stranger here, Miss Hunter, and--your father is not as  popular in this country as he might be. He's got enemies that would be  glad of the chance to stir up trouble for him. You--just dreamed all  that. I'm asking you to forget a bad dream, that's all, and not go  telling it to other folks.\"    For some time Lorraine did not answer. The horses conversed with sundry  nose-rubbings, nibbled idly at convenient brush tips, and wondered no  doubt why their riders were so silent. Lone tried to think of some  stronger argument, some appeal that would reach the girl without  frightening her or causing her to distrust him. But he did not know what  more he could say without telling her what must not be told.    \"Just how would it make trouble for my father?\" Lorraine asked at last.  \"I can't believe you'd ask me to help cover up a crime, but it seems  hard to believe that a nightmare would cause any great commotion. And  why is my father unpopular?\"    \"Well, you don't know this country,\" Lone parried inexpertly. \"It's all  right in some ways, and in some ways it could be a lot improved. Folks  haven't got much to talk about. They go around gabbling their heads off  about every little thing, and adding onto it until you can't recognize  your own remarks after they've been peddled for a week. You've maybe  seen places like that.\"    \"Oh, yes.\" Lorraine's eyes lighted with a smile. \"Take a movie studio,  for instance.\"    \"Yes. Well, you being a stranger, you would get all the worst of it. I  just thought I'd tell you; I'd hate to see you misunderstood by folks  around here. I--I feel kinda responsible for you; I'm the one that found  you.\"    Lorraine's eyes twinkled. \"Well, I'm glad to know one person in the  country who doesn't gabble his head off. You haven't answered any of my  questions, and you've made me feel as if you'd found a dangerous, wild  woman that morning. It isn't very flattering, but I think you're honest,  anyway.\"    Lone smiled for the first time, and she found his smile pleasant. \"I'm  no angel,\" he disclaimed modestly, \"and most folks think I could be  improved on a whole lot. But I'm honest in one way. I'm thinking about  what's best for you, this time.\"    \"I'm terribly grateful,\" Lorraine laughed. \"I shall take great care not  to go all around the country telling people my dreams. I can see that it  wouldn't make me awfully popular.\" Then she sobered. \"Mr. Morgan, that  was a _horrible_ kind of--nightmare. Why, even last night I woke up  shivering, just imagining it all over again.\"    \"It was sure horrible the way you talked about it,\" Lone assured her.  \"It's because you were sick, I reckon. I wish you'd tell me as close as  you can where you left that grip of yours. You said it was under a bush  where a rabbit was sitting. I'd like to find the grip--but I'm afraid  that rabbit has done moved!\"    \"Oh, Mr. Warfield and I found it, thank you. The rabbit had moved, but I  sort of remembered how the road had looked along there, and we hunted  until we discovered the place. Dad has driven in after my other luggage  to-day--and I believe I must be getting home. I was only out for a  little ride.\"    She thanked him again for the trouble he had taken and rode away. Lone  turned off the trail and, picking his way around rough outcroppings of  rock, and across unexpected little gullies, headed straight for the ford  across Granite Creek and home. Brit Hunter's girl, he was thinking, was  even nicer than he had pictured her. And that she could believe in the  nightmare was a vast relief.          CHAPTER SEVEN    THE MAN AT WHISPER      Brit Hunter finished washing the breakfast dishes and put a stick of  wood into the broken old cook-stove that had served him and Frank for  fifteen years and was feeling its age. Lorraine's breakfast was in the  oven, keeping warm. Brit looked in, tested the heat with his gnarled  hand to make sure that the sour-dough biscuits would not be dried to  crusts, and closed the door upon them and the bacon and fried potatoes.  Frank Johnson had the horses saddled and it was time to go, yet Brit  lingered, uneasily conscious that his habitation was lacking in many  things which a beautiful young woman might consider absolute  necessities. He had seen in Lorraine's eyes, as they glanced here and  there about the grimy walls, a certain disparagement of her  surroundings. The look had made him wince, though he could not quite  decide what it was that displeased her. Maybe she wanted lace curtains,  or something.    He set the four chairs in a row against the wall, swept up the bits of  bark and ashes beside the stove, made sure that the water bucket was  standing full on its bench beside the door, sent another critical glance  around the room, and tiptoed over to the dish cupboard and let down the  flowered calico curtain that had been looped up over a nail for  convenience. The sun sent a bright, wide bar of yellow light across the  room to rest on the shelf behind the stove where stood the salt can, the  soda, the teapot, a box of matches and two pepper cans, one empty and  the other full. Brit always meant to throw out that empty pepper can and  always neglected to do so. Just now he remembered picking up the empty  one and shaking it over the potatoes futilely and then changing it for  the full one. But he did not take it away; in the wilderness one learns  to save useless things in the faint hope that some day they may become  useful. The shelves were cluttered with fit companions to that empty  pepper can. Brit thought that he would have \"cleaned out\" had he known  that Lorraine was coming. Since she was here, it scarcely seemed worth  while.    He walked on his boot-toes to the door of the second room of the cabin,  listened there for a minute, heard no sound and took a tablet and pencil  off another shelf littered with useless things. The note which he wrote  painstakingly, lest she might think him lacking in education, he laid  upon the table beside Lorraine's plate; then went out, closing the door  behind him as quietly as a squeaking door can be made to close.    Lorraine, in the other room, heard the squeak and sat up. Her wrist  watch, on the chair beside her bed, said that it was fifteen minutes  past six, which she considered an unearthly hour for rising. She pulled  up the covers and tried to sleep again. The day would be long enough, at  best. There was nothing to do, unless she took that queer old horse with  withers like the breastbone of a lean Christmas turkey and hips that  reminded her of the little roofs over dormer windows, and went for a  ride. And if she did that, there was nowhere to go and nothing to do  when she arrived there.    In a very few days Lorraine had exhausted the sights of Quirt Creek and  vicinity. If she rode south she would eventually come to the top of a  hill whence she could look down upon further stretches of barrenness. If  she rode east she would come eventually to the road along which she had  walked from Echo, Idaho. Lorraine had had enough of that road. If she  went north she would--well, she would not meet Mr. Lone Morgan again,  for she had tried it twice, and had turned back because there seemed no  end to the trail twisting through the sage and rocks. West she had not  gone, but she had no doubt that it would be the same dreary monotony of  dull gray landscape.    Monotony of landscape was one thing which Lorraine could not endure,  unless it had a foreground of riders hurtling here and there, and of  perspiring men around a camera tripod. At the Sawtooth ranch, after she  was able to be up, she had seen cowboys, but they had lacked the dash  and the picturesque costuming of the West she knew. They were mostly  commonplace young men, jogging past the house on horseback, or loitering  down by the corrals. They had offered absolutely no interest or \"color\"  to the place, and the owner's son, Bob Warfield, had driven her over to  the Quirt in a Ford and had seemed exactly like any other big,  good-looking young man who thought well of himself. Lorraine was not  susceptible to mere good looks, three years with the \"movies\" having  disillusioned her quite thoroughly. Too many young men of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19172"],[0,"An Australian in China (#10)"],[1,"my journey would be applied in the direction of inducing the Chinese to  treat me with the respect that was undoubtedly due to one who, in their  own words, had done them the \"exalted honour\" of visiting \"their mean  and contemptible country.\" For I could not afford a private sedan chair,  though I knew that Baber had written that \"no traveller in Western China  who possesses any sense of self-respect should journey without a sedan  chair, not necessarily as a conveyance, but for the honour and glory of  the thing. Unfurnished with this indispensable token of respectability  he is liable to be thrust aside on the highway, to be kept waiting at  ferries, to be relegated to the worst inn's worst room, and generally to  be treated with indignity, or, what is sometimes worse, with  familiarity, as a peddling footpad who, unable to gain a living in his  own country, has come to subsist on China.\" (\"Travels and Researches in  Western China,\" p. 1.)    Six li out (two miles), beyond the gravemounds there is a small village  where ponies are kept for hire. A kind friend came with me as far as the  village to act as my interpreter, and here he engaged a pony for me. It  was to carry me ten miles for fourpence. It was small, rat-like and  wiry, and was steered by the \"mafoo\" using the tail like a tiller.  Mounted then on this small beast, which carried me without wincing, I  jogged along over the stone-flagged pathway, down hill and along valley,  scaling and descending the long flights of steps which lead over the  mountains. The bells of the pony jingled merrily; the day was fine and  the sun shone behind the clouds. My two coolies sublet their contracts,  and had their loads borne for a fraction of a farthing per mile by  coolies returning empty-handed to Suifu.    [Illustration: ON THE MAIN ROAD TO SUIFU.]    Fu-to-kuan four miles from Chungking is a powerful hill-fort that guards  the isthmus where the Yangtse and the Little River come nearly together  before encircling Chungking. Set in the face of the cliff is a gigantic  image of Buddha. Massive stone portals, elaborately carved, and huge  commemorative tablets cut from single blocks of stone and deeply  engraved, here adorn the highway. The archways have been erected by  command of the Emperor, but at the expense of their relatives, to the  memory of virtuous widows who have refused to remarry, or who have  sacrificed their lives on the death of their husbands. Happy are those  whose names are thus recorded, for not only do they obtain ten thousand  merits in heaven, as well as the Imperial recognition of the Son of  Heaven on earth; but as an additional reward their souls may, on  entering the world a second time, enjoy the indescribable felicity of  inhabiting the bodies of men.    Cases where the widow has thus brought honour to the family are  constantly recorded in the pages of the _Peking Gazette_. One of more  than usual merit is described in the _Peking Gazette_ of June 10th,  1892. The story runs:--    \"The Governor of Shansi narrates the story of a virtuous wife who  destroyed herself after the death of her husband. The lady was a native  of T'ienmen, in Hupeh, and both her father and grandfather were  officials who attained the rank of Taotai. When she was little more than  ten years old her mother fell ill. The child cut flesh from her body and  mixed it with the medicines and thus cured her parent. The year before  last she was married to an expectant magistrate. Last autumn, just after  he had obtained an appointment, he was taken violently ill. She mixed  her flesh with the medicine but it was in vain, and he died shortly  afterwards. Overcome with grief, and without parents or children to  demand her care, she determined that she would not live. Only waiting  till she had completed the arrangements for her husband's interment, she  swallowed gold and powder of lead. She handed her trousseau to her  relatives to defray her funeral expenses, and made presents to the  younger members of the family and the servants, after which, draped in  her state robes, she sat waiting her end. The poison began to work and  soon all was over. The memorialist thinks that the case is one which  should be recorded in the erection of a memorial arch, and he asks the  Emperor to grant that honour to the deceased lady.\" (\"_Granted._\")    Near the base of the rock upon which the hill-fort is built, and between  it and the city, the Methodist Episcopalian Mission of the U.S.A.  commenced in 1886 to build what the Chinese, in their ignorance, feared  was a foreign fort, but what was nothing more than a mission house in a  compound surrounded by a powerful wall. The indiscreet mystery  associated with its erection was the exciting cause of the anti-foreign  riot of July, 1886.    From the fort the pathway led us through a beautiful country. We met  numbers of sedan chairs, borne by two coolies, or three, according to  the importance of the traveller. There were Chinese gentlemen mounted on  ponies or mules; there were strings of coolies swinging along under  prodigious loads of salt and coal, and huge bales of raw cotton.  Buffaloes with slow and painful steps were ploughing the paddy fields,  the water up to their middles--the primitive plough and share guided by  half-naked Chinamen. Along the road there are inns and tea-houses every  mile or two, for this is one of the most frequented roadways of China.  At one good-sized village my cook signed to me to dismount; the mafoo  and pony were paid off, and I sat down in an inn, and was served with an  excellent dish of rice and minced beef. The inn was crowded and open to  the street. Despite my Chinese dress anyone could see that I was a  foreigner, but I was not far enough away from Chungking to excite much  curiosity. The other diners treated me with every courtesy; they offered  me of their dishes, and addressed me in Chinese--a compliment which I  repaid by thanking them blandly in English.    Now I went on, on foot, though I had difficulty in keeping pace with my  men. Behind the village we climbed a very steep hill by interminable  steps, and passed under an archway at the summit. Descending the hill,  my cook engaged in a controversy with a thin lad whom he had hired to  carry his load a stage. The dispute waxed warm, and, while they stopped  to argue it out at leisure, I went on. My cook, engaged through the kind  offices of the Inland Mission, was a man of strong convictions; and in  the last I saw of the dispute he was pulling the unfortunate coolie  downhill by the pigtail. When he overtook me he was alone and smiling  cheerfully, well satisfied with himself for having settled _that_ little  dispute. The road became more level, and we got over the ground quickly.    Late in the evening I was led into a crowded inn in a large village,  where we were to stay the night. We had come twenty-seven miles, and had  begun well. I was shown into a room with three straw-covered wooden  bedsteads, a rough table, lit by a lighted taper in a saucer of oil, a  rough seat, and the naked earth floor. Hot water was brought me to wash  with and tea to drink, and my man prepared me an excellent supper. My  baggage was in the corner; it consisted of two light bamboo boxes with  Chinese padlocks, a bamboo hamper, and a roll of bedding covered with  oilcloth. An oilcloth is indispensable to the traveller in China, for  placed next the straw on a Chinese bed it is impassable to bugs. And  during all my journey in China I was never disturbed in my sleep by this  unpleasant pest. Bugs in China are sufficiently numerous, but their  numbers cannot be compared with the gregarious hosts that disturb the  traveller in Spain.    My last night in Spain was spent in Cadiz, the most charming city in  the peninsula. I had lost the last boat off to the steamer, on which I  was a passenger; it was late at night, and I knew of no inn near the  landing. At midnight, as I was walking in the Plaza, called after that  revered monarch, Queen Isabel II., I was spoken to at the door of a  fonda, and asked if I wanted a bedroom. It was the taberna \"La  Valenciana.\" I was delighted; it was the very thing I was looking for, I  said. The innkeeper had just one room unoccupied, and he showed me  upstairs into a plain, homely apartment, which I was pleased to engage  for the night. \"_Que usted descanse bien_\" (may you sleep well), said  the landlord, and left me. Keeping the candle burning I tumbled into  bed, for I was very tired, but jumped out almost immediately, despite my  fatigue. I turned down the clothes, and saw the bugs gathering in the  centre from all parts of the bed. I collected a dozen or two, and put  them in a basin of water, and, dressing myself, went out on the landing  and called the landlord.    He came up yawning.    \"Sir,\" he said, \"do you wish anything?\"    \"Nothing; but it is impossible, absolutely impossible, for me to sleep  in that bed.\"    \"But why, senor?\"    \"Because it is full of bugs.\"    \"Oh no, sir, that cannot be, that cannot be; there is not a bug in the  house.\"    \"But I have seen them.\"    \"You must be mistaken; it is impossible that there can be a bug in the  house.\"    \"But I have caught some.\"    \"It makes twenty years that I live in this house, and never have I seen  such a thing.\"    \"Pardon me, but will you do me the favour to look at this basin?\"    \"Sir, you are right, you are completely right; it is the weather; _every  bed in Cadiz is now full of them_.\"    In the morning, and every morning, we were away at daylight, and walked  some miles before breakfast. All the way to Suifu the road is a paved  causeway, 3 feet 6 inches to 6 feet wide, laid down with dressed flags  of stone; and here, at least, it cannot be alleged, as the Chinese  proverb would have it, that their roads are \"good for ten years and bad  for ten hundred.\" There are, of course, no fences; the main road picks  its way through the cultivated"]]]
