Religion speaks to us of a hell--that is, of a  fearful place where, notwithstanding His goodness, God reserves eternal  torments for the majority of men. Thus, after having rendered mortals  very miserable in this world, religion teaches them that God can make  them much more wretched in another. They meet our objections by saying,  that otherwise the goodness of God would take the place of His justice.  But goodness which takes the place of the most terrible cruelty, is not  infinite kindness. Besides, a God who, after having been infinitely  good, becomes infinitely wicked, can He be regarded as an immutable  being? A God filled with implacable fury, is He a God in whom we can  find a shadow of charity or goodness?          LXII.--THEOLOGY MAKES OF ITS GOD A MONSTER OF NONSENSE, OF INJUSTICE, OF  MALICE, AND ATROCITY--A BEING ABSOLUTELY HATEFUL.    Divine justice, such as our theologians paint it, is, without doubt, a  quality intended to make us love Divinity. According to the notions of  modern theology, it appears evident that God has created the majority of  men with the view only of punishing them eternally. Would it not have  been more in conformity with kindness, with reason, with equity, to  create but stones or plants, and not sentient beings, than to create men  whose conduct in this world would cause them eternal chastisements in  another? A God so perfidious and wicked as to create a single man and  leave him exposed to the perils of damnation, can not be regarded as a  perfect being, but as a monster of nonsense, injustice, malice, and  atrocity. Far from forming a perfect God, the theologians have made the  most imperfect of beings. According to theological ideas, God resembles  a tyrant who, having deprived the majority of his slaves of their  eyesight, would confine them in a cell where, in order to amuse himself  he could observe incognito their conduct through a trap-door, in order  to have occasion to cruelly punish all those who in walking should hurt  each other; but who would reward splendidly the small number of those to  whom the sight was spared, for having the skill to avoid an encounter  with their comrades. Such are the ideas which the dogma of gratuitous  predestination gives of Divinity!    Although men repeat to us that their God is infinitely good, it is  evident that in the bottom of their hearts they can believe nothing of  it. How can we love anything we do not know? How can we love a being,  the idea of whom is but liable to keep us in anxiety and trouble? How  can we love a being of whom all that is told conspires to render him  supremely hateful?          LXIII.--ALL RELIGION INSPIRES BUT A COWARDLY AND INORDINATE FEAR OF THE  DIVINITY.    Many people make a subtle distinction between true religion and  superstition; they tell us that the latter is but a cowardly and  inordinate fear of Divinity, that the truly religious man has confidence  in his God, and loves Him sincerely; while the superstitious man sees in  Him but an enemy, has no confidence in Him, and represents Him as a  suspicious and cruel tyrant, avaricious of His benefactions and prodigal  of His chastisements. But does not all religion in reality give us these  same ideas of God? While we are told that God is infinitely good, is it  not constantly repeated to us that He is very easily offended, that He  bestows His favors but upon a few, that He chastises with fury those to  whom He has not been pleased to grant them?          LXIV.--THERE IS IN REALITY NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RELIGION AND THE MOST  SOMBRE AND SERVILE SUPERSTITION.    If we take our ideas of God from the nature of the things where we find  a mixture of good and evil, this God, according to the good and evil  which we experience, does naturally appear to us capricious, inconstant,  sometimes good, sometimes wicked, and in this way, instead of exciting  our love, He must produce suspicion, fear, and uncertainty in our  hearts. There is no real difference between natural religion and the  most sombre and servile superstition. If the Theist sees God but on the  beautiful side, the superstitious man looks upon Him from the most  hideous side. The folly of the one is gay of the other is lugubrious;  but both are equally delirious.          LXV.--ACCORDING TO THE IDEAS WHICH THEOLOGY GIVES OF DIVINITY, TO LOVE  GOD IS IMPOSSIBLE.    If I take my ideas of God from theology, God shows Himself to me in such  a light as to repel love. The devotees who tell us that they love their  God sincerely, are either liars or fools who see their God but in  profile; it is impossible to love a being, the thought of whom tends to  excite terror, and whose judgments make us tremble. How can we face  without fear, a God whom we suppose sufficiently barbarous to wish to  damn us forever? Let them not speak to us of a filial or respectful fear  mingled with love, which men should have for their God. A son can not  love his father when he knows he is cruel enough to inflict exquisite  torments upon him; in short, to punish him for the least faults. No man  upon earth can have the least spark of love for a God who holds in  reserve eternal, hard, and violent chastisements for ninety-nine  hundredths of His children.          LXVI.--BY THE INVENTION OF THE DOGMA OF THE ETERNAL TORMENTS OF HELL,  THEOLOGIANS HAVE MADE OF THEIR GOD A DETESTABLE BEING, MORE WICKED THAN  THE MOST WICKED OF MEN, A PERVERSE AND CRUEL TYRANT WITHOUT AIM.    The inventors of the dogma of eternal torments in hell, have made of the  God whom they call so good, the most detestable of beings. Cruelty in  man is the last term of corruption. There is no sensitive soul but is  moved and revolts at the recital alone of the torments which the  greatest criminal endures; but cruelty merits the greater indignation  when we consider it gratuitous or without motive. The most sanguinary  tyrants, Caligula, Nero, Domitian, had at least some motive in  tormenting their victims and insulting their sufferings; these motives  were, either their own safety, the fury of revenge, the design to  frighten by terrible examples, or perhaps the vanity to make parade of  their power, and the desire to satisfy a barbarous curiosity. Can a God  have any of these motives? In tormenting the victims of His wrath, He  would punish beings who could not really endanger His immovable power,  nor trouble His felicity, which nothing can change. On the other hand,  the sufferings of the other life would be useless to the living, who can  not witness them; these torments would be useless to the damned, because  in hell is no more conversion, and the hour of mercy is passed; from  which it follows, that God, in the exercise of His eternal vengeance,  would have no other aim than to amuse Himself and insult the weakness of  His creatures. I appeal to the whole human race! Is there in nature a  man so cruel as to wish in cold blood to torment, I do not say his  fellow-beings, but any sentient being whatever, without fee, without  profit, without curiosity, without having anything to fear? Conclude,  then, O theologians! that according to your own principles, your God is  infinitely more wicked than the most wicked of men. You will tell me,  perhaps, that infinite offenses deserve infinite chastisements, and I  will tell you that we can not offend a God whose happiness is infinite.  I will tell you further, that offenses of finite beings can not be  infinite; that a God who does not want to be offended, can not consent  to make His creatures' offenses last for eternity; I will tell you that  a God infinitely good, can not be infinitely cruel, nor grant His  creatures infinite existence solely for the pleasure of tormenting them  forever.    It could have been but the most cruel barbarity, the most notorious  imposition, but the blindest ambition which could have created the dogma  of eternal damnation. If there exists a God who could be offended or  blasphemed, there would not be upon earth any greater blasphemers than  those who dare to say that this God is perverse enough to take pleasure  in dooming His feeble creatures to useless torments for all eternity.          LXVII.--THEOLOGY IS BUT A SERIES OF PALPABLE CONTRADICTIONS.    To pretend that God can be offended with the actions of men, is to  annihilate all the ideas that are given to us of this being. To say that  man can disturb the order of the universe, that he can grasp the  lightning from God's hand, that he can upset His projects, is to claim  that man is stronger than his God, that he is the arbiter of His will,  that it depends on him to change His goodness into cruelty. Theology  does nothing but destroy with one hand that which it builds with the  other. If all religion is founded upon a God who becomes angry, and who  is appeased, all religion is founded upon a palpable contradiction.    All religions agree in exalting the wisdom and the infinite power of the  Divinity; but as soon as they expose His conduct, we discover but  imprudence, want of foresight, weakness, and folly. God, it is said,  created the world for Himself; and so far He has not succeeded in making  Himself properly respected! God has created men in order to have in His  dominion subjects who would render Him homage; and we continually see  men revolt against Him!          LXVIII.--THE PRETENDED WORKS OF GOD DO NOT PROVE AT ALL WHAT WE CALL  DIVINE PERFECTION.    We are continually told of the Divine perfections; and as soon as we ask  the proofs of them, we are shown the works in which we are assured that  these perfections are written in ineffaceable characters. All these  works, however, are imperfect and perishable; man, who is regarded as  the masterpiece, as the most marvelous work of Divinity, is full of  imperfections which render him disagreeable in the eyes of the Almighty  workman who has formed him; this surprising work becomes often so  revolting and so odious to its Author, that He"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17615"],[0,"In Search of the Okapi (#10)"],[1,"cutting them up for a great feed, we could free Muata  undetected.\"    \"That is not so bad,\" said Compton, judiciously.    \"Not at all,\" said Mr. Hume. \"But when Muata is free, what is to  become of him--suppose, that is, he can get away unobserved?\"    \"I have it,\" said Compton. \"The Zanzibar spy suggested it. Let Muata  wait for us up the river, and we will pick him up.\"    Mr. Hume stroked his beard for some moments in silence.    \"We'll, try that plan,\" he said finally; \"but don't show any  excitement. The native, remember, is a very keen observer. Now pull  the boat in.\"        CHAPTER VI    THE FLIGHT    In the afternoon the village hummed with excitement. The word had  gone round that the new white man who had shot the crocodile would  give a feast, and the people squatted in rows on the bank watching a  couple of their stalwart fellows preparing a canoe for an expedition  after the river-horse.  When Mr. Hume appeared with his Express in  company with the Belgian officers, who were indifferent sportsmen,  the people saluted him with a feeling of gratitude for favours to  come in the shape of fat meat.    \"Good luck,\" said the junior officer, \"but I back the animals; they  are very wary and very fierce.\"    \"What is the betting?\" cried the hunter.    \"Oh no, my friend!\" exclaimed the senior. \"Keep your money for to-  night; and don't drown yourself. We must have one game, you know.\"    \"Very well. By the way, Compton?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"You and Venning may as well amuse yourselves by getting the stores  on board in case we leave to-morrow.\"    \"That depends on how the game goes,\" replied the officer. \"If you  win, we must keep you for a return match.\"    \"That is only fair. But I may lose; so, my lads, go on with the  packing.\"    The boat went off up the river hugging the banks, and the whole  village sat down to watch the stalk, all but a few who went to and  fro between Venning at the house and Compton in the boat, carrying  the stores. The two officers turned in, with mats drawn, to enjoy  their siesta, and the guards on duty sought the shade of the trees  by the bank to watch the hunt.    The hunt was not a matter to be decided out of hand, by a swift  paddle straight up to the sand-bank in the river, and a chance shot.    The canoe crept up slowly and passed out of sight. The old hunters  in the watching crowd took counsel together, and then the chief of  them announced what would happen. The \"slayer of crocodiles\" would,  he declared, get above the island and then slowly descend with the  current upon the river-horse.    \"May he shoot straight and his powder be strong,\" shouted a river-  man; \"for it is the father of bulls who sleeps there--he who has  eaten many canoes.\"    \"It is the same,\" said the old hunter; and, taking a pinch of snuff,  he began to tell the deeds of the old bull hippo.    So the drowsy afternoon passed lazily away to the watchers, and  wearily to the white boys. Their thoughts were in the canoe, and,  moreover, they were irritated by the slowness of the men who carried  the parcels. No man would carry more than one package at a time, and  after each journey he sat down to rest and discuss the chances for  and against the feast.    When the shadows were creeping across the deserted square--deserted  save for the man bound to the post, Venning for the hundredth time  looked across with an aching desire to rush over and cut the bonds.  As his eyes ranged sadly over the bronzed figure, he detected a  movement in the shadow of a hut opposite. Looking more attentively,  he saw the round ears of a jackal, and then made out the sharp face  resting between the outstretched paws, and the yellow eyes fixed  intently on the chief.    Muata lifted his head slowly, as if it were top heavy for the  muscles of his neck, and his gaze went sideways to see if any  watched.    Venning nodded eagerly from the shelter of the room; made a movement  with his hands as if he were cutting; pointed up the river and  spread his arms like a swimmer.    Muata let fall his head again, with his chin on his naked breast;  and the carriers ranged up for the last load. A shout from the bank  made them hurry. Several people who had gone to see about their  fires rushed, yelling, across the square to the bank.    \"It was as I said,\" shouted the old black hunter. \"See where he  creeps down-stream on the bull.\" \"Wow! he has hidden the canoe in  leaves. It is as a tree floating.\"    \"Ow ay, we smell meat!\" sang a big man, stamping his feet.    \"We smell meat--red meat, fat meat; the red meat of the fat cow for  the women; the tough meat of the old bull for the men;\" and the  women clapped their hands.    The Belgian officers were awakened, and stepped out of their  darkened rooms. They found the village empty, save for Venning  stooping over his last parcel, and Muata at his post with what  looked like a yellow native our lying at his feet.    \"The bull opens his mouth!\" chanted the old hunter. \"He wakes from  his sleep! There is the smell of man on the wind! He looks around!  He sees a tree borne on the current! He will surely eat lead!\"    Venning picked up his parcel and followed the officers. Out of the  comer of his eye he saw the seeming yellow cur lift its head and  smell at the thongs which were bound about the prisoner's legs. Then  he hurried on.    \"Wow! the bull drives, the cow into the water. He is cunning. Ow ay,  he knows.\"    \"What does he know, old talker?\" asked one of the officers.    \"The cow is fat,\" laughed the old man.  \"The hunter would shoot the  fat cow first, and so the bull makes her take the risk. He is wise.\"    \"He is shameless!\" screamed the women.    \"See them?\" said Compton, offering his glasses to Venning and  pointing up-stream.    Far up Venning saw three dark objects on the shining glance of the  vast river. One, the canoe fringed with branches, slowly drifting  upon the other two, raised but a few feet above the water on a  gleaming yellow sand island. One hippo, with its huge head swinging,  was standing up, looking not unlike an overfed prize pig. Then the  other rose, and the two walked towards the water.    \"Wow! the old bull keeps on the safe side. I said it; he is wise.\"    \"Shameless!\" cried the women.    \"Wherefore does the crocodile-slayer delay? Surely he knows the body  will sink in the river if it reach the water.\"    \"The smoke! He fires!\"    \"The cow is down! To the boats children--to the boats!\"    Men and boys made a rush, and, out of a tremendous uproar of  splashing and shouting, half a dozen canoes were flying at full  speed for the cow's meat, altogether indifferent to the future  proceedings.    \"The smoke again! The bull has it! He is down; he is up; he is in  the water! Wow! Look out, O 'slayer of crocodiles!'\"    \"But the cow lies still!\" cried a woman, anxiously.    \"Oh ay, there will be meat for the feast. But what of your man in  the canoe if the bull seize him?\"    \"It is his risk,\" said the woman, calmly.    Venning dropped the glass, and he and Compton stood looking from the  island to the old hunter, who seemed to know every point in the game  better than they could follow through the glasses.    \"Ah, it is well. They tear the branches from the canoe. They row  straight for the island. The white man jumps--the men tumble out--  wow-wow!--the bull takes the canoe in his jaws. It will go hard with  those who go for the meat if he get among them.\"    \"The white man leaps in the water!\" shouted another. \"But he holds  his gun above him. He reaches the sand; the others crawl up also.  They run! I do not see the bull!\"    \"There are crocodiles!\" shrilled a woman, pointing with an arm  heavily ringed with brass bangles.    \"This is not their fight, mother.\"    \"But they will take our meat.\"    \"It is the bull I think of.\"  \"Will he meet the canoes, or will he  face the three on the island? The white man sees the canoes; he  waves them to go back, but they smell meat; they keep on.\"  \"What is  this? He points his gun at them. They stop; they turn back.\"    \"A pity,\" said one of the officers, with a grin.  \"We should have  seen sport.\"    \"But the sport is not over,\" said the other. \"I back the bull.  Remember how he put you to flight, my friend. What is the meaning of  this, old man?\"--this to a hunter.    \"Surely, O great one, it means one thing. The white man is afraid  the canoes would draw the bull away. He wishes the bull to land--to  attack him.\"    \"More fool he, ay, my friend,\" said the officer, with a sneer.    \"One of the men on the island is pointing,\" said Compton, who had  taken up the glasses again. \"I see something in the water where the  canoe went down.\"    \"I said it,\" shouted the old black; \"the bull will fight. Stand,  fast, O white man, for it is either you or he.\"    Those watching saw the bull land and hurl himself with amazing  swiftness at Mr. Hume.    \"Why doesn't he shoot?\" yelled Compton.    \"Wow! the white man springs aside. The bull squeals; he staggers; he  is down. Behind the ear. I say it. There the bullet went in. There  will be much meat.\" The old man took snuff, and cast a proud look  around as if he alone had done the deed.    \"By Jove!\" muttered Venning, wiping his forehead. \"It seemed a near  squeak.\"    The two officers went back to their cool rooms, and the crowd broke  up, the women and children going off dancing to collect firewood.  The little fleet of canoes descended on the island, and in a few  minutes the carcasses were hidden by bands of naked men, who slashed  and cut, while crocodiles, attracted by the blood, appeared from all  directions. In a very short time the fleet returned, and Mr. Hume,  standing in a heavily laden craft, ran a greater risk than when he  faced the savage old bull, for the gunwales were flush with the  water, and the men were utterly reckless as they dashed along at the  head of the flotilla.    As the men leapt ashore, women seized the meat, and the village at  once"]]]
