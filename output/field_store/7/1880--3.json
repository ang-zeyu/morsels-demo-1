The difficulty was  to draw these two future friends together, and to bring them face to  face without their coming to blows; the god sent his courier Saidu,  the hunter, to study the habits of the monster, and to find out the  necessary means to persuade him to come down peaceably to Uruk.  \"Saidu, the hunter, proceeded to meet Eabani near the entrance of the  watering-place. One day, two days, three days, Eabani met him at the  entrance of the watering-place. He perceived Saidu, and his countenance  darkened: he entered the enclosure, he became sad, he groaned, he cried  with a loud voice, his heart was heavy, his features were distorted,  sobs burst from his breast. The hunter saw from a distance that his face  was inflamed with anger,\" and judging it more prudent not to persevere  farther in his enterprise, returned to impart to the god what he had  observed.         * Smith was the first, I believe, to compare his form to       that of a satyr or faun; this comparison is rendered more       probable by the fact that the modern inhabitants of Chaldaea       believe in the existence of similar monsters. A. Jeremias       places Eabani alongside Priapus, who is generally a god of       the fields, and a clever soothsayer. Following out these       ideas, we might compare our Eabani with the Graico-Roman       Proteus, who pastures the flocks of the sea, and whom it was       necessary to pursue and seize by force or cunning words to       compel him to give oracular predictions.

He had filled up the pit which I had dug to trap him, he  broke the nets which I had spread, he delivered from my hands the cattle  and the beasts of the field, he did not allow me to search the country  through.\" Shamash thought that where the strongest man might fail by the  employment of force, a woman might possibly succeed by the attractions  of pleasure; he commanded Saidu to go quickly to Uruk and there to  choose from among the priestesses of Ishtar one of the most beautiful.**  The hunter presented himself before Grilgames, recounted to him his  adventures, and sought his permission to take away with him one of the  sacred courtesans. \"'Go, my hunter, take the priestess; when the beasts  come to the watering-place, let her display her beauty; he will see  her, he will approach her, and his beasts that troop around him will be  scattered.'\"*** The hunter went, he took with him the priestess, he took  the straight road; the third day they arrived at the fatal plain. The  hunter and the priestess sat down to rest; one day, two days, they sat  at the entrance of the watering-place from whose waters Eabani drank  along with the animals, where he sported with the beasts of the water.         * Haupt, Das Babylonische Nimrodepos, p. 9, 11. 42-50. The       beginning of each line is destroyed, and the translation of       the whole is only approximate.         ** The priestesses of Ishtar were young and beautiful women,       devoted to the service of the goddess and her worshippers.       Besides the title _qadishtu,_ priestess, they bore various       names, _kizireti, ukhati, kharimati_; the priestess who       accompanied Saidu was an _ukhat_.         *** As far as can be guessed from the narrative, interrupted       as it is by so many lacunae, the power of Eabani over the       beasts of the field seems to have depended on his       continence. From the moment in which he yields to his       passions the beasts fly from him as they would do from an       ordinary mortal; there is then no other resource for him but       to leave the solitudes to live among men in towns. This       explains the means devised by Shamash against him: cf. in       the _Arabian Nights_ the story of Shehabeddin.    \"When Eabani arrived, he who dwells in the mountains, and who browses  upon the grass like the gazelles, who drinks with the animals, who  sports with the beasts of the water, the priestess saw the satyr.\" She  was afraid and blushed, but the hunter recalled her to her duty. \"It is  he, priestess. Undo thy garment, show him thy form, that he may be  taken with thy beauty; be not ashamed, but deprive him of his soul. He  perceives thee, he is rushing towards thee, arrange thy garment; he is  coming upon thee, receive him with every art of woman; his beasts  which troop around him will be scattered, and he will press thee to his  breast.\" The priestess did as she was commanded; she received him with  every art of woman, and he pressed her to his breast. Six days and seven  nights, Eabani remained near the priestess, his well-beloved. When he  got tired of pleasure he turned his face towards his cattle, and he saw  that the gazelles had turned aside and that the beasts of the field had  fled far from him. Eabani was alarmed, he fell into a swoon, his knees  became stiff because his cattle had fled from him. While he lay as if  dead, he heard the voice of the priestess: he recovered his senses,  he came to himself full of love; he seated himself at the feet of the  priestess, he looked into her face, and while the priestess spoke his  ears listened. For it was to him the priestess spoke--to him, Eabani.  \"Thou who art superb, Eabani, as a god, why dost thou live among  the beasts of the field? Come, I will conduct thee to Uruk the  well-protected, to the glorious house, the dwelling of Anu and  Ishtar--to the place where is Gilgames, whose strength is supreme, and  who, like a Urus, excels the heroes in strength.\" While she thus spoke  to him, he hung upon her words, he the wise of heart, he realized  by anticipation a friend. Eabani said to the priestess: \"Let us go,  priestess; lead me to the glorious and holy abode of Anu and Ishtar--to  the place where is Gilgames, whose strength is supreme, and who, like  a Urus, prevails over the heroes by his strength. I will fight with him  and manifest to him my power; I will send forth a panther against Uruk,  and he must struggle with it.\"* The priestess conducted her prisoner  to Uruk, but the city at that moment was celebrating the festival of  Tammuz, and Gilgames did not care to interrupt the solemnities in order  to face the tasks to which Eabani had invited him: what was the use of  such trials since the gods themselves had deigned to point out to him in  a dream the line of conduct he was to pursue, and had taken up the  cause of their children. Shamash, in fact, began the instruction of the  monster, and sketched an alluring picture of the life which awaited him  if he would agree not to return to his mountain home. Not only would  the priestess belong to him for ever, having none other than him for  husband, but Gilgames would shower upon him riches and honours. \"He will  give thee wherein to sleep a great bed cunningly wrought; he will seat  thee on his divan, he will give thee a place on his left hand, and  the princes of the earth shall kiss thy feet, the people of Uruk  shall grovel on the ground before thee.\" It was by such flatteries  and promises for the future that Gilgames gained the affection of his  servant Eabani, whom he loved for ever.         * I have softened down a good deal the account of the       seduction, which is described with a sincerity and precision       truly primitive.    Shamash had reasons for being urgent. Khumbaba, King of Elam, had  invaded the country of the Euphrates, destroyed the temples, and  substituted for the national worship the cult of foreign deities;* the  two heroes in concert could alone check his advance, and kill him. They  collected their troops, set out on the march, having learned from a  female magician that the enemy had concealed himself in a sacred grove.  They entered it in disguise, \"and stopped in rapture for a moment before  the cedar trees; they contemplated the height of them, they contemplated  the thickness of them; the place where Khumbaba was accustomed to walk  up and down with rapid strides, alleys were made in it, paths kept up  with great care. They saw at length the hill of cedars, the abode of the  gods, the sanctuary of Irnini, and before the hill, a magnificent cedar,  and pleasant grateful shade.\" They surprised Khumbaba at the moment when  he was about to take his outdoor exercise, cut off his head, and came  back in triumph to Uruk.** \"Gilgames brightened his weapons, he polished  his weapons. He put aside his war-harness, he put on his white garments,  he adorned himself with the royal insignia, and bound on the diadem:  Gilgames put his tiara on his head, and bound on his diadem.\"         * Khumbaba contains the name of the Elamite god, Khumba,       whichenters into the composition of names of towns, like Ti-       Khumbi; or into those of princes, as Khumbanigash,       Khumbasundasa, Khumbasidh. The comparison between Khumbaba       and Combabos, the hero of a singular legend, current in the       second century of our era, does not seem to be admissible,       at least for the present. The names agree well in sound,       but, as Oppert has rightly said, no event in the history of       Combabos finds a counterpart in anything we know of that of       Khumbaba up to the present.         ** G. Smith places at this juncture Gilgames's accession to       the throne; this is not confirmed by the fragments of the       text known up to the present, and it is not even certain       that the poem relates anywhere the exaltation and coronation"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17324"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 4 (of 12) (#10)"],[1,"ains, at the head of the Nar-Khammurabi, the source of wealth to  the people. This fortress I called Dur-Sinmuballit-abim-ualidiya, the  Fortress of Sinmuballit, the father who begat me, so that the name of  Sinmuballit, the father who begat me, may endure in the habitations of  the world.\"         * Contract dated \"the year the Tigris, river of the gods,       was canalized down to the sea\"; i.e. as far as the point to       which the sea then penetrated in the environs of Kornah.    This canal of Khammurabi ran from a little south of Babylon, joining  those of Siniddinam and Rimsin, and probably cutting the alluvial plain  in its entire length.* It drained the stagnant marshes on either side  along its course, and by its fertilising effects, the dwellers on its  banks were enabled to reap full harvests from the lands which previously  had been useless for purposes of cultivation. A ditch of minor  importance pierced the isthmus which separates the Tigris and the  Euphrates in the neighbourhood of Sippar.** Khammurabi did not rest  contented with these; a system of secondary canals doubtless completed  the whole scheme of irrigation which he had planned after the  achievement of his conquest, and his successors had merely to keep up  his work in order to ensure an unrivalled prosperity to the empire.         * Delattre is of opinion that the canal dug by Khammurabi is       the Arakhtu of later epochs which began at Babylon and       extended as far as the Larsa canal. It must therefore be       approximately identified with the Shatt-en-Nil of the       present day, which joins Shatt-el-Kaher, the canal of       Siniddinam.         ** The canal which Khammurabi caused to be dug or dredged       may be the Nar-Malka, or \"royal canal,\" which ran from the       Tigris to the Euphrates, passing Sippar on the way. The       digging of this canal is mentioned in a contract.    Their efforts in this direction were not unsuccessful. Samsuiluna,  the son of Khammurabi, added to the existing system two or three  fresh canals, one at least of which still bore his name nearly fifteen  centuries later; it is mentioned in the documents of the second Assyrian  empire in the time of Assurbanipal, and it is possible that traces of  it may still be found at the present day. Abieshukh,* Ammisatana,**  Ammizadugga,*** and Samsusatana,**** all either continued to elaborate  the network planned by their ancestors, or applied themselves to the  better distribution of the overflow in those districts where cultivation  was still open to improvement.         * Abishukh (the Hebrew Abishua) is the form of the name       which we find in contemporary contracts. The official lists       contain the variant Ebishu, Ebishum.         ** Ammiditana is only a possible reading: others prefer       Ammisatana. The Nar-Ammisatana is mentioned in a Sippar       contract. Another contract is dated \"the year in which       Ammisatana, the king, repaired the canal of Samsuiluna.\"         *** This was, at first, read Ammididugga. Ammizadugga is       mentioned in the date of a contract as having executed       certain works--of what nature it is not easy to say--on the       banks of the Tigris; another contract is dated \"the year in       which Ammizadugga, the king, by supreme command of Sha-mash,       his master, [dug] the Ndr-Ammizadugga-nulchus-nishi (canal       of Ammizadugga), prosperity of men.\" In the Minaean       inscriptions of Southern Arabia the name is found under the       form of Ammi-Zaduq.         **** Sometimes erroneously read Samdiusatana; but, as a       matter of fact, we have contracts of that time, in which a       royal name is plainly written as Samsusatana.    We should know nothing of these kings had not the scribes of those times  been in the habit of dating the contracts of private individuals by  reference to important national events. They appear to have chosen  by preference incidents in the religious life of the country; as, for  instance, the restoration of a temple, the annual enthronisation of one  of the great divinities, such as Shamash, Merodach, Ishtar, or Nana,  as the eponymous god of the current year, the celebration of a solemn  festival, or the consecration of a statue; while a few scattered  allusions to works of fortification show that meanwhile the defence of  the country was jealously watched over.* These sovereigns appear to have  enjoyed long reigns, the shortest extending over a period of five and  twenty years; and when at length the death of any king occurred, he was  immediately replaced by his son, the notaries' acts and the judicial  documents which have come down to us betraying no confusion or abnormal  delay in the course of affairs. We may, therefore, conclude that the  last century and a half of the dynasty was a period of peace and  of material prosperity. Chaldaea was thus enabled to fully reap the  advantage of being united under the rule of one individual. It is quite  possible that those cities--Uru, Larsa, Ishin, Uruk, and Nippur--which  had played so important a part in the preceding centuries, suffered from  the loss of their prestige, and from the blow dealt to their traditional  pretensions.         * Samsuiluna repaired the five fortresses which his ancestor       Sumulailu had built. Contract dated \"the year in which       Ammisatana, the king, built Dur-Ammisatana, near the Sin       river,\" and \"the year in which Ammisatana, the king, gave       its name to Dur-Iskunsin, near the canal of       Ammisatana.\" Contract dated \"the year in which the King       Ammisatana repaired Dur-Iskunsin.\" Contract dated \"the year in       which Samsuiluna caused 'the wall of Uru and Uruk' to be       built.\"    Up to this time they had claimed the privilege of controlling the  history of their country, and they had bravely striven among themselves  for the supremacy over the southern states; but the revolutions which  had raised each in turn to the zenith of power, had never exalted any  one of them to such an eminence as to deprive its rivals of all hope of  supplanting it and of enjoying the highest place. The rise of Babylon  destroyed the last chance which any of them had of ever becoming the  capital; the new city was so favourably situated, and possessed so much  wealth and so many soldiers, while its kings displayed such tenacious  energy, that its neighbours were forced to bow before it and resign  themselves to the subordinate position of leading provincial towns. They  gave a loyal obedience to the officers sent them from the north, and  sank gradually into obscurity, the loss of their political supremacy  being somewhat compensated for by the religious respect in which they  were always held. Their ancient divinities--Nana, Sin, Anu, and Ra--were  adopted, if we may use the term, by the Babylonians, who claimed the  protection of these gods as fully as they did that of Merodach or of  Nebo, and prided themselves on amply supplying all their needs. As the  inhabitants of Babylon had considerable resources at their disposal,  their appeal to these deities might be regarded as productive of more  substantial results than the appeal of a merely local kinglet. The  increase of the national wealth and the concentration, under one head,  of armies hitherto owning several chiefs, enabled the rulers, not  of Babylon or Larsa alone, but of the whole of Chaldaea, to offer  an invincible resistance to foreign enemies, and to establish their  dominion in countries where their ancestors had enjoyed merely a  precarious sovereignty. Hostilities never completely ceased between  Elam and Babylon; if arrested for a time, they broke out again in  some frontier disturbance, at times speedily suppressed, but at others  entailing violent consequences and ending in a regular war. No document  furnishes us with any detailed account of these outbreaks, but it  would appear that the balance of power was maintained on the whole with  tolerable regularity, both kingdoms at the close of each generation  finding themselves in much the same position as they had occupied at its  commencement. The two empires were separated from south to north by  the sea and the Tigris, the frontier leaving the river near the present  village of Amara and running in the direction of the mountains. Durilu  probably fell ordinarily under Chaldaean jurisdiction. Umliyash was  included in the original domain of Kham-murabi, and there is no reason  to believe that it was evacuated by his descendants. There is every  probability that they possessed the plain east of the Tigris, comprising  Nineveh and Arbela, and that the majority of the civilized peoples  scattered over the lower slopes of the Kurdish mountains rendered them  homage. They kept the Mesopotamian table-land under their suzerainty,  and we may affirm, without exaggeration, that their power extended  northwards as far as Mount Masios, and westwards to the middle course of  the Euphrates.    At what period the Chaldaeans first crossed that river is as yet unknown.  Many of their rulers in their inscriptions claim the title of suzerains  over Syria, and we have no evidence for denying their pretensions.  Kudur-mabug proclaims himself \"adda\" of Martu, Lord of the countries of  the West, and we are in the possession of several facts which suggest  the idea of a great Blamite empire, with a dominion extending for some  period over Western Asia, the existence of which was vaguely hinted  at by the Greeks, who attributed its glory to the fabulous Memnon.*  Contemporary records are still wanting which might show whether  Kudur-mabug inherited these distant possessions from one of his  predecessors--such as Kudur-nakhunta, for instance--or whether he  won them himself at the point of the sword; but a fragment of an old  chronicle, inserted in the Hebrew Scriptures, speaks distinctly of  another Elamite, who made war in person almost up to the Egyptian  frontier.** This is"]]]
