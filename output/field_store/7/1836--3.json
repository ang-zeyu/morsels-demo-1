His name was John Colet. He was born in London, in  the year 1466, within three months of his famous friend, Erasmus. His  father, Sir Henry Colet, was twice Lord Mayor, one of the richest  members of the Mercers' Company. John, who was his eldest son, had ten  brothers and eleven sisters, all by the same mother, who outlived  the last of them. The young man was presented to livings (it was no  unusual thing then) before he took Orders, and gave himself to  study, both mathematical and classical, and in his zeal for learning  travelled much abroad, where he saw much of ecclesiastical life,  which startled him greatly. Returning, at length, to England, he was  ordained at Christmas, 1497, went to Oxford, and began to lecture with  great power on the Epistle to the Romans. It must be remembered that  this was the epoch when the fall of Constantinople had driven the  Greek scholars westward, the epoch of the revival of \"the new  learning\" in Europe, the discrediting of the old scholastic philosophy  which was now worn out and ready to vanish away. Colet stands before  us then as the representative of the new learning in England, and as  keen to reform the abuses in the Church which were terrifying all  earnest and thoughtful men. He carried on his lectures with such  energy that his lecture-room was crowded, the most distinguished  tutors there being among his audience. And one day there came the  great Erasmus, who had heard of him, and from the day of their first  meeting they were fast friends for life. In 1504, Henry VII. made  Colet Dean of St. Paul's, and he showed at once that he had lost none  of his zeal. He carried on his lectures in the cathedral and preached  constantly, and another warm friend made now was Sir Thomas More,  who earnestly helped him in his strenuous endeavours to improve the  cathedral statutes, to reform abuses, and to increase the preaching  power. He was a rich man, and in 1509 he employed much of his  wealth--about L40,000 present value--in the foundation of St. Paul's  School. He wrote some simple precepts for the guidance of masters and  scholars, and drew up prayers and an English version of the Creed. He  appointed William Lilly first master, and called on Linacre to write  a Latin grammar. The school became famous; it was burnt down in the  Fire, rebuilt in 1670, and removed to Hammersmith in 1884. It is not  to be wondered at that many of the churchmen of the day regarded Colet  as a most dangerous innovator. Complaints were made to Archbishop  Warham that he was favouring the Lollards, which was absolutely  untrue. He would in all probability, had he lived, have been found  on the same side as More and Fisher, that is, intensely desirous to  preserve the Church and its doctrines, but to cleanse it from the foul  scandals, the sloth, greed, immorality, which were patent to all  the world. There was a meeting of Convocation in February, 1512, to  consider how to extirpate the Lollard heresy which was reviving.  Warham appointed Colet to preach the sermon, which he did with  wonderful energy, denouncing the simony, the self-indulgence, and the  ignorance of the bishops and clergy. The Lollards were there in great  numbers, attentive, silent listeners. He was as plain and honest with  the King himself, who, recognising his goodness of purpose, made him  a Royal Chaplain. In 1514, he went with Erasmus on pilgrimage to  Becket's tomb and ridiculed the accounts which the vergers gave of the  healing power of the relics. When Wolsey was installed as Cardinal,  Colet preached, and warned him against worldly ambition. And all  through his time at St. Paul's the aged Bishop Fitzhugh was in active  hostility to him. He died September 16th, 1519, and, although he had  requested that only his name should be inscribed on his grave, the  Mercers' Company erected a handsome tomb, for which Lilly wrote a long  inscription. Lilly and Linacre were both buried near him.    It will be seen, I think, at once that Colet is a great representative  of the thoughtful and earnest men of his time, one of the greatest  precursors of the Reformers, or rather, in full sense, a great  reformer himself. We have now to take up the course of secular events.  In 1514, Pope Leo X. sent young King Henry VIII. a \"sword and cap of  maintenance\" as a special honour, and he, \"in robe of purple, satin,  and gold in chequer, and jewelled collar,\" came to the Bishop's  palace, and from thence there was a grand procession of  gorgeously-arrayed nobles and clerics round the church, with joyous  hymns.    Four years later came Wolsey, and sang High Mass to celebrate eternal  peace between England, France, and Spain. The King's beautiful  sister, Mary, was betrothed at the same time to Louis XII., who was  fifty-three years old, while she was sixteen. Within three months he  died, and she married Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, and became  grandmother of Lady Jane Grey. Again one comes on a full description  of the gorgeous ceremonial. A year later, the accession of Charles V.  was announced by the Heralds in St. Paul's, and Wolsey pronounced a  benediction. The great Cardinal was now in full hopes of the papal  tiara; the same year he came in state (May 12th, 1521) with the  Archbishop of Canterbury, Warham, to hear Bishop Fisher denounce  Luther at Paul's Cross, with accompanying appropriate ceremonies. An  account on a broad-sheet in the British Museum tells how Wolsey came  with the most part of the bishops of the realm, \"where he was received  with procession and censed by Mr. Richard Pace, Dean of the said  church.\" Pace was a native of Winchester, who had won the favour of  two successive bishops of that See, and been educated by them. One of  them sent him to the Continent to complete his course. He took Orders  in 1510, and his evident ability induced Wolsey to employ him in more  than one delicate and difficult case of foreign diplomacy, and also  brought him to the favourable notice of the King, who, after many  other preferments, made him Dean of St. Paul's on the death of Colet.  He was held to be the very ablest of diplomatists, was a friend of  Erasmus, and followed Colet in favouring \"the new learning.\" It was he  and Sir T. More who persuaded the King to found Greek professorships  at Oxford and Cambridge.    But to return to the ceremony at St. Paul's. \"After the Dean had duly  censed him, the Cardinal, while four doctors bore a canopy of gold  over him, went to the high altar, where he made his obligation; which  done, he went, as before, to the Cross in the churchyard, where was a  scaffold set up. On this he seated himself under his cloth of estate,  his two crosses on each side of him; on his right hand, sitting on the  place where he set his feet, the Pope's ambassador, and next him the  Archbishop of Canterbury; on his left hand, the Emperor's ambassador,  and next him the Bishop of Durham (Rusthall); and all the other  bishops, with other noble prelates, sat on two forms out right forth,  and then the Bishop of Rochester made a sermon by the consenting of  the whole clergy of England, by the commandment of the Pope, against  one _Martinus Eleutherus_ and all his works, because he erred sore,  and spake against the Holy Faith; and denounced them accursed which  kept any of his books; and there were many burned in the said  churchyard of his said books during the sermon. Which ended, my Lord  Cardinal went home to dinner with all the other prelates.\"    The Bishop of Rochester was, of course, Fisher. He was both learned  and pious. Burnet says he strongly disliked Wolsey, because of the  latter's notoriously immoral life. Fisher, though in his unflinching  conservatism he regarded the proceedings of Luther with hostility,  was anxious, as were More and Erasmus and Colet, for reformation on  Catholic lines. He, like them, favoured the new learning, and even  declared that the Continental reformers had brought much light to  bear upon religion. But he opposed the King's divorce, and refused to  acknowledge his supremacy over the Church, and was beheaded on Tower  Hill, June 22nd, 1535. There was no act of Henry which more thoroughly  excited popular horror.    When Charles V. came to England, in 1522, Wolsey again said Mass at  St. Paul's, with twenty bishops to cense him. It was on this occasion  that he changed the meeting-place of Convocation from St. Paul's to  Westminster, that it might be near his own house. Skelton, the poet,  who hated Wolsey, thereupon wrote the following distich:--      \"Gentle Paul, lay down thy sword,    For Peter, of Westminster, hath shaven thy beard.\"    In 1524, Francis I. was taken prisoner at the battle of Pavia,  whereupon the sympathy of England for his successful rival was shown  by a huge bonfire in front of St. Paul's, and the distribution of many  hogsheads of claret. On the Sunday following, Wolsey sang Mass, and  the King and Queen, with both Houses of Parliament, were present. Once  more (Shrove Tuesday, 1527) the great Cardinal came in dignity; it was  to denounce the translation of the Bible and to condemn the Lutherans.  Certain \"heretics\" were marched through the cathedral in penitential  dresses, and carrying faggots, which they threw into the fire by the  great rood at the north door, in which Testaments and Lutheran tracts  were also burned. On this occasion, also, Fisher preached the sermon.  A few years later (1530), there was a similar holocaust, at which the  Bishop (Stokesley) presided.    But now came an event of momentous importance. Wolsey fell into  disgrace with the King, and, after some preliminary attacks, was  charged with high treason.

Thus again the Lord preserved his people from their  enemies.    The next day the camp moved five miles out on the prairie. While here, some  of the leading men of Ray county called on the brethren to learn what their  intentions were. Joseph told them how the Saints had been persecuted in  Jackson county; and that they had come one thousand miles with clothing and  provisions for their brethren; that they had no intentions of harming any  one, but their mission was to do good, and if possible help their brethren  to get their lands back again. At the close of their talk, the visitors  promised to do what they could to prevent the mobs from disturbing them,  which promise they kept.    The next day, June 22nd, Sheriff Gillium of Clay county came into camp. He  also wanted to know what the camp was going to do. Joseph explained to him.  In order to get back their lands and live in peace, the Saints proposed to  buy the lands from those who could not live with them in Jackson county,  but nothing came of this and other offers that were made to settle the  trouble.    This same day an important revelation was given through the prophet. The  brethren were told that the Lord did not want them to fight, and that they  must wait for a time before Zion should be redeemed.    During the march of the camp, some of the brethren had found fault and had  not listened to the counsels of the prophet. Joseph had told them that if  they did not repent, sickness would come into the camp and many would die.  This was now fulfilled. On June 22nd, that dread disease called the cholera  appeared in the camp. When you are told that during the next four or five  days sixty-eight of the brethren took the disease and thirteen died, you  may perhaps imagine what a terrible time they had.    On June 23rd they marched into Clay county and camped on Rush creek, where  two days later the camp was disbanded. For two weeks Joseph labored among  the Saints and then he returned to Kirtland. Most of the others also went  back to their homes in the east about the same time.    Topics.--1. Organizing Zion's camp. 2. March of Zion's camp. 3. The camp  on Fishing river. 4. The scourge.    Questions and Review.--1. What was Parley P. Pratt and Lyman Wight's  mission to Kirtland? 2. What instruction did the Lord give them? (See Doc.  and Cov., sec. 103.) 3. How was Zion's camp organized? 4. What was its  object? 5. Through what states did it march? 6. What were Joseph's  teachings about kindness to animals? 7. What was the fate of James  Campbell? 8. How were the brethren saved from their enemies on Fishing  river? 9. What did the brethren propose to the citizens of Jackson? 10. Why  did the scourge come upon the camp? 11. What revelation was given on  Fishing river? 12. Where and when was Zion's camp disbanded?          CHAPTER XVI.    THE CHURCH AT KIRTLAND.      During the time that the Saints were having such a hard time in Missouri,  the Church in and around Kirtland was growing in numbers and strength.  Joseph with many of the elders went on missionary trips to various parts of  the United States and Canada, and many new branches of the Church were  organized.    In September, 1831, Joseph moved to the town of Hiram, about thirty miles  from Kirtland. While living here, he was busy translating the scriptures,  preaching the gospel, and holding meetings. Thirteen of the revelations  found in the Doctrine and Covenants were given at Hiram. One of these  revelations, called the Vision, tells of the three glories which are in  store for the children of God, besides many other grand teachings which  some day you will want to read. (Section 76.)    But wicked men continued to tell false things about Joseph and the Church.  Many people believed these stories, and the result was that the brethren  were often annoyed and badly treated. On the night of March 25th, 1832,  Joseph and Sidney Rigdon were dragged from their homes by an angry mob into  the woods. Sidney was so misused that he was left for dead. Joseph was  beaten and stripped of his clothes, and his body was covered with tar. The  mob also tried to force poison from a bottle into his mouth, but in this  they failed. Notwithstanding this ill treatment, Joseph was able the next  day, it being Sunday, to preach to a large meeting and to baptize three new  converts.    Shortly after this, Joseph made his second visit to Missouri. After his  return, he settled again at Kirtland, where he continued to receive many  revelations and to do much for the building up of the Church.    On December 25, 1832, Joseph received a revelation wherein it was stated  that the time would come when there would be a great war between the  Northern States and the Southern States. Even the place of its beginning  was told, namely, South Carolina.    In February, 1833, a school was opened in Kirtland for the elders of the  Church. It was called the \"School of the Prophets,\" and there the brethren  met and were instructed in the principles of the gospel.    A revelation called the Word of Wisdom was given on the 27th of the same  month. You will find it in the Doctrine and Covenants, section 89, and  every one of you should read it.    On March 18th a very important meeting was held in Kirtland. On that date  Joseph ordained Sidney Rigdon to be his first counselor, and Frederick G.  Williams to be his second counselor, and these three now became the First  Presidency, which is the highest authority in the Church. You have been  told something of Sidney Rigdon. Elder Williams held his position nearly  five years, when he apostatized, and Hyrum Smith was chosen in his stead.  At the death of Joseph Smith, Sen., who was patriarch of the Church, Hyrum  was chosen to fill his position and William Law was called to the office of  second counselor to Joseph. Law held this position until about two months  before the Prophet's death when he was cut off from the Church.    February 17, 1834, the first high council of the Church was organized. This  body consists of twelve men who must be high priests, over which the stake  presidency presides. It is a kind of court. When members of the Church have  trouble one with another which neither they, nor the teachers, nor the  bishop can settle, it is brought before the high council to be adjusted.    Each stake of Zion now has a high council. Here are the names of the first  one organized: besides the First Presidency, Joseph Smith, Sen., John  Smith, Joseph Coe, John Johnson, Martin Harris, John S. Carter, Jared  Carter, Oliver Cowdery, Samuel H. Smith, Orson Hyde, Sylvester Smith and  Luke Johnson.    It was shortly after this that Zion's Camp was organized and made the trip  to Missouri, of which you were told in the last chapter.    After his return Joseph was again busy performing his many duties as  president of the Church.    Topics.--1. Joseph at Hiram. 2. Prophecy on War. 3. Word of Wisdom. 4.  The first presidency. 5. The high council.    Questions and Review.--1. To what two places were the Saints now  gathering? 2. Where is Hiram? 3. What did Joseph do there? 4. Tell about  the mobbing at Hiram. 5. When was the prophecy on war given? 6. How long  after was it fulfilled? 7. What led to the war between the North and the  South? 8. What was the \"School of the Prophets?\" 9. In the Word of Wisdom,  what does the Lord say is not good for the body? 10. What does He say is  good? 11. What promise is made to those who keep the Word of Wisdom? 12.  What is the First Presidency? 13. Who were the first to fill this position?  14. Who are the present First Presidency? 15. What is the duty of the high  council? 16. Name some members of the high council of your stake.          CHAPTER XVII.    THE TWELVE APOSTLES--THE SEVENTIES--THE KIRTLAND TEMPLE.      [Illustration: PRESIDENT BRIGHAM YOUNG.]    On the 14th of February, 1835, Joseph called together the brethren who had  gone with him to Missouri in Zion's Camp. He spoke to the meeting and told  the brethren the Lord had not forgotten them, but had remembered their  faithfulness in answering the call of duty, and now he had a blessing for  them.    Joseph then said the time had come when twelve apostles should be called.  It was the duty of the three witnesses to the Book of Mormon to select  twelve men for this high calling, and these three brethren were then  blessed for this purpose by the First Presidency. The following were then  selected to be the first quorum of Twelve Apostles in the Church: Thomas B.  Marsh, David W. Patten, Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, Orson Hyde, Wm. E.  McLellin, Parley P. Pratt, Luke Johnson, William Smith, Orson Pratt, John  F. Boynton and Lyman E. Johnson.    It is the duty of the Twelve Apostles to build up the Church and regulate  its affairs in all the world under the direction of the First Presidency;  also to open the door of the gospel to all nations.    On the 28th of February there was another meeting held, at which the first  quorum of seventy was organized. You will remember that the Savior, after  He had chosen Twelve Apostles to preach the gospel, chose also seventy to  aid the Twelve in their work. So in our day, twelve men could not do all  the work of spreading the gospel, so it was necessary to call other men. In  this body of men seventy form a quorum. The first quorum was organized from  the brethren who were members of Zion's Camp.    It is the special duty of the Seventies to travel and preach the gospel  under the direction of the Twelve.    As early as May, 1833, the Lord told Joseph that the Saints should build a  house to his name. July 23, the foundation was laid. The Saints in Kirtland  were not many, neither were they rich, and it was therefore a great task  for them to build such a house as the temple. However, they gave donations  of what they had and worked willingly with all their might, until at last  it was finished and dedicated"]]]
