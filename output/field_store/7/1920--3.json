Now the burning summer sun    Hath unchalleng'd empire won    And the scorching winds blow free,    Blighting every herb and tree.                               R. T. H. GRIFFITH.      May in the plains of India! What unpleasant memories it recalls!  Stifling nights in which sleep comes with halting steps and departs  leaving us unrefreshed. Long, dreary days beneath the punkah in a  closed bungalow which has ceased to be enlivened by the voices of the  children and the patter of their little feet. Hot drives to office,  under a brazen sky from which the sun shines with pitiless power, in  the teeth of winds that scorch the face and fill the eyes with dust.    It is in this month of May that the European condemned to existence in  the plains echoes the cry of the psalmist: \"Oh that I had wings like a  dove! for then would I fly away, and be at rest\"--in the Himalayas.  There would I lie beneath the deodars and, soothed by the rustle of  their wind-caressed branches, drink in the pure cool air and listen to  the cheerful double note of the cuckoo. The country-side in the plains  presents a sorry spectacle. The gardens that had some beauty in the  cold weather now display the abomination of desolation--a waste of  shrivelled flowers, killed by the relentless sun. The spring crops  have all been cut and the whole earth is dusty brown save for a few  patches of young sugar-cane and the dust-covered verdure of the mango  topes. It is true that the gold-mohur trees and the Indian laburnums  are in full flower and the air is heavily laden with the strong scent  of the _nim_ blossoms, but the heat is so intense that the European is  able to enjoy these gifts of nature only at dawn. Nor has the ripening  jack-fruit any attractions for him. He is repelled by its overpowering  scent and sickly flavour. Fortunately the tastes of all men are not  alike. In the eyes of the Indian this fruit is a dish fit to be set  before the gods. The _pipal_ trees, which are covered with tender  young leaves, now offer to the birds a feast in the form of numbers of  figs, no larger than cranberries. This generous offer is greedily  accepted by green pigeons, mynas and many other birds which partake  with right goodwill and make much noise between the courses. No matter  how intense the heat be, the patient cultivator issues forth with his  cattle before sunrise and works at his threshing floor until ten  o'clock, then he seeks the comparative coolness of the mango tope and  sleeps until the sun is well on its way to the western horizon, when  he resumes the threshing of the corn, not ceasing until the shades of  night begin to steal over the land.    The birds do not object to the heat. They revel in it. It is true that  in the middle of the day even they seek some shady tree in which to  enjoy a siesta and await the abatement of the heat of the blast  furnace in which they live, move and have their being. The long day,  which begins for them before 4 a.m., rather than the intense heat,  appears to be the cause of this midday sleep. Except during this  period of rest at noon the birds are more lively than they were in  April.    The breeding season is now at its height. In May over five hundred  species of birds nest in India. No individual is likely to come across  all these different kinds of nests, because, in order to do so, that  person would have to traverse India from Peshawar to Tinnevelly and  from Quetta to Tenasserim. Nevertheless, the man who remains in one  station, if he choose to put forth a little energy and defy the sun,  may reasonably expect to find the nests of more than fifty kinds of  birds. Whether he be energetic or the reverse he cannot fail to hear a  great many avian sounds both by day and by night. In May the birds are  more vociferous than at any other time of year. The fluty cries of the  koel and the vigorous screams of the brain-fever bird penetrate the  closed doors of the bungalow, as do, to a less extent, the chatter of  the seven sisters, the calls of the mynas, the _towee_, _towee_,  _towee_ of the tailor-bird, the _whoot_, _whoot_, _whoot_ of the  crow-pheasant, the monotonous notes of the coppersmith and the green  barbet, the _uk_, _uk_, _uk_ of the hoopoe, the cheerful music of the  fantail flycatcher, the three sweet syllables of the iora--_so be ye_,  the _tee_, _tee_, _tee_, _tee_ of the nuthatch, the liquid whistle of  the oriole and, last but not least, the melody of the magpie-robin.  The calls of the hoopoe and nuthatch become less frequent as the month  draws to a close; on the other hand, the melody of the oriole gains in  strength.    As likely as not a pair of blue jays has elected to rear a brood of  young hopefuls in the chimney or in a hole in the roof. When this  happens the human occupant of the bungalow is apt to be driven nearly  to distraction by the cries of the young birds, which resemble those  of some creature in distress, and are uttered with \"damnable  reiteration.\"    All these sounds, however, reach in muffled form the ear of a human  being shut up in a bungalow; hence it is the voices of the night  rather than those of the day with which May in India is associated.  Most people sleep out of doors at this season, and, as the excessive  heat makes them restless, they have ample opportunity of listening to  the nightly concert of the feathered folk. The most notable performers  are the cuckoos. These birds are fully as nocturnal as the owls. The  brain-fever bird (_Hierococcyx varius_) is now in full voice, and may  be heard, both by day and by night, in all parts of Northern India,  east of Umballa. This creature has two calls. One is the eternal  \"brain-fever, _brain-fever_, BRAIN-FEVER,\" each \"brain-fever\" being  louder and pitched in a higher key than the previous one, until the  bird reaches its top note. The other call consists of a volley of  descending notes, uttered as if the bird were unwinding its voice  after the screams of \"brain-fever.\" The next cuckoo is not one whit  less vociferous than the last. It is known as the Indian koel  (_Eudynamis honorata_). This noble fowl has three calls, and it would  puzzle anyone to say which is the most powerful. The usual cry is a  crescendo _ku-il_, _ku-il_, _ku-il_, which to Indian ears is very  sweet-sounding. Most Europeans are agreed that it is a sound of which  one can have too much. The second note is a mighty avalanche of yells  and screams, which Cunningham has syllabised as _Kuk_, _kuu_, _kuu_,  _kuu_, _kuu_, _kuu_. The third cry, which is uttered only  occasionally, is a number of shrill shrieks: _Hekaree_, _karee_,  _karee_, _karee_.    The voice of the koel is heard throughout the hours of light and  darkness in May, so that one wonders whether this bird ever sleeps.  The second call is usually reserved for dawn, when the bird is most  vociferous. This cry is particularly exasperating to Europeans, since  it often awakens them rudely from the only refreshing sleep they have  enjoyed, namely, that obtained at the time when the temperature is  comparatively low. The koel extends into the Punjab and is heard  throughout Northern India.    The third of the cuckoos which enlivens the hot weather in the plains  is the Indian cuckoo (_Cuculus micropterus_). This species dwells  chiefly in the Himalayas, but late in April or early in May certain  individuals seek the hot plains and remain there for some months. They  do not extend very far into the peninsula, being numerous only in the  sub-Himalayan tracts as far south as Fyzabad. The call of this cuckoo  is melodious and easily recognised. Indians represent it as  _Bouto-taku_, while some Englishmen maintain that the bird says \"I've  lost my love.\" To the writer's mind the cry is best represented by the  words _wherefore_, _wherefore_, repeated with musical cadence. This  bird does not usually call much during the day. It uplifts its voice  about two hours before sunset and continues calling intermittently  until some time after sunrise. The note is often uttered while the  bird is on the wing.    Scarcely less vociferous than the cuckoos are the owls. Needless to  state that the tiny spotted owlets make a great noise in May. They are  loquacious throughout the year, especially on moonlight nights. Nor do  they wait for the setting of the sun until they commence to pour forth  what Eha terms a \"torrent of squeak and chatter and gibberish.\"    Almost as abundant as the spotted owlet is the jungle owlet  (_Glaucidium radiatum_). This species, like the last-mentioned, does  not confine its vocal efforts to the hot weather. It is vociferous  throughout the year; however, special mention must be made of it in  connection with the month of May, because it is not until a human  being sleeps out of doors that he takes much notice of the bird.    The note of this owl is very striking. It may be likened to the noise  made by a motor cycle when it is being started. It consists of a  series of dissyllables, low at first with a pause after each, but  gradually growing in intensity and succeeding one another at shorter  intervals, until the bird seems to have got fairly into its stride,  when it pulls up with dramatic suddenness. Tickell thus syllabises its  call: _Turtuck_, _turtuck_, _turtuck_, _turtuck_, _turtuck_, _tukatu_,  _chatatuck_, _atuckatuck_.    Another sound familiar to those who sleep out of doors at this season  is a low, soft \"what,\" repeated at intervals of about a minute.    The writer ascribes this call to the collared scops owl (_Scops  bakkamoena_). Mr. A. J. Currie, however, asserts that the note in  question is that emitted by spotted owlets (_Athene brama_) when they  have young. He states that he has been quite close to the bird when it  was calling.    A little patient observation will suffice to decide the point at  issue.    It is easy to distinguish between the two owls, as the scops has  aigrettes or \"horns,\" which the spotted owlet"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18253"],[0,"Discovery of Witches (#10)"],[1,"to witchcraft from being generally known  to their intimate friends and connexions. The witness by whose  evidence this legend was principally supported, was Jennet Device, a  child about nine years old, and grand-daughter of old Demdike. A more  dangerous tool in the hands of an unscrupulous evidence-compeller,  being at once intelligent, cunning and pliant, than the child proved  herself, it would not have been easy to have discovered. A foundation  being now laid capable of embracing any body of confederates, the  indefatigable justice proceeded in his inquiries, and in the end,  Elizabeth Device the daughter of old Demdike, James Device her son,  Alice Nutter, Katherine Hewitt, John Bulcock, Jane Bulcock, with some  others, were committed for trial at Lancaster. The very curious report  of that trial is contained in the work now republished, which was  compiled under the superintendence of the judges who presided, by  Master Thomas Potts, clerk in court, and present at the trial. His  report, notwithstanding its prolixity and its many repetitions, it has  been thought advisable to publish entire, and the reprint which  follows is as near a fac-simile as possible of the original tract.    [Footnote 35: Baines confounds Malking-Tower with Hoar-stones, a place  rendered famous by the second case of pretended witchcraft in 1633,  but at some distance from the first-named spot, the residence of  Mother Demdike, which lies in the township of Barrowford. The witch's  mansion--               \"Where that same wicked wight      Her dwelling had--      Dark, doleful, dreary, like a greedy grave      That still for carrion carcases doth crave,      On top whereof ay dwelt the ghastly owle,      Shrieking his baleful note, which ever drave      Far from that haunt all other cheerful fowl,      And all about it wandering ghosts did wail and howle\"--    is now, alas! no more. It stood in a field a little elevated, on a  brow above the building at present called Malking-Tower. The site of  the house or cottage is still distinctly traceable, and fragments of  the plaster are yet to be found imbedded in the boundary wall of the  field. The old road to Gisburne ran almost close to it. It commanded a  most extensive prospect in front, in the direction of Alkincoates,  Colne, and the Yorkshire moors; while in another direction the vast  range of Pendle, nearly intercepted, gloomed in sullen majesty. At the  period when Mother Demdike was in being, Malking-Tower would be at  some distance from any other habitation; its occupier, as the vulgar  would opine--        \"So choosing solitarie to abide      Far from all neighbours, that her devilish deedes      And hellish arts from people she might hide,      And hurt far off unknown whomever she envide.\"]    It is rather strange that Dr. Whitaker, to whom local superstitions  were always matters of the strongest interest, and welcome as manna to  the sojourners in the wilderness,[36] should have been ignorant, not  merely of Master Potts's discovery, but even of the fact of this trial  of the witches in 1612. It is equally singular that Sir Walter Scott  should have forgotten, when writing his letters on Demonology and  Witchcraft, that he had republished this tract, somewhat inaccurately,  but with rather a long introduction and notes, in the third volume of  his edition of the Somers Tracts, which appeared in 1810. He mentions  Potts's _Discoverie_, in the amusing but very inaccurate and imperfect  historical sketch referred to,[37] as a curious and rare book, which  he had then for the first time obtained a sight of. What could have  been his meaning in referring his readers, for an account of Mother  Demdike and a description of Malking Tower, to \"Mr. Roby's Antiquities  of Lancaster,\" that apocryphal historian having given no such account  or description, and having published no such work, it is rather  difficult to conjecture.    [Footnote 36: In a scarce little book, \"The Triumph of Sovereign  Grace, or a Brand plucked out of the Fire, by David Crosly, Minister,  Manchester,\" 1743, 12mo., which I owe to the kindness of the very able  historian of Cheshire, George Ormerod, Esq., Dr. Whitaker, to whom the  volume formerly belonged, has been at the pains of chronicling the  superstitions connected with a family, ranking amongst the more  opulent yeomen of Cliviger, of the name of Briercliffe, on the  execution of one of whom for murder the tract was published. The  Briercliffe's, from the curious anecdotes which the Doctor gives with  great unction, appear to have been one of those gloomy and fated  races, dogged by some unassuageable Nemesis, in which crime and horror  are transmitted from generation to generation with as much certainty  as the family features and name.]    [Footnote 37: We yet want a full, elaborate, and satisfactory history  of witchcraft. Hutchinson's is the only account we have which enters  at all at length into the detail of the various cases; but his  materials were generally collected from common sources, and he  confines himself principally to English cases. The European history of  witchcraft embraces so wide a field, and requires for its just  completion a research so various, that there is little probability, I  fear, of this _desideratum_ being speedily supplied.]    With all his habitual tautology and grave absurdity, Master Potts is,  nevertheless, a faithful and accurate chronicler, and we owe his  memory somewhat for furnishing us with so elaborate a report of what  took place on this trial, and giving us, \"in their own country terms,\"  the examinations of the witnesses, which contain much which throws  light on the manners and language of the times, and nearly all that is  necessary to enable us to form a judgment on the proceedings. It will  be observed that he follows with great exactness the course pursued in  court, in opening the case and recapitulating the evidence separately  against each prisoner, so as most graphically to place before us the  whole scene as it occurred. The part in which he is felt to be most  deficient, is in the want of some further account of the prisoners  convicted, from the trial up to the time of their execution. To Master  Potts, a man of legal forms and ceremonies, the entire interest in the  case seems to have come in and gone out with the judge's trumpets.    As most of the points in the trial which appeared to require  observation, have been adverted to in the notes which follow the  reprint, it is not considered necessary to enter into any analysis or  review of the evidence adduced at the trial, which presents such a  miserable mockery of justice. Mother Demdike, it will be seen, died in  prison before the trial came on. Of the Pendle witches four, namely  Old Chattox, Elizabeth Device, James Device, and Alizon Device, had  all made confessions, and had little chance, therefore, of escaping  condemnation. They were all found guilty; and with them were  convicted, Anne Redfern, Alice Nutter, Katherine Hewitt, John  Bulcock, and Jane Bulcock, who were all of Pendle or its  neighbourhood, and who maintained their innocence and refused to make  any confession. They were executed, along with the first-mentioned  four and Isabel Robey, who was of Windle, in the parish of Prescot,  and had been found guilty of similar practises, the day after the  trial, viz. on the 18th of August, 1612, \"at the common place of  execution near to Lancaster.\"    The main interest in reviewing this miserable band of victims will be  felt to centre in Alice Nutter.[38] Wealthy, well conducted, well  connected, and placed probably on an equality with most of the  neighbouring families and the magistrate before whom she was brought,  and by whom she was committed, she deserves to be distinguished from  the companions with whom she suffered, and to attract an attention  which has never yet been directed towards her.[39] That Jennet Device,  on whose evidence she was convicted, was instructed to accuse her by  her own nearest relatives, to whom \"superfluous lagged the veteran on  the stage,\" and that the magistrate, Roger Nowell, entered actively as  a confederate into the conspiracy from a grudge entertained against  her on account of a long disputed boundary, are allegations which  tradition has preserved, but the truth or falsehood of which, at this  distance of time, it is scarcely possible satisfactorily to examine.  With such a witness, however, as Jennet Device, and such an admirable  engine as the meeting at Malking-Tower, the guests at which she could  multiply _ad libitum_, doling out the _plaat_, as Titus Oates would  call it, by such instalments, and in such fragmentary portions, as  would conduce to an easy digestion of the whole, the wonder seems not  to be, that one unfortunate victim of a higher class should have  perished in the meshes of artful and complicated villainy, but that  its ramifications were not more extensive, and still more fatal and  destructive. From one so capable of taking a hint as the little  precocious prodigy of wickedness, in whose examination, Potts tells  us, \"_Mr. Nowell took such great paines_,\" a very summary deliverance  might be expected from troublesome neighbours, or still more  troublesome relatives; and if, by a leading question, she could only  be induced to marshal them in their allotted places at the witches'  imaginary banquet, there was little doubt of their taking their  station at a place of meeting where the sad realities of life were  only to be encountered, \"the common place of execution near to  Lancaster.\"    [Footnote 38: The explorer of Pendle will find the mansion of Alice  Nutter, Rough Lee, still standing. It is impossible to look at it,  recollecting the circumstances of her case, without being strongly  interested. It is a very substantial, and rather a fine specimen of  the houses of the inferior gentry in the time of James the first, and  is now divided"]]]
