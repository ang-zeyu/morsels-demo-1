Deys jes' lubly,  Miss Elsie; massa say so, lubly and delicious.\" And she brought the waiter  to her bedside, holding it out for her young mistress to help herself.    \"Yes, mammy dear, they look very tempting, but I won't eat with unwashed  hands and face,\" said Elsie gayly. \"And so papa has stolen a march upon me  and risen first?\"    \"Yes, darlin', massa out on the veranda, but he say 'Let your missus sleep  long as she will.'\"    \"My always kind and indulgent father! Mammy, I'll take a bath; and then  while you arrange my hair, I'll try the oranges. Go now and ask papa when  he will have his breakfast, and tell Aunt Phillis to see that it is ready  at the hour he names.\"    Chloe obeyed, and an hour later Elsie met her father in the breakfast-room  so glad, so gay, so bright, that his heart swelled with joy and pleasure  in his child, and all fears that she had overfatigued herself vanished  from his mind.    She was full of plans for the comfort and profit of her people, but all to  be subject to his approval \"Papa dear,\" she said as soon as their morning  greetings had been exchanged, \"I think of sending for a physician to  examine Suse and tell us whether there is reason for her complaints. She  must not be forced to work if she is really ill.\"    \"I think it would be well,\" he replied. \"There is an excellent physician  living about three miles from here.\"    Elsie was prompt in action by both nature and training, and instantly  summoning a servant, despatched him at once on the proposed errand.    \"And now what next?\" smilingly inquired her father.    \"Well, papa, after breakfast and prayers--how some of the old servants  seemed to enjoy them last night--I think of going down to the quarter to  see what may be needed there. Unless you have some other plan for me,\" she  added quickly.    \"Suppose we first mount our horses and ride over the estate, to learn for  ourselves whether Mr. Spriggs has been as faithful as he would have us  believe.\"    \"Ah yes, papa; yours is always the better plan.\"    Their ride in the clear, sweet morning air was most delightful, and both  felt gratified with the fine appearance of the crops and the discovery  that Spriggs' boast was no idle one; everything being in the nicest order.    They took the quarter on the way to the house, and dismounting, entered  one neatly whitewashed cabin after another, kindly inquiring into the  condition and wants of the inmates, Elsie making notes on her tablets that  nothing might be forgotten.    Everywhere the visit was received with joy and gratitude, and an almost  worshipful homage paid to the sweet young mistress whom they seemed to  regard as akin to the angels: probably in a great measure because of her  extraordinary likeness to her mother, of whom, for so many years they had  been accustomed to think and speak as one of the heavenly host.    Spriggs' victim of the previous day was in bed, complaining much of a  misery in back and head and limbs.    \"De doctah hab been heyah,\" she said, \"an' leff me dese powdahs to take,\"  drawing a tiny package from under her pillow.    Elsie spoke soothingly to her; said she should have some broth from the  house, and should be excused from work till the doctor pronounced her  quite fit for it again; and left her apparently quite happy.    It was the intention of our friends to spend some weeks at Viamede.    \"I want you to have every possible enjoyment while here, my darling,\" Mr.  Dinsmore said, as they sat together resting after their ride, in the wide  veranda at the front of the house, looking out over the beautiful lawn,  the bayou, and the lovely scenery beyond. \"There are pleasant neighbors  who will doubtless call when they hear of our arrival.\"    \"I almost wish they may not hear of it then,\" Elsie said half laughing; \"I  just want to be left free from the claims of society for this short time,  that I may fully enjoy being alone with my father and attending to the  comfort of my people. But excuse me, dear papa, I fear I interrupted you.\"    \"I excuse you on condition that you are not again guilty of such a breach  of good manners. I was going on to say there are delightful drives and  walks in the vicinity, of which I hope we will be able to make good use;  also, we will have a row now and then on the bayou, and many an hour of  quiet enjoyment of the contents of the library.\"    \"Yes, papa, I hope so; I do so enjoy a nice book, especially when read  with you. But I think that, for the present at least, I must spend a part  of each day in attending to the preparation of winter clothing for  house-servants and field hands.\"    \"I won't have you doing the actual work, the cutting out and sewing, I  mean,\" he answered decidedly; \"the head work, calculating how much  material is needed, what it will cost, etc., may be yours; but you have  servants enough to do all the rest.\"    \"But, papa, consider; over three hundred to clothe, and I want it all done  while I am here to oversee.\"    \"Have not some of the house-servants been trained as seamstresses?\"    \"Yes, sir, two of them, mammy tells me.\"    \"Very well; she knows how to run a sewing-machine. Send for one when you  order your material; both can be had in the nearest town. Aunt Chloe can  soon teach the girls how to manage it; Uncle Joe, too; he has had no  regular work assigned him yet, and the four can certainly do all without  anything more than a little oversight from you; yes, without even that.\"    \"What a capital planner you are, papa,\" she said brightly; \"I never  thought of getting a machine or setting Uncle Joe to running it; but I am  sure it's just the thing to do. Mammy can cut and the girls baste, and  among them the machine can easily be kept going from morning to night.  I'll make out my orders and send for the things at once.\"    \"That is right, daughter; it pleases me well to note how you put in  practice the lesson of promptness I have always tried to teach you. I will  help you in making your estimate of quantities needed, prices to be paid,  etc., and I think we can accomplish the whole before dinner. Come to the  library and let us to work.\"    \"You dear, kind father, always trying to help me and smooth the least  roughness out of my path, and make life as enjoyable to me as possible,\"  she said, laying her hand on his arm and looking up into his face with  eyes beaming with filial love, as they rose and stood together for a  moment.    \"A good daughter deserves a good father,\" he answered, smoothing with soft  caressing motion the shining hair. \"But have you the necessary data for  our estimates?\"    \"The number to be clothed, papa? I know how many house-servants, how many  babies and older children at the quarter, but not the number of field  hands.\"    \"That will be easily ascertained. I will send a note to Spriggs, who can  tell us all about it.\"    Mr. Dinsmore's plans were carried out to the letter, and with entire  success. This was Saturday; the orders were sent that afternoon, and on  Monday morning the work began. Aunt Chloe proved fully equal to the  cutting of the garments, and Uncle Joe an apt scholar under her patient,  loving teaching, and a willing worker at his new employment. There was  scarcely need of even oversight on the part of the young mistress. She  would drop in occasionally, commend their industry, and inquire if  anything were wanting; then felt free for books, rides or walks, music or  conversation with her father.    But she was often down at the quarter visiting the sick, the aged and  infirm, seeing that their wants were supplied, reading the Bible to them,  praying with them, telling of the better land where no trouble or sorrow  can come, and trying to make the way to it, through the shed blood of  Christ, very plain and clear. Then she would gather the children about her  and tell them of the blessed Jesus and His love for little ones.    \"Does He lub niggahs, missus?\" queried one grinning little wooly head.    \"Yes, if they love Him: and they won't be negroes in heaven.\"    \"White folks, missus? Oh, dat nice! Guess I go dar; ef dey let me in.\"    But we are anticipating somewhat, though Elsie found time for a short  visit to the sick and aged on the afternoon of even that first day at  Viamede. The next was the Sabbath, and as lovely a day as could be  desired. The horses were ordered for an early hour, and father and  daughter rode some miles together to morning service, then home again.    As the shadows began to lengthen in the afternoon, Elsie was sitting alone  on the veranda, her father having left her side but a moment before, when  an old negro, familiarly known as Uncle Ben, came round the corner of the  house, and slowly approached her.    Very sweet and fair, very beautiful she looked to his admiring eyes. She  held a Bible in her hand, and was so intent upon its perusal that she was  not aware of his coming until he had drawn quite near. Ascending the  steps, and standing at a respectful distance, hat in hand, he waited till  she should notice and address him.    Glancing up from her book, \"Ah, Uncle Ben, good evening,\" she said. \"What  can I do for you?\"    \"Missus,\" he answered, making a low salam, \"all de darkies is gadered  togedder under a tree 'round de house yondah, and dey 'pint me committee  to come an' ax de young missus would she be so kind for to come an' read  the Bible to dem, an' talk, an' pray, an' sing like she do for de sick  ones down to de quarter? Dey be berry glad, missus, an' more dan obliged.\"    \"Indeed I will, uncle,\" Elsie said, rising at once and going with him,  Bible in hand; \"I had been thinking of doing this very thing.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14875"],[0,"Elsie's children (#10)"],[1,"her poor sight, it was no longer possible.    \"How are your eyes affected?\" asked Elsie.    \"The sight is dim; I can scarcely see to set my stitches: I have great  difficulty in threading a needle: I always had. I could never read fine  print, never read through a long sentence without shutting my eyes for an  instant or looking off the book. It has always been an effort to see, and  now I am forced to use my eyes so constantly they grow worse and pain me  very much. At times a mist comes over them so that I cannot see at all  until I rest them a little. Indeed I often seem to be going blind and I'm  afraid I shall,\" she added, with a tremble in her tones, a tear rolling  down her cheek. But she hastily wiped it away.    \"My poor child, I hope not,\" Elsie said, laying a hand softly on hers;  \"there have been wonderful cures of diseased eyes. You must go to an  oculist.\"    \"The expense would be far beyond our means.\"    \"You must let me assume that. No, don't shake your head. I have abundant  means. The Lord has given me far more of this world's goods than I ought  to use for myself or my family and I know it is because he would have me  be his almoner.\"    The girl wept for joy and thankfulness.    \"Oh, how kind you are!\" she cried. \"I believe the Lord sent you and that  my sight will be spared; for I have prayed so that it might;--that he  would send me help somehow. But mother, how can she do without me?\"    \"I will see that she has medical advice, nursing, everything she needs.\"    Sally tried to speak her thanks but tears and sobs came instead.    The sound woke Mrs. Gibson. \"Elsie Dinsmore!\" she cried in feeble but  excited tones, with difficulty raising herself to a sitting posture. \"I  should have known you anywhere.\"    \"I cannot say the same; you are much changed,\" Elsie said, going to the  bedside and taking the thin feverish hand in hers.    \"Yes, I've grown an old woman, while you are fresh and young; and no  wonder, for your life has been all prosperity; mine nothing but trouble  and trial from beginning to end.\"    \"O, mother dear, we have had a great many mercies,\" said Sally; \"and your  life is not ended. I hope your good times are yet to come.\"    \"Well, maybe so, if Mrs. Travilla can help us to the medical aid we need,  and put us in the way of earning a good living afterward.\"    \"I shall do my best for you in both respects,\" Elsie said kindly,  accepting a chair Sally set for her near the bed.    \"I knew you would; you were always generous,\" remarked her ci-devant  governess; \"prompt too in bestowing your favors. But it is easy to be  generous with a large and well-filled purse.\"    \"Very true,\" Elsie answered with a smile. \"And now what can I do for you?  Ah I had forgotten. Mrs. Ross, hearing you were ill, and knowing that to  the sick something sent by a neighbor was often more relished than home  food, however nice, put a basket of dainties into the phaeton.\"    Stepping to the door, she signed to the servant, who immediately brought  in a hamper of provisions such as had not been seen under that roof for  many months. Mrs. Gibson's eyes glistened at sight of a basket of fine  fresh fruit and a bowl of delicious custard.    \"I will go now and call again to-morrow,\" Elsie said, as the man carried  away the empty hamper.    Grasping Sally's hand cordially in parting, she left something in it.    \"Mother!\" cried the girl, breathlessly, holding it up to view, \"it's a  check for a hundred dollars!\"    \"'Tisn't possible! let me see!\" cried Mrs. Gibson laying down the spoon  with which she was eating raspberries and custard, and holding out her  hand for the check.    \"Yes, so it is! what a godsend! I didn't think even she was so generous.  But dear me, she's rolling in wealth, and it's no more to her, or even as  much as ten cents would be to you or me.\"    \"Oh, mother!\" said Sally, reproachfully, \"we have no claim on her; and if  she has a good deal of money, she must have hundreds of calls for it.\"    \"No claim on her? why people take care of old servants, and a governess  ought to be considered of a good deal more account.\"    \"Tom mustn't know about this, mother.\"    \"No, indeed! the greater part of it would soon go for liquor or at the  gambling table, if he did. Here give it to me, and I'll hide it under my  pillow.\"    The saucer of berries was scarcely disposed of, before a second visitor  arrived.    Dr. Morton was considered the most skilful practitioner in the  neighborhood. Mrs. Travilla meeting him on the way in returning to the  Crags, had begged him to take charge of Mrs. Gibson's case, and also to  look at Sally's eyes; engaging to settle his bill herself.    On his way home he called at the Crags with his report. The mother, he  said, was very much out of health, but not incurable; he had promised to  send her some medicine. A month or two at the seashore would do her good;  perhaps restore her entirely.\"    \"Then she must go,\" said Elsie, \"I will at once see what arrangements can  be made. But now, what of the girl, doctor?\"    \"She seems in pretty good health.\"    \"But her eyes?\"    \"The nerve is affected; there is no help for her.\"    \"Are you quite sure?\"    \"Quite. I have paid a good deal of attention to the eye, and I assure you  a case like hers is incurable.\"    \"Then you decline to attempt to do anything for her?\"    \"I do, Mrs. Travilla, because there is absolutely nothing to be done.\"    \"Poor girl, how sorry I am for her! blindness must be so terrible,\" Lucy  remarked to her friend after the doctor had gone.    \"Yes,\" Elsie answered thoughtfully, \"but I do not give up hope for her  yet.\"    \"Dr. Morton is considered very skilful.\"    \"Still he may be mistaken, and I shall not rest till I have made every  effort to save her sight.\"    Little Elsie and her sister had already become deeply interested in poor  Sally, and were laying plans to help her.    \"What can we do, Elsie?\" queried Vi, in an under tone, drawing her sister  aside.    \"She'll want clothes; she had on a very old faded calico dress.\"    \"And not a bow or pin; just an old linen collar around her neck,\" remarked  Gertrude, joining them; \"and her dress was ever so old-fashioned and  patched besides.\"    \"Let's put our pocket money together, and buy her a new dress,\" proposed  Vi.    \"And make it for her,\" added Elsie; \"it hurts her eyes to sew, and you  know Dinah could fit it. Mamma had her taught the trade, and says she fits  and sews very nicely.\"    \"Oh, what's the use of giving our money?\" exclaimed Gertrude, impatiently.  \"We want it ourselves, and your mamma has such loads and loads of money;  hasn't she, Eddie?\" turning to him, as he stood near.    \"I don't know,\" he answered; \"she never told us she had; she never talks  much about money, except to tell us it all belongs to God, who only lends  it to us.\"    \"And that we must give it to the poor and needy,\" said Vi.    \"Because 'it is more blessed to give than to receive,'\" added Elsie.    \"Well, I know she has,\" persisted Gertrude, \"for my mamma often says so,  and I'm sure she knows.\"    \"But even if she has, mamma's money is not ours, and it's a duty and a  very great pleasure to give of our own.\"    \"Every one to their taste, I haven't a bit more money than I want myself,\"  said Gertrude, walking away with her chin in the air.    \"Gerty,\" said Elsie, running after her, \"don't be vexed; we weren't  meaning to ask you for anything; but only talking about our own duty.\"    \"Oh, I can take a hint as well as other folks,\" said Gertrude, tossing her  head.    \"What's it all about?\" asked Kate, coming up to them; but they paid no  heed to her, and she went to Vi for the desired information.    \"Why, I'll help, of course I will,\" she said; \"I guess I've got some  money, I'll look after tea; there's the bell now.\"    Elsie seized an opportunity to petition her mother for a longer talk than  usual in her dressing-room that evening, and the most of it was taken up  in the discussion and arranging of plans for helping Mrs. Gibson and her  daughter.    \"What an unconscionable time you've been upstairs, Elsie,\" Philip remarked  in a bantering tone, coming to her side as she and her mother returned to  the drawing-room. \"I've been dying to speak to you, as the girls say.\"    \"All girls don't talk so, Phil.\"    \"You don't, I know. Would you like a gallop before breakfast to-morrow  morning?\"    \"Yes, indeed!\" she answered, her eyes sparkling, \"it's what I'm used to at  home. Papa rides with us almost every morning.\"    \"Will I do for an escort?\"    \"Oh, yes, if mamma consents. Gert will go too, won't she?\"    \"No, she prefers her morning nap.\"    Philip was a manly boy, the neighborhood a safe one, and the pony Elsie  would ride, well-broken and not too spirited, so mamma's consent was  readily given, with the proviso that they should not go before sunrise, or  choose a lonely road.    \"By the way,\" she added, \"I should like you to do an errand for me at Mrs.  Gibson's.\"    As Sally Gibson was sweeping the doorstep early the next morning, a couple  of ponies dashed up to the gate, in whose riders she instantly recognized  Elsie Travilla and Philip Ross.    \"Hallo!\" shouted the latter, \"this young lady has something for you.\"    \"Good-morning,\" Elsie said, reaching out a little gloved hand, as the girl  drew near, \"mamma bade me bring you this note, and ask how your mother is  to-day.\"    \"A little better, thank you; it has done her a world of good to--to have  her mind so relieved, and the doctor's medicine seems to have helped her  too. How very, very kind Mrs. Travilla is,\" she added, with tears in her  eyes, \"and Mrs. Ross. Won't you come in?\"    \"Not this morning, thank you,\" and away they galloped. Sally looking after  them with admiring eyes, and a murmured exclamation, \"How pretty and sweet  she is!\"    It was not an envious sigh that accompanied the words, but born of mingled  emotions,--the half-formed thought, \"Shall I ever know such"]]]
