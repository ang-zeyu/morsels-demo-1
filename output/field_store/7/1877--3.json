Heaps of garbage and ashes lie in all  directions, and the foul liquids emptied before the doors gather in  stinking pools.  Here live the poorest of the poor, the worst paid  workers with thieves and the victims of prostitution indiscriminately  huddled together, the majority Irish, or of Irish extraction, and those  who have not yet sunk in the whirlpool of moral ruin which surrounds  them, sinking daily deeper, losing daily more and more of their power to  resist the demoralising influence of want, filth, and evil surroundings.    Nor is St. Giles the only London slum.  In the immense tangle of streets,  there are hundreds and thousands of alleys and courts lined with houses  too bad for anyone to live in, who can still spend anything whatsoever  upon a dwelling fit for human beings.  Close to the splendid houses of  the rich such a lurking-place of the bitterest poverty may often be  found.  So, a short time ago, on the occasion of a coroner's inquest, a  region close to Portman Square, one of the very respectable squares, was  characterised as an abode \"of a multitude of Irish demoralised by poverty  and filth.\"  So, too, may be found in streets, such as Long Acre and  others, which, though not fashionable, are yet \"respectable,\" a great  number of cellar dwellings out of which puny children and half-starved,  ragged women emerge into the light of day.  In the immediate  neighbourhood of Drury Lane Theatre, the second in London, are some of  the worst streets of the whole metropolis, Charles, King, and Park  Streets, in which the houses are inhabited from cellar to garret  exclusively by poor families.  In the parishes of St. John and St.  Margaret there lived in 1840, according to the _Journal of the  Statistical Society_, 5,366 working-men's families in 5,294 \"dwellings\"  (if they deserve the name!), men, women, and children thrown together  without distinction of age or sex, 26,830 persons all told; and of these  families three-fourths possessed but one room.  In the aristocratic  parish of St. George, Hanover Square, there lived, according to the same  authority, 1,465 working-men's families, nearly 6,000 persons, under  similar conditions, and here, too, more than two-thirds of the whole  number crowded together at the rate of one family in one room.  And how  the poverty of these unfortunates, among whom even thieves find nothing  to steal, is exploited by the property-holding class in lawful ways!  The  abominable dwellings in Drury Lane, just mentioned, bring in the  following rents: two cellar dwellings, 3s.; one room, ground-floor, 4s.;  second-storey, 4s. 6d.; third-floor, 4s.; garret-room, 3s. weekly, so  that the starving occupants of Charles Street alone, pay the house-owners  a yearly tribute of 2,000 pounds, and the 5,336 families above mentioned  in Westminster, a yearly rent of 40,000 pounds.    The most extensive working-people's district lies east of the Tower in  Whitechapel and Bethnal Green, where the greatest masses of London  working-people live.  Let us hear Mr. G. Alston, preacher of St.  Philip's, Bethnal Green, on the condition of his parish.  He says:       \"It contains 1,400 houses, inhabited by 2,795 families, or about     12,000 persons.  The space upon which this large population dwells, is     less than 400 yards (1,200 feet) square, and in this overcrowding it     is nothing unusual to find a man, his wife, four or five children,     and, sometimes, both grandparents, all in one single room, where they     eat, sleep, and work.  I believe that before the Bishop of London     called attention to this most poverty-stricken parish, people at the     West End knew as little of it as of the savages of Australia or the     South Sea Isles.  And if we make ourselves acquainted with these     unfortunates, through personal observation, if we watch them at their     scanty meal and see them bowed by illness and want of work, we shall     find such a mass of helplessness and misery, that a nation like ours     must blush that these things can be possible.  I was rector near     Huddersfield during the three years in which the mills were at their     worst, but I have never seen such complete helplessness of the poor as     since then in Bethnal Green.  Not one father of a family in ten in the     whole neighbourhood has other clothing than his working suit, and that     is as bad and tattered as possible; many, indeed, have no other     covering for the night than these rags, and no bed, save a sack of     straw and shavings.\"    The foregoing description furnishes an idea of the aspect of the interior  of the dwellings.  But let us follow the English officials, who  occasionally stray thither, into one or two of these working-men's homes.    On the occasion of an inquest held Nov. 14th, 1843, by Mr. Carter,  coroner for Surrey, upon the body of Ann Galway, aged 45 years, the  newspapers related the following particulars concerning the deceased: She  had lived at No. 3 White Lion Court, Bermondsey Street, London, with her  husband and a nineteen-year-old son in a little room, in which neither a  bedstead nor any other furniture was to be seen.  She lay dead beside her  son upon a heap of feathers which were scattered over her almost naked  body, there being neither sheet nor coverlet.  The feathers stuck so fast  over the whole body that the physician could not examine the corpse until  it was cleansed, and then found it starved and scarred from the bites of  vermin.  Part of the floor of the room was torn up, and the hole used by  the family as a privy.    On Monday, Jan. 15th, 1844, two boys were brought before the police  magistrate because, being in a starving condition, they had stolen and  immediately devoured a half-cooked calf's foot from a shop.  The  magistrate felt called upon to investigate the case further, and received  the following details from the policeman: The mother of the two boys was  the widow of an ex-soldier, afterwards policeman, and had had a very hard  time since the death of her husband, to provide for her nine children.  She lived at No. 2 Pool's Place, Quaker Court, Spitalfields, in the  utmost poverty.  When the policeman came to her, he found her with six of  her children literally huddled together in a little back room, with no  furniture but two old rush-bottomed chairs with the seats gone, a small  table with two legs broken, a broken cup, and a small dish.  On the  hearth was scarcely a spark of fire, and in one corner lay as many old  rags as would fill a woman's apron, which served the whole family as a  bed.  For bed clothing they had only their scanty day clothing.  The poor  woman told him that she had been forced to sell her bedstead the year  before to buy food.  Her bedding she had pawned with the victualler for  food.  In short, everything had gone for food.  The magistrate ordered  the woman a considerable provision from the poor-box.    In February, 1844, Theresa Bishop, a widow 60 years old, was recommended,  with her sick daughter, aged 26, to the compassion of the police  magistrate in Marlborough Street.  She lived at No. 5 Brown Street,  Grosvenor Square, in a small back room no larger than a closet, in which  there was not one single piece of furniture.  In one corner lay some rags  upon which both slept; a chest served as table and chair.  The mother  earned a little by charring.  The owner of the house said that they had  lived in this way since May, 1843, had gradually sold or pawned  everything that they had, and had still never paid any rent.  The  magistrate assigned them 1 pound from the poor-box.    I am far from asserting that _all_ London working-people live in such  want as the foregoing three families.  I know very well that ten are  somewhat better off, where one is so totally trodden under foot by  society; but I assert that thousands of industrious and worthy people--far  worthier and more to be respected than all the rich of London--do find  themselves in a condition unworthy of human beings; and that every  proletarian, everyone, without exception, is exposed to a similar fate  without any fault of his own and in spite of every possible effort.    But in spite of all this, they who have some kind of a shelter are  fortunate, fortunate in comparison with the utterly homeless.  In London  fifty thousand human beings get up every morning, not knowing where they  are to lay their heads at night.  The luckiest of this multitude, those  who succeed in keeping a penny or two until evening, enter a  lodging-house, such as abound in every great city, where they find a bed.  But what a bed!  These houses are filled with beds from cellar to garret,  four, five, six beds in a room; as many as can be crowded in.  Into every  bed four, five, or six human beings are piled, as many as can be packed  in, sick and well, young and old, drunk and sober, men and women, just as  they come, indiscriminately.  Then come strife, blows, wounds, or, if  these bedfellows agree, so much the worse; thefts are arranged and things  done which our language, grown more humane than our deeds, refuses to  record.  And those who cannot pay for such a refuge?  They sleep where  they find a place, in passages, arcades, in corners where the police and  the owners leave them undisturbed.  A few individuals find their way to  the refuges which are managed, here and there, by private charity, others  sleep on the benches in the parks close under the windows of Queen  Victoria.  Let us hear the London _Times_:       \"It appears from the report of the proceedings at Marlborough Street     Police Court in our columns of yesterday, that there is an average     number of 50 human beings of all ages, who huddle together in the     parks every night, having no other shelter than what is supplied by     the trees and a few hollows of the embankment.

Dispel the mists through the power of thy  Lord, and ascend unto the Kingdom of His names and attributes. Thus hath  the Pen of the Most High commanded thee at the behest of thy Lord, the  Almighty, the All-Compelling. He, verily, hath again come down from Heaven  even as He came down from it the first time. Beware that thou dispute not  with Him even as the Pharisees disputed with Him without a clear token or  proof. On His right hand flow the living waters of grace, and on His left  the choice Wine of justice, whilst before Him march the angels of  Paradise, bearing the banners of His signs. Beware lest any name debar  thee from God, the Creator of earth and heaven. Leave thou the world  behind thee, and turn towards thy Lord, through Whom the whole earth hath  been illumined.    103 We have adorned the Kingdom with the ornament of Our name, the  All-Glorious. Thus hath it been decreed by God, the Fashioner of all  things. Take heed lest thy vain imaginings withhold thee, when once the  Sun of Certitude hath shone forth above the horizon of the Utterance of  thy Lord, the Mighty, the Beneficent. Dwellest thou in palaces whilst He  Who is the King of Revelation liveth in the most desolate of abodes? Leave  them unto such as desire them, and set thy face with joy and delight  towards the Kingdom.    104 Say: O peoples of the earth! Destroy the abodes of negligence with the  hands of power and assurance, and raise up the mansions of true knowledge  within your hearts, that the All-Merciful may shed the radiance of His  light upon them. Better is this for you than all whereon the sun shineth,  and unto this beareth witness He Who holdeth within His grasp the ultimate  decree. The Breeze of God hath been wafted over the world at the advent of  the Desired One in His great glory, whereupon every stone and clod of  earth hath cried out: \"The Promised One is come! The Kingdom is God's, the  Mighty, the Gracious, the Forgiving.\"    105 Beware lest human learning debar thee from Him Who is the Supreme  Object of all knowledge, or lest the world deter thee from the One Who  created it and set it upon its course. Arise in the name of thy Lord, the  God of Mercy, amidst the peoples of the earth, and seize thou the Cup of  Life with the hands of confidence. First drink thou therefrom, and proffer  it then to such as turn towards it amongst the peoples of all faiths. Thus  hath the Moon of Utterance risen above the horizon of wisdom and  understanding.    106 Tear asunder the veils of human learning lest they hinder thee from  Him Who is My name, the Self-Subsisting. Call thou to remembrance Him Who  was the Spirit, Who, when He came, the most learned of His age pronounced  judgement against Him in His own country, whilst he who was only a  fisherman believed in Him. Take heed, then, ye men of understanding heart!  Thou, in truth, art one of the suns of the heaven of His names. Guard  thyself, lest darkness spread its veils over thee, and fold thee away from  His light. Ponder, then, that which hath been sent down in the Book by thy  Lord, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful.    107 Say: Still your pens, O concourse of divines, for lo, the shrill voice  of the Pen of Glory hath been lifted up between earth and heaven. Cast  away all that ye possess and take fast hold of that which We have revealed  unto you with power and authority. The Hour that was concealed within the  knowledge of God hath struck, whereupon all the atoms of the earth have  proclaimed: \"The Ancient of Days is come in His great glory! Hasten unto  Him, O peoples of the earth, with humble and contrite hearts.\" Say: We, in  truth, have given Ourself as a ransom for your own lives. Alas, when We  came once again, We beheld you fleeing from Us, whereat the eye of My  loving-kindness wept sore over My people. Fear God, O ye that perceive.    108 Consider those who opposed the Son, when He came unto them with  sovereignty and power. How many the Pharisees who were waiting to behold  Him, and were lamenting over their separation from Him! And yet, when the  fragrance of His coming was wafted over them, and His beauty was unveiled,  they turned aside from Him and disputed with Him. Thus do We impart unto  thee that which hath been recorded in the Books and Scriptures. None save  a very few, who were destitute of any power amongst men, turned towards  His face. And yet today every man endowed with power and invested with  sovereignty prideth himself on His Name! In like manner, consider how  numerous, in these days, are the monks who, in My Name, have secluded  themselves in their churches, and who, when the appointed time was  fulfilled, and We unveiled Our beauty, knew Us not, though they call upon  Me at eventide and at dawn. We behold them clinging to My name, yet veiled  from My Self. This, verily, is a strange thing.    109 Say: Take heed lest your devotions withhold you from Him Who is the  object of all devotion, or your worship debar you from Him Who is the  object of all worship. Rend asunder the veils of your idle fancies! This  is your Lord, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, Who hath come to quicken the  world and unite all who dwell on earth. Turn unto the Dayspring of  Revelation, O people, and tarry not, be it for less than the twinkling of  an eye. Read ye the Evangel and yet refuse to acknowledge the All-Glorious  Lord? This indeed beseemeth you not, O concourse of learned men!    110 Say: If ye deny this Revelation, by what proof have ye believed in  God? Produce it then. Thus hath the summons of God been sent down by the  Pen of the Most High at the bidding of your Lord, the Most Glorious, in  this Tablet from whose horizon the splendour of His Light hath shone  forth. How many are My servants whose deeds have become veils between them  and their own selves, and who have been kept back thereby from drawing  nigh unto God, He Who causeth the winds to blow.    111 O concourse of monks! The fragrances of the All-Merciful have wafted  over all creation. Happy the man that hath forsaken his desires, and taken  fast hold of guidance. He, indeed, is of those who have attained unto the  presence of God in this Day, a Day whereon commotions have seized the  dwellers of the earth and filled with dismay all save those who have been  exempted by God, He Who layeth low the necks of men.    112 Adorn ye your bodies whilst the raiment of God is stained with the  blood of hatred at the hands of the people of denial? Issue forth from  your habitations and bid the people enter the Kingdom of God, the Lord of  the Day of Judgement. The Word which the Son concealed is made manifest.  It hath been sent down in the form of the human temple in this day.  Blessed be the Lord Who is the Father! He, verily, is come unto the  nations in His most great majesty. Turn your faces towards Him, O  concourse of the righteous!    113 O followers of all religions! We behold you wandering distraught in  the wilderness of error. Ye are the fish of this Ocean; wherefore do ye  withhold yourselves from that which sustaineth you? Lo, it surgeth before  your faces. Hasten unto it from every clime. This is the day whereon the  Rock(12) crieth out and shouteth, and celebrateth the praise of its Lord,  the All-Possessing, the Most High, saying: \"Lo! The Father is come, and  that which ye were promised in the Kingdom is fulfilled!\" This is the Word  which was preserved behind the veils of grandeur, and which, when the  Promise came to pass, shed its radiance from the horizon of the Divine  Will with clear tokens.    114 My body hath borne imprisonment that your souls may be released from  bondage, and We have consented to be abased that ye may be exalted. Follow  the Lord of glory and dominion, and not every ungodly oppressor. My body  longeth for the cross, and Mine head awaiteth the thrust of the spear, in  the path of the All-Merciful, that the world may be purged from its  transgressions. Thus hath the Daystar of divine authority shone forth from  the horizon of the Revelation of Him Who is the Possessor of all names and  attributes.    115 The people of the Qur'an have risen against Us, and tormented Us with  such a torment that the Holy Spirit lamented, and the thunder roared out,  and the clouds wept over Us. Among the faithless is he who hath imagined  that calamities can deter Baha from fulfilling that which God, the Creator  of all things, hath purposed. Say: Nay, by Him Who causeth the rain to  fall! Nothing whatsoever can withhold Him from the remembrance of His  Lord.    116 By the righteousness of God! Should they cast Him into a fire kindled  on the continent, He will assuredly rear His head in the midmost heart of  the ocean and proclaim: \"He is the Lord of all that are in heaven and all  that are on earth!\" And if they cast Him into a darksome pit, they will  find Him seated on earth's loftiest heights calling aloud to all mankind:  \"Lo, the Desire of the World is come in His majesty, His sovereignty, His  transcendent dominion!\" And if He be buried beneath the depths of the  earth, His Spirit soaring to the apex of heaven shall peal the summons:  \"Behold ye the coming of the Glory; witness ye the Kingdom of God, the  Most Holy, the Gracious, the All-Powerful!\" And if they shed His blood,  every drop thereof shall cry out and invoke God in this Name through which  the fragrance of His raiment hath been diffused in all directions.    117 Though threatened by the swords of Our enemies, We summon all mankind  unto God, the Fashioner of earth and heaven, and We render Him such aid as  can be hindered by neither the hosts of tyranny nor the ascendancy of the  people of iniquity. Say: O peoples of the earth! Scatter the idols of your  vain imaginings in the name of your Lord, the All-Glorious, the  All-Knowing, and turn ye unto Him in this Day which God hath made the King  of days.    118 O Supreme Pontiff!
