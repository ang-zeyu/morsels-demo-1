Shortly after the sinking of the _Lusitania_ the naval propaganda  bureau had bronze medals cast and placed on sale at souvenir shops  throughout Germany.  Ambassador Gerard received one day, in exchanging  some money, a fifty mark bill, with the words stamped in purple ink  across the face:    \"God punish England and America.\"  For some weeks this rubber stamp was  used very effectively.    The Navy Department realised, too, that another way to attack America  and especially Americans in Berlin, was to arouse the suspicion that  every one who spoke English was an enemy.  The result was that most  Americans had to be exceedingly careful not to talk aloud in public  places.  The American correspondents were even warned at the General  Staff not to speak English at the front.  Some of the correspondents  who did not speak German were not taken to the battle areas because the  Foreign Office desired to avoid insults.    The year and a half between the sinking of the _Lusitania_ and the  severance of diplomatic relations was a period of terror for most  Americans in Germany.  Only those who were so sympathetic with Germany  that they were anti-American found it pleasant to live there.  One day  one of the American girls employed in the confidential file room of the  American Embassy was slapped in the face until she cried, by a German  in civilian clothes, because she was speaking English in the subway.  At another time the wife of a prominent American business man was spit  upon and chased out of a public bus because she was speaking English.  Then a group of women chased her down the street.  Another American  woman was stabbed by a soldier when she was walking on Friedrichstrasse  with a friend because she was speaking English.  When the State  Department instructed Ambassador Gerard to bring the matter to the  attention of the Foreign Office and to demand an apology Wilhelmstrasse  referred the matter to the General Staff for investigation.  The  soldier was arrested and secretly examined.  After many weeks had  elapsed the Foreign Office explained that the man who had stabbed the  woman was really not a soldier but a red cross worker.  It was  explained that he had been wounded and was not responsible for what he  did.  The testimony of the woman, however, and of other witnesses,  showed that the man at the time he attacked the American was dressed in  a soldier's uniform, which is grey, and which could not he mistaken for  the black uniform of a red cross worker.    It was often said in Berlin, \"Germany hates England, fights France,  fears Russia but loathes America.\"  No one, not even American  officials, questioned it.    The hate campaign was bearing fruit.    In January, 1916, there appeared in Berlin a publication called _Light  and Truth_.  It was a twelve-page circular in English and German  attacking President Wilson and the United States.  Copies were sent by  mail to all Americans and to hundreds of thousands of Germans.  It was  edited and distributed by \"The League of Truth.\"  It was the most  sensational document printed in Germany since the beginning of the war  against a power with which Germany was supposed to be at peace.  Page 6  contained two illustrations under the legend:        WILSON AND HIS PRESS IS NOT AMERICA      Underneath was this paragraph:      \"An American Demonstration--On the 27th of January, the birthday of the  German Emperor, an immense laurel wreath decorated with the German and  American flags was placed by Americans at the foot of the monument to  Frederick the Great (in Berlin).  The American flag was enshrouded in  black crape.  Frederick the Great was the first to recognise the  independence of the young Republic, after it had won its freedom from  the yoke of England, at the price of its very heart's blood through  years of struggle.  His successor, Wilhelm II, receives the gratitude  of America in the form of hypocritical phrases and war supplies to his  mortal enemy.\"    [Illustration: First page of the magazine \"Light and Truth\"]    One photograph was of the wreath itself.  The other showed a group of  thirty-six people, mostly boys, standing in front of the statue after  the wreath had been placed.    When Ambassador Gerard learned about the \"demonstration\" he went to the  statue and from there immediately to the Foreign Office, where he saw  Secretary of State von Jagow.  Gerard demanded instantaneous removal of  the wreath.  Von Jagow promised an \"investigation.\"  Gerard meanwhile  began a personal investigation of the _League of Truth_, which had  purchased and placed the insult there.    Days, weeks, even months passed.  Von Jagow still refused to have the  wreath removed.  Finally Gerard went to the Foreign Office and told von  Jagow that unless it was taken away that day he would get it himself  and send it by courier to Washington.  That evening Gerard walked to  the statue.  The wreath had disappeared.    Week by week the league continued its propaganda.  Gerard continued his  investigation.    July 4, 1916, another circular was scattered broadcast.  On page 1 was  a large black cross.  Pages 2 and 3, the inside, contained a reprint of  the \"Declaration of Independence,\" with the imprint across the face of  a bloody hand.  Enclosed in a heavy black border on page 4 were nine  verses by John L. Stoddard, the lecturer, entitled \"Blood-Traffickers.\"  (Printed in the beginning of this chapter.)    The league made an especial appeal to the \"German-Americans.\"  Germany,  as was pointed out in a previous article, counts upon some  German-Americans as her allies.  One day Ambassador Gerard received a  circular entitled \"An Appeal to All Friends of Truth.\"  The same was  sent in German and English to a mailing list of many hundred thousands.  Excerpts from this read:      \"If any one is called upon to raise his voice in foreign lands for the  cause of truth, it is the foreigner who was able to witness the  unanimous rising of the German people at the outbreak of war, and their  attitude during its continuance.  _This applies especially to the  German-American_.    \"_As a citizen of two continents, in proportion as his character has  remained true to German principles, he finds both here and there the  right word to say. . . ._    \"Numberless millions of men are forced to look upon a loathsome  spectacle.  _It is that of certain individuals in America; to whom a  great nation has temporarily intrusted its weal and woe_, supporting a  few multi-millionaires and their dependents, setting at  naught--unpunished--the revered document of the Fourth of July, 1776,  and daring to _barter away the birthright of the white race_. . . .  We  want to see whether the united voices of Germans and foreigners have  not more weight than the hired writers of editorials in the newspapers;  and whether the words of men who are independent will not render it  impossible for a subsidised press to continue its destructive work.\"    Gerard's investigation showed that a group of German-Americans in  Berlin were financing the _League of Truth_; that a man named William  F. Marten, who posed as an American, was the head, and that the editors  and writers of the publication _Light and Truth_ were being assisted by  the Foreign Office Press Bureau and protected by the General Staff.  An  American dentist in Berlin, Dr. Charles Mueller, was chairman of the  league.  Mrs. Annie Neumann-Hofer, the American-born wife of  Neumann-Hofer, of the Reichstag, was secretary.  Gerard reported other  names to the State Department, and asked authority to take away the  passports of Americans who were assisting the German government in this  propaganda.    The \"league\" heard about the Ambassador's efforts, and announced that a  \"Big Bertha\" issue would be published exposing Gerard.  For several  months the propagandists worked to collect data.  One day Gerard  decided to go to the league's offices and look at the people who were  directing it.  In the course of his remarks the Ambassador said that if  the Foreign Office didn't do something to suppress the league  immediately, he would burn down the place.  The next day Marten and his  co-workers went to the Royal Administration of the Superior Court,  No. 1, in Berlin, and through his attorney lodged a criminal charge of  \"threat of arson\" against the Ambassador.    The next day Germany was flooded with letters from \"The League of  Truth,\" saying:      \"The undersigned committee of the League of Truth to their deepest  regret felt compelled to inform the members that Ambassador Gerard had  become involved in a criminal charge involving threat of arson. . . .  All American citizens are now asked whether an Ambassador who acts so  undignified at the moment of a formal threat of a wholly unnecessary  war, is to be considered worthy further to represent a country like the  United States.\"      Were it not for the fact that at this time President Wilson was trying  to impress upon Germany the seriousness of her continued disregard of  American and neutral lives on the high seas, the whole thing would have  been too absurd to notice.  But Germany wanted to create the impression  among her people that President Wilson was not speaking for America,  and that the Ambassador was too insignificant to notice.    After this incident Gerard called upon von Jagow again and demanded the  immediate suppression of the third number of _Light and Truth_.  Before  von Jagow consented Mrs. Neumann-Hofer turned upon her former  propagandists and confessed.  I believe her confession is in the State  Department, but this is what she told me:      \"Marten is a German and has never been called to the army because the  General Staff has delegated him to direct this anti-American  propaganda.  [We were talking at the Embassy the day before the  Ambassador left.]  Marten is supported by some very high officials.  He  has"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15777"],[0,"A Voyage Towards the South Pole and Round the World, Volume 1 (#10)"],[1,"hopes  of finding a passage to the south. But we found every where the ice closed.  We had a gentle gale at N.W. with showers of snow. At noon we were, by  observation, in the latitude of 55 deg. 16' S. In the evening the weather was  clear and serene. In the course of this day we saw many whales, one seal,  penguins, some of the white birds, another sort of peterel, which is brown  and white, and not much unlike a pintado; and some other sorts already  known. We found the skirts of the loose ice to be more broken than usual;  and it extended some distance beyond the main field, insomuch that we  sailed amongst it the most part of the day; and the high ice islands  without us were innumerable. At eight o'clock we sounded, but found no  ground with 250 fathoms of line. After this we hauled close upon a wind to  the northward, as we could see the field of ice extend as far as N.E. But  this happened not to be the northern point; for at eleven o'clock we were  obliged to tack to avoid it.    At two o'clock the next morning we stood again to the northward, with the  wind at N.W. by W., thinking to weather the ice upon this tack; on which we  stood but two hours, before we found ourselves quite imbayed, being then in  latitude 55 deg. 8', longitude 24 deg. 3'. The wind veering more to the north, we  tacked and stood to the westward under all the sail we could carry, having  a fresh breeze and clear weather, which last was of short duration. For at  six o'clock it became hazy, and soon after there was thick fog; the wind  veered to the N.E., freshened and brought with it snow and sleet, which  froze on the rigging as it fell. We were now enabled to get clear of the  field of ice: but at the same time we were carried in amongst the ice  islands, in a manner equally dangerous, and which with much difficulty we  kept clear of.    Dangerous as it is to sail among these floating rocks (if I may be allowed  to call them so) in a thick fog, this, however, is preferable to being  entangled with immense fields of ice under the same circumstances. The  great danger to be apprehended in this latter case, is the getting fast in  the ice; a situation which would be exceedingly alarming. I had two men on  board that had been in the Greenland trade; the one of them in a ship that  lay nine weeks, and the other in one that lay six weeks, fast in this kind  of ice, which they called packed ice. What they called field ice is  thicker; and the whole field, be it ever so large, consists of one piece.  Whereas this which I call field-ice, from its immense extent, consists of  many pieces of various sizes, both in thickness and surface, from thirty or  forty feet square to three or four, packed close together, and in places  heaped one upon another. This, I am of opinion, would be found too hard for  a ship's side, that is not properly armed against it. How long it may have  lain, or will lie here, is a point not easily determined. Such ice is found  in the Greenland seas all the summer long; and I think it cannot be colder  there in the summer, than it is here. Be this as it may, we certainly had  no thaw; on the contrary, the mercury in Fahrenheit's thermometer kept  generally below the freezing point, although it was the middle of summer.    It is a general opinion, that the ice I have been speaking of, is formed in  bays and rivers. Under this supposition we were led to believe that land  was not far distant; and that it even lay to the southward behind the ice,  which alone hindered us from approaching to it. Therefore, as we had now  sailed above thirty leagues along the edge of the ice, without finding a  passage to the south, I determined to run thirty or forty leagues to the  east, afterwards endeavour to get to the southward, and, if I met with no  land, or other impediment, to get behind the ice, and put the matter out of  all manner of dispute. With this view, we kept standing to the N.W., with  the wind at N.E. and N., thick foggy weather, with sleet and snow, till six  in the evening, when the wind veered to N.W., and we tacked and stood to  the eastward, meeting with many islands of ice of different magnitudes, and  some loose pieces: The thermometer from 30 to 34; weather very hazy, with  sleet and snow, and more sensibly colder than the thermometer seemed to  point out, insomuch that the whole crew complained. In order to enable them  to support this weather the better, I caused the sleeves of their jackets  (which were so short as to expose their arms) to be lengthened with baize;  and had a cap made for each man of the same stuff, together with canvas;  which proved of great service to them.    Some of our people appearing to have symptoms of the scurvy, the surgeons  began to give them fresh wort every day, made from the malt we had on board  for that purpose. One man in particular was highly scorbutic; and yet he  had been taking the rob of lemon and orange for some time, without being  benefited thereby. On the other hand, Captain Furneaux told me, that he had  two men, who, though far gone in this disease, were now in a manner  entirely cured by it.    We continued standing to the eastward till eight o'clock in the morning of  the 21st; when, being in the latitude of 53 deg. 50', and longitude 29 deg. 24' E.,  we hauled to the south, with the wind at west, a fresh gale and hazy, with  snow. In the evening the wind fell and the weather cleared up, so as that  we could see a few leagues round us; being in the latitude of 54 deg. 43' S.  longitude 29 deg. 30' E.    At ten o'clock, seeing many islands of ice a-head, and the weather coming  on foggy, with snow, we wore and stood to the northward, till three in the  morning, when we stood again to the south. At eight, the weather cleared  up, and the wind came to W.S.W., with which we made all the sail we could  to the south; having never less than ten or twelve islands of ice in sight.    Next day we had the wind at S.W. and S.S.W., a gentle gale, with now and  then showers of snow and hail. In the morning, being in the latitude of 55 deg.  20' S., and longitude 31 deg. 30' E., we hoisted out a boat to see if there was  any current, but found none. Mr Forster, who went in the boat, shot some of  the small grey birds before-mentioned, which were of the peterel tribe, and  about the size of a small pigeon. Their back, and upper side of their  wings, their feet and bills, are of a blue-grey colour. Their bellies, and  under side of their wings are white, a little tinged with blue. The upper  side of their quill feathers is a dark-blue tinged with black. A streak is  formed by feathers nearly of this colour, along the upper parts of the  wings, and crossing the back a little above the tail. The end of the tail  feathers is also of the same colour. Their bills are much broader than any  I have seen of the same tribe; and their tongues are remarkably broad.  These blue peterels, as I shall call them, are seen no where but in the  southern hemisphere, from about the latitude of 28 deg., and upwards.  Thermometer at 33 deg. in the open air, and 32 deg. in the sea at the surface, and  at 34-1/2 when drawn, and 6-1/2 minutes in drawing up from 100 fathoms  below it, where it had been sixteen minutes.    On the 24th, the wind blew from N.W. to N.E., a gentle gale, fair and  cloudy. At noon we were by observation, in the latitude of 56 deg. 31' S, and  longitude 31 deg. 19' E., the thermometer at 35. And being near an island of  ice, which was about fifty feet high, and 400 fathoms in circuit, I sent  the master in the jolly-boat to see if any water run from it. He soon  returned with an account that there was not one drop, or any other  appearance of thaw. In the evening we sailed through several floats, or  fields of loose ice, lying in the direction of S.E. and N.W.; at the same  time we had continually several islands of the same composition in sight.    On the 25th, the wind veering round from the N.E., by the east to south, it  blew a gentle gale; with which we stood to the W.S.W, and at noon were in  the latitude of 57 deg. 50' S., and longitude 29 deg. 32' E. The weather was fair  and cloudy; the air sharp and cold, attended with a hard frost. And,  although this was the middle of summer with us, I much question if the day  was colder in any part of England. The wind continued at south, blew a  fresh gale, fair and cloudy weather, till near noon the next day, when we  had clear sun-shine, and found ourselves, by observation, in the latitude  of 58 deg. 31' S., longitude 26 deg. 57' E.    In the course of the last twenty-four hours we passed through several  fields of broken loose ice. They were in general narrow, but of a  considerable length, in the direction of N.W. and S.E. The ice was so close  in one, that it would hardly admit the ship through it. The pieces were  flat, from four to six or eight inches thick, and appeared of that sort of  ice which is generally formed in bays or rivers. Others again were  different; the pieces forming various honey-combed branches, exactly like  coral rocks, and exhibiting such a variety of figures as can hardly be  conceived.    We supposed this ice to have broke from the main field we had lately left;  and which I was determined to get to the south of, or behind, if possible,  in order to satisfy myself whether or not it joined to any land, as had  been conjectured. With this view I kept on to the westward, with a gentle  gale at south, and S.S.W., and soon after six o'clock in the evening, we  saw some penguins, which occasioned us to sound; but we found no ground  with 150 fathoms.    In the morning of the 27th, we saw more loose ice, but not many islands;  and those we did see were but small. The day being calm and pleasant, and  the sea smooth, we hoisted out a boat, from which Mr Forster shot a penguin  and some peterels. These penguins differ not from those seen in other parts  of the world, except in some minute"]]]
