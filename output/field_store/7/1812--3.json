As the greater number of  such rolls have been found in the tombs of priests and others at Thebes,  the Recension that was in use from the eighteenth to the twenty-first  dynasty (1600-900 B.C.) is commonly called the THEBAN RECENSION. This  Recension, in its earliest form, is usually written with black ink in  vertical columns of hieroglyphs, which are separated by black lines; the  titles of the Chapters, the opening words of each section, and the  Rubrics are written with red ink. About the middle of the eighteenth  dynasty pictures painted in bright colours, \"vignettes,\" were added to  the Chapters; these are very valuable, because they sometimes explain or  give a clue to the meaning of parts of the texts that are obscure. Under  the twentieth and twenty-first dynasties the writing of copies of the  Book of the Dead in hieroglyphs went out of fashion, and copies written  in the hieratic, or cursive, character took their place. These were  ornamented with vignettes drawn in outline with black ink, and although  the scribes who made them wrote certain sections in hieroglyphs, it is  clear that they did not possess the skill of the great scribes who  flourished between 1600 and 1050 B.C. The last Recension of the Book of  the Dead known to us in a complete form is the SAITE RECENSION, which  came into existence about 600 B.C., and continued in use from that time  to the Roman Period. In the Ptolemaic and Roman Periods the priests  composed several small works such as the \"Book of Breathings\" and the  \"Book of Traversing Eternity,\" which were based upon the Book of the  Dead, and were supposed to contain in a highly condensed form all the  texts that were necessary for salvation. At a still later period even  more abbreviated texts came into use, and the Book of the Dead ended its  existence in the form of a series of almost illegible scrawls traced  upon scraps of papyrus only a few inches square.    Rolls of papyrus containing the Book of the Dead were placed: (1) In a  niche in the wall of the mummy chamber; (2) in the coffin by the side of  the deceased, or laid between the thighs or just above the ankles; (3)  in hollow wooden figures of the god Osiris, or Ptah-Seker-Osiris, or in  the hollow pedestals on which such figures stood.    The Egyptians believed that the souls of the dead on leaving this world  had to traverse a vast and difficult region called the Tuat, which was  inhabited by gods, devils, fiends, demons, good spirits, bad spirits,  and the souls of the wicked, to say nothing of snakes, serpents, savage  animals, and monsters, before they could reach the Elysian Fields, and  appear in the presence of Osiris. The Tuat was like the African \"bush,\"  and had no roads through it. In primitive times the Egyptians thought  that only those souls that were provided with spells, incantations,  prayers, charms, words of power, and amulets could ever hope to reach  the Kingdom of Osiris. The spells and incantations were needed for the  bewitchment of hostile beings of every kind; the prayers, charms, and  words of power were necessary for making other kinds of beings that  possessed great powers to help the soul on its journey, and to deliver  it from foes; and the amulets gave the soul that was equipped with them  strength, power, will, and knowledge to employ successfully every means  of assistance that presented itself.    The OBJECT OF THE BOOK OF THE DEAD was to provide the dead man with all  these spells, prayers, amulets, &c., and to enable him to overcome all  the dangers and difficulties of the Tuat, and to reach Sekhet Aaru and  Sekhet Hetep (the Elysian Fields), and to take his place among the  subjects of Osiris in the Land of Everlasting Life. As time went on the  beliefs of the Egyptians changed considerably about many important  matters, but they never attempted to alter the Chapters of the Book of  the Dead so as to bring them, if we may use the expression, \"up to  date.\" The religion of the eighteenth dynasty was far higher in its  spiritual character generally than that of the twelfth dynasty, but the  Chapters that were used under the twelfth dynasty were used under the  eighteenth, and even under the twenty-sixth dynasty. In religion the  Egyptian forgot nothing and abandoned nothing; what was good enough for  his ancestors was good enough for him, and he was content to go into the  next world relying for his salvation on the texts which he thought had  procured their salvation. Thus the Book of the Dead as a whole is a work  that reflects all the religious beliefs of the Egyptians from the time  when they were half savages to the period of the final downfall of their  power.    [Illustration: Vignette and Part of the XCIInd Chapter of the Book of  the Dead. (Ani and his Soul are leaving the Tomb) _From the Papyrus of  the Ani in the British Museum._]    The Theban Recension of the Book of the Dead contains about one hundred  and ninety Chapters, many of which have Rubrics stating what effects  will be produced by their recital, and describing ceremonies that must  be performed whilst they are being recited. It is impossible to describe  the contents of all the Chapters in our limited space, but in the  following brief summary the most important are enumerated. Chap. 1  contains the formulas that were recited on the day of the funeral. Chap.  151 gives a picture of the arrangement of the mummy chamber, and the  texts to be said in it. Chap. 137 describes certain magical ceremonies  that were performed in the mummy chamber, and describes the objects of  magical power that were placed in niches in the four walls. Chap. 125  gives a picture of the Judgment Hall of Osiris, and supplies the  declarations of innocence that the deceased made before the Forty-two  Judges. Chaps. 144-147, 149, and 150 describe the Halls, Pylons, and  Divisions of the Kingdom of Osiris, and supply the name of the gods who  guard them, and the formulas to be said by the deceased as he comes to  each. Chap. 110 gives a picture of the Elysian Fields and a text  describing all the towns and places in them. Chap. 5 is a spell by the  use of which the deceased avoided doing work, and Chap. 6 is another,  the recital of which made a figure to work for him. Chap. 15 contains  hymns to the rising and to the setting sun, and a Litany of Osiris; and  Chap. 183 is a hymn to Osiris. Chaps. 2, 3, 12, 13, and others enabled a  man to move about freely in the Other World; Chap. 9 secured his free  passage in and out of the tomb; and Chap. 11 overthrew his enemies.  Chap. 17 deals with important beliefs as to the origin of God and the  gods, and of the heavens and the earth, and states the different  opinions which Egyptian theologians held about many divine and  mythological beings. The reason for including it in the Book of the Dead  is not quite clear, but that it was a most important Chapter is beyond  all doubt. Chaps. 21 and 22 restored his mouth to the deceased, and  Chap. 23 enabled him to open it. Chap. 24 supplied him with words of  power, and Chap. 25 restored to him his memory. Chaps. 26-30B gave to  the deceased his heart, and supplied the spells that prevented the  stealers of hearts from carrying it off, or from injuring it in any way.  Two of these Chapters (29 and 30B) were cut upon amulets made in the  form of a human heart. Chaps. 31 and 32 are spells for driving away  crocodiles, and Chaps. 33-38, and 40 are spells against snakes and  serpents. Chaps. 41 and 42 preserved a man from slaughter in the Other  World, Chap. 43 enabled him to avoid decapitation, and Chap. 44  preserved him from the second death. Chaps. 45, 46, and 154 protected  the body from rot or decay and worms in the tomb. Chap. 50 saved the  deceased from the headsman in the Tuat, and Chap. 51 enabled him to  avoid stumbling. Chaps. 38, 52-60, and 62 ensured for him a supply of  air and water in the Tuat, and Chap. 63 protected him from drinking  boiling water there. Chaps. 64-74 gave him the power to leave the tomb,  to overthrow enemies, and to \"come forth by day.\" Chaps. 76-89 enabled a  man to transform himself into the Light-god, the primeval soul of God,  the gods Ptah and Osiris, a golden hawk, a divine hawk, a lotus, a  _benu_ bird, a heron, a swallow, a serpent, a crocodile, and into any  being or thing he pleased. Chap. 89 enabled the soul of the deceased to  rejoin its body at pleasure, and Chaps. 91 and 92 secured the egress of  his soul and spirit from the tomb. Chaps. 94-97 made the deceased an  associate of Thoth, and Chaps. 98 and 99 secured for him the use of the  magical boat, and the services of the celestial ferryman, who would  ferry him across the river in the Tuat to the Island of Fire, in which  Osiris lived. Chaps. 101 and 102 provided access for him to the Boat of  Ra. Chaps. 108, 109, 112, and 116 enabled him to know the Souls (_i.e._  gods) of the East and West, and of the towns of Pe,[1] Nekhen,[2]  Khemenu,[3] and Anu.[4] Chaps. 117-119 enabled him to find his way  through Rastau, a part of the kingdom of Seker, the god of Death. Chap.  152 enabled him to build a house, and Chap. 132 gave him power to return  to the earth and see it. Chap. 153 provided for his escape from the  fiend who went about to take souls in a net. Chaps. 155-160, 166, and  167 formed the spells that were engraved on amulets, _i.e._ the Tet  (male), the Tet (female), the Vulture, the Collar, the Sceptre, the  Pillow, the Pectoral, &c., and gave to the deceased the power of Osiris  and Isis and other gods, and restored to him his heart, and lifted up  his head. Chap. 162 kept heat in the body until the day of the  resurrection. Chaps. 175 and 176 gave the deceased everlasting life and  enabled him to escape the second death. Chap. 177 raised up the dead  body, and Chap. 178 raised up the spirit-soul. The remaining Chapters  perfected the spirit-soul, and gave it celestial powers, and enabled it  to enjoy intercourse with the gods as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15950"],[0,"Wilderness Ways (#10)"],[1,"brought up in the  woods to be scared by an owl.    Poor Kookooskoos! they shot him next night on his watch tower, and  nailed him to the camp door as a warning.    I discovered another curious thing about Kookooskoos that night when I  watched to find out what had struck me. I found out why he hoots.  Sometimes, if he is a young owl, he hoots for practice, or to learn  how; and then he makes an awful noise of it, a rasping screech, before  his voice deepens. And if you are camping near and are new to the  woods, the chances are that you lie awake and shiver; for there is no  other sound like it in the wilderness. Sometimes, when you climb to  his nest, he has a terrifying _hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo_, running up  and down a deep guttural scale, like a fiendish laugh, accompanied by  a vicious snapping of the beak. And if you are a small boy, and it is  towards twilight, you climb down the tree quick and let his nest  alone. But the regular _whooo-hoo-hoo_, _whooo-hoo_, always five  notes, with the second two very short, is a hunting call, and he uses  it to alarm the game. That is queer hunting; but his ears account for  it.    If you separate the feathers on Kookooskoos' head, you will find an  enormous ear-opening running from above his eye halfway round his  face. And the ear within is so marvelously sensitive that it can hear  the rustle of a rat in the grass, or the scrape of a sparrow's toes on  a branch fifty feet away. So he sits on his watch tower, so still that  he is never noticed, and as twilight comes on, when he can see best,  he hoots suddenly and listens. The sound has a muffled quality which  makes it hard to locate, and it frightens every bird and small animal  within hearing; for all know Kookooskoos, and how fierce he is. As the  terrifying sound rolls out of the air so near them, fur and feathers  shiver with fright. A rabbit stirs in his form; a partridge shakes on  his branch; the mink stops hunting frogs at the brook; the skunk takes  his nose out of the hole where he is eating sarsaparilla roots. A leaf  stirs, a toe scrapes, and instantly Kookooskoos is there. His fierce  eyes glare in; his great claws drop; one grip, and it's all over. For  the very sight of him scares the little creatures so, that there is no  life left in them to cry out or to run away.    A nest which I found a few years ago shows how well this kind of  hunting succeeds. It was in a gloomy evergreen swamp, in a big tree,  some eighty feet from the ground. I found it by a pile of pellets of  hair and feathers at the foot of the tree; for the owl devours every  part of his game, and after digestion is complete, feathers, bones,  and hair are disgorged in small balls, like so many sparrow heads.  When I looked up, there at the top was a huge mass of sticks, which  had been added to year after year till it was nearly three feet  across, and half as thick. Kookooskoos was not there. He had heard me  coming and slipped away silently.    Wishing to be sure the nest was occupied before trying the hard climb,  I went away as far as I could see the nest and hid in a thicket.  Presently a very large owl came back and stood by the nest. Soon  after, a smaller bird, the male, glided up beside her. Then I came on  cautiously, watching to see what they would do.    At the first crack of a twig both birds started forward the male  slipped away; the female dropped below the nest, and stood behind a  limb, just her face peering through a crotch in my direction. Had I  not known she was there, I might have looked the tree over twenty  times without finding her. And there she stayed hidden till I was  halfway up the tree.    When I peered at last over the edge of the big nest, after a  desperately hard climb, there was a bundle of dark gray down in a  little hollow in the middle. It touched me at the time that the little  ones rested on a feather bed pulled from the mother bird's own breast.  I brushed the down with my fingers. Instantly two heads came up, fuzzy  gray heads, with black pointed beaks, and beautiful hazel eyes, and a  funny long pin-feather over each ear, which made them look like little  wise old clerks just waked up. When I touched them again they  staggered up and opened their mouths,--enormous mouths for such little  fellows; then, seeing that I was an intruder, they tried to bristle  their few pin-feathers and snap their beaks.    They were fat as two aldermen; and no wonder. Placed around the edge  of the big nest were a red squirrel, a rat, a chicken, a few frogs'  legs, and a rabbit. Fine fare that, at eighty feet from the ground.  Kookooskoos had had good hunting. All the game was partly eaten,  showing I had disturbed their dinner; and only the hinder parts were  left, showing that owls like the head and brains best. I left them  undisturbed and came away; for I wanted to watch the young grow--which  they did marvelously, and were presently learning to hoot. But I have  been less merciful to the great owls ever since, thinking of the  enormous destruction of game represented in raising two or three such  young savages, year after year, in the same swamp.    Once, at twilight, I shot a big owl that was sitting on a limb facing  me, with what appeared to be an enormously long tail hanging below the  limb. The tail turned out to be a large mink, just killed, with a  beautiful skin that put five dollars into a boy's locker. Another time  I shot one that sailed over me; when he came down, there was a ruffed  grouse, still living, in his claws. Another time I could not touch one  that I had killed for the overpowering odor which was in his feathers,  showing that _Mephitis_, the skunk, never loses his head when  attacked. But Kookooskoos, like the fox, cares little for such  weapons, and in the spring, when game is scarce, swoops for and kills  a skunk wherever he finds him prowling away from his den in the  twilight.    The most savage bit of his hunting that I ever saw was one dark winter  afternoon, on the edge of some thick woods. I was watching a cat, a  half-wild creature, that was watching a red squirrel making a great  fuss over some nuts which he had hidden, and which he claimed somebody  had stolen. Somewhere behind us, Kookooskoos was watching from a pine  tree. The squirrel was chattering in the midst of a whirlwind of  leaves and empty shells which he had thrown out on the snow from under  the wall; behind him the cat, creeping nearer and nearer, had crouched  with blazing eyes and quivering muscles, her whole attention fixed on  the spring, when broad wings shot silently over my hiding place and  fell like a shadow on the cat. One set of strong claws gripped her  behind the ears; the others were fastened like a vise in the spine.  Generally one such grip is enough; but the cat was strong, and at the  first touch sprang away. In a moment the owl was after her, floating,  hovering above, till the right moment came, when he dropped and struck  again. Then the cat whirled and fought like a fury. For a few moments  there was a desperate battle, fur and feathers flying, the cat  screeching like mad, the owl silent as death. Then the great claws did  their work. When I straightened up from my thicket, Kookooskoos was  standing on his game, tearing off the flesh with his feet, and  carrying it up to his mouth with the same movement, swallowing  everything alike, as if famished.    Over them the squirrel, which had whisked up a tree at the first  alarm, was peeking with evil eyes over the edge of a limb, snickering  at the blood-stained snow and the dead cat, scolding, barking,  threatening the owl for having disturbed the search for his stolen  walnuts.    I caught that same owl soon after in a peculiar way. A farmer near by  told me that an owl was taking his chickens regularly. Undoubtedly the  bird had been driven southward by the severe winter, and had not taken  up regular hunting grounds until he caught the cat. Then came the  chickens. I set up a pole, on the top of which was nailed a bit of  board for a platform. On the platform was fastened a small steel trap,  and under it hung a dead chicken. The next morning there was  Kookooskoos on the platform, one foot in the trap, at which he was  pulling awkwardly. Owls, from their peculiar ways of hunting, are  prone to light on stubs and exposed branches; and so Kookooskoos had  used my pole as a watch tower before carrying off his game.    There is another way in which he is easily fooled. In the early  spring, when he is mating, and again in the autumn, when the young  birds are well fed and before they have learned much, you can bring  him close up to you by imitating his hunting call. In the wilderness,  where these birds are plenty, I have often had five or six about me at  once. You have only to go well out beyond your tent, and sit down  quietly, making yourself part of the place. Give the call a few times,  and if there is a young bird near with a full stomach, he will answer,  and presently come nearer. Soon he is in the tree over your head, and  if you keep perfectly still he will set up a great hooting that you  have called him and now do not answer. Others are attracted by his  calling; they come in silently from all directions; the outcry is  startling. The call is more nervous, more eerie, much more terrifying  close at hand than when heard in the distance. They sweep about like  great dark shadows, hoo-hoo-hooing and frolicking in their own uncanny  way; then go off to their separate watch towers and their hunting. But  the chances are that you will be awakened with a start more than once  in the night, as some inquisitive young owl comes back and gives the  hunting call in the hope of finding out what the first summons was all  about.
