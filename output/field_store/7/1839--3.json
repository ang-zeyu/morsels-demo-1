FIELD MARSHAL  HAIG, HEAD OF BRITISH ARMIES.]    In a later section of the same message the proposition was also advanced  that the American continent was no longer subject to colonization. This  clause of the doctrine was the work of Monroe's secretary of state, John  Quincy Adams, and its occasion was furnished by the fear that Russia was  planning to set up a colony at San Francisco, then the property of  Spain, whose natural heir on the North American continent, Adams held,  was the United States. It is this clause of the document that has  furnished much of the basis for its subsequent development.    In 1902 Germany united with Great Britain and Italy to collect by force  certain claims against Venezuela. President Roosevelt demanded and  finally, after threatening to dispatch Admiral Dewey to the scene of  action, obtained a statement that she would not permanently occupy  Venezuelan territory. Of this statement one of the most experienced and  trusted American editors, avowedly friendly to Germany, remarked at the  time, that while he believed \"it was and will remain true for some time  to come, I cannot, in view of the spirit now evidently dominant in the  mind of the emperor and among many who stand near him, express any  belief that such assurances will remain trustworthy for any great length  of time after Germany shall have developed a fleet larger than that of  the United States.\" He accordingly cautioned the United States \"to bear  in mind probabilities and possibilities as to the future conduct of  Germany, and therefore increase gradually our naval strength.\" Bismarck  pronounced the Monroe Doctrine \"an international impertinence,\" and this  has been the German view all along.    Dr. Zorn, one of the most conservative of German authorities on  international affairs, concluded an article in Die Woche of September  13, 1913, with these words: \"Considered in all its phases, the Monroe  Doctrine is in the end seen to be a question of might only and not of  right.\"    The German government's efforts to check American influence in the Latin  American states had of late years been frequent and direct. They  comprised the encouragement of German emigration to certain regions, the  sending of agents to maintain close contact, presentation of German  flags in behalf of the Kaiser, the placing of the German Evangelical  churches in certain South American countries under the Prussian State  Church, annual grants for educational purposes from the imperial  treasury at Berlin, and the like.    The \"Lodge resolution,\" adopted by the senate in 1912, had in view the  activities of certain German corporations in Latin America, as well as  the episode that immediately occasioned it; nor can there be much doubt  that it was the secret interference by Germany at Copenhagen that  thwarted the sale of the Danish West Indies to the United States in  1903.    In view of a report that a Japanese corporation, closely connected with  the Japanese government, was negotiating with the Mexican government for  a territorial concession off Magdalena Bay, in lower California, the  senate in 1912 adopted the following resolution, which was offered by  Senator Lodge of Massachusetts:         \"That when any harbor or other place in the American continent is       so situated that the occupation thereof for naval or military       purposes might threaten the communications or the safety of the       United States, the government of the United States could not see       without grave concern, the possession of such harbor or other place       by any corporation or association which has such a relation to       another government, not American, as to give that government       practical power of control for naval or military purposes.\"    All of the above documents, arguments and events were of the greatest  importance in connection with the great European struggle. America was  rapidly awakening, and the role of a passive onlooker became  increasingly irksome. It was pointed out that Washington's message said  we must not implicate ourselves in the \"ordinary vicissitudes\" of  European politics. This case rapidly was assuming something decidedly  beyond the \"ordinary.\" As the carnage increased and outrages piled up,  the finest sensibilities of mankind were shocked and we began to ask  ourselves if we were not criminally negligent in our attitude; if it was  not our duty to put forth a staying hand and use the extreme weight of  our influence to stop the holocaust.    From August 4 to 26, Germany overran Belgium. Liege was occupied August  9; Brussels, August 20, and Namur, August 24. The stories of atrocities  committed on the civil population of that country have since been well  authenticated. At the time it was hard to believe them, so barbaric and  utterly wanton were they. Civilized people could not understand how a  nation which pretended to be not only civilized, but wished to impose  its culture on the remainder of the world, could be so ruthless to a  small adversary which had committed no crime and desired only to  preserve its nationality, integrity and treaty rights.    Germany did not occupy Antwerp until October 9, owing to the stiff  resistance of the Belgians and engagements with the French and British  elsewhere. But German arms were uniformly victorious. August 21-23  occurred the battle of Mons-Charleroi, a serious defeat for the French  and British, which resulted in a dogged retreat eventually to a line  along the Seine, Marne and Meuse rivers.    The destruction of Louvain occurred August 26, and was one of the events  which inflamed anti-German sentiment throughout the world. The beautiful  cathedral, the historic cloth market, the library and other  architectural monuments for which the city was famed, were put to the  torch. The Belgian priesthood was in woe over these and other  atrocities. Cardinal Mercier called upon the Christian world to note and  protest against these crimes. In his pastoral letter of Christmas, 1914,  he thus pictures Belgium's woe and her Christian fortitude:         \"And there where lives were not taken, and there where the stones       of buildings were not thrown down, what anguish unrevealed!       Families hitherto living at ease, now in bitter want; all commerce       at an end, all careers ruined; industry at a standstill; thousands       upon thousands of workingmen without employment; working women;       shop girls, humble servant girls without the means of earning their       bread, and poor souls forlorn on the bed of sickness and fever       crying: 'O Lord, how long, how long?'--God will save Belgium, my       brethren; you can not doubt it. Nay, rather, He is saving       her--Which of us would have the heart to cancel this page of our       national history? Which of us does not exult in the brightness of       the glory of this shattered nation? When in her throes she brings       forth heroes, our mother country gives her own energy to the blood       of those sons of hers. Let us acknowledge that we needed a lesson       in patriotism--For down within us all is something deeper than       personal interests, than personal kinships, than party feeling, and       this is the need and the will to devote ourselves to that most       general interest which Rome termed the public thing, Res publica.       And this profound will within us is patriotism.\"    Meanwhile there was a slight offset to the German successes. Russia had  overrun Galicia and the Allies had conquered the Germany colony of  Togoland in Africa. But on August 26 the Russians were severely defeated  in the battle of Tannenburg in East Prussia. This was offset by a  British naval victory in Helgoland Bight. (August 28.)    So great had become the pressure of the German armies that on September  3 the French government removed from Paris to Bordeaux. The seriousness  of the situation was made manifest when two days later Great Britain,  France and Russia signed a treaty not to make peace separately. Then it  became evident to the nations of the earth that the struggle was not  only to be a long one, but in all probability the most gigantic in  history.    The Germans reached the extreme point of their advance, culminating in  the Battle of the Marne, September 6-10. Here the generalship of Joffre  and the strategy of Foch overcame great odds. The Germans were driven  back from the Marne to the River Aisne. The battle line then remained  practically stationary for three years on a front of three hundred  miles.    The Russians under General Rennenkampf were driven from East Prussia  September 16. Three British armored cruisers were sunk by a submarine  September 22. By September 27 General Botha had gained some successes  for the Allies, and had under way an invasion of German Southwest  Africa. By October 13 Belgium was so completely occupied by the Germans  that the government withdrew entirely from the country and established  itself at Le Havre in France. By the end of the year had occurred the  Battle of Yser in Belgium (October 16-28); the first Battle of Ypres  (decisive day October 31), in which the British, French and Belgians  saved the French channel ports; De Wet's rebellion against the British  in South Africa (October 28); German naval victory in the Pacific off  the coast of Chile (November 1); fall of Tsingtau, German possession in  China, to the Japanese (November 7); Austrian invasion of Serbia  (Belgrade taken December 2, recaptured by the Serbians December 14);  German commerce raider Emden caught and destroyed at Cocos Island  (November 10); British naval victory off the Falkland Islands (December  8); South African rebellion collapsed (December 8); French"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1662"],[0,"The 1997 CIA World Factbook (#10)"],[1,"(1912)    Constitution: an interim basic law was approved by the People's  Assembly on 29 April 1991; a draft constitution was rejected by  popular referendum in the fall of 1994 and a new draft is pending    Legal system: has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction    Suffrage: 18 years of age; universal and compulsory    Executive branch:  chief of state : President of the Republic Sali BERISHA (since 9 April  1992)  head of government: Prime Minister of the interim National  Reconciliation Government Bashkim FINO (since 12 March 1997)  cabinet: Council of Ministers appointed by the president  elections: president elected by the People's Assembly for a five-year  term; election last held NA 1992 (next to be held NA March 1997);  prime minister appointed by the president  election results : Sali BERISHA elected president; percent of People's  Assembly vote - NA    Legislative branch: unicameral People's Assembly or Kuvendi Popullor  (140 seats; most members are elected by direct popular vote and some  by proportional vote for four-year terms)  elections: last held 26 May 1996 (next tentatively scheduled for 29  June 1997)  election results: percent of vote by party - NA; seats by party - DP  122, PS 10, RP 3, UHP 3, Balli Kombetar 2    Judicial branch: Supreme Court, chairman of the Supreme Court is  elected by the People's Assembly    Political parties and leaders: Albanian Socialist Party or PS  (formerly the Albania Workers Party) [Fatos NANO, chairman];  Democratic Party or PD [Tritan SHEHU]; Albanian Republican Party or PR  [Sabri GODO]; Social Democratic Party or SDP [Skender GJINUSHI];  Democratic Alliance Party or DAP [Neritan CEKA, chairman]; Unity for  Human Rights Party or PBDNJ [Vasil MELO, chairman]; Movement for  Democracy Party or LDP [ruled by committee of Genc RULI, Alfred  SERREQI, Dashimir SHEHI, Maksim KONOMI]; Balli Kombetar [Hysen SELFO]    International organization participation: BSEC, CCC, CE, CEI, EBRD,  ECE, EU (applicant), FAO, IAEA, IBRD, ICAO, ICRM, IDA, IDB, IFAD, IFC,  IFRCS, ILO, IMF, IMO, Intelsat (nonsignatory user), Interpol, IOC,  IOM, ISO, ITU, NACC, OIC, OSCE, PFP, UN, UNCTAD, UNESCO, UNIDO,  UNOMIG, UPU, WFTU, WHO, WIPO, WMO, WToO, WTrO (applicant)    Diplomatic representation in the US:  chief of mission : Ambassador Lublin DILJA  chancery: Suite 1000, 1511 K Street NW, Washington, DC 20005  telephone: [1] (202) 223-4942, 8187  FAX: [1] (202) 628-7342    Diplomatic representation from the US:  chief of mission : Ambassador Marisa R.

The economy rebounded in 1993-95 after a severe depression  accompanying the collapse of the previous centrally planned system in  1990 and 1991. However, a weakening of government resolve to maintain  stabilization policies in the election year of 1996 contributed to  renewal of inflationary pressures, spurred by the budget deficit which  exceeded 12%. The collapse of financial pyramid schemes in early 1997  - which had attracted deposits from a substantial portion of Albania's  adult population - triggered unrest in much of the south in early  1997. The economy continues to be buoyed by remittances of some 20% of  the labor force which works abroad, mostly in Greece and Italy. These  remittances supplement GDP and help offset the large foreign trade  deficit. Most agricultural land was privatized in 1992, substantially  improving peasant incomes. Overall economic performance is likely to  be substantially worse in 1997; inflation will easily top 50% and GDP  may drop by 5% or more.    GDP: purchasing power parity - $4.4 billion (1996 est.)
