In order to discourage informers,  whom the prefects had much employed, and by whom the families in  Alexandria were much harassed, and to whom he laid the great falling off  in the population of that city, he orders, that if anybody should  make three charges and fail in proving them, he shall forfeit half his  property and lose the right of bringing an action at law. The land had  always paid a tax in proportion to the number of acres overflowed and  manured by the waters of the Nile; and the husbandmen had latterly been  frightened by the double threat of a new measurement of the land, and of  making it at the same time pay according to the ancient registers of the  overflow when the canals had been more open and more acres flooded; but  the prefect promises that there shall be no new measurements, and that  they shall only be taxed according to the actual overflow. In 69 A.D.  Galba was murdered, after a reign of seven months. Some of his coins,  however, are dated in the second year of his reign, according to the  Alexandrian custom of counting the years. They called the 29th of  August, the first new year's day after the sovereign came to the throne,  the first day of his second year.    Otho was then acknowledged as emperor by Rome and the East, while the  hardy legions of Germany thought themselves entitled to choose for  themselves. They set up their own general, Vitellius. The two legions in  Egypt sided with the four legions in Syria under Mucianus, and the  three legions which, under Vespasian, were carrying on the memorable  war against the Jews; and all took the oaths to Otho. We find no  hieroglyphical inscriptions during this short reign of a few weeks, but  there are many Alexandrian coins to prove the truth of the historian;  and some of them, like those of Galba, bear the unlooked-for word  _freedom_. In the few weeks which then passed between the news of Otho's  death and of Vespasian being raised to the purple in Syria, Vitellius  was acknowledged in Egypt; and the Alexandrian mint struck a few coins  in his name with the figure of Victory. But as soon as the legions of  Egypt heard that the Syrian army had made choice of another emperor,  they withdrew their allegiance from Vitellius, and promised it to his  Syrian rival.    Vespasian was at Caesarea, in command of the army employed in the Jewish  war, when the news reached him that Otho was dead, and that Vitellius  had been raised to the purple by the German legions, and acknowledged  at Rome; and, without wasting more time in refusing the honour than was  necessary to prove that his soldiers were in earnest in offering it, he  allowed himself to be proclaimed emperor, as the successor of Otho.  He would not, however, then risk a march upon Rome, but he sent to  Alexandria to tell Tiberius Alexander, the governor of Egypt, what he  had done; he ordered him to claim in his name the allegiance of that  great province, and added that he should soon be there himself. The two  Roman legions in Egypt much preferred the choice of the Eastern to  that of the Western army, and the Alexandrians, who had only just  acknowledged Vitellius, readily took the oath to be faithful to  Vespasian. This made it less necessary for him to hasten thither, and he  only reached Alexandria in time to hear that Vitellius had been murdered  after a reign of eight months, and that he himself had been acknowledged  as emperor by Rome and the Western legions. His Egyptian coins in the  first year of his reign, by the word _peace_, point to the end of the  civil war.    When Vespasian entered Alexandria, he was met by the philosophers and  magistrates in great pomp. The philosophers, indeed, in a city where,  beside the officers of government, talent formed the only aristocracy,  were a very important body; and Dion, Euphrates, and Apollonius had been  useful in securing for Vespasian the allegiance of the Alexandrians.  Dion was an orator, who had been professor of rhetoric, but he had given  up that study for philosophy. His orations, or declamations, gained for  him the name of Chrysostom, or _golden-mouthed_. Euphrates, his friend,  was a platonist, who afterwards married the daughter of the prefect of  Syria, and removed to Rome. Apollonius of Tyana, the most celebrated of  these philosophers, was one of the first who gained his eminence from  the study of Eastern philosophy, which was then rising in the opinions  of the Greeks as highly worth their notice. He had been travelling in  the East; and, boasting that he was already master of all the fabled  wisdom of the Magi of Babylon and of the Gymnosophists of India, he was  come to Egypt to compare this mystic philosophy with that of the hermits  of Ethiopia and the Thebaid. Addressing himself as a pupil to the  priests, he willingly yielded his belief to their mystic claims; and,  whether from being deceived or as a deceiver, whether as an enthusiast  or as a cheat, he pretended to have learned all the supernatural  knowledge which they pretended to teach. By the Egyptians he was  looked upon as the favourite of Heaven; he claimed the power of working  miracles by his magical arts, and of foretelling events by his knowledge  of astrology. In the Thebaid he was so far honoured that at the bidding  of the priests one of the sacred trees spoke to him, as had been their  custom from of old with favourites, and in a clear and rather womanly  voice addressed him as a teacher from heaven.    It was to witness such practices as these, and to learn the art of  deceiving their followers, that the Egyptian priests were now consulted  by the Greeks. The oracle at Delphi was silent, but the oracle of Ammon  continued to return an answer. The mystic philosophy of the East had  come into fashion in Alexandria, and the priests were more celebrated as  magicians than as philosophers. They would tell a man's fortune and the  year that he was to die by examining the lines of his forehead. Some of  them even undertook, for a sum of money, to raise the dead to life, or,  rather, to recall for a time to earth the unwilling spirits, and make  them answer any questions that might be put to them. Ventriloquism was  an art often practised in Egypt, and perhaps invented there. By this the  priests gained a power over the minds of the listeners, and could make  them believe that a tree, a statue, or a dead body, was speaking to  them.    The Alexandrian men of letters seldom erred by wrapping themselves up in  pride to avoid the fault of meanness; they usually cringed to the great.  Apollonius was wholly at the service of Vespasian, and the emperor  repaid the philosopher by flattery as well as by more solid favours.  He kept him always by his side during his stay in Egypt; he acknowledged  his rank as a prophet, and tried to make further use of him in  persuading the Egyptians of his own divine right to the throne.  Vespasian begged him to make use of his prayers that he might obtain  from God the empire which he had as yet hardly grasped; but Apollonius,  claiming even a higher mission from Heaven than Vespasian was granting  to him, answered, with as much arrogance as flattery, \"I have myself  already made you emperor.\" With the intimacy between Vespasian and  Apollonius begins the use of gnostic emblems on the Alexandrian coins.  The imperial pupil was not slow in learning from such a master; and  the people were as ready to believe in the emperor's miracles as in  the philosopher's. As Vespasian was walking through the streets of  Alexandria, a man well known as having a disease in his eyes threw  himself at his feet and begged of him to heal his blindness. He had been  told by the god Serapis that he should regain his sight if the emperor  would but deign to spit upon his eyelids. Another man, who had lost the  use of a hand, had been told by the same god that he should be healed if  the emperor would but trample on him with his feet. Vespasian at first  laughed at them and thrust them off; but at last he so far yielded  to their prayers, and to the flattery of his friends, as to have the  physicians of Alexandria consulted whether it was in his power to heal  these unfortunate men. The physicians, like good courtiers, were not so  unwise as to think it impossible; besides, it seemed meant by the god as  a public proof of Vespasian's right to the throne; if he were successful  the glory would be his, and if he failed the laugh would be against the  cripples. The two men were therefore brought before him, and in the face  of the assembled citizens he trampled on one and spit on the other; and  his flatterers declared that he had healed the maimed and given sight to  the blind.    Vespasian met with further wonders when he entered the temple of Serapis  to consult the god as to the state and fortunes of the empire. He went  into the inner sanctuary alone, and, to his surprise, there he beheld  the old Basilides, the freedman of Claudius, one of the chief men of  Alexandria, whom he knew was then lying dangerously ill, and several  days' journey from the city. He inquired of the priests whether  Basilides had been in the temple, and was assured that he had not. He  then asked whether he had been in Alexandria; but nobody had seen him  there. Lastly, on sending messengers, he learned that he was on his  death-bed eighty miles off. With this miracle"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17332"],[0,"History of Egypt From 330 B.C. To the Present Time, Volume 12 (of 12) (#10)"],[1,"death. Meanwhile, Venetian and  other European merchants negotiated for the ransom money, and the  sultan finally contented himself with two hundred thousand dinars (about  $500,000). Janos, however, was not set at liberty, but sent to Cyprus  as the sultan's vassal. After the death of Janos in 1432, his son, John  II., still continued to pay tribute to Egypt, and when he died (1458)  and his daughter Charlotte became Queen of Cyprus, James II., the  natural son of John II., fled to Egypt and found a friendly reception at  the sultan's court.    [Illustration: 069.jpg PRAYER-NICHE IN THE MOSQUE OF THE SULTAN MAHMUDI]    The sultan then ruling was Inal, and he promised to re-install James as  King of Cyprus. Meanwhile messengers arrived from the queen, offering a  higher tribute, and Inal allowed himself to be persuaded by his emirs  to acknowledge Charlotte as queen, and to hand James over to  her ambassadors. But as soon as the ambassadors had left the  audience-chamber, a tumult arose; the people declared that the sultan  had only the advantage of the Franks--especially of Prince Louis of  Savoy--in view, and they soon took such a threatening attitude that  Inal was forced to declare himself for James again and renew his former  preparations. In August, 1460, an Egyptian fleet bore James to Cyprus,  and with the help of the Egyptian troops he soon obtained the island,  with the exception of the fortress Cerines, which Queen Charlotte still  had in her power. The majority of the Egyptian troops now returned to  Egypt, and only some hundred men remained with James. Later, when the  Genoese declared themselves on the side of Charlotte, fresh troops had  to be sent out from Egypt, but, as soon as James had taken Famagosta and  had no further need of them, he dismissed them (1464).    Bursbai despised no means by which he might enrich himself; he  appropriated the greater part of the inheritance of the Jews and  Christians; he even taxed poor pilgrims, in spite of the fact that he  was a pious Moslem, prayed much, fasted, and read the Koran. He turned  Mecca into a money-market. At the very moment when pious pilgrims  were praying for the forgiveness of their sins, one of his heralds was  proclaiming: \"Whoever buys wares and does not pay toll for them in Egypt  has forfeited his life.\" That is to say, all wares bought in Mecca or  Jiddah had to go out of their way to Egypt in order to be laid under  toll in this land.    [Illustration: 071.jpg ORNAMENTAL PAGE FROM A KORAN OF THE FOURTEENTH  CENTURY]    In appointing his son Yusuf to the consulship, Bursbai counted on the  devotedness of his Mamluks, and the Emir Jakmak, whom he appointed as  his chief adviser, and, in fact, Yusuf's coronation, in June, 1438, met  with no resistance. After three months, however, Jakmak, feeling  himself secure, quietly assumed the sultan's place; at first he had much  resistance to put down, but soon his prudence and resolution established  him safely in spite of all opposition. As soon as the rebels in the  interior had been dealt with, Yusuf, as a good Muhammedan, wished to  attack the Christians, and chose the island of Rhodes as the scene of  the Holy War, hoping to obtain this island as easily as Bursbai had  obtained the island of Cyprus. But the Order of St. John, to whom this  island belonged, had its spies in Egypt, so that the sultan's intentions  were discovered and preparations for defence were made. The only  result of the sultan's repeated expeditions was the devastation of some  unimportant coast towns; all attempts on the capital failed, so that  the siege was soon raised and peace concluded with the chief master of  Rhodes (1444).    Jakmak's relations with the foreign chiefs were most friendly. He  constantly exchanged letters and gifts with both Sultan Murad and Shah  Roch. The sons of Kara Yelek and the princes of the houses of Ramadhan  and Dudgadir submitted to him; also Jihangir, Kara Yelek's grandson and  Governor of Amid, tried to secure his friendship, as did the latter's  deadly enemy, Jihan Shah, the son of Kara Yusuf.    [Illustration: 073.jpg MOSQUE OF KAIT BEY, CAIRO]    Jakmak's rule was mild compared with that of Bursbai, and we hear less  of extraordinary taxes, extortions, executions, and violence of the  Mamluks. Although he was beloved by the people and priests on account  of his piety, he could not secure the succession of his son Osman, in  favour of whom he abdicated fourteen days before his death (February,  1453). Osman remained only a month and a half on the throne; he made  himself odious to the emirs who did not belong to his Mamluks. The  Mamluks of his predecessors conspired against him, and at their head  stood his own Atabeg, the Emir Inal, a former Mamluk of Berkuk.  Osman was warned, but he only mocked those who recommended him to  watchfulness, since he believed his position to be unassailable. He  had forgotten that his father was a usurper, who, although himself a  perjurer, hoped to bind others by means of oaths. His eyes were not  opened until he had lost all means of defence. He managed to hold out  for seven days, after which the citadel was captured by the rebels, and  he was forced to abdicate on the 19th of March. Inal became, even more  than his predecessors had been, a slave to those Mamluks to whom he owed  his kingdom. They committed the greatest atrocities and threatened  the sultan himself when he tried to hold them in check. They plundered  corpses on their way to the grave, and attacked the mosques during the  hours of service in order to rob the pilgrims.    They were so hated and feared that, when many of them were carried off  by the plague, their deaths were recorded by a contemporary historian as  a benefit to all classes of society.    In the hour of his death (26th February, 1461), Inal appointed his son  Ahmed as his successor, but the latter was no more able to maintain  himself on the throne than his predecessors had been, in spite of his  numerous good qualities. He was forced to submit in the strife with his  emirs, and on the 28th of June, 1461, after a reign of four months and  three days, he was dethroned, and the Emir Khosh Kadem, a former slave  of the Sultan Sheikh, of Greek descent, was proclaimed in his stead.  Khosh Kadem reigned for seven years with equity and benignity, and under  one of his immediate successors, El-Ashraf Kait Bey, a struggle was  begun with the Ottoman Turks. On the death of Muhammed II., dissensions  had arisen between Bayazid II. and Jem. Jem, being defeated by Bayazid,  retired to Egypt, which led to the invasion and conquest of Syria,  hitherto held by the Sultan of Egypt. On surrendering Tarsus and Adana  to Bayazid, Kait Bey was suffered to end his days in peace in A.D. 1495.  After many dissensions, the brave and learned El-Ghuri ascended the  throne, and Selim I., the Turkish sultan, soon found a pretext for an  attack upon the Mamluk power. A long and sanguinary battle was fought  near Aleppo, in which El-Ghuri was finally defeated through treachery.  He was trampled to death by his own cavalry in their attempt to escape  from the pursuing Ottomans. With his death, in A.D. 1516, Egypt lost her  independence. Tuman Bey, a nephew of the deceased, fiercely contested  the advance of the Ottomans, but was defeated and treacherously killed  by the Turks.    [Illustration: 076.jpg WADI FEIRAN, IN THE SINAI PENINSULA]    A long period of Turkish misrule now opened for the ill-fated country,  though some semblance of conciliation was attempted by Selim's  appointment of twenty-four Mamluk beys as subordinate rulers over  twenty-four military provinces of Egypt. These beys were under the  control of a Turkish pasha, whose council was formed of seven Turkish  chiefs, while one of the Mamluk beys held the post of Sheikh el-Beled or  Governor of the Metropolis.    [Illustration: 077.jpg MAUSOLEUM OF EL-GHURI]    For nearly two centuries the Turkish pashas were generally obeyed in  Egypt, although there were frequent intrigues and quarrels on the part  of competing Mamluk beys to secure possession of the coveted post  of Sheikh el-Beled. Towards the middle of the eighteenth century the  authority of the Turkish pashas had become merely nominal, while that  of the beys had increased to such an extent that the government of Egypt  became a military oligarchy. The weakness of the Turks left the way open  for the rise of any adventurer of ability and ambition who might aspire  to lead the Mamluks to overthrow the sovereignty of the Porte.    In the year 1768 the celebrated Ali Bey headed a revolt against the  Turks, which he maintained for several years with complete success. A  period of good but vigorous government lasted Curing the years in which  he successfully resisted the Ottoman power. Ali's generals also gained  for him considerable influence beyond the borders of Egypt. Muhammed Abu  Dhahab was sent by him to Arabia and entered the sacred city of Mecca,  where the sherif was deposed. Ali also despatched an expedition to the  eastern shores of the Red Sea, and Muhammed Bey, after his successes in  Arabia, invaded Syria and wrested that province from the power of the  sultan. The victorious soldier, however, now plotted against his master  and took the lead in a military revolt. As a result of this, Ali Bey  fell into an ambuscade set by his own rebellious subjects, and died from  poisoning m 1786. Thus terminated the career of the famous Mamluk, a man  whose energy, talents, and ambition bear a strong resemblance to those  of the later Mehe-met Ali.    Muhammed Bey, the Mamluk who had revolted against Ali Bey, now tendered  his allegiance to the Porte. To the title of Governor of the Metropolis  was also added that of Pasha of Egypt. He subdued Syria, and died during  the pillage of Acre.    [Illustration: 080b.jpg Bonaparte in Egypt]         From painting by M. Orange    After his death violent dissensions again"]]]
