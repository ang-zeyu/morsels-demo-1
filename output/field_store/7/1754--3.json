The moon was rising, and as the beneficial effects of the storm of the  preceding evening were still felt in the clearness of the air, the rays  appeared to be more lustrous and full of beauty than they commonly were.    Each moment the night grew lighter, and by the time the brothers were  ready to take their places in the chamber of Flora, the moon had risen  considerably.    Although neither Henry nor George had any objection to the company of  Mr. Marchdale, yet they gave him the option, and rather in fact urged  him not to destroy his night's repose by sitting up with them; but he  said,--    \"Allow me to do so; I am older, and have calmer judgment than you can  have. Should anything again appear, I am quite resolved that it shall  not escape me.\"    \"What would you do?\"    \"With the name of God upon my lips,\" said Mr. Marchdale, solemnly, \"I  would grapple with it.\"    \"You laid hands upon it last night.\"    \"I did, and have forgotten to show you what I tore from it. Look  here,--what should you say this was?\"    He produced a piece of cloth, on which was an old-fashioned piece of  lace, and two buttons. Upon a close inspection, this appeared to be a  portion of the lapel of a coat of ancient times, and suddenly, Henry,  with a look of intense anxiety, said,--    \"This reminds me of the fashion of garments very many years ago, Mr.  Marchdale.\"    \"It came away in my grasp as if rotten and incapable of standing any  rough usage.\"    \"What a strange unearthly smell it has!\"    \"Now you mention it yourself,\" added Mr. Marchdale, \"I must confess it  smells to me as if it had really come from the very grave.\"    \"It does--it does. Say nothing of this relic of last night's work to any  one.\"    \"Be assured I shall not. I am far from wishing to keep up in any one's  mind proofs of that which I would fain, very fain refute.\"    Mr. Marchdale replaced the portion of the coat which the figure had worn  in his pocket, and then the whole three proceeded to the chamber of  Flora.           *       *       *       *       *    It was within a very few minutes of midnight, the moon had climbed high  in the heavens, and a night of such brightness and beauty had seldom  shown itself for a long period of time.    Flora slept, and in her chamber sat the two brothers and Mr. Marchdale,  silently, for she had shown symptoms of restlessness, and they much  feared to break the light slumber into which she had fallen.    Occasionally they had conversed in whispers, which could not have the  effect of rousing her, for the room, although smaller than the one she  had before occupied, was still sufficiently spacious to enable them to  get some distance from the bed.    Until the hour of midnight now actually struck, they were silent, and  when the last echo of the sounds had died away, a feeling of uneasiness  came over them, which prompted some conversation to get rid of it.    \"How bright the moon is now,\" said Henry, in a low tone.    \"I never saw it brighter,\" replied Marchdale. \"I feel as if I were  assured that we shall not to-night be interrupted.\"    \"It was later than this,\" said Henry.    \"It was--it was.\"    \"Do not then yet congratulate us upon no visit.\"    \"How still the house is!\" remarked George; \"it seems to me as if I had  never found it so intensely quiet before.\"    \"It is very still.\"    \"Hush! she moves.\"    Flora moaned in her sleep, and made a slight movement. The curtains were  all drawn closely round the bed to shield her eyes from the bright  moonlight which streamed into the room so brilliantly. They might have  closed the shutters of the window, but this they did not like to do, as  it would render their watch there of no avail at all, inasmuch as they  would not be able to see if any attempt was made by any one to obtain  admittance.    A quarter of an hour longer might have thus passed when Mr. Marchdale  said in a whisper,--    \"A thought has just struck me that the piece of coat I have, which I  dragged from the figure last night, wonderfully resembles in colour and  appearance the style of dress of the portrait in the room which Flora  lately slept in.\"    \"I thought of that,\" said Henry, \"when first I saw it; but, to tell the  honest truth, I dreaded to suggest any new proof connected with last  night's visitation.\"    \"Then I ought not to have drawn your attention to it,\" said Mr.  Marchdale, \"and regret I have done so.\"    \"Nay, do not blame yourself on such an account,\" said Henry. \"You are  quite right, and it is I who am too foolishly sensitive. Now, however,  since you have mentioned it, I must own I have a great desire to test  the accuracy of the observation by a comparison with the portrait.\"    \"That may easily be done.\"    \"I will remain here,\" said George, \"in case Flora awakens, while you two  go if you like. It is but across the corridor.\"    Henry immediately rose, saying--    \"Come, Mr. Marchdale, come. Let us satisfy ourselves at all events upon  this point at once. As George says it is only across the corridor, and  we can return directly.\"    \"I am willing,\" said Mr. Marchdale, with a tone of sadness.    There was no light needed, for the moon stood suspended in a cloudless  sky, so that from the house being a detached one, and containing  numerous windows, it was as light as day.    Although the distance from one chamber to the other was only across the  corridor, it was a greater space than these words might occupy, for the  corridor was wide, neither was it directly across, but considerably  slanting. However, it was certainly sufficiently close at hand for any  sound of alarm from one chamber to reach another without any difficulty.    A few moments sufficed to place Henry and Mr. Marchdale in that antique  room, where, from the effect of the moonlight which was streaming over  it, the portrait on the panel looked exceedingly life like.    And this effect was probably the greater because the rest of the room  was not illuminated by the moon's rays, which came through a window in  the corridor, and then at the open door of that chamber upon the  portrait.    Mr. Marchdale held the piece of cloth he had close to the dress of the  portrait, and one glance was sufficient to show the wonderful likeness  between the two.    \"Good God!\" said Henry, \"it is the same.\"    Mr. Marchdale dropped the piece of cloth and trembled.    \"This fact shakes even your scepticism,\" said Henry.    \"I know not what to make of it.\"    \"I can tell you something which bears upon it. I do not know if you are  sufficiently aware of my family history to know that this one of my  ancestors, I wish I could say worthy ancestors, committed suicide, and  was buried in his clothes.\"    \"You--you are sure of that?\"    \"Quite sure.\"    \"I am more and more bewildered as each moment some strange corroborative  fact of that dreadful supposition we so much shrink from seems to come  to light and to force itself upon our attention.\"    There was a silence of a few moments duration, and Henry had turned  towards Mr. Marchdale to say something, when the cautious tread of a  footstep was heard in the garden, immediately beneath that balcony.    A sickening sensation came over Henry, and he was compelled to lean  against the wall for support, as in scarcely articulate accents he  said--    \"The vampyre--the vampyre! God of heaven, it has come once again!\"    \"Now, Heaven inspire us with more than mortal courage,\" cried Mr.  Marchdale, and he dashed open the window at once, and sprang into the  balcony.    Henry in a moment recovered himself sufficiently to follow him, and when  he reached his side in the balcony, Marchdale said, as he pointed  below,--    \"There is some one concealed there.\"    \"Where--where?\"    \"Among the laurels. I will fire a random shot, and we may do some  execution.\"    \"Hold!\" said a voice from below; \"don't do any such thing, I beg of  you.\"    \"Why, that is Mr. Chillingworth's voice,\" cried Henry.    \"Yes, and it's Mr. Chillingworth's person, too,\" said the doctor, as he  emerged from among some laurel bushes.    \"How is this?\" said Marchdale.    \"Simply that I made up my mind to keep watch and ward to-night outside  here, in the hope of catching the vampyre. I got into here by climbing  the gate.\"    \"But why did you not let me know?\" said Henry.    \"Because I did not know myself, my young friend, till an hour and a half  ago.\"    \"Have you seen anything?\"    \"Nothing. But I fancied I heard something in the park outside the wall.\"    \"Indeed!\"    \"What say you, Henry,\" said Mr. Marchdale, \"to descending and taking a  hasty examination of the garden and grounds?\"    \"I am willing; but first allow me to speak to George, who otherwise  might be surprised at our long absence.\"    Henry walked rapidly to the bed chamber of Flora, and he said to  George,--    \"Have you any objection to being left alone here for about half an hour,  George, while we make an examination of the garden?\"    \"Let me have some weapon and I care not. Remain here while I fetch a  sword from my own room.\"    Henry did so, and when George returned with a sword, which he always  kept in his bed-room, he said,--    \"Now go, Henry. I prefer a weapon of this description to pistols much.  Do not be longer gone than necessary.\"    \"I will not, George, be assured.\"    George was then left alone, and Henry returned to the balcony, where Mr.  Marchdale was waiting for him. It was a quicker mode of descending to  the garden to do so by clambering over the balcony than any other, and  the height was not considerable enough to make it very objectionable, so  Henry and Mr. Marchdale chose that way of joining Mr. Chillingworth.    \"You are, no doubt, much surprised at finding me here,\" said the doctor;  \"but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14835"],[0,"The Burglar and the Blizzard: A Christmas Story (#10)"],[1," this so probable that he had no answer to give and  presently McVay, who had been grumbling over the matter to himself,  asked: \"Are you serious, Holland?\"    \"What do you suppose I am?\" Geoffrey roared, and McVay, shaking his head  went on with the work of clearing the table. He was very silent and  abstracted and for the first time seemed to realise his position. When  they had put away the last plate, Geoffrey said:    \"Now come to the library. I am going to give you a pipe, confound you.\"    \"A pipe! Why?\"    \"Because I want to give your sister something, and I think she would be  more apt to take it.\"    \"I'm afraid she is rather offended by the way you treated her little  gift. As a matter of fact I was the person to be offended, for I had  given her the pencil. A pretty little thing, singularly like one which  you may have seen Mrs.--\"    \"Don't tell me where you took it from. I don't want to know. Come and  get your pipe and mind you are grateful.\"    \"A pipe,\" observed McVay thoughtfully. \"I think I'll take that large  meerschaum on the mantelpiece.\"    Geoffrey laughed. \"I think you won't,\" he answered. \"The best pipe I  own! No, indeed, you'll take a horrid little one that won't draw. It  will be just the thing for you.\"    \"No,\" said McVay, \"no. You must give me the big one. Otherwise I shall  make it appear that you promised the other to me, and turned mean at the  last moment. And I can do it, Holland.\" His little eyes gleamed at the  thought. \"I shall say, 'My dear fellow, I'm glad you changed your mind  about the meerschaum; it was as you say, too handsome for a man in my  position.' That will make her mad if anything will. You know she is not  quite satisfied with the way you treat me, as it is.\"    This was quite true, and Geoffrey, remembering that the object of the  gift was to please the girl, reluctantly agreed to part with his  favourite pipe. The affair went off well. McVay affected to hesitate  over accepting so handsome an offering, and Geoffrey pressed it upon him  with a good grace.    As far as his present to the girl was concerned, he found himself less  and less willing to make it in McVay's presence, and more and more  unable to think of any way of getting rid of him except murder or the  cedar-closet. His anxiety was rendered more acute by the fact that once  or twice he could not help suspecting that Cecilia, in spite of her  anger, would have been glad of a few words alone with him, also.    Before very long she suggested that McVay should take her hat and coat  upstairs for her.    \"Certainly I will,\" cried Billy, springing up with alacrity, and was at  the door before Holland's warning shout \"_McVay_\" stopped him.    \"Let me take it up for your sister,\" he said warningly.    \"Oh, not at all. Let _me_,\" replied McVay courteously.    \"Couldn't hear of it,\" returned Geoffrey.    By this time they were both outside of the door, and Geoffrey closed it  with a snap.    \"You would, would you?\" he said angrily.    \"Now, Holland,\" said McVay as one who intends to introduce reason into  an irrational confusion, \"this is exactly a case in point. I am by  nature a gallant man. I forgot all about your instructions.\"    \"I wonder?\" said Geoffrey.    \"It was instinctive to do my sister the little favour she asked. Yes,  and I doubt if I should have acted differently if your pistol had been  at my head. She asked me. That was enough.\"    \"I've warned you once.\"    \"Holland, I think,--you'll excuse my telling you,--that you have a very  unfortunate manner at times.\"    They went upstairs together and were descending when Geoffrey stopped,  with his eyes on the grand piano which stood in the hall below them.    \"Can you play?\" he said.    McVay brightened at once. He had been looking a little glum since his  last speech. \"Yes,\" he answered, \"I can. Well, I'm not a professional,  you understand, but for an amateur I am supposed to have as much  technique and a good deal more sentiment than most.\"    \"I don't care _how_ you play,\" said Holland. \"There is a piano. Sit down  and play, and _don't stop_.\"    \"No, Holland, no,\" said the other with unusual firmness; \"that I will  not do. No artist would. Ask any one. It is impossible to play in public  without practice. I have not touched the instrument for over a year.\"    \"You can do all the practising you like here and now. You can play  finger exercises for all I care. All I insist is that you should make a  noise so that I'll know you are there.\"    \"Well,\" said McVay yielding, \"you must remember to make allowances. Not  the best musician could sit down after a year ... however, I dare say it  will come back to me quicker than to most people. You must make  allowances for my lack of practice.\"    \"There is only one thing I won't make allowances for, and that is your  moving from that music stool.\"    He opened the piano, and McVay sat down waving his fingers to loosen the  joints. He sat with his head on one side, as if waiting to discover  which of the great composers was about to inspire him. Then he dropped  lightly upon the notes, lifting his chin, as if surprised to find that  an air of Schubert's was growing under his fingers. Geoffrey was  astonished to find that he really was, as he said, something of an  artist. He waited until he was fairly started and then returned to the  library.    \"Is that Billy?\" said the girl. \"It must be a great pleasure to him to  have a piano again. He is so fond of music.\"    \"He was not as eager to play as I to have him,\" said Geoffrey.    He came back quietly, and stood looking down at her for a moment. Then  he said, stretching out his hand:    \"I want my Christmas present.\"    \"I have none to give you.\"    \"You had.\"    \"I've changed my mind.\"    \"Why?\"    For the first time she looked at him. \"Mr. Holland,\" she said, \"you must  think me singularly unobservant. Do you suppose I don't see that you  dislike my brother. You refused the pencil--you did refuse it plainly  enough--because Billy had given it to me. I will not offer it to you  again. I know that Billy sometimes does rub people up the wrong way, but  I should think any one of any discernment could see that his faults are  only faults of manner.\"    She said this almost appealingly, and Geoffrey unable to agree, turned  with something like a groan, and resting his elbows on the mantelpiece,  covered his face with his hands.    \"Do you suppose that he does not see how you feel toward him? Are you by  any chance assuming that he bears with your manner on account of his own  comfort? You might at least be generous or acute enough to see that it  is only for my sake that he exercises so much self-control. He does not  want to make my position here more unendurable by quarrelling with you.  It makes me furious to see what you force him to put up with, the way  you speak to him, and look at him, as if he were your slave, or a  disobedient dog. His self-control is wonderful. I admire him more than I  can say.\"    \"And is my self-control nothing?\" he asked, without moving his hands  from his face.    \"Yours? I don't see any exercise of yours. Circumstances have put us at  your mercy, you are rich and fortunate, and as insolent as you choose to  be. Self-control? I don't see any evidence of it.\"    \"No?\" he said, and turning, looked at her with a violence that might  have set her on the right track. Under his eyes she looked down and  probably in the instant forgot all that she had been saying and feeling,  for when he added: \"I love you,\" her hands moved toward his, and she  made no resistance when he took her in his arms.          VII      McVay was left so long at the piano that he finally resorted to a series  of discords in order to recall himself to Holland's mind. His existence,  if he had only realised the fact, was so completely forgotten that he  might have made his escape with a good half hour to spare before either  of the others appreciated that the music had ceased. Not knowing this,  however, he did not dare stop his playing for an instant, until sheer  physical fatigue interfered. It was at this point that the discords  began, and brought Geoffrey into the hall.    The disposal of McVay for the night was a question to which Geoffrey had  given a great deal of thought. The cedar closet presented itself as a  safe prison, but in the face of McVay's repeated assertions that the air  had barely sufficed to support him during his former occupancy, it  looked like murder to insist. Geoffrey finally, when bed-time came,  locked him in a dressing-room off his own room. The window--the room was  on the third floor--gave on empty space, and against the only door he  placed his own bed, so that escape seemed tolerably difficult.    And to all other precautions, Geoffrey added his own wakefulness,  although toward morning weariness triumphed over excitement and he fell  asleep.    He was waked by an insistent knocking at his door, and he heard his name  called by Cecilia. He sprang up and found her standing in the hall. She  was wrapped in her sable coat, but shivering from cold or fear.    \"There is some one getting into the house. I heard a window open and  steps on the piazza, below my room. What can it be?\"    Geoffrey flung himself past her. The instinct of the hunter joined to  the obstinacy of his nature maddened him at the notion of McVay's  escape. On the opposite side of the house there was a piazza and on the  roof of this a neighbouring window opened. He threw it back and climbed  out.    The snow had stopped, and the moon was shining, paling a little before  the approaching dawn. Geoffrey could see a figure stealing quickly  across the snow. There was no question of its identity. His revolver,  which he had snatched from under his pillow and brought with him, he at  once levelled on the vanishing form; his finger was on the trigger, when  he felt a hand on his arm.    Leaning out of the window behind him the girl caught his arm. \"Don't "]]]
