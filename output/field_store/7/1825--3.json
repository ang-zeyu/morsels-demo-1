Congreve makes twelve thousand pounds more than a  counterbalance to the affection of Belinda. No poet will now fly his  favourite character at less than fifty thousand. Clarissa Harlowe had  but a moderate fortune.    In Sir John Vanbrugh's Confederacy, a woman of fashion is presented with  a bill of millinery _as long as herself_.--Yet it only amounts to a poor  fifty pounds! at present this sounds oddly on the stage. I have heard of  a lady of quality and fashion who had a bill of her fancy dressmaker,  for the expenditure of one year, to the tune of, or rather, which closed  in the deep diapason of, six thousand pounds!          THE EARLY DRAMA.    \"It is curious to trace the first rude attempts of the drama in various  nations; to observe at that moment how crude is the imagination, and to  trace the caprices it indulges; and that the resemblance in these  attempts holds in the earliest essays of Greece, of France, of Spain, of  England, and, what appears extraordinary, even of China and Mexico.\"    The rude beginnings of the drama of Greece are sufficiently known, and  the old _mysteries_ of Europe have been exhibited in a former article.  The progress of the French theatre has been this:--    Etienne Jodelle, in 1552, seems to have been the first who had a tragedy  represented of his own invention, entitled Cleopatra--it was a servile  imitation of the form of the Grecian tragedy; but if this did not  require the highest genius, it did the utmost intrepidity; for the  people were, through long habit, intoxicated with the wild amusement  they amply received from their farces and moralities.    The following curious anecdote, which followed the first attempt at  classical imitation, is very observable. Jodelle's success was such,  that his rival poets, touched by the spirit of the Grecian muse, showed  a singular proof of their enthusiasm for this new poet, in a _classical_  festivity which gave room for no little scandal in that day; yet as it  was produced by a carnival, it was probably a kind of drunken bout.  Fifty poets, during the carnival of 1552, went to Arcueil. Chance, says  the writer of the life of the old French bard Ronsard, who was one of  the present _profane_ party, threw across their road a _goat_--which  having caught, they ornamented the goat with chaplets of flowers, and  carried it triumphantly to the hall of their festival, to appear to  sacrifice to Bacchus, and to present it to Jodelle; for the goat, among  the ancients, was the prize of the tragic bards; the victim of Bacchus,  who presided over tragedy,        Carmine, qui tragico, vilem certavit ob hircum.    The goat thus adorned, and his beard painted, was hunted about the long  table, at which the fifty poets were seated; and after having served  them for a subject of laughter for some time, he was hunted out of the  room, and not sacrificed to Bacchus. Each of the guests made verses on  the occasion, in imitation of the Bacchanalia of the ancients. Ronsard  composed some dithyrambics to celebrate the festival of the goat of  Etienne Jodelle; and another, entitled \"Our travels to Arcueil.\"  However, this Bacchaualian freak did not finish as it ought, where it  had begun, among the poets. Several ecclesiastics sounded the alarm, and  one Chandieu accused Ronsard with having performed an idolatrous  sacrifice; and it was easy to accuse the moral habits of _fifty poets_  assembled together, who were far, doubtless, from being irreproachable.  They repented for some time of their classical sacrifice of a goat to  Tragedy.    Hardi, the French Lope de Vega, wrote 800 dramatic pieces from 1600 to  1637; his imagination was the most fertile possible; but so wild and  unchecked, that though its extravagances are very amusing, they served  as so many instructive lessons to his successors. One may form a notion  of his violation of the unities by his piece \"La Force du Sang.\" In the  first act Leocadia is carried off and ravished. In the second she is  sent back with an evident sign of pregnancy. In the third she lies in,  and at the close of this act her son is about ten years old. In the  fourth, the father of the child acknowledges him; and in the fifth,  lamenting his son's unhappy fate, he marries Leocadia. Such are the  pieces in the infancy of the drama.    Rotrou was the first who ventured to introduce several persons in the  same scene; before his time they rarely exceeded two persons; if a third  appeared, he was usually a mute actor, who never joined the other two.  The state of the theatre was even then very rude; the most lascivious  embraces were publicly given and taken; and Rotrou even ventured to  introduce a naked page in the scene, who in this situation holds a  dialogue with one of his heroines. In another piece, \"_Scedase, ou  l'hospitalite violee_,\" Hardi makes two young Spartans carry off  Scedase's two daughters, ravish them on the stage, and, violating them  in the side scenes, the spectators heard their cries and their  complaints. Cardinal Richelieu made the theatre one of his favourite  pursuits, and though not successful as a dramatic writer, his  encouragement of the drama gradually gave birth to genius. Scudery was  the first who introduced the twenty-four hours from Aristotle; and  Mairet studied the construction of the fable, and the rules of the  drama. They yet groped in the dark, and their beauties were yet only  occasional; Corneille, Racine, Moliere, Crebillon, and Voltaire  perfected the French drama.    In the infancy of the tragic art in our country, the bowl and dagger  were considered as the great instruments of a sublime pathos; and the  \"_Die all_\" and \"_Die nobly_\" of the exquisite and affecting tragedy of  Fielding were frequently realised in our popular dramas. Thomas Goff, of  the university of Oxford, in the reign of James I., was considered as no  contemptible tragic poet: he concludes the first part of his Courageous  Turk, by promising a second, thus:--        If this first part, gentles! do like you well,      The second part shall _greater murthers_ tell.    Specimens of extravagant bombast might be selected from his tragedies.  The following speech of Amurath the Turk, who coming on the stage, and  seeing \"an appearance of the heavens being on fire, comets and blazing  stars, thus addresses the heavens,\" which seem to have been in as mad a  condition as the poet's own mind:--        --How now, ye heavens! grow you      So proud, that you must needs _put on curled locks_,      And clothe yourselves in _periwigs of fire_!\"    In the Raging Turk, or Bajazet the Second, he is introduced with this  most raging speech:--        Am I not emperor? he that breathes a no      Damns in that negative syllable his soul;      Durst any god gainsay it, he should feel      The strength of fiercest giants in my armies;      Mine anger's at the highest, and I could shake      The firm foundation of the earthly globe;      Could I but grasp the poles in these two hands      I'd pluck the world asunder.      He would scale heaven, and when he had      ----got beyond the utmost sphere,      Besiege the concave of this universe,      And hunger-starve the gods till they confessed      What furies did oppress his sleeping soul.    These plays went through two editions: the last printed in 1656.    The following passage from a similar bard is as precious. The king in  the play exclaims,--        By all the ancient gods of Rome and Greece,      I love my daughter!--better than my niece!      If any one should ask the reason why,      I'd tell them--Nature makes the stronger tie!    One of the rude French plays, about 1600, is entitled \"_La Rebellion,  ou meseontentment des Grenouilles contre Jupiter_,\" in five acts. The  subject of this tragi-comic piece is nothing more than the fable of the  frogs who asked Jupiter for a king. In the pantomimical scenes of a wild  fancy, the actors were seen croaking in their fens, or climbing up the  steep ascent of Olympus; they were dressed so as to appear gigantic  frogs; and in pleading their cause before Jupiter and his court, the  dull humour was to croak sublimely, whenever they did not agree with  their judge.    Clavigero, in his curious history of Mexico, has given Acosta's account  of the Mexican theatre, which appears to resemble the first scenes among  the Greeks, and these French frogs, but with more fancy and taste.  Acosta writes, \"The small theatre was curiously whitened, adorned with  boughs, and arches made of flowers and feathers, from which were  suspended many birds, rabbits, and other pleasing objects. The actors  exhibited burlesque characters, feigning themselves deaf, sick with  colds, lame, blind, crippled, and addressing an idol for the return of  health. The deaf people answered at cross-purposes; those who had colds  by coughing, and the lame by halting; all recited their complaints and  misfortunes, which produced infinite mirth among the audience. Others  appeared under the names of different little animals; some disguised as  beetles, some like toads, some like lizards, and upon encountering each,  other, reciprocally explained their employments, which was highly  satisfactory to the people, as they performed their parts with infinite  ingenuity. Several little boys also, belonging to the temple, appeared  in the disguise of butterflies, and birds of various colours, and  mounting upon the trees which were fixed there on purpose, little balls  of earth were thrown at them with slings, occasioning many humorous  incidents to the spectators.\"    Something very wild and original appears in this singular exhibition;  where at times the actors seem to have been spectators, and the  spectators were actors.          THE MARRIAGE OF THE ARTS.      As a literary curiosity, can we deny a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16351"],[0,"Critical and Historical Essays (#10)"],[1,"twenty-four  pipes of bamboo or metal are inserted; each one of these  pipes contains a metal reed, the vibration of which causes  the sound. Below the reed are cut small holes in the pipes,  and there is a pipe with a mouthpiece to keep the gourd,  which is practically an air reservoir, full of air. The air  rushing out through the bamboo pipes will naturally escape  through the holes cut below the reeds, making no sound, but  if the finger stops one or more of these holes, the air is  forced up through the reeds, thus giving a musical sound,  the pitch of which will be dependent on the length of the  pipes and the force with which the air passes through the reed.    Other instruments of the Chinese are gongs of all sizes,  trumpets, and several stringed instruments somewhat akin to our  guitars and mandolins. Neither the Chinese nor the Japanese  have ever seemed to consider the voice as partaking of the  nature of music. This is strange, for the language of the  Chinese depends on flexibility of the voice to make it even  intelligible. As a matter of fact, singing, in our sense of  the word, is unknown to them.          V    THE MUSIC OF THE CHINESE (Continued)      Having described the musical instruments in use in China  we still have for consideration the music itself, and the  conditions which led up to it.    Among the Chinese instruments mentioned in the preceding  chapter, the preponderance of instruments of percussion, such  as drums, gongs, bells, etc., has probably been noticed. In  connection with the last named we meet with one of the two cases  in Chinese art in which we see the same undercurrent of feeling,  or rather superstition, as that found among western nations. We  read in the writings of Mencius, the Chinese philosopher (350  B.C.), the following bit of gossip about the king Senen of Tse.      \"The king,\" said he, \"was sitting aloft in the hall, when    a man appeared, leading an ox past the lower part of it.    The king saw him, and asked, 'Where is the ox going?'      \"The man replied, 'We are going to consecrate a bell with    its blood.'      \"The king said, 'Let it go. I cannot bear its frightened    appearance as if it were an innocent person going to the    place of death.'      \"The man answered, 'Shall we then omit the consecration    of the bell?'      \"The king said, 'How can that be omitted? Change the ox    for a sheep.'\"    As stated before, this is one of the few cases in which Chinese  superstition coincides with that of the West; for our own church  bells were once consecrated in very much the same manner, a  survival of that ancient universal custom of sacrifice. With  the exception of this resemblance, which, however, has nothing  to do with actual music, everything in Chinese art is exactly  the opposite of our western ideas on the subject.    The Chinese orchestra is composed of about sixteen different  types of percussion instruments and four kinds of wind and  stringed instruments, whereas in our European orchestras the  ratio is exactly reversed. Their orchestras are placed at  the back of the stage, ours in front of it. The human voice  is not even mentioned in their list of musical sounds (sound  of metal, baked clay, wood, skin, bamboo, etc)., whereas we  consider it the most nearly perfect instrument existing. This  strange perversity once caused much discussion in days when  we knew less of China than we do at present, as to whether  the Chinese organs of hearing were not entirely different from  those of western nations. We now know that this contradiction  runs through all their habits of life. With them white is the  colour indicative of mourning; the place of honour is on the  left hand; the seat of intellect is in the stomach; to take off  one's hat is considered an insolent gesture; the magnetic needle  of the Chinese compass is reckoned as pointing south, instead of  north; even up to the middle of the nineteenth century the chief  weapon in war was the bow and arrow, although they were long  before acquainted with gunpowder--and so on, _ad infinitum_.    We are aware that the drum is the most primitive instrument  known to man. If all our knowledge of the Chinese were included  in a simple list of their orchestral instruments, we should  recognize at once that the possession of the gourd, mouth-organ,  and lute indicates a nation which has reached a high state of  civilization; on the other hand, the great preponderance of  bells, gongs, drums, etc., points unmistakably to the fact  that veneration of the laws and traditions of the past (a  past of savage barbarism), and a blind acquiescence in them,  must constitute the principal factor in that civilization. The  writings of Chinese philosophers are full of wise sayings  about music, but in practice the music itself becomes almost  unbearable. For instance, in the Confucian _Analects_ we read,  \"The Master (Confucius)[02] said: 'How to play music may be  known. At the commencement of the piece, all the parts should  sound together. As it proceeds, they should be in harmony,  severally distinct, and flowing without a break, and thus on  to the conclusion.'\" The definition is certainly remarkable  when one considers that it was given about five hundred  years before our era. In practice, however, the Chinese do  not distinguish between musical _combinations_ of sound and  _noise_; therefore the above definition must be taken in a very  different sense from that which ordinarily would be the case. By  harmony, Confucius evidently means similarity of noises, and by  \"melody flowing without a break\" he means absolute monotony of  rhythm. We know this from the hymns to the ancestors which,  with the hymns to the Deity, are the sacred songs of China,  songs which have come down from time immemorial.    According to Amiot one of the great court functions is the  singing of the \"Hymn to the Ancestors,\" which is conducted  by the Emperor. Outside the hall where this ceremony takes  place are stationed a number of bell and gong players who  may not enter, but who, from time to time, according to fixed  laws, join in the music played and sung inside. In the hall  the orchestra is arranged in the order prescribed by law:  the _ou_, or wooden tiger, which ends every piece, is placed  at the northwest end of the orchestra, and the _tschou_, or  wooden box-drum, which begins the music, at the northeast;  in the middle are placed the singers who accompany the hymn  by posturing as well as by chanting. At the back of the hall  are pictures of the ancestors, or merely tablets inscribed  with their names, before which is a kind of altar, bearing  flowers and offerings. The first verse of the hymn consists of  eight lines in praise of the godlike virtues of the ancestors,  whose spirits are supposed to descend from Heaven and enter  the hall during the singing of this verse by the chorus. Then  the Emperor prostrates himself three times before the altar,  touching his head to the earth each time. As he offers the  libations and burns the perfumes on the altar, the chorus  sings the second verse of eight lines, in which the spirits  are thanked for answering the prayer and entreated to accept  the offerings. The Emperor then prostrates himself nine times,  after which he resumes his position before the altar, while  the last verse of eight lines, eulogistic of the ancestors,  is being chanted; during this the spirits are supposed to  ascend again to Heaven. The hymn ends with the scraping of  the tiger's back and striking it on the head.    We can imagine the partial gloom of this species of chapel,  lighted by many burning, smoky joss-sticks, with its glint  of many-coloured silks, and gold embroidery; the whining,  nasal, half-spoken, monotonous drone of the singers with their  writhing figures bespangled with gold and vivid colour; the  incessant stream of shrill tones from the wind instruments;  the wavering, light clatter of the musical stones broken  by the steady crash of gongs and the deep booming of large  drums; while from outside, the most monstrous bell-like noises  vaguely penetrate the smoke-laden atmosphere. The ceremony  must be barbarously impressive; the strange magnificence of it  all, together with the belief in the actual presence of the  spirits, which the vague white wreaths of joss-stick smoke  help to suggest, seem to lend it dignity. From the point of  view of what we call music, the hymn is childish enough; but  we must keep in mind the definition of Confucius. According  to the Chinese, music includes that phase of sound which we  call mere noise, and the harmonizing of this noise is Chinese  art. We must admit, therefore, that from this point of view  their orchestra is well balanced, for what will rhyme better  with noise than more noise? The gong is best answered by the  drum, and the tomtom by the great bell.    China also has its folk song, which seems to be an irrepressible  flower of the field in all countries. This also follows the  precepts of the sages in using only the five-note or pentatonic  scale found among so many other nationalities. It differs,  however, from the official or religious music, inasmuch as  that unrhythmic perfection of monotony, so loved by Confucius,  Mencius, and their followers, is discarded in favour of a style  more naturally in touch with human emotion. These folk songs  have a strong similarity to Scotch and Irish songs, owing to  the absence of the fourth and seventh degrees of the scale.  If they were really sung to the accompaniment of chords, the  resemblance would be very striking. The Chinese singing voice,  however, is not sonorous, the quality commonly used being a  kind of high, nasal whine, very far removed from what we call  music. The accompaniment of the songs is of a character most  discordant to European ears, consisting as it does mainly of  constant drum or gong beats interspersed with the shrill notes  of the _kin_, the principal"]]]
