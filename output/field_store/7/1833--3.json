[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16467"],[0,"Musicians of To-Day (#10)"],[1," people condemn _a priori_ Berlioz's  _Romeo_. They think it childish to try and _translate_ action into  music. I suppose they think it less childish to _illustrate_ an action  by music. Do they think that gesture associates itself very happily with  music? If only they would try to root up this great fiction, which has  bothered us for the last three centuries; if only they would open their  eyes and see--what great men like Rousseau and Tolstoy saw so  clearly--the silliness of opera; if only they would see the anomalies of  the Bayreuth show. In the second act of _Tristan_ there is a celebrated  passage, where Ysolde, burning with desire, is waiting for Tristan; she  sees him come at last, and from afar she waves her scarf to the  accompaniment of a phrase repeated several times by the orchestra. I  cannot express the effect produced on me by that _imitation_ (for it is  nothing else) of a series of sounds by a series of gestures; I can never  see it without indignation or without laughing. The curious thing is  that when one hears this passage at a concert, one sees the gesture. At  the theatre either one does not \"see\" it, or it appears childish. The  natural action becomes stiff when clad in musical armour, and the  absurdity of trying to make the two agree is forced upon one. In the  music of _Rheingold_ one pictures the stature and gait of the giants,  and one sees the lightning gleam and the rainbow reflected on the  clouds. In the theatre it is like a game of marionettes; and one feels  the impassable gulf between music and gesture. Music is a world apart.  When music wishes to depict the drama, it is not real action which is  reflected in it, it is the ideal action transfigured by the spirit, and  perceptible only to the inner vision. The worst foolishness is to  present two visions--one for the eyes and one for the spirit. Nearly  always they kill each other.    The other argument urged against the symphony with a programme is the  pretended classical argument (it is not really classical at all).  \"Music,\" they say, \"is not meant to express definite subjects; it is  only fitted for vague ideas. The more indefinite it is, the greater its  power, and the more it suggests.\" I ask, What is an indefinite art? What  is a vague art? Do not the two words contradict each other? Can this  strange combination exist at all? Can an artist write anything that he  does not clearly conceive? Do people think he composes at random as his  genius whispers to him? One must at least say this: A symphony of  Beethoven's is a \"definite\" work down to its innermost folds; and  Beethoven had, if not an exact knowledge, at least a clear intuition of  what he was about. His last quartets are descriptive symphonies of his  soul, and very differently carried out from Berlioz's symphonies. Wagner  was able to analyse one of the former under the name of \"A Day with  Beethoven.\" Beethoven was always trying to translate into music the  depths of his heart, the subtleties of his spirit, which are not to be  explained clearly by words, but which are as definite as words--in fact,  more definite; for a word, being an abstract thing, sums up many  experiences and comprehends many different meanings. Music is a hundred  times more expressive and exact than speech; and it is not only her  right to express particular emotions and subjects, it is her duty. If  that duty is not fulfilled, the result is not music--it is nothing at  all.    Berlioz is thus the true inheritor of Beethoven's thought. The  difference between a work like _Romeo_ and one of Beethoven's symphonies  is that the former, it would seem, endeavours to express objective  emotions and subjects in music. I do not see why music should not follow  poetry in getting away from introspection and trying to paint the drama  of the universe. Shakespeare is as good as Dante. Besides, one may add,  it is always Berlioz himself that is discovered in his music: it is his  soul starving for love and mocked at by shadows which is revealed  through all the scenes of _Romeo_.    I will not prolong a discussion where so many things must be left  unsaid. But I would suggest that, once and for all, we get rid of these  absurd endeavours to fence in art. Do not let us say: Music can....  Music cannot express such-and-such a thing. Let us say rather, If genius  pleases, everything is possible; and if music so wishes, she may be  painting and poetry to-morrow. Berlioz has proved it well in his  _Romeo_.    This _Romeo_ is an extraordinary work: \"a wonderful isle, where a temple  of pure art is set up.\" For my part, not only do I consider it equal to  the most powerful of Wagner's creations, but I believe it to be richer  in its teaching and in its resources for art--resources and teaching  which contemporary French art has not yet fully turned to account. One  knows that for several years the young French school has been making  efforts to deliver our music from German models, to create a language of  recitative that shall belong to France and that the _leitmotif_ will not  overwhelm; a more exact and less heavy language, which in expressing the  freedom of modern thought will not have to seek the help of the  classical or Wagnerian forms. Not long ago, the _Schola Cantorum_  published a manifesto that proclaimed \"the liberty of musical  declamation ... free speech in free music ... the triumph of natural  music with the free movement of speech and the plastic rhythm of the  ancient dance\"--thus declaring war on the metrical art of the last three  centuries.[84]    [Footnote 84: _Tribune de Saint Gervais_, November, 1903.]    Well, here is that music; you will nowhere find a more perfect model. It  is true that many who profess the principles of this music repudiate  the model, and do not hide their disdain for Berlioz. That makes me  doubt a little, I admit, the results of their efforts. If they do not  feel the wonderful freedom of Berlioz's music, and do not see that it  was the delicate veil of a very living spirit, then I think there will  be more of archaism than real life in their pretensions to \"free music.\"  Study, not only the most celebrated pages of his work, such as the  _Scene d'amour_ (the one of all his compositions that Berlioz himself  liked best),[85] _La Tristesse de Romeo_, or _La Fete des Capulet_  (where a spirit like Wagner's own unlooses and subdues again tempests of  passion and joy), but take less well-known pages, such as the  _Scherzetto chante de la reine Mab_, or the _Reveil de Juliette_, and  the music describing the death of the two lovers.[86] In the one what  light grace there is, in the other what vibrating passion, and in both  of them what freedom and apt expression of ideas. The language is  magnificent, of wonderful clearness and simplicity; not a word too much,  and not a word that does not reveal an unerring pen. In nearly all the  big works of Berlioz before 1845 (that is up to the _Damnation_) you  will find this nervous precision and sweeping liberty.    [Footnote 85: _Memoires_, II, 365.]    [Footnote 86: \"This composition contains a dose of sublimity much too  strong for the ordinary public; and Berlioz, with the splendid insolence  of genius, advises the conductor, in a note, to turn the page and pass  it over\" (Georges de Massougnes, _Berlioz_). This fine study by Georges  de Massougnes appeared in 1870, and is very much in advance of its  time.]    Then there is the freedom of his rhythms. Schumann, who was nearest to  Berlioz of all musicians of that time, and, therefore, best able to  understand him, had been struck by this since the composition of the  _Symphonic fantastique_,[87] He wrote:--         \"The present age has certainly not produced a work in which similar       times and rhythms combined with dissimilar times and rhythms have       been more freely used. The second part of a phrase rarely       corresponds with the first, the reply to the question. This anomaly       is characteristic of Berlioz, and is natural to his southern       temperament.\"    Far from objecting to this, Schumann sees in it something necessary to  musical evolution.         \"Apparently music is showing a tendency to go back to its       beginnings, to the time when the laws of rhythm did not yet trouble       her; it seems that she wishes to free herself, to regain an       utterance that is unconstrained, and raise herself to the dignity       of a sort of poetic language.\"    And Schumann quotes these words of Ernest Wagner: \"He who shakes off the  tyranny of time and delivers us from it will, as far as one can see,  give back freedom to music.\"[88]    [Footnote 87: \"Oh, how I love, honour, and reverence Schumann for having  written this article alone\" (Hugo Wolf, 1884).]    [Footnote 88: _Neue Zeitschrift fuer Musik_. See _Hector Berlioz und  Robert Schumann_. Berlioz was constantly righting for this freedom of  rhythm--for \"those harmonies of rhythm,\" as he said. He wished to form a  Rhythm class at the Conservatoire (_Memoires_, II, 241), but such a  thing was not understood in France. Without being as backward as Italy  on this point, France is still resisting the emancipation of rhythm  (_Memoires_, II, 196). But during the last ten years great progress in  music has been made in France.]    Remark also Berlioz's freedom of melody. His musical phrases pulse and  flow like life itself. \"Some phrases taken separately,\" says Schumann,  \"have such an intensity that they will not bear harmonising--_as in many  ancient folk-songs_--and often even an accompaniment spoils their  fulness.\"[89] These melodies so correspond with the emotions, that they  reproduce the least thrills of body and mind by their vigorous  workings-up and delicate reliefs, by splendid barbarities of modulation  and strong and glowing colour, by gentle gradations of light and shade  or imperceptible ripples of thought, which flow over the body like a  steady tide.

Mr. Cowley had designed a Discourse on Stile, and a Review of the  Principles of the Primitive Christian Church, but was prevented by  death. In Mr. Dryden's Miscellany Poems, we find a poem on the Civil  War, said to be written by our author, but not extant in any edition  of his works: Dr. Sprat mentions, as very excellent in their kind, Mr.  Cowley's Letters to his private friends, none of which were published.  As a poet, Mr. Cowley has had tribute paid him from the greatest names  in all knowledge, Dryden, Addison, Sir John Denham, and Pope. He is  blamed for a redundance of wit, and roughness of verification, but is  allowed to have possessed a fine understanding, great reading, and a  variety of genius. Let us see how Mr. Addison characterizes him in his  Account of the great English Poets.      Great Cowley then (a mighty genius) wrote,    O'errun with wit, and lavish of his thought;    His turns too closely on the readers press,    He more had pleased us, had he pleased us less:    One glittering thought no sooner strikes our eyes,    With silent wonder, but new wonders rise.    As in the milky way, a shining white    O'erflows the heavens with one continued light;    That not a single star can shew his rays,    Whilst jointly all promote the common blaze.    Pardon, great poet, that I dare to name,    Th' uncumber'd beauties of thy verse with blame;    Thy fault is only wit in its' excess,    But wit like thine, in any shape will please.    In his public capacity, he preserved an inviolable honour and loyalty,  and exerted great activity, with discernment: in private life, he was  easy of access, gentle, polite, and modest; none but his intimate  friends ever discovered, by his discourse, that he was a great poet;  he was generous in his disposition, temperate in his life, devout and  pious in his religion, a warm friend, and a social companion. Such is  the character of the great Mr. Cowley, who deserves the highest  gratitude from posterity, as well for his public as private conduct.  He never prostituted his muse to the purposes of lewdness and folly,  and it is with pleasure we can except him from the general, and too  just, charge brought against the poets, That they have abilities to do  the greatest service, and by misdirecting them, too frequently fawn  the harlot face of loose indulgence, and by dressing up pleasure in an  elegant attire, procure votaries to her altar, who pay too dear for  gazing at the shewy phantom by loss of their virtue. It is no  compliment to the taste of the present age, that the works of Mr.  Cowley are falling into disesteem; they certainly contain more wit,  and good sense, than the works of many other poets, whom it is now  fashionable to read; that kind of poetry, which is known by the name  of Light, he succeeds beyond any of his cotemporaries, or successors;  no love verses, in our language, have so much true wit, and expressive  tenderness, as Cowley's Mistress, which is indeed perfect in its kind.  What Mr. Addison observes, is certainly true, 'He more had pleased us,  had he pleased us less.' He had a soul too full, an imagination too  fertile to be restrained, and because he has more wit than any other  poet, an ordinary reader is somehow disposed to think he had less. In  the particular of wit, none but Shakespear ever exceeded Cowley, and  he was certainly as cultivated a scholar, as a great natural genius.  In that kind of poetry which is grave, and demands extensive thinking,  no poet has a right to be compared with Cowley: Pope and Dryden, who  are as remarkable for a force of thinking, as elegance of poetry, are  yet inferior to him; there are more ideas in one of Cowley's pindaric  odes, than in any piece of equal length by those two great genius's  (St. Caecilia's ode excepted) and his pindaric odes being now  neglected, can proceed from no other cause, than that they demand too  much attention for a common reader, and contain sentiments so  sublimely noble, as not to be comprehended by a vulgar mind; but to  those who think, and are accustomed to contemplation, they appear  great and ravishing. In order to illustrate this, we shall quote  specimens in both kinds of poetry; the first taken from his Mistress  called Beauty, the other is a Hymn to Light, both of which, are so  excellent in their kind, that whoever reads them without rapture, may  be well assured, that he has no poetry in his soul, and is insensible  to the flow of numbers, and the charms of sense.                                     BEAUTY.                                      I.          Beauty, thou wild fantastic ape,    Who dost in ev'ry country change thy shape!    Here black, there brown, here tawny, and there white;    Thou flatt'rer which compli'st with every sight!        Thou Babel which confound'st the eye    With unintelligible variety!        Who hast no certain what nor where,    But vary'st still, and dost thy self declare    Inconstant, as thy she-professors are.                                     II.          Beauty, love's scene and masquerade,    So gay by well-plac'd lights, and distance made;    False coin, and which th' impostor cheats us still;    The stamp and colour good, but metal ill!        Which light, or base, we find when we    Weigh by enjoyment and examine thee!        For though thy being be but show,    'Tis chiefly night which men to thee allow:    And chuse t'enjoy thee, when thou least art thou.                                     III.          Beauty, thou active, passive ill!    Which dy'st thy self as fast as thou dost kill!    Thou Tulip, who thy stock in paint dost waste,    Neither for physic good, nor smell, nor taste.        Beauty, whose flames but meteors are,    Short-liv'd and low, though thou would'st seem a star,        Who dar'st not thine own home descry,    Pretending to dwell richly in the eye,    When thou, alas, dost in the fancy lye.                                     IV.          Beauty, whose conquests still are made    O'er hearts by cowards kept, or else betray'd;    Weak victor! who thy self destroy'd must be    When sickness, storms, or time besieges thee!        Thou unwholesome thaw to frozen age!    Thou strong wine, which youths fever dost enrage,        Thou tyrant which leav'st no man free!    Thou subtle thief, from whom nought safe can be!    Thou murth'rer which hast kill'd, and devil which would damn me.                                  HYMN to LIGHT.                                      I.      First born of Chaos, who so far didst come,        From the old negro's darksome womb!        Which when it saw the lovely child,    The melancholly mass put on kind looks and smiled.                                     II.      Thou tide of glory, which no rest dost know,        But ever ebb, and ever flow!        Thou golden shower of a true Jove!    Who does in thee descend, and Heaven to earth make love!                                     III.      Hail active nature's watchful life, and health!        Her joy, her ornament and wealth!        Hail to thy husband heat, and thee!    Thou the world's beauteous bride, the lusty bridegroom he!                                     IV.      Say from what golden quivers of the sky,        Do all thy winged arrows fly?        Swiftness and power by birth are thine,    From thy great fire they came, thy fire the word divine.                                      V.      'Tis I believe this archery to shew        That so much cost in colours thou,        And skill in painting dost bestow,    Upon thy ancient arms, the gaudy heav'nly bow.                                     VI.      Swift as light, thoughts their empty career run,        Thy race is finish'd, when begun;        Let a Post-Angel start with thee,    And thou the goal of earth shall reach as soon as he.                                     VII.      Thou in the moon's bright chariot proud and gay,        Dost thy bright wood of stars survey;        And all the year doth with thee bring    O thousand flowry lights, thine own nocturnal spring.                                    VIII.      Thou Scythian-like dost round thy lands above        The sun's gilt tent for ever move,        And still as thou in pomp dost go,    The shining pageants of the world attend thy show.                                     IX.      Nor amidst all these triumphs dost thou scorn        The humble Glow-Worms to adorn,        And with those living spangles gild,    (O greatness without pride!) the blushes of the Field.                                      X.      Night, and her ugly subjects thou dost fright,        And sleep, the lazy Owl of night;        Asham'd and fearful to appear,    They skreen their horrid shapes, with the black hemisphere.                                     XI.      With 'em there hastes, and wildly takes th' alarm,        Of painted dreams, a busy swarm,        At the first opening of thine eye,    The various clusters break, the antick atoms fly.                                     XII.      The guilty serpents, and obscener beasts,        Creep conscious to their secret rests:        Nature to thee doth reverence pay,    Ill omens, and ill sights removes out of thy way.                                    XIII.      At thy appearance, grief itself is said,        To shake his wings, and rouze his head;        And cloudy care has often took    A gentle beamy smile, reflected from thy look.                                     XIV.      At thy appearance, fear itself grows bold;        Thy sun-shine melts away his cold:        Encourag'd at the sight of thee,    To the cheek colour comes, and firmness to the knee.                                     XV.      Even lust, the master of a harden'd face,        Blushes if thou be'st in the place,        To darkness' curtains he retires,    In sympathizing"]]]
