As to our Princes, most of us, including the Social Democrats, are glad  in our heart of hearts that we have them. As far back as our history  runs, and that is more than 2,000 years, we have had Princes. They have  never been more than their name, \"Fuerst,\" implies, the first and  foremost of German freemen, \"primi inter pares.\" Therefore they have  never acted independently, never without taking the people into counsel.  That would have been contrary to the most important fundamental  principles of German law; hence our people have never been \"de jure\"  without their representatives. Even in the times of absolute monarchy  the old \"estates of the realm\" had their being as a representative body,  and wherever and whenever these privileges were suppressed it was  regarded as a violation of our fundamental rights and is so still  regarded.    Our princely houses are as old as our monasteries, our cities, and our  cathedrals. A thousand years ago the Guelphs were a celebrated family,  and the Wettins have ruled over their lands for eight centuries. In the  twelfth century the Wittelsbachs and Thuringians were Princes under the  great Kaisers of the Hohenstaufen dynasty. Among these great families  the Hapsburgs (thirteenth century) and the Hohenzollerns (fifteenth  century) are quite young. All have their roots in Germany and belong to  the country.    We glory in our Princes. They link our existence with the earliest  centuries of our history. They preserve for us the priceless  independence of our small home States.    We are accused of militarism. What is this new and terrible crime? Since  the years of the wars of liberation against France and Napoleon we have  had what amounts practically to universal conscription. Only two  generations later universal suffrage was introduced. The nation has been  sternly trained by its history in the ways of discipline and  self-restraint. Germans are very far from mistaking freedom for license  and independence for licentiousness.    Germany has a long past. She enjoys the inheritance of an original and  priceless civilization. She holds clearly formulated ideals. To the  future she has all this to bequeath and, in addition, the intellectual  wealth of her present stage of development. Consider Germany's  contributions to the arts, the poetical achievements of the period of  Schiller and Goethe, the music of Handel, Bach, Haydn, Mozart, and  Beethoven; the thought systems of Kant, Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel!    The last decade has reawakened these great men in the consciousness of  the German Nation. Enriched by the consciousness and message of an  intellectual past, our people were moving forward to new horizons.    At that moment the war hit us. If you could only have lived these weeks  in Germany I do not doubt that what you would have seen would have led  your ripe experience to a fervent faith in a Divinely guided future of  mankind. The great spiritual movement of 1870, when I was a boy growing  up, was but a phantom compared to July and August of 1914. Germany was a  nation stirred by the most sacred emotions, humble and strong, filled  with just wrath and a firm determination to conquer--a nation  disciplined, faithful, and loving.    In that disposition we have gone to war and still fight. As for the  slanders of which we have been the victims, ask the thousands of  Frenchmen who housed German soldiers in 1870 and 1871, or ask the  Belgians of Ghent and Bruges! They will give you a different picture of  the \"Furor Teutonicus.\" They will tell you that the \"raging German\"  generally is a good-natured fellow, ever ready for service and sympathy,  who, like Parsifal, gazes forth eagerly into a strange world which the  war has opened to his loyal and patriotic vision.    KARL LAMPRECHT.          REVEILLE    By JOHN GALSWORTHY.    [From King Albert's Book.]      In my dream I saw a fertile plain, rich with the hues of Autumn.  Tranquil it was and warm. Men and women, children, and the beasts worked  and played and wandered there in peace. Under the blue sky and the white  clouds low-hanging, great trees shaded the fields; and from all the land  there arose a murmur as from bees clustering on the rose-colored  blossoms of tall clover. And, in my dream, I roamed, looking into every  face, the faces of prosperity, broad and well favored--of people living  in a land of plenty, of people drinking of the joy of life, caring  nothing for the morrow. But I could not see their eyes, that seemed ever  cast down, gazing at the ground, watching the progress of their feet  over the rich grass and the golden leaves already fallen from the trees.  The longer I walked among them the more I wondered that never was I  suffered to see the eyes of any, not even of the little children, not  even of the beasts. It was as if ordinance had gone forth that their  eyes should be banded with invisibility.    While I mused on this, the sky began to darken. A muttering of distant  winds and waters came traveling. The children stopped their play, the  beasts raised their heads; men and women halted and cried to each other:  \"The River--the River is rising! If it floods, we are lost! Our beasts  will drown; we, even we, shall drown! The River!\" And women stood like  things of stone, listening; and men shook their fists at the black sky  and at that traveling mutter of the winds and waters; and the beasts  sniffed at the darkening air.    Then, clear, I heard a Voice call: \"Brothers! The dike is breaking! The  River comes! Link arms, brothers; with the dike of our bodies we will  save our home! Sisters, behind us, link arms! Close in the crevices,  children! The River!\" And all that multitude, whom I had seen treading  quietly the grass and fallen leaves with prosperous feet, came hurrying,  their eyes no longer fixed on the rich plain, but lifted in trouble and  defiance, staring at that rushing blackness. And the Voice called:  \"Hasten, brothers! The dike is broken. The River floods!\"    And they answered: \"Brother, we come!\"    Thousands and thousands they pressed, shoulder to shoulder--men, women,  and children, and the beasts lying down behind, till the living dike was  formed. And that blackness came on, nearer, nearer, till, like the  whites of glaring eyes, the wave crests glinted in the dark rushing  flood. And the sound of the raging waters was as a roar from a million  harsh mouths.    But the Voice called: \"Hold, brothers! Hold!\"    And from the living dike came answer: \"Brother! We hold!\"    Then the sky blackened to night. And the terrible dark water broke on  that dike of life; and from all the thin living wall rose such cry of  struggle as never was heard.    But above it ever the Voice called: \"Hold! My brave ones, hold!\"    And ever the answer came from those drowning mouths, of men and women,  of little children and the very beasts: \"Brother! We hold!\" But the  black flood rolled over and on. There, down in its dark tumult, beneath  its cruel tumult, I saw men still with arms linked; women on their  knees, clinging to earth; little children drifting--dead, all dead; and  the beasts dead. And their eyes were still open facing that death. And  above them the savage water roared. But clear and high I heard the Voice  call: \"Brothers! Hold! Death is not! We live!\"          Can Germany Be Starved Out?    An Answer by Sixteen German Specialists[1]    [Footnote 1: Die Deutsche Volksernaehrung und der Englische  Aushungerungsplan. Eine Denkschrift von Friedrich Aereboe, Karl Ballod,  Franz Beyschlag, Wilhelm Caspari, Paul Eltzbacher, Hedwig Heyl, Paul  Krusch, Robert Kuczynski, Kurt Lehmann, Otto Lemmermann, Karl  Oppenheimer, Max Rubner, Kurt von Ruemker, Bruno Tacke, Hermann Warmbold,  und Nathan Zuntz. Herausgegeben von Paul Eltzbacher. (Friedr. Vieweg and  Sohn. Braunschweig. 1914.)]    [From The Annalist of New York, March 1, 1915.]      BERLIN, Feb. 1, 1915.    Probably the most interesting economic problem in the world at this  moment is whether England can succeed in starving out Germany. While the  world at large is chiefly interested in the vast political issues  involved, the question interests the Germans not only from that  standpoint, but also--and how keenly!--from the mere bread-and-butter  standpoint. For if Germany cannot feed its own population during the  long war that its foes are predicting with so much assurance, her defeat  is only a question of time.    That the German Government is keenly aware of the dangers of the  situation is evident from the rigorous measures that it has taken to  conserve and economize the food supply. After having fixed maximum  prices for cereals soon after the war began, the Government last week  decided to requisition and monopolize all the wheat and rye in the  country, and allow the bakers to sell only a limited quantity of bread  (2.2 pounds per capita a week) to each family. It had previously taken  measures to restrict the consumption of cereals for other purposes than  breadmaking; the feeding of rye was prohibited and its use in producing  alcohol was restricted by 40 per cent.; a percentage of potato flour was  ordered added to rye flour, and of the latter to wheat flour in making  bread. These are but a few of the economic measures adopted by the  Government since the outbreak of the war.    The general opinion of the people in Germany is that the country cannot  be starved out, and this opinion is asserted with a great deal of  patriotic fervor, particularly by newspaper editors. The leading  scientists of the country, moreover, have taken up the question in a  thoroughgoing way and investigated it in all its bearings. A little book  (\"Die Deutsche Volksernaehrung und der Englische Aushungerungsplan\") has  just been issued, giving the conclusions of sixteen specialists in  various fields, which"]]]
