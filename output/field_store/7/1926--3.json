Schiaparelli made this announcement concerning Venus but a few weeks  after publishing his discovery of Mercury's peculiar rotation. He  himself appears to be equally confident in both cases of the  correctness of his conclusions and the certainty of his observation. As  with Mercury, several other observers have corroborated him, and  particularly Percival Lowell in this country. Mr. Lowell, indeed, seems  unwilling to admit that any doubt can be entertained. Nevertheless, very  grave doubt is entertained, and that by many, and probably by the  majority, of the leading professional astronomers and observers. In  fact, some observers of great ability, equipped with powerful  instruments, have directly contradicted the results of Schiaparelli and  his supporters.    The reader may ask: \"Why so readily accept Schiaparelli's conclusions  with regard to Mercury while rejecting them in the case of Venus?\"    The reply is twofold. In the first place the markings on Venus, although  Mr. Lowell sketched them with perfect confidence in 1896, are, by the  almost unanimous testimony of those who have searched for them with  telescopes, both large and small, extremely difficult to see,  indistinct in outline, and perhaps evanescent in character. The sketches  of no two observers agree, and often they are remarkably unlike. The  fact has already been mentioned that Mr. Lowell noticed a kind of veil  partially obscuring the markings, and which he ascribed, no doubt  correctly, to the planet's atmosphere. But he thinks that,  notwithstanding the atmospheric veil, the markings noted by him were  unquestionably permanent features of the planet's real surface.  Inasmuch, however, as his drawings represent things entirely different  from what others have seen, there seems to be weight in the suggestion  that the radiating bands and shadings noticed by him were in some manner  illusory, and perhaps of atmospheric origin.    If the markings were evidently of a permanent nature and attached to the  solid shell of the planet, and if they were of sufficient distinctness  to be seen in substantially the same form by all observers armed with  competent instruments, then whatever conclusion was drawn from their  apparent motion as to the period of the planet's rotation would have to  be accepted. In the case of Mercury the markings, while not easily seen,  appear to be sufficiently distinct to afford confidence in the result of  observations based upon them, but Venus's markings have been represented  in so many different ways that it seems advisable to await more light  before accepting any extraordinary, and in itself improbable, conclusion  based upon them.    It should also be added that in 1900 spectroscopic observations by  Belopolski at Pulkova gave evidence that Venus really rotates rapidly on  her axis, in a period probably approximating to the twenty-four hours of  the earth's rotation, thus corroborating the older conclusions.    Belopolski's observation, it may be remarked, was based upon what is  known as the Doppler principle, which is employed in measuring the  motion of stars in the line of sight, and in other cases of rapidly  moving sources of light. According to this principle, when a source of  light, either original or reflected, is approaching the observer, the  characteristic lines in its spectrum are shifted toward the blue end,  and when it is retreating from the observer the lines are shifted toward  the red end. Now, in the case of a planet rotating rapidly on its axis,  it is clear that if the observer is situated in, or nearly in, the plane  of the planet's equator, one edge of its disk will be approaching his  eye while the opposite edge is retreating, and the lines in the spectrum  of a beam of light from the advancing edge will be shifted toward the  blue, while those in the spectrum of the light coming from the  retreating edge will be shifted toward the red. And, by carefully noting  the amount of the shifting, the velocity of the planet's rotation can be  computed. This is what was done by Belopolski in the case of Venus, with  the result above noted.    Secondly, the theory that Venus rotates but once in the course of a  revolution finds but slight support from the doctrine of tidal friction,  as compared with that which it receives when applied to Mercury. The  effectiveness of the sun's attraction in slowing down the rotation of a  planet through the braking action of the tides raised in the body of the  planet while it is yet molten or plastic, varies inversely as the sixth  power of the planet's distance. For Mercury this effectiveness is nearly  three hundred times as great as it is for the earth, while for Venus it  is only seven times as great. While we may admit, then, that Mercury,  being relatively close to the sun and subject to an enormous braking  action, lost rotation until--as occurred for a similar reason to the  moon under the tidal attraction of the earth--it ended by keeping one  face always toward its master, we are not prepared to make the same  admission in the case of Venus, where the effective force concerned is  comparatively so slight.    It should be added, however, that no certain evidence of polar  compression in the outline of Venus's disk has ever been obtained, and  this fact would favor the theory of a very slow rotation because a  plastic globe in swift rotation has its equatorial diameter increased  and its polar diameter diminished. If Venus were as much flattened at  the poles as the earth is, it would seem that the fact could not escape  detection, yet the necessary observations are very difficult, and Venus  is so brilliant that her light increases the difficulty, while her  transits across the sun, when she can be seen as a round black disk, are  very rare phenomena, the latest having occurred in 1874 and 1882, and  the next not being due until 2004.    Upon the whole, probably the best method of settling the question of  Venus's rotation is the spectroscopic method, and that, as we saw, has  already given evidence for the short period.    Even if it were established that Venus keeps always the same face to the  sun, it might not be necessary to abandon altogether the belief that she  is habitable, although, of course, the obstacles to that belief would be  increased. Venus's orbit being so nearly circular, and her orbital  motion so nearly invariable, she has but a very slight libration with  reference to the sun, and the east and west lunes on her surface, where  day and night would alternate once in her year of 225 days, would be so  narrow as to be practically negligible.    But, owing to her extensive atmosphere, there would be a very broad band  of twilight on Venus, running entirely around the planet at the inner  edge of the light hemisphere. What the meteorological conditions within  this zone would be is purely a matter of conjecture. As in the case of  Mercury, we should expect an interchange of atmospheric currents between  the light and dark sides of the planet, the heated air rising under the  influence of the unsetting sun in one hemisphere, and being replaced by  an indraught of cold air from the other. The twilight band would  probably be the scene of atmospheric conflicts and storms, and of  immense precipitation, if there were oceans on the light hemisphere to  charge the air with moisture.    It has been suggested that ice and snow might be piled in a vast circle  of glaciers, belting the planet along the line between perpetual day  and night, and that where the sunbeams touched these icy deposits near  the edge of the light hemisphere a marvelous spectacle of prismatic  hills of crystal would be presented!    It may be remarked that it would be the inhabitants of the dark  hemisphere who would enjoy the beautiful scene of the earth and the moon  in opposition.          CHAPTER IV    MARS, A WORLD MORE ADVANCED THAN OURS      Mars is the fourth planet in the order of distance from the sun, and the  outermost member of the terrestrial group. Its mean distance is  141,500,000 miles, variable, through the eccentricity of its orbit, to  the extent of about 13,000,000 miles. It will be observed that this is  only a million miles less than the variation in Mercury's distance from  the sun, from which, in a previous chapter, were deduced most momentous  consequences; but, in the case of Mars, the ratio of the variation to  the mean distance is far smaller than with Mercury, so that the effect  upon the temperature of the planet is relatively insignificant.    Mars gets a little less than half as much solar light and heat as the  earth receives, its situation in this respect being just the opposite  to that of Venus. Its period of orbital revolution, or the length of its  year, is 687 of our days. The diameter of Mars is 4,200 miles, and its  density is 73 per cent of the earth's density. Gravity on its surface is  only 38 per cent of terrestrial gravity--i.e., a one hundred-pound  weight removed from the earth to Mars would there weigh but thirty-eight  pounds. Mars evidently has an atmosphere, the details of which we shall  discuss later.    The poles of the planet are inclined from a perpendicular to the plane  of its orbit at very nearly the same angle as that of the earth's poles,  viz., 24 deg. 50 min. Its rotation on its axis is also effected in  almost the same period as the earth's, viz., 24 hours, 37 minutes.    When in opposition to the sun, Mars may be only about 35,000,000 miles  from the earth, but its average distance when in that position is more  than 48,000,000 miles, and may be more than 60,000,000.
