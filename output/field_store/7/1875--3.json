Now when they saw the strangers, they went  all together, and clasped their hands in welcome, and would  have them sit down. First Peisistratus, son of Nestor, drew  nigh, and took the hands of each, and made them to sit down  at the feast on soft fleeces upon the sea sand, beside his  brother Thrasymedes and his father. And he gave them messes  of the inner meat, and poured wine into a golden cup, and  pledging her, he spake unto Pallas Athene, daughter of  Zeus, lord of the aegis:    'Pray now, my guest, to the lord Poseidon, even as it is  his feast whereon ye have chanced in coming hither. And  when thou hast made drink offering and prayed, as is due,  give thy friend also the cup of honeyed wine to make  offering thereof, inasmuch as he too, methinks, prayeth to  the deathless gods, for all men stand in need of the gods.  Howbeit he is younger and mine own equal in years,  therefore to thee first will I give the golden chalice.'    Therewith he placed in her hand the cup of sweet wine. And  Athene rejoiced in the wisdom and judgment of the man, in  that he had given to her first the chalice of gold. And  straightway she prayed, and that instantly, to the lord  Poseidon:    'Hear me, Poseidon, girdler of the earth, and grudge not  the fulfilment of this labour in answer to our prayer. To  Nestor first and to his sons vouchsafe renown, and  thereafter grant to all the people of Pylos a gracious  recompense for this splendid hecatomb. Grant moreover that  Telemachus and I may return, when we have accomplished that  for which we came hither with our swift black ship.'    Now as she prayed on this wise, herself the while was  fulfilling the prayer. And she gave Telemachus the fair  two-handled cup; and in like manner prayed the dear son of  Odysseus. Then, when the others had roasted the outer parts  and drawn them off the spits, they divided the messes and  shared the glorious feast. But when they had put from them  the desire of meat and drink, Nestor of Gerenia, lord of  chariots, first spake among them:    'Now is the better time to enquire and ask of the strangers  who they are, now that they have had their delight of food.  Strangers, who are ye? Whence sail ye over the wet ways? On  some trading enterprise, or at adventure do ye rove, even  as sea-robbers, over the brine, for they wander at hazard  of their own lives bringing bale to alien men?'    Then wise Telemachus answered him and spake with courage,  for Athene herself had put boldness in his heart, that he  might ask about his father who was afar, and that he might  be had in good report among men:    'Nestor, son of Neleus, great glory of the Achaeans, thou  askest whence we are, and I will surely tell thee all. We  have come forth out of Ithaca that is below Neion; and this  our quest whereof I speak is a matter of mine own, and not  of the common weal. I follow after the far-spread rumour of  my father, if haply I may hear thereof, even of the goodly  steadfast Odysseus, who upon a time, men say, fought by thy  side and sacked the city of the Trojans. For of all the  others, as many as warred with the Trojans, we hear  tidings, and where each one fell by a pitiful death; but  even the death of this man Cronion hath left untold. For  none can surely declare the place where he hath perished,  whether he was smitten by foemen on the mainland, or lost  upon the deep among the waves of Amphitrite. So now am I  come hither to thy knees, if perchance thou art willing to  tell me of his pitiful death, as one that saw it with thine  own eyes, or heard the story from some other wanderer,--  for his mother bare him to exceeding sorrow. And speak me  no soft words in ruth or pity, but tell me plainly what  sight thou didst get of him. Ah! I pray thee, if ever at  all my father, noble Odysseus, made promise to thee of word  or work, and fulfilled the same in the land of the Trojans,  where ye Achaeans suffered affliction; these things, I pray  thee, now remember and tell me truth.'    Then Nestor of Gerenia, lord of chariots, answered him: 'My  friend, since thou hast brought sorrow back to mind,  behold, this is the story of the woe which we endured in  that land, we sons of the Achaeans, unrestrained in fury,  and of all that we bore in wanderings after spoil, sailing  with our ships over the misty deep, wheresoever Achilles  led; and of all our war round the mighty burg of king  Priam. Yea and there the best of us were slain. There lies  valiant Aias, and there Achilles, and there Patroclus, the  peer of the gods in counsel, and there my own dear son,  strong and noble, Antilochus, that excelled in speed of  foot and in the fight. And many other ills we suffered  beside these; who of mortal men could tell the tale? Nay  none, though thou wert to abide here for five years, ay and  for six, and ask of all the ills which the goodly Achaeans  then endured. Ere all was told thou wouldst be weary and  turn to thine own country. For nine whole years we were  busy about them, devising their ruin with all manner of  craft; and scarce did Cronion bring it to pass. There never  a man durst match with him in wisdom, for goodly Odysseus  very far outdid the rest in all manner of craft, Odysseus  thy father, if indeed thou art his son,--amazement comes  upon me as I look at thee; for verily thy speech is like  unto his; none would say that a younger man would speak so  like an elder. Now look you, all the while that myself and  goodly Odysseus were there, we never spake diversely either  in the assembly or in the council, but always were of one  mind, and advised the Argives with understanding and sound  counsel, how all might be for the very best. But after we  had sacked the steep city of Priam, and had departed in our  ships, and a god had scattered the Achaeans, even then did  Zeus devise in his heart a pitiful returning for the  Argives, for in no wise were they all discreet or just.  Wherefore many of them met with an ill faring by reason of  the deadly wrath of the grey-eyed goddess, the daughter of  the mighty sire, who set debate between the two sons of  Atreus. And they twain called to the gathering of the host  all the Achaeans, recklessly and out of order, against the  going down of the sun; and lo, the sons of the Achaeans  came heavy with wine. And the Atreidae spake out and told  the reason wherefore they had assembled the host. Then  verily Menelaus charged all the Achaeans to bethink them of  returning over the broad back of the sea, but in no sort  did he please Agamemnon, whose desire was to keep back the  host and to offer holy hecatombs, that so he might appease  that dread wrath of Athene. Fool! for he knew not this,  that she was never to be won; for the mind of the  everlasting gods is not lightly turned to repentance. So  these twain stood bandying hard words; but the  goodly-greaved Achaeans sprang up with a wondrous din, and  twofold counsels found favour among them. So that one night  we rested, thinking hard things against each other, for  Zeus was fashioning for us a ruinous doom. But in the  morning, we of the one part drew our ships to the fair salt  sea, and put aboard our wealth, and the low-girdled Trojan  women. Now one half the people abode steadfastly there with  Agamemnon, son of Atreus, shepherd of the host; and half of  us embarked and drave to sea and swiftly the ships sailed,  for a god made smooth the sea with the depths thereof. And  when we came to Tenedos, we did sacrifice to the gods,  being eager for the homeward way; but Zeus did not yet  purpose our returning, nay, hard was he, that roused once  more an evil strife among us. Then some turned back their  curved ships, and went their way, even the company of  Odysseus, the wise and manifold in counsel, once again  showing a favour to Agamemnon, son of Atreus. But I fled on  with the squadron that followed me, for I knew how now the  god imagined mischief. And the warlike son of Tydeus fled  and roused his men thereto. And late in our track came  Menelaus of the fair hair, who found us in Lesbos,  considering about the long voyage, whether we should go  sea-ward of craggy Chios, by the isle of Psyria, keeping  the isle upon our left, or inside Chios past windy Mimas.  So we asked the god to show us a sign, and a sign he  declared to us, and bade us cleave a path across the middle  sea to Euboea, that we might flee the swiftest way from  sorrow. And a shrill wind arose and blew, and the ships ran  most fleetly over the teeming ways, and in the night they  touched at Geraestus. So there we sacrificed many thighs of  bulls to Poseidon, for joy that we had measured out so  great a stretch of sea. It was the fourth day when the  company of Diomede son of Tydeus, tamer of horses, moored  their gallant ships at Argos; but I held on for Pylos, and  the breeze was never quenched from the hour that the god  sent it forth to blow. Even so I came, dear child, without  tidings, nor know I aught of those others, which of the  Achaeans were saved and which were lost. But all that I  hear tell of as I sit in our halls, thou shalt learn as it  is meet, and I will hide nothing from thee. Safely, they  say, came the Myrmidons the wild spearsmen, whom the famous  son of high-souled Achilles led; and safely Philoctetes,  the glorious son of Poias. And Idomeneus brought all his  company to Crete, all that escaped the war, and from him  the sea gat none. And of the son of Atreus even yourselves  have heard, far apart though ye dwell, how he came, and how  Aegisthus devised his evil end; but verily he himself paid  a terrible reckoning. So good a thing it is that a son of  the dead should still be left, even as that son also took  vengeance on the slayer of his father, guileful Aegisthus,  who slew his famous sire. And thou too, my friend, for I  see thee very comely and tall, be valiant, that even men  unborn may praise thee.'    And wise Telemachus answered him, and said: 'Nest"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17280"],[0,"Anthropology (#10)"],[1,"thing to arrive at for  purposes of comparison than one might suppose. Since no part of the  skull maintains a stable position in regard to the rest, there can  be no fixed standard of measurement, but at most a judgment of likeness  or unlikeness founded on an averaging of the total proportions. Thus  it comes about that, in the last resort, the impression of a good expert  is worth in these matters a great deal more than rows of figures.  Moreover, rows of figures in their turn take a lot of understanding.  Besides, they are not always easy to get. This is especially the case  if you are measuring a live subject. Perhaps he is armed with a club,  and may take amiss the use of an instrument that has to be poked into  his ears, or what not. So, for one reason or another, we have often  to put up with that very unsatisfactory single-figure description of  the head-form which is known as the cranial index. You take the greatest  length and greatest breadth of the skull, and write down the result  obtained by dividing the former into the latter when multiplied by  100. Medium-headed people have an index of anything between 75 and  80. Below that figure men rank as long-headed, above it as round-headed.  This test, however, as I have hinted, will not by itself carry us far.  On the other hand, I believe that a good judge of head-form in all  its aspects taken together will generally be able to make a pretty  shrewd guess as to the people amongst whom the owner of a given skull  is to be placed.    Unfortunately, to say people is not to say race. It may be that a given  people tend to have a characteristic head-form, not so much because  they are of common breed, as because they are subjected after birth,  or at any rate, after conception, to one and the same environment.  Thus some careful observations made recently by Professor Boas on  American immigrants from various parts of Europe seem to show that  the new environment does in some unexplained way modify the head-form  to a remarkable extent. For example, amongst the East European Jews  the head of the European-born is shorter and wider than that of the  American-born, the difference being even more marked in the second  generation of the American-born. At the same time, other European  nationalities exhibit changes of other kinds, all these changes,  however, being in the direction of a convergence towards one and the  same American type. How are we to explain these facts, supposing them  to be corroborated by more extensive studies? It would seem that we  must at any rate allow for a considerable plasticity in the head-form,  whereby it is capable of undergoing decisive alteration under the  influences of environment; not, of course, at any moment during life,  but during those early days when the growth of the head is especially  rapid. The further question whether such an acquired character can  be transmitted we need not raise again. Before passing on, however,  let this one word to the wise be uttered. If the skull can be so affected,  then what about the brain inside it? If the hereditarily long-headed  can change under suitable conditions, then what about the hereditarily  short-witted?    It remains to say a word about the types of pre-historic men as judged  by their bony remains and especially by their skulls. Naturally the  subject bristles with uncertainties.    By itself stands the so-called Pithecanthropus (Ape-man) of Java, a  regular \"missing link.\" The top of the skull, several teeth, and a  thigh-bone, found at a certain distance from each other, are all that  we have of it or him. Dr. Dubois, their discoverer, has made out a  fairly strong case for supposing that the geological stratum in which  the remains occurred is Pliocene--that is to say, belongs to the  Tertiary epoch, to which man has not yet been traced back with any  strong probability. It must remain, however, highly doubtful whether  this is a proto-human being, or merely an ape of a type related to  the gibbon. The intermediate character is shown especially in the head  form. If an ape, Pithecanthropus had an enormous brain; if a man, he  must have verged on what we should consider idiocy.    Also standing somewhat by itself is the Heidelberg man. All that we  have of him is a well-preserved lower jaw with its teeth. It was found  more than eighty feet below the surface of the soil, in company with  animal remains that make it possible to fix its position in the scale  of pre-historic periods with some accuracy. Judged by this test, it  is as old as the oldest of the unmistakable drift implements, the  so-called Chellean (from Chelles in the department of Seine-et-Marne  in France). The jaw by itself would suggest a gorilla, being both  chinless and immensely powerful. The teeth, however, are human beyond  question, and can be matched, or perhaps even in respect to certain  marks of primitiveness out-matched, amongst ancient skulls of the  Neanderthal order, if not also amongst modern ones from Australia.    We may next consider the Neanderthal group of skulls, so named after  the first of that type found in 1856 in the Neanderthal valley close  to Dusseldorf in the Rhine basin. A narrow head, with low and retreating  forehead, and a thick projecting brow-ridge, yet with at least twice  the brain capacity of any gorilla, set the learned world disputing  whether this was an ape, a normal man, or an idiot. It was unfortunate  that there were no proofs to hand of the age of these relics. After  a while, however, similar specimens began to come in. Thus in 1866  the jaw of a woman, displaying a tendency to chinlessness combined  with great strength, was found in the Cave of La Naulette in Belgium,  associated with more or less dateable remains of the mammoth, woolly  rhinoceros and reindeer. A few years earlier, though its importance  was not appreciated at the moment, there had been discovered, near  Forbes' quarry at Gibraltar, the famous Gibraltar skull, now to be  seen in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons in London. Any  visitor will notice at the first glance that this is no man of to-day.  There are the narrow head, low crown, and prominent brow-ridge as  before, supplemented by the most extraordinary eye-holes that were  ever seen, vast circles widely separated from each other. And other  peculiar features will reveal themselves on a close inspection; for  instance, the horseshoe form in which, ape-fashion, the teeth are  arranged, and the muzzle-like shape of the face due to the absence  of the depressions that in our own case run down on each side from  just outside the nostrils towards the corners of the mouth.    And now at the present time we have twenty or more individuals of this  Neanderthal type to compare. The latest discoveries are perhaps the  most interesting, because in two and perhaps other cases the man has  been properly buried. Thus at La Chapelle-aux-Saints, in the French  department of Correze, a skeleton, which in its head-form closely  recalls the Gibraltar example, was found in a pit dug in the floor  of a low grotto. It lay on its back, head to the west, with one arm  bent towards the head, the other outstretched, and the legs drawn up.  Some bison bones lay in the grave as if a food-offering had been made.  Hard by were flint implements of a well-marked Mousterian type. In  the shelter of Le Moustier itself a similar burial was discovered.  The body lay on its right side, with the right arm bent so as to support  the head upon a carefully arranged pillow of flints; whilst the left  arm was stretched out, so that the hand might be near a magnificent  oval stone-weapon chipped on both faces, evidently laid there by design.  So much for these men of the Neanderthal type, denizens of the  mid-palaeolithic world at the very latest. Ape-like they doubtless  are in their head-form up to a certain point, though almost all their  separate features occur here and there amongst modern Australian  natives. And yet they were men enough, had brains enough, to believe  in a life after death. There is something to think about in that.    Without going outside Europe, we have, however, to reckon with at least  two other types of very early head-form.    In one of the caves of Mentone known as La Grotte des Enfants two  skeletons from a low stratum were of a primitive type, but unlike the  Neanderthal, and have been thought to show affinities to the modern  negro. As, however, no other Proto-Negroes are indisputably  forthcoming either from Europe or from any other part of the world,  there is little at present to be made out about this interesting racial  type.    In the layer immediately above the negroid remains, however, as well  as in other caves at Mentone, were the bones of individuals of quite  another order, one being positively a giant. They are known as the  Cro-Magnon race, after a group of them discovered in a rock shelter  of that name on the banks of the Vezere. These particular people can  be shown to be Aurignacian--that is to say, to have lived just after  the Mousterian men of the Neanderthal head-form. If, however, as has  been already suggested, the Galley Hill individual, who shows  affinities to the Cro-Magnon type, really goes back to the drift-period,  then we can believe that from very early times there co-existed in  Europe at least two varieties; and these so distinct, that some  authorities would trace the original divergence between them right  back to the times before man and the apes had parted company, linking  the Neanderthal race with the gorilla and the Cro-Magnon race with  the orang. The Cro-Magnon head-form is refined and highly developed.  The forehead is high, and the chin shapely, whilst neither the  brow-ridge nor the lower jaw protrudes as in the Neanderthal type.  Whether this race survives in modern Europe is, as was said in the  last chapter, highly uncertain. In certain respects--for instance,  in a"]]]
