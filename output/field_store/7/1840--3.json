Presently I heard a long \"hee-haw,  hee-haw,\" and I knew Balaam had rested and had started.    I have been a very busy woman since I began this letter to you several  days ago. A dear little child has joined the angels. I dressed him and  helped to make his casket. There is no minister in this whole country  and I could not bear the little broken lily-bud to be just carted away  and buried, so I arranged the funeral and conducted the services.

I know the message  of God's love and care has been told once, anyway, to people who have  learned to believe more strongly in hell than in heaven.    Dear friend, I do hope that this New Year will bring you and yours  fuller joys than you have ever known. If I had all the good gifts in my  hands you should certainly be blessed.

CONEY,--    It was just a few days after the birthday party and Mrs. O'Shaughnessy  was with me again. We were down at the barn looking at some new pigs,  when we heard the big corral gates swing shut, so we hastened out to  see who it could be so late in the day.    It was Zebbie. He had come on the stage to Burnt Fork and the driver  had brought him on here.... There was so much to tell, and he whispered  he had something to tell me privately, but that he was too tired then;  so after supper I hustled him off to bed....    Next morning ... the men went off to their work and Zebbie and I were  left to tell secrets. When he was sure we were alone he took from his  trunk a long, flat box. Inside was the most wonderful shirt I have  ever seen; it looked like a cross between a nightshirt and a  shirt-waist. It was of homespun linen. The bosom was ruffled and  tucked, all done by hand,--such tiny stitches, such patience and skill.  Then he handed me an old daguerreotype. I unfastened the little golden  hook and inside was a face good to see and to remember. It was dim, yet  clear in outline, just as if she were looking out from the mellow  twilight of long ago. The sweet, elusive smile,--I couldn't tell where  it was, whether it was the mouth or the beautiful eyes that were  smiling. All that was visible of her dress was the Dutch collar, just  like what is being worn now. It was pinned with an ugly old brooch  which Zebbie said was a \"breast-pin\" he had given her. Under the glass  on the other side was a strand of faded hair and a slip of paper. The  writing on the paper was so faded it was scarcely readable, but it  said: \"Pauline Gorley, age 22, 1860.\"    Next he showed me a note written by Pauline, simply worded, but it held  a world of meaning for Zebbie. It said, \"I spun and wove this cloth at  Adeline's, enough for me a dress and you a shirt, which I made. It is  for the wedding, else to be buried in. Yours, Pauline.\" The shirt, the  picture, and the note had waited for him all these years in Mothie's  care. And now I will tell you the story.    Long, long ago some one did something to some one else and started a  feud. Unfortunately the Gorleys were on one side and the Parkers on the  other. That it all happened before either Zebbie or Pauline was born  made no difference. A Gorley must hate a Parker always, as also a  Parker must hate a Gorley. Pauline was the only girl, and she had a  regiment of big brothers who gloried in the warfare and wanted only the  slightest pretext to shoot a Parker. So they grew up, and Zebbie often  met Pauline at the quiltings and other gatherings at the homes of  non-partisans. He remembers her so perfectly and describes her so  plainly that I can picture her easily. She had brown eyes and hair. She  used to ride about on her sorrel palfrey with her \"nigger\" boy Caesar on  behind to open and shut plantation gates. She wore a pink calico  sunbonnet, and Zebbie says \"she was just like the pink hollyhocks that  grew by mother's window.\" Isn't that a sweet picture?    Her mother and father were both dead, and she and her brothers lived on  their plantation. Zebbie had never dared speak to her until one day he  had driven over with his mother and sisters to a dinner given on a  neighboring plantation. He was standing outside near the wall, when  some one dropped a spray of apple blossoms down upon him from an upper  window. He looked up and Pauline was leaning out smiling at him. After  that he made it a point to frequent places where he might expect her,  and things went so well that presently Caesar was left at home lest he  should tell the brothers. She was a loyal little soul and would not  desert, although he urged her to, even promising to go away, \"plumb  away, clean to Scott County if she would go.\" She told him that her  brothers would go even as far as that to kill him, so that they must  wait and hope. Finally Zebbie got tired of waiting, and one day he  boldly rode up to the Gorley home and formally asked for Pauline's  hand. The bullet he got for his presumption kept him from going to the  war with his father and brother when they marched away.    Some time later George Gorley was shot and killed from ambush, and  although Zebbie had not yet left his bed the Gorleys believed he did  it, and one night Pauline came through a heavy rainstorm, with only  Caesar, to warn Zebbie and to beg him, for her sake, to get away as fast  as he could that night. She pleaded that she could not live if he were  killed and could never marry him if he killed her brothers, so she  persuaded him to go while they were all innocent.    Well, he did as she wished and they never saw each other again. He  never went home again until last Thanksgiving, and dear little Pauline  had been dead for years. She herself had taken her little gifts for  Zebbie to Mothie to keep for him. Some years later she died and was  buried in the dress she mentioned. It was woven at Adeline Carter's,  one of the bitterest enemies of the Gorleys, but the sacrifice of her  pride did her no good because she was long at rest before Zebbie knew.  He had been greatly grieved because no stone marked her grave, only a  tangle of rose-briers. So he bought a stone, and in the night before  Decoration Day he and two of Uncle Buck's grandsons went to the Gorley  burying-ground and raised it to the memory of sweet Pauline. Some of  the Gorleys still live there, so he came home at once, fearing if they  should find out who placed the stone above their sister they would take  vengeance on his poor, frail body.    After he had finished telling me his story, I felt just as I used to  when Grandmother opened the \"big chist\" to air her wedding clothes and  the dress each of her babies wore when baptized. It seemed almost like  smelling the lavender and rose-leaves, and it was with reverent fingers  that I folded the shirt, the work of love, yellow with age, and laid it  in the box....    Well, Mrs. O'Shaughnessy returned, and early one morning we started  with a wagon and a bulging mess-box for Zebbie's home. We were going a  new and longer route in order to take the wagon. Dandelions spread a  carpet of gold. Larkspur grew waist-high with its long spikes of blue.  The service-bushes and the wild cherries were a mass of white beauty.  Meadowlarks and robins and bluebirds twittered and sang from every  branch, it almost seemed. A sky of tenderest blue bent over us and  fleecy little clouds drifted lazily across.... Soon we came to the  pineries, where we traveled up deep gorges and canons. The sun shot  arrows of gold through the pines down upon us and we gathered our arms  full of columbines. The little black squirrels barked and chattered  saucily as we passed along, and we were all children together. We  forgot all about feuds and partings, death and hard times. All we  remembered was that God is good and the world is wide and beautiful. We  plodded along all day. Next morning there was a blue haze that Zebbie  said meant there would be a high wind, so we hurried to reach his home  that evening.    The sun was hanging like a great red ball in the smoky haze when we  entered the long canon in which is Zebbie's cabin. Already it was dusky  in the canons below, but not a breath of air stirred. A more delighted  man than Zebbie I never saw when we finally drove up to his low,  comfortable cabin. Smoke was slowly rising from the chimney, and  Gavotte, the man in charge, rushed out and the hounds set up a joyful  barking. Gavotte is a Frenchman, and he was all smiles and  gesticulations as he said, \"Welcome, welcome! To-day I am rejoice you  have come. Yesterday I am despair if you have come because I am scrub,  but to-day, behold, I am delight.\"    I have heard of clean people, but Gavotte is the cleanest man I ever  saw. The cabin floor was so white I hated to step upon it. The windows  shone, and at each there was a calico curtain, blue-and-white check,  unironed but newly washed. In one window was an old brown pitcher,  cracked and nicked, filled with thistles. I never thought them pretty  before, but the pearly pink and the silvery green were so pretty and  looked so clean that they had a new beauty. Above the fireplace was a  great black eagle which Gavotte had killed, the wings outspread and a  bunch of arrows in the claws. In one corner near the fire was a  washstand, and behind it hung the fishing-tackle. Above one door was a  gun-rack, on which lay the rifle and shotgun, and over the other door  was a pair of deer-antlers. In the center of the room stood the square  home-made table, every inch scrubbed. In the side room, which is the  bedroom, was a wide bunk made of pine plank that had also been  scrubbed, then filled with fresh, sweet pine boughs, and over them was  spread a piece of canvas"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16643"],[0,"Essays (#10)"],[1,"bold  holiday, and to shake itself free of the old laws,--this back-stroke,  this kick of the gun, certifying that the law is fatal; that in nature  nothing can be given, all things are sold.    This is that ancient doctrine of Nemesis,[120] who keeps watch in the  universe, and lets no offense go unchastised. The Furies,[121] they  said, are attendants on justice, and if the sun in heaven should  transgress his path, they would punish him. The poets related that  stone walls, and iron swords, and leathern thongs had an occult  sympathy with the wrongs of their owners; that the belt which Ajax  gave Hector[122] dragged the Trojan hero over the field at the wheels  of the car of Achilles, and the sword which Hector gave Ajax was that  on whose point Ajax fell. They recorded, that when the Thasians[123]  erected a statue to Theagenes, a victor in the games, one of his  rivals went to it by night, and endeavored to throw it down by  repeated blows, until at last he moved it from its pedestal, and was  crushed to death beneath its fall.    This voice of fable has in it somewhat divine. It came from thought  above the will of the writer. That is the best part of each writer,  which has nothing private in it;[124] that which he does not know,  that which flowed out of his constitution, and not from his too  active invention; that which in the study of a single artist you might  not easily find, but in the study of many, you would abstract as the  spirit of them all. Phidias it is not, but the work of man in that  early Hellenic[125] world, that I would know. The name and  circumstance of Phidias, however convenient for history, embarrass  when we come to the highest criticism. We are to see that which man  was tending to do in a given period, and was hindered, or, if you  will, modified in doing, by the interfering volitions of Phidias, of  Dante, of Shakespeare, the organ whereby man at the moment wrought.    Still more striking is the expression of this fact in the proverbs of  all nations, which are always the literature of reason, or the  statements of an absolute truth, without qualification. Proverbs, like  the sacred books of each nation, are the sanctuary of the intuitions.  That which the droning world, chained to appearances, will not allow  the realist to say in his own words, it will suffer him to say in  proverbs without contradiction. And this law of laws which the pulpit,  the senate, and the college deny, is hourly preached in all markets  and workshops by flights of proverbs, whose teaching is as true and as  omnipresent as that of birds and flies.    All things are double, one against another.--Tit for tat;[126] an eye  for an eye; a tooth for a tooth; blood for blood; measure for measure;  love for love.--Give and it shall be given you.--- He that watereth  shall be watered himself.--What will you have? quoth God; pay for it  and take it.--Nothing venture, nothing have.--Thou shalt be paid  exactly for what thou hast done, no more, no less.--Who doth not work  shall not eat.--Harm watch, harm catch.--Curses always recoil on the  head of him who imprecates them.--If you put a chain around the neck  of a slave, the other end fastens itself around your own.--Bad counsel  confounds the adviser.--The Devil is an ass.    It is thus written, because it is thus in life. Our action is  overmastered and characterized above our will by the law of nature. We  aim at a petty end quite aside from the public good, but our act  arranges itself by irresistible magnetism in a line with the poles of  the world.    A man cannot speak but he judges himself. With his will, or against  his will, he draws his portrait to the eye of his companions by every  word. Every opinion reacts on him who utters it. It is a thread-ball  thrown at a mark, but the other end remains in the thrower's bag. Or,  rather, it is a harpoon hurled at the whale, unwinding, as it flies, a  coil of cord in the boat, and if the harpoon is not good, or not well  thrown, it will go nigh to cut the steersman in twain, or to sink the  boat.    You cannot do wrong without suffering wrong. \"No man had ever a point  of pride that was not injurious to him,\" said Burke.[127] The  exclusive in fashionable life does not see that he excludes himself  from enjoyment in the attempt to appropriate it. The exclusionist in  religion does not see that he shuts the door of heaven on himself, in  striving to shut out others. Treat men as pawns[128] and ninepins, and  you shall suffer as well as they. If you leave out their heart, you  shall lose your own. The senses would make things of all persons; of  women, of children, of the poor. The vulgar proverb, \"I will get it  from his purse or get it from his skin,\" is sound philosophy.    All infractions of love and equity in our social relations are  speedily punished. They are punished by fear. Whilst I stand in simple  relations to my fellow-man, I have no displeasure in meeting him. We  meet as water meets water, or as two currents of air mix, with perfect  diffusion and interpenetration of nature. But as soon as there is any  departure from simplicity, and attempt at halfness, or good for me  that is not good for him, my neighbor feels the wrong; he shrinks from  me as far as I have shrunk from him; his eyes no longer seek mine;  there is war between us; there is hate in him and fear in me.    All the old abuses in society, universal and particular, all unjust  accumulations of property and power, are avenged in the same manner.  Fear is an instructor of great sagacity, and the herald of all  revolutions. One thing he teaches, that there is rottenness where he  appears. He is a carrion crow, and though you see not well what he  hovers for, there is death somewhere. Our property is timid, our laws  are timid, our cultivated classes are timid. Fear for ages has boded  and mowed and gibbered over government and property. That obscene[129]  bird is not there for nothing. He indicates great wrongs which must be  revised.    Of the like nature is that expectation of change which instantly  follows the suspension of our voluntary activity. The terror of  cloudless noon, the emerald of Polycrates,[130] the awe of prosperity,  the instinct which leads every generous soul to impose on itself tasks  of a noble asceticism and vicarious virtue, are the tremblings of the  balance of justice through the heart and mind of man.    Experienced men of the world know very well that it is best to pay  scot and lot[131] as they go along, and that a man often pays dear for  a small frugality. The borrower runs in his own debt. Has a man gained  anything who has received a hundred favors and rendered none? Has he  gained by borrowing, through indolence or cunning, his neighbor's  wares, or horses, or money? There arises on the deed the instant  acknowledgment of benefit on the one part, and of debt on the other;  that is, of superiority and inferiority. The transaction remains in  the memory of himself and his neighbor; and every new transaction  alters, according to its nature, their relation to each other. He may  soon come to see that he had better have broken his own bones than to  have ridden in his neighbor's coach, and that \"the highest price he  can pay for a thing is to ask for it.\"    A wise man will extend this lesson to all parts of life, and know that  it is the part of prudence to face every claimant, and pay every just  demand on your time, your talents, or your heart. Always pay; for,  first or last, you must pay your entire debt. Persons and events may  stand for a time between you and justice, but it is only a  postponement. You must pay at last your own debt. If you are wise, you  will dread a prosperity which only loads you with more. Benefit is the  end of nature. But for every benefit which you receive, a tax is  levied. He is great who confers the most benefits. He is base--and  that is the one base thing in the universe--to receive favors and  render none. In the order of nature we cannot render benefits to those  from whom we receive them, or only seldom.[132] But the benefit we  receive must be rendered again, line for line, deed for deed, cent for  cent, to somebody. Beware of too much good staying in your hand. It  will fast corrupt and worm worms.[133] Pay it away quickly in some  sort.    Labor is watched over by the same pitiless laws. Cheapest, say the  prudent, is the dearest labor. What we buy in a broom, a mat, a wagon,  a knife, is some application of good sense to a common want. It is  best to pay in your land a skillful gardener, or to buy good sense  applied to gardening; in your sailor, good sense applied to  navigation; in the house, good sense applied to cooking, sewing,  serving; in your agent, good sense applied to accounts and affairs.  So do you multiply your presence, or spread yourself throughout your  estate. But because of the dual constitution of things, in labor as in  life there can be no cheating. The thief steals from himself. The  swindler swindles himself. For the real price of labor is knowledge  and virtue, whereof wealth and credit are signs. These signs, like  paper money, may be counterfeited or stolen, but that which they  represent, namely, knowledge and virtue, cannot be counterfeited or  stolen. These ends of labor cannot be answered but by real exertions  of the mind, and in obedience to pure motives. The cheat, the  defaulter, the gambler, cannot extort the knowledge of material and  moral nature which his honest care and pains yield to the operative.  The law of nature is, Do the thing, and you shall have the power: but  they who do not the thing have not the power.    Human labor, through all its forms, from the sharpening of a stake to  the construction of a city or an epic, is one immense illustration of  the perfect compensation of the universe. The absolute balance of Give  and Take, the doctrine that everything has its price,--and if that  price is not paid,"]]]
