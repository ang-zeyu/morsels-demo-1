Yet in a  week or two this swift, alert, winged creature is developed from the  degraded maggot, white, legless, headless, that buries itself in putrid  flesh, 'feeding on corruption.'    The broad end of the maggot is the tail, while the narrow extremity  marks the position of the mouth. Above this are a pair of very short  feelers (fig. 21 _c_), while from the aperture project the tips of the  mouth-hooks (fig. 21 _e_, _f_), formidable, black, claw-like structures,  articulated to the strong pharyngeal sclerites and moved by powerful  muscles, tearing up the fibres of the flesh. On either side of the  prothorax is an anterior spiracle, a curious branching or fan-like  outgrowth (fig. 21 _b_), with a variable number of tiny openings which  are probably of little use for the admission of air to the tubes. In  many maggots the mouth-hooks and the front spiracles become more and  more complex in form in the successive instars. The cuticle, white and  smooth to the unaided eye, is seen on microscopic study to be set with  rows of tiny spines which assist the maggot's movements through its  food-mass. At the tail-end the large hind spiracles are conspicuous on a  flattened dorsal area of the ninth abdominal segment; each shows a hard  brown plate, traversed by three slits. And as we watch this curious  degraded larva thrusting its narrow head-end into the depths of its  ofttimes loathsome food-supply, we understand the advantage of access to  the air-tube system being mainly confined to the hinder end of the body.    Maggots, differing from that of the Bluebottle only in minor details,  are the larval forms of a vast multitude of allied species and display  great variation in the nature of their food. Most, however, hide their  soft defenceless bodies in some substance which affords shelter as well  as food. The Bluebottle maggot burrows into flesh, that of the House-fly  into horse-dung or vegetable refuse. The maggot of the Cabbage-fly eats  its way into the roots of cruciferous plants, that of the Mangel-fly  works out a broad blister between the two skins of a leaf, into which  the newly-hatched larva crawls directly from the egg. A large number of  species, forming an entire subfamily (the Tachininae) have larvae that  feed as parasites within the bodies of other insects.    The habit of parasitism by maggots in back-boned animals has led to some  remarkable modifications of the larva and to curious adventures in the  course of the life-story. The Bot-fly of the Horse (_Gastrophilus equi_)  and the Warble-fly of the Ox (_Hypoderma bovis_, fig. 22) lay eggs  attached to the hairs of grazing animals, which, at least in the case of  Gastrophilus, lick the newly-hatched larvae into their mouths. The  'bot,' or maggot of Gastrophilus, comes to rest in the horse's stomach;  often a whole family attach themselves by their mouth-hooks to a small  patch of the mucous coat of that organ. The maggot is relatively short  and stout, with rows of strong spicules surrounding the segments, and  with spiracles capable of withdrawal through a cup-like inpushing of the  tail-region of the body, so that the parasite is preserved from drowning  when the host drinks water. The young maggot of Hypoderma (fig. 22 _e_)  is elongate and slender, spends its first two stages burrowing in the  gullet wall and then wandering through the dorsal tissues of its host;  ultimately it arrives beneath the skin of the back and assumes for its  third and fourth instars a broad barrel-like form (fig. 22 _b_). The  supply of free oxygen within the ox's tissues being now insufficient,  the warble-maggot bores a circular hole through the skin and rests with  the tail spiracles directed upwards towards the outer air. When fully  grown the maggot works its way through the hole in the host's skin, and  falling to the ground pupates in some sheltered spot, the life cycle  occupying about a year. Similarly the Horse-bot escapes from the host's  intestine with the excrement, and pupates on the ground.    A curious modification of the maggot is noticeable in the larva of the  Hover-flies (Syrphus). These, unlike most of their allies, live exposed  on the foliage of plants, where they feed by preying on aphids.    [Illustration: Fig. 22.

Magnified (lines show natural size). _a-d_, after Theobald, _2nd  Report Econ. Zool._ (_Brit. Mus._).]    In agreement with this manner of life, the cuticle is roughly  granulated, often greenish or reddish in hue, and the maggot, despite  its want of definite head and sense organs, moves actively and  purposefully about, often rearing up on its broad tail-end with an aphid  victim impaled on its mouth-hooks.    In a previous chapter reference was made to the exopterygote insects,  stone-flies, dragon-flies, and may-flies, whose preparatory stages live  in the water. Among the endopterygote orders many Neuroptera and  Coleoptera, all Trichoptera, a very few Lepidoptera and many Diptera,  have aquatic larvae. One or two examples of the adaptations of dipteran  larvae to life in the water may well bring the present chapter to a  close. Many members of the hover-fly family (Syrphidae) have maggots  with the tail-spiracles situated at the end of a prominent tubular  process. Among the best-known of syrphid flies are the drone-flies  (Eristalis), often seen hovering over flowers, and presenting a curious  likeness to hairy bees. The larva of Eristalis is one of the most  remarkable in the whole order, the 'Rat-tailed maggot' found in the  stagnant water of ditches and pools. It has a cylindrical body with the  hinder end drawn out into a long telescopic tube, a more slender  terminal section being capable of withdrawal into, or protrusion from, a  thicker basal portion. At the extremity of the slender tube is a crown  of sharp processes, forming a stellate guard to the spiracles. These  processes can pierce the surface-film of the water, and place the  tracheal system of the maggot in touch with the pure upper air; while  its mouth may be far down, feeding among the foul refuse of the ditch,  it can still reach out to the medium in which the end of its life-story  must be wrought out.    Reverting to the first great division of the Diptera, we find varied  adaptations to aquatic life among many grubs that possess a definite  head. The larva of a Gnat (Culex[9]) has projecting from the hind region  of the abdomen a long tubular outgrowth, at the end of which are the  spiracles, guarded by three pointed flaps forming a valve. When closed  these pierce the surface-film of the water in which the larva lives;  when opened a little cup-like depression is formed in the surface-film,  from which the larva hangs. Or having accumulated a supply of air, it  can disengage itself from the surface-film and dive through the water,  its tracheal system safely closed. Another mode of breathing is found in  the 'Blood-worms' and allied larvae of the Harlequin-midges  (Chironomidae) whose transformations are described in detail by Miall  and Hammond (1900). These larvae have two pairs of cylindrical,  spine-bearing pro-legs--one on the prothorax and the other on the  hindmost abdominal segment; the latter structures serve to fix the  larva in the muddy tube which it inhabits at the bottom of its native  pond. The penultimate abdominal segment has four long hollow outgrowths,  which contain blood, and have the function of gills, while the hindmost  segment has four shorter outgrowths of the same nature. Enabled thus to  breathe dissolved air, the Chironomus larva needs not, like the Culex or  the Eristalis, to find contact with the atmosphere beyond the  surface-film.    [9] See _Frontispiece_, A.    Most remarkable, in many respects, of all aquatic larvae are the grubs  of the Sand-midges (Simulium). These live entirely submerged and, having  no special gills, carry out an exchange of gases through the general  surface of the cuticle between the dissolved air in the water and the  cavities of the air-tube system. The body is shaped like a flask swollen  slightly at the hinder end and possesses a median pro-leg just behind  the head, also another at the tail, which serves to attach the larva to  a stone or to the leaf of an aquatic plant. The head has, in addition to  feelers and jaws, a pair of processes with wonderful fringes which by  their motion set up currents in the water, and bring food particles  within reach of the mouth. A number of the larvae usually live in a  community. Their power of spinning silken threads by which they can work  their way back when accidentally dislodged from their resting-place, has  been vividly described by Miall (1895).    Examples might be multiplied, but enough have been given to enforce the  conclusion that the forms of insect-larvae are wondrously varied, and  that frequently, within the limits of the same order or even family,  modifications of type may be found which are suited to various modes of  life adopted by different insects. A survey of the multitudes of insect  larvae--grubs, caterpillars, maggots--living on land, on plants,  underground, in the water; feeding on leaves, in stems, on roots, on  carrion, on refuse; by hunting or by lurking after prey; as parasites or  as scavengers, brings home to us most strongly the conclusion that each  larva is fitted to some "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16435"],[0,"The Atlantic Book of Modern Plays (#10)"],[1,"factories, secret  diplomacy--\"    WHITE. Don't you see that's all dead wood?    HILDA (_not heeding him_). This part gave me new strength when I  thought of Wallace. (_Reading with eloquence_) \"War will stop when  young men put Internationalism above Nationality, the law of God  above the dictates of statesmen, the law of love above the law of  hate, the law of self-sacrifice above the law of profit. There  must be no boundaries in man's thought.

And I made you believe it! What silly  prophets we radicals were. (_He tears it up._) Mere scraps of  paper, dear; scraps of paper, now.    HILDA. But it was the truth; it still is the truth.    WHITE. Hilda, there's something I want to talk over very, very  seriously with you. I've been putting it off.    HILDA. Yes, dear? (_The outer door is heard to bang._) Listen:  wasn't that the front door?    WHITE. Perhaps it's the maid?    HILDA (_a bit nervously_). No: she's upstairs. No one rang. Please  see.    WHITE (_smiling_). Now don't worry! It can't possibly be the Secret  Service.    HILDA. One never knows in war times what to expect. I sometimes  feel I am in a foreign country.    (WHITE _goes slowly to the door in back and opens it._ WALLACE,  _their son, with valise in hand, is standing there, as if he had  hesitated to enter._    _He is a fine clean-cut young fellow, with his father's physical  endowment and his mother's spiritual intensity. The essential  note he strikes is that of honesty. It is apparent he is under  the pressure of a momentous decision which has brought him  unexpectedly home from college._)    WHITE. Wallace!    WALLACE (_shaking hands_). Hello, Dad!    HILDA. Wallace! My boy!    (WALLACE _drops valise and goes to his mother's arms._)    WALLACE (_with deep feeling_). Mother!    WHITE (_after a pause_). Well, boy; this is unexpected. We were  just talking of you.    WALLACE. Were you?    HILDA. I'm so glad to see you, so glad.    WALLACE. Yes--yes--but--    WHITE. There's nothing the matter?    HILDA. You've had trouble at college?    WALLACE. Not exactly. But I couldn't stand it there. I've  left--for good.    WHITE. I was sure that would happen.    HILDA. Tell us. You know we'll understand.    WALLACE. Dad, if you don't mind, I'd like to talk it over with  mother first.    WHITE. Of course, old fellow, that's right. She'll stand by you  just as she's always stood by me--all these years. (_He kisses  her._) I--I--    (_He smooths her hair gently, looking into her eyes as she smiles  up at him._)    We mustn't let this war hurt all we've had together--you and I--    HILDA (_smiling and turning towards her son_). And Wallace.    WHITE. And Wallace. Yes. (WALLACE _looks away guiltily._) Let me  know when the phone comes.    (_He goes out hastily. She closes the door after him and then  comes to WALLACE, who has sat down, indicating he is troubled._)    HILDA. They made it hard for you at college?    WALLACE. I don't know how to tell you.    HILDA. I understand. The flag waving, the patriotic speeches, the  billboards advertising the glory of war, the call of adventure  offered to youth, the pressure of your friends--all made it hard  for you to be called a slacker.    WALLACE, No, mother. I wasn't afraid of what they could call me.  That was easy.    HILDA (_proudly_). You are your father's son!    WALLACE. Mother, I can't stand the thought of killing, you know  that. And I couldn't forget all you've told me. That's why I've  had to think this out all these months alone; why I've hesitated  longer than most fellows. The only thing I was really afraid of  was being wrong. But now I know I'm right and I'm going clean  through to the limit.    HILDA. As your father said, I 'll stand by you--whatever it  is--if only you feel it's right.    WALLACE. Will you? Will you, mother? No matter what happens? (_She  nods._) I knew you would. (_Taking her hand_) Then, mother, listen.  I've volunteered.    HILDA (_shocked_). Volunteered!    WALLACE. Yes. I leave for training-camp to-night.    HILDA. To-night?    WALLACE. Yes, mother. Once I made up my mind, I couldn't wait to  be drafted. I wanted to offer myself. I didn't want to be made to  go.    HILDA (_hardly grasping it_). But you are too young.    WALLACE. I lied about my age. You and father can stop me if you  tell the truth. That's why I've come back. I want you to promise  you won't tell.    HILDA. _You_ ask me to aid you in what I don't believe?  WALLACE. But you said you'd stick by me if _I_ thought it  was right.    HILDA. But--    WALLACE (_with fervor_). And I tell you, mother, I do feel it was  right for America to go in. I see now we ought to have declared  war when they crushed Belgium. Yes; we ought to have gone in when  the Lusitania was sunk. But we've been patient. The President  tried to keep us out of it until we _had_ to go in to save  our self-respect. We had to go in to show we were men of honor,  not pussy-cats. We had to go in to show the world the Stars and  Stripes wasn't a dish-rag on which the Germans could dry their  bloody hands!    HILDA (_gazing at him incredulously_). You hate them as much as  that?    WALLACE. Hate? No, mother, no. (_As if questioning himself_) I  really haven't any hate for the German _people_. People are  just people everywhere, I suppose, and they're tricked and fooled  by their rotten government, as the President says.    HILDA. Then why fight them?    WALLACE. Because they're standing back of their government, doing  what it says. And they've got to be licked to show them what kind  of a government they have.    HILDA. At least you have no hate in your heart--that's something.    WALLACE. Oh, yes, I have, mother. But it isn't for the poor  devils I've got to shoot. It's for the stay-at-home fellow here  in America who sits in a comfortable armchair, who applauds  patriotic sentiment, cheers the flag, and does nothing for his  country but hate and hate--while we fight for him. That's the  fellow I'll hate all right when I sit in the trenches. And that's  why I couldn't look myself in the face if I stayed out a day  longer; why I've got to go in; why I'm going to die if I must,  because _everybody_ ought to be willing to die for what he  believes.    HILDA. You are my son, _too_! For I would willingly have  died if it could have kept us out of this war.    WALLACE. Yes. I am your son, too. And that's why you wouldn't  respect me if I didn't go through.    HILDA. No. I wouldn't have respected you. But--but--(_She breaks  a bit, then controls herself._) You are quite sure you're doing  what's right?    WALLACE (_tenderly_). Would I have been willing to hurt you like  this?    HILDA (_holding him close to her_). My boy; my boy!    WALLACE. It'll be all right, mother.    HILDA. Ah, yes. It will be all right. Nothing matters in time:  it's only the moments that hurt.    WALLACE (_after a pause_). Then you won't tell my real age, or  interfere?    HILDA. I respect your right to decide your own life.    WALLACE (_joyed_). Mother!    HILDA. I respect your dedication; your willingness to sacrifice  for your beliefs. Why, Wallace, it would be a crime for me to  stand in your way--even with my mother's love. (_He kisses her._)  Do it all as cleanly as you can. I'll hope and pray that you'll  come back to me. (_Half breaking down and taking him in her arms_).  Oh, my boy; my boy. Let me hold you. You'll never know how hard  it is for a mother.    WALLACE (_gently_). But other mothers send their boys.    HILDA. Most of them believe in what their sons are fighting for.  Mothers have got to believe in it; or else how could they stand  the thought of bayonets stuck into the bodies they brought forth  in their own blood? (_There is a pause till she controls herself._)  I'll help you get your things together.    WALLACE. And father?    HILDA. He will be angry.    WALLACE. But you will make him understand?    HILDA. I'll try. Yet you must be patient with him if he doesn't  understand. Don't ever forget his long fight against all kinds of  Prussianism when you hear him reviled by those who have always  hated his radicalism and who, now, under the guise of patriotism,  are trying to render him useless for further attacks on them  after the war. He's been persecuted so by them--even back in the  days when our press was praising Germany and our distinguished  citizens were dining at the Emperor's table. Don't forget all  this, my boy. These days are hard for him--and me--harder perhaps  than for you who go out to die in glory and praise. There are no  flags for us, no music that stirs, no applause; but we too suffer  in silence for what we believe. And it is only the strongest who  can survive.--Now call your father.    WALLACE (_goes to door_). Dad! (_He leaves door open and turns to  his mother._) I'll be getting my things together. (_There is a  pause._ WHITE _enters._) Dad, mother has something to ask you. (_He  looks from father to mother._) Thanks, little mother.    (_He kisses her and goes out, taking the valise. His father and  mother stand facing each other._)    HILDA. Wallace has volunteered. (_He looks at her keenly._) He has  lied about his age. He wants us to let him go.    WHITE. Volunteered?    HILDA. Yes; he leaves to-night.    WHITE (_after a pause_). And what have you told him?    HILDA. That he must go.    WHITE. You can say that?    HILDA. It is the way he sees it.    WHITE (_going to her sympathetically_). Hilda.    HILDA (_looking up at him tenderly_). O Will, do you remember when  he was born? (_He soothes her._) And all we nursed him through  afterwards; and all we taught him; all we tried to show him about  war. (_With a shrug of her shoulders_) None of it has mattered.    WHITE. War"]]]
