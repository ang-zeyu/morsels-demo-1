He dedicated thirty-nine compositions  to thirty-six different women, and it is well known that he was  constantly falling in love, had made up his mind several times to  marry, and was twice refused. Female beauty always made a deep  impression on him, and Marx relates that \"even in his later years he  was fond of looking at pretty faces, and used to stand still in the  street and gaze after them with his eyeglasses till they were out of  sight; if anyone noticed this he smiled and looked confused, but not  annoyed. His little Werther romance he had lived at an early age in  Bonn. In Vienna, he is said to have had more than one love affair and  to have made an occasional conquest which would have been difficult  if not impossible to many an Adonis.\"    Weber's \"Freischuetz\" doubtless owes much of its beauty to the fact  that it was written but a few months before the composer's marriage.  In one of his letters to his betrothed he writes, \"Yesterday I  composed all the forenoon and thought of you _very often_, for I was  at work on a scene of _Agatha_, in which I still cannot attain all the  fire, longing, and passion that vaguely float before me.\" And his son  testifies that Weber's love influenced all his work at the time. \"It  was the reason,\" he says, \"that Weber took to heart, above everything  else, the part of _Aennchen_, in which he saw an embodiment of his  bride's special talent and characteristics, and it was under the  fostering stimulus of this warm feeling that he allowed those parts of  the opera in which _Aennchen_ appears to ripen first. The first note  which he wrote down for the 'Freischuetz' belongs in the duo between  _Aennchen_ and _Agatha_.\" He adds that his father, while composing,  actually saw his bride in his mind's eye, and heard her sing his  melodies, and accordingly as this imaginary vocalist nodded approval  or shook her head, he was led to retain or reject certain musical  ideas.    Schumann's letters contain a superabundance of evidence showing how  love suggested to him immortal musical thoughts. \"I have discovered,\"  he writes to his bride, \"that nothing transports the imagination so  readily as expectation and longing for something, as was again the  case during the last few days, when I was awaiting a letter from you,  and meanwhile composed whole volumes--strange, curious, solemn  things--how you will open your eyes when you play them. Indeed, I am  at present so full of musical ideas that I often feel as if I should  explode.\" This was in 1838, two years before his marriage. \"Schumann  himself admits,\" as Professor Spitta remarks, \"that his compositions  for the piano written during the period of his courtship reveal much  of his personal experiences and feelings, and his creative work of  1840 is of a very striking character. In this single year he wrote  over a hundred songs, the best he ever gave to the world, and,\" as  Professor Spitta continues, \"when we look through the words of his  songs, it is clear that here, more than anywhere, love was the  prompter--love that had endured so long a struggle, and at last  attained the goal of its desires. This is confirmed by the 'Myrthen,'  which he dedicated to the lady of his choice, and the twelve songs  from Rueckert's 'Springtime of Love'--which were written conjointly by  the two lovers.\"    The gay and genial Haydn appears to have been as great a favorite of  women as Beethoven, and he doubtless owed some of his inspirations to  their influence upon his susceptible heart. \"He always considered  himself an ugly man,\" Herr Pohl writes, \"and could not understand how  so many handsome women fell in love with him; 'at any rate,' he used  to say, 'they were not tempted by my beauty,' though he admitted that  he liked looking at a pretty woman, and was never at a loss for a  compliment.\"    Everybody has heard of the marvellous effect produced on Berlioz's  ardent imagination by the _Juliet_ of Miss Smithson. He relates in his  memoirs that an English critic said that after seeing Miss Smithson in  _Juliet_ he had cried out, \"I will marry that woman, and write my  grandest symphony on this play.\" \"I did both things,\" he adds, \"but I  never said anything of the sort.\" It is in \"Lelio\" that the story of  his love is embodied; and other compositions of his might be mentioned  which were simply the overflow of his passions.    Poor Schubert, who enjoyed little of the fame and less of the fortune  that were due him during his brief life, and who was as unattractive  in personal appearance as Haydn and Beethoven, does not seem to have  cared as much for women as most other composers. Nevertheless he fell  deeply in love with a countess, who, however, was too young to  reciprocate his feelings. But one day she asked him why he never  dedicated any of his compositions to her, whereupon he replied, \"Why  should I? Are not all my compositions dedicated to you?\" This was as  neat a compliment as Beethoven once made Frau von Arnim--an incident  which also gives us a glimpse of his manner of composing. One evening  at a party Beethoven repeatedly took his note-book from his pocket and  wrote a few lines in it. Subsequently, when he was alone with Frau von  Arnim, he looked over what he had written and sang it; whereupon he  exclaimed: \"There, how does that sound? It is yours if you like it; I  made it for you, you inspired me with it; _I saw it written in your  eyes_.\"    Many similar cases might be cited, showing that although women may  have done little for music from a creative point of view, they are  indirectly responsible for many of the most inspired products of the  great composers. And the moral of the story is that a young musician,  as soon as he has secured a good poetic subject for a song or an  opera, should hasten to fall in love, in order to tune his  heart-strings and devotions to concert pitch. And a patriotic wag  might, perhaps, be allowed to maintain that, as America has more  pretty girls than any other country in the world, it is easier to fall  in love here than elsewhere, and that there is, therefore, no excuse  whatever for American composers if they do not soon lead the world in  musical inspiration.    Feminine beauty, however, is not the only kind of beauty that arouses  dormant musical ideas and brings them to light. The beauty of nature  appeals as strongly to musicians as to poets, and is responsible for  many of their inspirations. When Mendelssohn visited Fingal's Cave, he  wrote a letter on one of the Hebrides, inclosing twenty bars of music  \"to show how extraordinarily the place affected me,\" to use his own  words. \"These twenty bars,\" says Sir George Grove, \"an actual  inspiration, are virtually identical with the opening of the wonderful  overture which bears the name of 'Hebrides' or 'Fingal's Cave.'\" And  an English admirer of Mendelssohn, who had the honor of entertaining  him in the country, notes how deeply he entered into the beauty of the  hills and the woods. \"His way of representing them,\" he says, \"was not  with the pencil; but in the evenings his improvised music would show  what he had observed or felt in the past day. The piece which he  called 'The Rivulet,' which he wrote at that time, for my sister  Susan, will show what I mean; it was a recollection of a real, actual  rivulet.    \"We observed\" he continues, \"how natural objects seemed to suggest  music to him. There was in my sister Honora's garden a pretty creeping  plant, new at that time, covered with little trumpet-like flowers. He  was struck with it, and played for her the music which (he said) the  fairies might play on those trumpets. When he wrote out the piece he  drew a little branch of that flower all up the margin of the paper.\"  In another piece, inspired by the sight of carnations, they found that  Mendelssohn intended certain arpeggio passages \"as a reminder of the  sweet scent of the flower rising up.\"    Mozart, as many witnesses have testified, was especially attuned to  composition by the sight of beautiful scenery. Rochlitz relates that  when he travelled with his wife through picturesque regions he gazed  attentively and in silence at the surrounding sights; his features,  which usually had a reserved and gloomy, rather than a cheerful  expression, gradually brightened, and then he began to sing, or rather  to hum, till suddenly he exclaimed: \"If I only had that theme on  paper.\" He always preferred to live in the country, and wrote the  greater part of his two best operas, \"Don Juan,\" and \"The Magic  Flute,\" in one of those picturesque little garden houses which are so  often seen in Austria and Germany. In one of these airy structures, he  confessed, he could write more in ten days than he could in his  apartments in two months.    Berlioz relates somewhere that the musical ideas for his \"Faust\" came  to him unbidden during his rambles among Italian hills. Weber's  melodies are so much like fragrant forest flowers that one feels sure  before being told that he came across them in the woods and fields.  His famous pupil, Sir Julius Benedict, relates that Weber took as  great delight in taking his friends to see his favorite bits of  landscape, as he did in composing a fine piece of music; and he adds  that \"this love of nature, and principally of forest life, may explain  his predilection, in the majority of his operas, for hunting choruses  and romantic scenery.\"    Richard Wagner conceived most of his vigorous and eloquent leading  melodies during his rambles among the picturesque environs of  Bayreuth, or the sublime snowpeaks of Switzerland. How he elaborated  them we shall see later on. Of Beethoven's devotion to nature many  curious anecdotes are told by his contemporaries. A harp manufacturer  named Stumpff met him in 1823 and wrote an account of his visit in  \"The Harmonicon,\" a London journal, in which occurs this passage:  \"Beetho"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18564"],[0,"The Religion of Ancient Rome (#10)"],[1,"the Lares at the 'marches' (_Compitalia_), of which  we have spoken in treating of the worship of the house.    The other group of winter-festivals is of a much more gloomy and less  definitely rustic type, though they clearly date from the period of the  agricultural community. Of the Feralia of February 21, the culmination  of the festival of the kindred dead (_Parentalia_), we have already  spoken. The Larentalia is a very mysterious occasion, and was supposed  by the Romans themselves to be an offering 'at the tomb' of a legendary  Acca Larentia, mistress of Hercules. But we have seen reason to think  that Larentia was in reality a deity of the dead, and the 'tomb' a  _mundus_: if so, we have another link between the winter season and the  worship of the underworld. There remains the weird festival of the  Lupercalia on February 15, to which we have had occasion to refer  several times, and which has become more familiar to most of us than  other Roman festivals owing to its political use by Mark Antony in 44  B.C. As we have argued already, it seems to belong to the very oldest  stratum of the Palatine settlement, and we may therefore appropriately  close this account of the early festivals with a somewhat fuller  description of it. The worshippers assembled at the Lupercal, a cave on  the Palatine hill: there goats and a dog were sacrificed, and two  youths belonging to the two colleges of Fabian and Quintian (or  Quintilian) Luperci had their foreheads smeared with the knife used for  the sacrifice and wiped with wool dipped in milk--at which point it was  ordained that they should laugh. Then they girt on the skins of the  slain goats and, after feasting, ran their course round the boundaries  of the Palatine hill, followed each by his own company of youths, and  striking women on their way with strips, known as _februae_ or _Iunonis  amicula_, cut from the goats' hides. Here we have a summary of many of  the important points which we have noticed in the rustic festivals:  from the pre-Roman stratum comes the idea of communion with the  sacrificed animal in the smearing of the blood and the wearing of the  skin, and also the magic charm involved in the striking of the women to  procure fertility: it is typical of the true feeling of Roman religion  that we cannot with any certainty tell what deity was associated with  the rite, though probably it was Faunus: the rustic character of the  ceremony is indicated by the bowl of milk in which the wool was dipped  and the sacrifice of goats: the idea of lustration is clearly marked  in the course round the boundaries: the original Palatine settlement  stands out in the limits of that course and the site of the Lupercal,  and the later synoecismus is seen in the, presumably subsequent,  addition of the second college of Luperci. A careful study of the  Lupercalia as an epitome of the character and development of the Roman  agricultural festivals, though it would not show the brighter aspect of  some of the spring and summer celebrations, would yet give a true  notion of the history and spirit of the whole.    FOOTNOTES:    [9] Ov., _Fast._, iv. 735.          CHAPTER VII    WORSHIP OF THE STATE      Since, in the matter of religion, the Roman state is in the main but  the agricultural household magnified, we shall not, in considering its  worship, be entering on a new stratum of ideas, but rather looking at  the development of notions and sentiments already familiar. To deal,  however, with the state-worship in full would not only far exceed the  limits of this sketch, but would lead us away from religious ideas into  the region of what we might now call 'ecclesiastical management.' I  propose therefore to confine myself to two points, firstly, the  broadening of the old conceptions of the household and the fields and  their adaptation to the life of the state, and secondly--to be treated  very shortly and as an indication of the Roman character--the  organisation of religion.    =1. Development of the Worship of House and Fields.=--Here we shall  find two main characteristics. The state in the first place, as we  have several times hinted in anticipation, establishes its own  counterpart of the household and rustic cults and adapts to its own use  the ideas which they involve: in the second, and particularly in  connection with some of the field-deities, it evolves new and very  frequently abstract notions, foreign to the life of the independent  country households, but necessary and vital to the life of an organised  community. Let us look first at the fate of the household deities.    =Ianus.=--We left Ianus as the _numen_ of the house-door: he passes  into the state exactly in the same capacity: the state too has its  'door,' the gate at the north-east corner of the Forum, and this  becomes the seat of his state-cult--the door which, according to  Augustan legend, is opened in the time of war and only shut when Rome  is at peace with all the world. But reflection soon gets to work on  Ianus: a door has two sides, it can both open and shut; therefore, as  early as the song of the Salii, he has developed the cult-epithets  'Opener,' 'Shutter' (_Patulci_, _Cloesi_), and as soon as he is thought  of as anything approaching a personality he is 'two-headed'  (_bifrons_), as he appears in later representations. The door again is  the first thing you come to in entering a house: the 'door-spirit'  then, with that tendency to abstraction which we shall see shortly in  other cases, becomes the god of beginnings. He watches over the very  first beginning of human life in his character of _Consevius_; to him  is sacred the first hour of the day (_pater matutinus_), the Calends of  every month, and the first month of the year (_Ianuarius_); to him too  is offered by the _rex sacrorum_ the first sacrifice of the year, the  Agonium on the 9th of January. In this capacity, moreover, his name  comes first in all the formulae of prayer, and he is looked upon--not  indeed as the father of the gods--for that is a much too  anthropomorphic notion--but as what we might now term their 'logical  antecedent': _divum deus_, as the song of the Salii quaintly puts it,  _principium deorum_, as later interpretation explained it. Yet through  all he remains the most typical Roman deity: he does not acquire a  temple till 217 B.C., nor a bust until quite late, nor is he ever  identified with a Greek counterpart. In his capacity as _pater  matutinus_ he has a native female counterpart in Matuta, a dawn-deity,  who becomes a protectress in childbirth, and as such is the centre of  the matrons' festival, the Matralia of June 11.    =Vesta.=--The history of Vesta is perhaps less romantic, but it affords  a more exact parallel between household and state. In the primitive  community the king's hearth is not merely of symbolical importance, but  of great practical utility, in that it is kept continually burning as  the source of fire on which the individual householder may draw: hence  it is the duty of the king's daughters to care for it and keep the  flame perpetually alight. In Rome the temple of Vesta is the king's  hearth, situated, as one would expect, in close proximity to the  _regia_. The fire is kept continually blazing except on the 1st of  March of every year, when it is allowed to go out and is ceremonially  renewed. The Vestal virgins, sworn to perpetual virginity and charged  with the preservation of the sacred flame, are 'the king's daughters,'  living in a kind of convent (_atrium Vestae_) and under the charge of  the king's representative, the _pontifex maximus_. It is their duty  too, as the natural cooks of the sacred royal household, to make the  salt cake (_mola salsa_) to be used at the year's festivals and to  preserve it and other sacred objects, such as the ashes of the  Fordicidia, in the storehouse of Vesta (_penus Vestae_). In the month of  June from the 7th to the 15th, with a climax on the 9th, the day of  the Vestalia, the matrons who all the year round have tended their own  hearths, come in solemn procession bare-footed to make their homely  offerings at the state-hearth, and the virgins meanwhile offer the  cakes that they have made. For eight days the ceremony continues,  during which time the bakers and millers keep holiday; the days are  _religiosi_ (marriages are unlucky and other taboos are observed) and  also _nefasti_ (no public business may be performed); until the  ceremony closes on the 15th, with the solemn cleansing of the temple  and the casting of the refuse into the Tiber, and then the normal life  of the state may be renewed--Q. St. D. F. (_Quando Stercus Delatum Fas_)  is the unique entry in the Calendars. This is all less imaginative than  the development of Ianus, but the underlying feeling is intensely Roman  and there could be no clearer idea of the natural adaptation of the  household-cult to the religion of the state.    =Penates, Lares, and Genius.=--The other household deities too have  their counterpart, though not so prominently marked, in the worship of  the state. The magistrates, on entering office, took oath by Iuppiter  and the _Di Penates populi Romani Quiritium_, and that the conception  was as wide in the state as in the household is shown by the fact that  on less formal occasions the formula appears as _Iuppiter et ceteri di  omnes immortales_. The Penates of the state then would include all the  state-deities; but that their original character is not lost sight of  we can see from the statement of Varro that in the _penus Vestae_ (the  'state storehouse') were preserved their _sigilla_--not apparently  sensuous representations, but symbolic objects, such as we have seen  before in cases like that of the _silex_ of Iuppiter. The _Lares_ again  find their counterpart in the _Lares Praestites_ of the state, and  their rustic festival, the Compitalia, has its urban reproduction,  which, as it involved considerable license"]]]
