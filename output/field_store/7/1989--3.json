The \"point of repose\"  is shifted to the second beat, in the manner so amply illustrated in  the examples of the disguised cadence; the methods we have seen may be  applied to _any_ kind of cadence.    See also Ex. 18; the key, and therefore the chord, at the semicadence  is the same as that of the above example (simply major instead of  minor).    Also Ex. 23, No. 4; the semicadence chord is the dominant harmony of  E-flat major; it is skillfully disguised.  Ex. 25, dominant harmony of  A major.  Ex. 26, last four measures; the semicadence is made upon the  dominant of C minor.    In the following:    [Illustration: Example 35.  Fragment of Schumann.]    the semicadence in the fourth measure is made with the dominant harmony  of C major (the tones _g-b-d-f_); it is so disguised as to remove all  signs of interruption; but the chord _prevails_ throughout the measure,  and (as may be seen by reference to the original, op. 68, No. 3) the  next measure--the fifth--exactly corresponds to the first; this  indicates another \"beginning,\" and proves our \"ending.\"    But though the dominant is thus generally employed at the semicadence,  it is by no means the only available chord.  It must be remembered that  every cadence which does not fulfil the definite conditions of the  perfect cadence, is a semicadence.  Examine each of the following, and  determine why the point of repose is each time a semicadence:--Ex. 1;  Ex. 9, No. 3; Ex. 14, No. 2, fourth measure; Ex. 14, No. 3, fourth  measure; Ex. 19; Ex. 22, Nos. 3 and 4; Ex. 23, No. 2, fourth measure.    The distinction between the two species of cadence becomes most subtle  when the _tonic harmony_ is chosen for the semicadence, _but with some  other part of the chord than the keynote as uppermost (or lowermost)  tone_.  This might appear to lighten the perfect cadence too  immaterially to exercise so radical an influence upon the value  (weight) of the interruption.  The _keynote_, however, is so decisive  and final in its harmonic and melodic effect--everywhere in music--that  its absence more or less completely cancels the terminating quality of  the cadence-chord; in other words, the force of a tonic cadence depends  upon the weight and prominence of the _keynote_.    For example:    [Illustration: Example 36.  Fragment of Schubert.]      The first, second, and third of these cadences is made upon the tonic  harmony, on the accent of each successive fourth measure.  But they are  only _semicadences_, as the melody (uppermost part) rests upon the  Third of the chord, _c_, instead of the keynote; this substitution of  _c_ for _a-flat_ is sufficient to frustrate the perfect cadence and  diminish it to a transient interruption.  The final cadence is perfect,  however, because there the uppermost tone _is_ the keynote.  See also  Ex. 21; and Ex. 17, No. 2, fourth measure (semicadence, with _a_  instead of _f_ as principal tone in upper part, and disguised by the  continuation of rhythmic movement to the end of the cadence-measure).  In Ex. 17, No. 1, the cadence is made with the tonic harmony of G  minor, but with the Third (_b-flat_) at the top.      LOCATING THE CADENCES.--Next to the recognition and comparison of the  different melodic sections of a composition (in a word, the _melodic  delineation_ of the whole), the most significant task in music analysis  is the locating and classifying of the cadences.  They are the angles  of the design, so to speak; and have the same bearing upon the sense of  the music as punctuation marks have in rhetoric.  Intelligent and  effective phrasing, adequate interpretation of the composer's purpose,  is impossible without a distinct exposition of the cadences,--if not of  the inferior points of interruption between motives, also.    The best general rule for locating cadences is, probably, to look for  them in the right place, namely, in the _fourth measure_ from the  beginning of each phrase.  The fairly regular operation of this rule  has been verified in Lesson 4.  But exceptions have also been seen (in  Ex. 17), and many more are certain to be encountered, simply because  the principle of Unity (exemplified by the prevalence of the  four-measure standard) must interact with the principle of Variety  (exemplified in all phrases of irregular extent).    Therefore, the more reliable method, as already stated, is _to define  the beginning of the following phrase_,--for each successive beginning  involves a foregone cadence, of course.  No very definite directions  can be given; experience, observation, careful study and comparison of  the given illustrations, will in time surely enable the student to  recognize the \"signs\" of a beginning,--such as the recurrence of some  preceding principal member of the melody, or some such change in  melodic or rhythmic character as indicates that a new phrase is being  announced.      LESSON 5.  Analyze, again, Schumann, _Jugend Album_ (op. 68), No. 6,  locating every cadence and defining its quality,--as perfect cadence or  semicadence.  Also Nos. 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 33, 14, 15, 16, 3,--and  others.  As a curious illustration of the difficulty which may  sometimes attend the analysis of phrases and cadences, the student may  glance at No. 31 (_Kriegslied_, D major); a more baffling example will  rarely be found, for the piece abounds in irregular phrase-dimensions,  and cadences that are disguised to the verge of unrecognizability; the  only fairly reliable clue the composer has given lies in the formation  of the melodic members (the clue intimated in the explanatory text  following Ex. 35).    Also Mendelssohn, Songs Without Words, No. 34 (first phrase six  measures long); No. 40; No. 18.    Also Beethoven's pianoforte sonata, op. 22, third movement  (_Menuetto_); op. 28, second movement (_Andante_).    Again the student is reminded that it is not only permissible, but wise  and commendable, to pass by all confusing cases; without being careless  or downright superficial, to observe a certain degree of prudent  indifference at confusing points, trusting to that superior  intelligence which he shall surely gain through wider experience.          CHAPTER VI.  IRREGULAR PHRASES.    CAUSES.--The possibility of deviating from the fundamental standard of  phrase-dimension (four measures) has been repeatedly intimated, and is  treated with some detail in the text preceding Example 17, which should  be reviewed.  It is now necessary to examine some of the conditions that  lead to this result.    The causes of irregular phrase-dimension are two-fold; it may result    (1) from simply inserting an additional cadence, or from omitting one.  Or    (2) it may be the consequence of some specific manipulation of the  phrase-melody with a view to its extension or expansion, its development  into a broader and more exhaustive exposition of its contents.      THE SMALL AND LARGE PHRASES.--If a cadence is inserted before it is  properly due, it is almost certain to occur exactly _half-way_ along the  line toward the expected (regular) cadence,--that is, in the _second_  measure.  This is likely to be the case only when the tempo is so slow,  or the measures of so large a denomination, that two of them are  practically equal to four _ordinary_ measures.  By way of distinction,  such a two-measure phrase is called a Small phrase.  For example:--    [Illustration: Example 37.  Fragment of Mendelssohn.]    There is no reasonable doubt of the semicadence in the second measure,  because enough pulses have been heard, up to that point, to represent the  sum of an ordinary phrase.  If this were written in 6-8 measure (as it  might be), it would contain four measures.  See, also, Song No. 22 of  Mendelssohn,--9-8 measure, adagio tempo; the phrases are \"Small\"; note  particularly the last two measures.  The same is true in No. 17.  About  Schumann, op. 68, No. 43 (_Sylvesterlied_), there may be some doubt; but  the measures, though of common denomination, contain so many tones, in  moderate tempo, that the effect of a cadence is fairly complete in the  second measure.    If, on the other hand, one of the regular cadences is omitted,--owing to  the rapidity of the tempo, or a small denomination of measure,--the  phrase will attain just double the ordinary length; that is, _eight_  measures.  An eight-measure phrase is called a Large phrase.  For  illustration:--    [Illustration: Example 38.  Fragment of Beethoven.]    There is not the slightest evidence of repose or interruption in the  fourth measure, nor of a new beginning in the fifth, wherefore the  cadence is not expected until four more measures have passed by.  The  inferior points of repose in the upper parts, at the beginning of the  5th, 6th and 7th measures, serve only to establish melodic, or rather  rhythmic, variety, and have no cadential force whatever.  See  Mendelssohn, Song No. 8; the first cadence appears to stand in the  _eighth_ measure; the tempo is rapid and the measures are small; it is  obviously a large phrase.  The phrase which follows is regular, however;  there _is_ a cadence in the twelfth measure, thus proving that Large  phrases may appear in company with regular phrases, in the same  composition.  In other words, the omission of an expected cadence (or the  insertion of an additional one) may be an _occasional_ occurrence,--not  necessarily constant.  See, again, No. 22 of the Songs Without Words; the  first and second phrases are small; the third phrase, however (reaching  from measure 6 to 9 without cadential interruption), is of regular  dimensions.      THE PRINCIPLE OF EXTENSION.--The other cause of modified phrase-dimension  is one of extreme importance, as touching upon the most vital process in  musical composition, namely, that of _phrase-development_.

Ki/tshi Man/id[-o] saw that his people on earth were    without the means of protecting themselves against disease and death,    so he sent Mi/nab[-o]/zho to give to them the sacred gift.    Mi/nab[-o]/zho appeared over the waters and while reflecting in what    manner he should be able to communicate with the people, he heard    something laugh, just as an otter sometimes cries out. He saw    something black appear upon the waters in the west (No. 2) which    immediately disappeared beneath the surface again. Then it came up at    the northern horizon (No. 3), which pleased Mi/nab[-o]/zho, as he    thought he now had some one through whom he might convey the    information with which he had been charged by Ki/tshi Man/id[-o]. When    the black object disappeared beneath the waters at the north to    reappear in the east (No. 4), Mi/nab[-o]/zho desired it would come to    him in the middle of the waters, but it disappeared to make its    reappearance in the south (No. 5), where it again sank out of sight to    reappear in the west (No. 2), when Mi/nab[-o]/zho asked it to approach    the center where there was an island (No. 6), which it did. This did    Ni/g[)i]k, the Otter, and for this reason he is given charge of the    first degree of the Mid[-e]/wiwin (Nos. 35 and 36) where his spirit    always abides during initiation and when healing the sick.      Then Ni/g[)i]k asked Mi/nab[-o]/zho, \"Why do you come to this place?\"    When the latter said, \"I have pity on the Ani/shin[^a]/b[-e]g and wish    to give them life; Ki/tshi Man/id[-o] gave me the power to confer upon    them the means of protecting themselves against sickness and death,    and through you I will give them the Mid[-e]/wiwin, and teach them the    sacred rites.\"      Then Mi/nab[-o]/zho built a Mid[-e]/wig[^a]n in which he instructed    the Otter in all the mysteries of the Mid[-e]/wiwin. The Otter sat    before the door of the Mid[-e]/wig[^a]n four days (Nos. 7, 8, 9, and    10), sunning himself, after which time he approached the entrance    (No. 14), where his progress was arrested (No. 11) by seeing two bad    spirits (Nos. 12 and 13) guarding it. Through the powers possessed by    Mi/nab[-o]/zho he was enabled to pass these; when he entered the    sacred lodge (No. 15), the first object he beheld being the sacred    stone (No. 16) against which those who were sick were to be seated, or    laid, when undergoing the ceremonial of restoring them to health. He    next saw a post (No. 17) painted red with a green band around the top.    A sick man would also have to pray to the stone and to the post, when    he is within the Mid[-e]/wig[^a]n, because within them would be the    Mid[-e]/ spirits whose help he invoked. The Otter was then taken to    the middle of the Mid[-e]/wig[^a]n where he picked up the m[-i]/gis    (No. 18) from among a heap of sacred objects which form part of the    gifts given by Ki/tshi Man/id[-o]. The eight man/id[-o]s around the    mid[-e]/wig[^a]n (Nos. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, and 26) were also    sent by Ki/tshi Man/id[-o] to guard the lodge against the entrance of    bad spirits.    A life is represented by the line No. 27, the signification of the short  lines (Nos. 28, 29, 30, and 31) denoting that the course of human  progress is beset by temptations and trials which may be the cause of  one's departure from such course of conduct as is deemed proper, and the  beliefs taught by the Mid[-e]/. When one arrives at middle age (No. 32)  his course for the remaining period of life is usually without any  special events, as indicated by the plain line No. 27, extending from  middle age (No. 32) to the end of one's existence (No. 33). The short  lines at Nos. 28, 29, 30, and 31, indicating departure from the path of  propriety, terminate in rounded spots and signify, literally, \"lecture  places,\" because when a Mid[-e]/ feels himself failing in duty or  vacillating in faith he must renew professions by giving a feast and  lecturing to his confreres, thus regaining his strength to resist evil  doing--such as making use of his powers in harming his kinsmen, teaching  that which was not given him by Ki/tshi Man/id[-o] through  Mi/nab[-o]/zho, etc. His heart must be cleansed and his tongue guarded.    To resume the tradition of the course pursued by the Otter,  Sikas/sig[)e] said:      The Otter then went round the interior of the Mid[-e]/wig[^a]n (No.    34), and finally seated himself in the west, where Mi/nab[-o]/zho shot    into his body the sacred m[-i]/gis, which was in his Mid[-e]/ bag.    Then Mi/nab[-o]/zho said, \"This is your lodge and you shall own it    always (Nos. 35 and 36), and eight Mid[-e]/ Man/id[-o]s (Nos. 19-26)    shall guard it during the night.\"      The Otter was taken to the entrance (No. 37) of the second degree    structure (No. 38), which he saw was guarded by two evil man/id[-o]s    (Nos. 39 and 40), who opposed his progress, but who were driven away    by Mi/nab[-o]/zho. When the Otter entered at the door he beheld the    sacred stone (No. 41) and two posts (Nos. 42, 43), the one nearest to    him being painted red with a green band around the top, and another at    the middle, with a bunch of little feathers upon the top. The other    post (No. 43) was painted red, with only a band of green at the top,    similar to the first degree post. Nos. 44 and 45 are the places where    sacred objects and gifts are placed. This degree of the Mid[-e]/wiwin    is guarded at night by twelve Mid[-e]/ Man/id[-o]s (Nos. 46 to 57)    placed there by Ki/tshi Man/id[-o], and the degree is owned by the    Thunder Bird as shown in Nos. 58, 59.    The circles (Nos. 60, 61, and 62) at either end of the outline of the  structure denoting the degree and beneath it are connected by a line  (No. 63) as in the preceding degree, and are a mere repetition to denote  the course of conduct to be pursued by the Mid[-e]/. The points (Nos.  64, 65, 66, and 67), at the termini of the shorter lines, also refer to  the feasts and lectures to be given in case of need.    To continue the informant's tradition:      When the Otter had passed around the interior of the Mid[-e]/wig[^a]n    four times, he seated himself in the west and faced the degree post,    when Mi/nab[-o]/zho again shot into his body the m[-i]/gis, which gave    him renewed life. Then the Otter was told to take a \"sweat bath\" once    each day for four successive days, so as to prepare for the next    degree. (This number is indicated at the rounded spots at Nos. 68, 69,    70, and 71.)      The third degree of the Mid[-e]/wiwin (No. 72) is guarded during the    day by two Mid[-e]/ spirits (Nos. 73, 74) near the eastern entrance,    and by the Makwa/ Man/id[-o] within the inclosure (Nos. 75 and 76),    and at night by eighteen Mid[-e]/ Man/id[-o]s (Nos. 77 to 94), placed    there by Ki/tshi Man/id[-o]. When the Otter approached the entrance    (No. 95) he was again arrested in his progress by two evil man/id[-o]s    (Nos. 96 and 97), who opposed his admission, but Mi/nib[-o]/zho    overcame them and the Otter entered. Just inside of the door, and on    each side, the Otter saw a post (Nos. 98 and 99), and at the western    door or exit two corresponding posts (Nos. 100 and 101). These    symbolized the four legs of the Makwa/ Man/id[-o], or Bear Spirit, who    is the guardian by day and the owner of the third degree. The Otter    then observed the sacred stone (No. 102) and the two heaps of sacred    objects (Nos. 103 and 104) which Mi/nab[-o]/zho had deposited, and    three degree posts (Nos. 105, 106, and 107), the first of which (No.    105) was a plain cedar post with the bark upon it, but sharpened at    the top; the second (No. 106), a red post with a green band round the    top and one about the middle, as in the second degree; and the third a    cross (No. 107) painted red, each of the tips painted green. [The    vertical line No. 108 was said to have no relation to anything    connected with the tradition.] After the Otter had observed the    interior of the Mid[-e]/wig[^a]n he again made four circuits, after    which he took his station in the west, where he seated himself, facing    the sacred degree posts. Then Mi/nab[-o]/zho, for the third time, shot    into his body the m[-i]/gis, thus adding to the powers which he    already possessed, after which he was to prepare for the fourth degree    of the Mid[-e]/wiwin.    Other objects appearing upon the chart were subsequently explained as  follows:      The four trees (Nos. 109, 110, 111, and 112), one of which is planted    at each of the four corners of the Mid[-e]/wig[^a]n, are usually    cedar, though pine may be taken as a substitute when the former can    not be had. The repetition of the circles Nos. 113, 114, and 115 and    connecting line No. 116, with the short lines at Nos. 117, 118, 119,    and 120, have the same signification as in the preceding two degrees.      After the Otter had received the third degree he prepared himself for    the fourth, and highest, by taking a steam bath once a day for four    successive days (Nos. 121, 122, 123, and 124). Then, as he proceeded    toward the Mid[-e]/wig[^a]n he came to a wig/iwam made of brush (No.    179), which was the nest of Makwa/ Man/id[-o], the Bear Spirit, who    guarded the four doors of the sacred structure.    The four rows of spots have reference to the four entrances of the  Mid[-e]/wig[^a]n of the fourth degree. The signification of the spots  near the larger circle, just beneath the \"Bear's nest\" could not be  explained by Sikas/sig[)e], but the row of spots (No. 117) along the  horizontal line leading to the entrance of the inclosure were  denominated steps, or stages of progress, equal to as many days--one  spot denoting one day--wh"]]]
