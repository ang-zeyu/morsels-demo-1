Perhaps it is  wise that you should go--but don't you forget your music, Buddy--and be  a good boy, and remember, mother's going to follow you with her love and  her faith in you, and her prayers.\"    It may have been that Buddy's baby memory of going north whenever the  trail herd started remained to send Bud instinctively northward when he  left the Tomahawk next morning. It had been a case of stubborn father  and stubborn son dickering politely over the net earnings of the son  from the time when he was old enough to leave his mother's lap and climb  into a saddle to ride with his father. Three horses and his personal  belongings had been agreed upon between them as the balance in Bud's  favor; and at that, Bob Birnie dryly remarked, he had been a better  investment as a son than most young fellows, who cost more than they  were worth to raise.    Bud did not answer the implied praise, but roped the Tomahawk's best  three horses out of the REMUDA corralled for him by his father's riders.  You should have seen the sidelong glances among the boys when they  learned that Bud, just home from the University, was going somewhere  with all his earthly possessions and a look in his face that meant  trouble!    Two big valises and his blankets he packed on Sunfish, a deceptively  raw-boned young buckskin with much white showing in his eyes--an ornery  looking brute if ever there was one. Bud's guitar and a mandolin in  their cases he tied securely on top of the pack. Smoky, the second  horse, a deep-chested \"mouse\" with a face almost human in its  expression, he saddled, and put a lead rope on the third, a bay  four-year-old called Stopper, which was the Tomahawk's best rope-horse  and one that would be missed when fast work was wanted in branding.    \"He sure as hell picked himself three top hawses,\" a tall puncher  murmured to another. \"Wonder where he's headed for? Not repping--this  late in the season.\"    Bud overheard them, and gave no sign. Had they asked him directly he  could not have told them, for he did not know, except that somehow  he felt that he was going to head north. Why north, he could not have  explained, since cow-country lay all around him; nor how far north,--for  cow-country extended to the upper boundary of the States, and beyond  into Canada.    He left his horses standing by the corral while he went to the house to  tell his mother good-by, and to send a farewell message to Dulcie,  who had been married a year and lived in Laramie. He did not expect to  strike Laramie, he told his mother when she asked him.    \"I'm going till I stop,\" He explained, with a squeeze of her shoulders  to reassure her. \"I guess it's the way you felt, mother, when you left  Texas behind. You couldn't tell where you folks would wind up. Neither  can I. My trail herd is kinda small, right now; a lot smaller than it  will be later on. But such as it is, it's going to hit the right range  before it stops for good. And I'll write.\"    He took a doughnut in his hand and a package of lunch to slip in his  pocket, kissed her with much cheerfulness in his manner and hurried out,  his big-rowelled spurs burring on the porch just twice before he stepped  off on the gravel. Telling mother good-by had been the one ordeal he  dreaded, and he was glad to have it over with.    Old Step-and-a-Half hailed him as he went past the chuck-house, and came  limping out, wiping his hands on his apron before he shook hands and  wished him good luck. Ezra, pottering around the tool shed, ambled up  with the eyes of a dog that has been sent back home by his master.  \"Ah shoah do wish yo' all good fawtune an' health, Marse Buddy,\" Ezra  quavered. \"Ah shoah do. It ain' goin' seem lak de same place--and Ah  shoah do hopes yo' all writes frequent lettahs to yo' mothah, boy!\"    Bud promised that he would, and managed to break away from Ezra without  betraying himself. How, he wondered, did everyone seem to know that he  was going for good, this time? He had believed that no one knew of it  save himself, his father and his mother; yet everyone else behaved as  if they never expected to see him again. It was disconcerting, and Bud  hastily untied the two led horses and mounted Smoky, the mouse-colored  horse he himself had broken two years before.    His father came slowly up to him, straight-backed and with the gait of  the man who has ridden astride a horse more than he has walked on his  own feet. He put up his hand, gloved for riding, and Bud changed the  lead-ropes from his right hand to his left, and shook hands rather  formally.    \"Ye've good weather for travelling,\" said Bob Birnie tentatively. \"I  have not said it before, lad, but when ye own yourself a fool to take  this way of making your fortune, ten thousand dollars will still be  ready to start ye right. I've no wish to shirk a duty to my family.\"    Bud pressed his lips together while he listened. \"If you keep your ten  thousand till it's called for, you'll be drawing interest a long time on  it,\" He said. \"It's going to be hot to-day. I'll be getting along.\"    He lifted the reins, glanced back to see that the two horses were  showing the proper disposition to follow, and rode off down the  deep-rutted road that followed up the creek to the pass where he had  watched the Utes dancing the war dance one night that he remembered  well. If he winced a little at the familiar landmarks he passed,  he still held fast to the determination to go, and to find fortune  somewhere along the trail of his own making; and to ask help from no  man, least of all his father who had told him to go.        CHAPTER SEVEN: BUD FLIPS A COIN WITH FATE    \"I don't think it matters so much where we light, it's what we do when  we get there,\" said Bud to Smoky, his horse, one day as they stopped  where two roads forked at the base of a great, outstanding peak that was  but the point of a mountain range. \"This trail straddles the butte and  takes on up two different valleys. It's all cow-country--so what do yuh  say, Smoke? Which trail looks the best to you?\"    Smoky flopped one ear forward and the other one back, and switched at a  pestering fly. Behind him Sunfish and Stopper waited with the patience  they had learned in three weeks of continuous travel over country that  was rough in spots, barren in places, with wind and sun and occasional,  sudden thunderstorms to punctuate the daily grind of travel.    Bud drew a half dollar from his pocket and regarded it meditatively.  \"They're going fast--we'll just naturally have to stop pretty soon, or  we don't eat,\" He observed. \"Smoke, you're a quitter. What you want to  do is go back--but you won't get the chance. Heads, we take the right  hand trail. I like it better, anyway--it angles more to the north.\"    Heads it was, and Bud leaned from the saddle and recovered the coin,  Smoky turning his head to regard his rider tolerantly. \"Right hand  goes--and we camp at the first good water and grass. I can grain the  three of you once more before we hit a town, and that goes for me, too.  G'wan, Smoke, and don't act so mournful.\"    Smoky went on, following the trail that wound in and out around the  butte, hugging close its sheer sides to avoid a fifty-foot drop into the  creek below. It was new country--Bud had never so much as seen a map  of it to give him a clue to what was coming. The last turn of the  deep-rutted, sandy road where it left the river's bank and led straight  between two humpy shoulders of rock to the foot of a platter-shaped  valley brought him to a halt again in sheer astonishment.    From behind a low hill still farther to the right, where the road forked  again, a bluish haze of smoke indicated that there was a town of  some sort, perhaps. Farther up the valley a brownish cloud hung low-a  roundup, Bud knew at a glance. He hesitated. The town, if it were a  town, could wait; the roundup might not. And a job he must have soon, or  go hungry. He turned and rode toward the dust-cloud, came shortly to a  small stream and a green grass-plot, and stopped there long enough to  throw the pack off Sunfish, unsaddle Smoky and stake them both out to  graze. Stopper he saddled, then knelt and washed his face, beat the  travel dust off his hat, untied his rope and coiled it carefully,  untied his handkerchief and shook it as clean as he could and knotted it  closely again. One might have thought he was preparing to meet a girl;  but the habit of neatness dated back to his pink-apron days and beyond,  the dirt and dust meant discomfort.    When he mounted Stopper and loped away toward the dust-cloud, he rode  hopefully, sure of himself, carrying his range credentials in his eyes,  in his perfect saddle-poise, in the tan on his face to his eyebrows, and  the womanish softness of his gloved hands, which had all the sensitive  flexibility of a musician.    His main hope was that the outfit was working short-handed; and when he  rode near enough to distinguish the herd and the riders, he grinned his  satisfaction.    \"Good cow-country, by the look of that bunch of cattle,\" He observed  to himself. \"And eight men is a small crew to work a herd that size. I  guess I'll tie onto this outfit. Stopper, you'll maybe get a chance to  turn a cow this afternoon.\"    Just how soon the chance would come, Bud had not realized. He had no  more than come within shouting distance of the herd when a big, rollicky  steer broke from the milling cattle and headed straight out past him,  running like a deer. Stopper, famed and named for his prowess with just  such cattle, wheeled in his tracks and lengthened his stride to a run.    \"Tie 'im down!\" someone yelled behind Bud. And \"Catch 'im and tie 'im  down!\" shouted another.    For answer Bud waved his hand, and reached in his pocket for his knife.  Stopper was artfully circling the steer,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17249"],[0,"Added Upon (#10)"],[1,"was made up of strange thoughts and  experiences. The landscape, the stopping at the stations, the coming and  going of people, Hr. Bogstad's letter, the folks at home, the uncertain  future,--all seemed to mingle and to form one chain of thought, which  ended only when the train rolled into the glass-covered station at  Christiania.    With a firm grasp on her valise, she picked her way through the crowd  with its noise and bustle, and placed herself safely in the care of a  hackman, who soon set her down at her lodgings.    At the steamship office she learned that the steamer was not to sail for  three days. So Signe meant to see what she could of the city. It was her  first visit to the capital, and perhaps her last. She would make the  best of her time. She had no friends in the city, but that did not  hinder her from walking out alone. In the afternoon of the second day,  Signe went to the art gallery, and that was the end of her sightseeing  to other parts. She lingered among the paintings of the masters and the  beautiful chiseled marble--the first she had seen--until the attendant  reminded her that it was time to close.    That evening the landlady informed her that a visitor had been inquiring  for her during the day, a gentleman. Who could it be? He was described,  and then Signe knew that it was Hr. Bogstad. He had said that he could  call again in the evening.    Signe was troubled. What should she do? He was following her, but they  must not meet. It would do no good. The steamer was to sail tomorrow,  and she would go on board that night. She called a carriage and was  driven to the wharf. Yes, it was all right, said the steward, and she  was made comfortable for the night.    Among the crowd of people that came to see the steamer sail, Signe  thought she caught sight of Hr. Bogstad elbowing through the throng to  get to the ship. But he was too late. The third bell had rung, the  gangplank was being withdrawn, and the vessel was slowly moving away.  Signe had concealed herself among the people, but now she pressed to the  railing and waved her handkerchief with the rest.    Farewell to Norway, farewell to home and native land. Signe's heart was  full. All that day she sat on deck. She had no desire for food, and the  crowded steerage had no attractions. So she sat, busy with her thoughts  and the sights about the beautiful Christiania fjord.    Early the next morning they steamed into Christiansand, and a few hours  later, the last of Norway's rocky coast sank below the waters of the  North Sea.    All went well for a week. Signe had not suffered much from seasickness,  but now a storm was surely coming. Sailors were busy making everything  snug and tight; and the night closed in fierce and dark, with the sea  spray sweeping the deck.    Signe staggered down into the dimly lighted steerage. Most of the poor  emigrants had crawled into their bunks, and were rolling back and forth  with each lurch of the ship. Signe sat and talked with a Danish girl,  each clinging to a post.    \"I don't feel like going to bed,\" said the girl.    \"Nor I. What a night it is!\"    \"Do you think we shall get safely across?\"    \"Why, certainly,\" replied Signe. \"You mustn't be frightened at a  storm.\"    \"I try not to be afraid, but I'm such a coward.\"    \"Think about something pleasant, now,\" suggested the other. \"Remember  where you're going and whom you are going to meet.\"    The girl from Denmark had confided to Signe that she was going to join  her lover in America.    The girl tried to smile, and Signe continued: \"What a contrast between  us. I am running away; you are going to meet someone--\"    Crash! A blow struck the ship and shook it from end to end; and  presently the machinery came to a full stop. Then there was hurrying of  feet on deck, and they could hear the boatswain's shrill pipe, and the  captain giving commands. The steerage was soon a scene of terror. Those  who rushed up the stairs were met with fastened doors, and were  compelled to remain below. Women screamed and prayed and raved. Then the  steward came in, and informed them that there was no danger, and the  scene somewhat quieted down. On further inquiry it was learned that they  had collided with another ship. Some damage had been done forward, but  there was no further danger. However, very few slept that night, and  when morning broke, clear and beautiful, with glad hearts they rushed up  into the open air.    The second class was forward. Three of the passengers had been killed  and quite a number injured.    If Signe had not been so poor, and had not refused help from Hr.  Bogstad, she would have taken second class passage. But now, thank God  for being poor and--independent!    In another week they landed at New York, and each went her own way.  Signe Dahl took the first train for Chicago.          VII.      \"The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away.\"--_Job 1:22_.      The news startled the young city of Willowby from the Honorable Mayor to  the newest comer in the place. The railroad company had found a shorter  route to its northern main line, and it had been decided to remove, or,  at least, to abandon for a time, the road running through the valley.  The short cut would save fifty miles of roadbed and avoid some heavy  grades, but it would leave the town of Willowby twenty-five miles from  the railroad. Everybody said it would be a death-blow to the place.  Petitions and propositions from the citizens to the railroad company  availed nothing.    The most diresome predictions came true. After the change, the life of  the young town seemed to wither away. Its business almost ceased. The  speculator whose tenement houses were without roof, hurriedly closed  them in, and so let them stand. Safer is the farmer, in such times. His  fields will still yield the same, let stocks and values in real estate  rise and fall as they will.    Alderman Rupert Ames had been attending the protracted meetings of the  city council; this, with other business, kept him away from home for a  week. This was the explanation which he gave to his mother when he at  last came home.    \"Rupert,\" she said to him, \"you must not worry so. I see you are  sick--you're as pale as death now. Is there anything the matter, my  boy?\"    Rupert seated himself on the sofa, resting his face in his hands, and  looked into the fire. He was haggard and pale.    \"Mother--yes, mother, something's the matter but I cannot tell you, I  cannot tell you.\"    The mother sank beside him. \"Rupert, what is it, are you sick?\"    \"No, dear mother, I'm not sick--only at heart.\" He put his arms around  her neck and resting his head on her shoulder, began to sob.    It had been a long time since she had seen her boy shed tears.    \"Mother,\" he sprang to his feet and forced himself to talk, \"I must tell  you. The bank has failed and--and--I have not always told you of my  business transactions, mother. I now owe more than we are worth in this  world. I have been investing in real estate. I paid a big price for the  Riverside Addition, and the paper I asked you to sign was a mortgage on  the farm to secure a loan. Mother, I thought it was a good investment,  and it would have been had the railroad remained, but now property has  sunk so low that all we own will not pay my debts. And the bank has  failed also--O mother!\"    \"My son, do not carry on like that. If the worst comes, we still have  the farm, haven't we?\"    \"You do not understand, mother; our creditors can take that, too.\"    Then she also broke down, and at sight of her tears the son gained  control of his own feelings, and tried to comfort his mother. She should  never want as long as he had two strong hands with which to work, he  assured her. All would be right in the end. \"What I have done, I can do  again, mother; and though if it comes to the worst, it will be hard, I  am young yet, and have life before me.\"    For an hour they sat on the sofa with their arms around each other,  talking and planning; and then when they became silent, the pictures  they saw in the glowing coals partook of a log house, a dreary sagebrush  plain, and the building of canals and reservoirs.    The worst did come. They could, perhaps, have retained a part of Ames  farm, but they decided to give up everything, pay their debts, and face  the world honorably. So, before Christmas, everything had been cleared  up, and Widow Ames was installed in a neat three-roomed house nearer  town, for which they paid a monthly rental.    Miss Virginia Wilton was on a visit to her \"folks in the East.\" Rupert  both longed and feared for her return. In his letters he had said  nothing about the change in his affairs. He would wait until her return,  and then he would explain it fully to her. He had decided, for her sake,  to propose to her the postponement of their marriage until spring. He  would certainly be better prepared then. It would be a sacrifice on his  part, but Virginia would be wise enough to see its advisability. Yes,  they would counsel together, and Virginia's love would be the power to  hold him up. After all, the world was not so dark with such a girl as  Virginia Wilton waiting to become his wife.    The day after her return to Willowby, Rupert called on her. Mrs. Worth,  the landlady, responded to his knock, and said that Virginia had gone  out for the day. She was, however, to give him this note if he called.    Rupert took the paper and turned away. He would find her at some  neighbor's. He carefully broke the envelope and read:      _Dear Mr. Ames_:      As I have accepted a position to teach in another state, I shall    have to leave Willowby tomorrow. I shall be too busy to see you, and    you have too much good sense to follow me. Forget the past. With    kindest regards, I am,                _Virginia Wilton_.           *       *       *       *       *    Nina was married on the first of the year. Widow Ames died about two  weeks"]]]
