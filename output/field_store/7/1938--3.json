Pursuant to these calls there met in Philadelphia in September  of that year the first Continental Congress, composed of delegates from  12 colonies. On October 14, 1774, the assembly adopted what has come to  be known as the Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental  Congress. In that instrument, addressed to His Majesty and to the people  of Great Britain, there was embodied a statement of rights and  principles, many of which were later to be incorporated in the  Declaration of Independence and the Federal Constitution.[a]    This Congress adjourned in October with a recommendation that another  Congress be held in Philadelphia the following May. Before its successor  met, the battle of Lexington had been fought. In Massachusetts the  colonists had organized their own government in defiance of the royal  governor and the Crown. Hence, by general necessity and by common  consent, the second Continental Congress assumed control of the \"Twelve  United Colonies\", soon to become the \"Thirteen United Colonies\" by the  cooperation of Georgia. It became a _de facto_ government: it called  upon the other colonies to assist in the defense of Massachusetts; it  issued bills of credit; it took steps to organize a military force, and  appointed George Washington commander in chief of the Army.    While the declaration of the causes and necessities of taking up arms of  July 6, 1775,[b] expressed a \"wish\" to see the union between Great  Britain and the colonies \"restored\", sentiment for independence was  growing. Finally, on May 15, 1776, Virginia instructed her delegates to  the Continental Congress to have that body \"declare the united colonies  free and independent States.\"[c] Accordingly on June 7 a resolution was  introduced in Congress declaring the union with Great Britain dissolved,  proposing the formation of foreign alliances, and suggesting the  drafting of a plan of confederation to be submitted to the respective  colonies.[d] Some delegates argued for confederation first and  declaration afterwards. This counsel did not prevail. Independence was  declared on July 4, 1776; the preparation of a plan of confederation was  postponed. It was not until November 17, 1777, that the Congress was  able to agree on a form of government which stood some chance of being  approved by the separate States. The Articles of Confederation were then  submitted to the several States, and on July 9, 1778, were finally  approved by a sufficient number to become operative.    Weaknesses inherent in the Articles of Confederation became apparent  before the Revolution out of which that instrument was born had been  concluded.

Going hence,  however, would look like taking part against the late Revolution, and I  am not only unauthorized in this respect, but I am bound to suppose that  if the great majority of the nation adhere to the new form, the United  States will approve thereof; because, in the first place, we have no  right to prescribe to this country the government they shall adopt,  and next, because the basis of our own Constitution is the indefeasible  right of the people to establish it.    Among those who are leaving Paris is the Venetian ambassador. He was  furnished with passports from the Office of Foreign Affairs, but he  was, nevertheless, stopped at the barrier, was conducted to the Hotel  de Ville, was there questioned for hours, and his carriages examined and  searched. This violation of the rights of ambassadors could not fail, as  you may suppose, to make an impression. It has been broadly hinted to me  that the honor of my country and my own require that I should go away.  But I am of a different opinion, and rather think that those who give  such hints are somewhat influenced by fear. It is true that the position  is not without danger, but I presume that when the President did me the  honor of naming me to this embassy, it was not for my personal pleasure  or safety, but to promote the interests of my country. These, therefore,  I shall continue to pursue to the best of my judgment, and as to  consequences, they are in the hand of God.    He remained there until his successor arrived. When all others fled, he  was faithful, and such conduct should never be forgotten. Mr. Morris  not only risked his life, but he took a heavy responsibility, and laid  himself open to severe attack for having protected defenseless people  against the assaults of the mob. But his courageous humanity is  something which should ever be remembered, and ought always to be  characteristic of the men who represent the United States in foreign  countries. When we recall the French Revolution, it is cheering to think  of that fearless figure of the American minister, standing firm and calm  in the midst of those awful scenes, with sacked palaces, slaughtered  soldiers, and a bloodstained mob about him, regardless of danger to  himself, determined to do his duty to his country, and to those to whom  his country was indebted.

It is difficult to conceive that there ever was a time when the United  States paid a money tribute to anybody. It is even more difficult to  imagine the United States paying blackmail to a set of small piratical  tribes on the coast of Africa. Yet this is precisely what we once did  with the Barbary powers, as they were called the States of Morocco,  Tunis, Tripoli, and Algiers, lying along the northern coast of Africa.  The only excuse to be made for such action was that we merely followed  the example of Christendom. The civilized people of the world were then  in the habit of paying sums of money to these miserable pirates,  in order to secure immunity for their merchant vessels in the  Mediterranean. For this purpose Congress appropriated money, and  treaties were made by the President and ratified by the Senate. On one  occasion, at least, Congress actually revoked the authorization of some  new ships for the navy, and appropriated more money than was required  to build the men-of-war in order to buy off the Barbary powers. The fund  for this disgraceful purpose was known as the \"Mediterranean fund,\" and  was intrusted to the Secretary of State to be disbursed by him in his  discretion. After we had our brush with France, however, in 1798, and  after Truxtun's brilliant victory over the French frigate L'Insurgente  in the following year, it occurred to our government that perhaps  there was a more direct as well as a more manly way of dealing with the  Barbary pirates than by feebly paying them tribute, and in 1801 a small  squadron, under Commodore Dale, proceeded to the Mediterranean.    At the same time events occurred which showed strikingly the absurdity  as well as the weakness of this policy of paying blackmail to pirates.  The Bashaw of Tripoli, complaining that we had given more money to  some of the Algerian ministers than we had to him, and also that we had  presented Algiers with a frigate, declared war upon us, and cut down the  flag-staff in front of the residence of the American consul. At the same  time, and for the same reason, Morocco and Tunis began to grumble at the  treatment which they had received. The fact was that, with nations as  with individuals, when the payment of blackmail is once begun there is  no end to it. The appearance, however, of our little squadron in the  Mediterranean showed at once the superiority of a policy of force over  one of cowardly submission. Morocco and Tunis immediately stopped their  grumbling and came to terms with the United States, and this left us  free to deal with Tripoli.    Commodore Dale had sailed before the declaration of war by Tripoli was  known, and he was therefore hampered by his orders, which permitted  him only to protect our commerce, and which forbade actual hostilities.  Nevertheless, even under these limited orders, the Enterprise, of  twelve guns, commanded by Lieutenant Sterrett, fought an action with the  Tripolitan ship Tripoli, of fourteen guns. The engagement lasted three  hours, when the Tripoli struck, having lost her mizzenmast, and with  twenty of her crew killed and thirty wounded. Sterrett, having no orders  to make captures, threw all the guns and ammunition of the Tripoli  overboard, cut away her remaining masts, and left her with only one spar  and a single sail to drift back to Tripoli, as a hint to the Bashaw of  the new American policy.    In 1803 the command of our fleet in the Mediterranean was taken by  Commodore Preble, who had just succeeded in forcing satisfaction  from Morocco for an attack made upon our merchantmen by a vessel from  Tangier. He also proclaimed a blockade of Tripoli and was preparing  to enforce it when the news reached him that the frigate Philadelphia,  forty-four guns, commanded by Captain Bainbridge, and one of the best  ships in our navy, had gone upon a reef in the harbor of Tripoli, while  pursuing a vessel there, and had been surrounded and captured, with all  her crew, by the Tripolitan gunboats, when she was entirely helpless  either to fight or sail. This was a very serious blow to our navy and to  our operations against Tripoli. It not only weakened our forces, but it  was also a great help to the enemy. The Tripolitans got the Philadelphia  off the rocks, towed her into the harbor, and anchored her close under  the guns of their forts. They also replaced her batteries, and prepared  to make her ready for sea, where she would have been a most formidable  danger to our shipping.    Under these circumstances Stephen Decatur, a young lieutenant in command  of the Enterprise, offered to Commodore Preble to go into the harbor and  destroy the Philadelphia. Some delay ensued, as our squadron was driven  by severe gales from the Tripolitan coast; but at last, in January,  1804, Preble gave orders to Decatur to undertake the work for which  he had volunteered. A small vessel known as a ketch had been recently  captured from the Tripolitans by Decatur, and this prize was now named  the Intrepid, and assigned to him for the work he had in hand. He took  seventy men from his own ship, the Enterprise, and put them on the  Intrepid, and then, accompanied by Lieutenant Stewart in the Siren, who  was to support him, he set sail for Tripoli. He and his crew were very  much cramped as well as badly fed on the little vessel which had been  given to them, but they succeeded, nevertheless, in reaching Tripoli in  safety, accompanied by the Siren.    For nearly a week they were unable to approach the harbor, owing to  severe gales which threatened the loss of their vessel; but on February  16 the weather moderated and Decatur determined to go in. It is well to  recall, briefly, the extreme peril of the attack which he was about to  make. The Philadelphia, with forty guns mounted, double-shotted, and  ready for firing, and manned by a full complement of men, was moored  within half a gunshot of the Bashaw's castle, the mole and crown  batteries, and within range of ten other batteries, mounting,  altogether, one hundred and fifteen guns. Some Tripolitan cruisers, two  galleys, and nineteen gunboats also lay between the Philadelphia and the  shore. Into the midst of this powerful armament Decatur had to go with  his little vessel of sixty tons, carrying four small guns and having a  crew of seventy-five men.    The Americans, however, were entirely undismayed by the odds against  them, and at seven o'clock Decatur went into the harbor between the  reef and shoal which formed its mouth. He steered on steadily toward the  Philadelphia, the breeze getting constantly lighter, and by half-past  nine was within two hundred yards of the frigate. As they approached  Decatur stood at the helm with the pilot, only two or three men showing  on deck and the rest of the crew lying hidden under the bulwarks. In  this way he drifted to within nearly twenty yards of the Philadelphia.  The suspicions of the Tripolitans, however, were not aroused, and when  they hailed the Intrepid, the pilot answered that they had lost their  anchors in a gale, and asked that they might run a warp to the frigate  and ride by her.
