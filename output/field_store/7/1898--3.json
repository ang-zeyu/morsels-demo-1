[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17575"],[0,"How to Camp Out (#10)"],[1," the trouble of making them.    The poles should be nine feet and four or five inches long. If they are  too long at first, sink the ends in the ground, and do not cut them off  until the tent has stretched all that it will.    In permanent camp a \"fly\" over the tent is almost indispensable for  protection from the heat and pelting rains. It should be as long as the  roof of the tent, and project at least a foot beyond the eaves. The  guy-lines should be a foot or more longer than those of the tent, so  that the pins for the fly may be driven some distance outside those of  the tent, and thus lift the fly well off the roof.      CLOTH FOR TENTS.    For convenience we have supposed all of the tents to be made of heavy  drilling. Many tent-makers consider this material sufficiently strong,  and some even use it to make tents larger than the United States army  wall-tent. My own experience leads me to recommend for a wall-tent a  heavier cloth, known to the trade as \"eight-ounce Raven's\" duck,[20]  because drilling becomes so thin after it has been used two or three  seasons that a high wind is apt to tear it.    The cost of the cloth is about the same as the value of the labor of  making the tent; but the difference between the cost of drilling and  eight-ounce duck for a wall-tent of four breadths with a fly is only  three to four dollars, and the duck tent will last nearly twice as long  as the one of drilling. For these reasons it seems best not to put your  labor into the inferior cloth.    Before you use the tent, or expose to the weather any thing made of  cotton cloth, you should wash it thoroughly in strong soap-suds, and  then soak it in strong brine; this takes the sizing and oil out of the  cloth, and if repeated from year to year will prevent mildew, which soon  spoils the cloth. There are mixtures that are said to be better still,  but a tent-maker assures me that the yearly washing is better than any  thing applied only once. Some fishermen preserve their sails by soaking  them in a solution of lime and water considerably thinner than  whitewash. Others soak them in a tanner's vat; but the leather-like  color imparted is not pleasing to the eye. Weak lime-water they say does  not injure cotton; but it ruins rope and leather, and some complain that  it rots the thread.    It will save strain upon any tent, to stay it in windy weather with  ropes running from the iron pins of the upright poles (which should  project through the ridgepole and top of the tent) to the ground in  front and rear of the tent. A still better way is to run four ropes from  the top--two from each pole-pin--down to the ground near the tent-pins  of the four corner guy-lines. The two stays from the rear pole should  run toward the front of the tent; and the two front stays toward the  rear, crossing the other two. The tent is then stayed against a wind  from any quarter, and the stays and guy-lines are all together on the  sides of the tent.    Loosen the stays and guy-lines a little at night or when rain is  approaching, so as to prevent them from straining the tent by shrinking.    Around the bottom of any tent you should dig a small trench to catch and  convey away the water when it rains; and I caution you against the  error which even old campers sometimes make,--do not try to have the  water run up hill.      HOW TO PITCH A WALL-TENT QUICKLY.    After you have once pitched the tent, and have put the poles and pins in  their exact places, note the distance from one of the upright poles to  the pin holding one of the nearest corner guy-lines, and then mark one  of the poles in such a way that you can tell by it what that distance  is. When you next wish to pitch the tent, drive two small pins in the  ground where the two upright poles are to rest,--the ridgepole will tell  you how far apart they must be,--then, by measuring with your marked  pole, you can drive the four pins for the corner guys in their proper  places.    Next spread the tent on the ground, and put the ridgepole in its place  in the top of the tent, and the two upright poles in their places. Then  raise the tent. It will take two persons, or, if the tent is large, four  or more, having first moved it bodily, to bring the feet of the upright  poles to touch the two small pins that you drove at the beginning. You  can now catch and tighten the corner guy-lines on the four pins  previously driven. In driving the other pins, it looks well to have them  on a line, if possible; also try to have the wall of the tent set  square: to do this you must tie the door just right before you tighten a  guy-line.    You will find this way of pitching a tent convenient when a wind is  blowing, or when your assistant is not a strong person. If the wind is  very high, spread your tent to windward, and catch the windward  guy-lines before raising the tent. You will thus avoid having it blown  over.      TENT-POLES.    As tent-poles are not expensive, you may find it convenient to have two  sets for each tent; one stout set for common use, and a lighter set to  take when transportation is limited. Sound spruce, free from large knots  and tolerably straight-grained, makes good poles; pine answers as well,  but is more expensive.    The upright poles of a stout set for a wall-tent of the United States  Army pattern should be round or eight-sided, and about two inches in  diameter.[21] If you prefer to have them square, round off the edges, or  they will be badly bruised upon handling. Drive a stout iron pin[22]  seven or eight inches long into the centre of the top until it projects  only about three and a half or four inches, or enough to go through the  ridgepole and an inch beyond. It will be necessary to bore a hole in the  pole before driving in the pin, to prevent splitting. A ferrule is also  serviceable on this end of the pole.    The ridgepole should be well rounded on the edges, and be about two and  a half inches wide and two inches thick. If made of stuff thinner than  an inch and a half, it should be wider in the middle than above stated,  or the pole will sag. Bore the holes to receive the pins of the uprights  with an auger a size larger than the pins, so that they may go in and  out easily: these holes should be an inch and a half from the ends.  Ferrules or broad bands are desirable on the ends of the ridgepole; but  if you cannot afford these you may perhaps be able to put a rivet or two  through the pole between the ends and the holes, or, if not rivets, then  screws, which are better than nothing to prevent the pin of the upright  from splitting the ridgepole.      TENT-PINS.    Tent-pins should be made of sound hard wood; old wheel-spokes are  excellent. Make them pointed at the bottom, so that they will drive  easily; and notch them about two inches from the top, so that they will  hold the rope. Cut away the wood from just above the notch towards the  back of the head; this will prevent the notch of the pin from splitting  off when it is driven. It is well to have pins differ in length and  size: those for the corners and the stays should be the largest, say  fifteen to eighteen inches long; and those for the wall and door may be  eight or ten inches. But pins of these sizes are apt to pull out in a  heavy storm; and so when you are to camp in one spot for some time, or  when you see a storm brewing, it is well to make pins very stout, and  two feet or more long, for the stays and four corner guy-lines, out of  such stuff as you find at hand.    [Illustration]    Loosen the pins by striking them on all four sides before you try to  pull them up. A spade is a fine thing to use to pry out a pin that is  deep in the ground, and a wooden mallet is better than an axe or hatchet  to drive them in with; but, unless you have a large number of pins to  drive, it will hardly pay you to get a mallet especially for this  business.    Make a stout canvas bag to hold the tent-pins; and do not fold them  loose with the tent, as it soils and wears out the cloth.      BEST SIZE OF TENTS.    The majority of people who go into permanent camp prefer tents  considerably larger than the army wall-tent; but, unless your camp is  well sheltered from the wind, you will have constant and serious  troubles during every gale and thunder-storm, if you are in a large or  high tent. A large tent is certainly more comfortable in fine weather;  but you can make a small one sufficiently cheerful, and have a sense of  security in it that you cannot feel in one larger. But, if you will have  a large tent, make it of something heavier than drilling.    If you have two tents of the same height, you can connect the tops with  a pole, and throw a fly, blanket, or sheet over it on pleasant days.    Do not pack away a tent when it is damp if you can possibly avoid it, as  it will mildew and decay in a few days of warm weather. If you are  compelled to pack it when very damp, you can prevent decay by salting it  liberally inside and out.    Before you put away your tent for the season be sure that it is  perfectly dry, and that the dead flies and grasshoppers are swept out of  the inside. You should have a stout bag to keep it in, and to prevent  its being chafed and soiled when it is handled and carried. You will  find a hundred good uses for the bag in camp.    FOOTNOTES:    [12] You cannot find this sort of duck in the market now, but \"heavy  drilling\" 29-1/2 inches wide is nearly as strong, and will make a good  tent.    [13] Tents made of heavy drilling were also furnished to the troops, the  dimensions of which varied a trifle from those here given: they had the  disadvantage of two seams instead of one.    [14] If the party is of four, or even five, a shelter-tent made of three  breadths of heavy drilling will accommodate all. _Sew_ one end-piece to  each half-tent, since sewing is better than buttoning, and the last is  not necessary when your party will always camp together.

Mantua, which possessed prodigious natural advantages, and into which  the retreating general had flung a garrison of full 15,000 men, was, in  truth, the last and only Italian possession of the imperial crown,  which, as it seemed, there might still be a possibility of saving.  Beaulieu anxiously waited the approach of new troops from Germany, to  attempt the relief of this great city; and his antagonist, eager to  anticipate the efforts of the imperial government, sat down immediately  before it.    Mantua lies on an island, being cut off on all sides from the main land  by the branches of the Mincio, and approachable only by five narrow  causeways, of which three were defended by strong and regular fortresses  or entrenched camps, the other two by gates, drawbridges, and batteries.  Situated amidst stagnant waters and morasses, its air is pestilential,  especially to strangers. The garrison were prepared to maintain the  position with their usual bravery; and it remained to be seen whether  the French general possessed any new system of attack, capable of  abridging the usual operations of the siege, as effectually as he had  already done by those of the march and the battle. His commencement was  alarming: of the five causeways, by sudden and overwhelming assaults, he  obtained four; and the garrison were cut off from the main land, except  only at the fifth causeway, the strongest of them all, named, from a  palace near it, _La Favorita_. It seemed necessary, however, in order  that this blockade might be complete, that the Venetian territory, lying  immediately beyond Mantua, should be occupied by the French. The power  of this ancient government was no longer such as to inspire much  respect, and Buonaparte resolved that the claim of neutrality should  form no obstacle to his measures. The French Directory had already most  ungenerously trampled on the dignity of Venice, by demanding that she  should no longer afford a retreat to the illustrious exile, the Count of  Provence, eldest surviving brother of Louis XVI.[9] That unfortunate  prince had, accordingly, though most reluctantly, been desired to quit  the Venetian states, and had already passed to the Rhine, where his  gallant cousin, the Prince of Conde, had long been at the head of a  small and devoted army composed of the expatriated gentry of France.  Buonaparte, however, chose to treat the reluctance with which Venice had  been driven to this violation of her hospitality, as a new injury to his  government: he argued that a power who had harboured in friendship, and  unwillingly expelled, the _Pretender_ to the French monarchy, had lost  all title to forbearance on the part of the Revolutionary forces. This  was a gross and ungenerous insult, and it was a gratuitous one; for he  had a far better argument behind. The imperial general had, as we have  seen, neglected the reclamations of the Doge, when it suited his purpose  to occupy Peschiera. \"You are too weak,\" said Buonaparte, when the  Venetian envoy reached his headquarters, \"to enforce neutrality on  hostile nations such as France and Austria. Beaulieu did not respect  your territory when his interest bade him violate it; nor shall I  hesitate to occupy whatever falls within the line of the Adige.\" In  effect, garrisons were placed forthwith in Verona, and all the strong  places of that domain. The tricolor flag now waved at the mouth of the  Tyrolese passes; and Napoleon, leaving Serrurier to blockade Mantua,  returned to Milan, where he had important business to arrange.    The King of Naples, utterly confounded by the successes of the French,  was now anxious to procure peace, almost on whatever terms, with the  apparently irresistible Republic. Nor did it, for the moment, suit  Buonaparte's views to contemn his advances. A peace with this prince  would withdraw some valuable divisions from the army of Beaulieu; and  the distance of the Neapolitan territory was such, that the French had  no means of carrying the war thither with advantage, so long as Austria  retained the power of sending new forces into Italy by the way of the  Tyrol. He concluded an armistice accordingly, which was soon followed by  a formal peace, with the King of the Two Sicilies; and the Neapolitan  troops, who had recently behaved with eminent gallantry, abandoning the  Austrian general, began their march to the south of Italy.    This transaction placed another of Napoleon's destined victims entirely  within his grasp. With no friend behind him, the Pope saw himself at the  mercy of the invader; and in terror prepared to submit. Buonaparte  occupied immediately his legations of Bologna and Ferrara, making  prisoners in the latter of these towns four hundred of the papal troops,  and a cardinal, under whose orders they were. The churchman militant was  dismissed on parole; but, being recalled to headquarters, answered that  his master, the Pope, had given him a dispensation to break his promise.  This exercise of the old dispensing power excited the merriment of the  conquerors. The Vatican, meanwhile, perceived that no time was to be  lost. The Spanish resident at the Roman court was despatched to Milan;  and the terms on which the holy father was to obtain a brief respite  were at length arranged. Buonaparte demanded and obtained a million  sterling, a hundred of the finest pictures and statues in the papal  gallery, a large supply of military stores, and the cession of Ancona,  Ferrara, and Bologna, with their respective domains.    He next turned his attention to the grand duke of Tuscany,--a prince who  had not only not taken any part in the war against the Republic, but had  been the very first of the European rulers to recognise its  establishment, and had kept on terms of friendship with all its  successive authorities. Buonaparte, however, in pursuance of his system,  resolved that the brother of the emperor should pay for his presumed  inclinations. For the present, the Florentine museum and the grand  duke's treasury were spared; but Leghorn, the seaport of Tuscany and  great feeder of its wealth, was seized without ceremony; the English  goods in that town were confiscated to the ruin of the merchants; and a  great number of English vessels in the harbour made a narrow escape. The  grand duke, in place of resenting these injuries, was obliged to receive  Buonaparte with all the appearances of cordiality at Florence; and the  spoiler repaid his courtesy by telling him, rubbing his hands with glee,  during the princely entertainment provided for him, \"I have just  received letters from Milan; the citadel has fallen;--your brother has  no longer a foot of land in Lombardy.\" \"It is a sad case,\" said Napoleon  himself long afterwards--speaking of these scenes of exaction and  insolence,--\"it is a sad case when the dwarf comes into the embrace of  the giant; he is like enough to be suffocated--but 'tis the giant's  nature to squeeze hard.\"    In the meantime the general did not neglect the great and darling plan  of the French government, of thoroughly revolutionising the North of  Italy, and establishing there a group of Republics modelled after their  own likeness, and prepared to act as subservient allies in their mighty  contest with the European monarchies. The peculiar circumstances of  Northern Italy, as a land of ancient fame and high spirit, long split  into fragments, and ruled, for the most part, by governors of German  origin, presented many facilities for the realisation of this design;  and Buonaparte was urged constantly by his government at Paris, and by  a powerful party in Lombardy, to hasten its execution. He, however, had  by this time learned to think of many idols of the Directory with about  as little reverence as they bestowed on the shrines of Catholicism; in  his opinion more was to be gained by temporising with both the  governments and the people of Italy, than by any hasty measures of the  kind recommended. He saw well the deep disgust which his exactions had  excited. \"You cannot,\" said he, \"at one and the same moment rob people  and persuade them you are their friends.\" He fancied, moreover, that the  Pope and other nerveless rulers of the land might be converted into at  least as convenient ministers of French exaction, as any new  establishments he could raise in their room. Finally he perceived that  whenever the Directory were to arrange seriously the terms of a  settlement with the great monarchy of Austria, their best method would  be to restore Lombardy, and thereby purchase the continued possession of  the more conveniently situated territories of Belgium and the  Luxembourg. The general, therefore, temporised; content, in the  meantime, with draining the exchequers of the governments, and cajoling  from day to day the population. The Directory were with difficulty  persuaded to let him follow his own course; but he now despised their  remonstrances, and they had been taught effectually to dread his  strength.    Napoleon, it is clear enough, had no intention to grant these Italian  governments anything but a respite; nor is it to be doubted that their  disposition to take part with Austria remained as it had been before  they entered into these treaties with France. That the purpose of deceit  was mutual, affords, however, no plea of justification--least of all to  the stronger party. \"It will be well,\" says Sir Walter Scott, \"with the  world, when falsehood and finesse are as thoroughly exploded in  international communication as they are among individuals in civilised  countries.\"    [Footnote 9: The same who became afterwards Louis XVIII. of France.]          CHAPTER VI         Wurmser supersedes Beaulieu--Jourdan and Moreau march into Germany,       and are forced to retreat again--The Austrians advance from the       Tyrol--Battle of Lonato--Escape of Napoleon--Battle near       Castiglione--Wurms"]]]
