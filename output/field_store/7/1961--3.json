Also, I don't care to finish up at the place they may have chosen for  us.\" He tilted his chin to study the sky. \"We'll take watches and rest  in turn. No use trying anything until it is dark--unless they start to  move in. You take the first one?\"    As Rynch nodded, Hume edged back into a crevice as a shelled creature  withdrawing to natural protection, going to sleep as easily as if he  could control that state by will. Rynch, watching him curiously for a  second or two before climbing up to a position from which he judged he  could see all sides of their refuge, determined not to be surprised.    The watchers were crouched down, waiting with that patience which had  impressed him from his first sight of the camp sentries back in the  forest. There was no movement, no sound. They were simply there--on  guard. And Rynch did not believe that the darkness of night would  bring any relaxation of that vigilance.    He leaned back, feeling the grit of the rocky surface against his bare  back and shoulders. Under his hand was the most efficient and  formidable weapon known to the frontier worlds, from this post he  could keep the enemy under surveillance and think.    Hume had had him planted here, in the first place, provided with the  memory of Rynch Brodie--the reward for him was to be a billion  credits. Too much staff work had gone into his conditioning for just a  small stake.    So Rynch Brodie was on Jumala, and Hume had come with witnesses to  find him. Another part of his mind stood aloof now, applauding the  clearness of his reasoning. Rynch Brodie was to be discovered a  castaway on Jumala. Only, matters had not worked out according to  Hume's plan. In the first place he was certain he had not been  intended to know that he was not Rynch Brodie. For a fleeting second  he wondered why that conditioning had not completely worked, then went  back to the problem of his relationship with Hume.    No, the Out-Hunter had expected a castaway who would be just what he  ordered. Then this affair of the watchers--creatures the Guild men had  not found here a few months ago--Rynch felt a small cold chill along  his spine. Hume's game was one thing, something he could understand,  but the silent beasts were another and somehow far more disturbing  threat.    Rynch edged forward, watching the mist on the water, his brain  striving to solve this other puzzle as neatly as he thought he had  discovered the reason for his scrambled memories and his being on  Jumala.    The mist was an added danger. Thick enough and those watchers could  move in under its curtain. A needler was efficient, yes, but it could  wipe out only an enemy at which it was aimed. Blind cross sweeping  with its darts would only exhaust the clip without results, save by  lucky chance.    On the other hand, suppose they could turn that same gray haze to  their own advantage--use it to blanket their withdrawal? He was about  to go to Hume with that suggestion when he sighted the new move in  their odd battle with the aliens.    A wink of light--two more--blinking, following the erratic course by  the pull of the stream. All bobbing along toward the rugged coastline  of the islet. Those had appeared out of nothingness as suddenly as the  globes when this chase had begun.    The globes and the winking lights on the water connected in his mind,  argued new danger. Rynch took careful aim, fired a dart at one which  had grounded on the pointed tip of the rocks where the river current  came together after its division about the island. For the first time  Rynch realized those things below were moving _against_ the  current--they had come upstream as if propelled.    He had fired and the light was still there, two more coming in behind  it, so that now there was an irregular cluster of them. And there was  activity on the water-washed rocks before them. Just as the scavengers  had moved ahead of the globes on land, so now aquatic creatures had  come out of the river, were flopping higher on the islet. And those  lights were changing color--from white to reddish-yellow.    Rynch scrabbled with one hand in a rock crevice, found a stone he had  noted earlier. He hurled that at the cluster of lights. There was a  puff of brilliant red, one was gone. Something flopping on the rocks  gave a mewling cry and somersaulted back into the water. Then a finger  of mist drew between Rynch and the lights which were now only faint,  glowing patches. He swung down from his perch, shook Hume awake.    The Out-Hunter made that instant return to full consciousness which  was another defense for the men who live long on the rim of wild  worlds.    \"What--?\"    Rynch pulled him forward. The mist had thickened, but there were more  of those ominous lights at water level, spreading down both sides of  the point, forming a wall. Dark forms moved out of the water ahead of  them, flopping on the rocks, pressing higher, towards the ledge where  the men stood.    \"Those globes--I think they're moving in the river now.\" Rynch found  another stone, took careful aim, and smashed a second one. \"The  needler has no effect on them,\" he reported. \"Stones do--but I don't  know why.\"    They searched about them in the crevices for more ammunition, laying  up a line of fist-sized rocks, while the lights gathered in, spreading  farther and farther down the shores of the islet. Hume cried out  suddenly, and aimed his ray tube below. The lance of its blast cut the  dark as might a bolt of lightning.    With a shrill squeal, a blot shadow detached from the slope  immediately below them. A vile, musky scent, now mingled with the  stench of burning flesh, set them coughing.    \"Water spider!\" Hume identified. \"If they are driving those out and up  at....\"    He fumbled at his equipment belt and then tossed an object downward to  disintegrate in a shower of fiery sparks. Wherever those sparks  touched rock or ground they flared up in tall thin columns of fire,  lighting up the nightmare on the rocks and up the ledges.    Rynch fired the needler, Hume's ray tube flashed and flashed again.  Things squealed, or grunted, or died silently, while clawing to reach  the upper ledges. He could not be sure of the nature of some of those  things. One, armed and clawed as the scavengers, was nearly as large  as a water-cat. And a furry, man-legged creature, with a double-jawed  head, bore also a ring of phosphorescent eyes set in a complete circle  about its skull. They were alien life routed out of the water.    \"The lights--smash the lights!\" Hume ordered.    Rynch understood. The lights had driven these attackers out of the  river. Put out the lights and the boiling broth of water dwellers  might conceivably return to their homes. He dropped the needler, took  up stones and set about the business of finishing off as many of the  lights as he could.    Hume fired into the crawling mass, pausing only once to send another  of those flame bombs crashing to illuminate the scene. The water  creatures bewildered, clumsy out of their element, were so far at his  mercy. But their numbers, in spite of the piling dead, were still a  dangerous threat.    Rynch tore gapping holes in that line of lights. But he could see,  through the mist, more floating sparks, gathering to take their  places, perhaps herding before them more water things to attack.  Except for those few gaps he had wrought, the islet was now completely  enveloped.    \"Ahhhh--\" Hume's voice arose in a roar of anger and defiance. He  stabbed his ray down at a spot just below their ledge. A huge  segmented, taloned leg kicked, caught on the edge of the stone at the  level of their feet, twisted aloft again and was gone.    \"Up!\" Hume ordered. \"To the top!\"    Rynch caught up two handsful of stones, holding them to his chest with  his left arm as he made a last cast to see one light puff out in  answer. Then they both scrambled on to that small platform at the top  of the islet. By the aid of the burning flame-torches the Hunter had  set, they could see that most of the rocky slopes below them now  squirmed with a horrible mass of water life.    Where Hume had fired his ray there was fierce activity, as the living  feasted on the slain and quarreled over the bounty. But from other  quarters the crawling advance pressed on.    \"I have only one more flame flare,\" Hume stated.    One more flare--then they would be in the dark with the mist hiding  the forward-moving enemy.    \"I wonder if they are watching out there?\" Rynch scowled into the  dark.    \"They--or what sent them. They know what they are doing.\"    \"You mean they must have done this before?\"    \"I think so. That L-B back there--it made a good landing, and there  are supplies missing from its lockers.\"    \"Which you removed--\" Rynch countered.    \"No. There might have been real castaways landed here. Not that we  found any trace of them. Now I can guess why--\"    \"But you Guild men were here, and you didn't run into this!\"    \"I know.\" Hume sounded baffled. \"Not a sign then.\"    Rynch threw the last of his stones, heard it clink harmlessly against  a rock. Hume balanced an object on the palm of his hand.    \"Last flare!\"    \"What's that? Over there?\"    Rynch had sighted the flashing out of the dark from the river bank,  making a pattern of flickers which bore no relation to the infernal  lights at the water's edge.    Hume's ray tube pointed skyward as he answered with a series of short  bursts.    \"Take cover!\" The call came weirdly out over the water, the tone  dehumanized. Hume cupped his mouth with one hand, shouted back:    \"We're on top--no cover.\"    \"Then flatten down--we're blasting!\"    They flattened, lay almost in each other's arms, curled on that narrow  space. Even through his closed eyelids Rynch caught the flash of  vivid, man-made lightning crashing first on one side of the islet and  then on the other, and sweeping every crawling horror out of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19098"],[0,"Christmas in Ritual and Tradition, Christian and Pagan (#10)"],[1,"_Ubi?

They set forth the great paradox of the Incarnation:--       \"Little babe who art so great,        Child so young who art so old, |70|      In the manger small his room,        Whom not heaven itself could hold.

A. Campbell. It begins:--       \"Sing hey the Gift, sing ho the Gift,      Sing hey the Gift of the Living,      Son of the Dawn, Son of the Star,      Son of the Planet, Son of the Far [twice],      Sing hey the Gift, sing ho the Gift.\"{28}    [Illustration:    THE FLIGHT INTO EGYPT: THE REST BY THE WAY    MASTER OF THE SEVEN SORROWS OF MARY (ALSO ATTRIBUTED TO JOACHIM PATINIR)    (_Vienna: Imperial Gallery_)]    [Illustration:    SINGING \"VOM HIMMEL HOCH\" FROM A CHURCH TOWER AT CHRISTMAS.    _By Ludwig Richter._]    Before I close this study with a survey of Christmas poetry in England  after the Reformation, it may be interesting to follow the developments  in Protestant Germany. The Reformation gave a great impetus to German  religious song, and we owe to it some of the finest of Christmas hymns.  It is no doubt largely due to Luther, that passionate lover of music and  folk-poetry, that hymns have practically become the liturgy of German  Protestantism; yet he did but give typical expression to the natural  instincts of his countrymen for song. Luther, though a rebel, was no  Puritan; we can hardly call him an iconoclast; he had a conservative  mind, which only gradually became loosened from its old attachments. His  was an essentially artistic nature: \"I would fain,\" he said, \"see all  arts, especially music, in the service of Him who has given and created  them,\" and in the matter of hymnody he continued, in many respects, the  mediaeval German tradition. Homely, kindly, a lover of children, he had a  deep feeling for the festival of Christmas; and not only did he translate  into German \"A solis ortus cardine\" and \"Veni, redemptor |71| gentium,\"  but he wrote for his little son Hans one of the most delightful and  touching of all Christmas hymns--\"Vom Himmel hoch, da komm ich her.\"       \"Vom Himmel hoch, da komm ich her,      Ich bring euch gute neue Maer,      Der guten Maer bring ich so viel,      Davon ich singen und sagen will.        Euch ist ein Kindlein heut gebor'n      Von einer Jungfrau auserkor'n,      Ein Kindelein so zart und fein,      Das soll eu'r Freud und Wonne sein.           *       *       *       *       *        Merk auf, mein Herz, und sich dort hin:      Was liegt doch in dem Kripplein drin?      Wess ist das schoene Kindelein?      Es ist das liebe Jesulein.           *       *       *       *       *        Ach Herr, du Schoepfer aller Ding,      Wie bist du worden so gering,      Dass du da liegst auf duerrem Gras,      Davon ein Rind und Esel ass?           *       *       *       *       *        Ach, mein herzliebes Jesulein,      Mach dir ein rein sanft Bettelein,      Zu ruhen in mein's Herzens Schrein,      Dass ich nimmer vergesse dein.           *       *       *       *       *        Davon ich allzeit froehlich sei,      Zu springen, singen immer frei      Das rechte Lied dem Gottessohn      Mit Herzenslust, den suessen Ton.\"[29]{29}    |72| \"Vom Himmel hoch\" has qualities of simplicity, directness, and  warm human feeling which link it to the less ornate forms of carol  literature. Its first verse is adapted from a secular song; its melody  may, perhaps, have been composed by Luther himself. There is another  Christmas hymn of Luther's, too--\"Vom Himmel kam der Engel  Schar\"--written for use when \"Vom Himmel hoch\" was thought too long, and  he also composed additional verses for the mediaeval \"Gelobet seist du,  Jesu Christ.\"       \"Gelobet seist du, Jesu Christ,      Dass du Mensch geboren bist      Von einer Jungfrau, das ist wahr,      Des freuet sich der Engel Schar.                _Kyrieleis!_        Des ew'gen Vaters einig Kind      Jetzt man in der Krippe find't,      In unser armes Fleisch und Blut      Verkleidet sich das ewig Gut.                _Kyrieleis!_ |73|        Den aller Weltkreis nie beschloss,      Der lieget in Marie'n Schoss;      Er ist ein Kindlein worden klein,      Der alle Ding' erhaelt allein.                _Kyrieleis!_\"[30]{31}    The first stanza alone is mediaeval, the remaining six of the hymn are  Luther's.    The Christmas hymns of Paul Gerhardt, the seventeenth-century Berlin  pastor, stand next to Luther's. They are more subjective, more finished,  less direct and forcible. Lacking the finest qualities of poetry, they  are nevertheless impressive by their dignity and heartiness. Made for  music, the words alone hardly convey the full power of these hymns. They  should be heard sung to the old chorales, massive, yet sweet, by the  lusty voices of a German congregation. To English people they are  probably best known through the verses introduced into the \"Christmas  Oratorio,\" where the old airs are given new beauty by Bach's marvellous  harmonies. The tone of devotion, one feels, in Gerhardt and Bach is the  same, immeasurably greater as is the genius of the composer; in both  there is a profound joy in the Redemption begun by the Nativity, a robust  faith joined to a deep sense of the mystery of suffering, and a keen  sympathy with childhood, a tender fondness for the Infant King.    |74| The finest perhaps of Gerhardt's hymns is the Advent \"Wie soll ich  dich empfangen?\" (\"How shall I fitly meet Thee?\"), which comes early in  the \"Christmas Oratorio.\" More closely connected with the Nativity,  however, are the _Weihnachtslieder_, \"Wir singen dir, Emanuel,\" \"O Jesu  Christ, dein Kripplein ist,\" \"Froehlich soll mein Herze springen,\" \"Ich  steh an deiner Krippen hier,\" and others. I give a few verses from the  third:--       \"Froehlich soll mein Herze springen              Dieser Zeit,              Da fuer Freud              Alle Engel singen.      Hoert, hoert, wie mit vollen Choren              Alle Luft              Laute ruft:              Christus ist geboren.           *       *       *       *       *        Nun, er liegt in seiner Krippen,              Ruft zu sich              Mich und dich,              Spricht mit suessen Lippen:      Lasset fahrn, O lieben Brueder              Was euch quaelt,              Was euch fehlt;              Ich bring alles wieder.           *       *       *       *       *        Suesses Heil, lass dich umfangen;              Lass mich dir,              Meine Zier,              Unverrueckt anhangen.      Du bist meines Lebens Leben;              Nun kann ich              Mich durch dich              Wohl zufrieden geben.\"[31]{33}    |75| One more German Christmas hymn must be mentioned, Gerhard  Tersteegen's \"Jauchzet, ihr Himmel, frohlocket, ihr englischen Choere.\"  Tersteegen represents one phase of the mystical and emotional reaction  against the religious formalism and indifference of the eighteenth  century. In the Lutheran Church the Pietists, though they never seceded,  somewhat resembled the English Methodists; the Moravians formed a  separate community, while from the \"Reformed\" or Calvinistic Church  certain circles of spiritually-minded people, who drew inspiration from  the mediaeval mystics and later writers like Boehme and Madame Guyon,  gathered into more or less independent groups for religious intercourse.  Of these last Tersteegen is a representative singer. Here are three  verses from his best known Christmas hymn:--       \"Jauchzet, ihr Himmel, frohlocket, ihr englischen Choere,      Singet dem Herrn, dem Heiland der Menschen, zur Ehre:             Sehet doch da!             Gott will so freundlich und nah             Zu den Verlornen sich kehren. |76|        Koenig der Ehren, aus Liebe geworden zum Kinde,      Dem ich auch wieder mein Herz in der Liebe verbinde;             Du sollst es sein,             Den ich erwaehle allein,             Ewig entsag' ich der Suende.        Treuer Immanuel, werd' auch in mir neu geboren;      Komm doch, mein Heiland, und lass mich nicht laenger verloren;             Wohne in mir,             Mach mich ganz eines mit dir,             Den du zum Leben erkoren.\"[32]{35}    The note of personal religion, as distinguished from theological  doctrine, is stronger in German Christmas poetry than in that of any  other nation--the birth of Christ in the individual soul, not merely the  redemption of man in general, is a central idea.           *       *       *       *       *    We come back at last to England. The great carol period is, as has  already been said, the fifteenth, and the first half of the sixteenth,  century; after the Reformation the English domestic Christmas largely  loses its religious colouring, and the best carols of the late sixteenth  and early seventeenth centuries are songs of |77| feasting and pagan  ceremonies rather than of the Holy Child and His Mother. There is no lack  of fine Christmas"]]]
