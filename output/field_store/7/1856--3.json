On this occasion the toast  was received with extra enthusiasm, for the proposer, Mr. Caingey Thornton,  who was desperately in want of a mount, after going the rounds of the old  laudatory course, alluded to the threatened vapourings of the stranger, and  expressed his firm belief that he would 'meet with his match,' a 'taking of  the bull by the horns,' that met with very considerable favour from the  wine-flushed party, the majority of whom, at that moment, made very  'small,' in their own minds, of the biggest fence that ever was seen.    There is nothing so easy as going best pace over the mahogany.    Mr. Waffles, who was received with considerable applause, and patting of  the table, responded to the toast in his usual felicitous style, assuring  the company that he lived but for the enjoyment of their charming society,  and that all the money in the world would be useless, if he hadn't Laverick  Wells to spend it in. With regard to the vapourings of a 'certain  gentleman,' he thought it would be very odd if some of them could not take  the shine out of him, observing that 'Brag' was a good dog, but 'Holdfast'  was a better, with certain other sporting similes and phrases, all  indicative of showing fight. The steam is soon got up after dinner, and as  they were all of the same mind, and all agreed that a gross insult had  been offered to the hunt in general, and themselves in particular, the only  question was, how to revenge it. At last they hit upon it. Old Slocdolager,  the late master of the hunt, had been in the habit of having Tom Towler,  the huntsman, to his lodgings the night before hunting, where, over a glass  of gin-and-water, they discussed the doings of the day, and the general  arrangements of the country.    Mr. Waffles had had him in sometimes, though for a different purpose--at  least, in reality for a different purpose, though he always made hunting  the excuse for sending for him, and that purpose was, to try how many  silver foxes' heads full of port wine Tom could carry off without tumbling,  and the old fellow being rather liquorishly inclined, had never made any  objection to the experiment. Mr. Waffles now wanted him, to endeavour,  under the mellowing influence of drink, to get him to enter cordially into  what he knew would be distasteful to the old sportsman's feelings, namely,  to substitute a 'drag' for the legitimate find and chase of the fox.  Fox-hunting, though exciting and exhilarating at all times, except,  perhaps, when the 'fallows are flying,' and the sportsman feels that in all  probability, the further he goes the further he is left  behind--Fox-hunting, we say, though exciting and exhilarating, does not,  when the real truth is spoken, present such conveniences for neck-breaking,  as people, who take their ideas from Mr. Ackermann's print-shop window,  imagine. That there are large places in most fences is perfectly true; but  that there are also weak ones is also the fact, and a practised eye catches  up the latter uncommonly quick. Therefore, though a madman may ride at the  big places, a sane man is not expected to follow; and even should any one  be tempted so to do, the madman having acted pioneer, will have cleared the  way, or at all events proved its practicability for the follower.    In addition to this, however, hounds having to smell as they go, cannot  travel at the ultra steeple-chase pace, so opposed to 'looking before you  leap,' and so conducive to danger and difficulty, and as going even at a  fair pace depends upon the state of the atmosphere, and the scent the fox  leaves behind, it is evident that where mere daring hard riding is the  object, a fox-hunt cannot be depended upon for furnishing the necessary  accommodation. A drag-hunt is quite a different thing. The drag can be made  to any strength; enabling hounds to run as if they were tied to it, and can  be trailed so as to bring in all the dangerous places in the country with a  certain air of plausibility, enabling a man to look round and exclaim, as  he crams at a bullfinch or brook, 'he's leading us over a most desperate  country--never saw such fencing in all my life!' Drag-hunting, however, as  we said before, is not popular with sportsmen, certainly not with huntsmen,  and though our friends with their wounded feelings determined to have one,  they had yet to smooth over old Tom to get him to come into their views.  That was now the difficulty.          CHAPTER VIII    OLD TOM TOWLER      [Illustration]    There are few more difficult persons to identify than a huntsman in  undress, and of all queer ones perhaps old Tom Towler was the queerest. Tom  in his person furnished an apt illustration of the right appropriation of  talent and the fitness of things, for he would neither have made a groom,  nor a coachman, nor a postillion, nor a footman, nor a ploughman, nor a  mechanic, nor anything we know of, and yet he was first-rate as a huntsman.  He was too weak for a groom, too small for a coachman, too ugly for a  postillion, too stunted for a footman, too light for a ploughman, too  useless-looking for almost anything.    Any one looking at him in 'mufti' would exclaim, 'what an unfortunate  object!' and perhaps offer him a penny, while in his hunting habiliments  lords would hail him with, 'Well, Tom, how are you?' and baronets ask him  'how he was?' Commoners felt honoured by his countenance, and yet, but for  hunting, Tom would have been wasted--a cypher--an inapplicable sort of man.  Old Tom, in his scarlet coat, black cap, and boots, and Tom in his  undress--say, shirt-sleves, shorts, grey stockings and shoes, bore about  the same resemblance to each other that a three months dead jay nailed to a  keeper's lodge bears to the bright-plumaged bird when flying about. On  horseback, Tom was a cockey, wiry-looking, keen-eyed, grim-visaged,  hard-bitten little fellow, sitting as though he and his horse were all one,  while on foot he was the most shambling, scambling, crooked-going crab that  ever was seen. He was a complete mash of a man. He had been scalped by the  branch of a tree, his nose knocked into a thing like a button by the kick  of a horse, his teeth sent down his throat by a fall, his collar-bone  fractured, his left leg broken and his right arm ditto, to say nothing of  damage to his ribs, fingers, and feet, and having had his face scarified  like pork by repeated brushings through strong thorn fences.    But we will describe him as he appeared before Mr. Waffles, and the  gentlemen of the Laverick Wells Hunt, on the night of Mr. Sponge's arrival.  Tom's spirit being roused at hearing the boastings of Mr. Leather, and  thinking, perhaps, his master might have something to say, or thinking,  perhaps, to partake of the eleemosynary drink generally going on in large  houses of public entertainment, had taken up his quarters in the bar of the  'Imperial,' where he was attentively perusing the 'meets' in _Bell's Life_,  reading how the Atherstone met at Gopsall, the Bedale at Hornby, the  Cottesmore at Tilton Wood, and so on, with an industry worthy of a better  cause; for Tom neither knew country, nor places, nor masters, nor hounds,  nor huntsmen, nor anything, though he still felt an interest in reading  where they were going to hunt. Thus he sat with a quick ear, one of the  few undamaged organs of his body, cocked to hear if Tom Towler was asked  for; when a waiter dropping his name from the landing of the staircase to  the hall porter, asking if anybody had seen anything of him, Tom folded up  his paper, put it in his pocket, and passing his hand over the few  straggling bristles yet sticking about his bald head, proceeded, hat in  hand, upstairs to his master's room.    His appearance called forth a round of view halloos! Who-hoops! Tally-ho's!  Hark forwards! amidst which, and the waving of napkins, and general noises,  Tom proceeded at a twisting, limping, halting, sideways sort of scramble up  the room. His crooked legs didn't seem to have an exact understanding with  his body which way they were to go; one, the right one, being evidently  inclined to lurch off to the side, while the left one went stamp, stamp,  stamp, as if equally determined to resist any deviation.    At length he reached the top of the table, where sat his master, with the  glittering Fox's head before him. Having made a sort of scratch bow, Tom  proceeded to stand at ease, as it were, on the left leg, while he placed  the late recusant right, which was a trifle shorter, as a prop behind. No  one, to look at the little wizen'd old man in the loose dark frock, baggy  striped waistcoat, and patent cord breeches, extending below where the  calves of his bow legs ought to have been, would have supposed that it was  the noted huntsman and dashing rider, Tom Towler, whose name was celebrated  throughout the country. He might have been a village tailor, or sexton, or  barber; anything but a hero.    'Well, Tom,' said Mr. Waffles, taking up the Fox's head, as Tom came to  anchor by his side, 'how are you?'    'Nicely, thank you, sir,' replied Tom, giving the bald head another sweep.    Mr. Waffles.--'What'll you drink?'    Tom.--'Port, if you please, sir.'    'There it is for you, then,' said Mr. Waffles, brimming the Fox's head,  which held about the third of a bottle (an inn bottle at least), and  handing it to him.    'Gentlemen all,' said Tom, passing his sleeve across his mouth, and  casting a side-long glance at the company as he raised the cup to drink  their healths.    He quaffed it off at a draught.    'Well, Tom, and what shall we do to-morrow?' asked Mr. Waffles, as Tom  replaced the Fox's head, nose uppermost, on the table.    [Illustration: OLD TOM TOWLER]    'Why, we must draw Ribston Wood fust, I s'pose,' replied Tom, 'and then on  to Bradwell Grove, unless you thought well of tryin' Chesterton Common on "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16960"],[0,"History of the United States (#10)"],[1,"they were even covertly tolerated, they pressed steadily in, until,  by the Revolution, they outnumbered the adherents of the established  order.    The Church was also sanctioned by law and supported by taxes in the  Carolinas after 1704, and in Georgia after that colony passed directly  under the crown in 1754--this in spite of the fact that the majority of  the inhabitants were Dissenters. Against the protests of the Catholics  it was likewise established in Maryland. In New York, too,  notwithstanding the resistance of the Dutch, the Established Church was  fostered by the provincial officials, and the Anglicans, embracing about  one-fifteenth of the population, exerted an influence all out of  proportion to their numbers.    Many factors helped to enhance the power of the English Church in the  colonies. It was supported by the British government and the official  class sent out to the provinces. Its bishops and archbishops in England  were appointed by the king, and its faith and service were set forth by  acts of Parliament. Having its seat of power in the English monarchy, it  could hold its clergy and missionaries loyal to the crown and so  counteract to some extent the independent spirit that was growing up in  America. The Church, always a strong bulwark of the state, therefore had  a political role to play here as in England. Able bishops and far-seeing  leaders firmly grasped this fact about the middle of the eighteenth  century and redoubled their efforts to augment the influence of the  Church in provincial affairs. Unhappily for their plans they failed to  calculate in advance the effect of their methods upon dissenting  Protestants, who still cherished memories of bitter religious conflicts  in the mother country.    =Puritanism in New England.=--If the established faith made for imperial  unity, the same could not be said of Puritanism. The Plymouth Pilgrims  had cast off all allegiance to the Anglican Church and established a  separate and independent congregation before they came to America. The  Puritans, essaying at first the task of reformers within the Church,  soon after their arrival in Massachusetts, likewise flung off their yoke  of union with the Anglicans. In each town a separate congregation was  organized, the male members choosing the pastor, the teachers, and the  other officers. They also composed the voters in the town meeting, where  secular matters were determined. The union of church and government was  thus complete, and uniformity of faith and life prescribed by law and  enforced by civil authorities; but this worked for local autonomy  instead of imperial unity.    The clergy became a powerful class, dominant through their learning and  their fearful denunciations of the faithless. They wrote the books for  the people to read--the famous Cotton Mather having three hundred and  eighty-three books and pamphlets to his credit. In cooeperation with the  civil officers they enforced a strict observance of the Puritan  Sabbath--a day of rest that began at six o'clock on Saturday evening and  lasted until sunset on Sunday. All work, all trading, all amusement, and  all worldly conversation were absolutely prohibited during those hours.  A thoughtless maid servant who for some earthly reason smiled in church  was in danger of being banished as a vagabond. Robert Pike, a devout  Puritan, thinking the sun had gone to rest, ventured forth on horseback  one Sunday evening and was luckless enough to have a ray of light strike  him through a rift in the clouds. The next day he was brought into court  and fined for \"his ungodly conduct.\" With persons accused of witchcraft  the Puritans were still more ruthless. When a mania of persecution swept  over Massachusetts in 1692, eighteen people were hanged, one was pressed  to death, many suffered imprisonment, and two died in jail.    Just about this time, however, there came a break in the uniformity of  Puritan rule. The crown and church in England had long looked upon it  with disfavor, and in 1684 King Charles II annulled the old charter of  the Massachusetts Bay Company. A new document issued seven years later  wrested from the Puritans of the colony the right to elect their own  governor and reserved the power of appointment to the king. It also  abolished the rule limiting the suffrage to church members, substituting  for it a simple property qualification. Thus a royal governor and an  official family, certain to be Episcopalian in faith and monarchist in  sympathies, were forced upon Massachusetts; and members of all religious  denominations, if they had the required amount of property, were  permitted to take part in elections. By this act in the name of the  crown, the Puritan monopoly was broken down in Massachusetts, and that  province was brought into line with Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New  Hampshire, where property, not religious faith, was the test for the  suffrage.    =Growth of Religious Toleration.=--Though neither the Anglicans of  Virginia nor the Puritans of Massachusetts believed in toleration for  other denominations, that principle was strictly applied in Rhode  Island. There, under the leadership of Roger Williams, liberty in  matters of conscience was established in the beginning. Maryland, by  granting in 1649 freedom to those who professed to believe in Jesus  Christ, opened its gates to all Christians; and Pennsylvania, true to  the tenets of the Friends, gave freedom of conscience to those \"who  confess and acknowledge the one Almighty and Eternal God to be the  creator, upholder, and ruler of the World.\" By one circumstance or  another, the Middle colonies were thus early characterized by diversity  rather than uniformity of opinion. Dutch Protestants, Huguenots,  Quakers, Baptists, Presbyterians, New Lights, Moravians, Lutherans,  Catholics, and other denominations became too strongly intrenched and  too widely scattered to permit any one of them to rule, if it had  desired to do so. There were communities and indeed whole sections where  one or another church prevailed, but in no colony was a legislature  steadily controlled by a single group. Toleration encouraged diversity,  and diversity, in turn, worked for greater toleration.    The government and faith of the dissenting denominations conspired with  economic and political tendencies to draw America away from the English  state. Presbyterians, Quakers, Baptists, and Puritans had no hierarchy  of bishops and archbishops to bind them to the seat of power in London.  Neither did they look to that metropolis for guidance in interpreting  articles of faith. Local self-government in matters ecclesiastical  helped to train them for local self-government in matters political. The  spirit of independence which led Dissenters to revolt in the Old World,  nourished as it was amid favorable circumstances in the New World, made  them all the more zealous in the defense of every right against  authority imposed from without.      SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES    =Religion and Local Schools.=--One of the first cares of each Protestant  denomination was the education of the children in the faith. In this  work the Bible became the center of interest. The English version was  indeed the one book of the people. Farmers, shopkeepers, and artisans,  whose life had once been bounded by the daily routine of labor, found in  the Scriptures not only an inspiration to religious conduct, but also a  book of romance, travel, and history. \"Legend and annal,\" says John  Richard Green, \"war-song and psalm, state-roll and biography, the mighty  voices of prophets, the parables of Evangelists, stories of mission  journeys, of perils by sea and among the heathen, philosophic arguments,  apocalyptic visions, all were flung broadcast over minds unoccupied for  the most part by any rival learning.... As a mere literary monument, the  English version of the Bible remains the noblest example of the English  tongue.\" It was the King James version just from the press that the  Pilgrims brought across the sea with them.    For the authority of the Established Church was substituted the  authority of the Scriptures. The Puritans devised a catechism based upon  their interpretation of the Bible, and, very soon after their arrival in  America, they ordered all parents and masters of servants to be diligent  in seeing that their children and wards were taught to read religious  works and give answers to the religious questions. Massachusetts was  scarcely twenty years old before education of this character was  declared to be compulsory, and provision was made for public schools  where those not taught at home could receive instruction in reading and  writing.    [Illustration: A PAGE FROM A FAMOUS SCHOOLBOOK           A In ADAM'S Fall         We sinned all.         B Heaven to find,         The Bible Mind.

F The judgment made         FELIX afraid.]        Outside of New England the idea of compulsory education was not regarded  with the same favor; but the whole land was nevertheless dotted with  little schools kept by \"dames, itinerant teachers, or local parsons.\"  Whether we turn to the life of Franklin in the North or Washington in  the South, we read of tiny schoolhouses, where boys, and sometimes  girls, were taught to read and write. Where there were no schools,  fathers and mothers of the better kind gave their children the rudiments  of learning. Though illiteracy was widespread, there is evidence to show  that the diffusion of knowledge among the masses was making steady  progress all through the eighteenth century.    =Religion and Higher Learning.=--Religious motives entered into the  establishment of colleges as well as local schools. Harvard, founded in  1636, and Yale, opened in 1718, were intended primarily to train  \""]]]
