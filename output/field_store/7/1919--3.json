THE COMING OF THE SIBYL      The Rome of the first consuls was a very different Rome from that of the  earlier kings. Not only was the population larger but it was divided  socially into different classes. The simple patriarchal one-class  community had been transformed into the complex structure of a society  which had in it virtually all those elements and interests, except the  more strictly intellectual ones, which go to make up what we call  society in the modern sense. The world of the gods also had increased in  population, and there too there was present a slight social distinction  between the old gods (_Indigetes_) and the new-comers (_Novensides_),  though it is open to question how strongly this distinction was felt.  The new gods thus far were not incommensurable with the old ones. They  formed a tolerably harmonious circle, and there was not felt to be any  need of new priesthoods; the old priests were sufficient to look after  them all. There were a few new names, and a few new temples or altars,  but everything was in the old spirit, and there was no rivalry between  the old and the new. None of the old gods was crowded into the  background by the new-comers. This was on the face of it impossible as  yet, because the new gods all represented new ideas which had not been  provided for under the old scheme. Even Diana, who afterwards usurped  somewhat the functions of Juno, stood at present pre-eminently for the  political idea pure and simple, so far as Rome was concerned. This  period of equipoise did not continue very long, but while it lasted it  was beyond doubt the best and strongest period in the whole history of  Roman religion. There was no violent religious enthusiasm, but then  there was no corresponding depression offsetting it. It was the cold but  conscientious formalism which was best adapted to the Roman character,  because so long as it held sway the excesses of superstition were  avoided.    But this element of superstition was already on the way, it came in  within a few years of the opening of the republic, and it exercised its  insidious influence ever more and more powerfully until it celebrated  its wildest orgies in the time of the Second Punic War. It is in this  period of the first three centuries of the republic, roughly from B.C.  500 to B.C. 200, that this change was produced. Outwardly it resembled a  steady growth in religious feeling and enthusiasm, and it might well  have seemed so to contemporaries. It was a period of many new gods and  many new temples, but this in itself was no harm. It was the principle  behind it which did the damage. It was the essential contradiction to  what true Roman religion and Roman character demanded; and the last half  of the republic paid the price for what the first half had done, in a  decline of faith which has scarcely been exceeded in the world's  history.    It has been customary for writers on the history of Roman morals to  attribute these changes to the coming of Greek influence; and of course  in the main this is correct, but these writers have in general neglected  to analyse this Greek influence more closely, and to distinguish the  various aspects of it in different periods, and to ask and answer the  question why this influence should be so particularly harmful to the  Romans. It is generally spoken of as the influence of Greek literature  and philosophy, but for our present period this is entirely incorrect,  for we all know that Greek literature did not begin to influence Rome  until the time of the Punic wars, and yet the Greek influence of which  we speak here began to exert its effects two hundred and fifty years  before the Punic wars. The real cause of the unnatural stimulation of  religion during these three centuries is nothing more nor less than the  books of the Sibylline oracles. It is therefore a very definite and  interesting problem which we have before us. It is to examine the  workings of these oracles and to explain why they had such an  extraordinary effect on religion and society, that in three centuries  they could entirely change both the form and the content of Roman  religion, and under the guise of increasing its zeal, so sap its  vitality that it required almost two hundred years of human experience  and suffering before true religion was in some sense at least restored  to its own place.    Like the origin of almost all the great religious movements in the  world's history, the beginnings of the Sibylline books are shrouded in  mystery. A later age, for whom history had no secrets, with a cheap  would-be omniscience told of the old woman who visited Tarquin and  offered him nine books for a certain price, and when he refused to pay  it, went away, burned three, and then returning offered him at the  original price the six that were left; on his again refusing she went  away, burned three more and finally offered at the same old price the  three that remained, which he accepted. Except as a sidelight on the  character of the early Greek trader the story is worthless. It is  doubtful even if the presence of the Sibylline books in Rome goes back  beyond the republic. The first dateable use of them was in the year B.C.  496, and there is one little fact connected with them which makes it  probable that they did not come in until the republic had begun. This is  the circumstance that in view of the great secrecy of the books it is  unthinkable that they should ever have been in Rome without especial  guardians, and yet the earliest guardians that we know of were a newly  made priesthood consisting originally of two men, the so-called \"two men  in charge of the sacrifices\" (_IIviri sacris faciundis_). Now the form  of this title is peculiar; it is not a proper name like the titles of  all the other priesthoods. Instead it is built on the plan of the titles  of the special committees appointed by the Senate for administrative  purposes; it bears every mark therefore of having arisen under the  republic, rather than under the kingdom, at a time when the Senate had  the supreme control. So much may be said regarding the time when they  were introduced into Rome; as for the place from which they came, this  was without doubt the Greek colonies of Southern Italy, probably the  oldest and most important of them, Cumae, so famous for its Sibyl. This  was not the first association that Rome had had with Cumae, for in all  probability the worship of Apollo had spread from there into Rome toward  the close of the kingdom. Apollo and the books were connected at Cumae,  for it was Apollo who inspired the Sibyl, and the oracles were his  commands, but it is almost certain that Apollo came to Rome in advance  of the oracles. He came there as a god of healing and was given a sacred  place outside the _pomerium_ in the Campus Martius, on the spot where  later (B.C. 431) a temple was built for him with his sister  Artemis-Diana and their mother Latona. This was the only state temple  that Apollo ever had, until Augustus built the famous one on the  Palatine. It was in the wake of Apollo that the Sibylline books came. As  for the books themselves, they were kept so secret that we cannot expect  to know much about them, but in rare cases where the seriousness of the  exigency warranted it, the Senate permitted the actual publication of  the oracle upon which its action was based, and of the oracles thus  published one or two have been preserved to us. They were of course  written in Greek and were phrased in the ambiguous style which for  obvious reasons was the most advantageous style for oracles. They  commanded the worship of certain specific deities, naturally all of them  Greek, and the performance of certain more or less complicated ritual  acts. When they were received in Rome, they were placed in the temple of  Juppiter Optimus Maximus on the Capitoline in the keeping of their  guardians, the new priesthood of the \"two men in charge of the  sacrifices.\" This committee of two was enlarged to ten in B.C. 367 when  the great compromise between the Patricians and the Plebeians was made,  and the Plebeians were admitted into this one priesthood, with five  representatives. Subsequently Sulla made the number fifteen, which  continued as the official number from that time on, so that the  priesthood is ordinarily called the _Quindecemviri_, even when one of  the older periods is referred to. The real control of the books however  lay in the hands of the Senate. When the Senate saw fit, the priests  were ordered to consult the books, but without this special command even  their guardians dared not approach them. The priests reported to the  Senate what they had found, and the Senate then decreed whatever actions  the oracles commanded. The carrying out of these actions was again in  the charge of the Sibylline priests, who performed the ceremonies  demanded and were for all time to come responsible for the maintenance  of any new cults which might be introduced.    When we see how carefully these oracles were guarded and how  circumspectly their use was hedged about by senatorial control, and when  we think how relatively little harm the use of oracles had wrought in  Greece in all the centuries of her history, it may well seem as if the  statements made in the beginning of this chapter about the havoc caused  by these oracles were grossly exaggerated. But the efforts of the Senate  to safeguard these oracles only prove that the older and wiser men in  the community realised how dangerous they were, and the comparison with  Greece leads to a consideration of certain essential differences between  the Greek and the Roman temperament which made that which was meat for  one into poison for the other.    In the older purer age of Greece the gods were never"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18233"],[0,"Animal Ghosts; Or, Animal Hauntings and the Hereafter (#10)"],[1," of any authentic history of  the spot where the manifestations occurred, such a surmise can be of  little value. Since the phenomena were seen by three people at the same  time, it is quite safe to assume they were objective, but it is  impossible to lay down the law as to whether they were actual phantasms  of the dead--of a woman, child, and Newfoundland dog who had all three  met with some violent end--or phantasms of three living beings, who,  happening to think of that locality at the same time, had projected  their immaterial bodies there simultaneously. But whichever of these  alternatives be true, the same thing holds good in either case, viz.  that the Newfoundland dog had a spirit--and what applies to one dog  should assuredly apply to the generality, if not, indeed, to all.      _Phantom Dog seen on Souter Fell_    Miss Harriet Martineau, in her _English Lakes_, refers to certain  strange phenomena seen from time to time on Souter Fell.    In 1745, for example, a Mr. Wren and his servant saw, simultaneously, a  man and dog pursuing some horses along a razor-like ridge of rocks, on  which it was obviously impossible for any ordinary being to gain a bare  foothold, let alone walk. They watched the figures until the latter  suddenly vanished, when Mr. Wren and his servant, thinking, perhaps, the  man, dog, and horses had really fallen over the cliff, went to look for  them. They searched elsewhere, but despite their vigilance, nothing was  to be found, and convinced at last that what they had seen was something  superphysical, they came away mystified, and no doubt somewhat  frightened.    There is no suggestion to make here other than the manifestations may  have been the phantasms of a man, dog, and horses that at some former  date had been killed, either accidentally or purposely, in or near that  spot.      _The Jumping Ghost_    Mr. George Sinclair, in his work _Satan's Invisible World Discovered_,  gives a detailed account of hauntings in a house in Mary King's Close,  Edinburgh.    The house, at the time Mr. Sinclair writes, was occupied by Mr. Thomas  Coltheart, a law agent. Seated one afternoon at home reading, Mrs.  Coltheart was immeasurably startled at seeing, suspended in mid-air  gazing at her, the head of an old man. She uttered some sort of  exclamation, most probably a cry, and the apparition at once vanished.  Some nights later, when in bed, both she and her husband saw the same  head, which was presently joined by the head of a child, and a long,  naked arm, which tried to catch hold of them.    On another occasion, a member of the Coltheart family was greatly  alarmed by the sudden appearance of a large dog, which leaped on the  chair by her side, and as suddenly disappeared.    Every effort was made to lay the ghosts. Ministers--and one knows how  pious Scotch clergymen are--were called in, but their exhortations,  instead of dispelling or even minimizing the phenomena, only increased  them. It was a case of more prayers, more spooks; which state of  affairs, however complimentary to the ministers' powers of address, was  scarcely as comforting to the Colthearts, who, unable to bear the  strange sights and noises any longer, evacuated the premises. As no  other tenants could be found, the house was eventually pulled down, and  a row of fine modern buildings now occupy the site. As the history of  the place could never be traced with any degree of authenticity, one can  do no more than speculate as to the cause of the disturbances, which, I  am inclined to think, were due to the phantoms of people and animals  that had once actually lived and died there.      _Dogs seen before a Death_    Mrs. Crowe, in her _Night Side of Nature_, mentions the case of a young  lady named P----, who saw a big black dog twice suddenly appear and  disappear by her side, immediately before the death of her mother.    In _The Unseen World_ a story is also told of the phantasm of a big  black dog appearing on the bed of a Cornish child, doomed to die shortly  afterwards, the same dog invariably manifesting itself before the death  of any member of the child's family.    There are so many cases of a similar kind--one hears of them nearly  everywhere one goes--that one is led to believe some of them, at least,  must be true. There is no more reason to believe all ghost-story tellers  are liars, than there is to believe all parsons are liars--and this  being so, additional proof is afforded of the continuation of the dog's  life after death; for these family canine ghosts are more than probably  the phantasms of dogs that once belonged to families--maybe centuries  ago--and met their fate in some cruel and unnatural manner.      _A Dog scared by a Canine Ghost_    A friend of mine, Edward Morgan, had a terrier that was found one  morning, poisoned in a big stone kennel. Soon afterwards this friend  came to me and said, \"I have got a new dog--a spaniel--but nothing will  induce it to enter the kennel in which poor Zack was poisoned. Come and  see!\"    I did so, and what he said was true. Mack (Morgan gave all his dogs  names that rhymed--Zack, Mack, Jack, Tack, and even Whack and Smack),  when carried to the entrance of the kennel, resolutely refused to cross  the threshold, barking, whining, and exhibiting unmistakable symptoms of  fear. I knelt down, and peering into the kennel saw two luminous eyes  and the distinct outlines of a dog's head.    \"Morgan!\" I exclaimed, \"the mystery is easily solved; there's a dog in  here.\"    \"Nonsense!\" Morgan cried, speaking very excitedly.    \"But there is,\" I retorted, \"see for yourself.\"    Morgan immediately bent down and poked his head into the kennel.    \"What rot,\" he said. \"You're having me on, there's nothing here.\"    \"What!\" I cried, \"do you mean to say you can see no dog?\"    \"No!\" he replied, \"there is none!\"    \"Let me look again!\" I said, and kneeling down, I peeped in.    \"Do you mean to say you can't see a dog's face and eyes looking straight  at us?\" I asked.    \"No,\" he answered, \"I can see nothing.\" And to prove to me the truth of  what he said, he fetched a pole and raked about the kennel vigorously  with it. We both, then, tried to make Mack enter, and Morgan at last  caught hold of him and placed him forcibly inside. Mack's terror knew no  limit. He gave one loud howl, and flying out of the kennel with his ears  hanging back, tore past into the front garden, where we left him in  peace. Morgan was still sceptical as to there being anything wrong with  the kennel, but two days later wrote to me as follows:--    \"I must apologize for doubting you the other day. I have just had, what  you declared you saw, corroborated. A friend of my wife's was calling  here this afternoon, and, on hearing of Mack's refusal to sleep in the  kennel, at once said, 'I know what's the matter. It's the smell. Mack  scents the poison which was used to destroy Zack. Have the kennel  thoroughly fumigated, and you'll have no more trouble.' At my wife's  request she went into the yard to have a look at it, and the moment she  bent down, she cried out like you did, 'Why, there's a dog inside--a  terrier!' My wife and I both looked and could see nothing. The lady,  however, persisted, and, on my handing her a stick, struck at the figure  she saw. To her amazement the stick went right through it. Then, and not  till then, did we tell her of your experience. 'Well!' she exclaimed,  'I have never believed in ghosts, but I do so now. I am quite certain  that what I see is the phantom of Zack! How glad I am, because I am at  last assured animals have spirits and can come back to us.'\"    In concluding the accounts of phantasms of dead dogs, let me quote two  cases taken from my work entitled _The Haunted Houses of London_,  published by Mr. Eveleigh Nash, of Fawside House, King Street, Covent  Garden, London, W.C., in 1909. The cases are these:--      _The Phantom Dachshund of W---- St., London, W._    In letter No. 1 my correspondent writes:--    \"Though I am by no means over-indulgent to dogs, the latter generally  greet me very effusively, and it would seem that there is something in  my individuality that is peculiarly attractive to them. This being so, I  was not greatly surprised one day, when in the immediate neighbourhood  of X---- Street, to find myself persistently followed by a rough-haired  dachshund wearing a gaudy yellow collar. I tried to scare it away by  shaking my sunshade at it, but all to no purpose--it came resolutely on;  and I was beginning to despair of getting rid of it, when I came to  X---- Street, where my husband once practised as an oculist. There it  suddenly altered its tactics, and instead of keeping at my heels,  became my conductor, forging slowly ahead with a gliding motion that  both puzzled and fascinated me. I furthermore observed that  notwithstanding the temperature--it was not a whit less than ninety  degrees in the shade--the legs and stomach of the dachshund were covered  with mud and dripping with water. When it came to No. 90 it halted, and  veering swiftly round, eyed me in the strangest manner, just as if it  had some secret it was bursting to disclose. It remained in this  attitude until I was within two or three feet of it--certainly not  more--when, to my unlimited amazement, it absolutely vanished--melted  away into thin air.    \"The iron gate leading to the area was closed, so that there was nowhere  for it to have hidden, and, besides, I was almost bending over it at the  time, as I wanted to read the name on its collar. There being no one  near at hand, I could not obtain a second opinion, and so came away  wondering whether what I had seen was actually a phantasm or a mere  hallucination. No. 90, I might add, judging by the brass plate on the  door, was inhabited by a doctor with an unpronounceable foreign name,\"  etc. etc.    I think one cannot help attaching a great deal of importance to what  this lady says, as her language "]]]
