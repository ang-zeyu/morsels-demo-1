The richer sort, besides the  slaves of both sexes whom they keep for servile uses in their houses,  have men slaves who wait on them abroad, for state; either running by  their horse-sides when they ride out, or to carry them to and fro on  their shoulders in the town when they make short visits near home. Every  gentleman or merchant is provided with things necessary for this sort of  carriage. The main thing is a pretty large cotton hammock of the West  India fashion, but mostly died blue, with large fringes of the same,  hanging down on each side. This is carried on the negroes' shoulders by  the help of a bamboo about 12 or 14 foot long, to which the hammock is  hung; and a covering comes over the pole, hanging down on each side like  a curtain: so that the person so carried cannot be seen unless he  pleases; but may either lie down, having pillows for his head; or may sit  up by being a little supported with these pillows, and by letting both  his legs hang out over one side of the hammock. When he hath a mind to be  seen he puts by his curtain, and salutes everyone of his acquaintance  whom he meets in the streets; for they take a piece of pride in greeting  one another from their hammocks, and will hold long conferences thus in  the street: but then their 2 slaves who carry the hammock have each a  strong well made staff with a fine iron fork at the upper end, and a  sharp iron below, like the rest for a musket, which they stick fast in  the ground and let the pole or bamboo of the hammock rest upon them till  their master's business or the complement is over. There is scarce a man  of any fashion, especially a woman, will pass the streets but so carried  in a hammock. The chief mechanic traders here are smiths, hatters,  shoemakers, tanners, sawyers, carpenters, coopers, etc. Here are also  tailors, butchers, etc., which last kill the bullocks very dexterously,  sticking them at one blow with a sharp-pointed knife in the nape of the  neck, having first drawn them close to a rail; but they dress them very  slovenly. It being Lent when I came hither there was no buying any flesh  till Easter-eve, when a great number of bullocks were killed at once in  the slaughterhouses within the town, men, women and children flocking  thither with great joy to buy, and a multitude of dogs, almost starved,  following them; for whom the meat seemed fittest, it was so lean. All  these tradesmen buy negroes, and train them up to their several  employments, which is a great help to them; and they having so frequent  trade to Angola, and other parts of Guinea, they have a constant supply  of blacks both for their plantations and town. These slaves are very  useful in this place for carriage, as porters; for as here is a great  trade by sea and the landing-place is at the foot of a hill, too steep  for drawing with carts, so there is great need of slaves to carry goods  up into the town, especially for the inferior sort; but the merchants  have also the convenience of a great crane that goes with ropes or  pulleys, one end of which goes up while the other goes down. The house in  which this crane is stands on the brow of the hill towards the sea,  hanging over the precipice; and there are planks set shelving against the  bank from thence to the bottom, against which the goods lean or slide as  they are hoisted up or let down. The negro slaves in this town are so  numerous that they make up the greatest part or bulk of the inhabitants:  every house, as I said, having some, both men and women, of them. Many of  the Portuguese, who are bachelors, keep of these black women for misses,  though they know the danger they are in of being poisoned by them, if  ever they give them any occasion of jealousy. A gentleman of my  acquaintance, who had been familiar with his cookmaid, lay under some  apprehensions from her when I was there. These slaves also of either sex  will easily be engaged to do any sort of mischief; even to murder, if  they are hired to do it, especially in the night; for which reason I kept  my men on board as much as I could; for one of the French king's ships  being here had several men murdered by them in the night, as I was  credibly informed.    OF THE COUNTRY ABOUT BAHIA, ITS SOIL AND PRODUCT.    Having given this account of the town of Bahia I shall next say somewhat  of the country. There is a salt-water lake runs 40 leagues, as I was  told, up the country, north-west from the sea, leaving the town and Dutch  fort on the starboard side. The country all around about is for the most  part a pretty flat even ground, not high, nor yet very low: it is well  watered with rivers, brooks and springs; neither wants it for good  harbours, navigable creeks, and good bays for ships to ride in. The soil  in general is good, naturally producing very large trees of divers sorts,  and fit for any uses. The savannahs also are loaded with grass, herbs,  and many sorts of smaller vegetables; and being cultivated, produce  anything that is proper for those hot countries, as sugarcane, cotton,  indigo, maize, fruit-trees of several kinds, and eatable roots of all  sorts. Of the several kinds of trees that are here I shall give an  account of some, as I had it partly from an inhabitant of Bahia, and  partly from my knowledge of them otherwise, namely sapiera, vermiatico,  comesserie, guitteba, serrie, as they were pronounced to me, three sorts  of mangrove, speckled wood, fustick, cotton-trees of 3 sorts, etc.,  together with fruit trees of divers sorts that grow wild, beside such as  are planted.    ITS TIMBER-TREES; THE SAPIERA, VERMIATICO, COMMESSERIE, GUITTEBA, SERRIE,  AND MANGROVES.    Of timber-trees the sapiera is said to be large and tall; it is very good  timber, and is made use of in building of houses; so is the vermiatico, a  tall straight-bodied tree, of which they make plank 2 foot broad; and  they also make canoes with it. Comesserie and guitteba are chiefly used  in building ships; these are as much esteemed here as oaks are in  England, and they say either sort is harder and more durable than oak.  The serrie is a sort of tree much like elm, very durable in water. Here  are also all the three sorts of mangrove trees, namely the red, the  white, and the black, which I have described. The bark of the red  mangrove is here used for tanning of leather, and they have great  tan-pits for it. The black mangrove grows larger here than in the West  Indies, and of it they make good plank. The white mangrove is larger and  tougher than in the West Indies; of these they make masts and yards for  barks.    THE BASTARD-COCO, ITS NUTS AND CABLES; AND THE SILK-COTTON-TREES.    There grow here wild or bastard coconut-trees, neither so large nor so  tall as the common ones in the East or West Indies. They bear nuts as the  others, but not a quarter so big as the right coconuts. The shell is full  of kernel, without any hollow place or water in it; and the kernel is  sweet and wholesome, but very hard both for the teeth and for digestion.  These nuts are in much esteem for making beads for paternosters, boles of  tobacco pipes and other toys: and every small shop here has a great many  of them to sell. At the top of these bastard coco-trees, among the  branches, there grows a sort of long black thread-like horsehair, but  much longer, which by the Portuguese is called tresabo. Of this they make  cables which are very serviceable, strong and lasting; for they will not  rot as cables made of hemp, though they lie exposed both to wet and heat.  These are the cables which I said they keep in their harbours here, to  let to hire to European ships, and resemble the coir cables.    Here are 3 sorts of cotton-trees that bear silk-cotton. One sort is such  as I have formerly described by the name of the cotton-tree. The other 2  sorts I never saw anywhere but here. The trees of these latter sorts are  but small in comparison of the former, which are reckoned the biggest in  all the West India woods; yet are however of a good bigness and height.  One of these last sorts is not so full of branches as the other of them;  neither do they produce their fruit the same time of the year: for one  sort had its fruit just ripe and was shedding its leaves while the other  sort was yet green, and its fruit small and growing, having but newly  done blossoming; the tree being as full of young fruit as an apple-tree  ordinarily in England. These last yield very large pods, about 6 inches  long and as big as a man's arm. It is ripe in September and October; then  the pod opens and the cotton bursts out in a great lump as big as a man's  head. They gather these pods before they open; otherwise it would fly all  away. It opens as well after it is gathered; and then they take out the  cotton and preserve it to fill pillows and bolsters, for which use it is  very much esteemed: but it is fit for nothing else, being so short that  it cannot be spun. It is of a tawny colour; and the seeds are black, very  round, and as big as a white pea. The other sort is ripe in March or  April. The fruit or pod is like a large apple and very round. The outside  shell is as thick as the top of one's finger. Within this there is a very  thin whitish bag or skin which encloses the cotton. When the cotton-apple  is ripe the outer thick green shell splits itself into 5 equal parts from  stem to tail and drops off, leaving the cotton hanging upon the stem,  only pent up in its fine bag. A day or two afterwards the cotton swells  by the heat of the sun, breaks the bag and bursts out, as big as a man's  head: and then as the wind blows it is by degrees driven away, a little  at a time, out of the bag that still hangs upon the stem, and is  scattered about the fields; the bag soon following the cotton, and the  stem the bag.

He  appointed William Phips to be captain of a vessel, called the Rose Algier,  carrying eighteen guns and ninety-five men. So now he was Captain Phips of  the English navy.    Captain Phips sailed from England in the Rose Algier, and cruised for  nearly two years in the West Indies, endeavoring to find the wreck of the  Spanish ship. But the sea is so wide and deep, that it is no easy matter  to discover the exact spot where a sunken vessel lies. The prospect of  success seemed very small; and most people would have thought that Captain  Phips was as far from having money enough to build a \"fair brick house,\"  as he was while he tended sheep.    The seamen of the Rose Algier became discouraged, and gave up all hope of  making their fortunes by discovering the Spanish wreck. They wanted to  compel Captain Phips to turn pirate. There was a much better prospect,  they thought, of growing rich by plundering vessels, which still sailed  the sea, than by seeking for a ship that had lain beneath the waves full  half a century. They broke out in open mutiny, but were finally mastered  by Phips, and compelled to obey his orders. It would have been dangerous,  however, to continue much longer at sea with such a crew of mutinous  sailors; and, besides, the Rose Algier was leaky and unseaworthy. So  Captain Phips judged it best to return to England.    Before leaving the West Indies, he met with a Spaniard, an old man, who  remembered the wreck of the Spanish ship, and gave him directions how to  find the very spot. It was on a reef of rocks a few leagues from Porto de  la Plata.    On his arrival in England, therefore, Captain Phips solicited the king to  let him have another vessel, and send him back again to the West Indies.  But King James, who had probably expected that the Rose Algier would  return laden with gold, refused to have any thing more to do with the  affair. Phips might never have been able to renew the search, if the Duke  of Albemarle, and some other noblemen had not lent their assistance. They  fitted out a ship and gave the command to Captain Phips. He sailed from  England, and arrived safely at Porto de la Plata, where he took an adze  and assisted his men to build a large boat.    The boat was intended for the purpose of going closer to the reef of rocks  than a large vessel could safely venture. When it was finished, the  Captain sent several men in it, to examine the spot where the Spanish ship  was said to have been wrecked. They were accompanied by some Indians, who  were skilful divers, and could go down a great way into the depths of the  sea.    The boat's crew proceeded to the reef of rocks, and rowed round and round  it, a great many times. They gazed down into the water, which was so  transparent that it seemed as if they could have seen the gold and silver  at the bottom, had there been any of those precious metals there. Nothing,  however, could they see; nothing more valuable than a curious sea shrub,  which was growing beneath the water, in a crevice of the reef of rocks. It  flaunted to and fro with the swell and reflux of the waves, and looked as  bright and beautiful as if its leaves were gold.    \"We won't go back empty-handed,\" cried an English sailor; and then he  spoke to one of the Indian divers. \"Dive down and bring me that pretty sea  shrub there. That's the only treasure we shall find!\"    Down plunged the diver, and soon rose dripping from the water, holding the  sea shrub in his hand. But he had learnt some news at the bottom of the  sea.    \"There are some ship's guns,\" said he, the moment he had drawn breath,  \"some great cannon among the rocks, near where the shrub was growing.\"    No sooner had he spoken, than the English sailors knew that they had found  the very spot where the Spanish galleon had been wrecked so many years  before. The other Indian divers immediately plunged over the boat's side,  and swam headlong down, groping among the rocks and sunken cannon. In a  few moments one of them rose above the water, with a heavy lump of silver  in his arms. That single lump was worth more than a thousand dollars. The  sailors took it into the boat, and then rowed back as speedily as they  could, being in haste to inform Captain Phips of their good luck.    But, confidently as the Captain had hoped to find the Spanish wreck, yet  now that it was really found, the news seemed too good to be true. He  could not believe it till the sailors showed him the lump of silver.    \"Thanks be to God!\" then cries Captain Phips. \"We shall every man of us  make our fortunes!\"    Hereupon the Captain and all the crew set to work, with iron rakes and  great hooks and lines, fishing for gold and silver at the bottom of the  sea. Up came the treasure in abundance. Now they beheld a table of solid  silver, once the property of an old Spanish Grandee. Now they found a  sacramental vessel, which had been destined as a gift to some Catholic  church. Now they drew up a golden cup, fit for the king of Spain to drink  his wine out of. Perhaps the bony hand of its former owner had been  grasping the precious cup, and was drawn up along with it. Now their rakes  or fishing lines were loaded with masses of silver bullion. There were  also precious stones among the treasure, glittering and sparkling, so that  it is a wonder how their radiance could have been concealed.    There is something sad and terrible in the idea of snatching all this  wealth from the devouring ocean, which had possessed it for such a length  of years. It seems as if men had no right to make themselves rich with it.  It ought to have been left with the skeletons of the ancient Spaniards,  who had been drowned when the ship was wrecked, and whose bones were now  scattered among the gold and silver.    But Captain Phips and his crew were troubled with no such thoughts as  these. After a day or two they lighted on another part of the wreck, where  they found a great many bags of silver dollars. But nobody could have  guessed that these were money-bags. By remaining so long in the  salt-water, they had become covered over with a crust which had the  appearance of stone, so that it was necessary to break them in pieces with  hammers and axes. When this was done, a stream of silver dollars gushed  out upon the deck of the vessel.    The whole value of the recovered treasure, plate, bullion, precious  stones, and all, was estimated at more than two millions of dollars. It  was dangerous even to look at such a vast amount of wealth. A sea captain,  who had assisted Phips in the enterprise, utterly lost his reason at the  sight of it. He died two years afterwards, still raving about the  treasures that lie at the bottom of the sea. It would have been better for  this man, if he had left the skeletons of the shipwrecked Spaniards in  quiet possession of their wealth.    Captain Phips and his men continued to fish up plate, bullion, and  dollars, as plentifully as ever, till their provisions grew short. Then,  as they could not feed upon gold and silver any more than old King Midas  could, they found it necessary to go in search of better sustenance. Phips  resolved to return to England. He arrived there in 1687, and was received  with great joy by the Duke of Albemarle and the other English lords, who  had fitted out the vessel. Well they might rejoice; for they took by far  the greater part of the treasure to themselves.    The Captain's share, however, was enough to make him comfortable for the  rest of his days. It also enabled him to fulfil his promise to his wife,  by building a \"fair brick house,\" in the Green Lane of Boston. The Duke of  Albemarle sent Mrs. Phips a magnificent gold cup, worth at least five  thousand dollars. Before Captain Phips left London, King James made him a  knight; so that, instead of the obscure ship-carpenter who had formerly  dwelt among them, the inhabitants of Boston welcomed him on his return, as  the rich and famous Sir William Phips.          Chapter XI      \"Sir William Phips,\" continued Grandfather, \"was too active and  adventurous a man to sit still in the quiet enjoyment of his good fortune.  In the year 1690, he went on a military expedition against the French  colonies in America, conquered the whole province of Acadie, and returned  to Boston with a great deal of plunder.\"    \"Why, grandfather, he was the greatest man that ever sat in the chair!\"  cried Charley.    \"Ask Laurence what he thinks,\" replied Grandfather with a smile. \"Well; in  the same year, Sir William took command of an expedition against Quebec,  but did not succeed in capturing the city. In 1692, being then in London,  King William the Third appointed him governor of Massachusetts. And now,  my dear children, having followed Sir William Phips through all his  adventures and hardships, till we find him comfortably seated in  Grandfather's chair, we will here bid him farewell. May he be as happy in  ruling a people, as he was while he tended sheep!\"    Charley, whose fancy had been greatly taken by the adventurous disposition  of Sir William Phips, was eager to know how he had acted, and what  happened to him while he held the office of governor. But Grandfather had  made up his mind to tell no more stories for the present.    \"Possibly, one of these days, I may go on with the adventures of the  chair,\" said he. \"But its history becomes very obscure just at this point;  and I must search into some old books and manuscripts, before proceeding  further. Besides, it is now a good time to pause in our narrative; because  the new charter, which Sir William Phips brought over from England, formed  a very important epoch in the history of the province.\"    \"Really, Grandfather,\" observed Laurence, \"this seems to be the most  remarkable chair in the world. Its history cannot be told without  intertwining it with the lives of distinguished men, and the great events  that have befallen the country.\"    \"True, Laurence,\" replied"]]]
