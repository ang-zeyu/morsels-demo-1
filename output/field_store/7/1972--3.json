(#10)"],[1,"statute which should be  enacted in contradiction to any article of that charter, cannot have  force or validity.\" But with regard to that important article which  secures personal liberty, so far from attempting at any time any legal  infringement of it, they have corroborated it by six statutes, and put  it out of all doubt and controversy. If in practice it has often been  violated, abuses can never come in the place of rules; nor can any  rights or legal powers be derived from injury and injustice. But the  title of the subject to personal liberty not only is founded on ancient,  and, therefore, the most sacred laws; it is confirmed by the whole  analogy of the government and constitution. A free monarchy in which  every individual is a slave, is a glaring contradiction: and it is  requisite, where the laws assign privileges to the different orders of  the state, that it likewise secure the independence of the members.  If any difference could be made in this particular, it were better to  abandon even life or property to the arbitrary will of the prince; nor  would such immediate danger ensue, from that concession, to the laws  and to the privileges of the people. To bereave of his life a man not  condemned by any legal trial, is so egregious an exercise of tyranny,  that it must at once shock the natural humanity of princes, and convey  an alarm throughout the whole commonwealth. To confiscate a man's  fortune, besides its being a most atrocious act of violence, exposes the  monarch so much to the imputation of avarice and rapacity, that it will  seldom be attempted in any civilized government. But confinement, though  a less striking, is no less severe a punishment; nor is there any spirit  so erect and independent, as not to be broken by the long continuance  of the silent and inglorious sufferings of a jail. The power of  imprisonment, therefore, being the most natural and potent engine of  arbitrary government, it is absolutely necessary to remove it from a  government which is free and legal.    The partisans of the court reasoned after a different manner. The true  rule of government, said they, during any period, is that to which the  people, from time immemorial, have been accustomed, and to which they  naturally pay a prompt obedience. A practice which has ever struck their  senses, and of which they have seen and heard innumerable precedents,  has an authority with them much superior to that which attends maxims  derived from antiquated statutes and mouldy records. In vain do the  lawyers establish it as a principle, that a statute can never be  abrogated by opposite custom; but requires to be expressly repealed by  a contrary statute: while they pretend to inculcate an axiom peculiar to  English jurisprudence, they violate the most established principles of  human nature; and even by necessary consequence reason in contradiction  to law itself, which they would represent as so sacred and inviolable. A  law, to have any authority must be derived from a legislature which has  right. And whence do all legislatures derive their right, but from long  custom and established practice? If a statute contrary to public good  has at any time been rashly voted and assented to, either from the  violence of faction or the inexperience of senates and princes, it  cannot be more effectually abrogated by a train of contrary precedents,  which prove, that by common consent it has been tacitly set aside, as  inconvenient and impracticable. Such has been the case with all those  statutes enacted during turbulent times, in order to limit royal  prerogative, and cramp the sovereign in his protection of the public,  and his execution of the laws. But above all branches of prerogative,  that which is most necessary to be preserved, is the power of  imprisonment. Faction and discontent, like diseases, frequently arise in  every political body; and during these disorders, it is by the salutary  exercise alone of this discretionary power, that rebellions and civil  wars can be prevented. To circumscribe this power, is to destroy its  nature: entirely to abrogate it, is impracticable; and the attempt  itself must prove dangerous, if not pernicious to the public. The  supreme magistrate, in critical and turbulent times, will never,  agreeably either to prudence or duty, allow the state to perish, while  there remains a remedy which, how irregular soever, it is still in his  power to apply. And if, moved by a regard to public good, he employs any  exercise of power condemned by recent and express statute, how greedily,  in such dangerous times, will factious leaders seize this pretence of  throwing on his government the imputation of tyranny and despotism! Were  the alternative quite necessary, it were surely much better for human  society to be deprived of liberty than to be destitute of government.    Impartial reasoners will confess that this subject is not, on both  sides, without its difficulties. Where a general and rigid law is  enacted against arbitrary imprisonment, it would appear that government  cannot, in times of sedition and faction, be conducted but by temporary  suspensions of the law; and such an expedient was never thought of  during the age of Charles.[**period inserted] The meetings of parliament  were too precarious, and their determinations might be too dilatory, to  serve in cases of urgent necessity. Nor was it then conceived, that the  king did not possess of himself sufficient power for the security  and protection of his people, or that the authority of these popular  assemblies was ever to become so absolute, that the prince must always  conform himself to it, and could never have any occasion to guard  against their practices, as well as against those of his other subjects.    Though the house of lords was not insensible to the reasons urged in  favor of the pretensions of the commons, they deemed the arguments  pleaded in favor of the crown still more cogent and convincing. That  assembly seems, during this whole period, to have acted, in the main, a  reasonable and a moderate part; and if their bias inclined a little  too much, as is natural, to the side of monarchy, they were far from  entertaining any design of sacrificing to arbitrary will the liberties  and privileges of the nation. Ashley, the king's serjeant, having  asserted, in pleading before the peers, that the king must sometimes  govern by acts of state as well as by law, this position gave such  offence, that he was immediately committed to prison, and was not  released but upon his recantation and submission.[*] Being, however,  afraid lest the commons should go too far in their projected petition,  the peers proposed a plan of one more moderate, which they recommended  to the consideration of the other house. It consisted merely in a  general declaration, that the Great Charter, and the six statutes  conceived to be explanations of it, stand still in force, to all intents  and purposes; that, in consequence of the charter and the statutes, and  by the tenor of the ancient customs and laws of the realm, every subject  has a fundamental property in his goods, and a fundamental liberty of  his person; that this property and liberty are as entire at present as  during any former period of the English government; that in all common  cases, the common law ought to be the standard of proceedings: \"And in  case that, for the security of his majesty's person, the general safety  of his people, or the peaceable government of the kingdom, the king  shall find just cause, for reasons of state, to imprison or restrain  any man's person, he was petitioned graciously to declare that, within  a convenient time, he shall and will express the cause of the commitment  or restraint, either general or special, and, upon a cause so expressed,  will leave the prisoner immediately to be tried according to the common  law of the land.\"[**]         * Whitlocke, p. 10.         ** State Trials, vol. vii. p. 187. Rushworth, vol. i. p.       548.    Archbishop Abbot was employed by the lords to recommend, in a  conference, this plan of a petition to the house of commons. The  prelate, as was no doubt foreseen, from his known principles, was not  extremely urgent in his applications; and the lower house was fully  convinced that the general declarations signified nothing, and that  the latter clause left their liberties rather in a worse condition than  before. They proceeded, therefore, with great zeal, in framing, the  model of a petition which should contain expressions more precise, and  more favorable to public freedom.    The king could easily see the consequence of these proceedings. Though  he had offered, at the beginning of the session, to give his consent to  any law for the security of the rights and liberties of the people, he  had not expected that such inroads would be made on his prerogative. In  order, therefore, to divert the commons from their intention, he sent  a message, wherein he acknowledged past errors, and promised that  hereafter there should be no just cause of complaint. And he added,  \"That the affairs of the kingdom press him so, that he could not  continue the session above a week or two longer: and if the house be not  ready by that time to do what is fit for themselves, it shall be their  own fault.\"[*] On a subsequent occasion, he asked them, \"Why demand  explanations, if you doubt not the performance of the statutes according  to their true meaning? Explanations will hazard an encroachment upon the  prerogative; and it may well be said, What need a new law to confirm an  old, if you repose confidence in the declarations which his majesty  made to both houses?\"[**] The truth is, the Great Charter and the old  statutes were sufficiently clear in favor of personal liberty: but as  all kings of England had ever, in cases of necessity or expediency, been  accustomed at intervals to elude them; and as Charles, in a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19216"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol. I., Part F. (#10)"],[1,"tself, and when the great force of his people was in some  measure unknown even to themselves, the rival-ship of commerce, not  checked by any other jealousy or apprehension, had in England begotten a  violent enmity against the neighboring republic.    Trade was beginning among the English to be a matter of general concern;  but notwithstanding all their efforts and advantages, their commerce  seemed hitherto to stand upon a footing which was somewhat precarious.  The Dutch, who by industry and frugality were enabled to undersell them  in every market, retained possession of the most lucrative branches of  commerce; and the English merchants had the mortification to find, that  all attempts to extend their trade were still turned, by the vigilance  of their rivals, to their loss and dishonor. Their indignation  increased, when they considered the superior naval power of England;  the bravery of her officers and seamen; her favorable situation, which  enabled her to intercept the whole Dutch commerce. By the prospect of  these advantages, they were strongly prompted, from motives less just  and political, to make war upon the states; and at once to ravish from  them by force what they could not obtain, or could obtain but slowly, by  superior skill and industry.    The careless, unambitious temper of Charles rendered him little capable  of forming so vast a project as that of engrossing the commerce and  naval power of Europe; yet could he not remain altogether insensible  to such obvious and such tempting prospects. His genius, happily turned  towards mechanics, had inclined him to study naval affairs, which, of  all branches of business, he both loved the most and understood the  best. Though the Dutch, during his exile, had expressed towards him  more civility and friendship than he had received from any other foreign  power, the Louvestein or aristocratic faction, which at this time ruled  the commonwealth, had fallen into close union with France; and could  that party be subdued, he might hope that his nephew, the young prince  of Orange, would be reinstated in the authority possessed by his  ancestors, and would bring the states to a dependence under England. His  narrow revenues made it still requisite for him to study the humors  of his people, which now ran violently towards war; and it has been  suspected, though the suspicion was not justified by the event, that  the hopes of diverting some of the supplies to his private use were not  overlooked by this necessitous monarch.    The duke of York, more active and enterprising, pushed more eagerly the  war with Holland. He desired an opportunity of distinguishing himself:  he loved to cultivate commerce: he was at the head of a new African  company, whose trade was extremely checked by the settlements of the  Dutch: and perhaps the religious prejudices by which that prince was  always so much governed, began, even so early, to instil into him  an antipathy against a Protestant commonwealth, the bulwark of the  reformation. Clarendon and Southampton, observing that the nation was  not supported by any foreign alliance, were averse to hostilities; but  their credit was now on the decline.    By these concurring motives, the court and parliament were both of them  inclined to a Dutch war. The parliament was prorogued without voting  supplies: but as they had been induced, without any open application  from the crown, to pass that vote above mentioned against the Dutch  encroachments, it was reasonably considered as sufficient sanction for  the rigorous measures which were resolved on.    Downing, the English minister at the Hague, a man of an insolent,  impetuous temper, presented a memorial to the states, containing a list  of those depredations of which the English complained. It is remarkable,  that all the pretended depreciations preceded the year 1662, when a  treaty of league and alliance had been renewed with the Dutch; and these  complaints were then thought either so ill grounded or so frivolous,  that they had not been mentioned in the treaty. Two ships alone, the  Bonaventure and the Good Hope, had been claimed by the English; and it  was agreed that the claim should be prosecuted by the ordinary course  of justice. The states had consigned a sum of money, in case the cause  should be decided against them; but the matter was still in dependence.  Cary who was intrusted by the proprietors with the management of the  lawsuit for the Bonaventure, had resolved to accept of thirty thousand  pounds, which were offered him; but was hindered by Downing, who told  him that the claim was a matter of state between the two nations, not a  concern of private persons.[*] These circumstances give us no favorable  idea of the justice of the English pretensions.         * Temple, vol. ii, p. 42.    Charles confined not himself to memorials and remonstrances. Sir Robert  Holmes was secretly despatched with a squadron of twenty-two ships to  the coast of Africa. He not only expelled the Dutch from Cape Corse,  to which the English had some pretensions; he likewise seized the Dutch  settlements of Cape Verde and the Isle of Goree, together with several  ships trading on that coast. And having sailed to America, he possessed  himself of Nova Belgia, since called New York; a territory which James  I. had given by patent to the earl of Stirling, but which had never  been planted but by the Hollanders. When the states complained of these  hostile measures, the king, unwilling to avow what he could not well  justify, pretended to be totally ignorant of Holmes's enterprise.  He likewise confined that admiral to the Tower; but some time after  released him.    The Dutch, finding that their applications for redress were likely to be  eluded, and that a ground of quarrel was industriously sought for by  the English, began to arm with diligence. They even exerted, with some  precipitation, an act of vigor which hastened on the rupture. Sir John  Lawson and De Ruyter had been sent with combined squadrons into the  Mediterranean, in order to chastise the piratical states on the coast  of Barbary; and the time of their separation and return was now  approaching. The states secretly despatched orders to De Ruyter, that  he should take in provisions at Cadiz; and sailing towards the coast of  Guinea, should retaliate on the English, and put the Dutch in possession  of those settlements whence Holmes had expelled them. De Ruyter, having  a considerable force on board, met with no opposition in Guinea.      All the new acquisitions of the English, except Cape Corse were  recovered from them. They were even dispossessed of some old  settlements. Such of their ships as fell into his hands were seized by  De Ruyter. That admiral sailed next to America. He attacked Barbadoes,  but was repulsed. He afterwards committed hostilities on Long Island.    Meanwhile the English preparations for war were advancing with vigor and  industry. The king had received no supplies from parliament; but by his  own funds and credit he was enabled to equip a fleet: the city of London  lent him one hundred thousand pounds: the spirit of the nation seconded  his armaments: he himself went from port to port, inspecting with great  diligence, and encouraging the work; and in a little time the English  navy was put in a formidable condition. Eight hundred thousand pounds  are said to have been expended on this armament. When Lawson arrived,  and communicated his suspicion of De Ruyter's enterprise, orders were  issued for seizing all Dutch ships; and one hundred and thirty-five  fell into the hands of the English. These were not declared prizes till  afterwards, when war was proclaimed.    The parliament, when it met, granted a supply, the largest by far that  had ever been given to a king of England, yet scarcely sufficient for  the present undertaking. Near two millions and a half were voted, to  be levied by quarterly payments in three years. The avidity of the  merchants, together with the great prospect of success, had animated the  whole nation against the Dutch.    A great alteration was made this session in the method of taxing the  clergy. In almost all the other monarchies of Europe, the assemblies,  whose consent was formerly requisite to the enacting of laws, were  composed of three estates, the clergy, the nobility, and the commonalty,  which formed so many members of the political body, of which the king  was considered as the head. In England too, the parliament was always  represented as consisting of three estates; but their separation was  never so distinct as in other kingdoms. A convocation, however, had  usually sitten at the same time with the parliament; though they  possessed not a negative voice in the passing of laws, and assumed  no other temporal power than that of imposing taxes on the clergy. By  reason of ecclesiastical preferments, which he could bestow, the king's  influence over the church was more considerable than over the laity; so  that the subsidies granted by the convocation were commonly greater than  those which were voted by parliament. The church, therefore, was not  displeased to depart tacitly from the right of taxing herself, and allow  the commons to lay impositions on ecclesiastical revenues, as on the  rest of the kingdom. In recompense, two subsidies, which the convocation  had formerly granted, were remitted, and the parochial clergy were  allowed to vote at elections. Thus the church of England made a barter  of power for profit. Their convocations, having become insignificant to  the crown, have been much disused of late years.    The Dutch saw, with the utmost regret, a war approaching, whence they  might dread the most fatal consequences, but which afforded no prospect  of advantage. They tried every art of negotiation, before they would  come to extremities. Their measures were at that time directed by John  de Wit, a minister equally eminent for"]]]
