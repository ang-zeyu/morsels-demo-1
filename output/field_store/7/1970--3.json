[* Greg, of Tours, lib, ix. cap. 26. H. Hunting,       lib. ii.]    But before he was admitted to this alliance, he was obliged to  stipulate, that the princess should enjoy the free exercise of her  religion; a concession not difficult to be obtained from the idolatrous  Saxons.[*] Bertha brought over a French bishop to the court of  Canterbury; and being zealous for the propagation of her religion, she  had been very assiduous in her devotional exercises, had supported the  credit of her faith by an irreproachable conduct, and had employed every  an of insinuation and address to reconcile her husband to her religious  principles. Her popularity in the court, and her influence over  Ethelbert, had so well paved the way for the reception of the Christian  doctrine, that Gregory, surnamed the Great, then Roman pontiff, began  to entertain hopes of effecting a project which lie himself, before he  mounted the papal throne, had once embraced, of converting the British  Saxons.    It happened that this prelate, at that time in a private station, had  observed in the market place of Rome some Saxon youth exposed to sale,  whom the Roman merchants, in their trading voyages to Britain, had  bought of their mercenary parents. Struck with the beauty of their fair  complexions and blooming countenances, Gregory asked to what country  they belonged; and being told they were \"Angles,\" he replied that they  ought more properly to be denominated \"angels.\" it were a pity that the  prince of darkness should enjoy so fair a prey, and that so beautiful  a frontispiece should cover a mind destitute of internal grace and  righteousness. Inquiring further concerning the name of their province,  he was Informed, that it was \"Deiri,\" a district of Northumberland.  \"Deiri!\" replied he, \"that is good! They are called to the mercy of God  from his anger--_de ira_. But what is the name of the king of that  province?\" He was told it was \"AElla,\" or \"Alia.\" \"Alleluiah;\" cried he,  \"we must endeavor that the praises of God be sung in their country.\"  Moved by these allusions, which appeared to him so happy, he deter mined  to undertake himself a mission into Britain; and having obtained the  pope's approbation, he prepared for that perilous journey; but his  popularity at home was so great, that the Romans, unwilling to expose  him to such dangers, opposed his design, and he was obliged for the  present to lay aside all further thoughts of executing that pious  purpose.[**]         [* Bede, lib. i. cap. 25. Brompton, p. 729.]         [** Bede, lib. ii. cap. 1. Spell. Concil. p. 91.]    The controversy between the pagans and the Christians was not entirely  cooled in that age; and no pontiff before Gregory had ever carried to  greater excess an intemperate zeal against the former religion. He had  waged war with all the precious monuments of the ancients, and even with  their writings, which, as appears from the strain of his own wit, as  well as from the style of his compositions, he had not taste or genius  sufficient to comprehend. Ambitious to distinguish his pontificate by  the conversion of the British Saxons, he pitched on Augustine, a Roman  monk, and sent him with forty associates to preach the gospel in this  island. These missionaries, terrified with the dangers which might  attend their proposing a new doctrine to so fierce a people, of whose  language they were ignorant, stopped some time in France, and sent back  Augustine to lay the hazards and difficulties before the pope, and crave  his permission to desist from the undertaking. But Gregory exorted them  to persevere in their purpose, advised them to choose some interpreters  from among the Franks, who still spoke the same language with the  Saxons,[*] and recommended them to the good offices of Queen Brunehaut,  who had at this time usurped the sovereign power in France. This  princess, though stained with every vice of treachery and cruelty,  either possessed or pretended great zeal for the cause; and Gregory  acknowledged, that to her friendly assistance was, in a great measure,  owing the success of that undertaking.[**]    Augustine, on his arrival in Kent in the year 597,[***] found the danger  much less than he had apprehended. Ethelbert, already well disposed  towards the Christian faith, assigned him a habitation in the Isle  of Thanet, and soon after admitted him to a conference. Apprehensive,  however, lest spells or enchantments might be employed against him by  priests, who brought an unknown worship from a distant country, he had  the precaution to receive them in the open air, where, he believed,  the force of their magic would be more easily dissipated,[****] Here  Augustine, by means of his interpreters, delivered to him the tenets of  the Christian faith, and promised him eternal joys above, and a kingdom  in heaven without end, if he would be persuaded to receive that salutary  doctrine.         [* Bede, lib. i. cap. 23.]         [** Greg. Epist. lib. ix. epist. 56. Spell. Concil.       p. 82.]         [*** Higden Polychron. lib. v. Chron. Sax. p. 23.]         [**** Bede, lib. i. cap. 25. H. Hunting, lib. iii.       Brompton, p. 729 Parker, Antiq. Brit. Eccel. p 61.]    \"Our words and promises,\"[*] replied Ethelbert, \"are fair; but because  they are new and uncertain, I cannot entirely yield to them, and  relinquish the principles which I and my ancestors have so long  maintained. You are welcome, however, to remain here in peace; and as  you have undertaken so long a journey, solely, as it appears, for  what you believe to be for our advantage, I will supply you with  all necessaries, and permit you to deliver your doctrine to my  subjects.\"[**]    Augustine, encouraged by this favorable reception, and seeing now a  prospect of success, proceeded with redoubled zeal to preach the gospel  to the Kentish Saxons. He attracted their attention by the austerity of  his manners, by the severe penances to which he subjected himself, by  the abstinence find self-denial which he practised; and having excited  then wonder by a course of life which appeared so contrary to nature, he  procured more easily their belief of miracles, which, it was pretended,  he wrought for their conversion. Influenced by these motives, and  by the declared favor of the court, numbers of the Kentish men were  baptized; and the king himself was persuaded to submit to that rite of  Christianity. His example had great influence with his subjects; but  he employed no force to bring them over to the new doctrine. Augustine  thought proper, in the commencement of his mission, to assume the  appearance of the greatest lenity; he told Ethelbert, that the service  of Christ must be entirely voluntary, and that no violence ought ever to  be used in propagating so salutary a doctrine.[****]    The intelligence received of these spiritual conquests afforded great  joy to the Romans, who now exulted as much in those peaceful trophies as  their ancestors had ever done in their most sanguinary triumphs and most  splendid victories. Gregory wrote a letter to Ethelbert, in which, after  informing him that the end of the world was approaching, he exhorted him  to display his zeal in the conversion of his subjects, to exert rigor  against the worship of idols, and to build up the good work of  holiness by every expedient of exhortation, terror, blandishment, or  correction;[*****] a doctrine more suitable to that age, and to the  usual papal maxims, than the tolerating principles which Augustine had  thought it prudent to inculcate.         [* Bede, lib. i. cap. 25. Chron. W. Thorn, p.       1759.]         [** Bede, lib. i. cap. 25. H. Hunting, lib. iii.       Brompton, p. 729]         [*** Bede, lib. i. cap. 26.]         [**** Bede, cap 26. H. Hunting, lib. iii.]         [***** Bede, lib. i. cap. 32. Brompton, p. 732 Spell.       Concil, 785]    The pontiff also answered some questions, which the missionary had  put concerning the government of the new church of Kent. Besides other  queries, which it is not material here to relate, Augustine asked,  \"Whether cousins-german might be allowed to marry.\" Gregory answered,  that that liberty had indeed been formerly granted by the Roman law;  but that experience had shown that no issue could ever come from such  marriages; and he therefore prohibited them. Augustine asked, \"Whether  a woman pregnant might be baptized.\" Gregory answered, that he saw no  objection. \"How soon after the birth the child might receive baptism.\"  It was answered, immediately, if necessary. \"How soon a husband might  have commerce with his wife after her delivery.\" Not till she had given  suck to her child; a practice to which Gregory exhorts all women. \"How;  soon a man might enter the church, or receive the sacrament, after  having had commerce with his wife.\" It was replied, that, unless he had  approached her without desire, merely for the sake of propagating his  species, he was not without sin; but in all cases it was requisite for  him, before he entered the church, or communicated, to purge himself  by prayer and ablution; and he ought not, even after using these  precautions, to participate immediately of the sacred duties.[*] There  are some other questions and replies still more indecent and more  ridiculous.[**] And on the whole it appears that Gregory and his  missionary, if sympathy of manners have any influence, were better  calculated than men of more refined understandings, for making a  progress with the ignorant and barbarous Saxons.    The more to facilitate the reception of Christianity, Gregory enjoined  Augustine to remove the idols from the heathen altars, but not to  destroy the altars themselves; because the people, he said, would be  allured to frequent the Christian worship, when they found it celebrated  in a place which they were accustomed to revere.

Paris, p. 667. Trivet, p. 209.         ** Ann. Burt. p. 427.         *** Ann Burt. p. 427.         **** Ann. Burt. p. 428, 439    The current of popularity was now much turned to the side of the crown;  and the barons had little, to rely on for their support besides the  private influence and power of their families, which, though exorbitant,  was likely to prove inferior to the combination of king and people. Even  this basis of power was daily weakened by their intestine jealousies and  animosities; their ancient and inveterate quarrels broke out when they  came to share the spoils of the crown; and the rivalship between the  earls of Leicester and Glocester, the chief leaders among them, began  to disjoint the whole confederacy. The latter, more moderate in his  pretensions, was desirous of stopping or retarding the career of the  barons' usurpations; but the former, enraged at the opposition which, he  met with in his own party, pretended to throw up all concern in English  affairs; and he retired into France.[*]    The kingdom of France, the only state with which England had any  considerable intercourse, was at this time governed by Lewis IX., a  prince of the most singular character that is to be met with in all  the records of history. This monarch united to the mean and abject  superstition of a monk all the courage and magnanimity of the greatest  hero; and, what may be deemed more extraordinary, the justice and  integrity of a disinterested patriot, the mildness and humanity of an  accomplished philosopher. So far from taking advantage of the divisions  among the English, or attempting to expel those dangerous rivals from  the provinces which they still possessed in France, he had entertained  many scruples with regard to the sentence of attainder pronounced  against the king's father, had even expressed some intention of  restoring the other provinces, and was only prevented from taking that  imprudent resolution by the united remonstrances of his own barons, who  represented the extreme danger of such a measure,[**] and, what had a  greater influence on Lewis, the justice of punishing by a legal sentence  the barbarity and felony of John. Whenever this prince interposed  in English affairs, it was always with an intention of composing the  differences between the king and his nobility: he recommended to both  parties every peaceable and reconciling measure; and he used all his  authority with the earl of Leicester, his native subject, to bend him to  a compliance with Henry.         * Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 348.         ** M. Paris, p. 604.    He made a treaty with England at a time when the distractions of that  kingdom were at the greatest height, and when the king's authority was  totally annihilated; and the terms which he granted might, even in  a more prosperous state of their affairs, be deemed reasonable and  advantageous to the English. He yielded up some territories which  had been conquered from Poictou and Guienne; he insured the peaceable  possession of the latter province to Henry; he agreed to pay that prince  a large sum of money; and he only required that the king should, in  return, make a final cession of Normandy and the other provinces, which  he could never entertain any hopes of recovering by force of arms.[*]  This cession was ratified by Henry, by his two sons and two daughters,  and by the king of the Romans and his three sons: Leicester alone,  either moved by a vain arrogance, or desirous to ingratiate himself with  the English populace, protested against the deed, and insisted on the  right, however distant, which might accrue to his consort.[**] Lewis saw  in his obstinacy the unbounded ambition of the man; and as the barons  insisted that the money due by treaty should be at their disposal, not  at Henry's, he also saw, and probably with regret, the low condition to  which this monarch, who had more erred from weakness than from any bad  intentions, was reduced by the turbulence of his own subjects.    {1261.} But the situation of Henry soon after wore a more favorable  aspect. The twenty-four barons had now enjoyed the sovereign power near  three years; and had visibly employed it, not for the reformation of  the state, which was their first pretence, but for the aggrandizement  of themselves and of their families. The breach of trust was apparent to  all the world: every order of men felt it, and murmured against it: the  dissensions among the barons themselves, which increased the evil,  made also the remedy more obvious and easy: and the secret desertion  in particular of the earl of Glocester to the crown, seemed to promise  Henry certain success in any attempt to resume his authority. Yet durst  he not take that step, so reconcilable both to justice and policy,  without making a previous application to Rome, and desiring an  absolution from his oaths and engagements.[***]         * Rymer, vol. i. p 675. M. Paris, p. 566. Chron. T. Wykes,       p, 53. Trivet, p. 208 M. West. p. 371.         ** Chron. T. Wykes, p. 53.         *** Ann. Burt. p. 389.    The pope was at this time much dissatisfied with the conduct of the  barons; who, in order to gain the favor of the people and clergy of  England, had expelled all the Italian ecclesiastics, had confiscated  their benefices, and seemed determined to maintain the liberties and  privileges of the English church, in which the rights of patronage  belonging to their own families were included. The extreme animosity of  the English clergy against the Italians was also a source of his disgust  to the order; and an attempt which had been made by them for further  liberty and greater independence on the civil power, was therefore less  acceptable to the court of Rome.[*] About the same time that the barons  at Oxford had annihilated the prerogatives of the monarchy, the clergy  met in a synod at Merton, and passed several ordinances, which were  no less calculated to promote their own grandeur at the expense of  the crown. They decreed, that it was unlawful to try ecclesiastics by  secular judges; that the clergy were not to regard any prohibitions  from civil courts; that lay patrons had no right to confer spiritual  benefices; that the magistrate was obliged, without further inquiry, to  imprison all excommunicated persons; and that ancient usage, without any  particular grant or charter, was a sufficient authority for any clerical  possessions or privileges.[**] About a century before, these claims  would have been supported by the court of Rome beyond the most  fundamental articles of faith: they were the chief points maintained  by the great martyr Becket; and his resolution in defending them had  exalted him to the high station which he held in the catalogue of Romish  saints. But principles were changed with the times: the pope was become  somewhat jealous of the great independence of the English clergy, which  made them stand less in need of his protection, and even imboldened them  to resist his authority, and to complain of the preference given to the  Italian courtiers, whose interests, it is natural to imagine, were the  chief object of his concern. He was ready, therefore, on the king's  application, to annul these new constitutions of the church of  England.[***] And, at the same time, he absolved the king and all his  subjects from the oath which they had taken to observe the provisions of  Oxford.[****]         * Rymer, vol. i. p. 755.         ** Ann. Burt. p. 389.         *** Rymer, vol. i. p. 755.         **** Rymer, vol. i. p. 722. M. Paris, p. 666. W. Heming. p,       580. Ypod. Neust. p; 468. Knyghton, p. 2446.    Prince Edward, whose liberal mind, though in such early youth, had  taught him the great prejudice which his father had incurred by his  levity, inconstancy, and frequent breach of promise, refused for a  long time to take advantage of thus absolution; and declared that the  provisions of Oxford, how unreasonable soever in themselves, and how  much soever abused by the barons, ought still to be adhered to by those  who had sworn to observe them:[*] he himself had been constrained by  violence to take that oath; yet was he determined to keep it. By this  scrupulous fidelity the prince acquired the confidence of all parties,  and was afterwards enabled to recover fully the royal authority, and  to perform such great actions both during his own reign and that of his  father.    The situation of England, during this period, as well as that of most  European kingdoms, was somewhat peculiar. There was no regular military  force maintained in the nation: the sword, however, was not, properly  speaking, in the hands of the people; the barons were alone intrusted  with the defence of the community; and after any effort which they made,  either against their own prince or against foreigners, as the military  retainers departed home, the armies were disbanded, and could not  speedily be reassembled at pleasure. It was easy, therefore, for a  few barons, by a combination, to get the start of the other party, to  collect suddenly their troops, and to appear unexpectedly in the field  with an army, which their antagonists, though equal or even superior  in power and interest, would not dare to encounter.
