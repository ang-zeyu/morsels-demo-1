We haven't any elevators, or any sales slips, or even a cash  register.  We don't wait on customers unless they ask us to.  They come  in and browse round, and if they find anything they want they come back  here to my desk and ask about it.  The price is marked in every book in  red pencil.  The cash-box is here on this shelf.  This is the key  hanging on this little hook.  I enter each sale in this ledger.  When  you sell a book you must write it down here, and the price paid for it.\"    \"But suppose it's charged?\" said Titania.    \"No charge accounts.  Everything is cash.  If someone comes in to sell  books, you must refer him to me.  You mustn't be surprised to see  people drop in here and spend several hours reading.  Lots of them look  on this as a kind of club.  I hope you don't mind the smell of tobacco,  for almost all the men that come here smoke in the shop.  You see, I  put ash trays around for them.\"    \"I love tobacco smell,\" said Titania.  \"Daddy's library at home smells  something like this, but not quite so strong.  And I want to see the  worms, bookworms you know.  Daddy said you had lots of them.\"    \"You'll see them, all right,\" said Roger, chuckling.  \"They come in and  out.  To-morrow I'll show you how my stock is arranged.  It'll take you  quite a while to get familiar with it.  Until then I just want you to  poke around and see what there is, until you know the shelves so well  you could put your hand on any given book in the dark.  That's a game  my wife and I used to play.  We would turn off all the lights at night,  and I would call out the title of a book and see how near she could  come to finding it.  Then I would take a turn.  When we came more than  six inches away from it we would have to pay a forfeit.  It's great  fun.\"    \"What larks we'll have,\" cried Titania.  \"I do think this is a cunning  place!\"    \"This is the bulletin board, where I put up notices about books that  interest me.  Here's a card I've just been writing.\"    Roger drew from his pocket a square of cardboard and affixed it to the  board with a thumbtack.  Titania read:                THE BOOK THAT SHOULD HAVE PREVENTED THE WAR      Now that the fighting is over is a good time to read Thomas Hardy's The  Dynasts.  I don't want to sell it, because it is one of the greatest  treasures I own.  But if any one will guarantee to read all three  volumes, and let them sink into his mind, I'm willing to lend them.    If enough thoughtful Germans had read The Dynasts before July, 1914,  there would have been no war.    If every delegate to the Peace Conference could be made to read it  before the sessions begin, there will be no more wars.                                   R.  MIFFLIN.      \"Dear me,\" said Titania, \"Is it so good as all that?  Perhaps I'd  better read it.\"    \"It is so good that if I knew any way of doing so I'd insist on Mr.  Wilson reading it on his voyage to France.  I wish I could get it onto  his ship.  My, what a book!  It makes one positively ill with pity and  terror.  Sometimes I wake up at night and look out of the window and  imagine I hear Hardy laughing.  I get him a little mixed up with the  Deity, I fear.  But he's a bit too hard for you to tackle.\"    Titania was puzzled, and said nothing.  But her busy mind made a note  of its own:  Hardy, hard to read, makes one ill, try it.    \"What did you think of the books I put in your room?\" said Roger.  He  had vowed to wait until she made some comment unsolicited, but he could  not restrain himself.    \"In my room?\" she said.  \"Why, I'm sorry, I never noticed them!\"        Chapter IV    The Disappearing Volume      \"Well, my dear,\" said Roger after supper that evening, \"I think perhaps  we had better introduce Miss Titania to our custom of reading aloud.\"    \"Perhaps it would bore her?\" said Helen.  \"You know it isn't everybody  that likes being read to.\"    \"Oh, I should love it!\" exclaimed Titania.  \"I don't think anybody ever  read to me, that is not since I was a child.\"    \"Suppose we leave you to look after the shop,\" said Helen to Roger, in  a teasing mood, \"and I'll take Titania out to the movies.  I think  Tarzan is still running.\"    Whatever private impulses Miss Chapman may have felt, she saw by the  bookseller's downcast face that a visit to Tarzan would break his  heart, and she was prompt to disclaim any taste for the screen classic.    \"Dear me,\" she said; \"Tarzan--that's all that nature stuff by John  Burroughs; isn't it?  Oh, Mrs. Mifflin, I think it would be very  tedious.  Let's have Mr. Mifflin read to us.  I'll get down my knitting  bag.\"    \"You mustn't mind being interrupted,\" said Helen.  \"When anybody rings  the bell Roger has to run out and tend the shop.\"    \"You must let me do it,\" said Titania.  \"I want to earn my wages, you  know.\"    \"All right,\" said Mrs. Mifflin; \"Roger, you settle Miss Chapman in the  den and give her something to look at while we do the dishes.\"    But Roger was all on fire to begin the reading.  \"Why don't we postpone  the dishes,\" he said, \"just to celebrate?\"    \"Let me help,\" insisted Titania.  \"I should think washing up would be  great fun.\"    \"No, no, not on your first evening,\" said Helen.  \"Mr. Mifflin and I  will finish them in a jiffy.\"    So Roger poked up the coal fire in the den, disposed the chairs, and  gave Titania a copy of Sartor Resartus to look at.  He then vanished  into the kitchen with his wife, whence Titania heard the cheerful clank  of crockery in a dishpan and the splashing of hot water.  \"The best  thing about washing up,\" she heard Roger say, \"is that it makes one's  hands so clean, a novel sensation for a second-hand bookseller.\"    She gave Sartor Resartus what is graphically described as a \"once  over,\" and then seeing the morning Times lying on the table, picked it  up, as she had not read it.  Her eye fell upon the column headed                               LOST AND FOUND                      Fifty cents an agate line      and as she had recently lost a little pearl brooch, she ran hastily  through it.  She chuckled a little over    LOST--Hotel Imperial lavatory, set of teeth.  Call or communicate  Steel, 134 East 43 St. Reward, no questions asked.    Then she saw this:      LOST--Copy of Thomas Carlyle's \"Oliver Cromwell,\" between Gissing  Street, Brooklyn, and the Octagon Hotel.  If found before midnight,  Tuesday, Dec. 3, return to assistant chef, Octagon Hotel.      \"Why\" she exclaimed, \"Gissing Street--that's here!  And what a funny  kind of book for an assistant chef to read.  No wonder their lunches  have been so bad lately!\"    When Roger and Helen rejoined her in the den a few minutes later she  showed the bookseller the advertisement.  He was very much excited.    \"That's a funny thing,\" he said.  \"There's something queer about that  book.  Did I tell you about it?  Last Tuesday--I know it was then  because it was the evening young Gilbert was here--a man with a beard  came in asking for it, and it wasn't on the shelf.  Then the next  night, Wednesday, I was up very late writing, and fell asleep at my  desk.  I must have left the front door ajar, because I was waked up by  the draught, and when I went to close the door I saw the book sticking  out a little beyond the others, in its usual place.  And last night,  when the Corn Cobs were here, I went out to look up a quotation in it,  and it was gone again.\"    \"Perhaps the assistant chef stole it?\" said Titania.    \"But if so, why the deuce would he advertise having done so?\" asked  Roger.    \"Well, if he did steal it,\" said Helen, \"I wish him joy of it.  I tried  to read it once, you talked so much about it, and I found it dreadfully  dull.\"    \"If he did steal it,\" cried the bookseller, \"I'm perfectly delighted.  It shows that my contention is right:  people DO really care for good  books.  If an assistant chef is so fond of good books that he has to  steal them, the world is safe for democracy.  Usually the only books  any one wants to steal are sheer piffle, like Making Life Worth While  by Douglas Fairbanks or Mother Shipton's Book of Oracles.  I don't mind  a man stealing books if he steals good ones!\"    \"You see the remarkable principles that govern this business,\" said  Helen to Titania.  They sat down by the fire and took up their knitting  while the bookseller ran out to see if the volume had by any chance  returned to his shelves.    \"Is it there?\" said Helen, when he came back.    \"No,\" said Roger, and picked up the advertisement again.  \"I wonder why  he wants it returned before midnight on Tuesday?\"    \"So he can read it in bed, I guess,\" said Helen.  \"Perhaps he suffers  from insomnia.\"    \"It's a darn shame he lost it before he had a chance to read it.  I'd  like to have known what he thought of it.  I've got a great mind to go  up and call on him.\"    \"Charge it off to profit and loss and forget about it,\" said Helen.  \"How about that reading aloud?\"    Roger ran his eye along his private shelves, and pulled down a  well-worn volume.    \"Now that Thanksgiving is past,\" he said, \"my mind always turns to  Christmas, and Christmas means Charles Dickens.  My dear, would it bore  you if we had a go at the old Christmas Stories?\"    Mrs. Mifflin held up her hands in mock dismay.  \"He reads them to me  every year at this time,\" she said to Titania.  \"Still, they're worth  it.  I know good old Mrs. Lirriper better than I do most of my friends.\"    \"What is it, the Christmas Carol?\" said Titania.  \"We had to read that  in school.\"    \"No,\" said Roger; \"the other stories, infinitely better.  Everybody  gets the Carol dinned into them until they're weary of it, but no one  nowadays seems to read the others.  I tell you, Christmas wouldn't be  Christmas to me if I didn't read these tales over again every year.  How homesick they make one for the good old days of real inns and real  beefsteak and real ale drawn in pewter.  My dears,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17203"],[0,"Witchcraft and Devil Lore in the Channel Islands (#10)"],[1,"superstructure.    Business affairs prospered with Mr. Guille. As time rolled on he was  taken into partnership with the firm, as was also his friend and  fellow-countryman, Mr. F.M. Alles, and his increasing prosperity  enabled him to put his cherished project into more tangible shape.  While on a visit to Guernsey in 1851, he wrote a few articles in the  _Gazette Officielle_, with the view of drawing public attention to the  importance of forming district or parish libraries. These articles  attracted the notice of _The Farmers' Club_, an association of  intelligent country gentlemen who met at the Castel. Their secretary,  the late Mr. Nicholas Le Beir, wrote to Mr. Guille at the request of  the members, informing him of their appreciation of his views, and of  his having been elected an honorary member of their association, in  token of their esteem. They had previously elected in a similar way  the famous French poet Beranger, and also Guernsey's national bard,  the late Mr. George Metivier. Mr. Guille accepted the honour, and the  correspondence which ensued resulted in his offering his collection of  books--supplemented by a considerable sum of money--towards forming  the commencement of such libraries as he had been advocating. Nothing,  however, really definite was done until Mr. Guille's next visit to  Guernsey in 1855-6, when after consultation with that devoted friend  of education, the late Mr. Peter Roussel, a meeting of a few  friends--including Mr. Roussel and his venerable mother, Mr. Guille,  Judge Clucas, Mr. Le Beir, and Mr. Henry E. Marquand--who were known  to be favourable to the project was held, several handsome  subscriptions were promised, Mr. Guille renewed his offer previously  made to _The Farmers' Club_, and a workable scheme was matured.    THE GUILLE LIBRARY,    for so the Committee decided to name the undertaking, consequently  commenced its useful career in 1856. The collection of books was  divided into five sections, which were placed in separate cases, and  located at convenient distances about the island--where they were  taken charge of by friends--the largest being reserved for the town.  The intention was to exchange these cases in rotation, and so  establish a circulating library in the most comprehensive sense of the  term. But this was, in reality, never carried out, for after the  volumes had been read in their respective stations, they were returned  to their places, and left to slumber unused, until Mr. Guille once  more came to the island in 1867, with the intention of remaining  permanently, and he then had them all brought to town and arranged in  one central _depot_.    Mr. Guille also opened a branch Reading-room and Library at St.  Martin's, in the hope of being able thereby to draw the young men of  the parish from the degrading attractions of the public house. For  three years he kept this comfortable room open, while in winter and  summer neither rain nor storm prevented him from being present there  every evening to personally superintend the undertaking. Ultimately,  however, he found the strain too much for his health, and he  discontinued the branch so as to concentrate more attention upon the  central establishment in town.    For five-and-twenty years, from 1856 to 1881, Mr. Guille worked  steadily and unostentatiously at the benevolent enterprise which he  had inaugurated. Death removed several of his early coadjutors, and  for many years he bore all the financial burdens and toiled on  single-handed and alone. What was still more discouraging was that he  unfortunately had to encounter for a very long time an almost  incredible amount of mental supineness on the part of those whom he  was so disinterestedly seeking to benefit. It was not as though any  desire for knowledge existed among the mass of the Guernsey people,  and he only had to assume the pleasant duty of satisfying that desire.  Such a desire did not exist. Many of the people not only never had  read any books but they flatly declined to begin. Mr. Guille felt that  this deplorable attitude ought to be combatted, and he therefore  persevered in the thankless and difficult task of trying in the first  place to create the want, and in the second place to satisfy it. A  quarter-of-a-century's earnest effort in a good cause, however, cannot  fail to produce some fruit, and within the last three or four years  much brighter days have dawned. Mr. Guille's lifelong friend and  former business partner, Mr. F.M. Alles,--who had often previously  substantially assisted him,--has latterly thoroughly associated  himself with the work, and the result is that the rudimentary scheme  of 1856 has at length culminated in the splendid    GUILLE-ALLES LIBRARY,    which was thrown open to the public in the old Assembly Rooms, on the  2nd of January, 1882, and bears on its portal the appropriate motto:  _Ingredere ut proficias_--\"Enter that thou mayst profit.\" How  admirably this fine Institution is fulfilling its mission is  well-known to all who frequent it. It already contains a collection of  over 35,000 volumes--to which constant additions are being made--of  valuable and standard works in all branches of science, literature and  art, both in the French and English languages, besides numerous works  in German, Italian, Greek, Latin, &c. It has a commodious  Reading-room, well supplied with journals and periodical publications;  while a Society of Natural Science has also been inaugurated and meets  in connection with it. The Guernsey Mechanics' Institution--after an  existence of just half-a-century--was absorbed into it at the close of  1881; and the Library of the _Societe Guernesiaise_--founded in  1867--now finds a home on its shelves. The subscription for membership  is merely nominal, and Messrs. Guille and Alles have made arrangements  to endow the Institution with such ample funds as shall secure in  perpetuity the many benefits which it is conferring upon the island.    THE FUTURE OF THE INSTITUTION    is therefore fully assured and its wants provided for. The spacious  new buildings which have been for many months in process of erection  are now (December, 1885) rapidly approaching completion. They comprise  a spacious and handsome Lecture Hall, capable of seating from 250 to  300 persons; a Book-room 63-ft. by 25-ft., exclusively for the lending  department, and which will accommodate on its shelves from 45,000 to  50,000 additional volumes--with a large anteroom for the convenience  of the subscribers. The present Reading-room will then be used for a  Reference Library and Students' Consulting and Reading-room. There are  also a General Reading-room, a Working Men's Reading-room, and  numerous apartments suitable for Class-rooms and Committee-rooms. The  roof of the original building has been reconstructed and raised so as  to form a suite of rooms 100-ft. long, 24-ft. wide, and 10-ft. high.  Lighted from the top these are specially adapted for the exhibition of  objects of interest, pictures, or for a local museum. A convenient  residence for the Librarian is arranged in a separate building, which  is extended so as to provide on the ground floor convenient rooms for  the reception and storing of books and for the special work of the  Librarians.    When the Library was first removed to the Assembly Rooms, the premises  were leased from the States, who had purchased them in 1870.  Subsequently, however, in December, 1883, Messrs. Guille and Alles  purchased the Rooms from the States for L900 British, and afterwards  bought from the Parish the plot of land behind the Rooms--which  belonged to the Rectory--and upon which they have now built the  spacious new premises above-mentioned. As soon as these extensions are  available, the founders purpose inaugurating comprehensive courses of  popular illustrated lectures on physical science, economic products,  natural history, microscopic science, literary subjects, &c., which  will appeal at once to the eye and the understanding, and impart a  large amount of very useful knowledge in an easy and agreeable way.  There will also be classes in various subjects, including the French,  German and Italian languages, drawing, music, &c., &c., all of which  will be open to girls as well as boys, women as well as men. In an  island like Guernsey, where from the smallness of the community many  of the young people necessarily have to go and seek their fortunes  abroad, the advantages for self-culture offered by an Institution like  this can scarcely be over-rated. The local facilities afforded for the  acquisition of French are particularly marked, while it cannot for a  moment be doubted that a young man or woman who can use both French  and English with fluency, is much better equipped for the battle of  life than is a person knowing only one of these languages. Whatever  intellectual needs may become apparent in the people, these the  Guille-Alles Library will set itself to supply. Its founders, indeed,  are especially anxious that there should be no hard and fast barriers  about its settlement, which might cramp its expansion or fetter its  usefulness. On the contrary they desire--while adhering, of course, to  certain main lines of intellectual activity--to imbue it with such  elasticity of adaptation as will enable it to successfully grapple  with the changing necessities of changing times. The chief wants of  to-day may not necessarily be the most pressing requisites of a  century hence. Therefore, one of the greatest essentials--and at the  same time one of the greatest difficulties--in a foundation like this,  is to provide for and combine within it such a fixity of principle and  such an adaptability of administration as shall enable it to keep pace  with the progress of the ages, and suit itself to the several  requirements of succeeding generations as they pass.
