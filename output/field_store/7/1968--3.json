We must not remain passive to            anything that may aid us in gaining a place of honor in            society; philosophy, medicine, law, political economy--in other            words, all branches of science, art, literature--represent a            wide field where even our smallest successes, developing our            abilities, will be of great benefit to our cause.              \"These vocations are inseparable from speculation. Thus the            production of a musical composition, even though it be very            mediocre, will furnish to our co-religionists a plausible            reason for elevating on a pedestal and surrounding with a halo            the Jew who will be the author of it. As for the sciences,            medicine and philosophy, they must equally be a part of our            intellectual domain.         \"_To the physician are usually confided the most intimate secrets       of the family and he, therefore, holds in his hands the health and       life of our ancient enemies--the Christians._ We are obliged to       encourage matrimonial unions between Israelites and Christians, for       the people of Israel, risking no loss whatsoever from such contact,       will only gain from such unions.              \"... The introduction of a certain quantity of impure blood            into our God-chosen race will not corrupt it. Our daughters            will furnish us with these marriages alliances with Christian            families that possess influence and power. In exchange for the            money that we give, it is just that we obtain influence on            everything that surrounds us.         \"Our relationship with the Christians will not make us deviate from       the path we have always been following; on the contrary, with a       certain degree of artfulness and cunning, this relationship will       gradually make us full masters of their destinies. _It is       desirable, that the Israelites refrain from keeping concubines of       our holy faith and rather select Christian girls for the part._ The       substitution of the simple formality of a contract before some       civil power for the church ceremony is of the greatest importance       to us, because on this condition Christian women will overflow our       camp.--If gold is the first power on this earth, then the second       power is undoubtedly the press. But of what significance is the       latter without the former? Since we cannot realize all the       above-stated aims without the assistance of the press, _it is       absolutely necessary that the management of all the newspapers and       magazines of all the countries, be in our hands. The possession of       gold, of the press and of sufficient means for the satisfaction of       certain qualities of its soul, will make us masters of public       opinion and will subjugate to us the masses._         \"Following this method on every step of our way with a persistence       which is one of our highest qualities, we will push the Christians       aside and reduce their influence to zero. We will dictate to the       world what it should believe, what it must revere or despise. It is       possible that persons will be found who will arise against us;       arming themselves, they will hurl insults and curses at us; but the       docile, ignorant masses will harken to us and will take our part.       _Once we become absolute masters of the press, we will easily be       able to refashion the ideas of honor, of virtue, of       faithfulness--and to deal the first blow to the family-conception       which is considered to this day as the most sacred institution and       which must be reduced to a state of decay. We shall then be able to       uproot the belief in that which our enemies, the Christians, shall       have worshipped until that time and instead of that, having brought       up the army in a spirit of infatuation with the various passions,       we shall openly declare war upon everything that the gentiles are       at present revering and worshipping._         \"May all this be understood and noted, and let every child of       Israel become imbued with its true principles. Then our might will       grow like a gigantic tree the branches of which will bear fruits,       known as riches, pleasure, power.              \"... as a compensation for that hideous condition which for            long centuries has been the unique lot of the people of            Israel.         \"When one of us makes a step forward let the next one follow him.       If his foot slips let his co-religionists hasten to support him.       If an Israelite is trapped by the court of the country in which he       resides, his brethren in faith should use all their efforts to get       him out of trouble or to help him otherwise, but on the condition       that the Israelite in question acted according to the laws which       Israel observes strictly and guards for so many centuries, and the       precepts of our religion.              \"Our people is conservative, faithful to the religious            ceremonies and usages which our ancestors have bequeathed to            us.         \"It is very important for us to pretend to be expounders and       protagonists of social questions prevalent at the time in a       country, especially of those whose aim it is to better the fate of       the workingman; but, in reality, our efforts must gravitate towards       possession and rule over the movements of public opinion.         \"The blindness of the masses and the tendency of their leaders to       yield to oratory, as empty as it is loud, make them easy prey for       us and a double weapon for our popularity and credit. With the aid       of oratory, our speakers will be able to make people believe our       artificial enthusiasm which Christians usually attain through the       medium of genuine sentiment.         \"It is necessary, to support as much as possible, the Proletariat       and to subjugate it to those in charge of the finances. Acting in       this manner, it will be for us to incite the masses, whenever we       shall need them. We will use them as weapons for upheavals and       revolutions and each of these catastrophes will move our cause       forward with gigantic strides and will bring us, with a quick pace,       nearer our goal--to reign over the entire world, as it was promised       by our Father Abraham.\"    [_For the sake of illustration, the following extracts, out of many that  might be selected, are taken from the Goedsche-Retcliffe novel which  were afterwards elaborated and presented as facts._]           FIRST STAGE OF THE LIE--THE NOVELETTE         If we will be supreme in the stock exchange, we will attain the       same supremacy in the governments. Therefore it is necessary to       facilitate loans in order to get them into our hands all the more.       Wherever possible, we must take in exchange for capital, mortgages       on railroads, taxes, mines, regalias (?) and domains. (Page 32.)         Ownership of land is always the iron-clad, everlasting possession       of every country. This in itself gives power, respect and       influence. Therefore the Jews should secure the possibility of       acquiring real estate. Therefore it is necessary to facilitate the       loans on land. The more we will help the breaking up of estates,       the more easily they will fall into our hands. (Page 33.)         Industry the power of the burgher, which hinders the Jewish nation       must be paralyzed even as agriculture. (Page 34.)         The natural enemy of the Jews is the Christian Church. Therefore we       must try to humiliate it, we must instil into it free-thinking,       scepticism, and conflicts. Therefore we will first of all start a       war on the clergy, we will try to arouse suspicion against it and       humiliate it.         Let our brethren strive for the abolition of armed force.... Not       the sword, but reason and money must rule. (Page 35.)         Our nation is conservative to its very root, and clings fast to the       old. But our interests demand that we participate, or, rather,       direct the movements of nations. It is indisputable that ours is a       time of many reforms, whose main purpose is the amelioration of the       material condition of the needy classes. But for this the       propertied classes must sacrifice their capital. Capital is in the       hands of the Jews. Therefore, they must outwardly take part in the       movement and try to divert it from social and political reforms.       The masses themselves are blind and foolish and permit the shouters       to rule over them.... The instability of the foundation increases       our power and our influence. Therefore the support of every kind of       revolution increases our capital and brings us nearer to our goal.       (Pages 36-37.)         Of what value are all the opinions and advice given here without       the aid of the press? We will attain our aim only when the press       will be in our hands. Our people must direct the daily       publications.... We need great political newspapers which will mold       public opinion--criticism, the literature of the street and the       stage. In this way we will crowd out the Christians step by step,       and will dictate to the world what it should believe in, what it       should respect and what it should curse.

He was of opinion, firmly, that now the  Spaniards had discovered their presence in the island, such  measures of defense would be taken, at every port, as to place  these beyond the hazard of attack by so small a body as those  carried by the three ships. He therefore, receiving full  satisfaction for the use of his men and for guarding the ships,  sailed away on the 7th August, leaving the Swanne and the Pacha to  proceed upon the adventure, alone.    Captain Drake sent his brother and Ellis Hickson to examine the  river Chagres; and on their return Captain Drake, with his two  ships and three pinnaces, sailed for Carthagena, where he arrived  on the 13th day of August. While on the voyage thither he captured  two Spanish ships, each of 240 tons, with rich cargoes, neither of  them striking so much as a blow in resistance.    At evening he anchored between the Island of Cara and Saint  Bernardo, and the three pinnaces entered the harbor of Carthagena.    Lying at the entrance they found a frigate, which in those days  meant a very small craft, not much larger than a rowing boat. She  had but one old man on board, who said that the rest of the company  had gone ashore, to fight a duel about a quarrel which they had had  overnight. He said, too, what was much more important to the  English--that, an hour before nightfall, a pinnace had passed him,  and that the man who was steering had shouted out that the English  were at hand, and that he had better up anchor and go into the  port. He said, moreover, that when the pinnace reached Carthagena  guns were fired, and he could see that all the shipping hauled in  under shelter of the castle.    This was bad news indeed, and there was much hard language among  the sailors, when they heard it. It was clear that the castle of  Carthagena, if prepared, was not to be carried by some thirty or  forty men, however gallant and determined they might be. There was,  too, but little hope that the old man had spoken falsely, for they  had themselves heard guns, shortly before their arrival there. With  much bitterness, it was determined to abandon the plan of attack;  and thus Carthagena, as well as Nombre de Dios, escaped from the  hands of the English.    They did not, however, go out empty handed; for they succeeded in  capturing, by boarding, four pinnaces, each laden with cargo; and  as they turned their heads to go out to sea, a great ship of  Seville came sailing in. Her they laid alongside and captured  easily, she having just arrived from Spain, having no thoughts of  meeting a foe, just as she reached her port of destination.    This lightened the hearts of the crew, and with their prizes in  tow, they sailed out in good spirits. The ship contained large  stores of goods from Spain, with sherries, and merchandise of every  kind. They went back to the Isle of Pines, their usual rendezvous,  and on adding up the goods that they had taken from various prizes,  found that, even now, they had made no bad thing of their voyage.    They were now much reduced in fighting strength by illness, and  Captain Drake determined in his mind that the crews were no longer  strong enough for the manning of two ships, and that it would be  better to take to one, alone. He knew, however, that even his  authority would not suffice to persuade the sailors to abandon one  of the vessels, for sailors have a great love for their ships. He  therefore determined to do it by a sudden stroke, and that known  only to himself and another. Therefore he called to him Thomas  Moore, the carpenter of the Swanne; and, taking him aside, told him  to make auger holes in the bottom of that ship. Moore, who was a  good sailor, made a great resistance to the orders; but upon the  admiral assuring him that it was necessary, for the success of the  enterprise, that one of the ships should be destroyed, he very  reluctantly undertook the task.    Previous to this Captain Drake had ordered all the booty, and a  considerable portion of the stores of both ships, to be hauled on  shore; so that they might lose nothing of value to them.    The next morning, Ned and his friends were sitting on the bulwark  of the vessel, watching the fish playing about in the depths of the  clear blue water.    \"We seem to be lower in the water than usual,\" Ned said. \"Does not  it seem to you that we are not so high above the sea as we are wont  to be?\"    The others agreed that the vessel had that appearance; but as it  seemed clearly impossible that it should be so, especially when she  was lighter than usual, they thought that they must be mistaken,  and the subject was put aside. Half an hour later Captain Drake  himself, rowing alongside, called to his brother, who came to the  side.    \"I am going to fish,\" he said; \"are you disposed to come, also?\"    Captain John expressed his willingness to do so.    \"I will wait for you,\" his brother said.    Captain John was turning to go into his cabin to get his cap and  cloak, when Captain Francis cried out:    \"Is not your ship very low in the water this morning?\"    \"The same as usual, I suppose,\" Captain John said, laughing; but  looking over the side himself, he said, \"Methinks she does lie deep  in the water;\" and, calling the carpenter, he bade him sound the  well.    The latter, after doing so, cried out loudly that there were four  feet of water in the ship.    A great astonishment seized upon both officers and crew, at this  unexpected news. All hands were at once set to work, the pumps were  rigged and, with buckets and all sorts of gear, they strove  manfully and hard to get rid of the water. It soon, however, became  plain that it entered faster than they could pump it forth, and  that the vessel must have sprung a bad leak.    When it was clear that the Swanne could not be saved, the boats of  the Pacha were brought alongside, and all the goods that remained  in her were removed, together with the arms and ammunition. Then  the crew, taking to the boats, lay by, until in a few minutes the  Swanne sank, among the tears of many of her crew, who had made  three voyages in her, and loved her well.    It was not, for a long time afterwards, known that the loss of this  ship was the effect of the orders of the admiral; who, indeed,  acted with his usual wisdom in keeping the matter secret; for  assuredly, although the men would have obeyed his orders, he would  have lost much favor and popularity among them, had the truth been  at that time known.    The next day the news was spread, among the men, that it was  determined to fill the Pacha with all the stores that were on  shore; and, leaving a party there with her, to embark the crews in  the pinnaces, for service in the river Chagres and along the coast;  until, at any rate, they could capture another ship to replace the  Swanne. Next day they rowed on into the Gulf of Darien. There the  ship was laid up in a good place, and they remained quiet for  fifteen days, amusing and refreshing themselves. By this means they  hoped to throw all the Spaniards off their guard, and to cause a  report to be spread that they had left the island.    The Simeroons living near had been warned, by those who had been  landed from the Isle of Pines, of their coming; and received them  with good cheer, and promised all aid that could be required. Then  the pinnaces were sent out, to catch any passing ships which might  be cruising along the coast.    It happened, one day, that two of them had set off in pursuit of a  great ship, which they saw passing in the distance. The wind was  light, and they had little doubt that they should overhaul her.  Ned, who was one of those who remained behind, was much angered at  missing so good an enterprise; but some four hours afterwards  another ship was seen to pass along.    The remaining pinnace was at once manned, Captain John Drake taking  the command; and, with fourteen men, she set out to take the  Spanish galleon. Gallant as are the exploits which have been  performed in modern times by British tars, in their attacks upon  slavers, yet in none of these cases does the disparity of force at  all approach that which often existed between the English boats and  the Spanish galleons; indeed, the only possible reason that can be  given, for the success of the English, is the fear that their enemy  entertained for them. Both the Spanish captains and crews had come  to look upon them as utterly invincible, and they seemed, when  attacked by the English buccaneers, altogether paralyzed.    As the boat rowed up towards the great ship, her size became  gradually more apparent, and her deck could be seen crowded with  men; even Ned, who was not greatly given to reflection, could not  but feel a passing doubt as to the possibility of one small boat,  with fourteen men, attacking a floating castle like this.    Presently the boom of a cannon from the forecastle of the vessel  was heard, and a ball whizzed over their heads; then shot after  shot was fired, and soon a rattle of small arms broke out, and the  water all round was cut up by bullets and balls. The rough seamen  cared little for this demonstration. With a cheer they bent their  backs to the oars and, although some were wounded, they rowed up to  the side of the ship without hesitation or doubt. Then from above a  shower of missiles were hurled upon them--darts, stones, hot water,  and even boiling tar.    It would have gone hard with the English, had not the Spanish  carelessly left a porthole open near the water level; through this  the English clambered, eager to get at their foe, and many of them  raging with the pain caused by the boiling materials. As they  rushed on to the deck, the Spaniards were ranged, in two ranks, on  either side of the hatchway; and fell upon them at once; but so  great was the fury of the English that, facing either way, with a  roar like beasts springing on their prey, they fell with axe and  sword upon the"]]]
