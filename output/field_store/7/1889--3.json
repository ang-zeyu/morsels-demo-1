For  One Man coulee, although a place of gruesome history, was also desirable  for one or two reasons. There was wood, for instance, and water, and a  cabin that was habitable. There was also a fence on the place, a corral  and a small stable. \"If Happy's ghost don't git to playin' music too  much,\" he added with his heavy-handed wit.    \"No, sir! You ain't going to have One Man coulee unless Andy, here, says  he don't want it!\" shouted Big Medicine. \"I leave it to Chip if Andy  hadn't oughta have first pick. He's the feller that's put us onto this,  by cripes, and he's the feller that's going to pick his claim first.\"    Chip did not need to sanction that assertion. The whole Happy Family  agreed unanimously that it should be so, except Slim, who yielded a bit  unwillingly.    Till midnight and after, they bent heads over the plat and made plans  for the future and took no thought whatever of the difficulties that  might lie before them. For the coming colony they had no pity, and  for the balked schemes of the Homeseekers' Syndicate no compunctions  whatever.    So Andy Green, having seen his stratagem well on the way to success,  and feeling once more the well-earned confidence of his fellows, slept  soundly that night in his own bed, serenely sure of the future.        CHAPTER 6. THE FIRST BLOW IN THE FIGHT    Letters went speeding to Irish and Jack Bates, absent members of the  Happy Family of the Flying U; letters that explained the situation with  profane completeness, set forth briefly the plan of the proposed pool,  and which importuned them to come home or make haste to the nearest  land-office and file upon certain quarter-sections therein minutely  described. Those men who would be easiest believed wrote and signed  the letters, and certain others added characteristic postscripts best  calculated to bring results.    After that, the Happy Family debated upon the boldness of going in  a body to Great Falls to file upon their claims, or the caution of  proceeding instead to Glasgow where the next nearest land-office might  be found. Slim and Happy Jack favored caution and Glasgow. The others  sneered at their timidity, as they were wont to do.    \"Yuh think Florence Grace Hallman is going to stand guard with a  six-gun?\" Andy challenged at last. \"She's tied up till her colony gets  there. She can't file on all that land herself, can she?\" He smiled  reminiscently. \"The lady asked me to come up to the Falls and see her,\"  he said softly. \"I'm going. The rest of you can take the same train, I  reckon--she won't stop you from it, and I won't. And who's to stop you  from filing? The land's there, open for settlement. At least it was  open, day before yesterday.\"    \"Well, by golly, the sooner we go the better,\" Slim declared fussily.  \"That fencin' kin wait. We gotta go and git back before Chip wants to  start out the wagons, too.\"    \"Listen here, hombres,\" called the Native Son from the window, where  he had been studying the well-thumbed pamphlet containing the homestead  law. \"If we want to play dead safe on this, we all better quit the  outfit before we go. Call for our time. I don't like the way some of  this stuff reads.\"    \"I don't like the way none of it reads,\" grumbled Happy Jack. \"I betche  we can't make it go; they's some ketch to it. We'll never git a patent.  I'll betche anything yuh like.\"    \"Well, pull out of the game, then!\" snapped Andy Green, whose nerves  were beginning to feel the strain put upon them.    \"I ain't in it yet,\" said Happy Jack sourly, and banged the door shut  upon his departure.    Andy scowled and returned to studying the map. Finally he reached for  his hat and gloves in the manner of one who has definitely made up his  mind to some thing.    \"Well, the rest of you can do as you darned please,\" he delivered his  ultimatum from the doorway. \"I'm going to catch up my horse, draw a  month's wages and hit the trail. I can catch the evening train to  the Falls, easy, and be ready to file on my chunk first thing in the  morning.\"    \"Ain't in any rush, are yuh?\" Pink inquired facetiously. \"If I had my  dinner settled and this cigarette smoked, I might go along--provided you  don't take the trail with yuh.\"    \"Hold on, boys, and listen to this,\" the Native Son called out  imperatively. \"I think we better get a move on, too; but we want to get  a fair running start, and not fall over this hump. Listen here! We've  got to swear that it is not for the benefit of any other person, persons  or corporation, and so on; and farther along it says we must not act  in collusion with any person, persons or corporation, to give them the  benefit of the land. There's more of the same kind, too, but you see--\"    \"Well, who's acting in collusion? What's collusion mean anyhow?\" Slim  demanded aggressively.    \"It means what we're aiming to do--if anybody could prove it on us,\"  explained the Native Son. \"My oldest brother's a lawyer, and I caught  some of it from him. And my expert, legal advice is this: to get into a  row with the Old Man, maybe--anyway, quit him cold, so we get our time.  We must let that fact percolate the alleged brains of Dry Lake and  vicinity--and if we give any reason for taking claims right under the  nose of the Flying U, why, we're doing it to spite the Old Man. Sabe?  Otherwise we're going to have trouble--unless that colony scheme is just  a pipe dream of Andy's.\"    The Happy Family had learned to respect the opinions of the Native Son,  whose mixture of Irish blood with good Castilian may have had something  to do with his astuteness. Once, as you may have heard, the Native Son  even scored in a battle of wits with Andy Green, and scored heavily.  And he had helped Andy pull the Flying U out of an extremely ticklish  situation, by his keen wit saving the outfit much trouble and money.  Wherefore they heeded now his warning to the extent of unsmilingly  discussing the obstacle he had pointed out to them. One after another  they read the paragraph which they had before passed over too hastily,  and sensed the possibilities of its construction. Afterward they went  into serious consultation as to ways and means, calling Happy Jack back  so that he might understand thoroughly what must be done. For the Happy  Family was nothing if not thorough, and their partisanship that had been  growing insensibly stronger through the years was roused as it had not  been since Dunk Whittaker drove sheep in upon the Flying U.    The Old Man, having eaten a slice of roast pork the size of his two  hands, in defiance of his sister's professional prohibition of the  indulgence, was sitting on the sunny side of the porch trying to ignore  the first uneasy symptoms of indigestion. The Little Doctor had taken  his pipe away from him that morning, and had badgered him into taking  a certain decoction whose taste lingered bitterly. The paper he was  reading was four days old and he disagreed with its political policy,  and there was no telling when anyone would have time to go in after the  mail and his favorite paper. Ranch work was growing heavier each year in  proportion to the lightening of range work. He was going to sow another  twenty acres of alfalfa, and to do that he must cut down the size of his  pasture--something that always went against the grain. He had not been  able to renew his lease of government land,--which also went against the  grain. And the Kid, like the last affliction which the Lord sent unto  Job--I've forgotten whether that was boils or the butchery of his  offspring--came loping down the length of the porch and kicked the Old  Man's bunion with a stubby boot-toe.    Thus was born the psychological moment when the treachery of the Happy  Family would cut deepest.    They came, bunched and talking low-voiced together with hatbrims hiding  shamed eyes, a type-true group of workers bearing a grievance. Not a man  was absent--the Happy Family saw to that! Even Patsy, big and sloppy and  bearing with him stale kitchen odors, limped stolidly in the rear beside  Slim, who looked guilty as though he had been strangling somebody's  favorite cat.    The Old Man, bent head-foremost over his growing paunch that he might  caress his outraged bunion, glared at them with belligerent curiosity  from under his graying eyebrows. The group came on and stopped short  at the steps--and I don't suppose the Happy Family will ever look such  sneaks again whatever crime they may commit. The Old Man straightened  with a grunt of pain because of his lame back, and waited. Which made it  all the harder for the Happy Family, especially for Andy Green who had  been chosen spokesman--for his sins perhaps.    \"We'd like our time,\" blurted Andy after an unpleasant silence, and  fixed his eyes frigidly upon the lowest rung of the Old Man's chair.    \"Oh, you would, hunh? The whole bunch of yuh?\" The Old Man eyed them  incredulously.    \"Yes, the whole bunch of us. We're going to quit.\"    The Old Man's jaw dropped a little, but his eyes didn't waver from  their Hangdog faces. \"Well, I never coaxed a man to stay yet,\" he stated  grimly, \"and I'm gittin' too old in the business to start coaxin' now.  Dell!\" He turned stiffly in his chair so that he faced the open door.  \"Bring me my time and check books outa the desk!\"    A gray hardness came slowly to the Old Man's face while he waited, his  seamed hands gripping the padded arms of his chair. A tightness pulled  at his lips behind the grizzled whiskers. It never occurred to him now  that the Happy Family might be perpetrating one of their jokes. He had  looked at their faces, you see. They meant to quit him--quit him cold  just as spring work was beginning. They were ashamed of themselves,  of course; they had a right to be ashamed, he thought bitterly. It  hurt--hurt so that he would have died before he would ask for excuse,  reason, grievance, explanation--for whatever motive impelled them. So he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17404"],[0,"Kinship Organisations and Group Marriage in Australia (#10)"],[1," of American totem kins, failed to  understand the Australian system owing to the presence of an element,  discovered a few years later at a point remote from the scene of Grey's  researches, to which no American analogue exists. In addition to the  grouping of the kins into phratries, the Australian tribes over a large  part of the continent subdivide each phratry into two or four classes or  \"castes,\" as they were frequently termed by the early investigators. The  effect of the class system is to further limit the choice of a given  individual, restricted to one-half of the women of the tribe under the  simple phratry system, to one-fourth of them or one-eighth, as the case  may be. Probably the first person to publish the fact of the existence  of these classes, which he regarded as differing in rank, was C.P.  Hodgson[43], who found them in 1846 among the blacks of Wide Bay. From a  letter of Leichardt's however it appears that the discovery must have  been made nearly simultaneously by several observers. Writing in  1847[44], he says that the castes are the most interesting and most  obscure feature among the tribes to the northward, and mentions F.N.  Isaacs as having noticed the existence of the classes among the natives  of Darling Downs, adding that Capt. Macarthur had also found them among  the Monobar tribes of the Coburg Peninsula. \"These castes,\" he adds,  \"are probably intimately connected with the laws of intermarriage.\"    If Leichardt's words mean, as apparently they do, that the Monobar  classes are regulative of marriage, and if his information was correct,  the first mention of classes in Australia is found, not in Hodgson's  work, but in Wilson's account[45]. Neither he, however, nor Stokes[46],  who mentions them as existing among the Limba Karadjee, makes any  mention of their connection with marriage regulations. And Earl, at a  later period, omits in like manner to say what constituted membership of  a caste, though he states that they differed in rank. The  names--Manjarojally (fire people), Manjarwuli (land people), and  Mambulgit (makers of nets, perhaps, therefore, water people), as well as  the anomalous number of the classes, seem to indicate that they are of a  somewhat different nature to the real intermarrying classes found  elsewhere[47]. It is of course well known that the initiation ceremonies  and totemic system of the northern tribes on both sides of the Gulf of  Carpentaria differ somewhat widely from the normal Australian form.    None of the observers hitherto mentioned can be said however to have  applied himself to the scientific study of the questions raised by the  facts which they recorded. Anthropology was in those days in its  infancy. The first to make a really serious effort to clear up the many  difficult questions, some of them still matters of controversy, which a  closer study of the native marriage customs brought to the surface, was  a missionary anthropologist, a class of which England has produced all  too few. In 1853 the Rev. William Ridley published the first of many  studies of the Kamilaroi speaking tribes, and, thanks to the impetus  given to the investigation of systems of relationship and allied  questions by Lewis Morgan, was the pioneer of a series of efforts which  have rescued for us at the nick of time a record of the social  organisation of many tribes which under European influence are now  rapidly losing or have already lost all traces of their primitive  customs, if indeed they have not, like the tribes formerly resident at  Adelaide and other centres of population, been absolutely exterminated  by contact with the white man with his vices and his civilisation, or by  the less gentle method euphemistically termed \"dispersion,\" which, if  other nations were the offenders, we should term massacre.    After Mr Ridley, Messrs Fison and Howitt turned their attention to the  Kamilaroi group of tribes. The progress of these investigations is  traced, historically and controversially, in the second series of  Maclennan's _Studies in Ancient History_, and it is unnecessary to deal  with it in detail. More and more light was thrown on totemism, marriage  regulations, and intermarrying classes by the persistent efforts of Mr  Howitt, by Dr Frazer's little work on Totemism, and by other students,  until it seemed that the main features of Australian social organisation  had been clearly established, when in 1898 the researches of Messrs  Spencer and Gillen seemed to do much to overthrow all recognised  principles, so far as the totemic regulation of marriage was concerned.  How far this is actually the case it is unnecessary to consider here. It  may be said however that the work of these two investigators and the  enquiries of Dr Roth in North Queensland make it more than ever a matter  for regret that the British Empire, the greatest colonial power that the  world has ever seen, will not afford the few thousand pounds needed to  put such researches on a firm basis.    Having defined the various terms, and shown the actual working of the  system by the aid of the best known example, we may now pass, after this  brief historical sketch of the development of our knowledge, to the task  of giving the broad outlines of the phratry and class organisations.    If our knowledge of Australian phratries and classes is far from  exhaustive, we have at any rate a fair knowledge of the distribution of  the various types whose existence is generally recognised; that is to  say, we can delimit the greater part of the continent according to  whether the tribes show two phratries only, or two phratries, which may  be anonymous, with the further subdivision into four classes, or into  eight classes. We also know approximately the limits of the matrilineal  and patrilineal systems. New South Wales, Victoria, the southern portion  of Queensland and Northern Territory, the eastern part of South  Australia, and the coastal regions of West Australia, are now known  with more or less accuracy from the point of view of kinship  organisations. On the other hand, from the Cape York Peninsula, and the  part of Northern Territory north of Lat. 15 deg., we have little if any  information. The south coast and its hinterland from 135 deg. westwards, as  far as King George's Sound, is virtually a terra incognita; in fact  beyond the south-western corner and the fringe which lies along the  coast we know little of the West Australian blacks, and the frontiers  between the various systems must in these areas be regarded as purely  provisional.    Broadly speaking, the tribes of the whole of the known area of  Australia, certain coast regions of comparatively small extent excepted,  have a dichotomous kinship organisation. The accompanying map (Map II)  shows how the various forms are distributed. Along most of the south  coast, and up a belt broken perhaps in the northern portion, running  through the centre of the continent in Lat. 137 deg., are found two  phratries without intermarrying classes; for the area west of Lat. 130 deg.  we have, it is true, only one datum, which gives no information as to  the area to which it applies; this portion of the field therefore is  assigned only provisionally to the two-phratry system. On the Bloomfield  River, which runs into Weary Bay, associated with the name of Captain  Cook, is an isolated two-phratry organisation, unless indeed we may  assume that the class names have either been overlooked or have passed  out of use.    The four-class system extends over the greater part of New South Wales,  and Queensland; a narrow belt runs through the north of South Australia  and broadens till it embraces the whole coastline of West Australia, the  north-eastern area excluded. An isolated four-class system, which does  not regulate marriage, is found in the Yorke Peninsula of South  Australia.    The eight-class system forms a compact mass, between the Gulf of  Carpentaria and Roebuck Bay, extending south as far as Lat. 25 deg. in the  centre of Australia.    In reality the rule of the eight-class system extends considerably  further south, but the classes are nameless or altogether non-existent.  Thus, the southern Arunta have nominally four classes, but each of these  has two sections, so that the final result is as though they were an  eight-class tribe. In the same way the marriage regulations of the  two-phratry Dieri are such that choice is limited among them precisely  as it would be if they had eight classes. The same may be true of the  remainder of the western branch of the four-class system, which is  closely allied in name to the Arunta type; the boundary between the  related sets of names is unknown.    Among the Narrinyeri and the Yuin the kinship organisation, which is  confined to totemic groups, takes a local form; here the regulation of  marriage depends on considerations of the residence of the pair. Local  exogamy also prevails among the unorganised Kurnai. The Chepara appear  to have had no organisation, and among the Narrangga ties of  consanguinity constituted the sole bar to marriage. We are not however  concerned with the problems presented by these aberrant types of  organisation, to which no further reference is made in the present work.    The area covered by the dichotomous organisations is divided almost  equally between matrilineal and patrilineal tribes. The latter occupy  the region north of Lat. 30 deg. and west of an irregular line running from  Long. 137 deg. to 140 deg. or thereabouts. In addition a portion of Victoria and  the region west of Brisbane form isolated patrilineal groups. The  problem presented by these anomalous areas has already been discussed in  the chapter on the Rule of Descent. Where local exogamy is the rule,  kinship is also virtually patrilineal.    In the remainder of Australia, non-organised tribes of course excepted,  the rule of descent is matrilineal, save that in North Queensland "]]]
