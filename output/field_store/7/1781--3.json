Emily Hart sat to Romney,[2] the artist, and it is said that  twenty-three portraits were painted, though some writers have placed  the number at over forty. \"Marinda,\" \"Sibyl,\" and the \"Spinstress\"  were amongst them. The pictures bring high prices; one, I think called  \"Sensibility,\" brought, in 1890, over L3,000. Notwithstanding her  lowly birth (which has no right to stop any one's path to greatness)  and lack of chastity, she had something uncommon about her that was  irresistibly attractive. Sir William Hamilton, Greville's uncle,  returned to England some time in 1784 from Naples, where he was the  British Minister. It was said that he was in quest of a second wife,  the first having died some two years before. Greville did not take  kindly to the idea of Sir William marrying again, because he was his  heir. He thought instead that, being in financial trouble himself, he  would try to plant Emma on his uncle, not with the object of marriage,  but of her becoming his mistress. Sir William was captivated with the  girl, which made it easy for the shameless nephew to persuade his  uncle to take her off his hands. Emma, however, was in love with  Greville, and there were indications of revolt when the astute lady  discovered that serious negotiations were proceeding for her  transference from nephew to uncle. It took twelve months to arrive at  a settlement.    There does not appear to have been a signed agreement, but there  certainly was a tacit understanding that Sir William was to assist  Greville out of his difficulties, in return for which Emma was to join  him at Naples, ostensibly as a visitor. She writes imploringly to  Greville to answer her letters, but never an answer came, and in utter  despair she tells him at last that she will not become his uncle's  concubine, and threatens to make Hamilton marry her. This poor  wretched woman was human, after all, and indeed she gave convincing  proofs of many high qualities in after-years, but in the passion of  her love for the dissolute scamp who bartered her away she pleaded for  that touch of human compassion that never came. She knew that her  reprobate lover was fearful lest she should induce his uncle to marry  her, and she may have had an instinctive feeling that it was part of  the contract that she was to be warded off if any attempt of the kind  were made likely to endanger his prospects of becoming Hamilton's  heir. His indifference made her venomously malignant, and she sent him  a last stab that would at least give him a troubled mind, even though  it should not cause him to recall her; she would then pursue her  revenge by ignoring him.    It is a sordid story which smears the pages of British History.    Emma lived with the British Ambassador at Naples as his mistress. He  was popular in this city of questionable morals at that time. She was  beautiful and developed remarkable talents as a singer, and was a  bright, witty, fascinating conversationalist. She worked hard at her  studies, and became a fluent speaker of the Italian language. Hamilton  had great consideration for her, and never risked having her affronted  because of the liaison. Her singing was a triumph. It is said she was  offered L6,000 to go to Madrid for three years and L2,000 for a season  in London. She invented classic attitudes. Goethe said that \"Sir  William Hamilton, after long love and study of art, has at last  discovered the most perfect of the wonders of nature and art in a  beautiful young woman. She lives with him, and is about twenty years  old. She is very handsome, and of a beautiful figure. What the  greatest artists have aimed at is shown in perfection, in movement, in  ravishing variety. Standing, kneeling, sitting, lying down, grave or  sad, playful, exulting, repentant, wanton, menacing, anxious, all  mental states follow rapidly one after another. With wonderful taste  she suits the folding of her veil to each expression, and with the  same handkerchief makes every kind of head-dress. The Old Knight holds  the Light for her, and enters into the exhibition with his whole  soul.\" Sir William had twelve of the \"Representations\" done by a  German artist named Frederick Rehberg, entitled \"Drawings faithfully  copied from Nature at Naples.\"    Hamilton married Emma in 1791 in England, and when they returned to  Naples she was presented to the Queen, and ultimately became on  intimate terms with Her Majesty of Naples, whose questionable morals  were freely spoken of. Emma quickly attained a high social standing,  but it is doubtful whether she exercised that influence over the Queen  of which she liked to boast.    In September, 1793, Nelson was at Naples by orders, and was the guest  of the Hamiltons for a few days. He had not been there for five  years, yet the precious Emma, without decorum or ceremony, sent him a  written whirlwind of congratulations on the occasion of his victory at  the Nile. Every line of the letter sends forth crackling sparks of  fiery passion. She begins, \"My dear, dear Sir,\" tells him she is  delirious, that she fainted and fell on her side, \"and am hurt,\" when  she heard the joyful news. She \"would feel it a glory to die in such a  cause,\" but she cannot die until she has embraced \"the Victor of the  Nile.\" Then she proceeds to describe the transports of Maria Carolina.  \"She fainted too, cried, kissed her husband, her children, walked,  frantic with pleasure, about the room, cried, kissed and embraced  everybody near her.\" Then she continues, \"Oh! brave Nelson! Oh! God  bless and protect our brave deliverer! Oh! Nelson, Nelson! Oh! Victor!  Oh! that my swollen heart could now tell him personally what we owe to  him. My dress from head to foot is Allah Nelson. My earrings are  Nelson's anchors.\" She sends him some sonnets, and avers that she must  have taken a ship to \"send all what is written on you.\" And so she  goes on, throwing herself into his arms, metaphorically speaking, at  every sentence.    When the _Vanguard_ arrived at Naples, Nelson invited Lady Hamilton on  board and she was no sooner on the deck than she made one dramatic  plunge at him, and proceeded to faint on the poor shattered man's  breast. Nelson, whose besetting weakness was love of approbation,  became intoxicated with the lady's method of making love. Poor  gallant fellow! He was, like many another, the victim of human  weakness. He immediately believed that he and Emma had \"found each  other,\" and allowed himself to be flattered with refined delicacy into  a liaison which became a fierce passion, and tested the loyalty of his  closest friends to breaking-point. How infinitely pathetic is this  piteous story from beginning to end!    Like most sailors, Nelson had a fervent, religious belief in the  Eternal, and never went to battle without casting himself on the mercy  of the Infinite Pity which alone can give solace. He was fearless and  strong in the affairs of his profession, and it may be safely assumed  that, even if it went no deeper, he had a mystic fear of God, and was  lost to all other fear.    I think it was Carlyle who said, \"God save us from the madness of  popularity. It invariably injures those who get it.\" There never was a  truer thing said, and it is sadly true of our great national hero. Not  many months had passed before the dispenser of his praises had become  his proprietor. It is doubtful whether Emma ever loved him, but that  does not concern any one. What does concern us is the imperious  domination she exercised over him. No flighty absurdities of fiction  can equal the extravagance of his devotion to her, and his unchecked  desire to let every one know it. He even informs Lady Nelson that Lady  Hamilton is the very best woman in the world and an honour to her  sex, and that he had a pride in having her as a friend. He writes to  Lord St. Vincent that she is \"an angel,\" and has honoured him in being  his Ambassadress to the Queen and is worthy of his confidence. Again  he writes, \"Our dear Lady Hamilton, whom to see is to admire, but to  know are to be added honour and respect; her head and heart surpass  her beauty, which cannot be equalled by anything I have seen.\"    It is impossible to suppose that a man could fall so violently in love  with this extraordinary creature and permit her to come so intimately  into his life without injury to his judgment and to those keen mental  qualities which were needed at that time in the service of his  country. Such loss of control must surely have been followed by mental  and intellectual deterioration. This lady of varied antecedents was  the intermediary between the Court of Naples and himself, and it is  now an authentic fact that it was on the advice of the Queen and Emma  that Naples entered into a war, the result of which was the complete  defeat of the Neapolitans; the Court and the Hamiltons had to fly to  Palermo and Nelson again lived with the Minister and his wife. He  again pours out the virtues and charms of Lady Hamilton, to whom he  gives the credit of engineering the embarkation of the Royal Family  and two and a half million sterling aboard the _Vanguard_. After  giving St. Vincent another dose of Emma, he goes on to say, \"It is my  duty to tell your Lordship the obligations which the whole Royal  Family, as well as myself, are under on this trying occasion to her  Ladyship.\" Her Ladyship, still hankering after her old friend  Greville, writes him, \"My dear adorable queen and I weep together, and  now that is our only comfort.\" It is no concern of ours, but it looks  uncommonly as though Greville still held the field, and the opinion of  many that Nelson would not have had much chance against her former  lover is borne out by many facts.    Amongst the saddest stories that raged about the Hamiltons, their  friends, and Nelson was the scandal of gambling for large stakes. Some  are persistent in the assertion that the report was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15319"],[0,"The Government Class Book (#10)"],[1," other proper officers, a statement of the funds of the  state, and of its income and expenditures during each year.    Sec.4. The _treasurer_ has charge of all the public moneys that are paid  into the treasury, and pays out the same as directed by law; and he  keeps an accurate account of such moneys, specifying the names of the  persons from whom they are received, to whom paid, and for what  purposes. He also exhibits annually a statement of moneys received and  paid out by him during the year, and of the balance in the treasury.    Sec.5. Auditors, treasurers, and other officers intrusted with the care and  management of money or other property, are generally required, before  they enter on the duties of their offices, to give bonds, in sums of  certain amount specified in the law, with sufficient sureties, for the  faithful performance of their duties. The sureties are persons who bind  themselves to pay the state all damages arising from neglect of duty on  the part of the officers, not exceeding the sum mentioned in the bond.    Sec.6. The _attorney-general_ is a person learned in the law, appointed to  act for the state in law-suits in which the state is a party. He  prosecutes persons indebted to the state, and causes to be brought to  trial persons charged with certain crimes. He also gives his opinion on  questions of law submitted to him by the governor, the legislature, and  the executive officers. In some states there is no attorney-general. In  such states prosecutions in behalf of the state are conducted by the  state's attorney for each county.    Sec.7. The _surveyor-general_ superintends the surveying of the lands  belonging to the state. He keeps in his office maps of the state,  describing the bounds of the counties and townships; and when disputes  arise respecting the boundaries, he causes surveys to be made, if  necessary, to ascertain such bounds. He performs certain other duties of  a similar nature. In many of the states there is no surveyor-general,  the duties of that office being done by a county surveyor in each  county.    Sec.8. There is also, in many of the states, a _superintendent of schools_,  called in some states, _superintendent of public instruction_, whose  principal duties are described in a subsequent chapter. (Chap. XXII,  Sec.10.)    Sec.9. There is also a printer to the state, or _state printer_, whose  business it is to print the journal, bills, reports, and other papers  and documents of the two houses of the legislature, and all the laws  passed at each session. State printers are either chosen by the  legislature, or employed by persons authorized to make contracts for the  public printing; or the printing is let to the lowest bidder.    Sec.10. There are other officers employed by the state, among whom are the  following: a _state librarian_, who has charge of the state library,  consisting of books containing matter of a public nature, such as the  laws of all the states, and of the United States, with a large  collection of miscellaneous books; persons having the care of the public  buildings and other property of the state; superintendents of state  prisons, lunatic asylums, and other state institutions, whose duties are  indicated by their titles, and need no particular description.          Chapter XIV.    Counties ind County Officers. Powers and Duties of County Officers.        Sec.1. Some of the purposes for which a state is divided into small  districts have been mentioned. (Chap. VII, Sec.1.) There are other reasons,  equally important, for these territorial divisions. Laws for the whole  state are made by the legislature; but certain regulations may be  necessary for the people in some parts of the state which are not needed  in others, and which the people of these places can better make for  themselves. It is the business of the governor and his assistant  executive state officers to execute or carry into effect the laws of the  state; but they could not see this done in every place, or in every  minute portion of the state. Again, for the convenience of those who may  be obliged to go to law to obtain redress for injuries, courts of  justice must be established near the residence of every citizen.    Sec.2. But in order to carry out these objects, a state must be divided  into small districts with fixed boundaries, that it may be known what  persons come under certain regulations, and over whom these local  officers are to exercise authority. The smallest territorial divisions  of a state are called _townships_, or _towns_, which contain generally  from twenty-five to one hundred square miles, and which, if in a square  form, would be from five to ten miles square. But for certain purposes  larger districts than townships have been found necessary. These are  formed by the union of several townships, and are called _counties_.  These divisions are the same as those of England, the country from which  the colonies (now states) were chiefly settled.    Sec.3. Counties in England were formerly districts governed by _counts_ or  earls; from which comes the name of _county_. A county was also called  _shire_; and an officer was appointed by the count or earl to perform  certain acts in the principal town in the county, which was called  _shire town_, and the officer was called _shire-reeve_, or _sheriff_,  whose powers and duties were similar to those of the sheriff of a county  in this country. The shire town is that in which the court-house and  other county buildings are situate, and where the principal officers of  the county transact their business. In a few counties there are two  towns in which the courts are held alternately. Hence each division is  called a _half-shire_.    Sec.4. Counties and towns are bodies politic, or bodies corporate.  _Corporate_ is from the Latin, _corpus_, which means _body_. A  _corporation_, or body politic, is an association of persons authorized  by law to transact business under a common name, and as a single person.  The laws of the state give such authority to the inhabitants of counties  and towns. The people of a town or county have power, to some extent, to  manage their own internal affairs, and to make rules and regulations for  their government; and they may buy, hold, and sell property, and sue and  be sued, as an individual. Similar powers are given to rail-road,  banking, insurance, and other incorporated companies. But there is in  some respects a difference between these corporations and those which  are created for purposes of government, as states, counties, towns,  cities, and villages, which will be noticed in another place. (Chap.  XVI.)    Sec.5. As a county possesses various corporate powers, there must be among  its officers some in whose name these powers are to be exercised. In  some states there is a board of _county commissioners_, (usually three,)  who exercise corporate powers. In a few, these powers are exercised by  and in the name of the _board of supervisors_, which is composed of the  supervisors of the several towns in the county, of whom there is one  supervisor in each town. These boards, or such officers in other states  as exercise these powers, have generally the power also to examine and  settle the accounts against the county, and to make orders and contracts  in relation to the building or repairing of the court-house, jail, and  other county buildings; and to perform such other acts as the laws  require.    Sec.6. There is in each county a _treasurer_ to receive and pay out the  moneys required to be collected and paid out in the county. There is  also, in some states, a county _auditor_ to examine and adjust the  accounts and debts of the county, and to perform certain other duties.  The business of county treasurers and auditors in their respective  counties, is of the same nature as that of state auditors and  treasurers. In states in which there is no county auditor, the duties of  auditor are performed by the treasurer, and some other county officer or  officers.    Sec.7. There is also in each county a _register_ or _recorder_, who records  in books provided for that purpose, all deeds, mortgages, and other  instruments of writing required by law to be recorded. In New York, and  perhaps in some other states, the business of a register or recorder is  done by a county clerk, who is also clerk of the several courts held in  the county, and of certain boards of county officers. In some states,  deeds, mortgages, and other written instruments, are recorded by the  town clerks of the several towns.    Sec.8. Another county officer is a _sheriff_, whose duty it is to attend  all the courts held in the county; to execute all warrants, writs, and  other process directed to him by the courts; to apprehend persons  charged with crime; and to take charge of the jail and of the prisoners  therein. It is his duty, also, to preserve the public peace; and he may  cause all persons who break the public peace within his knowledge or  view, to give bonds, with sureties, for keeping the peace, and for  appearing at the next court to be held in the county, and to commit them  to jail if they refuse to give such bonds. A sheriff is assisted by  deputies.    Sec.9. There are in each county one or more _coroners_, whose principal  duty is, to inquire into the cause of the death of persons who have died  by violence, or suddenly, and by means unknown. Notice of the death of a  person having so died is given to a coroner, who goes to the place of  such dead person. A jury is summoned to attend the examination;  witnesses are examined; and the jury give their opinion in writing as to  the cause and manner of the death. Such inquiry is called a _coroner's  inquest_. In one or two states, the office of coroner, it is believed,  does not exist; in which case the inquest is held by a justice of the  peace, or some other officer.    Sec.10. An attorney, elected or appointed for that purpose, "]]]
