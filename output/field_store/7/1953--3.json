Then  bring the wassail to the board, with nuts and fruit--the winter's hoard;  and bid the children take off shoe, to hang their stockings by the flue;  and let the clear and frosty sky, set out its brightest jewelry, to show  old Santa Claus the road, so he may ease his gimcrack load. And with the  coming of these times, we'll add some old and lusty rhymes, that suit  the festive season well, and sound as sweet as Christmas bell.    Now just bethink of castle gate, where humble midnight mummers wait, to  try if voices, one and all, can rouse the tipsy seneschal, to give them  bread and beer and brawn, for tidings of the Christmas morn; or bid each  yelper clear his throat, with water of the castle moat, for thus they  used, by snow and torch, to rear their voices at the porch:                                                    _Fred S. Cozzens._            *       *       *       *       *        WASSAILER'S SONG        ROBERT SOUTHWELL        Wassail! wassail! all over the town,      Our toast it is white, and our ale it is brown;      Our bowl is made of a maplin tree;      We be good fellows all;--I drink to thee.        Here's to our horse, and to his right ear,      God send master a happy new year;      A happy new year as e'er he did see,--      With my wassailing bowl I drink to thee.        Here's to our mare, and to her right eye,      God send our mistress a good Christmas pie;      A good Christmas pie as e'er I did see,--      With my wassailing bowl I drink to thee.        Here's to our cow, and to her long tail,      God send our measter us never may fail      Of a cup of good beer: I pray you draw near,      And our jolly wassail it's then you shall hear.        Be here any maids? I suppose here be some;      Sure they will not let young men stand on the cold stone!      Sing hey O, maids! come trole back the pin,      And the fairest maid in the house let us all in.        Come, butler, come, bring us a bowl of the best;      I hope your soul in heaven will rest;      But if you do bring us a bowl of the small,      Then down fall butler, and bowl and all.                   - - - - -    And here's a Christmas carol meant for children, and most excellent, and  though the monk that wrote it was hung, yet still his verses may be  sung.        A CAROL        As I in a hoarie winter's night        Stood shivering in the snow,      Surpriz'd I was with sudden heat,        Which made my heart to glow;      And lifting up a fearefull eye        To view what fire was neere,      A prettie babe, all burning bright,        Did in the aire appeare;      Who, scorched with excessive heat,        Such flouds of teares did shed,      As though his flouds should quench his flames,        Which with his teares were bred:        Alas! (quoth he) but newly borne,        In fierie heats I frie,      Yet none approach to warm their hearts,        Or feele my fire, but I;      My faultless brest the furnace is,        The fuell, wounding thornes:      Love is the fire, and sighs the smoke,        The ashes, shames and scornes;      The fuell justice layeth on,        And mercy blows the coales,      The metalls in this furnace wrought,        Are Men's defiled soules:      For which, as now on fire I am,        To work them to their good,      So will I melt into a bath,        To wash them in my blood.      With this he vanisht out of sight,        And swiftly shrunke away,      And straight I called unto minde        That it was Christmasse Day.           *       *       *       *       *    CHRISTMAS EVE    HAMILTON WRIGHT MABIE    [From \"My Study Fire.\"]    The world has been full of mysteries to-day; everybody has gone about  weighted with secrets. The children's faces have fairly shone with  expectancy, and I enter easily into the universal dream which at this  moment holds all the children of Christendom under its spell. Was there  ever a wider or more loving conspiracy than that which keeps the  venerable figure of Santa Claus from slipping away, with all the other  oldtime myths, into the forsaken wonderland of the past? Of all the  personages whose marvelous doings once filled the minds of men, he alone  survives. He has outlived all the great gods, and all the impressive and  poetic conceptions which once flitted between heaven and earth; these  have gone, but Santa Claus remains by virtue of a common understanding  that childhood shall not be despoiled of one of its most cherished  beliefs, either by the mythologist, with his sun myth theory, or the  scientist, with his heartless diatribe against superstition. There is a  good deal more to be said on this subject, if this were the place to say  it; even superstition has its uses, and sometimes, its sound heart of  truth. He who does not see in the legend of Santa Claus a beautiful  faith on one side, and the naive embodiment of a divine fact on the  other, is not fit to have a place at the Christmas board. For him there  should be neither carol, nor holly, nor mistletoe; they only shall keep  the feast to whom all these things are but the outward and visible signs  of an inward and spiritual grace.    Rosalind and myself are thoroughly orthodox when it comes to the keeping  of holidays; here at least the ways of our fathers are our ways also.  Orthodoxy generally consists in retaining and emphasizing the  disagreeable ways of the fathers, and as we are both inclined to  heterodoxy on these points, we make the more prominent our observance of  the best of the old-time habits. I might preach a pleasant little sermon  just here, taking as my text the \"survival of the fittest,\" and  illustrating the truth from our own domestic ritual; but the season  preaches its own sermon, and I should only follow the example of some  ministers and get between the text and my congregation if I made the  attempt. For weeks we have all been looking forward to this eventful  evening, and the still more eventful morrow. There have been hurried and  whispered conferences hastily suspended at the sound of a familiar step  on the stair; packages of every imaginable size and shape have been  surreptitiously introduced into the house, and have immediately  disappeared in all manner of out-of-the-way places; and for several  weeks past one room has been constantly under lock and key, visited only  when certain sharp-sighted eyes were occupied in other directions.  Through all this scene of mystery Rosalind has moved sedately and with  sealed lips, the common confidant of all the conspirators, and herself  the greatest conspirator of all. Blessed is the season which engages the  whole world in a conspiracy of love!    After dinner, eaten, let it be confessed, with more haste and less  accompaniment of talk than usual, the parlor doors were opened, and  there stood the Christmas tree in a glow of light, its wonderful  branches laden with all manner of strange fruits not to be found in the  botanies. The wild shouts, the merry laughter, the cries of delight as  one coveted fruit after another dropped into long-expectant arms still  linger in my ears now that the little tapers are burnt out, the boughs  left bare, and the actors in the perennial drama are fast asleep, with  new and strange bedfellows selected from the spoils of the night.  Cradled between a delightful memory and a blissful anticipation, who  does not envy them?    After this charming prelude is over, Rosalind comes into the study, and  studies for the fortieth time the effect of the new design of decoration  which she had this year worked out, and which gives these rather somber  rows of books a homelike and festive aspect. It pleases me to note the  spray of holly that obscures the title of Bacon's solemn and weighty  \"Essays,\" and I get half a page of suggestions for my notebook from the  fact that a sprig of mistletoe has fallen on old Burton's \"Anatomy of  Melancholy.\" Rosalind has reason to be satisfied, and if I read her face  aright she has succeeded even in her own eyes in bringing Christmas,  with its fragrant memories and its heavenly visions, into the study. I  cannot help thinking, as I watch her piling up the fire for a blaze of  unusual splendor, that if more studies had their Rosalinds to bring in  the genial currents of life there would be more cheer and hope and  large-hearted wisdom in the books which the world is reading to-day.    When the fire has reached a degree of intensity and magnitude which  Rosalind thinks adequate to the occasion, I take down a well-worn volume  which opens of itself at a well-worn page. It is a book which I have  read and re-read many times, and always with a kindling sympathy and  affection for the man who wrote it; in whatever mood I take it up there  is something in it which touches me with a sense of kinship. It is not a  great book, but it is a book of the heart, and books of the heart have  passed beyond the outer court of criticism before we bestow upon them  that phrase of supreme regard. There are other books of the heart around  me, but on Christmas Eve it is Alexander Smith's \"Dreamthorp\" which  always seems to lie at my hand, and when I take it up the well-worn  volume falls open at the essay on \"Christmas.\" It is a good many years  since Rosalind and I began to read together on Christmas Eve this  beautiful meditation on the season, and now it has gathered about itself  such a host of memories that it has become part of our common past. It  is, indeed, a veritable palimpsest, overlaid with tender and gracious  recollections out of which the original thought gains a new and subtle  sweetness. As I read it aloud I know that she sees once more the  familiar landscape about Dreamthorp, with the low, dark hill in the  background, and over it \"the tender radiance that precedes the moon\";  the village windows are all"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18909"],[0,"Poems Teachers Ask For (#10)"],[1,"sooch a grazy poy,  Und vish vonce more I gould haf rest    Und beaceful dimes enshoy.

He's older, an' he's mighty fly,  But's he's a kid, an' so am I.    One time he came,--down by the gate,  I guess it must have been awful late,--  An' Katie, she was there, an' they  Was feelin' very nice and gay,  An' he was talkin' all the while  About her sweet an' lovin' smile,  An' everythin' was as nice as pie,  An' they was there, an' so was I.    They didn't see me, 'cause I slid  Down underneath a bush, an' hid,  An' he was sayin' that his love  Was greater'n all the stars above  Up in the glorious heavens placed;  An' then His arms got 'round her waist,  An' clouds were floatin' in the sky,  And they was there, an' so was I.    I didn't hear just all they said,  But by an' by my sister's head  Was droopin' on his shoulder, an'  I seen him holdin' Katie's hand,  An' then he hugged her closer, some,  An' then I heerd a kiss--yum, yum;  An' Katie blushed an' drew a sigh,  An' sorter coughed,--an' so did I.    An' then that feller looked around  An' seed me there, down on the ground,  An'--was he mad? well, betcher boots  I gets right out of there an' scoots.  An' he just left my sister Kate  A-standin' right there by the gate;  An' I seen blood was in his eye,  An' he runned fast--an' so did I.    I runned the very best I could,  But he cotched up--I's 'fraid he would--  An' then he said he'd teach me how  To know my manners, he'd allow;  An' then he shaked me awful. Gee!  He jest--he frashed the ground with me.  An' then he stopped it by and by,  'Cause he was tired--an' so was I,    An' then he went back to the gate  An' couldn't find my sister Kate  'Cause she went in to bed, while he  Was runnin' 'round an' thumpin' me.  I got round in a shadder dim,  An' made a face, an' guffed at him;  An' then the moon larfed, in the sky,  'Cause he was there, an' so was I.        _Joseph Bert Smiley._          Is It Worth While?      Is it worth while that we jostle a brother.    Bearing his load on the rough road of life?  Is it worth while that we jeer at each other    In blackness of heart that we war to the knife?    God pity us all in our pitiful strife.    God pity as all as we jostle each other;    God pardon us all for the triumph we feel  When a fellow goes down 'neath his load on the heather,    Pierced to the heart: Words are keener than steel,    And mightier far for woe than for weal,    Were it not well, in this brief little journey    On over the isthmus, down into the tide,  We give him a fish instead of a serpent,    Ere folding the hands to be and abide    Forever and aye in dust at his side?    Look at the roses saluting each other;    Look at the herds all at peace on the plain;  Man, and man only, makes war on his brother,    And laughs in his heart at his peril and pain,    Shamed by the beasts that go down on the plain.    Is it worth while that we battle to humble    Some poor fellow down into the dust?  God pity us all! Time too soon will tumble    All of us together, like leaves in a gust,    Humbled, indeed, down into the dust.        _Joaquin Miller._          Life's Mirror      There are loyal hearts, there are spirits brave,    There are souls that are pure and true;  Then give to the world the best you have,    And the best will come back to you.    Give love, and love to your life will flow,    A strength in your utmost need;  Have faith, and a score of hearts will show    Their faith in your work and deed.    Give truth, and your gift will be paid in kind;    And honor will honor meet,  And the smile which is sweet will surely find    A smile that is just as sweet.    Give pity and sorrow to those who mourn;    You will gather in flowers again  The scattered seeds from your thought outborne,    Though the sowing seemed in vain.    For life is the mirror of king and slave;    'Tis just what we are and do;  Then give to the world the best you have,    And the best will come back to you.        _Madeline S. Bridges._          The Little Black-Eyed Rebel      A boy drove into the city, his wagon loaded down  With food to feed the people of the British-governed town;  And the little black-eyed rebel, so cunning and so sly,  Was watching for his coming from the corner of her eye.    His face was broad and honest, his hands were brown and tough,  The clothes he wore upon him were homespun, coarse, and rough;  But one there was who watched him, who long time lingered nigh,  And cast at him sweet glances from the corner of her eye.    He drove up to the market, he waited in the line--  His apples and potatoes were fresh and fair and fine.  But long and long he waited, and no one came to buy,  Save the black-eyed rebel, watching from the corner of her eye.    \"Now, who will buy my apples?\" he shouted, long and loud;  And, \"Who wants my potatoes?\" he repeated to the crowd.  But from all the people round him came no word of reply,  Save the black-eyed rebel, answering from the corner of her eye.    For she knew that 'neath the lining of the coat he wore that day  Were long letters from the husbands and the fathers far away,  Who were fighting for the freedom that they meant to gain, or die;  And a tear like silver glistened in the corner of her eye.    But the treasures--how to get them? crept the question through her mind,  Since keen enemies were watching for what prizes they might find;  And she paused a while and pondered, with a pretty little sigh,  Then resolve crept through her features, and a shrewdness fired her eye.    So she resolutely walked up to the wagon old and red--  \"May I have a dozen apples for a kiss?\" she sweetly said;  And the brown face flushed to scarlet, for the boy was somewhat shy,  And he saw her laughing at him from the corner of her eye.    \"You may have them all for nothing, and more, if you want,\" quoth he.  \"I will have them, my good fellow, but can pay for them,\" said she.  And she clambered on the wagon, minding not who all were by,  With a laugh of reckless romping in the corner of her eye.    Clinging round his brawny neck, she clasped her fingers white and small,  And then whispered, \"Quick! the letters! thrust them underneath my shawl!  Carry back again _this_ package, and be sure that you are spry!\"  And she sweetly smiled upon him from the corner of her eye.    Loud the motley crowd was laughing at the strange, ungirlish freak;  And the boy was scared and panting, and so dashed he could not speak.  And \"Miss, I have good apples,\" a bolder lad did cry;  But she answered, \"No, I thank you,\" from the corner of her eye.    With the news from loved ones absent to the dear friends they would greet,  Searching them who hungered for them, swift she glided through the street.  \"There is nothing worth the doing that it does not pay to try,\"  Thought the little black-eyed rebel with a twinkle in her eye.        _Will Carleton._          A Day Well Spent      If you sit down at set of sun  And count the deeds that you have done,  And, counting, find  One self-denying act, one word that eased the heart of him that heard;  One glance most kind, which felt like sunshine where it went,  Then you may count that day well spent.    But if through, all the livelong day  You've eased no heart by yea or nay,  If through it all you've nothing done that you can trace  That brought the sunshine to one face,  No act most small that helped some soul and nothing cost,  Then count that day as worse than lost.        Say Not the Struggle Nought Availeth      Say not the struggle nought availeth,    The labor and the wounds are vain,  The enemy faints not, nor faileth,    And as things have been they remain.    If hopes were dupes, fears may be liars;    It may be, in yon smoke concealed,  Your comrades chase e'en now the fliers,    And, but for you, possess the field.    For while the tired waves, vainly breaking,    Seem here no painful inch to gain,  Far back, through creeks and inlets making,    Comes silent, flooding in, the main,    And not by eastern windows only,    When daylight comes, comes in the light,  In front, the sun climbs slow, how slowly,    But westward, look, the land is bright.        _A.H. Clough._          The Miller of the Dee      There dwelt a miller, hale and bold,    Beside the river Dee;  He worked and sang from morn till night--    No lark more blithe than he;  And this the burden of his song    Forever used to be:  \"I envy nobody--no, not I--    And nobody envies me!\"    \"Thou'rt wrong, my friend,\" said good King Hal,    \"As wrong as wrong can be;  For could my heart be light as thine,    I'd gladly change with thee.  And tell me now, what makes thee sing,    With voice so loud and free,  While I am sad, though I'm a king,    Beside the river Dee?\"    The miller smiled and doffed his cap,    \"I earn my bread,\" quoth he;  \"I love my wife, I love my friend,    I love my children three;  I owe no penny I cannot pay,    I thank the river Dee "]]]
