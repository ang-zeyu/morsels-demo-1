When, after several years of prodigious labor, Pasteur ventured to  assert himself, they took advantage of his following the dictates of  humanity in accepting all sorts of cases, curable or not, to spread a  report that his treatment did not cure, but instead gave the disease  which it was supposed to cure. Popular fury was aroused to such a  height, that a monster mass meeting was held _against_ Pasteur. Louise  Michel addressed this meeting with her customary vigor of speech and  amidst frantic applause shouted this unqualified remark, \"_Scientific  questions should be settled by the people._\"    By this time everybody was talking about microbes, and a shop on the  boulevards announced an exhibition of them. They used what is known as a  solar microscope and threw on a screen, suitably enlarged, the  animalculae which grow in impure water, the larvae of mosquitoes, and  other insects, which bear about the same relation to microbes that an  elephant does to a flea. I went into this establishment, and saw the  plain people with their wives looking at the exhibition very seriously  and really believing that they saw the famous microbes. One of them near  me said, with a knowing air, \"What won't science do next?\"    I was indignant, and I had all I could do to keep from saying: \"They are  fooling you. What they are showing you is not Science, at the most only  its antechamber. As for you who are deceiving these naive good people,  you are only impostors.\"    But I kept still; I would only have succeeded in getting thrown out. But  I said to myself--and I still say--\"Why not enlighten these people, who  obviously want light?\" It is impossible to _teach_ them science, but it  should be possible to make them at least comprehend what science _is_,  for they have no idea of it now. They do not know--in this era when they  are constantly talking about their rights and urged to demand more wages  and less work--that there are young people who are spending their best  years and leading a precarious existence, working day and night, without  hope of personal profit, with no other end in view besides the hope of  discovering new facts from which humanity may benefit at some time in  the future. They do not know that all the benefits of civilization which  they carelessly enjoy are the result of the long, painful and enormous  work of the thinkers whom they regard as idlers and visionaries who grow  rich from the sweat of the toilers. In a word, they should be taught to  give respect to what is worthy of it.    It is true that there are scientific congresses, but these are serious  gatherings which attract only the select few. It should be possible to  interest everybody, and in order to make scientific meetings interesting  we should use motion pictures and concerts.    But here we trench on art. We ought to teach the people not only science  but art as well, but the latter is the more difficult.           *       *       *       *       *    Modern peoples are not artistic. The Greeks were, and the Japanese were,  before the European invasion. An artistic people is recognized by their  ignorance of \"objects of art,\" for in such an environment art is  everywhere. An artistic people no more dreams of creating art than a  great nobleman of consciously exhibiting a distinguished manner.  Distinction lies in his slightest mannerism without his being conscious  of the fact. So, among artistic peoples, the most ordinary and humble  objects have style. And this style, furthermore, is in perfect harmony  with the purpose of the object. It is absolutely appropriate for that  purpose in its proportions, in the purity of its lines, the elegance of  its form, its perfection of execution, and, above all, in its meaning.  When an outcry is raised against the ugliness and tawdriness of certain  objects in this country, the answer is, \"But see how cheap they are!\"  But style and conscience in work cost nothing. Feeling for art is,  however, inherent in human nature. The weapons of primitive peoples are  beautiful. The prehistoric hatchets of the Stone Age are perfect in  their contours. There is, therefore, no question of creating a feeling  for art in the people, but of awakening it.    Music holds so important a place in the modern world, that we ought to  begin with that. There is plenty of gay music, easy to understand, which  is in harmony with the laws of art, and the people ought to hear it  instead of the horrors which they cram into our ears under the pretence  of satisfying our tastes. What pleases people most is sentimental music,  but it need not be a silly sentimentality. Instead, they ought to give  the people the charming airs which grow, as naturally as daisies on a  lawn, in the vast field of opera-comique. That is not high art, it is  true, but it is pretty music and it is high art compared with what is  heard too often in the cafes. I am not ignorant of the fact that such  establishments employ talented people. But along with the good, what  frightful things one hears! And no one would listen to their  instrumental repertoire anywhere else!    Every time anyone has tried to raise the standards and employ real  singers and real _virtuosi_, the attendance has increased. But, very  often, even at the theatres, the managers satisfy their own tastes under  the pretence of satisfying that of the public. That is, of course,  intensely human. We judge others by ourselves.    A famous manager once said to me, as he pointed to an empty house, \"The  public is amazing. Give them what they like, and they don't come!\"    One day I was walking in a garden. There was a bandstand and musicians  were playing some sort of music. The crowd was indifferent and passed by  talking without paying the slightest attention. Suddenly there sounded  the first notes of the delightful _andante_ of Beethoven's _Symphony in  D_--a flower of spring with a delicate perfume. At the first notes all  walking and talking stopped. And the crowd stood motionless and in an  almost religious silence as it listened to the marvel. When the piece  was over, I went out of the garden, and near the entrance I heard one of  the managers say,    \"There, you see they don't like that kind of music.    And that kind of music was never played there again.          CHAPTER IX    ANARCHY IN MUSIC      Music is as old as human nature. We can get some idea of what it was at  first from the music of savage tribes. There were a few notes and  rudimentary melodies with blows struck in cadence as an accompaniment;  or, sometimes, the same primitive rhythms without any accompaniment--and  nothing else! Then melody was perfected and the rhythms became more  complicated. Later came Greek music, of which we know little, and the  music of the East and Far East.    Music, as we now understand the term, began with the attempts at harmony  in the Middle Ages. These attempts were labored and difficult, and the  uncertainty of their gropings, combined with the slowness of their  development, excites our wonder. Centuries were necessary before the  writing of music became exact, but, slowly, laws were elaborated.  Thanks to them the works of the Sixteenth Century came into being, in  all their admirable purity and learned polyphony. Hard and inflexible  laws engendered an art analogous to primitive painting. Melody was  almost entirely absent and was relegated to dance tunes and popular  songs. But the dance tunes of the time, on which, perhaps, erudition was  not used sufficiently, were written in the same polyphonic style and  with the same rigid correctness as the madrigals and the church music.    We know that the popular songs found their way into the church music and  that Palestrina's great reform consisted in banishing them. However, we  should get but a feeble idea of the part they played, if we imagined  that they naturally belonged there. Take a well known air, _Au Claire de  la Lune_, for example, and make each note a whole note sung by the  tenor, while the other voices dialogue back and forth in counterpoint,  and see what is left of the song for the listener. The scandal of _La  Messe de l'Homme arme_ was entirely theoretical.    We simply do not know how they played these anthems, masses, and  madrigals, in the absence of any indication of either the time or the  emphasis. We find a few directions for expression, as in the first  measures of Palestrina's _Stabat Mater_ but such directions are  extremely rare. They are simply the first signs of the dawn of the  far-off day of music with expression. Certain learned and  well-intentioned persons endeavor to compare this music with ours, and  we surprise in some of the modern editions instances of _molto  expressivo_ which seem to be good guesses. This exclusively consonant  music, in which the intervals of fourths were considered dissonant,  while the diminishing fifth was the _diabolus in musica_, ought from its  very nature to be antithetical to expression. Nothing in the _Kyrie, in  La Messe du Pape Marcel_, gives the impression of a prayer, unless  expressive accents, without any real justification, are introduced by  main strength.    Expression came into existence with the chord of the dominant seventh  from which all modern harmony developed. This invention is attributed to  Monteverde. No matter what has been said, however, it occurs in  Palestrina's _Adoremus_. Floods of ink have been poured out in  discussing this question, some affirming, while others--and not the  least, by any manner of means--denying the existence of the famous  chord. No equivocation is possible. It is a simultaneously played chord  held by four voices for a whole measure. What is certain is that  Palestrina, by putting aside the rules, made a discovery, the  significance of which he did not realize.    With the introduction of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16462"],[0,"With the Boer Forces (#10)"],[1," rifles and bandoliers, and all wore the ordinary garb of a civilian, so  that there was nothing to indicate the man's military standing. The  officers associated with their men every hour of the day, and, in most  instances, were able to call the majority of them by their Christian  names. With one or two exceptions, all the generals were farmers before  the war started, and consequently they were unable to assume any great  degree of superiority over their farmer-burghers if they had wished to do  so. General Meyer pitched quoits with his men, General Botha swapped  tobacco with any one of his burghers, and General Smuts and one of his  officers held the whist championship of their laager. Rarely a burgher  touched his hat before speaking to an officer, but he invariably shook  hands with him at meeting and parting. It is a Boer custom to shake hands  with friends or strangers, and whenever a general visited a laager  adjoining his own, the hand-shaking reminded one of the President's public  reception days at Washington. When General Joubert went from camp to camp  he greeted all the burghers who came near him with a grasp of the hand,  and it was the same with all the other generals and officers. Whenever  Presidents Kruger and Steyn went to the commandos, they held out their  right hands to all the burghers who approached them, and one might have  imagined that every Boer was personally acquainted with every other one in  the republics. It was the same with strangers who visited the laagers, and  many a sore wrist testified to the Boer's republicanism. Some one called  it the \"hand-shaking army,\" and it was a most descriptive title. Many of  the burghers could not restrain from exercising their habit, and shook  hands with British prisoners, much to the astonishment of the captured.    Another striking feature of life in the Boer laagers was the deep  religious feeling which manifested itself in a thousand different ways. It  is an easy matter for an irreligious person to scoff at men who pass  through a campaign with prayer and hymn-singing, and it is just as easy to  laugh at the man who reads his Testament at intervals of shooting at the  enemy. The Boer was a religious man always, and when he went to war he  placed as much faith in prayer and in his Testament as in his rifle. He  believed that his cause was just, and that the Lord would favour those  fighting for a righteous cause in a righteous spirit. On October 11th,  before the burghers crossed the frontier at Laing's Nek, a religious  service was conducted. Every burgher in the commandos knelt on the ground  and uttered a prayer for the success and the speedy ending of the  campaign. Hymns were sung, and for a full hour the hills, whereon almost  twenty years before many of the same burghers sang and prayed after the  victory at Majuba, were resounding with the religious and patriotic songs  of men going forward to kill and to be killed. In their laagers the Boers  had religious services at daybreak and after sunset every day, whether  they were near to the enemy or far away. At first the novelty of being  awakened early in the morning by the voices of a large commando of  burghers was not conducive to a religious feeling in the mind of the  stranger, but a short stay in the laagers caused anger to turn to  admiration. After sunset the burghers again gathered in groups around  camp-fires, and made the countryside re-echo with the sound of their deep,  bass voices united in Dutch hymns and psalms of praise and thanksgiving.    Whether they ate a big meal from a well-equipped table, or whether they  leaped from their horses to make a hasty meal of biltong and bread, they  reverently bowed their heads and asked a blessing before and after eating.  Before they went into battle they gathered around their general and were  led in prayer by the man who afterwards led them against the enemy. When  the battle was concluded, and whether the field was won or lost, prayers  were offered to the God of battles. In the reports which generals and  commandants made to the war departments, victories and defeats were  invariably ascribed to the will of God, and such phrases as \"All the glory  belongs to the Lord of Hosts who led us,\" and \"God gave us the victory,\"  and \"Divine favour guided our footsteps,\" were frequent. When one is a  stranger of the Boers and unacquainted with the simple faith which they  place in Divine guidance, these religious manifestations may appear  inopportune in warfare, but it is necessary to observe the Boer burgher in  all his various actions and emotions to know that he is sincere in his  religious beliefs and that he endeavours to be a Christian in deed as well  as in word.    The Boer army, like Cromwell's troopers, could fight as well as pray, but  in reality it was not a fighting organisation in the sense that warfare  was agreeable to the burghers. The Boer proved that he could fight when  there was a necessity for it, but to the great majority of them it was  heartrending to slay their fellow human beings. The Boer's hand was better  adapted to the stem of a pipe than to the stock of an army rifle, and he  would rather have been engaged in the former peaceful pursuit had he not  believed that it was a holy war in which he was engaged. That he was not  eager for fighting was displayed in a hundred different ways. He loved his  home more than the laagers at the front, and he took advantage of every  opportunity to return to his home and family. He lusted not for battle,  and he seldom engaged in one unless he firmly believed that success  depended partly upon his individual presence. He did not go into battle  because he had the lust of blood, for he abhorred the slaughter of men,  and it was not an extraordinary spectacle to see a Boer weeping beside the  corpse of a British soldier. On the field, after the Spion Kop battle,  where Boer guns did their greatest execution, there were scores of  bare-headed Boers who deplored the war, and amidst ejaculations of \"Poor  Tommy,\" and \"This useless slaughter,\" brushed away the tears that rolled  down over their brown cheeks and beards. Never a Boer was seen to exult  over a victory. They might say \"That is good\" when they heard of a Spion  Kop or a Magersfontein, but never a shout or any other of the ordinary  methods of expressing joy. The foreigners in the army frequently were  beside themselves with joy after victories, but the Boers looked stolidly  on and never took any part in the demonstrations.          CHAPTER IV    THE ARMY ORGANISATION      When the Boer goes on a lion-hunting expedition he must be thoroughly  acquainted with the game country; he must be experienced in the use of the  rifle, and he must know how to protect himself against the attacks of the  enemy. When he is thus equipped and he abandons lion-hunting for the more  strenuous life of war the Boer is a formidable enemy, for he has combined  in him the qualities of a general as well as the powers of a private  soldier. In lion-hunting the harm of having too many men in authority is  not so fatal to the success of the expedition as it is in real warfare,  where the enemy may have less generals but a larger force of men who will  obey their commands. All the successes of the Boer army were the result of  the fact that every burgher was a general, and to the same cause may be  attributed almost every defeat. Whenever this army of generals combined  and agreed to do a certain work it was successful, but it was unsuccessful  whenever the generals disagreed. If the opportunity had given birth to a  man who would have been accepted as general of the generals--a man was  needed who could introduce discipline and training into the rudimentary  military system of the country--the chances of the Boer success would have  been far greater.    The leaders of the Boer army were elected by a vote of the people in the  same manner in which they chose their presidents and civil officials. Age,  ability, and military experience did not have any bearing on the subject  except in so far as they influenced the mind of the individual voter.  Family influences, party affiliations, and religion had a strong bearing  on the result of the elections, and, as is frequently the case with civil  authorities in other countries, the men with the best military minds and  experience were not always chosen. It was as a result of this system that  General Joubert was at the head of the army when a younger, more  energetic, and more warlike man should have been Commandant-General. At  the last election for Commandant-General, Joubert, a Progressive, also  received the support of the Conservatives, so that two years later he  might not be a candidate for the Presidency against Paul Kruger. In the  same manner the commandants of the districts and the field-cornets of the  wards were chosen, and in the majority of the cases no thought was taken  of their military ability at the time of the election. The voters of a  ward, the lowest political division in the country, elected their  field-cornet more with a view of having him administer the laws in times  of peace than with the idea of having him lead them into a battle, and in  like manner the election of a commandant for a district, which generally  consisted of five wards, was more of a victory for his popularity in peace  than for his presumed bravery in war. The Boer system of electing military  leaders by vote of the people may have had certain advantages, but it had  the negative advantage of effacing all traces of authority between  officers and men. The burgher who had assisted in electing his  field-cornet felt that that official owed him a certain amount of  gratitude for having voted for him, and obeyed his orders or disobeyed  them whenever he chose to do so. The field-cornet represented authority  over his men, but of real authority there was none. The commandants were  presumed to have"]]]
