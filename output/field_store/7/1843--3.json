At the  same time Hubert, a widower by Isabella of Gloucester's death, wedded  Alexander's elder sister, Margaret, a match which compensated the  justiciar for his loss of Isabella's lands. Four years later, Isabella,  the King of Scot's younger sister, was united with Roger Bigod, the  young Earl of Norfolk, a grandson of the great William Marshal, whose  eldest son and successor, William Marshal the younger, was in 1224  married to the king's third sister, Eleanor. The policy of  intermarriage between the royal family and the baronage was defended by  the example of Philip Augustus in France, and on the ground of the  danger to the royal interests if so strong a magnate as the earl  marshal were enticed away from his allegiance by an alliance with a  house unfriendly to Henry.[1]        [1] _Royal Letters_, i., 244-46.    The futility of marriage alliances in modifying policy was already made  clear by the attitude of Llewelyn ap Iorwerth, the husband of Henry's  bastard sister Joan. This resourceful prince had already raised himself  to a high position by a statecraft which lacked neither strength nor  duplicity. Though fully conscious of his position as the champion of a  proud nation, and, posing as the peer of the King of Scots, Llewelyn  saw that it was his interest to continue the friendship with the  baronial opposition which had profited him so greatly in the days of  the French invasion. The pacification arranged in 1218 sat rightly upon  him, and he plunged into a war with William Marshal the younger that  desolated South Wales for several years. In 1219 Llewelyn devastated  Pembrokeshire so cruelly that the marshal's losses were currently,  though absurdly, reported to have exceeded the amount of the ransom of  King Richard. There was much more fighting, but Llewelyn's progress was  impeded by difficulties with his own son Griffith, and with the princes  of South Wales, who bore impatiently the growing hold of the lord of  Gwynedd upon the affections of southern Welshmen. There was war also in  the middle march, where in 1220 a royal army was assembled against  Llewelyn; but Pandulf negotiated a truce, and the only permanent result  of this effort was the fortification of the castle and town at  Montgomery, which had become royal demesne on the extinction of the  ancient house of Bollers a few years earlier. But peace never lasted  long west of the Severn, and in 1222 William Marshal drove Llewelyn out  of Cardigan and Carmarthen. Again there were threats of war. Llewelyn  was excommunicated, and his lands put under interdict. The marshal  complained bitterly of the poor support which Henry gave him against  the Welsh, but Hubert restored cordiality between him and the king. In  these circumstances the policy of marrying Eleanor to the indignant  marcher was a wise one. Llewelyn however could still look to the active  friendship of Randolph of Chester. While the storm of war raged in  South Wales, the march between Cheshire and Gwynedd enjoyed unwonted  peace, and in 1223 a truce was patched up through Randolph's mediation.    Earl Randolph needed the Welsh alliance the more because he definitely  threw in his lot with the enemies of Hubert de Burgh. In April, 1223, a  bull of Honorius III. declared Henry competent to govern in his own  name, a change which resulted in a further strengthening of Hubert's  power. Towards the end of the year Randolph joined with William of  Albemarle, the Bishop of Winchester and Falkes de Breaute, in an  attempt to overthrow the justiciar. The discontented barons took arms  and laid their grievances before the king. They wished, they said, no  ill to king or kingdom, but simply desired to remove the justiciar from  his counsels. Hot words passed between the indignant Hubert and Peter  des Roches, and the conference broke up in confusion. The barons still  remained mutinous, and, while the king held his Christmas court at  Northampton, they celebrated the feast at Leicester. At last Langton  persuaded both parties to come to an agreement on the basis of king's  friends and barons alike surrendering their castles and wardships. This  was a substantial victory for the party of order, and during the next  few months much was done to transfer the castles to loyal hands.  Randolph himself surrendered Shrewsbury and Bridgnorth.    Comparative peace having been restored, and the judicial bench purged  of feudal partisans, private persons ventured to complain of outrageous  acts of \"novel disseisin\", or unlawful appropriation of men's lands. In  the spring of 1224 the king's justices went throughout the country,  hearing and deciding pleas of this sort. Sixteen acts of novel  disseisin were proved against Falkes de Breaute. Despite all the  efforts of Langton and Hubert, that able adventurer, though stripped of  some of his castles, fully maintained the position which he first  acquired in the service of John. He was not the man to put up tamely  with the piecemeal destruction of his power by legal process, and,  backed up secretly by the feudal leaders, resolved to take the law into  his own hands. One of the most active of the judges in hearing  complaints against him was Henry of Braybrook. Falkes bade his brother,  William de Breaute fall upon the justice, who had been hearing suits at  Dunstable, and take him prisoner. William faithfully fulfilled his  brother's orders, and on June 17 the unlucky judge was safely shut up  in a dungeon of Bedford Castle, of which William had the custody, as  his brother's agent. So daring an outrage on the royal authority was  worse than the action of William of Albemarle four years before. Hubert  and the archbishop immediately took strong measures to enforce the  sanctity of the law. While Langton excommunicated Falkes and his  abettors, Hubert hastily turned against the traitor the forces which  were assembling at Northampton with the object of reconquering Poitou.  Braybrook was captured on Monday. On Thursday the royal troops besieged  Bedford.    The siege lasted from June 20 to August 14. The \"noble castle of  Bedford\" was new, large, and fortified with an inner and outer baily,  and two strong towers. Falkes trusted that it would hold out for a year,  and had amply provided it with provisions and munitions of war. In  effect, though William de Breaute and his followers showed a gallant  spirit, it resisted the justiciar for barely two months. When called  upon to surrender the garrison answered that they would only yield at  their lord's orders, and that the more as they were not bound to the  king by homage or fealty. Nothing was left but a fight to the death. The  royalists made strenuous efforts. A new scutage, the \"scutage of  Bedford,\" was imposed on the realm. Meanwhile Falkes fled to his  accomplice, the Earl of Chester, and afterwards took refuge with  Llewelyn. But the adventurer found such cold comfort from the great men  who had lured him to his ruin that he perforce made his way back to  England, along with a motley band of followers, English and French,  Scottish and Welsh.[1] A hue and cry was raised after him, and, like  William of Albemarle, he was forced to throw himself into sanctuary,  while Randolph of Chester openly joined the besiegers of Bedford. In his  refuge in a church at Coventry, Falkes was persuaded to surrender to the  bishop of the diocese, who handed him over to Langton.        [1] The names of his _familia_ taken with him are in _Patent      Rolls of Henry III._, 1216-1227, pp. 461-62.    During Falkes's wanderings his brother had been struggling valiantly  against overwhelming odds. _Petrariae_ and mangonels threw huge stones  into the castle, and effected breaches in keep and curtain. Miners  undermined the walls, while over-against the stronghold two lofty  structures of wood were raised, from which the crossbowmen, who manned  them, were able to command the whole of the interior. At last the  castle was captured in four successive assaults. In the first the  barbican was taken; in the next the outer baily was stormed; in the  third the interior baily was won; and in the last the keep was split  asunder. The garrison then allowed the women and captives, including  the wife of Falkes and the unlucky Braybrook, to make their way to the  enemies' lines. Next day the defenders themselves surrendered. The only  mercy shown to these gallant men was that they were allowed to make  their peace with the Church before their execution. Of the eighty  prisoners, three Templars alone were spared.    Falkes threw himself upon the king's mercy, appealing to his former  services to Henry and his father. He surrendered to the King the large  sums of money which he had deposited with his bankers, the Templars of  London, and ordered his castellans in Plympton and the other  west-country castles of his wife to open their gates to the royal  officers. In return for these concessions he was released from  excommunication. His life was spared, but his property was confiscated,  and he was ordered to abjure the realm. Even his wife deserted him,  protesting that she had been forced to marry him against her will. On  October 26 he received letters of safe conduct to go beyond sea. As he  left England, he protested that he had been instigated by the English  magnates in all that he had done. On landing at Fecamp he was detained  by his old enemy Louis, then, by his father's death, King of France.  But Louis VIII. was the last man to bear old grudges against the Norman  adventurer, especially as Falkes's rising had enabled him to capture  the chief towns of Poitou.    Even in his exile Falkes was still able to do mischief. He obtained his  release from Louis' prison about Easter, 1225, on the pretence of going  on crusade. He then made his way to Rome where he strove to excite the  sympathy of Honorius III., by presenting an artful memorial, which  throws a flood of light upon his character, motives,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16702"],[0,"The New York Times Current History of the European War, Vol. 1, January 9, 1915 (#10)"],[1,"by quoting the Russian  excuse \"that Russia's mobilization was only for a defense against  Austria.\" On close examination what does this amount to? It resolves  itself into a situation somewhat like this: A sends an ultimatum to B  seeking redress for a wrong committed by B upon A, whereupon C mobilizes  \"for defense against A.\" I leave it to the average American of ordinary  intelligence to find a reason for C's mobilization \"for defense against  A.\" Mr. Beck might as well try to justify a mobilization on the part of  Japan if the United States was preparing to invade Mexico for the  purpose of redressing an insult to the American flag. Does Mr. Beck  realize the seriousness of actual mobilization by Russia at that  critical moment? Not one of the other powers dared to take this one step  which among nations is regarded as tantamount to a declaration of war.    And what did the Kaiser do at this moment? He did the only thing he  could do, and, I dare say, the only thing our American Nation could have  done under the same circumstances. He wired the Czar and stated: \"I am  willing to bring my influences to bear upon Austria, provided you agree  to cease mobilization.\" Was this demand unreasonable? What else could  Germany have done, I ask, with the Russian bear standing on the border  with the sword already drawn? This moment was the crucial and decisive  one in the prologue to this awful world drama.    The only question therefore and the all-important one to be submitted to  the Court of Civilization, is, Whose duty was it to yield? Was it  Russia's, with the sword already drawn against a country which had not  attacked it, not even threatened it, or was it Germany's, with the sword  in the sheath?    In his \"conclusion,\" Mr. Beck speaks of Germany as \"beset on every hand  by powerful antagonists.\" Does he really mean to deprive the German  Emperor of the right to demand as a condition precedent to mediation on  his part the discontinuance of mobilization by Russia?    Mr. Beck in his \"judgment\" under Paragraph 4 says \"that Austria, having  mobilized its army, Russia was reasonably justified in mobilizing its  forces.\" The use of the qualifying word \"reasonably\" seems to indicate  that even Mr. Beck is not quite certain that Russia was in fact  justified in mobilizing its forces.    Is it reasonable, just, and fair of Mr. Beck to expect Germany, \"beset  on every hand by powerful antagonists,\" to permit Russia to continue  mobilizing its 18,000,000 soldiers and have Germany believe that Russia  was sincere in its \"peaceful intentions\" in the face of actual  mobilization? At this moment the German Kaiser made a very reasonable  demand upon Russia to cease mobilization, and I ask every fair-minded  American, whether lawyer or layman, \"whose duty it was to yield\" at this  moment. The answer to this question will settle the much-disputed point  as to the actual cause of the war.    In conclusion, I beg to ask Mr. Beck: Why expect so much of Germany and  nothing of Russia, when Germany had not merely professed her peaceful  intentions, but actually maintained peace for over forty years, during  which period not a foot of territory had been acquired by her through  conquest? This is a fact.    Coming into a court of law supported by such a reputation, does Mr. Beck  really believe that the decision of the court would have been in favor  of Russia? Does Mr. Beck really believe that the decision would have  been against Germany, whose war lord was begging the Czar almost on his  knees to avoid the awful calamity by the discontinuance of mobilization?    Picture the United States about to invade Mexico to redress an insult to  the American flag. Picture England as the ally of the United States, and  Japan supporting Mexico, without any alliance existing between the two  latter countries. To make this example conform to the actual facts under  discussion, we must, of course, assume that both Japan and England are  situated in the North American Continent, and across the border from the  United States and England. Japan, with an army of 18,000,000 soldiers,  (assumed for the purpose of argument,) mobilizes her army, professedly  for defense against the United States. Could any fair-minded American  possibly expect England to intercede with her ally, the United States,  without first demanding the demobilization of Japan? Whose duty was it  to yield?    The actual fact is that Germany even then did not declare war against  Russia until Russian soldiers had actually crossed not the Austrian but  the German border.    I may add that in writing the above I am prompted only by the very  natural desire, viz., to impress upon the jury composed of the American  people the one fact which should be given the most careful consideration  in order to enable it to arrive at a just verdict in the case submitted,  and this fact is \"the mobilization of Russia.\"    FRANK SEGGEBRUCH.    New York, Oct. 29, 1914.          In Defense of Austria      _To the Editor of The New York Times:_    Referring to your editorial, \"The Evidence Examined,\" in your Sunday  edition, I wish to protest emphatically against your assertion that a  \"Court of Civilization\" must inevitably come to the conclusion that  Germany precipitated the war. There are still millions of civilized  people who see these things quite differently.    Mr. Beck makes out a case from the viewpoint of the accusing party--of  course, nobody will doubt the legal abilities of Mr. Beck--but before  the Supreme Court of Civilization there is also a law: audiatur et  altera pars. Mr. Beck, as he presents the case to the court, has not  mentioned very important points which, for the decision of the Supreme  Court, would be most vital ones.    At first the breach of Belgian neutrality, admitted and regretted by the  German Government, has nothing to do with the question--who precipitated  the war? It constituted only an action of the war itself. On the other  hand, you call in your editorial the Austrian ultimatum a savage one  and take it for granted that this ultimatum started the stone rolling  and brought finally the general clash in Europe about. This presumption,  when presented to the court, will have to be thoroughly proved, because  there are many people, fair and just, as you consider yourself, who are  convinced of the ample justification of this ultimatum.    It is hardly describable how many criminal acts have been committed by  Servians against the very existence of the Dual Monarchy for the last  six years, under the eyes of the Servian Government and approved by it,  by intriguing against Austria's right to cultivate her own territory,  Bosnia, spreading secret societies all over the empire, &c.    The awful crime, the assassination of the heir to the throne, was only  the finish of a long chain of like acts. These facts, which immediately  lead up to the ultimatum, ought to be considered in the first place by  judging Austria's justification for sending this ultimatum to Servia. A  just Judge in the Court of Civilization will, I am convinced, carefully  study the ante-history and in all probability arrive at the conclusion  that the ultimatum was amply justified and Servia fully deserved the  severest punishment possible.    Mr. Beck presents to the court the Russian interference with this  intended punishment and forgets to tell the Judge that Russia had not  the least right to this interference. No foreign power had.    Therefore, Austria was entirely within her right to decline any  negotiations with Russia about this punishment before its completion.  Nevertheless, the German Government brought these negotiations about,  and, while these negotiations proceeded satisfactorily, Russia  mobilized, mobilized all along her western frontier against Austria and  Germany, notwithstanding the fact that she had promised not to do so and  officials in Petrograd had pledged their words to the contrary.    Russia knew there could be no such thing as a war with Austria alone, as  well as Germany knew that a war with Russia meant a war with France. If  the laws of morality rule in the Court of Civilization, they should  above all be applied to the conduct of Servia and Russia. Austria was in  a state of self-defense, when she decided not to bear any longer  Servia's treacherous and murderous attacks against her existence; this  is entirely within the boundaries of the laws of morality. Russia,  however, without the slightest right, moral or legal, attacked Austria  from the back by interfering with Austria's own affairs.    Therefore I wish to point out that a careful student of the papers, by  considering the ante-history of the war, which, as you will admit, is  very essential, may come to a quite different conclusion and Mr. Beck as  State's attorney will have a hard stand against the counsel of the  defendant.    EDWARD PICK.    New York, Oct. 27, 1914.    [Illustration]          Defense of the Dual Alliance--A Reply    By Dr. Edmund von Mach.         Instructor of Fine Arts, Harvard, 1899-1903; Instructor in       History of Art, Wellesley College, 1899-1902; Lecturer in       History of Art, Bradford Academy, Cambridge, Mass. Author of       many books on Greek and Roman sculpture and the history of       painting. Served in the German Army, 1889-91.      Hon. James M. Beck has eloquently argued the case of the Allies against  Germany and Austria-Hungary, and submitted his findings with confident  assurance of their acceptance by the Supreme Court of Civilization.  Carried away by his zeal he has at times used terms not warranted by the  evidence, such as \"the irrepressible Kaiser,\" \"stupid falsehood,\"  \"duplicity,\" and the like, but since the court can be trusted to  disregard such expressions no further attention will be paid to them.    To a certain extent this article is not a reply but a continuation of  Mr. Beck's argument, for, wherever our personal sympathies may lie,"]]]
