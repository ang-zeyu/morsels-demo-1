Dr. Barth[6] has made a very interesting journey to Aghadez. He says the  track lies either through fine valleys or over mountain-chains cut up by  defiles. Here and there were charming spots, green with herbage and  trees. In going, the shallow wells at Eghelloua were found to be full of  water; but a month later they were all dry. Beyond is the Wady Chizolen,  overlooked by a mountain that rises abruptly to the height of two  thousand feet. Then comes the valley of Eghellal, with its rivulet, and  beyond swell the famous mountains of the Baghzem. The worthy Doctor  seems to have been too much occupied in collecting geographical data to  preserve many picturesque facts by the way. On the third day he encamped  at Tiggedah, where numerous species of trees and bushes tufted the  valley, which was clothed also, near the margin of its streams, with  grass as fresh and green as any in Europe. At that time, however, the  place, with the exception of the cooing of wild doves and the cry of a  solitary antelope, seemed perfectly unvisited by man. Afterwards, it was  found full of flocks and herds, and enlivened by the encampment of a  salt-caravan, with a string of young camels bound for Aghadez. The tribe  to whom the valley belongs are nomadic, and shift from one place to  another, as their fancies and necessities suggest. Amidst the trees,  however, may be seen a small mosque, built of stone and roofed with  palm-trees.      [6] See the papers read before the Geographical Society, in        January and March 1851. It appears to me that Mr. A.        Petermann slightly depresses the importance of the part        played by Mr. Richardson in this mission. However, this may        arise from the fact that the communications on which his        paper was founded were all from his German friends. It is        not necessary to be grudging of notice to any of the three        enterprising gentlemen who undertook this arduous journey;        but we must always remember who planned the Mission, and        who directed it with consummate prudence as long as life        and strength lasted. In Mr. Richardson's MS. an outline is        given of Dr. Barth's journey, and I therefore insert it,        with corrections and additions, from the papers just        alluded to.--ED.    This agreeable place prefaces the still more luxuriant scenery of  Asadah, where the vegetation is so rich, and the path so shut up by  branches, that it is difficult to keep on the camel's back. What a  contrast to the naked deserts of Ghat! It was from between the rich  foliage of this valley that Dr. Barth obtained his first glimpses of the  majestic mountain-chain of Dogem, estimated to attain the height of  between four and five thousand feet. It is the loftiest range in Aheer.    The plain of Erarer-en-Dendemu, which next succeeds, is covered with  brushwood and low trees, and inhabited by lions--here called the Father  of the Wilderness. Dr. Barth saw several, as well as a kind of ape about  the size of a small boy, squatting in crowds on the lower hills. Beyond,  overhung by the mountains of Anderas, is the rocky plain of Tarist,  famous among the Arabs, as well as the Kailouees, on account of the  remains of a mosque, indicated only by lines of stones on the ground. It  was founded by a great saint called Sidi Baghdadi, and is a general  resting-place for caravans. The basaltic formation here succeeds the  granitic; and the plain is covered with loose black stones, about the  size of a child's head.    Escaping from this rough ground, the travellers entered a narrow valley,  trenched by a broad watercourse, along the sides of which was a thick  growth of palm-trees. There are two villages in this wady. Near one of  them slaves were seen yoked to a plough, and driven like oxen, by their  master. Further south the hoe replaces the plough in preparing the  ground. This valley, inhabited by the Imrad (a Targhee tribe), is  capable of producing not only ghaseb, but corn, wine, dates, and all  kinds of vegetables. Fifty gardens adorn, it is said, the neighbourhood  of Ifargen. But, in general, the rich soil is left uncultivated, and is  covered by wild and sickly vegetation, which checks the progress of the  traveller.    In Wadi Buddeh grows a prickly plant called karengia; and a parasite  (_griffenee_), producing a sweet but insipid berry of a red colour. A  party of five lions were pursued like so many jackals. A small caravan  of four persons, in Wadi Teffarrakad, were making use of four different  modes of progression: one was on a camel, another on a buffalo, the  third on a donkey, and the fourth used his own legs. In Wady Boghel were  the signs of a field of ghaseb having existed last year. The ground was  covered by a sickly wild melon; and in the thick foliage of the trees  the guinea-hens were cackling. Here Dr. Barth saw the first specimen of  the baure tree, the trunk measuring twenty-six feet in circumference,  and the thick crown rising to the height of eighty feet. Here and  elsewhere wild beasts were observed. The whole country, indeed, abounds  in lions, wild boars, gazelles, ostriches, and monkeys.    On the seventh day the party reached Aghadez, which they entered about  an hour after sunset, it being the custom in this country never to enter  a town by day. Aghadez is situated on a hamadah, or lofty plateau of  sandstone and granite formation. Around, although there is no arable  soil, a good deal of herbage and wood is found in the depressions of the  plain. It is not surprising, therefore, that this much-talked-of capital  is nothing but a large village, as indeed are all the other places of  Aheer, with the exception of Asoudee. Aghadez, which is mentioned by Leo  Africanus, is said by tradition to have been founded or enlarged by  settlements from the north, consisting of a people called Arabs, but  probably Berbers, since expelled by the Tuaricks. It serves as a sort of  rendezvous between the Kailouees and the tribes to the south and west. A  peculiar language (Emghedesie) is spoken by the inhabitants in their  private intercourse; but Haussa is the idiom of trade. There are about  seven hundred inhabited houses scattered among the ruins; and of fifty  thousand people who must previously have lived within the walls, scarce  eight thousand remain.[7] The inhabitants are partly artizans, partly  merchants; but few caravans now pass on this route, and commerce with  Timbuctoo seems altogether to have ceased. The trade that exists is  entirely in provisions, principally in ghaseb, or millet, which is  imported from Damerghou. The system adopted is entirely one of  barter--the Aghadez money consisting of turkedi,[8] or dark-coloured  cotton for female clothing made in Soudan, Egyptian leather for sandals,  English calico, white shawls, cloves, pepper, pearls, &c. All these  objects are imported, the only manufactures of Aghadez being  leather-work (sandals and saddles) and coloured mats. I do not know what  materials are used in tanning. The Fezzanee gets assistance, according  to my fighi, from four trees--the graut, the ethel, the pomegranate, and  the essalan. The first and last are a species of acacia. Women and men  work in their houses at the production of these articles, and merchants  go and purchase _a domicile_, there being now no shops. There are three  market-places or bazaars, where prices are very low.      [7] This is Dr. Barth's statement, which I have introduced from        his own account. It will have been seen that Mr. Richardson        (see vol. i. \"Note on the Territorial Division of Aheer,\")        makes a much lower estimate. I may here remind the reader,        that even when in his diary Mr. Richardson inserts two        different and contradictory statements, I do not undertake        to select one and suppress the other, except in the case of        an obvious slip of the pen. Nor have I thought it necessary        to burden the page by indications of slightly different        assertions. A diary must necessarily abound with imperfect        observations, which correct or complete one another; and        perhaps the general impression left on the mind of the        reader--who accompanies, as it were, the writer in        receiving its various elements--is more like truth than it        would be after the perusal of one absolute dogmatic        statement.--ED.      [8] As an illustration of the previous note, I will observe        that this word is spelt in several different ways in the        MS., and I do not know which is the correct one.--ED.
