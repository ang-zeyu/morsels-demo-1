Let us try the sea-steed's daring,        Give the chafing courser rein.      Those who will may bide in quiet,        Let them praise their chosen land,      Feasting on a whale-steak diet,        In their home by Wonder-strand.    Then they sailed away to the northward past Wonder-strands and Keelness,  intending to cruise to the westward around the cape. They encountered  westerly gales, and were driven ashore in Ireland,[35-3] where they were  grievously maltreated and thrown into slavery. There Thorhall lost his  life, according to that which traders have related.    It is now to be told of Karlsefni, that he cruised southward off the  coast, with Snorri and Biarni, and their people. They sailed for a long  time, and until they came at last to a river, which flowed down from the  land into a lake, and so into the sea. There were great bars at the mouth  of the river, so that it could only be entered at the height of the  flood-tide. Karlsefni and his men sailed into the mouth of the river, and  called it there Hop [a small land-locked bay]. They found self-sown  wheat-fields on the land there, wherever there were hollows, and wherever  there was hilly ground, there were vines.[36-1] Every brook there was  full of fish. They dug pits, on the shore where the tide rose highest,  and when the tide fell, there were halibut in the pits. There were great  numbers of wild animals of all kinds in the woods. They remained there  half a month, and enjoyed themselves, and kept no watch. They had their  live-stock with them. Now one morning early, when they looked about them,  they saw a great number of skin-canoes,[36-2] and staves were brandished  from the boats, with a noise like flails, and they were revolved in the  same direction in which the sun moves. Then said Karlsefni: \"What may  this betoken?\" Snorri, Thorbrand's son, answers him: \"It may be, that  this is a signal of peace, wherefore let us take a white shield and  display it.\" And thus they did. Thereupon the strangers rowed toward  them, and went upon the land, marvelling at those whom they saw before  them. They were swarthy men,[36-3] and ill-looking, and the hair of their  heads was ugly. They had great eyes,[36-4] and were broad of cheek. They  tarried there for a time looking curiously at the people they saw before  them, and then rowed away, and to the southward around the point.    Karlsefni and his followers had built their huts above the lake, some of  their dwellings being near the lake, and others farther away. Now they  remained there that winter. No snow came there, and all of their  live-stock lived by grazing.[37-1] And when spring opened, they  discovered, early one morning, a great number of skin-canoes, rowing from  the south past the cape, so numerous, that it looked as if coals had been  scattered broadcast out before the bay; and on every boat staves were  waved. Thereupon Karlsefni and his people displayed their shields, and  when they came together, they began to barter with each other. Especially  did the strangers wish to buy red cloth, for which they offered in  exchange peltries and quite gray skins. They also desired to buy swords  and spears, but Karlsefni and Snorri forbade this. In exchange for  perfect unsullied skins, the Skrellings would take red stuff a span in  length, which they would bind around their heads. So their trade went on  for a time, until Karlsefni and his people began to grow short of cloth,  when they divided it into such narrow pieces, that it was not more than a  finger's breadth wide, but the Skrellings still continued to give just as  much for this as before, or more.    It so happened, that a bull,[37-2] which belonged to Karlsefni and his  people, ran out from the woods, bellowing loudly. This so terrified the  Skrellings, that they sped out to their canoes, and then rowed away to  the southward along the coast. For three entire weeks nothing more was  seen of them. At the end of this time, however, a great multitude of  Skrelling boats was discovered approaching from the south, as if a stream  were pouring down, and all of their staves were waved in a direction  contrary to the course of the sun, and the Skrellings were all uttering  loud cries. Thereupon Karlsefni and his men took red shields and  displayed them. The Skrellings sprang from their boats, and they met  then, and fought together. There was a fierce shower of missiles, for the  Skrellings had war-slings. Karlsefni and Snorri observed, that the  Skrellings raised up on a pole a great ball-shaped body, almost the size  of a sheep's belly, and nearly black in color, and this they hurled from  the pole up on the land above Karlsefni's followers, and it made a  frightful noise, where it fell. Whereat a great fear seized upon  Karlsefni, and all his men, so that they could think of nought but  flight, and of making their escape up along the river bank, for it seemed  to them, that the troop of the Skrellings was rushing towards them from  every side, and they did not pause, until they came to certain jutting  crags, where they offered a stout resistance. Freydis came out, and  seeing that Karlsefni and his men were fleeing, she cried: \"Why do ye  flee from these wretches, such worthy men as ye, when, meseems, ye might  slaughter them like cattle. Had I but a weapon, methinks, I would fight  better than any one of you!\" They gave no heed to her words. Freydis  sought to join them, but lagged behind, for she was not hale;[38-1] she  followed them, however, into the forest, while the Skrellings pursued  her; she found a dead man in front of her; this was Thorbrand, Snorri's  son, his skull cleft by a flat stone; his naked sword lay beside him; she  took it up, and prepared to defend herself with it. The Skrellings then  approached her, whereupon she stripped down her shift, and slapped her  breast with the naked sword. At this the Skrellings were terrified and  ran down to their boats, and rowed away. Karlsefni and his companions,  however, joined her and praised her valor. Two of Karlsefni's men had  fallen, and a great number of the Skrellings. Karlsefni's party had been  overpowered by dint of superior numbers. They now returned to their  dwellings, and bound up their wounds, and weighed carefully what throng  of men that could have been, which had seemed to descend upon them from  the land; it now seemed to them, that there could have been but the one  party, that which came from the boats, and that the other troop must have  been an ocular delusion. The Skrellings, moreover, found a dead man, and  an axe lay beside him. One of their number picked up the axe, and struck  at a tree with it, and one after another [they tested it], and it seemed  to them to be a treasure, and to cut well; then one of their number  seized it, and hewed at a stone with it, so that the axe broke, whereat  they concluded that it could be of no use, since it would not withstand  stone, and they cast it away.    It now seemed clear to Karlsefni and his people, that although the  country thereabouts was attractive, their life would be one of constant  dread and turmoil by reason of the [hostility of the] inhabitants of the  country, so they forthwith prepared to leave, and determined to return to  their own country. They sailed to the northward off the coast, and found  five Skrellings, clad in skin-doublets, lying asleep near the sea. There  were vessels beside them, containing animal marrow, mixed with blood.  Karlsefni and his company concluded that they must have been banished  from their own land. They put them to death. They afterwards found a  cape, upon which there was a great number of animals, and this cape  looked as if it were one cake of dung, by reason of the animals which lay  there at night. They now arrived again at Streamfirth, where they found  great abundance of all those things of which they stood in need. Some men  say, that Biarni and Freydis remained behind here with a hundred men, and  went no further; while Karlsefni and Snorri proceeded to the southward  with forty men, tarrying at Hop barely two months, and returning again  the same summer. Karlsefni then set out with one ship, in search of  Thorhall the Huntsman, but the greater part of the company remained  behind. They sailed to the northward around Keelness, and then bore to  the westward, having land to the larboard.[40-1] The country there was a  wooded wilderness, as far as they could see, with scarcely an open space;  and when they had journeyed a considerable distance, a river flowed down  from the east toward the west. They sailed into the mouth of the river,  and lay to by the southern bank.    _The Slaying of Thorvald, Eric's son._--It happened one morning, that  Karlsefni and his companions discovered in an open space in the woods  above them, a speck, which seemed to shine toward them, and they shouted  at it: it stirred, and it was a Uniped,[40-2] who skipped down to the  bank of the river by which they were lying. Thorvald, a son of Eric the  Red, was sitting at the helm, and the Uniped shot an arrow into his  inwards. Thorvald drew out the arrow, and exclaimed: \"There is fat around  my paunch; we have hit upon a fruitful country, and yet we are not like  to get much profit of it.\" Thorvald died soon after from this wound. Then  the Uniped ran away back toward the north. Karlsefni and his men pursued  him, and saw him from time to time. The last they saw of him, he ran down  into a creek. Then they turned back; whereupon one of the men recited  this ditty:[40-3]        Eager, our men, up hill down dell,        Hunted a Uniped;      Hearken, Karlsefni, while they tell        How swift the quarry fled!    Then they sailed away back toward the north, and believed they had got  sight of the land of the Unipeds; nor were they disposed to risk the  lives of their men any longer.

My mother will be charmed to receive  you, and I--aw--will strive to make you happy.\"    \"I appreciate your devotion, I do, indeed, Mr. de Brabazon,\" said  Florence, earnestly; \"but I must decline your offer. I will not marry  without love.\"    \"I don't mind that,\" said Percy, \"if you'll agree to take a feller;  you'll learn in time to like him a little. I am wich--I know you don't  care for that--but I can give you as good a home as your uncle. If you  would give me hope--aw----\"    \"I am afraid I cannot, Mr. de Brabazon, but if you will allow me to  look upon you as a friend, I will call upon you if I have need of a  friend's services.\"    \"Will you, weally?\"    \"Yes, there is my hand on it. I ought to tell you that I must now earn  my own living, and am to give lessons to a young pupil in West ----  Street, three hours daily.\"    \"You don't mean to say you are actually poor?\" said Mr. de Brabazon,  horrified.    \"Yes, indeed, I am.\"    \"Then, won't you let me lend you some money? I've got more than I  need, I have, 'pon my honor.\"    \"Thank you, I promise to call upon you if I need it.\"    Mr. de Brabazon looked pleased.    \"Would you mind telling me where you are going to teach, Miss  Florence?\"    Florence hesitated, but there was something so sincere and friendly in  the young man's manner--dude though he was--that she consented to  grant his request.    \"I am to teach the daughter of Mr. Robert Leighton.\"    \"Why, Miss Leighton is my cousin,\" said Percy, in joyous excitement.    \"Indeed! Had I known that I would hardly have told you.\"    \"Don't be afwaid! I will be vewy discreet,\" said Mr. de Brabazon.    \"Thank you, and good-morning.\"    Florence went on her way, cheered and encouraged in spite of herself,  by her success in obtaining employment, and by the friendly offers of  Mr. de Brabazon.    \"It is wrong to get discouraged,\" she said to herself. \"After all,  there are warm hearts in the world.\"    When she entered her humble home, she found Dodger already there.  There was an eagerness in his manner, and a light in his eye, that  seemed to indicate good news.    \"Well, Dodger, what is it?\"    \"I've been waitin' half an hour to see you, Florence,\" he said. \"I've  got some work for you.\"    \"What is it--sewing on a button, or mending a coat?\"    \"No, I mean workin' for money. You can play on the pianner, can't  you?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"They want a young lady to play the pianner at a dime museum, for nine  dollars a week. It's a bully chance. I just told the manager--he's a  friend of mine--that I had a young lady friend that was a stunnin'  player, and he wants you to come around and see him.\"    It was a preposterous idea--so Florence thought--that she should  consent to play at such a place; but she couldn't expect Dodger to  look at the matter in the same light, so she answered, very gently and  pleasantly:    \"You are very kind, Dodger, to look out for me, but I shall not need  to accept your friend's offer. I have secured a chance to teach  uptown.\"    \"You have? What'll you get?\"    \"I am to be employed three hours daily, at fifty cents an hour.\"    \"Geewhillikens! that's good! You'd have to work as much as twelve  hours at the museum for the same pay.\"    \"You see, therefore, that I am provided for--that is, if I suit.\"    Dodger was a little disappointed. Still, he could not help admitting  that it would be better for Florence to teach three hours, than to  work ten or twelve. As to her having any objection to appearing at a  dime museum, that never occurred to him.    Florence had sent for her trunk, and it was now in her room.    Dodger accompanied an expressman to the house, and luckily saw Jane,  who arranged everything for him.    \"How's the old gentleman?\" asked Dodger. \"Florence wanted me to ask.\"    \"He's feeble,\" said Jane, shaking her head.    \"Does he miss Florence?\"    \"That he do.\"    \"Why don't he send for her, then, to come back?\" asked Dodger,  bluntly.    \"Because Curtis Waring makes him believe she'll come around and ask  forgiveness, if he only holds out. I tell you, Dodger, that Curtis is  a viper.\"    \"So he is,\" answered Dodger, who was not quite clear in his mind as to  what a viper was. \"I'd like to step on his necktie.\"    \"If it wasn't for him, my dear young mistress would be back in the  house within twenty-four hours.\"    \"I don't see how the old gentleman can let him turn Florence out of  the house.\"    \"He's a snake in the grass, Dodger. It may be wicked, but I just wish  something would happen to him. And how is Miss Florence lookin', poor  dear?\"    \"She's lookin' like a daisy.\"    \"Does she worry much?\"    \"She did at first, but now she's workin' every day, and she looks more  cheerful-like.\"    \"Miss Florence workin'! She that was always brought up like a lady!\"    \"She's teachin' a little girl three hours a day.\"    \"Well, that isn't so bad!\" said Jane, relieved. \"Teachin' is genteel.  I wish I could see her some day. Will you tell her, Dodger, that next  Sunday is my day out, and I'll be in Central Park up by the menagerie  at three o'clock, if she'll only take the trouble to be up there?\"    \"I'll tell her, Jane, and I'm sure she'll be there.\"    A day or two afterward Curtis Waring asked: \"Have you heard from my  Cousin Florence since she went away?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Indeed! Where is she staying?\"    \"She didn't send me word.\"    \"How, then, did you hear from her?\"    \"Dodger came with an expressman for her trunk.\"    Curtis Waring frowned.    \"And you let him have it?\" he demanded, sternly.    \"Of course I did. Why shouldn't I?\"    \"You should have asked me.\"    \"And what business have you with Miss Florence's trunk, I'd like to  know?\" said Jane, independently.    \"Never mind; you ought to have asked my permission.\"    \"I didn't think you'd want to wear any of Miss Florence's things, Mr.  Waring.\"    \"You are silly and impertinent,\" said Curtis, biting his lips. \"Did  that boy tell you anything about her?\"    \"Only that she wasn't worryin' any for you, Mr. Curtis.\"    Curtis glanced angrily at his cousin's devoted friend, and then,  turning on his heel, left the room.    \"I'll bring her to terms yet,\" he muttered. \"No girl of seventeen  shall defy me!\"          Chapter XIII.  Tim Bolton's Saloon.      Not far from Houston Street, on the west side of the Bowery, is an  underground saloon, with whose proprietor we are already acquainted.    It was kept by Tim Bolton, whose peculiar tastes and shady  characteristics well fitted him for such a business.    It was early evening, and the gas jets lighted up a characteristic  scene.    On the sanded floor were set several tables, around which were seated  a motley company, all of them with glasses of beer or whiskey before  them.    Tim, with a white apron on, was moving about behind the bar,  ministering to the wants of his patrons. There was a scowl upon his  face, for he was not fond of work, and he missed Dodger's assistance.    The boy understood the business of mixing drinks as well as he, and  often officiated for hours at a time, thus giving his guardian and  reputed father a chance to leave the place and meet outside  engagements.    A tall, erect gentleman entered the saloon, and walked up to the bar.    \"Good-evening, colonel,\" said Tim.    \"Good-evening, sir,\" said the newcomer, with a stately inclination of  the head.    He was really a colonel, having served in the Civil War at the head of  a Georgia regiment.    He had all the stately courtesy of a Southern gentleman, though not  above the weakness of a frequent indulgence in the strongest fluids  dispensed by Tim Bolton.    \"What'll you have, colonel?\"    \"Whiskey straight, sir. It's the only drink fit for a gentleman. Will  you join me, Mr. Bolton?\"    \"Of course, I will,\" said Tim, as, pouring out a glass for himself, he  handed the bottle to the colonel.    \"Your health, sir,\" said the colonel, bowing.    \"Same to you, colonel,\" responded Tim, with a nod.    \"Where's the boy?\"    Col. Martin had always taken considerable notice of Dodger, being  naturally fond of boys, and having once had a son of his own, who was  killed in a railroad accident when about Dodger's age.    \"Danged if I know!\" answered Tim, crossly.    \"He hasn't left you, has he?\"    \"Yes; he's cleared out, the ungrateful young imp! I'd like to lay my  hands on the young rascal.\"    \"Was he your son?\"    \"He was my--stepson,\" answered Tim, hesitating.    \"I see, you married his mother.\"    \"Yes,\" said Tim, considering the explanation satisfactory, and  resolved to adopt it. \"I've always treated him as if he was my own  flesh and blood, and I've raised him from a young kid. Now he's gone  and left me.\"    \"Can you think of any reason for his leaving you?\"    \"Not one. I always treated him well. He's been a great expense to me,  and now he's got old enough to help me he must clear out. He's the  most ungrateful cub I ever seen.\"    \"I am sorry he has gone--I used to like to have him serve me.\"    \"And now what's the consequence? Here I am tied down to the bar day  and night.\"    \"Can't you get some one in his place?\"    \"Yes, but I'd likely be robbed; I had a bartender once who robbed me  of two or three dollars a day.\"    \"But you trusted the boy?\"    \"Yes, Dodger wouldn't steal--I can say that much for him.\"    \"There's one thing I noticed about the boy,\" said the colonel,  reflectively. \"He wouldn't drink. More than once I have asked him to  drink with me, but he would always say, 'Thank you, colonel, but I  don't like whiskey.' I never asked him to take anything else, for  whiskey's the only drink fit for a gentleman. Do you expect to get the  boy back?\"    \"If I could only get out for a day I'd hunt him up; but I'm tied down  here.\"    \"I seed him yesterday, Tim,\" said a red-nosed man who had just entered  the saloon, in company with a friend of the same general appearance.  Both wore silk hats, dented and soiled with "]]]
