[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15718"],[0,"How To Write Special Feature Articles (#10)"],[1,"an exciting tale of  adventure. The thrilling exploits in real life of the engineer, the  explorer, the soldier of fortune, the pioneer in any field, hold us  spellbound. Even more commonplace experiences are not without an element  of the adventurous, for life itself is a great adventure. Many special  feature stories in narrative form have much the same interest that is  created by the fictitious tale of adventure.    CONTESTS FOR SUPREMACY. Man has never lost his primitive love of a good  fight. Civilization may change the form of the contest, but fighting to  win, whether in love or politics, business or sport, still has a strong  hold on all of us. Strikes, attempted monopolies, political revolutions,  elections, championship games, diplomacy, poverty, are but a few of the  struggles that give zest to life. To portray dramatically in a special  article the clash and conflict in everyday affairs is to make a  well-nigh universal appeal.    CHILDREN. Because we live in and for our children, everything that  concerns them comes close to our hearts. A child in a photo-drama or in  a news story is sure to win sympathy and admiration. The special feature  writer cannot afford to neglect so vital a source of interest. Practical  articles on the care and the education of children also have especial  value for women readers.    ANIMALS. Wild or tame, at large or in captivity, animals attract us  either for their almost human intelligence or for their distinctively  animal traits. There are few persons who do not like horses, dogs, cats,  and other pets, and fewer still who can pass by the animal cages at the  circus or the \"zoo.\" Hunting, trapping, and fishing are vocations for  some men, and sport for many more. The business of breeding horses and  cattle, and the care of live stock and poultry on the farm, must not be  overlooked in the search for subjects. The technical aspects of these  topics will interest readers of farm journals; the more popular phases  of them make a wide general appeal.    HOBBIES AND AMUSEMENTS. Pastimes and avocations may be counted good  subjects. Moving pictures, theaters, music, baseball, golf, automobiles,  amateur photography, and a host of hobbies and recreations have enough  enthusiastic devotees to insure wide reading for special feature stories  about them.    THE FAMILIAR. Persons whom we know, places that we constantly see,  experiences that we have had again and again, often seem commonplace  enough, even when familiarity has not bred contempt; but when they  appear unexpectedly on the stage or in print, we greet them with the  cordiality bestowed on the proverbial long-lost friend. Local news  interests readers because it concerns people and places immediately  around them. Every newspaper man understands the desirability of  increasing the attractiveness of a news event that happens elsewhere by  rinding \"local ends,\" or by giving it \"a local turn.\" For special  feature stories in newspapers, local phases are no less important. But  whether the article is to be published in a newspaper or a magazine,  familiar persons and things should be \"played up\" prominently.    THE PROMINENT. Many persons, places, and objects that we have never seen  are frequently as real to us as are those that we see daily. This is  because their names and their pictures have greeted us again and again  in print. It is thus that prominent men and women become familiar to us.  Because of their importance we like to read about them. If a special  feature article in any of its phases concerns what is prominent, greater  attractiveness can be given to it by \"playing up\" this point, be it the  President of the United States or a well-known circus clown, Fifth  Avenue or the Bowery, the Capitol at Washington or Coney Island, the  Twentieth Century Limited or a Ford.    LIFE AND WELFARE OF OTHERS. Sympathy with our fellow beings and an  instinctive recognition of our common humanity are inherent in most men  and women. Nowhere is this more strikingly shown than in the quick and  generous response that comes in answer to every call for aid for those  in distress. So, too, we like to know how others feel and think. We like  to get behind the veil with which every one attempts to conceal his  innermost thoughts and feelings. Our interest in the lives and the  welfare of others finds expression in various ways, ranging from social  service and self-sacrificing devotion to gossip and secret confidences.  These extremes and all that lies between them abound in that \"human  interest\" upon which all editors insist.    This widespread interest in others affords to the writer of special  articles one of his greatest opportunities, not only for preparing  interesting stories, but for arousing readers to support many a good  cause. To create sympathy for the unfortunate, to encourage active  social service, to point the way to political reform, to show the  advantages of better industrial conditions, to explain better business  methods--all these are but a few of the helpful, constructive appeals  that he may make effectively.    He may create this interest and stir his readers to action by either one  of two methods: by exposing existing evils, or by showing what has been  done to improve bad conditions. The exposure of evils in politics,  business, and society constituted the \"muck-raking\" to which several of  the popular monthly magazines owe their rise. This crusading,  \"searchlight\" type of journalism has been largely superseded by the  constructive, \"sunlight\" type. To explain how reforms have been  accomplished, or are being brought about, is construed by the best of  the present-day journals to be their special mission.    PERSONAL SUCCESS AND HAPPINESS. Every one is vitally concerned about his  own prosperity and happiness. To make a success of life, no matter by  what criterion we may measure that success, is our one all-powerful  motive. Happiness, as the goal that we hope to reach by our success, and  health, as a prime requisite for its attainment, are also of great  importance to every one of us. How to make or save more money, how to do  our work more easily, how to maintain our physical well-being, how to  improve ourselves mentally and morally, how to enjoy life more  fully--that is what we all want to know. To the writer who will show us  how to be \"healthy, wealthy, and wise,\" we will give our undivided  attention.    Business and professional interests naturally occupy the larger part of  men's thoughts, while home-making is the chief work of most women.  Although women are entering many fields hitherto monopolized by men, the  home remains woman's peculiar sphere. The purchase and preparation of  food, the buying and making of clothing, the management of servants, the  care of children--these are the vital concerns of most women. They  realize, however, that conditions outside the home have a direct bearing  on home-making; and each year they are taking a more active part in  civic affairs. Matters of public health, pure food legislation, the milk  and the water supply, the garbage collection, the character of places of  amusement, the public schools, determine, in no small degree, the  success and happiness of the home-maker.    Since the dominant interests of men and women alike are their business  and their home, the special writer should undertake to connect his  subject as closely as possible with these interests. To show, for  example, how the tariff, taxes, public utility rates, price-fixing,  legislation, and similar matters affect the business and home affairs of  the average reader, is to give to these political and economic problems  an interest for both men and women far in excess of that resulting from  a more general treatment of them. The surest way to get the reader's  attention is to bring the subject home to him personally.    Of the importance of presenting a subject in such a manner that the  reader is led to see its application to himself and his own affairs, Mr.  John M. Siddall, editor of the _American Magazine_, has said:        Every human being likes to see himself in reading matter--just as he      likes to see himself in a mirror.        The reason so much reading matter is unpopular and never attracts a      wide reading public lies in the fact that the reader sees nothing in      it for himself. Take an article, we'll say, entitled \"The Financial      System of Canada.\" It looks dull, doesn't it? It looks dull because      you can't quite see where it affects you. Now take an article      entitled \"Why it is easier to get rich in Canada than in the United      States.\" That's different! Your interest is aroused. You wonder      wherein the Canadian has an advantage over you. You look into the      article to find out whether you can't get an idea from it. Yet the      two articles may be basically alike, differing only in treatment.      One bores you and the other interests you. One bores you because it      seems remote. The other interests you because the writer has had the      skill to translate his facts and ideas into terms that are personal      to you. The minute you become personal in this world you become      interesting.    COMBINING APPEALS. When the analysis of a topic shows that it possesses  more than one of these appeals, the writer may heighten the  attractiveness of his story by developing several of the possibilities,  simultaneously or successively. The chance discovery by a prominent  physician of a simple preventive of infantile paralysis, for instance,  would combine at least four of the elements of interest enumerated  above. If such a combination of appeals can be made at the very  beginning of the article, it is sure to command attention.    DEFINITENESS OF PURPOSE. In view of the multiplicity of possible  appeals, a writer may be misled into undertaking to do too many diverse  things in a single article.

She  wore the black yashmak and _tarhah_; upon her arms were many brass  bracelets which tinkled; on one hand she wore a ring and there were  flesh-coloured silken hose and sandals upon her feet.  She had made a  mistake and henna'd her finger-tips, which members of the humblest  class have not time to do--besides, their patient hands matter so  little--and her great eyes looked as black as the yashmak over which  they shone.    Her beautiful face was hidden, yet was she infinitely alluring,  tantilising, mysterious, under her veils.    Heavens! if only women knew how easy it is to enhance the looks by the  simple method of touching up the eyes with _kohl_ and covering the rest  of the face!    \"All of us in veils and masks will have to take them off at one.\"    \"Yes, there'll be the rub,\" said Damaris, as she knelt down beside the  perplexed, growling bulldog.    \"Don't know Missie?  Don't love her?\"    \"Woomph!\" replied Wellington, hurling his great weight into her lap.    \"How he loves you, Maris!\"    \"Yes, miss, he does,\" broke in Jane Coop.  \"And I firmly believe he's  my mistress's guardian angel.\"    \"After you, Janie dear,\" said the girl, smiling fondly up at the plump  maid and tying a huge crimson bow round the neck of the long-suffering  animal.    \"What is he going as, Maris?\"    \"A gargle, miss,\" broke in the maid.  \"I think it's just fun on the  part of Miss Damaris, because nothing as solid as him,\"--pointing of  comb to shamed dog--\"could go as anything watery.\"    Damaris got to her feet.    \"Let's go in to _Marraine_,\" she choked.  \"Gargoyle, my dear,\" she  whispered, \"is what she meant--gargoyle.  Do come along!\"    The girls' happy laughter rang down the corridor as they knocked at her  grace's door.    She stood at her dressing-table in a beautiful dress of grey brocade.  Diamonds sparkled in the laces of her corsage, on her fingers and in  the buckles of her lovely shoes; a big bunch of pink carnations was  tied on the top of her ebony stick; a priceless lace veil fastened over  her head by a fragile wreath of diamond leaves fell almost to the hem  of her dress behind.  She had discarded the terrifying perruque, and  her own hair, snowy-white, was puffed and curled about the little face,  which was finely powdered and slightly rouged.  She was a dream of  beautiful old age, with Dekko just visible under a huge pink bow upon  her shoulder.    \"May I present a very old woman to youth?\" she said simply.    \"Darling,\" cried Damaris as she ran forward and, pushing the yashmak to  one side, kissed the jewelled hand.  \"You are too beautiful--too  beautiful!  Promise me never, never, never to wear it again.\"    \"I'm too old to get rid of bad habits, cherie,\" said her godmother.  \"And we had better go down.  By the way, what is Ben coming as?\"    \"I really don't know,\" came the muffled reply from behind the yashmak,  \"if he comes at all.\"    As Cairo entire had accepted the invitation, the place was packed, but  nowhere was the crowd so suffocating as round the entrance to the  Winter Garden.    \"Per-fect-ly wonderful,\" gasped a rotund Ouled Nail to a masked dancer  of the same sex and size.  \"He told me about that terrible time when I  lost so much at bridge--you remember, dear, when I had to--er--to raise  money on my diamonds.  How could he have seen it in my hand?\"    He hadn't; he had been a guest at Hurdley Castle with her.    \"What's he like?\"    \"Oh, I couldn't see his face, on account of the handkerchief thing, but  I think he's quite common; his clothes are quite poor.  I believe he is  one of the waiters dressed up.  I seem to recognise his voice.  Have  you long to wait?\"    \"I'm twenty-fifth down the list.  Who's in now?\"    \"Some woman in black.  There are four of them, and I can't tell t'other  from which.\"    The hand of the woman who was twenty-fifth down the list was never told.    Damaris lifted the curtain, and walked into the corner of the Winter  Garden, which had been temporarily given the appearance of an Arab's  tent.    \"_Salaam aley_,\" she said gently, giving the word of peace.    The fortune-teller salaamed with hands to forehead, mouth and heart, in  the beautiful Eastern gesture.    \"_Aleykoum es-Salaam_!\" he replied as gently, which is the sacrament of  lips.    There was the fortune-teller's regulation small table, with a chart of  the stars and a silver tray covered in sand upon it; on either side was  a chair; but it was upon a cushion on the floor that Damaris seated  herself, with her back against the canvas drapery of the wall,  motioning the Arab to a cushion near her, whilst her eyes swept the  loose cotton tunic, the _kaleelyah_ or head-kerchief, which almost  completely hid the face, the great white mantle and the sandals upon  the naked feet.    Oh! the game of make-believe they played, those two with the  jewel-hilted, razor-edged dagger of love between them.    There fell a silence.    And then the fortune-teller spoke in his own tongue, and too absorbed  were they in the game of make-believe to notice that he made use of  neither sand nor stars nor the lines upon her hands, which were clasped  above her heart, as he read her future in her eyes.    \"Two paths lie before thee, O woman, and both stretch, through the  kingdom of love.    \"The one to thy right hand has been marked out upon the Field of  Content by feet bound in the sandals of custom and convention.  There  is shade upon this path, for, behold, the scorching sun of passion may  not penetrate the leaves of the trees of tranquillity; the storm breaks  not, neither do the biting winds of fear, nor the drenching torrents of  desire, encompass those who walk thereon.    \"The river, the slow, full-blossomed river of patience, flows ever  beside it, on its way to the Ocean of Life in which all waters must  mingle in eternity.\"    There fell a silence, broken by the swaying, throbbing music from the  distant ball-room, causing the girl suddenly to stretch out her hands,  upon which shone the ring, and the man to stretch out his, though he  touched not hers at all.    \"And to the left?\"    \"To the left, O woman whose eyes are like unto the pools of Lebanon at  night, to thy left, lies the desert.  The desert, where the feet are  blistered by the gritting sands of passion and the eyes are blinded in  desire.  The vast plain where knowledge walks hand-in-hand with death;  where the footprints of horror, fear, starvation, thirst, which are but  the footprints of jealousy and love desired and fulfilled, mark the  sands for one little second and then are gone; the desert, where there  is no shade, no cool waters, no content, no peace until the wanderer  lies still, with sightless eyes turned towards Eternity.\"    \"And if a woman's feet trod upon it?\"    \"Then will she cut her feet upon the stones of pain; then will the  scorpion of bitter experience sting her heel; then will she die with a  smile upon her red mouth, for love will have come to her, maybe for a  day, maybe for a second of time, but a love which will mingle her soul  with the soul of her desert lover, or shatter her body, even as is  broken the alabaster vase of sweet perfume.  Yet is it the _love of the  soul_ that endureth forever, yea, even if the body of the woman passeth  unto another's keeping.\"    The girl pulled her veil closely about her head and sat quite still,  her wonderful eyes hidden by the fringe of black lashes.    And yet did she not move when he sprang to his feet, intoxicated with  the mystery of her, afire with that love which is the heritage of the  desert.    Then he bent and caught her by the wrists and raised her to her feet.    \"Take the path at thy right hand, woman; set not a foot upon the desert  sand, lest perchance a bird of prey swoop down upon thee, thou white  dove.\"    He pulled her hands up, holding them cruelly, as in a steel vise, so  that he had but to bend a finger's breadth to kiss them.    \"Thy feet hesitate, woman.  Why?  What searchest thou?\"    \"Knowledge.\"    The man unconsciously laced his fingers in hers, crushing them until  she went white to the lips.    \"Knowledge is pain, woman.  What know'st thou of pain?  Great pain.  How could'st thou endure it?\"    Then he let her hands go and touched the silver tray of sand upon the  table beside him.    \"Behold!  Love shall be offered thee within the passing of a few hours,  the love of thy right hand, and thou shalt reject it.  Searching for  that which thou desirest thou shalt, surrounded by thy women who love  thee, pass down the river even unto Thebes of the Hundred Gates.  Yet  shalt thou not find it in the river, nor in the temples upon the east  bank of the waters, nor upon the west bank.\"    Drawing a square in the sand, the fortune-teller made a cross at the  south-east, upon which, to see it better, the girl drew close--so close  that the sweet perfume of her veils filled his nostrils.    \"Then shalt thou, in thy search, go, even under the stars, to the Gate  of Tomorrow, and there shall thou find a mare descended from the mares  of Mohammed, the Prophet of Allah the one and only God.  White is the  mare, and beautiful, yea, even is she like unto thee, thou woman of  ivory; her bit is of silver, her bridle of plaited gold, her  saddle-cloth encrusted with jewels.  Thou wilt spring upon her, and  she, knowing her way, will bring thee to the Tents of Purple and Gold.\"    \"Ah!\" whispered the girl.  \"The Tents of the long-dead Queen!  They are  the talk of Cairo, but nobody--at least, no foreigner--has seen them.\"    \"No man but the servants, no woman but the mother of him who is the  master, has even set foot within the Tents of Purple and of Gold; no  one but the master has set foot in the tent which stands between them,  the Tent of Death.\"    \"And in them--if I come, what--what should I find?\"    \"No harm shall befall thee, no smirching of thy fair name.  The master  alone shall greet thee, and when thou hast found that for"]]]
