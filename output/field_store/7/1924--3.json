I am afraid that by this time I had let my little angry passions  rise--in other words, I was decidedly angry.    \"I got on splendidly this time, and was quite ready to start with my  cousins when the time came, although my Lady Alice evinced serious  objections to the gate, and preferred ambling gently along sideways up  the hill.  After a while I intimated kindly with my whip a desire to  gallop.  I fear that, like some of our friends, she is hard to take a  hint, for she progressed by the most wonderful plunges, garnished with  little kicks; but I kept her head well up, and clawed out several  handfuls of her mane.  When we came to the rendezvous, my cavalier  proposed running her for two or three miles to take down her spirits a  little, after which she went beautifully, and I never enjoyed a ride so  much before.    \"We rode to Lake Wampus, and everything looked so lovely, for the full  moon lighted it up like a mirror, and we had singing and thrilling  ghost stories.    \"Dear me, how awfully long this letter is!  Be sure you answer it soon.    \"Yours lovingly,    \"GABRIELLE.\"      _June 19_.    The heat and dust are becoming insufferable, for we have had no rain,  save in very homoeopathic doses, during the three weeks that we have  been here.  The shrubs and bushes by the roadside look so piteous under  their weight of dust, that I feel half inclined to try the effect of a  feather brush upon their drooping leaves; and Bernard, who is never  prone to take cheerful views of anything, grows daily more gloomy when  we inquire after the progress of the kitchen-garden.  But, although we  are sighing under the heat, it is nothing, we are told, to what the New  Yorkers are now enduring, and our friends, Mrs. Acheson and Dr. Taylor,  who came out yesterday from the city to spend the day with us,  congratulated us upon the coolness of the temperature at Chappaqua.    The morning was passed out of doors playing croquet and walking      \"Sotto i pini del boschetto,\"    to use the words of the coquettish Countess and her arch waiting-maid  in the \"Marriage of Figaro\" (that Letter Duo contains, I think, some of  the most delicious music that the joyous Mozart ever wrote).    The sun was too hot after our early dinner, for us to find much  pleasure in croquet; so we sat in the music-room, and upon the piazza,  and listened to a few songs from Marguerite, and watched the skill of  papa and the handsome blond doctor in the \"Magic Rings,\"--a very easy  game, to all appearance, but one which really requires much dexterity  of hand.    The music-room is, I think, the coolest and pleasantest room in the  house.  It is one of the additions built by uncle after he had  purchased this house--a large, square room on the ground floor, with  curtained windows opening upon the balcony, and upon the old  apple-tree.  It is singularly favorable for music, for it contains no  heavy furniture, and the floor is uncarpeted.  We had intended to  remove all the pictures from the walls, that they might not deaden the  sound of the music, but we could not resist an exquisite \"Mary in the  Desert,\" purchased by uncle in Florence, in 1851; so this painting is  now hung over the piano.    Our sprightly brunette friend with the merry black eyes, Mrs. Acheson,  looked unusually pretty and charming yesterday.  I love to describe  stylish toilettes as well as any fashion-writer; so here is hers in all  its details: steel-colored silk trimmed with turquoise blue,  demi-traine, her hair beautifully dressed (or _coiffured_, to use the  fashionable newspaper word) in puffs and rolls, and finished with a  little blue feather; while an elegant fan attached to half a yard of  gold chain depended from her belt.    When the 4.45 train was at hand, Ida and I walked down to the station  with our friends.  Quite luckily there was a drawing-room car attached  to the train, although such luxury is generally confined to the  express, which does not stop here.  I learnt, however, from the  station-master, that this car had borne some happy pair as far as  Albany the day before, had stayed there over-night for repairs, and was  now returning in a leisurely manner to New York.          CHAPTER VII.    Midsummer Day--An Artist's Visit--Ida's Letter--Moonlight on Croton  Lake--Morning Readings--Plato and Kohlrausch.      _June 21_.    In honor of Midsummer Day, Marguerite and I have spent the morning at  the piano, playing Mendelssohn's delicious fairy music from the  Midsummer Night's Dream.    We have had little time to practise or read this week, for company has  been of almost daily occurrence; Marguerite returned yesterday morning  from a flying visit to the city, accompanied by our friends, Colonel  Rogers and Mr. Hows, the artist, who is a neighbor of ours in our rural  part of the city--Cottage Place.  Colonel Rogers was dressed entirely  in gray, a costume that looked delightfully cool, and was a perfect  match for his eyes.    The morning was spent in playing croquet, and in showing our guests  over the place, whose wild beauty delighted Mr. Hows' artistic eyes.  We walked first to the flower-garden, where we gathered flowers to  dress the table for dinner, and then visited the pine grove, the  romantic dell, and the stone barn of which uncle was always so proud,  where we spent an hour amid the sweet hay.    For the evening a drive was proposed, as we have now quite recovered  from our former dread of malaria.  Ida held the ribbons on this  occasion, and as I was not one of the party, I will insert her graceful  description of the pleasant evening.      \"CHAPPAQUA.    \"DEAR JULIA: I was so sorry to get your letter saying you could not  come.  I wish you had not let your tiresome old dressmaker deprive me  of the pleasure of your company on our expedition to Croton Lake.    \"I must tell you all about the delightful time we had.  Two of the  numerous friends of our blue-eyed Marguerite, Colonel Rogers and Mr.  Hows, whose exquisite pictures you and I have so often enjoyed  together, were our cavaliers on this occasion.  As our light carriage  only has room for four, I drove the ponies myself.  We started just  about sundown, and the pleasant coolness of evening came on while there  was still daylight enough to light up the constantly changing panorama  of hill and dale, and forest and distant river, beyond which the blue  mountain range dimly seen, now seemed to emerge into bolder relief, and  again to fade back into cloud-land.    \"Mr. Hows' delight in the scenery was certainly equalled by mine in  listening to its praises.  I am very fond of this part of Westchester,  and when people talk of the beauties of the Adirondacks, I listen with  the silent conviction that we have everything here but the musquitoes  and the bad cooking, with both of which I cheerfully dispense.    \"But to return to our drive.  The last mile the road ran through a dark  forest, following the course of a stream called Roaring Brook, which  generally makes good its title to the name, but now, owing to the  recent drouth, was reduced to roaring as gently as Bottom's Lion  promised to do.  At last the lake was reached, and turning to the  right, we were soon skimming along at a great pace on the wide  boulevard that skirts the water as far along as Pine's Bridge.  There  we put up our ponies at a hotel with an impossible and unpronounceable  Indian name, and accepted the Colonel's kind invitation for a row.  We  all regretted there was no moon, with as much self-reproach as if it  had been accidentally left behind, but were glad enough to get into our  little white boat, that looked quite silvery against the dark current.    \"The gentlemen, who had been dying to hear Marguerite sing ever since  coming out here, now suggested that her voice was all that was needed  to make the hour perfect; so Marguerite, who is as sweet and unaffected  about her singing as if she hadn't the most exquisite soprano ever  heard off the stage, consented without any tiresome urging, and asked  what it should be.  We were evenly divided between 'Robin Adair' and  Mario's 'Good-bye, Sweetheart,' so our pretty songstress kindly gave us  both.    \"I cannot recall the delicious effect of her singing as we were  drifting along in the sombre twilight, better than by quoting Buchanan  Read's charming lines, which I dare say you have seen before:      \"'I heed not if    My rippling skiff    Float swift or slow from cliff to cliff;    With dreamful eyes    My spirit lies    Under the walls of Paradise.      \"'Under the walls    Where swells and falls    The bay's deep breast at intervals;    At peace I lie,    Blown softly by    A cloud upon this liquid sky.      \"'No more, no more    The worldly shore    Upbraids me with its load uproar:    With dreamful eyes    My spirit lies    Under the walls of Paradise.'        \"I. L. G.\"      _June 24_.    The week commenced with a dash of rain, but this morning it was again  as hot as though no clouds had darkened the sky.  Croquet was out of  the question, and not even for the sake of trying my new beaver and  stylish habit, so becoming to a slight figure, could I confront the  dust and the sun's blazing rays upon Nancy's back (for such is the  unromantic name of the horse that oftenest has the honor of bearing me  when we ride).  No one seemed inclined to drive, so Lady Alice and the  Duchess, that had been for some time impatiently stamping, and arching  their pretty necks, evidently impatient to be off, were sent back to  the stables, much amazed, I doubt not, at our capricious conduct; while  we--mamma, Marguerite, and I--sauntered up to the cool pine grove,  accompanied by Arthur, bearing a camp-chair for mamma, and a couple of  wise-looking tomes, in whose society we were to spend the morning.    But I have not yet introduced Arthur.  He is neither brother, cousin,  nor"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18298"],[0,"Essays in Natural History and Agriculture (#10)"],[1,"  the Salmon are so numerous? The Salmon in the Columbia river, on  the north-west coast of America, are cast dead upon the shores by  myriads after the spawning season, and these are merely the fish  dying from exhaustion, as a small portion always do here. How  numerous, then, are those which ascend the river to spawn, and go  down again to the sea afterwards! No doubt the grand object to be  attained is to make Salmon abundant, and the most important step  towards the attainment of this object will be to give an efficient  protection to the spawning fish, and the only way to do this  effectually is to give the upper proprietors of rivers such an  interest in the Salmon fisheries as will make them worth  attention. At present this is far from being the case. Now the  upper proprietors are merely considered as so many clucking hens,  whose business and whose duty it is to hatch Salmon for the  proprietors of fisheries at the mouths of rivers, who do not in  many cases spend a farthing in their protection when spawning, and  who grievously begrudge the upper proprietors every fish that is  able to pass their nets and other engines of destruction. Let the  upper proprietors of Salmon rivers bestir themselves so to amend  the law as to give them a chance of having a supply of Salmon when  they are in season. They cannot and will not have a more efficient  ally than Salmo Salar. Salmo Salar is in my opinion quite right  when he says that the fish kept in ponds will not be quite so well  able to take care of themselves as fish which have been bred and  lived all their lives in the river. Nor do I think that this is  necessary for any longer period than until the young fry get rid  of the umbilical vessel; after which they are quite able to take  care of themselves. Before that time they are scarcely able to  move, and thousands of them fall a prey, not only to the other  fish, but to the larvae of aquatic insects which prey upon them  very greedily. As I happen to know from my own observations, the  larva of the stone fly (May fly of Lancashire) and those of all  the larger ephemera (drakes), to say nothing of the fresh-water  shrimps, swarm in all the spawning beds, and no doubt destroy  myriads of the ova. All these would be saved by proper precautions  and well formed spawning-boxes, with good supplies of spring water  to feed them.    I think Salmo Salar has very greatly over-estimated the quantity  of Salmon fry that go down to the sea from the rivers. He speaks  of them going down by millions. Now we will take the river Hodder  as a river with which both Salmo Salar and myself are well  acquainted, and I will venture to say that, so far is this an  over-estimate, that if he would take the hundredth part of the  number he would be much nearer the truth. The Samlets when they go  to the sea may be reckoned to weigh eight to the pound, and two  millions would at that rate weigh one hundred and ten tons. Does  Salmo Salar think that one ton and a tenth of Smolts go down the  river Hodder to the sea on an average of years? I have more  favourable means of judging of the quantity that go down the river  Ribble than I have of those of the Hodder, and I believe I should  very greatly exaggerate their numbers if I estimated them at any  such weight as a fourth of that quantity. Again, the Hodder and  the Ribble are, in some respects, far more favourable for spawning  than many other rivers; for partly owing to the country through  which they pass, and partly owing to the rapidity of their  streams, the gravel is large and very suitable for spawning in;  there is also far less mud and sand in them, and the spawning beds  are much less liable to be choked up than they are in many other  rivers. No doubt the Salmon will make the best selection in their  power, but they can only select from such places as there are; and  if those are not suitable the ova must be in a great measure  destroyed. Since Ramsbottom returned from Scotland he has visited  the river Dee, about forty miles from Chester, and there he found  the spawning beds (ridds as Salmo Salar calls them) silted up with  mud and sand, and the ova buried in them to the depth of eighteen  inches. How or when were the newly hatched fish (supposing, which  is very improbable, that they ever did hatch) to make their escape  from such a heap of filth? It would be quite impossible.    In conclusion, it seems desirable and quite necessary to say a few  words as to the priority of discovery of this process of fish  propagation. The French claim it; the Irish seem to claim it; the  Messrs. Ashworth take great credit for it; and now Salmo Salar  says he first suggested it. Allow me, as there are so many  claimants in the field, to suggest one or two more. In the year  1832, without knowing that such a thing had ever been done or even  thought of, I made some experiments on the spawning of fish and  the artificial impregnation of their ova, which I communicated to  \"Loudon's Magazine of Natural History,\" in which they appeared.  After that came the Duke of Buccleuch's game-keeper, Shaw, whose  experiments were both satisfactory and conclusive. This was in  1836 or 1838. Then after my experiments at home, I induced Mr.  Fawkes to take up the matter in 1841, and they were resumed in  1842, and again in 1848 and 1849, both with Salmon and Trout. It  was at this period that Ramsbottom came into the field. At Mr.  Fawkes's request I instructed him in the art, and sent him to  Farnley, where he was perfectly successful; and since then, I  believe he has had more experience and been more successful than  any other propagator in the kingdom.    The principle of this system is very easily comprehended; but  success depends on many niceties of manipulation, and much  experience in judging whether the fish, both male and female, are  in the proper condition for operating upon.    This experience is not gained without much practice. This practice  Ramsbottom has in great perfection. There is no doubt the  artificial breeding of fish will be found exceedingly beneficial,  if properly carried out; and I hope to see the time when Salmo  Salar may catch half-a-dozen of his namesakes at Whitewell, any  good day in the season.    I am, Sir,  Yours very truly,  THOMAS GARNETT.    * * * * *    ARTIFICIAL BREEDING OF FISH--(CONTINUED).    CLITHEROE, _9th January_, 1854.    To the Editor of the \"Manchester Guardian.\"    SIR,--As I believe that Salmo Salar is quite as desirous of  increasing the breed of Salmon as myself, the controversy between  us may be reduced to very narrow limits. He believes that Trout  eat very few of the Salmon ova, and therefore cannot do much harm.  I will just mention a few facts which make me think otherwise.  When Ramsbottom was in Galway he caught in one night twenty-five  Trout on the spawning ground, which had on the average not less  than five hundred ova in each of their stomachs; from one of their  throats he squeezed a thousand. As the net would not take a fish  of less than two pounds, how many had passed through it? When he  was at Knowlmere, in sweeping the river for spawning fish he  caught nine Par, two Trouts, and a Sprod on the spawning bed, all  of which were gorged with Salmon spawn; when he went into the  brooks there he never found a pair of Trout spawning without also  finding a number of smaller fish behind, some of which he caught,  and in all such cases found them gorged with roe up to the throat;  the male Trout would occasionally drive them off, but as soon as  he returned to the female they were again close in the rear.    In the \"Perthshire Courier\" of the 22nd December is the following  statement: The men employed in taking the breeding fish secured a  Whitling on Tuesday about three-quarters of a pound, and as they  observed Salmon ova coming out of his mouth he was brought to the  office of Mr. Buist for examination; on being opened, upwards of  three hundred impregnated Salmon ova were taken from his stomach  quite undigested. It may be, therefore, fairly presumed, that this  youngster had taken this quantity for his breakfast; if he dined  and breakfasted in the same style each day during the breeding  season, it is difficult to estimate the expense of his keep. Such  is the amount of loss of impregnated roe in one morning from one  trifling fish; what must it be throughout the season from the  various enemies it has to encounter?    Salmo Salar is facetious about the destruction of the roe by  insects, and says, \"because an aquatic insect will devour a  minnow's egg, which is not as large as a pin's head, we have no  right to infer that it will devour that of a Salmon, which is as  large as a pea; it would be just as reasonable to suppose that  because a wasp feasts upon a cherry, or a strawberry, therefore he  will eat a turnip or a mangold wurtzel.\" As he seems to have made  a slip of the pen in naming the two last _fruits_, allow me to  supply what I suppose he meant to say, which I presume was that  because a wasp eats a cherry or a strawberry, we must not  therefore infer that he will either eat a pear or a plum; if that  is his meaning, I think I can understand it. If he adheres to his  own version, I would merely observe that there is no analogy in  the two cases. But the inference does not rest upon mere  supposition; the freshwater shrimps at Knowlmere were seen  devouring the ova in the spawning-boxes. We have seen above that  Par eat ova as well as Trout. Let us suppose that the millions of  Smolts (as Par) have only one meal each of Salmon roe, and we will  stint them to twenty ova apiece. I fear that very few of the five  millions which Salmo Salar says are deposited in the Hodder will  be left to grow into Salmon. In addition to these, ducks, both  wild and tame, eat them greedily. When Ramsbottom was in Galway he  saw that the tame ducks frequented the spawning ford, and the  superintendent bought one, and found its"]]]
