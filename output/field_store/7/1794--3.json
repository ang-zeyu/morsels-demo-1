(2) Far away and Long ago (1918) chs. xvi and xvii.      (3) As to the tendency to divinize these totems, this arises no doubt  partly out of question (2). The animal or other object admired on  account of its strength or swiftness, or adopted as guardian of the  tribe because of its keen sight or prophetic quality, or infinitely  prized on account of its food-value, or felt for any other reason to  have a peculiar relation and affinity to the tribe, is by that fact SET  APART. It becomes taboo. It must not be killed--except under necessity  and by sanction of the whole tribe--nor injured; and all dealings with  it must be fenced round with regulations. It is out of this taboo or  system of taboos that, according to Reinach, religion arose. \"I propose  (he says) to define religion as: A SUM OF SCRUPLES (TABOOS) WHICH IMPEDE  THE FREE EXERCISE OF OUR FACULTIES.\" (1) Obviously this definition is  gravely deficient, simply because it is purely negative, and leaves  out of account the positive aspect of the subject. In Man, the positive  content of religion is the instinctive sense--whether conscious or  subconscious--of an inner unity and continuity with the world around.  This is the stuff out of which religion is made. The scruples or taboos  which \"impede the freedom\" of this relation are the negative forces  which give outline and form to the relation. These are the things which  generate the RITES AND CEREMONIALS of religion; and as far as Reinach  means by religion MERELY rites and ceremonies he is correct; but clearly  he only covers half the subject. The tendency to divinize the totem is  at least as much dependent on the positive sense of unity with it, as on  the negative scruples which limit the relation in each particular case.  But I shall return to this subject presently, and more than once, with  the view of clarifying it. Just now it will be best to illustrate the  nature of Totems generally, and in some detail.       (1) See Orpheus by S. Reinach, p. 3.      As would be gathered from what I have just said, there is found among  all the more primitive peoples, and in all parts of the world, an  immense variety of totem-names. The Dinkas, for instance, are a rather  intelligent well-grown people inhabiting the upper reaches of the Nile  in the vicinity of the great swamps. According to Dr. Seligman their  clans have for totems the lion, the elephant, the crocodile, the  hippopotamus, the fox, and the hyena, as well as certain birds which  infest and damage the corn, some plants and trees, and such things as  rain, fire, etc. \"Each clan speaks of its totem as its ancestor, and  refrains (as a rule) from injuring or eating it.\" (1) The members of the  Crocodile clan call themselves \"brothers of the crocodile.\" The tribes  of Bechuana-land have a very similar list of totem-names--the buffalo,  the fish, the porcupine, the wild vine, etc. They too have a Crocodile  clan, but they call the crocodile their FATHER! The tribes of Australia  much the same again, with the differences suitable to their country; and  the Red Indians of North America the same. Garcilasso, della Vega,  the Spanish historian, son of an Inca princess by one of the Spanish  conquerors of Peru and author of the well-known book Commentarias  Reales, says in that book (i, 57), speaking of the pre-Inca period, \"An  Indian (of Peru) was not considered honorable unless he was descended  from a fountain, river or lake, or even from the sea, or from a wild  animal, as a bear, lion, tiger, eagle, or the bird they call cuntur  (condor), or some other bird of prey.\" (2) According to Lewis Morgan,  the North American Indians of various tribes had for totems the wolf,  bear, beaver, turtle, deer, snipe, heron, hawk, crane, loon, turkey,  muskrat; pike, catfish, carp; buffalo, elk, reindeer, eagle, hare,  rabbit, snake; reed-grass, sand, rock, and tobacco-plant.     (1) See The Golden Bough, vol. iv, p. 31.     (2) See Andrew Lang, Custom and Myth, p. 104, also Myth, Ritual  and Religion, vol. i, pp. 71, 76, etc.      So we might go on rather indefinitely. I need hardly say that in more  modern and civilized life, relics of the totem system are still to be  found in the forms of the heraldic creatures adopted for their crests by  different families, and in the bears, lions, eagles, the sun, moon and  stars and so forth, which still adorn the flags and are flaunted as the  insignia of the various nations. The names may not have been ORIGINALLY  adopted from any definite belief in blood-relationship with the animal  or other object in question; but when, as Robertson says (Pagan Christs,  p. 104), a \"savage learned that he was 'a Bear' and that his father  and grandfather and forefathers were so before him, it was really  impossible, after ages in which totem-names thus passed current, that he  should fail to assume that his folk were DESCENDED from a bear.\"    As a rule, as may be imagined, the savage tribesman will on no account  EAT his tribal totem-animal. Such would naturally be deemed a kind of  sacrilege. Also it must be remarked that some totems are hardly suitable  for eating. Yet it is important to observe that occasionally, and  guarding the ceremony with great precautions, it has been an almost  universal custom for the tribal elders to call a feast at which  an animal (either the totem or some other) IS killed and commonly  eaten--and this in order that the tribesmen may absorb some virtue  belonging to it, and may confirm their identity with the tribe and with  each other. The eating of the bear or other animal, the sprinkling with  its blood, and the general ritual in which the participants shared its  flesh, or dressed and disguised themselves in its skin, or otherwise  identified themselves with it, was to them a symbol of their community  of life with each other, and a means of their renewal and salvation in  the holy emblem. And this custom, as the reader will perceive, became  the origin of the Eucharists and Holy Communions of the later religions.    Professor Robertson-Smith's celebrated Camel affords an instance of  this. (1) It appears that St. Nilus (fifth century) has left a detailed  account of the occasional sacrifice in his time of a spotless white  camel among the Arabs of the Sinai region, which closely resembles a  totemic communion-feast. The uncooked blood and flesh of the animal had  to be entirely consumed by the faithful before daybreak. \"The slaughter  of the victim, the sacramental drinking of the blood, and devouring in  wild haste of the pieces of still quivering flesh, recall the details  of the Dionysiac and other festivals.\" (2) Robertson-Smith himself  says:--\"The plain meaning is that the victim was devoured before its  life had left the still warm blood and flesh... and that thus in the  most literal way, all those who shared in the ceremony absorbed part of  the victim's life into themselves. One sees how much more forcibly  than any ordinary meal such a rite expresses the establishment or  confirmation of a bond of common life between the worshipers, and also,  since the blood is shed upon the altar itself, between the worshipers  and their god. In this sacrifice, then, the significant factors are two:  the conveyance of the living blood to the godhead, and the absorption of  the living flesh and blood into the flesh and blood of the worshippers.  Each of these is effected in the simplest and most direct manner, so  that the meaning of the ritual is perfectly transparent.\"     (1) See his Religion of the Semites, p. 320.     (2) They also recall the rites of the Passover--though in this  latter the blood was no longer drunk, nor the flesh eaten raw.      It seems strange, of course, that men should eat their totems; and  it must not by any means be supposed that this practice is (or was)  universal; but it undoubtedly obtains in some cases. As Miss Harrison  says (Themis, p. 123); \"you do not as a rule eat your relations,\" and as  a rule the eating of a totem is tabu and forbidden, but (Miss Harrison  continues) \"at certain times and under certain restrictions a man not  only may, but MUST, eat of his totem, though only sparingly, as of a  thing sacrosanct.\" The ceremonial carried out in a communal way by the  tribe not only identifies the tribe with the totem (animal), but is  held, according to early magical ideas, and when the animal is desired  for food, to favor its manipulation. The human tribe partakes of the  mana or life-force of the animal, and is strengthened; the animal tribe  is sympathetically renewed by the ceremonial and multiplies exceedingly.  The slaughter of the sacred animal and (often) the simultaneous  outpouring of human blood seals the compact and confirms the magic. This  is well illustrated by a ceremony of the 'Emu' tribe referred to by Dr.  Frazer:--    \"In order to multiply Emus which are an important article of food, the  men of the Emu totem in the Arunta tribe proceed as follows: They clear  a small spot of level ground, and opening veins in their arms they let  the blood stream out until the surface of the ground for a space of  about three square yards is soaked with it. When the blood has dried  and caked, it forms a hard and fairly impermeable surface, on which they  paint the sacred design of the emu totem, especially the parts of the  bird which they like best to eat, namely, the fat and the eggs. Round  this painting the men sit and sing. Afterwards performers wearing long  head-dresses to represent the long neck and small head of the emu, mimic  the appearance of the bird as it stands aimlessly peering about in all  directions.\" (1)     (1) The Golden Bough i, 85--with reference to Spencer and  Gillen's Native Tribes of Central Australia, pp. 179, 189.      Thus blood sacrifice comes in; and--(whether this has ever actually  happened in the case of the Central Australians I know not)--we can  easily"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15620"],[0,"Recreations in Astronomy (#10)"],[1," our estimate of the distance of our sun 3,000,000  miles.    [Illustration: Fig. 21.--Mural Circle.]    Consider the nicety of the work. Suppose the graduated scale to  be thirty feet in circumference. Divided into 360 deg., each would  be one inch long. Divide each degree into 60', each one is 1/60  of an inch long. It takes good eyesight to discern it. But each  minute must be [Page 62] divided into 60\", and these must not only  be noted, but even tenths and hundredths of seconds must be  discerned. Of course they are not seen by the naked eye; some  mechanical contrivance must be called in to assist. A watch loses  two minutes a week, and hence is unreliable. It is taken to a  watch-maker that every single second may be quickened 1/20160 part  of itself. Now 1/20000 part of a second would be a small interval of  time to measure, but it must be under control. If the temperature of  a summer morning rises ten or twenty degrees we scarcely notice it;  but the magnetic tastimeter measures 1/5000 of a degree.    Come to earthly matters. In 1874, after nearly twenty-eight years'  work, the State of Massachusetts opened a tunnel nearly five miles  long through the Hoosac Mountains. In the early part of the work  the engineers sunk a shaft near the middle 1028 feet deep. Then the  question to be settled was where to go so as to meet the approaching  excavations from the east and west. A compass could not be relied  on under a mountain. The line must be mechanically fixed. A little  divergence at the starting-point would become so great, miles away,  that the excavations might pass each other without meeting; the  grade must also rise toward the central shaft, and fall in working  away from it; but the lines were fixed with such infinitesimal  accuracy that, when the one going west from the eastern portal and  the one going east from the shaft met in the heart of the mountain,  the western line was only one-eighth of an inch too high, and  three-sixteenths of an inch too far north. To reach this perfect  result they had to triangulate from the eastern portal to distant  [Page 63] mountain peaks, and thence down the valley to the central  shaft, and thus fix the direction of the proposed line across the  mouth of the shaft. Plumb-lines were then dropped one thousand and  twenty-eight feet, and thus the line at the bottom was fixed.    Three attempts were made--in 1867, 1870, and 1872--to fix the exact  time-distance between Greenwich and Washington. These three separate  efforts do not differ one-tenth of a second. Such demonstrable results  on earth greatly increase our confidence in similar measurements  in the skies.    [Illustration: Fig. 22.]    A scale is frequently affixed to a pocket-rule, by which we can  easily measure one-hundredth of an inch (Fig. 22). The upper and  lower line is divided into tenths of an inch. Observe the slanting  line at the right hand. It leans from the perpendicular one-tenth  of an inch, as shown by noticing where it reaches the top line. When  it reaches the second horizontal line it has left the perpendicular  one-tenth of that tenth--that is, one-hundredth. The intersection  marks 99/100 of an inch from one end, and one-hundredth from the  other.    When division-lines, on measures of great nicety, get too fine  to be read by the eye, we use the microscope. By its means we are  able to count 112,000 lines ruled on a glass plate within an inch.  The smallest object that can be seen by a keen eye makes an angle  of 40\", but by putting six microscopes on the scale of the telescope  on the mural circle, we are able to reach an exactness of 0\".1, or  1/3600 of an inch. This instrument is used to measure the declination  of stars, or angular [Page 64] distance north or south of the  equator. Thus a star's place in two directions is exactly fixed.  When the telescope is mounted on two pillars instead of the face of  a wall, it is called a transit instrument. This is used to determine  the time of transit of a star over the meridian, and if the transit  instrument is provided with a graduated circle it can also be used  for the same purposes as the mural circle. Man's capacity to measure  exactly is indicated in his ascertainment of the length of waves of  light. It is easy to measure the three hundred feet distance between  the crests of storm-waves in the wide Atlantic; easy to measure the  different wave-lengths of the different tones of musical sounds. So  men measure the lengths of the undulations of light. The shortest is  of the violet light, 154.84 ten-millionths of an inch. By the  horizontal pendulum Professor Root has made 1/36000000 of an inch  apparent.    The next elements of accuracy must be perfect time and perfect  notation of time. As has been said, we get our time from the stars.  Thus the infinite and heavenly dominates the finite and earthly.  Clocks are set to the invariable sidereal time. Sidereal noon is  when we have turned ourselves under the point where the sun crosses  the equator in March, called the vernal equinox. Sidereal clocks  are figured to indicate twenty-four hours in a day: they tick exact  seconds. To map stars we wish to know the exact second when they  cross the meridian, or the north and south line in the celestial  dome above us. The telescope (Fig. 21, p. 61) swings exactly north  and south. In its focus a set of fine threads of spider-lines is  placed (Fig. 23). The telescope is set just high enough, so that  by the rolling over of the earth [Page 65] the star will come into  the field just above the horizontal thread. The observer notes the  exact second and tenth of a second when the star reaches each  vertical thread in the instrument, adds together the times and  divides by five to get the average, and the exact time is reached.    [Illustration: Fig. 23.--Transit of a Star noted.]    But man is not reliable enough to observe and record with sufficient  accuracy. Some, in their excitement, anticipate its positive passage,  and some cannot get their slow mental machinery in motion till  after it has made the transit. Moreover, men fall into a habit of  estimating some numbers of tenths of a second oftener than others.  It will be found that a given observer will say three tenths or  seven tenths oftener than four or eight. He is falling into ruts,  and not trustworthy. General O. M. Mitchel, who had been director  of the Cincinnati Observatory, once told one of his staff-officers  that he was late at an appointment. \"Only a few minutes,\" said the  officer, apologetically. \"Sir,\" said the general, \"where I have  been accustomed to work, hundredths of a second are too important  to be neglected.\" And it is to the rare genius of this astronomer,  and to others, that we owe the mechanical accuracy that we now  attain. The clock is made to mark its seconds on paper wrapped  around a revolving cylinder. Under the observer's fingers is an  electric key. This he can touch at the instant of the transit of  the star [Page 66] over each wire, and thus put his observation on  the same line between the seconds dotted by the clock. Of course  these distances can be measured to minute fractional parts of a  second.    But it has been found that it takes an appreciable time for every  observer to get a thing into his head and out of his finger-ends,  and it takes some observers longer than others. A dozen men, seeing  an electric spark, are liable to bring down their recording marks  in a dozen different places on the revolving paper. Hence the time  that it takes for each man to get a thing into his head and out  of his fingers is ascertained. This time is called his personal  equation, and is subtracted from all of his observations in order to  get at the true time; so willing are men to be exact about material  matters. Can it be thought that moral and spiritual matters have  no precision? Thus distances east or west from any given star or  meridian are secured; those north and south from the equator or  the zenith are as easily fixed, and thus we make such accurate  maps of the heavens that any movements in the far-off stars--so  far that it may take centuries to render the swiftest movements  appreciable--may at length be recognized and accounted for.    [Illustration: Fig. 24.]    We now come to a little study of the modes of measuring distances.  Create a perfect square (Fig. 24); draw a diagonal line. The square  angles are 90 deg., the divided angles give two of 45 deg. each. Now the  base A B is equal to the perpendicular A C. Now any point--C, where  a perpendicular, A C, and a diagonal, B C, meet--will be [Page 67]  as far from A as B is. It makes no difference if a river flows  between A and C, and we cannot go over it; we can measure its  distance as easily as if we could. Set a table four feet by eight  out-doors (Fig. 25); so arrange it that, looking along one end, the  line of sight just strikes a tree the other side of the river. Go to  the other end, and, looking toward the tree, you find the line of  sight to the tree falls an inch from the end of the table on the  farther side. The lines, therefore, approach each other one inch in  every four feet, and will come together at a tree three hundred and  eighty-four feet away.    [Illustration: Fig. 25.--Measuring Distances.]    [Illustration: Fig. 26.--Measuring Elevations.]    The next process is to measure the height or magnitude of objects  at an ascertained distance. Put two pins in a stick half an inch  apart (Fig. 26). Hold it up two feet from the eye, and let the  upper pin fall in line with your eye and the top of a distant church  steeple, and the lower pin in line with the bottom of the church and  your eye. If the church is three-fourths of a mile away, it must  be eighty-two feet high; if a mile away, it must be one hundred  and ten feet high. For if two lines spread [Page 68] one-half an  inch going two feet, in going four feet they will spread an inch,  and in going a"]]]
