Seven incarnations of  Siva are not generally recognized (see Monier Williams, _Religious  Thought and Life in India_, pp. 78-86, and 107-16). For the theory  and mystical meaning of _avatars_, see Grierson, _J.R.A.S._, 1909,  pp. 621-44. The word avatar means 'descent', _scil_. of the Deity to  earth, and covers more than the term 'incarnation'.    5. Sita was an incarnation of Lakshmi. She became incarnate again,  many centuries afterwards, as the wife of Krishna, another  incarnation of Vishnu [W. H. S.]. Reckoning by centuries is, of  course, inapplicable to pure myth. The author believed in Bentley's  baseless chronology.    6. For the Mahabharata, see _ante_, note 11, Chapter 1. The Bhagavata  Purana is the most popular of the Puranas, The Hindi version of the  tenth book (_skandha_) is known as the 'Prem Sagar'. The date of the  composition of the Puranas is uncertain.    7. The dates given in this passage are purely imaginary. Parts of the  Mahabharata are very ancient. Yudhishthira is no more an historical  personage than Achilles or Romulus. It is improbable that a 'throne  of Delhi' existed in 575 B.C., and hardly anything is known about the  state of India at that date.    8. It is hardly necessary to observe that this grotesque theory is  utterly at variance with the facts, as now known.    9. The existing settlements of native Christians at Agra are mostly  of modern origin. Very ancient Christian communities exist near  Madras, and on the Malabar coast. The travels of Jean de Thevenot  were published in 1684, under the title of _Voyage, contenant la  Relation de l'Indostan_. The English version, by A. Lovell (London,  1687), is entitled _The Travels of Monsieur de Thevenot into the  Levant, in three Parts_. Part III deals with the East Indies, The  passage referred to is: 'Some affirm that there are twenty-five  thousand Christian Families in Agra, but all do not agree in that'  (Part III, p. 35). Thevonot's statement about the Christians of Agra  is further discussed post in Chapter 52.    10. The war with Nepal began in October, 1814, and was not concluded  till 1816. During its progress the British arms suffered several  reverses.    11. The Betiya (Bettiah of _I. G_., 1908) Raj is a great estate with  an area of 1,824 square miles in the northern part of the Champaran  District of Bihar, in the Province of Bihar and Orissa. A great  portion of the estate is held (1908) on permanent leases by European  indigo-planters.    12. For discussion of this system see post, Chapter 7.    13. 'Pucka' (_pakka_) here means 'masonry', as opposed to 'Kutcha'  (_kachcha_), meaning 'earthen'.    14. Native Christians, according to the census of 1872, number 1,214  persons, who are principally found in Bettia thana [police-circle].  There are two Missions, one at Bettia, and the other at the village  of Chuhari, both supported by the Roman Catholic Church. The former  was founded in 1746 by a certain Father Joseph, from Garingano in  Italy, who went to Bettia on the invitation of the Maharaja. The  present number of converts is about 1,000 persons. Being principally  descendants of Brahmans, they hold a fair social position; but some  of them are extremely poor. About one-fourth are carpenters, one-  tenth blacksmiths, one-tenth servants, the remainder carters. The  Chuhari Mission was founded in 1770 by three Catholic priests, who  had been expelled from Nepal [after the Gorkha conquest in 1768].  There are now 283 converts, mostly descendants of Nepalis. They are  all agriculturists, and very poor (Article 'Champaran District' in  _Statistical Account of Bengal_, 1877).     The statement in _I.G._ 1908, s.v. Bettiah, differs slightly, as  follows:       'A Roman Catholic Mission was established about 1740 by Father  Joseph Mary, an Italian missionary of the Capuchin Order, who was  passing near Bettiah on his way to Nepal, when he was summoned by  Raja Dhruva Shah to attend his daughter, who was dangerously ill. He  succeeded in curing her, and the grateful Raja invited him to stay at  Bettiah and gave him a house and ninety acres of land.' The Bettiah  Mission still exists and maintains the Catholic Mission Press, where  publications illustrating the history of the Capuchin Missions have  been printed. Father Felix, O.C., is at work on the subject.          CHAPTER 3      Legend of the Nerbudda River.    The legend is that the Nerbudda, which flows west into the Gulf of  Cambay, was wooed and won in the usual way by the Son river, which  rises from the same tableland of Amarkantak, and flows east into the  Ganges and Bay of Bengal.[1] All the previous ceremonies having been  performed, the Son [2] came with 'due pomp and circumstance' to fetch  his bride in the procession called the 'Barat', up to which time the  bride and bridegroom are supposed never to have seen each other,  unless perchance they have met in infancy. Her Majesty the Nerbudda  became exceedingly impatient to know what sort of a personage her  destinies were to be linked to, while his Majesty the Son advanced at  a slow and stately pace. At last the Queen sent Johila, the daughter  of the barber, to take a close view of him, and to return and make a  faithful and particular report of his person. His Majesty was  captivated with the little Johila, the barber's daughter, at first  sight; and she, 'nothing loath', yielded to his caresses. Some say  that she actually pretended to be Queen herself; and that his Majesty  was no further in fault than in mistaking the humble handmaid for her  noble mistress; but, be that as it may, her Majesty no sooner heard  of the good understanding between them, than she rushed forward, and  with one foot sent the Son rolling back to the east whence he came,  and with the other kicked little Johila sprawling after him; for,  said the high priest, who told us the story, 'You see what a towering  passion she was likely to have been in under such indignities from  the furious manner in which she cuts her way through the marble rocks  beneath us, and casts huge masses right and left as she goes along,  as if they were really so many coco-nuts'. 'And was she', asked I,  'to have flown eastward with him, or was he to have flown westward  with her?' 'She was to have accompanied him eastward', said the high  priest, 'but her Majesty, after this indignity, declared that she  would not go a single pace in the same direction with such wretches,  and would flow west, though all the other rivers in India might flow  east; and west she flows accordingly, a virgin queen.' I asked some  of the Hindoos about us why they called her 'Mother Nerbudda', if she  was really never married. 'Her Majesty', said they with great  respect, 'would really never consent to be married after the  indignity she suffered from her affianced bridegroom the Son; and we  call her Mother because she blesses us all, and we are anxious to  accost her by the name which we consider to be at once the most  respectful and endearing.'    Any Englishman can easily conceive a poet in his highest 'calenture  of the brain' addressing the ocean as 'a steed that knows his rider',  and patting the crested billow as his flowing mane; but he must come  to India to understand how every individual of a whole community of  many millions can address a fine river as a living being, a sovereign  princess, who hears and understands all they say, and exercises a  kind of local superintendence over their affairs, without a single  temple in which her image is worshipped, or a single priest to profit  by the delusion. As in the case of the Ganges, it is the river itself  to whom they address themselves, and not to any deity residing in it,  or presiding over it: the stream itself is the deity which fills  their imaginations, and receives their homage.    Among the Romans and ancient Persians rivers were propitiated by  sacrifices. When Vitellius crossed the Euphrates with the Roman  legions to put Tiridates on the throne of Armenia, they propitiated  the river according to the rites of their country by the  _suovetaurilia_, the sacrifice of the hog, the ram, and the bull.  Tiridates did the same by the sacrifice of a horse. Tacitus does not  mention the river _god_, but the river _itself_, as propitiated (see  [_Annals_,] book vi, chap. 37).[3] Plato makes Socrates condemn Homer  for making Achilles behave disrespectfully towards the river Xanthus,  though acknowledged to be a divinity, in offering to fight him,[4]  and towards the river Sperchius, another acknowledged god, in  presenting to the dead body of Patroclus the locks of his hair which  he had promised to that river.[5]    The Son river, which rises near the source of the Nerbudda on the  tableland of Amarkantak, takes a westerly course for some miles, and  then turns off suddenly to the east, and is joined by the little  stream of the Johila before it descends the great cascade; and hence  the poets have created this fiction, which the mass of the population  receive as divine revelation. The statue of little Johila, the  barber's daughter, in stone, stands in the temple of the goddess  Nerbudda at Amarkantak, bound in chains.[6] It may here be remarked  that the first overtures in India must always be made through the  medium of the barber, whether they be from the prince or the  peasant.[7] If a sovereign prince sends proposals to a sovereign  princess, they must be conveyed through the medium of the barber, or  they will never be considered as done in due form, as likely to prove  propitious. The prince will, of course, send some relation or high  functionary with him; but in all the credentials the barber must be  named as the principal functionary. Hence it was that Her Majesty was  supposed to have sent a barber's daughter to meet her husband.    The 'Mahatam' (greatness or holiness) of the Ganges is said, as I  have already stated, to be on the wane, and not likely to endure  sixty years longer;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15488"],[0,"Woman's Life in Colonial Days (#10)"],[1,"home at least the Puritan woman was not entirely the silent, meek  creature she was supposed to be; her opinions were not only heard by  husband and father but heeded with considerable respect.    And what became of this first woman leader in America? Whether the fate  of this woman was typical of what was in store for all female speakers  and women outside their place is not stated by the elders; but they were  firm in their belief that her death was an appropriate punishment. She  removed to Rhode Island and later to New York, where she and all her  family, with the exception of one person, were killed by the Indians. As  Thomas Welde says in the preface of _A Short Story of the Rise, Wane  and Ruin of the Antinomians_ (1644): \"I never heard that the Indians in  these parts did ever before commit the like outrage upon any one family,  or families; and therefore God's hand is the more apparently seen  herein, to pick out this woful woman, to make her and those belonging to  her an unheard of heavy example of their cruelty above others.\"      _VIII. Woman and Witchcraft_    It was at staid Boston that Anne Hutchinson marshalled her forces; it  was at peace-loving Salem that the Devil marshalled his witches in a  last despairing onslaught against the saints. To many readers there may  seem to be little or no connection between witchcraft and religion; but  an examination of the facts leading to the execution of the various  martyrs to superstition at Salem will convince the skeptical that there  was a most intimate relationship between the Puritan creed and the  theory of witchcraft.    Looking back after the passing of more than two hundred years, we cannot  but deem it strange that such an enlightened, educated and thoroughly  intelligent folk as the Puritans could have believed in the possession  of this malignant power. Especially does it appear incredible when we  remember that here was a people that came to this country for the  exercise of religious freedom, a citizenship that was descended from men  trained in the universities of England, a stalwart band that under  extreme privation had founded a college within sixteen years after the  settlement of a wilderness. It must be borne in mind, however, that the  Massachusetts colonies were not alone in this belief in witchcraft. It  was common throughout the world, and was as aged as humanity. Deprived  of the aid of modern science in explaining peculiar processes and  happenings, man had long been accustomed to fall back upon devils,  witches, and evil spirits as premises for his arguments. While the  execution of the witch was not so common an event elsewhere in the  world, during the Salem period, yet it was not unknown among so-called  enlightened people. As late as 1712 a woman was burned near London for  witchcraft, and several city clergymen were among the prosecutors.    A few extracts from colonial writings should make clear the attitude of  the Puritan leaders toward these unfortunates accused of being in league  with the devil. Winthrop thus records a case in 1648: \"At the court one  Margaret Jones of Charlestown was indicted and found guilty of  witchcraft, and hanged for it. The evidence against her was, that she  was found to have such a malignant touch, as many persons, (men, women,  and children), whom she stroked or touched with any affection or  displeasure, etc., were taken with deafness ... or other violent pains  or sickness.... Some things which she foretold came to pass.... Her  behaviour at her trial was very intemperate, lying notoriously, and  railing upon the jury and witnesses, etc., and in the like distemper she  died. The same day and hour, she was executed, there was a very great  tempest at Connecticut, which blew down many trees, etc.\"[19]    Whether in North or in South, whether among Protestants or Catholics,  this belief in witchcraft existed. In one of the annual letters of the  \"English Province of the Society of Jesus,\" written in 1656, we find  the following comment concerning the belief among emigrants to Maryland:  \"The tempest lasted two months in all, whence the opinion arose, that it  was not raised by the violence of the sea or atmosphere, but was  occasioned by the malevolence of witches. Forthwith they seize a little  old woman suspected of sorcery; and after examining her with the  strictest scrutiny, guilty or not guilty, they slay her, suspected of  this very heinous sin. The corpse, and whatever belonged to her, they  cast into the sea. But the winds did not thus remit their violence, or  the raging sea its threatenings....\"[20]    Even in Virginia, where less rigid religious authority existed, it was  not uncommon to hear accusations of sorcery and witchcraft. The form of  hysteria at length reached at Salem was the result of no sudden burst of  terror, but of a long evolution of ideas dealing with the power of  Satan. As early as 1638 Josselyn, a traveler in New England, wrote in  _New England's Rareties Discovered_: \"There are none that beg in the  country, but there be witches too many ... that produce many strange  apparitions if you will believe report, of a shallop at sea manned with  women; of a ship and a great red horse standing by the main-mast, the  ship being in a small cove to the eastward vanished of a sudden. Of a  witch that appeared aboard of a ship twenty leagues to sea to a mariner  who took up the carpenter's broad axe and cleft her head with it, the  witch dying of the wound at home.\"    The religion of Salem and Boston was well fitted for developing this  very theory of malignant power in \"possessed\" persons. The teachings  that there was a personal devil, that God allowed him to tempt mankind,  that there were myriads of devils under Satan's control at all times,  ever watchful to entrap the unwary, that these devils were rulers over  certain territory and certain types of people--these teachings naturally  led to the assumption that the imps chose certain persons as their very  own. Moreover, the constant reminders of the danger of straying from the  strait and narrow way, and of the tortures of the afterworld led to  self-consciousness, introspection, and morbidness. The idea that Satan  was at all times seeking to undermine the Puritan church also made it  easy to believe that anyone living outside of, or contrary to, that  church was an agent of the devil, in short, bewitched. As it is only the  useful that survives, it was essential that the army of devils be given  a work to do, and this work was evident in the spirit of those who dared  to act and think in non-conformity to the rule of the church. The  devil's ways, too, were beyond the comprehension of man, cunning,  smooth, sly; the most godly might fall a victim, with the terrible  consequence that one might become bewitched and know it not. At this  stage it was the bounden duty of the unfortunate being's church brethren  to help him by inducing him to confess the indwelling of an evil spirit  and thus free himself from the great impostor. And if he did not confess  then it were better that he be killed, lest the devil through him  contaminate all. Why, says Mather, in his _Wonders of the Invisible  World_: \"If the devils now can strike the minds of men with any poisons  of so fine a composition and operation, that scores of innocent people  shall unite in confessions of a crime which we see actually committed,  it is a thing prodigious, beyond the wonders of the former ages, and it  threatens no less than a sort of dissolution upon the world.\"    To avoid or counteract this desolation was the purpose of the legal  proceedings at Salem. It was believed by fairly intelligent people that  Satan carried with him a black book in which he induced his victims to  write their names with their own blood, signifying thereby that they had  given their souls into his keeping, and were henceforth his liegemen.  The rendezvous of these lost and damned was deep in the forest; the time  of meeting, midnight. In such a place and at such an hour the assembly  of witches and wizards plotted against the saints of God, namely, the  Puritans. According to Cotton Mather's _Wonders of the Invisible World_,  at the trial of one of these martyrs to superstition, George Burroughs,  he was accused by eight of the confessing witches \"as being the head  actor at some of their hellish rendezvouzes, and one who had the promise  of being a king in Satan's kingdom, now going to be erected. One of them  falling into a kind of trance affirmed that G.B. had carried her away  into a very high mountain, where he shewed her mighty and glorious  kingdoms, and said, 'he would give them all to her, if she would write  in his book.'\"    In such an era, of course, the attempt was too often made to explain  events, not in the light of common reason but as visitations of God to  try the faith of the folk, or as devices of Satan to tempt them from the  narrow Path. Such an affliction as \"nerves\" was not readily  acknowledged, and anyone subject to fits or nervous disorders, or any  child irritable or tempestuous might easily be the victim of witchcraft.  Note what Increase Mather has to say on the matter when explaining the  case of the children of John Goodwin of Boston: \"...In the day time  they were handled with so many sorts of Ails, that it would require of  us almost as much time to Relate them all, as it did of them to Endure  them. Sometimes they would be Deaf, sometimes Dumb, and sometimes Blind,  and often, all this at once.... Their necks would be broken, so that  their Neck-bone would seem dissolved unto them that felt after it; and  yet on the sudden, it would become again so stiff that there was no  stirring of their Heads....\"[21]    As we have noted in previous pages, the morbidness and super-sensitive  spiritual condition of the colonists brought on by the peculiar social  environment had for many years prepared the way for just such a tragic"]]]
