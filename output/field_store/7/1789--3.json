When her repressed  memories had rewakened a certain period when she was conscious that she  did not love her husband, her symptoms disappeared, and therewith  disappeared her resistance to the interpretation of the dream.    This conception of repression once fixed, together with the distortion  of the dream in relation to repressed psychical matter, we are in a  position to give a general exposition of the principal results which the  analysis of dreams supplies. We learnt that the most intelligible and  meaningful dreams are unrealized desires; the desires they pictured as  realized are known to consciousness, have been held over from the  daytime, and are of absorbing interest. The analysis of obscure and  intricate dreams discloses something very similar; the dream scene again  pictures as realized some desire which regularly proceeds from the dream  ideas, but the picture is unrecognizable, and is only cleared up in the  analysis. The desire itself is either one repressed, foreign to  consciousness, or it is closely bound up with repressed ideas. The  formula for these dreams may be thus stated: _They are concealed  realizations of repressed desires_. It is interesting to note that they  are right who regard the dream as foretelling the future. Although the  future which the dream shows us is not that which will occur, but that  which we would like to occur. Folk psychology proceeds here according to  its wont; it believes what it wishes to believe.    Dreams can be divided into three classes according to their relation  towards the realization of desire. Firstly come those which exhibit a  _non-repressed, non-concealed desire_; these are dreams of the infantile  type, becoming ever rarer among adults. Secondly, dreams which express  in _veiled_ form some _repressed desire_; these constitute by far the  larger number of our dreams, and they require analysis for their  understanding. Thirdly, these dreams where repression exists, but  _without_ or with but slight concealment. These dreams are invariably  accompanied by a feeling of dread which brings the dream to an end. This  feeling of dread here replaces dream displacement; I regarded the dream  work as having prevented this in the dream of the second class. It is  not very difficult to prove that what is now present as intense dread in  the dream was once desire, and is now secondary to the repression.    There are also definite dreams with a painful content, without the  presence of any anxiety in the dream. These cannot be reckoned among  dreams of dread; they have, however, always been used to prove the  unimportance and the psychical futility of dreams. An analysis of such  an example will show that it belongs to our second class of dreams--a  _perfectly concealed_ realization of repressed desires. Analysis will  demonstrate at the same time how excellently adapted is the work of  displacement to the concealment of desires.    A girl dreamt that she saw lying dead before her the only surviving  child of her sister amid the same surroundings as a few years before she  saw the first child lying dead. She was not sensible of any pain, but  naturally combatted the view that the scene represented a desire of  hers. Nor was that view necessary. Years ago it was at the funeral of  the child that she had last seen and spoken to the man she loved. Were  the second child to die, she would be sure to meet this man again in her  sister's house. She is longing to meet him, but struggles against this  feeling. The day of the dream she had taken a ticket for a lecture,  which announced the presence of the man she always loved. The dream is  simply a dream of impatience common to those which happen before a  journey, theater, or simply anticipated pleasures. The longing is  concealed by the shifting of the scene to the occasion when any joyous  feeling were out of place, and yet where it did once exist. Note,  further, that the emotional behavior in the dream is adapted, not to the  displaced, but to the real but suppressed dream ideas. The scene  anticipates the long-hoped-for meeting; there is here no call for  painful emotions.    There has hitherto been no occasion for philosophers to bestir  themselves with a psychology of repression. We must be allowed to  construct some clear conception as to the origin of dreams as the first  steps in this unknown territory. The scheme which we have formulated not  only from a study of dreams is, it is true, already somewhat  complicated, but we cannot find any simpler one that will suffice. We  hold that our psychical apparatus contains two procedures for the  construction of thoughts. The second one has the advantage that its  products find an open path to consciousness, whilst the activity of the  first procedure is unknown to itself, and can only arrive at  consciousness through the second one. At the borderland of these two  procedures, where the first passes over into the second, a censorship  is established which only passes what pleases it, keeping back  everything else. That which is rejected by the censorship is, according  to our definition, in a state of repression. Under certain conditions,  one of which is the sleeping state, the balance of power between the two  procedures is so changed that what is repressed can no longer be kept  back. In the sleeping state this may possibly occur through the  negligence of the censor; what has been hitherto repressed will now  succeed in finding its way to consciousness. But as the censorship is  never absent, but merely off guard, certain alterations must be conceded  so as to placate it. It is a compromise which becomes conscious in this  case--a compromise between what one procedure has in view and the  demands of the other. _Repression, laxity of the censor,  compromise_--this is the foundation for the origin of many another  psychological process, just as it is for the dream. In such compromises  we can observe the processes of condensation, of displacement, the  acceptance of superficial associations, which we have found in the dream  work.    It is not for us to deny the demonic element which has played a part in  constructing our explanation of dream work. The impression left is that  the formation of obscure dreams proceeds as if a person had something  to say which must be agreeable for another person upon whom he is  dependent to hear. It is by the use of this image that we figure to  ourselves the conception of the _dream distortion_ and of the  censorship, and ventured to crystallize our impression in a rather  crude, but at least definite, psychological theory. Whatever explanation  the future may offer of these first and second procedures, we shall  expect a confirmation of our correlate that the second procedure  commands the entrance to consciousness, and can exclude the first from  consciousness.    Once the sleeping state overcome, the censorship resumes complete sway,  and is now able to revoke that which was granted in a moment of  weakness. That the _forgetting_ of dreams explains this in part, at  least, we are convinced by our experience, confirmed again and again.  During the relation of a dream, or during analysis of one, it not  infrequently happens that some fragment of the dream is suddenly  forgotten. This fragment so forgotten invariably contains the best and  readiest approach to an understanding of the dream. Probably that is why  it sinks into oblivion--_i.e._, into a renewed suppression.    Viewing the dream content as the representation of a realized desire,  and referring its vagueness to the changes made by the censor in the  repressed matter, it is no longer difficult to grasp the function of  dreams. In fundamental contrast with those saws which assume that sleep  is disturbed by dreams, we hold the _dream as the guardian of sleep_. So  far as children's dreams are concerned, our view should find ready  acceptance.    The sleeping state or the psychical change to sleep, whatsoever it be,  is brought about by the child being sent to sleep or compelled thereto  by fatigue, only assisted by the removal of all stimuli which might open  other objects to the psychical apparatus. The means which serve to keep  external stimuli distant are known; but what are the means we can employ  to depress the internal psychical stimuli which frustrate sleep? Look at  a mother getting her child to sleep. The child is full of beseeching; he  wants another kiss; he wants to play yet awhile. His requirements are in  part met, in part drastically put off till the following day. Clearly  these desires and needs, which agitate him, are hindrances to sleep.  Every one knows the charming story of the bad boy (Baldwin Groller's)  who awoke at night bellowing out, \"_I want the rhinoceros_.\" A really  good boy, instead of bellowing, would have _dreamt_ that he was playing  with the rhinoceros. Because the dream which realizes his desire is  believed during sleep, it removes the desire and makes sleep possible.  It cannot be denied that this belief accords with the dream image,  because it is arrayed in the psychical appearance of probability; the  child is without the capacity which it will acquire later to distinguish  hallucinations or phantasies from reality.    The adult has learnt this differentiation; he has also learnt the  futility of desire, and by continuous practice manages to postpone his  aspirations, until they can be granted in some roundabout method by a  change in the external world. For this reason it is rare for him to have  his wishes realized during sleep in the short psychical way. It is even  possible that this never happens, and that everything which appears to  us like a child's dream demands a much more elaborate explanation."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1549"],[0,"Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians (#10)"],[1,"me anything. What could they possibly teach me since Christ by  His revelation had taught me all things? It was but a conference, and  no disputation. I learned nothing, neither did I defend my cause. I only  stated what I had done, that I had preached to the Gentiles faith in  Christ, without the Law, and that in response to my preaching the Holy  Ghost came down upon the Gentiles. When the apostles heard this, they  were glad that I had taught the truth.\"    If Paul would not give in to the false apostles, much less ought we to  give in to our opponents. I know that a Christian should be humble, but  against the Pope I am going to be proud and say to him: \"You, Pope,  I will not have you for my boss, for I am sure that my doctrine is  divine.\" Such pride against the Pope is imperative, for if we are not  stout and proud we shall never succeed in defending the article of the  righteousness of faith.    If the Pope would concede that God alone by His grace through Christ  justifies sinners, we would carry him in our arms, we would kiss his  feet. But since we cannot obtain this concession, we will give in to  nobody, not to all the angels in heaven, not to Peter, not to Paul, not  to a hundred emperors, not to a thousand popes, not to the whole world.  If in this matter we were to humble ourselves, they would take from  us the God who created us, and Jesus Christ who has redeemed us by His  blood. Let this be our resolution, that we will suffer the loss of all  things, the loss of our good name, of life itself, but the Gospel and  our faith in Jesus Christ--we will not stand for it that anybody take  them from us.        VERSES 7, 8. But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the    uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision    was unto Peter; [For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the    apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the    Gentiles.]    Here the Apostle claims for himself the same authority which the false  apostles attributed to the true apostles. Paul simply inverts their  argument. \"To bolster their evil cause,\" says he, \"the false apostles  quote the authority of the great apostles against me. I can quote the  same authority against them, for the apostles are on my side. They  gave me the right hand of fellowship. They approved my ministry. O my  Galatians, do not believe the counterfeit apostles!\"    What does Paul mean by saying that the gospel of the uncircumcision was  committed unto him, and that of the circumcision to Peter? Did not Paul  preach to the Jews, while Peter preached to the Gentiles also? Peter  converted the Centurion. Paul's custom was to enter into the synagogues  of the Jews, there to preach the Gospel. Why then should he call himself  the apostle of the Gentiles, while he calls Peter the apostle of the  circumcision?    Paul refers to the fact that the other apostles remained in Jerusalem  until the destruction of the city became imminent. But Paul was  especially called the apostle of the Gentiles. Even before the  destruction of Jerusalem Jews dwelt here and there in the cities of the  Gentiles. Coming to a city, Paul customarily entered the synagogues of  the Jews and first brought to them as the children of the kingdom, the  glad tidings that the promises made unto the fathers were fulfilled in  Jesus Christ. When the Jews refused to hear these glad tidings, Paul  turned to the Gentiles. He was the apostle of the Gentiles in a special  sense, as Peter was the apostle of the Jews.    Paul reiterates that Peter, James, and John, the accepted pillars of the  Church, taught him nothing, nor did they commit unto him the office of  preaching the Gospel unto the Gentiles. Both the knowledge of the Gospel  and the commandment to preach it to the Gentiles, Paul received directly  from God. His case was parallel to that of Peter's, who was particularly  commissioned to preach the Gospel to the Jews.    The apostles had the same charge, the identical Gospel. Peter did not  proclaim a different Gospel, nor had he appointed his fellow apostles.  They were equals. They were all taught of God. None was greater than the  other, none could point to prerogatives above the other. To justify his  usurped primacy in the Church the Pope claims that Peter was the chief  of the apostles. This is an impudent falsehood.        VERSE 8. For he that wrought effectually in Peter.    With these words Paul refutes another argument of the false apostles.  \"What reason have the false apostles to boast that the Gospel of Peter  was mighty, that he converted many, that he wrought great miracles, and  that his very shadow healed the sick? These reports are true enough. But  where did Peter acquire this power? God gave him the power. I have the  same power. I received my power, not from Peter, but from the same God,  the same Spirit who was mighty in Peter was mighty in me also.\" Luke  corroborates Paul's statement in the words: \"And God wrought special  miracles by the hands of Paul, so that from his body were brought unto  the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them,  and the evil spirits went out of them.\" (Acts 19:11, 12.)    To conclude, Paul is not going to be inferior to the rest of the  apostles. Some secular writers put Paul's boasting down as carnal pride.  But Paul had no personal interest in his boasting. It was with him a  matter of faith and doctrine. The controversy was not about the glory  of Paul, but the glory of God, the Word of God, the true worship of God,  true religion, and the righteousness of faith.        VERSE 9. And when James, Cephas and John, who seemed to be pillars,    perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and    Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the    heathen, and they unto the circumcision.    \"The fact is, when the apostles heard that I had received the charge to  preach the Gospel to the Gentiles from Christ; when they heard that God  had wrought many miracles through me; that great numbers of the Gentiles  had come to the knowledge of Christ through my ministry; when they  heard that the Gentiles had received the Holy Ghost without Law and  circumcision, by the simple preaching of faith; when they heard all this  they glorified God for His grace in me.\" Hence, Paul was justified in  concluding that the apostles were for him, and not against him.        VERSE 9. The right hands of fellowship.    As if the apostles had said to him: \"We, Paul, do agree with you in all  things. We are companions in doctrine. We have the same Gospel with this  difference, that to you is committed the Gospel for the uncircumcised,  while the Gospel for the circumcision is committed unto us. But this  difference ought not to hinder our friendship, since we preach one and  the same Gospel.\"        VERSE 10. Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same    which I also was forward to do.    Next to the preaching of the Gospel, a true and faithful pastor will  take care of the poor. Where the Church is, there must be the poor,  for the world and the devil persecute the Church and impoverish many  faithful Christians.    Speaking of money, nobody wants to contribute nowadays to the  maintenance of the ministry, and the erection of schools. When it comes  to establishing false worship and idolatry, no cost is spared. True  religion is ever in need of money, while false religions are backed by  wealth.        VERSE 11. But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the    face, because he was to be blamed.    Paul goes on in his refutation of the false apostles by saying that in  Antioch he withstood Peter in the presence of the whole congregation.  As he stated before, Paul had no small matter in hand, but the chief  article of the Christian religion. When this article is endangered, we  must not hesitate to resist Peter, or an angel from heaven. Paul paid no  regard to the dignity and position of Peter, when he saw this article in  danger. It is written: \"He that loveth father or mother or his own life,  more than me, is not worthy of me.\" (Matt. 10:37.)    For defending the truth in our day, we are called proud and obstinate  hypocrites. We are not ashamed of these titles. The cause we are called  to defend, is not Peter's cause, or the cause of our parents, or that of  the government, or that of the world, but the cause of God. In defense  of that cause we must be firm and unyielding.    When he says, \"to his face,\" Paul accuses the false apostles of  slandering him behind his back. In his presence they dared not to open  their mouths. He tells them, \"I did not speak evil of Peter behind his  back, but I withstood him frankly and openly.\"    Others may debate here whether an apostle might sin. I claim that we  ought not to make Peter out as faultless. Prophets have erred. Nathan  told David that he should go ahead and build the Temple of the Lord. But  his prophecy was afterwards corrected by the Lord. The apostles erred  in thinking of the Kingdom of Christ as a worldly state. Peter had heard  the command of Christ, \"Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel  to every creature.\" But if it had not been for the heavenly vision and  the special command of Christ, Peter would never have gone to the home  of Cornelius. Peter also erred in this matter of circumcision. If Paul  had not publicly censured him, all the believing Gentiles would have  been compelled to receive circumcision and accept the Jewish law. We are  not to attribute perfection to any man.    Luke reports \"that the contention between Paul and Barnabas was so  sharp that they departed asunder one from the other.\" The cause of their  disagreement could hardly have been small since it separated these  two, who had been joined together for years in a holy partnership. Such  incidents are recorded for our consolation. After all, it is a comfort  to know that"]]]
