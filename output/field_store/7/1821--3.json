The depth of this pit being  then unknown, Wilkins, to ascertain it, got a rope of 45 feet long,  and fastening this identical lamp to the end of it, lowered it into  the pit, in the doing of which, the string caught on fire, and down  fell the lamp. Wilkins made an offer of two dollars to any one of the  miners who would descend the pit and bring up the lamp. His offer was  accepted by a man, who, in consequence of his diminutive stature, was  nicknamed Little Dave; and the rope being made fast about his waist,  he, torch in hand, was lowered to the full extent of the forty-five  feet. Being then drawn up, the poor fellow was found to be so  excessively alarmed, that he could scarcely articulate; but having  recovered from his fright, and again with the full power of utterance,  he declared that no money could tempt him to try again for the lamp;  and in excuse for such a determination, he related the most marvellous  story of what he had seen--far exceeding the wonderful things which  the unexampled Don Quixote de la Mancha declared he had seen in the  deep cave of Montesinos. Dave was, in fact, suspended at the height of  two hundred and forty feet above the level below. Such is the history  of the _lamp_, as told by the old miner, Holton, the correctness of  which was very soon verified; for guides having been sent to the place  where the lamp was found, and persons at the same time stationed at  the mouth of the crevice pit, their proximity was at once made  manifest by the very audible sound of each other's voices, and by the  fact that sticks thrown into the pit fell at the feet of the guides  below, and were brought out by them. The distance from the mouth of  the Cave to this pit, falls short of half a mile; yet to reach the  grand apartment immediately under it, requires a circuit to be made of  at least three miles. The illumination of that portion of the Great  Dome on the left, and of the hall on the top of the hill to the right,  as seen from the platform, was unquestionably one of the most  impressive spectacles we had witnessed; but to be seen to advantage,  another position ought to be taken by the spectator, and the dome with  its towering height, and the hall on the summit of the hill, with its  gigantic stalagmite columns, and ceiling two hundred feet high,  illuminated by the simultaneous ignition of a number of Bengal lights,  judiciously arranged. Such was the enthusiastic admiration of some  foreigners on witnessing an illumination of the Great Dome and Hall,  that they declared, it alone would compensate for a voyage across the  Atlantic. With the partial illumination of the Great Dome, we closed  our explorations on this side of the rivers, and retracing our steps,  reached the hotel about sun-set. At mid-night, the party which  separated from us at the entrance of Pensico Avenue, returned from the  points beyond the Echo river.          CHAPTER IX.    Third Visit--River Hall--Dead Sea--River Styx--Lethe--Echo River--  Purgatory--Eyeless Fish--Supposed Boil of the Rivers--Sources and  Outlet Unknown.      Early the next morning, having made all the necessary preparations for  the grand tour, which we were the more anxious to take from the  glowing accounts of the party recently returned, we entered the cave  immediately after an early breakfast, and proceeded rapidly on to  River Hall. It was evident from the appearance of the flood here, that  it had been recently overflown.    [Illustration: RIVER SCENE.  On Stone by T. Campbell  Bauer & Teschemacher's Lith.]    \"The cave, or the River Hall,\" remarks a fair and distinguished  authoress, whose description of the river scenery is so graphic, that  I cannot do better than transcribe it throughout: \"The River Hall  descends like the slope of a mountain; the ceiling stretches  away--away before you, vast and grand as the firmament at midnight.\"  Going on, and gradually ascending and keeping close to the right hand  wall, you observe on your left \"a steep precipice, over which you can  look down by the aid of blazing missiles, upon a broad black sheet of  water, eighty feet below, called the Dead Sea. This is an awfully  impressive place; the sights and sounds of which, do not easily pass  from memory. He who has seen it, will have it vividly brought before  him, by Alfieri's description of Filippo, 'only a transient word or  act gives us a short and dubious glimmer, that reveals to us the  abysses of his being--dark, lurid and terrific, as the throat of the  infernal pool.' Descending from the eminence, by a ladder of about  twenty feet, we find ourselves among piles of gigantic rocks, and one  of the most picturesque sights in the world, is to see a file of men  and women passing along those wild and scraggy paths, moving  slowly--slowly, that their lamps may have time to illuminate their  sky-like ceiling and gigantic walls--disappearing behind high  cliffs--sinking into ravines--their lights shining upwards through  fissures in the rocks--then suddenly emerging from some abrupt angle,  standing in the bright gleam of their lamps, relieved by the towering  black masses around them. He, who could paint the infinite variety of  creation, can alone give an adequate idea of this marvellous region.  As you pass along, you hear the roar of invisible waterfalls; and at  the foot of the slope, the river Styx lies before you, deep and black,  overarched with rock. The first glimpse of it brings to mind, the  descent of Ulysses into hell,      \"Where the dark rock o'erhangs the infernal lake,    And mingling streams eternal murmurs make.\"    Across (or rather down) these unearthly waters, the guide can convey  but four passengers at once. The lamps are fastened to the prow; the  images of which, are reflected in the dismal pool. If you are  impatient of delay, or eager for new adventures, you can leave your  companions lingering about the shore, and cross the Styx by a  dangerous bridge of precipices overhead. In order to do this, you must  ascend a steep cliff, and enter a cave above, 300 yards long, from an  egress of which, you find yourself on the bank of the river, eighty  feet above its surface, commanding a view of those in the boat, and  those waiting on the shore. Seen from this height, the lamps in the  canoe glare like fiery eye-balls; and the passengers, sitting there so  hushed and motionless, look like shadows. The scene is so strangely  funereal and spectral, that it seems as if the Greeks must have  witnessed it, before they imagined Charon conveying ghosts to the dim  regions of Pluto. Your companions thus seen, do indeed--      \"Skim along the dusky glades,    Thin airy souls, and visionary shades.\"    If you turn your eyes from the canoe to the parties of men and women  whom you left waiting on the shore, you will see them by the gleam of  their lamps, scattered in picturesque groups, looming out in bold  relief from the dense darkness around them.    Having passed the Styx, (much the smallest of the rivers,) you walk  over a pile of large rocks, and are on the banks of Lethe; and looking  back, you will see a line of men and women descending the high hill  from the cave, which runs _over_ the river Styx. Here are two boats,  and the parties, which have come by the two routes, _down_ the Styx or  _over_ it, uniting, descend the Lethe about a quarter of a mile, the  ceiling for the entire distance being very high--certainly not less  than fifty feet. On landing, you enter a level and lofty hall, called  the Great Walk, which stretches to the banks of the Echo, a distance  of three or four hundred yards. The Echo is truly a river: it is wide  and deep enough, at all times, to float the largest steamer. At the  point of embarkation, the arch is very low, not more than three feet,  in an ordinary stage of water, being left for a boat to pass through.  Passengers, of course, are obliged to double up, and lie upon each  others shoulders, in a most uncomfortable way, but their suffering is  of short duration; in two boat lengths, they emerge to where the vault  of the cave is lofty and wide. The boat in which we embarked was  sufficiently large to carry twelve persons, and our voyage down the  river was one of deep, indeed of most intense interest. The novelty,  the grandeur, the magnificence of every thing around elicited  unbounded admiration and wonder. All sense of danger, (had any been  experienced before,) was lost in the solemn, quiet sublimity of the  scene. The rippling of the water caused by the motion of our boat is  heard afar off, beating under the low arches and in the cavities of  the rocks. The report of a pistol is as that of the heaviest  artillery, and long and afar does the echo resound, like the muttering  of distant thunder. The voice of song was raised on this dark, deep  water, and the sound was as that of the most powerful choir. A fall  band of music on this river of echoes would indeed be overpowering.  The aquatic excursion was more to our taste than any thing we had  seen, and never can the impression it made be obliterated from our  memories.    The Echo is three quarters of a mile long. A rise of the water of  merely a few feet connects the three rivers. After long and heavy  rains, these rivers sometimes rise to a perpendicular height of more  than fifty feet; and then they, as well as the cataracts, exhibit a  most terrific appearance. The low arch at the entrance of the Echo,  can not be passed when there is a rise of water of even two feet. Once  or twice parties have been caught on the further side by a sudden  rise, and for a time their alarm was great, not knowing that there was  an upper cave through which they could pass, that would lead them  around the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16224"],[0,"A Bibliographical, Antiquarian and Picturesque Tour in France and Germany, (#10)"],[1,"treading upon hallowed ground, rendered if possible more  sacred by the ashes of the illustrious dead, let us move gently onwards  towards the _Chapel of the Virgin_, behind the choir. See, what bold and  brilliant monumental figures are yonder, to the right of the altar! How  gracefully they kneel and how devoutly they pray! They are the figures of  the CARDINALS D'AMBOISE--uncle and nephew:--the former, minister of Louis  XII.[46] and (what does not necessarily follow, but what gives him as high  a claim upon the gratitude of posterity) the restorer and beautifier of the  glorious building in which you are contemplating his figure. This splendid  monument is entirely of black and white marble, of the early part of the  sixteenth century. The figures just mentioned are of white marble, kneeling  upon cushions, beneath a rich canopy of Gothic fretwork. They are in their  professional robes; their heads are bare, exhibiting the tonsure, with the  hair in one large curl behind. A small whole-length figure of _St. George_,  their tutelary saint, is below them, in gilded marble: and the whole base,  or lower frieze, of the monument, is surrounded by six delicately  sculptured females, about three feet high, emblematic of the virtues for  which these cardinals were so eminently distinguished. These figures,  representing Faith, Charity, Prudence, Force, Justice, and Temperance, are  flanked by eight smaller ones, placed in carved niches; while, above them,  are the twelve Apostles, not less beautifully executed.[47]    On gazing at this splendid monument of ancient piety and liberality--and  with one's mind deeply intent upon the characters of the deceased--let us  fancy we hear the sound of the GREAT BELL from the south-west tower ...  called the _Amboise Tower_ ... erected, both the bell and the tower, by the  uncle and minister AMBOISE. Know, my dear friend, that there was _once_ a  bell, (and the largest in Europe, save one) which used to send forth its  sound, for three successive centuries, from the said tower. This bell was  broken about thirty years ago, and destroyed in the ravages of the  immediately succeeding years.[48] The south-west tower remains, and the  upper part of the central tower, with the whole of the lofty wooden  spire:--the fruits of the liberality of the excellent men of whom such  honourable mention has been made. Considering that this spire is very  lofty, and composed of wood, _it is surprising that it has not been  destroyed by tempest, or by lightning_.[49] The taste of it is rather  capricious than beautiful.    I have not yet done with the monuments, or rather have only commenced the  account of them.[50] Examine yonder recumbent figure, to the left of the  altar, opposite the splendid monument upon which I have just been dilating.  It is lying upon its back, with a ghastly expression of countenance,  representing the moment when the last breath has escaped from the body. It  is the figure of the Grand SENESCHAL DE BREZE,[51]--Governor of Rouen, and  husband of the celebrated DIANE DE POICTIERS--that thus claims our  attention. This figure is quite naked, lying upon its back, with the right  hand placed on the stomach, but in an action which indicates _life_--and  therefore it is in bad taste, as far as truth is concerned; for the head  being fallen back, much shrunken, and with a ghastly expression of  countenance--indicating that some time has elapsed since it breathed its  last--the hand could not rest in this position. The cenotaph is of black  marble, disfigured by the names of idle visitors who choose to leave such  impertinent memorials behind. The famous GOUJON is supposed to be the  sculptor of the figure, which is painfully clever, but it strikes me as  being too small. At any rate, the arms and body seem to be too strong and  fleshy for the shrunken and death-stricken expression of the countenance.  Above the Seneschal, thus prostrate and lifeless, there is another and a  very clever representation of him, on a smaller scale, on horseback.    On each side of this figure (which has not escaped serious injury) are two  females in white marble; one representing the VIRGIN, and the other DIANE  DE POICTIERS:[52] they are little more than half the size of life. The  whole is in the very best style of the sculpture of the time of Francis I.  These precious specimens of art, as well as several other similar remains,  were carried away during the revolution, to a place of safety. The choir is  spacious, and well adapted to its purposes; but who does not grieve to see  the Archbishop's stall, once the most curious and costly, of the Gothic  order, and executed at the end of the XVth century, transformed into a  stately common-place canopy, supported by columns of chestnut-wood carved  in the Grecian style? The LIBRARY, which used to terminate the north  transept, is--not gone--but transferred. A fanciful stair-case, with an  appropriate inscription,[53] yet attest that it was formerly an appendage  to that part of the edifice.    Before I quit the subject of the cathedral, I must not fail to tell you  something relating to the rites performed therein. Let us quit therefore  the dead for the living. Of course we saw, here, a repetition of the  ceremonies observed at Dieppe; but previously to the feast of the  _Ascension_ we were also present at the confirmation of three hundred boys  and three hundred girls, each very neatly and appropriately dressed, in a  sort of sabbath attire, and each holding a lighted wax taper in the hand.  The girls were dressed in white, with white veils; and the rich lent veils  to those who had not the means of purchasing them. The cathedral,  especially about the choir, was crowded to excess. I hired a chair, stood  up, and gazed as earnestly as the rest. The interest excited among the  parents, and especially the mothers, was very striking. \"Voila la  petite--qu'elle a l'air charmant!--le petit ange!\"....A stir is made ...  they rise... and approach, in the most measured order, the rails of the  choir ... There they deposit their tapers. The priests, very numerous,  extinguish them as dexterously as they can; and the whole cathedral is  perfumed with the mixed scent of the wax and frankincense. The boys, on  approaching the altar, and giving up their tapers, kneel down; then shut  their eyes, open their mouths; and the priests deposit the consecrated  wafer upon their tongues. The procession now took a different direction.  They all went into the nave, where a sermon was preached to the young  people, expressly upon the occasion, by a Monsieur Quillebeuf, a canon of  the cathedral, and a preacher of considerable popularity. He had one of the  most meagre and forbidding physiognomies I ever beheld, and his beard was  black and unshaven. But he preached well; fluently, and even eloquently:  making a very singular, but not ungraceful, use of his left arm--and  displaying at times rather a happy familiarity of manner, wholly exempt  from vulgarity, and well suited to the capacities and feelings of his  youthful audience. His subject was \"belief in Christ Jesus;\" on which he  gave very excellent proofs and evidences. His voice was thin, but clear,  and distinctly heard.    And now, my dear Friend, if you are not tired with this detour of the  CATHEDRAL, suppose we take a promenade to the next most important  ecclesiastical edifice in the city of Rouen. What say you therefore to a  stroll to the ABBEY of ST. OUEN? \"Willingly,\" methinks I hear you reply. To  the abbey therefore let us go.    Leaving the Cathedral, you pass a beautifully sculptured fountain (of the  early time of Francis I.) which stands at the corner of a street, to the  right; and which, from its central situation, is visited the live-long day  for the sake of its limpid waters. Push on a little further; then, turning  to the right, you get into a sort of square, and observe the ABBEY--or  rather the _west-front_ of it, full in face of you. You gaze, and are first  struck with its matchless window: call it rose, or marygold, as you please.  I think, for delicacy and richness of ornament, this window is perfectly  unrivalled. There is a play of line in the mullions, which, considering  their size and strength, may be pronounced quite a master-piece of art. You  approach, regretting the neglected state of the lateral towers, and enter,  through the large and completely-opened centre doors, the nave of the  Abbey. It was towards sun-set when we made our first entrance. The evening  was beautiful; and the variegated tints of sun-beam, admitted through the  stained glass of the window, just noticed, were perfectly enchanting. The  window itself, as you look upwards, or rather as you fix your eye upon the  centre of it, from the remote end of the Abbey, or the _Lady's Chapel_, was  a perfect blaze of dazzling light: and nave, choir, and side aisles, seemed  magically illumined ...      Seemed all on fire--within, around;    Deep sacristy and altar's pale;    Shone every pillar foliage-bound....      _Lay of the Last Minstrel_.    We declared instinctively that the ABBEY OF ST. OUEN could hardly have a  rival;--certainly not a superior.    [Illustration]    As the evening came on, the gloom of almost every side chapel and recess  was rendered doubly impressive by the devotion of numerous straggling  supplicants; and invocations to the presiding spirit of the place, reached  the ears and touched the hearts of the bystanders. The grand western  entrance presents you with the most perfect view of the choir--a magical  circle, or rather oval--flanked by lofty and clustered pillars, and free  from the surrounding obstruction of screens, &c. Nothing more airy and more  captivating of the kind can be imagined. The finish and delicacy of these  pillars are quite surprising. Above, below, around--every thing is in the  purest style of the XIVth and XVth centuries. The central tower is a tower  of"]]]
