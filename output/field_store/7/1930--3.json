Dalgard  watched it impatiently. Unless it would move, allow him a chance to  aim at the soft underparts, there was little chance of killing it.    What followed startled both hunters, versed as they were in the usual  mechanics of killing snake-devils. It had been an accepted premise,  through the years since the colonists had known of the monsters, that  the creatures were relatively brainless, mere machines which fought,  ate, and killed, incapable of any intelligent reasoning, and therefore  only dangerous when one was surprised by them or when the hunter was  forced to face them inadequately armed.    This snake-devil was different, as it became increasingly plain to the  two behind the grille. It had remained safe during the slaughter of  its companions because it had not moved, almost as if it had wit  enough _not_ to move. And now, when it did change position, its  maneuvers, simple as they were, underlined the fact that this one  creature appeared to have thought out a solution to its situation--as  rational a solution as Dalgard might have produced had it been his  problem.    Still keeping its soft underparts covered, it edged about in the sand  until its back, with the impenetrable armor plates, was facing the  grille behind which the hunters stood. Retracting its neck between its  shoulders and hunching its powerful back limbs under it, it rushed  from that point of danger straight for one of the archways.    Dalgard sent an arrow after it. Only to see the shaft scrape along the  heavy scales and bounce to the sand. Then the snake-devil was gone.    \"Banded--\" The word reached Dalgard. Sssuri had been cool enough to  note that while the human hunter had been only bewildered by the  untypical actions of his quarry.    \"It must be intelligent.\" The scout's statement was more than half  protest.    \"Where _they_ are concerned, one may expect many evil wonders.\"    \"We've got to get that devil!\" Dalgard was determined on that. Though  to run down, through this maze of deserted city, an enraged  snake-devil--above all, a snake-devil which appeared to have some  reasoning powers--was not a prospect to arouse any emotion except grim  devotion to duty.    \"It goes for help.\"    Dalgard, startled, stared at his companion. Sssuri was still by the  grille, watching that archway through which the devil had disappeared.    \"What kind of help?\" For a moment Dalgard pictured the monster  returning at the head of a regiment of its kind, able to tear out this  grille and get at their soft-fleshed enemies behind it.    \"Safety--protection,\" Sssuri told him. \"And I think that the place to  which it now flees is one we should know.\"    \"Those Others?\" The sun had not clouded, it still streamed down in the  torrid heat of early afternoon, warm on their heads and shoulders. Yet  Dalgard felt as chill as if some autumn wind had laid its lash across  the small of his back.    \"_They_ are not here. But they have been--and it is possible that they  return. The devil goes to where it expects to find them.\"    Sssuri was already on his way, running about the arena's curve to  reach the point above the archway through which the snake-devil had  raced. Dalgard padded after him, bow in hand. He trusted Sssuri  implicitly when it came to tracking. If the merman said that the  snake-devil had a definite goal in view, he was right. But the scout  was still a little bemused by a monster who was able to have any goal  except the hunting and devouring of meat. Either the one who fled was  a freak among its kind or--There were several possibilities which  could answer that \"or,\" and none of them were very pleasant to  consider.    They reached the section above the archway and climbed the tiers of  seat benches to the top of the wall. Only to see no exit below them.  In fact nothing but a wide sweep of crushed brown tangle which had  once been vegetation. It was apparent that there was no door below.    Sssuri sped down again. He climbed the grille and was on his way to  the sand when Dalgard caught up with him. Together they ventured into  the underground passage which the snake-devil had chosen.    The stench of the lair was thick about them. Dalgard coughed, sickened  by the foul odor. He was reluctant to advance. But, to his growing  relief, he discovered that it was not entirely dark. Set in the roof  at intervals were plates which gave out a violet light, making a dim  twilight which was better than total darkness.    It was a straight passage without any turns or openings. But the  horrible odor was constant, and Dalgard began to think that they might  be running head-on into another lair, perhaps one as well populated as  that they had left behind them. It was against nature for the  snake-devils he had known to lair under cover; they preferred narrow  rocky places where they could bask in the sun. But then the devil they  now pursued was no ordinary one.    Sssuri reassured him. \"There is no lair, only the smell because they  have come this way for many years.\"    The passage opened into a wide room and here the violet light was  stronger, bright enough to make plain the fact that alcoves opened off  it, each and every one with a barred grille for a door. There was no  mistaking that once this had been a prison of sorts.    Sssuri did no exploring but crossed the room at his shuffling trot,  which Dalgard matched. The way leading out on the opposite side  slanted up, and he judged it might bring them out at ground level.    \"The devil waits,\" Sssuri warned, \"because it fears. It will turn on  us when we come. Be ready--\"    They were at another door, and before them was a long corridor with  tall window openings near the ceiling which gave admittance to the  sunlight. After the gloom of the tunnel, Dalgard blinked. But he was  aware of movement at the far end, just as he heard the hissing scream  of the monster they trailed.          6    TREASURE HUNT      Raf, squatting on a small, padded platform raised some six inches from  the floor, tried to study the inhabitants of the room without staring  offensively. At the first glance, in spite of their strange clothing  and their odd habit of painting their faces with weird designs, the  city people might have been of his own species. Until one saw their  too slender hands with the three equal-length fingers and thumb, or  caught a glimpse, under the elaborate head coverings, of the stiff,  spiky substance which served them for hair.    At least they did not appear to be antagonistic. When they had reached  the roof top where the Terrans had landed their flitter, they had come  with empty hands, making gestures of good will and welcome. And they  had had no difficulty in persuading at least three of the exploring  party to accompany them to their own quarters, though Raf had been  separated from the flyer only by the direct order of Captain Hobart,  an order he still resented and wanted to disobey.    The Terrans had been offered refreshment--food and drink. But knowing  the first rule of stellar exploration, they had refused, which did not  mean that the hosts must abstain. In fact, Raf thought, watching the  aliens about him, they ate as if such a feast were novel. His two  neighbors had quickly divided his portion between them and made it  disappear as fast, if not faster, than their own small servings.    At the other end of the room Lablet and Hobart were trying to  communicate with the nobles about them, while Soriki, a small palm  recorder in his hand, was making a tape strip of the proceedings.    Raf glanced from one of his neighbors to the other. The one on his  right had chosen to wear a sight-torturing shade of crimson, and the  material was wound in strips about his body as if he were engulfed in  an endless bandage. Only his fluttering hands, his three-toed feet and  his head were free of the supple rolls. Having selected red for his  clothing, he had picked a brilliant yellow paint for his facial  makeup, and it was difficult for the uninitiated to trace what must be  his normal features under that thick coating of stuff which fashioned  a masklike strip across his eyes and a series of circles outlining his  mouth, circles which almost completely covered his beardless cheeks.  More twists of woven fabric, opalescent and changing color as his head  moved, made a turban for his head.    Most of the aliens about the room wore some variation of the same  bandage dress, face paint, and turban. An exception, one of three  such, was the feaster on Raf's left.    His face paint was confined to a conservative set of bars on each  cheek, those a stark black and white. His sinewy arms were bare to the  shoulder, and he wore a shell of some metallic substance as a  breast-and back-plate, not unlike the very ancient body armor of Raf's  own world. The rest of his body was covered by the bandage strips, but  they were of a dead black, which, because of the natural thinness of  his limbs, gave him a rather unpleasant resemblance to a spider.  Various sheaths and pockets hung from a belt pulled tight about his  wasp middle, and a helmet of the metal covered his head. Soldier? Raf  was sure that his guess was correct.    The officer, if officer he was, caught Raf's gaze. His small round  mouth gaped, and then his hands, with a few quick movements which Raf  followed, fascinated, pantomimed a flyer in the air. With those  talking fingers, he was able to make plain a question: was Raf the  pilot of the flitter?    The pilot nodded. Then he pointed to the officer and forced as  inquiring an expression as he could command.    The answer was sketched quickly and readably: the alien, too, was  either a pilot or had some authority over flyers. For the first time  since he had entered this building, Raf knew a slight degree of  relaxation.

I won't keep such a woman in the house. Let us put on our  things and go out and have dinner. Better late than never.\"    Letitia was turning over the pages of her book, quite lost to her  surroundings. As I concluded my remarks she looked up and exclaimed,  \"How very funny, Archie. Just as you said 'Better late than never,' I  came across that very phrase in the list of Swedish proverbs. It must be  telepathy, dear. 'Better late than never,' '_Battre sent aen aldrig_.'  What were you saying on the subject, dear? Will you repeat it? And do  try it in Swedish. Say '_Battre sent aen aldrig_.'\"    \"Letitia,\" I shot forth in a fury, \"I'm not in the humor for this sort  of thing. I think this dinner and this woman are rotten. See if you can  find the word rotten in Swedish.\"    \"I am surprised at you,\" Letitia declared glacially, roused from her  book by my heroic though unparliamentary language. \"Your expressions are  neither English nor Swedish. Please don't use such gutter-words before a  servant, to say nothing of your own wife.\"    \"But she doesn't understand,\" I protested, glancing at Miss Lyberg. I  could have sworn that I detected a gleam in the woman's eyes and that  the sphinx-like attitude of dull incomprehensibility suggested a  strenuous effort. \"She doesn't understand anything. She doesn't want to  understand.\"    \"In a week from now,\" said Letitia, \"she will understand everything  perfectly, for I shall be able to talk with her. Oh, Archie, do be  agreeable. Can't you see that I am having great fun? Don't be such a  greedy boy. If you could only enter into the spirit of the thing, you  wouldn't be so oppressed by the food question. Oh, dear! How important  it does seem to be to men. Gerda, _hur gammal aer ni_?\"    The maiden sullenly left the room, and I felt convinced that Letitia had  Swedishly asked her to do so. I was wrong. \"_Hur gammal aer ni_,\" Letitia  explained, simply meant, \"How old are you?\"    \"She evidently didn't want to tell me,\" was my wife's comment, as we  went to the drawing-room. \"I imagine, dear, that she doesn't quite like  the idea of my ferreting out Swedish so persistently. But I intend to  persevere. The worst of conversation books is that one acquires a  language in such a parroty way. Now, in my book, the only answer to the  question 'How old are you?' is, 'I was born on the tenth of August,  1852.' For the life of me, I couldn't vary that, and it would be most  embarrassing. It would make me fifty-two. If any one asked me in Swedish  how old I was, I should _have_ to be fifty-two!\"    \"When I think of my five advertisements,\" I said lugubriously, as I  threw myself into an arm-chair, fatigued at my efforts to discover  dinner, \"when I remember our expectation, and the pleasant anticipations  of to-day, I feel very bitter, Letitia. Just to think that from it all  nothing has resulted but that beastly mummy, that atrocious ossified  thing.\"    \"Archie, Archie!\" said my wife warningly; \"please be calm. Perhaps I was  too engrossed with my studies to note the deficiencies of dinner. But do  remember that I pleaded with her for a Swedish meal. The poor thing did  what I asked her to do. Our dinner was evidently Swedish. It was not her  fault that I asked for it. To-morrow, dear, it shall be different. We  had better stick to the American regime. It is more satisfactory to you.  At any rate, we have somebody in the house, and if our five  advertisements had brought forth five hundred applicants we should only  have kept one. So don't torture yourself, Archie. Try and imagine that  we _had_ five hundred applicants, and that we selected Gerda Lyberg.\"    \"I can't, Letitia,\" I said sulkily, and I heaved a heavy sigh.    \"Come,\" she said soothingly, \"come and study Swedish with me. It will be  most useful for your _Lives of Great Men_. You can read up the Swedes in  the original. I'll entertain you with this book, and you'll forget all  about Mrs. Potz--I mean Gerda Lyberg. By-the-by, Archie, she doesn't  remind me so much of Hedda Gabler. I don't fancy that she is very  subtile.\"    \"You, Letitia,\" I retorted, \"remind me of Mrs. Nickleby. You ramble on  so.\"    Letitia looked offended. She always declared that Dickens \"got on her  nerves.\" She was one of the new-fashioned readers who have learned to  despise Dickens. Personally, I regretted only his nauseating sense of  humor. Letitia placed a cushion behind my head, smoothed my forehead,  kissed me, made her peace, and settled down by my side. Lack of  nourishment made me drowsy, and Letitia's babblings sounded vague and  muffled.    \"It is a most inclusive little book,\" she said, \"and if I can succeed in  memorizing it all I shall be quite at home with the language. In fact,  dear, I think I shall always keep Swedish cooks. Hark at this: 'If the  wind be favorable, we shall be at Gothenburg in forty hours.' '_Om  vinden aer god, sa aero vi pa pyrtio timmar i Goteborg._' I think it is  sweetly pretty. 'You are seasick.' 'Steward, bring me a glass of brandy  and water.' 'We are now entering the harbor.' 'We are now anchoring.'  'Your passports, gentlemen.'\"    A comfortable lethargy was stealing o'er me. Letitia took a pencil and  paper, and made notes as she plied the book. \"A chapter on 'seeing a  town' is most interesting, Archie. Of course, it must be a Swedish town.  'Do you know the two private galleries of Mr. Smith, the merchant, and  Mr. Muller, the chancellor?' 'To-morrow morning I wish to see all the  public buildings and statues.' '_Statyerna_' is Swedish for statues,  Archie. Are you listening, dear? 'We will visit the Church of the Holy  Ghost, at two, then we will make an excursion on Lake Maelan and see the  fortress of Vaxholm.' It _is_ a charming little book. Don't you think  that it is a great improvement on the old Ollendorff system? I don't  find nonsensical sentences like 'The hat of my aunt's sister is blue,  but the nose of my brother-in-law's sister-in-law is red.'\"    I rose and stretched myself. Letitia was still plunged in the  irritating guide to Sweden, where I vowed I would never go. Nothing on  earth should ever induce me to visit Sweden. If it came to a choice  between Hoboken and Stockholm, I mentally determined to select the  former. As I paced the room I heard a curious splashing noise in the  kitchen. Letitia's studies must have dulled her ears. She was evidently  too deeply engrossed.    I strolled nonchalantly into the hall, and proceeded deliberately toward  the kitchen. The thick carpet deadened my footsteps. The splashing noise  grew louder. The kitchen door was closed. I gently opened it. As I did  so a wild scream rent the air. There stood Gerda Lyberg in--in--my pen  declines to write it--a simple unsophisticated birthday dress, taking an  ingenuous reluctant bath in the \"stationary tubs,\" with the plates, and  dishes, and dinner things grouped artistically around her!    The instant she saw me she modestly seized a dish-towel and shouted at  the top of her voice. The kitchen was filled with the steam from the hot  water. 'Venus arising' looked nebulous, and mystic. I beat a hasty  retreat, aghast at the revelation, and almost fell against Letitia, who,  dropping her conversation book, came to see what had happened.    \"She's bathing!\" I gasped, \"in the kitchen--among the plates--near the  soup--\"    \"Never!\" cried Letitia. Then, melodramatically: \"Let me pass. Stand  aside, Archie. I'll go and see. Perhaps--perhaps--you had better come  with me.\"    \"Letitia,\" I gurgled, \"I'm shocked! She has nothing on but a  dish-towel.\"    Letitia paused irresolutely for a second, and going into the kitchen  shut the door. The splashing noise ceased. I heard the sound of voices,  or rather of a voice--Letitia's! Evidently she had forgotten Swedish,  and such remarks as \"If the wind be favorable, we shall be at  Gothenburg in forty hours.\" I listened attentively, and could not even  hear her say \"We will visit the Church of the Holy Ghost at two.\" It is  strange how the stress of circumstances alters the complexion of a  conversation book! All the evening she had studied Swedish, and yet  suddenly confronted by a Swedish lady bathing in our kitchen,  dish-toweled but unashamed, all she could find to say was \"How  disgusting!\" and \"How disgraceful!\" in English!    \"You see,\" said Letitia, when she emerged, \"she is just a simple peasant  girl, and only needs to be told. It is very horrid, of course.\"    \"And unappetizing!\" I chimed in.    \"Of course--certainly unappetizing. I couldn't think of anything Swedish  to say, but I said several things in English. She was dreadfully sorry  that you had seen her, and never contemplated such a possibility. After  all, Archie, bathing is not a crime.\"    \"And we were hunting for a clean slate,\" I suggested satirically. \"Do  you think, Letitia, that she also takes a cold bath in the morning,  among the bacon and eggs, and things?\"    \"That is enough,\" said Letitia sternly. \"The episode need not serve as  an excuse for indelicacy.\"    It was with the advent of Gerda Lyberg that we became absolutely  certain, beyond the peradventure of any doubt, that there was such a  thing as the servant question. The knowledge had been gradually wafted  in upon us, but it was not until the lady from Stockholm had  definitively planted herself in our midst that we admitted to ourselves  openly, unblushingly, that the problem existed. Gerda blazoned forth the  enigma in all its force and defiance.    The remarkable thing about our latest acquisition was the singularly  blank state of her gastronomic mind. There was nothing that she knew.  Most women, and a great many men, intuitively recognize the physical"]]]
