Will ye bar the doors of your houses in My  face? This indeed is naught but a grievous error.          \"O CONCOURSE of patriarchs! He Whom ye were promised...\"      O CONCOURSE of patriarchs! He Whom ye were promised in the Tablets is  come. Fear God, and follow not the vain imaginings of the superstitious.  Lay aside the things ye possess, and take fast hold of the Tablet of God  by His sovereign power. Better is this for you than all your possessions.  Unto this testifieth every understanding heart, and every man of insight.  Pride ye yourselves on My Name and yet shut yourselves out as by a veil  from Me? This indeed is a strange thing!          \"O CONCOURSE of archbishops! He Who is the Lord of...\"      O CONCOURSE of archbishops! He Who is the Lord of all men hath appeared.  In the plain of guidance He calleth mankind, whilst ye are numbered with  the dead! Great is the blessedness of him who is stirred by the Breeze of  God, and hath arisen from amongst the dead in this perspicuous Name.          \"O CONCOURSE of bishops!

Blessed the ear that hath heard, and the eye that hath seen,  and the heart that hath turned unto Him Who is the Point of Adoration of  all who are in the heavens and all who are on earth....          \"O CONCOURSE of bishops! Ye are the stars of the heaven...\"      O CONCOURSE of bishops! Ye are the stars of the heaven of My knowledge. My  mercy desireth not that ye should fall upon the earth. My justice,  however, declareth: 'This is that which the Son (Jesus) hath decreed.' And  whatsoever hath proceeded out of His blameless, His truth-speaking,  trustworthy mouth, can never be altered. The bells, verily, peal out My  Name, and lament over Me, but My spirit rejoiceth with evident gladness.  The body of the Loved One yearneth for the cross, and His head is eager  for the spear, in the path of the All-Merciful. The ascendancy of the  oppressor can in no wise deter Him from His purpose... The stars of the  heaven of knowledge have fallen, they that adduce the proofs they possess  in order to demonstrate the truth of My Cause, and who make mention of God  in My name. When I came unto them, in My majesty, however, they turned  aside from Me. They, verily, are of the fallen. This is what the Spirit  (Jesus) prophesied when He came with the truth, and the Jewish doctors  cavilled at Him, until they committed what made the Holy Spirit to lament,  and the eyes of such as enjoy near access to God to weep.          \"O CONCOURSE of priests! Leave the bells, and come...\"      O CONCOURSE of priests! Leave the bells, and come forth, then, from your  churches. It behoveth you, in this day, to proclaim aloud the Most Great  Name among the nations. Prefer ye to be silent, whilst every stone and  every tree shouteth aloud: 'The Lord is come in His great glory!' ...He  that summoneth men in My name is, verily, of Me, and he will show forth  that which is beyond the power of all that are on earth... Let the Breeze  of God awaken you. Verily, it hath wafted over the world. Well is it with  him that hath discovered the fragrance thereof and been accounted among  the well-assured....          \"O CONCOURSE of priests! The Day of Reckoning hath...\"      O CONCOURSE of priests! The Day of Reckoning hath appeared, the Day  whereon He Who was in heaven hath come. He, verily, is the One Whom ye  were promised in the Books of God, the Holy, the Almighty, the  All-Praised. How long will ye wander in the wilderness of heedlessness and  superstition? Turn with your hearts in the direction of your Lord, the  Forgiving, the Generous.          \"O CONCOURSE of monks! Seclude not yourselves in...\"      O CONCOURSE of monks! Seclude not yourselves in churches and cloisters.  Come forth by My leave, and occupy yourselves with that which will profit  your souls and the souls of men. Thus biddeth you the King of the Day of  Reckoning. Seclude yourselves in the stronghold of My love. This, verily,  is a befitting seclusion, were ye of them that perceive it. He that  shutteth himself up in a house is indeed as one dead. It behoveth man to  show forth that which will profit all created things, and he that bringeth  forth no fruit is fit for fire. Thus counselleth you your Lord, and He,  verily, is the Almighty, the All-Bounteous. Enter ye into wedlock, that  after you someone may fill your place. We have forbidden you perfidious  acts, and not that which will demonstrate fidelity. Have ye clung to the  standards fixed by your own selves, and cast the standards of God behind  your backs? Fear God, and be not of the foolish. But for man, who would  make mention of Me on My earth, and how could My attributes and My name  have been revealed? Ponder ye, and be not of them that are veiled and fast  asleep. He that wedded not (Jesus) found no place wherein to dwell or lay  His head, by reason of that which the hands of the treacherous had  wrought. His sanctity consisteth not in that which ye believe or fancy,  but rather in the things We possess. Ask, that ye may apprehend His  station which hath been exalted above the imaginings of all that dwell on  earth. Blessed are they who perceive it.          \"O CONCOURSE of monks! If ye choose to follow Me, I...\"      O CONCOURSE of monks! If ye choose to follow Me, I will make you heirs of  My Kingdom; and if ye transgress against Me, I will, in My long-suffering,  endure it patiently, and I, verily, am the Ever-Forgiving, the  All-Merciful... Bethlehem is astir with the Breeze of God. We hear her  voice saying: 'O most generous Lord! Where is Thy great glory established?  The sweet savours of Thy presence have quickened me, after I had melted in  my separation from Thee. Praised be Thou in that Thou hast raised the  veils, and come with power in evident glory.' We called unto her from  behind the Tabernacle of Majesty and Grandeur: 'O Bethlehem! This Light  hath risen in the orient, and travelled towards the occident, until it  reached thee in the evening of its life. Tell Me then: Do the sons  recognize the Father, and acknowledge Him, or do they deny Him, even as  the people aforetime denied Him (Jesus)?' Whereupon she cried out saying:  'Thou art, in truth, the All-Knowing, the Best-Informed.'          \"CONSIDER, likewise, how numerous at this time are the...\"      CONSIDER, likewise, how numerous at this time are the monks who have  secluded themselves in their churches, in My name, and who, when the  appointed time came, and We unveiled to them Our beauty, failed to  recognize Me, notwithstanding that they call upon Me at dawn and at  eventide.          \"READ ye the Evangel and yet refuse to acknowledge the...\"      READ ye the Evangel and yet refuse to acknowledge the All-Glorious Lord?  This indeed beseemeth you not, O concourse of learned men!... The  fragrances of the All-Merciful have wafted over all creation.

Read it, that haply ye may find the Truth, for  this Book is verily the Straight Path. This is the Way of God unto all who  are in the heavens and all who are on the earth. If ye have been careless  of the Qur'an, the Bayan cannot be regarded to be remote from you. Behold  it open before your eyes. Read ye its verses, lest perchance ye desist  from committing that which will cause the Messengers of God to mourn and  lament.    Speed out of your sepulchres. How long will ye sleep? The second blast  hath been blown on the trumpet. On whom are ye gazing? This is your Lord,  the God of Mercy. Witness how ye gainsay His signs! The earth hath quaked  with a great quaking, and cast forth her burdens. Will ye not admit it?  Say: Will ye not recognize how the mountains have become like flocks of  wool, how the people are sore vexed at the awful majesty of the Cause of  God? Witness how their houses are empty ruins, and they themselves a  drowned host.    This is the Day whereon the All-Merciful hath come down in the clouds of  knowledge, clothed with manifest sovereignty. He well knoweth the actions  of men. He it is Whose glory none can mistake, could ye but comprehend it.  The heaven of every religion hath been rent, and the earth of human  understanding been cleft asunder, and the angels of God are seen  descending. Say: This is the Day of mutual deceit; whither do ye flee? The  mountains have passed away, and the heavens have been folded together, and  the whole earth is held within His grasp, could ye but understand it. Who  is it that can protect you? None, by Him Who is the All-Merciful! None,  except God, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the Beneficent. Every woman  that hath had a burden in her womb hath cast her burden. We see men  drunken in this Day, the Day in which men and angels have been gathered  together.    Is there any doubt concerning God? Behold how He hath come down from the  heaven of His grace, girded with power and invested with sovereignty. Is  there any doubt concerning His signs? Open ye your eyes, and consider His  clear evidence. Paradise is on your right hand, and hath been brought nigh  unto you, while Hell hath been made to blaze. Witness its devouring flame.  Haste ye to enter into Paradise, as a token of Our mercy unto you, and  drink ye from the hands of the All-Merciful the Wine that is life indeed.          \"BY Him Who is the Great Announcement!

The state of things in India now strikingly resembles  that which existed in the Roman Empire at the rise of Christianity; when  East and West were brought into the closest contact, and a great  conflict of systems of thought took place in consequence.    But even as one hostile form of gnostic belief rose after another, and  rose only to fall--and as the greatest and best-disciplined foe of early  Christianity--the later Platonism--gave way before the steady,  irresistible march of gospel truth, so--we have every reason to hope--it  will be yet again. The Christian feels his heart swell in his breast as  he thinks what, in all human probability, India will be a century, or  even half a century, hence. O what a new life to that fairest of Eastern  lands when she casts herself in sorrow and supplication at the feet of  the living God, and then rises to proclaim to a listening world        \"Her deep repentance and her new-found joy!\"    May God hasten the advent of that happy day!          THE RISE AND DECLINE OF ISLAM.          OUTLINE OF THE ESSAY.      The progress of Islam was slow until Mohammed cast aside the precepts of  toleration and adopted an aggressive, militant policy. Then it became  rapid. The motives which animated the armies of Islam were  mixed--material and spiritual. Without the truths contained in the  system success would have been impossible, but neither without the sword  would the religion have been planted in Arabia, nor beyond. The  alternatives offered to conquered peoples were Islam, the sword, or  tribute. The drawbacks and attractions of the system are examined. The  former were not such as to deter men of the world from embracing the  faith. The sexual indulgences sanctioned by it are such as to make Islam  \"the Easy way.\"    The spread of Islam was stayed whenever military success was checked.  The Faith was meant for Arabia and not for the world, hence it is  constitutionally incapable of change or development. The degradation of  woman hinders the growth of freedom and civilization under it.    Christianity is contrasted in the means used for its propagation, the  methods it employed in grappling with and overcoming the evils that it  found existing in the world, in the relations it established between the  sexes, in its teaching with regard to the respective duties of the civil  and spiritual powers, and, above all, in its redeeming character, and  then the conclusion come to that Christianity is divine in its origin.          THE    RISE AND DECLINE OF ISLAM.           *       *       *       *       *          INTRODUCTION.      [Sidenote: Islam pre-eminent in its rapid spread.]  Among the religions of the earth Islam must take the precedence in the  rapidity and force with which it spread. Within a very short time from  its planting in Arabia the new faith had subdued great and populous  provinces. In half a dozen years, counting from the death of the  founder, the religion prevailed throughout Arabia, Syria, Persia, and  Egypt, and before the close of the century it ruled supreme over the  greater part of the vast populations from Gibraltar to the Oxus, from  the Black Sea to the river Indus.    [Sidenote: Propagation far quicker than of Christianity.]  In comparison with this grand outburst the first efforts of Christianity  were, to the outward eye, faint and feeble, and its extension so gradual  that what the Mohammedan religion achieved in ten or twenty years it  took the faith of Jesus long centuries to accomplish.    [Sidenote: Object of the Tract.]  The object of these few pages is, _first_, to inquire briefly into the  causes which led to the marvelous rapidity of the first movement of  Islam: _secondly_, to consider the reasons which eventually stayed its  advance; and, _lastly_, to ascertain why Mohammedan countries have kept  so far in the rear of other lands in respect of intellectual and social  progress. In short, the question is how it was that, Pallas-like, the  faith sprang ready-armed from the ground, conquering and to conquer, and  why, the weapons dropping from its grasp, Islam began to lose its  pristine vigor, and finally relapsed into inactivity.          I.    THE RAPID SPREAD OF ISLAM.      [Sidenote: Two periods in the mission of Mohammed.]  The personal ministry of Mohammed divides itself into two distinct  periods: first, his life at Mecca as a preacher and a prophet; second,  his life at Medina as a prophet and a king.    [Sidenote: I. Ministry at Mecca, A.D. 609-622.  Success at Mecca limited.]  It is only in the first of these periods that Islam at all runs parallel  with Christianity. The great body of his fellow-citizens rejected the  ministry of Mohammed and bitterly opposed his claims. His efforts at  Mecca were, therefore, confined to teaching and preaching and to the  publishing of the earlier \"Suras,\" or chapters of his \"Revelation.\"  After some thirteen years spent thus his converts, to the number of  about a hundred and fifty men and women, were forced by the persecution  of the Coreish (the ruling tribe at Mecca, from which Mohammed was  descended) to quit their native city and emigrate to Medina.[35] A  hundred more had previously fled from Mecca for the same cause, and  found refuge at the court of the Negus, or king of Abyssinia; and there  was already a small company of followers among the citizens of Medina.  At the utmost, therefore, the number of disciples gained over by the  simple resort to teaching and preaching did not, during the first twelve  years of Mohammed's ministry, exceed a few hundreds. It is true that the  soil of Mecca was stubborn and (unlike that of Judea) wholly unprepared.  The cause also, at times, became the object of sustained and violent  opposition. Even so much of success was consequently, under the peculiar  circumstances, remarkable. But it was by no means singular. The progress  fell far short of that made by Christianity during the corresponding  period of its existence,[36] and indeed by many reformers who have been  the preachers of a new faith. It gave no promise whatever of the  marvelous spectacle that was about to follow.    [Sidenote: II. Change of policy at Medina, A.D. 622-632.  Arabia converted from Medina at the point of the sword.]  Having escaped from Mecca and found a new and congenial home in Medina,  Mohammed was not long in changing his front. At Mecca, surrounded by  enemies, he taught toleration. He was simply the preacher commissioned  to deliver a message, and bidden to leave the responsibility with his  Master and his hearers. He might argue with the disputants, but it must  be \"in a way most mild and gracious;\" for \"in religion\" (such was his  teaching before he reached Medina) \"there should be neither violence nor  constraint.\"[37] At Medina the precepts of toleration were quickly cast  aside and his whole policy reversed. No sooner did Mohammed begin to be  recognized and obeyed as the chief of Medina than he proceeded to attack  the Jewish tribes settled in the neighborhood because they refused to  acknowledge his claims and believe in him as a prophet foretold in their  Scriptures; two of these tribes were exiled, and the third exterminated  in cold blood. In the second year after the Hegira[a], or flight from Mecca  (the period from which the Mohammedan era dates), he began to plunder  the caravans of the Coreish, which passed near to Medina on their  mercantile journeys between Arabia and Syria. So popular did the cause  of the now militant and marauding prophet speedily become among the  citizens of Medina and the tribes around that, after many battles fought  with varying success, he was able, in the eighth year of the Hegira[b] to  re-enter his native city at the head of ten thousand armed followers.  Thenceforward success was assured. None dared to oppose his pretensions.  And before his death, in the eleventh year of the Hegira[c], all Arabia,  from Bab-el-Mandeb and Oman to the confines of the Syrian desert, was  forced to submit to the supreme authority of the now kingly prophet and  to recognize the faith and obligations of Islam.[38]    [Sidenote: Religion of Mohammed described.]  This _Islam_, so called from its demanding the entire \"surrender\" of the  believer to the will and service of God, is based on the recognition of  Mohammed as a prophet foretold in the Jewish and Christian  Scriptures--the last and greatest of the prophets. On him descended the  Koran from time to time, an immediate revelation from the Almighty.  Idolatry and polytheism are with iconoclastic zeal denounced as sins of  the deepest dye; while the unity of the Deity is proclaimed as the grand  and cardinal doctrine of the faith. Divine providence pervades the  minutest concerns of life, and predestination is taught in its most  naked form. Yet prayer is enjoined as both meritorious and effective;  and at five stated times every day must it be specially performed. The  duties generally of the moral law are enforced, though an evil laxity is  given in the matter of polygamy and divorce. Tithes are demanded as alms  for the poor. A fast during the month of Ramzan must be kept throughout  the whole of every day; and the yearly pilgrimage to Mecca--an ancient  institution, the rites of which were now divested of their heathenish  accompaniments--maintained. The existence of angels and devils is  taught, and heaven and hell are depicted in material colors--the one of  sensuous pleasure, the other of bodily torment. Finally, the  resurrection, judgment, and retribution of good and evil are set forth  in great detail. Such was the creed--\"_There is no god but the_  Lord, _and_ Mohammed _is his prophet_\"--to which Arabia now became  obedient.    [Sidenote: Arabia apostatizes; but is speedily reconquered and  reclaimed, A.D. 633.]  But immediately on the death of Mohammed the entire peninsula relapsed  into apostasy. Medina and Mecca remained faithful; but every-where else  the land "]]]
