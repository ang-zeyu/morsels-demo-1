That is to say, the materialists announce, that the  criterion and standard of human knowledge is sense perception. Among the  Greeks and Romans the criterion of knowledge was reason; that whatever is  provable and acceptable by reason must necessarily be admitted as true. A  third standard or criterion is the opinion held by theologians that  traditions or prophetic statement and interpretations constitute the basis  of human knowing. There is still another, a fourth criterion, upheld by  religionists and metaphysicians who say that the source and channel of all  human penetration into the unknown is through inspiration. Briefly then,  these four criterions according to the declarations of men are:  First--Sense Perception; Second--Reason; Third--Traditions;  Fourth--Inspiration.    In Europe I told the philosophers and scientists of materialism that the  criterion of the senses is not reliable. For instance, consider a mirror  and the images reflected in it. These images have no actual corporeal  existence. Yet if you had never seen a mirror you would firmly insist and  believe that they were real. The eye sees a mirage upon the desert as a  lake of water but there is no reality in it. As we stand upon the deck of  a steamer the shore appears to be moving, yet we know the land is  stationary and we are moving. The earth was believed to be fixed and the  sun revolving about it but although this appears to be so, the reverse is  now known to be true. A whirling torch makes a circle of fire appear  before the eye, yet we realize there is but one point of light. We behold  a shadow moving upon the ground but it has no material existence, no  substance. In deserts the atmospheric effects are particularly productive  of illusions which deceive the eye. Once I saw a mirage in which a whole  caravan appeared traveling upward into the sky. In the far north other  deceptive phenomena appear and baffle human vision. Sometimes three or  four suns called by scientists \"mock suns\" will be shining at the same  time whereas we know the great solar orb is one and that it remains fixed  and single. In brief, the senses are continually deceived and we are  unable to separate that which is reality from that which is not.    As to the second criterion, reason, this likewise is unreliable and not to  be depended upon. This human world is an ocean of varying opinions. If  reason is the perfect standard and criterion of knowledge, why are  opinions at variance and why do philosophers disagree so completely with  each other? This is a clear proof that human reason is not to be relied  upon as an infallible criterion. For instance, great discoveries and  announcements of former centuries are continually upset and discarded by  the wise men of today. Mathematicians, astronomers, chemical scientists  continually disprove and reject the conclusions of the ancients; nothing  is fixed, nothing final; everything continually changing because human  reason is progressing along new roads of investigation and arriving at new  conclusions every day. In the future much that is announced and accepted  as true now will be rejected and disproved. And so it will continue ad  infinitum.    When we consider the third criterion, traditions, upheld by theologians as  the avenue and standard of knowledge, we find this source equally  unreliable and unworthy of dependence. For religious traditions are the  report and record of understanding and interpretation of the Book. By what  means has this understanding, this interpretation been reached? By the  analysis of human reason. When we read the Book of God the faculty of  comprehension by which we form conclusions is reason. Reason is mind. If  we are not endowed with perfect reason, how can we comprehend the meanings  of the Word of God? Therefore human reason, as already pointed out, is by  its very nature finite and faulty in conclusions. It cannot surround the  Reality Itself, the Infinite Word. Inasmuch as the source of traditions  and interpretations is human reason, and human reason is faulty, how can  we depend upon its findings for real knowledge?    The fourth criterion I have named is inspiration through which it is  claimed the reality of knowledge is attainable. What is inspiration? It is  the influx of the human heart. But what are satanic promptings which  afflict mankind? They are the influx of the heart also. How shall we  differentiate between them? The question arises, How shall we know whether  we are following inspiration from God or satanic promptings of the human  soul? Briefly, the point is that in the human material world of phenomena  these four are the only existing criterions or avenues of knowledge, and  all of them are faulty and unreliable. What then remains? How shall we  attain the reality of knowledge? By the breaths and promptings of the Holy  Spirit which is light and knowledge Itself. Through it the human mind is  quickened and fortified into true conclusions and perfect knowledge. This  is conclusive argument showing that all available human criterions are  erroneous and defective, but the divine standard of knowledge is  infallible. Therefore man is not justified in saying: \"I know because I  perceive through my senses\"; or: \"I know because it is proved through my  faculty of reason\"; or: \"I know because it is according to tradition and  interpretation of the holy book\"; or: \"I know because I am inspired.\" All  human standard of judgment is faulty, finite.          THE SUN OF REALITY      In our solar system, the center of illumination is the sun itself. Through  the will of God this central luminary is the one source of the existence  and development of all phenomenal things. When we observe the organisms of  the material kingdoms we find that their growth and training are dependent  upon the heat and light of the sun. Without this quickening impulse there  would be no growth of tree or vegetation, neither would the existence of  animal or human being be possible; in fact no forms of created life would  be manifest upon the earth. But if we reflect deeply we will perceive that  the great bestower and giver of life is God; the sun is the intermediary  of His will and plan. Without the bounty of the sun therefore the world  would be in darkness. All illumination of our planetary system proceeds or  emanates from the solar center.    Likewise in the spiritual realm of intelligence and idealism there must be  a center of illumination, and that center is the everlasting, ever-shining  Sun, the Word of God. Its lights are the lights of reality which have  shone upon humanity, illumining the realm of thought and morals,  conferring the bounties of the divine world upon man. These lights are the  cause of the education of souls and the source of the enlightenment of  hearts, sending forth in effulgent radiance the message of the  glad-tidings of the kingdom of God. In brief, the moral and ethical world  and the world of spiritual regeneration are dependent for their  progressive being upon that heavenly center of illumination. It gives  forth the light of religion and bestows the life of the spirit, imbues  humanity with archetypal virtues and confers eternal splendors. This Sun  of Reality, this center of effulgences is the prophet or Manifestation of  God. Just as the phenomenal sun shines upon the material world producing  life and growth, likewise the spiritual or prophetic Sun confers  illumination upon the human world of thought and intelligence, and unless  it rose upon the horizon of human existence the kingdom of man would  become dark and extinguished.    The Sun of Reality is one Sun but it has different dawning-places, just as  the phenomenal sun is one although it appears at various points of the  horizon. During the time of spring the luminary of the physical world  rises far to the north of the equinoctial; in summer it dawns midway and  in winter it appears in the most southerly point of its zodiacal journey.  These day springs or dawning-points differ widely but the sun is ever the  same sun whether it be the phenomenal or spiritual luminary. Souls who  focus their vision upon the Sun of Reality will be the recipients of light  no matter from what point it rises, but those who are fettered by  adoration of the dawning-point are deprived when it appears in a different  station upon the spiritual horizon.    Furthermore, just as the solar cycle has its four seasons the cycle of the  Sun of Reality has its distinct and successive periods. Each brings its  vernal season or springtime. When the Sun of Reality returns to quicken  the world of mankind a divine bounty descends from the heaven of  generosity. The realm of thoughts and ideals is set in motion and blessed  with new life. Minds are developed, hopes brighten, aspirations become  spiritual, the virtues of the human world appear with freshened power of  growth and the image and likeness of God become visible in man. It is the  springtime of the inner world. After the spring, summer comes with its  fullness and fruitage spiritual; autumn follows with its withering winds  which chill the soul; the Sun seems to be going away until at last the  mantle of winter overspreads and only faint traces of the effulgence of  that divine Sun remain. Just as the surface of the material world becomes  dark and dreary, the soil dormant, the trees naked and bare and no beauty  or freshness remain to cheer the darkness and desolation, so the winter of  the spiritual cycle witnesses the death and disappearance of divine growth  and extinction of the light"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19240"],[0,"Bahá'í Prayers (#10)"],[1,"and bestowals. He who  cometh with one goodly deed will receive a tenfold reward. There is no  doubt that the living Lord will abundantly confirm those who expend their  wealth in His path.    O God, my God! Illumine the brows of Thy true lovers, and support them  with angelic hosts of certain triumph. Set firm their feet on Thy straight  path, and out of Thine ancient bounty open before them the portals of Thy  blessings; for they are expending on Thy pathway what Thou hast bestowed  upon them, safeguarding Thy Faith, putting their trust in their  remembrance of Thee, offering up their hearts for love of Thee, and  withholding not what they possess in adoration for Thy Beauty and in their  search for ways to please Thee.    O my Lord! Ordain for them a plenteous share, a destined recompense and  sure reward.    Verily, Thou art the Sustainer, the Helper, the Generous, the Bountiful,  the Ever-Bestowing.    --'Abdu'l-Baha          HEALING        \"O God, my God! I beg of Thee by the ocean...\"      O God, my God! I beg of Thee by the ocean of Thy healing, and by the  splendors of the Daystar of Thy grace, and by Thy Name through which Thou  didst subdue Thy servants, and by the pervasive power of Thy most exalted  Word and the potency of Thy most august Pen, and by Thy mercy that hath  preceded the creation of all who are in heaven and on earth, to purge me  with the waters of Thy bounty from every affliction and disorder, and from  all weakness and feebleness.    Thou seest, O my Lord, Thy suppliant waiting at the door of Thy bounty,  and him who hath set his hopes on Thee clinging to the cord of Thy  generosity. Deny him not, I beseech Thee, the things he seeketh from the  ocean of Thy grace and the Daystar of Thy loving-kindness.    Powerful art Thou to do what pleaseth Thee. There is none other God save  Thee, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Generous.    --Baha'u'llah        \"Thy name is my healing, O my God, and remembrance...\"      Thy name is my healing, O my God, and remembrance of Thee is my remedy.  Nearness to Thee is my hope, and love for Thee is my companion. Thy mercy  to me is my healing and my succor in both this world and the world to  come. Thou, verily, art the All-Bountiful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.    --Baha'u'llah        \"Glory be to Thee, O Lord my God! I implore...\"      Glory be to Thee, O Lord my God! I implore Thee by Thy Name, through which  Thou didst lift up the ensigns of Thy guidance, and didst shed the  radiance of Thy loving-kindness, and didst reveal the sovereignty of Thy  Lordship; through which the lamp of Thy names hath appeared within the  niche of Thine attributes, and He Who is the Tabernacle of Thy unity and  the Manifestation of detachment hath shone forth; through which the ways  of Thy guidance were made known, and the paths of Thy good pleasure were  marked out; through which the foundations of error have been made to  tremble, and the signs of wickedness have been abolished; through which  the fountains of wisdom have burst forth, and the heavenly table hath been  sent down; through which Thou didst preserve Thy servants and didst  vouchsafe Thy healing; through which Thou didst show forth Thy tender  mercies unto Thy servants and revealedst Thy forgiveness amidst Thy  creatures--I implore Thee to keep safe him who hath held fast and returned  unto Thee, and clung to Thy mercy, and seized the hem of Thy loving  providence. Send down, then, upon him Thy healing, and make him whole, and  endue him with a constancy vouchsafed by Thee, and a tranquillity bestowed  by Thy highness.    Thou art, verily, the Healer, the Preserver, the Helper, the Almighty, the  Powerful, the All-Glorious, the All-Knowing.    --Baha'u'llah        \"Praised be Thou, O Lord my God! I implore...\"      Praised be Thou, O Lord my God! I implore Thee, by Thy Most Great Name  through which Thou didst stir up Thy servants and build up Thy cities, and  by Thy most excellent titles, and Thy most august attributes, to assist  Thy people to turn in the direction of Thy manifold bounties, and set  their faces towards the Tabernacle of Thy wisdom. Heal Thou the sicknesses  that have assailed the souls on every side, and have deterred them from  directing their gaze towards the Paradise that lieth in the shelter of Thy  shadowing Name, which Thou didst ordain to be the King of all names unto  all who are in heaven and all who are on earth. Potent art Thou to do as  pleaseth Thee. In Thy hands is the empire of all names. There is none  other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Wise.    I am but a poor creature, O my Lord; I have clung to the hem of Thy  riches. I am sore sick; I have held fast the cord of Thy healing. Deliver  me from the ills that have encircled me, and wash me thoroughly with the  waters of Thy graciousness and mercy, and attire me with the raiment of  wholesomeness, through Thy forgiveness and bounty. Fix, then, mine eyes  upon Thee, and rid me of all attachment to aught else except Thyself. Aid  me to do what Thou desirest, and to fulfill what Thou pleasest.    Thou art truly the Lord of this life and of the next. Thou art, in truth,  the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.    --Baha'u'llah        \"Glory be to Thee, O Lord my God! I beg of...\"      Glory be to Thee, O Lord my God! I beg of Thee by Thy Name through which  He Who is Thy Beauty hath been stablished upon the throne of Thy Cause,  and by Thy Name through which Thou changest all things, and gatherest  together all things, and callest to account all things, and rewardest all  things, and preservest all things, and sustainest all things--I beg of Thee  to guard this handmaiden who hath fled for refuge to Thee, and hath sought  the shelter of Him in Whom Thou Thyself art manifest, and hath put her  whole trust and confidence in Thee.    She is sick, O my God, and hath entered beneath the shadow of the Tree of  Thy healing; afflicted, and hath fled to the City of Thy protection;  diseased, and hath sought the Fountainhead of Thy favors; sorely vexed,  and hath hasted to attain the Wellspring of Thy tranquillity; burdened  with sin, and hath set her face toward the court of Thy forgiveness.    Attire her, by Thy sovereignty and Thy loving-kindness, O my God and my  Beloved, with the raiment of Thy balm and Thy healing, and make her quaff  of the cup of Thy mercy and Thy favors. Protect her, moreover, from every  affliction and ailment, from all pain and sickness, and from whatsoever  may be abhorrent unto Thee.    Thou, in truth, art immensely exalted above all else except Thyself.
