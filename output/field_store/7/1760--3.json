When God at midnight goes to the pious in  Paradise, all the trees therein break out into adoration, and  their songs awaken the cock, who begins in turn to praise God.  Seven times he crows, each time reciting a verse. The first verse  is: \"Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye  everlasting doors, and the King of glory shall come in. Who is  the King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in  battle.\" The second verse: \"Lift up your heads, O ye gates; yea,  lift them up, ye everlasting doors, and the King of glory shall  come in. Who is this King of glory? The Lord of hosts, He is the  King of glory.\" The third: \"Arise, ye righteous, and occupy  yourselves with the Torah, that your reward may be abundant in  the world hereafter.\" The fourth: \"I have waited for Thy  salvation, O Lord!\" The fifth: \"How long wilt thou sleep, O  sluggard? When wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?\" The sixth:  \"Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, and  thou shalt be satisfied with bread.\" And the seventh verse sung  by the cock runs: \"It is time to work for the Lord, for they have  made void Thy law.\"    The song of the vulture is: \"I will hiss for them, and gather  them; for I have redeemed them, and they shall increase as they  have increased\"--the same verse with which the bird will in time  to come announce the advent of the Messiah, the only difference  being, that when he heralds the Messiah he will sit upon the  ground and sing his verse, while at all other times he is seated  elsewhere when he sings it.    Nor do the other animals praise God less than the birds. Even the  beasts of prey give forth adoration. The lion says: \"The Lord  shall go forth as a mighty man; He shall stir up jealousy like a  man of war; He shall cry, yea, He shall shout aloud; He shall do  mightily against his enemies.\" And the fox exhorts unto justice  with the words: \"Woe unto him that buildeth his house by  unrighteousness, and his chambers by injustice; that useth his  neighbor's service without wages, and giveth him not his hire.\"    Yea, the dumb fishes know how to proclaim the praise of their  Lord. \"The voice of the Lord is upon the waters,\" they say, \"the  God of glory thundereth, even the Lord upon many waters\"; while  the frog exclaims, \"Blessed be the name of the glory of His  kingdom forever and ever.\"    Contemptible though they are, even the reptiles give praise unto  their Creator. The mouse extols God with the words: \"Howbeit Thou  art just in all that is come upon me; for Thou hast dealt truly,  but I have done wickedly.\" And the cat sings: \"Let everything  that hath breath praise the Lord. Praise ye the Lord.\"[194]        II    ADAM MAN AND THE WORLD  THE ANGELS AND THE CREATION OF MAN  THE CREATION OF ADAM  THE SOUL OF MAN  THE IDEAL MAN  THE FALL OF SATAN  WOMAN  ADAM AND EVE IN PARADISE  THE FALL OF MAN  THE PUNISHMENT  SABBATH IN HEAVEN  ADAM'S REPENTANCE  THE BOOK OF RAZIEL  THE SICKNESS OF ADAM  EVE'S STORY OF THE FALL  THE DEATH OF ADAM  THE DEATH OF EVE        II    ADAM    MAN AND THE WORLD    With ten Sayings God created the world, although a single Saying  would have sufficed. God desired to make known how severe is the  punishment to be meted out to the wicked, who destroy a world  created with as many as ten Sayings, and how goodly the reward  destined for the righteous, who preserve a world created with as  many as ten Sayings.[1]    The world was made for man, though he was the last-comer among  its creatures. This was design. He was to find all things ready  for him. God was the host who prepared dainty dishes, set the  table, and then led His guest to his seat. At the same time man's  late appearance on earth is to convey an admonition to humility.  Let him beware of being proud, lest he invite the retort that the  gnat is older than he.[2]    The superiority of man to the other creatures is apparent in the  very manner of his creation, altogether different from theirs. He  is the only one who was created by the hand of God.[3] The rest  sprang from the word of God. The body of man is a microcosm, the  whole world in miniature, and the world in turn is a reflex of  man. The hair upon his head corresponds to the woods of the  earth, his tears to a river, his mouth to the ocean.[4] Also, the  world resembles the ball of his eye: the ocean that encircles the  earth is like unto the white of the eye, the dry land is the  iris, Jerusalem the pupil, and the Temple the image mirrored in  the pupil of the eye.[5] But man is more than a mere image of  this world. He unites both heavenly and earthly qualities within  himself. In four he resembles the angels, in four the beasts. His  power of speech, his discriminating intellect, his upright walk,  the glance of his eye--they all make an angel of him. But, on the  other hand, he eats and drinks, secretes the waste matter in his  body, propagates his kind, and dies, like the beast of the field.  Therefore God said before the creation of man: \"The celestials  are not propagated, but they are immortal; the beings on earth  are propagated, but they die. I will create man to be the union  of the two, so that when he sins, when he behaves like a beast,  death shall overtake him; but if he refrains from sin, he shall  live forever.\"[6] God now bade all beings in heaven and on earth  contribute to the creation of man, and He Himself took part in  it. Thus they all will love man, and if he should sin, they will  be interested in his preservation.[7]    The whole world naturally was created for the pious, the  God-fearing man, whom Israel produces with the helpful guidance  of the law of God revealed to him.[8] It was, therefore, Israel  who was taken into special consideration at the time man was  made. All other creatures were instructed to change their nature,  if Israel should ever need their help in the course of his  history. The sea was ordered to divide before Moses, and the  heavens to give ear to the words of the leader; the sun and the  moon were bidden to stand still before Joshua, the ravens to feed  Elijah, the fire to spare the three youths in the furnace, the  lion to do no harm to Daniel, the fish to spew forth Jonah, and  the heavens to open before Ezekiel.[9]    In His modesty, God took counsel with the angels, before the  creation of the world, regarding His intention of making man. He  said: \"For the sake of Israel, I will create the world. As I  shall make a division between light and darkness, so I will in  time to come do for Israel in Egypt--thick darkness shall be over  the land, and the children of Israel shall have light in their  dwellings; as I shall make a separation between the waters under  the firmament and the waters above the firmament, so I will do  for Israel--I will divide the waters for him when he crosses the  Red Sea; as on the third day I shall create plants, so I will do  for Israel--I will bring forth manna for him in the wilderness;  as I shall create luminaries to divide day from night, so I will  do for Israel--I will go before him by day in a pillar of cloud  and by night in a pillar of fire; as I shall create the fowl of  the air and the fishes of the sea, so I will do for Israel--I  will bring quails for him from the sea; and as I shall breathe  the breath of life into the nostrils of man, so I will do for  Israel--I will give the Torah unto him, the tree of life.\" The  angels marvelled that so much love should be lavished upon this  people of Israel, and God told them: \"On the first day of  creation, I shall make the heavens and stretch them out; so will  Israel raise up the Tabernacle as the dwelling-place of My glory.  On the second day, I shall put a division between the terrestrial  waters and the heavenly waters; so will he hang up a veil in the  Tabernacle to divide the Holy Place and the Most Holy. On the  third day, I shall make the earth put forth grass and herb; so  will he, in obedience to My commands, eat herbs on the first  night of the Passover, and prepare showbread for Me. On the  fourth day, I shall make the luminaries; so will he make a golden  candlestick for Me. On the fifth day, I shall create the birds;  so will he fashion the cherubim with outstretched wings. On the  sixth day, I shall create man; so will Israel set aside a man of  the sons of Aaron as high priest for My service.\"[10]    Accordingly, the whole of creation was conditional. God said to  the things He made on the first six days: \"If Israel accepts the  Torah, you will continue and endure; otherwise, I shall turn  everything back into chaos again.\" The whole world was thus kept  in suspense and dread until the day of the revelation on Sinai,  when Israel received and accepted the Torah, and so fulfilled the  condition made by God at the time when He created the  universe.[11]      THE ANGELS AND THE CREATION OF MAN    God in His wisdom hiving resolved to create man, He asked counsel  of all around Him before He proceeded to execute His purpose--an  example to man, be he never so great and distinguished, not to  scorn the advice of the humble and lowly. First God called upon  heaven and earth, then upon all other things He had created, and  last upon the angels.    The angels were not all of one opinion. The Angel of Love favored  the creation of man, because he would be affectionate and loving;  but the Angel of Truth opposed it, because he would be full of  lies. And while the Angel of Justice favored it, because he would  practice justice, the Angel of Peace opposed it, because he would  be quarrelsome.    To invalidate his protest, God cast the Angel of Truth down from  heaven to earth, and when the others cried out against such  contemptuous treatment of their companion, He said, \"Truth will  spring"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1494"],[0,"The Legends of the Jews â€” Volume 2 (#10)"],[1,"-looked-for opportunity, she  thought. She rose up and ascended to the hall of state, and  arrayed herself in princely garments. She placed precious  stones upon her head, onyx stones set in silver and gold,  she beautified her face and her body with all sorts of things  for the purifying of women, she perfumed the hall and the  whole house with cassia and frankincense, spread myrrh  and aloes all over, and afterward sat herself down at the  entrance to the hall, in the vestibule leading to the house,  through which Joseph had to pass to his work.    And, behold, Joseph came from the field, and he was on  the point of entering the house to do his master's work, but  when he reached the place where Zuleika sat, and saw all  she had done, he turned back. His mistress, perceiving it,  called out to him, \"What aileth thee, Joseph? Go to thy  work, I will make room for thee, that thou mayest pass by  to thy seat.\" Joseph did as she bade him, he entered the  house, took his seat, and set about his master's work as  usual. Then Zuleika stood before him suddenly in all her  beauty of person and magnificence of raiment, and repeated  the desire of her heart.[120] It was the first and the last time  that Joseph's steadfastness deserted him, but only for an  instant. When he was on the point of complying with the  wish of his mistress, the image of his mother Rachel appeared  before him, and that of his aunt Leah, and the image  of his father Jacob. The last addressed him thus: \"In time  to come the names of thy brethren will be graven upon the  breastplate of the high priest. Dost thou desire to have thy  name appear with theirs? Or wilt thou forfeit this honor  through sinful conduct? For know, he that keepeth company  with harlots wasteth his substance.\" This vision of  the dead, and especially the image of his father, brought  Joseph to his senses, and his illicit passion departed from  him.[121]    Astonished at the swift change in his countenance, Zuleika  said, \"My friend and true-love, why art thou so affrighted  that thou art near to swooning?    Joseph: \"I see my father!\"    Zuleika: \"Where is he? Why, there is none in the house.\"    Joseph: \"Thou belongest to a people that is like unto the  ass, it perceiveth nothing. But I belong to those who can  see things.\"    Joseph fled forth, away from the house of his mistress,[122]  the same house in which aforetime wonders had been done  for Sarah kept a captive there by Pharaoh.[123] But hardly  was he outside when the sinful passion again overwhelmed  him, and he returned to Zuleika's chamber. Then the Lord  appeared unto him, holding the Eben Shetiyah[124] in His  hand, and said to him: \"If thou touchest her, I will cast  away this stone upon which the earth is founded, and the  world will fall to ruin.\" Sobered again, Joseph started  to escape from his mistress,[125] but Zuleika caught him by his  garment, and she said: \"As the king liveth, if thou wilt  not fulfil my wish, thou must die,\" and while she spoke thus,  she drew a sword with her free hand from under her dress,  and, pressing it against Joseph's throat, she said, \"Do as I  bid thee, or thou diest.\" Joseph ran out, leaving a piece of  his garment in the hands of Zuleika as he wrenched himself  loose from the grasp of the woman with a quick, energetic  motion.[126]    Zuleika's passion for Joseph was so violent that, in lieu  of its owner, whom she could not succeed in subduing to her  will, she kissed and caressed the fragment of cloth left in  her hand.[127] At the same time she was not slow to perceive  the danger into which she had put herself, for, she feared,  Joseph might possibly betray her conduct, and she considered  ways and means of obviating the consequences of  her folly.[128]    Meanwhile her friends returned from the Nile festival,  and they came to visit her and inquire after her health.  They found her looking wretchedly ill, on account of the  excitement she had passed through and the anxiety she was  in. She confessed to the women what had happened with  Joseph, and they advised her to accuse him of immorality  before her husband, and then he would be thrown into  prison. Zuleika accepted their advice, and she begged her  visitors to support her charges by also lodging complaints  against Joseph, that he had been annoying them with improper  proposals.[129]    But Zuleika did not depend entirely upon the assistance of  her friends. She planned a ruse, besides, to be sure of  convincing her husband of Joseph's guilt. She laid aside her  rich robes of state, put on her ordinary clothes, and took to  her sick-bed, in which she had been lying when the people  left to go to the festival. Also she took Joseph's torn garment,  and laid it out next to her. Then she sent a little boy  to summon some of the men of her house, and to them she  told the tale of Joseph's alleged outrage, saying: \"See the  Hebrew slave, whom your master hath brought in unto my  house, and who attempted to do violence to me to-day! You  had scarcely gone away to the festival when be entered the  house, and making sure that no one was here he tried to  force me to yield to his lustful desire. But I grasped his  clothes, tore them, and cried with a loud voice. When he  heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, he was seized with  fear, and be fled, and got him out, but he left his garment  by me.\" The men of her house spake not a word, but, in a  rage against Joseph, they went to their master, and reported  to him what had come to pass.[130] In the meantime the husbands  of Zuleika's friends had also spoken to Potiphar, at  the instigation of their wives, and complained of his slave,  that he molested them.[131]    Potiphar hastened home, and he found his wife in low  spirits, and though the cause of her dejection was chagrin  at not having succeeded in winning Joseph's love, she pretended  that it was anger at the immoral conduct of the slave.  She accused him in the following words: \"O husband,  mayest thou not live a day longer, if thou dost not punish  the wicked slave that hath desired to defile thy bed, that  hath not kept in mind who he was when he came to our  house, to demean himself with modesty, nor hath he been  mindful of the favors he hath received from thy bounty.  He did lay a privy design to abuse thy wife, and this at the  time of observing a festival, when thou wouldst be absent.\"[132]  These words she spoke at the moment of conjugal  intimacy with Potiphar, when she was certain of exerting  an influence upon her husband.[133]    Potiphar gave credence to her words, and he had Joseph  flogged unmercifully. While the cruel blows fell upon him,  he cried to God, \"O Lord, Thou knowest that I am innocent  of these things, and why should I die to-day on account of  a false accusation by the hands of these uncircumcised,  impious men?\" God opened the mouth of Zuleika's child,  a babe of but eleven months, and he spoke to the men that  were beating Joseph, saying: \"What is your quarrel with  this man? Why do you inflict such evil upon him? Lies  my mother doth speak, and deceit is what her mouth uttereth.  This is the true tale of that which did happen,\" and the  child proceeded to tell all that had passed--how Zuleika had  tried first to persuade Joseph to act wickedly, and then had  tried to force him to do her will. The people listened in  great amazement. But the report finished, the child spake  no word, as before.    Abashed by the speech of his own infant son, Potiphar  commanded his bailiffs to leave off from chastising Joseph,  and the matter was brought into court, where priests sat as  judges. Joseph protested his innocence, and related all that  had happened according to the truth, but Potiphar repeated  the account his wife had given him. The judges ordered the  garment of Joseph to be brought which Zuleika had in her  possession, and they examined the tear therein. It turned  out to be on the front part of the mantle, and they came to  the conclusion that Zuleika had tried to hold him fast, and  had been foiled in her attempt by Joseph, against whom she  was now lodging a trumped up charge. They decided that  Joseph had not incurred the death penalty, but they condemned  him to incarceration, because he was the cause of a  stain upon Zuleika's fair name.\"[134]    Potiphar himself was convinced of Joseph's innocence,  and when he cast him into prison, he said to him, \"I know  that thou art not guilty of so vile a crime, but I must put  thee in durance, lest a taint cling to my children.\"[135]      JOSEPH IN PRISON    By way of punishment for having traduced his ten brethren  before his father, Joseph had to languish for ten years  in the prison to which the wiles of traducers had in turn  condemned him.[136] But, on the other hand, as he had sanctified  the Name of God before the world by his chastity and  his steadfastness, he was rewarded. The letter He, which  occurs twice in the Name of God, was added to his name.  He had been called Joseph, but now he was called also  Jehoseph.[137]    Though he was bound in prison, Joseph was not yet safe  from the machinations of his mistress, whose passion for  him was in no wise lessened. In truth it was she that had  induced her husband to change his intention regarding Joseph;  she urged him to imprison the slave rather than kill  him, for she hoped that as a prisoner he could be made  amenable to her wishes more easily. She spake to her husband,  saying: \"Do not destroy thy property. Cast the slave  in prison and keep him there until thou canst sell him, and  receive back the money thou didst pay out for him.\"[138] Thus  she had the opportunity of visiting Joseph in his cell and  trying to persuade him to do her will. She would say,  \"This and that outrage have I executed against thee, but, as  thou livest, I will put yet other outrages upon thee if thou  dost not obey me.\" But Joseph replied, \"The Lord executeth  judgment for the oppressed.\"    "]]]
