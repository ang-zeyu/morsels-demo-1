Or, The Voyages and Adventures of Sir Amyas Leigh, Knight, of (#10)"],[1,"wild deer drink in ferny dells;       While the Oreads as they past       Peep'd from Druid Tors aghast.       By alder copses sliding slow,       Knee-deep in flowers came gentler Yeo       And paused awhile her locks to twine       With musky hops and white woodbine,       Then joined the silver-footed band,       Which circled down my golden sand,       By dappled park, and harbor shady,       Haunt of love-lorn knight and lady,       My thrice-renowned sons to greet,       With rustic song and pageant meet.       For joy! the girdled robe around       Eliza's name henceforth shall sound,       Whose venturous fleets to conquest start,       Where ended once the seaman's chart,       While circling Sol his steps shall count       Henceforth from Thule's western mount,       And lead new rulers round the seas       From furthest Cassiterides.       For found is now the golden tree,       Solv'd th' Atlantic mystery,       Pluck'd the dragon-guarded fruit;       While around the charmed root,       Wailing loud, the Hesperids       Watch their warder's drooping lids.       Low he lies with grisly wound,       While the sorceress triple-crown'd       In her scarlet robe doth shield him,       Till her cunning spells have heal'd him.       Ye, meanwhile, around the earth       Bear the prize of manful worth.       Yet a nobler meed than gold       Waits for Albion's children bold;       Great Eliza's virgin hand       Welcomes you to Fairy-land,       While your native Naiads bring       Native wreaths as offering.       Simple though their show may be,       Britain's worship in them see.       'Tis not price, nor outward fairness,       Gives the victor's palm its rareness;       Simplest tokens can impart       Noble throb to noble heart:       Graecia, prize thy parsley crown,       Boast thy laurel, Caesar's town;       Moorland myrtle still shall be       Badge of Devon's Chivalry!\"    And so ending, she took the wreath of fragrant gale from her own head,  and stooping from the car, placed it on the head of Amyas Leigh, who  made answer--    \"There is no place like home, my fair mistress and no scent to my taste  like this old home-scent in all the spice-islands that I ever sailed  by!\"    \"Her song was not so bad,\" said Sir Richard to Lady Bath--\"but how came  she to hear Plymouth bells at Tamar-head, full fifty miles away? That's  too much of a poet's license, is it not?\"    \"The river-nymphs, as daughters of Oceanus, and thus of immortal  parentage, are bound to possess organs of more than mortal keenness;  but, as you say, the song was not so bad--erudite, as well as  prettily conceived--and, saving for a certain rustical simplicity and  monosyllabic baldness, smacks rather of the forests of Castaly than  those of Torridge.\"    So spake my Lady Bath; whom Sir Richard wisely answered not; for she was  a terribly learned member of the college of critics, and disputed even  with Sidney's sister the chieftaincy of the Euphuists; so Sir Richard  answered not, but answer was made for him.    \"Since the whole choir of Muses, madam, have migrated to the Court of  Whitehall, no wonder if some dews of Parnassus should fertilize at times  even our Devon moors.\"    The speaker was a tall and slim young man, some five-and-twenty years  old, of so rare and delicate a beauty, that it seemed that some Greek  statue, or rather one of those pensive and pious knights whom the old  German artists took delight to paint, had condescended to tread awhile  this work-day earth in living flesh and blood. The forehead was very  lofty and smooth, the eyebrows thin and greatly arched (the envious  gallants whispered that something at least of their curve was due to  art, as was also the exceeding smoothness of those delicate cheeks).  The face was somewhat long and thin; the nose aquiline; and the languid  mouth showed, perhaps, too much of the ivory upper teeth; but the  most striking point of the speaker's appearance was the extraordinary  brilliancy of his complexion, which shamed with its whiteness that of  all fair ladies round, save where open on each cheek a bright red spot  gave warning, as did the long thin neck and the taper hands, of sad  possibilities, perhaps not far off; possibilities which all saw with an  inward sigh, except she whose doting glances, as well as her resemblance  to the fair youth, proclaimed her at once his mother, Mrs. Leigh  herself.    Master Frank, for he it was, was dressed in the very extravagance of  the fashion,--not so much from vanity, as from that delicate instinct  of self-respect which would keep some men spruce and spotless from one  year's end to another upon a desert island; \"for,\" as Frank used to say  in his sententious way, \"Mr. Frank Leigh at least beholds me, though  none else be by; and why should I be more discourteous to him than  I permit others to be? Be sure that he who is a Grobian in his own  company, will, sooner or later, become a Grobian in that of his  friends.\"    So Mr. Frank was arrayed spotlessly; but after the latest fashion of  Milan, not in trunk hose and slashed sleeves, nor in \"French standing  collar, treble quadruple daedalian ruff, or stiff-necked rabato, that  had more arches for pride, propped up with wire and timber, than five  London Bridges;\" but in a close-fitting and perfectly plain suit of  dove-color, which set off cunningly the delicate proportions of his  figure, and the delicate hue of his complexion, which was shaded from  the sun by a broad dove-colored Spanish hat, with feather to match,  looped up over the right ear with a pearl brooch, and therein a crowned  E, supposed by the damsels of Bideford to stand for Elizabeth, which  was whispered to be the gift of some most illustrious hand. This same  looping up was not without good reason and purpose prepense; thereby all  the world had full view of a beautiful little ear, which looked as if  it had been cut of cameo, and made, as my Lady Rich once told him, \"to  hearken only to the music of the spheres, or to the chants of cherubim.\"  Behind the said ear was stuck a fresh rose; and the golden hair was all  drawn smoothly back and round to the left temple, whence, tied with a  pink ribbon in a great true lover's knot, a mighty love-lock, \"curled as  it had been laid in press,\" rolled down low upon his bosom. Oh, Frank!  Frank! have you come out on purpose to break the hearts of all Bideford  burghers' daughters? And if so, did you expect to further that triumph  by dyeing that pretty little pointed beard (with shame I report it) of  a bright vermilion? But we know you better, Frank, and so does your  mother; and you are but a masquerading angel after all, in spite of  your knots and your perfumes, and the gold chain round your neck which a  German princess gave you; and the emerald ring on your right fore-finger  which Hatton gave you; and the pair of perfumed gloves in your left  which Sidney's sister gave you; and the silver-hilted Toledo which an  Italian marquis gave you on a certain occasion of which you never choose  to talk, like a prudent and modest gentleman as you are; but of which  the gossips talk, of course, all the more, and whisper that you saved  his life from bravoes--a dozen, at the least; and had that sword for  your reward, and might have had his beautiful sister's hand beside, and  I know not what else; but that you had so many lady-loves already that  you were loath to burden yourself with a fresh one. That, at least, we  know to be a lie, fair Frank; for your heart is as pure this day as when  you knelt in your little crib at Burrough, and said--         \"Four corners to my bed       Four angels round my head;       Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,       Bless the bed that I lie on.\"    And who could doubt it (if being pure themselves, they have instinctive  sympathy with what is pure), who ever looked into those great deep blue  eyes of yours, \"the black fringed curtains of whose azure lids,\"  usually down-dropt as if in deepest thought, you raise slowly, almost  wonderingly each time you speak, as if awakening from some fair dream  whose home is rather in your platonical \"eternal world of supra-sensible  forms,\" than on that work-day earth wherein you nevertheless acquit  yourself so well? There--I must stop describing you, or I shall catch  the infection of your own euphuism, and talk of you as you would have  talked of Sidney or of Spenser, or of that Swan of Avon, whose song  had just begun when yours--but I will not anticipate; my Lady Bath is  waiting to give you her rejoinder.    \"Ah, my silver-tongued scholar! and are you, then, the poet? or have  you been drawing on the inexhaustible bank of your friend Raleigh, or my  cousin Sidney? or has our new Cygnet Immerito lent you a few unpublished  leaves from some fresh Shepherd's Calendar?\"    \"Had either, madam, of that cynosural triad been within call of my  most humble importunities, your ears had been delectate with far nobler  melody.\"    \"But not our eyes with fairer faces, eh? Well, you have chosen your  nymphs, and had good store from whence to pick, I doubt not. Few  young Dulcineas round but must have been glad to take service under so  renowned a captain?\"    \"The only difficulty, gracious countess, has been to know where to fix  the wandering choice of my bewildered eyes, where all alike are fair,  and all alike facund.\"    \"We understand,\" said she, smiling;--         \"Dan Cupid, choosing 'midst his mother's graces,       Himself more fair, made scorn of fairest faces.\"    The young scholar capped her distich forthwith, and bowing to her with a  meaning look,      \"'Then, Goddess, turn,' he cried, 'and veil thy light; Blinded by thine,  what eyes can choose aright?'\"      \"Go, saucy sir,\" said my lady, in high glee: \"the pageant stays your  supreme pleasure.\"    And away went Mr. Frank as master of the revels, to bring up the  'prentices' pageant; while, for his sake, the nymph of Torridge was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18613"],[0,"The Golden Scorpion (#10)"],[1,"of another of correct size had  manufactured a temporary stopper with a small cork to the top of which  he had fixed the Chinese coin with a drawing-pin. His purpose served  he had left the extemporized stopper somewhere in the dispensary.    Stuart's dispensary was merely a curtained recess at one end of the  waiting-room and shortly after entering the house he had occasion to  visit it. Lying upon a shelf among flasks and bottles was the Chinese  coin with the cork still attached. He took it up in order to study  the inscription. Then:    \"Have I cultivated somnambulism!\" he muttered.    Fragments of black sealing-wax adhered to the coin!    Incredulous and half fearful he peered at it closely. He remembered  that the impression upon the wax sealing the mysterious envelope had  had a circular depression in the centre. It had been made by the head  of the drawing-pin!    He found himself at the shelf immediately above that upon which the  coin had lain. A stick of black sealing wax used for sealing medicine  was thrust in beside a bundle of long envelopes in which he was  accustomed to post his Infirmary reports!    One hand raised to his head, Stuart stood endeavouring to marshal his  ideas into some sane order. Then, knowing what he should find, he  raised the green baize curtain hanging from the lower shelf, which  concealed a sort of cupboard containing miscellaneous stores and not  a little rubbish, including a number of empty cardboard boxes.    A rectangular strip had been roughly cut from the lid of the topmost  box!    The mysterious envelope and its contents, the wax and the seal--all  had come from his own dispensary!          CHAPTER X    \"CLOSE YOUR SHUTTERS AT NIGHT\"      Inspector Dunbar stood in the little dispensary tapping his teeth with  the end of a fountain-pen.    \"The last time he visited you, doctor--the time when he gave you the  envelope--did the cabman wait here in the waiting-room?\"    \"He did--yes. He came after my ordinary consulting hours and I was at  supper, I remember, as I am compelled to dine early.\"    \"He would be in here alone?\"    \"Yes. No one else was in the room.\"    \"Would he have had time to find the box, cut out the piece of  cardboard from the lid, put it in the envelope and seal it?\"    \"Ample time. But what could be his object? And why mark the envelope  30?\"    \"It was in your consulting-room that he asked you to take charge of  the envelope?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Might I take a peep at the consulting room?\"    \"Certainly, Inspector.\"    From the waiting-room they went up a short flight of stairs into the  small apartment in which Stuart saw his patients. Dunbar looked slowly  about him, standing in the middle of the room, then crossed and stared  out of the window into the narrow lane below.    \"Where were you when he gave you the envelope?\" he snapped suddenly.    \"At the table,\" replied Stuart with surprise.    \"Was the table-lamp alight?\"    \"Yes. I always light it when seeing patients.\"    \"Did you take the letter into the study to seal it in the other  envelope?\"    \"I did, and he came along and witnessed me do it.\"    \"Ah,\" said Dunbar, and scribbled busily in his note-book. \"We are  badly tied at Scotland Yard, doctor, and this case looks like being  another for which somebody else will reap the credit. I am going to  make a request that will surprise you.\"    He tore a leaf out of the book and folded it carefully.    \"I am going to ask you to seal up something and lock it away! But I  don't think you'll be troubled by cowled burglars or beautiful women  because of it. On this piece of paper I have written--_a\"_--he ticked  off the points on his fingers: \"what I believe to be the name of the  man who cut out the cardboard and sealed it in an envelope; _b_: the  name of the cabman; and, _c_: the name of the man who rang me up here  last night and gave me information which had only just reached the  Commissioner. I'll ask you to lock it away until it's wanted, doctor.\"    \"Certainly, if you wish it,\" replied Stuart. \"Come into the study and  you shall see me do as you direct. I may add that the object to be  served is not apparent to me.\"    Entering the study, he took an envelope, enclosed the piece of paper,  sealed the lapel and locked the envelope in the same drawer of the  bureau which once had contained that marked 30.    \"Mlle. Dorian has a duplicate key to this drawer.\" he said. \"Are you  prepared to take the chance?\"    \"Quite,\" replied Dunbar, smiling; \"although my information is worth  more than that which she risked so much to steal.\"    \"It's most astounding. At every step the darkness increases. Why  should _anyone_ have asked me to lock up a blank piece of cardboard?\"    \"Why, indeed,\" murmured Dunbar. \"Well, I may as well get back. I am  expecting a report from Sowerby. Look after yourself, sir. I'm  inclined to think your pretty patient was talking square when she told  you there might be danger.\"    Stuart met the glance of the tawny eyes.    \"What d'you mean, Inspector? Why should _I_ be in danger?\"    \"Because,\" replied Inspector Dunbar, \"if 'The Scorpion' is a poisoner,  as the chief seems to think, there's really only one man in England he  has to fear, and that man is Dr. Keppel Stuart.\"    When the Inspector had taken his departure Stuart stood for a long  time staring out of the study window at the little lawn with its  bordering of high neatly-trimmed privet above which at intervals  arose the mop crowns of dwarf acacias. A spell of warm weather seemed  at last to have begun, and clouds of gnats floated over the grass,  their minute wings glittering in the sunshine. Despite the nearness of  teeming streets, this was a backwater of London's stream.    He sighed and returned to some work which the visit of the Scotland  Yard man had interrupted.    Later in the afternoon he had occasion to visit the institution to  which he had recently been appointed as medical officer, and in  contemplation of the squalor through which his steps led him he sought  forgetfulness of the Scorpion problem--and of the dark eyes of Mlle.  Dorian. He was not entirely successful, and returning by a different  route he lost himself in memories which were sweetly mournful.    A taxicab passed him, moving slowly very close to the pavement. He  scarcely noted it until it had proceeded some distance ahead of him.  Then its slow progress so near to the pavement at last attracted his  attention, and he stared vacantly towards the closed vehicle.    Mlle. Dorian was leaning out of the window and looking back at him!    Stuart's heart leapt high. For an instant he paused, then began to  walk rapidly after the retreating vehicle. Perceiving that she had  attracted his attention, the girl extended a white-gloved hand from  the window and dropped a note upon the edge of the pavement.  Immediately she withdrew into the vehicle--which moved away at  accelerated speed, swung around the next corner and was gone.    Stuart ran forward and picked up the note. Without pausing to read it,  he pressed on to the corner. The cab was already two hundred yards  away, and he recognized pursuit to be out of the question. The streets  were almost deserted at the moment, and no one apparently had  witnessed the episode. He unfolded the sheet of plain note-paper,  faintly perfumed with jasmine, and read the following, written in an  uneven feminine hand:    \"Close your shutters at night. Do not think too bad of me.\"          CHAPTER XI    THE BLUE RAY      Dusk found Stuart in a singular frame of mind. He was torn between  duty--or what he conceived to be his duty--to the community, and ...  something else. A messenger from New Scotland Yard had brought him a  bundle of documents relating to the case of Sir Frank Narcombe, and  a smaller packet touching upon the sudden end of Henrik Ericksen, the  Norwegian electrician, and the equally unexpected death of the Grand  Duke Ivan. There were medical certificates, proceedings of coroners,  reports of detectives, evidence of specialists and statements of  friends, relatives and servants of the deceased. A proper examination  of all the documents represented many hours of close study.    Stuart was flattered by the opinion held of his ability by the  Assistant Commissioner, but dubious of his chance of detecting any  flaw in the evidence which had escaped the scrutiny of so many highly  trained observers.    He paced the study restlessly. Although more than six hours had  elapsed, he had not communicated to Scotland Yard the fact of his  having seen Mlle. Dorian that afternoon. A hundred times he had read  the message, although he knew it by heart, knew the form of every  letter, the odd crossing of the _t'_s and the splashy dotting of  the _i_'s.    If only he could have taken counsel with someone--with someone not  bound to act upon such information--it would have relieved his mental  stress. His ideas were so chaotic that he felt himself to be incapable  of approaching the task presented by the pile of papers lying upon his  table.    The night was pleasantly warm and the sky cloudless. Often enough he  found himself glancing toward the opened French windows, and once he  had peered closely across into the belt of shadow below the hedge,  thinking that he had detected something which moved there. Stepping  to the window, the slinking shape had emerged into the moonlight--and  had proclaimed itself to be that of a black cat!    Yet he had been sorely tempted to act upon the advice so strangely  offered. He refrained from doing so, however, reflecting that to spend  his evenings with closed and barred shutters now that a spell of hot  weather seemed to be imminent would be insufferable. Up and down the  room he paced tirelessly, always confronted by the eternal problem.    Forcing himself at last to begin work if only as a sedative, he filled  and lighted his pipe, turned off the centre lamp and lighted the  reading lamp upon his table."]]]
