[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17760"],[0,"How to Enjoy Paris in 1842 (#10)"],[1," Lidonius Appolinarus, who wrote only fifty years after the  death of Pharamond persists that he and his three successors, who were  all predecessors of Clovis, were only kings reigning over a portion of  Gaul, and resigned their sovereignties at the retirement of the Romans.  Clovis was celebrated as one of the greatest warriors of the period in  which he lived; in the year 500 he slew Alaric King of the Visigoths in  single combat in the plain of Vouille, near Poitou, and afterwards  several other petty kings, thereby adding considerably to his dominions.  In 508 he fixed his residence in Paris, and died there in 511, and was  buried in a church called St. Peter and St. Paul, since styled St.  Genevieve. He was called the Most Christian King. The Pope having no  confidence in the professions of any other monarch at that time, Clovis  is synonymous with the name of Louis, as the latter was formerly written  Llouis, the double l signifying in the Celtic language cl, and  pronounced in that manner at present in Welsh, as Llandovery, Llandilo,  etc., have the sound of Clandovery, Clandilo, etc., whilst the v in  Clovis has in more modern times been transformed into a u, as in all old  writings the u and the v had the same signification; hence it will be  found that Clovis and Llouis are the same word. His government being  divided amongst his four sons, Childebert received the portion in which  Paris was situated, and was styled King of Paris, which was only  retained by a few of his successors, who assumed that of King of Gaul,  or of France. The power of the monarch at that period was much  restrained, by a class of men called Leudes, Anstrutions, or faithful,  being companions in arms of the king, and sharing with him whatever  lands or booty might be gained by conquest. As a proof of the tenacity  of these gentry as to an equitable division of the spoil, when Clovis  had taken Rheims, he demanded as an act of grace from his companions in  arms, that they would grant him a precious vase for which he had  conceived a peculiar predilection; his request was accorded by his  associates, except one, who gave the vase a violent blow with his  hatchet, saying, \"No, thou shalt not have any thing beyond what thy lot  awards thee.\" Even under the dominion of the Romans there were dukes who  had a certain number of troops or armed men in the district where they  governed, and their power was arbitrary and they had counts under them  who also had a certain number of men subjected to their orders;  sometimes these nobles carried rapine, pillage and slaughter into each  other's territories, when the government had devolved upon the Franks;  and the king took no notice of their misdeeds, as long as they observed  a certain fealty towards him, and in some instances they put aside the  monarch if he acted in such a manner as to trench upon what they  considered their privileges. A third power soon began to assume a high  authority, which consisted of the bishops, who had greatly aided the  Francs in their invasion of Gaul by their influence and intrigues, and  obtained as reward considerable grants of lands and temporal power; and  in their dioceses they exercised a sovereign will, and on account of  their possessing some instruction they maintained a certain influence  over the ignorant nobility who had in some degree a sort of  superstitious awe of them, as they were regarded as the emissaries of  saints. Under the Romans the Gauls were considered a moral people,  having become Christians in consequence of the persevering endeavours of  the missionary prelates, whilst churches were founded and a purity of  faith disseminated; taught by the Romans, a love of the arts and  sciences was engendered amongst the Gauls, and much talent was elicited  from them, philosophy, physic, mathematics, jurisprudence, poetry, and  above all eloquence, had their respective professors of no mean  abilities from amongst the natives; one named Julius Florens is styled  by Quintilian the Prince of Eloquence. In fact a brilliant era appeared  as if beginning to dawn throughout the greater portion of Gaul,  academies were establishing, learning was revered, when suddenly every  spark of refinement and civilisation was banished, by the successful  aggression and permanent occupation of the country by hordes of  barbarians; the natives being obliged to have recourse to arms for their  defence against the common enemy, and the constant excitement of  continued hostility with their ferocious oppressors, afforded no time  for study nor cultivation of the arts. Clovis, however, during his reign  improved Paris, and was converted to christianity by St. Vedast.  Clotilda, his wife, and niece to Gondebaud, king of Burgundy, was  principally instrumental to the conversion of her husband. Indeed,  amidst their ferocity and barbarism some of the early Frank kings showed  much respect for religion and morality, as is proved by an ordonnance of  Childebert in the year 554; commanding his subjects to destroy wherever  they might be found all idols dedicated to the devil; also forbidding  all disorderly conduct committed in the nights of the eves of _fetes_,  such as Christmas and Easter, when singing, drinking, and other excesses  were committed; women were also ordered to discontinue going about the  country dancing on a Sunday, as it was a practice offensive to God. It  appears certainly very singular that a comparatively barbarous king in  the sixth century should prohibit dancing of a Sunday as a desecration  of the Sabbath, and that in the nineteenth century there should be more  dancing on a Sunday than on any other day in the week, at a period which  is arrived at the highest state of civilisation, and under the reign of  a most enlightened monarch. But although Clovis and Childebert displayed  much enthusiasm in the cause of christianity, their career was marked  with every cruelty incidental to conquest, as wherever they bore their  victorious arms, murder, rapine, and robbery stained their diabolical  course; but they thought that they expiated their crimes by building  churches. Hence Clovis in 508 founded the first erected in Paris  dedicated to St. Peter and St. Paul, afterwards called St. Genevieve,  and on its site now stands the Pantheon. Childebert in 558 built the  church of St. Germain des Pres, which is still standing and much  frequented; it was at first called St. Vincent and St. Croix, and he  endowed it so richly with the treasures he had stolen from other  countries, that it was called the golden palace of St. Germain.  Chilperic imitating his predecessors, hoping to absolve himself of his  enormous crimes, in the year 606 founded the very interesting and  curious church of St. Germain, opposite the Louvre, and still an object  of admiration to the lover of antiquity. His wife Fredegonde, imagining  no doubt by that act he had made his peace for the other world, thought  that the sooner he went there the better, before he committed any  farther sins, and had him assassinated that she might the more  conveniently pursue her own course of iniquity; perhaps never was the  page of history blackened by such a list of atrocities committed by  woman as those perpetrated by her and her rival Queen Brunehault, who  was ultimately tied to the tail of a wild horse and torn to pieces in  613. Paris, however, notwithstanding the wickedness, injustice, and  cruelty of its rulers, continued to increase, and would no doubt have  become a prosperous city, had it not been for the incursions of the  Normands, who in the ninth century entered Paris, burnt some of the  churches, and meeting with scarcely any resistance, made themselves  masters of all they could find, whilst the Emperor Charles the Bald, at  the head of an army, had the pusillanimity to treat with them, and  finally to give them seven thousand pounds of silver to quit Paris,  which was only an encouragement for them to return, which they did in a  few years after, carrying devastation wherever they appeared, the poor  citizens of Paris being obliged to save their lives by flight, leaving  all their property to the mercy of the brigands. At length, the  Parisians finding that there was no security either for themselves or  their possessions, prevailed on Charles the Bald to give the requisite  orders for fortifying the city, which was so far accomplished that it  resisted the attacks of the Normans for thirteen months, who as  constantly laid siege to the grand tower which was its principal  defence, without being able to take it; when at last Charles the Fat in  887 proved as weak as his predecessors, and although he was encamped  with his army at Montmartre, consented to give the barbarians fourteen  thousand marks of silver to get rid of them, and they quitted Paris to  go and pillage other parts of France, but as by the treaty they were not  allowed to pass the bridges, in order to ascend the Seine they were  obliged to carry their vessels over the land for about two thousand  yards and again launch them for the purpose of committing farther  depredations. From this period Paris was freed from the attacks of the  the Normans, yet commerce made but slow progress having constant  obstructions arising, to impede its prosperity. Paris having for a long  time ceased to be the royal residence, was no longer considered as the  capital, Charlemagne passed but a very short period of time there,  residing mostly at Aix-la-Chapelle and Ratisbon, and although he founded  many noble institutions in different parts of France, Paris derived but  little benefit from his talents, and his immediate successors displayed  such imbecility of purpose that they suffered their kingdom to become  the prey to marauders. Learning advanced but slowly, although there were  some schools at Paris which, elicited a few authors; amongst the rest  one named Abbon, who wrote a poem in latin upon the siege of Paris by  the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17763"],[0,"The Mystery of the Hasty Arrow (#10)"],[1,"of strong repulsion in the direction of the gallery and  started to his feet. Mr. Gryce did the same, and together they crossed  the court. But they got no further at this time than the foot of the  staircase. Coroner Price, by an extra effort which seemed to be called  for by the circumstances, had succeeded in picking up a jury from the  people collected on the street, and entering at this moment, created a  diversion which effectively postponed the detective's examination of his  new witness.    When the opportunity came for resuming it, so much time had elapsed that  Mr. Gryce looked for some decided change in the manner or bearing of the  man who, unfortunately for his purposes, had thus been given a quiet hour  in which to think. Better, much better, for the cause of justice, if he  could have pushed him to the point at once, harried him, as it were, in  hot blood. Now he might find him more difficult.    But when, in company with the Coroner, who now found himself free to  assist him in his hunt for witnesses, he reapproached the Englishman  sitting as before alone on his bench, it was to find him to all  appearance in the same mind in which he had left him. He wore the same  look and followed with the same reluctance when he was made to understand  that the time had now come for him to show just where he was standing  when that arrow was sped on its death-course. And greatly impressed by  this fact, which in a way contradicted all his expectations, Mr. Gryce  trod slowly after, watching with the keenest interest to see whether, on  reaching the top of the steps, this man upon whose testimony so much  depended would turn toward the southern gallery where the girl had  fallen, or toward the northern one, where Correy had found the bow.    It looked as if he were going to the left, for his head turned that way  as he cleared the final step. But his body soon swayed aside in the other  direction, and by the time the old detective had himself reached the  landing, Travis, closely accompanied by the Coroner, had passed through  the first of the three arches leading to that especial section of the  gallery where the concealing tapestry hung.    \"The man is honest,\" was Mr. Gryce's first thought. \"He is going to show  us the bow and confess to what was undoubtedly an accident.\" But Mr.  Gryce felt more or less ready to modify this impromptu conclusion when,  on passing through the arch himself he came upon the young man still  standing in Section VI, with his eyes on the opposite gallery and his  whole frame trembling with emotion.    \"Is she--the young lady who was shot--still lying on those cold stones  alone, forsaken and----\"    Mr. Gryce knew misery when he saw it. This man had not overstated the  case when he had said \"I suffer.\" But the cause! To what could this  excess of sensibility be attributed? To remorse or to an exaggerated  personal repulsion? It looked like remorse, but that there might be no  doubt as to this, Mr. Gryce hastened to assure the Englishman that on the  departure of the jury the body had been removed to one of the inner  rooms. The relief which this gave to Mr. Travis was evident. He showed no  further reluctance to proceed and was indeed the first of the three to  enter where the great drapery hung, flanked by the two immense vases.  Would he pause before it or hurry by into the broad corridor in front? If  he hurried by, what would become of their now secretly accepted theory?    But he did not hurry by; that is, he did not pass beyond the upper end,  but stopped when he got there and looked back with an air of extreme  deprecation at the two officials.    \"Have we arrived?\" asked Mr. Gryce, his suspicions all returning, for the  man had stepped aside from the drapery and was standing in a spot  conspicuously open to view even from the lower court.    The Englishman nodded; whereupon Mr. Gryce, approaching to his side,  exclaimed in evident doubt:    \"You were standing _here_? When? Not at the moment the young girl fell,  or you would have been seen by some one, if not by everyone, in the  building. I want you to take the exact place you occupied when you first  learned that something had gone wrong in the opposite gallery.\"    The stranger's distress grew. With a show of indecision scarcely  calculated to inspire confidence in either of the two men watching him,  he moved now here and now there till he finally came to a standstill  close by the pedestal--so close, indeed, to its inner corner that he was  almost in a line with its rear.    \"It was here,\" he declared with a gulp of real feeling. \"I am sure I am  right now. I had just stepped out----\"    \"From behind the tapestry?\"    \"No.\" His blank astonishment at the quickness with which he had been  caught up left him staring for a moment at the speaker, before he  added:    \"From behind the pedestal. The--the vase, as you see, is a very curious  one. I wanted to look at it from all sides.\"    Without a word the Coroner slipped past him and entering the narrow space  behind the pedestal took a look up at the vase from his present cramped  position.    As he did this, two things happened: first Sweetwater, who had stolen  upon the scene, possibly at some intimation from Mr. Gryce, took a step  toward them which brought him in alignment with the Englishman, of whose  height in comparison with his own he seemed to take careful note; and  secondly, the sensitive skin of the foreigner flushed red again as he  noticed the Coroner's sarcastic smile, and heard his dry remark:    \"One gets a better view here of the opposite gallery than of the vase  perched so high overhead. Had you wished to look at those ladies, without  being seen by them, you could hardly have found a better loophole than  the one made by the curving in of this great vase toward its base.\" Then  quickly: \"You surely took one look their way; that would be only  natural.\"    The answer Mr. Travis gave was certainly unexpected.    \"It was after I came out that I saw them,\" he stammered. \"There were two  ladies, one tall and one very young and slight. The older lady was  stepping toward the front, the other entering from behind. As I looked,  the younger made a dash and ran by the first lady. Then----\"    \"Proceed, Mr. Travis. Your emotion is very natural; but it is imperative  that we hear all you have to tell us. She ran by the older lady, and  then?\"    Still silence. The Englishman appeared to be looking at Coroner Price,  who in speaking emerged from behind the pedestal; but it is doubtful if  he saw him. A tear was in his eye--a tear!    Seeing it, Mr. Gryce felt a movement of compassion, and thinking to help  him, said kindly enough:    \"Was it so very dreadful?\"    The answer came with great simplicity:    \"Yes. One minute she was all life and gaiety; the next she was lying  outstretched on the hard floor.\"    \"And you?\"    Again that look of ingenuous surprise.    \"I don't remember about myself,\" he said. \"I was thinking too much about  her. I never saw anyone killed before.\"    \"Killed? Why do you say killed? You say you saw her fall, but how did you  know she was killed?\"    \"I saw the arrow in her breast. As she fell backward, I saw the arrow.\"    As he uttered these words, the three men watching him perceived the sweat  start out on his forehead, and his eyes take on a glassy stare. It was as  if he were again in gaze upon that image of youthful loveliness falling  to the ground with the arrow of death in her heart. The effect was  strangely moving. To see this event reflected as it were in horror from  this man's consciousness made it appear more real and much more  impressive than when contemplated directly. Why? Had remorse given it its  poignancy? Had it been his own hand which had directed this arrow from  behind the pedestal? If not, why this ghastly display of an emotion so  far beyond what might be expected from the most sentimental of onlookers?    In an endeavor to clear the situation, the Coroner intervened with the  following question:    \"Have you ever seen a shot made by a bow and arrow before, Mr. Travis?  Archery-practice, I mean. Or--well, the shooting of wild animals in  India, Africa or elsewhere?\"    \"Oh, yes. I come from a country where the bow and arrow are used. But I  never shoot. I can only speak of what I have seen others do.\"    \"That is sufficient. You ought to be able to tell, then, from what  direction this arrow came.\"    \"It--it must have come from this side of the gallery. Not from this  section, as you call it, but from some one of the other open places along  here.\"    \"Why not from this one?\"    \"Because there was nobody here but me,\" was the simple and seemingly  ingenuous answer.    It gave them an unexpected surprise. Innocence would speak in this  fashion. But then the bow--the bow which was lying not a dozen feet from  where they stood! Nothing could eliminate that bow.    After a short consultation between themselves, which the Englishman  seemed not to notice, the Coroner addressed him with the soothing remark:    \"Mr. Travis, you must not misunderstand me. The accident which has  occurred (we will not yet say crime) is of so serious a nature that it is  imperative for us to get at the exact facts. Only yourself and one other  person whom we know can supply them. I allude to the lady you saw, first  in front of and then behind the girl who was shot. Her story has been  told. Yours will doubtless coincide with it. May I ask you, then, to  satisfy us on a point you were in a better position than herself to take  note of. It is this: When the young girl gave that bound forward of which  you both speak, did she make straight for the railing in front, or did  she approach it in a diagonal direction?\"    \"I do not know. You distress me very much. I was not thinking of anything  like that. Why should I think of anything so immaterial. She came--I saw  her smiling, beaming with joy, a picture of lovely youth--then"]]]
