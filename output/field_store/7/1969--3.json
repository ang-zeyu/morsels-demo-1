I can not take you with me, dear child, for it is  forbidden on pain of death to bring mortals to the assembly, nor can I  leave you here in this lonely wood.\"    To this Marianna replied, \"Do not fear, dear father. Give me but yon  crystal flask of the water of healing, and I shall go forth into the  world until it is time for you to return again. Perhaps I shall discover  somebody who can tell me the meaning of this locket, or the history of  my dear mother.\"    So the dwarf took his knotted staff, and went away over hill, over dale  to the Golden Mountain.    Then Marianna took the crystal flask of the water of healing, and walked  boldly out of the wood into the wide, wide world. It was the middle of  the spring, the ice and snow had all disappeared; the trees were putting  forth their leaves, and there were clusters of primroses by the  roadside. In the swaying, rustling heart of a great elm tree, a little  thrush was singing. Through cities and towns went lovely Marianna,  bringing good cheer to the helpless and the sick, and curing all who  came to her, rich and poor, with the wonderful water of healing. But  never did she find anybody who could tell her about the gold heart with  the diamond crown.    Now it came to pass that, as Marianna was one day walking through a  village in the heart of the Adamant Mountains, a ragged old woman  besought her with tears to come to a hamlet which stood at the head of a  high and dangerous path. Touched by the old woman's supplication,  Marianna followed her to the hamlet, and found in a wretched hut, lying  on a wretched bed, a beautiful young peasant girl dying of a fever. So  Marianna touched the girl with the water of healing, and in an instant  she became well and strong.    \"Dear lady,\" said the peasant girl, pressing Marianna's hand to her  lips, \"how sweet and kind thou art! Great is the debt I owe thee.\"    And as the girl poured out her thanks, Marianna heard a faint \"chirp,  chirp,\" and looking down, beheld a little yellow bird crouching on the  hearthstone. Every now and then he hid his head under his wings and  cried unhappily. It was the yellow bird which had brought the message  from the Emperor of the Elves.    \"Poor little bird,\" said Marianna, bending down and taking him up in her  hands, \"why criest thou so mournfully? Who hath done thee harm?\"    But the bird uttered only a forlorn little cry, and hid his head again  under his wings.    \"I found him on the rocks at the mountaintop yesterday,\" said the  mother. \"Someone has wounded him. His wing is broken.\"    And she put the bird on the floor of the house and bade Marianna watch  how he fluttered trailing a wing in the dust. Again Marianna stooped,  and picking up the bird, touched the wounded wing with the water of  healing. Scarcely had she done so, when the yellow bird burst into a  joyous and golden song, and flying to the window, beat madly against the  panes. Then the peasant girl threw open the casement, and the yellow  bird flew out into the streaming sun.    \"He is gone forever,\" said the peasant girl.    \"Nay, he returns,\" said Marianna, gently, as the yellow bird flew back  and perched in the sheltering bower of Marianna's arms. Then,  accompanied by the peasant girl and the yellow bird, who flew singing  before her, Marianna went down the dangerous path to the high road in  the valley. When they reached the foot of the path, the peasant girl  cried:--    \"Farewell, dear Marianna; may it some day be mine to repay thee!\"    Into the world again went Marianna, and with her went the yellow bird.  Presently she came to the fairest land which she had ever seen, a land  of rolling fields, little hills, and rivers bordered with pale willow  trees. This pleasant land, unknown to Marianna, was part of her father's  kingdom, and she was really its queen because her father had been the  last rightful king.    Now while Marianna had been in the forest, the wicked nobleman who had  stolen the kingdom from Marianna's father had died, leaving his brother  Garabin in charge of the kingdom and of the interests of his little son,  Prince Desire. This Garabin, however, taking advantage of the youth and  helplessness of his nephew, had himself assumed the state and airs of  king. For some time he had enjoyed undisturbed the possession of his  stolen throne; but as Desire grew taller and stronger every year,  Garabin began to fear the day when he would be compelled to resign in  favor of his nephew.    When the Prince reached his twentieth year, Garabin would certainly have  killed him openly had he dared; but, fearing the people, he resolved to  use secret methods, and bribed a cruel magician to afflict poor Desire  with a deadly and mysterious malady. Of this malady, Desire was slowly  dying, for no medicine could cure him or even give him any relief from  his constant pain. Every morning the cruel Garabin, in the hope of  finding his nephew dead, would go to the sick room; and you may be sure  that his wicked heart rejoiced when he found the Prince weaker and more  feverish.    Garabin had just returned from a visit to the Prince, who was rapidly  failing, when the Captain of the Castle Guard came to him with the news  that the wonderful Marianna had arrived in the kingdom. The King gave  orders that she be brought before him. So Marianna, walking between two  halberdiers and followed across the courtyard by crowds of curious  people, was led before the King. The little yellow bird sat on  Marianna's shoulder, and never did maiden appear lovelier or more  gentle.    Scarcely had Garabin set eyes on Marianna, when he caught sight of the  golden locket which she wore about her neck. Had he not been very old  and crafty, he would have started from his golden throne, for he knew  that the little golden heart set with diamonds had been one of the crown  jewels, and that therefore Marianna must be the missing Princess, and  rightful queen of the kingdom.    What was he to do? If he refused to let Marianna help the Prince, the  people might begin to suspect him, and start a revolution which would  thrust him from his throne; if he allowed Marianna to cure the Prince,  the Prince would certainly demand the kingdom on his twenty-first  birthday. What was he to do with Marianna, whose right to the throne was  superior even to his nephew's? Perplexed, and with fear in his heart,  the King sought the cruel magician who had cast the spell on Desire.    The magician lived in a gloomy tower, and had an enchanted black dog  that he fed with flaming coals. He listened to Garabin's story, stirring  a great cauldron all the while, and said, \"Do not fear. I will destroy  both claimants to the throne at once.\"    Garabin rubbed his hands together with glee.    \"To-night I shall cast a spell of sleep on Marianna, steal the crystal  flask, empty it of the water of healing, and refill it with a liquid  which will cause death within a night and a day. I shall then replace  the flask before Marianna wakes. You will allow Marianna to visit the  Prince; she will touch him with the deadly water, and the Prince will  die. You can then try Marianna for having killed the Prince, and condemn  her to be thrown from the precipice.\"    So pleased was Garabin with this horrid plot, that he could have danced  for joy. That very night, the magician filled Marianna's flask with the  poisonous water, and departed, thinking that nobody had noticed him. The  yellow bird, however, had seen everything, and followed the magician to  note where he hid the real water of healing.    The next morning Marianna was once more led before the King.    \"Welcome, thrice welcome, lovely maiden,\" said Garabin with the most  dreadful hypocrisy. \"I have long hoped that you would turn your  footsteps hither, for my poor dear nephew, Prince Desire, only son of  the late King, has been ill for some months of a malady no physician can  cure. Perhaps you can cure him with the water of healing.\"    Marianna replied that she would do her best to help the Prince; so the  Court Chamberlain gave her his arm, and escorted her to the Prince's  sick room. The King and many courtiers followed after him.    Desire lay in a great old-fashioned bed, his face flushed with fever. So  weak was the poor Prince, that he could scarcely lift his head to look  at his visitors. A great pity swept over Marianna's heart the instant  she saw him; as for Desire, he fell madly in love with Marianna at first  sight.    Now just as Marianna bent over the Prince to touch his forehead with the  water of healing, the yellow bird screamed and cried as madly as if he  were caught in a net. Marianna looked at the crystal flask. Nothing  seemed changed; the water within seemed as pure and diamond-like as  ever. She touched the Prince with the liquid. Alas, in a moment, so  terrible was the magician's poison that the Prince turned white as the  driven snow, and fell back on the pillows insensible. The lookers-on,  who had expected to see him spring up entirely cured, began to murmur,  and Marianna herself, terrified at what had happened, let fall the  flask, which broke into a thousand sparkling pieces.    Suddenly, Garabin cried at the top of his voice, \"Seize the witch; she  has killed the Prince!\"    Presently there was a great confusion, rough hands seized Marianna, and  somebody caught the yellow bird. The Prince remained insensible on the  bed. At high noon, a trial was held, and since the doctors declared that  the Prince was dying, Marianna was condemned to be thrown from the  precipice. When somebody asked about the yellow bird, Garabin laughed,  and gave orders that the cook should wring its neck, and toss it to the  cat.    So Marianna was hurried to a dark prison-room and loaded with chains,  and the yellow bird was taken to the castle kitchen, and given to the  cook.    \"Here, you"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19209"],[0,"The Andes and the Amazon; Or, Across the Continent of South America (#10)"],[1,"rooms--small enough to be called  niches--surround the paved court-yard, which is entered from the street  by a broad doorway. Within this court is sometimes a fountain or  flower-plot. Around it are arches or pillars supporting a gallery, which  is the passage-way to the apartments of the second story. All the rooms  are floored with large square bricks. With few exceptions, the only  windows are folding glass doors leading to balconies overhanging the  pavement. The tiled roofs project far over into the street, and from  these project still farther uncouth water-spouts, such as used to be  seen in Rio Janeiro, but have now been banished to the antiquarian  museum. Only three or four private residences rise above two stories.  The shops are small affairs--akin to the cupboards of Damascene  merchants; half a dozen modern ladies can keep out any more customers.  The door serves as entrance, exit, window, and show-case. The finest  structures cluster around the plazas. Here are the public buildings,  some of them dating back to the times of Philip II. They are modeled  after the old Spanish style; there is scarcely a fragment of Gothic  architecture. They are built of large brick, or a dark volcanic stone  from Pichincha.    [Illustration: Palacio de Gobierno--Capitol.]    The Government House, which serves at once as \"White House\" and Capitol,  is an imposing edifice fronting the Grand Plaza, and adorned with a fine  colonnade. On its right rises the cathedral; on the left stands the  unpretending palace of the nuncio. The former would be called beautiful  were it kept in repair; it has a splendid marble porch, and a terrace  with carved stone balustrade. The view above was taken from this  terrace. The finest facade is presented by the old Jesuit church, which  has an elaborate front of porphyry. The Church of San Francisco, built  by the treasures of Atahuallpa, discovered by an Indian named Catuna, is  the richest. It is surmounted by two lofty towers, and the interior is a  perfect blaze of gilding. The monastery attached to it is one of the  largest in the world, but the greater part of it is in ruins, and one of  the wings is used as a barrack. Those unsightly, unadorned convents,  which cling to every church save the cathedral, have neutralized nearly  all architectural effect.          CHAPTER IV.         Population of       Quito.--Dress.--Manners.--Character.--Commerce.--Agriculture.       --Manufactures.--Arts.--Education.--Amusements.--Quito Ladies.      Quitonians claim for their capital eighty thousand inhabitants; but when  we consider that one fourth of the city is covered with ecclesiastical  buildings, and that the dwelling-houses are but two stories high, we see  that there is not room for more than half that number. From thirty  thousand to forty thousand is the estimate of the venerable Dr. Jameson,  who has resided here for a generation.[22] Census taking is as difficult  as in Constantinople; the people hide themselves to escape taxation. The  women far outnumber the men. The white population--a stiff aristocracy  of eight thousand souls--is of Spanish descent, but not more than half a  dozen can boast of pure blood. The coarse black hair, prominent  cheek-bones, and low foreheads, reveal an Indian alliance. This is the  governing class; from its ranks come those uneasy politicians who make  laws for other people to obey, and hatch revolutions when a rival party  is in power. They are blessed with fair mental capacity, quick  perception, and uncommon civility; but they lack education and industry,  energy and perseverance. Their wealth, which is not great, consists  mainly in _haciendas_, yielding grain, cotton, and cattle. The Aguirre  family is one of the noblest and wealthiest in the city; their mansion  is on the Grand Plaza, facing the Capitol. The pure Indians of Quito  number perhaps 10,000; not all those seen in the city are citizens, as  many _serranos_, or mountaineers, come in to sell produce. They are the  serfs that do the drudgery of the republic; they are the tillers of the  soil, and beasts of burden. Many sell themselves for money in advance,  and then are ever kept in debt. Excepting a few Zambos (the children of  Indians and Negroes), and a very few foreigners and Negroes, the  remainder, constituting the bulk of the population, are Cholos--the  offspring of whites and Indians. They are not strictly half-breeds, for  the Indian element stands out most prominent. Though a mixed race, they  are far superior to their progenitors in enterprise and intelligence.  They are the soldiers, artisans, and tradesmen who keep up the only  signs of life in Quito. \"I know not the reason,\" says Darwin, \"but men  of such origin seldom have a good expression of countenance.\" This may  be true on the pampas, but Quito, where there is every imaginable  mixture of Indian and Spaniard, is wonderfully free from ugly features.  It may be owing to the more peaceful and civilized history of this  mountain city.    [Footnote 22: Spanish rhetoric is given to exaggeration. \"All their  geese are swans.\" A Peruvian assured us that Cuzco contained 200,000  souls. It is, in fact, about as large as Quito; Gibbon says 20,000.]    As to dress, black is the color of etiquette, but is not so national as  in Madrid. The upper class follow _la mode de Paris_, gentlemen adding  the classic cloak of Old Spain. This modern toga fits an Ecuadorian  admirably; it favors habits of inactivity, preventing the arms from  doing any thing, and covers a multitude of sins, especially pride and  poverty. The _poncho_, so peculiar to the West Coast and to the Gauchos  of Buenos Ayres, is a piece of cloth of divers colors, with a slit in  the centre, through which the head is passed. It is the only variable  article of the wardrobe. It is an excellent riding habit, and is made of  heavy woolen for mountain travel, and of silk or cotton for warmer  altitudes. No gentleman will be seen walking in the streets of Quito  under a poncho. Hence citizens are divided into men with ponchos, and  gentlemen with cloaks. The panuelon is the most essential article of  female gear. It answers to the mantilla of the mother country, though it  is not worn so gracefully as on the banks of the Tagus. Andean ladies  are not troubled with the distressing fluctuations in the style of hats;  a bonnet in Quito is as much out of place as a turban in New York. When  the daughter of our late minister resident appeared in the cathedral  with one, the innovation was the subject of severe remark. The Spanish  hair is the glory of the sex. It is thick and black (red, being a  rarity, is considered a beauty), and is braided in two long tresses. A  silk dress, satin shoes, and fancy jewelry complete the visible attire  of the belles of Quito.    The ordinary costume of the Indians and Cholos consists of a coarse  cotton shirt and drawers, and silk, cotton, or woolen poncho of native  manufacture, the females adding a short petticoat, generally of a light  blue or \"butter-nut\" color, belted around the waist with a figured  woolen belt woven by themselves. The head, arms, legs, and feet are  often bare, but, by those who can afford it, the head is covered with a  straw or white felt broad-brim, and the feet protected by sandals,  called _alpargates_, made of the fibres of the aloe. They are very fond  of bracelets and necklaces. Infants are usually swathed from neck to  feet with a broad strip of cloth, so that they look like live mummies.    Quitonians put us to shame by their unequaled courtesy, cordiality, and  good-nature, and are not far below the grave and decorous Castilian in  dignified politeness.[23]    [Footnote 23: \"I must express my admiration at the natural politeness of  almost every Chileno. We met, near Mendoza, a little and very fat  negress, riding astride on a mule. She had a _goitre_ so enormous that  it was scarcely possible to avoid gazing at her for a moment; but my two  companions almost instantly, by way of apology, made the common salute  of the country by taking off their hats. Where would one of the lower or  higher classes in Europe have shown such feeling politeness to a poor  and miserable object of a degraded race?\"--_Darwin's Naturalist's  Voyage._]    Rudeness, which some Northerners fancy is a proof of equality and  independence, we never met with, and duels and street quarrels are  almost unknown. We detected none of the touchy sensitiveness of the  punctilious Spanish _hidalgos_. Their compliments and promises are  without end; and, made in the magnificent and ceremonious language of  Spain,[24] are overwhelming to a stranger. Thus a fair Quitonian sends  by her servant the following message to another lady: \"Go to the  Senorita Fulana de Tal, and tell her that she is my heart and the dear  little friend of my soul; tell her that I am dying for not having seen  her, and ask her why she does not come to see me; tell her that I have  been waiting for her more than a week, and that I send her my best  respects and considerations; and ask her how she is, and how her husband  is, and how her children are, and whether they are all well in the  family; and tell her she is my little love, and ask her whether she will  be kind enough to send me that pattern which she promised me the other  day.\"[25] This highly important message the servant delivers like a  parrot, not omitting a single compliment, but rather adding thereto.    [Footnote 24: The Spanish tongue is the manly son of the Latin, as the  Italian is the fair daughter; a language in which, as Charles V. said,  \"God ought alone to be addressed in prayer.\" It is spoken in America  with an Andalusian rather than Toledan pronunciation.]    [Footnote 25: We are indebted to Mr. Hassaurek for this capital  illustration. Every lady, married or unmarried, is addressed _Senorita_,  or Miss.]    A newly-arrived foreigner is covered with promises: houses, horses,  servants,"]]]
