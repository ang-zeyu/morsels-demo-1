The fundamental truth of the Manifestations is peace. This  underlies all religion, all justice. The divine purpose is that men should  live in unity, concord and agreement and should love one another. Consider  the virtues of the human world and realize that the oneness of humanity is  the primary foundation of them all. Read the Gospel and the other Holy  Books. You will find their fundamentals are one and the same. Therefore,  unity is the essential truth of religion and, when so understood, embraces  all the virtues of the human world. Praise be to God! This knowledge has  been spread, eyes have been opened, and ears have become attentive.  Therefore, we must endeavor to promulgate and practice the religion of God  which has been founded by all the Prophets. And the religion of God is  absolute love and unity.          19 April 1912  Talk at Bowery Mission  227 Bowery, New York      From Stenographic Notes    Tonight I am very happy, for I have come here to meet my friends. I  consider you my relatives, my companions; and I am your comrade.    You must be thankful to God that you are poor, for Jesus Christ has said,  \"Blessed are the poor.\" He never said, \"Blessed are the rich.\" He said,  too, that the Kingdom is for the poor and that it is easier for a camel to  enter a needle's eye than for a rich man to enter God's Kingdom.  Therefore, you must be thankful to God that although in this world you are  indigent, yet the treasures of God are within your reach; and although in  the material realm you are poor, yet in the Kingdom of God you are  precious. Jesus Himself was poor. He did not belong to the rich. He passed  His time in the desert, traveling among the poor, and lived upon the herbs  of the field. He had no place to lay His head, no home. He was exposed in  the open to heat, cold and frost--to inclement weather of all kinds--yet He  chose this rather than riches. If riches were considered a glory, the  Prophet Moses would have chosen them; Jesus would have been a rich man.  When Jesus Christ appeared, it was the poor who first accepted Him, not  the rich. Therefore, you are the disciples of Jesus Christ; you are His  comrades, for He outwardly was poor, not rich. Even this earth's happiness  does not depend upon wealth. You will find many of the wealthy exposed to  dangers and troubled by difficulties, and in their last moments upon the  bed of death there remains the regret that they must be separated from  that to which their hearts are so attached. They come into this world  naked, and they must go from it naked. All they possess they must leave  behind and pass away solitary, alone. Often at the time of death their  souls are filled with remorse; and worst of all, their hope in the mercy  of God is less than ours. Praise be to God! Our hope is in the mercy of  God, and there is no doubt that the divine compassion is bestowed upon the  poor. Jesus Christ said so; Baha'u'llah said so. While Baha'u'llah was in  Ba_gh_dad, still in possession of great wealth, He left all He had and  went alone from the city, living two years among the poor. They were His  comrades. He ate with them, slept with them and gloried in being one of  them. He chose for one of His names the title of The Poor One and often in  His Writings refers to Himself as Darvi_sh_, which in Persian means poor;  and of this title He was very proud. He admonished all that we must be the  servants of the poor, helpers of the poor, remember the sorrows of the  poor, associate with them; for thereby we may inherit the Kingdom of  heaven. God has not said that there are mansions prepared for us if we  pass our time associating with the rich, but He has said there are many  mansions prepared for the servants of the poor, for the poor are very dear  to God. The mercies and bounties of God are with them. The rich are mostly  negligent, inattentive, steeped in worldliness, depending upon their  means, whereas the poor are dependent upon God, and their reliance is upon  Him, not upon themselves. Therefore, the poor are nearer the threshold of  God and His throne.    Jesus was a poor man. One night when He was out in the fields, the rain  began to fall. He had no place to go for shelter so He lifted His eyes  toward heaven, saying, \"O Father! For the birds of the air Thou hast  created nests, for the sheep a fold, for the animals dens, for the fish  places of refuge, but for Me Thou hast provided no shelter. There is no  place where I may lay My head. My bed consists of the cold ground; My  lamps at night are the stars, and My food is the grass of the field. Yet  who upon earth is richer than I? For the greatest blessing Thou hast not  given to the rich and mighty but unto Me, for Thou hast given Me the poor.  To me Thou hast granted this blessing. They are Mine. Therefore am I the  richest man on earth.\"    So, my comrades, you are following in the footsteps of Jesus Christ. Your  lives are similar to His life; your attitude is like unto His; you  resemble Him more than the rich do. Therefore, we will thank God that we  have been so blessed with real riches. And in conclusion, I ask you to  accept 'Abdu'l-Baha as your servant.    At the end of this meeting, 'Abdu'l-Baha stood at the Bowery entrance to  the Mission hall, shaking hands with four or five hundred men and placing  within each palm a piece of silver.            TALKS 'ABDU'L-BAHA DELIVERED IN WASHINGTON, D.C.          20 April 1912  Talk at Orient-Occident-Unity Conference  Public Library Hall, Washington, D.C.      Notes by Joseph H. Hannen    Tonight I am most happy in presenting myself before an audience such as  this. I am an Oriental and have come into the West to meet the people of  the Occident. Praise be to God! Upon the faces of those assembled here I  perceive the light of God. This I consider an evidence of the possibility  of uniting the East and the West, of establishing a perfect bond between  Persia and America--one of the objects of this conference. For the Persians  there is no government better fitted to contribute to the development of  their natural resources and the helping of their national needs in a  reciprocal alliance than the United States of America, and for the  Americans there could be no better industrial outlet and market than the  virgin commercial soil of Persia. The mineral wealth of Persia is still  latent and untouched. It is my hope that the great American democracy may  be instrumental in developing these hidden resources and that a bond of  perfect amity and unity may be established between the American republic  and the government of Persia. May this bond--whether material or  spiritual--be well cemented. May the material civilization of America find  complete efficacy and establishment in Persia, and may the spiritual  civilization of Persia find acceptance and response in America.    Some of the creatures of existence can live solitary and alone. A tree,  for instance, may live without the assistance and cooperation of other  trees. Some animals are isolated and lead a separate existence away from  their kind. But this is impossible for man. In his life and being  cooperation and association are essential. Through association and meeting  we find happiness and development, individual and collective.    For instance, when there is intercourse and cooperation between two  villages, the advancement of each will be assured. Likewise, if  intercommunication is established between two cities, both will benefit  and progress. And if a reciprocal basis of agreement be reached between  two countries, their individual and mutual interests will find great  development. Therefore, in the unity of this radiant assemblage I behold  the link between Orient and Occident. Such unity is the means and  instrument of cooperation between the various countries of the East and  West. It is evident, then, that the outcomes from this basis of agreement  and accord are numberless and unlimited. Surely there will be great  harvests of results forthcoming for Persia and America. In Persia advanced  material civilization will be established and the doors thrown open wide  to American commerce.    Above and beyond all this, a great love and fountain of affection shall  bind and blend these two remote peoples, for Baha'u'llah has proclaimed to  the world the solidarity of nations and the oneness of humanity.  Addressing all mankind He has said, \"Ye are all leaves of one tree and the  drops of one sea.\" The world of humanity has been expressed by Him as a  unit--as one family. It is, therefore, hoped that the American and Persian  nations may be conjoined and united in reciprocal love. May they become  one race endowed with the same susceptibilities. May these bonds of amity  and accord be firmly established.    Baha'u'llah passed forty years of His life in prison and exile in order  that He might upraise the banner of the oneness of the world of men. For  this He bore all these ordeals and difficulties. He was under the dominion  of 'Abdu'l-Hamid. I, too, was in the prison of 'Abdu'l-Hamid until the  Committee of Union and Progress hoisted the standard of liberty and my  fetters were removed. They exhibited great kindness and love toward me. I  was made free and thereby enabled to come to this country. Were it not for  the action of this Committee, I should not be with you here tonight.  Therefore, you must all ask assistance and confirmation in behalf of this  Committee through which the liberty of Turkey was proclaimed.    Briefly, I have traveled this long distance, crossed the Atlantic Ocean to  this western continent in the desire and hope that the strongest bond of  unity may be established between America and Persia. I know this to be  your wish and purpose also and am sure of your cooperation. We shall,  therefore, offer supplication in the divine threshold that a great love"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19287"],[0,"Selections from the Writings of `Abdu'l-Bahá (#10)"],[1,"created It, shaped It, fashioned  It, and made It to be an entity conformable to the attributes of the glory  within It! Praised be He Who created It! Praised be He Who fashioned It!  Praised be He Who made It manifest!    Such were the words uttered by Christ. On account of these words they  cavilled at and assailed Him when He said unto them, 'Verily the Son is in  the Father, and the Father is in the Son.'(21) Be thou informed of this,  and learn thou the secrets of thy Lord. As for the deniers, they are  veiled from God: they see not, they hear not, neither do they understand.  'Leave them to entertain themselves with their cavillings.'(22) Abandon  them to their wanderings along river beds where no stream flows. Like  grazing beasts they cannot tell paste from pearl. Are they not shut away  from the mysteries of thy Lord, the Clement, the Merciful?    For thy part, rejoice at this best of all glad tidings, and rise up to  exalt the Word of God and to spread abroad His sweet savours in all that  vast and mighty land. Know thou of a certainty that thy Lord will come to  thine aid with a company of the Concourse on high and hosts of the Abha  Kingdom. These will mount the attack, and will furiously assail the forces  of the ignorant, the blind. Erelong wilt thou behold the flush of daybreak  spreading from out the Most Exalted Realm, and the morn encompassing all  regions. It will put the dark to flight, and the gloom of night will fade  and pass, and the bright brow of the Faith shine forth, and the Day-Star  rise and overspread the world. On that day will the faithful rejoice, and  the steadfast be blissful; then will the slanderers take themselves off,  and the waverers be blotted out, even as deepest shadows fall away at the  first light of the breaking dawn.    Greetings be unto thee, and praise.    O God, my God! This is Thy radiant servant, Thy spiritual thrall, who hath  drawn nigh unto Thee and approached Thy presence. He hath turned his face  unto Thine, acknowledging Thy oneness, confessing Thy singleness, and he  hath called out in Thy name among the nations, and led the people to the  streaming waters of Thy mercy, O Thou Most generous Lord! To those who  asked He hath given to drink from the cup of guidance that brimmeth over  with the wine of Thy measureless grace.    O Lord, assist him under all conditions, cause him to learn Thy  well-guarded mysteries, and shower down upon him Thy hidden pearls. Make  of him a banner rippling from castle summits in the winds of Thy heavenly  aid, make of him a wellspring of crystal waters.    O my forgiving Lord! Light up the hearts with the rays of a lamp that  sheddeth abroad its beams, disclosing to those among Thy people whom Thou  hast bounteously favoured, the realities of all things.    Verily, Thou art the Mighty, the Powerful, the Protector, the Strong, the  Beneficent! Verily, Thou art the Lord of all mercies!            20: WHEN CHRIST APPEARED, TWENTY CENTURIES AGO, ALTHOUGH ...      (23)When Christ appeared, twenty centuries ago, although the Jews were  eagerly awaiting His Coming, and prayed every day, with tears, saying: 'O  God, hasten the Revelation of the Messiah,' yet when the Sun of Truth  dawned, they denied Him and rose against Him with the greatest enmity, and  eventually crucified that divine Spirit, the Word of God, and named Him  Beelzebub, the evil one, as is recorded in the Gospel. The reason for this  was that they said: 'The Revelation of Christ, according to the clear text  of the Torah, will be attested by certain signs, and so long as these  signs have not appeared, whoso layeth claim to be a Messiah is an  impostor. Among these signs is this, that the Messiah should come from an  unknown place, yet we all know this man's house in Nazareth, and can any  good thing come out of Nazareth? The second sign is that He shall rule  with a rod of iron, that is, He must act with the sword, but this Messiah  has not even a wooden staff. Another of the conditions and signs is this:  He must sit upon the throne of David and establish David's sovereignty.  Now, far from being enthroned, this man has not even a mat to sit on.  Another of the conditions is this: the promulgation of all the laws of the  Torah; yet this man has abrogated these laws, and has even broken the  sabbath day, although it is the clear text of the Torah that whosoever  layeth claim to prophethood and revealeth miracles and breaketh the  sabbath day, must be put to death. Another of the signs is this, that in  His reign justice will be so advanced that righteousness and well-doing  will extend from the human even to the animal world--the snake and the  mouse will share one hole, and the eagle and the partridge one nest, the  lion and the gazelle shall dwell in one pasture, and the wolf and the kid  shall drink from one fountain. Yet now, injustice and tyranny have waxed  so great in His time that they have crucified Him! Another of the  conditions is this, that in the days of the Messiah the Jews will prosper  and triumph over all the peoples of the world, but now they are living in  the utmost abasement and servitude in the empire of the Romans. Then how  can this be the Messiah promised in the Torah?'    In this wise did they object to that Sun of Truth, although that Spirit of  God was indeed the One promised in the Torah. But as they did not  understand the meaning of these signs, they crucified the Word of God. Now  the Baha'is hold that the recorded signs did come to pass in the  Manifestation of Christ, although not in the sense which the Jews  understood, the description in the Torah being allegorical. For instance,  among the signs is that of sovereignty. For Baha'is say that the  sovereignty of Christ was a heavenly, divine, everlasting sovereignty, not  a Napoleonic sovereignty that vanisheth in a short time. For well nigh two  thousand years this sovereignty of Christ hath been established, and until  now it endureth, and to all eternity that Holy Being will be exalted upon  an everlasting throne.    In like manner all the other signs have been made manifest, but the Jews  did not understand. Although nearly twenty centuries have elapsed since  Christ appeared with divine splendour, yet the Jews are still awaiting the  coming of the Messiah and regard themselves as true and Christ as false.            21: O THOU DISTINGUISHED PERSONAGE, THOU SEEKER AFTER ...      O thou distinguished personage, thou seeker after truth! Thy letter of 4  April 1921, hath been read with love.    The existence of the Divine Being hath been clearly established, on the  basis of logical proofs, but the reality of the Godhead is beyond the  grasp of the mind. When thou dost carefully consider this matter, thou  wilt see that a lower plane can never comprehend a higher. The mineral  kingdom, for example, which is lower, is precluded from comprehending the  vegetable kingdom; for the mineral, any such understanding would be  utterly impossible. In the same way, no matter how far the vegetable  kingdom may develop, it will achieve no conception of the animal kingdom,  and any such comprehension at its level would be unthinkable, for the  animal occupieth a plane higher than that of the vegetable: this tree  cannot conceive of hearing and sight. And the animal kingdom, no matter  how far it may evolve, can never become aware of the reality of the  intellect, which discovereth the inner essence of all things, and  comprehendeth those realities which cannot be seen; for the human plane as  compared with that of the animal is very high. And although these beings  all co-exist in the contingent world, in each case the difference in their  stations precludeth their grasp of the whole; for no lower degree can  understand a higher, such comprehension being impossible.    The higher plane, however, understandeth the lower. The animal, for  instance, comprehendeth the mineral and vegetable, the human understandeth  the planes of the animal, vegetable and mineral. But the mineral cannot  possibly understand the realms of man. And notwithstanding the fact that  all these entities co-exist in the phenomenal world, even so, no lower  degree can ever comprehend a higher.    Then how could it be possible for a contingent reality, that is, man, to  understand the nature of that pre-existent Essence, the Divine Being? The  difference in station between man and the Divine Reality is thousands upon  thousands of times greater than the difference between vegetable and  animal. And that which a human being would conjure up in his mind is but  the fanciful image of his human condition, it doth not encompass God's  reality but rather is encompassed by it. That is, man graspeth his own  illusory conceptions, but the Reality of Divinity can never be grasped:  It, Itself, encompasseth all created things, and all created things are in  Its grasp. That Divinity which man doth imagine for himself existeth only  in his mind, not in truth. Man, however, existeth both in his mind and in  truth; thus man is greater than that fanciful reality which he is able to  imagine.    The furthermost limits of this bird of clay are these: he can flutter  along for some short distance, into the endless vast; but he can never  soar upward to the Sun in the high heavens. We must, nevertheless, set  forth reasoned or inspired proofs as to the existence of the Divine Being,  that is, proofs commensurate with the understanding of man.    It is obvious that all created things are connected one to another by a  linkage complete and perfect, even, for example, as are the members of the  human body. Note how all the members and component parts of the human body  are connected one to another. In the same way, all the members of this  endless universe are linked one to another. The foot and the step, for  example, are connected to the ear and the eye; the eye must look ahead  before the step is taken. The ear must hear before the eye"]]]
