So far as the British are concerned, the greater part of this week has  been passed in bombardment, in gaining ground by degrees, and in beating  back severe counter-attacks with heavy slaughter. Our casualties have  been severe, but it is probable that those of the enemy are heavier.    The rain has caused a great drop in the temperature, and there is more  than a distinct feeling of Autumn in the air, especially in the early  mornings.    On our right and left the French have been fighting fiercely and have  also been gradually gaining ground [Transcriber: original 'gronud']. One  village has already during this battle been captured and re-captured  twice by each side, and at the time of writing remains in the hands of  the Germans.    The fighting has been at close quarters and of the most desperate  nature, and the streets of the village are filled with dead on both  sides.    As an example of the spirit which is inspiring our allies, the following  translation of an ordre du jour, published on Sept. 9 after the battle  of Montmirail by the commander of the French Fifth Army, is given:         Soldiers: Upon the memorable fields of Montmirail, of Vauchamps, of       Champaubert, which a century ago witnessed the victories of our       ancestors over Blucher's Prussians, your vigorous offensive has       triumphed over the resistance of the Germans. Held on his flanks,       his centre broken, the enemy is now retreating toward the east and       north by forced marches. The most renowned army corps of old       Prussia, the contingents of Westphalia, of Hanover, of Brandenburg,       have retired in haste before you.         This first success is no more than the prelude. The enemy is       shaken, but not yet decisively beaten. You have still to undergo       severe hardships, to make long marches, to fight hard battles.         May the image of our country, soiled by barbarians, always remain       before your eyes. Never was it more necessary to sacrifice all for       her.         Saluting the heroes who have fallen in the fighting of the last few       days, my thoughts turn toward you, the victors in the next battle.       Forward, soldiers, for France!         FRANCHET D'ESPEREY,       General Commanding the Fifth Army.       Montmirail, Sept. 9, 1914.    The Germans are a formidable enemy, well trained, long prepared, and  brave. Their soldiers are carrying on the contest with skill and valor.  Nevertheless they are fighting to win anyhow, regardless of all the  rules of fair play, and there is evidence that they do not hesitate at  anything in order to gain victory.    A large number of the tales of their misbehaviors are exaggeration and  some of the stringent precautions they have taken to guard themselves  against the inhabitants of the areas traversed are possibly justifiable  measures of war. But, at the same time, it has been definitely  established that they have committed atrocities on many occasions and  they have been guilty of brutal conduct.    So many letters and statements of our wounded soldiers have been  published in our newspapers that the following epistle from a German  soldier of the Seventy-fourth Infantry Regiment, Tenth Corps, to his  wife may also be of interest:    \"My Dear Wife: I have just been living through days that defy  imagination. I should never have thought that men could stand it. Not a  second has passed but my life has been in danger, and yet not a hair of  my head has been hurt.    \"It was horrible! It was ghastly! but I have been saved for you and for  our happiness, and I take heart again, although I am still terribly  unnerved. God grant that I may see you again soon, and that this horror  may soon be over.    \"None of us can do any more; human strength is at an end. I will try to  tell you about it. On the 5th of September the enemy were reported to be  taking up a position near St. Prix, southeast of Paris.    \"The Tenth Corps, which had made an astonishingly rapid advance, of  course, was attacked on Sunday. Steep slopes led up to the heights,  which were held in considerable force.    \"With our weak detachments of the Seventy-fourth and Ninety-first  regiments we reached the crest and came under a terrible artillery fire  that mowed us down. However, we entered St. Prix. Hardly had we done so  than we were met with shell fire and a violent fusillade from the  enemy's infantry.    \"Our Colonel was badly wounded--he is the third we have had. Fourteen  men were killed around me. We got away in a lull without being hit.    \"The 7th, 8th, and 9th of September we were constantly under shell and  shrapnel fire and suffered terrible losses. I was in a house which was  hit several times. The fear of death, of agony, which is in every man's  heart, and naturally so, is a terrible feeling.    \"How often I have thought of you, my darling, and what I suffered in  that terrifying battle, which extended along a front of many miles near  Montmirail, you cannot possibly imagine.    \"Our heavy artillery was being used for the siege of Maubeuge. We wanted  it badly, as the enemy had theirs in force and kept up a furious  bombardment. For four days I was under artillery fire. It was like hell,  but a thousand times worse.    \"On the night of the 9th the order was given to retreat, as it would  have been madness to attempt to hold our position with our few men, and  we should have risked a terrible defeat the next day. The First and  Third Armies had not been able to attack with us, as we had advanced too  rapidly. Our morale was absolutely broken. In spite of unheard-of  sacrifices we had achieved nothing.    \"I cannot understand how our army, after fighting three great battles  and being terribly weakened, was sent against a position which the enemy  had prepared for three weeks, but naturally I know nothing of the  intentions of our Chiefs; they say nothing has been lost.    \"In a word, we retired toward Cormontreuil and Rheims by forced marches  by day and night. We hear that three armies are going to get into line,  intrench and rest, and then start afresh our victorious march on Paris.  It was not a defeat, only a strategic retreat. I have confidence in our  Chiefs that everything will be successful.    \"Our First Battalion, which has fought with unparalleled bravery, is  reduced from 1,200 to 194 men. These numbers speak for themselves.\"    Among the minor happenings of interest is the following:    During a counter-attack by the German Fifty-third Regiment on positions  of the Northampton and Queen's Regiments on Thursday, the 17th, a force  of some 400 of the enemy were allowed to approach right up to the trench  occupied by a platoon of the former regiment, owing to the fact that  they had held up their hands and made gestures that were interpreted as  signs that they wished to surrender. When they were actually on the  parapet of the trench held, by the Northamptons they opened fire on our  men at point-blank range.    Unluckily for the enemy, however, flanking them and only some 400 yards  away, there happened to be a machine gun manned by a detachment of the  Queen's. This at once opened fire, cutting a lane through their mass,  and they fell back to their own trench with great loss. Shortly  afterward they were driven further back, with additional loss, by a  battalion of Guards which came up in support.    An incident, which occurred some little time ago during our retirement,  is also worthy of record. On Aug. 28, during the battle fought by the  French along the Oise between La Fere and Guise, one of the French  commanders desired to make an air reconnoissance. It was found, however,  that no observers were available.    Wishing to help our allies as much as possible a British officer  attached to this particular French army volunteered to go up with the  pilot to observe. He had never been in an aeroplane, but he made the  ascent and produced a valuable reconnoissance report.    Incidentally he had a duel in the air at an altitude of 6,000 feet with  the observer of a German Taube monoplane which approached. He fired  several shots and drove off the hostile aeroplane. His action was much  appreciated by the French.    In view of the many statements made in the press as to the use of  Zeppelins against us, it is interesting to note that the Royal Flying  Corps, who had been out on reconnoissance every day since their arrival  in France, have never seen a Zeppelin, though airships of a non-rigid  type have been seen on two occasions near Marne.    Late one evening two such were observed over the German forces. An  aeroplane was dispatched against them, but in the darkness our pilots  were uncertain of the airship's nationality and did not attack. It was  afterward made clear that they could not have been French.    A week later an officer, reconnoitring to the flank, saw an airship over  the German forces and opposite the French. It had no distinguishing mark  and was assumed to belong to the latter, though it is now known that it  also must have been a German craft.    The orders of the Royal Flying Corps are to attack Zeppelins at once,  and there is some disappointment at the absence of those targets.    The following special order has been issued today to the troops:         \"Special Order of the Day,       By Field Marshal Sir John French,       G.C.B., G.C.V.O., K.C.M.G.,       Commander in Chief of the British Army in the Field.         \"September 17, 1914.         \"Once more I have to express my deep appreciation of the splendid       behavior of the officers, non-commissioned officers, and men of the       army under my command throughout the great battle of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16370"],[0,"Lameness of the Horse (#10)"],[1,"from exostoses; but as soon as the affected leg ceases  to bear weight, it may be passively flexed and the nature of the  enlargement recognized because it may be slightly displaced by digital  manipulation. Displacement, of course, is not possible with an  exostosis.    A necessary qualification, which the diagnostician must possess, is that  of being able to judge carefully the nearness of any given exostosis to  articular structures. Also, the extent or area of the base of an  exostosis as well as its exact position, needs be determined before one  may estimate the probable outcome in any case,--whether treatment should  be encouraged or discouraged by the practitioner. Periarticular ringbone  may, because of the size and location of the exostosis, constitute a  condition which cannot be relieved in any way in one case, and in  another, because of the manner of distribution of such osseous  deposits, the condition may be such that prompt recovery will follow  proper treatment. In the examination of an exostosis of the tarsus, it  is particularly important to determine the exact location of the  exostosis--whether or not the spavin involves the tibial tarsal  (astragulus) bone very near its tibial articular portions. Obviously, if  articular surfaces of joints are involved, complete recovery cannot  result despite the most skillful attention given the subject.      Passive Movements.    Wherever it is possible to gain the confidence of a tractable animal to  the extent that it will relax the structures sufficiently to make  possible passive movement of affected parts, much is to be learned as a  result of such manipulation. By this method one may differentiate true  crepitation, false crepitation, luxation and inflammation of ligaments  that have been injured, as in sprains of such structures in the  phalangeal region.    _True crepitation_ is recognizable by the characteristic vibration which  is interpreted by tactile sense. It is possible to recognize fracture by  the use of other methods--auscultation, tuning fork tests, etc., but in  ordinary veterinary practice one must rely upon the sense of touch for  recognition of crepitation.    Where pain is not so great that relaxation of parts does not occur, one  can, by gently moving an extremity in various directions--as in flexion,  extension and lateral motion as well as by rotation--cause to be  manifested this peculiar grating,--the friction of newly broken bone.  This is known as _true crepitation_. Where the subject, suffering  phalangeal fracture, manifests evidence of pain due to tensing the  structures about a fractured part, one may anesthetize the parts by  using about two cubic centimeters of a two per cent. solution of cocain  upon the plantar nerves, proximal to the fracture. It is perhaps best to  deposit the cocain solution by means of two hypodermic punctures at  different points along the course of each nerve, though closely situated  to one another, thereby making more sure of the solution actually  contacting the nerve. In some multiple fractures of the first or second  phalanx this is quite necessary; otherwise, pain produced by passive  manipulation causes the subject to keep the tendons so tense that  crepitation may not be detected. The unnecessary infliction of pain is  always to be avoided.    We know as _false crepitation_ a vibrating impulse occasioned by normal  contact of articular portions of bones such as in the metacarpophalangeal  joint when this structure is passively moved, where the subject permits  the parts to remain in a state of complete relaxation.    Attempts to recognize supersensitiveness or inflammation by means of  passive movement of the shoulder or hip, whether gently or forcefully,  is not productive of good, in any case, in large animals. Because of the  bulk and weight of parts so manipulated, as well as the resistance the  subject offers even in normal cases, no accurate conclusion is to be  arrived at in this manner in the average instance. Animals nearly always  resist the placing of members in any position that is so unusual and  uncomfortable as that which is required to materially displace the  component tissues of the shoulder or hip; therefore, such practice is  useless because one can not distinguish between normal resistance and  flinching caused by painful sensations in injured parts. Such  manipulations are practical in small animals.      Observing the Character of the Gait.    In order to determine the degree of lameness as well as its character,  it is necessary to cause the subject which is being examined, to move in  some manner. The degree of inconvenience or distress experienced by a  lame animal that is being so examined is manifested by the character of  the claudication; and where much pain is occasioned in locomotion there  is disturbance of respiration; perspiration may be noticeable and in  some instances manifestation of nervous shock are very evident--this in  timid, nervous animals that anticipate being punished when approached  and, consequently, make every effort possible to move when urged to do  so. An animal, then, should be moved only sufficiently to cause it to  exhibit the degree of lameness present in any given case, and if a  marked impediment is manifested it is not necessary to cause the subject  to be exerted to the extent of inflicting, in such manner, unnecessary  punishment. Further or conclusive examination is made by palpation. To  cause the subject to move, an assistant may simply lead the animal with  a halter and compel it to walk a few steps. In this way, lameness,  whether manifested during the weight-bearing period of an affected  member, or when such a member is being advanced, or whether a  combination of the two conditions exists, is made apparent. In the words  of Dollar, one is thus enabled to recognize the existence of  \"supporting-leg-lameness,\" \"swinging-leg-lameness\" or \"mixed lameness.\"    When the cause of lameness is not strikingly apparent it becomes  necessary to have the subject moved farther than a few steps and at  different paces. Depending then, upon the character of lameness  manifested, as well as upon its degree of intensity, one needs to  exercise the subject in various ways, but this should not be overdone.    The first thing apparent in the lame subject in action, is the lame leg.  If this is not readily determinable, as in some complicated cases, the  leg or legs which are at fault are to be discovered by further  examination, and to do this,--word-pictures convey little that is  helpful in difficult cases,--long practice is the one route by which one  may become efficient; that is, by experience gained after fundamental  principles in the diagnosis of lameness have been mastered.    For a careful study of supporting-leg-lameness involving a fore limb,  the subject is driven or led _toward_ the one making such examination.  If a hind leg is to be observed, the animal is made to travel _away  from_ the examiner. Where there exists swinging-leg-lameness, the  subject should be caused to move past the diagnostician, so that he may  get a side view of the subject while it is in motion.    In every case such examinations are made to the best advantage if the  practitioner can view his patient from a little distance. Here, again, a  visual examination is made but this cannot be successfully executed, in  difficult cases, if the practitioner is stationed at too close range.    The average subject is best observed by being led, rather than being  ridden, and in so doing the animal should be given moderately free  rein. A close grasp on the lead may interfere somewhat with head  movements. Nodding of the head with the catching up of weight by a sound  member in supporting-leg-lameness of a fore leg, constitutes the chief  symptom considered in detecting the lame leg.    Where supporting-leg-lameness affects a hind limb the head is raised at  the time weight is caught by the sound member--here the long axis of the  subject's body may be likened unto a lever of the first class. The  posterior part of the body, at the time weight is taken upon the sound  leg, is as the long arm: the fore limbs the fulcrum, and the subject's  head the weight, which is lifted. The head movements of a horse at a  trot, in supporting-leg-lameness of a front leg, synchronize with the  discharge of weight from a lame leg to the opposite one if sound; but in  pelvic limb affections, the head is thrown or jerked upward as weight is  caught by the sound member,--this peculiar nodding movement is  _opposite_ in the two instances.    In pacing horses, since front and hind legs of the same side are  advanced at the same time, there occurs in supporting-leg-lameness, a  nodding of the head with discharge of weight from the lame leg, and a  dropping of the hip as weight is caught by the sound pelvic member. In  observing animals that are limping, (as in supporting-leg-lameness) one  notices particularly the sacro-iliac region in hind leg affections and  the occipital region in lameness of the front legs.    Where there exists a bilateral affection, (such as characterizes some cases  of navicular disease or other affections causing supporting-leg-lameness)  there occurs no nodding of the head; weight is supported for an equal  length of time upon each one of the two legs, but the stride[4] is  shortened. The gait, in such cases, is peculiar, animals appearing stiff  and they are said, by horsemen, to have a \"choppy\" gait.    It is desirable, in some cases, to cause an animal to move from side to  side; in other instances the subject is best made to walk or trot in a  circle, and if the circle be very small the animal then particularly  employs the inner fore leg as a pivotal supporting member. To augment  the manifestation of certain affections, it is necessary to cause the  patient to walk backward, and each one of these tests of locomotion  serves to point"]]]
