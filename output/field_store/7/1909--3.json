It was a princess who stood outside, but she was in a terrible state  from the rain and the storm. The water streamed out of her hair and her  clothes; it ran in at the top of her shoes and out at the heel, but she  said that she was a real princess.    'Well we shall soon see if that is true,' thought the old Queen, but she  said nothing. She went into the bedroom, took all the bedclothes off and  laid a pea on the bedstead: then she took twenty mattresses and piled  them on the top of the pea, and then twenty feather beds on the top of  the mattresses. This was where the princess was to sleep that night. In  the morning they asked her how she had slept.    'Oh terribly badly!' said the princess. 'I have hardly closed my eyes  the whole night! Heaven knows what was in the bed. I seemed to be lying  upon some hard thing, and my whole body is black and blue this morning.  It is terrible!'    They saw at once that she must be a real princess when she had felt the  pea through twenty mattresses and twenty feather beds. Nobody but a real  princess could have such a delicate skin.    So the prince took her to be his wife, for now he was sure that he had  found a real princess, and the pea was put into the Museum, where it may  still be seen if no one has stolen it.    Now this is a true story.          THE GARDEN OF PARADISE      There was once a king's son; nobody had so many or such beautiful books  as he had. He could read about everything which had ever happened in  this world, and see it all represented in the most beautiful pictures.  He could get information about every nation and every country; but as to  where the Garden of Paradise was to be found, not a word could he  discover, and this was the very thing he thought most about. His  grandmother had told him, when he was quite a little fellow and was  about to begin his school life, that every flower in the Garden of  Paradise was a delicious cake, and that the pistils were full of wine.  In one flower history was written, in another geography or tables; you  had only to eat the cake and you knew the lesson. The more you ate, the  more history, geography and tables you knew. All this he believed then;  but as he grew older and wiser and learnt more, he easily perceived that  the delights of the Garden of Paradise must be far beyond all this.    [Illustration: _His grandmother had told him, when he was quite a  little fellow and was about to begin his school life, that every flower  in the Garden of Paradise was a delicious cake, and that the pistils  were full of wine._]    'Oh, why did Eve take of the tree of knowledge? Why did Adam eat the  forbidden fruit? If it had only been I it would not have happened! never  would sin have entered the world!'    This is what he said then, and he still said it when he was seventeen;  his thoughts were full of the Garden of Paradise.    He walked into the wood one day; he was alone, for that was his greatest  pleasure. Evening came on, the clouds drew up and it rained as if the  whole heaven had become a sluice from which the water poured in sheets;  it was as dark as it is otherwise in the deepest well. Now he slipped on  the wet grass, and then he fell on the bare stones which jutted out of  the rocky ground. Everything was dripping, and at last the poor Prince  hadn't got a dry thread on him. He had to climb over huge rocks where  the water oozed out of the thick moss. He was almost fainting; just then  he heard a curious murmuring and saw in front of him a big lighted cave.  A fire was burning in the middle, big enough to roast a stag, which was  in fact being done; a splendid stag with its huge antlers was stuck on a  spit, being slowly turned round between the hewn trunks of two fir  trees. An oldish woman, tall and strong enough to be a man dressed up,  sat by the fire throwing on logs from time to time.    'Come in, by all means!' she said; 'sit down by the fire so that your  clothes may dry!'    'There is a shocking draught here,' said the Prince, as he sat down on  the ground.    'It will be worse than this when my sons come home!' said the woman.  'You are in the cavern of the winds; my sons are the four winds of the  world! Do you understand?'    'Who are your sons?' asked the Prince.    'Well that's not so easy to answer when the question is stupidly put,'  said the woman. 'My sons do as they like; they are playing rounders now  with the clouds up there in the great hall,' and she pointed up into the  sky.    'Oh indeed!' said the Prince. 'You seem to speak very harshly, and you  are not so gentle as the women I generally see about me!'    'Oh, I daresay they have nothing else to do! I have to be harsh if I am  to keep my boys under control! But I can do it, although they are a  stiff-necked lot! Do you see those four sacks hanging on the wall? They  are just as frightened of them as you used to be of the cane behind the  looking-glass. I can double the boys up, I can tell you, and then they  have to go into the bag; we don't stand upon ceremony, and there they  have to stay; they can't get out to play their tricks till it suits me  to let them. But here we have one of them.' It was the Northwind who  came in with an icy blast; great hailstones peppered about the floor and  snow-flakes drifted in. He was dressed in bearskin trousers and jacket,  and he had a sealskin cap drawn over his ears. Long icicles were  hanging from his beard, and one hailstone after another dropped down  from the collar of his jacket.    'Don't go straight to the fire,' said the Prince. 'You might easily get  chilblains!'    'Chilblains!' said the Northwind with a loud laugh. 'Chilblains! they  are my greatest delight! What sort of a feeble creature are you? How did  you get into the cave of the winds?'    'He is my guest,' said the old woman, 'and if you are not pleased with  that explanation you may go into the bag! Now you know my opinion!'    This had its effect, and the Northwind told them where he came from, and  where he had been for the last month.    'I come from the Arctic seas,' he said. 'I have been on Behring Island  with the Russian walrus-hunters. I sat at the helm and slept when they  sailed from the north cape, and when I woke now and then the stormy  petrels were flying about my legs. They are queer birds; they give a  brisk flap with their wings and then keep them stretched out and  motionless, and even then they have speed enough.'    'Pray don't be too long-winded,' said the mother of the winds. 'So at  last you got to Behring Island!'    'It's perfectly splendid! There you have a floor to dance upon, as flat  as a pancake, half-thawed snow, with moss. There were bones of whales  and Polar bears lying about; they looked like the legs and arms of  giants covered with green mould. One would think that the sun had never  shone on them. I gave a little puff to the fog so that one could see the  shed. It was a house built of wreckage and covered with the skins of  whales; the flesh side was turned outwards; it was all red and green; a  living Polar bear sat on the roof growling. I went to the shore and  looked at the birds' nests, looked at the unfledged young ones screaming  and gaping; then I blew down thousands of their throats and they learnt  to shut their mouths. Lower down the walruses were rolling about like  monster maggots with pigs' heads and teeth a yard long!'    'You're a good story-teller, my boy!' said his mother. 'It makes my  mouth water to hear you!'    'Then there was a hunt! The harpoons were plunged into the walruses'  breasts, and the steaming blood spurted out of them like fountains over  the ice. Then I remembered my part of the game! I blew up and made my  ships, the mountain-high icebergs, nip the boats; whew! how they  whistled and how they screamed, but I whistled louder. They were obliged  to throw the dead walruses, chests and ropes out upon the ice! I shook  the snow-flakes over them and let them drift southwards to taste the  salt water. They will never come back to Behring Island!'    'Then you've been doing evil!' said the mother of the winds.    'What good I did, the others may tell you,' said he. 'But here we have  my brother from the west; I like him best of all; he smells of the sea  and brings a splendid cool breeze with him!'    'Is that the little Zephyr?' asked the Prince.    'Yes, certainly it is Zephyr, but he is not so little as all that. He  used to be a pretty boy once, but that's gone by!'    He looked like a wild man of the woods, but he had a padded hat on so as  not to come to any harm. He carried a mahogany club cut in the American  mahogany forests. It could not be anything less than that.    'Where do you come from?' asked his mother.    'From the forest wildernesses!' he said, 'where the thorny creepers make  a fence between every tree, where the water-snake lies in the wet grass,  and where human beings seem to be superfluous!'    'What did you do there?'    'I looked at the mighty river, saw where it dashed over the rocks in  dust and flew with the clouds to carry the rainbow. I saw the wild  buffalo swimming in the river, but the stream carried him away; he  floated with the wild duck, which soared into the sky at the rapids; but  the buffalo was carried over with the water. I liked that and blew a  storm, so that the primaeval trees had to sail too, and they were whirled  about like shavings.'    'And you have done nothing else?' asked the old woman.    'I have been turning somersaults in the Savannahs, patting the wild  horse, and shaking down cocoanuts! Oh yes, I have plenty of stories to  tell! But one need not tell everything. You know that very well, old  woman!' and then he kissed his mother so heartily that she nearly fell  backwards; he was indeed a wild boy.    The Southwind appeared now in a turban and a flowing bedouin's cloak.

Coming  with us, Geraldine?\"    Geraldine rose, not too steadily, her glass still in her hand, and took  Rand's left arm. Gladys, seeing Nelda moving in on the detective's right,  took his other arm. Nelda was barely successful in suppressing a look of  murderous anger. The double doorway into the hall was just wide enough  for Rand and his two flankers to pass through; Nelda had to fall in a  couple of paces rear of center, and wasn't able to come up into line  until they were in the hall upstairs.    \"There's the gunroom.\" Gladys pointed. \"And that's your room, over  there.\" As she spoke, Walters came out of the doorway she had indicated.    \"Your bags are unpacked, sir,\" he reported. Then he told Rand where he  would find his things, and where the bath was.    There was a brief discussion of drinks. The butler received his  instructions and went down the stairway; Rand broke up the feminine  formation around him and ushered the ladies ahead of him into the  gunroom.    It was much as he remembered it from his visit of two years before.  There was a desk in one corner, and back of it a short workbench and  tool-cabinet. There was a long table in the middle of the room, its top  covered with green baize, upon which many flat rectangular boxes of  hardwood rested--some walnut, some rosewood, some quartered oak. Each  would contain a pistol or pair of pistols, with cleaning and loading  tools. In the corner farthest from the desk, he saw the head of the  spiral stairway from the library below, mentioned by Gladys Fleming.  There were ashstands and a couple of cocktail-tables, and a number of  chairs, and the old maple cobbler's bench on which Lane Fleming had died.  The only books in the room were in a small case over the workbench; they  were all arms-books.    Then he looked at the walls. On both ends, and on the long inside wall,  the pistols hung, hundreds and hundreds of them, the cream of a  lifetime's collecting. Horizontal white-painted boards had been fixed to  the walls about four feet from the floor, and similar boards had been  placed five feet above them. Between, narrow vertical strips, as wide  as a lath but twice as thick, were set. Rows of pistols were hung, the  barrels horizontal, on pairs of these strips, with screwhooks at grip  and muzzle. There were about a hundred such vertical rows of pistols.    Rand was still looking at them when the butler brought in the drinks;  when Gladys told the servant that that would be all, he went out, rather  reluctantly, by the spiral stairs to the library.    \"Well, what do you think of them, Colonel Rand?\" Gladys asked.    Rand tasted his whiskey and looked around. \"It's one of the finest  collections in the country,\" he said. \"I may even be able to find  somebody who'll top Rivers's offer, but don't be disappointed if I  don't.... By the way, did anybody help Mr. Fleming keep this stuff clean?  The room seems dry, but even so, they'd need an occasional wiping-off.\"    \"Oh, Walters was always in here, going over the pistols,\" Nelda said.  \"He's been in here every day, lately.\"    \"I wonder if you could spare him to help me a little? I'll need somebody  who knows his way around here, at first.\"    \"Why, of course,\" Gladys agreed. \"He isn't very busy in the mornings, or  in the afternoons till close to dinner-time. Are you going to start work  today?\"    \"I'll have to. I'm going to see Stephen Gresham and his associates this  evening, and I'll want to know what I'm talking about.\"    They spent about fifteen minutes over their drinks, talking about the  collection. Rand and Gladys did most of the talking, in spite of Nelda's  best efforts to monopolize the conversation. Geraldine, after a few  minutes, retired into her private world and only roused herself when her  sister and stepmother were about to leave. When they went out, Gladys  promised to send Walters up directly; Rand heard her speaking to him at  the foot of the main stairway.          CHAPTER 7      When Walters entered, Rand had his pipe lit and was walking slowly around  the room, laying out the work ahead of him. Roughly, the earliest pieces  were on the extreme left, on the short north wall of the room, and the  most recent ones on the right, at the south end. This was, of course,  only relatively true; the pistols seemed to have been classified by type  in vertical rows, and chronologically from top to bottom in each row. The  collection seemed to consist of a number of intensely specialized small  groups, with a large number of pistols of general types added. For  instance, about midway on the long east wall, there were some thirty-odd  all-metal pistols, from wheel lock to percussion. There was a collection  of U.S. Martials, with two rows of the regulation pistols, flintlock and  percussion, of foreign governments, placed on the left, and the  collection of Colts on the right. After them came the other types of  percussion revolvers, and the later metallic-cartridge types.    It was an arrangement which made sense, from the arms student's point  of view, and Rand decided that it would make sense to the dealers and  museums to whom he intended sending lists. He would save time by  listing them as they were hung on the walls. Then, there were the cases  between the windows on the west wall, containing the ammunition  collection--examples of every type of fixed-pistol ammunition--and the  collection of bullet-molds and powder flasks and wheel lock spanners and  assorted cleaning and loading accessories. All that stuff would have to  be listed, too.    \"I beg your pardon, sir,\" Walters broke in, behind him. \"Mrs. Fleming  said that you wanted me.\"    \"Oh, yes.\" Rand turned. \"Is this the whole thing? What's on the walls,  here?\"    \"Yes, sir. There is also a wall-case containing a number of modern  pistols and revolvers, and several rifles and shotguns, in the room  formerly occupied by Mr. Fleming, but they are not part of the  collection, and they are now the personal property of Mrs. Fleming.  I understand that she intends selling at least some of them, on her  own account. Then, there is a quantity of ammunition and  ammunition-components in that closet under the workbench--cartridges,  primed cartridge-shells, black and smokeless powder, cartridge-primers,  percussion caps--but they are not part of the collection, either. I  believe Mrs. Fleming wants to sell most of that, too.\"    \"Well, I'll talk to her about it. I may want to buy some of the  ammunition for myself,\" Rand said. \"So I only need to bother with what's  on the walls, in this room?... By the way, did Mr. Fleming keep any sort  of record of his collection? A book, or a card-index, or anything like  that?\"    \"Why no, sir.\" Walters was positive. Then he hedged. \"If he did, I never  saw or heard of anything of the sort. Mr. Fleming knew everything in this  room. I've seen him, downstairs, when somebody would ask him about  something, close his eyes as though trying to visualize and then give a  perfect description of any pistol in the collection. Or else, he could  enumerate all the pistols of a certain type; say, all the Philadelphia  Deringers, or all the Allen pepperboxes, or all the rim-fire Smith &  Wesson tip-back types. He had a remarkable memory for his pistols,  although it was not out of the ordinary otherwise, sir.\"    Rand nodded. Any collector--at least, any collector who was a serious  arms-student--could do that, particularly if he were a good visualizer  and kept his stuff in some systematic order. At the moment, he could have  named and described any or all of his own modest collection of two  hundred-odd pistols and revolvers.    \"I was hoping he'd kept a record,\" he said. \"A great many collectors do,  and it would have helped me quite a bit.\" He made up his mind to compile  such a record, himself, when he got back to New Belfast. It would be a  big help to Carter Tipton, when it came time to settle his own estate,  and a man on whom the Reaper has scored as many near-misses as on Jeff  Rand should begin to think of such things. \"And how about writing  materials? And is there a typewriter available?\"    There was: a cased portable was on the floor beside the workbench.  Walters showed him which desk drawers contained paper and other things.  There was, Rand noticed, a loaded .38 Colt Detective Special, in the  upper right-hand desk drawer.    \"And these phones,\" the butler continued, indicating them. \"This one is  a private outside phone; it doesn't connect with any other in the house.  The other is an extension. It has a buzzer; the outside phone has a  regular bell.\"    Rand thanked him for the information. Then, picking up a note-pad and  pencil, he started on the left of the collection, meaning to make a  general list and rough approximation of value for use in talking to  Gresham's friends that evening. Tomorrow he would begin on the detailed  list for use in soliciting outside offers.    Twenty-five wheel locks: four heavy South German dags, two singles  and a pair; three Saxon pistols, with sharply dropped grips, a pair  and one single; five French and Italian sixteenth-century pistols;  a pair of small pocket or sash pistols; a pair of French petronels,  and an extremely long seventeenth-century Dutch pistol with an  ivory-covered stock and a carved ivory Venus-head for a pommel; eight  seventeenth-century French, Italian and Flemish pistols. Rand noted them  down, and was about to pass on; then he looked sharply at one of them.    It was nothing out of the ordinary, as wheel locks go; a long Flemish  weapon of about 1640, the type used by the Royalist cavalry in the  English Civil War. There were two others almost like it, but this one was  in simply appalling condition. The metal was rough with rust, and  apparently no attempt had been made to clean it in a couple of centuries.  There was a piece cracked out of the fore-end, the ramrod was"]]]
