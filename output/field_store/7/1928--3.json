Died 1897. \"Rotterdam\" is a stately,  sonorous piece and conveys the flavor of the ancient hymn.    \"Come ye faithful\" has for its modern interpreter Sir Arthur Sullivan,  the celebrated composer of both secular and sacred works, but best  known in hymnody as author of the great Christian march, \"Onward  Christian Soldiers.\"    Hymns are known to have been written by the earlier Greek Fathers,  Ephrem Syrus of Mesopotamia (A.D. 307-373), Basil the Great, Bishop of  Cappadocia (A.D. 329-379) Gregory Nazianzen, Bishop of Constantinople  (A.D. 335-390) and others, but their fragments of song which have come  down to us scarcely rank them among the great witnesses--with the  possible exception of the last name. An English scholar, Rev. Allen W.  Chatfield, has translated the hymns extant of Gregory Nazianzen. The  following stanzas give an idea of their quality. The lines are from an  address to the Deity:        How, Unapproached! shall mind of man        Descry Thy dazzling throne,      And pierce and find Thee out, and scan        Where Thou dost dwell alone?        Unuttered Thou! all uttered things        Have had their birth from Thee;      The One Unknown, from Thee the spring        Of all we know and see.        And lo! all things abide in Thee        And through the complex whole,      Thou spreadst Thine own divinity,        Thyself of all the Goal.    This is reverent, but rather philosophical than evangelical, and reminds  us of the Hymn of Aratus, more than two centuries before Christ was  born.      ST. STEPHEN, THE SABAITE.    This pious Greek monk, (734-794,) nephew of St. John of Damascus, spent  his life, from the age of ten, in the monastery of St. Sabas. His sweet  hymn, known in Neale's translation,--        Art thou weary, art thou languid,        Art thou sore distrest?      Come to Me, saith One, and coming               Be at rest,    --is still in the hymnals, with the tunes of Dykes, and Sir Henry W.  Baker (1821-1877), Vicar of Monkland, Herefordshire.      KING ROBERT II.    _Veni, Sancte Spiritus._    Robert the Second, surnamed \"Robert the Sage\" and \"Robert the Devout,\"  succeeded Hugh Capet, his father, upon the throne of France, about the  year 997. He has been called the gentlest monarch that ever sat upon a  throne, and his amiability of character poorly prepared him to cope with  his dangerous and wily adversaries. His last years were embittered by  the opposition of his own sons, and the political agitations of the  times. He died at Melun in 1031, and was buried at St. Denis.    Robert possessed a reflective mind, and was fond of learning and musical  art. He was both a poet and a musician. He was deeply religious, and,  from unselfish motives, was much devoted to the church.    Robert's hymn, \"Veni, Sancte Spiritus,\" is given below. He himself was a  chorister; and there was no kingly service that he seemed to love so  well. We are told that it was his custom to go to the church of St.  Denis, and in his royal robes, with his crown upon his head, to direct  the choir at matins and vespers, and join in the singing. Few kings have  left a better legacy to the Christian church than his own hymn, which,  after nearly a thousand years, is still an influence in the world:        Come, Thou Holy Spirit, come,      And from Thine eternal home        Shed the ray of light divine;      Come, Thou Father of the poor,      Come, Thou Source of all our store,        Come, within our bosoms shine.        Thou of Comforters the best,      Thou the soul's most welcome Guest,        Sweet Refreshment here below!      In our labor Rest most sweet,      Grateful Shadow from the heat,        Solace in the midst of woe!        Oh, most blessed Light Divine,      Shine within these hearts of Thine,        And our inmost being fill;      If Thou take Thy grace away,      Nothing pure in man will stay,        All our good is turned to ill.        Heal our wounds; our strength renew      On our dryness pour Thy dew;        Wash the stains of guilt away!      Bend the stubborn heart and will,      Melt the frozen, warm the chill,        Guide the steps that go astray.                                _Neale's Translation_.      _THE TUNE._    The metre and six-line stanza, being uniform with those of \"Rock of  Ages,\" have tempted some to borrow \"Toplady\" for this ancient hymn, but  Hastings' tune would refuse to sing other words; and, besides, the  alternate rhymes would mar the euphony. Not unsuitable in spirit are  several existing tunes of the right measure--like \"Nassau\" or \"St.  Athanasius\"--but in truth the \"Veni, Sancte Spiritus\" in English waits  for its perfect setting. Dr. Ray Palmer's paraphrase of it in  sixes-and-fours, to fit \"Olivet,\"--        Come, Holy Ghost in love, etc.    --is objectionable both because the word Ghost is an archaism in  Christian worship and more especially because Dr. Palmer's altered  version usurps the place of his own hymn. \"Olivet\" with \"My faith looks  up to Thee\" makes as inviolable a case of psalmodic monogamy as  \"Toplady\" with \"Rock of Ages.\"      ST. FULBERT.    \"_Chori Cantores Hierusalem Novae._\"    St. Fulbert's hymn is a worthy companion of Perronet's \"Coronation\"--if,  indeed, it was not its original prompter--as King Robert's great litany  was the mother song of Watts' \"Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove;\" and  the countless other sacred lyrics beginning with similar words. As the  translation stands in the Church of England, there are six stanzas now  sung, though in America but four appear, and not in the same sequence.  The first four of the six in their regular succession are as follows:        Ye choirs of New Jerusalem,        Your sweetest notes employ,      The Paschal victory to hymn        In strains of holy joy.        For Judah's Lion bursts His chains,        Crushing the serpent's head;      And cries aloud, through death's domains        To wake the imprisoned dead.        Devouring depths of hell their prey        At His command restore;      His ransomed hosts pursue their way        Where Jesus goes before.        Triumphant in His glory now,        To Him all power is given;      To Him in one communion bow        All saints in earth and heaven.    Bishop Fulbert, known in the Roman and in the Protestant ritualistic  churches as St. Fulbert of Chartres, was a man of brilliant and  versatile mind, and one of the most eminent prelates of his time. He was  a contemporary of Robert II, and his intimate friend, continuing so  after the Pope (Gregory V.) excommunicated the king for marrying a  cousin, which was forbidden by the canons of the church.    Fulbert was for some time head of the Theological College at Chartres, a  cathedral town of France, anciently the capital of Celtic Gaul, and  afterwards he was consecrated as Bishop of that diocese. He died about  1029.      _THE TUNE._    The modern tone-interpreter of Fulbert's hymn bears the name \"La Spezia\"  in some collections, and was composed by James Taylor about the time the  hymn was translated into English by Robert Campbell. Research might  discover the ancient tune--for the hymn is said to have been sung in the  English church during Fulbert's lifetime--but the older was little  likely to be the better music. \"La Spezia\" is a choral of enlivening but  easy chords, and a tread of triumph in its musical motion that suits the  march of \"Judah's Lion\":        His ransomed hosts pursue their way        Where Jesus goes before.    James Taylor, born 1833, is a Doctor of Music, organist of the  University of Oxford and Director of the Oxford Philharmonic Society.    Robert Campbell, the translator, was a Scotch lawyer, born in Edinburgh,  who besides his work as an advocate wrote original hymns, and in other  ways exercised a natural literary gift. He compiled the excellent  Hymnal of the diocese of St. Andrews, and this was his best work. The  date of his death is given as Dec. 29, 1868.      THOMAS OF CELANO.            Dies irae! dies illa,          Solvet saeclum in favilla,          Teste David cum Sybilla.        Day of wrath! that day of burning,      All the world to ashes turning,      Sung by prophets far discerning.    Latin ecclesiastical poetry reached its high water mark in that awful  hymn. The solitaire of its sphere and time in the novelty of its  rhythmic triplets, it stood a wonder to the church and hierarchy  accustomed to the slow spondees of the ancient chant. There could be  such a thing as a trochaic hymn!--and majestic, too!    It was a discovery that did not stale. The compelling grandeur of the  poem placed it distinct and alone, and the very difficulty of staffing  it for vocal and instrumental use gave it a zest, and helped to keep it  unique through the ages.    Latin hymnody and hymnography, appealing to the popular ear and heart,  had gradually substituted accent for quantity in verse; for the common  people could never be moved by a Christian song in the prosody of the  classics. The religion of the cross, with the song-preaching of its  propagandists, created medieval Latin and made it a secondary  classic--mother of four anthem languages of Western and Southern Europe.  Its golden age was the 12th and 13th centuries. The new and more  flexible school of speech and music in hymn and tune had perfected  rhythmic beauty and brought in the winsome assonance of rhyme.    [Illustration: Dr. Martin Luther]    The \"Dies Irae\" was born, it is believed, about the year 1255. Its  authorship has been debated, but competent testimony assures us that the  original draft of the great poem was found in a box among the effects of  Thomas di Celano after his death. Thomas--surnamed Thomas of Celano from  his birthplace, the town of Celano in the province of Aquila, Southern  Italy--was the pupil, friend and co-laborer of St. Francis of Assisi,  and wrote"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18445"],[0,"Bohemians of the Latin Quarter (#10)"],[1,"to see you.\"    \"Holy Providence!\" ejaculated Schaunard. \"Marcel, a seat for Monsieur--\"    \"Blancheron,\" said the new-comer, \"Blancheron of Nantes, delegate of the  sugar interest, Ex-Mayor, Captain of the National Guard, and author of a  pamphlet on the sugar question.\"    \"I am highly honoured at having been chosen by you,\" said the artist,  with a low reverence to the delegate of the refiners. \"How do you wish  to have your portrait taken?\"    \"In miniature,\" replied Blancheron, \"like that,\" and he pointed to a  portrait in oil, for the delegate was one of that class with whom  everything smaller than the side of a house is miniature. Schaunard had  the measure of his man immediately, especially when the other added that  he wished to be painted with the best colours.    \"I never use any other,\" said the artist. \"How large do you wish it to  be?\"    \"About so big,\" answered the other, pointing to a kit-cat. \"How much  will it be?\"    \"Sixty francs with the hands, fifty without.\"    \"The deuce it will! My cousin talked of thirty francs.\"    \"It depends on the season. Colours are much dearer at some times of the  year than at others.\"    \"Bless me! It's just like sugar!\"    \"Precisely.\"    \"Fifty francs then be it.\"    \"You are wrong there; for ten francs more you will have your hands, and  I will put in them your pamphlet on the sugar question, which will have  a very good effect.\"    \"By Jove, you are right!\"    \"Thunder and lightning!\" said Schaunard to himself, \"if he goes on so, I  shall burst, and hurt him with one of the pieces.\"    \"Did you see?\" whispered Marcel.    \"What?\"    \"He has a black coat.\"    \"I take. Let me manage.\"    \"Well,\" quoth the delegate, \"when do we begin? There is no time to  lose, for I sail soon.\"    \"I have to take a little trip myself the day after tomorrow; so, if you  please, we will begin at once. One good sitting will help us along some  way.\"    \"But it will soon be night, and you can't paint by candle light.\"    \"My room is arranged so that we can work at all hours in it. If you will  take off your coat, and put yourself in position, we will commence.\"    \"Take off my coat! What for?\"    \"You told me that you intend this portrait for your family.\"    \"Certainly.\"    \"Well, then, you ought to be represented in your at-home dress--in your  dressing gown. It is the custom to be so.\"    \"But I haven't any dressing gown here.\"    \"But I have. The case is provided for,\" quoth Schaunard, presenting to  his sitter a very ragged garment, so ornamented with paint-marks that  the honest provincial hesitated about setting into it.    \"A very odd dress,\" said he.    \"And very valuable. A Turkish vizier gave it to Horace Vernet, and he  gave it to me when he had done with it. I am a pupil of his.\"    \"Are you a pupil of Vernet's?\"    \"I am proud to be,\" said the artist. \"Wretch that I am!\" he muttered to  himself, \"I deny my gods and masters!\"    \"You have reason to be proud, my young friend,\" replied the delegate  donning the dressing-gown with the illustrious origin.    \"Hang up Monsieur Blancheron's coat in the wardrobe,\" said Schaunard to  his friend, with a significant wink.    \"Ain't he too good?\" whispered Marcel as he pounced on his prey, and  nodded towards Blancheron. \"If you could only keep a piece of him.\"    \"I'll try; but do you dress yourself, and cut. Come back by ten; I will  keep him till then. Above all, bring me something in your pocket.\"    \"I'll bring you a pineapple,\" said Marcel as he evaporated.    He dressed himself hastily; the dress-coat fit him like a glove. Then he  went out by the second door of the studio.    Schaunard set himself to work. When it was fairly night, Monsieur  Blancheron heard the clock strike six, and remembered that he had not  dined. He informed Schaunard of the fact.    \"I am in the same position,\" said the other, \"but to oblige you, I will  go without today, though I had an invitation in the Faubourg St.  Germain. But we can't break off now, it might spoil the resemblance.\"  And he painted away harder than ever. \"By the way,\" said he, suddenly,  \"we can dine without breaking off. There is a capital restaurant  downstairs, which will send us up anything we like.\" And Schaunard  awaited the effect of his trial of plurals.    \"I accept your idea,\" said Blancheron, \"an in return, I hope you will do  me the honor of keeping me company at table.\"    Schaunard bowed. \"Really,\" said he to himself, \"this is a fine fellow--a  very god-send. Will you order the dinner?\" he asked his Amphitryon.    \"You will oblige me by taking that trouble,\" replied the other,  politely.    \"So much the worse for you, my boy,\" said the painter as he pitched down  the stairs, four steps at a time. Marching up to the counter, he wrote  out a bill of fare that made the Vatel of the establishment turn pale.    \"Claret! Who's to pay for it?\"    \"Probably not I,\" said Schaunard, \"but an uncle of mine that you will  find up there, a very good judge. So, do your best, and let us have  dinner in half an hour, served on your porcelain.\"    At eight o'clock, Monsieur Blancheron felt the necessity of pouring into  a friend's ear his idea on the sugar question, and accordingly recited  his pamphlet to Schaunard, who accompanied him on the piano.    At ten, they danced the galop together.    At eleven, they swore never to separate, and to make wills in each  other's favor.    At twelve, Marcel returned, and found them locked in a mutual embrace,  and dissolved in tears. The floor was half an inch deep in fluid--either  from that cause or the liquor that had been spilt. He stumbled against  the table, and remarked the splendid relics of the sumptuous feast. He  tried the bottles, they were utterly empty. He attempted to rouse  Schaunard, but the later menaced him with speedy death, if he tore him  from his friend Blancheron, of whom he was making a pillow.    \"Ungrateful wretch!\" said Marcel, taking out of his pocket a handful of  nuts, \"when I had brought him some dinner!\"          CHAPTER III    LENTEN LOVES      One evening in Lent Rodolphe returned home early with the idea of  working. But scarcely had he sat down at his table and dipped his pen in  the ink than he was disturbed by a singular noise. Putting his ear to  the treacherous partition that separated him from the next room, he  listened, and plainly distinguished a dialogue broken by the sound of  kisses and other amourous interruptions.    \"The deuce,\" thought Rodolphe, glancing at his clock, \"it is still  early, and my neighbor is a Juliet who usually keeps her Romeo till long  after the lark has sung. I cannot work tonight.\"    And taking his hat he went out. Handing in his key at the porter's  lodge he found the porter's wife half clasped in the arms of a gallant.  The poor woman was so flustered that it was five minutes before she  could open the latch.    \"In point of fact,\" though Rodolphe, \"there are times when porters grow  human again.\"    Passing through the door he found in its recess a sapper and a cook  exchanging the luck-penny of love.    \"Hang it,\" said Rodolphe, alluding to the warrior and his robust  companion, \"here are heretics who scarcely think that we are in Lent.\"    And he set out for the abode of one of his friends who lived in the  neighborhood.    \"If Marcel is at home,\" he said to himself, \"we will pass the evening in  abusing Colline. One must do something.\"    As he rapped vigorously, the door was partly opened, and a young man,  simply clad in a shirt and an eye-glass, presented himself.    \"I cannot receive you,\" said he to Rodolphe.    \"Why not?\" asked the latter.    \"There,\" said Marcel, pointing to a feminine head that had just peeped  out from behind a curtain, \"there is my answer.\"    \"It is not a pretty one,\" said Rodolphe, who had just had the door  closed in his face. \"Ah!\" said he to himself when he got into the  street, \"what shall I do? Suppose I call on Colline, we could pass the  time in abusing Marcel.\"    Passing along the Rue de l'Ouest, usually dark and unfrequented,  Rodolphe made out a shade walking up and down in melancholy fashion, and  muttering in rhyme.    \"Ho, ho!\" said Rodolphe, \"who is this animated sonnet loitering here?  What, Colline!\"    \"What Rodolphe! Where are you going?\"    \"To your place.\"    \"You won't find me there.\"    \"What are you doing here?\"    \"Waiting.\"    \"What are you waiting for?\"    \"Ah!\" said Colline in a tone of raillery, \"what can one be waiting for  when one is twenty, when there are stars in the sky and songs in the  air?\"    \"Speak in prose.\"    \"I am waiting for a girl.\"    \"Good night,\" said Rodolphe, who went on his way continuing his  monologue. \"What,\" said he, \"is it St. Cupid's Day and cannot I take a  step without running up against people in love? It is scandalously  immoral. What are the police about?\"    As the gardens of the Luxembourg were still open, Rodolphe passed into  them to shorten his road. Amidst the deserted paths he often saw  flitting before him, as though disturbed by his footsteps, couples  mysteriously interlaced, and seeking, as a poet has remarked, the  two-fold luxury of silence and shade.    \"This,\" said Rodolphe, \"is an evening borrowed from a romance.\" And yet  overcome, despite himself, by a langourous charm, he sat down on a seat  and gazed sentimentally at the moon.    In a short time he was wholly under the spell of a feverish  hallucination. It seemed to him that the gods and heroes in marble who  peopled the garden were quitting their pedestals to make love to the  goddesses and heroines, their neighbors, and he distinctly heard the  great Hercules recite a madrigal to the Vedella, whose tunic appeared to  him to have grown singularly short.    From the seat he occupied he saw the swan of the fountain making its way  towards a nymph of the vicinity.    \"Good,\" thought Rodolphe, who accepted all this mythology, \"There is  Jupiter going to keep an appointment with Leda; provided"]]]
