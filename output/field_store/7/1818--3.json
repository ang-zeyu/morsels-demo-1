A vital part of  the constitutional role of the Courts is to ensure that all public  authorities, whether they derive their powers from statute or the  prerogative, act within the limits of those powers.    A different view was taken by Stephen J. sitting at first instance in  chambers in _R._ v. _Collins_ (1976) 8 A.L.R. 691, but we note the  opinion expressed in several Canadian cases that the Court will  intervene where a Commissioner has inquired or seeks to inquire into  matters outside his terms of reference: _Re Sedlmayr_ (1978) 82 D.L.R.  (3d.) 161; _Re Anderson_ (1978) 82 D.L.R. (3d.) 706; _Landreville_ v.  _The Queen_ (1973) 41 D.L.R. (3d.) 574; _Landreville_ v. _The Queen_  (No. 2) (1977) 75 D.L.R. (3d.) 380, 400-402.    In _Re Royal Commission on Thomas Case_ (1980) 1 N.Z.L.R. 602 a Full  Court (Molier, Holland and Thorp JJ.) held inter alia that the Court may  prohibit a Commission from acting in excess of its jurisdiction and that  the creation of a Commission pursuant to the Letters Patent does not  exempt it from the supervisory role of the Court. However part of the  Full Court's decision in that case is the subject of a pending appeal to  this Court and other proceedings relating to the Thomas Commission have  been moved into this Court. So we refrain from expressing any final view  upon it.    For the foregoing reasons we think that if the applicants make out their  claim that the findings of the Erebus Commission in paragraph 377 are  outside the commissioner's terms of reference, they could be granted a  declaration to that effect at common law. To obtain a setting aside of  the findings under s. 4 (2) of the Judicature Amendment Act 1977 they  have to show in addition that the findings were made in the exercise of  a statutory power of decision. We think this requirement should not  present final difficulty if regard is had to the evident intent and  spirit of the 1972 Act and particularly the amendments made by  Parliament in 1977.      Judicature Amendment Act 1972    Was the statutory power one of _decision_? The 1977 Amendment Act  brought statutory investigations or inquiries into rights or liabilities  within the definition of \"statutory power\". An inquiry into whether any  person caused or contributed to the crash by an act or omission in  respect of his duties is an inquiry into liabilities. But that is less  important for present purposes than the fact that the Amendment Act also  extended the concept of statutory powers of decision to those  \"affecting\" the rights of any person. The purpose was manifestly to make  the ambit of review under the Act at least as wide as at common law.  This point is dealt with in _Daemar_ v. _Gilliand_ (1981) 1 N.Z.L.R. 61.    We think it would be very difficult to justify an argument that findings  likely to affect individuals in their personal civil rights or to expose  them to prosecution under the criminal law are decision \"affecting\"  their rights within the meaning of the Act. In the present case, for  example, it was virtually certain that the findings of the Erebus  Commission would be published by the Government. The effect on the  reputation of persons found guilty of the misconduct described in the  Report was likely to be devastating, at common law every citizen has a  right not to be defamed without justification. Severe criticism by a  public officer made after a public inquiry and inevitably accompanied by  the widest publicity affects that right especially when the officer has  judicial status and none the less because he has judicial immunity.    The present case is in many ways unique and, if the findings in  paragraph 377 were made without jurisdiction or contrary to natural  justice, it affords a striking instance of how contrary to the public  interest it would be if the Courts were not prepared to protect the  right to reputation. The magnitude of the disaster, bringing tragedy to  many homes in New Zealand and overseas, and the fact that the national  airline was involved meant that the national attention was focused on  the inquiry. There are imputations of collective bad faith which had  started from a high place in the company and all this was likely to  receive the widest publicity, further, the findings in paragraph 377  amounted to public and official disclosures of alleged criminal conduct  and led to investigation by the police to determine whether charges  should be laid. In the event it was announced shortly before the hearing  of the present case that there would be no such charges, but clearly the  individuals concerned were in fact exposed to the hazard of prosecution  as a natural consequence of the Report.    In interpreting the 1977 legislation we think that a narrow conception  of rights and of what affects rights would not be in accord with the  general purposes of the Act. A broad, realistic and somewhat flexible  approach would enable the Act to work most effectively as an aid to  achieving justice in the modern community.      Natural Justice    This Court has had to examine and apply the principles concerning  natural justice and fairness quite often in recent years. In translating  the ideals of natural justice and fairness into current operation in New  Zealand we have been influenced as to general principles mainly by  decisions of the Privy Council and the House of Lords but, of course, we  have had New Zealand conditions and practicalities very much in mind.  The result has been a pragmatic approach.    Some overseas Courts have held that if all that occurs is inquiry and  report and the report is not in law a condition precedent to some  further step the rules of natural justice are automatically excluded.  That was the premise, for instance, of the High Court of Australia in  _Testro Bros. Pty. Ltd._ v. _Tait_ (1963) 109 C.L.R. 353. A contrary  approach is to be found in the judgement of Schroeder J.A. representing  the view of the majority of the Ontario Court of Appeal in _Re Ontario  Crime Commission_ (1962) 133 C.C.C. 116, although that case depends  partly on Ontario statute law. There is little attraction in the idea of  automatic exclusion. Commissions of Inquiry have compulsory statutory  powers of insisting on evidence and their findings can affect rights in  the ways already outlined. It seems to us highly unlikely that the New  Zealand Parliament intended them to be wholly free of the elementary  obligation to give persons whom they have in mind condemning a fair  opportunity for correcting or contradicting any relevant allegation.    Some reinforcement for the view that they are under that obligation is  to be found in some added considerations. Section 4A of the Commissions  of Inquiry Act, enacted in 1980 in place of briefer provisions and in  time for the Erebus inquiry, provides:         \"4A. Persons entitled to be heard--(1) Any person shall, if he is       party to the inquiry or satisfies the Commission that he has an       interest in the inquiry apart from any interest in common with the       public, be entitled to appear and be heard at the inquiry.         (2) Any person who satisfies the Commission that any evidence given       before it may adversely affect his interests shall be given an       opportunity during the inquiry to be heard in respect of the matter       to which the evidence relates.         (3) Every person entitled, or given an opportunity, to be heard       under this section may appear in person or by his counsel or       agent.\"    The section may be seen as a recognition by Parliament that natural  justice should apply. It does not purport to enact a complete code of  procedure or to cover the whole field of natural justice, which would  not be easy in a statute of this general kind. The statute specifically  requires an opportunity to be heard to be given to any person who shows  that evidence may adversely affect his interests. In the parallel  situation of the statutory investigation which must be undertaken  following any aircraft accident considerations of fairness are carefully  spelled out in Regulation 15 (1) of the Civil Aviation (Accident  Investigation) Regulations 1978. There it is provided that \"where it  appears to an Inspector that any degree of responsibility for an  accident may be attributable to any person, that person or, if he is  dead, his legal personal representatives, shall, if practicable, be  given notice that blame may be attributed to him, and that he or they  may make a statement or give evidence, and produce witnesses, and  examine any witnesses from whose evidence it appears that he may be  blameworthy\". In the case of the earlier investigation by Mr.  Chippindale into the Erebus disaster that very step was taken.    In his judgment in the Court in _Re the Royal Commission on the State  Services_ (1962) N.Z.L.R. 96, 117, Cleary J. while stressing the wide  discretion of Commissions to regulate their own procedure said plainly  that the one limitation is that parties cited and persons interested  must be afforded a fair opportunity of presenting their representations,  adducing their evidence, and meeting prejudicial matter. That judgment  was given with reference to the old s. 4A, now replaced by the section  already quoted. What Cleary J. said, particularly about the general  absence of a right to be represented by counsel, must now be read  subject to the new provisions. But his expression \"prejudicial matter\"  was a general one. It ought not, we think, to be read down in some way  so as to exclude suggestions of conspiracy which may have evolved in the  mind of a Commission without being specifically raised in evidence or  submissions.    A suggestion of an organized"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16131"],[0,"Campaign Pictures of the War in South Africa (1899-1900) (#10)"],[1,"  of the foe. If his horse was shot dead under him he coo-eed to his mates,  and kept his rifle busy, and every time the coo-ee rang out over the  whispering veldt the Australians turned in their saddles, and riding as the  men from the South-land can ride, they dashed to the rescue, and did not  leave a single man in the hands of the enemy. Many a gallant deed was done  that day by officers and men. Captain Moor gave one fellow his horse, and  made a dash for liberty on foot, but he would have failed in his effort had  not Lieutenant Darling, a West Australian boy, ridden to his aid, and  together the two officers on the one horse got back to the shelter of the  guns. The enemy still blazed away in the wildest and most farcical fashion.  Had they been Boer hunters or marksmen very few of the West Australians  would ever have got across that strip of veldt alive. As it was, only two  of them got wounded, none were killed, one or two horses were shot dead,  and then the big guns got to work in grim earnest.    A party of Boers, however, got round one of the kopjes, where some of the  Lancers were posted, and now half a dozen of those brave fellows are  missing, and I fear they are to be counted amongst those who will never  return again. Sergeant Watson, of the R.H., was killed, and several of his  men and a few of the Lancers were wounded, but the R.H. guns soon swept the  plain clear of the enemy, and they retired, carrying their dead and wounded  with them. The work for the day was done, and well done, for the enemy had  shown his hand. We knew his position and his strength, and next day we went  out in force to have a word with him, but the wily Boers kept strictly  under cover, and refused on any terms to be drawn again.                                     THE WEST AUSTRALIANS.                                                                       BETHANY.      I was feeling miserable as I sat in the hospital garden, and I rather fancy  I looked pretty much as I felt, for a cheery-faced Boer nurse, with her  black hair, blacker eyes, and rose-blossom lips, came up to where I sat,  bringing with her two or three slightly wounded Boers. \"I have brought some  Boers who know something of your countrymen, Mr. Australian,\" she said. \"I  thought you would be glad to hear all about them.\" \"By Jove! yes, nurse. If  I were not a married man, I should try to thank you gracefully.\" \"Oh, yees;  oh, yees,\" she answered, tossing back her head; \"that is all right. You say  those pretty things; then, when you go away from here, you tell your wife,  and you write in your papers we Boer girls are fat old things, who never  use soap and water. All the Rooibaatjes do that.\" And off she went,  laughing merrily, whilst my friends the enemy grinned and enjoyed the  little comedy. So we fell to talking, and-half a dozen wounded \"Tommies\"  gathered round and chipped into the conversation, which by degrees worked  round to a deed which the West Australians did; and as I listened to the  tale so simply told by those rough farmer men, I felt my face flush with  pride, and my shoulders fell back square and solid once more, whilst every  drop of blood in my veins seemed to run warm and strong, like the red wine  they grow on the hillside in my own sunny land; for the story concerned men  whom I knew well, men who were bred with the scent of the wattle in the  first breath they drew, men who grew from childhood to manhood where the  silver sentinel stars form the cross in the rich blue midnight sky. My  countrymen--Australians--men with whom I had hunted for silver in the  desolate backblocks of New South Wales; men with whom I had scoured the  interior of West Australia seeking for gold; men who had been with me on  the tin fields and opal fields. I had never doubted that they would keep  their country's name unsullied when they met the foe on the field of war,  yet when I heard the tale the enemy told I felt my eyes fill as they have  seldom filled since childhood, for I was proud of the western diggers,  proud of my blood; and at that moment, with British \"Tommies\" sprawling on  the grass at my feet, and the Boer farmers grouped amongst them, I would  sooner have called myself an Australian commoner than the son of any peer  in any other land under high heaven.    I will take the story from the Boer's mouth and tell it to you, as I hope  to tell it round a hundred camp fires when the war is over, and I go back  to the Australian bush once more. \"It happened round Colesberg way,\" he  said; \"we thought we had the British beaten, and our commandant gave us the  word to press on and cut them to pieces. Our big guns had been grandly  handled, and our rifle fire had told its tale. We saw the British falling  back from the kopjes they had held, and we thought that there was nothing  between us and victory; but there was, and we found it out before we were  many minutes older. There was one big kopje that was the very key of the  position. Our spies had told us that this was held by an Australian force.  We looked at it very anxiously, for it was a hard position to take, but  even as we watched we saw that nearly all the Australians were leaving it.  They, too, were falling back with the British troops. If we once got that  kopje there was nothing on earth could stop us. We could pass on and sweep  around the retiring foe, and wipe them off the earth, as a child wipes dirt  from its hands, and we laughed when we saw that only about twenty  Australians had been left to guard the kopje.    \"There were about four hundred of us, all picked men, and when the  commandant called to us to go and take the kopje, we sprang up eagerly, and  dashed down over some hills, meaning to cross the gully and charge up the  kopje where those twenty men were waiting for us. But we did not know the  Australians--then. We know them now. Scarcely had we risen to our feet when  they loosed their rifles on us, and not a shot was wasted. They did not  fire, as regular soldiers nearly always do, volley after volley, straight  in front of them, but every one picked his man, and shot to kill. They  fired like lightning, too, never dwelling on the trigger, yet never wildly  wasting lead, and all around us our best and boldest dropped, until we  dared not face them. We dropped to cover, and tried to pick them off, but  they were cool and watchful, throwing no chance away. We tried to crawl  from rock to rock to hem them in, but they, holding their fire until our  burghers moved, plugged us with lead, until we dared not stir a step ahead;  and all the time the British troops, with all their convoy, were slowly,  but safely, falling back through the kopjes, where we had hoped to hem them  in. We gnawed our beards and cursed those fellows who played our game as we  had thought no living men could play it Then, once again, we tried to rush  the hill, and once again they drove us back, though our guns were playing  on the heights they held. We could not face their fire. To move upright to  cross a dozen yards meant certain death, and many a Boer wife was widowed  and many a child left fatherless by those silent men who held the heights  above us. They did not cheer as we came onward. They did not play wild  music, they only clung close as climbing weeds to the rocks, and shot as we  never saw men shoot before, and never hope to see men shoot again.    \"Then we got ready to sweep the hill with guns, but our commandant,  admiring those brave few who would not budge before us in spite of our  numbers, sent an officer to them to ask them to surrender, promising them  all the honours of war. But they sent us word to come and take them if we  could. And then our officer asked them three times if they would hold up  their hands, and at the third time a grim sergeant rose and answered him:  'Aye, we will hold up our hands, but when we do, by God, you'll find a  bayonet in 'em. Go back and tell your commandant that Australia's here to  stay.' And there they stayed, and fought us hour by hour, holding us back,  when but for them victory would have been with us. We shelled them all  along their scattered line, and tried to rush them under cover of the  artillery fire; but they only held their posts with stouter hearts, and  shot the straighter when the fire was hottest, and we could do nothing but  lie there and swear at them, though we admired them for their stubborn  pluck. They held the hill till all their men were safe, and then, dashing  down the other side, they jumped into their saddles and made off, carrying  their wounded with them. They were but twenty men, and we four hundred\"    A \"Tommy\" sitting at the speaker's feet looked up and said: \"What are yer  makin' sich a song abart it far?

A Boer town is not laid out on systematic lines, as one sees towns in  America, or Canada, or Australia. The streets seem to run much as they  please, or as the exigencies of traffic have caused them to run. I doubt if  the plan of a town is ever drawn in this country. People arrive and settle  down in a happy-go-lucky manner, and straightway build themselves a home.  Their homes are places to live in; not to look at. There is an almost utter  absence of architectural adornment everywhere. My eyes range over a large  number of dwellings. They are nearly all alike--plain, square structures,  plastered snow white. There is a double door in the centre of the front,  and a window at each side of the door. A stoep, about six feet wide, rises  a foot from the pathway, and there is nothing else to be seen from the  outside front. These houses look bare and bald, and are as expressionless  as a blind baby. To me most houses have an expression of their own. In an  English town a quiet walk in the dawning, making a"]]]
