These indications are not necessarily found all in one  seal.    The most important of them is the consular date, because it helps the  student to determine, within certain limits, the date of the building  itself. The rule, however, is far from being absolute, and before fixing  the date of a Roman structure from that of its brick stamps one must  take into consideration many other points of circumstantial evidence.  When we examine, for instance, the grain warehouses at Ostia, or  Hadrian's villa at Tivoli, and find that their walls have never  undergone repairs, that their masonry is characteristic of the first  quarter of the second century, that their bricks bear the dates of  Hadrian's age and no others, we may rest assured that the stamps speak  the truth. Their evidence is, in such a case, conclusive. But if the  bricks are variously dated, or bear the names of various kilns, and not  of one or two only, then their value as an evidence of the date of a  building is diminished, if not lost altogether....    The bricks, again, occasionally bear curious signs, such as footmarks of  chickens, dogs, or pigs, which stept over them while still fresh,  impressions of coins and medals, words or sentences scratched with a  nail, etc. A bricklayer, who had perhaps seen better times in his youth,  wrote on a tile the first verse of the Aeneid.    The great manufacturing center of Roman bricks was the district between  the viae Triumphalis, Cornelia, and the two Aureliae, now called the  Monti della Creta, which includes the southern slopes of the Vatican  ridge and the northern of the Janiculum. Here also, as at Pozzo  Pantaleo, the traces of the work of man are simply gigantic. The valleys  del Gelsomino, delle Fornaci, del Vicolo delle Cave, della Balduina, and  a section of the Val d'Inferno, are not the work of nature, but the  result of excavations for \"creta figulina,\" which began 2,300 years ago,  and have never been interrupted since. A walk through the Monti della  Creta will teach the student many interesting things. The best point of  observation is a bluff between the Vicolo della Cave and the Vicolo del  Gelsomino, marked with the word \"Ruderi\" and with the altitude of 75  meters, in the military map of the suburbs. The bluff rises 37 meters  above the floor of the brick-kilns of the Gelsomino....    Roman bricks were exported to all the shores of the Mediterranean; they  have been found in the Riviera, on the coasts of Benetia, of  Narbonensis, of Spain and Africa, and in the island of Sardinia. The  brick-making business must have been very remunerative, if we judge from  the rank and wealth of many personages who had an interest in it. Many  names of emperors appear in brick-stamps, and even more of empresses and  princesses of the imperial family.          PALM SUNDAY IN ST. PETER'S[17]    BY GRACE GREENWOOD (Mrs. Lippincott)      Yesterday began Holy Week with the imposing but tedious ceremonies of  Palm Sunday at St. Peter's. At nine o'clock in the morning we were in  our places--seats erected for the occasion near the high altar, drest in  the costume prescribed by church etiquette--black throughout, with black  veils on our heads. At about ten the Pope entered, and the rites,  ordinary and extraordinary, the masses and processions, continued until  one.    The entrance of the Pope into this his grandest basilica was, as usual,  a beautiful and brilliant sight. He came splendidly vested, wearing his  miter, and borne in his chair of state under a gorgeous canopy, between  the flabelli--two enormous fans of white peacock feathers. He was  preceded and followed by cardinals, bishops, arch-bishops, monsignori,  abbots, the apostolic prothonotaries, generals of the religious orders,  officers of the state, of the army, of his household, and the Guardia  Nobile.    He took his seat on the throne, and received the homage of the  cardinals, who, kneeling, kissed his right hand. This is a ceremony  which is always gone through with in the most formal, mechanical,  business-like manner possible. Some palms, not in natural branches, but  cut and wreathed in various strange, fantastic forms, lay on the altar.  The Pope's chief sacristan took one of these, a deacon another, a  sub-deacon a third, and knelt at the foot of the throne. His Holiness  read prayers over them, sprinkled them with holy water, and incensed  them three times. One of these is held beside the throne by the prince  assistant during the service; another is borne by the Pope when in  procession.    After this, multitudes of palms were brought up for the Papal  benediction. First came the cardinals, each, as he received his palm  from the Pope, kissing it, the right hand and knee of His Holiness; then  the bishops, who only kissed the palm and his right knee; then the  abbots, who were only entitled to kiss the palm and his foot; then the  governor of Rome, the prince assistant, the auditor, the treasurer, the  maggiordomo, the secretaries, the chamberlains, the mace bearers, the  deacons and sub-deacons, generals of the religious orders and priests in  general, masters of the ceremonies, singers, clerks of the Papal chapel,  students of Roman colleges, foreign ministers and their attaches,  Italian, French, Spanish, Austrian, Russian, Prussian officers, noblemen  and gentlemen, all came up in turn, knelt, received blest palms, and  kissed the foot of the Sovereign Pontiff.    During the distribution of the palms, anthems were sung by the choir,  who were caged up in a sort of trellice workbox at the right of the  altar. This long but brilliantly picturesque ceremony through, the Pope,  after washing his hands, again mounted into his \"sedia gestatoria,\" and  bearing his palm, preceded and followed by all those to whom he had  given palms, passed slowly down the nave of the church, blessing the  kneeling and bending multitude right and left. This procession of palms  was very striking and gorgeous from the beauty and variety of military  arms and uniforms, and more than royal richness of the priestly  vestments, the gleam of miters and maces, and of innumerable sacred  symbols and insignia.          THE ELECTION OF A POPE[18]    BY CARDINAL WISEMAN      The interval between the close of one pontificate and the commencement  of another is a period of some excitement, and necessarily of much  anxiety. Time is required for the electors to assemble, from distant  provinces, or even foreign countries; and this is occupied in paying the  last tribute of respect and affection to the departed Pontiff. His body  is embalmed, clothed in the robes of his office, of the penitential  color, and laid on a couch of state within one of the chapels in St.  Peter's, so that the faithful may not only see it, but kiss its feet.  This last act of reverence to the mortal remains of the immortal Pius  VIII., the writer well recollects performing.    These preliminaries occupy three days; during which rises, as if by  magic, or from the crypts below, an immense catafalque, a colossal  architectural structure, which fills the nave of that basilica  illustrated by inscriptions, and adorned by statuary. Before this huge  monument, for nine days funeral rites are performed, closed by a funeral  oration. For the body of the last Pope there is a uniform resting-place  in St. Peter's--a plain sarcophagus, of marbled stucco, hardly noticed  by the traveler, over a door beside the choir, on which is simply  painted the title of the latest Pontiff. On the death of his successor  it is broken down at the top, the coffin is removed to the under-church,  and that of the new claimant for repose is substituted. This change  takes place late in the evening, and is considered private. I can not  recollect whether it was on this or on a subsequent occasion that I  witnessed it with my college companions....    In the afternoon of the last day of the novendiali, as they are called,  the cardinals assemble in a church near the Quirinal palace, and walk  thence in procession, accompanied by their conclavisiti, a secretary, a  chaplain, and a servant or two, to the great gate of the royal  residence, in which one will remain as master and supreme lord. Of  course the hill is crowded by persons lining the avenue kept open for  the procession. Cardinals never before seen by them, or not for many  years, pass before them; eager eyes scan and measure them, and try to  conjecture, from fancied omens in eye, or figure, or expression, who  will shortly be the sovereign of their fair city, and, what is more, the  Head of the Catholic Church from the rising to the setting sun.    Equal they pass the threshold of that gate; they share together the  supreme rule, temporal and spiritual; there is still embosomed in them  all the voice yet silent, that soon will sound, from one tongue, over  all the world, and the dormant germ of that authority which will soon  again be concentrated in one man alone. To-day they are all equal;  perhaps to-morrow one will sit enthroned, and all the rest will kiss his  feet; one will be sovereign, the others his subjects; one the shepherd,  and the others his flock....    While we have been thus sketching, hastily and imperfectly, one of many  who passed almost unnoticed in the solemn procession to conclave, on the  2d of September, 1823, we may suppose the doors to have been inexorably  closed on those who composed it. The conclave, which formerly used to  take place in the Vatican, was on this occasion, and has been  subsequently, held in the Quirinal palace. This noble building, known  equally by the name of Monte Cavallo, consists of a large quadrangle,  round which run the papal apartments. From this stretches out, along a  whole street, an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18846"],[0,"Voodoo Planet (#10)"],[1,"finding a  rising cliff wall which could not be easily climbed. Two more graz went  down, one badly wounded, one safely dead. Behind them more white heads  came from the brush. What original cause had started the stampede the  fugitives could not guess, but now the fear and anger of the animals  were centering upon them.    And, in spite of their efforts, the party was being herded into a pocket  between the jungle below, where the main body of graz crashed along, and  a steep wall. Given time to find the necessary finger and toe holds, a  man might climb that wall, but they could not attempt it now. The  portion of ledge on which they ran, stopped to fire, and then ran on  again, angled to the southeast. And so they came to its end quickly, a  drop ending in a plain of yellow-gray mud studded with clumps of  bleached vegetation which led, like steppingstones, toward a tangle of  matted, sickly looking plants and reeds.    \"All right,\" Tau faced around, \"what do we do now? Space lift? And using  what for wings or jets?\"    As if the graz could sense that they now had their victims safely  cornered, what must have been a goodly segment of the herd hooked their  way from the jungle and started up. Puffing, digging in those sturdy  legs which had to take the massive weight of their barrel-shaped bodies,  they made their way determinedly up-grade. One might almost believe that  they had intelligently planned this end for their drive.    \"We go down!\" Asaki yelled, and used his needler on the leader of that  climbing platoon.    \"The brush islands,\" Nymani amended. \"I show you!\" He thrust his needler  at Jellico and was over the edge of the ledge, hanging by his hands and  swinging his weight back and forth like a pendulum. At the up-swing of  his body to the right, he let go and plunged out, landing half across  one of the reed islets. The Khatkan clawed his way to his knees, gained  his feet, and leaped for the next bit of solid ground.    \"You, Thorson!\" Jellico jerked his head at Dane and the younger spaceman  holstered his fire ray, slipped gingerly over the drop and prepared to  repeat Nymani's feat as best he could.    He was not quite as successful with his sidewise swing, landing with  only his forearms across the islet, the rest of his body being swiftly  embedded in what was ooze covered only with a thin crust of dried  matter. The stench of the stuff was sickening, but the fear of being  entrapped in it gave him the necessary impetus to push forward, though  what was meant to be a swift half-dive was more of a worm's progress. He  grabbed frantically at brittle stems, at coarse grass which cut like  knives at his hands. But some of the material held and he lay face down  on a lump which did not give under his weight.    There was no time to linger; he had to get to the next patch, to free  this dubious landing place for the men embattled on the rise above.  Stumbling up, Dane judged the distance with a space-trained eye and  jumped to a knob Nymani had already quitted. The Khatkan was more than  halfway along toward that promise of solid ground which the tangled mass  of leprous vegetation led to, zigzagging expertly from islet to islet.    There was a crash and a roar behind. Dane balanced on the third of the  minute islands to look back. He saw the lash of blaster fire on the top  of the cliff, Tau on his knees on the first of their chain of  steppingstones, and a graz sprawled head and forequarters in the sucking  muck where it had dived past the two defenders above. Needler and  blaster fired together again, and then Jellico swung over the cliff rim.  Tau waved vigorously and Dane took off for the next islet, just making  it by lucky chance.    The rest of the journey he took in a rush, trying not to think of  anything but the necessity of landing on some spot of firm ground. His  last leap of all was too short, so that he went knee deep in a  particularly evil-smelling pool where yellow scum spattered his breeches  and he experienced the insidious pull of the bottomless stuff. A stout  branch whipped across his shoulder and he caught it. With Nymani's wiry  strength on the other end, Dane worked free and sat, white-faced and  shivering, on a mat of brush, while the Khatkan hunter turned his  attention to the safety of Tau, the next arrival.    More fortunate, or more skillful than Dane, the medic made the hop from  the last tuft without mishap. But he was blowing heavily as he collapsed  beside the other spaceman. Together they watched the progress of their  captain.    Safe on the second tussock from the shore, Jellico halted, edged  carefully around and used the needler Nymani had left with him. A shaggy  head tossed and the bull fronting Asaki on the cliff went down. The  Chief Ranger dodged quickly to the right and a second beast rushed out  and over, to join its mired comrade in the swamp below. As Jellico shot  again, the Khatkan slung his needler and went over to gain the first  islet.    One more graz was wounded but luckily it hunched about, turning its  formidable tusks on those that followed, thus keeping the path clear for  its enemies. Jellico was making the journey, sure-footedly, with the  Chief Ranger only one hillock behind. Tau sighed.    \"Someday maybe this will be just another tall tale and we'll all be  thought liars when we spout it,\" he observed. \"That is if we survive to  tell it. So now which way do we go? If I had my choice it would be up!\"    When Dane pulled himself to his feet and surveyed their small refuge, he  was ready to agree to that. For the space, packed with dead and dying  vegetable matter until one sank calf deep, was a triangle with a narrow  point running east into the swamp.    \"They don't give up easily, do they?\" Jellico looked back to the shore  and the cliff. Though the wounded graz bull still held the heights  against its fellows, there were others breaking from the jungle on the  lower level, wandering back and forth to paw the earth, rip up soil with  their tusks, and otherwise threaten anyone who would try to return to  the strip they patrolled.    \"They will not,\" Asaki answered bleakly. \"Arouse a graz and it will  trail you for days; kill any of the herd and you have little hope of  escaping them on foot.\"    It would seem now that the swamp was a deterrent to pursuit. The two  beasts that had fallen in the mire moaned in a pitiful rising note. They  had ceased to struggle and several of their kind clustered on the shore  near them, calling entreatingly. Asaki took careful aim with the needler  and put one animal after another out of its misery. But the flash of  those shots angered those on shore to a higher pitch of rage.    \"No going back,\" he said. \"At least not for several days.\"    Tau slapped a black, four-winged insect which had settled on his arm,  its jaws wide open for a sampling bite. \"We can't very well perch here  until they forget all about us,\" he pointed out. \"Not without water we  can trust, and with the local wild life ready to test us for tasty  eating.\"    Nymani had prowled along the swampward point of their island, and now he  made his report.    \"There is more high land to the east. Perhaps it will give us a bridge  across.\"    At that moment Dane doubted his ability to make any more leaps from  island to island. And it would seem Tau shared his discouragement.    \"I don't suppose you could discourage our friends on shore there with a  few more shots?\"    Asaki shook his head. \"We do not have clips enough to settle a whole  herd. These might retreat from sight but they would be waiting for us in  the bush, and that would mean certain death. We shall have to take the  swamp road.\"    If Dane had considered their earlier march misery, this was sheer  torture. Since footing was never secure, falls were frequent, and within  a quarter-hour they were all plastered with evil-smelling slime and mud  which hardened to rock consistency when exposed to the air. Painful as  this was, it did protect a portion of their bodies from the insects with  which the swamp was well stocked.    And, in spite of their efforts to find a way out, the only possible  paths led them deeper into the center of the unexplored morass. At last  Asaki called a halt and a council to consider retreat. To locate an  island from which they could at least watch the shore appealed very  strongly indeed.    \"We have to have water.\" Tau's voice was a harsh croak, issuing out of a  mask of green mud festooned with trailing weeds.    \"This ground is rising.\" Asaki smacked the stock of his needler against  the surface on which he crouched. \"I think perhaps there may be clean  land soon to come.\"    Jellico hitched his way up a sapling, now bending under his weight.  Through the vision lenses he studied the route ahead.    \"You're right about that,\" he called to the Chief Ranger. \"There's a  showing of the right sort of green to the left, about half a mile on.  And,\" he glanced about at the westering sun, \"we have about an hour yet  of good light in which to make it. I wouldn't try such a run after  dark.\"    That promise of green bolstered their weary spirits for a last  exhausting effort. Once again they were faced with a series of islet  leaps, and now they carried with them brush culled from the bigger  tussocks to aid in times of need.    When Dane scrambled up the last pull, staggered, and went down to his  knees again, he knew he was done. He did not even move at an excited cry  from Nymani, echoed a moment later by Asaki. It was not until the latter  leaned over him, a canteen open in his hand, that Dane aroused a little.    \"Drink!\" the Khatkan urged. \"We have found a water tree. This is fresh.\"    The liquid might have been fresh, but it also had a peculiar taste,  which Dane did not note until he had gulped down a generous swallow. At  that moment he was past caring about anything but the fact that he did  have a portion of drinkable stuff in hand."]]]
