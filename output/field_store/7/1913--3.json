It had never seemed to  matter at home if the breakfast were late and she arrived at Miss  Harmon's when the clock had struck nine, but at \"The High\" it was an  affair of vital importance to be in her seat before call-over, and she  daily blessed the punctuality of Aunt Harriet's cook. It was also a  great boon to be able to prepare her lessons in quiet. Her family had  never realized the necessity of silence during study hours, and she had  been used to learn French vocabularies or translate her Latin exercises  to a distracting accompaniment of Ernie's trumpet, Dorrie's and Mamie's  quarrels, Godfrey's mouth organ, and Letty's strumming upon the piano.    \"It would have been utterly impossible to do my prep. at home!\" she  thought sometimes. \"I'd no idea what work was like before I came to  Seaton 'High'! It would do those youngsters good to have a drilling! I  wish they could have been in the Preparatory. No, I don't! Because then  I should have had them here, and it would have been good-by to all  peace. On the whole things are much better as they are.\"    Miss Beach was so extremely busy with her own multifarious occupations  that she had not time to see very much of her great-niece. She made  every arrangement for her comfort, however, and caused the piano to be  moved into the dining-room for the convenience of her practicing. She  had always had a tender spot for Winona, whom she regarded as the one  hopeful character in a family of noodles. She talked to her at meal  times about a variety of subjects, some of them within her intelligence,  but others completely--so far--above her head. She even tried to draw  her out upon school matters. This, however, was a dead failure. Winona,  most unfortunately, could not overcome her awe for her aunt, and refused  to expand. To all the questions about her Form, her companions,  teachers, lessons or new experiences, she replied in monosyllables. It  was a sad pity, for Miss Beach had really hoped to win the girl's  confidence and prove a temporary mother to her, but finding her advances  repulsed she also shrank back into her shell, and the intimacy which  might have existed between them was postponed to future years. Young  folks often fail to realize what an interest their doings may have to  grown-up people, and how their bright fresh outlook on life may come as  a tonic to older and wearier minds. It never struck Winona to try to  amuse or entertain her aunt. At her present crude stage of development  she was incapable of appreciating the subtle pathos that clings round  elderly lives, and their wistful longing to be included in the  experiences of the rising generation. Shyness and lack of perception  held her silent, and the empty corner in Aunt Harriet's heart went  unfilled.    Saturday and Sunday were the only days upon which Winona had time to  feel homesick. Her mother had at first suggested her returning to  Highfield for the week ends, but Miss Beach had strongly vetoed the  project on the justifiable ground that even the earliest train from  Ashbourne on Monday mornings did not reach Seaton till 9.30, so that  Winona would lose the first hour's lesson of her school week. She might  have added that she considered such frequent home visits would prove  highly unsettling and interfere greatly with her work, but for once she  refrained from stating her frank opinion, probably deeming the other  argument sufficient, and willing to spare Mrs. Woodward's feelings.    Letters from Highfield showed little change in the usual conduct of  family affairs. The children were still attending Miss Harmon's school,  though they were to leave at Christmas.    \"We are late nearly every day now you are not here to make Ernie  start,\" wrote Mamie, almost as if it were an achievement to be proud of.  \"He locked the piano and threw the key in the garden, and we could none  of us practice for three days. Wasn't it lovely? Letty pours out tea if  mother isn't in, and yesterday she broke the teapot.\"    The chief items of news, however, concerned Percy. That young gentleman,  with what Aunt Harriet considered his usual perversity, had sprained his  ankle on the very day before he ought to have returned to school. He had  been ordered to lie up on the sofa, but Winona gathered that the  doctor's directions had not been very strictly carried out. She strongly  suspected that the patient did not wish to recover too quickly. Whether  or not that had been the case, Percy was now convalescent, and was to  set off for school on the following Friday. Longworth College was not a  great distance, and as Percy would have to pass through Seaton on his  way, Aunt Harriet invited him to break his journey there and spend the  night at her house. She had a poor opinion of the boy's capacity, but  having undertaken a half share in his education she felt an increased  sense of responsibility towards him, and wished to find an opportunity  of a word with him in private.    Winona hailed her brother's advent with immense joy. Even so flying a  visit was better than nothing. Letters were an inadequate means of  expression, and she was longing to pour out all her new experiences. She  wanted to tell Percy about the Symposium, and her friendship for Garnet,  and the chemistry class, and the gymnasium practice, and to show him  her hockey jersey which had just arrived. She had so long been the  recipient of all his school news that it would be delightful to turn the  tables and give him a chronicle of her own doings at the Seaton \"High,\"  which in her opinion quite rivaled Longworth College.    To the young people's scarcely suppressed satisfaction, Miss Beach went  out after tea to attend an important meeting, leaving her nephew and  niece to spend the evening alone together. They had never expected such  luck. As it was Friday Winona had no lessons to prepare for the next  day, and could feel free for a delightful chat. She flung herself into  Aunt Harriet's special big easy chair by the fireside, and lounged  luxuriously, while Percy, boy-like, prowled about the room.    \"Well, I'm glad you're jogging along all right,\" he remarked when his  sister's long account came to a pause. \"Though please don't for a moment  compare your blessed old High School to Longworth, for they're not in  the same running! Aunt Harriet hasn't quite eaten you up yet, I see?\"    \"She's not such a Gorgon as I expected. In fact she's been rather  decent.\"    \"The dragon's sheathed her talons? Well, that's good biz. You went off  as tragic as Iphigenia, heroically declaring yourself the family  sacrifice.\"    \"Did I?\" Winona had almost forgotten her original attitude of martyr.  Three weeks had made a vast difference to her feelings.    \"If you can peg it out in comfort with the dragon so much to the good.  Shouldn't care to live here myself though. It's a dull hole. Number 10,  Abbey Close wouldn't be my choice of a residence.\"    \"Well, it's not likely you'll ever have the chance of living here!\"  retorted Winona, taking up the cudgels for her adopted home.    \"I don't know about that,\" returned Percy. \"The house belongs to Aunt  Harriet. She'll have to leave her property to somebody, I suppose, when  she shuffles off this mortal coil. I'm the eldest son, and my name's  Percy Beach Woodward. That ought to count for something.\"    \"Aunt Harriet's not going to die yet,\" said Winona gravely. \"I think  it's horrid of you to talk like this!\"    \"Oh, I don't wish the old girl any harm, but one may have an eye to the  future all the same,\" was the airy response. \"D'you remember Jack  Cassidy who was a pupil at the Vicarage? His aunt left him five thousand  pounds.\"    \"Yes, and I heard he's muddling it away as fast as he can. Mary James  told me. Her father's guardian of part of his property until he's  twenty-five, you know.\"    \"He's a topper, is Jack! He's promised to take me for a day sometime to  Hartleburn, when the races are on. Now don't you go blabbing, or I'll  never tell you anything again!\"    \"Mr. Joynson said--\"    \"Oh, for goodness sake shut up! A boy of sixteen isn't going to be  bear-led by an old fogey like Joynson. He has the mater far too much  under his finger and thumb for my taste. If you want to be chums with  me, don't preach!\"    Winona was silent. Her brother's infatuation for the Vicar's scapegrace  ward was the affair of a year ago. She had hoped he had forgotten it.  His escapades at the time, in company with his hero, had caused his  mother to seek the advice and guidance of her trustee.    \"Some one was telling me the other day that old oak furniture is worth a  tremendous lot of money now,\" continued Percy, his eye roving round the  room with an air almost of future proprietorship. \"If that's so these  things of Aunt Harriet's are a little gold mine. There was an account of  a sale in the newspaper, with a picture of a cupboard that fetched two  hundred pounds. It was first cousin to that!\" nodding at a splendidly  carved old piece which faced him.    Miss Beach's household goods were inherited from her great-grandfather,  and included some fine specimens of oak, as well as rare Chippendale.  Winona was too young to be a connoisseur of antiquities, but she had the  curiosity to rise from her chair and join Percy in his inspection of the  article in question.    \"I tell you they're as alike as two peas!\" he declared. \"Same shape,  same sort of carving, same knobs at the end! The reason why I remember  the thing is that the buyer found a secret drawer in it after he'd got  it home, with some old rubbish inside, and there was a lawsuit as to who  owned these. He claimed he'd bought the lot with the cupboard, but the  judge made him turn them up to the family of the original owner. That  was why there was a picture of the cupboard in the newspaper. It put an  arrow showing the place of the secret drawer. I wonder if there's one  here, too?"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18087"],[0,"Historic Doubts Relative To Napoleon Buonaparte (#10)"],[1," SMALL LETTER  TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}, have formed and executed the design  of bringing home for honourable interment the remains of their  illustrious Chief.    How many persons have actually inspected these relics, I have not  ascertained; but that a real coffin, containing real bones, was  brought from St. Helena to France, I see no reason to disbelieve.    Whether future visitors to St. Helena will be shown merely the  identical _place_ in which Buonaparte was (_said_ to have been)  interred, or whether another set of real bones will be exhibited in  that island, we have yet to learn.    This latter supposition is not very improbable. It was something of a  credit to the island, an attraction to strangers, and a source of  profit to some of the inhabitants, to possess so remarkable a relic;  and this glory and advantage they must naturally wish to retain. If  so, there seems no reason why they should not have a Buonaparte of  their own; for there is, I believe, no doubt that there are, or were,  several Museums in England, which, among other curiosities, boasted,  each, of a genuine skull of Oliver Cromwell.    Perhaps, therefore, we shall hear of several well authenticated skulls  of Buonaparte also, in the collections of different virtuosos, all of  whom (especially those in whose own crania the \"organ of wonder\" is  the most largely developed) will doubtless derive equal satisfaction  from the relics they respectively possess.          POSTSCRIPT TO THE NINTH EDITION.      The Public has been of late much interested and not a little  bewildered, by the accounts of many strange events, said to have  recently taken place in France and other parts of the Continent. Are  these accounts of such a character as to allay, or to strengthen and  increase, such doubts as have been suggested in the foregoing pages?    We are told that there is now a Napoleon Buonaparte at the head of the  government of France. It is not, indeed, asserted that he is the very  original Napoleon Buonaparte himself. The death of that personage, and  the transportation of his genuine bones to France, had been too widely  proclaimed to allow of his reappearance in his own proper person. But  \"uno avulso, non deficit alter.\" Like the Thibetian worshippers of the  Dalai Lama, (who never dies; only his soul transmigrates into a fresh  body), the French are so resolved, we are told, to be under a  Buonaparte--whether that be (see note to p. 56) a man or \"a  system\"--that they have found, it seems, a kind of new incarnation of  this their Grand Lama, in a person said to be the nephew of the  original one.    And when, on hearing that this personage now fills the high office of  President of the French Republic, we inquire (very naturally) _how he  came there_, we are informed that, several years ago, he invaded  France in an English vessel, (the _English_--as was observed in p.  52--having always been suspected of keeping Buonaparte ready, like the  winds in a Lapland witch's bag, to be let out on occasion,) at the  head of a force, not, of six hundred men, like his supposed uncle in  his expedition from Elba, but of fifty-five,(!) with which he landed  at Boulogne, proclaimed himself emperor, and was joined by no less  than _one_ man! He was accordingly, we are told, arrested, brought to  trial, and sentenced to imprisonment; but having, some years after,  escaped from prison, and taken refuge in England, (_England_ again!)  he thence returned to France: AND SO the French nation placed  him at the head of the government!    All this will doubtless be received as a very probable tale by those  who have given full credit to all the stories I have alluded to in the  foregoing pages.          POSTSCRIPT TO THE ELEVENTH EDITION.      When any dramatic piece _takes_--as the phrase is--with the Public, it  will usually be represented again and again with still-continued  applause; and sometimes imitations of it will be produced; so that the  same drama in substance will, with occasional slight variations in the  plot, and changes of names, long keep possession of the stage.    Something like this has taken place with respect to that curious  tragi-comedy--the scene of it laid in France--which has engaged the  attention of the British public for about sixty years; during which it  has been \"exhibited to crowded houses\"--viz., coffee-houses,  reading-rooms, &c., with unabated interest.    The outline of this drama, or series of dramas, may be thus sketched:    _Dramatis Personae._    A. A King or other Sovereign.    B. His Queen.    C. The Heir apparent.    D. E. F. His Ministers.    G. H. I. J. K. Demagogues.    L. A popular leader of superior ingenuity, who becomes ultimately  supreme ruler under the title of Dictator, Consul, Emperor, King,  President, or some other.    Soldiers, Senators, Executioners, and other functionaries, Citizens,  Fishwomen, &c.    _Scene_, Paris.    (1.) The first Act of one of these dramas represents a monarchy,  somewhat troubled by murmurs of disaffection, suspicions of  conspiracy, &c.    (2.) Second Act, a rebellion; in which ultimately the government is  overthrown.    (3.) Act the third, a provisional government established, on  principles of liberty, equality, fraternity, &c.    (4.) Act the fourth, struggles of various parties for power, carried  on with sundry intrigues, and sanguinary conflicts.    (5.) Act the fifth, the re-establishment of some form of absolute  monarchy.    And from this point we start afresh, and begin the same business over  again, with sundry fresh interludes.    All this is highly amusing to the English Public to _hear_ and _read_  of; but I doubt whether our countrymen would like to be actual  _performers_ in such a drama.    Whether the French really are so, or whether they are mystifying us in  the accounts they send over, I will not presume to decide. But if the  former supposition be the true one,--if they have been so long really  acting over and over again in their own persons such a drama, it must  be allowed that they deserve to be characterized as they have been in  the description given of certain European nations: \"An Englishman,\" it  has been said, \"is never happy but when he is miserable; a Scotchman  is never at home but when he is abroad; an Irishman is never at peace  but when he is fighting; a Spaniard is never at liberty but when he is  enslaved; and a Frenchman is never settled but when he is engaged in a  revolution.\"          POSTSCRIPT TO THE TWELFTH EDITION.      \"Time\" says the proverb, \"rings Truth to light.\" But the process is  gradual and slow. The debt is paid, as it were, by instalments. It is  only bit by bit, and at considerable intervals, that Truth comes forth  as the morning twilight to dispel the mists of fiction.    It is above forty years that men have been debating the question:--Who  were the parties that burned the city of Moscow?--without ever  thinking of the preliminary question, whether it ever was burnt at  all. And now at length we learn that it never was.    The following extract from a New Orleans paper contains the  information obtained by an American traveller--one of that great  nation whose accuracy as to facts is so well known--who visited the  spot.        INCIDENTS OF TRAVEL--CITY OF MOSCOW.      Senator Douglas is said to have made the discovery, while    travelling in Russia, that the city of Moscow was never burned!    The following statement of the matter is from the Muscatine    (Iowa) Inquirer:      \"Coming on the boat, a few days ago, we happened to fall in    company with Senator Douglas, who came on board at Quincy, on his    way to Warsaw. In the course of a very interesting account of his    travels in Russia, much of which has been published by    letter-writers, he stated a fact which has never yet been    published, but which startlingly contradicts the historical    relation of one of the most extraordinary events that ever fell    to the lot of history to record. For this reason the Judge said    he felt a delicacy in making the assertion, that the city of    Moscow was never burned!      \"He said, that previous to his arrival at Moscow, he had several    disputes with his guide as to the burning of the city, the guide    declaring that it never occurred, and seeming to be nettled at    Mr. Douglas's persistency in his opinion; but, on examining the    fire-marks around the city, and the city itself, he became    satisfied that the guide was correct.      \"The statement goes on to set forth that the antiquity of the    architectural city--particularly of its 'six hundred first-class    churches,' stretching through ante-Napoleonic ages to Pagan    times, and showing the handiwork of different nations of    History--demonstrates that the city never was burned down (or    up).\"      The Inquirer adds:      \"The Kremlin is a space of several hundred acres, in the heart of    the city, in the shape of a flat iron, and is enclosed, by a wall    of sixty feet high. Within this enclosure is the most magnificent    palace in Europe, recently built, but constructed over an ancient    palace, which remains, thus enclosed, whole and perfect, with all    its windows, &c.      \"Near the Kremlin, surrounded by a wall, is a Chinese town,    appearing to be several hundred years old, still occupied by    descendants of the original settlers.      \"The circumstances which gave rise to the errors concerning the    burning of Moscow, were these:--It is a city of four hundred and    fifty thousand inhabitants, in circular form, occupying a large    space, five miles across. There the winters are six months long,    and the custom was, and still is, to lay up supplies of    provisions and wood to last six months of severe cold weather. To    prevent these gigantic supplies from encumbering the heart of the    city, and yet render them as convenient as practicable to every    locality, a row of wood houses was constructed"]]]
