The wine which they made in those foaming  wine-presses was, of course, mild and harmless as compared with the  distilled liquors of modern times. But even Canaanitish wine could  deaden men's consciences and make them more like beasts than men.  \"Wine is a mocker,\" said one of the sages who wrote the book of  Proverbs, \"strong drink is raging, and he that is deceived thereby is  not wise.\"      IDOLATRY IN CANAAN    Canaanite religion was to a large extent an unwholesome influence. The  Canaanites worshiped many gods. Each village had its Baal, or lord,  who had to be bribed with burnt offerings of fat beasts, or (as they  thought) the soil would lose its fertility and the crops would fail.    =Dangerous examples.=--These sacrificial rites were carried on in the  shrines or \"high places,\" one of which stood outside almost every  village and town. They often were accompanied by dances and other  performances which were licentious and degrading. The Hebrews, of  course, were pledged to worship only Jehovah. Moreover, during these  first centuries in Canaan they were very poor, and had little time for  the carousals which went on at the \"high places\" in the name of  religion. Corruption usually comes with wealth and luxury. Poverty and  hardship are often useful safeguards. But from the beginning these  heathen rites were a temptation and a snare in the lives of the  Hebrews.      CANAANITE BELIEFS ABOUT THE WORLD    There are certain questions which awaken the curiosity of everyone.  How did this wonderful world come into existence? How is it that you  and I happen to be here? How did things in general come to be as they  are? Some of these difficult questions are to-day being partly  answered by careful students of science. In ancient times there was  little or no science, yet in every country there were certain answers  to these questions handed down from generation to generation and  generally accepted as true.    =Idolatrous stories of creation.=--When the Hebrews entered Canaan  they naturally were inclined to accept the ideas of the earlier  inhabitants of that country, whose knowledge in regard to many matters  was far beyond theirs. The Canaanites in turn had got most of their  ideas from the leading civilized nations of that day, the Egyptians,  and especially the Babylonians. From these sources had come certain  stories about the beginning of things.    Babylonian traders in the inns of Canaan used to tell a story of the  creation of the world, and also about a great flood which the gods  once sent upon the earth.    =How the Hebrews retold these stories.=--The best men among the  Hebrews knew that these stories were imperfect. Their forty years  training in the wilderness had made them wise in the ways of God. This  wisdom enabled them to sift the wheat from the chaff. They retold  these stories, omitting the error, and retaining the truth. Thus we  come to have the wonderful stories of the creation and the flood as we  find them in the Bible.    =How these stories were handed down.=--In the earliest days of the  settlement in Canaan very few Hebrews, if any, could read or write.  Possibly Moses understood the Egyptian picture-writing, or the  wedge-shaped letters of the Babylonian clay tablets. The Hebrew  letters, however, in which the books of the Old Testament afterward  were written, were invented by the Phoenicians, and the Phoenicians  passed on their invention to the old Canaanites.    After the Hebrews came it was not long before ambitious Hebrew boys  and girls were staring at the queer marks in the inscriptions which  they found here and there, over the gates of Canaanite cities or on  the tombs of Canaanite kings. Gradually they learned to spell out  syllables, words, and sentences, and then they learned to copy these  same letters, so that in time the Hebrews were making inscriptions and  books of their own. Among the earliest of these books was one  containing the stories of the creation and the flood. They had been  handed down by word of mouth from one generation to another, until  finally they were gathered into a book. This became a part of the book  of Genesis in our Bible.      NEW TENDENCIES TO SELFISHNESS IN CANAAN    Another and different kind of temptation which the Hebrews met in  Canaan was the tendency to forget their own tribal brothers as they  scattered here and there and settled down, each family with its own  little farm. There were some, naturally, who were more successful as  farmers than others. And those who were unfortunate were not always  the lazy or thriftless. Sickness or accident or some pest which  attacked the grain or the cattle would sometimes wipe out the entire  property of one of those little peasant farmers and leave him and his  children face to face with starvation and death. Now, in the old days  in the desert, as long as the tribe had a crust of bread or a drop of  water, the weakest and poorest could count on a share. But here in  Canaan the poor, the widow, the orphan, did not always feel so surely  the sheltering arms of kindness and brotherhood.    =Humane laws enacted.=--Yet the spirit of Moses still lived and made  its power felt. Certain laws gradually came to be accepted during this  period when the Hebrews were learning to be farmers which were a  special protection to the poor and helpless, just as the great leader  would have chosen. We can imagine how these laws were first proclaimed  by the chiefs of the clans and the elders of the villages wherever  there were men who remembered how, years before, the whole nation had  been poor and oppressed and enslaved. Here are some examples:        =\"Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child. If      thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, I      will surely hear their cry.\"=        =\"If thou lend money to any of my people with thee that is      poor, thou shalt not be to him as a creditor; neither shall      ye lay upon him usury. If thou at all take thy neighbor's      garment to pledge, thou shalt restore it unto him before the      sun goeth down; for that is his only covering, it is his      garment for his skin: wherein shall he sleep? And it shall      come to pass when he crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I      am gracious.\"=        =\"Thou shalt not oppress thy neighbor, nor rob him; the wages      of a hired servant shall not abide with thee all night until      the morning.\"=    There is one law which illustrates especially well how the best men  among the Hebrews tried to meet the new temptations of Canaan in the  spirit of kindness and justice which they had learned from Moses.        =\"When ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not      wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou      gather the gleaning of the harvest. And thou shalt not glean      thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather the fallen fruit of      thy vineyard. Thou shalt leave them for the poor and the      stranger.\"=    It was already the custom among the Canaanites to leave the grain in  the corners of the fields uncut, and not to pick up the scattered  gleanings, which fell from the arms of the harvesters, and to leave on  the ground the fruit that fell of itself from the vines and fruit  trees. With the Canaanites this was on account of a superstition; the  gleanings and the grain in the corners of the fields were for the  Baal, or god of the field. If they were taken he would be angry. The  Hebrews kept the old custom, but with a different aim--not to keep the  Baal in good humor, but to make life a bit easier for the poor and  unfortunate among their own neighbors. It was in accordance with this  law that Ruth, although a foreigner, was allowed to glean after the  reapers in the barley field of Boaz of Bethlehem, and thus obtained  food to keep herself and her mother alive. So among these lowly people  were being laid the foundations of that greater and better  civilization for which Moses had prepared the way, and of which  Abraham had dimly dreamed.      STUDY TOPICS    1. What parts of this chapter illustrate the special talent of the  Hebrews for discovering good in things partly evil?    2. How could this talent be used in our American life? For example, in  the matter of moving picture shows?    3. Read Leviticus 19. This chapter contains laws which were made  during the period of the settlement in Canaan. Which of them seem to  you to be in the spirit of Moses?          CHAPTER XI    LESSONS IN COOPERATION      After the Hebrews began to be settled in Canaan, not only were they  tempted to neglect the poor and unfortunate; they also failed to stand  together against their enemies. Each tribe and clan seemed to care  only for its own safety.    The men of Judah in the south, the Ephraimites in central Canaan, and  the Naphtalites in the northern hills, and Gilead and Reuben across  the Jordan--each group tried to fight its own battles. Often they  fought with each other. There was a bloody war between the men of  Gilead, and their cousins, the Ephraimites on the opposite side of the  Jordan. The Ephraimites crossed the river and attacked the Gileadites,  and were badly beaten; when they tried to get back home again, they  found the Gileadites holding the fords of the river. Each fugitive was  asked, \"Are you an Ephraimite?\" If he said \"No,\" they would order him  to say \"Shibboleth\" (a Hebrew word). And if he said \"Sibboleth\" (the  Gileadite dialect), and did not pronounce it exactly right, then they  would kill him.    This was only one example of the many wars between the tribes. There  was no central government to keep the peace. This age in their history  is sometimes called the period of the Judges. But these judges did not  rule over the whole land. Most of them were only petty champions, each  of whom helped his own tribe to defend itself against its enemies."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18193"],[0,"Ways of Wood Folk (#10)"],[1,"ugh,  and almost held my breath, they were so near. Just below me, within  six feet, was a big drake, with head drawn down so close to his body  that I wondered what he had done with his neck. His eyes were closed;  he was fast asleep. In front of him were eight or ten more ducks close  together, all with heads under their wings. Scattered about in the  grass everywhere were small groups, sleeping, or pluming their glossy  dark feathers.    Beside the pleasure of watching them, the first black ducks that I had  ever seen unconscious, there was the satisfaction of thinking how  completely they had been outwitted at their own game of sharp  watching. How they would have jumped had they only known what was  lying there in the grass so near their hiding place! At first, every  time I saw a pair of little black eyes wink, or a head come from under  a wing, I felt myself shrinking close together in the thought that I  was discovered; but that wore off after a time, when I found that the  eyes winked rather sleepily, and the necks were taken out just to  stretch them, much as one would take a comfortable yawn.    [Illustration]    Once I was caught squarely, but the grass and my being so near saved  me. I had raised my head and lay with chin in my hands, deeply  interested in watching a young duck making a most elaborate toilet,  when from the other side an old bird shot suddenly into the open water  and saw me as I dropped out of sight. There was a low, sharp quack  which brought every duck out of his hiding, wide awake on the instant.  At first they all bunched together at the farther side, looking  straight at the bank where I lay. Probably they saw my feet, which  were outside the covert as I lay full length. Then they drew gradually  nearer till they were again within the fringe of water-grass. Some of  them sat quite up on their tails by a vigorous use of their wings, and  stretched their necks to look over the low bank. Just keeping still  saved me. In five minutes they were quiet again; even the young duck  seemed to have forgotten her vanity and gone to sleep with the others.    Two or three hours I lay thus and watched them through the grass,  spying very rudely, no doubt, into the seclusion of their home life.  As the long shadow of the western hill stretched across the pool till  it darkened the eastern bank, the ducks awoke one by one from their  nap, and began to stir about in preparation for departure. Soon they  were collected at the center of the open water, where they sat for a  moment very still, heads up, and ready. If there was any signal given  I did not hear it. At the same moment each pair of wings struck the  water with a sharp splash, and they shot straight up in that  remarkable way of theirs, as if thrown by a strong spring. An instant  they seemed to hang motionless in the air high above the water, then  they turned and disappeared swiftly over the eastern hill toward the  marshes.          V. AN ORIOLE'S NEST.      [Illustration]    How suggestive it is, swinging there through sunlight and shadow from  the long drooping tips of the old elm boughs! And what a delightful  cradle for the young orioles, swayed all day long by every breath of  the summer breeze, peeping through chinks as the world sweeps by,  watching with bright eyes the boy below who looks up in vain, or the  mountain of hay that brushes them in passing, and whistling cheerily,  blow high or low, with never a fear of falling! The mother bird must  feel very comfortable about it as she goes off caterpillar hunting,  for no bird enemy can trouble the little ones while she is gone. The  black snake, that horror of all low-nesting birds, will never climb so  high. The red squirrel--little wretch that he is, to eat young birds  when he has still a bushel of corn and nuts in his old wall--cannot  find a footing on those delicate branches. Neither can the crow find a  resting place from which to steal the young; and the hawk's legs are  not long enough to reach down and grasp them, should he perchance  venture near the house and hover an instant over the nest.    Besides all this, the oriole is a neighborly little body; and that  helps her. Though the young are kept from harm anywhere by the cunning  instinct which builds a hanging nest, she still prefers to build near  the house, where hawks and crows and owls rarely come. She knows her  friends and takes advantage of their protection, returning year after  year to the same old elm, and, like a thrifty little housewife,  carefully saving and sorting the good threads of her storm-wrecked old  house to be used in building the new.    Of late years, however, it has seemed to me that the pretty nests on  the secluded streets of New England towns are growing scarcer. The  orioles are peace-loving birds, and dislike the society of those  noisy, pugnacious little rascals, the English sparrows, which have of  late taken possession of our streets. Often now I find the nests far  away from any house, on lonely roads where a few years ago they were  rarely seen. Sometimes also a solitary farmhouse, too far from the  town to be much visited by sparrows, has two or three nests swinging  about it in its old elms, where formerly there was but one.    It is an interesting evidence of the bird's keen instinct that where  nests are built on lonely roads and away from houses they are  noticeably deeper, and so better protected from bird enemies. The same  thing is sometimes noticed of nests built in maple or apple trees,  which are without the protection of drooping branches, upon which  birds of prey can find no footing. Some wise birds secure the same  protection by simply contracting the neck of the nest, instead of  building a deep one. Young birds building their first nests seem  afraid to trust in the strength of their own weaving. Their nests are  invariably shallow, and so suffer most from birds of prey.    In the choice of building material the birds are very careful. They  know well that no branch supports the nest from beneath; that the  safety of the young orioles depends on good, strong material well  woven together. In some wise way they seem to know at a glance whether  a thread is strong enough to be trusted; but sometimes, in selecting  the first threads that are to bear the whole weight of the nest, they  are unwilling to trust to appearances. At such times a pair of birds  may be seen holding a little tug-of-war, with feet braced, shaking and  pulling the thread like a pair of terriers, till it is well tested.    It is in gathering and testing the materials for a nest that the  orioles display no little ingenuity. One day, a few years ago, I was  lying under some shrubs, watching a pair of the birds that were  building close to the house. It was a typical nest-making day, the  sun pouring his bright rays through delicate green leaves and a glory  of white apple blossoms, the air filled with warmth and fragrance,  birds and bees busy everywhere. Orioles seem always happy; to-day they  quite overflowed in the midst of all the brightness, though materials  were scarce and they must needs be diligent.    The female was very industrious, never returning to the nest without  some contribution, while the male frolicked about the trees in his  brilliant orange and black, whistling his warm rich notes, and seeming  like a dash of southern sunshine amidst the blossoms. Sometimes he  stopped in his frolic to find a bit of string, over which he raised an  impromptu _jubilate_, or to fly with his mate to the nest, uttering  that soft rich twitter of his in a mixture of blarney and  congratulation whenever she found some particularly choice material.  But his chief part seemed to be to furnish the celebration, while she  took care of the nest-making.    Out in front of me, under the lee of the old wall whither some  line-stripping gale had blown it, was a torn fragment of cloth with  loose threads showing everywhere. I was wondering why the birds did  not utilize it, when the male, in one of his lively flights,  discovered it and flew down. First he hopped all around it; next he  tried some threads; but, as the cloth was lying loose on the grass,  the whole piece came whenever he pulled. For a few moments he worked  diligently, trying a pull on each side in succession. Once he tumbled  end over end in a comical scramble, as the fragment caught on a grass  stub but gave way when he had braced himself and was pulling hardest.  Quite abruptly he flew off, and I thought he had given up the attempt.    In a minute he was back with his mate, thinking, no doubt, that she,  as a capable little manager, would know all about such things. If  birds do not talk, they have at least some very ingenious ways of  letting one another know what they think, which amounts to the same  thing.    The two worked together for some minutes, getting an occasional  thread, but not enough to pay for the labor. The trouble was that both  pulled together on the same side; and so they merely dragged the bit  of cloth all over the lawn, instead of pulling out the threads they  wanted. Once they unraveled a long thread by pulling at right angles,  but the next moment they were together on the same side again. The  male seemed to do, not as he was told, but exactly what he saw his  mate do. Whenever she pulled at a thread, he hopped around, as close  to her as he could get, and pulled too.    [Illustration:]    Twice they had given up the attempt, only to return after hunting  diligently elsewhere. Good material was scarce that season. I was  wondering how long their patience would last, when the female suddenly  seized the cloth by a corner and flew along close to the ground,  dragging it after her, chirping loudly the while. She disappeared into  a crab-apple tree in a corner of the garden, whither the male followed  her a moment later.    Curious as to what they were doing, yet fearing to disturb them, I  waited where I"]]]
