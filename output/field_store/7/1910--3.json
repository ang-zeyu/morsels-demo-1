Consequently we first attain an  intelligible end by an act of the intellect; just as we first attain  a sensible end by an act of sense.    Reply Obj. 5: He who has whatever he desires, is happy, because he  has what he desires: and this indeed is by something other than the  act of his will. But to desire nothing amiss is needed for happiness,  as a necessary disposition thereto. And a good will is reckoned among  the good things which make a man happy, forasmuch as it is an  inclination of the will: just as a movement is reduced to the genus  of its terminus, for instance, \"alteration\" to the genus \"quality.\"  ________________________    FIFTH ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 3, Art. 5]    Whether Happiness Is an Operation of the Speculative, or of the  Practical Intellect?    Objection 1: It would seem that happiness is an operation of the  practical intellect. For the end of every creature consists in  becoming like God. But man is like God, by his practical intellect,  which is the cause of things understood, rather than by his  speculative intellect, which derives its knowledge from things.  Therefore man's happiness consists in an operation of the practical  intellect rather than of the speculative.    Obj. 2: Further, happiness is man's perfect good. But the practical  intellect is ordained to the good rather than the speculative  intellect, which is ordained to the true. Hence we are said to be  good, in reference to the perfection of the practical intellect, but  not in reference to the perfection of the speculative intellect,  according to which we are said to be knowing or understanding.  Therefore man's happiness consists in an act of the practical  intellect rather than of the speculative.    Obj. 3: Further, happiness is a good of man himself. But the  speculative intellect is more concerned with things outside man;  whereas the practical intellect is concerned with things belonging to  man himself, viz. his operations and passions. Therefore man's  happiness consists in an operation of the practical intellect rather  than of the speculative.    _On the contrary,_ Augustine says (De Trin. i, 8) that \"contemplation  is promised us, as being the goal of all our actions, and the  everlasting perfection of our joys.\"    _I answer that,_ Happiness consists in an operation of the  speculative rather than of the practical intellect. This is evident  for three reasons. First because if man's happiness is an operation,  it must needs be man's highest operation. Now man's highest operation  is that of his highest power in respect of its highest object: and  his highest power is the intellect, whose highest object is the  Divine Good, which is the object, not of the practical but of the  speculative intellect. Consequently happiness consists principally in  such an operation, viz. in the contemplation of Divine things. And  since that \"seems to be each man's self, which is best in him,\"  according to _Ethic._ ix, 8, and x, 7, therefore such an operation is  most proper to man and most delightful to him.    Secondly, it is evident from the fact that contemplation is sought  principally for its own sake. But the act of the practical intellect  is not sought for its own sake but for the sake of action: and these  very actions are ordained to some end. Consequently it is evident that  the last end cannot consist in the active life, which pertains to the  practical intellect.    Thirdly, it is again evident, from the fact that in the contemplative  life man has something in common with things above him, viz. with God  and the angels, to whom he is made like by happiness. But in things  pertaining to the active life, other animals also have something in  common with man, although imperfectly.    Therefore the last and perfect happiness, which we await in the life  to come, consists entirely in contemplation. But imperfect happiness,  such as can be had here, consists first and principally, in an  operation of the practical intellect directing human actions and  passions, as stated in _Ethic._ x, 7, 8.    Reply Obj. 1: The asserted likeness of the practical intellect to God  is one of proportion; that is to say, by reason of its standing in  relation to what it knows, as God does to what He knows. But the  likeness of the speculative intellect to God is one of union and  \"information\"; which is a much greater likeness. And yet it may be  answered that, in regard to the principal thing known, which is His  Essence, God has not practical but merely speculative knowledge.    Reply Obj. 2: The practical intellect is ordained to good which is  outside of it: but the speculative intellect has good within it, viz.  the contemplation of truth. And if this good be perfect, the whole  man is perfected and made good thereby: such a good the practical  intellect has not; but it directs man thereto.    Reply Obj. 3: This argument would hold, if man himself were his own  last end; for then the consideration and direction of his actions and  passions would be his happiness. But since man's last end is  something outside of him, to wit, God, to Whom we reach out by an  operation of the speculative intellect; therefore, man's happiness  consists in an operation of the speculative intellect rather than of  the practical intellect.  ________________________    SIXTH ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 3, Art. 6]    Whether Happiness Consists in the Consideration of Speculative Sciences?    Objection 1: It would seem that man's happiness consists in the  consideration of speculative sciences. For the Philosopher says  (Ethic. i, 13) that \"happiness is an operation according to perfect  virtue.\" And in distinguishing the virtues, he gives no more than  three speculative virtues--\"knowledge,\" \"wisdom\" and \"understanding,\"  which all belong to the consideration of speculative sciences.  Therefore man's final happiness consists in the consideration of  speculative sciences.    Obj. 2: Further, that which all desire for its own sake, seems to be  man's final happiness. Now such is the consideration of speculative  sciences; because, as stated in _Metaph._ i, 1, \"all men naturally  desire to know\"; and, a little farther on (2), it is stated that  speculative sciences are sought for their own sakes. Therefore  happiness consists in the consideration of speculative sciences.    Obj. 3: Further, happiness is man's final perfection. Now everything  is perfected, according as it is reduced from potentiality to act.  But the human intellect is reduced to act by the consideration of  speculative sciences. Therefore it seems that in the consideration of  these sciences, man's final happiness consists.    _On the contrary,_ It is written (Jer. 9:23): \"Let not the wise man  glory in his wisdom\": and this is said in reference to speculative  sciences. Therefore man's final happiness does not consist in the  consideration of these.    _I answer that,_ As stated above (A. 2, ad 4), man's happiness is  twofold, one perfect, the other imperfect. And by perfect happiness  we are to understand that which attains to the true notion of  happiness; and by imperfect happiness that which does not attain  thereto, but partakes of some particular likeness of happiness. Thus  perfect prudence is in man, with whom is the idea of things to be  done; while imperfect prudence is in certain irrational animals, who  are possessed of certain particular instincts in respect of works  similar to works of prudence.    Accordingly perfect happiness cannot consist essentially in the  consideration of speculative sciences. To prove this, we must observe  that the consideration of a speculative science does not extend  beyond the scope of the principles of that science: since the entire  science is virtually contained in its principles. Now the first  principles of speculative sciences are received through the senses,  as the Philosopher clearly states at the beginning of the  _Metaphysics_ (i, 1), and at the end of the _Posterior Analytics_  (ii, 15). Wherefore the entire consideration of speculative sciences  cannot extend farther than knowledge of sensibles can lead. Now man's  final happiness, which is his final perfection cannot consist in the  knowledge of sensibles. For a thing is not perfected by something  lower, except in so far as the lower partakes of something higher.  Now it is evident that the form of a stone or of any sensible, is  lower than man. Consequently the intellect is not perfected by the  form of a stone, as such, but inasmuch as it partakes of a certain  likeness to that which is above the human intellect, viz. the  intelligible light, or something of the kind. Now whatever is by  something else is reduced to that which is of itself. Therefore man's  final perfection must needs be through knowledge of something above  the human intellect. But it has been shown (I, Q. 88, A. 2), that man  cannot acquire through sensibles, the knowledge of separate  substances, which are above the human intellect. Consequently it  follows that man's happiness cannot consist in the consideration of  speculative sciences. However, just as in sensible forms there is a  participation of the higher substances, so the consideration of  speculative sciences is a certain participation of true and perfect  happiness.    Reply Obj. 1: In his book on Ethics the Philosopher treats of  imperfect happiness, such as can be had in this life, as stated above  (A. 2, ad 4).    Reply Obj. 2: Not only is perfect happiness naturally desired, but  also any likeness or participation thereof.    Reply Obj. 3: Our intellect is reduced to act, in a fashion, by the  consideration of speculative sciences, but not to its final and  perfect act.  ________________________    SEVENTH ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 3, Art. 7]    Whether Happiness Consists in the Knowledge of Separate Substances,  Namely, Angels?    Objection 1:"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17910"],[0,"The Mafulu: Mountain People of British New Guinea (#10)"],[1,"just  at the tips, and sometimes with a little straw work rather further  down; occasionally it is missing altogether. The comb figured is not  so converging at the blunt ends or so spreading at the sharp ends  as is usual, and its blunt ends are not bound together. These combs  are only worn by men; they are commonly worn in front, projecting  forwards over the forehead, as is done in Mekeo; but they are also  worn at the back of the head, projecting sideways to either right or  left. A feather (generally a white cockatoo feather), or sometimes two  feathers, are often inserted into the straw-like work of the comb,  so as to stand up vertically when the comb is worn, and there wave,  or rather wag, backwards and forwards in the wind. I could not learn  any significance in these feathers, such as applies to many of the  upright head feathers worn by the young men of Mekeo. The comb is  worn by several of the men figured in Plate 9, one of them wearing  it in front and the others having it standing out sideways at the back.    The almost universal type of earring (Plate 20, Fig. 1), varying  from 2 to 3 inches in circumference, is made out of the tail of the  cuscus. The ring is made by removing the hair from the animal's tail,  drying the tail, and fastening the pointed end into or on to the blunt  cut-off stump end, tying them firmly together. The ring is then bound  closely round with the yellow and brown material (Dendrobium) of belt  No. 6; but a space of 1 or 2 inches is generally left uncovered at the  part where the two ends of the tail are fastened together. The simplest  form is a single earring, which passes through the hole in the ear;  but I have seen two rings hanging to the ear; and frequently a second  ring is hung on to the first, and often a third to the second, and  sometimes a fourth to the third; or perhaps, instead of the fourth  ring, there may be two rings hanging to the second one. In fact,  there are varieties of ways in which the fancy of the wearer and the  number of rings he possesses will cause him to wear them. They are  worn by both men and women. [46] They may be seen in several plates,  but unfortunately are not very clear. The most distinct are, I think,  those worn by the second woman from the left in Plate 26 and the  woman on the left in Plate 28. The second woman from the left in the  frontispiece has two of them hanging from her right ear.    Pigs' tails, similar to those worn from the hair, are also worn by  both men and women, especially the latter, suspended from the ears;  and here again they vary much in length, and are often decorated with  tassel-like hanging ornaments of shells, beads, etc.    Forehead ornaments (Plate 30, Fig 5) are made by men and worn by them  at dances. This ornament is a band, very slightly curved, which is  worn across the forehead, just under and surrounding the basis of the  dancing feathers. It is generally about 16 inches long and between  4 and 5 inches broad in the middle, from which it narrows somewhat  towards the ends. Its manufacture consists of a ground basis of the  material of belt No. 5, into which are interplaited in geometric  patterns the two black and yellow and brown materials which are used  for belt No. 6. It is fixed on to the forehead by means of strings  attached to its two ends, and passing round, and tied at the back of,  the head.    Nose ornaments. These are straight pencil-shaped pieces of shell,  generally about 6 inches long, which are passed through the hole in  the septum of the nose. They are only worn at dances and on special  occasions; but the people from time to time insert bits of wood or  cane or bone or some other thing into the hole for the purpose of  keeping it open. There are temporary pegs in the noses of the fifth  man to the left in Plate 9 and the man in Plate 10. The nose ornament  is worn by the woman to the extreme right in the frontispiece.    Necklaces and straight pendants, suspended from the neck and  hanging over the chest, are common, though they are not usually  worn in anything approaching the profusion seen in Mekeo and on  the coast. These are made chiefly of shells of various sorts (cut  or whole), dogs' teeth and beads, as in Mekeo. The shells include  the cowries and the small closely packed overlapping cut shells so  generally used in Mekeo for necklaces, and the flat disc-like shell  sections, which are here, as in Mekeo, specially used for straight  hanging pendants; also those lovely large crescent-shaped discs of  pearl shell, which are well known to New Guinea travellers. The shells  are, of course, all obtained directly or indirectly from the coast;  in fact, these are some of the chief articles for which the mountain  people exchange their stone implements and special mountain feathers,  so the similarity in the ornaments is to be expected; but it is only  within a quite recent time that the pearl crescents have found their  way to Mafulu. I do not propose to describe at length the various  forms of shell ornament, as they are very similar to, and indeed I  think practically the same as, those of Mekeo. Some of the necklaces  are figured in Plates 31, 32 and 33, and they are worn by many of  the people figured in other plates, especially the frontispiece and  Plate 17. Straight pendant ornaments are seen in the frontispiece and  in Plates 6, 17, 26 and others. The crescent-shaped pearl ornaments  are seen in the frontispiece and in Plates 6, 7, 16, 28 and others,  a very large one being worn by the little girl in Plate 71.    There is, however, one shell necklace which is peculiar to the  mountains, and, I think, to Mafulu (I do not know whether the Kuni  people also wear it), where it is worn as an emblem of mourning  by persons who are relatives of the deceased, but who are not  sufficiently closely related to him to stain themselves with black  during the period of mourning. This necklace is made of white cowrie  shells varying in size from half an inch to an inch long, each of  which has its convex side ground away, so as to show on one side the  untouched mouth of the shell and on the other an open cavity. The  shells are strung, sometimes closely and sometimes loosely, on to a  double band of thin cord. Specimens of this type of necklace measured  by me varied in length from 36 inches (with 97 shells) to 20 inches  (with 38 shells). It is worn until the period of mourning is formally  terminated. The middle necklace in Plate 33 is a mourning shell  necklace, and it is seen on the neck of the woman to the right in  Plate 29.    Pigs' tail ornaments similar to those already described are also worn  suspended by neck-bands over the chest.    Armlets and wrist-bands are worn by both men and women, and more or  less by children, including quite young ones, at the higher end of  the upper arm and just above the wrist. They are made by men only,  and vary in width from half an inch to 5 or 6 inches, the wider ones  being generally worn on the upper arm. There are several common forms  of these: (1) The more usual form (Plate 34, Fig. 4) is made of the  thin and finely plaited stone-grey material described in abdominal  belt No. 5, and is made in the same way, subject to the difference  that the plaiting is more closely done. Measured specimens of this  armlet varied in width from 1 to 2 1/4 inches, and displayed different  varieties of diagonal twill stitch. (2) Another common form (Plate 34,  Fig. 3) is made of the coarser-plaited black and yellow and brown  materials described concerning No. 6 belt, and is made in the same  way. Specimens of this armlet varied in width from 1 to 5 inches. (3)  There is another form which in fineness of material and plait is  between Nos. 1 and 2. I was told that this is made out of another  creeping plant, and is left in its own natural unstained colour, which,  however, in this case is a dull brown red. (4) Another form (Plate  34, Fig. 2) is made of the coarse dull red-brown and stone-yellow  materials described with reference to belt No. 2, and is made in  the same way. A specimen of this armlet was 2 1/4 inches wide. (5)  Another form (Plate 34, Fig. 1) is in make something like No. 4, but  the two materials used are the stone-yellow material of belt No. 2  and the black material of belt No. 6, and the plaiting materials are  much finer in thickness than are those of armlet No. 4. Specimens  of this armlet varied in width from 3/4 to 1 1/4 inches. (6) The  beautiful large cut single-shell wrist ornament, commonly worn on  the coast and plains, whence the Mafulu people procure it. Armlets  will be seen worn by many of the people figured in the plates.    There is no practice of putting armlets on young folk, and retaining  them in after life, so as to tighten round and contract the arm.    Leg-bands (Plate 25, Fig. 1) and anklets are worn by both men and  women, and also by children, just below the knee and above the ankle.    There is a form of plaited leg-band somewhat similar in make to armlet  No. 5, and between half-an-inch and an inch in width, though the  colour of this leg-band is a dull brown. But the usual form of leg-band  and anklet is made by women only out of thread fibre by a process of  manufacture quite distinct from the stiff plait work adopted for some  of the belts and for the armlets. They make their thread out of fine  vegetable fibre as they proceed with the manufacture of the band,  rolling the individual fibres with their hands upon their thighs,  and then rolling these fibres into two-strand threads, and from time  to time in this way making more thread, which is worked into the open  ends of the then working thread as it is required--all this being  done in the usual native method.    I had an opportunity of watching a woman making a leg-band, and I think  the process is worth describing. She first made a thread 5 or 6 feet  long by the method above referred to, the thread being a two-strand  one,"]]]
