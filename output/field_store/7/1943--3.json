Noah and his Ark came over sea from this to the present earth.    To the north of our world is a great hill, like the later Moslem and  older Hindu \"Cupola of the Earth,\" which perhaps was Cosmas' own  original. Round this the sun and moon revolve, making day and night as  they appear or disappear behind it.    The sky consists of four walls meeting in the \"dome of heaven\" over the  floor on which we live, and this sky is \"glued\" to the edges of the  outer world, the world of the Patriarchs.    But this heaven is also cut in two by the firmament, lying between our  atmosphere and that \"New Heaven and New Earth wherein dwelleth  Righteousness\"; and the floor of this upper world is covered by the  \"waters that be above the firmament\"; above this is Paradise, and below  the firmament live the angels, as \"ministers\" and \"flaming fires\" and  \"servants of God to men.\"    The proofs of this are simple, mainly resting on some five texts from  the Old Testament and two passages of St. Paul.    First the Book of Genesis declared itself to be the \"Book of the  Generation of the Heaven and the Earth\"--that is, of everything in the  heavens, and the earth. But the \"old wives' fable of the Antipodes\"  would make the heaven surround and contain the earth, and God's word  would have to be changed \"These are the generations of the sky.\" For the  same truth--the twofold and independent being of heaven and  earth--Cosmas quotes the additional testimony of Abraham, David, Hosea,  Isaiah, Zachariah, and Melchisedek, who clenched the case against the  Antipodes. \"For how indeed could even rain be said to 'fall' or to  'descend,' as in the Psalms and the Gospels, in those regions where it  could only be said to 'come up'?\"    Again, the world cannot be a globe, or sphere, or be suspended in  mid-air, or in any sort of motion, for what say the Scriptures? \"Earth  is fixed on its foundations\"; \"Thou hast laid the foundations of the  earth and it abideth\"; \"Thou hast made the round world so sure, that it  cannot be moved\"; \"Thou hast made all men to dwell upon the face of the  whole earth\"--not \"upon every face,\" or upon any more than one  face--\"upon _the_ face,\" not the back or the side, but the broad flat  face we know. \"Who then with these passages before him, ought even to  speak of Antipodes?\"    So much against false doctrine; to establish the truth is simpler still.  For the same St. Paul, who disposes of science falsely so called, does  not he speak, like David, like St. Peter and St. John, of our world as a  tabernacle? \"If our earthly house of this tabernacle be dissolved,\" \"We  that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened,\" which points to  the natural conclusion of enlightened faith, that Moses' tabernacle was  an exact copy of the universe. \"See thou make all things according to  the pattern shewn thee in the Mount.\" So the four walls, the covered  roof, the floor, the proportions of the Tent of the Wilderness, shewed  us in small compass all that was in nature.    If any further guidance were needed, it was ready to hand in the Prophet  Isaiah and the Patriarch Job. \"That stretcheth out the heavens as a  curtain and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in\"; \"Also can any  understand the spreadings of the clouds or the noise of his tabernacle?\"    The whole reasoning is like the theological arguments on the effects of  man's fall upon the stars and the vegetable world, or the atmospheric  changes due to angels.    But though Cosmas states his system with the claims of an article of  faith, there were not wanting men, and even saints, who stood out on the  side of reason in geography in the most traditional of times. Isidore of  Seville, and Vergil, the Irish missionary of the eighth century, both  maintained the old belief of Basil and Ambrose, that the question of the  Antipodes was not closed by the Church, and that error in this point was  venial and not mortal. For the positive tabernacle-system of \"the man  who sailed to India\" there was never much support; his work was soon  forgotten, though it has been called by some paradox-makers \"the great  authority of the Middle Ages\"--in the face of the known facts, that this  was the real position of Ptolemy and Strabo, that no one can speak of  the \"Middle Ages\" in this unqualified way any more than of the Modern or  Ancient worlds; and that Cosmas is almost unnoticed in the great age of  mediaeval science, from the twelfth century.    And whatever we may think of Cosmas and his _Christian System of the  Whole World, Evolved out of Holy Scripture_, he is of interest to us as  the last of the old Christian geographers, closing one age which,  however senile, had once been in the truest sense civilised, and  preparing us to enter one that in comparison is literally dark. From the  age of Justinian, and from the rise of Islam in the early years of the  seventh century, the geographical knowledge of Christendom is on a par  with its practical contraction and apparent decline. There are  travellers; but for the next five hundred years there are no more  theorists, cosmographers, or map-makers of the Universe or Habitable  Globe.    From the time that Islam, after a century of world-conquest, began to  form itself into an organised state, or federation of states, in the  later eighth and earlier ninth centuries A.D.,--thus making itself until  the thirteenth century the principal heir of the older Eastern  culture,--Christendom was content to take its geography, its ideas of  the world in general, from the Arabs, who in their turn depended upon  the pre-Christian Greeks.    The relation of Ptolemy and Strabo to modern knowledge is best seen  through the work of the Arabic geographers, but the Saracens did much to  destroy before they began to build up once more. As the northern  barbarians of the fifth century interrupted the hope of a Christian  revival of Pagan literature and science, so the Moslems of the seventh  and eighth cut short the Catholic and Roman revival of Justinian and  Heraclius, in which the new faith and the old state had found a working  agreement.    Between Cosmas and the Viking-Age, \"Christian,\" \"Roman,\" \"Western\"  exploration falls within very narrow limits: the few pilgrims whose  recollections represent to us the whole literature of travel in the  seventh, eighth, and ninth centuries, add nothing fresh even of  practical discovery; theory and theoretical work has ceased altogether,  and the first stirrings of the new life in the commerce and voyages of  Amalphi, and in the sudden and splendid outburst of Norse life in its  age of piracy, are not yet, are not really before the world until the  time of Alfred of England, of Charles the Bald, of Pope Nicholas I. \"the  Great.\" Yet such as it is, this pilgrim stage of European development  stands for something. Religion, as it is the first agent in forming our  modern nations, is the first impulse towards their expansion. And to us  there is a special interest.    For the best known of western travellers in this darkest of the  Christian ages (600-870 A.D.), Arculf and Willibald, are both connected  with England and the beginnings of English science in the age of Bede.    Arculf, a Frank or Gallican Bishop, who about 690 visited, first of  \"Latin\" writers since the Mohammedan conquest, Jerusalem, the Jordan  valley, Nazareth, and the other holy places of Syria, was driven by  storms on his return to the great Irish monastery of Iona. There he  described his wonders to the Abbot Adamnan, who then sat in the seat of  the Irish Apostles Patrick and Columba, and by Adamnan this narrative  was presented and dedicated to Aldfrith the Wise, last of the great  Northumbrian Kings, in his Court at York (_c._ A.D. 701). Not only does  the original remain to us, but we have also two summaries of it, one  longer, another shorter, made by Baeda, the Venerable Bede, as a useful  manual for Englishmen, _Concerning the Holy Sites_. We are again  reminded by this how constantly fresh life is growing up under an  appearance of death. The conversion of England, which Gregory the Great,  Theodore, and the Irish monks had carried through in the seventh, that  darkest of Christian centuries, was now bearing its fruit in the work  of Bede, who was really the sign of a far more permanent intellectual  movement than his own, and in that of Boniface, Wilbrord, and Willibald,  who began to win for Christendom in Germany more than a counterpoise for  her losses in the South and East, from Armenia to Spain.    Arculf is full of the mystical unscientific spirit of the time. He notes  in Jerusalem \"a lofty column, which at mid-day casts no shadow, thus  proving itself to be the centre of the earth for as David says, 'God is  my king of old, working salvation _in the midst of the_ earth.'\"    \"At the roots of Lebanon\" he comes to the place \"where the Jordan has  its rise from two fountains Jor and Dan, whose waters unite in the  single river Jordan.\" In the Dead Sea a lighted lamp would float safely,  and no man could sink if he tried; the bitumen of this place was almost  indissoluble; the only fruit here about were the apples of Sodom, which  crumbled to dust in the mouth.    The three churches on the top of Tabor were \"according to the three  tabernacles described by Peter.\"    From Damascus Arculf made for the port of Tyre, and so came by Jaffa to  Egypt. Alexandria he found so great that he was one entire day in merely  passing through. Its port he thought \"difficult of access and something  like the human body in shape, with a narrow mouth and neck, then  stretching out far and wide.\"    The great Pharos tower was still lit up every night with torches. Here  was the \"Emporium of the whole world\"; \"countless merchants from all  parts\": the \"country rainless and very fertile.\"    The Nile was navigable to the Town of Elephants; beyond this, at the  Cataracts, the river \"runs in a wild ruin"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18767"],[0,"Stories about Animals: with Pictures to Match (#10)"],[1," in the town!' My  gun chanced not to be put together; and while my servant was adjusting  it, the collector and two medical men, who had recently arrived, in  consequence of the cholera morbus having just then reached Ceylon from  the continent, came to my door, the former armed with a fowling-piece,  and the two latter with remarkably blunt hog spears. They insisted upon  setting off without waiting for my gun, a proceeding not much to my  taste. The leopard had taken refuge in a hut, the roof of which, like  those of Ceylon huts in general, spread to the ground like an umbrella;  the only aperture into it was a small door about four feet high. The  collector wanted to get the leopard out at once. I begged to wait for my  gun; but no, the fowling-piece (loaded with ball, of course) and the two  spears were quite enough. I got a stake, and awaited my fate from very  shame. At this moment, to my great delight, there arrived from the fort  an English officer, two artillerymen, and a Malay captain; and a pretty  figure we should have cut without them, as the event will show. I was  now quite ready to attack, and my gun came a minute afterward. The whole  scene which follows took place within an inclosure, about twenty feet  square, formed on three sides by a strong fence of palmyra leaves, and  on the fourth by the hut. At the door of this the two artillerymen  planted themselves; and the Malay captain got at the top, to frighten  the leopard out by unroofing it--an easy operation, as the huts there  are covered with cocoanut leaves. One of the artillerymen wanted to go  in to the leopard, but we would not suffer it. At last the beast sprang;  this man received him on his bayonet, which he thrust apparently down  his throat, firing his piece at the same moment. The bayonet broke off  short, leaving less than three inches on the musket; the rest remained  in the animal, but was invisible to us: the shot probably went through  his cheek, for it certainly did not seriously injure him, as he  instantly rose upon his legs, with a loud roar, and placed his paws upon  the soldier's breast. At this moment the animal appeared to me to about  reach the centre of the man's face; but I had scarcely time to observe  this, when the leopard, stooping his head, seized the soldier's arm in  his mouth, turned him half round, staggering, threw him over on his  back, and fell upon him. Our dread now was, that if we fired upon the  leopard we might kill the man: for a moment there was a pause, when his  comrade attacked the beast exactly in the same manner as the gallant  fellow himself had done. He struck his bayonet into his head; the  leopard rose at him; he fired; and this time the ball took effect, and  in the head. The animal staggered backward, and we all poured in our  fire. He still kicked and writhed; when the gentlemen with the spears  advanced and fixed him, while some natives finished him by beating him  on the head with hedge-stakes. The brave artilleryman was, after all,  but slightly hurt. He claimed the skin, which was very cheerfully given  to him. There was, however, a cry among the natives that the head should  be cut off: it was; and, in so doing, the knife came directly across the  bayonet. The animal measured scarcely less than four feet from the root  of the tail to the nose.\"    Captain Marryatt had a pretty serious adventure with a huge panther in  Africa, while his vessel lay at anchor in a river there, and he and his  men were busy in taking in a cargo of ivory. As they were thus engaged  one day, by some accident a hole was made in the bottom of the boat, and  they were unable to proceed with it. The captain told the men to remain  by the boat, and started himself to obtain assistance from the vessel.  He thought that if he could force his way through the canes which  abounded in that vicinity, a short distance down the river, he could  make signals to those on board, and that some of them would come to  their help. This expedition, however, proved a much longer one than he  anticipated, and much more perilous. He lost his way. \"At first,\" he  says, \"I got on very well, as there were little paths through the canes,  made, as I imagined, by the natives; and although I was up to my knees  in thick black mud, I continued to get on pretty fast; but at last the  canes grew so thick that I could hardly force my way through them, and  it was a work of exceeding labor. Still I persevered, expecting each  second I should arrive at the banks of the river, and be rewarded for my  fatigue; but the more I labored the worse it appeared for me, and at  last I became worn out and quite bewildered. I then tried to find my way  back, and was equally unsuccessful, when I sat down with any thing but  pleasant thoughts in my mind. I calculated that I had been two hours in  making this attempt, and was now quite puzzled how to proceed. I  bitterly lamented my rashness, now that it was too late. Having reposed  a little, I resumed my toil, and again, after an hour's exertion, was  compelled, from fatigue, to sit down in the deep black mud. Another  respite from toil and another hour more of exertion, and I gave myself  up for lost. The day was evidently fast closing in, the light over head  was not near so bright as it had been, and I knew that a night passed in  the miasma of the cane swamp was death. At last it became darker and  darker. There could not be an hour of daylight remaining. I determined  upon one struggle more, and reeking as I was with perspiration, and  faint with fatigue, I rose again, and was forcing my way through the  thickest of the canes, when I heard a deep growl, and perceived a large  panther not twenty yards from me. He was on the move as well as myself,  attempting to force his way through the thickest of the canes, so as to  come up to me. I retreated from him as fast as I could, but he gained  slowly upon me, and my strength was fast declining. I thought I heard  sounds at a distance, and they became more and more distinct; but what  they were, my fear and my struggles probably prevented from making out.    \"My eyes were fixed upon the fierce animal who was in pursuit of me; and  I now thank God that the canes were so thick and impassable. Still the  animal evidently gained ground, until it was not more than twenty yards  from me, dashing and springing at the canes, and tearing them aside with  his teeth. The sounds were now nearer, and I made them out to be the  hallooing of some other animals. A moment's pause, and I thought it was  the barking of dogs, and I thought I must have arrived close to where  the schooner lay, and that I heard the barking of bloodhounds. At last I  could do no more, and dropped exhausted and almost senseless in the mud.  I recollect hearing the crashing of canes, and then the savage roar, and  the yells, and growls, and struggle, and fierce contention, but had  fainted.    \"I must now inform the reader that about an hour after I had left the  boat, the captain of an American vessel was pulling up the river, and  was hailed by our men in our long boat. Perceiving them on that side of  the river, and that they were in distress, he pulled toward them, and  they told him what had happened, and that an hour previous I had left  the boat to force my way through the cane brakes, and they had heard  nothing of me since. 'Madness!' cried he, 'he is a lost man. Stay till I  come back from the schooner.' He went back to the schooner, and taking  two of his crew, who were negroes, and his two bloodhounds, into the  boat, he returned immediately; and as soon as he landed, he put the  bloodhounds on my track, and sent the negroes on with them. They had  followed me in all my windings--for it appeared that I had traveled in  all directions--and had come up with me just as I had sunk with  exhaustion, and the panther was so close upon me. The bloodhounds had  attacked the panther, and this was the noise which sounded on my ears as  I lay stupefied at the mercy of the wild beast. The panther was not  easily, although eventually overcome, and the black men coming up, had  found me and borne me in a state of insensibility on board my vessel.  The fever had set upon me, and it was not till three weeks afterward  that I recovered my senses, when I learned what I have told to the  reader.\"          [Illustration: THE ELEPHANT.]    The Elephant.      Several hunters once surprised a male and female elephant in an open  spot, near a thick swamp. The animals fled toward the thicket, and the  male was soon beyond the reach of the balls from the hunters' guns. The  female, however, was wounded so severely, that she was not able to make  her escape; and the hunters were about to capture her, when the male  elephant rushed from his retreat, and with a shrill and frightful  scream, like the sound of a trumpet, attacked the party. All escaped but  one, the man who had last discharged his gun, and who was standing with  his horse's bridle over his arm, reloading his gun, at the moment the  furious animal burst from the wood. This unfortunate man the elephant  immediately singled out, and before he could spring into his saddle, he  was prepared to revenge the insult that had been offered to his  companion. One blow from his trunk struck the poor man to the earth; and  without troubling himself about the horse, who galloped off at full  speed, the elephant thrust his tusks into the hunter's body, and flung  him high into the air. The unfortunate man was instantly killed. After  this act, the elephant walked gently up to his bleeding companion, and  regardless of the volleys with which he was assailed from the hunters,  he caressed her, and aided her in reaching a shelter in the thicket.    A tame elephant had a great affection for a dog; and those who visited  the place where the animal was exhibited, used to pull the dog's ears,  to make him yelp, on purpose to see what the elephant would do.
