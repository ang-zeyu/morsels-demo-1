Every one of those teachers are common, low-bred and impertinent. As for  your Miss Thompson, she is a self-satisfied prig.\"    \"You must not say such things of Miss Thompson, Eleanor,\" said Grace  firmly. \"She doesn't deserve them. She is one of the finest women I have  ever known, and she takes a warm interest in every girl in school. What  has she done that you should speak of her as you do?\"    \"She called me into her office this morning and made a whole lot of  fuss because I didn't have a written excuse for yesterday's absence,\"  said Eleanor angrily. \"When I told her that I stayed at home because  I felt inclined to do so, she almost had a spasm, and gave me another  lecture then and there, ending up by saying that it must not occur  again. I should like to know how she knew I was absent yesterday.\"    \"Miss Thompson always knows when a girl is absent,\" replied Grace.  \"The special teachers report to her every day. It is the rule of this  school for a girl to present her excuse at the office as soon as she  returns; then her name is taken off the absent list. If she is absent  the second day, then a messenger is sent to her home to find out the  cause. I suppose that when Miss Thompson looked over the list, she  remembered seeing you at opening exercises, so of course sent for  you.\"    \"She is a crabbed old maid,\" said Eleanor contemptuously, \"and I despise  her. I'll find some way to get even with her, and all the rest of those  teachers, too.\"    \"You will never get along in school, Eleanor,\" answered Grace gently,  \"if you take that stand. The only way to be happy is to----\"    \"Please don't preach to me,\" said Eleanor haughtily. \"It is of no use.  I am not a child and I understand my own business thoroughly. When I saw  you girls the first day of school, I thought that you were full of life  and spirit, but really you are all goody-goodies, who allow those  teachers to lead you around by the nose. I had intended to ask Aunt  Margaret to take me out of this ridiculous school, for some of the  people in it make me tired, but I have changed my mind. I shall stay for  pure spite and show that stiff-necked principal of yours that I am a law  unto myself, and won't stand her interference.\"    \"Stop a moment, Eleanor. I am going no farther with you,\" said Grace,  flushing, \"but I should just like to say before I leave you that you are  taking the wrong view of things, and you'll find it out sooner or later.  I am sorry that you have such a poor opinion of myself and my friends,  for we cherish nothing but the friendliest feelings toward you.\"    With this, Grace walked away, feeling more hurt over Eleanor's rudeness  than she cared to show.    As she turned out of High School Street she heard a familiar call, and,  glancing up the street, saw her three chums waiting for her on the  corner.    \"We saw you just as you tackled Eleanor,\" said Nora, \"so we kept away,  for we thought after to-day's performances she wouldn't be in a very  good humor.\"    \"What was the matter with her to-day?\" asked Jessica curiously. \"She  behaved like a bad child in English this morning, followed it up in  geometry; and Anne says that in rhetoric class Miss Chester lost all  patience with her and gave her a severe lecturing.\"    \"I might as well tell you at once that Eleanor's opinion of us is far  from flattering,\" said Grace, half laughing, although there was a hurt  look on her face. \"She says we are all goody-goodies and that we make  her tired. She also requested me to mind my own business.\"    \"She said that to you? Just wait until the next time I see her,\"  blustered Nora, \"I'll tell her what I think of her.\"    \"On the contrary, we must treat her better, if anything, than before,\"  said Anne quietly. \"Don't you remember we promised Mrs. Gray that we  would try to help her?\"    \"Yes, I remember all that; but I can't bear to have any one say horrid  things to Grace,\" grumbled Nora.    \"What a queer girl she is,\" said Jessica. \"Yesterday she treated us as  though we were her dearest friends, while to-day she scorns us utterly.  It's a case of 'blow hot, blow cold.'\"    \"That is because she has the artistic temperament,\" replied Anne,  smiling.    \"You may say what you like about the artistic temperament,\" said Nora,  \"but in my opinion it's nothing more nor less than just plain temper.\"          CHAPTER VIII    ELEANOR THROWS DOWN THE GAUNTLET      \"The Phi Sigma Tau is to have a special meeting to-night at Jessica's,\"  called Grace Harlowe to Nora O'Malley as the latter entered the  locker-room at the close of school one day about two weeks after the  initiation at Jessica's.    \"Does Jessica know it?\" inquired Nora.    \"Not yet,\" replied Grace, \"but she will as soon as she comes in.  I rushed down here the minute the last bell rang, because I wanted  to be here when the girls come in. You are the first, however.\"    \"Why are we to hold a meeting?\" asked Nora, her curiosity aroused.    \"Wait and see,\" replied Grace, smiling. \"Of what use is it to hold a  meeting, if I tell you all the business beforehand?\"    \"All right,\" said Nora, \"you keep your secrets and I'll keep mine.\"    \"What have you heard that's new?\" asked Grace.    \"Wait and see,\" replied Nora, with a grin of delight. \"I am saving my  news for the meeting.\"    By this time the remaining members of the Phi Sigma Tau, with the  exception of Eleanor Savell, had come into the locker-room, and had been  promptly hailed by Grace. Marian Barber, Miriam Nesbit and Eva Allen  after agreeing to be at Jessica's, at eight o'clock, had gone their  separate ways.    \"Every one excepting Eleanor has been told,\" said Grace. \"I really don't  know how to approach her. She has been so distant of late.\"    \"Don't wait to ask her,\" said Nora decidedly. \"She won't attend the  meeting.\"    \"How do you know?\" asked Jessica.    \"I'll tell you to-night,\" answered Nora mysteriously, \"but I know  positively that she won't come, because she is going to have company at  'Heartsease.' Now I've told you more than I intended to, and I shall not  say another word until to-night.\"    \"Come on then,\" said Grace, \"we won't wait any longer. Jessica, will you  ask your father if he will be at liberty for a few minutes this  evening?\"    \"Certainly,\" replied Jessica.    \"Oh, I know now whom it's all about,\" cried Nora gleefully. \"Mary  Stevens.\"    \"You have guessed it,\" said Grace, \"but, like yourself, I decline to  talk until to-night.\"    Before eight o'clock the seven girls had taken possession of the  Bright's big, comfortable sitting room and were impatiently waiting for  Grace to tell her news.    \"Before I tell you what is on my mind,\" said Grace, \"we ought to have  a president, vice president and secretary for this worthy organization.  I move therefore that we choose Miriam Nesbit for president of this  sorority. Those in favor say 'aye.' We'll dispense with seconding the  motion.\"    There was an instant's pause, then a chorus of \"ayes\" burst forth.    \"Contrary, 'no.'\"    The only \"no\" was from Miriam.    \"We appreciate the fact that you are too polite to vote for yourself,  Miriam,\" said Grace, \"but your 'no' doesn't amount to a row of pins.  You're elected, so come over here and occupy the chair of state. Long  live the president of the Phi Sigma Tau.\"    Miriam, flushed with pleasure, then took the seat that Grace had  vacated. She had not expected this honor and was deeply touched by it.  Her summer with her girl chums at Lake George had made her an entirely  different girl from the Miriam of old. Admiration for Grace and her  friends had taken the place of the old animosity. Although the chums had  not taken her into their inner circle, still they made much of her, and  she came nearer to being one of them than any other girl in the junior  class.    \"I am sure I thank you all,\" began Miriam, \"and now we must have a vice  president and a secretary.\"    Grace and Anne were elected with enthusiasm to the respective offices,  then Miriam requested Grace to tell the other members what was on her  mind.    After addressing the chair, Grace began: \"I know you will all be glad to  hear that Mabel has received a letter from Mary Stevens. It was  addressed to me on the outside envelope and Mabel has given me  permission to open and read it to you. She is willing for us to do  whatever we think best. I won't attempt to read all the letter, only  that part that interests us.    \"Here it is: 'I am so sorry about the way in which you are treated, but  glad to know that you have found friends at last. Miss Brant has no  claim on you whatever. She took you from the orphanage with the  understanding that if you did not suit her she was to be allowed to send  you back. The matron asked her why she did not adopt you, or at least  appoint herself your guardian, and she said that under no circumstances  would she do so; that she wanted a good maid of all work, not a  daughter. I enclose a statement from the matron to this effect. I would  have advised you before this to leave her, but you are too young to  drift about the world alone. I hope that when I next hear from you, you  will be in happier surroundings. I have always believed that your  parents were people of means and that you were lost or stolen when a  baby. Perhaps if they are still living you will find them some day.'\"    \"That is about all we need,\" said Grace, as she folded the letter and  put it back in the envelope. \"The next thing to do is to see Mr.  Bright.\"    \"I'll go for him at once,\" said Jessica, and darted off to the library,  where her father sat reading. He rose, and, tucking his daughter's arm  in his, walked out to the sitting room, where the Phi Sigma"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17851"],[0,"The History of Mary Prince, a West Indian Slave (#10)"],[1,"would       afford me very great pleasure.         \"There are many and powerful reasons for inducing me to       refuse my sanction to her returning here in the way she       seems to wish. It would be to reward the worst species of       ingratitude, and subject myself to insult whenever she came       in my way. Her moral character is very bad, as the police       records will shew; and she would be a very troublesome       character should she come here without any restraint. She is       not a native of this country, and I know of no relation she       has here. I induced her to take a husband, a short time       before she left this, by providing a comfortable house in my       yard for them, and prohibiting her going out after 10 to 12       o'clock (our bed-time) without special leave. This she       considered the greatest, and indeed the only, grievance she       ever complained of, and all my efforts could not prevent it.       In hopes of inducing her to be steady to her husband, who       was a free man, I gave him the house to occupy during our       absence; but it appears the attachment was too loose to bind       her, and he has taken another wife: so on that score I do       her no injury.--In England she made her election, and       quitted my family. This I had no right to object to; and I       should have thought no more of it, but not satisfied to       leave quietly, she gave every trouble and annoyance in her       power, and endeavoured to injure the character of my family       by the most vile and infamous falsehoods, which was embodied       in a petition to the House of Commons, and would have been       presented, had not my friends from this island, particularly       the Hon. Mr. Byam and Dr. Coull, come forward, and disproved       what she had asserted.         \"It would be beyond the limits of an ordinary letter to       detail her baseness, though I will do so should his       Excellency wish it; but you may judge of her depravity by       one circumstance, which came out before Mr. Justice Dyett,       in a quarrel with another female.           *       *       *       *       *         \"Such a thing I could not have believed possible.[19]         [Footnote 19: I omit the circumstance here mentioned, because       it is too indecent to appear in a publication likely to be       perused by females. It is, in all probability, a vile       calumny; but even if it were perfectly true, it would not       serve Mr. Wood's case one straw.--Any reader who wishes it,       may see the passage referred to, in the autograph letter in       my possession. T. P.]         \"Losing her value as a slave in a pecuniary point of view I       consider of no consequence; for it was our intention, had       she conducted herself properly and returned with us, to have       given her freedom. She has taken her freedom; and all I wish       is, that she would enjoy it without meddling with me.         \"Let me again repeat, if his Excellency wishes it, it will       afford me great pleasure to state such particulars of her,       and which will be incontestably proved by numbers here, that       I am sure will acquit me in his opinion of acting unkind or       ungenerous towards her. I'll say nothing of the liability I       should incur, under the Consolidated Slave Law, of dealing       with a free person as a slave.         \"My only excuse for entering so much into detail must be       that of my anxious wish to stand justified in his       Excellency's opinion.         \"I am, my dear Sir,       Yours very truly,       JOHN A. WOOD.       \"_20th Oct. 1830_.\"         \"_Charles Taylor, Esq._       _&c. &c. &c._         \"I forgot to mention that it was at her own special request       that she accompanied me to England--and also that she had a       considerable sum of money with her, which she had saved in       my service. I knew of L36 to L40, at least, for I had some       trouble to recover it from a white man, to whom she had lent       it.         \"J. A. W.\"    Such is Mr. Wood's justification of his conduct in thus obstinately  refusing manumission to the Negro-woman who had escaped from his \"house of  bondage.\"    Let us now endeavour to estimate the validity of the excuses assigned, and  the allegations advanced by him, for the information of Governor Sir  Patrick Ross, in this deliberate statement of his case.    1. To allow the woman to return home free, would, he affirms \"be to reward  the worst species of ingratitude.\"    He assumes, it seems, the sovereign power of pronouncing a virtual  sentence of banishment, for the alleged crime of ingratitude. Is this then  a power which any man ought to possess over his fellow-mortal? or which  any good man would ever wish to exercise? And, besides, there is no  evidence whatever, beyond Mr. Wood's mere assertion, that Mary Prince owed  him or his family the slightest mark of gratitude. Her account of the  treatment she received in his service, _may_ be incorrect; but her simple  statement is at least supported by minute and feasible details, and,  unless rebutted by positive facts, will certainly command credence from  impartial minds more readily than his angry accusation, which has  something absurd and improbable in its very front. Moreover, is it not  absurd to term the assertion of her _natural rights_ by a slave,--even  supposing her to have been kindly dealt with by her \"owners,\" and treated  in every respect the reverse of what Mary affirms to have been her  treatment by Mr. Wood and his wife,--\"the _worst_ species of ingratitude?\"  This may be West Indian ethics, but it will scarcely be received as sound  doctrine in Europe.    2. To permit her return would be \"to subject himself to insult whenever  she came in his way.\"    This is a most extraordinary assertion. Are the laws of Antigua then so  favourable to the free blacks, or the colonial police so feebly  administered, that there are no sufficient restraints to protect a rich  colonist like Mr. Wood,--a man who counts among his familiar friends the  Honourable Mr. Byam, and Mr. Taylor the Government Secretary,--from being  insulted by a poor Negro-woman? It is preposterous.    3. Her moral character is so bad, that she would prove very troublesome  should she come to the colony \"without any restraint.\"    \"Any restraint?\" Are there no restraints (supposing them necessary) short  of absolute slavery to keep \"troublesome characters\" in order? But this, I  suppose, is the _argumentum ad gubernatorem_--to frighten the governor.  She is such a termagant, it seems, that if she once gets back to the  colony _free_, she will not only make it too hot for poor Mr. Wood, but  the police and courts of justice will scarce be a match for her! Sir  Patrick Ross, no doubt, will take care how he intercedes farther for so  formidable a virago! How can one treat such arguments seriously?    4. She is not a native of the colony, and he knows of no relation she has  there.    True: But was it not her home (so far as a slave can have a home) for  thirteen or fourteen years? Were not the connexions, friendships, and  associations of her mature life formed there? Was it not there she hoped  to spend her latter years in domestic tranquillity with her husband, free  from the lash of the taskmaster? These considerations may appear light to  Mr. Wood, but they are every thing to this poor woman.    5. He induced her, he says, to take a husband, a short time before she  left Antigua, and gave them a comfortable house in his yard, &c. &c.    This paragraph merits attention. He \"_induced her to take a husband_?\" If  the fact were true, what brutality of mind and manners does it not  indicate among these slave-holders? They refuse to legalize the marriages  of their slaves, but _induce_ them to form such temporary connexions as  may suit the owner's conveniency, just as they would pair the lower  animals; and this man has the effrontery to tell us so! Mary, however,  tells a very different story, (see page 17;) and her assertion,  independently of other proof, is at least as credible as Mr. Wood's. The  reader will judge for himself as to the preponderance of internal evidence  in the conflicting statements.    6. He alleges that she was, before marriage, licentious, and even depraved  in her conduct, and unfaithful to her husband afterwards.    These are serious charges. But if true, or even partially true, how comes  it that a person so correct in his family hours and arrangements as Mr.  Wood professes to be, and who expresses so edifying a horror of  licentiousness, could reconcile it to his conscience to keep in the bosom  of his family so _depraved_, as well as so _troublesome_ a character for  at least thirteen years, and confide to her for long periods too the  charge of his house and the care of his children--for such I shall shew to  have been the facts? How can he account for not having rid himself with  all speed, of so disreputable an inmate--he who values her loss so little  \"in a pecuniary point of view?\" How can he account for having sold _five  other slaves_ in that period, and yet have retained this shocking  woman--nay, even have refused to sell her, on more than one occasion, when  offered her full value? It could not be from ignorance of her character,  for the circumstance which he adduces as a proof of her shameless  depravity, and which I have omitted on account of its indecency, occurred,  it would appear, not less than _ten years ago_. Yet, notwithstanding her  alleged ill qualities and habits of gross immorality, he has not only  constantly refused to part with her; but after thirteen long years, brings  her to England as an attendant on his wife and children, with the avowed  intention of carrying her back along with his maiden daughter, a young  lady returning from school! Such are the extraordinary facts; and until  Mr. Wood shall reconcile these singular"]]]
