Then dissolve in it  warm, about one part of Honey to six of water: Lave and beat it, till all  the Honey be perfectly dissolved; Then boil it, beginning gently, till all  the scum be risen, and scummed away. It must boil in all about two hours.  Half an hour, before you end your boiling, put into it some Rosemary-tops,  Thyme, Sweet-marjorame, one Sprig of Minth, in all about half a handful,  and as much Sweet-bryar-leaves as all these; in all, about a handful of  herbs, and two Ounces of sliced Ginger, and one Ounce of bruised Cinamon.  He did use to put in a few Cloves and Mace; But the King did not care for  them. Let all these boil about half an hour, then scum them clean away; and  presently let the Liquor run through a strainer-cloth into a Kiver of wood,  to cool and settle. When you see it is very clear and settled, lade out the  Liquor into another Kiver, carefully, not to raise the settlings from the  bottom. As soon as you see any dregs begin to rise, stay your hand, and let  it remain unstirred, till all be settled down. Then lade out the Liquor  again, as before; and if need be, change it again into another Kiver: all  which is done to the end no dregs may go along with the Liquor in tunning  it into the vessel. When it is cold and perfect clear, tun it into a Cask,  that hath been used for Sack, and stop it up close, having an eye to give  it a little vent, if it should work. If it cast out any foul Liquor in  working, fill it up always presently with some of the same liquor, that you  have kept in bottles for that end. When it hath wrought, and is well  settled (which may be in about two months or ten weeks) draw it into  Glass-bottles, as long as it comes clear; and it will be ready to drink in  a Month or two: but will keep much longer, if you have occasion: and no  dregs will be in the bottom of the bottle.    He since told me, that to this Proportion of Honey and water, to make a  Hogshead of Meathe, you should boil half a pound of Hopps in the water,  and two good handfuls of Herbs; and six Ounces of Spice of all sorts: All  which will be mellowed and rotted away quite, (as well as the lushiousness  of the Honey) in the space of a year or two. For this is to be kept so long  before it be drunk.    If you would have it sooner ready to drink, you may work it with a little  yeast, when it is almost cold in the Kiver: and Tun it up as soon as it  begins to work, doing afterwards as is said before; but leaving a little  vent to purge by, till it have done working. Or in stead of yeast, you may  take the yolks of four New-laid-eggs, and almost half a pint of fine  Wheat-flower, and some of the Liquor you have made: beat them well  together, then put them to the Liquor in the Cask, and stop it up close,  till you see it needful, to give it a little vent.    Note, that yeast of good Beer, is better then that of Ale.           *       *       *       *       *    The first of Septemb. 1663. Mr. Webb came to my House to make some for Me.  He took fourty three Gallons of water, and fourty two pounds of Norfolk  honey. As soon as the water boiled, He put into it a slight handful of  Hops; which after it had boiled a little above a quarter of an hour, he  skimed off; then put in the honey to the boyling water, and presently a  white scum rose, which he skimed off still as it rose; which skiming was  ended in little above a quarter of an hour more. Then he put in his herbs  and spices, which were these: Rose-mary, Thyme, Winter-savory,  Sweet-marjoram, Sweet-bryar-leaves, seven or eight little Parsley-roots:  There was most of the Savoury, and least of the Eglantine, three Ounces of  Ginger, one Ounce and a half of Cinnamon, five Nutmegs (half an Ounce of  Cloves he would have added, but did not,) And these boiled an hour and a  quarter longer; in all from the first beginning to boil, somewhat less then  two hours: Then he presently laded it out of the Copper into Coolers,  letting it run through a Hair-sieve: And set the Coolers shelving (tilted  up) that the Liquor might afterwards run the more quietly out of them.  After the Liquor had stood so about two hours, he poured or laded out of  some of the Coolers very gently, that the dregs might not rise, into other  Coolers. And about a pint of very thick dregs remained last in the bottom  of every Cooler. That which ran out, was very clear: After two hours more  settling, (in a shelving situation,) He poured it out again into other  Coolers; and then very little dregs (or scarce any in some of the Coolers)  did remain. When the Liquor was even almost cold, He took the yolks of  three New-laid-eggs, a spoonful of fine white flower, and about half a pint  of new fresh barm of good strong Beer (you must have care that your barm be  very white and clean, not sullied and foul, as is usual among slovenly  Brewers in London). Beat this very well together, with a little of the  Liquor in a skiming dish, till you see it well incorporated, and that it  beginneth to work. Then put it to a pailful (of about two Gallons and a  half) of the Liquor, and mingle it well therewith. Then leave the skiming  dish reversed floating in the middle of the Liquor, and so the yest will  work up into and under the hollow of the dish, and grow out round about the  sides without. He left this well and thick covered all night, from about  eleven a clock at night; And the next morning, finding it had wrought very  well, He mingled what was in the Pail with the whole proportion of the  Liquor, and so Tunned it up into a Sack-cask. I am not satisfied, whether  he did not put a spoonful of fine white good Mustard into his Barm, before  he brought it hither, (for he took a pretext to look out some pure clean  white barm) but he protested, there was nothing mingled with the barm, yet  I am in doubt. He confessed to me that in making of Sider, He put's in half  as much Mustard as Barm; but never in Meathe. The fourth of September in  the morning, he Bottled up into Quart-bottles the two lesser Rundlets of  this Meathe (for he did Tun the whole quantity into one large Rundlet, and  two little ones) whereof the one contained thirty Bottles; and the other,  twenty two. There remained but little settling or dregs in the Bottom's of  the Barrels, but some there was. The Bottles were set into a cool Cellar,  and He said they would be ready to drink in three weeks. The Proportion of  Herbs and Spices is this; That there be so much as to drown the luscious  sweetness of the Honey; but not so much as to taste of herbs or spice, when  you drink the Meathe. But that the sweetnes of the honey may kill their  taste: And so the Meathe have a pleasant taste, but not of herbs, nor  spice, nor honey. And therefore you put more or less according to the time  you will drink it in. For a great deal will be mellowed away in a year,  that would be ungratefully strong in three months. And the honey that will  make it keep a year or two, will require a triple proportion of spice and  herbs. He commends Parsley roots to be in greatest quantity, boiled whole,  if young; but quarterred and pithed, if great and old.      MY OWN CONSIDERATIONS FOR MAKING OF MEATHE    Boil what quantity of Spring-water you please, three or four walms, and  then let it set the twenty four hours, and pour the clear from the  settling. Take sixteen Gallons of the clear, and boil in it ten handfuls of  Eglantine-leaves, five of Liverwort, five of Scabious, four of Baulm, four  of Rosemary; two of Bay-leaves; one of Thyme, and one of Sweet-marjoram,  and five Eringo-roots splitted. When the water hath drawn out the vertue of  the herbs (which it will do in half an hours boiling,) let it run through a  strainer or sieve, and let it settle so, that you may pour the clear from  the Dregs. To every three Gallons of the Clear, take one of Honey, and with  clean Arms stripped up, lade it for two or three hours, to dissolve the  honey in the water; lade it twice or thrice that day. The next day boil it  very gently to make the scum rise, and scum it all the while, and now and  then pour to it a ladle full of cold water, which will make the scum rise  more: when it is very clear from scum, you may boil it the more strongly,  till it bear an Egge very high, that the breadth of a groat be out of the  water, and that it boil high with great walms in the middle of the Kettle:  which boiling with great Bubbles in the middle is a sign it is boiled to  it's height. Then let it cool till it be Lukewarm, at which time put some  Ale yest into it, to make it work, as you would do Ale. And then put it up  into a fit Barrel first seasoned with some good sweet White-wine (as  Canary-sack) and keep the bung open, till it have done working, filling it  up with some such honey-drink warmed, as you find it sink down by working  over. When it hath almost done working, put into it a bag of thin stuff  (such as Bakers use to bolt in) fastened by a Cord at the bung, containing  two parts of Ginger-sliced, and one apiece of Cinamon, Cloves and Nutmegs,  with a Pebble-stone in it to make it sink; And stop it up close for six  Months or a year, and then you may draw it into bottles. If you like  Cardamon-seeds, you may adde some of them to the spices. Some do like Mint  exceedingly to be added to the other herbs. Where no yeast is to be had,  The Liquor will work if you set it some days in the hot Sun (with a cover,  like the roof of a house over it, to keep wet out, if it chance to rain)  but then you must have great care, to fill it up, as it consumeth, and to  stop it close a little before it hath done working, and to set it then  presently in a Cool Cellar. I am told that the Leaven of bread will make it  work as well as yest, but I have not tryed it. If you will not have it so  strong, it will be much sooner ready to drink; As if you take six parts of  water to one of Honey.

In  regard to all other castes, however, the Brahman, humble as his worldly  _status_ may be, retains an undisputed pre-eminence which he never  forgets or allows to be forgotten, though it may only be a pale  reflection of the prestige and authority of his more exalted  caste-men--a prestige and authority, be it added, which have often been  justified by individual achievements. How far the influence of  Brahmanism as a system has been socially a good or an evil influence I  am not concerned to discuss, but, however antagonistic it may be at the  present moment to the influence of Western civilization, it would be  unfair to deny that it has shown itself and still shows itself capable  of producing a very high type both of intellect and of character. Nor  could it otherwise have survived as it has the vicissitudes of  centuries.    Neither the triumph of Buddhism, which lasted for nearly 500 years, nor  successive waves of Mahomedan conquest availed to destroy the power of  Brahmanism, nor has it been broken by British supremacy. Inflexibly as  he dominates a social system in all essentials more rigid than any  other, the Brahman has not only recognised the need of a certain  plasticity in its construction which allows for constant expansion, but  he has himself shown unfailing adaptability in all non-essentials to  varying circumstances. To the requirements of their new Western masters  the Brahmans adapted themselves from the first with admirable  suppleness, and when a Western system of education was introduced into  India in the first half of the last century, they were quicker than any  other class to realize how it could be used to fortify their own  position. The main original object of the introduction of Western  education into India was the training of a sufficient number of young  Indians to fill the subordinate posts in the public offices with  English-speaking natives. The Brahmans responded freely to the call, and  they soon acquired almost the same monopoly of the new Western learning  as they had enjoyed of Hindu lore through the centuries. With the  development of the great administrative services, with the substitution  of English for the vernacular tongues as the only official language,  with the remodelling of judicial administration and procedure on British  lines, with the growth of the liberal professions and of the Press,  their influence constantly found new fields of activity, whilst through  the old traditional channels it continued to permeate those strata of  Hindu society with which the West had established little or no contact.    Nevertheless the spread of Western ideas and habits was bound to loosen  to some extent the Brahmans' hold upon Hindu society, for that hold is  chiefly rooted in the immemorial sanctity of custom, which new habits  and methods imported from the West necessarily tended to undermine.  Scrupulous--and, according to many earnest Englishmen, over-scrupulous--as  we were to respect religious beliefs and prejudices, the influence of  Western civilization could not fail to clash directly or indirectly with  many of the ordinances of Hindu orthodoxy. In non-essentials Brahmanism  soon found it expedient to relax the rigour of caste obligations, as for  instance to meet the hard case of young Hindus who could not travel across  the \"black water\" to Europe for their studies without breaking caste, or  indeed travel even in their own country in railways and river steamers  without incurring the pollution of bodily contact with the \"untouchable\"  castes. Penances were at first imposed which had gradually to be lightened  until they came to be merely nominal. Graver issues were raised when such  ancient customs as infant  marriage and the degradation of child widows  were challenged. The ferment of new ideas was spreading amongst the  Brahmans themselves. Some had openly discarded their ancestral faith, and  many more were moved to search their own scriptures for some interpretation  of the law less inconsistent with Western standards. It seemed at one  moment as if, under the inspiration of men like Ranade in the Deccan and  Tagore in Bengal, Brahmanism itself was about to take the lead in purging  Hinduism of its most baneful superstitions and bringing it into line with  the philosophy and ethics of the West. But the liberal movement failed to  prevail against the forces of popular superstition and orthodox bigotry,  combined with the bitterness too frequently resulting from the failure  of Western education to secure material success or even an adequate  livelihood for those who had departed from the old ways. Though there  have been and still are many admirable exceptions, Brahmanism remained  the stronghold of reaction against the Western invasion. Of recent  years, educated Brahmans have figured prominently in the social and  religious revival of Hinduism, and they have figured no less  prominently, whether in the ranks of the extremists or amongst the  moderate and advanced politicians, in the political movement which has  accompanied that revival.          CHAPTER IV.    BRAHMANISM AND DISAFFECTION IN THE DECCAN.      Fundamental as is the antagonism between the civilization represented by  the British _Raj_ and the essential spirit of Brahmanism. It is not, of  course, always or everywhere equally acute, for there is no more  uniformity about Brahmanism than about any other Indian growth. But in  the Deccan Brahmanism has remained more fiercely militant than in any  other part of India, chiefly perhaps because nowhere had it wielded such  absolute power within times which may still be called recent. Far into  the eighteenth century Poona had been the capital of a theocratic State  in which behind the throne of the Peshwas both spiritual and secular  authority were concentrated in the hands of the Brahmans. Such memories  are slow to die and least of all in an ancient and conservative country  like India, and there was one sept of Brahmans, at any rate, who were  determined not to let them die.    The Chitpavan Brahmans are undoubtedly the most powerful and the most  able of all the Brahmans of the Deccan. A curious legend ascribes their  origin to the miraculous intervention of Parashurama, the sixth Avatar  of the god Vishnu, who finding no Brahmans to release him by the  accustomed ritual from the defilement of his earthly labours, dragged on  to shore the bodies of fourteen barbarians that he had found washed up  from the ocean, burnt them on a funeral pyre and then breathed life and  Brahmanhood into their ashes. On these new made Brahmans he conferred  the name Chitpavan, which means \"purified by fire,\" and all the land of  the Konkan from which, by a bolt from his arrow, he caused the sea for  ever to recede. Every Chitpavan to-day claims descent from one or other  of the fourteen divinely Brahmanized barbarians, whom some believe to  have been hardy Norsemen driven in their long ships on to the sandy  shores of what is now the Bombay Presidency. At any rate, as has been  well said of them, Western daring and Eastern craft look out alike from  the alert features and clear parchment skin and through the strange  stone-grey eyes of the Chitpavan. It was not, however, till about two  centuries ago that the Chitpavan Brahmans began to play a conspicuous  part in Indian history, when one of this sept, Balaji Vishvanath Rao,  worked his way up at the Court of the Mahratta King Shahu to the  position of Peshwa, or Prime Minister, which he succeeded even in  bequeathing to his son, the great Bajirao Balaji, who led the Mahratta  armies right up to the walls of Delhi. Bajirao's son not only succeeded  as Balaji II., but on the death of King Shahu disposed of his Royal  master's family by a bold Palace conspiracy and openly assumed sovereign  powers. The crushing defeat of Panipat brought him to his grave, and  though the dynasty was still continued, and regained some of its lustre  under Madhao Rao I., the Peshwas subsequently became little more than  _rois faineants_ in the hands of their Ministers, and especially in  those of the great Regent Nana Phadnavis. He, too, was a Chitpavan  Brahman, and it was under his reign that his fellow caste-men acquired  so complete a monopoly of all the chief offices of State that the  Mahratta Empire became essentially a Chitpavan Empire. The British arms  ultimately defeated the dreams of universal dominion which, in the then  condition of India, the Chitpavans might well have hoped to establish  on the ruins of the great Moghul Empire. But British rule did not  destroy their power. They were quick to adapt themselves to new  conditions and above all to avail themselves of the advantages of  Western education. Their great administrative abilities compelled  recognition, and Chitpavans swarm to-day in every Government office of  the Deccan as they did in the days of Nana Phadnavis. They sit on the  Bench, they dominate the Bar, they teach in the schools, they control  the vernacular Press, they have furnished almost all the most  conspicuous names in the modern literature and drama of Western India as  well as in politics. Of the higher appointments held by natives in the  Presidency of Bombay, the last census tells us that the Hindus held 266  against 86 held by Parsees and 23 held by Mahomedans, and that out of  those held by the Hindus, more than 72 per cent. were held by Brahmans,  though the Brahmans form less than one-fourteenth of the total Hindu  population of the province. All Brahmans are not, of course, Chitpavans,  but the Chitpavans supply an overwhelming majority of those Government  officials, and their ascendency over every other"]]]
