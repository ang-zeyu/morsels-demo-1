Even in the sixth month an act of remarkable _adaptiveness_ was once  observed, which can not be called either accidental or entirely  voluntary, and if it was fully purposed it would indicate a  well-advanced development of understanding in regard to food without  knowledge of words. When the child, viz., after considerable  experience in nursing at the breast, discovered that the flow of milk  was less abundant, he used to place his hand hard on the breast as if  he wanted to force out the milk by pressure. Of course there was here  no insight into the causal connection, but it is a question whether  the firm laying on of the little hand was not repeated for the reason  that the experience had been once made accidentally, that after doing  this the nursing was less difficult.    On the other hand, an unequivocal complicated act of deliberation  occurred in the seventeenth month. The child could not reach his  playthings in the cupboard, because it was too high for him; he ran  about, brought a traveling-bag, got upon it, and took what he wanted.  In this case he could not possibly think in words, since he did not  yet know words.    My child tries further (in the nineteenth and twentieth months) in a  twofold fashion to make known his eager wish to leave the room, not  being as yet able to speak. He takes any cloth he fancies and brings  it to me. I put it about him, he wraps himself in it, and, climbing  beseechingly on my knee, makes longing, pitiful sounds, which do not  cease until after I have opened a door through which he goes into  another room. Then he immediately throws away the cloth and runs about  exulting.    The other performance is this: When the child feels the need of  relieving his bowels, he is accustomed to make peculiar grunting  sounds, by means of a strain of the abdomen, shutting the mouth and  breathing loud, by jerks, through the nose. He is then taken away.  Now, if he is not suited with the place where he happens to be, at any  time, he begins to make just such sounds. If he is taken away, no such  need appears at all, but he is in high glee. Here is the expectation,  \"I shall be taken away if I make that sound.\"    Whether we are to admit, in addition, an intentional _deception_ in this  case, or whether only a logical process takes place, I can not decide.  In the whole earlier and later behavior of the child there is no ground  for the first assumption, and the fact that he employs this artifice  while in his carriage, immediately after he has been waited on, is  directly against it.    To how small an extent, some time previous to this, perceptions were  made use of _to simplify his own exertions_, i. e., were combined and  had motor effect, appears from an observation in the sixteenth month.  Earlier than this, when I used to say, \"Give the ring,\" I always laid an  ivory ring, that was tied to a thread, before the child, on the table. I  now said the same thing--after an interval of a week--while the same  ring was hanging near the chair by a red thread a foot long, so that the  child, as he sat on the chair, could just reach it, but only with much  pains. He made a grasp now, upon getting the sound-impression \"ring,\"  not at the thread, which would have made the seizure of the ring,  hanging freely, very easy for him, but directly at the ring hanging far  below him, and gave it to me. And when the command was repeated, it did  not occur to him to touch the thread.    It is likewise a sign of small understanding that the mouth is always  opened in smelling of a fragrant flower or perfume (Vol. I, p. 135).  Deficiencies of this kind are, indeed, quite logical from the standpoint  of childish experience. Because, at an earlier period the pleasant smell  (of milk) always came in connection with the pleasant taste, therefore,  thinks the child, in every case where there is a pleasant smell there  will also be something that tastes good. The common or collective  concept _taste-smell_ had not yet (in the seventeenth month) been  differentiated into the concepts taste and smell.    In the department of the sense of hearing the differentiation generally  makes its appearance earlier; memory, as a rule, later. Yet children  whose talent for music is developed early, retain _melodies_ even in  their first year of life. A girl to whom some of the Froebel songs were  sung, and who was taught appropriate movements of the hands and feet,  always performed the proper movement when one of the melodies was merely  hummed, or a verse was said (in the thirteenth month), without  confounding them at all. This early and firm association of sound-images  with motor-images is possible only when interest is attached to it--i. e.,  when the attention has been directed often, persistently, and with  concentration, upon the things to be combined. Thus, this very child (in  the nineteenth month), when her favorite song, \"Who will go for a  Soldier?\" (\"Wer will unter die Soldaten?\") was sung to her, could not  only join in the rhyme at the end of the verse, but, no matter where a  stop was made, she would go on, in a manner imperfect, indeed, but  easily intelligible (Frau Dr. Friedemann).    Here, however, in addition to memory and attention, heredity is to be  considered; since such a talent is wholly lacking in certain families,  but in others exists in all the brothers and sisters.    In performances of this kind, a superior understanding is not by any  means exhibited, but a stronger memory and faculty of association. These  associations are not, however, of a logical sort, but are habits  acquired through training, and they may even retard the development of  the intellect if they become numerous. For they may obstruct the  formation, at an early period, of independent ideas, merely on account  of the time they claim. Often, too, these artificial associations are  almost useless for the development of the intellect. They are too  special. On this ground I am compelled to censure the extravagancies,  that are wide-spread especially in Germany, of the Froebel methods of  occupying young children.    The _logic of the child_ naturally operates at the beginning with much  more extensive, and therefore less intensive, notions than those of  adults, with notions which the adult no longer forms. But the child does  not, on that account, proceed illogically, although he does proceed  awkwardly. Some further examples may illustrate.    The adult does not ordinarily try whether a door that he has just bolted  is fast; but the one-year-old child tests carefully the edge of the  door he has shut, to see whether it is really closed, because he does  not understand the effect of lock and bolt. For even in the eighteenth  month he goes back and forth with a key, to the writing-desk, with the  evident purpose of opening it. But at twelve months, when he tries  whether it is fast, he does not think of the key at all, and does not  yet possess a single word.    An adult, before watering flowers with a watering-pot, will look to see  whether there is water in it. The child of a year and a half, who has  seen how watering is done, finds special pleasure in going from flower  to flower, even with an empty watering-pot, and making the motions of  pouring upon each one separately, as if water would really come out. For  him the notion \"watering-pot\" is identical with the notion \"filled  watering-pot,\" because at first he was acquainted with the latter only.    Much of what is attributed to imagination in very young children rests  essentially on the formation of such vague concepts, on the inability to  combine constant qualities into sharply defined concepts. When, in the  twenty-third month, the child holds an empty cup to his mouth and sips  and swallows, and does it repeatedly, and with a serene, happy  expression, this \"play\" is founded chiefly on the imperfect notion  \"filled cup.\" The child has so often perceived something to drink,  drinking-vessel, and the act of drinking, in combination with one  another, that the one peremptorily demands the other when either appears  singly; hence the pleasure in pouring out from empty pitchers into empty  cups, and in drinking out of empty cups (in second to fifth years).  When adults do the same in the play of the theatre, this action always  has a value as language, it signifies something for other persons; but  with the child, who plays in this fashion entirely alone, the pleasure  consists in the production of familiar ideas together with agreeable  feelings, which are, as it were, crystallized with comparative clearness  out of the dull mass of undefined perceptions. These memory-images  become real existences, like the hallucinations of the insane, because  the sensuous impressions probably impress themselves directly--without  reflection--upon the growing brain, and hence the memory-images of them,  on account of their vividness, can not always be surely distinguished  from the perceptions themselves. Most of the plays that children invent  of themselves may be referred to this fact; on the other hand, the play  of hide-and-seek (especially in the seventeenth and eighteenth months),  and, nearly allied to this, the hunting after scraps of paper, bits of  biscuit, buttons, and other favorite objects (in the fifteenth month),  constitute an intellectual advance.    By practice in this kind of seeking for well-known, purposely concealed  objects, the intelligence of little children can easily be increased to  an astonishing degree, so that toward the end of the second year they  already understand some simple tricks of the juggler; for example,  making a card disappear. But after I had discontinued such exercises for  months, the ordinary capacity for being duped was again present.    This ease with which children can be deceived is to be attributed to  lack of experience far more"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19550"],[0,"Natural History of the Mammalia of India and Ceylon (#10)"],[1,"to half of a grain will kill a dog in from  five to ten minutes, and even one twenty-fourth of a grain will have  a decided tetanic effect in human beings of delicate  temperament.\"--_Cooley's Cycl_. Two days after _ten_ grains of  strychnine were dissolved in spirits of wine, and mixed with rum and  water, cold but sweet, which the animal drank with relish, and  remained unhurt.    The same experiment was tried with one of another genus (_Inuus  rhesus_), who rejected the poisoned fruit at once, and on having  strychnine in solution poured down his throat, died.    The _Langur_ was then tried with cyanide of potassium, which he  rejected at once, but on being forced to take a few grains, was dead  in a few seconds.    Although we may not sympathize with those who practise such cruel  experiments as these above alluded to, the facts elucidated are worth  recording, and tend to prove the peculiar herbivorous nature of this  genus, which, in common with other strictly herbivorous animals,  instinctively knows what to choose and what to avoid, and can partake,  without danger, of some of the most virulent vegetable poisons. It  is possible that in the forests they eat the fruit of the _Strychnos  nux-vomica_, which is also the favourite food of the pied hornbill  (_Hydrocissa coronata_).      NO. 4. SEMNOPITHECUS _vel_ PRESBYTES ENTELLUS.  _The Bengal Langur_ (_Jerdon's No. 1_).    NATIVE NAMES.--_Langur_, _Hanuman_, Hindi; _Wanur_ and _Makur_,  Mahratti; _Musya_, Canarese.    HABITAT.--Bengal and Central India.    [Figure: _Presbytes entellus_.]    DESCRIPTION.--Pale dirty or ashy grey; darker on the shoulders and  rump; greyish-brown on the tail; paler on the head and lower parts;  hands and feet black.    SIZE.--Length of male thirty inches to root of tail; tail forty-three  inches.    The _Entellus_ monkey is in some parts of India deemed sacred, and  is permitted by the Hindus to plunder their grain-shops with  impunity; but I think that with increasing hard times the _Hanumans_  are not allowed such freedom as they used to have, and in most parts  of India I have been in they are considered an unmitigated nuisance,  and the people have implored the aid of Europeans to get rid of their  tormentors. In the forest the _Langur_ lives on grain, fruit, the  pods of leguminous trees, and young buds and leaves. Sir Emerson  Tennent notices the fondness of an allied species for the flowers  of the red hibiscus (_H. rosa sinensis_). The female has usually only  one young one, though sometimes twins. The very young babies have  not black but light-coloured faces, which darken afterwards. I have  always found them most difficult to rear, requiring almost as much  attention as a human baby. Their diet and hours of feeding must be  as systematically arranged; and if cow's milk be given it must be  freely diluted with water--two-thirds to one-third milk when very  young, and afterwards decreased to one-half. They are extremely  susceptible to cold. In confinement they are quiet and gentle whilst  young, but the old males are generally sullen and treacherous. Jerdon  says, on the authority of the _Bengal Sporting Magazine_ (August  1836), that the males live apart from the females, who have only one  or two old males with each colony, and that they have fights at  certain seasons, when the vanquished males receive charge of all the  young ones of their own sex, with whom they retire to some  neighbouring jungle. Blyth notices that in one locality he found only  males of all ages, and in another chiefly females. I have found these  monkeys mostly on the banks of streams in the forests of the Central  Provinces; in fact, the presence of them anywhere in arid jungles  is a sign that water is somewhere in the vicinity. They are timid  creatures, and I have never seen the slightest disposition about them  to show fight, whereas I was once most deliberately charged by the  old males of a party of _Rhesus_ monkeys. I was at the time on field  service during the Mutiny, and, seeing several nursing mothers in  the party, tried to run them down in the open and secure a baby; but  they were too quick for me, and, on being attacked by the old males,  I had to pistol the leader.      NO. 5. SEMNOPITHECUS _vel_ PRESBYTES SCHISTACEUS.[5]  _The Himalayan Langur_ (_Jerdon's No. 2_).    [Footnote 5: Mr. J. Cockburn, of the Imperial Museum, has, since I  wrote about the preceding species, given me some interesting  information regarding the geographical distribution of _Presbytes  entellus_ and _Hylobates hooluck_. He says: \"The latter has never  been known to occur on the north bank of the Brahmaputra, though  swarming in the forests at the very water's edge on the south bank.  The _entellus_ monkey is also not found on the north bank of the  Ganges, and attempts at its introduction have repeatedly failed.\"  _P. schistaceus_ replaces it in the Sub-Himalayan forests.]    NATIVE NAMES.--_Langur_, Hindi; _Kamba Suhu_, Lepcha; _Kubup_, Bhotia.    HABITAT.--The whole range of the Himalayas from Nepal to beyond Simla.    DESCRIPTION (after Hodgson).--Dark slaty above; head and lower parts  pale yellowish; hands concolorous with body, or only a little darker;  tail slightly tufted; hair on the crown of the head short and  radiated; on the cheeks long, directed backwards, and covering the  ears. Hutton's description is, dark greyish, with pale hands and feet,  white head, dark face, white throat and breast, and white tip to the  tail.    SIZE.--About thirty inches; tail, thirty-six inches.    Captain Hutton, writing from Mussoorie, says: \"On the Simla side I  observed them also, leaping and playing about, while the fir-trees,  among which they sported, were loaded with snow-wreaths, at an  elevation of 11,000 feet.\"--'Jour. As. Soc. Beng.' xiii. p. 471.    Dr. Anderson remarks on the skull of this species, that it can be  easily distinguished from _entellus_ by its larger size, the  supraorbital ridge being less forwardly projected, and not forming  so thick and wide a pent roof, but the most marked difference lies  in the much longer facial portion of _schistaceus_; the teeth are  also larger; the symphysis or junction of the lower jaw is  considerably longer and broader, and the lower jaw itself is  generally more massive and deep.      NO. 6. SEMNOPITHECUS _vel_ PRESBYTES PRIAMUS.  _The Madras Langur_.    NATIVE NAME.--_Gandangi_, Telugu.    HABITAT.--The Coromandel Coast and Ceylon.    DESCRIPTION.--Ashy grey, with a pale reddish or _chocolat-au-lait_  tint overlying the whole back and head; sides of the head, chin,  throat, and beneath pale yellowish; hands and feet whitish; face,  palms and fingers, and soles of feet and toes black; hair long and  straight, not wavy; tail of the colour of the darker portion of the  back, ending in a whitish tuft.--_Jerdon_.    SIZE.--About the same as _P. entellus_.    Blyth, who is followed by Jerdon, describes this monkey as having  a compressed high vertical crest, but Dr. Anderson found that the  specimens in the Indian Museum owed these crests to bad stuffing.  Kellaart, however, mentions it, and calls the animal \"the Crested  Monkey.\" In Sir Emerson Tennent's figure of _P. priamus_ a slight  crest is noticeable; but Kellaart is very positive on this point,  saying: \"_P. priamus_ is easily distinguished from all other known  species of monkeys in Ceylon by its high compressed vertical crest.\"    Jerdon says this species is not found on the Malabar Coast, but  neither he nor McMaster give much information regarding it. Emerson  Tennent writes: \"At Jaffna, and in other parts of the island where  the population is comparatively numerous, these monkeys become so  familiarised with the presence of man as to exhibit the utmost daring  and indifference. A flock of them will take possession of a palmyra  palm, and so effectually can they crouch and conceal themselves among  the leaves that, on the slightest alarm, the whole party becomes  invisible in an instant. The presence of a dog, however, excites such  irrepressible curiosity that, in order to watch his movements, they  never fail to betray themselves. They may be frequently seen  congregated on the roof of a native hut; and, some years ago, the  child of a European clergyman, stationed near Jaffna, having been  left on the ground by the nurse, was so teased and bitten by them  as to cause its death.\"    In these particulars this species resembles _P. entellus_.      NO. 7. SEMNOPITHECUS _vel_ PRESBYTES JOHNII.  _The Malabar Langur_ (_Jerdon's No. 4_).    HABITAT.--The Malabar Coast, from N. Lat. 14 degrees or 15 degrees  to Cape Comorin.    DESCRIPTION.--Above dusky brown, slightly paling on the sides; crown,  occiput, sides of head and beard fulvous, darkest on the crown; limbs  and tail dark brown, almost black; beneath yellowish white.--_Jerdon_.    SIZE.--Not quite so large as _P. entellus_.    This monkey was named after a member of the Danish factory at  Tranquebar, M. John, who first described it. It abounds in forests,  and does not frequent villages, though it will visit gardens and  fields, where, however, it shuns observation.    The young are of a sooty brown, or nearly black, without any  indication of the light-coloured hood of the adult.      NO. 8. SEMNOPITHECUS _vel_ PRESBYTES JUBATUS.  _The Nilgheri Langur_ (_Jerdon's No. 5_).    HABITAT.--The Nilgheri Hills, the Animallies, Pulneys, the Wynaad,  and all the higher parts of the range of the Ghats as low as  Travancore.    DESCRIPTION.--Dark glossy black throughout, except head and nape,  which are reddish brown; hair very long; in old individuals a greyish  patch on the rump.--_Jerdon_.    SIZE.--Length of head and body, 26 inches; tail, 30.    This monkey does not, as a rule, descend lower than 2,500 to 3,000  feet; it is shy and wary. The fur is fine and glossy, and is much  prized (Jerdon). Its flesh is excellent food for dogs (McMaster).    Dr. Anderson makes this synonymous"]]]
