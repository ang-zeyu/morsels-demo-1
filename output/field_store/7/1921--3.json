In children  they are those which they have received from the habits of their  fathers, as hunting in animals. A different custom will cause different  natural principles. This is seen in experience; and if there are some  natural principles ineradicable by custom, there are also some customs  opposed to nature, ineradicable by nature, or by a second custom. This  depends on disposition.      93    Parents fear lest the natural love of their children may fade away. What  kind of nature is that which is subject to decay? Custom is a second  nature which destroys the former.[58] But what is nature? For is custom  not natural? I am much afraid that nature is itself only a first custom,  as custom is a second nature.      94    The nature of man is wholly natural, _omne animal_.[59]    There is nothing he may not make natural; there is nothing natural he  may not lose.      95    Memory, joy, are intuitions; and even mathematical propositions become  intuitions, for education produces natural intuitions, and natural  intuitions are erased by education.      96    When we are accustomed to use bad reasons for proving natural effects,  we are not willing to receive good reasons when they are discovered. An  example may be given from the circulation of the blood as a reason why  the vein swells below the ligature.      97    The most important affair in life is the choice of a calling; chance  decides it. Custom makes men masons, soldiers, slaters. \"He is a good  slater,\" says one, and, speaking of soldiers, remarks, \"They are perfect  fools.\" But others affirm, \"There is nothing great but war, the rest of  men are good for nothing.\" We choose our callings according as we hear  this or that praised or despised in our childhood, for we naturally love  truth and hate folly. These words move us; the only error is in their  application. So great is the force of custom that out of those whom  nature has only made men, are created all conditions of men. For some  districts are full of masons, others of soldiers, etc. Certainly nature  is not so uniform. It is custom then which does this, for it constrains  nature. But sometimes nature gains the ascendancy, and preserves man's  instinct, in spite of all custom, good or bad.      98    _Bias leading to error._--It is a deplorable thing to see all men  deliberating on means alone, and not on the end. Each thinks how he will  acquit himself in his condition; but as for the choice of condition, or  of country, chance gives them to us.    It is a pitiable thing to see so many Turks, heretics, and infidels  follow the way of their fathers for the sole reason that each has been  imbued with the prejudice that it is the best. And that fixes for each  man his conditions of locksmith, soldier, etc.    Hence savages care nothing for Providence.[60]      99    There is an universal and essential difference between the actions of  the will and all other actions.    The will is one of the chief factors in belief, not that it creates  belief, but because things are true or false according to the aspect in  which we look at them. The will, which prefers one aspect to another,  turns away the mind from considering the qualities of all that it does  not like to see; and thus the mind, moving in accord with the will,  stops to consider the aspect which it likes, and so judges by what it  sees.      100    _Self-love._--The nature of self-love and of this human Ego is to love  self only and consider self only. But what will man do? He cannot  prevent this object that he loves from being full of faults and wants.  He wants to be great, and he sees himself small. He wants to be happy,  and he sees himself miserable. He wants to be perfect, and he sees  himself full of imperfections. He wants to be the object of love and  esteem among men, and he sees that his faults merit only their hatred  and contempt. This embarrassment in which he finds himself produces in  him the most unrighteous and criminal passion that can be imagined; for  he conceives a mortal enmity against that truth which reproves him, and  which convinces him of his faults. He would annihilate it, but, unable  to destroy it in its essence, he destroys it as far as possible in his  own knowledge and in that of others; that is to say, he devotes all his  attention to hiding his faults both from others and from himself, and he  cannot endure either that others should point them out to him, or that  they should see them.    Truly it is an evil to be full of faults; but it is a still greater evil  to be full of them, and to be unwilling to recognise them, since that is  to add the further fault of a voluntary illusion. We do not like others  to deceive us; we do not think it fair that they should be held in  higher esteem by us than they deserve; it is not then fair that we  should deceive them, and should wish them to esteem us more highly than  we deserve.    Thus, when they discover only the imperfections and vices which we  really have, it is plain they do us no wrong, since it is not they who  cause them; they rather do us good, since they help us to free ourselves  from an evil, namely, the ignorance of these imperfections. We ought not  to be angry at their knowing our faults and despising us; it is but  right that they should know us for what we are, and should despise us,  if we are contemptible.    Such are the feelings that would arise in a heart full of equity and  justice. What must we say then of our own heart, when we see in it a  wholly different disposition? For is it not true that we hate truth and  those who tell it us, and that we like them to be deceived in our  favour, and prefer to be esteemed by them as being other than what we  are in fact? One proof of this makes me shudder. The Catholic religion  does not bind us to confess our sins indiscriminately to everybody; it  allows them to remain hidden from all other men save one, to whom she  bids us reveal the innermost recesses of our heart, and show ourselves  as we are. There is only this one man in the world whom she orders us to  undeceive, and she binds him to an inviolable secrecy, which makes this  knowledge to him as if it were not. Can we imagine anything more  charitable and pleasant? And yet the corruption of man is such that he  finds even this law harsh; and it is one of the main reasons which has  caused a great part of Europe to rebel against the Church.[61]    How unjust and unreasonable is the heart of man, which feels it  disagreeable to be obliged to do in regard to one man what in some  measure it were right to do to all men! For is it right that we should  deceive men?    There are different degrees in this aversion to truth; but all may  perhaps be said to have it in some degree, because it is inseparable  from self-love. It is this false delicacy which makes those who are  under the necessity of reproving others choose so many windings and  middle courses to avoid offence. They must lessen our faults, appear to  excuse them, intersperse praises and evidence of love and esteem.  Despite all this, the medicine does not cease to be bitter to self-love.  It takes as little as it can, always with disgust, and often with a  secret spite against those who administer it.    Hence it happens that if any have some interest in being loved by us,  they are averse to render us a service which they know to be  disagreeable. They treat us as we wish to be treated. We hate the truth,  and they hide it from us. We desire flattery, and they flatter us. We  like to be deceived, and they deceive us.    So each degree of good fortune which raises us in the world removes us  farther from truth, because we are most afraid of wounding those whose  affection is most useful and whose dislike is most dangerous. A prince  may be the byword of all Europe, and he alone will know nothing of it. I  am not astonished. To tell the truth is useful to those to whom it is  spoken, but disadvantageous to those who tell it, because it makes them  disliked. Now those who live with princes love their own interests more  than that of the prince whom they serve; and so they take care not to  confer on him a benefit so as to injure themselves.    This evil is no doubt greater and more common among the higher classes;  but the lower are not exempt from it, since there is always some  advantage in making men love us. Human life is thus only a perpetual  illusion; men deceive and flatter each other. No one speaks of us in our  presence as he does of us in our absence. Human society is founded on  mutual deceit; few friendships would endure if each knew what his friend  said of him in his absence, although he then spoke in sincerity and  without passion.    Man is then only disguise, falsehood, and hypocrisy, both in himself and  in regard to others. He does not wish any one to tell him the truth; he  avoids telling it to others, and all these dispositions, so removed from  justice and reason, have a natural root in his heart.      101    I set it down as a fact that if all men knew what each said of the  other, there would not be four friends in the world. This is apparent  from the quarrels which arise from the indiscreet tales told from time  to time. [I say, further, all men would be ...]      102    Some vices only lay hold of us by means of others, and these, like  branches, fall on removal of the trunk."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18273"],[0,"The Wild Tribes of Davao District, Mindanao (#10)"],[1," When  gathering grain and forest products, or when searching for snails, the  woman attaches a small basket to her belt so that it hangs at a  convenient height against her thigh. We have previously noticed the  decorated bags and baskets which serve as pockets, and also contain the  betel nut outfits.    FIG. 30. CARRYING FRAME.    A small child is supported at the mother's hip by means of a broad sash,  which passes over the right shoulder and under the left arm. When it is  able to walk the scarf is discarded, and it sits astride the mother's  hip, where it is held in place by her left arm. Older children and the  men devote considerable time to the newcomers, but at a very early age  the youngsters begin to run about as wild and carefree as only little  savages can.    The Bagobo is a keen trader and many small articles of all kinds reach,  and pass from him through trade; and to make this barter possible he  intentionally produces an excess of certain things. Chief of these is  hemp, which he now carries to the coast traders, and for which he  receives trade cloth, iron pots, copper gongs, bells, and the beads  which he prizes so highly. In exchange for the betel boxes, bells, and  knife guards, which come from his forge, he receives shell disks,  certain articles of dress, cooking pots, and various other household  articles as well as salt and some animals. The knives made by him are in  great demand and often travel far inland. While among the Bukidnon of  the North-Central part of the Island the writer secured one blade and  guard of undoubted Bagobo workmanship. In early days, Chinese and Moro  traders brought gongs, jars, plates, and other crockery, as well as many  other articles now among the prized heirlooms of wealthy men or  occupying an important place in the ceremonial life of the tribe.  Through these same channels came the Borneo ivory of which the ear plugs  are made, while other objects from more distant regions were  occasionally brought in. Two examples of this trade are now in the  collections of the Field Museum of Natural History. One is a jacket made  from Javanese cloth; the second a belt buckle which apparently  originated in Perak.    Local feuds, as well as the desire of individuals to be known as  _magani_, have always made it unsafe for small numbers of traders to  venture to any great distance from home, and this has been a great  hindrance to trade. However, large parties, even from other tribes,  sometimes go to a village for purposes of trade, having previously  notified the inhabitants of their intentions. While in Malilla the  writer met with a party of thirty Bila-an traders who lived three days'  march to the east. The influence of capture, intermarriage, and looting,  in carrying the artifacts of one tribe into the territory of another has  previously been mentioned.    WARFARE.    The offensive weapons used by the Bagobo are spears, knives (Fig. 15 and  Plate XXXII), and at times bows and arrows (Fig. 17). For defense they  carry shields, either round or oblong (Figs. 31-32), and cover the body  with so many strips of hemp cloth that a knife thrust is warded off.  Turning his body sideways to the enemy, the warrior crouches behind his  shield, keeping up a continuous capering, rushing forward or dancing  backward, seeking for an opening but seldom coming to close quarters.  Arrows and spears are glanced off with the shield. An attack is usually  initiated by the throwing of spears, then, if the enemy is at a  disadvantage or confused, the warriors rush in to close combat. For this  purpose they rely entirely on their knives, and as fencers they are  unexcelled. They are but indifferent shots with the bow and arrow, and  that weapon is but little used in actual combat. It has been frequently  stated that these arrows are poisoned but I was unable to discover a  single specimen so prepared. When hard-pressed, or when a camp must be  made in dangerous territory, sharpened bamboo sticks--_sogiang_--are stuck  into the ground with their points directed toward the enemy. These must  be carefully gathered up by the pursuers, who otherwise run the risk of  having the knife-like blades driven into their feet. Old warriors state  that in former years they not only covered the upper part of the body  with hemp cloth but wound over this long decorated strips called  _gindua_; they also tell of coats of mail made of carabao horn or  rattan. None of these outfits exist in the territory today, but it is  not at all improbable that they were formerly in use, for the long  decorated bands are still found among the Bukidnon of the North, with  whom some trade is carried on; and a few coats of mail are to be seen  among the neighboring Moro.

Hostile raids against the neighboring Bila-an, Tagakaolo, and Ata seem  to have been common from the most ancient times. After the arrival of  the Spaniards there were many minor conflicts with the Moro, and the  tribal history takes note of several serious feuds between Bagobo  villages. Single warriors, usually those desiring to become _magani_,  sometimes enter hostile territory and there lie in wait for an  opportunity to spear a passing foe. The fact that these attacks are  frequently from ambush, or that whole families are slain while asleep on  the floors of their houses, does not seem to detract in the least from  the honor due for the deed. Generally, parties of sixty or more, under  the direction of a _magani_, are made up to avenge the death of their  townspeople, to secure loot and slaves, or to win glory and distinction.  An ambush is formed near to a hostile village and just at dawn an attack  is made on the early risers who are scattered and unprepared. The  invaders are usually satisfied with a few victims and then make their  escape. Women and children are either killed or are carried away as  slaves. It is customary for all the warriors to make at least one cut in  the bodies, and to eat a portion of the livers of enemies who have shown  great bravery, for in this way it is thought they gain in that quality.  This seems to be the only occasion when human flesh is tasted, despite  the fact that the members of this tribe have been frequently referred to  as cannibals.    The warriors of Cibolan and Malilla formerly carried heads of enemies to  their towns and made use of them during the _GinEm_ ceremony, while at  Bansalan and Digos a lock of hair, cut from the head of the slain,  answered the same purpose. Individual raiders sometimes carry home a  head or a hand as evidence of a successful fight, and at such times  festivals may be held to celebrate the event. However, the trophy soon  loses its value and is hung or buried at a distance from the village.  Head-hunting for the sake of the trophy itself, does not exist here.    Peace can be effected by means of a blood compact known as _dayandi_.  Each principal cuts his own wrist until the blood flows freely; this he  catches in his free hand and offers to the other participant to drink.  Sometimes the blood of both is caught and mixed in a dish from which  they drink, meanwhile addressing the _tigyama_,[29] saying, \"We are now  like brothers, like children of the same parents, and now we cannot  fight any more. We ask you to be the witnesses.\"    [29] See p. 107. [Transcriber's note: 12 pages later in this document.]    SOCIAL ORGANIZATION.    There seems to be no trace of clan or totemic grouping among the Bagobo.  Blood relationship is traced as far as the second cousin and is a bar to  marriage. The suggestion that a man might marry his mother-in-law was  received with horror, but whether this was due to local mother-in-law  stories or to an idea of relationship could not be ascertained. However,  a man may marry the sister of his wife.    Each district has its head man, or petty _datu_ who is supposed to be  subject to the _datu_ of Cibolan. This seems actually to have been the  case until a few years ago, when some of the local rulers withdrew their  allegiance. The office is hereditary and usually passes from the father  to his eldest son. Should the _datu_ be without an heir, or the son be  considered inefficient, the under chiefs and wise old men may choose a  leader from among their number.    In his own district the power of the _datu_ is very great, but even he  is obliged to respect the laws and customs handed down by the ancestors.  He is supreme judge in all matters, though he may, if he desires, call  in the old men to help him decide difficult cases. The usual method of  punishment is by means of a fine. Should the culprit be unwilling or  unable to pay he is placed in servitude until such a time as the debt is  considered canceled, but should he refuse to serve he is killed without  further ado. The _datu_ appoints a man for this purpose, and he usually  gets his victim by stealth, either by waylaying him in the road or by  driving a spear through him as he lies asleep on the floor of his house.  When a fine is levied the _datu_ retains a portion as pay for his  services; if the more drastic punishment follows it serves to emphasize  his power and is more valuable to him than the payment. When his house  needs repairing, his hemp requires stripping, or his fields need  attention, his followers give him assistance. In return for these  services he helps support a number of fighting men who can always be  called upon for the defence of the people. His house is considered the  property of all to the extent that anyone goes there at any time and  stays as long as he pleases, partaking meanwhile of the _datu's_ food.  In times of danger, or during festivals, all the people assemble there  and assist, in the defense or the merry-making.    Datu Tongkaling is the most industrious man in the tribe.
