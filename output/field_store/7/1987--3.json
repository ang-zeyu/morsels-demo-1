The situation in fact, is not in the  least what he supposed it to be when I started; therefore, I am  justified, I think, in making this appeal:--\"I am very anxious, if  possible, to get a Brigade of Gurkhas, so as to complete the New Zealand  Divisional organisation with a type of man who will, I am certain, be  most valuable on the Gallipoli Peninsula. The scrubby hillsides on the  South-west face of the plateau are just the sort of terrain where those  little fellows are at their brilliant best. There is already a small  Indian commissariat attached to the Mountain Batteries, so there would  be no trouble on the score of supply.\"    \"As you may imagine, I have no wish to ask for anything the giving of  which would seriously weaken our hold on Egypt, but you will remember  that four Mounted Brigades belonging to Birdwood's force are being left  behind to look after the land of the Pharaohs, and a Mounted Brigade for  a battalion seems a fair exchange. Egypt, in fact, so far as I can make  out, seems stiff with troops, and each little Gurkha might be worth his  full weight in gold at Gallipoli.\"    Wrote Fitz in much the same sense:--\"We are desperately keen to extract  a Gurkha Brigade out of Egypt and you might lend a hand, not only to us,  but to all your own Sikh and Dogra Regiments, by making K. see that the  Indian Army was never given a dog's chance in the mudholes. They were  benumbed: _it was not their show_. Here, in the warm sun; pitted against  the hereditary _dushman_[9] who comes on shouting 'Allah!' they would  gain much _izzat_.[10] _Now mind_, if you see any chance of an Indian  contingent for Constantinople, do everyone a good turn by rubbing these  ideas into K.\"    Braithwaite has already picked up a number of useful hints from Roger  Keyes. His old friendship with the Commodore should be a help. Keyes is  a fine fellow; radiating resolve to do and vigour to carry  through--hereditary qualities. His Mother, of whom he is an ugly  likeness, was as high-spirited, fascinating, clever a creature as ever I  saw. Camel riding, hawking, dancing, making good _band-o-bast_ for a  picnic, she was always at the top of the hunt; the idol of the Punjab  Frontier Force. His Father, Sir Charles, grim old Paladin of the  Marshes, whose loss of several fingers from a sword cut earned him my  special boyish veneration, was really the devil of a fellow. My first  flutter out of the sheltered nest of safe England into the outer sphere  of battle, murder and sudden death, took place under the auspices of  that warrior so famoused in fight when I was aged twenty. Riding  together in the early morning from the mud fort of Dera Ismail Khan  towards the Mountain of Sheikh Budin, we suddenly barged into a mob of  wild Waziri tribesmen who jumped out of the ditch and held us up--hand  on bridle. The old General spoke Pushtu fluently, and there was a  parley, begun by him, ordinarily the most silent of mankind. Where were  they going to? To buy camels at Dera Ghazi Khan. How far had they come?  Three days' march; but they had no money. The General simulated  amazement--\"You have come all that distance to buy camels without money?  Those are strange tales you tell me. I fear when you pass through Dera  Ismail you will have to raise the wind by selling your nice pistols and  knives: oh yes, I see them quite well; they are peeping at me from under  your poshteens.\" The Waziris laughed and took their hands off our reins.  Instantly, the General shouted to me, \"Come on--gallop!\" And in less  than no time we were going hell for leather along the lonely frontier  road towards our next relay of horses. \"That was a narrow squeak,\" said  the General, \"but _you may take liberties with a Waziri if only you can  make him laugh_.\"    _26th March, 1915. H.M.8. \"Franconia.\" At Sea._ Inspected troops on  board. A keen, likely looking lot. All Naval Division; living monuments,  these fellows, to Winston Churchill's contempt for convention.    Reached Port Said about 3.30 p.m. Nipped into a \"Special\" which seems to  have become my \"ordinary\" vehicle and left for Cairo. Opened despatches  from London. \"Bullet-proof lighters cannot be provided.\" \"I quite agree  that the 29th Division with its artillery is necessary.\" Not a word  about the Gurkhas. Arrived at 10 p.m., and was met by Maxwell.    _27th March, 1915 Cairo._ Working hard at Headquarters all day till 6.15  p.m., when I made my salaam to the Sultan at the Abdin Palace. A real  Generals' dinner--what we used to call a _burra khana_--at Maxwell's  hospitable board:--      General Birdwood,    General Godley,    General Bridges,    General Douglas,    General Braithwaite,    Myself.    _28th March, 1915. Cairo._ Inspected East Lancashire Division and a  Yeomanry Brigade (Westminster Dragoons and Herts). How I envied Maxwell  these beautiful troops. They will only be eating their heads off here,  with summer coming up and the desert getting as dry as a bone. The  Lancashire men especially are eye-openers. How on earth have they  managed to pick up the swank and devil-may-care airs of crack regulars?  They _are_ Regulars, only they are bigger, more effective specimens than  Manchester mills or East Lancashire mines can spare us for the Regular  Service in peace time. Anyway, no soldier need wish to see a finer lot.  On them has descended the mantle of my old comrades[11] of  Elandslaagte and Caesar's Camp, and worthily beyond doubt they will wear  it.    [Illustration: Lieut.-Gen. the Rt. Hon. Sir J. G. Maxwell, G.C.B.,  K.C.M.G.]    The enthusiasm of the natives was a pleasing part of the show. During  four years of Egyptian Inspections I recall no single instance of any  manifestation of friendliness to our troops, or even of interest in  them, by Gyppies. But the Territorials seem, somehow, to have conquered  their goodwill. As each stalwart company swung past there was a  spontaneous effervescence of waving hands along the crowded street and  murmurs of applause from Bedouins, Blacks and Fellaheen.    Maxwell will have a fit if I ask for them! He will fall down in a fit, I  am sure. Already he is vexed at my having cabled and written Lord K. for  _his_ (Maxwell's) Brigade of Gurkhas. To him I appear careless of his  (Maxwell's) position and of the narrowness of his margin of safety. For  the life of him K. can't help putting his Lieutenants into this  particular cart. The same old story as the eight small columns in the  Western Transvaal: co-equal and each thinking his own beat on the veldt  the only critical spot in South Africa: and the funny thing is that  Maxwell was then running the base at Vryberg and I was in command in the  field! But _there_ my word was law; _here_ Maxwell is entirely  independent of me, which is as much as to say, that the feet are not  under control of the head; i.e., that the expedition must move like a  drunken man. That is my fear: Maxwell will do what lies in him to help,  but in action it is better to order than to ask.    Grand lunch at the Abdin Palace with the Sultan. Most of the Cabinet  present. The Sultan spoke French well and seems clever as well as most  gracious and friendly. He assured me that the Turkish Forts at the  Dardanelles were absolutely impregnable. The words \"absolute\" and  \"impregnable\" don't impress me overmuch. They are only human opinions  used to gloss over flaws in the human knowledge or will. Nothing is  impregnable either--that's a sure thing. No reasons were given me by His  Highness.    Have just written home about these things: midnight.    _29th March, 1915. 9.30 p.m. Palace Hotel, Alexandria._ Early start to  the Mena Camp to see the Australians. A devil of a blinding storm gave a  foretaste of dust to dust. That was when they were marching past, but  afterwards I inspected the Infantry at close quarters, taking a good  look at each man and speaking to hundreds. Many had been at my  inspections in their own country a year ago, but most were new hands who  had never worn uniform till they 'listed for the war. The troops then  marched back to Camp in mass of quarter columns--or rather swept by like  a huge yellow cloud at the heart of which sparkled thousands of  bayonets.    Next I reviewed the Artillery, Engineers and Cavalry; winding up with  the overhaul of the supply and transport column. This took time, and I  had to make the motor travel getting across twelve miles or so to  inspect a mixed Division of Australians and New Zealanders at  Heliopolis. Godley commanded. Great fun seeing him again. These fellows  made a real good show; superb physique: numbers of old friends  especially amongst the New Zealanders. Another scurry in the motor to  catch the 4.15 for Alexandria. Tiring day if I had it in my mind to be  tired, but this 30,000 crowd of Birdwood's would straighten up the back  of a pacifist. There is a bravery in their air--a keenness upon their  clean cut features--they are spoiling for a scrap! Where they have  sprung from it is hard to say. Not in Brisbane, Adelaide, Sydney,  Melbourne or Perth--no, nor in Dunedin, Christchurch, Wellington or  Auckland, did I meet specimens like unto these. The spirit of War has  breathed its fires into their hearts; the drill sergeant has taken  thought and has added one cubit to their stature.    D'Amade has just been to make me known to a couple of Frenchmen about to  join my Staff. They seem to be nice fellows. The French have been here  some days and they are getting on well. Hunter-Weston landed this  morning; his first batch of transports are in the harbour. I am to see  the French troops in four days' time; Hunter-Weston's 29th Division on  the fifth day. Neither Commander has yet worked out how long"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19322"],[0,"The Antichrist (#10)"],[1,"calls that state of human society in which he  himself determines the value of all things \"the kingdom of God\"; he  calls the means whereby that state of affairs is attained \"the will of  God\"; with cold-blooded cynicism he estimates all peoples, all ages and  all individuals by the extent of their subservience or opposition to the  power of the priestly order. One observes him at work: under the hand of  the Jewish priesthood the _great_ age of Israel became an age of  decline; the Exile, with its long series of misfortunes, was  transformed into a _punishment_ for that great age--during which priests  had not yet come into existence. Out of the powerful and _wholly free_  heroes of Israel's history they fashioned, according to their changing  needs, either wretched bigots and hypocrites or men entirely \"godless.\"  They reduced every great event to the idiotic formula: \"obedient _or_  disobedient to God.\"--They went a step further: the \"will of God\" (in  other words some means necessary for preserving the power of the  priests) had to be _determined_--and to this end they had to have a  \"revelation.\" In plain English, a gigantic literary fraud had to be  perpetrated, and \"holy scriptures\" had to be concocted--and so, with the  utmost hierarchical pomp, and days of penance and much lamentation over  the long days of \"sin\" now ended, they were duly published. The \"will of  God,\" it appears, had long stood like a rock; the trouble was that  mankind had neglected the \"holy scriptures\".... But the \"will of God\"  had already been revealed to Moses.... What happened? Simply this: the  priest had formulated, once and for all time and with the strictest  meticulousness, what tithes were to be paid to him, from the largest to  the smallest (--not forgetting the most appetizing cuts of meat, for  the priest is a great consumer of beefsteaks); in brief, he let it be  known just _what he wanted_, what \"the will of God\" was.... From this  time forward things were so arranged that the priest became  _indispensable everywhere_; at all the great natural events of life, at  birth, at marriage, in sickness, at death, not to say at the  \"_sacrifice_\" (that is, at meal-times), the holy parasite put in his  appearance, and proceeded to _denaturize_ it--in his own phrase, to  \"sanctify\" it.... For this should be noted: that every natural habit,  every natural institution (the state, the administration of justice,  marriage, the care of the sick and of the poor), everything demanded by  the life-instinct, in short, everything that has any value _in itself_,  is reduced to absolute worthlessness and even made the _reverse_ of  valuable by the parasitism of priests (or, if you chose, by the \"moral  order of the world\"). The fact requires a sanction--a power to _grant  values_ becomes necessary, and the only way it can create such values is  by denying nature.... The priest depreciates and desecrates nature: it  is only at this price that he can exist at all.--Disobedience to God,  which actually means to the priest, to \"the law,\" now gets the name of  \"sin\"; the means prescribed for \"reconciliation with God\" are, of  course, precisely the means which bring one most effectively under the  thumb of the priest; he alone can \"save\".... Psychologically considered,  \"sins\" are indispensable to every society organized on an ecclesiastical  basis; they are the only reliable weapons of power; the priest _lives_  upon sins; it is necessary to him that there be \"sinning\".... Prime  axiom: \"God forgiveth him that repenteth\"--in plain English, _him that  submitteth to the priest_.      27.    Christianity sprang from a soil so corrupt that on it everything  natural, every natural value, every _reality_ was opposed by the deepest  instincts of the ruling class--it grew up as a sort of war to the death  upon reality, and as such it has never been surpassed. The \"holy  people,\" who had adopted priestly values and priestly names for all  things, and who, with a terrible logical consistency, had rejected  everything of the earth as \"unholy,\" \"worldly,\" \"sinful\"--this people  put its instinct into a final formula that was logical to the point of  self-annihilation: as _Christianity_ it actually denied even the last  form of reality, the \"holy people,\" the \"chosen people,\" _Jewish_  reality itself. The phenomenon is of the first order of importance: the  small insurrectionary movement which took the name of Jesus of Nazareth  is simply the Jewish instinct _redivivus_--in other words, it is the  priestly instinct come to such a pass that it can no longer endure the  priest as a fact; it is the discovery of a state of existence even more  fantastic than any before it, of a vision of life even more _unreal_  than that necessary to an ecclesiastical organization. Christianity  actually _denies_ the church....    I am unable to determine what was the target of the insurrection said to  have been led (whether rightly or _wrongly_) by Jesus, if it was not the  Jewish church--\"church\" being here used in exactly the same sense that  the word has today. It was an insurrection against the \"good and just,\"  against the \"prophets of Israel,\" against the whole hierarchy of  society--_not_ against corruption, but against caste, privilege, order,  formalism. It was _unbelief_ in \"superior men,\" a Nay flung at  everything that priests and theologians stood for. But the hierarchy  that was called into question, if only for an instant, by this movement  was the structure of piles which, above everything, was necessary to the  safety of the Jewish people in the midst of the \"waters\"--it represented  their _last_ possibility of survival; it was the final _residuum_ of  their independent political existence; an attack upon it was an attack  upon the most profound national instinct, the most powerful national  will to live, that has ever appeared on earth. This saintly anarchist,  who aroused the people of the abyss, the outcasts and \"sinners,\" the  Chandala of Judaism, to rise in revolt against the established order of  things--and in language which, if the Gospels are to be credited, would  get him sent to Siberia today--this man was certainly a political  criminal, at least in so far as it was possible to be one in so  _absurdly unpolitical_ a community. This is what brought him to the  cross: the proof thereof is to be found in the inscription that was put  upon the cross. He died for his _own_ sins--there is not the slightest  ground for believing, no matter how often it is asserted, that he died  for the sins of others.--      28.    As to whether he himself was conscious of this contradiction--whether,  in fact, this was the only contradiction he was cognizant of--that is  quite another question. Here, for the first time, I touch upon the  problem of the _psychology of the Saviour_.--I confess, to begin with,  that there are very few books which offer me harder reading than the  Gospels. My difficulties are quite different from those which enabled  the learned curiosity of the German mind to achieve one of its most  unforgettable triumphs. It is a long while since I, like all other young  scholars, enjoyed with all the sapient laboriousness of a fastidious  philologist the work of the incomparable Strauss.[5] At that time I was  twenty years old: now I am too serious for that sort of thing. What do I  care for the contradictions of \"tradition\"? How can any one call pious  legends \"traditions\"? The histories of saints present the most dubious  variety of literature in existence; to examine them by the scientific  method, _in the entire absence of corroborative documents_, seems to me  to condemn the whole inquiry from the start--it is simply learned  idling....    [5] David Friedrich Strauss (1808-74), author of \"Das Leben Jesu\"  (1835-6), a very famous work in its day. Nietzsche here refers to it.      29.    What concerns _me_ is the psychological type of the Saviour. This type  might be depicted in the Gospels, in however mutilated a form and  however much overladen with extraneous characters--that is, in _spite_  of the Gospels; just as the figure of Francis of Assisi shows itself in  his legends in spite of his legends. It is _not_ a question of mere  truthful evidence as to what he did, what he said and how he actually  died; the question is, whether his type is still conceivable, whether it  has been handed down to us.--All the attempts that I know of to read the  _history_ of a \"soul\" in the Gospels seem to me to reveal only a  lamentable psychological levity. M. Renan, that mountebank _in  psychologicus_, has contributed the two most _unseemly_ notions to this  business of explaining the type of Jesus: the notion of the _genius_ and  that of the _hero_ (\"_heros_\"). But if there is anything essentially  unevangelical, it is surely the concept of the hero. What the Gospels  make instinctive is precisely the reverse of all heroic struggle, of  all taste for conflict: the very incapacity for resistance is here  converted into something moral: (\"resist not evil!\"--the most profound  sentence in the Gospels, perhaps the true key to them), to wit, the  blessedness of peace, of gentleness, the _inability_ to be an enemy.  What is the meaning of \"glad tidings\"?--The true life, the life eternal  has been found--it is not merely promised, it is here, it is in _you_;  it is the life that lies in love free from all retreats and exclusions,  from all keeping of distances. Every one is the child of God--Jesus  claims nothing for himself alone--as the child of God each man is the  equal of every other man.... Imagine making Jesus a _hero_!--And what a  tremendous misunderstanding appears in the word \"genius\"! Our whole  conception of the \"spiritual,\" the whole conception of our civilization,  could have had no meaning in the world that Jesus lived in. In the  strict sense of the physiologist, a quite different word ought to be  used here.... We all know that there is a"]]]
