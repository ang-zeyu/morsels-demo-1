The necropolis of the earliest kings of Egypt is situated in the great  bay in the hills which lies behind Abydos, to the southwest of the main  necropolis. Here, at holy Abydos, where every pious Egyptian wished to  rest after death, the bodies of the most ancient kings were buried. It  is said by Manetho that the original seat of their dominion was This,  a town in the vicinity of Abydos, now represented by the modern Grirga,  which lies a few miles distant from its site (el-Birba). This may be a  fact, but we have as yet obtained no confirmation of it. It may well be  that the attribution of a Thinite origin to the Ist and IId Dynasties  was due simply to the fact that the kings of these dynasties were buried  at Abydos, which lay within the Thinite nome. Manetho knew that they  were buried at Abydos, and so jumped to the conclusion that they lived  there also, and called them \"Thinites.\"    [Illustration: 060.jpg PROF. PETRIE'S CAMP AT ABYDOS, 1901.]    Their real place of origin must have been Hierakonpolis, where the  pre-dynastic kingdom of the South had its seat. The Hid Dynasty was no  doubt of Memphite origin, as Manetho says. It is certain that the  seat of the government of the IVth Dynasty was at Memphis, where the  pyramid-building kings were buried, and we know that the sepulchres  of two Hid Dynasty kings, at least, were situated in the necropolis of  Memphis (Sakkara-Medum). So that probably the seat of government was  transferred from Hierakonpolis to Memphis by the first king of the Hid  Dynasty. Thenceforward the kings were buried in the Memphite necropolis.    The two great necropoles of Memphis and Abydos were originally the  seats of the worship of the two Egyptian gods of the dead, Seker and  Khentamenti, both of whom were afterwards identified with the Busirite  god Osiris. Abydos was also the centre of the worship of Anubis, an  animal-deity of the dead, the jackal who prowls round the tombs at  night. Anubis and Osiris-Khentamenti, \"He who is in the West,\" were  associated in the minds of the Egyptians as the protecting deities of  Abydos. The worship of these gods as the chief Southern deities of the  dead, and the preeminence of the necropolis of Abydos in the South, no  doubt date back before the time of the Ist Dynasty, so that it would  not surprise us were burials of kings of the predynastic Hierakonpolite  kingdom discovered at Abydos. Prof. Petrie indeed claims to have  discovered actual royal relics of that period at Abydos, but this seems  to be one of the least certain of his conclusions. We cannot definitely  state that the names \"Ro,\" \"Ka,\" and \"Sma\" (if they are names at all,  which is doubtful) belong to early kings of Hierakonpolis who were  buried at Abydos. It may be so, but further confirmation is desirable  before we accept it as a fact; and as yet such confirmation has not been  forthcoming. The oldest kings, who were certainly buried at Abydos, seem  to have been the first rulers of the united kingdom of the North and  South, Aha and his successors. N'armer is not represented. It may  be that he was not buried at Abydos, but in the necropolis of  Hierakonpolis. This would point to the kings of the South not having  been buried at Abydos until after the unification of the kingdom.    That Aha possessed a tomb at Abydos as well as another at Nakada seems  peculiar, but it is a phenomenon not unknown in Egypt. Several kings,  whose bodies were actually buried elsewhere, had second tombs at Abydos,  in order that they might _possess_ last resting-places near the tomb  of Osiris, although they might not prefer to _use_ them. Usertsen (or  Senusret) III is a case in point. He was really buried in a pyramid at  Illahun, up in the North, but he had a great rock tomb cut for him in  the cliffs at Abydos, which he never occupied, and probably had never  intended to occupy. We find exactly the same thing far back at the  beginning of Egyptian history, when Aha possessed not only a great  mastaba-tomb at Nakada, but also a tomb-chamber in the great necropolis  of Abydos. It may be that other kings of the earliest period also had  second sepulchres elsewhere. It is noteworthy that in none of the early  tombs at Abydos were found any bodies which might be considered those  of the kings themselves. M. Amelineau discovered bodies of attendants  or slaves (who were in all probability purposely strangled and buried  around the royal chamber in order that they should attend the king  in the next world), but no royalties. Prof. Petrie found the arm of a  female mummy, who may have been of royal blood, though there is nothing  to show that she was. And the quaint plait and fringe of false hair,  which were also found, need not have belonged to a royal mummy. It is  therefore quite possible that these tombs at Abydos were not the actual  last resting-places of the earliest kings, who may really have been  buried at Hierakonpolis or elsewhere, as Aha was. Messrs. Newberry  and Gtarstang, in their _Short History of Egypt_, suppose that Aha was  actually buried at Abydos, and that the great tomb with objects bearing  his name, found by M. de Morgan at Nakada, is really not his, but  belonged to a royal princess named Neit-hetep, whose name is found in  conjunction with his at Abydos and Nakada. But the argument is equally  valid turned round the other way: the Nakada tomb might just as well be  Aha's and the Abydos one Neit-hetep's. Neit-hetep, who is supposed by  Messrs. Newberry and Garstang to have been Narmer's daughter and Aha's  wife, was evidently closely connected with Aha, and she may have been  buried with him at Nakada and commemorated with him at Abydos.* It is  probable that the XIXth Dynasty list-makers and Manetho considered the  Abydos tombs to have been the real graves of the kings, but it is by no  means impossible that they were wrong.         * A princess named Bener-ab (\"Sweet-heart\"), who may have       been Aha's daughter, was actually buried beside his tomb at       Abydos.    This view of the royal tombs at Abydos tallies to a great extent with  that of M. Naville, who has energetically maintained the view that M.  Amelineau and Prof. Petrie have not discovered the real tombs of the  early kings, but only their contemporary commemorative \"tombs\" at  Abydos. The only real tomb of the Ist Dynasty, therefore, as yet  discovered is that of Aha at Nakada, found by M. de Morgan. The fact  that attendant slaves were buried around the Abydos tombs is no bar to  the view that the tombs were only the monuments, not the real graves,  of the kings. The royal ghosts would naturally visit their commemorative  chambers at Abydos, in order to be in the company of the great Osiris,  and ghostly servants would be as necessary to their Majesties at Abydos  as elsewhere.    It must not be thought that this revised opinion of the Abydos tombs  detracts in the slightest degree from the importance of the discovery of  M. Amelineau and its subsequent and more detailed investigation by Prof.  Petrie. These monuments are as valuable for historical purposes as  the real tombs themselves. The actual bodies of these primeval kings  themselves we are never likely to find. The tomb of Aha at Nakada had  been completely rifled in ancient times.    The commemorative tombs of the kings of the Ist and IId Dynasties at  Abydos lie southwest of the great necropolis, far within the bay in the  hills. Their present aspect is that of a wilderness of sand hillocks,  covered with masses of fragments of red pottery, from which the site has  obtained the modern Arab name of _Umm el-Ga'ab_, \"Mother of Pots.\" It  is impossible to move a step in any direction without crushing some  of these potsherds under the heel. They are chiefly the remains of the  countless little vases of rough red pottery, which were dedicated here  as _ex-votos_ by the pious, between the XIXth and XXVIth Dynasties, to  the memory of the ancient kings and of the great god Osiris, whose tomb,  as we shall see, was supposed to have been situated here also.    [Illustration: 065.jpg (right) THE TOMB OF KING DEN AT ABYDOS. About  4000 B.C.]    Intermingled with these later fragments are pieces of the original  Ist Dynasty vases, which were filled with wine and provisions and were  placed in the tombs, for the refreshment and delectation of the royal  ghosts when they should visit their houses at Abydos. These were thrown  out and broken when the tombs were violated. Here and there one sees a  dip in the sand, out of which rise four walls of great bricks, forming  a rectangular chamber, half-filled with sand. This is one of the royal  tomb-chambers of the Ist Dynasty. That of King Den is illustrated above.  A straight staircase descends into it from the ground-level above. In  several of the tombs the original flooring of wooden beams is still  preserved. Den's is the most magnificent of all, for it has a floor of  granite blocks; we know of no other instance of stone being used for  building in this early age. Almost every tomb has been burnt at some  period unknown. The brick walls are burnt red, and many of the alabaster  vases are almost calcined. This was probably the work of some unknown  enemy.    The wide complicated tombs have around the main chamber a series of  smaller rooms, which were used to store what was considered necessary  for the use of the royal ghost. Of these necessaries the most  interesting to us are the slaves, who were, as there is little reason to  doubt, purposely killed and buried round the royal chamber so that their  spirits should be on the spot when the dead king came to Abydos; thus  they would be always ready to serve him with the food and other things  which had been stored in the tomb with them and placed under their  charge. There were stacks of great vases of wine, corn, and other food;  these were covered up with masses of fat to preserve the contents,  and they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17322"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 2 (of 12) (#10)"],[1,"in the town of       Abydos, and not _employes_ attached to the exchequer of       Pharaoh or of the ruler of Thinis.    It would be difficult to enumerate the number of store-chambers in  the outbuildings of the \"Storehouse of Provisions\"--store-chambers for  butcher's meat, for fruits, for beer, bread, and wine, in which were  deposited as much of each article of food as would be required by the  court for some days, or at most for a few weeks. They were brought there  from the larger storehouses, the wines from vaults, the oxen from their  stalls, the corn from the granaries. The latter were vast brick-built  receptacles, ten or more in a row, circular in shape and surmounted by  cupolas, but having no communication with each other. They had only two  openings, one at the top for pouring in the grain, another on the ground  level for drawing it out; a notice posted up outside, often on the  shutter which closed the chamber, indicated the character and quantity  of the cereals within. For the security and management of these, there  were employed troops of porters, store-keepers, accountants, \"primates\"  who superintended the works, record-keepers, and directors. Great nobles  coveted the administration of the \"storehouses,\" and even the sons  of kings did not think it derogatory to their dignity to be entitled  \"Directors of the Granaries,\" or \"Directors of the Armoury.\" There was  no law against pluralists, and more than one of them boasts on his tomb  of having held simultaneously five or six offices. These storehouses  participated like all the other dependencies of the crown, in that  duality which characterized the person of the Pharaoh. They would  be called in common parlance, the Storehouse or the Double White  Storehouse, the Storehouse or the Double Gold Storehouse, the Double  Warehouse, the Double Granary.    [Illustration: 061.jpg MEASURING THE WHEAT AND DEPOSITING IT IN THE  GRANARIES]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a scene on the tomb of Amoni at       Beni-Hasan. On the right, near the door, is a heap of grain,       from which the measurer fills his measure in order to empty       it into the sack which one of the porters holds open. In the       centre is a train of slaves ascending the stairs which lead       to the loft above the granaries; one of them empties his       sack into a hole above the granary in the presence of the       overseer. The inscriptions in ink on the outer wall of the       receptacles, which have already been filled, indicate the       number of measures which each one of them contains.    The large towns, as well as the capital, possessed their double  storehouses and their store-chambers, into which were gathered the  products of the neighbourhood, but where a complete staff of employes  was not always required: in such towns we meet with \"localities\"  in which the commodities were housed merely temporarily. The least  perishable part of the provincial dues was forwarded by boat to the  royal residence,* and swelled the central treasury.         * The boats employed for this purpose formed a flotilla, and       their commanders constituted a regularly organized transport       corps, who are frequently to be found represented on the       monuments of the New Empire, carrying tribute to the       residence of the king or of the prince, whose retainers they       were.    The remainder was used on the spot for paying workman's wages, and for  the needs of the Administration. We see from the inscriptions, that  the staffs of officials who administered affairs in the provinces was  similar to that in the royal city. Starting from the top, and going down  to the bottom of the scale, each functionary supervised those beneath  him, while, as a body, they were all responsible for their depot. Any  irregularity in the entries entailed the bastinado; peculators were  punished by imprisonment, mutilation, or death, according to the gravity  of the offence. Those whom illness or old age rendered unfit for work,  were pensioned for the remainder of their life.    [Illustration: 063.jpg PLAN OF A PRINCELY STOREHOUSE FOR PROVISIONS]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from Lepsius, _Denkm_., iii. 95. The       illustration is taken from one of the tombs at Tel el-       Amarna. The storehouse consists of four blocks, isolated by       two avenues planted with trees, which intersect each other       in the form of a cross. Behind the entrance gate, in a small       courtyard, is a kiosque, in which the master sat for the       purpose of receiving the stores or of superintending their       distribution; two arms of the cross are lined by porticoes,       under which are the entrances to the \"chambers\" (dit) for       the stores, which are filled with jars of wine, linen-       chests, dried fish, and other articles.    The writer, or, as we call him, the scribe, was the mainspring of  all this machinery. We come across him in all grades of the staff: an  insignificant registrar of oxen, a clerk of the Double White Storehouse,  ragged, humble, and badly paid, was a scribe just as much as the noble,  the priest, or the king's son. Thus the title of scribe was of no value  in itself, and did not designate, as one might naturally think, a savant  educated in a school of high culture, or a man of the world, versed in  the sciences and the literature of his time; El-kab was a scribe who  knew how to read, write, and cipher, was fairly proficient in wording  the administrative formulas, and could easily apply the elementary rules  of book-keeping. There was no public school in which the scribe could be  prepared for his future career; but as soon as a child had acquired the  first rudiments of letters with some old pedagogue, his father took him  with him to his office, or entrusted him to some friend who agreed to  undertake his education. The apprentice observed what went on around  him, imitated the mode of procedure of the _employes_, copied in his  spare time old papers, letters, bills, flowerily-worded petitions,  reports, complimentary addresses to his superiors or to the Pharaoh, all  of which his patron examined and corrected, noting on the margin letters  or words imperfectly written, improving the style, and recasting or  completing the incorrect expressions.* As soon as he could put together  a certain number of sentences or figures without a mistake, he was  allowed to draw up bills, or to have the sole superintendence of some  department of the treasury, his work being gradually increased in amount  and difficulty; when he was considered to be sufficiently _au courant_  with the ordinary business, his education was declared to be finished,  and a situation was found for him either in the place where he had begun  his probation, or in some neighbouring office.**         * We still possess school exercises of the XIXth and XXth       dynasties, e.g. the _Papyrus Anastasi n IV_., and the       _Anastasi Papyrus n V._, in which we find a whole string of       pieces of every possible style and description--business       letters, requests for leave of absence, complimentary verses       addressed to a superior, all probably a collection of       exercises compiled by some professor, and copied by his       pupils in order to complete their education as scribes; the       master's corrections are made at the top and bottom of the       pages in a bold and skilful hand, very different from that       of the pupil, though the writing of the latter is generally       more legible to our modern eyes (_Select Papyri,_ vol. i.       pls. lxxxiii.-cxxi.).         ** Evidence of this state of things seems to be furnished by       all the biographies of scribes with which we are acquainted,       e.g. that of Amten; it is, moreover, what took place       regularly throughout the whole of Egypt, down to the latest       times, and what probably still occurs in those parts of the       country where European ideas have not yet made any deep       impression.

Two scribes are writing on tablets. Before the       scribe in the upper part of the picture we see a palette,       with two saucers, on a vessel which serves as an ink-bottle,       and a packet of tablets tied together, the whole supported       by a bundle of archives. The scribe in the lower part rests       his tablet against an ink-bottle, a box for archives being       placed before him. Behind them a _nakht-khrou_ announces the       delivery of a tablet covered with figures which the third       scribe is presenting to the master.

Four registrars of the funerary temple of       Usirniri advance in a crawling posture towards the master,       the fifth has just risen and holds himself in a stooping       attitude, while an usher introduces him and transmits to him       an order to send in his accounts.    Thus equipped, the young man ended usually by succeeding his father or  his patron: in most of the government administrations, we find whole  dynasties of scribes on a small scale, whose members inherited the same  post for several centuries. The position was an insignificant one, and  the salary poor, but the means of existence were assured, the occupant  was exempted from forced labour and from military service, and he  exercised a certain authority in the narrow world in which he lived; it  sufficed to make him think himself happy, and in fact to be so. \"One has  only to be a scribe,\" said the wise man, \"for the scribe takes the lead  of all.\" Sometimes, however, one of these contented officials, more  intelligent or ambitious"]]]
