In this  extraordinary festival which marked the close of Harsha's reign the  picture left to us is singularly complete. The first day is a sort of  farewell tribute to the waning glory of Buddha, and the second to the  ancient majesty of the Vedic gods; but they only prepare the way for the  culminating worship, on the third day, of the terrific figure of Shiva,  who had already been raised to one of the highest, if not the highest,  throne in the Hindu pantheon, which he still retains--Shiva, the master  of life and death, whose favourite emblem is the phallus, and from whose  third eye bursts forth the flame which is one day to consume the world.  Around Harsha, and devouring his gifts until, at the end of two months,  they are wholly exhausted, are the Brahmans, \"born above the world,  assigned to guard the treasury of duties, civil and religious,\" through  whom alone the wrath of angry gods can be appeased and present and  future life be made safe in the descending hierarchy of caste.    Shortly after Harsha's death in A.D. 648, India, as is her wont as soon  as the strong man's arm is paralysed, relapses once more into political  chaos. Her history does not indeed ever again recede into the complete  obscurity of earlier ages. We get glimpses of successive kingdoms and  dynasties rising and again falling in Southern India, as the Hindu  Aryans gradually permeate and subdue the older Dravidian races and  absorb the greater part of them, not without being in turn influenced by  them, into their own religious and social system. The most notable  feature of the post-Harsha period of Hindu history is the emergence of  the Rajput states, whose rulers, though probably descendants of  relatively recent invaders, not only became rapidly Hinduised, but  secured relatively prompt admission to the rank of Kshatryas in the  Hindu caste system, with pedigrees dated back to the Sun and Moon, which  to the popular mind were well justified by their warlike prowess and  splendid chivalry. I need only recall the name of Prithvi-Raja, the lord  of Sambhar, Delhi, and Ajmer, whose epic fame rests not less on his  abduction of the Kanauj princess who loved him than on his gallant  losing fight against the Mahomedan invaders of India. But fierce clan  jealousies and intense dynastic pride made the Rajputs incapable of  uniting into a single paramount state, or even into an enduring  confederacy fit to withstand the storm of which Harsha himself might  have heard the distant rumblings. For it was during his reign that  militant Islam first set foot in India, in a remote part of the  peninsula. Just at the same time as the Arabs, in the first flush of  victory, poured into Egypt, a small force crossed the Arabian Sea and  entered Baluchistan, and a century later the whole of Sind passed into  Arab hands. Another two centuries and the Mahomedan flood was pouring  irresistibly into India, no longer across the Arabian Sea, but from  Central Asia through the great northern passes, until in successive  waves it submerged for a time almost the whole of India.    Now if we look back upon the fifteen centuries of Indian history, of  which I have sought to reconstitute the chief landmarks before the  Mahomedan invasions, the two salient features that emerge from the  twilight are the failure of the Aryan Hindus to achieve any permanent  form of political unity or stability, and their success, on the other  hand, in building up on adamantine foundations a complex but vital  social system. The supple and subtle forces of Hinduism had already in  prehistoric times welded together the discordant beliefs and customs of  a vast variety of races into a comprehensive fabric sufficiently elastic  to shelter most of the indigenous populations of India, and sufficiently  rigid to secure the Aryan Hindu ascendancy. Of its marvellous tenacity  and powers of resorption there can be no greater proof than the  elimination of Buddhism from India, where, in spite of its tremendous  uplift in the days of Asoka and the intermittent favours it enjoyed  under later and lesser monarchs, it was already moribund before the  Mahomedans gave it its final deathblow. Jainism, contemporary and  closely akin to Buddhism, never rose to the same pre-eminence, and  perhaps for that very reason secured a longer though more obscure lease  of life, and still survives as a respectable but numerically quite  unimportant sect. But indomitably powerful as a social amalgam, Hinduism  failed to generate any politically constructive force that could endure  much beyond the lifetime of some exceptionally gifted conqueror. The  Mauryan and the Gupta dynasties succumbed as irretrievably to the  centrifugal forces of petty states and clans perpetually striving for  mastery as the more ephemeral kingdoms of Kanishka and Harsha. They all  in turn crumbled away, and, in a land of many races and languages and  climates, split up into many states and groups of states constantly at  strife and constantly changing masters and frontiers. Hinduism alone  always survived with its crowded and ever-expanding pantheon of gods and  goddesses for the multitude, with its subtle and elastic philosophies  for the elect, with the doctrine of infinite reincarnations for all,  and, bound up with it, the iron law of caste.    The caste system, though it may be slowly yielding in non-essentials to  the exigencies of modern life, is still vigorous to-day in all its  essential features, and cannot easily be extruded from their family life  even by the Western-educated classes. It divides up Indian society into  thousands of water-tight compartments within which the Hindu is born and  lives and dies without any possibility of emerging from the one to which  he has been predestined by his own deeds in his former lives. Each caste  forms a group, of which the relations within its own circle, as well as  with other groups, are governed by the most rigid laws--in no  connection more rigid than in regard to marriage. These groups are of  many different types; some are of the tribal type, some national, some  sectarian, some have been formed by migration, some are based upon a  common social function or occupation past or present, some on  peculiarities of religious beliefs and superstitions. A distinguished  French writer, M. Senart, has described a caste as a close corporation,  in theory at any rate rigorously hereditary, equipped with a certain  traditional and independent organisation, observing certain common  usages, more particularly as to marriage, food, and questions of  ceremonial pollution, and ruling its members by the sanction of certain  penalties of which the most signal is the sentence of irrevocable  exclusion or out-casting. The Census of 1901 was the first to attempt a  thorough classification of Indian castes, and the number of the main  castes enumerated in it is well over two thousand, each one divided up  again into almost endless sub-castes. The keystone of the whole caste  system is the supremacy of the _quasi_-sacerdotal caste of Brahmans--a  caste which constitutes in some respects the proudest and closest  aristocracy that the world has ever seen, since it is not merely an  aristocracy of birth in the strictest sense of the term, but one of  divine origin. An Indian is either born a Brahman or he is not. No power  on earth can make him a Brahman. Not all Brahmans were learned even in  the old days of Hinduism, though it was to their monopoly of such  learning as there then was that they owed their ascendancy over the  warrior kings. Nor do all Brahmans minister in the temples. Strangely  enough the minority who do are looked down upon by their own castemen.  The majority pursue such worldly avocations, often quite humble, as are  permissible for them under their caste laws. The Brahmans were wise  enough, too, to temper the fundamental rigidity of the system with  sufficient elasticity to absorb the new elements with which it came into  contact, and in most cases gradually to reabsorb such elements as from  time to time rebelled against it. The process by which new castes may be  admitted into the pale of Hinduism, or the status of existing castes be  from time to time readjusted to new conditions, has been admirably  explained by Sir Alfred Lyall. But the process can be worked only under  Brahmanical authority, and the supreme sanction for all caste laws rests  solely with the Brahmans, whilst of all caste laws the most inexorable  is the supremacy of the Brahman. Therein lies the secret of the great  influence which, for good as well as for evil, he has always wielded  over the masses. For though in theory there could be no escape from the  bondage of caste, individuals, and even a whole group, would sometimes  find ways and means of propitiating the Brahmans who ministered to their  spiritual needs, and the miraculous intervention of a favouring god or  the discovery of a long-lost but entirely mythical ancestor would secure  their social uplift on to a higher rung of the caste-ladder.    Such a system, by creating and perpetuating arbitrary and yet almost  impassable lines of social cleavage, must be fatal to the development of  a robust body politic which can only be produced by the reasonable  intermingling and healthy fusion of the different classes of the  community. It was perhaps chief among the causes that left Hinduism with  so little force of organised political cohesion that the Hindu states of  ancient India, with their superior culture and civilisation, were sooner  or later swept away by the devastating flood of Mahomedan conquest,  whilst the social structure of Hinduism, just because it consisted of  such an infinity of water-tight compartments each vital and  self-sufficing, could be buffeted again and again and even almost  submerged by the waves"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15604"],[0,"Piano Mastery: Talks with Master Pianists and Teachers (#10)"],[1," than four hours a day; it seems to me  that amount is sufficient, if used with absolute concentration.\"    Later we adjourned to the pretty garden back of the music-room, and here  we were joined by a beautiful gray Angora cat, the pet and pride of his  mistress, and a very important personage indeed. He has a trick of  climbing to Miss Goodson's shoulder, from which point of vantage he  surveys the world about him with all the complaisance of which an animal  of such high degree is capable.          XI    MARK HAMBOURG    FORM, TECHNIC, AND EXPRESSION      [Illustration: MARK HAMBOURG]    In one of the most quiet, secluded quarters of London can be found the  home of the Russian pianist, Mark Hambourg. Mr. Hambourg lives on a  terrace, \"far from the madding crowd,\" and difficult enough of access to  keep mere curiosity seekers at a distance. One can scarcely picture to  one's self, without an actual sight of them, the quaint charm of these  short passages or streets, usually termed \"terraces,\" or \"gardens.\" This  particular terrace looks out on a restful green park, where luxuriant  trees make long shadows on the sunlit turf. The house is large and  comfortable--built over a hundred years ago; its rooms are spacious, and  the drawing-room and library, which lead one into the other, form a fine  music salon. Surely, amid such surroundings, with priceless pictures and  _objets d'art_ all about, with exquisite colors, with space and quiet,  an artist must find an ideal spot for both work and play. I expressed  this thought to Mr. Hambourg when he entered; then we soon fell to  discussing the necessary equipment of the teacher and pianist.    \"I agree with you,\" he said, \"that it is the beginning of piano study  which is the most difficult of all; this is where the teacher has such  great responsibility and where so many teachers are so incompetent.  Perhaps there are more poor teachers for the piano than for the voice.  The organs of voice production cannot be seen, they can only be guessed  at; so there may be a little more excuse for the vocal teacher; but for  the piano we have the keys and the fingers. It should not therefore be  such a very difficult thing to learn to play intelligently and  correctly! Yet few seem to have got hold of the right principles or know  how to impart them.\"    \"I have heard a number of the young pianists here,\" I remarked, \"and  they all play with very little finger action--with fingers close to the  keys. Do you advocate this?\"      LOW HAND POSITION    \"Do not forget that for centuries England has been a country of  organists; without doubt organ playing has had some effect on the piano  touch. Some schools of piano playing advise lifting the fingers high  above the keys, with a view to producing greater power; but I think the  tone thus produced is often of a somewhat harsh and disagreeable  quality. Then, too, high lifting interferes with smoothness and  velocity. For myself I advocate keeping the fingers close to the  keyboard, and pressing the keys, which gives the tone a warmer and more  elastic quality.\"    \"A point in hand position I should like to ask you about. Some teachers  advise placing the finger-tips close to the edge of the keys, forming a  straight line with them; it seems to me such a position is forced and  unnatural.\"    Mr. Hambourg smiled assent.    \"I do not advocate anything forced and unnatural,\" he answered. \"So many  people think that a beautiful touch is 'born, not made,' but I do not  agree with them. One can acquire, I am sure, a fine piano touch with the  proper study. The principal requirement is, first of all, a loose wrist.  This point seems simple enough, but it is a point not sufficiently  considered nor understood. No matter how much the player may _feel_ the  meaning of the music, he cannot express this meaning with stiff wrists  and arms. Some people have a natural flexibility, and to such the  securing of a musical tone presents far less difficulty; but with time,  patience, and thought, I fully believe all can arrive at this goal.      AMOUNT OF PRACTISE    \"In regard to practise I do not think it wise for the aspiring pianist  to spend such a great amount of time at the piano. Four hours of  concentrated work daily seems to me sufficient. Of course it is the  quality of practise that counts. The old saying, 'Practise makes  perfect,' does not mean constant repetition merely, but constant  thinking and listening. I advise students to stop after playing a  passage several times, and think over what the notes mean. This pause  will rest ears and hands; in a few moments work can be resumed with  fresh vigor.    \"I have been so frequently asked to write on the subject of technic that  I have done so in a few articles which have been printed in a small  booklet. From these you may see what my ideas are on these points. I do  very little teaching myself--just a few talented pupils; they must be  something out of the ordinary. You see, I do not live in London  continuously; I am here only about four months of the year; the rest of  the time is spent traveling all over the world. Only that small part of  the year when I am stationary can I do any solid work. Here it is  generally quiet enough: the Zoological Garden is not far away, however,  and sometimes I have the roaring of the lions as an accompaniment to my  piano.    \"I am always increasing my repertoire, though I find the public does not  care for new things; it prefers the old. It may listen to the new if  forced to, but it will not attend a recital unless various familiar  things are on the program.    \"I have made several tours in America. The rush of travel from place to  place over there, is fatiguing, but I feel that your people are very  appreciative. You demand the best, and concert giving in America is so  costly that a manager can afford to exploit only the highest artists.  Here in London, where the expense is only about two hundred dollars,  say, to get up a recital, almost any one can scrape together that sum  and bring himself or herself before the public. In America the outlay is  four or five times greater. No wonder that only a very good artist can  take the risk.\"    On leaving, Mr. Hambourg took us to another room, where he showed us  with much satisfaction, a very valuable painting of the old Italian  school, by Ghirlandajo, of which he is very fond.          XII    TOBIAS MATTHAY    WATCHING THE ARTIST TEACHER AT WORK      One of the first things accomplished after my arrival in London was to  seek out Tobias Matthay, the composer and teacher, for an echo of his  fame had reached me across the water.    Matthay has done much to make the principles of piano technic so clear  and simple that even a child can understand them. If he has stated facts  in a way which seems to some revolutionary it is because these facts are  seldom understood by the rank and file of piano teachers. The work he  has done has compelled attention and admiration; his ideas are now  accepted as undeniable truths by those who at first repudiated them. The  writings of Mr. Matthay will doubtless be better known in America a  little later on than they are at present. They consist in part of an  exhaustive work on _The Act of Touch in all its Diversity; First  Principles of Piano Playing; Relaxation Studies; The Child's First Steps  in Piano Playing; The Principles of Fingering and Laws of Pedaling;  Forearm Rotation Principle;_ and, in press, _The Principles of Teaching  Interpretation_. These very titles are inspiring and suggestive, and  show Matthay to be a deep thinker along educational lines.    [Illustration: Cordially Yours, Tobias Matthay]    Matthay's activities are enormous. He is professor of advanced piano  playing at the Royal Academy of Music; also founder and head of his own  school of piano playing. So occupied early and late is he, that it is  almost impossible to get a word with him. I was fortunate enough,  however, to obtain an hour's audience, and also permission to attend  various private classes at the Royal Academy, and hear a number of  pupils in recital.    In appearance Matthay is a striking personality. His head and features  recall pictures of Robert Louis Stevenson. His tall, muscular form has  the stoop of the scholar; and little wonder when one remembers he must  sit in his chair at work day in and day out. His somewhat brusk manner  melts into kind amiability when discussing the topics in which he is  vitally interested. In his intercourse with students he is ever kind,  sympathetic and encouraging. They, on their part, treat him with  profound respect.    Matthay believes, and rightly, that the beginning pupil should learn  essentials of note values, rhythm, time, ear-training and so on, before  attempting to play anything at the piano. When first taken to the  instrument, its mechanism is carefully explained to the learner, and  what he must do to make a really musical tone. He says _(Child's First  Steps)_: \"Before you take the very first step in tone production, be  sure to understand that you must never touch the piano without trying to  make music. It is only too easy to sound notes without making music at  all. To make music we must make all the sounds mean something, just as  it is no use to pretend to speak unless the sounds we make with our lips  mean something, that is unless they form reasoned phrases and  sentences.\"    Here nothing is left vague. Matthay shows clearly how all musical Form  and Shape imply Movement and Progression: the movement of a phrase  toward its cadence; the movement of a group of notes toward a beat or  pulse ahead, or the movement of a whole piece toward its climax, etc.  This original view of his regarding form, which he has advocated for  the last twenty years, is now being accepted generally by the more  up-to-date of the English theorists and teachers.    In regard to key mechanism and what must be done to produce all"]]]
