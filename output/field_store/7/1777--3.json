Kumagara, Lapicque and Breis-acher, have, as the result of their  experiments, reduced the quantity of proteid required per 24 hours to 45  grammes. T. Hirschfeld states, as the conclusion of his research, that it  is possible for a healthy man (in one case for 15 days and in another for  10 days) to maintain nitrogenous balance on from 30 to 40 grammes of  proteid per day. Labbe and Morchoisne (Comptes Rendus, 30th May, 1904, p.  1365) made a dieting experiment during 38 days, upon one of themselves.  The proteid was derived exclusively from vegetable food. The food  consisted of bread, lentils, haricots, potatoes, carrots, chestnuts,  endives, apples, oranges, preserves, sugar, starch, butter, chocolate and  wine. At the commencement, the day's food contained 14.1 grammes of  nitrogen = 89.3 proteid, which was gradually diminished. On the 7th day  11.6 g. N. = 73.5 g. proteid was reached; during this time less N. was  eliminated, indicating that the proteid food was in excess of that  required for the wear and tear of the body. As the quantity of nitrogenous  food was diminished almost daily, the N. eliminated was found to diminish  also. This latter was in slight excess of that absorbed; but when a day or  two's time was allowed, without further reduction in the food, the body  tended to adjust itself to the dimished supply, and there was an  approximation of income and expenditure. The smallest quantity of food was  reached on the 32nd day with 1.06 N. = 6.7 proteid, which was obviously  too little, as 2.19 N. = 13.9 proteid was eliminated. On the 21st day 4.12  N. = 26 proteid was injested, and 4.05 N. was eliminated. The inference  drawn from the research is that about 26 grammes of proteid per day was  sufficient. The weight of the body remained practically constant  throughout, and the subject did not suffer inconvenience. Of course the  full amount of calories was kept up; as each succeeding quantity of the  proteid was left off, it was replaced by a proper quantity of  non-nitrogenous food. These experiments were carried out in the usual  approved scientific manner. It may, however, be urged against any  generalised and positive conclusions as to the minimum quantity of proteid  required for the body, being drawn from such experiments, that the period  covered by them was much too short. A prolonged trial might have revealed  some obscure physiological derangement. We are quite justified in  concluding that the usual, so-called \"standard dietaries\" contain an  unnecessarily large proportion of proteid. In some practical dietaries, 50  grammes and under have seemed enough; but for the ordinary adult man, who  has been accustomed to an abundance of proteid, and whose ancestors have  also, it is probably advisable not to take less than 70 or 80 grammes per  day (2-1/2 to 3 ounces). If it is desired to try less, the diminution  should be very gradual, and a watch should be kept for any lessening of  strength.    Some comments may now be made upon the table of dietaries. That of the  London sewing girl contained 53 grammes of proteid, which should have been  ample, according to some of the authorities we have given; yet she was  badly nourished. The food was doubtless of bad quality, and it appears  deficient in carbo-hydrates; this latter is shown by the low number of  calories. The long hours and unhealthy conditions of work, and not a  deficiency of food constituents, is probably the cause of the bad health  of such persons. There is no reason to think the proteid insufficient,  although some persons have said as much. We have no particulars of the  German vegetarians, but the calories appear satisfactory. In the poor  German labourer's family the calories are too low. In Dr. T.R. Allinson's  experiment on a wheatmeal dietary, it will not do to assume that less than  82 grammes of proteid would have been insufficient. It is probable that a  smaller quantity of proteid would have been enough if the fat and  carbohydrates had been increased. The calories are below the usual  standard. In the succeeding example the calories are considerably higher,  being not far from the usual standard, yet 54 grammes of proteid sufficed.  It is a common error to place an undue value on the proteids to the extent  of overlooking the other constituents. Dr. Alexander Haig in \"Diet and  Food,\" p. 8, cites the case of a boy aged 10, fed on 2-1/4 pints of milk  per day. The boy lost weight, and Dr. Haig is of opinion that the quantity  of milk was very deficient in proteid; more than twice as much being  required. 2-1/4 pints of milk contain about 45 grammes of proteid,  whereas, according to the usual figures (125 x 6/10) a boy of this age  requires 75 g. This quantity of 45 g. is however, higher, allowing for the  boy's age, than that in several of the dietaries we have given in our  table. A little consideration will show that Dr. Haig has overlooked the  serious deficiency of the milk in the other constituents, which accounts  for the boy's loss of weight. The quantity of milk contains only about 160  g. of total solid matter, whilst 400 g. is the necessary quantity. Milk is  too rich in proteid matter to form, with advantage, the sole food of a  human being. Human milk contains much less in proportion to the other  constituents.    The old doctrine enunciated by Justus von Liebig was that proteid matter  is the principal source of muscular energy or strength. He afterwards  discovered and acknowledged his error, and the subject has since been  thoroughly investigated. The makers of meat extracts and other foods,  either from their own ignorance of modern research or their wish to take  advantage of the lack of knowledge and prejudice of the public, call  proteid matter alone nourishment. The carbo-hydrates and fats are equally  entitled to be called nourishment.    Our reason for devoting so much space to the consideration of the quantity  of proteid matter required, is that in the opinion of many eminent writers  it is the crux of vegetarianism. They have stated that it is impossible to  obtain sufficient from vegetable foods alone, without consuming an  excessive quantity of carbo-hydrates. We will summarise the argument as  given in Kirke's Physiology, as edited by Morrant Baker, a standard work,  and which is repeated in Furneaux's \"Animal Physiology,\" a book which is  much used in elementary science schools: \"The daily waste from the system  amounts to, carbon 4,500 grains (or 300 grammes), and nitrogen, 300 grains  (or 20 grammes). Now let us suppose a person to feed on bread only. In  order to obtain the necessary quantity of nitrogen to repair this waste  he would have to eat nearly 4-1/4 lbs. daily.... He would be compelled to  take about double the quantity of carbon required in order to obtain the  necessary weight of nitrogen.... Next, let us suppose that he feeds on  lean meat only. Then, in order to obtain the necessary quantity of carbon,  he must eat no less than 6-1/2 lbs. daily.... In this case we notice a  similar waste of nitrogen, the removal of which would give an undue amount  of work to the organs concerned.... But it is possible to take such a  mixed diet of bread and meat as will supply all the requirements of the  system, and at the same time yield but little waste material.\" (These  extracts are from Furneaux, the next is from Kirke. The figures and  argument is the same in each, but we have chosen those sentences for  quotation which are the briefest and most suitable; certain calculations  being omitted.) \"A combination of bread and meat would supply much more  economically what was necessary ... so that 3/4 lbs. of meat, and less  than 2 lbs. of bread would supply all the needful carbon and nitrogen with  but little waste. From these facts it will be plain that a mixed diet is  the best and most economical food for man; and the result of experience  entirely coincides with what might have been anticipated on theoretical  grounds only.\" Professor Huxley, in his \"Elementary Physiology\" uses  almost the same figures and argument.    The adoption of this high proteid or nitrogen figure would lead to some  ridiculous conclusions. One writer states that 18 eggs would contain  sufficient flesh forming substance for a day's ration, but a very much  larger quantity would be required to supply enough carbon. On the other  hand, Professor Church says that, no less than 70 lbs. of pears would have  to be eaten per day, to supply the necessary quantity of nitrogen;  although the carbon would be in excess. The curious may calculate the  proper quantity of each that would make a theoretically perfect dietary.  People are apt to assume that what they themselves eat, or what their  class, race, or nation eat, is the proper and necessary diet; at least as  far as the elementary constituents and quantities are concerned. The error  is in attempting to make a vegetarian diet, however contrary to common  sense and the experience of the greater part of the earth's inhabitants,  agree in composition with the ordinary lavish flesh dietary of the  well-to-do European. It is significant that John Bull is caricatured with  a large abdomen and a coarse, ruddy, if not inflamed face, indicative of  his hearty dining on flesh, coarse food and alcoholic drinks. An unhealthy  short lived individual. Even if we accept a high proportion of proteid, it  is possible to combine purely vegetable foods so as to give the required  quantity of the various constituents, without a superfluity of the  carbo-hydrates. In \"Food Grains of India,\" Professor A.H. Church shows by  elaborate analyses and dietary tables, how this can be accomplished by  various combinations of cereals, pulses, etc. He takes Forster and Voit's  standard of 282 grains of nitrogen and 5,060 grains of carbon, with a  suitable deduction for the smaller weight of the Indians. In his examples  of daily rations he gives from 5 to 9"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15240"],[0,"A Journal of a Tour in the Congo Free State (#10)"],[1," screech shrilly in the trees and millions of mosquitoes hum steadily  within an inch or two of one's ears. All manner of animal cries are  heard in the forest and the hippos blow loudly as they rise to the  surface to breathe. As a matter of fact, the noise at midnight in the  forest, when every beast, bird and insect is busy hunting for food, is  greater than at any other time, and at midday only, one enjoys  comparative quiet when all the animal kingdom is asleep.    [Illustration: THE AMERICAN MISSION HOUSE AT LEOPOLDVILLE.]    One evening I went ashore with Chikaia for a stroll on the beach,  carrying only a gun. We soon found a number of ducks and as they had  never been fired at before probably, they were not scared away by the  noise of the gun, but kept wheeling round and round overhead affording  very easy shots. It would indeed have been easy to shoot them all. There  was, however, no reason to do so and having collected a couple or two to  make a welcome change from the daily goat of the steamer, we started  back when a fine antelope-cheval rushed from the wood across the sandy  beach towards the water. Chikaia at once became very excited and wished  me to fire, but it was useless, as the beast was more than a hundred  yards away. It was satisfactory to find the boy was a keen sportsman,  even though he did not appreciate the different capacities of a gun and  a rifle. However, I made a mental note never to go, even for a casual  stroll in Africa, without both weapons.    On returning to the ship, we hear that the Captain's boy has killed a  hippo and that dozens of others are waiting to be shot. We therefore  determine to try some shooting by moonlight and Chikaia is delighted  when he sees the _gras_ as he calls my Lee-Metford come out of its case.  It is a beautiful night with clear, cool air. Streams of silver flow  from the moon on the water, while the palms tower high with majestic  crowns. Here we are in the very midst of real nature and yet again it  unpleasantly recalls the scenery of a theatre. It is indeed  extraordinary with what accuracy scenic artists construct tropical  scenes. The surroundings tend to make one sentimental and regret that  this veritable garden of Eden should be exploited to make billiard balls  and rubber tyres for automobiles and bicycles. The native also, instead  of hunting elephant and hippos, eating his fill and sleeping, and eating  again and sleeping again until the carcase has disappeared and then  hunting again, now has to collect rubber juice and cut wood for an ugly  looking steam flat. Such however, is civilisation in the Congo.    Spoor of elephants and hippos abound and the grunt of the latter can  frequently be heard, but they are not sitting up on their haunches  waiting to be shot. The clear, shrill chirp of the sentry bird is indeed  warning the big beasts that something strange is moving and we shall  have to lie still for a long while probably before getting a chance at  the great heads as they are raised from the water.    After a walk of about a mile, we arrive at the place where the captain's  boy was supposed to have killed the hippo. The truth was he had _fired  at_ a beast who, as the spoor clearly showed, had walked calmly into the  river and not a trace of blood could be seen. After a time, with  practice perhaps, one will be able to gauge the truth from an ordinary  Congo statement.    Next day we reach the mouth of the Kasai, a large tributary which drains  much of the Equatorial District of the Congo. Here is a State Post,  Kwamouth, with a few well constructed houses and a Catholic Mission  where pretty walking sticks with ivory handles can be purchased and  where the Fathers make a few cigars from Congo tobacco which are not at  all bad smoking. A little further up the river, is the deserted Catholic  Mission of St. Marie which has evidently been at one time well arranged  with a large manioc plantation and garden. Here however, the Sleeping  Sickness appeared and the mortality was so heavy that the place was  abandoned. The disease had no doubt existed before, but it was this  terrible epidemic which first attracted the serious notice of Europeans.    It is becoming clear that there are a great number of nationalities  represented in the Congo. Most of the political and military  appointments are held by Belgians, but there are many Italian military  officers also. Nearly all the marine are Scandinavians and the language  of the river is therefore, chiefly English, although every State  official must speak a certain amount of French. A few Germans also hold  appointments, and the trading houses are run chiefly by English and  Dutch, while there are missionaries of several nationalities. In the  army, orders are given in French, but on the ships and in the stations,  the native is commanded in a kind of jargon based on the Bangala  dialect. The Danish captain of a Congo steamer thus as a rule, speaks,  besides his own language, English, French and Bangala and can make  himself understood in all.    On pay day, rolls of brass wire are cut up into mitakos, which become  longer the higher one travels up the river, this arrangement having been  introduced by Stanley and never altered. Here the mitako is 28  centimetres long and it is worth 5 cents, while at Basoko it is 40  centimetres long and worth 10 cents. The native crew are paid three  mitakos for their food per day which would purchase twice as much  kwanga as they could possibly eat. The capitas and wheelman are also  paid monthly wages which vary with the nature of their work.    By July 28th we have passed through the Channel into a portion of the  river which is very wide and has the appearance of a great lake studded  with islands. The banks are invisible, for the country here is  absolutely flat and continues so for many hundreds of miles until the  Province Orientale is reached. Between these islands, which are usually  well wooded, we pass slowly up the river, for the current is still  strong although the surface of the water appears absolutely still and  the light glares as from a mirror. Some of the islands are however, only  covered with grass and a herd of buffaloes on one come charging down to  the river to drink. Unfortunately one of the passengers fires a kind of  saloon rifle, which might possibly have killed a rabbit at twenty yards,  and frightens them back. This is a great pity, for if we had had time,  we could easily have bagged one or two and had some fresh beef for  dinner.    At midday on the 29th we reach Mopolenga and stop for wood. The land in  the neighbourhood is well cultivated and manioc, sweet potatoes, bananas  and pineapples flourish. The manioc plant has a green stem, reddish  branches and green leaves arranged in clusters of six which turn  downwards forming the shape of a parasol, evidently a popular, as it is  an appropriate, pattern for vegetable life in this hot country. The root  of the manioc yields the flour, which is made into kwanga and unless it  is well boiled, is supposed to be very injurious. The animals here  consist chiefly of monkeys, parrots and finches, but many ducks fly from  a swamp near the water.    In the afternoon we reach Bolobo, the head quarters of the Baptist  Mission, which is presided over by Mr. Grenfell, a missionary who has  resided for over twenty years in the Congo. He has taught the natives to  make bricks and build houses and has erected a Mission Hall, a hospital  and a printing house. The mission enclosure is well laid out with mango  trees and other useful fruits and many fat ducks and fowls pass a  contented existence there. Unfortunately Mr. Grenfell was not at home,  but we were fortunate in finding Mr. Scrivener, another missionary, who  has resided some years in Africa. He stated that the natives were  emigrating from the District of Lake Leopold, which lies behind Bolobo  and is Domain Land, because they were forced to collect rubber and were  flogged if they refused. He had never himself seen a native who had been  ill treated, but had been told so by natives. Asked whether the people  were ever mutilated, Mr. Scrivener looked very surprised and answered  \"Oh no, there is nothing of that kind now!\"    Bolobo is very populous and many natives flocked down to the beach  immediately the steamer arrived and at once held an outdoor market on  the beach selling manioc, fish, clothes, pots of various kinds and other  articles to the crew and passengers. A Congo flat fish of the perch  family is found here, smoke dried and sold for food and is very good  eating indeed.    Two of the crew were _chicotted_. to-day by order of the captain. One had  attacked another boy with a knife and wounded him and the other had  stolen, and then falsely blamed another. The _chicotte_ is a plain  strip of hippo hide and the punishment was administered publicly by the  capita on the bridge of the steamer and did not appear to be more  painful than an ordinary birching at a public school.    At 10 p.m. we decide to take the big iron boat of the steamer and go  hunting. The natives are exceedingly skilful and know all the likely  places for hippo. They first paddle hard up stream and having arrived at  the hunting ground allow the boat to drift down with the current in  perfect silence. It is clear moonlight, but it is necessary to cover the  fore sight of the rifle with white paper in order to see it clearly.  After a time, up rises a great head with a great pant and there is just  time for a shot before it sinks again. Hippos frequent shallow water and  are indifferent swimmers. They walk about on the bottom and rise at  intervals to breathe. It is thus impossible to know in which direction a  beast will next appear or whether he will come up under the boat and  capsize it. This night there were great numbers and we had excellent  sport. One shot in the head is sufficient to kill a hippo which then  sinks and the body"]]]
