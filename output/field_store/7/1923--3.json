Those notes that repeat and modify the  motive and are combined under one slur constitute the phrase, which is  similar to a clause in a sentence of words. A period, or sentence, in  music, comprises a musical idea, complete in itself, though of a nature  to produce, when united with other harmonious ideas, a perfect whole.    A simple melody is usually composed of eight measures, or some number  divisible by four. There are exceptions, as in \"God Save the King,\" our  \"America,\" of which the first part contains six measures, the second  part eight.    Habit and instinct show us that no melody can end satisfactorily without  some cadence leading to a note belonging to the tonic or key chord. Very  often the first part of a melody will end on a note of the dominant  chord, from which a progression will arise in the second part that leads  satisfactorily to a concluding note in the tonic chord.    Counterpoint, literally point against point, is the art of so composing  music in parts that several parts move simultaneously, making harmony by  their combination. During the fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth and  eighteenth centuries the masters of counterpoint shaped the musical  materials in use to-day. So anxious were they to attain perfection of  form they often lost sight of the spirit which alone can give vitality  to musical utterances. The great Bach infused this into his fugues, the  highest manifestation of the contrapuntal, or polyphonic music of old.    Meanwhile the growth of the individual led to the growth of monophony  in music, in which one voice stands out prominently, with an  accompaniment of other voices. Its instrumental flower was reached in  the symphony. Melody reigns supreme in monophonic music. Both the canon  and the fugue form a commonwealth, in which all voices are rated alike.  Viewed rightly, this suits the modern democratic instinct, and there is  to-day a tendency to return to polyphonic writing. It is individuality  in union. In the hands of genius it affords the most refined kind of  harmony.    A thorough knowledge of counterpoint shows the mistake of regarding it  merely as a dull relic of a dead past. It is a living reality that, if  correctly studied, leads to a solid, dignified, flowing style, rich in  design, and independent in its individuality. Counterpoint, said a  critic in the London Musical News, shows the student how to make a  harmonic phrase like a well-shaped tree, of which every bough, twig and  leaf secures for itself the greatest independence, the fullest measure  of light and air. Composer, interpreter and listener may all profit by  a comprehension of counterpoint.    From its infancy modern music has been affected by two perpetually  warring factors, the Classical and the Romantic. The first demands  reverence for established ideals of formal beauty; the second, striking  a note of revolt, compels recognition of new ideals. As in all other  departments of art and life, progress in music comes through the  continual conflict between the conservative and the radical forces. A  position viewed as hazardous and unsuitable in one age, becomes the  accepted position of the next, and those who have been denounced as  musical heretics come to be regarded as musical heroes. Very often the  untutored public, trusting to natural instincts, will be in advance of  the learned critic in accepting some startling innovation. Old laws may  pass away, new laws may come, but the eternal verities on which all  manifestations of Truth and Beauty are based can never cease to be.    \"The scientific laws of music are transitory, because they have been  tentatively constructed during the gradual development of the musical  faculty,\" says W. H. Hadow, in his valuable \"Studies in Modern Music.\"  \"No power in man is born at full growth; it begins in germ, and  progresses according to the particular laws that condition its nature.  Hence it requires one kind of treatment at one stage, another at  another, both being perfectly right and true in relation to their proper  period. But there are behind these special rules certain psychological  laws which seem, so far as we can understand them, to be coeval with  humanity itself; and these form the permanent code by which music is to  be judged. The reason why, in past ages, the critics have been so often  and so disastrously at fault is that they have mistaken the transitory  for the permanent, the rules of musical science for the laws of musical  philosophy.\"    An acquaintance with form as the manifestation of law is essential to an  intelligent hearing of music. The listener should have at least a  rudimentary knowledge of musical construction from the simplest ballad  to the most complex symphony. Having this knowledge it will be possible  to receive undisturbed the impressions music has to give, and to  distinguish the trivial and commonplace from the noble and beautiful.    The oftener good music is heard the more completely it will be  appreciated. Therefore, they listen best to music who hear the best  continually. The assertion is often heard that a person must be educated  up to an enjoyment of high class music. Certainly, one who has heard  nothing else must be educated down to an enjoyment of ragtime, with its  crude rhythms.    \"We know a true poem to the extent to which our spirits respond to the  spiritual appeal it makes,\" says Dr. Hiram Corson. It is the same with a  true musical composition. We must take something to it, in order to  receive something from it. Beyond knowledge comes the intuitive feeling  which is enriched by knowledge. Through it we may feel the breath of  life, the spiritual appeal, which belongs to every great work of art and  which must forever remain inexplicable.          VI    The Piano and Piano Players      When Pythagoras, Father of Musical Science, some six centuries before  our era, marked and sounded musical intervals by mathematical division  on a string stretched across a board, he was unconsciously laying the  foundation for our modern pianoforte. How soon keys were added to the  monochord, as this measuring instrument was named, cannot positively be  ascertained. We may safely assume it was not slow in adopting the rude  keyboard ascribed by tradition to Pan pipes, and applied to the portable  organ of early Christian communities.    After the tenth century the development of the monochord seems to have  begun in earnest. Two or more strings of equal length are now divided  and set in motion by flat metal wedges, attached to the key levers, and  called tangents, because they touched the strings. In response to the  demand for increased range, as many as twenty keys were brought to act  on a few strings, commanding often three octaves. Guido d'Arezzo, the  famous sight-reading music teacher of the eleventh century, advised his  pupils to \"exercise the hand in the use of the monochord,\" showing his  knowledge of the keyboard. The keyed monochord gained the name  clavichord. Its box-like case was first placed on a table, later on its  own stand, and increased in elegance. Not until the eighteenth century  was each key provided with a separate string.    No unimped triumphal progress can be claimed for the various claviers or  keyboard instruments that came into use. Dance music found in them a  congenial field, thus causing many serious-minded people to regard them  as dangerous tempters to vanity and folly. In the year 1529, Pietro  Bembo, a grave theoretician, wrote to his daughter Helena, at her  convent school: \"As to your request to be allowed to learn the clavier,  I answer that you cannot yet, owing to your youth, understand that  playing is only suited for volatile, frivolous women; whereas I desire  you to be the most lovable maiden in the world. Also, it would bring you  but little pleasure or renown if you should play badly; while to play  well you would be obliged to devote ten or twelve years to practice,  without being able to think of anything else. Consider a moment whether  this would become you. If your friends wish you to play in order to give  them pleasure, tell them you do not desire to make yourself ridiculous  in their eyes, and be content with your books and your domestic  occupations.\"    A different view was entertained in England during Queen Elizabeth's  reign, where claviers were in vogue styled virginals, because, as an  ancient chronicle explained, \"virgins do most commonly play on them.\"  The virginal was usually of oblong shape, often resembling a lady's  workbox. With the Virgin Queen it was a prime favorite, although not  named expressly for her as the flattering fashion of the time led many  to assume. If she actually did justice to some of the airs with  variations in the \"Queen Elizabeth Virginal Book,\" she must indeed have  been proficient on the instrument. Quaint Dr. Charles Burney (1726-1814)  declares, in his \"History of Music,\" that no performer of his day could  play them without at least a month's practice.    The clavier gave promise of its destined career in the Elizabethan age.  Shakespeare immortalized it, and William Byrd (1546-1623) became the  first clavier master. He and Dr. John Bull (1563-1628), says Oscar Bie,  in his great work on \"The Clavier and Its Masters,\" \"represent the two  types which run through the entire history of the clavier. Byrd was the  more intimate, delicate, spiritual intellect; Bull the untamed genius,  the brilliant executant, the less exquisitely refined artist. It is  significant that these two types stand together on the threshold of  clavier art.\" Bull had gained his degree at Oxford, the founding of  whose chair of music is popularly attributed to Alfred the Great.    As early as the year 1400 claviers had appeared whose strings were  plucked by quills attached to jacks at the end of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18285"],[0,"Tales from the Hindu Dramatists (#10)"],[1,"\"    Kripa then requests Duryodhana to give the command of the army to  Aswatthama. The king excuses himself on the plea of having promised it  to Kerna, to whom he transfers his ring accordingly. A violent quarrel  ensues between Kerna and Aswatthama, and Duryodhana and Kripa have some  difficulty in preventing them from single combat. Fiery Aswatthama at  last reproaches Duryodhana with partiality, and refuses to fight for him  more. Bhima proclaims that he has at last encountered Duhsasana, the  insulter of Draupadi, and is about to sacrifice him to his vengeance.  Kerna, instigated by Aswatthama, foregoes his anger and is about to  resume his arms when a voice from heaven prevents him. He is obliged,  therefore, to remain an idle spectator of the fight, but desires Kripa  to assist the king. They go off to fight.    Duhsasana is killed and the army of the Kauravas is put to the rout.  Duryodhana is wounded and becomes insensible. On his recovery, he hears  of Duhsasana's death and gives vent to his sorrows.    In the conflict between Arjuna and Vrishasena, the son of Kerna, the  young prince is slain to his father's distress. Sundaraka, a follower of  Kerna, brings a leaf on which Kerna has written to Duryodhana, with an  arrow dipped in his own blood, message for aid. Duryodhana orders his  chariot, and prepares to seek the fight again, when he is prevented by  the arrival of his parents, Dhritarashtra and Gandhari, who with  Sanjaya, endeavour to prevail upon Duryodhana to sue for peace, but he  refuses.    A tumult and the entrance of the king's charioteer announce the death of  Kerna. Duryodhana, after expressing his grief, determines to go and  avenge him, and mount the car of Sanjaya, the charioteer of  Dhritarashtra, for that purpose, when Arjuna and Bhima arrive in search  of him.    On finding the seniors there, Arjuna purposes to withdraw; but Bhima  insists on first addressing them, which they do, but in insulting terms.    Dhritarashtra, reproaching them for this language, is told they use it  not in pride, but in requital of his having witnessed, without  interfering to prevent, the oppression and barbarous treatment the  Pandavas experienced from his sons. Duryodhana interferes and defies  Bhima, who is equally anxious for the combat; but Arjuna prevents it,  and the brothers are called off by a summons from Yudhishthira, who  orders the battle to cease for the day and the dead bodies of either  party to be burnt. Aswatthama is now disposed to be reconciled to  Duryodhana; but the prince receives his advances coldly, and he  withdraws in disgust. Dhritarashtra sends Sanjaya after him to persuade  him to overlook Duryodhana's conduct. Duryodhana mounts his car, and the  aged couple seek the tent of Salya, the king of Madra.    Duryodhana is discovered concealed in a swamp, and compelled to fight  with Bhimasena, by whom he is slain. Yudhisthira orders public  rejoicings on the occasion.    Charvaka, a Rakshasa disguised as a sage, then enters, requiring rest  and water. He relates that he has seen Arjuna engaged with Duryodhana,  Bhima having been previously slain by the latter, and gives his hearers  to understand that Arjuna also has fallen. Draupadi determines to mount  the funeral pile, and Yudhishthira, to put an end to himself when the  Rakshasa, satisfied with the success of his scheme, which was intended  to prevail on this couple to perish, departs. The pile is prepared, and  Yudhishthira and Draupadi are about to sacrifice themselves, when they  are disturbed by a great clamour. Supposing it to precede the approach  of Duryodhana, Yudhishthira calls for his arms, when Bhima, his club  besmeared with blood, rushes in. Draupadi runs away; he catches her by  the hair, and is seized by Yudhishthira--on which the mistake is  discovered.    The braid of Draupadi's hair is now again bound up. Arjuna and Vasudeva  arrive, and announce that they have heard of the fraud of Charvaka. On  hearing that the mendicant is slain by Nakula, Krishna expresses great  satisfaction.          CHANDA KAUSIKA    OR    THE OFFENDED VISWAMITRA.      Maharaja Harischandra, a scion of the solar race, a powerful king,  endowed with uncommon virtues and skilled in all arts, sees a vision of  misfortune to come. Apprehending future evils for his subjects, he  confers with his priest, and acting on his advice, spends a whole night  in religious contemplation in a temple of God. Next morning the king  enters the inner apartments of his palace to greet his wife. The queen,  who is jealous on account of his absence during the night, says to him,  \"Oh! I see your eyes are red for want of sleep. The sight is not  uninteresting; only, I am being consumed with the fires of agony of  mind.\" The king, on hearing this, smiles and says, \"Oh my dear queen! do  not be angry. Be assured, you have no rival in Harischandra's  affections\".    The queen is not altogether satisfied with this assurance, for love is  suspicious. Just then, a messenger comes to request permission to bring  in a hermit who is standing at the door. The permission is granted and  the hermit enters. Addressing the King, he says, \"The family priest has  sent you some holy water, which will bring you peace of mind and ward  off the evils for fear of which he made you keep up a whole night.\" The  king and the queen thankfully accept the water. The hermit retires. The  queen, now learning from the hermit the cause of her husband's absence  from her, and of his wakefulness all night, becomes ashamed of herself  and asks her lord's pardon for the false insinuation she had made. On  this he kisses the queen.    Again, the king goes on a hunting expedition. Hunting is a favourite  pastime with kings. It promotes health and courage and gives immense  pleasure to all who engage in it. When the king enters a thick forest,  he finds the great sage Viswamitra deeply engaged in religious  austerities with the view of acquiring the three unattainable arts of  creation, preservation and destruction, which properly belong to Brahma,  Vishnu and Siva respectively. The gods plot to prevent this  consummation, and send a servant named Bighna. Bighna assumes the form  of a boar and appears before the king. The king discharges an arrow at  him, but in vain. The animal enters the thick forest. The king follows.  It now enters the hermitage of Viswamitra. The king addresses his  followers thus, \"It is the duty of kings to get rid of carnivorous  animals from the forest of meditation and austerities. I have, on the  contrary, made a carnivorous animal enter it. How can I now retire? But  the hermits will be disturbed in their religious exercises if you all  enter. So, do you all wait here. I will proceed alone.\" With these  observations, the king enters the forest of meditation and is charmed  with its exquisite beauty.    The king thinks, \"Tearing off the bonds of the world is the cause of  hermits' ease and happiness. With no attachments, no desires, no  bereavements, no worldly anxieties, they are happily absorbed in divine  contemplation.\" The king is thinking thus when distant cries are heard,  as if females are crying out, \"Maharaja Harischandra! save us! save us!  Save us from the fire-place of this mighty hermit. We three helpless  women are being burnt up.\"    At this, the king is at a loss. His heart melts at the tender cries of  the women. He extinguishes the flame with his weapon dedicated to  Varuna, the god of the waters.    The three ladies are the three arts of creation, preservation and  destruction. They, thus delivered, go away to Heaven, showering  blessings of victory on their deliverer.    The meditations of the dreadful sage Viswamitra are thus broken off. His  eyes are red with anger. Seeing Harischandra standing before him he  cries out, \"Oh wretch of a Kshattriya! I will burn you up as Siva did  the god of love.\"    The king is at a loss. He trembles as a plantain tree tossed up by  tempest. He touches the feet of the sage and most piteously begs pardon  of him.    But the sage is obdurate. He will not be appeased. He is about to  consume the offender with imprecation.    The Raja again and again implores him thus:--    \"My lord Kausika! Forgive me. I was touched by the piteous appeals of  the women and disturbed you for the sake of duty.\"    At this, the sage becomes still more furious and says trembling, \"O  Villain! speak of duty! What is your duty?\"    The king replies,    \"O god! gifts to virtuous Brahmans, protection of those afflicted with  fear, and fight with enemies are the three chief duties of Kshattriyas.\"    The sage thereupon observes,    \"If compliance with duties be your aim, make some gift to me  commensurate with my merit.\"    The king replies, \"Oh great sage! what have I got with which to make a  due gift to you? I am prepared to give you what I have----this world  with all its wealth. Please accept it.\"    Then the sage becomes calm and says,    \"Be it so. I will not burn you up. I accept your gift of a kingdom. Now  that you have made a gift, give me a fee of one thousand gold coins,  commensurate with the gift. I will not accept the gift without the fee.  But as you have made a gift of the world with all its wealth, you must  not take the fee-money out of that world. Collect the money elsewhere.\"    At this, the king is in a fix. After much thought it strikes him that it  is said in the scriptures that Benares is separate from the world. So he  resolves to collect money from that holy city.    Then the king placing the crown and the sceptre of royalty at the feet  of the sage, obtains from him one month's time to pay the fee and taking  the queen Saibya and his son Rohitasya with him, starts for Benares. The  month allowed him is drawing to a close. Not a single gold coin has been  collected--to say nothing of one thousand coins. Alms is the only way of  collection. Alms barely suffices for maintenance. On the morning of the  last"]]]
