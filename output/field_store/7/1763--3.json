On his mantel-piece there was found a bullet mold and an outfit  for reloading cartridges. There were also two pistol scabbards and a  bottle of cocaine. The other evidences that Charles was a desperado the  writer described as follows:      In his room were found negro periodicals and other \"race\" propaganda,    most of which was in the interest of the negro's emigration to Liberia.    There were Police Gazettes strewn about his room and other papers of a    similar character. Well-worn textbooks, bearing his name written in his    own scrawling handwriting, and well-filled copybooks found in his trunk    showed that he had burnt the midnight oil, and was desirous of improving    himself intellectually in order that he might conquer the hated white    race. Much of the literature found among his chattels was of a    superlatively vituperative character, and attacked the white race in    unstinted language and asserted the equal rights of the Negro.      Charles was evidently the local agent of the _Voice of Missions_, a    \"religious\" paper, published at Atlanta, as great bundles of that sheet    were found. It is edited by one Bishop Turner, and seems to be the    official organ of all haters of the white race. Its editorials are    anarchistic in the extreme, and urge upon the negro that the sooner he    realizes that he is as good as the white man the better it will be for    him. The following verses were clipped from the journal; they were    marked \"till forbidden,\" and appeared in several successive numbers:              OUR SENTIMENTS            H.M.T.            My country, 'tis of thee,          Dear land of Africa,            Of thee we sing.          Land where our fathers died,          Land of the Negro's pride,            God's truth shall ring.            My native country, thee,          Land of the black and free,            Thy name I love;          To see thy rocks and rills,          Thy woods and matchless hills,            Like that above.            When all thy slanderous ghouls,          In the bosom of sheol,            Forgotten lie,          Thy monumental name shall live,          And suns thy royal brow shall gild,          Upheaved to heaven high,            O'ertopping thrones.      There were no valuables in his room, and if he was a professional thief    he had his headquarters for storing his plunder at some other place than    his room on Fourth Street. Nothing was found in his room that could lead    to the belief that he was a thief, except fifty or more small bits of    soap. The inference was that every place he visited he took all of the    soap lying around, as all of the bits were well worn and had seen long    service on the washstand.      His wearing apparel was little more than rags, and financially he was    evidently not in a flourishing condition. He was in no sense a skilled    workman, and his room showed, in fact, that he was nothing more than a    laborer.      The \"philosopher in the garret\" was a dirty wretch, and his room, his    bedding and his clothing were nasty and filthy beyond belief. His object    in life seemed to have been the discomfiture of the white race, and to    this purpose he devoted himself with zeal. He declared himself to be a    \"patriot,\" and wished to be the Moses of his race.    Under the title of \"The Making of a Monster,\" the reporter attempts to  give \"something of the personality of the archfiend, Charles.\" Giving his  imagination full vent the writer says:      It is only natural that the deepest interest should attach to the    personality of Robert Charles. What manner of man was this fiend    incarnate? What conditions developed him? Who were his preceptors? From    what ancestral strain, if any, did he derive his ferocious hatred of the    whites, his cunning, his brute courage, the apostolic zeal which he    displayed in spreading the propaganda of African equality? These are    questions involving one of the most remarkable psychological problems of    modern times.    In answer to the questions which he propounds, the reporter proceeds to  admit that he did not learn anything of a very desperate nature connected  with Charles. He says:      Although Charles was a familiar figure to scores of Negroes in New    Orleans, and they had been more or less intimately acquainted with him    for over two years, curiously little can be learned of his habits or    mode of life. Since the perpetration of his terrible series of crimes it    goes without saying that his former friends are inclined to be reticent,    but it is reasonably certain that they have very little to tell. In    regard to himself, Charles was singularly reticent for a Negro. He did    not even indulge in the usual lying about his prowess and his    adventures. This was possibly due to the knowledge that he was wanted    for a couple of murders. The man had sense enough to know that it would    be highly unwise to excite any curiosity about his past.      When Charles first came to New Orleans he worked here and there as a day    laborer. He was employed at different times in a sawmill, on the street    gangs, as a roustabout on the levee, as a helper at the sugar works and    as a coal shoveler in the engine room of the St. Charles Hotel. At each    of the places where he worked he was known as a quiet, rather surly    fellow, who had little to say to anybody, and generally performed his    tasks in morose silence. He managed to convey the impression, however,    of being a man of more than ordinary intelligence.      A Negro named William Butts, who drives a team on the levee and lives on    Washington Street, near Baronne, told a _Times-Democrat_ reporter    yesterday that Charles got a job about a year ago as agent for a    Liberian Immigration Society, which has headquarters at Birmingham, and    was much elated at the prospect of making a living without hard labor.    According to the further investigations of this reporter, Charles was also  agent for Bishop Turner's _Voice of Missions_, the colored missionary  organ of the African Methodist Church, edited by H.M. Turner, of Atlanta,  Georgia. Concerning his service as agent for the _Voice of Missions_, the  reporter says:      He secured a number of subscribers and visited them once a month to    collect the installments. In order to insure regular payments it was    necessary to keep up enthusiasm, which was prone to wane, and Charles    consequently became an active and continual preacher of the propaganda    of hatred. Whatever may have been his private sentiments at the outset,    this constant harping on one string must eventually have had a powerful    effect upon his own mind.      Exactly how he received his remuneration is uncertain, but he told    several of his friends that he got a \"big commission.\" Incidentally he    solicited subscribers for a Negro paper called the _Voice of the    Missions_, and when he struck a Negro who did not want to go to Africa    himself, he begged contributions for the \"good of the cause.\"      In the course of time Charles developed into a fanatic on the subject of    the Negro oppression and neglected business to indulge in wild tirades    whenever he could find a listener. He became more anxious to make    converts than to obtain subscribers, and the more conservative darkies    began to get afraid of him. Meanwhile he got into touch with certain    agitators in the North and made himself a distributing agent for their    literature, a great deal of which he gave away. Making money was a    secondary consideration to \"the cause.\"      One of the most enthusiastic advocates of the Liberian scheme is the    colored Bishop H.M. Turner, of Atlanta. Turner is a man of unusual    ability, has been over to Africa personally several times, and has made    himself conspicuous by denouncing laws which he claimed discriminated    against the blacks. Charles was one of the bishop's disciples and    evidence has been found that seems to indicate they were in    correspondence.    This was all that the _Times-Democrat_'s reporters could find after the  most diligent search to prove that Charles was the fiend incarnate which  the press of New Orleans and elsewhere declared him to be.    The reporters of the _New Orleans Picayune_ were no more successful than  their brethren of the _Times-Democrat_. They, too, were compelled to  substitute fiction for facts in their attempt to prove Charles a  desperado. In the issue of the twenty-sixth of July it was said that  Charles was well known in Vicksburg, and was there a consort of thieves.  They mentioned that a man named Benson Blake was killed in 1894 or 1895,  and that four Negroes were captured, and two escaped. Of the two escaped  they claim that Charles was one. The four negroes who were captured were  put in jail, and as usual, in the high state of civilization which  characterizes Mississippi, the right of the person accused of crime to an  indictment by legal process and a legal trial by jury was considered an  useless formality if the accused happened to be black. A mob went to the  jail that night, the four colored men were delivered to the mob, and all  four were hanged in the court-house yard. The reporters evidently assumed  that Charles was guilty, if, in fact, he was ever there, because the other  four men were lynched. They did not consider it was a fact of any  importance that Charles was never indicted. They called him a murderer on  general principles.      +DIED IN SELF-DEFENSE+    The life, character and death of Robert Charles challenges the thoughtful  consideration of all fair-minded people. In the frenzy of the moment, when  nearly a dozen men lay dead, the victims of his unerring and death-dealing  aim, it was natural for a prejudiced press and for citizens in private  life to denounce "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14977"],[0,"The Red Record (#10)"],[1,"Jackson, his  mother-in-law, Lou Carter, Rufus Bigley, were lynched near Quincy, Miss.,  the charge against them being suspicion of well poisoning. It appears from  the newspaper dispatches at that time that a family by the name of  Woodruff was taken ill in September of 1892. As a result of their illness  one or more of the family are said to have died, though that matter is not  stated definitely. It was suspected that the cause of their illness was  the existence of poison in the water, some miscreant having placed poison  in the well. Suspicion pointed to a colored man named Benjamin Jackson who  was at once arrested. With him also were arrested his wife and  mother-in-law and all were held on the same charge.    The matter came up for judicial investigation, but as might have been  expected, the white people concluded it was unnecessary to wait the result  of the investigation--that it was preferable to hang the accused first and  try him afterward. By this method of procedure, the desired result was  always obtained--the accused was hanged. Accordingly Benjamin Jackson was  taken from the officers by a crowd of about two hundred people, while the  inquest was being held, and hanged. After the killing of Jackson, the  inquest was continued to ascertain the possible connection of the other  persons charged with the crime. Against the wife and mother-in-law of the  unfortunate man there was not the slightest evidence and the coroner's  jury was fair enough to give them their liberty. They were declared  innocent and returned to their homes. But this did not protect the women  from the demands of the Christian white people of that section of the  country. In any other land and with any other people, the fact that these  two accused persons were women would have pleaded in their favor for  protection and fair play, but that had no weight with the Mississippi  Christians nor the further fact that a jury of white men had declared them  innocent. The hanging of one victim on an unproven charge did not begin to  satisfy the mob in its bloodthirsty demands and the result was that even  after the women had been discharged, they were at once taken in charge by  a mob, which hung them by the neck until they were dead.    Still the mob was not satisfied. During the coroner's investigation the  name of a fourth person, Rufus Bigley, was mentioned. He was acquainted  with the Jacksons and that fact, together with some testimony adduced at  the inquest, prompted the mob to decide that he should die also. Search  was at once made for him and the next day he was apprehended. He was not  given over into the hands of the civil authorities for trial nor did the  coroner's inquest find that he was guilty, but the mob was quite  sufficient in itself. After finding Bigley, he was strung up to a tree and  his body left hanging, where it was found next day. It may be remarked  here in passing that this instance of the moral degradation of the people  of Mississippi did not excite any interest in the public at large.  American Christianity heard of this awful affair and read of its details  and neither press nor pulpit gave the matter more than a passing comment.  Had it occurred in the wilds of interior Africa, there would have been an  outcry from the humane people of this country against the savagery which  would so mercilessly put men and women to death. But it was an evidence of  American civilization to be passed by unnoticed, to be denied or condoned  as the requirements of any future emergency might determine.      LYNCHED FOR AN ATTEMPTED ASSAULT    With only a little more aggravation than that of Smith who quarreled at  Roanoke with the market woman, was the assault which operated as the  incentive to a most brutal lynching in Memphis, Tenn. Memphis is one of  the queen cities of the south, with a population of about seventy thousand  souls--easily one of the twenty largest, most progressive and wealthiest  cities of the United States. And yet in its streets there occurred a scene  of shocking savagery which would have disgraced the Congo. No woman was  harmed, no serious indignity suffered. Two women driving to town in a  wagon, were suddenly accosted by Lee Walker. He claimed that he demanded  something to eat. The women claimed that he attempted to assault them.  They gave such an alarm that he ran away. At once the dispatches spread  over the entire country that a big, burly Negro had brutally assaulted two  women. Crowds began to search for the alleged fiend. While hunting him  they shot another Negro dead in his tracks for refusing to stop when  ordered to do so. After a few days Lee Walker was found, and put in jail  in Memphis until the mob there was ready for him.    The _Memphis Commercial_ of Sunday, July 23, contains a full account of  the tragedy from which the following extracts are made:      At 12 o'clock last night, Lee Walker, who attempted to outrage Miss    Mollie McCadden, last Tuesday morning, was taken from the county jail    and hanged to a telegraph pole just north of the prison. All day rumors    were afloat that with nightfall an attack would be made upon the jail,    and as everyone anticipated that a vigorous resistance would be made, a    conflict between the mob and the authorities was feared.      At 10 o'clock Capt. O'Haver, Sergt. Horan and several patrolmen were on    hand, but they could do nothing with the crowd. An attack by the mob was    made on the door in the south wall, and it yielded. Sheriff McLendon and    several of his men threw themselves into the breach, but two or three of    the storming party shoved by. They were seized by the police, but were    not subdued, the officers refraining from using their clubs. The entire    mob might at first have been dispersed by ten policemen who would use    their clubs, but the sheriff insisted that no violence be done.      The mob got an iron rail and used it as a battering ram against the    lobby doors. Sheriff McLendon tried to stop them, and some one of the    mob knocked him down with a chair. Still he counseled moderation and    would not order his deputies and the police to disperse the crowd by    force. The pacific policy of the sheriff impressed the mob with the idea    that the officers were afraid, or at least would do them no harm, and    they redoubled their efforts, urged on by a big switchman. At 12 o'clock    the door of the prison was broken in with a rail.      As soon as the rapist was brought out of the door calls were heard for a    rope; then someone shouted, \"Burn him!\" But there was no time to make a    fire. When Walker got into the lobby a dozen of the men began beating    and stabbing him. He was half dragged, half carried to the corner of    Front Street and the alley between Sycamore and Mill, and hung to a    telegraph pole.      Walker made a desperate resistance. Two men entered his cell first and    ordered him to come forth. He refused, and they failing to drag him out,    others entered. He scratched and bit his assailants, wounding several of    them severely with his teeth. The mob retaliated by striking and cutting    him with fists and knives. When he reached the steps leading down to the    door he made another stand and was stabbed again and again. By the time    he reached the lobby his power to resist was gone, and he was shoved    along through the mob of yelling, cursing men and boys, who beat, spat    upon and slashed the wretch-like demon. One of the leaders of the mob    fell, and the crowd walked ruthlessly over him. He was badly hurt--a    jawbone fractured and internal injuries inflicted. After the lynching    friends took charge of him.      The mob proceeded north on Front Street with the victim, stopping at    Sycamore Street to get a rope from a grocery. \"Take him to the iron    bridge on Main Street,\" yelled several men. The men who had hold of the    Negro were in a hurry to finish the job, however, and when they reached    the telephone pole at the corner of Front Street and the first alley    north of Sycamore they stopped. A hastily improvised noose was slipped    over the Negro's head, and several young men mounted a pile of lumber    near the pole and threw the rope over one of the iron stepping pins. The    Negro was lifted up until his feet were three feet above the ground, the    rope was made taut, and a corpse dangled in midair. A big fellow who    helped lead the mob pulled the Negro's legs until his neck cracked. The    wretch's clothes had been torn off, and, as he swung, the man who pulled    his legs mutilated the corpse.      One or two knife cuts, more or less, made little difference in the    appearance of the dead rapist, however, for before the rope was around    his neck his skin was cut almost to ribbons. One pistol shot was fired    while the corpse was hanging. A dozen voices protested against the use    of firearms, and there was no more shooting. The body was permitted to    hang for half an hour, then it was cut down and the rope divided among    those who lingered around the scene of the tragedy. Then it was    suggested that the corpse be burned, and it was done. The entire    performance, from the assault on the jail to the burning of the dead    Negro was witnessed by a score or so of policemen and as many deputy    sheriffs, but not a hand was lifted to stop the proceedings after the    jail door yielded.      As the body hung to the telegraph pole, blood streaming down from the    knife wounds in his neck, his hips and lower part of his legs also    slashed with knives, the crowd hurled expletives at him, swung the body    so that it was dashed against the pole, and, so far from the ghastly    sight proving trying to the nerves, the crowd looked on with    complaisance, if not with real pleasure. The Negro died hard. The neck    was not broken, as the body was drawn up without being given a fall, and    death came by strangulation. For"]]]
