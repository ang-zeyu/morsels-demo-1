The like of these persons would depict the drop as an  ocean, and the mote as a sun. They call the house at Kulayn 'the strong  fortress,' and close their eyes to the perspicuous truth. They have  attacked a number of reformers of the world with the charge of  seditiousness. As God liveth, these persons had and have no intent nor  hope save the glory of the state and service to their nation! For God they  spoke and for God they speak, and in the way of God do they journey.    \"O friends, ask of Him Who is the Desire of the denizens of earth that He  will succor His Majesty the King (may God perpetuate his kingdom) so that  all the dominions of Persia may by the light of the Sun of Justice become  adorned with the decoration of tranquility and security. According to  statements made, he, at the promptings of his blessed nature, loosed those  who were in bonds, and bestowed freedom on the captives. The  representation of certain matters before the faces of [God's] servants is  obligatory, and natural to the pious, so that the good may be aware and  become cognizant [thereof]. Verily He inspireth whom He pleaseth with what  He desireth, and He is the Powerful, the Ordainer, the Knowing, the Wise.    \"A word from that land hath reached the Oppressed One which in truth was  the cause of wonder. His Highness the Mu'tamidu'd-Dawlih, Farhad Mirza,  said concerning the Imprisoned One that whereof the repetition is not  pleasing. This Victim consorted very little with him or the like of him.  So far as is recollected on [only] two occasions did he visit  Mur_gh_-Mahallih in _Sh_imiran where was the abode of the Oppressed One.  On the first occasion he came one day in the afternoon, and on the second  one Friday morning, returning nigh unto sundown. He knows and is conscious  that he should not speak contrary to the truth. If one enter his presence  let him repeat these words before him on behalf of the Oppressed One: 'O  Prince! I ask justice and fairness from your Highness concerning that  which hath befallen this poor Victim.' Well is it for that soul whom the  doubts of the perverse withhold not from the display of justice, and  deprive not of the lights of the luminary of equity. O saints of God! at  the end of Our discourse We enjoin on you once again chastity,  faithfulness, godliness, sincerity, and purity. Lay aside the evil and  adopt the good. This is that whereunto ye are commanded in the Book of  God, the Knowing, the Wise. Well is it with those who practice [this  injunction]. At this moment the pen crieth out, saying, 'O saints of God,  regard the horizon of uprightness, and be quit, severed, and free from  what is beside this. There is no strength and no power save in God.'\"    In short, formerly in all provinces in Persia accounts and stories  concerning this sect diverse and discordant, yea, incompatible with the  character of the human race and opposed to the divine endowment, passed on  the tongues and in the mouths of men and obtained notoriety. But when  their principles acquired fixity and stability and their conduct and  behavior were known and appreciated, the veil of doubt and suspicion fell,  the true character of this sect became clear and evident, and it reached  the degree of certainty that their principles were unlike men's fancies,  and that their foundation differed from [the popular] opinion and  estimate. In their conduct, action, morality, and demeanor was no place  for objection; the objection in Persia is to certain of the ideas and  tenets of this sect. And from the indications of various circumstances it  hath been observed that the people have acquired belief and confidence in  the trustworthiness, faithfulness, and godliness of this sect in all  transactions.    Let us return to our original topic. During the period of their sojourn in  'Iraq these persons became notorious throughout the world. For exile  resulted in fame, in such wise that a great number of other parties sought  alliance and union, and devised means of [acquiring] intimacy [with them].  But the Chief of this sect, discovering the aims of each faction, acted  with the utmost consistency, circumspection, and firmness. Reposing  confidence in none, He applied Himself as far as possible to the  admonition of each, inciting and urging them to good resolutions and aims  beneficial to the state and the nation. And this conduct and behavior of  the Chief acquired notoriety in 'Iraq.    So likewise during the period of their sojourn in 'Iraq certain  functionaries of foreign governments were desirous of intimacy, and sought  friendly relations [with them], but the Chief would not agree. Amongst  other strange haps was this, that in 'Iraq certain of the Royal Family  came to an understanding with these [foreign] governments, and, [induced]  by promises and threats, conspired with them. But this sect unloosed their  tongues in reproach and began to admonish them, saying, \"What meanness is  this, and what evident treason; that man should, for worldly advantages,  personal profit, easy circumstances, or protection of life and property,  cast himself into this great detriment and evident loss, and embark in a  course of action which will conduce to the greatest abasement and involve  the utmost infamy and disgrace both here and hereafter! One can support  any baseness save treason to one's country, and every sin admits of pardon  and forgiveness save [that of] dishonoring one's government and injuring  one's nation.\" And they imagined that they were acting patriotically,  displaying sincerity and loyalty, and accounting sacred the duties of  fidelity; which noble aim they regarded as a moral obligation. So rumors  of this were spread abroad through 'Iraq-i-'Arab, and such as wished well  to their country loosed their tongues in uttering thanks, expressing  approval and respect. And it was supposed that these events would be  represented in the Royal Presence; but after a while it became known that  certain of the _Sh_ay_kh_s at the Supreme Shrines who were in  correspondence with the court, yea, even with the King, were in secret  continually attributing to this sect strange affinities and relations,  imagining that such attempts would conduce to favor at the Court and cause  advancement of [their] condition and rank. And since no one could speak  freely on this matter at that court which is the pivot of justice, whilst  just ministers aware [of the true state of the case] also regarded silence  as their best policy, the 'Iraq question, through these misrepresentations  and rumors, assumed gravity in Tihran, and was enormously exaggerated. But  the consuls-general, being cognizant of the truth, continued to act with  moderation, until Mirza Buzurg _Kh_an of Qazvin became consul-general in  Ba_gh_dad. Now since this person was wont to pass the greater portion of  his time in a state of intoxication and was devoid of foresight, he became  the accomplice and confederate of those _Sh_ay_kh_s in 'Iraq, and girded  up his loins stoutly to destroy and demolish. Such power of description  and [strength] of fingers as he possessed he employed in making  representations and statements. Each day he secretly wrote a dispatch to  Tihran, made vows and compacts with the _Sh_ay_kh_s, and sent diplomatic  notes to His Excellency the Ambassador-in-chief [at Constantinople]. But  since these statements and depositions had no basis or foundation, they  were all postponed and adjourned; until at length these _Sh_ay_kh_s  convened a meeting to consult with the [Consul-] General, assembled a  number of learned doctors and great divines in the [mosque of the] 'two  Kazims' (upon them be peace), and, having come to an unanimous agreement,  wrote to the divines of Karbila the exalted and Najaf the most noble,  convoking them all. They came, some knowing, others not knowing. Amongst  the latter the illustrious and expert doctor, the noble and celebrated  scholar, the seal of seekers after truth, _Sh_ay_kh_ Murtada, now departed  and assoiled, who was the admitted chief of all, arrived without knowledge  [of the matter in hand]. But, so soon as he was informed of their actual  designs, he said, \"I am not properly acquainted with the essential  character of this sect, nor with the secret tenets and hidden theological  doctrines of this community; neither have I hitherto witnessed or  perceived in their demeanor or conduct anything at variance with the  Perspicuous Book which would lead me to pronounce them infidels. Therefore  hold me excused in this matter, and let him who regards it as his duty  take action.\" Now the design of the _Sh_ay_kh_s and the Consul was a  sudden and general attack, but, by reason of the noncompliance of the  departed _Sh_ay_kh_, this scheme proved abortive, resulting, indeed, only  in shame and disappointment. So that concourse of _Sh_ay_kh_s, doctors,  and common folk which had come from Karbila dispersed.    Just at this time mischievous persons--[including] even certain dismissed  ministers--endeavored on all sides so to influence this sect that they  might perchance alter their course and conduct. From every quarter lying  messages and disquieting reports continually followed one another in  uninterrupted and constant succession to the effect that the deliberate  intention of the court of Persia was the eradication, suppression,  annihilation, and destruction of this sect; that correspondence was  continually being carried on with the local authorities; and that all [the  Babis] in 'Iraq would shortly be delivered over with bound hands to  Persia. But the Babis passed the time in calmness and silence, without in  any way altering their behavior and conduct.    So when Mirza Buzurg _Kh_an failed to effect and accomplish the designs of  his heart by such actions also, he ill-advisedly fell to reflecting how he  might grieve and humiliate [the Babis]. Every day he sought"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19312"],[0,"Tablets of Abdul-Baha Abbas (#10)"],[1,"was  received and proved a source of joy. Thank God, the beloved of that city,  in perfect unity, love and oneness, held the new election and were  confirmed and strengthened to elect such holy souls as are near the divine  Threshold and known by the republic of the beloved to be firm and  steadfast in the Covenant.    Now they (the members of Spiritual Meeting) must, in perfect spirit and  fragrance, in sincerity of heart, in attraction by the fragrances of God  and by the confirmations of the Holy Spirit, engage in service; in the  promotion of the Word of God; the diffusion of the fragrances of God; the  training of the souls; the promulgation of the most great peace. They must  raise the Banner of Guidance and become the host of the Supreme Concourse.    Indeed, blessed souls have been elected. When I read their names,  spiritual joy was immediately realized, for, praise be to God! certain  souls have appeared in that continent who are servants of the kingdom,  self-sacrificing ones of the Peerless Majesty.    O ye friends of mine! Illuminate the meeting with the light of the love of  God, make it joyful and happy through the melody of the Kingdom of  holiness, and with heavenly food and through the \"Lord's Supper\"(21)  confer life.    Congregate in the utmost of joy and happiness and commence with this  commune:    O Lord of the Kingdom! Although we are assembled, yet we are Thy scattered  ones; captives of Thy Shining Face. Although we are incapable, yet we  anticipate the manifestation of Thy strength and ability. Although we are  without capital and commodity, yet we are aided by the treasury of the  Kingdom. Although we are a drop, yet we emanate from Thy sea of seas.  Although we are an atom, yet we are illumined by Thy most bright Sun.    O Lord! Confirm us so that each one in this gathering become a bright  candle, a witness of the meeting, a caller to the Kingdom; that the world  of matter become the mirror of heaven.    O ye dear friends of mine! The assemblies of those regions must be  connected with one another and must communicate (correspond) with each  other. Even communicate with the assemblies of the East, so that this may  become the means of the great unity and concord.    O ye spiritual friends! Firmness (constancy) must reach a degree that if  all the souls (Bahais) be destroyed by the evil wishers and there remain  but one, that one singly and alone should be capable of withstanding all  who live on earth, and of spreading the fragrances of holiness.    Therefore, when any terrible new or calamitous tidings reach you from the  land of desire (Acca), ye should not grow cold, sad, or be affected  thereby. Nay, rather, ye must immediately in the utmost firmness, arise  for the service of the Kingdom.    This servant of the Threshold of His Majesty the eternal God, hath always  been and is in danger; there hath never been a hope for rest. The utmost  of his hopes is that in the arena of martyrdom the cup of grace become  replete and the wine of great bounty lend the wondrous ecstasy. This is  the utmost of my hopes and desires.    The Tablets of Israghat, Tarazat, Bescharat, Tajaliat and Kalamat,(22)  according to what is heard have been translated and printed in those  regions. Hasten to become imbued with the qualifications and attributes  set forth therein.    And this letter(23) will close with reverential greetings, in the utmost  kindliness, from me to the beloved ones and to the maid-servants of the  Merciful.          \"*** Thou has written concerning the Board of...\"      (24) *** Thou has written concerning the Board of Consultation.    It is very proper thou shouldst exert thyself with heart and soul so that  this assembly shall become a source of merciful events, and enter the  shadow of the protection and preservation of His Highness, the One God.  The more this gains strength and becomes effective, the greater will  become the penetration of the Word of God, and the more will the doors of  confirmation be opened.    As to the Assembly of Teaching, the revered members of which are the  maid-servants of the Merciful, they are also assisted by the help and the  providence of the Beauty of El-ABHA. They will soon discover that they are  strengthened by the invisible hosts, and rendered successful by the  abundant bounty of the Kingdom of the Forgiving Lord. They will set such a  flame to the regions as will kindle the heart of the universe, and will  cause the pillars of the world to tremble. But all of their mention and  thought in their meeting should be confined to teaching the truth, and to  constantly persuade people in pure and divine brilliancy and in absolute  godlike spirituality. They should not interfere with the affairs which  have regard to the Board of Consultation, because confusion of thought  conduces to division and causes disturbance to the mind, and then pure  spirituality would cease. But if all mentions are turned into one mention,  and all thoughts concentrated in one point, then man will find (a higher)  spirit, and witness (a higher) confirmation. His power and penetration  will increase, and his armies and hosts will gain successive victories. By  this it is intended that the assembly of the maid-servants of the Merciful  should be with pure spirituality and with absolute brilliancy, and become  a torch of that blessed fire, a center of the merciful feelings.    The Assembly of Teaching is in this day of the first importance, and is  promised to be assisted and protected through the assistance of His  Highness, the One God.    Announce infinite glad-tidings to the revered maid-servants of God--the  members of the merciful assembly, so that they may arise with the utmost  tranquillity (to further) prosperity and success, because Abdul-Baha is  their strong and firm assistant through the help and the providence of the  Lord of Hosts.    Concerning organizing Houses of Justice of men and Assemblies of Teaching  of maid-servants of God, the more endeavor is made, the more agreeable it  will be. It is very useful. Likewise, electing men and women teachers, and  their traveling and journeying in all parts, and their going and coming in  cities and villages, is greatly conducive to the solidity of the Cause.***          \"O ye leaves of the Paradise of El-ABHA, and the maid-servants...\"      O ye leaves(25) of the Paradise of El-ABHA, and the maid-servants of the  Merciful!    Verily, I read your words of thanksgiving to God, and of celebrating the  praise of God, for that He hath illuminated your faces with the lights of  guidance, hath transfigured Himself on your hearts with the bounties of  spirit, and hath made you as lofty and magnificent trees bearing ripened  fruits in the Paradise of El-ABHA. These signs will surely become manifest  in your faces, these lights will shine within your hearts, the splendor of  oneness will envelop you, and your brows will glitter with rays shining  from the Kingdom of El-ABHA.    O maid-servants of the Merciful! Know that, verily, this day is the day of  teaching, this day is the day of diffusing the fragrances of God, being  severed from aught else save God, attracted to the Word of God, and  clinging to the Covenant of God. There is no work greater than this. Be ye  entirely spiritual, purely brilliant, cut your dependence from any other  mention, thought or purpose, and confine your mentions, thoughts and  occupations to spreading the fragrances of God, and devote your attention  to this great work. By God, the True One, verily, the Sun of Truth will  cast forth its lights in your assemblies and will make you shining lamps,  glittering stars, brilliant signs, and as souls attracted to the Holy  Spirit. This is the great prosperity! This is the manifest light!    Upon you be greeting and praise!          \"When you assemble in the meeting of teaching (the...\"      When you assemble in the meeting of teaching (the truth), it is incumbent  on you to chant the following supplication and commune:    O God, O God! We are Thy humble and submissive servants, leaves of Thine  exalted and verdant paradise, drops from the basins of Thine abundant  mercy, and scattered particles flying about in Thy shining rays.    O Lord, O Lord, render us successful through Thy conquering power, in that  which Thou lovest and approvest, so that we may become standards of  guidance, signs of Thy Kingdom, the El-ABHA [and that we may] adore Thee,  supplicate before the Kingdom of Thy mercy, beseech Thy realm of might, be  submissive to Thy servants, humble before Thy maid-servants, severed from  aught else save Thee, sincerely turned unto Thy face, aflame with the fire  of Thy love, diffusing Thy fragrances, united in Thy Cause, of one accord  in Thy religion, and firm in Thy Covenant. O God, strengthen us through  the fragrances of Thy sanctity, that we may become sanctified from the  stain of egotism and lust, baptized with Thy Holy Spirit, with the fire of  Thy love and the water of Thy bounty.    Verily, Thou art the Bestower, the Assister, the Confirmer, the  Beneficent, the Merciful!          \"O ye verdant and flourishing leaves of the Blessed...\"      O ye verdant and flourishing leaves(26) of the Blessed Tree!    Verily, I read your letter, which expressed your spiritual attraction to  the fragrances of God, your service to the Cause of God, your firmness in  the Covenant of God, your joy in this blessed and great day, your union  and harmony in the religion of God, your happiness in diffusing the light  of the knowledge of God, and your work in the Vineyard of God--the Paradise  of El-ABHA. Such prosperity, success, blessing and salvation behooveth one  like you! Blessed are ye, O ye stars who are beaming with the light of the  love of God! Blessed are ye, O ye lamps lighted with the fire of the love  of God! Blessed ye are, O ye who are attracted to the Kingdom of God!  Glad-tidings be unto you, O you who are severed from aught"]]]
