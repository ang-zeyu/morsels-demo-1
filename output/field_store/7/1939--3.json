[Illustration: THE PYRAMIDS OF GHIZEH FROM THE DESERT.]    In speaking of the pyramids it is always the pyramids of Ghizeh which  are meant, for though there are a great many other pyramids in Egypt  these are the largest, and being built upon the desert plateau, form  such a commanding group that they dominate the landscape for miles  around. All visitors to Egypt, moreover, are not able to go up the  Nile or become acquainted with the temples, but everyone sees the  pyramids and sphinx, which are close to Cairo, and easily reached by  electric car, so to the great majority of people who visit the country  they represent not only the antiquity of Egypt, but of the world.    The great pyramid of Cheops, though commenced in 3733 B.C.,  is not the oldest monument in Egypt; the step pyramid of Sakkara is of  earlier date, while the origin of the sphinx is lost in obscurity. The  pyramid, however, is of immense size, and leaves an abiding  impression upon the minds of everyone who has seen it, or climbed its  rugged sides. Figures convey little, I am afraid, but when I tell you  that each of its sides was originally 755 feet in length and its  height 481 feet, or 60 feet higher than the cross of St. Paul's, and  that gangs of men, 100,000 in each, were engaged for twenty years in  its construction, some idea of its immensity may be formed. At one  time the pyramids were covered with polished stone, but this has all  been removed and has been used in building the mosques of Cairo, and  to-day its exterior is a series of steps, each 4 to 6 feet in height,  formed by the enormous blocks of limestone of which it is built.    Designed as a tomb, it has various interior chambers and passages, but  it was long ago ransacked by the Persians, and later by the Romans and  Arabs, so that of whatever treasure it may once have contained,  nothing now remains but the huge stone sarcophagus or coffin of the  King.    The second pyramid, built by Chephron 3666 B.C., is little  less in size, and still has a little of the outer covering at its  apex. All around these two great pyramids are grouped a number of  others, while the rock is honeycombed with tombs, and practically from  here to the first cataract the belt of rocky hills which rise so  abruptly from the Nile Valley is one continuous cemetery, only a small  portion of which has so far been explored.    Close by is the sphinx, the oldest of known monuments. Hewn out of the  solid rock, its enormous head and shoulders rise above the sand which  periodically buries it, and, battered though it has been by Mohammed  Ali's artillery, the expression of its face, as it gazes across the  fertile plain towards the sunrise, is one of calm inscrutability,  difficult to describe, but which fascinates the beholder.    From the plateau on which these pyramids are built may be seen  successively the pyramids of Abousir, Sakkara, and Darshur, and  far in the distance the curious and lonely pyramid of Medun. These  are all built on the edge of the desert, which impinges on the  cultivated land so abruptly that it is almost possible to stand with  one foot in the desert and the other in the fields.    In addition to the pyramids, Sakkara has many tombs of the greatest  interest, two of which I will describe.    One is called the \"Serapeum,\" or tomb of the bulls. Here, each in its  huge granite coffin, the mummies of the sacred bulls, for so long  worshipped at Memphis, have been buried.    The tomb consists of a long gallery excavated in the rock below  ground, on either side of which are recesses just large enough to  contain the coffins, each of which is composed of a single block of  stone 13 feet by 11 by 8, and which, with their contents, must have  been of enormous weight, and yet they have been lowered into position  in the vaults without damage. The tomb, however, was rifled long ago,  and all the sarcophagi are now empty. There is one very curious fact  about this tomb which I must mention, for though below ground it is  so intensely hot that the heat and glare of the desert as you emerge  appears relatively cool.    While the Serapeum is a triumph of engineering, the neighbouring tomb  of Thi is of rare beauty, for though its design is simple, the walls,  which are of fine limestone, are covered by panels enclosing carvings  in low relief, representing every kind of agricultural pursuits, as  well as fishing and hunting scenes. The carving is exquisitely  wrought, while the various animals depicted--wild fowl, buffaloes,  antelopes, or geese--are perfect in drawing and true in action.    Close to Sakkara are the dense palm-groves of Bedrashen, which  surround and cover the site of ancient Memphis. At one time the most  important of Egypt's capitals, Memphis has almost completely  disappeared into the soft and yielding earth, and little trace of the  former city now remains beyond a few stones and the colossal statue of  Rameses II., one of the oppressors of Israel, which now lies prostrate  and broken on the ground.    Though there have been many ancient cities in the Delta, little of  them now remains to be seen, for the land is constantly under  irrigation, and in course of time most of their heavy stone buildings  have sunk into the soft ground and become completely covered by  deposits of mud. So, as at Memphis, all that now remains of ancient  Heliopolis, or On, is one granite obelisk, standing alone in the  fields; while at other places, such as Tamai or Bete-el-Haga near  Mansurah, practically nothing now remains above ground.    In Upper Egypt, where arable land was scarce and the desert close at  hand, the temples have generally been built on firmer foundations, and  many are still in a very perfect state of preservation, though the  majority were ruined by the great earthquake of 27 B.C.    The first temple visited on the Nile trip is Dendereh, in itself  perhaps not of the greatest historical value, as it is only about  2,000 years of age, which for Egypt is quite modern; but it has two  points of interest for all. First, its association with Cleopatra,  who, with her son, is depicted on the sculptured walls; and, secondly,  because it is in such a fine state of preservation that the visitor  receives a very real idea of what an Egyptian temple was like.    First let me describe the general plan of a temple; it is usually  approached by a series of gateways called pylons or pro-pylons, two  lofty towers with overhanging cornices, between which is the gate  itself, and by whose terrace they are connected. Between these  different pylons is generally a pro-naos, or avenue of sphinxes,  which, on either side, face the causeway which leads to the final gate  which gives entrance to the temple proper. In front of the pylons were  flag-staffs, and the lofty obelisks (one of which now adorns the  Thames Embankment) inscribed with deeply-cut hieroglyphic writing  glorifying the King, whose colossal statues were often placed between  them.    Each of the gateways, and the walls of the temple itself, are covered  with inscriptions, which give it a very rich effect, their strong  shadows and reflected lights breaking up the plain surface of the  walls in a most decorative way, and giving colour to their otherwise  plain exterior. Another point worth notice is that this succession of  gateways becomes gradually larger and more ornate, so that those  entering are impressed with a growing sense of wonder and admiration,  which is not lessened on their return when the diminishing size of the  towers serves to accentuate the idea of distance and immensity.    One of the striking features in the structure of these buildings is  that while the inside walls of tower or temple are perpendicular, the  outside walls are sloping. This was intended to give stability to the  structure, which in modern buildings is imparted by their buttresses;  but in the case of the temples it has a further value in that it adds  greatly to the feeling of massive dignity which was the main principle  of their design.    Entering the temple we find an open courtyard surrounded by a covered  colonnade, the pillars often being made in the form of statues of its  founder. This court, which is usually large, and open to the sky, was  designed to accommodate the large concourse of people which would so  often assemble to witness some gorgeous temple service, and beyond,  through the gloomy but impressive hypostyle[7] hall, lay the shrine of  the god or goddess to whom the temple was dedicated and the dark  corridors and chambers in which the priests conducted their mystic  rites.    [Footnote 7: One with a roof supported by columns.]    In a peculiar way the temple of Dendereh impresses with a sense of  mystic dignity, for though the pylons and obelisks have gone, and its  outside precincts are smothered in a mass of Roman debris, the  hypostyle hall which we enter is perhaps more impressive than any  other interior in Egypt. The massive stone roof, decorated with  illumination and its celebrated zodiac, is supported by eighteen huge  columns, each capped by the head of the goddess Hathor, to whom the  temple is dedicated, while columns and walls alike are covered with  decorative inscriptions.    Through the mysterious gloom we pass through lofty doorways, which  lead to the shrine or the many priests' chambers, which, entirely  dark, open from the corridors.    Though it has been partially buried for centuries, and the smoke of  gipsy fires has blackened much of its illuminated vault, enough of the  original colour by which columns and architraves were originally  enriched still remains to show us how gorgeous a building it once had  been.

Now Li had been brought up in  Fukien province on the seashore, and was a skilful swimmer. He dived and  splashed to his heart's content, then floated on the surface. \"It takes  me back to my boyhood,\" he cried, \"why, oh why, is it not the fashion  to swim? I'd love to live in the water all the time and yet some of my  countrymen are even more afraid than a cat of getting their feet wet.  As for me, I'd give anything to stay here for ever.\"    \"You would, eh?\" chuckled a hoarse voice just under him, and then there  was a sort of wheezing sound, followed by a loud burst of laughter. Mr.  Li jumped as if an arrow had struck him, but when he noticed the fat,  ugly monster below, his fear turned into anger. \"Look here, what do you  mean by giving a fellow such a start! Don't you know what the Classics  say about such rudeness?\"    The giant fish laughed all the louder. \"What time do you suppose I have  for Classics? You make me laugh till I cry!\"    \"But you must answer my question,\" cried Mr. Li, more and more  persistently, forgetting for the moment that he was not trying some poor  culprit for a petty crime. \"Why did you laugh? Speak out at once,  fellow!\"    \"Well, since you are such a saucy piece,\" roared the other, \"I will tell  you. It was because you awkward creatures, who call yourselves men, the  most highly civilized beings in the world, always think you understand a  thing fully when you have only just found out how to do it.\"    \"You are talking about the island dwarfs, the Japanese,\" interrupted Mr.  Li, \"We Chinese seldom undertake to do anything new.\"    \"Just hear the man!\" chuckled the fish. \"Now, fancy your wishing to stay  in the water for ever! What do you know about water? Why you're not even  provided with the proper equipment for swimming. What would you do if  you really lived here always?\"    \"What am I doing now?\" spluttered Mr. Li, so angry that he sucked in a  mouthful of water before he knew it.    \"Floundering,\" retorted the other.    \"Don't you see me swimming? Are those big eyes of yours made of glass?\"    \"Yes, I see you all right,\" guffawed the fish, \"that's just it! I see  you too well. Why you tumble about as awkwardly as a water buffalo  wallowing in a mud puddle!\"    Now, as Mr. Li had always considered himself an expert in water sports,  he was, by this time, speechless with rage, and all he could do was to  paddle feebly round and round with strokes just strong enough to keep  himself from sinking.    \"Then, too,\" continued the fish, more and more calm as the other lost  his temper, \"you have a very poor arrangement for breathing. If I am not  mistaken, at the bottom of this pond you would find yourself worse off  than I should be at the top of a palm tree. What would you do to keep  yourself from starving? Do you think it would be convenient if you had  to flop yourself out on to the land every time you wanted a bite to eat?  And yet, being a man, I doubt seriously if you would be content to take  the proper food for fishes. You have hardly a single feature that would  make you contented if you were to join an under-water school. Look at  your clothes, too, water-soaked and heavy. Do you think them suitable  to protect you from cold and sickness? Nature forgot to give you any  scales. Now I'm going to tell you a joke, so you must be sure to laugh.  Fishes are like grocery shops--always judged by their scales. As you  haven't a sign of a scale, how will people judge you? See the point, eh?  Nature gave you a skin, but forgot the outer covering, except, perhaps  at the ends of your fingers and your toes You surely see by this time  why I consider your idea ridiculous?\"    Sure enough, in spite of his recent severe attack of fever, Mr. Li had  really cooled completely off. He had never understood before what great  disadvantages there were connected with being a man. Why not make use of  this chance acquaintance, find out from him how to get rid of that  miserable possession he had called his manhood, and gain the delights  that only a fish can have? \"Then, are you indeed contented with your  lot?\" he asked finally. \"Are there not moments when you would prefer to  be a man?\"    \"I, a man!\" thundered the other, lashing the water with his tail. \"How  dare you suggest such a disgraceful change! Can it be that you do not  know my rank? Why, my fellow, you behold in me a favourite nephew of  the king!\"    \"Then, may it please your lordship,\" said Mr. Li, softly, \"I should  be exceedingly grateful if you would speak a kind word for me to your  master. Do you think it possible that he could change me in some manner  into a fish and accept me as a subject?\"    \"Of course!\" replied the other, \"all things are possible to the king.  Know you not that my sovereign is a loyal descendant of the great water  dragon, and, as such, can never die, but lives on and on and on, for  ever and ever and ever, like the ruling house of Japan?\"    \"Oh, oh!\" gasped Mr. Li, \"even the Son of Heaven, our most worshipful  emperor, cannot boast of such long years. Yes, I would give my fortune  to be a follower of your imperial master.\"    \"Then follow me,\" laughed the other, starting off at a rate that made  the water hiss and boil for ten feet around him.    Mr. Li struggled vainly to keep up. If he had thought himself a good  swimmer, he now saw his mistake and every bit of remaining pride was  torn to tatters. \"Please wait a moment,\" he cried out politely, \"I beg  of you to remember that I am only a man!\"    \"Pardon me,\" replied the other, \"it was stupid of me to forget,  especially as I had just been talking about it.\"    Soon they reached a sheltered inlet at the farther side of the pond.  There Mr. Li saw a gigantic carp idly floating about in a shallow pool,  and then lazily flirting his huge tail or fluttering his fins proudly  from side to side. Attendant courtiers darted hither and thither, ready  to do the master's slightest bidding. One of them, splendidly attired in  royal scarlet, announced, with a downward flip of the head, the approach  of the King's nephew who was leading Mr. Li to an audience with his  Majesty.    \"Whom have you here, my lad?\" began the ruler, as his nephew, hesitating  for words to explain his strange request, moved his fins nervously  backwards and forwards. \"Strange company, it seems to me, you are  keeping these days.\"    \"Only a poor man, most royal sir,\" replied the other, \"who beseeches  your Highness to grant him your gracious favour.\"        \"When man asks favour of a fish,       'Tis hard to penetrate his wish--     He often seeks a lordly dish       To serve upon his table,\"      repeated the king, smiling. \"And yet, nephew, you think this fellow is  really peaceably inclined and is not coming among us as a spy?\"    Before his friend could answer, Mr. Li had cast himself upon his knees  in the shallow water, before the noble carp, and bowed thrice, until his  face was daubed with mud from the bottom of the pool. \"Indeed, your  Majesty, I am only a poor mortal who seeks your kindly grace. If you  would but consent to receive me into your school of fishes. I would for  ever be your ardent admirer and your lowly slave.\"    \"In sooth, the fellow talks as if in earnest,\" remarked the king, after  a moment's reflection, \"and though the request is, perhaps, the  strangest to which I have ever listened, I really see no reason why I  should not turn a fishly ear. But, have the goodness first to cease your  bowing. You are stirring up enough mud to plaster the royal palace of a  shark.\"    Poor Li, blushing at the monarch's reproof, waited patiently for the  answer to his request.    \"Very well, so be it,\" cried the king impulsively, \"your wish is  granted. Sir Trout,\" turning to one of his courtiers, \"bring hither a  fish-skin of proper size for this ambitious fellow.\"    No sooner said than done. The fish-skin was slipped over Mr. Li's head,  and his whole body was soon tucked snugly away in the scaly coat. Only  his arms remained uncovered. In the twinkling of an eye Li felt sharp  pains shoot through every part of his body. His arms began to shrivel up  and his hands changed little by little until they made an excellent pair  of fins, just as good as those of the king himself. As for his legs and  feet, they suddenly began to stick together until, wriggle as he would,  Li could not separate them. \"Ah, ha!\" thought he, \"my kicking days are  over, for my toes are now turned into a first-class tail.\"    \"Not so fast,\" laughed the king, as Li, after thanking the royal  personage profusely, started out to try his new fins; \"not so fast, my  friend. Before you depart, perhaps I'd better give you a little friendly  advice, else your new powers are likely to land you on the hook of some  lucky fisherman, and you will find yourself served up as a prize of the  pond.\"    \"I will gladly listen to your lordly counsel, for the words of the Most  High to his lowly slave are like pearls before sea slugs. However, as I  was once a man myself I think I understand the simple tricks they use to  catch us fish, and I am therefore in position to avoid trouble.\"    \"Don't be so sure about it. 'A hungry carp often falls into danger,'  as one of our sages so wisely remarked. There are two cautions I would  impress upon you. One is, never, never, eat a dangling worm; no matter  how tempting it looks there are sure to be horrible hooks inside.  Secondly, always swim like lightning if you see a net, but in the  opposite direction. Now, I will have you served your first meal out of  the royal pantry, but after that, you must hunt for yourself, like every  other self-respecting citizen of the watery world.\"    After Li had been fed with several slugs, followed by a juicy worm for  dessert, and after again thanking the king and the king's nephew for  their kindness, he started forth to test his tail"]]]
