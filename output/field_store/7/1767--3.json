George was  soon dismissed.    19. It now came the turn of Albert Jenkins to be put into the room. The  other boys had been sent to their homes by different ways, and no one knew  what the experience of the other had been in the room of trial.    20. On the table stood a small round box, with a screw top to it, and  Albert, thinking it contained something curious, could not be easy without  unscrewing the top; but no sooner did he do this than out bounced an  artificial snake, full a yard long, and fell upon his arm. He started  back, and uttered a scream which brought the old gentleman to his elbow.  There stood Albert, with the bottom of the box in one hand, the top in the  other, and the snake on the floor.    21. \"Come, come,\" said the old gentleman, \"one snake is quite enough to  have in the house at a time; therefore, the sooner you are gone the  better.\" With that he dismissed him, without waiting a moment for his  reply.    22. William Smith next entered the room, and being left alone soon began  to amuse himself in looking at the curiosities around him. William was not  only curious and prying, but dishonest, too, and observing that the key  was left in the drawer of a bookcase, he stepped on tiptoe in that  direction. The key had a wire fastened to it, which communicated with an  electrical machine, and William received such a shock as he was not likely  to forget. No sooner did he sufficiently recover himself to walk, than he  was told to leave the house, and let other people lock and unlock their  own drawers.    23. The other boy was Harry Gordon, and though he was left in the room  full twenty minutes, he never during that time stirred from his chair.  Harry had eyes in his head as well as the others, but he had more  integrity in his heart; neither the dish cover, the cherries, the drawer  knob, the closet door, the round box, nor the key tempted him to rise from  his feet; and the consequence was that, in half an hour after, he was  engaged in the service of the old gentleman at Elm Tree Hall. He followed  his good old master to his grave, and received a large legacy for his  upright conduct in his service.      DEFINITIONS.--2. Lan'guished, suffered, sank away.

In 1840 the first collection of her poems was  made. In 1849 she became editor of \"Eliza Cook's Journal.\"    1.

A gentleman who had traveled in Europe, relates that he one day visited  the hospital of Berlin, where he saw a man whose exterior was very  striking. His figure, tall and commanding, was bending with age, but more  with sorrow; the few scattered hairs which remained on his temples were  white almost as the driven snow, and the deepest melancholy was depicted  in his countenance.    2. On inquiring who he was and what brought him there, he started, as, if  from sleep, and, after looking around him, began with slow and measured  steps to stride the hall, repeating in a low but audible voice, \"Once one  is two; once one is two.\"    3. Now and then he would stop, and remain with his arms folded on his  breast as if in contemplation, for some minutes; then again resuming his  walk, he continued to repeat, \"Once one is two; once one is two.\" His  story, as our traveler understood it, is as follows:    4. Conrad Lange, collector of the revenues of the city of Berlin, had long  been known as a man whom nothing could divert from the paths of honesty.  Scrupulously exact in an his dealings, and assiduous in the discharge of  all his duties, he had acquired the good will and esteem of all who knew  him, and the confidence of the minister of finance, whose duty it is to  inspect the accounts of all officers connected with the revenue.    5. On casting up his accounts at the close of a particular year, he found  a deficit of ten thousand ducats. Alarmed at this discovery, he went to  the minister, presented his accounts, and informed him that he did not  know how it had arisen, and that he had been robbed by some person bent on  his ruin.    6. The minister received his accounts, but thinking it a duty to secure a  person who might probably be a defaulter he caused him to be arrested, and  put his accounts into the hands of one of his secretaries for inspection,  who returned them the day after with the information that the deficiency  arose from a miscalculation; that in multiplying, Mr. Lange had said, once  one is two, instead of once one is one.    7. The poor man was immediately released from confinement, his accounts  returned, and the mistake pointed out. During his imprisonment, which  lasted two days, he had neither eaten, drunk, nor taken any repose; and  when he appeared, his countenance was as pale as death. On receiving his  accounts, he was a long time silent; then suddenly awaking, as if from a  trance, he repeated, \"Once one is two.\"    8. He appeared to be entirely insensible of his situation; would neither  eat nor drink, unless solicited; and took notice of nothing that passed  around him. While repeating his accustomed phrase, if anyone corrected him  by saying, \"Once one is one,\" his attention was arrested for a moment, and  he said, \"Ah, right, once one is one;\" and then resuming his walk, he  continued to repeat, \"Once one is two.\" He died shortly after the traveler  left Berlin.    9. This affecting story, whether true or untrue, obviously abounds with  lessons of instruction. Alas! how easily is the human mind thrown off its  balance; especially when it is stayed on this world only, and has no  experimental knowledge of the meaning of the injunction of Scripture, to  cast all our cares upon Him who careth for us, and who heareth even the  young ravens when they cry.      DEFINITIONS.--1. Ex-te'ri-or, outward appearance. De-pict'ed, painted,  represented. 3. Con-tem-pla'tion, continued attention of the mind to one  subject. 4. Rev'e-nues, the annual income from taxes, public rents, etc.  Scru'pu-lous-ly, carefully. As-sid'u-ous, constant in attention.  Fi-nance', the income of a ruler or a state. Def'i-cit, lack, want.  Duc'at, a gold coin worth about $2.00. 6. De-fault'er, one who fails to  account for public money intrusted to his care. 9. Ob'vi-ous-ly, plainly.  In-junc'tion, a command.        X. ROBIN REDBREAST.    William Allingham (b. 1828, d. 1889) was born at Ballyshannon, Ireland.  His father was a banker, and gave him a good education in Irish schools.  He showed his literary tastes at an early date, contributing to  periodicals, etc. In 1850 he published his first volume of poems; in 1854  his \"Day and Night Songs\" appeared, and in 1864 a poem in twelve chapters  entitled \"Lawrence Bloomfield in Ireland,\" His reputation was established  chiefly through his shorter lyrics, or ballad poetry. In 1864 he received  a literary pension.    1. Good-by, good-by to Summer!       For Summer's nearly done;     The garden smiling faintly,       Cool breezes in the sun;     Our thrushes now are silent,       Our swallows flown away,--     But Robin's here in coat of brown,       And scarlet brestknot gay.     Robin, Robin Redbreast,       O Robin dear!     Robin sings so sweetly       In the falling of the year.    2. Bright yellow, red, and orange,       The leaves come down in hosts;     The trees are Indian princes,       But soon they'll turn to ghosts;     The leathery pears and apples       Hang russet on the bough;     It's autumn, autumn, autumn late,       'T will soon be winter now.     Robin, Robin Redbreast,       O Robin dear!     And what will this poor Robin do?       For pinching days are near.    3. The fireside for the cricket,       The wheat stack for the mouse,     When trembling night winds whistle       And moan all round the house.     The frosty ways like iron,       The branches plumed with snow,--     Alas! in winter dead and dark,       Where can poor Robin go?     Robin, Robin Redbreast,       O Robin dear!     And a crumb of bread for Robin,       His little heart to cheer.    Note.--The Old World Robin here referred to is quite different in  appearance and habits from the American Robin. It is only about half the  size of the latter. Its prevailing color above is olive green, while the"]]]
