He had a  far-reaching voice--he had fire and go.    \"Here's the fellow to look out for!\" said the policemen; and, sure  enough, suddenly the dread word \"theatre\" was tossed into the air, and  every one was still in a moment, waiting for--what?  I don't know what  they hoped for--I do know what many feared; but this is what he said:  \"Yes, look over at our theatre and think of the little body of men and  women there, who are to-day sore-hearted and cast down; who feel that  they are looked at askant, because one of their number has committed  that hideous crime!  Think of what they have to bear of shame and  horror, and spare them, too, a little pity!\"    He paused.  It had been a bold thing to do--to appeal for  consideration for actors at such a time.  The crowd swayed for a  moment to and fro, a curious growling came from it, and then all heads  turned toward the theatre.  A faint cheer was given, and afterward  there was not the slightest allusion made to us--and verily we were  grateful.    That the homely, tender-hearted \"Father Abraham\"--rare combination of  courage, justice, and humanity--died at an actor's hand will be a  grief, a horror, and a shame to the profession forever; yet I cannot  believe that John Wilkes Booth was \"the leader of a band of bloody  conspirators.\"    Who shall draw a line and say: here genius ends and madness begins?  There was that touch of--strangeness.  In Edwin it was a profound  melancholy; in John it was an exaggeration of spirit--almost a  wildness.  There was the natural vanity of the actor, too, who craves  a dramatic situation in real life.  There was his passionate love and  sympathy for the South--why, he was \"easier to be played on than a  pipe.\"    Undoubtedly he conspired to kidnap the President--that would appeal to  him; but after that I truly believe he was a tool--certainly he was no  leader.  Those who led him knew his courage, his belief in Fate, his  loyalty to his friends; and, because they knew these things, he drew  the lot, as it was meant he should from the first.  Then, half mad, he  accepted the part Fate cast him for--committed the monstrous crime,  and paid the awful price.  And since         God moves in a mysterious way       His wonders to perform,    we venture to pray for His mercy upon the guilty soul who may have  repented and confessed his manifold sins and offences during those  awful hours of suffering before the end came.    And \"God shutteth not up His mercies forever in displeasure!\"  We can  only shiver and turn our thoughts away from the bright light that went  out in such utter darkness.  Poor, guilty, unhappy John Wilkes Booth!        WHEN IN MY HUNT FOR A LEADING MAN FOR MR. DALY I FIRST SAW COGHLAN AND  IRVING    [From \"Life of a Star\" copyright by the S. S. McClure Company, New  York, 1906.]    When the late Mr. Augustin Daly bestowed even a modicum of his  confidence, his friendship, upon man or woman, the person so honoured  found the circulation of his blood well maintained by the frequent and  generally unexpected demands for his presence, his unwavering  attention, and sympathetic comprehension.  As with the royal  invitation that is a command, only death positive or threatening could  excuse non-attendance; and though his friendship was in truth a  liberal education, the position of even the humblest confidant was no  sinecure, for the plans he loved to describe and discuss were not  confined to that day and season, but were long, daring looks ahead;  great coups for the distant, unborn years.    The season had closed on Saturday.  Monday I was to sail for England,  and early that morning the housemaid watched for the carriage.  My  landlady was growing quivery about the chin, because I had to cross  alone to join Mr. and Mrs. James Lewis, who had gone ahead, My mother  was gay with a sort of crippled hilarity that deceived no one, as she  prepared to go with me to say good bye at the dock, while little Ned,  the son of the house, proudly gathered together rug, umbrella,  hand-bag, books, etc., ready to go down with us and escort my mother  back home--when a cab whirled to the door and stopped.    \"Good heaven!\" I cried, \"what a blunder!  I ordered a carriage; we  can't all crowd into that thing!\"    Then a boy was before me, holding out one of those familiar summoning  half-sheets, with a line or two of the jetty-black, impishly-tiny,  Daly scrawls--and I read: \"Must see you one minute at office.  Cabby  will race you down.  Have your carriage follow and pick you up here.  Don't fail!  A. DALY.\"    Ah, well!  A. Daly--he who must be obeyed--had me in good training.  I  flung one hand to the mistress, the other to the maid in farewell,  pitched headlong into the cab, and went whirling down Sixth Avenue and  across to the theatre stage-door, then upstairs to the morsel of space  called by courtesy the private office.    Mr. Daly nonchalantly held out his band, looked me over, and said:  \"That's a very pretty dress--becoming too--but is it not too easily  soiled?  Salt water you know is--\"    \"Oh,\" I broke in, \"it's for general street wear--my travelling will be  done in nightdress, I fancy.\"    \"Ah, bad sailor, eh?\" he asked, as I stood trembling with impatience.    \"The worst!  But you did not send for me to talk dress or about my  sailing qualities?\"    \"My dear,\" he said suavely, \"your temper is positively rabid.\"  Then  he glanced at the clock on his desk and his manner changed.  He said  swiftly and curtly: \"Miss Morris, I want you to go to every theatre in  London, and--\"    \"But I can't!\" I interrupted, \"I have not money enough for that and my  name is not known over there!\"    He frowned and waved his hand impatiently.  \"Use my name, then, or ask  courtesy from E. A. Sothern.  He crosses with you and you know him.  But mind, go to every reputable theatre, and,\" impressively, \"report  to me at once if you see any leading man with exceptional ability of  any kind.\"    I gasped.  It seemed to me I heard the leaden fall of my heart.  \"But  Mr. Daly, what a responsibility!  How on earth could I judge an actor  for you?\"    He held up an imperative band.  \"You think more after my own manner  than any other person I know of.  You are sensitive, responsive, quick  to acknowledge another's ability, and so are fitted to study London's  leading men for me!\"    I was aghast, frightened to the point of approaching tears!  Suddenly  I bethought me.    \"I'11 tell Mr. Lewis.  He is there already you know, and let him judge  for you.\"    \"Lewis?  Good Lord!  He has no independence!  He'd see in an actor  just what he thought I wanted him to see!  I tell you, I want you to  sort over London's leading men, and, if you see anything exceptional,  secure name and theatre and report to me.  Heavens knows, two long  years have not only taught me that you have opinions, but the courage  of them!\"    Racing steps came up the stairs, and little Ned's voice called:  \"Miss  Clara.  Miss Clara, We are here!\"    I turned to Mr. Daly and said mournfully:    \"You have ruined the pleasure of my trip.\"    \"Miss Morris, that's the first untruth you ever told me.  Here,  please\" and he handed me a packet of new books.    \"Thanks!\" I cried and then flew down the stairs.  Glancing up, I saw  him looking earnestly after me.  \"Did you speak?\" I asked hurriedly.    \"That gown fits well--don't spoil it with sea-water!\"    And half-laughing, half-vexed, but wholly frightened at the charge  laid upon me, I sprang into the carriage, to hold hands with mother  all the way down to the crowded dock.    One day I received in London this note from Mr. Augustin Daly:    \"MY DEAR MISS MORRIS:  I find no letter here.  Impatiently, A. D.\"    And straightway I answered:    \"MY DEAR MR. DALY:  I find no actor here.  Afflictedly, C. M.\"    And lo, on my very last night in London, after our return from Paris,  I found the exceptional leading man.    Ten days later, on a hot September morning, I was hurling myself upon  my mother in all the joy of home-coming when I saw leaning against the  clock on the mantel the unmistakable envelope, bearing the impious  black scriggle that generally meant a summons.  I opened it and read:  \"Cleaners in full possession here--look our for soap and pails, and  report directly at box-office--don't fail!  A. DALY.\"    I confess I was angry, for I was so tired and the motion of the  steamer was still with me, and besides my own small affairs were of  more interest to me just then than the greater ones of the manager.  However, my two years of training held good.  In an hour I was picking  my way across wet floors, among mops and pails toward the sanity and  dry comfort of Mr. Daly's office.  He held my hands closely for a  moment, then broke out complainingly:  \"You've behaved  nicely,  haven't you?  Not a single line sent to tell what you were seeing,  doing, thinking?\"    \"I beg your pardon--I distinctly remember sending you a line.\"  He  scowled blackly.  I went on: \"I thought your note to me was meant as a  model, so I copied it carefully.\"    Formerly this sort of thing had kept us at daggers drawn, but now he  only laughed, and shaking his hand impatiently to and fro, said: \"Stop  it! ah, stop it!  So you could not find even one leading man worth  while, eh?\"    \"Yes--just one!\"    \"Then why on earth didn't you write me?\"    \"Couldn't--I only found him on our last night in London.\"    Mr. Daly's face was alight in a moment.  He caught up a scrap of paper  and a pencil, and, after the manner of the inexperienced interviewer,  began:  \"What's he like?\"    \"Tall, flat-backed, square-shouldered, free-moving, and wears a long  dress-coat--that shibboleth of a gentleman--as if that had been his  custom since ever he left his mother's knee.\"    Mr. Daly ejaculated \"good!\" at each clause, and scribbled his impish  small scribble on the bit of paper which rested on his palm.    \"What"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17024"],[0,"The Last Journals of David Livingstone, in Central Africa, from 1865 to His (#10)"],[1," Mamohela is the native name, Mount Bombola  stands two miles from it north, and Mount Bolunkela is north-east the  same distance. Wood, water, and grass, the requisites of a camp abound,  and the Manyuema bring large supplies of food every day; forty large  baskets of maize for a goat; fowls and bananas and nyumbo very cheap.    _25th March, 1870._--Iron bracelets are the common medium of exchange,  and coarse beads and cowries: for a copper bracelet three large fowls  are given, and three and a half baskets of maize; one basket three feet  high is a woman's load, and they are very strong.    The Wachiogone are a scattered tribe among the Maarabo or Suaheli, but  they retain their distinct identity as a people.    The Mamba fish has breasts with milk, and utters a cry; its flesh is  very white, it is not the crocodile which goes by the same name, but is  probably the Dugong or Peixe Mulher of the Portuguese(?). Full-grown  leeches come on the surface in this wet country.    Some of Katomba's men returned with forty-three tusks. An animal with  short horns and of a reddish colour is in the north; it is not known to  the Arabs(?).    Joseph, an Arab from Oman, says that the Simoom is worse in Sham  (Yemen?) than in Oman: it blows for three or four hours. Butter eaten  largely is the remedy against its ill effects, and this is also smeared  on the body: in Oman a wetted cloth is put over the head, body, and  legs, while this wind blows.    _1st May, 1870._--An elephant was killed which had three tusks; all of  good size.[7]    Rains continued; and mud and mire from the clayey soil of Manyuema were  too awful to be attempted.    _24th May, 1870._--I sent to Bambarre for the cloth and beads I left  there. A party of Thani's people came south and said that they had  killed forty Manyuema, and lost four of theirown number; nine villages  were burned, and all this about a single string of beads which a man  tried to steal!    _June, 1870._--Mohamad bin Nassur and Akila's men brought 116 tusks from  the north, where the people are said to be all good and obliging:  Akila's chief man had a large deep ulcer on the foot from the mud. When  we had the people here, Kassessa gave ten goats and one tusk to hire  them to avenge a feud in which his elder brother was killed, and they  went; the spoils secured were 31 captives, 60 goats, and about 40  Manyuema killed: one slave of the attacking party was killed, and two  badly wounded. Thani's man, Yahood, who was leader in the other case of  40 killed, boasted before me of the deed. I said, \"You were sent here  not to murder, but to trade;\" he replied, \"We are sent to murder.\" Bin  Nassur said, \"The English are always killing people;\" I replied, \"Yes,  but only slavers who do the deeds that were done yesterday.\"    Various other tribes sent large presents to the Arabs to avert assaults,  and tusks too were offered.    The rains had continued into June, and fifty-eight inches fell.    _26th June, 1870._--Now my people failed me; so, with only three  attendants, Susi, Chuma, and Gardner, I started off to the north-west  for the Lualaba. The numbers of running rivulets to be crossed were  surprising, and at each, for some forty yards, the path had been worked  by the feet of passengers into adhesive mud: we crossed fourteen in one  day--some thigh deep; most of them run into the Liya, which we crossed,  and it flows to the Lualaba. We passed through many villages, for the  paths all lead through human dwellings. Many people presented bananas,  and seemed surprised when I made a small return gift; one man ran after  me with a sugar-cane; I paid for lodgings too: here the Arabs never do.    _28th June, 1870._--The driver ants were in millions in some part of  the way; on this side of the continent they seem less fierce than I have  found them in the west.    _29th June, 1870._--At one village musicians with calabashes, having  holes in them, flute-fashion, tried to please me by their vigorous  acting, and by beating drums in time.    _30th June, 1870._--We passed through the nine villages burned for a  single string of beads, and slept in the village of Malola.    _July, 1870._--While I was sleeping quietly here, some trading Arabs  camped at Nasangwa's, and at dead of night one was pinned to the earth  by a spear; no doubt this was in revenge for relations slain in the  forty mentioned: the survivors now wished to run a muck in all  directions against the Manyuema.    When I came up I proposed to ask the chief if he knew the assassin, and  he replied that he was not sure of him, for he could only conjecture who  it was; but death to all Manyuemas glared from the eyes of half-castes  and slaves. Fortunately, before this affair was settled in their way, I  met Mohamad Bogharib coming back from Kasonga's, and he joined in  enforcing peace: the traders went off, but let my three people know,  what I knew long before, that they hated having a spy in me on their  deeds. I told some of them who were civil tongued that ivory obtained by  bloodshed was unclean evil--\"unlucky\" as they say: my advice to them  was, \"Don't shed human blood, my friends; it has guilt not to be wiped  off by water.\" Off they went; and afterwards the bloodthirsty party got  only one tusk and a half, while another party, which avoided shooting  men, got fifty-four tusks!    From Mohamad's people I learned that the Lualaba was not in the N.W.  course I had pursued, for in fact it flows W.S.W. in another great bend,  and they had gone far to the north without seeing it, but the country  was exceedingly difficult from forest and water. As I had already seen,  trees fallen across the path formed a breast-high wall which had to be  climbed over: flooded rivers, breast and neck deep, had to be crossed,  the mud was awful, and nothing but villages eight or ten miles apart.    In the clearances around these villages alone could the sun be seen. For  the first time in my life my feet failed me, and now having but three  attendants it would have been unwise to go further in that direction.  Instead of healing quietly as heretofore, when torn by hard travel,  irritable-eating ulcers fastened on both feet; and I limped back to  Bambarre on 22nd.    The accounts of Ramadan (who was desired by me to take notes as he went  in the forest) were discouraging, and made me glad I did not go. At one  part, where the tortuous river was flooded, they were five hours in the  water, and a man in a small canoe went before them sounding for places  not too deep for them, breast and chin deep, and Hassani fell and hurt  himself sorely in a hole. The people have goats and sheep, and love them  as they do children.    [Fairly baffled by the difficulties in his way, and sorely troubled by  the demoralised state of his men, who appear not to have been proof  against the contaminating presence of the Arabs, the Doctor turns back  at this point.]    _6th July, 1870._--Back to Mamohela, and welcomed by the Arabs, who all  approved of my turning back. Katomba presented abundant provisions for  all the way to Bambarre. Before we reached this, Mohamad made a forced  march, and Moene-mokaia's people came out drunk: the Arabs assaulted  them, and they ran off.    _23rd July, 1870._--The sores on my feet now laid me up as  irritable-eating ulcers. If the foot were put to the ground, a discharge  of bloody ichor flowed, and the same discharge happened every night with  considerable pain, that prevented sleep: the wailing of the slaves  tortured with these sores is one of the night sounds of a slave-camp:  they eat through everything--muscle, tendon, and bone, and often lame  permanently if they do not kill the poor things. Medicines have very  little effect on such wounds: their periodicity seems to say that they  are allied to fever. The Arabs make a salve of bees'-wax and sulphate of  copper, and this applied hot, and held on by a bandage affords support,  but the necessity of letting the ichor escape renders it a painful  remedy: I had three ulcers, and no medicine. The native plan of support  by means of a stiff leaf or bit of calabash was too irritating, and so  they continued to eat in and enlarge in spite of everything: the  vicinity was hot, and the pain increased with the size of the wound.    _2nd August, 1870._--An eclipse at midnight: the Moslems called loudly  on Moses. Very cold.    On _17th August, 1870,_ Monanyembe, the chief who was punished by  Mohamad Bogharib, lately came bringing two goats; one he gave to  Mohamad, the other to Moenekuss' son, acknowledging that he had killed  his elder brother: he had killed eleven persons over at Linamo in our  absence, in addition to those killed in villages on our S.E. when we  were away. It transpired that Kandahara, brother of old Moenekuss, whose  village is near this, killed three women and a child, and that a trading  man came over from Kasangangaye, and was murdered too, for no reason but  to eat his body. Mohamad ordered old Kandahara to bring ten goats and  take them over to Kasangangaye to pay for the murdered man. When they  tell of each other's deeds they disclose a horrid state of bloodthirsty  callousness. The people over a hill N.N.E. of this killed a person out  hoeing; if a cultivator is alone, he is almost sure of being slain. Some  said that people in the vicinity, or hyaenas, stole the buried dead; but  Posho's wife died, and in Wanyamesi fashion was thrown out of camp  unburied. Mohamad threatened an attack if Manyuema did not cease  exhuming the dead; it was effectual, neither men nor hyaenas touched  her, though exposed now for seven days.    The head of Moenekuss is said to be preserved in a pot in his house, and  all public matters are gravely communicated to it, as if his spirit  dwelt therein: his body was eaten, the flesh was removed from the head  and eaten too; his father's head is said to be kept also: the foregoing  refers to Bambarre alone.
