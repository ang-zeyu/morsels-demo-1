Nala thus bereft of kingdom--with his wife to slavery sunk,      Forth king Bhima sent the Brahmins--Nala through the world to seek.      Thus the royal Bhima charged them--with abundant wealth supplied:--      \"Go ye now and seek king Nala--Damayanti seek, my child:      And, achieved this weighty business--found Nishadha's royal lord,      Whosoe'er shall hither bring them--shall a thousand kine receive;      And a royal grant for maintenance[109]--of a village like a town.      If nor hither Damayanti--nor king Nala may be brought,      Know we where they are, rich guerdon--still we give, ten hundred kine.\"      Thus addressed, the joyful Brahmins--went to every clime of earth,      Through the cities, through the kingdoms--seeking Nala and his queen:      Nala, or king Bhima's daughter--in no place might they behold.      Then a Brahmin, named Sudeva--came to pleasant Chedi-pur;      There within the kingly palace--he Vidarbha's daughter saw,      Standing with the fair Sunanda--on a royal holiday.[110]      With her beauty once so peerless--worthy now of little praise,      Like the sun-light feebly shining--through the dimness of a cloud.      Gazing on the large-eyed princess--dull in look, and wasted still,      Lo, he thought, king Bhima's daughter--pondering thus within his mind.--        SUDEVA _spake_.        \"Even as once I wont to see her--such is yonder woman's form,      I my work have done, beholding--like the goddess world-adored,      Like the full moon, darkly beauteous--with her fair and swelling breasts,      Her, the queen, that with her brightness--makes each clime devoid of gloom,      With her lotus eyes expanding--like Manmatha's queen divine;[111]      Like the moonlight in its fulness--the desire of all the world.      From Vidarbha's pleasant waters--her by cruel fate plucked up,      [112]Like a lotus flower uprooted--with the mire and dirt around:      Like the pallid night, when Rahu[113]--swallows up the darkened moon:      For her husband wan with sorrow--like a gentle stream dried up;      Like a pool, where droops the lotus--whence the affrighted birds have fled,      By the elephant's proboscis--in its quiet depths disturbed.      Tender, soft-limbed, in a palace--fit, of precious stones, to dwell.      Like the lotus stem, uprooted--parched and withered by the sun.      Fair in form, in soul as generous--worthy of all bliss, unbless'd,      Like the young moon's slender crescent--in the heavens by dark clouds          veiled.      Widowed now of all love's pleasures--of her noble kin despoiled,      Wretched, bearing life, her husband--in her hope again to see.      To the unadorned, a husband[114]--is the chiefest ornament;      Of her husband if forsaken--she in splendour is not bright.      Difficult must be the trial--does king Nala, reft of her,      Still retain his wretched body--nor with sorrow pine away?      Her with her dark flowing tresses--with her long and lotus eyes,      Worthy of all joy, thus joyless--as I see, my soul is wrung.      To the furthest shore of sorrow--when will pass this beauteous queen?      To her husband reunited--as the moon's bride[115] to the moon?      Her recovering shall king Nala--to his happiness return,      King, albeit despoiled of kingdom--he his realm shall reassume;      In their age and virtues equal--equal in their noble race,      He alone of her is worthy--worthy she alone of him.      Me beseems it of that peerless--of that brave and prudent king,      To console the loyal consort--pining for her husband's sight.      Her will I address with comfort--with her moonlike glowing face.      Her with woe once unacquainted--woful now and lost in thought.\"      Thus when he had gazed and noted--all her marks, her features well,      To the daughter of king Bhima--thus the sage Sudeva spake:      \"I am named Sudeva, lady--I, thy brother's chosen friend,      By king Bhima's royal mandate--hither come in search of thee.      Well thy sire, thy royal mother--well thy noble brethren fare,      And well fare those little infants--well and happy are they both.      For thy sake thy countless kindred--sit as though of sense bereft:      Seeking thee a hundred Brahmins--now are wandering o'er the earth.\"      She no sooner knew Sudeva--Damayanti, of her kin,      Many a question asked in order--and of every friend beloved.      And the daughter of Vidarbha--freely wept, so sudden thus      On Sudeva, best of Brahmins--gazing, on her brother's friend.      Her beheld the young Sunanda--weeping, wasted with distress,      As she thus her secret converse--with the wise Sudeva held.      Thus she spake unto her mother--\"Lo, how fast our handmaid weeps,      Since her meeting with the Brahmin--who she is, thou now may'st know.\"      Forth the king of Chedi's mother--from the inner chamber went,      And she passed where with the Brahmin--that mysterious woman stood.      Them the mother queen Sudeva--bade before her presence stand;      And she asked, \"Whose wife, whose daughter--may this noble stranger be?      From her kindred how dissevered--from her husband, the soft-eyed?      Is she known to thee, O Brahmin--canst thou tell from whence she came?      This I fain would hear, and clearly--all her strange and wonderous tale.      Tell me all that hath befallen--to this heaven-formed, plainly tell.\"      Best of Brahmins, thus Sudeva--by the mother queen addressed,      All the truth of Damayanti--sitting at his ease, declared.          BOOK XVII.          \"In Vidarbha the just monarch--Bhima, in his glory dwells.      Of that king is she the daughter--Damayanti is her name;      And the raja of Nishadha--Nala, Virasena's son,      Of that king is she the consort--Punyasloka named, the Wise.      Him in play his brother worsted--spoiled of realm the king of earth:      He set forth with Damayanti--whither is unknown of men.      For the sake of Damayanti--wander we about the earth;      Till I found yon noble woman--in the palace of your son.      Like to her of mortal women--is there none, her beauty's peer;      In the midst, between her eyebrows--from her birth a lovely mole,      Dark was seen, and like a lotus--that hath vanished from my sight,      Covered over with defilement--like the moon behind a cloud.      This soft mark of perfect beauty--fashioned thus by Brahma's self,      As at change the moon's thin crescent--only dim and faintly gleams.      Yet her beauty is not faded--clouded o'er with toil and mire      Though she be, it shines apparent, like the native unwrought gold.      With that beauteous form yon woman--gifted with that lovely mole,      Instant knew I for the Princess--as the heat betrays the fire.\"        VRIHADASVA _spake_.        To Sudeva as she listened--uttering thus his strange discourse:      All the dust that mole concealing--young Sunanda washed away.      By the obscuring dust unclouded--shining out that mole appeared;      On the brow of Damayanti--like the unclouded moon in heaven.      Gazing on that mole, Sunanda--and the mother of the king,      Wept as fondly they embraced her--and an instant silent stood.      Then her tears awhile suppressing--thus the royal mother spake:      \"Thou art mine own sister's daughter--by that beauteous mole made known;      I, Oh beauteous, and thy mother--of that lofty-minded king,      Are the daughters, king Sudaman--he that in Dasarna[116] reigns;      She was wedded to king Bhima--and to Viravahu I.      In my fathers home, Dasarna--once I saw thee, newly born.      As to me thy father's lineage--is akin, so mine to thee;      Whatsoe'er my power commandeth--Damayanti, all is thine.\"        To the queen did Damayanti--in the gladness of her heart,      Having bowed in courteous homage--to her mother's sister, speak:      \"While unknown I might continue--gladly dwelt I here with thee;      Every want supplied on th' instant--guarded by thy gentle care.      Yet than even this pleasant dwelling--a more pleasant may there be;      Long a banished woman, mother!--give me leave from hence to part,      Thither where my infant children--dwell my tender little ones,      Orphaned of their sire, in sorrow--orphaned, ah, how long of me!      If thou yet wilt grant a favour--o'er all other favours dear,      To Vidarbha would I journey--quick the palanquin command.\"      \"Be it so,\" her mother's sister--joyful, instant made reply.      Guarded by a mighty army--with th' approval of her son,      Sent the queen, that happy lady--in a palanquin, by men      Borne aloft, and well provided--with all raiment, drink, and food.        Thus the princess to Vidarbha--after brief delay returned.      Her her whole assembled kindred--welcomed home with pride and joy,      All in health she found her kinsmen-and that lovely infant pair,      With her mother, with her father--and her sister troop of friends.      To the gods she paid her worship--to the Brahmins in her joy;      So the queenly Damayanti--all in noblest guise performed.      And her royal sire Sudeva--with the thousand kine made glad,      Joyous to behold his daughter,--with a village and much wealth.      There, when in her father's palace--she the quiet night had passed,      In these words the noble lady--to her mother gan to speak:      \"If in life thou would'st preserve me--mother, hear the truth I speak;      Home to bring the hero Nala--be it now thy chiefest toil.\"        Thus addressed by Damayanti--very sorrowful the queen      Clouded all her face with weeping--not a word in answer spake.      But the princess, thus afflicted--when the female train beheld,      \"Woe! oh woe!\" they shrieked together--all in pitying sadness wept.        To the mighty raja Bhima--did the queen that speech relate.      \"'Damayanti, Lo thy daughter--for her husband sits and mourns.'      Breaking through all bashful silence--thus, oh king, to me"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19533"],[0,"Stories of Great Inventors (#10)"],[1,"said, \"This young man is the greatest inventor of his age,  and a discoverer as well.\"    The Grand Trunk train-boy had proved a genius.    When twenty-six years of age, he married a young lady of Newark,  Miss Mary Stillwell.    Three years later he moved to Menlo Park.    This was twenty-four miles from New York.    It was not a pleasant place, but he hoped to work there in quiet.    He had so many visitors that he could not work.    He said, \"I think I shall fix a wire to my gate, and connect it with  a battery so that it will knock everybody over that touches it.\"    But he was really kind.    He would smile pleasantly, and explain patiently to anyone who  wished to know about his inventions.    At Menlo Park he built a great laboratory.    This was filled with batteries and machinery.    Here all the world came to see his wonderful talking machine.    It is called a phonograph.    What do you think Mr. Edison called this machine?    He said, \"I have invented a great many machines, but this is my  baby, and I expect it to grow up and support me in my old age.\"    Would you like to know the names of some of his inventions.    One is the carbon telephone.    The tasimeter measures the heat even of the far away stars.    The electric pen multiplies copies of letters and drawings.    Over sixty thousand are now in use in this country.    The automatic telegraph permits the sending of several thousand  words over the same wire in one minute.      [Illustration]    There are many others.    Do you wonder that he is called \"The Wizard of Menlo Park?\"    But his crowning discovery is the electric light.    Some gentlemen of New York put one hundred thousand dollars into Mr.  Edison's hands.    They told him to experiment until he could make a light which every  one would be glad to use.    Many had tried to do this and had not succeeded.    It is said that he tried two thousand substances for the arch in his  glass globe before he found one which suited him.    Do you know what he chose at last?    Do you remember the plant which the boys and girls of India, China,  and Japan know so well?    It is the bamboo.    And it was bamboo which Mr. Edison chose.    Oh, how glad this light made many people!    In ten cotton factories in one town were men, women, and children  working.    They worked in rooms where gas was used.    The gas injured their eyes and health.    Now in those same factories there are sixty thousand electric  lights.    The bamboo burns six hundred hours before it has to be replaced.    Would you like a picture of Mr. Edison?    Close your eyes then and think of him like this.    He is five feet ten inches high.    His face is boyish, but earnest.    He has light gray eyes.    His hair is dark, slightly gray, and falls over his forehead.    He is a pleasant man to see.    He loves his work.    For ten years he has averaged eighteen hour's work a day.    You have seen that he is not a man to give up easily.    Once an invention of his--a printing press--failed.    He took five men into the upper part of his factory.    He declared he would never come down until it worked satisfactorily.    For two days and nights, and for twelve hours more, he worked  without sleep.    He conquered the difficulty.    Then he slept thirty hours.    He often works all night.    He says he can work best when the rest of the world sleeps.    But he likes fun, too.    One day he said to his old friend, of whom he learned telegraphing,    \"Look here--I am able to send a message from New York to Boston  without any wire at all.\"    \"That is impossible,\" said his friend.    \"Oh, no, it's a new invention.\"    \"Well, how is it done?\" said Mr. McKensie.    \"By sealing it up and sending by mail,\" was the comical answer.    He has two children.    One, a girl, Mary, is nicknamed \"Dot.\"    The other, a son, Thomas, is called \"Dash.\"    Mr. Edison doesn't like to have great dinners given in his honor.    But the world gives him great honors.    At the Paris Exposition in 1881, two great rooms were filled with  his inventions.    The rooms were lighted with his lights.    He receives letters daily in French, German, Italian, Spanish,  Russian, and Turkish.    Mr. Edison says, \"Anything is possible with electricity.\"    That he is a genius, nobody can deny.    But do you suppose he could have done all these things without his  great reading, or if he had been a lazy person?             *       *       *       *       *        +--------------------------------------------------------------+      | Typographical errors corrected in text:                      |      |                                                              |      | Page 141: perserverance replaced with perseverance           |      | Page 154: betwen replaced with between                       |      | Page 155: Clemans replaced with Clemens                      |      |                                                              |      +--------------------------------------------------------------+           *       *       *       *       *"]]]
