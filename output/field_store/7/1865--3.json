I may say  that I became at once the most brilliant boy in my class. You know that  to this day I have always been the most striking figure in any circle in  which I have ever moved.\"    Ethel nodded assent. Silently watching the speaker, she saw a gleam of  the truth from afar, but still very distant and very dim.    Reginald lifted the glass against the light and gulped its contents.  Then in a lower voice he recommenced: \"Like the chameleon, I have the  power of absorbing the colour of my environment.\"    \"Do you mean that you have the power of absorbing the special virtues  of other people?\" she interjected.    \"That is exactly what I mean.\"    \"Oh!\" she cried, for in a heart-beat many things had become clear to  her. For the first time she realised, still vaguely but with increasing  vividness, the hidden causes of her ruin and, still more plainly, the  horrible danger of Ernest Fielding.    He noticed her agitation, and a look of psychological curiosity came  into his eyes.    \"Ah, but that is not all,\" he observed, smilingly. \"That is nothing. We  all possess that faculty in a degree. The secret of my strength is my  ability to reject every element that is harmful or inessential to the  completion of my self. This did not come to me easily, nor without a  struggle. But now, looking back upon my life, many things become  transparent that were obscure even to me at the time. I can now follow  the fine-spun threads in the intricate web of my fate, and discover in  the wilderness of meshes a design, awful and grandly planned.\"    His voice shook with conviction, as he uttered these words. There was  something strangely gruesome in this man. It was thus that she had  pictured to herself the high-priest of some terrible and mysterious  religion, demanding a human sacrifice to appease the hunger of his god.  She was fascinated by the spell of his personality, and listened with a  feeling not far removed from awe. But Reginald suddenly changed his tone  and proceeded in a more conversational manner.    \"The first friend I ever cared for was a boy marvellously endowed for  the study of mathematics. At the time of our first meeting at school, I  was unable to solve even the simplest algebraical problem. But we had  been together only for half a month, when we exchanged parts. It was I  who was the mathematical genius now, whereas he became hopelessly dull  and stuttered through his recitations only with a struggle that brought  the tears to his eyes. Then I discarded him. Heartless, you say? I have  come to know better. Have you ever tasted a bottle of wine that had been  uncorked for a long time? If you have, you have probably found it  flat--the essence was gone, evaporated. Thus it is when we care for  people. Probably--no, assuredly--there is some principle prisoned in  their souls, or in the windings of their brains, which, when escaped,  leaves them insipid, unprofitable and devoid of interest to us.  Sometimes this essence--not necessarily the finest element in a man's or  a woman's nature, but soul-stuff that we lack--disappears. In fact, it  invariably disappears. It may be that it has been transformed in the  processes of their growth; it may also be that it has utterly vanished  by some inadvertence, or that we ourselves have absorbed it.\"    \"Then we throw them away?\" Ethel asked, pale, but dry-eyed. A shudder  passed through her body and she clinched her glass nervously. At that  moment Reginald resembled a veritable Prince of Darkness, sinister and  beautiful, painted by the hand of a modern master. Then, for a space, he  again became the man of the world. Smiling and self-possessed, he filled  the glasses, took a long sip of the wine and resumed his narrative.    \"That boy was followed by others. I absorbed many useless things and  some that were evil. I realised that I must direct my absorptive  propensities. This I did. I selected, selected well. And all the time  the terrible power of which I was only half conscious grew within me.\"    \"It is indeed a terrible power,\" she cried; \"all the more terrible for  its subtlety. Had I not myself been its victim, I should not now find it  possible to believe in it.\"    \"The invisible hand that smites in the dark is certainly more fearful  than a visible foe. It is also more merciful. Think how much you would  have suffered had you been conscious of your loss.\"    \"Still it seems even now to me that it cannot have been an utter,  irreparable loss. There is no action without reaction. Even I--even  we--must have received from you some compensation for what you have  taken away.\"    \"In the ordinary processes of life the law of action and reaction is  indeed potent. But no law is without exception. Think of radium, for  instance, with its constant and seemingly inexhaustible outflow of  energy. It is a difficult thing to imagine, but our scientific men have  accepted it as a fact. Why should we find it more difficult to conceive  of a tremendous and infinite absorptive element? I feel sure that it  must somewhere exist. But every phenomenon in the physical world finds  its counterpart in the psychical universe. There are radium-souls that  radiate without loss of energy, but also without increase. And there are  souls, the reverse of radium, with unlimited absorptive capacities.\"    \"Vampire-souls,\" she observed, with a shudder, and her face blanched.    \"No,\" he said, \"don't say that.\" And then he suddenly seemed to grow in  stature. His face was ablaze, like the face of a god.    \"In every age,\" he replied, with solemnity, \"there are giants who attain  to a greatness which by natural growth no men could ever have reached.  But in their youth a vision came to them, which they set out to seek.  They take the stones of fancy to build them a palace in the kingdom of  truth, projecting into reality dreams, monstrous and impossible. Often  they fail and, tumbling from their airy heights, end a quixotic career.  Some succeed. They are the chosen. Carpenter's sons they are, who have  laid down the Law of a World for milleniums to come; or simple  Corsicans, before whose eagle eye have quaked the kingdoms of the earth.  But to accomplish their mission they need a will of iron and the wit of  a hundred men. And from the iron they take the strength, and from a  hundred men's brains they absorb their wisdom. Divine missionaries, they  appear in all departments of life. In their hand is gathered to-day the  gold of the world. Mighty potentates of peace and war, they unlock new  seas and from distant continents lift the bars. Single-handed, they  accomplish what nations dared not hope; with Titan strides they scale  the stars and succeed where millions fail. In art they live, the makers  of new periods, the dreamers of new styles. They make themselves the  vocal sun-glasses of God. Homer and Shakespeare, Hugo and Balzac--they  concentrate the dispersed rays of a thousand lesser luminaries in one  singing flame that, like a giant torch, lights up humanity's path.\"    She gazed at him, open-mouthed. The light had gone from his visage. He  paused, exhausted, but even then he looked the incarnation of a force no  less terrible, no less grand. She grasped the immensity of his  conception, but her woman's soul rebelled at the horrible injustice to  those whose light is extinguished, as hers had been, to feed an alien  flame. And then, for a moment, she saw the pale face of Ernest staring  at her out of the wine.    \"Cruel,\" she sobbed, \"how cruel!\"    \"What matter?\" he asked. \"Their strength is taken from them, but the  spirit of humanity, as embodied in us, triumphantly marches on.\"          XXI      Reginald's revelations were followed by a long silence, interrupted only  by the officiousness of the waiter. The spell once broken, they  exchanged a number of more or less irrelevant observations. Ethel's mind  returned, again and again, to the word he had not spoken. He had said  nothing of the immediate bearing of his monstrous power upon her own  life and that of Ernest Fielding.    At last, somewhat timidly, she approached the subject.    \"You said you loved me,\" she remarked.    \"I did.\"    \"But why, then--\"    \"I could not help it.\"    \"Did you ever make the slightest attempt?\"    \"In the horrible night hours I struggled against it. I even implored you  to leave me.\"    \"Ah, but I loved you!\"    \"You would not be warned, you would not listen. You stayed with me, and  slowly, surely, the creative urge went out of your life.\"    \"But what on earth could you find in my poor art to attract you? What  were my pictures to you?\"    \"I needed them, I needed you. It was a certain something, a rich colour  effect, perhaps. And then, under your very eyes, the colour that  vanished from your canvases reappeared in my prose. My style became more  luxurious than it had been, while you tortured your soul in the vain  attempt of calling back to your brush what was irretrievably lost.\"    \"Why did you not tell me?\"    \"You would have laughed in my face, and I could not have endured your  laugh. Besides, I always hoped, until it was too late, that I might yet  check the mysterious power within me. Soon, however, I became aware that  it was beyond my control. The unknown god, whose instrument I am, had  wisely made it stronger than me.\"    \"But why,\" retorted Ethel, \"was it necessary to discard me, like a  cast-off garment, like a wanton who has lost the power to please?\"    Her frame shook with the remembered emotion of that moment, when years  ago he had politely told her that she was nothing to him.    \"The law of being,\" Reginald replied, almost sadly, \"the law of my  being. I should have pitied you, but the eternal reproach of your  suffering only provoked my anger. I cared less for you every day, and  when I had absorbed all of you that my growth required, you were to me  as one dead, as a stranger you were.

The station bulletins--which Uncle Sam was kind enough to  carry free to all the farmers of the state--sometimes were worded so  like the Kali Company advertising that the company might have raised a  complaint of plagiarizing, but they never did. The Chilean nitrates,  which are under British control, were later introduced by similar  methods through the agency of the state agricultural experiment  stations.    As a result of all this missionary work, which cost the Kali Company  $50,000 a year, the attention of a large proportion of American farmers  was turned toward intensive farming and they began to realize the  necessity of feeding the soil that was feeding them. They grew dependent  upon these two foreign and widely separated sources of supply. In the  year before the war the United States imported a million tons of  Stassfurt salts, for which the farmers paid more than $20,000,000. Then  a declaration of American independence--the German embargo of 1915--cut  us off from Stassfurt and for five years we had to rely upon our own  resources. We have seen how Germany--shut off from Chile--solved the  nitrogen problem for her fields and munition plants. It was not so easy  for us--shut off from Germany--to solve the potash problem.    There is no more lack of potash in the rocks than there is of nitrogen  in the air, but the nitrogen is free and has only to be caught and  combined, while the potash is shut up in a granite prison from which it  is hard to get it free. It is not the percentage in the soil but the  percentage in the soil water that counts. A farmer with his potash  locked up in silicates is like the merchant who has left the key of his  safe at home in his other trousers. He may be solvent, but he cannot  meet a sight draft. It is only solvent potash that passes current.    In the days of our grandfathers we had not only national independence  but household independence. Every homestead had its own potash plant and  soap factory. The frugal housewife dumped the maple wood ashes of the  fireplace into a hollow log set up on end in the backyard. Water poured  over the ashes leached out the lye, which drained into a bucket beneath.  This gave her a solution of pearl ash or potassium carbonate whose  concentration she tested with an egg as a hydrometer. In the meantime  she had been saving up all the waste grease from the frying pan and pork  rinds from the plate and by trying out these she got her soap fat. Then  on a day set apart for this disagreeable process in chemical technology  she boiled the fat and the lye together and got \"soft soap,\" or as the  chemist would call it, potassium stearate. If she wanted hard soap she  \"salted it out\" with brine. The sodium stearate being less soluble was  precipitated to the top and cooled into a solid cake that could be cut  into bars by pack thread. But the frugal housewife threw away in the  waste water what we now consider the most valuable ingredients, the  potash and the glycerin.    But the old lye-leach is only to be found in ruins on an abandoned farm  and we no longer burn wood at the rate of a log a night. In 1916 even  under the stimulus of tenfold prices the amount of potash produced as  pearl ash was only 412 tons--and we need 300,000 tons in some form. It  would, of course, be very desirable as a conservation measure if all the  sawdust and waste wood were utilized by charring it in retorts. The gas  makes a handy fuel. The tar washed from the gas contains a lot of  valuable products. And potash can be leached out of the charcoal or from  its ashes whenever it is burned. But this at best would not go far  toward solving the problem of our national supply.    There are other potash-bearing wastes that might be utilized. The cement  mills which use feldspar in combination with limestone give off a potash  dust, very much to the annoyance of their neighbors. This can be  collected by running the furnace clouds into large settling chambers or  long flues, where the dust may be caught in bags, or washed out by water  sprays or thrown down by electricity. The blast furnaces for iron also  throw off potash-bearing fumes.    Our six-million-ton crop of sugar beets contains some 12,000 tons of  nitrogen, 4000 tons of phosphoric acid and 18,000 tons of potash, all of  which is lost except where the waste liquors from the sugar factory are  used in irrigating the beet land. The beet molasses, after extracting  all the sugar possible by means of lime, leaves a waste liquor from  which the potash can be recovered by evaporation and charring and  leaching the residue. The Germans get 5000 tons of potassium cyanide and  as much ammonium sulfate annually from the waste liquor of their beet  sugar factories and if it pays them to save this it ought to pay us  where potash is dearer. Various other industries can put in a bit when  Uncle Sam passes around the contribution basket marked \"Potash for the  Poor.\" Wool wastes and fish refuse make valuable fertilizers, although  they will not go far toward solving the problem. If we saved all our  potash by-products they would not supply more than fifteen per cent. of  our needs.    Though no potash beds comparable to those of Stassfurt have yet been  discovered in the United States, yet in Nebraska, Utah, California and  other western states there are a number of alkali lakes, wet or dry,  containing a considerable amount of potash mixed with soda salts. Of  these deposits the largest is Searles Lake, California. Here there are  some twelve square miles of salt crust some seventy feet deep and the  brine as pumped out contains about four per cent. of potassium chloride.  The quantity is sufficient to supply the country for over twenty years,  but it is not an easy or cheap job to separate the potassium from the  sodium salts which are five times more abundant. These being less  soluble than the potassium salts crystallize out first when the brine is  evaporated. The final crystallization is done in vacuum pans as in  getting sugar from the cane juice. In this way the American Trona  Corporation is producing some 4500 tons of potash salts a month besides  a thousand tons of borax. The borax which is contained in the brine to  the extent of 1-1/2 per cent. is removed from the fertilizer for a  double reason. It is salable by itself and it is detrimental to plant  life.    Another mineral source of potash is alunite, which is a sort of natural  alum, or double sulfate of potassium and aluminum, with about ten per  cent. of potash. It contains a lot of extra alumina, but after roasting  in a kiln the potassium sulfate can be leached out. The alunite beds  near Marysville, Utah, were worked for all they were worth during the  war, but the process does not give potash cheap enough for our needs in  ordinary times.    [Illustration: Photo by International Film Service    IN ORDER TO SECURE A NEW SUPPLY OF POTASH SALTS    The United States Government set up an experimental plant at Sutherland,  California, for the utilization of kelp. The harvester cuts 40 tons of  kelp at a load]    [Illustration: THE KELP HARVESTER GATHERING THE SEAWEED FROM THE  PACIFIC OCEAN]    [Illustration: Courtesy of Hercules Powder Co.    OVERHEAD SUCTION AT THE SAN DIEGO WHARF PUMPING KELP FROM THE BARGE TO  THE DIGESTION TANKS]    The tourist going through Wyoming on the Union Pacific will have to the  north of him what is marked on the map as the \"Leucite Hills.\" If he  looks up the word in the Unabridged that he carries in his satchel he  will find that leucite is a kind of lava and that it contains potash.  But he will also observe that the potash is combined with alumina and  silica, which are hard to get out and useless when you get them out. One  of the lavas of the Leucite Hills, that named from its native state  \"Wyomingite,\" gives fifty-seven per cent. of its potash in a soluble  form on roasting with alunite--but this costs too much. The same may be  said of all the potash feldspars and mica. They are abundant enough, but  until we find a way of utilizing the by-products, say the silica in  cement and the aluminum as a metal, they cannot solve our problem.    Since it is so hard to get potash from the land it has been suggested  that we harvest the sea. The experts of the United States Department of  Agriculture have placed high hopes in the kelp or giant seaweed which  floats in great masses in the Pacific Ocean not far off from the  California coast. This is harvested with ocean reapers run by gasoline  engines and brought in barges to the shore, where it may be dried and  used locally as a fertilizer or burned and the potassium chloride  leached out of the charcoal ashes. But it is hard to handle the bulky,  slimy seaweed cheaply enough to get out of it the small amount of potash  it contains. So efforts are now being made to get more out of the kelp  than the potash. Instead of burning the seaweed it is fermented in vats  producing acetic acid (vinegar). From the resulting liquid can be  obtained lime acetate, potassium chloride, potassium iodide, acetone,  ethyl acetate (used as a solvent for guncotton) and algin, a  gelatin-like gum.
