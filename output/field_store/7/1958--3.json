The bottle happening to slip out of the hand of the servant,  disclosed a row of shot wedged forcibly into the angular bent-up  circumference of it. On examining the beads of shot, they crumbled into  dust, the outer crust (defended by a coat of black lead with which the  shot is glazed) being alone left unacted on, whilst the remainder of the  metal was dissolved. The wine, therefore, had become contaminated with  _lead and arsenic_, the shot being a compound of these metals, which no  doubt had produced the mischief.\"      TEST FOR DETECTING THE DELETERIOUS ADULTERATIONS OF WINE.    A ready re-agent for detecting the presence of lead, or any other  deleterious metal in wine, is known by the name of the _wine test_. It  consists of water saturated with sulphuretted hydrogen gas, acidulated  with muriatic acid. By adding one part of it, to two of wine, or any  other liquid suspected to contain lead, a dark coloured or black  precipitate will fall down, which does not disappear by an addition of  muriatic acid; and this precipitate, dried and fused before the blowpipe  on a piece of charcoal, yields a globule of metallic lead. This test  does not precipitate iron; the muriatic acid retains iron in solution  when combined with sulphuretted hydrogen; and any acid in the wine has  no effect in precipitating any of the sulphur of the test liquor. Or a  still more efficacious method is, to pass a current of sulphuretted  hydrogen gas through the wine, in the manner described, p. 70, having  previously acidulated the wine with muriatic acid.    The wine test sometimes employed is prepared in the following  manner:--Mix equal parts of finely powdered sulphur and of slacked  quick-lime, and expose it to a red heat for twenty minutes. To  thirty-six grains of this sulphuret of lime, add twenty-six grains of  super-tartrate of potassa; put the mixture into an ounce bottle, and  fill up the bottle with water that has been previously boiled, and  suffered to cool. The liquor, after having been repeatedly shaken, and  allowed to become clear, by the subsidence of the undissolved matter,  may then be poured into another phial, into which about twenty drops of  muriatic acid have been previously put. It is then ready for use. This  test, when mingled with wine containing lead or copper, turns the wine  of a dark-brown or black colour. But the mere application of  sulphuretted hydrogen gas to wine, acidulated by muriatic acid, is a far  more preferable mode of detecting lead in wine.    M. Vogel[39] has lately recommended acetate of lead as a test for  detecting extraneous colours in red wine. He remarks, that none of the  substances that can be employed for colouring wine, such as the berries  of the Vaccinium Mirtillus (bilberries), elderberries, and Campeach  wood, produce with genuine red wine, a greenish grey precipitate, which  is the colour that is procured by this test by means of genuine red  wines.    Wine coloured with the juice of the bilberries, or elderberries, or  Campeach wood, produces, with acetate of lead, a deep blue precipitate;  and Brazil-wood, red saunders, and the red beet, produce a colour which  is precipitated red by acetate of lead. Wine coloured by beet root is  also rendered colourless by lime water; but the weakest acid brings back  the colour. As the colouring matter of red wines resides in the skin of  the grape, M. Vogel prepared a quantity of skins, and reduced them to  powder. In this state he found that they communicated to alcohol a deep  red colour: a paper stained with this colour was rendered red by acids  and green by alkalies.    M. Vogel made a quantity of red wine from black grapes, for the purpose  of his experiments; and this produced the genuine greyish green  precipitate with acetate of lead. He also found the same coloured  precipitate in two specimens of red wine, the genuineness of which could  not be suspected; the one from Chateau-Marguaux, and the other from the  neighbourhood of Coblentz.      SPECIFIC DIFFERENCES, AND COMPONENT PARTS OF WINE.    Every body knows that no product of the arts varies so much as wine;  that different countries, and sometimes the different provinces of the  same country, produce different wines. These differences, no doubt, must  be attributed chiefly to the climate in which the vineyard is  situated--to its culture--the quantity of sugar contained in the grape  juice--the manufacture of the wine; or the mode of suffering its  fermentation to be accomplished. If the grapes be gathered unripe, the  wine abounds with acid; but if the fruit be gathered ripe, the wine will  be rich. When the proportion of sugar in the grape is sufficient, and  the fermentation complete, the wine is perfect and generous. If the  quantity of sugar be too large, part of it remains undecomposed, as the  fermentation is languid, and the wine is sweet and luscious; if, on the  contrary, it contains, even when full ripe, only a small portion of  sugar, the wine is thin and weak; and if it be bottled before the  fermentation be completed, part of the sugar remains undecomposed, the  fermentation will go on slowly in the bottle, and, on drawing the cork,  the wine sparkles in the glass; as, for example, Champagne. Such wines  are not sufficiently mature. When the must is separated from the husk of  the red grape before it is fermented, the wine has little or no colour:  these are called _white_ wines. If, on the contrary, the husks are  allowed to remain in the must while the fermentation is going on, the  alcohol dissolves the colouring matter of the husks, and the wine is  coloured: such are called _red_ wines. Hence white wines are often  prepared from red grapes, the liquor being drawn off before it has  acquired the red colour; for the skin of the grape only gives the  colour. Besides in these principal circumstances, wines vary much in  flavour.    All wines contain one common and identical principle, from which their  similar effects are produced; namely, _brandy_ or _alcohol_. It is  especially by the different proportions of brandy contained in wines,  that they differ most from one another. When wine is distilled, the  alcohol readily separates. The spirit thus obtained is well known under  the name of _brandy_.    All wines contain also a free acid; hence they turn blue tincture of  cabbage, red. The acid found in the greatest abundance in grape wines,  is tartaric acid. Every wine contains likewise a portion of  super-tartrate of potash, and extractive matter, derived from the juice  of the grape. These substances deposit slowly in the vessel in which  they are kept. To this is owing the improvement of wine from age. Those  wines which effervesce or froth, when poured into a glass, contain also  carbonic acid, to which their briskness is owing. The peculiar flavour  and odour of different kinds of wines probably depend upon the presence  of a _volatile oil_, so small in quantity that it cannot be separated.      EASY METHOD OF ASCERTAINING THE QUANTITY OF BRANDY CONTAINED IN VARIOUS  SORTS OF WINE.    The strength of all wines depends upon the quantity of alcohol or brandy  which they contain. Mr. Brande, and Gay-Lussac, have proved, by very  decisive experiments, that all wines contain brandy or alcohol ready  formed. The following is the process discovered by Mr. Brande, for  ascertaining the quantity of spirit, or brandy, contained in different  sorts of wine.      EXPERIMENT.    Add to eight parts, by measure, of the wine to be examined, one part of  a concentrated solution of sub-acetate of lead: a dense insoluble  precipitate will ensue; which is a combination of the test liquor with  the colouring, extractive, and acid matter of the wine. Shake the  mixture for a few minutes, pour the whole upon a filtre, and collect the  filtered fluid. It contains the brandy or spirit, and water of the wine,  together with a portion of the sub-acetate of lead. Add, in small  quantities at a time, to this fluid, warm, dry, and pure sub-carbonate  of potash (_not salt of tartar, or sub-carbonate of potash of  commerce_), which has previously been freed from water by heat, till the  last portion added remains undissolved. The brandy or spirit contained  in the fluid will become separated; for the sub-carbonate of potash  abstracts from it the whole of the water with which it was combined; the  brandy or spirit of wine forming a distinct stratum, which floats upon  the aqueous solution of the alkaline salt. If the experiment be made in  a glass tube, from one-half inch to two inches in diameter, and  graduated into 100 equal parts, the _per centage_ of spirit, in a given  quantity of wine, may be read off by mere inspection. In this manner the  strength of any wine may be examined.      _Tabular View, exhibiting the Per Centage of Brandy or Alcohol[40]  contained in various kinds of Wines, and other fermented Liquors._[41]                   Proportion of Spirit                            per Cent.                          by measure.

This lover, who won whole nations as other men win a maid  or two; this ruler, who had popes for handmaidens and gave kingdoms as  tips, who dictated to kings preferably from the palaces of their own  capitals; this fortunate demon of a man, who had escaped even Mlle.  Montausier, was safely disposed of at Saint Helena, and the ordinary  ways of mortals had their place in the world again.    The Congress of Vienna reassembled, and the readjustment of the map of  Europe began over again. Prussia is given back what had been taken  away from her. A German confederation was formed in 1815 to resist  encroachments, but with no definite political idea, and its diet, to  which Prussia, Austria, and the other smaller states sent  representatives, became the laughing-stock of Europe. Jealous  bickerings and insistence upon silly formalities paralyzed  legislation. Lawyers and others who presented their claims before this  assembly from 1806-1816 were paid in 1843! The liquidation of the  debts of the Thirty Years' War was made after two hundred years, in  1850! The laws for the military forces were finally agreed upon in  1821, and put in force in 1840!    There were three principal forms of government among these states:  first, Absolutist, where the ruler and his officials governed without  reference to the people, as in Prussia and Austria; second, those who  organized assemblies (Landslaende), where no promises were made to the  people, but where the nobles and notables were called together for  consultation; and third, a sort of constitutional monarchy with a  written constitution and elected representatives, but with the ruler  none the less supreme. One of the first rulers to grant such a  constitution to his people was the Grand Duke who presided over the  little court at Weimar.    The mass of the people were wholly indifferent. The intellectuals were  divided among themselves. The schools and universities after 1818 form  associations and societies, the Burschenschaft, for example, and in a  hazy professorial fashion talk and shout of freedom. They were of  those passionate lovers of liberty, more intent on the dower than on  the bride; willing to talk and sing and to tell the world of their own  deserts, but with little iron in their blood.    When a real man wants to be free he fights, he does not talk; he takes  what he wants and asks for it afterward; he spends himself first and  affords it afterward. These dreamy gentlemen could never make the  connection between their assertions and their actions. They were as  inconsistent, as a man who sees nothing unreasonable in circulating  ascetic opinions and a perambulator at the same time. They were dreary  and technical advocates of liberty.    At a great festival at the Wartburg, in 1817, the students got out of  hand, burned the works of those conservatives, Haller and Kotzebue,  and the Code Napoleon. This youthful folly was purposely exaggerated  throughout Germany, and was used by the party of autocracy to frighten  the people, and also as a reason for passing even severer laws against  the ebullitions of liberty. At a conference at Carlsbad in 1819 the  representatives of the states there assembled passed severe laws  against the student societies, the press, the universities, and the  liberal professors.    From 1815-1830 the opinions of the more enlightened changed. The fear  of Napoleon was gradually forgotten, and the hatred of the absolutism  of Prussia and Austria grew.    In 1830 constitutions were demanded and were guardedly granted in  Brunswick, Saxony, Hanover, and Hesse-Cassel. In 1832 things had gone  so far that at a great student festival the black, red, and gold flag  of the Burschenschaft was hoisted, toasts were drunk to the  sovereignty of the people, to the United States of Germany, and to  Europe Republican! This was followed by further prosecutions. Prussia  condemned thirty-nine students to death, but confined them in a  fortress. The prison-cell of the famous Fritz Reuter may be seen in  Berlin to-day. In Hesse, the chief of the liberal party, Jordan, was  condemned to six years in prison; in Bavaria a journalist was  imprisoned for four years, and other like punishments followed  elsewhere. It was in 1857, when Queen Victoria came to the throne,  that Hanover was cut off from the succession, as Hanover could not  descend to a woman. The Duke of Cumberland became the ruler of  Hanover, and England ceased to hold any territory in Europe.    From 1839-1847 there was comparative quiet in the political world. The  rulers of the various states succeeded in keeping the liberal  professorial rhetoric too damp to be valuable as an explosive.    Interwoven with this party in Germany, demanding for the people  something more of representation in the government, was a movement for  the binding together of the various states in a closer union. In 1842  when the first stone was laid for the completion of the Cologne  Cathedral, at a banquet of the German princes presided over by the  King of Prussia, the King of Wuertemberg proposed a toast to \"Our  common country!\" That toast probably marks the first tangible proof of  the existence of any important feeling upon the subject of German  unity.    At a congress of Germanists at Frankfort, in 1846, professors and  students, jurists and historians, talked and discussed the questions  of a German parliament and of national unity more perhaps than matters  of scholarship.    In 1847 Professor Gervinus founded at Heidelberg the Deutsche Zeitung,  which was to be liberal, national, and for all Germany.    I should be sorry to give the impression that I have not given proper  value to the work of the German professor and student in bringing  about a more liberal constitution for the states of Germany. Liebig of  Munich, Ranke of Berlin, Sybel of Bonn, Ewald of Goettingen, Mommsen in  Berlin, Doellinger in Munich, and such men as Schiemann in Berlin to-day,  were and are, not only scholars, but they have been and are  political teachers; some of them violently reactionary, if you please,  but all of them stirring men to think.    No such feeling existed then, or exists now, in Germany, as animated  Oxford some fifty years ago when the greatest Sanscrit scholar then  living was rejected by a vote of that body, one voter declaring: \"I  have always voted against damned intellect, and I trust I always may!\"  A state of mind that has not altogether disappeared in England even  now. Indeed I am not sure, that the most notable feature of political  life in England to-day, is not a growing revolt against legislation by  tired lawyers, and an increasing demand for common-sense governing  again, even if the governing be done by those with small respect for  \"damned intellect.\"    The third French revolution of 1848 set fire to all this, not only in  Germany but in Austria, Hungary, Roumania, and elsewhere. We must go  rapidly through this period of seething and of political teething. The  parliament at Frankfort with nothing but moral authority discussed and  declaimed, and finally elected Archduke John of Austria as  \"administrator\" of the empire. There followed discussions as to  whether Austria should even become a member of the new confederation.  Two parties, the \"Little Germanists\" and the \"Pan Germanists,\" those  in favor of including, and those opposed to the inclusion of Austria,  fought one another, with Prussia leading the one and Austria, with the  prestige of having been head of the former Holy Roman Empire, the  other.    In 1849 Austria withdrew altogether and the King of Prussia was  elected Emperor of Germany, but refused the honor on the ground that  he could not accept the title from the people, but only from his  equals. There followed riots and uprisings of the people in Prussia,  Saxony, Baden, and elsewhere throughout Germany. The Prussian guards  were sent to Dresden to quell the rioting there and took the city  after two days' fighting. The parliament itself was dispersed and  moved to Stuttgart, but there again they were dispersed, and the end  was a flight of the liberals to Switzerland, France, and the United  States. We in America profited by the coming of such valuable citizens  as Carl Schurz and many others. There were driven from Germany, they  and their descendants, many among our most valuable citizens. The  descendant of one of the worthiest of them, Admiral Osterhaus, is one  of the most respected officers in our navy, and will one day command  it, and we could not be in safer hands. In 1849 the German Federal  fleet was sold at auction as useless; Austria was again in the  ascendant and German subjects in Schleswig were handed over to the  Danes.    In 1850 both the King of Prussia and the Emperor of Austria called  congresses, but Prussia finally gave up hers, and the ancient  confederation as of before 1848 met as a diet at Frankfort and from  1851-1858 Bismarck was the Prussian delegate and Austria presided over  the deliberations.    A factor that made for unity among the German states was the  Zollverein. From 1818-1853 under the leadership of Prussia the various  states were persuaded to join in equalizing their tariffs. Between  1834-5 Prussia, Bavaria, Wuertemberg, Saxony, Baden, Hesse-Nassau,  Thuringia, and Frankfort agreed upon a common standard for customs  duties, and a few years later they were joined by Brunswick, Hanover,  and the Mecklenburgs. German industry and commerce had their  beginnings in these agreements. The hundreds of different customs  duties became so exasperating that even jealous little governments  agreed to conform to simpler laws, and probably this commercial  necessity did more to bring about the unity of Germany than the King,  or politics, or the army.
