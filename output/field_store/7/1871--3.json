[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17212"],[0,"Michelangelo (#10)"],[1,"poor country  people.    The temple at Delphi was one of great celebrity. In the centre was a  small opening in the ground, whence arose an intoxicating vapor, and  over this sat the pythia, on a three-legged seat, or tripod, and  delivered the oracle communicated to her by the god. These oracles  were delivered in verse.    The Delphic sibyl, or pythia, of Michelangelo's picture, has the  splendid stature of an Amazon. Her head is draped with a sort of Greek  turban, beneath which her hair escapes in flying curls. Her face and  expression show her at once to be unlike an ordinary woman. She has  the look of a startled fawn, which has suddenly heard the call of a  distant voice. She turns her head in the attitude of one listening.  She looks far away with eyes that see visions, but what those visions  are none can guess. There are other pictures of the same sibyl  carrying a crown of thorns, showing that she predicted the sufferings  of Christ. Perhaps this is the meaning of the sorrowful expression in  these wide eyes.    The scroll which she unrolls in her left hand is the scroll of her  prophecy. The two little figures holding a book, just behind her right  shoulder, are genii, or spirits, symbolic of her inspiration. One  reads eagerly from the volume while the other listens with rapt  attention.    The picture makes a very interesting study in the composition of  lines. Starting from the topmost point of the turban, draw a line on  the right, coming across the shoulder along the outer edge of the  drapery to the toe. On the left, let the line connecting the same two  points follow the outer curve of the scroll, along the slanting edge  of the mantle, and we get a beautiful pointed oval as the basis of the  composition.    The sibyl's left arm drops a curve across the upper part of the  figure, and this curve is repeated a little lower down by the creases  in the drapery across the lap. Such are the few strong, simple lines  which compose the picture, producing an effect of grandeur which a  confusion of many lines would entirely spoil.          XII    THE CUMAEAN SIBYL      Of all the sibyls, the one we hear most about is the Cumaean. The  legend runs that, having asked a boon of Apollo, she gathered a  handful of sand and said, \"Grant me to see as many birthdays as there  are sand grains in my hand.\" The wish was gratified, but unluckily she  forgot to ask for enduring youth, so she was doomed to live a thousand  years in a withered old age. Thus we always think of her as an old  woman, as Michelangelo has represented her.    She is called the Cumaean sibyl because she is supposed to have lived  in Cumae, which was the oldest and one of the most important of the  Greek colonies in Italy. Her real name, we are told, was Demos. She  lived in a great cavern, where the people came to consult her, and her  answers to their questions were regarded as oracles, or answers from  the deities. She used to write on the leaves of trees the names and  fates of different persons, arranging them in her cave to be read by  her votaries. Sometimes the wind sweeping through the cavern scattered  the leaves broadcast through the world.    The manner of consulting her is fully described by the Latin poet  Virgil in the sixth book of the AEneid. He tells how AEneas, arriving  with his fellow voyagers at the town of Cumae, immediately goes to the  temple of Apollo,        \"And seeks the cave of wondrous size,      The sibyl's dread retreat,      The sibyl, whom the Delian seer      Inspires to see the future clear,      And fills with frenzy's heat;      The grove they enter, and behold      Above their heads the roof of gold.           *       *       *       *       *        \"Within the mountain's hollow side,      A cavern stretches high and wide;      A hundred entries thither lead;      A hundred voices thence proceed,      Each uttering forth the sibyl's rede.      The sacred threshold now they trod:      'Pray for an answer! pray! the god,'      She cries, 'the god is nigh!'        \"And as before the door in view      She stands, her visage pales its hue,      Her locks dishevelled fly,      Her breath comes thick, her wild heart glows.      Dilating as the madness grows,      Her form looks larger to the eye;      Unearthly peals her deep-toned cry,      As, breathing nearer and more near,      The god comes rushing on his seer.\"    AEneas now begs a favor of the sibyl. He has heard that here the path  leads downward to the dead, and he desires to go thither to visit his  father, Anchises. There are certain conditions to fulfil before  setting forth, but when these are done the sibyl guides him on his  way, and the journey is safely made.    [Illustration: THE CUMAEAN SIBYL. _Sistine Chapel, Rome._]    Another legend of the Cumaean sibyl has to do with the Roman emperor  Tarquin. The sibyl came to him one day with nine books of oracles,  which she wished him to buy. The price was exorbitant, and the emperor  refused her demand. She then went away, burned three of the books,  and, returning with the remaining six, made the same demand. Again her  offer was refused, and again she burned three books and returned,  still requiring the original price for the three that were left.  Tarquin now consulted the soothsayers, and, acting upon their advice,  bought the books, which were found to contain directions concerning  the religion and policy of Rome.    For many years they were held sacred, and were carefully preserved in  the temple of Jupiter in the Capitol, under the care of official  guardians. At length the temple was destroyed by fire, and the  original sibylline books perished. In the following centuries they  were replaced by scattered papers, collected from time to time in  various parts of the empire, purporting to be the writings of the  sibyl. These sibylline leaves, as they were called, contained passages  supposed to be prophetic of the coming of Christ, and this is why the  Cumaean sibyl is placed by Michelangelo among the prophets.    The sibyl is reading aloud from one of her books of oracles. The two  little genii standing behind her shoulder, and listening with absorbed  attention, hold another book, not yet unclasped, ready for her. She  reads her prophecy with keen, searching eyes, and a manner that is  almost stern. We can see in the large, strong features the  determination of her character.    It is not a gentle face, and not pleasing, but it is full of meaning.  We read there the record of the centuries which have passed over her  head, bringing her the deep secrets of life. Yet the prophecies are  still unfulfilled, and there is a look of unsatisfied longing in her  wrinkled old face.    You will notice that the outlines of the Cumaean sibyl are drawn in an  oval figure similar to that inclosing the Delphic sibyl. Here,  however, the oval is of a more elongated form, and the left side is  broken midway by the introduction of the book.    The old writer Pausanias, writing his \"Description of Greece,\" in the  second century, says that the people of Cumae showed a small stone urn  in the temple of Apollo containing the ashes of the sibyl. For many  centuries her cavern was pointed out to travellers in a rock under the  citadel of Cumae. Finally the fortifications of the city were  undermined, but to this day a subterranean passage in the rock on  which they were built is still shown as the entrance to the sibyl's  cave.          XIII    LORENZO DE' MEDICI      The statue of Lorenzo de' Medici is the central figure on the tomb  erected to the memory of this prince. He was the rather unworthy  namesake of his illustrious grandfather, who was known as Lorenzo the  Magnificent. The Medici family was for many generations the richest  and most powerful in Florence. They were originally merchants, and, as  the name signifies, physicians, and, accumulating great wealth, they  became powerful leaders, and really the rulers of the republic.    Some of them were munificent patrons of art and literature. There was  one named Cosimo, who did so much to make his city famous that he was  called _Pater Patriae_, the father of the country, as was, centuries  afterwards, our own Washington. His grandson Lorenzo won the title of  the Magnificent for his lavish generosity and superb plans for the  advancement of art and learning. So much power could not safely be in  the hands of a single family. The Medici, from being benefactors,  finally became tyrants.    The Lorenzo of this statue was one of the more insignificant members  of the family. It is said that \"he inherited the vices without the  genius of the family, and was ambitious, unscrupulous, and  dissipated. His uncle, Pope Leo X., after depriving the Duke of Urbino  of his hereditary domains, bestowed them, with the title of duke, on  Lorenzo, whom he also made general of the pontifical forces.\"[29] In  1518 Leo united him in marriage to a French princess, and their  daughter was the afterwards celebrated Catharine de' Medici, queen of  the French king, Henry II. These are the main facts in the life of a  man who is remembered only because he had illustrious ancestors, a  famous daughter, and a superb tomb.    [Footnote 29: Susan and Joanna Horner's _Walks in Florence_, vol. i. p.  125.]    It mattered nothing to Michelangelo that he had so poor a subject for  a statue. It is supposed that he made no attempt at correct  portraiture in the figure. The insignificant Lorenzo was transformed  by the magic of his genius into a hero.    He wears a suit of Roman armor, in accordance with his career as a  general in the wars with the Duke of Urbino, whose title he took. His  helmet is pulled well forward over the brow, the head is bent, the  cheek rests upon the left hand, the elbow supported on a casket placed  on the knee. With finger laid thoughtfully upon the lips, he is  thinking intently. The right hand rests, palm out, against the knee in  a characteristic"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17213"],[0,"The Future of Islam (#10)"],[1," to say, they were appointed by the Sultan,  and were made use of by him as a means of securing Mussulman  allegiance--and I believe this to have been all their real status. They  are cited, however, as in some sense sovereigns by Hanefite teachers,  whose argument it is that the succession of the Prophet has never  lapsed, or Islam been without a recognized temporal head. The Sultans,  neither of Egypt nor of India, nor till Selim's time of the Turkish  Empire, ever claimed for themselves the title of Khalifeh, nor did the  Sherifal family of Mecca, who alone of them might have claimed it  legally as Koreysh. Neither did Tamerlane nor any of the Mussulman  Mongols who reigned at Bagdad. The fact is, we may assume the Caliphate  was clean forgotten at the time Selim bethought him of it as an  instrument of power.    It must, then, have been an interesting and startling novelty with  Mussulmans to hear of this new pretender to the ancient  dignity--interesting, because the name Khalifeh was connected with so  many of the bygone glories of Islam; startling, because he who claimed  it seemed by birth incapable of doing so. The Hanefite Ulema, however,  as I have said, undertook Selim's defence, or rather that of his  successors, for Selim himself died not a year afterwards, and succeeded  in proving, to the satisfaction of the majority of Sunites, that the  house of Othman had a good and valid title to the rank they had assumed.  Their chief arguments were as follows. The house of Othman, they  asserted, ruled spiritually by--    1. _The right of the sword_, that is to say, the _de facto_ possession  of the sovereign title. It was argued that, the Caliphate being a  necessity (and this all orthodox Mussulmans admit), it was also  necessary that the _de facto_ holder of the title should be recognized  as legally the Caliph, _until a claimant with a better title should  appear_. Now the first qualification of a claimant was that he should  claim, and the second that he should be supported by a party; and Selim  had both claimed the Caliphate and supported his pretensions at the head  of an army. He had challenged the world to produce a rival, and no rival  had been found--none, at least, which the Hanefite school acknowledged,  for the Sultan of Morocco they had never accepted, and the last  descendant of the Abbasides had waived his rights. In support of the  proposition that the sword could give a title they cited the examples of  Mawiyeh, who thus established his right against the family of Ali, and  of Abu el Abbas, who had thus established his against that of Mawiyeh.    2. _Election_, that is the sanction of a legal body of Elders. It was  argued that, as the Ahl el agde had been removed from Medina to  Damascus, and from Damascus to Bagdad, and from Bagdad to Cairo, so it  had been once more legally removed from Cairo to Constantinople. Selim  had brought with him to St. Sophia's some of the Ulema of the Azhar  mosque in Cairo, and these, in conjunction with the Turkish Ulema, had  elected him or ratified his election. A form of election is to the  present day observed at Constantinople in token of this right; and each  new Sultan of the house of Othman, as he succeeds to the temporal  sovereignty of Turkey, must wait before being recognized as Caliph till  he has received the sword of office at the hands of the Ulema. This  ceremony it is customary to perform in the mosque of Ayub.    3. _Nomination._ Sultan Selim, as has been already said, obtained from  Mutawakkel, a descendant of the Abbasides and himself titularly Caliph,  a full cession of all the Caliphal rights of that family. The fact, as  far as it goes, is historical, and the only flaw in the argument would  seem to be that Mutawakkel had no right thus to dispose of a title to an  alien, which was his own only in virtue of his birth. The case, indeed,  was very much as though the Emperor of Germany, having possessed himself  of London, should obtain from Don Carlos a cession of the throne of  Spain; or as though Napoleon should have got such a cession of the  Papacy, in 1813, from Pius VII. Still it is insisted upon strongly by  the Hanefite divines as giving a more permanent dynastic title than  either of the previous pleas. As a precedent for nomination they cite  the act of Abu Bekr, who on his death-bed recommended Omar as his  successor in the Caliphate.    4. _The guardianship of the two shrines_, that is to say of Mecca and  Jerusalem, but especially of Mecca. It has been asserted by some of the  Ulema, and it is certainly a common opinion at the present day, that the  sovereignty of Hejaz is in itself sufficient title to the Caliphate. It  seems certainly to have been so considered in the first age of Islam,  and many a bloody war was then fought for the right of protecting the  Beyt Allah; but the connection of Hejaz with the Empire of the Caliphs  has been too often broken to make this a very tenable argument. In the  tenth century it was held by the Karmathian heretics, in the thirteenth  by the Imams of Sana, and for seven years in the present century by the  Wahhabis. Still the _de facto_ sovereignty of the Harameyn, or two  shrines, was one of Selim's pleas; and it is one which has reappeared in  modern arguments respecting the Caliphal rights of his descendants.    5. _Possession of the Amanat_ or sacred relics. This last was a plea  addressed to the vulgar rather than to the learned; but it is one which  cannot be passed by unnoticed here, for it exercises a powerful  influence at the present day over the ignorant mass of Mussulmans. It  was asserted, and is still a pious belief, that from the sack of Bagdad,  in 1258, certain relics of the Prophet and his companions were saved and  brought to Cairo, and thence transferred by Selim to Constantinople.  These were represented to constitute the Imperial insignia of office,  and their possession to give a title to the Caliphal succession. They  consisted of the cloak of the Prophet borne by his soldiers as a  standard, of some hairs from his beard, and of the sword of Omar. The  vulgar believe them to be still preserved in the mosque of Ayub; and  though the Ulema no longer insist on their authenticity, they are often  referred to as an additional test of the Sultan's right.    Such, then, were the arguments of the Hanefite school, who defended  Selim's claim, and such they are with regard to his successors of the  house of Othman. By the world at large they seem to have been pretty  generally accepted, the more so as the Turkish Sultans, having only a  political end in view, were satisfied with their formal recognition by  their own subjects, and did not bring the question to an issue with  their independent neighbours. Neither the Mogul Emperors at Delhi nor  the Sheriffs of Morocco were called upon to acknowledge temporal or  spiritual supremacy in the Ottoman Sultans, nor did these affect an  every-day use of the ancient title they had assumed.    In India the head of the house of Othman was still known to Moslems as  Padishah or Sultan er Roum, the Roman Emperor, the most powerful of  Mussulman princes, but not in any special manner the head of their  religion, certainly not their sovereign. The Ulema, indeed, such as were  Hanefites, admitted him to be legally Khalifeh; but many of the Shafite  school denied this, pleading still that as an alien to the Koreysh his  claim was illegal, while to the ignorant mass of the people out of his  dominions his spiritual title remained almost unknown. The Sultans  themselves were doubtless to blame for this, seeing that the spiritual  functions of their new office were left almost entirely unperformed. For  it cannot be too strongly insisted on that the assumption of the  Caliphate was to the house of Othman only a means to an end, viz. the  consolidation of its worldly power upon a recognized basis, and that,  once that end obtained, the temporal dignity of Sultan was all that they  really considered. Thus they never sought to exercise the right  appertaining to the Caliphal office of appointing Naibs, or Deputy  Imams, in the lands outside their dominions, or to interfere with  doctrinal matters at home, except where such might prejudice the  interests of their rule. With regard to these, the theologians of  Constantinople, having satisfactorily settled the Caliphal dispute, and  pronounced the house of Othman for ever heirs to the dignity they had  assumed, were recommended by the head of the State to busy themselves no  further with doctrinal matters, and to consider the _ijtahad_, or  development of new dogma, altogether closed for the future in their  schools. Soliman the Magnificent, Selim's heir, especially insisted upon  this. He had already promulgated a series of decrees affecting the civil  administration of his empire, which he had declared to be immutable; and  an immutability, too, in dogma he thought would still further secure the  peace and stability of his rule. Nor did he meet with aught but approval  here from the Hanefite divines.    The Turkish Ulema, ever since their first appearance in the Arabian  schools in the eleventh century, finding themselves at a disadvantage  through their ignorance of the sacred language, and being  constitutionally adverse to intellectual effort, had maintained the  proposition that mental repose was the true feature of orthodoxy, and in  their _fetwas_ had consistently relied on authority and rejected  original argument. They therefore readily seconded the Sultan in his  views. Argument on first principles was formally forbidden in the  schools; and for the interpretation of existing law two offices were  invented--the one for dogmatic, the other for practical decisions, those  of the Sheykh el Islam and the Great Mufti. This closing of doctrinal  inquiry by the Ottoman Sultans, and the removal of the seat of supreme  spiritual government from the Arabian atmosphere of Cairo to the"]]]
