They  had a shot at old Tom, the hare, too, but he is still alive; at least  I pricked him yesterday morn across the path into the turnip-field.  Suppose we goes at him first?\"    The estate, like the game, was rather deficient in quantity, but Browne  was a wise man and made the most of what he had, and when he used to  talk about his \"manor\" on 'Change, people thought he had at least a  thousand acres--the extent a cockney generally advertises for, when he  wants to take a shooting-place. The following is a sketch of what he  had: The east, as far as the eye could reach, was bounded by Norwood,  a name dear to cockneys, and the scene of many a furtive kiss; the  hereditaments and premises belonging to Isaac Cheatum, Esq. ran parallel  with it on the west, containing sixty-three acres, \"be the same more or  less,\" separated from which, by a small brook or runner of water, came  the estate of Mr. Timms, consisting of sixty acres, three roods, and  twenty-four perches, commonly called or known by the name of Fordham;  next to it were two allotments in right of common, for all manner of  cattle, except cows, upon Streatham Common, from whence up to Rosalinda  Castle, on the west, lay the estate of Mr. Browne, consisting of fifty  acres and two perches. Now it so happened that Browne had formerly the  permission to sport all the way up to Norwood, a distance of a mile and  a half, and consequently he might have been said to have the right of  shooting in Norwood itself, for the keepers only direct their attention  to the preservation of the timber and the morals of the visitors; but  since his composition with his creditors, Mr. Cheatum, who had \"gone to  the wall\" himself in former years, was so scandalised at Browne doing  the same, that no sooner did his name appear in the _Gazette_, than  Cheatum withdrew his permission, thereby cutting him off from Norwood  and stopping him in pursuit of his game.    Joe's proposition being duly seconded, Mr. Jorrocks, in the most  orthodox manner, flushed off his old flint and steel fire-engine, and  proceeded to give it an uncommon good loading. The Yorkshireman, with  a look of disgust, mingled with despair, and a glance at Joe's plush  breeches and top-boots, did the same, while Nosey, in the most  considerate sportsmanlike manner, merely shouldered a stick, in order  that there might be no delicacy with his visitors, as to who should  shoot first--a piece of etiquette that aids the escape of many a bird in  the neighbourhood of London.    Old Tom--a most unfortunate old hare, that what with the harriers, the  shooters, the snarers, and one thing and another, never knew a moment's  peace, and who must have started in the world with as many lives as  a cat--being doomed to receive the first crack on this occasion, our  sportsmen stole gently down the fallow, at the bottom of which were the  turnips, wherein he was said to repose; but scarcely had they reached  the hurdles which divided the field, before he was seen legging it away  clean out of shot. Jorrocks, who had brought his gun to bear upon him,  could scarcely refrain from letting drive, but thinking to come upon him  again by stealth, as he made his circuit for Norwood, he strode away  across the allotments and Fordham estate, and took up a position behind  a shed which stood on the confines of Mr. Timms's and Mr. Cheatum's  properties. Here, having procured a rest for his gun, he waited until  old Tom, who had tarried to nip a few blades of green grass that came  in his way, made his appearance. Presently he came cantering along the  outside of the wood, at a careless, easy sort of pace, betokening either  perfect indifference for the world's mischief, or utter contempt of  cockney sportsmen altogether.    He was a melancholy, woe-begone-looking animal, long and lean, with a  slight inclination to grey on his dingy old coat, one that looked as  though he had survived his kindred and had already lived beyond his day.  Jorrocks, however, saw him differently, and his eyes glistened as  he came within range of his gun. A well-timed shot ends poor Tom's  miseries! He springs into the air, and with a melancholy scream rolls  neck over heels. Knowing that Pompey would infallibly spoil him if he  got up first, Jorrocks, without waiting to load, was in the act of  starting off to pick him up, when, at the first step, he found himself  in the grasp of a Herculean monster, something between a coal-heaver and  a gamekeeper, who had been secreted behind the shed. Nosey Browne, who  had been watching his movements, holloaed out to Jorrocks to \"hold  hard,\" who stood motionless, on the spot from whence he fired, and  Browne was speedily alongside of him. \"You are on Squire Cheatum's  estate,\" said the man; \"and I have authority to take up all poachers and  persons found unlawfully trespassing; what's your name?\" \"He's not on  Cheatum's estate,\" said Browne. \"He is,\" said the man. \"You're a liar,\"  said Browne. \"You're another,\" said the man. And so they went on; for  when such gentlemen meet, compliments pass current. At length the keeper  pulled out a foot-rule, and keeping Jorrocks in the same position he  caught him, he set-to to measure the distance of his foot from the  boundary, taking off in a line from the shed; when it certainly did  appear that the length of a big toe was across the mark, and putting up  his measure again, he insisted upon taking Jorrocks before a magistrate  for the trespass. Of course, no objection could be made, and they all  adjourned to Mr. Boreem's, when the whole case was laid before him. To  cut a long matter short--after hearing the pros and cons, and referring  to the Act of Parliament, his worship decided that a trespass had been  committed; and though, he said, it went against the grain to do so, he  fined Jorrocks in the mitigated penalty of one pound one.    This was a sad damper to our heroes, who returned to the castle with  their prog untouched and no great appetite for dinner. Being only a  family party, when Mrs. B---- retired, the subject naturally turned upon  the morning's mishap, and at every glass of port Jorrocks waxed more  valiant, until he swore he would appeal against the \"conwiction\"; and  remaining in the same mind when he awoke the next morning, he took the  Temple in his way to St. Botolph Lane and had six-and-eightpence worth  with Mr. Capias the attorney, who very judiciously argued each side of  the question without venturing an opinion, and proposed stating a case  for counsel to advise upon.    As usual, he gave one that would cut either way, though if it had any  tendency whatever it was to induce Jorrocks to go on; and he not wanting  much persuasion, it will not surprise our readers to hear that Jorrocks,  Capias, and the Yorkshireman were seen a few days after crossing  Waterloo Bridge in a yellow post-chaise, on their way to Croydon  sessions.    After a \"guinea\" consultation at the \"Greyhound,\" they adjourned to the  court, which was excessively crowded, Jorrocks being as popular with  the farmers and people as Cheatum was the reverse. Party feeling, too,  running rather high at the time, there had been a strong \"whip\" among  the magistrates to get a full attendance to reverse Boreem's conviction,  who had made himself rather obnoxious on the blue interest at the  election. Of course they all came in new hats,[15] and sat on the bench  looking as wise as gentlemen judges generally do.    [Footnote 15: Magistrates always buy their hats about session times, as  they have the privilege of keeping their hats on their blocks in court.]    One hundred and twenty-two affiliation cases (for this was in the  old Poor Law time) having been disposed of, about one o'clock in the  afternoon, the chairman, Mr. Tomkins of Tomkins, moved the order of the  day. He was a perfect prototype of a county magistrate--with a bald  powdered head covered by a low-crowned, broad-brimmed hat, hair  terminating behind in a _queue_, resting on the ample collar of a  snuff-brown coat, with a large bay-window of a corporation, with  difficulty retained by the joint efforts of a buff waistcoat, and the  waistband of a pair of yellow leather breeches. His countenance, which  was solemn and grave in the extreme, might either be indicative of sense  or what often serves in the place of wisdom--when parties can only hold  their tongues--great natural stupidity. From the judge's seat, which he  occupied in the centre of the bench, he observed, with immense dignity,  \"There is an appeal of Jorrocks against Cheatum, which we, the bench of  magistrates of our lord the king, will take if the parties are ready,\"  and immediately the court rang with \"Jorrocks and Cheatum! Jorrocks and  Cheatum! Mr. Capias, attorney-at-law! Mr. Capias answer to his name! Mr.  Sharp attorney-at-law! Mr. Sharp's in the jury-room.--Then go fetch him  directly,\" from the ushers and bailiffs of the court; for though Tomkins  of Tomkins was slow himself, he insisted upon others being quick, and  was a great hand at prating about saving the time of the suitors. At  length the bustle of counsel crossing the table, parties coming in  and others leaving court, bailiffs shouting, and ushers responding,  gradually subsided into a whisper of, \"That's Jorrocks! That's Cheatum!\"  as the belligerent parties took their places by their respective  counsel. Silence having been called and procured, Mr. Smirk, a  goodish-looking man for a lawyer, having deliberately unfolded his  brief, which his clerk had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15399"],[0,"The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, Or Gustavus Vassa, The (#10)"],[1,"lie on, and plenty of good victuals to eat; and  every body on board used me very kindly, quite contrary to what I had  seen of any white people before; I therefore began to think that they  were not all of the same disposition. A few days after I was on board  we sailed for England. I was still at a loss to conjecture my destiny.  By this time, however, I could smatter a little imperfect English; and  I wanted to know as well as I could where we were going. Some of the  people of the ship used to tell me they were going to carry me back to  my own country, and this made me very happy. I was quite rejoiced at  the sound of going back; and thought if I should get home what wonders  I should have to tell. But I was reserved for another fate, and was  soon undeceived when we came within sight of the English coast. While  I was on board this ship, my captain and master named me _Gustavus  Vassa_. I at that time began to understand him a little, and refused to  be called so, and told him as well as I could that I would be called  Jacob; but he said I should not, and still called me Gustavus; and  when I refused to answer to my new name, which at first I did, it  gained me many a cuff; so at length I submitted, and was obliged to  bear the present name, by which I have been known ever since. The ship  had a very long passage; and on that account we had very short  allowance of provisions. Towards the last we had only one pound and a  half of bread per week, and about the same quantity of meat, and one  quart of water a-day. We spoke with only one vessel the whole time we  were at sea, and but once we caught a few fishes. In our extremities  the captain and people told me in jest they would kill and eat me; but  I thought them in earnest, and was depressed beyond measure, expecting  every moment to be my last. While I was in this situation one evening  they caught, with a good deal of trouble, a large shark, and got it on  board. This gladdened my poor heart exceedingly, as I thought it would  serve the people to eat instead of their eating me; but very soon, to  my astonishment, they cut off a small part of the tail, and tossed the  rest over the side. This renewed my consternation; and I did not know  what to think of these white people, though I very much feared they  would kill and eat me. There was on board the ship a young lad who had  never been at sea before, about four or five years older than myself:  his name was Richard Baker. He was a native of America, had received  an excellent education, and was of a most amiable temper. Soon after I  went on board he shewed me a great deal of partiality and attention,  and in return I grew extremely fond of him. We at length became  inseparable; and, for the space of two years, he was of very great use  to me, and was my constant companion and instructor. Although this  dear youth had many slaves of his own, yet he and I have gone through  many sufferings together on shipboard; and we have many nights lain in  each other's bosoms when we were in great distress. Thus such a  friendship was cemented between us as we cherished till his death,  which, to my very great sorrow, happened in the year 1759, when he was  up the Archipelago, on board his majesty's ship the Preston: an event  which I have never ceased to regret, as I lost at once a kind  interpreter, an agreeable companion, and a faithful friend; who, at  the age of fifteen, discovered a mind superior to prejudice; and who  was not ashamed to notice, to associate with, and to be the friend and  instructor of one who was ignorant, a stranger, of a different  complexion, and a slave! My master had lodged in his mother's house in  America: he respected him very much, and made him always eat with him  in the cabin. He used often to tell him jocularly that he would kill  me to eat. Sometimes he would say to me--the black people were not  good to eat, and would ask me if we did not eat people in my country.  I said, No: then he said he would kill Dick (as he always called him)  first, and afterwards me. Though this hearing relieved my mind a  little as to myself, I was alarmed for Dick and whenever he was called  I used to be very much afraid he was to be killed; and I would peep  and watch to see if they were going to kill him: nor was I free from  this consternation till we made the land. One night we lost a man  overboard; and the cries and noise were so great and confused, in  stopping the ship, that I, who did not know what was the matter,  began, as usual, to be very much afraid, and to think they were going  to make an offering with me, and perform some magic; which I still  believed they dealt in. As the waves were very high I thought the  Ruler of the seas was angry, and I expected to be offered up to  appease him. This filled my mind with agony, and I could not any more  that night close my eyes again to rest. However, when daylight  appeared I was a little eased in my mind; but still every time I was  called I used to think it was to be killed. Some time after this we  saw some very large fish, which I afterwards found were called  grampusses. They looked to me extremely terrible, and made their  appearance just at dusk; and were so near as to blow the water on the  ship's deck. I believed them to be the rulers of the sea; and, as the  white people did not make any offerings at any time, I thought they  were angry with them: and, at last, what confirmed my belief was, the  wind just then died away, and a calm ensued, and in consequence of it  the ship stopped going. I supposed that the fish had performed this,  and I hid myself in the fore part of the ship, through fear of being  offered up to appease them, every minute peeping and quaking: but my  good friend Dick came shortly towards me, and I took an opportunity to  ask him, as well as I could, what these fish were. Not being able to  talk much English, I could but just make him understand my question;  and not at all, when I asked him if any offerings were to be made to  them: however, he told me these fish would swallow any body; which  sufficiently alarmed me. Here he was called away by the captain, who  was leaning over the quarter-deck railing and looking at the fish; and  most of the people were busied in getting a barrel of pitch to light,  for them to play with. The captain now called me to him, having  learned some of my apprehensions from Dick; and having diverted  himself and others for some time with my fears, which appeared  ludicrous enough in my crying and trembling, he dismissed me. The  barrel of pitch was now lighted and put over the side into the water:  by this time it was just dark, and the fish went after it; and, to my  great joy, I saw them no more.    However, all my alarms began to subside when we got sight of land; and  at last the ship arrived at Falmouth, after a passage of thirteen  weeks. Every heart on board seemed gladdened on our reaching the  shore, and none more than mine. The captain immediately went on shore,  and sent on board some fresh provisions, which we wanted very much:  we made good use of them, and our famine was soon turned into  feasting, almost without ending. It was about the beginning of the  spring 1757 when I arrived in England, and I was near twelve years of  age at that time. I was very much struck with the buildings and the  pavement of the streets in Falmouth; and, indeed, any object I saw  filled me with new surprise. One morning, when I got upon deck, I saw  it covered all over with the snow that fell over-night: as I had never  seen any thing of the kind before, I thought it was salt; so I  immediately ran down to the mate and desired him, as well as I could,  to come and see how somebody in the night had thrown salt all over the  deck. He, knowing what it was, desired me to bring some of it down to  him: accordingly I took up a handful of it, which I found very cold  indeed; and when I brought it to him he desired me to taste it. I did  so, and I was surprised beyond measure. I then asked him what it was;  he told me it was snow: but I could not in anywise understand him. He  asked me if we had no such thing in my country; and I told him, No. I  then asked him the use of it, and who made it; he told me a great man  in the heavens, called God: but here again I was to all intents and  purposes at a loss to understand him; and the more so, when a little  after I saw the air filled with it, in a heavy shower, which fell down  on the same day. After this I went to church; and having never been at  such a place before, I was again amazed at seeing and hearing the  service. I asked all I could about it; and they gave me to understand  it was worshipping God, who made us and all things. I was still at a  great loss, and soon got into an endless field of inquiries, as well  as I was able to speak and ask about things. However, my little friend  Dick used to be my best interpreter; for I could make free with him,  and he always instructed me with pleasure: and from what I could  understand by him of this God, and in seeing these white people did  not sell one another, as we did, I was much pleased; and in this I  thought they were much happier than we Africans. I was astonished at  the wisdom of the white people in all things I saw; but was amazed at  their not sacrificing, or making any offerings, and eating with  unwashed hands, and touching the dead. I likewise could not help  remarking the particular slenderness of their women, which I did not  at first like; and I thought they were not so modest and shamefaced as  the African women.    I had often seen my master and Dick employed in reading; and I had a  great curiosity to talk to the books, as I thought they did; and so to  learn how all things had a beginning: for that purpose I have often  taken up a book, and have talked to it, and then put my ears to it,  when alone, in hopes it would answer me; and I have been very much  concerned when I"]]]
