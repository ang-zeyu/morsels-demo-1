For all we know they  were drinking below before they came up.\"    \"That's it!\" interrupted Lew Flapp, thinking he saw a way of  implicating Dick and Powell. \"Mike Sherry never lets anybody in his  saloon without they drink something.\"    \"It's as plain as day,\" came from Rockley.    \"They had all the liquor they wanted before they came up, and now they  want to stop our sport.\"    \"Your story might be believed were it not for one thing,\" said Dick,  trying to keep calm. \"Come on, Harry, come, Joe.\" And he whispered  something into their ears.    \"Oh, all right,\" said Harry Moss, and he retreated from the room,  speedily followed by Joe Davis.    \"Hi! come back here, you young scamps!\" roared Lew Flapp. And then he  made for the doorway leading to the next room.    \"Not so fast, Flapp!\" said Dick, and blocked the opening with his own  form, while Powell stood directly behind.    \"Say, fellows, Moss and Davis are getting out of the window!\" cried  Flapp, in astonishment.    \"That's the way Rover and Powell must have gotten in,\" came from  Pender.    \"Exactly,\" answered Dick, \"and that proves we didn't have to stop below  for liquor,\" he added triumphantly.    \"Look here, I don't mean to let those fellows go yet,\" blustered Lew  Flapp. \"Let me get at them.\"    \"Not to-night, Flapp.\"    Scarcely had Dick spoken when the tall boy flung himself forward. The  pair grappled, and a moment later both went down, with Dick on top.    \"Hit him, Dick, don't let him get the best of you!\" cried Powell, and  an instant later found himself tackled by Pender and Jackson. For the  moment Ben Hurdy, who had remained silent during the most of the talk,  did nothing, but then he ran forward, and watching his chance, kicked  Dick in the side of the head with his foot.    The quarrel was now on in earnest, and in the midst of the melee a  burly waiter came rushing from below, demanding to know what was the  matter.    \"A pair of spies!\" shouted Pender. \"Help us to give them a sound  thrashing, Pat.\"    \"Sure, Oi will that!\" was the answer, and the waiter joined in the  attack on Dick and Powell.    It was with a mighty effort that Powell managed to throw off his  assailants. Then he leaped for the window, reached the ladder, and  fairly slid to the ground.    \"Let up on Dick Rover!\" he called, when safe. \"If you don't, I'll rouse  the constable and have somebody locked up.\"    \"Confound him!\" muttered Rockley. \"We had better dust out. If he calls  a constable the jig will be up.\"    With a parting kick at Dick he rushed down the back stairs to the  resort, and unlocked the door. Taking care that Powell should not see  him, he darted into the gathering darkness.    Ben Hurdy followed Rockley, and a moment later Pender and Jackson did  the same. Then Flapp came staggering down the stairs, holding his nose,  from which the blood was flowing freely.    \"Let's get back to the Hall as quickly as we can,\" he said to the  others. \"And if we are examined, we can deny everything.\"    \"All right,\" said Pender. \"But what did you do to Rover?\"    \"Somebody kicked him and he's about half unconscious. I left him to the  tender mercies of Pat the waiter.\" And then Lew Flapp and his cronies  hurried away on the road leading to Putnam Hall.    Dick might have defended himself, but he was cruelly kicked several  times, and partly lost consciousness, as already told. In a dim,  uncertain manner he felt himself raised up and carried below, and then  put on the grass of the yard behind Mike Sherry's resort.    When he was able to move he sat up and then arose to his feet slowly.  At that moment Songbird Powell discovered him. Powell had been up the  ladder a second time, to find the window closed and locked.    \"Dick!\" he exclaimed. \"Are you badly hurt?\"    \"I--I don't know,\" was the slow reply. \"How are you?\"    \"I'm all right?\"    \"Where are Flapp and the rest?\"    \"They ran away.\"    \"And Harry and Joe?\"    \"They are waiting for us, down at the turn in the road.\"    Dick put his hand to his head, to find a big lump directly back of the  ear. His ear was cut, and there was a scratch on his chin.    \"They didn't fight fair,\" he explained, when he felt a little  stronger. \"They kicked me when I was down.\"    Aided by Powell he made his way to a pump and there bathed his head and  procured a drink of water.    While both boys were recovering from the adventure all the lights in  Mike Sherry's resort were put out and every door and window was locked.    \"He wants to steer clear of trouble,\" said Powell.    \"I put the blame on Lew Flapp,\" answered Dick. \"To my mind he is about  as mean as any boy around here.\"    \"Of course we can't report him, Dick.\"    \"No, I'm no tale-bearer, Songbird. But he ought to be punished.\"    \"He'll make a fine major, if he's elected,\" went on Powell, as he and  Dick started for the road leading to the academy.    \"He shall never be elected, if I can help it.\"    \"I am with you on that.\"    They found Harry Moss and Joe Davis walking slowly toward Putnam Hall.  Joe seemed to feel all right now that he was out in the fresh evening  air, but Harry complained of a strange sickness at the stomach.    \"It was horrid of Lew Flapp to make us drink,\" said the young cadet. \"I  told him I didn't want anything stronger than soda. But he and Pender  made me take it.\"    \"I think the walk will do you good, Harry,\" answered Dick kindly.  \"Here, take my arm, and Songbird can take your other arm.\"    When the Hall was reached they found that Lew Flapp and his cronies had  already gone to bed. Dick took Harry and Joe to their dormitory and  then rejoined Powell.    \"Going to keep mum?\" asked the latter.    \"For the present,\" answered the eldest Rover. \"But after this let us  keep a sharp eye on Flapp, Pender & Company.\"    And so it was agreed.          CHAPTER XII    THE ELECTION FOR OFFICERS      On the following morning all of the cadets but Harry Moss appeared in  the messroom.    \"Joe Davis says Harry is quite sick,\" said Powell to Dick.    \"That's too bad. Have they sent for a doctor?\"    \"I don't know.\"    When Lew Flapp heard that Harry was sick he grew pale, and during the  morning session could scarcely fix his mind on his studies.    \"I hope the little fool don't blab on us,\" was his thought. \"If he does  there is no telling what the captain will do. He's altogether too  strict for comfort in some things.\"    No doctor was sent for, so it was finally agreed that Harry Moss was  not as ill as had been supposed. But the young cadet did not enter the  schoolroom for all of that day.    The sickness had frightened Captain Putnam, who was not yet over the  scarlet fever scare, and he questioned Harry thoroughly about what he  had been doing, and about what he had been eating and drinking.    At first the young cadet did not dare to tell the truth, but finally he  blurted out that he had taken a glass of liquor against his will and it  had turned his stomach in a most painful manner.    \"Where did you get the liquor?\" demanded Captain Putnam sternly.    \"I--I--oh, must I tell you, sir?\"    \"Yes, Harry.\"    \"I--that is, Lew Flapp--Oh, sir, I don't want to be a tattle-tale.\"    \"Did Lew Flapp give you the liquor? Answer me at once.\"    \"Yes, sir, he and another cadet named Pender. But, sir, I don't want to  hurt them. I--I--\" and here Harry burst into tears.    \"Where was this?\"    \"Down in Cedarville, sir. But, I--I--I shan't say any more, Captain  Putnam,\" and after that Harry remained silent. As it was plain to see  that he was suffering, Captain Putnam did not push the matter. But he  called Lew Flapp and Pender into his private office and interviewed the  unworthy pair for fully half an hour.    \"To do such a thing is outrageous,\" said the captain. \"If I hear of it  again I shall dismiss you from the Hall at once.\"    On the following morning one of the assistant teachers made a brief  announcement that filled the entire school with curiosity.    \"On next Monday you are to have an election of officers for the term,\"  said he. \"As you know, twenty cadets were selected as worthy of being  elected. The list has since been cut down to eighteen. Lew Flapp and  Augustus Pender will not run.\"    At this announcement Dick and Powell looked at each other  significantly. All of the other cadets looked around to find Flapp and  Pender, but the pair were absent, nor did they put in an appearance at  all until the next school session.    \"The captain found it out in some way,\" said Dick to Powell.    \"Shouldn't wonder if Harry Moss let the cat out of the bag,\" was the  answer.    \"It's queer about Flapp and Pender,\" declared Tom to his older brother.  \"Do you know why they were dropped?\"    \"Yes, Tom, but I don't want you to say anything about it.\"    \"There's a report around that they were found cutting loose in the  village,\" put in Sam.    \"Well, as I said before, I don't want to speak about it,\" went on Dick.    A few of the boys dared to question Flapp and Pender, but got no  satisfaction.    \"If I want to drop out I reckon I can do it,\" growled Flapp, and that  was as much as either he or his crony would say.    With Flapp out of the race there was considerable curiosity to know  who would be elected for the term. Each set of cadets had their  favorite candidates and the spirit of rivalry ran high. But most of the  candidates were good-natured about it, and especially Dick and Tom  Rover and George Granbury, Fred Garrison, and Larry Colby.    It had been decided that the cadets should first elect the major, then  the three captains, and then the six lieutenants, all to be selected  according to the highest number of votes received.    The voting began on Monday immediately after breakfast. Captain Putnam  had slips passed around and on these each cadet wrote down his choice  for major.    \"I will read the result,\" said the captain, a few minutes after the  poll was declared closed. And he read as follows:    \"Whole number of votes cast--9"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15803"],[0,"Crime and Its Causes (#10)"],[1,"of a fine. Anglo-Indian law does not enforce  caste decrees. But caste punishments exercise an efficacious restraint  upon unworthy members of the community, precisely as caste rewards  supply a powerful motive of action to good ones. A member who cannot  be controlled by this mixed discipline of punishment and reward is  eventually expelled; and, as a rule, 'an out-caste' is really a bad  man. Imprisonment in jail carries with it that penalty, but may be  condoned after release by heavy expiations.\"    Those remarks of Sir William Hunter afford an insight into the  coercive power exercised by the caste system on the Indian population.  Without that system it is probable that the criminal statistics of  India would present as high a proportion of crimes of violence and  blood as now exists among the peoples of Southern Europe. But with  that system in active operation, the evil influence of climate is  completely neutralised and India at the present moment enjoys a  remarkable immunity from violent crime. With the example of India  before us we are justified in coming to the conclusion that homicide  and crimes of a kindred nature need not necessarily be the malign  products of climate. Whatever climate has to do with fostering these  offences may be obviated by a better form of social organisation. It  would be ridiculous to dream of basing western society upon Indian  models; but at the same time India teaches us a lesson on the  construction of the social fabric which it would be well to learn. The  tendency of western civilisation at the present time is to herd vast  masses of men into huge industrial centres. It is useless discussing  the abstract question whether this is a good thing or a bad; we must  reconcile ourselves to the fact that it is a process forced upon  communities by the necessities of modern industrialism; and we must  accordingly make the best of it. In our efforts to make the best of  present tendencies, and to render them as innocuous as possible to  social welfare, there is one point at least where India is able to  teach us an instructive lesson. In India a man seldom becomes, what he  too often is, in all our large cities, a mere lonely, isolated unit,  left entirely to the mercy of his own impulses, constrained by no  social circle of any description, and unsustained by the pressure of  any public opinion for which he has the least regard. In India he is  always a member of some fraternity within the community; in that  fraternity or caste he feels at home; he is never isolated; he belongs  to a circle which is not too big for his individuality to be lost; he  is known; he has a reputation and a status to maintain; his life  within the caste is shaped for him by caste usages and traditions, and  for these he is taught to entertain the deepest reverence. Caste is in  many of its aspects a state in miniature within the state; in this  capacity it performs a variety of admirable functions of which the  state itself is and must always remain incapable.    Before the era of great cities the township in the West used to  exorcise some of the functions at present discharged in India by the  system of caste. But the township in the old sense of the word, with  its settled population and the common eye upon all its members, has  to a large extent disappeared. The influence of the family is at the  same time being constantly weakened by the migratory habits modern  industrialism entails on the population; in a word, the old  constraining force, which used to hold society together, are almost  gone, and nothing effective has sprung up to replace them.    In these circumstances what is to be done? It is useless attempting to  restore the past. That never has been accomplished successfully; all  attempts in that direction look as if they were opposed to the nature  of things. It is among the living and vigorous forces of the present  that we must look for help. I shall content myself by mentioning one  of these forces, namely Trade Societies. It seems a pity that these  societies should confine their operations merely to the limited object  of forcing up wages. That object is, of course, a perfectly laudable  and legitimate one, but it is surely not the supreme and only end for  which a Trade Society should exist. A Trade Society would do well to  teach its members how to spend as well as how to earn. What, indeed,  is the use of higher wages to a certain section of the members of  Trades-Unions? The increased pay, instead of being a blessing, becomes  a curse; it leads to drunkenness, to wife-beating, to disorder in the  public streets, to assaults on the police, to crimes of violence and  blood. It is a melancholy fact that the moment wages begin to rise,  the statistics of crime almost immediately follow suit, and at no  period are there more offences of all kinds against the person than  when material prosperity is at its height.    It lies well within the functions of such Trades-Unions as possess an  enlightened regard for the welfare of their members, to introduce a  code of regulations which would tend to minimise some of the evils  which have just been mentioned. It would immeasurably raise the status  of the Union, if certain disciplinary measures could be adopted  against members convicted of offences against the law. In the  professions of law and medicine it is the custom at the present time  to expel members who are proved guilty of serious offences of this  description, and unquestionably the dread of expulsion exercises a  most salutary influence on the conduct of all persons belonging to  these professions. It would be possible for Trade organisations to  accomplish much without resorting to this rigorous treatment; and the  real object for which such societies exist--the well-being of the  members--would be attained much more effectively than is the case at  present. Wages are but the means to an end; the end is individual,  domestic and social welfare, and it is only a half measure to supply  the means unless something is also done to secure the end.          CHAPTER III.    THE SEASONS AND CRIME.      Let us now approach the question of temperature and crime from another  point of view. International statistics indicate pretty clearly that  warm regions exercise an injurious effect on the conduct of European  peoples. Does the information furnished by these statistics stand  alone, or is it supported by the result of investigations conducted in  a different field? To this vital question it will be our endeavour to  supply an answer. In the annual reports of the Prison Commissioners  there is an instructive diagram showing the mean number of prisoners  in the local prisons of England and Wales on the first Tuesday of each  month. This diagram has been published for a considerable number of  years, and if we take any period of six years it is remarkable to  observe the unfailing regularity with which crime begins to decrease  as soon as the summer is over and the temperature begins to fall. From  the month of October till the month of February in the following year,  the prison population continues almost steadily to diminish; from the  month of February till the month of October, the same population,  allowing for pauses in its progress and occasional deflections in its  course, mounts upwards with the rising temperature. According to the  last sextennial diagram of the Prison Commissioners, which embraces  the six years ended March, 1884, the mean number of prisoners in the  local prisons of England and Wales was, on the first Tuesday in  February, 17,600; on the first Tuesday in April it had risen to  18,400; on the first Tuesday in July it had reached nearly 19,000; on  the first Tuesday in October it culminated in 19,200. From this date  onwards the numbers decreased just as steadily as they had previously  risen, reaching their lowest point in February, when the upward  movement again commenced. The steadiness and regularity of this rise  and fall of the prison population, according to the season of the  year, goes on with such wonderful precision that it must proceed from  the operation of some permanent cause. What is this permanent cause?  Is it economic, social, or climatic?    Is it economic? It is sometimes asserted that the increase of crime in  the summer months is due to the large number of tramps who leave the  workhouses after the winter is over and roam the country in search of  employment. Many of these wanderers, it is said, are arrested for  vagrancy; in summer they swell the prison population just as they  swell the workhouse population in winter. This explanation of the  increase of crime in summer contains so many elements of probability,  that it has come to be rather widely accepted by students of criminal  phenomena. It has not, however, been my good fortune to meet with any  facts or statistics of sufficient weight to establish the validity of  this explanation. As far as I can ascertain it is an explanation which  has obtained currency almost entirely through its own intrinsic  probability; it is believed, but it has not been proved. Let us  proceed to put it to the test. For this purpose we shall select the  county of Surrey--a fairly typical English county, composed partly of  town and partly of country. In the county of Surrey during the month  of July, 1888, sixty per cent. fewer persons were imprisoned for  vagrancy than in the following month of January, 1889. As far as  Surrey is concerned, these figures effectually dispose of the idea  that vagrancy is more common in summer than in winter; as a matter of  fact they demonstrate that the very opposite is the case. Surrey is  the only county for which I have been able to obtain trustworthy  statistics, but there is every reason to believe that the statistics  of Surrey reveal on a limited scale what the whole of England, if  figures were procurable, would reveal on a large scale."]]]
