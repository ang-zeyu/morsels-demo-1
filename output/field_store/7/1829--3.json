While I was at Port Elizabeth I paid a flying visit to Grahamstown. A  railway journey of rather over one hundred miles carried me there. The  railway runs through the veldt, where wild elephants are still strictly  preserved. There are said to be more than one hundred of these animals  in the district. They occasionally do great damage to the line. During  my stay I was hospitably entertained by the Bishop. I had already heard  that Grahamstown was noted for its natural charms, and its appearance  certainly did not disappoint me. Beautiful in situation, it merits the  high praises which have been bestowed upon it. It has also acquired a  reputation for being the seat of learning, and the centre of the  principal educational establishments of the Colony. The Bishop having  kindly provided me with a carriage, I drove to see the various objects  of interest in the neighbourhood. I first went to the Botanical Gardens,  which are very striking. They contain a large collection of rare and  valuable specimens of both arboriculture and horticulture. They are  admirably kept, and are very ornamental. I next drove round the Mountain  road. This is a beautiful drive of seven miles back into the town. The  views of the surrounding country are superb. It is a priceless boon to  the inhabitants of Grahamstown to possess such an attractive and  health-giving spot, for their recreation and enjoyment. I afterwards  visited the Museum, where there is a most interesting and valuable  collection of animal, vegetable, and mineral curiosities, both ancient  and modern. I also went over the Prison, and recorded in the visitors'  book my favourable opinion of the arrangements made for the health and  comfort of the prisoners. They appeared to me to be all that could  reasonably be expected, or desired. I also went to see the Kafir school,  carried on under the careful management of the Rev. Mr. and Mrs. M----.    I regretted that time did not permit of my visiting the celebrated  Ostrich Farm of Mr. Arthur Douglass, at Heatherton Towers, about fifteen  miles from Grahamstown. Mr. Douglass has the largest and most successful  Ostrich Farm in the Colony, in addition to which he is the patentee of  an egg hatching machine, or incubator, which is very much used in  various parts of South Africa. The export of feathers has increased  rapidly, and has become one of the chief exports of the Colony, as  whilst in 1868 the quantity exported was valued at L70,000, in 1887 it  had reached the value of L365,587. This is by no means the largest  amount appearing under the head of exports during recent years, as in  1882 the value of feathers exported was L1,093,989. It is estimated that  during the past half-century the total weight of the feathers exported  has been more than one thousand tons. The Cape Colony has, in fact, had  a monopoly of the ostrich industry, but in 1884 several shipments of  ostriches took place to South Australia, the Argentine Republic, and to  California, and the Government of the Cape Colony, being alarmed, that  the Colony was in danger of losing its lucrative monopoly, imposed an  export tax of L100 on each ostrich, and L5 on each ostrich egg  exported.          [Illustration: Decorative]    PORT ELIZABETH TO CAPE TOWN.      On my return to Port Elizabeth, I spent another day or two there, and  left on the evening of Monday, the 26th of August, by railway for Cape  Town. This long journey of between eight hundred and nine hundred miles  occupies nearly two days and two nights. It was the last I took in South  Africa. The country, generally speaking, is very much of the same kind  as that northward, over the Karoo, and in the southern part of the  Transvaal. High land,--in the neighbourhood of Nieupoort 5,050 feet  above the sea level,--flat, bare, and treeless. It is certainly a very  desolate-looking country to travel over in winter. Nearing Cape Town,  however, I ought not to omit to mention the Hex River Pass. The scenery  here is certainly very grand, and is some of the best of its kind I have  seen in South Africa. The railway, which winds through it by a  succession of zigzags from a great height, is another of the many  triumphs of engineering skill which are to be found in all parts of the  world. The fine views of the Pass, when I traversed it, were heightened  by the tops of the mountains being tinged with a wreath of snow. From  Hex River the route to Cape Town lay through a rich and fertile valley,  conveying ample proofs of the agricultural value and resources of this  part of the Cape Colony. I arrived at Cape Town in the afternoon of the  following Wednesday. Here I spent another pleasant week, seeing various  friends.    [Illustration: HEX RIVER PASS.]    One of the last duties which devolved upon me before leaving South  Africa--at the urgent invitation of some of my friends--was to deliver  an address at Cape Town on Imperial Federation. This I did at the hall  of the Young Men's Christian Society, to a large and attentive  audience.[C]    On the 4th of September I left Cape Town in the s.s. _Athenian_; and,  after a pleasant and rapid voyage of eighteen days, touching only at  Madeira on the way, I landed safely at Southampton on Sunday the 22nd.    I have now given an account of the prominent features of my tour, during  which, in the course of five months, I travelled about twelve thousand  miles by sea, and four thousand by land.    I proceed to touch as briefly as I can, on a few of the public  questions, and other matters of interest which have arrested my  attention while I was in South Africa.    [Footnote C: See Appendix.]          [Illustration: Decorative]    CLIMATE.      The climate of South Africa has already been so well, and exhaustively  described, in the admirable and interesting paper, read at a meeting of  the Royal Colonial Institute, on the 13th November, 1888, by Dr. Symes  Thompson, that it seems superfluous for anyone to attempt to add  anything to what such an eminent professional authority has said on the  subject. But I cannot help remarking that, from my own personal  experience, I can fully corroborate all he has said in its favour. The  winter climate seems perfect. The atmosphere is so bright and clear, the  air is so dry, and the sun is so agreeably warm in the day, although it  is cold and frosty at night, that I think it must be as salubrious, as  it has been to me most enjoyable. I found this the case everywhere,  especially in the higher altitudes, and on the elevated veldt of the  Transvaal. For myself, I never had an hour's illness during the whole  winter I passed in South Africa; and this I attribute entirely to the  purity of the air, and the dryness of the climate. One thing it is  necessary to be cautious about, and I have an impression that it is not  sufficiently attended to, and is consequently frequently the cause of  illness, and injury. There is always a sudden great variation of the  temperature immediately the sun goes down. To a sensitive person this is  instantly perceptible. In the afternoon everyone ought to be very  careful in guarding against this change; and should be provided with an  extra garment to put on at sunset, in order to avoid a dangerous chill.  I strongly advise, also, temperance in the use of alcoholic beverages,  which, in my opinion, are far too freely consumed. I have noticed too  much drinking among all classes. This cannot be necessary, or very  conducive to the preservation of health, and the prolongation of life,  in a climate like that of South Africa.    It is to be earnestly hoped, that a good, and thoroughly efficient  system of sanitary organisation may be speedily established in all the  rapidly-growing towns throughout the country, especially in the  Transvaal. Terrible neglect in this respect has been the cause of  exceptional sickness, and great mortality in the past, for which the  climate is not responsible. In order, too, to render the undoubted  excellencies of the South African climate more attractive to invalids,  who ought more largely to avail themselves of its advantages, it would  be an excellent thing, as well as undoubtedly a paying speculation, if  better hotels, fitted up in all respects with all modern European  improvements, were established both at Cape Town, and at all the other  principal towns up country, as well.    [Illustration: Decorative]          [Illustration: Decorative]    THE NATIVE QUESTION.      The native question is one of the most prominent and difficult ones to  deal with in South Africa. The great preponderance of the native over  the white races, and the different theories of treating them prevalent  between the English and Dutch, render it one of the most perplexing  problems to solve. The wisest and most experienced people, with whom I  have communicated on the subject are of opinion that the natives are so  far behind us in civilisation that they must be regarded as mere  children. This means, however, that they are not to be treated harshly,  but, on the contrary, with the utmost fairness and justice, and that  they must be under the guidance of a controlling and firmly governing  hand. They respect authority, when they have confidence in its being  exercised with impartiality. They have a great deal of natural  shrewdness, and they must never be deceived. Alas! I heard of frequent  instances of this having been done, in times past, by those who have  represented the British Government. Promises have been made to them  which have been carelessly broken, and this means ruin to the prestige  in their minds of the British name.    From the wonderful and ever-increasing development which has taken place  in the northern part of South Africa since the discovery of diamonds"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/164"],[0,"Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea (#10)"],[1," origin, harpooner on  board the frigate Abraham Lincoln of the navy of the United States of  America.\"    I bowed assent.  It was not a question that the commander put to me.  Therefore there was no answer to be made.  This man expressed himself  with perfect ease, without any accent.  His sentences were well turned,  his words clear, and his fluency of speech remarkable.  Yet, I did not  recognise in him a fellow-countryman.    He continued the conversation in these terms:    \"You have doubtless thought, sir, that I have delayed long in paying  you this second visit.  The reason is that, your identity recognised, I  wished to weigh maturely what part to act towards you.  I have  hesitated much.  Most annoying circumstances have brought you into the  presence of a man who has broken all the ties of humanity.  You have  come to trouble my existence.\"    \"Unintentionally!\" said I.    \"Unintentionally?\" replied the stranger, raising his voice a little.  \"Was it unintentionally that the Abraham Lincoln pursued me all over  the seas?  Was it unintentionally that you took passage in this  frigate?  Was it unintentionally that your cannon-balls rebounded off  the plating of my vessel?  Was it unintentionally that Mr. Ned Land  struck me with his harpoon?\"    I detected a restrained irritation in these words.  But to these  recriminations I had a very natural answer to make, and I made it.    \"Sir,\" said I, \"no doubt you are ignorant of the discussions which have  taken place concerning you in America and Europe.  You do not know that  divers accidents, caused by collisions with your submarine machine,  have excited public feeling in the two continents.  I omit the theories  without number by which it was sought to explain that of which you  alone possess the secret.  But you must understand that, in pursuing  you over the high seas of the Pacific, the Abraham Lincoln believed  itself to be chasing some powerful sea-monster, of which it was  necessary to rid the ocean at any price.\"    A half-smile curled the lips of the commander:  then, in a calmer tone:    \"M. Aronnax,\" he replied, \"dare you affirm that your frigate would not  as soon have pursued and cannonaded a submarine boat as a monster?\"    This question embarrassed me, for certainly Captain Farragut might not  have hesitated.  He might have thought it his duty to destroy a  contrivance of this kind, as he would a gigantic narwhal.    \"You understand then, sir,\" continued the stranger, \"that I have the  right to treat you as enemies?\"    I answered nothing, purposely.  For what good would it be to discuss  such a proposition, when force could destroy the best arguments?    \"I have hesitated some time,\" continued the commander; \"nothing obliged  me to show you hospitality.  If I chose to separate myself from you, I  should have no interest in seeing you again; I could place you upon the  deck of this vessel which has served you as a refuge, I could sink  beneath the waters, and forget that you had ever existed.  Would not  that be my right?\"    \"It might be the right of a savage,\" I answered, \"but not that of a  civilised man.\"    \"Professor,\" replied the commander, quickly, \"I am not what you call a  civilised man!  I have done with society entirely, for reasons which I  alone have the right of appreciating.  I do not, therefore, obey its  laws, and I desire you never to allude to them before me again!\"    This was said plainly.  A flash of anger and disdain kindled in the  eyes of the Unknown, and I had a glimpse of a terrible past in the life  of this man.  Not only had he put himself beyond the pale of human  laws, but he had made himself independent of them, free in the  strictest acceptation of the word, quite beyond their reach!  Who then  would dare to pursue him at the bottom of the sea, when, on its  surface, he defied all attempts made against him?    What vessel could resist the shock of his submarine monitor?  What  cuirass, however thick, could withstand the blows of his spur?  No man  could demand from him an account of his actions; God, if he believed in  one--his conscience, if he had one--were the sole judges to whom he was  answerable.    These reflections crossed my mind rapidly, whilst the stranger  personage was silent, absorbed, and as if wrapped up in himself.  I  regarded him with fear mingled with interest, as, doubtless, OEdiphus  regarded the Sphinx.    After rather a long silence, the commander resumed the conversation.    \"I have hesitated,\" said he, \"but I have thought that my interest might  be reconciled with that pity to which every human being has a right.  You will remain on board my vessel, since fate has cast you there.  You  will be free; and, in exchange for this liberty, I shall only impose  one single condition.  Your word of honour to submit to it will  suffice.\"    \"Speak, sir,\" I answered.  \"I suppose this condition is one which a man  of honour may accept?\"    \"Yes, sir; it is this:  It is possible that certain events, unforeseen,  may oblige me to consign you to your cabins for some hours or some  days, as the case may be.  As I desire never to use violence, I expect  from you, more than all the others, a passive obedience.  In thus  acting, I take all the responsibility:  I acquit you entirely, for I  make it an impossibility for you to see what ought not to be seen.  Do  you accept this condition?\"    Then things took place on board which, to say the least, were singular,  and which ought not to be seen by people who were not placed beyond the  pale of social laws.  Amongst the surprises which the future was  preparing for me, this might not be the least.    \"We accept,\" I answered; \"only I will ask your permission, sir, to  address one question to you--one only.\"    \"Speak, sir.\"    \"You said that we should be free on board.\"    \"Entirely.\"    \"I ask you, then, what you mean by this liberty?\"    \"Just the liberty to go, to come, to see, to observe even all that  passes here save under rare circumstances--the liberty, in short, which  we enjoy ourselves, my companions and I.\"    It was evident that we did not understand one another.    \"Pardon me, sir,\" I resumed, \"but this liberty is only what every  prisoner has of pacing his prison.  It cannot suffice us.\"    \"It must suffice you, however.\"    \"What! we must renounce for ever seeing our country, our friends, our  relations again?\"    \"Yes, sir.  But to renounce that unendurable worldly yoke which men  believe to be liberty is not perhaps so painful as you think.\"    \"Well,\" exclaimed Ned Land, \"never will I give my word of honour not to  try to escape.\"    \"I did not ask you for your word of honour, Master Land,\" answered the  commander, coldly.    \"Sir,\" I replied, beginning to get angry in spite of my self, \"you  abuse your situation towards us; it is cruelty.\"    \"No, sir, it is clemency.  You are my prisoners of war.  I keep you,  when I could, by a word, plunge you into the depths of the ocean.  You  attacked me.  You came to surprise a secret which no man in the world  must penetrate--the secret of my whole existence.  And you think that I  am going to send you back to that world which must know me no more?  Never!  In retaining you, it is not you whom I guard--it is myself.\"    These words indicated a resolution taken on the part of the commander,  against which no arguments would prevail.    \"So, sir,\" I rejoined, \"you give us simply the choice between life and  death?\"    \"Simply.\"    \"My friends,\" said I, \"to a question thus put, there is nothing to  answer.  But no word of honour binds us to the master of this vessel.\"    \"None, sir,\" answered the Unknown.    Then, in a gentler tone, he continued:    \"Now, permit me to finish what I have to say to you.  I know you, M.  Aronnax.  You and your companions will not, perhaps, have so much to  complain of in the chance which has bound you to my fate.  You will  find amongst the books which are my favourite study the work which you  have published on `the depths of the sea.'  I have often read it.  You  have carried out your work as far as terrestrial science permitted you.  But you do not know all--you have not seen all.  Let me tell you then,  Professor, that you will not regret the time passed on board my vessel.  You are going to visit the land of marvels.\"    These words of the commander had a great effect upon me.  I cannot deny  it.  My weak point was touched; and I forgot, for a moment, that the  contemplation of these sublime subjects was not worth the loss of  liberty.  Besides, I trusted to the future to decide this grave  question.  So I contented myself with saying:    \"By what name ought I to address you?\"    \"Sir,\" replied the commander, \"I am nothing to you but Captain Nemo;  and you and your companions are nothing to me but the passengers of the  Nautilus.\"    Captain Nemo called.  A steward appeared.  The captain gave him his  orders in that strange language which I did not understand.  Then,  turning towards the Canadian and Conseil:    \"A repast awaits you in your cabin,\" said he.  \"Be so good as to follow  this man.    \"And now, M. Aronnax, our breakfast is ready.  Permit me to lead the  way.\"    \"I am at your service, Captain.\"    I followed Captain Nemo; and as soon as I had passed through the door,  I found myself in a kind of passage lighted by electricity, similar to  the waist of a ship.  After we had proceeded a dozen yards, a second  door opened before me.    I then entered a dining-room, decorated and furnished in severe taste.  High oaken sideboards, inlaid with ebony, stood at the two extremities  of the room, and upon their shelves glittered china, porcelain, and  glass of inestimable value.  The plate on the table sparkled in the  rays which the luminous ceiling shed around, while the light was  tempered and softened by exquisite paintings.    In the centre of the room was a table richly laid out.  Captain Nemo  indicated the place I was to occupy.    The breakfast"]]]
