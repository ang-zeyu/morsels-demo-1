In his numerous  letters and notes to Sophie, he has left us a remarkable record of the  intensity of his passion. Not even excepting Goethe's letters to Frau  von Stein, there are no love-letters in the German language to equal  these in literary or artistic merit; and never has any other German poet  addressed himself with more ardent devotion to a woman. A characteristic  difference between Hoelderlin and Lenau here becomes evident: the former,  even in his relations with Diotima, supersensual; the latter the very  incarnation of sensuality. Lenau was fully conscious of the tremendous  struggle with overpowering passion, and once confessed to his clerical  friend Martensen that only through the unassailable chastity of his  lady-love had his conscience remained void of offence. Almost any of his  innumerable protestations of love taken at random would seem like the  most extravagant attempt to give utterance to the inexpressible: \"Gottes  starke Hand drueckt mich so fest an Dich, dass ich seufzen muss und  ringen mit erdrueckender Wonne, und meine Seele keinen Atem mehr hat,  wenn sie nicht Deine Liebe saugen kann. Ach Sophie! ach, liebe, liebe,  liebe Sophie!\"[92] \"Ich bete Dich an, Du bist mein Liebstes und  Hoechstes.\"[93] \"Am sechsten Juni reis' ich ab, nichts darf mich halten.  Mir brennt Leib und Seele nach Dir. Du! O Sophie! Haett' ich Dich da! Das  Verlangen schmerzt, O Gott!\"[94] Instead of experiencing the soothing  influences of a Diotima, Lenau's fate was to be engaged for ten long  years in a hot conflict between principle and passion, a conflict which  kept his naturally oversensitive nerves continually on the rack. He  himself expresses the detrimental effect of this situation: \"So treibt  mich die Liebe von einer Raserei zur andern, von der zuegellosesten  Freude zu verzweifeltem Unmut. Warum? Weil ich am Ziel der hoechsten, so  heiss ersehnten Wonne immer wieder umkehren muss, weil die Sehnsucht nie  gestillt wird, wird sie irr und wild und verkehrt sich in  Verzweiflung,--das ist die Geschichte meines Herzens.\"[95] It would seem  from the tone of many of his letters that there was much deliberate and  successful effort on the part of Sophie to keep Lenau's feelings toward  her always in a state of the highest nervous tension. So cleverly did  she manage this that even her caprices put him only the more hopelessly  at her mercy. One day he writes: \"Mit grosser Ungeduld erwartete ich  gestern die Post, und sie brachte mir auch einen Brief von Dir, aber  einen, der mich kraenkt.\"[96] For a day or two he is rebellious and  writes: \"Ich bin verstimmt, missmutig. Warum stoerst Du mein Herz in  seinen schoenen Gedanken von innigem Zusammenleben auch in der  Ferne?\"[97] But only a few days later he is again at her feet: \"Ich habe  Dir heute wieder geschrieben, um Dich auch zum Schreiben zu treiben. Ich  sehne mich nach Deinen Briefen. Du bist nicht sehr eifrig, Du bist es  wohl nie gewesen. Und kommt endlich einmal ein Brief, so hat er meist  seinen Haken--O liebe Sophie! wie lieb' ich Dich!\"[98] Her attitude on  several occasions leaves room for no other inference than that she was  extremely jealous of his affections. When in 1839 a mutual regard sprang  up between Lenau and the singer Karoline Unger, a regard which held out  to him the hope of a fuller and happier existence, we may surmise the  nature of Sophie's interference from the following reply to her: \"Sie  haben mir mit Ihren paar Zeilen das Herz zerschmettert,--Karoline liebt  mich und will mein werden. Sie sieht's als ihre Sendung an, mein Leben  zu versoehnen und zu begluecken.--Es ist an Ihnen Menschlichkeit zu ueben  an meinem zerrissenen Herzen.--Verstosse ich sie, so mache ich sie elend  und mich zugleich.--Entziehen Sie mir Ihr Herz, so geben Sie mir den  Tod; sind Sie ungluecklich, so will ich sterben. Der Knoten ist  geschuerzt. Ich wollte, ich waere schon tot!\"[99] Not only was this  proposed match broken off, but when some five years later Lenau made the  acquaintance of and became engaged to a charming young girl, Marie  Behrends, and all the poet's friends rejoiced with him at the prospect  of a happy marriage, a \"Musterehe,\" as he fondly called it, Sophie wrote  him the cruel words: \"Eines von uns muss wahnsinnig werden.\"[100] Only a  few months were needed to decide which of them it should be.    The foregoing illustrations are ample to show what sort of influence  Sophie exerted over the poet's entire nature, and therefore upon his  Weltschmerz. Whereas in their hopeless loves, Hoelderlin and to an even  greater extent Goethe, struggled through to the point of renunciation,  Lenau constantly retrogrades, and allows his baser sensual instincts  more and more to control him. He promises to subdue his wild outbursts a  little,[101] and when he fails he tries to explain,[102] to  apologize.[103] If with Hoelderlin love was to a predominating degree a  thing of the soul, it was with Lenau in an equal measure a matter of  nerves, and as such, under these conditions, it could not but contribute  largely to his physical, mental and moral disruption. With Hoelderlin it  was the rude interruption from without of his quiet and happy  intercourse with Susette, which embittered his soul. With Lenau it was  the feverish, tumultuous nature of the love itself, that deepened his  melancholy.    The charge of affectation in their Weltschmerz would be an entirely  baseless one, both in the case of Hoelderlin and Lenau. But this  difference is readily discovered in the impressions made upon us by  their writings, namely that Hoelderlin's Weltschmerz is absolutely naive  and unconscious, while that of Lenau is at all times self-conscious and  self-centered. Mention has already been made, in speaking of Lenau's  pathological traits,[104] of his confirmed habit of self-diagnosis. This  he applied not only to his physical condition but to his mental  experiences as well. No one knew so well as he how deeply the roots of  melancholy had penetrated his being. \"Ich bin ein Melancholiker\" he once  wrote to Sophie, \"der Kompass meiner Seele zittert immer wieder zurueck  nach dem Schmerze des Lebens.\"[105] Innumerable illustrations of this  fact might be found in his lyrics, all of which would repeat with  variations the theme of the stanza:        Du geleitest mich durch's Leben      Sinnende Melancholie!      Mag mein Stern sich strebend heben,      Mag er sinken,--weichest nie![106]    The definite purpose with which the poet seeks out and strives to keep  intact his painful impressions is frankly stated in one of his diary  memoranda, as follows: \"So gibt es eine Hoehe des Kummers, auf welcher  angelangt wir einer einzelnen Empfindung nicht nachspringen, sondern sie  laufen lassen, weil wir den Blick fuer das schmerzliche Ganze nicht  verlieren, sondern eine gewisse kummervolle Sammlung behalten wollen,  die bei aller scheinbaren Aussenheiterkeit recht gut fortbestehen  kann.\"[107] Hoelderlin, as we have noted,[108] not infrequently pictures  himself as a sacrifice to the cause of liberty and fatherland, to the  new era that is to come:        Umsonst zu sterben, lieb' ich nicht; doch      Lieb' ich zu fallen am Opferhuegel      Fuer's Vaterland, zu bluten des Herzens Blut,      Fuer's Vaterland....[109]    Lenau, on the other hand, is anxious to sacrifice himself to his muse.  \"Kuenstlerische Ausbildung ist mein hoechster Lebenszweck; alle Kraefte  meines Geistes, meines Gemuetes betracht' ich als Mittel dazu. Erinnerst  Du Dich des Gedichtes von Chamisso,[110] wo der Maler einen Juengling ans  Kreuz nagelt, um ein Bild vom Todesschmerze zu haben? Ich will mich  selber ans Kreuz schlagen, wenn's nur ein gutes Gedicht gibt.\"[111] And  again: \"Vielleicht ist die Eigenschaft meiner Poesie, dass sie ein  Selbstopfer ist, das Beste daran.\"[112] The specific instances just  cited, together with the inevitable impressions gathered from the  reading of his lyrics, make it impossible to avoid the conclusion that  we are dealing here with a _virtuoso_ of Weltschmerz; that Lenau was not  only conscious at all times of the depth of his sorrow, but that he was  also fully aware of its picturesqueness and its poetic possibilities. It  is true that this self-consciousness brings him dangerously near the  bounds of insincerity, but it must also be granted that he never  oversteps those bounds.    Regarded as a psychological process, Lenau's Weltschmerz therefore  stands midway between that of Hoelderlin and Heine. It is more  self-centred than Hoelderlin's and while the poet is able to diagnose the  disease which holds him firmly in its grasp, he lacks those means by  which he might free himself from it. Heine goes still further, for  having become conscious of his melancholy, he mercilessly applies the  lash of self-irony, and in it finds the antidote for his Weltschmerz.    Fichte, says Erich Schmidt, calls egoism the spirit of the eighteenth  century, by which he means the revelling, the complete absorption, in  the personal. This will naturally find its favorite occupation in  sentimental self-contemplation, which becomes a sort of fashionable  epidemic. It is this fashion which Goethe wished to depict in \"Werther,\"  and therefore Werther's hopeless love is not wholly responsible for his  suicide. \"Werther untergraebt sein Dasein durch Selbstbetrachtung,\" is  Goethe's own explanation of the case.[113] And it is in this light only  that Werther's malady deserves in any comprehensive sense the term  Weltschmerz. Here, then, Lenau and Werther stand on common ground. Other  traits common to most poets of Weltschmerz might here be enumerated as  characteristic of both, such as extreme fickleness of purpose,  supersensitiveness, lack of definite vocation, and the like; all of  which goes to show that while for artistic purposes Goethe required a  dramatic cause, or rather occasion, for Werther's suicide, he "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17373"],[0,"The Madonna in Art (#10)"],[1,"composition. The Madonna kneels in the foreground, adoring  with folded hands the child, who is supported in a sitting posture on  the ground, by a guardian angel. The Virgin's face is full of fervent  and exalted emotion.    Perugino had no direct imitator of his Madre Pia, but his Bolognese  admirer Francia treated the subject in a way that readily suggests the  source of his inspiration. His Madonna of the Rose Garden in Munich  instantly recalls Perugino. The artist has, however, chosen a novel  _motif_ in representing the moment when the Virgin is just sinking on  her knees, as if overcome by emotion.    Between the Umbrian school and the Florentine, a reciprocal influence  was exerted. If the latter taught the former many secrets of  composition and technical execution, the Umbrians in turn imparted  something of their mysticism to their more matter-of-fact neighbors.  While the Umbrian school of the fifteenth century was occupied with  the Madre Pia, Florence also was devoted to the same subject.  Sculpture led the race, and in the front ranks was Luca della Robbia,  founder of the school which bears his family name.    Beginning as a worker in marble, his inventive genius presently  wrought out a style of sculpture peculiarly his own. This was the  enamelled terra-cotta bas-relief showing pure white figures against a  background of pale blue. They were made chiefly in circular  medallions, lunettes, and tabernacles, and were scattered throughout  the churches and homes of Tuscany.    Associated with Luca in his work was his nephew Andrea, who, in turn,  had three sculptor sons, Giovanni, Girolamo, and Luca II. So great was  the demand for their ware that the Della Robbia studios became a  veritable manufactory from which hundreds of pieces went forth. Of  these, a goodly number represent the Madonna in Adoration. While it is  difficult to trace every one of these with absolute correctness to its  individual author, the majority seem to be by Andrea, who, as it would  appear, had a special fondness for the subject. It must be  acknowledged that the nephew is inferior to his uncle in his ideal of  the Virgin, less original than Luca in his conceptions, and less noble  in his results. His work, notwithstanding, has many charming  qualities, which are specially appropriate to the character of the  particular subject under consideration. There is, indeed, a peculiar  value in low relief, for purposes of idealization. It has an effect of  spiritualizing the material, and giving the figures an ethereal  appearance. Andrea profited by this advantage, and, in addition,  showed great delicacy of judgment in subduing curves and retaining  simplicity in his lines.    We may see all this in the popular tabernacle which he designed, and  of which there are at least five, and probably more, copies. The  Madonna kneels prayerfully before her babe, who lies on the ground by  some lily stalks. In the sky above are two cherubim and hands holding  a crown. There is a girlish grace in the kneeling figure, and a rare  sweetness in the face, entirely free from sentimentality. A severe  simplicity of drapery, and the absence of all unnecessary accessories,  are points of excellence worth noting. The composition was sometimes  varied by the introduction of different figures in the sky, other  cherubim, or the head of the Almighty, with the Dove. Only second in  popularity to this was Andrea's circular medallion of the Nativity,  with the Virgin and St. John in adoration. There are two copies of  this in the Florentine Academy, one in the Louvre, and one in Berlin.  The effect of crowding so many figures into a small compass is not so  pleasing as the classical simplicity of the former composition.    [Illustration: ANDREA DELLA ROBBIA.--MADONNA IN  ADORATION.]    Contemporary with the Della Robbias was another Florentine family of  artists equally numerous. Of the five Rossellini, Antonio is of  greatest interest to us, as a sculptor who had some qualities in  common with the famous porcelain workers. Like them, he had a special  gift for the Madonna in Adoration. We can see this subject in his best  style of treatment, in the beautiful Nativity in San Miniato, \"which  may be regarded as one of the most charming productions of the best  period of Tuscan art.\"[5] The tourist will consider it a rich reward  for his climb to the quaint old church on the ramparts overhanging the  Arno. If perchance his wanderings lead him, on another occasion, to  the hill rising on the opposite side, he will find, in the Cathedral  of Fiesole, a fitting companion in the altar-piece by Mino da Fiesole.  This is a decidedly unique rendering of the Madre Pia. The Virgin  kneels in a niche, facing the spectator, adoring the Christ-child, who  sits on the steps below her, turning to the little Baptist, who kneels  at one side on a still lower step.    [Footnote 5: C.C. Perkins, in Tuscan Sculptors.]    [Illustration: LORENZO DI CREDI.--NATIVITY.]    Passing from the sculpture of Florence to its painting, it is fitting  that we mention first of all the friend and fellow-pupil of the  Umbrian Perugino, Lorenzo di Credi. The two had much in common.  Trained together in the workshop of the sculptor Verrocchio, in those  days of intense religious stress, they both became followers of the  prophet-prior of San Marco, Savonarola. Their religious earnestness  naturally found expression in the beautiful subject of the Madre Pia.  The Florentine artist, though not less devout than his friend,  introduces into his work an element of joy, characteristic of his  surroundings, and more attractive than the somewhat melancholy types  of Umbria. His Adoration, in the Uffizi, is an admirable example of  his best work. Following the fashion made popular by the Della  Robbias, the artist chose for his composition the round picture, or  _tondo_. By this elimination of unnecessary corners, the attention  centres in the beautiful figure of the Virgin, which occupies a large  portion of the circle. In exquisite keeping with the modest loveliness  of her face, a delicate, transparent veil is knotted over her smooth  hair, and falls over the round curves of her neck. In expression and  attitude she is the perfect impersonation of the spirit of humility,  joyfully submissive to her high calling, reverently acknowledging her  unworthiness.    This picture may be taken as a typical example of the subject in  Florentine painting. Lorenzo himself repeated the composition many  times, and numerous other works could be mentioned, strikingly similar  in treatment, by Ghirlandajo, in the Florence Academy; by Signorelli,  in the National Gallery; by Albertinelli, in the Pitti; by Filippo  Lippi, in the Berlin Gallery; by Filippino Lippi, in the Pitti; and so  on through the list.    In many cases the subject seems to have been chosen, not so much from  any devotional spirit on the part of the painter, as from force of  imitation of the prevailing Florentine fashion. This is especially  true in the case of Filippo Lippi, who does not bear the best of  reputations. Although a brother in the Carmelite monastery, his love  of worldly pleasures often led him astray, if we are to believe the  gossip of the old annalists. We may allow much for the exaggerations  of scandal, but still be forced to admit that his candid realism is  plain evidence of a closer study of nature than of theology.    Browning has given us a fine analysis of his character in the poem  bearing his name, \"Fra Lippo Lippi.\" The artist monk, caught in the  streets of the city on his return from some midnight revel, explains  his constant quarrel with the rules of art laid down by ecclesiastical  authorities. They insist that his business is \"to the souls of men,\"  and that it is \"quite from the mark of painting\" to make \"faces, arms,  legs, and bodies like the true.\" On his part, he claims that it will  not help the interpretation of soul, by painting body ill. An intense  lover of every beautiful line and color in God's world, he believes  that these things are given us to be thankful for, not to pass over or  despise. Obliged to devote himself to a class of subjects with which  he had little sympathy, he compromised with his critics by adopting  the traditional forms of composition, and treating them after the  manner of _genre_ painters, in types drawn from the ordinary life  about him. The kneeling Madre Pia he painted three times: two of the  pictures are in the Florence Academy, and the third and best is in the  Berlin Gallery.    [Illustration: FILIPPO LIPPI.--MADONNA IN ADORATION.]    In the Madonna of the Uffizi, he broke away somewhat from tradition,  and rendered quite a new version of the subject. The Virgin is seated  with folded hands, adoring her child, who is held up before her by two  boy angels. His type of childhood is by no means pretty, though  altogether natural. The Virgin cannot be called either intellectual or  spiritual, but \"where,\" as a noted critic has asked, \"can we find a  face more winsome and appealing?\" Certainly she is a lovely woman, and        \"If you get simple beauty and naught else,      That's somewhat: and you'll find the soul you have missed      Within yourself, when you return him thanks.\"    The idea of the seated Madre Pia, comparatively rare in Florentine  art, is quite frequent in northern Italy. Sometimes the setting is a  landscape, in the foreground of which the Madonna sits adoring the  babe lying on her lap. Examples are by Basaiti (Paduan), in the  National Gallery, and by a painter of Titian's school, in Berlin. Much  more common is the enthroned Madonna in Adoration, and for this we  may turn to the pictures of the Vivarini, Bartolommeo and Luigi, or  Alvise. These men were of Muranese origin, and in the very beginning  of Venetian art-history were at the head of their profession, until  finally eclipsed by the rival family of the Bellini. Among their  works, we"]]]
