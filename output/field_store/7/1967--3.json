The moth emerges from the cocoon in the latter part of the summer,  copulates, lays its eggs, and of course dies. And now the trouble  commences; that is, with eggs laid, say in Japan, from whence we  mainly get our supplies.    As soon as the egg is laid, the young larva commences its formation,  which in a short time (about one month) is perfected. It lies in the  egg in a quiescent state till early spring. If the egg remain in the  country where it is laid, and is kept at a pretty even temperature,  and free from damp, the caterpillar emerges in a healthy condition.  But if it be removed some thousands of miles, passing in the transit  from heat to cold, and back to heat again: and if, in addition, it  be closely confined in a damp place, with little or no circulation of  air, the egg is attacked by a fungus which sometimes prevents the worm  from emerging at all; or, if it emerge, it is in a sickly condition.  That these conditions obtain in the transit of eggs, from Japan  to Europe, and thence to America, is evident enough; and it may,  therefore, require the efforts of many persons, continued for a long  time, to enable us to acclimatize the _Yamamai_. But this is all that  is required, and I feel confident that ultimate success is certain.    On hatching out, the worm is of a brimstone yellow, and thinly covered  with strong hairs; after the second month it is greenish, with black,  longitudinal streaks, and the thread a dull coral red color. After the  third month it becomes of a fine apple green, with yellow tubercles  on each segment, from which issue a few black hairs. The head and legs  are chocolate brown, the prolegs reddish, and the first segment edged  with pinkish color. The greatest care is necessary, as the spring  advances, to prevent the eggs from hatching before the oak buds  are ready for them, and the temperature must be regulated with the  greatest nicety. If the eggs can be kept somewhere about 50 deg. Fah.,  it would be quite safe; higher than that the mercury should not be  allowed to rise, till you are quite ready for the worms, and, on the  other hand, the eggs should not be allowed to freeze.    On emerging from the eggs, the worms should be allowed either to crawl  to the oak branches, or rather to sprigs obtained for that purpose,  the end of which should be placed in a jar, or bottle, of water, or  the worms may be placed on gently with a camel-hair brush. The leaves  should be well sprinkled with clean water that the caterpillars may  drink.    From some cause, not well understood, the young caterpillars have  a tendency to wander; and if care be not taken many may be lost. To  prevent this, it is well to cover the branches with a gauze bag, tied  tightly around the stems, and close to the bottle. Care must also  be taken that the caterpillars do not find their way into the water,  which they assuredly will if they have the opportunity, committing  suicide in the most reckless manner. If the number of caterpillars be  few, it is a good plan to place them at the outset with their food,  in a wide-mouthed bottle, covering the mouth with gauze. The branches,  particularly if the weather be warm, must still be occasionally  sprinkled, so that the caterpillars may have the opportunity of  drinking. It must be remembered that experiment is necessary in  rearing _Yamamai_, but one thing is ascertained, and that is, that the  worms must not be exposed to direct sunshine, at least not after seven  or eight in the morning. If the spring be warm, I am inclined to think  that a northeastern exposure is the best, and we may sum up by saying,  that comparatively cool and moist seasons are more favorable to  success that hot, dry weather. In America the worms suffer in the  early spring, from the rapid changes of temperature, 40 deg. at 9 A.M.  increasing to 70 deg. in the afternoon and falling off to freezing point  during the night. The worms cannot stand this. They become torpid,  refuse to eat, and consequently die. To prevent this, if the nights  be cold, they must be placed where no such change of temperature can  occur.    It is scarcely necessary to say that an ample supply of fresh food  must be always supplied, but it may not be amiss to say that it is  well, when supplying fresh branches, to remove the worms from the old  to the new. The best way of doing this is to clip off the branch, or  leaf, on which the worm is resting, and tie, pin, or in some way affix  the same to the new branches. If this be not done, they will continue  to eat the old leaf, even if it be withered, and this induces disease.  If the worm has fastened itself for the purpose of moulting, the best  way is to remove the entire branch, clipping off all the dried  leaves before so removing it. These remarks apply, in general, to the  treatment of all silkworms, except _Bombyx mori_.    The results of numerous experiments with _Yamamai_ go to show that it  is, as I said before, a difficult worm to rear; but it has been reared  near New York to the extent of eight hundred cocoons out of sixteen  hundred eggs, and this, although not a remunerative result, is  encouraging.    The Chinese silk moth, _Aulterea Pernyi_, also an oak feeder, has been  successfully raised by me and by others, for several years. Eggs have  been sold to persons in States widely separated, and the results show  that this worm is perfectly hardy.    The moth winters in the cocoon, emerges early in May, if the weather  be warm, pairs readily, and lays from 150 to 200 eggs. These hatch  out in about fourteen days, and like _Yamamai_, always about 5 or 6  o'clock in the morning. It is necessary to be on the alert to catch  them on hatching only, and to remember that they are vagabonds, even  to a greater extent than _Yamamai_. Consequently similar precautions  must be taken.    The worm on emerging from the egg is large, and of a chocolate-brown  color. After the first month it becomes of a yellowish green; head,  pale brown; feet and prolegs of nearly the same color. The body has  numerous reddish tubercles, from which issue a few reddish hairs. At  the base of some of the tubercles on the anterior segments are silvery  patches.    The _Pernyi_ worm is much more easily reared than that of _Yamamai_,  but still great care is needed; fresh food of course is essential, and  a slight sprinkling of the branches and worms in very warm weather is  advisable; although it is not so necessary as with _Yamamai_. It is  remarkable that _Pernyi_ worms, fed in the open air, on oak trees,  do not, at present, thrive so well as those fed in-doors, but this,  doubtless, is a question of acclimation. I advise white oak (_Quercus  alba_) as food, if it can be readily obtained, but failing that, pin  oak (_Quercus palustris_) will do; and I have no doubt that they will  feed on any kind of oak. They will, indeed, feed on birch, and on  sweet gum (_Liquidambar_), but oak is the proper food. It is worthy of  remark that _Pernyi_ bears a strong resemblance to our _Polyphemus_,  but it is more easily reared in confinement, and double brooded; an  important fact for the silk culturist. From American reared eggs, I  obtained cocoons as early as July 4th, the perfect insect emerging on  July 31. Copulation immediately ensued, and the resulting eggs hatched  only on August 12, ten days only from the time of laying; and as the  worm feeds up in about four or five weeks, this affords plenty of  time for rearing the second brood. It must be remembered that on the  quantity and quality of food, much depends, not only with _Pernyi_  but with all caterpillars. By furnishing food sparingly the time of  feeding would be much prolonged.    I have already said that both _Yamamai_ and _Pernyi_ should be fed  under shelter for the reasons given, but there is another reason of  less importance. The young worms are liable to be attacked by spiders  and wasps, and even after the second month, they are not safe from  these enemies. I have seen a wasp bite a large caterpillar in two,  carry off the anterior section and return for the posterior, which  had held on by its prolegs. Did the wasp anticipate this fact, and  therefore carry off the anterior part first? As to the spiders, they  form a series of pulleys and hoist the caterpillar off its legs,  sucking its juices at leisure.    And now I must devote a few words to the advisability of silk culture  from a pecuniary point of view. _Bombyx mori_, or the ordinary  mulberry silkworm, is, of course, the best to rear, if you can obtain  healthy eggs. But this is the difficulty, and thence arises the  necessity of cultivating other silk-producing species. I imagine  that silk can be produced in most of the States of the Union, and  manufactured from the cocoon at a large profit; but for the present,  we will leave the manufacture out of the question, and consider only,  whether it will not pay to rear eggs and cocoons for sale? It must  be remembered that European manufacturers are at this moment largely  dependent on foreign countries for the supply of both eggs and  cocoons; and this, because of the general prevalence of disease among  all the races of _Bombyx mori_. And now, to what extent does the  reader suppose this dependence exists? Of cocoons I have no returns at  hand, but, of raw silk, European manufacturers purchase, annually, not  less than $160,000,000 worth; and of eggs (_Bombyx mori_) to the  value of $10,000,000. This, then, is a business of no trifling amount.  California seems to be alive to the fact, and, I am informed, raised,  this last season, $3,000,000 cocoons; and, for sale, about 4,000  ounces of eggs, worth at least $4 per ounce, wholesale. Now, there is  no earthly reason why California should monopolize this business.  Why are not companies formed in other States for this purpose? or if  private individuals lack the enterprise or the means,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19192"],[0,"What is Darwinism? (#10)"],[1," worked?\" but it is, as he himself states, whether the essential  properties of matter have alone worked out all the wonders of creation;  or, whether they are to be referred to the mind and will of God. It is  worthy of remark how Messrs. Darwin and Wallace refer to Mr. Spencer as  their philosopher. We have seen what Spencer's philosophy is.    [17] It is, therefore, clear that design is what Mr. Darwin and Mr.  Wallace repudiate.    [18] That God permits men in the use of the laws of nature to distil  alcohol and brew poisons, does not prove that He approves of drunkenness  or murder.      _Professor Huxley._    The second witness as to the character of Mr. Darwin's theory is  Professor Huxley. We have some hesitation in including the name of this  distinguished naturalist among the advocates of Darwinism.[19] On the  one hand, in his Essay on the Origin of Species, printed in the  \"Westminster Review,\" in 1860, and reprinted in his \"Lay Sermons,\"  etc., in 1870, he says: \"There is no fault to be found with Mr. Darwin's  method, but it is another thing whether he has fulfilled all the  conditions imposed by that method. Is it satisfactorily proved that  species may[20] be originated by selection? that none of the phenomena  exhibited by species are inconsistent with the origin of species in this  way? If these questions can be answered in the affirmative, Mr. Darwin's  view steps out of the rank of hypotheses into that of theories; but so  long as the evidence at present adduced falls short of enforcing that  affirmative, so long, to our minds, the new doctrine must be content to  remain among the former,--an extremely valuable, and in the highest  degree probable, doctrine; indeed, the only extant hypothesis which is  worth anything in a scientific point of view; but still a hypothesis,  and not yet a theory of species. After much consideration,\" he adds,  \"and assuredly with no bias against Mr. Darwin's views, it is our clear  conviction that, as the evidence now stands, it is not absolutely proven  that a group of animals, having all the characters exhibited by species  in Nature, has ever been originated by selection, whether artificial or  natural.\"[21]    Again, in his work on \"Man's Place in Nature,\" he expresses himself much  to the same effect: \"A true physical cause is admitted to be such only  on one condition, that it shall account for all the phenomena which come  within the range of its operation. If it is inconsistent with any one  phenomenon it must be rejected; if it fails to explain any one  phenomenon it is so far to be suspected, though it may have a perfect  right to provisional acceptance.... Our acceptance, therefore, of the  Darwinian hypothesis must be provisional so long as one link in the  chain of evidence is wanting; and so long as all the animals and plants  certainly produced by selective breeding from a common stock are  fertile, and their progeny are fertile one with another, that link will  be wanting. For so long selective breeding will not be proved to be  competent to all that is required if it produce natural species.\"[22] In  immediate connection with the above passage, there is another which  throws a clear light on Professor Huxley's cosmical views. \"The whole  analogy of natural operations furnish so complete and crushing an  argument against the intervention of any but what are called secondary  causes, in the production of all the phenomena of the universe; that, in  view of the intimate relations of man and the rest of the living world,  and between the forces exerted by the latter and all other forces, I can  see no reason for doubting that all are cooerdinate terms of nature's  great progression, from formless to formed, from the inorganic to the  organic, from blind force to conscious intellect and will.\"[23]    Ought not this to settle the matter? Are we to give up the Bible and all  our hopes for the sake of an hypothesis that all living things,  including man, on the face of the earth, are descended from a primordial  animalcule, by natural selection, when such a man as Huxley, who (as  Voltaire said of the prophet Habbakuk) is _capable de tout_, says that  it has not been proved that any one species has thus originated?    But on the other hand, while he honestly admits that Darwin's doctrine  is a mere hypothesis and not a theory, he has nevertheless written at  least three essays or reviews in its exposition and vindication. He is  freely referred to on the continent of Europe, at least, as an ardent  advocate of the doctrine; and he quotes without protest such  designations of himself. At any rate, as he assures his readers that he  has no bias against Mr. Darwin's views, as he has devoted much time and  attention to the subject, and as he is one of the most prominent  naturalists of the age, there can be no question as to his competency as  a witness as to what Darwinism is.    His testimony that Mr. Darwin's doctrine excludes all teleology, or  final causes, is explicit. In his review of the \"Criticisms on the  Origin of Species,\" he says, \"that when he first read Mr. Darwin's book,  that which struck him most forcibly was the conviction that teleology,  as commonly understood, had received its death-blow at Mr. Darwin's  hands. For the teleological argument runs thus: An organ is precisely  fitted to perform a function or purpose; therefore, it was specially  constructed to perform that function. In Paley's famous illustration,  the adaptation of all the parts of a watch to the function or purpose of  showing the time, is held to be evidence that the watch was specially  contrived to that end; on the ground that the only cause we know of  competent to produce such an effect as a watch which shall keep time, is  a contriving intelligence adapting the means directly to that end.\"[24]  This, Mr. Huxley tells us, is precisely what Darwin denies with  reference to the organs of plants and animals. The eye was not formed  for the purpose of seeing, or the ear for hearing. It so happened that a  nerve became sensitive to light; then in course of time, it happened  that a transparent tissue came over it; and thus in \"millions of years\"  an eye, as we have seen above, happened to be formed. No such organ was  ever intended or designed by God or man. \"An apparatus,\" says Professor  Huxley, \"thoroughly adapted to a particular purpose, might be the result  of a method of trial and error worked by unintelligent agents, as well  as by the application of means appropriate to the end by an intelligent  agent.\" \"For the notion that every organism has been created as it is  and launched straight at a purpose, Mr. Darwin substitutes the  conception of something, which may fairly be termed a method of trial  and error. Organisms vary incessantly; of these variations the few meet  with surrounding conditions which suit them, and thrive; the many are  unsuited, and become extinguished.\" \"For the teleologist an organism  exists, because it was made for the conditions in which it is found; for  the Darwinian an organism exists, because, out of many of its kind, it  is the only one which has been able to persist in the conditions in  which it is found.\" \"If we apprehend,\" Huxley further says, \"the spirit  of the 'Origin of Species' rightly, then, nothing can be more entirely  and absolutely opposed to teleology, as it is commonly understood, than  the Darwinian theory.\" (p. 303)    It has already been stated that Mr. Wallace does not apply the doctrine  of evolution to man; neither does Mr. Mivart, a distinguished  naturalist, who is a member of the Latin Church. The manner in which  Professor Huxley speaks of these gentlemen shows how thoroughly, in his  judgment, Mr. Darwin banishes God from his works: \"Mr. Wallace and Mr.  Mivart are as stout evolutionists as Mr. Darwin himself; but Mr. Wallace  denies that man can have been evolved from a lower animal by that  process of natural selection, which he, with Mr. Darwin, holds to be  sufficient for the evolution of all animals below man; while Mr. Mivart,  admitting that natural selection has been one of the conditions of the  animals below man, maintains that natural selection must, even in their  case, have been supplemented by some other cause,--of the nature of  which, unfortunately, he does not give us any idea. Thus Mr. Mivart is  less of a Darwinian than Mr. Wallace, for he has faith in the power of  natural selection. But he is more of an evolutionist than Mr. Wallace,  because Mr. Wallace thinks it necessary to call in an intelligent agent,  a sort of supernatural Sir John Sebright, to produce even the animal  frame of man; while Mr. Mivart requires no Divine assistance till he  comes to man's soul.\"[25]    In the \"Academy\" for October, 1869, there is a review by Professor  Huxley of Dr. Haeckel's \"Natuerlische Schoepfungsgeschichte,\" in which he  says: \"Professor Haeckel enlarges on the service which the 'Origin of  Species' has done in favoring what he terms 'the causal or mechanical'  view of living nature as opposed to the 'teleological or vitalistic'  view. And no doubt it is quite true the doctrine of evolution is the  most formidable of all the commoner and coarser forms of teleology.  Perhaps the most remarkable service to the philosophy of Biology  rendered by Mr. Darwin is the reconciliation of Teleology and  Morphology, and the explanation of the facts of both which his view  offers.    \"The teleology which supposes that the eye, such as we see it in man or  in the higher vertebrata, was made with the precise structure which it  exhibits, to make the animal which possesses it to see, has undoubtedly  received its death-blow. But it is necessary to remember that there is a  higher teleology, which is not touched by the doctrine of evolution, but  is actually based on the fundamental proposition of evolution. That  proposition is, that the whole world, living and not living, is the  result of the mutual"]]]
