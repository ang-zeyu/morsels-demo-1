[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15622"],[0,"Handbook on Japanning: 2nd Edition (#10)"],[1," both the exposed parts of  the iron and the protected parts are immersed in the liquid. The zinc  has not the same protective quality when the liquid is sprinkled over  the surface and remains in isolated drops. Sea air, being charged with  saline matters, is very destructive to galvanized surfaces, forming a  soluble chloride by its action. As zinc is one of the metals most  readily attacked by acids, ordinary galvanized iron is not suitable  for positions where it is to be much exposed to an atmosphere charged  with acids sent into the air by some manufactories, or to the  sulphuric acid fumes found in the products of combustion of rolling  mills, iron, glass, and gas works, etc., and yet we see engineers of  note covering-in important buildings with corrugated and other sheets  of iron, and using galvanized iron tie rods, angles, and other  constructive shapes in blind confidence of the protective power of the  zinc coating; also in supreme indifference as to the future  consequences and catastrophes that arise from their unexpected  failure. The comparative inertia of lead to the chemical action of  many acids has led to the contention that it should form as good, if  not a better, protection of iron than zinc, but in practice it is  found to be deficient as a protective coating against corrosion. A  piece of lead-coated iron placed in water will show decided evidences  of corrosion in twenty-four hours. This is to be attributed to the  porous nature of the coating, whether it is applied by the hot or wet  (acid) process. The lead does not bond to the plate as well as either  of the other metals--zinc, tin, copper, or any alloys of them. The  following table gives the increase in weight of different articles due  to hot galvanizing:--      +--------------------------+--------------------------+-------------+    |    Description of        |     Weight of Zinc       | Percentage  |    |       Article            |     per Square foot      | of Increase |    |                          |                          | of Weight   |    +--------------------------+--------------------------+-------------+    | Thin sheet-iron          |         1.196 oz.        |    18.2     |    | 5/16-in. plates          |         1.76  \"          |     2.0     |    | 4-in. cut nails          |         2.19  \"          |     6.72    |    | 7/8-in. die bolt and nut | approximately 1.206 oz.  |     1.00    |    +--------------------------+--------------------------+-------------+    Tin is often added to the hot bath for the purpose of obtaining a  smoother surface and larger facets, but it is found to shorten the  life of the protective coating very considerably.    A portion of a zinc coating applied by the hot process was found to be  very brittle, breaking when attempts were made to bend it; the average  thickness of the coating was .015 inch. An analysis gave the following  result: tin, 2.20; iron, 3.78; arsenic, a trace; zinc (by difference),  94.02. A small quantity of iron is dissolved from all the articles  placed in the molten zinc bath, and a dross is formed amounting in  many cases to 25 per cent of the whole amount of zinc used. The  zinc-iron alloy is very brittle, and contains by analysis 6 per cent  of iron, and is used to cast small art ornaments from. A hot  galvanizing plant, having a bath capacity of 10 feet by 4 feet by  4-1/2 feet outside dimensions, and about 1 inch in thickness, will  hold 28 tons of zinc. With equal amounts of zinc per unit of area, the  zinc coating put on by the cold process is more resistant to the  corroding action of a saturated solution of copper sulphate than is  the case with steel coated by the ordinary hot galvanizing process;  or, to put it in another form, articles coated by the cold process  should have an equally long life under the same conditions of exposure  that hot galvanized articles are exposed to, and with less zinc than  would be necessary in the ordinary hot process. The hardness of a zinc  surface is a matter of some importance. With this object in view  aluminium has been added from a separate crucible to the molten zinc  at the moment of dipping the article to be zinced, so as to form a  compound surface of zinco-aluminium, and to reduce the ashes formed  from the protective coverings of sal-ammoniac, fat, glycerine, etc.  The addition of the aluminium also reduces the thickness of the  coating applied. Cold and hot galvanized plates appear to stand  abrasion equally well. Both pickling and hot galvanizing reduce the  strength, distort and render brittle iron and steel wires of small  sections.

"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15625"],[0,"The Lookout Man (#10)"],[1," there are any nice hunters after the bears!\"          CHAPTER SEVEN    GUARDIAN OF THE FORESTS      In mid July the pines and spruces and firs have lost their pale green  fingertips which they wave to the world in spring, and have settled  down to the placid business of growing new cones that shall bear the  seed of future forests as stately as these. On the shadowed,  needle-carpeted slopes there is always a whispery kind of calm; the  calm of Nature moving quietly about her appointed tasks, without haste  and without uncertainty, untorn by doubts or fears or futile  questioning; like a broad-souled, deep-bosomed mother contentedly  rearing her young in a sheltered home where love abides in the peace  which passeth understanding.    Gray squirrels, sleek and bright-eyed and graceful always, lope over  the brown needles, intent upon some urgent business of their own.  Noisy little chipmunks sit up and nibble nervously at dainties they  have found, and flirt their tails and gossip, and scold the carping  bluejays that peer down from overhanging branches. Perhaps a hoot owl  in the hollow trees overhead opens amber eyes and blinks irritatedly  at the chattering, then wriggles his head farther down into his  feathers, stretches a leg and a wing and settles himself for another  nap.    Little streams go sliding down between banks of bright green grass,  and fuss over the mossy rocks that lie in their beds. Deer lift heads  often to listen and look and sniff the breeze between mouthfuls of the  tender twigs they love. Shambling, slack-jointed bears move shuffling  through the thickets, like the deer, lifting suspicious noses to test  frequently the wind, lest some enemy steal upon them unaware.    From his glass-walled eyrie, Jack Corey gazed down upon the wooded  slopes and dreamed of what they hid of beauty and menace and calm and  of loneliness. He saw them once drenched with rain; but mostly they  lay warm under the hot sunshine of summer. He saw them darkling with  night shadows, he saw them silvered with morning fogs which turned  rose tinted with the first rays of sunrise, he saw them lie  soft-shaded in the sunset's after glow, saw them held in the unearthly  beauty of the full moonlight.    Like the deer and the bear down there, his head was lifted often to  look and to sniff the wind that blew strongly over the peak. For now  the winds came too often tainted with the smoke of burning pines. The  blue haze of the far distance deepened with the thickening air. Four  times in the last ten days he had swung the pointer over the mapped  table and sighted it upon brown puffballs that rose over the  treetops--the first betraying marks of the licking flames below. He  had watched the puff balls grow until they exploded into rolling  clouds of smoke, yellow where the flames mounted high in some dead  pine or into a cedar, black where a pitch stump took fire.    After he had telephoned the alarm to headquarters he would watch  anxiously the spreading pall. To stand up there helpless while great  trees that had been a hundred years or more in the growing died the  death of fire, gave him a tragic feeling of having somehow betrayed  his trust. Every pine that fell, whether by old age, fire or the  woodmen's axe, touched him with a sense of personal loss. It was as  though he himself had made the hills and clothed them with the  majestic trees, and now stood godlike above, watching lest evil come  upon them. But he did not feel godlike when through the telescope he  watched great leaping flames go climbing up some giant pine, eating  away its very life as they climbed; he was filled then with a blind,  helpless rage at his own ineffectiveness, and he would stand and  wonder why God refused to send the rain that would save these  wonderful, living things, the trees.    At night, when the forests drew back into the darkness, he would watch  the stars slide across the terrible depth of purple infinity that  seemed to deepen hypnotically as he stared out into it. Venus, Mars,  Jupiter--at first he could not tell one from another, though he  watched them all. He had studied astronomy among other things in  school, but then it had been merely a hated task to be shirked and  slighted and forgotten as one's palate forgets the taste of bitter  medicine. Up here, with the stars all around him and above him for  many nights, he was ashamed because he could not call them all by  name. He would train his telescope upon some particularly bright star  and watch it and wonder--Jack did a great deal of wondering in those  days, after his first panicky fight against the loneliness and silence  had spent itself.    First of all, he awoke to the fact that he was about as important to  the world as one of those little brown birds that hopped among the  rocks and perked its head at him so knowingly, and preened its  feathers with such a funny air of consequence. He could not even  believe that his sudden disappearance had caused his mother any grief  beyond her humiliation over the manner and the cause of his going. She  would hire some one to take care of the car, and she would go to her  teas and her club meetings and her formal receptions and to church  just the same as though he were there--or had never been there. If he  ever went back.... But he never could go back. He never could face his  mother again, and listen to her calmly-condemnatory lectures that had  no love to warm them or to give them the sweet tang of motherly  scolding.    It sounds a strange thing to say of Jack Corey, that scattered-brained  young fellow addicted to beach dancing and joy rides and all that goes  with these essentially frothy pastimes; a strange thing to say of him  that he was falling into a more affectionate attitude of personal  nearness to the stars and to the mountains spread out below him than  he had ever felt toward Mrs. Singleton Corey. Yet that is how he  managed to live through the lonely days he spent up there in the  lookout station.    When Hank was about to start with another load of supplies up the  mountain, Jack had phoned down for all of the newspapers, magazines  and novels which Forest Supervisor Ross could buy or borrow; also a  double supply of smoking tobacco and a box of gum. When his tongue  smarted from too much smoking, he would chew gum for comfort And he  read and read, until his eyes prickled and the print blurred. But the  next week he diffidently asked Ross if he thought he could get him a  book on astronomy, explaining rather shame-facedly that there was  something he wanted to look up. On his third trip Hank carried several  government pamphlets on forestry. Which goes to prove how Jack was  slowly adapting himself to his changed circumstances, and fitting  himself into his surroundings.    He had to do that or go all warped and wrong, for he had no intention  of leaving the peak, which was at once a refuge and a place where he  could accumulate money; not much money, according to Jack's standard  of reckoning--his mother had often spent as much for a gown or a ring  as he could earn if he stayed all summer--but enough to help him out  of the country if he saved it all.    When his first four days vacation was offered him, Jack thought a long  while over the manner of spending it. Quincy did not offer much in the  way of diversion, though it did offer something in the way of risk. So  he cut Quincy out of his calculations and decided that he would phone  down for a camp outfit and grub, and visit one or two of the places  that he had been looking at for so long. For one thing, he could climb  down to the lake he had been staring into for nearly a month, and see  if he could catch any trout. Occasionally he had seen fishermen down  there casting their lines in, but none of them had seemed to have much  luck. For all that the lake lured him, it was so blue and clear, set  away down there in the cupped mountain top. Hank had advised him to  bait with a salmon-roe on a Coachman fly. Jack had never heard of that  combination, and he wanted to try it.    But after all, the lake was too near to appeal to him except by way of  passing. Away on the next ridge was the black, rocky hump called  Grizzly Peak on the map. Hank spoke of it casually as Taylor Rock, and  sometimes called it King Solomon. That was where the bears had their  winter quarters, and that was where Jack wanted to go and camp. He  wanted to see a bear's den, and if the bears were all gone--Hank  assured him that they never hung out up there in the summer, but  ranged all over the mountains--he wanted to go inside a den and see  what it was like. And for a particular, definite ambition, without  which all effort is purposeless, he wanted to kill a bear.    Hank brought him all the things he needed, talked incessantly of what  Jack should do and what he shouldn't do, and even offered to pack his  outfit over to the Peak for him. So Jack went, and got his first taste  of real camping out in a real wilderness, and gained a more intimate  knowledge of the country he had to guard.    By the time his second relief was at hand, he was tempted to take what  money he had earned and go as far as it would take him. He did not  believe he could stand another month of that terrible isolation, even  with his new friendliness toward the stars and the forest to lighten a  little of his loneliness. Youth hungers for a warmer, more personal  companionship than Nature, and Jack was never meant for a hermit. He  grew sullen. He would stand upon his pinnacle where he could look down  at Crystal Lake, and hate the tourists who came with lunches and their  fishing tackle, and scrambled over the rocks, and called shrilly to  one another, and laughed, and tried to invent new ways of stringing  together adjectives that seemed to express their enthusiasm. He would  make biting remarks to them which the distance prevented their  hearing, and he would wish savagely that they would fall "]]]
