So  what do you think he did? Why, cheating had become such a habit with  him that he actually tried to cheat himself--to cheat his conscience!  When he was telling a lie, he would wink one eye. 'That,' said he to  himself, 'means that it isn't true, and if these folks are not smart  enough to see me wink and know what it means, it is their own fault if  they believe what I am telling them.' But always he took care to wink  the eye that was turned away from the one he was talking to.    \"Dear me, dear me, such terrible times as there were on the Green  Meadows and in the Green Forest! They grew worse and worse, and when  at last Old Mother Nature came to see how all the little people were  getting along, she heard so many complaints that she hardly knew  where to begin to straighten matters out. She had all the little  people come before her in turn and tell their troubles. When it came  Mr. Snake's turn, he had no complaint to make. He seemed to be the  only one who had no troubles. She asked him a great many questions,  and for each one he had a ready reply. Of course a great many of these  replies were lies, and every time he told one of these, he winked  without knowing it. You see, it had become a habit.    \"Now, with all his smartness, Mr. Snake had forgotten one thing, one  very important thing. It was this: You can't fool Old Mother Nature,  and it is of no use to try. He hadn't been talking three minutes  before she knew who was at the bottom of all the trouble. She let him  finish, then called all the others about her and told them who had  made all the trouble. Mr. Snake was very bold. He held his head very  high in the air and pretended not to care. When Old Mother Nature  turned her head, he even ran out his tongue at her, just as all the  Snake family do at you and me to-day. When she had finished telling  them how cheating and stealing and lying isn't smart at all, but very,  very dreadful, she turned to Mr. Snake and said:    \"'From this time on, no one will believe anything you say, and you  shall have no friends. You will never wink again, for you and your  children and your children's children forever will have no eyelids,  that all the world may know that those who make a wrong use of the  things given them shall have them taken away.'    \"And now you know why little Mr. Greensnake cannot wink at you; he  hasn't any eyelids to wink with\" finished Grandfather Frog.    Peter Rabbit drew a long breath. \"Thank you, oh, thank you ever so  much, Grandfather Frog,\" he said. \"Will you tell us next time why  Bobby Coon wears rings on his tail?\"    \"Perhaps,\" replied Grandfather Frog.          XI    WHY BOBBY COON HAS RINGS ON HIS TAIL      Peter Rabbit would give Grandfather Frog no peace. Every day Peter  visited the Smiling Pool to tease Grandfather Frog for a story--for  one particular story. He wanted to know why it is that Bobby Coon  wears rings on his tail. You see, Peter had admired Bobby Coon's tail  for a long time. Peter has such a funny little tail himself, just a  little white bunch of cotton, that such a handsome tail as Bobby  Coon's sometimes stirs just a wee bit of envy in Peter's heart.    But it wasn't envy so much as curiosity that prompted Peter to tease  for that story. Bobby Coon's tail is very handsome, you know. It has  beautiful rings of black and gray, and Peter didn't know of any other  tail at all like it. Somehow, he felt right down deep in his heart  that there must be a reason for those rings, just as there is a reason  for his own long ears and long legs. The more he thought about it, the  more he felt that he simply must know, and the only way he could find  out was from Grandfather Frog, who is very old and very wise. So he  teased and he teased until finally Grandfather Frog promised him that  on the next afternoon he would tell Peter why Bobby Coon has rings on  his tail. Peter hurried away to tell all the little meadow and forest  people, and the next afternoon they were all on hand on the bank of  the Smiling Pool to hear the story about Bobby Coon's tail.    \"Chug-a-rum!\" began Grandfather Frog, smoothing down his white and  yellow waistcoat. \"Chug-a-rum! Some folks seem to think that what they  do doesn't matter to anybody but themselves. That was the way with old  Mr. Rabbit, who lived a long time ago when the world was young. He  thought he could make all the trouble he pleased by his dreadful  curiosity, and if he was found out, no one would suffer but himself.  But it wasn't so. Here is Peter Rabbit, his grandchild a thousand  times removed, with long legs and long ears, and the bad habit of  curiosity, all because old Mr. Rabbit had a bad habit and didn't try  to overcome it.    \"It was the same way with old Mr. Coon. He was dishonest and stole  from Old King Bear. Old Mother Nature punished him by putting mustard  in his food, and Mr. Coon thought he was so smart that he could get  ahead of Old Mother Nature by washing all his food before he ate it.  Old Mother Nature didn't say anything, but watched him and smiled to  herself. You see, she knew that Mr. Coon was beginning a good habit, a  very good habit indeed--the habit of neatness. So, though she knew  perfectly well that he was doing it just to get ahead of her, she was  glad, for she was fond of Mr. Coon in spite of the bad ways he had  grown into, and she knew that good habits are like bad habits--once  started they grow and grow, and are very likely to lead to more good  habits.    \"It was so with Mr. Coon. He found that his food tasted better for  being so clean, and he grew very fussy about what he ate. No matter  where he found it or how tempting it looked, he wouldn't eat it until  he had carried it to the nearest water and washed it. He still  remembered the mustard and tried to fool himself into thinking that  he was simply spiting Old Mother Nature, but right down in his heart  he knew that even if he should be told that never again would there be  mustard in his food, he would wash it just the same.    \"One day, as he sat beside the Laughing Brook eating his supper, he  noticed that while his food had been washed clean, his hands were  dirty. They spoiled his supper. Yes, Sir, they spoiled his supper.    \"'What good does it do to wash my food, if I eat it out of dirty  hands?' said Mr. Coon to himself, and he hurried to a quiet little  pool to give them a good scrubbing. Then he washed his face and  brushed his coat. 'Now I feel better, and I know my supper will taste  better,' said he.    \"From that time he began to be particular, very particular, about  keeping himself clean, until finally there was no one on the Green  Meadows or in the Green Forest quite so neat as Mr. Coon.    \"Now at this time Mr. Coon had a very plain tail. It was all of one  color, a grayish white, not at all pretty. Mr. Coon used to think a  great deal about that tail and wish and wish that it was handsome.  Sometimes he used to envy Mr. Fox his beautiful red tail with its  black and white tip. One day, as he sat on an old log with his chin in  his hands, thinking about his tail, who should come along but Old  Mother Nature.    \"'Good morning, Mr. Coon,' said she in her pleasantest voice.    \"Mr. Coon got up and made a very low bow. 'Good morning, Mother  Nature,' he replied in his politest manner, which was very polite  indeed.    \"'What were you thinking about so hard?' asked Old Mother Nature.    \"Mr. Coon looked a little bit ashamed. Then he sighed. 'I was wishing  that my tail was handsomer,' said he. 'But it is a very good tail as  it is,' he added hastily.    \"Old Mother Nature's eyes twinkled. She sat down beside Mr. Coon and  asked him all about his affairs, just as if she didn't know all about  them already. She told him how pleased she was to find him so neat and  clean, and Mr. Coon just tingled all over with pleasure. At last she  got up to go, and her eyes twinkled more than ever, as she said:    \"'By the way, Mr. Coon, I am so pleased with your neatness that I am  leaving you a reward. I hope you will like it.'    \"Mr. Coon didn't see any reward, but he thanked her just the same, and  Old Mother Nature went on her way. Mr. Coon watched her out of sight.  Then he sat down on the old log again and scratched his head  thoughtfully as he looked this way and that.    \"'I wonder what she meant by reward. I don't see any anywhere,' he  said to himself.    \"By and by he just happened to glance at his tail. 'Oh!' cried Mr.  Coon, and then for a long time he couldn't say another word, but just  looked and looked with shining eyes and such a queer feeling of  happiness in his heart. You see, Old Mother Nature had left a  beautiful, broad, black ring around his tail. Mr. Coon couldn't do  anything the rest of that day but look at and admire that ring, until  his neck ached from twisting it around so long.    \"After that he was neater than ever, you may be sure, and the next  time Old Mother Nature came around, she left another handsome black  ring on his tail, because he hadn't grown careless, but had kept up  his good habits.    \"Now about this time, hard times came to all the little people of the  Green Forest and the Green Meadows. Every one began to grumble. Mr.  Bear grumbled. Mr. Fox grumbled. Mr. Rabbit grumbled. Mr. Jay  grumbled. Mr. Squirrel grumbled. Even Mr. Chuck grumbled. And one and  all they began to blame Old Mother Nature. Then they began to quarrel  among themselves and to steal from each other. Some even left their  homes and went out into the Great World to try to find a better place  to live, only to find that the Great World was a harder place to live  in than the Green Forest and the Green Meadows.    \"But Mr. Coon didn't grumble, and he didn't go away. No, Sir, Mr. Coon  just stuck to his home and did the best he could to find enough to  eat. He kept himself as neat as ever and was always cheerful."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14959"],[0,"The Hymns of Prudentius (#10)"],[1," O Christ, of all Thy servants Guide,      Mild is the yoke Thou mak'st us bear,    Leading us gently by Thy side          With gracious care.      Thy love took up our life's hard load      And spent in grievous toils its might:    Thy bond-slaves tread the easier road          Led by Thy light.      Nine hours have run their course away,      The sun sped three parts of its race:    And what remains of the short day          Fadeth apace.      The holy fast hath reached its end;      Our table now Thou loadest, Lord:    With all Thy gifts true gladness send          To grace our board.      Such is our Master's gentle sway,      So kind the teaching in His school,    That all find rest who will obey          His easy rule.      Thou would'st not have us scorn the grace      Of cleanliness and vesture fair:    Thou lovest not a soiled face          And unkempt hair.      Let him that fasts, Thou saidst, be clean,      Nor lose health's fair and ruddy glow:    Let no wan sallowness be seen          Upon his brow.      'Tis better in glad modesty      Of our good works to shun display:    God sees what 'scapes our neighbour's eye          And will repay.      That Shepherd keen seeks one lost sheep      Sickly and weak, strayed from the fold,    Fleece torn with briers of thickets deep,          Foolishly bold.      He drives the wolves far from the track:      And found He brings on shoulders borne    To sunlit pen the wanderer back,          No more forlorn:      Yea, to the meads and grassy fields      The lamb restores, where no thorn balks,    No rough burrs tear, no thistle yields          Its bristling stalks:      But leaves of green herbs brightly glance      And in the grove the palm-trees dream,    And laurels shade the eddying dance          Of crystal stream.      For all these gifts, O Shepherd dear,      What service can I render Thee?    No grateful vows my debt shall clear          For love so free.      Though by self-chosen fasts severe      Our strength of limb we waste away:    Though, spurning food, we Thee revere      By night and day:      Yet our works never can o'ertake      Thy love or with Thy gifts compare:    Our toils this earthen vessel break,          The more we dare.      Therefore lest failing powers consume      Our fragile life and shrivelled veins    Pale 'neath the tyranny of rheum          And weakening pains:      Thou dost not rule perpetual Lent      For man, nor modest fare deny:    Fearless may each unto his bent          His wants supply.      Enough that all our acts by prayer      Be sanctified unto Thy will,    Whether we fast, or with due care          Our needs fulfil.      Then shall God bless us for our good      And lead us to our soul's true wealth;    For, if but consecrated, food          Shall bring us health.      O Lord, grant that our feast may spread      Marrow and strength throughout our flesh:    And may all Christly souls be fed          With vigour fresh.                                 IX. HYMNUS OMNIS HORAE          Da puer plectrum, choreis ut canam fidelibus    dulce carmen et melodum, gesta Christi insignia:    hunc camena nostra solum pangat, hunc laudet lyra.        Christus est, quem rex sacerdos adfuturum protinus    infulatus concinebat voce, chorda et tympano,            5    spiritum caelo influentem per medullas hauriens.        Facta nos et iam probata pangimus miracula,    testis orbis est, nec ipsa terra, quod vidit, negat,    cominus Deum docendis proditum mortalibus.        Corde natus ex parentis, ante mundi exordium          10    alpha et _O_ cognominatus, ipse fons et clausula    omnium, quae sunt, fuerunt quaeque post futura sunt.        Ipse iussit et creata, dixit ipse, et facta sunt    terra, caelum, fossa ponti, trina rerum machina,    quaeque in his vigent sub alto solis et lunae globo.    15        Corporis formam caduci, membra morti obnoxia    induit, ne gens periret primoplasti ex germine,    merserat quam lex profundo noxialis tartaro.        O beatus ortus ille, virgo cum puerpera    edidit nostram salutem feta sancto spiritu,             20    et puer redemptor orbis os sacratum protulit.        Psallat altitudo  caeli, psallite omnes angeli,    quidquid est virtutis usquam psallat in laudem Dei:    nulla linguarum silescat, vox et omnis consonet.        Ecce quem vates vetustis concinebant seculis,         25    quem prophetarum fideles paginae spoponderant,    emicat promissus olim: cuncta conlaudent eum.        Cantharis infusa lympha fit Falernum nobile,    nuntiat vinum minister esse promptum ex hydria,    ipse rex sapore tinctis obstupescit poculis.            30        Membra morbis ulcerosa, viscerum putredines    mando, ut abluantur, inquit; fit ratum, quod iusserat,    turgidam cutem repurgant vulnerum piamina.        Tu perennibus tenebris iam sepulta lumina    inlinis limo salubri, sacri et oris nectare,            35    mox apertis hac medela lux reducta est orbibus.        Increpas ventum furentem, quod procellis tristibus    vertat aequor fundo ab imo, vexet et vagam ratem:    ille iussis obsecundat, mitis unda sternitur.        Extimum vestis sacratae furtim mulier attigit,        40    protinus salus secuta est, ora pallor deserit,    sistitur rivus, cruore qui fluebat perpeti.        Exitu dulcis iuventae raptum ephebum viderat,    orba quem mater supremis funerabat fletibus:    surge, dixit: ille surgit, matri et adstans redditur.   45        Sole iam quarto carentem, iam sepulcro absconditum    Lazarum iubet vigere reddito spiramine:    fetidum iecur reductus rursus intrat halitus.        Ambulat per stagna ponti, summa calcat fluctuum,    mobilis liquor profundi pendulam praestat viam,         50    nec fatiscit unda sanctis pressa sub vestigiis.        Suetus antro bustuali sub catenis frendere,    mentis inpos efferatis percitus furoribus    prosilit ruitque supplex, Christum adesse ut senserat.        Pulsa pestis lubricorum milleformis daemonum          55    conripit gregis suilli sordida spurcamina,    seque nigris mergit undis et pecus lymphaticum.        Quinque panibus peresis et gemellis piscibus    adfatim refecta iam sunt adcubantum milia,    fertque qualus ter quaternus ferculorum fragmina.       60        Tu cibus panisque noster, tu perennis suavitas;    nescit esurire in aevum, qui tuam sumit dapem,    nec lacunam ventris inplet, sed fovet vitalia.        Clausus aurium meatus et sonorum nescius    purgat ad praecepta Christi crassa quaeque obstacula,   65    vocibus capax fruendis ac susurris pervius.        Omnis aegritudo cedit, languor omnis pellitur,    lingua fatur, quam veterna vinxerant silentia,    gestat et suum per urbem laetus aeger lectulum.        Quin et ipsum, ne salutis inferi expertes forent,     70    tartarum benignus intrat, fracta cedit ianua,    vectibus cadit revulsis cardo indissolubilis.        Illa prompta ad inruentes, ad revertentes tenax,    obice extrorsum repulso porta reddit mortuos:    lege versa et limen atrum iam recalcandum patet.        75        Sed Deus dum luce fulva mortis antra inluminat,    dum stupentibus tenebris candidum praestat diem,    tristia squalentis aethrae palluerunt sidera.        Sol refugit et lugubri sordidus ferrugine    igneum reliquit axem seque maerens abdidit:             80    fertur horruisse mundus noctis aeternae chaos.        Solve vocem mens sonoram, solve linguam mobilem,    dic tropaeum passionis, dic triumphalem crucem,    pange vexillum, notatis quod refulget frontibus.        O novum caede stupenda vulneris miraculum!            85    hinc cruoris fluxit unda, lympha parte ex altera:    lympha nempe dat lavacrum, tum corona ex sanguine est.        Vidit anguis inmolatam corporis sacri hostiam,    vidit et fellis perusti mox venenum perdidit,    saucius dolore multo colla fractus sibilat.             90        Quid tibi, profane serpens, profuit, rebus novis    plasma primum perculisse versipelli hortamine?    diluit culpam recepto forma mortalis Deo.        Ad brevem se mortis usum dux salutis dedidit,    mortuos olim sepultos ut redire insuesceret,            95    dissolutis pristinorum vinculis peccaminum.        Tunc patres sanctique multi conditorem praevium    iam revertentem secuti tertio demum die    carnis indumenta sumunt, eque bustis prodeunt.        Cerneres coire membra de favillis aridis,            100    frigidum venis resumptis pulverem tepescere,    ossa, nervos, ac medullas glutino cutis tegi.        Post, ut occasum resolvit vitae et hominem reddidit,    arduum tribunal victor adscendit Patris,    inclitam caelo reportans passionis gloriam.            105        Macte index mortuorum, macte rex viventium,    dexter in parentis arce qui cluis virtutibus    omnium venturus inde iustus ultor criminum.        Te senes et te iuventus, parvulorum te chorus,    turba matrum virginumque simplices puellulae,          110    voce concordes pudicis perstrepant concentibus.        Fluminum lapsus et undae, littorum crepidines,    imber, aestus, nix, pruina, silva, et aura, nox, dies,    omnibus te concelebrent seculorum seculis.                                  IX. HYMN FOR ALL HOURS        Let me chant in sacred numbers, as I strike each sounding string,      Chant in sweet, melodious anthems, glorious deeds of Christ our King;    He, my Muse, shall be thy story; with His praise my lyre shall ring.      When the king in priestly raiment sang the Christ that was to be,      Voice and lute and clashing cymbal joined in joyous harmony,    While the Spirit, heaven-descended, touched his lips to prophecy.      Sing we now the works sure proven, wrought of God in mystic wise;      Heaven is witness; earth confesses how she saw with wondering eyes    God Himself with mortals mingling, man to teach in human guise.
