Caitilin in great concern hurried the children to the door of the cave  and kissed them good-bye.    \"Pan is sick,\" said the boy gravely.    \"I hope he will be well soon again,\" the girl murmured.    \"Yes, yes,\" said Caitilin, and she ran back quickly to her lord.          BOOK II. THE PHILOSOPHER'S JOURNEY        CHAPTER X    WHEN the children reached home they told the Philosopher-the result of  their visit. He questioned them minutely as to the appearance of  Pan, how he had received them, and what he had said in defence of his  iniquities; but when he found that Pan had not returned any answer  to his message he became very angry. He tried to persuade his wife to  undertake another embassy setting forth his abhorrence and defiance of  the god, but the Thin Woman replied sourly that she was a respectable  married woman, that having been already bereaved of her wisdom she had  no desire to be further curtailed of her virtue, that a husband would go  any length to asperse his wife's reputation, and that although she was  married to a fool her self-respect had survived even that calamity. The  Philosopher pointed out that her age, her appearance, and her tongue  were sufficient guarantees of immunity against the machinations of  either Pan or slander, and that he had no personal feelings in the  matter beyond a scientific and benevolent interest in the troubles  of Meehawl MacMurrachu; but this was discounted by his wife as the  malignant and subtle tactics customary to all husbands.    Matters appeared to be thus at a deadlock so far as they were  immediately concerned, and the Philosopher decided that he would lay the  case before Angus Og and implore his protection and assistance on behalf  of the Clann MacMurrachu. He therefore directed the Thin Woman to bake  him two cakes of bread, and set about preparations for a journey.    The Thin Woman baked the cakes, and put them in a bag, and early on the  following morning the Philosopher swung this bag over his shoulder, and  went forth on his quest.    When he came to the edge of the pine wood he halted for a few moments,  not being quite certain of his bearings, and then went forward again in  the direction of Gort na Cloca Mora. It came into his mind as he crossed  the Gort that he ought to call on the Leprecauns and have a talk with  them, but a remembrance of Meehawl MacMurrachu and the troubles under  which he laboured (all directly to be traced to the Leprecauns) hardened  his heart against his neighbours, so that he passed by the yew tree  without any stay. In a short time he came to the rough, heather-clumped  field wherein the children had found Pan, and as he was proceeding up  the hill, he saw Caitilin Ni Murrachu walking a little way in front with  a small vessel in her hand. The she-goat which she had just milked was  bending again to the herbage, and as Caitilin trod lightly in front of  him the Philosopher closed his eyes in virtuous anger and opened them  again in a not unnatural curiosity, for the girl had no clothes on. He  watched her going behind the brush and disappearing in the cleft of the  rock, and his anger, both with her and Pan, mastering him he forsook  the path of prudence which soared to the mountain top, and followed that  leading to the cave. The sound of his feet brought Caitilin out hastily,  but he pushed her by with a harsh word. \"Hussy,\" said he, and he went  into the cave where Pan was.    As he went in he already repented of his harshness and said \"The  human body is an aggregation of flesh and sinew, around a central bony  structure. The use of clothing is primarily to protect this organism  from rain and cold, and it may not be regarded as the banner of morality  without danger to this fundamental premise. If a person does not desire  to be so protected who will quarrel with an honourable liberty? Decency  is not clothing but Mind. Morality is behaviour. Virtue is thought; I  have often fancied,\" he continued to Pan, whom he was now confronting,  \"that the effect of clothing on mind must be very considerable, and that  it must have a modifying rather than an expanding effect, or, even, an  intensifying as against an exuberant effect. With clothing the whole  environment is immediately affected. The air, which is our proper  medium, is only filtered to our bodies in an abated and niggardly  fashion which can scarcely be as beneficial as the generous and  unintermitted elemental play. The question naturally arises whether  clothing is as unknown to nature as we have fancied? Viewed as a  protective measure against atmospheric rigour we find that many  creatures grow, by their own central impulse, some kind of exterior  panoply which may be regarded as their proper clothing. Bears, cats,  dogs, mice, sheep and beavers are wrapped in fur, hair, fell, fleece or  pelt, so these creatures cannot by any means be regarded as being naked.  Crabs, cockroaches, snails and cockles have ordered around them a crusty  habiliment, wherein their original nakedness is only to be discovered by  force, and other creatures have similarly provided themselves with  some species of covering. Clothing, therefore, is not an art, but an  instinct, and the fact that man is born naked and does not grow his  clothing upon himself from within but collects it from various distant  and haphazard sources is not any reason to call this necessity an  instinct for decency. These, you will admit, are weighty reflections and  worthy of consideration before we proceed to the wide and thorny subject  of moral and immoral action. Now, what is virtue?\" Pan, who had listened  with great courtesy to these remarks, here broke in on the Philosopher.    \"Virtue,\" said he, \"is the performance of pleasant actions.\"    The Philosopher held the statement for a moment on his forefinger.    \"And what, then, is vice?\" said he.    \"It is vicious,\" said Pan, \"to neglect the performance of pleasant  actions.\"    \"If this be so,\" the other commented, \"philosophy has up to the present  been on the wrong track.\"    \"That is so,\" said Pan. \"Philosophy is an immoral practice because it  suggests a standard of practice impossible of being followed, and which,  if it could be followed, would lead to the great sin of sterility.\"    \"The idea of virtue,\" said the Philosopher, with some indignation, \"has  animated the noblest intellects of the world.\"    \"It has not animated them,\" replied Pan; \"it has hypnotised them so  that they have conceived virtue as repression and self-sacrifice as an  honourable thing instead of the suicide which it is.\"    \"Indeed,\" said the Philosopher; \"this is very interesting, and if it is  true the whole conduct of life will have to be very much simplified.\"    \"Life is already very simple,\" said Pan; \"it is to be born and to die,  and in the interval to eat and drink, to dance and sing, to marry and  beget children.\"    \"But it is simply materialism,\" cried the Philosopher.    \"Why do you say 'but'?\" replied Pan.    \"It is sheer, unredeemed animalism,\" continued his visitor.    \"It is any name you please to call it,\" replied Pan.    \"You have proved nothing,\" the Philosopher shouted.    \"What can be sensed requires no proof.\"    \"You leave out the new thing,\" said the Philosopher. \"You leave out  brains. I believe in mind above matter. Thought above emotion. Spirit  above flesh.\"    \"Of course you do,\" said Pan, and he reached for his oaten pipe.    The Philosopher ran to the opening of the passage and thrust Caitilin  aside. \"Hussy,\" said he fiercely to her, and he darted out.    As he went up the rugged path he could hear the pipes of Pan, calling  and sobbing and making high merriment on the air.        CHAPTER XI    \"SHE does not deserve to be rescued,\" said the Philosopher, \"but I will  rescue her. Indeed,\" he thought a moment later, \"she does not want to be  rescued, and, therefore, I will rescue her.\"    As he went down the road her shapely figure floated before his eyes as  beautiful and simple as an old statue. He wagged his head angrily at the  apparition, but it would not go away. He tried to concentrate his mind  on a deep, philosophical maxim, but her disturbing image came between  him and his thought, blotting out the latter so completely that a moment  after he had stated his aphorism he could not remember what it had been.  Such a condition of mind was so unusual that it bewildered him.    \"Is a mind, then, so unstable,\" said he, \"that a mere figure, an  animated geometrical arrangement can shake it from its foundations?\"    The idea horrified him: he saw civilisation building its temples over a  volcano...    \"A puff,\" said he, \"and it is gone. Beneath all is chaos and red  anarchy, over all a devouring and insistent appetite. Our eyes tell  us what to think about, and our wisdom is no more than a catalogue of  sensual stimuli.\"    He would have been in a state of deep dejection were it not that through  his perturbation there bubbled a stream of such amazing well-being as he  had not felt since childhood. Years had toppled from his shoulders. He  left one pound of solid matter behind at every stride. His very skin  grew flexuous, and he found a pleasure in taking long steps such as he  could not have accounted for by thought. Indeed, thought was the one  thing he felt unequal to, and it was not precisely that he could not  think but that he did not want to.

Here the assonance is _u-er_ (final unstressed _-er_ in  standard present-day English represents vocalic _r_).]    Assonance of alternate lines is the usual rime of the  _romances_, as in:      Cabellos de mi cabeza    lleganme al corvej=o=n;    los cabellos de mi barba    por manteles tengo y=o=:    las unas de las mis manos    por cuchillo tajad=o=r.

(P. 1, 11. 1-8)    Here the assonance is _i-a_.[23]    [Footnote 23: The _romances viejos_ were originally in  lines of approximately sixteen syllables, and every line  then had assonance.]        Del salon en el angulo obscuro,    De su dueno tal vez olvid=a=d=a=,    Silenciosa y cubierta de polvo          Veiase el =a=rp=a=.      iCuanta nota dormia en sus cuerdas,    Como el pajaro duerme en las r=a=m=a=s,    Esperando la mano de nieve          Que sabe arranc=a=rl=a=s!       (P. 122, ll. 12-19)    Here the assonance is _a-a_.    The following rules for assonance should be noted:    _(a)_ In modern Spanish a word stressed on the final  syllable may not assonate with one stressed on a syllable  preceding the final.[24]    [Footnote 24: In the old _romances_ and in the medieval  epic, _a_ could assonate with _a-a._ In singing these  old verses every line was probably made to end in an  unstressed vowel by adding paragogic _e_ to a final  stressed syllable. Thus, _son_ was sung as _sone, dar_ as  _dare, temi_ as _temie_, etc. Cf. Men. Pel., _Ant._ V, 65;  XI, 86, 92; and Men. Pid., _Cantar de mio Cid_, I, 65 f.]    _(b)_ A word stressed on the penult may assonate with one       page lx stressed on the antepenult. Vowels between the  stressed syllable and the final syllable are disregarded,  as in _cruza, cupula (u-a), bane, margenes, arabes (a-e)._    _(c)_ In stressed diphthongs and triphthongs only the  vowels receiving the stress assonate, as in _vale, aire  (a-e), cabellos, suelo (e-o), envolviendo, aposento (e-o),  guardias, alta (a-a), pleito, siento (e-o), mucho, triunfo  (u-o)._    _(d)_ In unstressed diphthongs and triphthongs only the  strong vowels assonate, as in _turba, lluvia (u-a),  licencia, quisierais (e-a), pido, continuo (i-o)_.  Similarly, _e_ or _o_, before another strong vowel, is  disregarded in an unstressed diphthong, as in _modo,  erroneo (o-o), crece, heroe (e-e)_.    _(e)_ In final unstressed syllables, _i_ and _u_ (not in  diphthongs) assonate with _e_ and _o_, respectively, as  in _verde, debil (e-e), amante, facil (a-e), liquido,  espiritu (i-o)_.    (3) In Spanish blank verse (_versos sueltos, libres,  blancos_) there is usually no rime; or if there be rime  it is merely incidental. Blank verse usually consists of  11-syllable lines.      iOh! icuanto rostro veo, a mi censura,    De palidez y de rubor cubierto!    Animo, amigos, nadie tema, nadie,    Su punzante aguijon; que yo persigo    En mi satira el vicio, no al vicioso.          (P. 39, ll. 3-7)    Blank verse is little used in Spanish. It occurs chiefly  in serious satirical or philosophical poems. But separate  _versos sueltos_ are introduced into some varieties of  compositions, such as the _romance, seguidilla, silva_,  etc.[25]    [Footnote 25: The _versos sueltos_ are, with regard to the  absence of rime, in imitation of classic Greek and Latin  verse. They came into Spain by way of Italy during the  Renaissance movement. Abjured by the romanticists, they  were restored to favor by Nunez de Arce.]                                                            page lxi  VERSE-MEASURES    A. VERSE WITH BINARY MOVEMENT[26]    [Footnote 26: The term \"binary\" is used here to distinguish  ordinary Spanish verse from that with regular ternary  movement. Cf. p. lxx.]      In modern Spanish this verse is commonly found in lines of  seven, eight or eleven syllables. It may occur in lines  of any length; but in lines of five or six syllables the  binary and ternary movements are generally mingled. In  Old Spanish binary lines of approximately 8+8 and 7+7  syllables were common, and lines of 6+6, or of nine,  syllables were then, as now, also occasionally used.[27]    [Footnote 27: Verses of three or four syllables are  best treated as half-lines, with inner rime (_versos  leoninos_).]    The most popular measure, and the one of most importance  in the history of Spanish verse, is the 8+8-syllable line  of the old _romances_, which was later divided into two  8-syllable lines, and became the most common measure in  the drama and in popular songs. This line usually has  only one rhythmic accent, which falls on the seventh  syllable.[28]    [Footnote 28: By \"rhythmic accent\" is meant the musical  accent on the last stressed syllable of a phrase and not  syllabic stresses that may occur within a phrase.]      Mis arreos son las armas,    mi descanso el pelear,    mi cama las duras penas,    mi dormir siempre velar      (p. 5, ll. 1-4)                                                                page lxii  Rarely 8-syllable lines are written with a fixed accent on  the third syllable (cf. p. 51, l. 10 f.).[29] There is then  sometimes _pie quebrado_ in alternate lines, as in:      Hijo mio mucho amado,      Para mientes;    No contrastes a las gentes      Mal su grado.    Ama: e seras amado;      Y podras    Hazer lo que no haras      Desamado.[30]    [Footnote 29: They are less common in Spanish than in  Italian:      Sai tu dirme, o fanciullino,    In qual pasco gita sia    La vezzosa Egeria mia    Ch'io pur cerco dal mattino?        (Paolo A. Rolli)]    [Footnote 30: Note the example of hiatus in this older  Spanish.]    Next to the popular 8-syllable line the most important  measure in modern Spanish verse is that of eleven  syllables, with binary movement, which came to Spain from  Italy in the fifteenth century, and was generally accepted  by the writers of the Siglo de Oro. This 11-syllable line,  though of foreign origin, has held the boards as the chief  erudite measure in Spanish verse for four centuries, and  taken all in all it is the noblest metrical form for  serious poems in modern Spanish. A striking peculiarity  of the line is its flexibility. It is not divided into  hemistichs as were its predecessors, the 14-syllable  Alexandrine and the 12-syllable _arte mayor_ verse; but  it consists of two phrases and the position of the inner  rhythmic accent is usually variable.                                                               page lxiii  A well constructed line of this type has a rhythmic accent  on the sixth syllable, or a rhythmic accent on the fourth  syllable (usually with syllabic stress on the eighth),  beside the necessary accent in the tenth position.  Generally the inner accent falls on the sixth syllable  approximately twice as often as on the fourth.      Y con diversas flores va esparciendo... (Leon)    Y para envejecerse florecieron... (Calderon)    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    Cuna y sepulcro en un boton hallaron... (Calderon)    Se mira al mundo a nuestros pies tendido... (Zorrilla)    Logically, the close of the first phrase should coincide  with the end of the word that receives the inner rhythmic  accent, and this is usually so, as in:      ?Que tengo yo, | que mi amistad procuras?... (Lope)    Son la verdad y Dios, | Dios verdadero... (Quevedo)    But in some lines the rhetorical and the rhythmic accents  do not coincide, as in:              ... pero huyose    El pudor a vivir en las cabanas... (Jovellanos)    Del plectro sabiamente meneado... (Leon)    Que a mi puerta, cubierto de rocio... (Lope)    The 11-syllable line may be used alone. Cf. the sonnets of  Lope de Vega (p. 14) and Calderon (p. 18), the _Epistola  satirica_ of Quevedo (p. 15), the blank verse of  Jovellanos (p. 38) and Nunez de Arce (p. 144), _et al._  The neo-classic poets of the eighteenth century and some  of the earlier romanticists even used it in _redondillas_  or assonated:                                                 page lxiv      En pago de este amor que, mal mi gr=ado=,    Hasta el crimen me lleva en su del=irio=,    Y a no verse por ti menospreci=ado=    Mi virtud elevara hasta el mart=irio=...      ?Por que de nuevo palida tristeza    Tus rosadas mejillas descol=o=r=a=?    ?Por que tu rostro en lagrimas se inunda?    ?Por que suspiras, nina, y te acong=o=j=a=s?    (Breton de los Herreros, _?Quien es ella?_)    But the poets of the Siglo de Oro and the neo-classic  poets generally used it in combination with 7-syllable  lines, as in Leon's verses:      iQue descansada vida    la del que huye el mundanal rueido,    y sigue la escondida    senda por donde han ido    los pocos sabios que en el mundo han sido!    Strophes of three 11-syllable lines and one 5-syllable  line (_versos saficos_) are not uncommon in highly lyric  poems. Usually, in the long lines, the inner accent falls  on the fourth syllable, with syllabic stress on the  eighth, and with cesura after the fifth syllable. Thus:[31]      Dulce vecino de la verde selva,    Huesped eterno del Abril florido,    Vital aliento de la madre Venus,      Cefiro blando.      (Villegas, _Al cefiro_)    [Footnote 31: Mele (_op. cit_) states that the Sapphic ode  was introduced into Spain from Italy by Antonio Agustin,  bishop of Tarragona, in the first half of the sixteenth  century, and quotes these lines by Agustin:      Jupiter torna, como suele, rico:    Cuerno derrama Jove copioeso,    Ya que bien puede el pegaseo monte      Verse y la cumbre.                                                                 page lxv  The romanticists used the _versos saficos_ with rime.
