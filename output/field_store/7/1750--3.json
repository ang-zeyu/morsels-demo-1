He was received with deafening cheers, and shrieks of \"No waits!\"  \"Manager!\" \"Don't hurry, Grim!\" \"We'll send out for supper!\" \"We want  Cherry!\" \"Go off,\" etc.    When Grim could get a word in he panted, \"Gentlemen, I am sorry to say  B.A.M. Cherry is indisposed and cannot favour you with the epilogue.\"    \"Funked it!\" roared all the delighted juniors.    \"He says he is unwell,\" said Grim, anger getting the better of him, \"but  he'll be a jolly sight worse in the morning.\"    There was a hurricane of thunderous cheers at this sally, but Grim managed  to shout above the laughing, \"I have great pleasure in announcing that  John Acton, Esq., will take Fruity's--I mean Cherry's--place and tell you  a little tale; even Corker fags will understand it,\" added Grim,  viciously.    Acton came on and received his hearty welcome with easy good nature. He  plunged right into his contribution: \"A London cabby's account of his  different fares\"--from the double-superfine gilt-edged individual to the  fat old dowager who _will_ have the parrot inside with her. Acton  gave it perfectly. Grim, who had his ears glued to the exit door, vowed he  could almost hear the swell drop his eyeglass.    Sharpe stepped on to the stage amid the polite attentions of his natural  enemies. \"Be a man, Sharpe.\" \"Don't cry.\" \"You'll see mamma soon.\" \"Speak  up.\" \"He did it all alone, remember.\" \"No help.\" \"Oh, dear no!\"         \"When on the bosom of the sleeping pool,       That's shaded o'er by trees in greenest dress,       Upon its breast of snow its gem of gold       The water lily swims--\"    The juniors howled with dismay at this commencement, and Corker juniors  instantly began to keep time to Sharpe's delivery in the organ-grinder's  fashion. But Sharpe toiled remorselessly on. He compared Biffen's house to  a water lily growing in a muddy pond, and again as a Phoenix risen from  the ashes; and he gave us, with circumstantial details, every round of the  footer housers, their two eleven caps, and the Perry Exhibition, and  darkly hinted at Acton's exclusion from the eleven.    He wound up his awful farrago in one glorious burst of solemn fury--         \"And even Fate girds on her sword, and her right arm she stiffens,       As thunders to the icy pole the glorious name of Biffen's.\"    When Sharpe finally made his bow, according to the invariable custom,  every junior except a Biffenite imitated with rare fidelity the mixed  sensations of channel passengers after a stormy passage.    Sharpe, cheered to the echo by the Biffenites on the front row, went  proudly off.    The Dervishes were received with enthusiasm, and went through their  performance to the shouts of \"Well wriggled, Java!\" \"Why don't you oil!\"  \"Do it again--orang-outang!\" They amiably smiled acknowledgments as they  backed away.    Then I myself stepped on to the stage, prepared to judge the two-minutes'  rounds. Grim had whipped up sixteen fags, each willing to do battle for  the honour of his house. The rounds proceeded to the accompaniment of  ear-splitting encouragement, and I had the satisfaction of knowing that  not a solitary one of the defeated heroes thought he had really been  beaten on points.    No mistake about it, Biffen's had a fag who could sing. Thurston's \"My  First Cigar\" only lacked one thing--it should have lasted a little longer  to suit the audience.      \"She called it an Intimidad,      It had spots of a yellowish hue,    She said the best brands always had,      And I firmly believed it was true.\"    A good number of the fellows knew \"The Soldiers in the Park,\" and Brown  hammered it out in a good old breezy style.    As he was racing home, and the jolly chorus was crashing out from the  piano, one fag started \"Oh, listen to the band!\"    Instantly the whole school, juniors and seniors as well, joined in the  chorus, keeping time with their feet.      \"Oh, listen to the band!    Who doesn't love to hark      To the shout of 'Here they come'      And the banging of the drum--    Oh, listen to the soldiers in the park.\"    When the dust had settled, every one acknowledged that Biffen's concert  was going with a bang. I am not going to bore you with a longer account of  Biffen's concert. Thurston sang \"Alice, where art thou?\" the fellows  telling him between the verses that \"She wasn't going to come,\" \"Spoony  songs barred,\" etc., and Rogers carried off the fags' boxing competition  with a big rush in the final round, and Biffen's crew howled with delight.    Finally the bell rang for Acton's song. Brown rattled through the  preliminary bars, and the song commenced. The singer held himself slightly  forward, in a rather stiff and awkward fashion, and his eyes were staring  intently into vacancy. There was not the shadow of a shade of any  expression in his face. A feeling of pity for Acton was the universal  sensation when the first words fell from his lips. Acton had not the ghost  of a singing voice, and the school shuddered at the awful exhibition.  There was an icy silence, but Acton croaked remorselessly on. This is the  song:--      \"Jim and I as children played together,      Best of chums for many years were we;    I had no luck--was, alas! a Jonah;      Jim, my chum, was lucky as could be.        Oh, lucky Jim! How I envied him!      \"Years rolled by, and death took Jim away, boys,      Left his widow, and she married me;    Now we're married oft I think of Jim, boys,      Sleeping in that churchyard by the sea.        Oh, lucky Jim! How I envy him!\"    As the words followed on there was a suggestion of oddity in that awful  voice singing a comic song, and there were a few suppressed laughs at the  idea. As the song progressed, the utter dreary weariness of the voice, and  the rather funny words, compelled the fellows to laugh in uncontrollable  bursts; but still Acton never turned a hair. When he arrived at the  churchyard lines there was one universal howl of delight. Brown stopped  dead at the end of the second last line, and Acton stopped dead too.  Instantly all the fellows became as mute as fish. The singer straightened  himself up, looked round the room with a mocking smile while one might  count a dozen, and then winked to Brown, who recommenced softly on the  piano. Then Acton _sang_ slowly and deliberately--sang with a voice  as clear and as tunable as a silver bell--      \"Oh, lucky Jim! How I envy him!\"    His croak was a pretence--he had hoaxed us all! Before we recovered from  our stupefaction he had vanished. The school clamoured for his return,  but though they cheered for three minutes on end Acton did not reappear,  and Brown struck up \"God save the Queen!\" Biffen's concert was at an end!    Grim held a five minutes' meeting among the Biffenites before bed.    \"There's never been a fellow like Acton in St. Amory's. He goes away at  nine to-morrow. The Great Midland are going to stop their express to pick  up St. Amory fellows, and Acton goes up to his place by that. I vote we  all go in a body to the station and cheer him off. We keep it dark, of  course.\" This _staccato_ oration was agreed to with acclamation, and  Biffenites went to bed happy.    On the morrow Acton strolled into the station and espied the Biffenites,  who were scattered up and down the platform with careful carelessness.  The train came in, and at once the juniors crowded _en masse_ round  the carriage in which Acton had secured a corner seat, and stood talking  to Grim, who was in fine feather.    At that very moment Phil Bourne and young Jack Bourne bustled into the  station. An idea struck Rogers, and he said to all his chums, \"Here's  Bourne, you fellows; let him know we see him.\"    The fags were delighted, and when Bourne entered the carriage next  Acton's there was a long-drawn-out hoot for his especial benefit.    \"Another,\" said Rogers, whereat more soulful groans.    \"The last,\" said Rogers, and Bourne took his seat to a chorus of hisses  and tortured howls. He smiled a little and opened his paper, while the  people in the carriage looked curiously at him.    The guard's whistle went and Acton sprang in. \"Good-bye.\"    As the train moved, Grim said, \"Three cheers for Acton!\"    \"Hip, hip, hurrah! Hip, hip, hurrah!\"    \"A groan for Bourne!\" Acton smiled good naturedly to his henchmen. As he  glided past he said to himself softly, \"And yet I have not quite hoed all  my row out either, Bourne. Wait, my friend, wait!\"    [Illustration: AS THE TRAIN MOVED, GRIM SAID, \"THREE CHEERS!\"]          CHAPTER X    THE YOUNG BROTHER      When St. Amory's reassembled after the holidays Acton found himself  firmly established in the good graces of the fellows, and, indeed, he was  not far from being the most popular fellow in the place, but poor Phil  was looked coldly upon by those who had been his chiefest friends, and,  by those who knew little of him, he passed for a jealous bounder. Acton  played up to his cards in beautiful style, and acted the forgiving  innocent splendidly; but Phil, who was only a very honest fellow, did not  play anything to speak of. Those who gave him the cold shoulder once  never had a second chance of showing it him, for Phil was no end proud;  but he had still one or two friends, who condoned his passing of Acton  for the \"footer\" cap on the ground of \"insufficient information\" thereon.  Roberts and Baines and Vercoe were not a bad trio to have for friends  either. Acton was now in the Sixth, and a monitor.    His main idea was to keep Bourne in the bad books of the school until  such time as he could direct their ill-favour into channels favourable to  himself and unfavourable for Phil. A lucky chance seemed to open to him  an easy method of striking at Bourne, and Acton almost hugged himself  with joy at his windfall.    About a week after the holidays Acton had been skating on the Marsh, and  as he was returning he came"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14776"],[0,"The Arabian Art of Taming and Training Wild & Vicious Horses (#10)"],[1,"urs, according to the nature of the case.      CURE FOR THE HEAVES.    Give 30 grains of tartar emetic every week until cured.      PROCESS OF CAUSING A HORSE TO LAY DOWN.    Approach him gently upon the left side, fasten a strap around the ancle of  his fore-foot; then raise the foot gently, so as to bring the knee against  the breast and the foot against the belly. The leg being in this position,  fasten the strap around his arm, which will effectually prevent him from  putting that foot to the ground again. Then fasten a strap around the  opposite leg, and bring it over his shoulder, on the left side, so that  you can catch hold of it; then push these gently, and when he goes to  fall, pull the strap, which will bring him on his knees.    Now commence patting him under the belly; by continuing your gentle  strokes upon the belly, you will, in a few minutes, bring him to his knees  behind. Continue the process, and he will lie entirely down, and submit  himself wholly to your treatment. By thus proceeding gently, you may  handle his feet and legs in any way you choose.    However wild and fractious a horse may be naturally, after practicing this  process a few times, you will find him perfectly gentle and submissive,  and even disposed to follow you anywhere, and unwilling to leave you on  any occasion.    Unless the horse be wild, the first treatment will be all sufficient; but  should he be too fractious to be approached in a manner necessary to  perform the first named operation, this you will find effectual, and you  may then train your horse to harness or anything else with the utmost  ease.    In breaking horses for harness, after giving the powders, put the harness  on gently, without startling him, and pat him gently, then fasten _the  chain_ to a log, which he will draw for an indefinite length of time. When  you find him sufficiently gentle, place him to a wagon or other vehicle.    NOTE.--Be _extremely_ careful in catching a horse, not to affright him.  After he is caught, and the powders given, rub him gently on the head,  neck, back and legs, and on each side of the eyes, the way the hair lies,  but be very careful not to whip, for a young horse is equally passionate  with yourself, and this pernicious practice has ruined many fine and  valuable horses. When you are riding a colt (or even an old horse), do not  whip him if he scares, but draw the bridle, so that his eye may rest upon  the object which has affrighted him, and pat him upon the neck as you  approach it; by this means you will pacify him, and render him less liable  to start in future.      MEANS OF LEARNING A HORSE TO PACE.    Buckle a four pound weight around the ancles of his hind legs, (lead is  preferable) ride your horse briskly with those weights upon his ancles, at  the same time, twitching each rein of the bridle alternately, by this  means you will immediately throw him into a pace. After you have trained  him in this way to some extent, change your leaded weights for something  lighter; leather padding, or something equal to it, will answer the  purpose; let him wear these light weights until he is perfectly trained.  This process will make a smooth and easy pacer of any horse.      HORSEMANSHIP.    The rider should, in the first place, let the horse know that he is not  afraid of him. Before mounting a horse, take the rein into the left hand,  draw it tightly, put the left foot in the stirrup, and raise quickly. When  you are seated press your knees to the saddle, let your leg, from the  knee, stand out; turn your toe in and heel out; sit upright in your  saddle, throw your weight forward--one third of it in the stirrups--and  hold your rein tight. Should your horse scare, you are braced in your  saddle and he cannot throw you.      INDICATION OF A HORSE'S DISPOSITION.    A long, thin neck indicates a good disposition, contrariwise, if it be  short and thick. A broad forehead, high between the ears, indicates a very  vicious disposition.      CURES, &C.    _Cure for the Founder._--Let 1-1/2 gallons of blood from the neck vein,  make frequent applications of hot water to his forelegs; after which,  bathe them in wet cloths, then give one quart Linseed Oil. The horse will  be ready for service the next day.    _Botts._--Mix one pint honey with one quart sweet milk, give as a drench,  one hour after, dissolve 1 oz. pulverized Coperas in a pint of water, use  likewise, then give one quart of Linseed Oil. Cure effectual.    _Colic._--After bleeding copiously in the mouth, take a half pound of raw  cotton, wrap it around a coal of fire in such a way as to exclude the air;  when it begins to smoke, hold it under the horse's nose until he becomes  easy. Cure certain in ten minutes.    _Distemper._--Take 1-1/2 gallons blood from the neck vein, then give a  dose of Sassafras Oil, 1-1/2 ounces is sufficient. Cure speedy and  certain.    _Fistula._--When it makes its appearance, rowel both sides of the  shoulder; if it should break, take one ounce of verdigris, 1 ounce oil  rosin, 1 ounce copperas, pulverize and mix together. Use it as a salve.      RECEIPT FOR BONE SPAVIN OR RING-BONE.    Take a table-spoonful of corrosive sublimate; quicksilver about the size  of a bean; 3 or 4 drops of muriatic acid; iodine about the size of a pea,  and lard enough to form a paste; grind the iodine and sublimate fine as  flour, and put altogether in a cup, mix well, then shear the hair all off  the size you want; wash clean with soap-suds, rub dry, then apply the  medicine. Let it stay on five days; if it does not take effect, take it  off, mix it over with a little more lard, and add some fresh medicine.  When the lump comes out, wash it clean in soap-suds, then apply a poultice  of cow dung, leave it on twelve hours, then apply healing medicine.      TEMPERANCE BEVERAGE.    One quart of water, three pounds of sugar, one teaspoonful of lemon oil,  one table-spoonful of flour, with the white of four eggs, well beat up.  Mix the above well together, then divide the syrup, and add four ounces of  carbonic soda in one-half, and three ounces of tartaric acid in the other  half; then bottle for use.      SARSAPARILLA SYRUP.    One ounce Sarsaparilla, two pounds brown sugar, ten drops wintergreen, and  half pint of water.            \"THE MOST WONDERFUL BOOK EVER WRITTEN.\"    ESOTERIC ANTHROPOLOGY    INTERIOR SCIENCE OF MAN.    A Comprehensive and Confidential Treaties on the Structure and Functions,  Passional attractions and Perversions; True and False Physical and Social  Conditions, and the most intimate relations of men and women. By T.L.  Nichols, M.D. 482 pages, 81 engravings, cloth.    THIS BOOK IS ALL THAT ITS TITLE INDICATES.--It treats of the  generation, formation, birth, infancy youth, manhood, old age, and death  of man; of health and disease, marriage and celibacy, virtue and vice,  happiness and misery; of education, development and the laws of a true  life. It is intended to answer all questions, and to give the fullest and  most reliable information on every subject of a physiological or medical  nature--to be a faithful friend in health and disease, and in all the  conditions of life, especially to the young of both sexes, and those who  are about to enter upon new relations.    It contains the highest and deepest truths in Human Physiology, with their  individual and social application; the true nature and hidden causes of  disease; the condition of health, physical and passional; all that  information which every human being needs, which few dare to ask for, or  know how to obtain, but which, amid the discordances of civilization, is  of priceless value.    The portion of the work on the generative system, is written with entire  frankness and fully illustrated, and is unquestionably the most remarkable  exposition of the physical, spiritual, and passional nature of man ever  written--so remarkable indeed, that it has seemed to many persons to be  the result of direct inspiration. The whole subject of the relations of  the sexes, or love, marriage, and paternity, is laid open, as it never has  been by any other author. A miscellaneous chapter, forming an appendix to  this portion of the work, is also of a very remarkable character. It has  been truly said, \"There can scarcely be any important question, which any  man or woman can ever need to ask a physician, to which this book does not  contain an answer.\" The diseases of the generative system, physical and  passional, are treated of with great fitness.    Hundreds of voluntary testimonials to the extraordinary character and  merits of this book have been received from persons eminently qualified to  judge, among which are clergymen, physicians, lawyers, college professors,  etc. We select the following:         \"I look upon it,\" says Dr. STEPHENS, of Forest City, N.Y., \"as the       most wonderful book ever written. It marks a new era in literature       and life.\"         \"What a pity,\" says Dr. SCHELL, of Ind., \"that a copy cannot be       found in every family in the whole world!\"         \"This book,\" says Dr. DODGE, of Owego, N.Y., \"contains more that is       weighty in fact, and sound in philosophy; more that is useful in       medical science and effective in medical art; more that is       purificative and elevative of man than any one work, in volumes few       or many that has ever grace the Librarie Medicale of civilization.\"         \"It contains,\" says Dr. BAKER, of Racine, Wis. \"just such knowledge       as a suffering world needs, to enlighten, develop, and ennoble the       minds of the people.\"         Dr. FARRAR, of Portland, Me., says, \"Esoteric Anthropology is vital       in every part, refreshing every man's and woman's soul that reads       it with a most grateful sense of its truth and importance. I know       of no work in the world like it, or comparable with it.\"         \"I have read 'ESOTERIC ANTHROPOLOGY' with all the deep earnestness       and"]]]
