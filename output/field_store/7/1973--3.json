His conduct, however, very ill agreed with this declaration; nor can it  be excused on any other supposition but that of his being governed, in  some cases against his own inclination, by the count D'Avaux and the  Irish catholics, on whom his whole dependence was placed. As both houses  were chiefly filled with members of that persuasion, we ought not to  wonder at their bringing in a bill for repealing the act of settlement,  by which the protestants of the kingdom had been secured in the  possession of their estates. These were by this law divested of their  lands, which reverted to the heirs of those catholics to whom they  belonged before the rebellion. This iniquitous bill was framed in such  a manner, that no regard was paid to such protestant owners as had  purchased estates for valuable considerations; no allowance was made for  improvements, nor any provision for protestant widows; the possessor,  and tenants were not even allowed to remove their stock and corn. When  the bill was sent up to the lords, Dr. Dopping, bishop of Meath, opposed  it with equal courage and ability, and an address in behalf of the  purchasers under the act of settlement was presented to the king by the  earl of Granard; but notwithstanding these remonstrances, it received  the royal assent, and the protestants of Ireland were mostly ruined.          THEY PASS AN ACT OF ATTAINDER.    Yet in order to complete their destruction, an act of attainder was  passed against all protestants, whether male or female, whether of high  or low degree, who were absent from the kingdom, as well as against all  those who retired into any part of the three kingdoms, which did not own  the authority of king James, or corresponded with rebels, or were any  ways aiding, abetting, or assisting them, from the first day of August  in the preceding year. The number of protestants attainted by name in  this act amounted to about three thousand, including two archbishops,  one duke, seventeen earls, seven countesses, as many bishops, eighteen  barons, three-and-thirty baronets, one-and-fifty knights, eighty-three  clergymen, who were declared traitors, and adjudged to suffer the pains  of death and forfeiture. The individuals subjected to this dreadful  proscription, were even cut off from all hope of pardon and all benefit  of appeal; for by a clause in the act, the king's pardon was deemed null  unless enrolled before the first day of December. A subsequent law was  enacted, declaring Ireland independent of the English parliament. This  assembly passed another act, granting twenty thousand pounds per annum  out of the forfeited estates to Tyrconnel, in acknowledgment of his  signal services: they imposed a tax of twenty thousand pounds per month  for the service of the king: the royal assent was given to an act for  liberty of conscience; they enacted that the tithes payable by papists  should be delivered to priests of that communion: the maintenance of  the protestant clergy in cities and corporations was taken away; and all  dissenters were exempted from ecclesiastical jurisdictions. So that  the established church was deprived of all power and prerogative,  notwithstanding the express promise of James, who had declared,  immediately after his landing, that he would maintain the clergy in  their rights and privileges.          JAMES COINS BASE MONEY.    Nor was the king less arbitrary in the executive part of his government,  if we suppose that he countenanced the grievous acts of oppression that  were daily committed upon the protestant subjects of Ireland; but the  tyranny of his proceedings may be justly imputed to the temper of  his ministry, consisting of men abandoned to all sense of justice and  humanity, who acted from the dictates of rapacity and revenge, inflamed  with all the acrimony of religious rancour. Soldiers were permitted to  live upon free quarter; the people were robbed and plundered; licenses  and protections were abused in order to extort money from the trading  part of the nation. The king's old stores were ransacked; the shops of  tradesmen and the kitchens of burghers were pillaged, to supply the mint  with a quantity of brass, which was converted into current coin for his  majesty's occasions; an arbitrary value was set upon it, and all persons  were required and commanded to take it in payment under the severest  penalties, though the proportion between its intrinsic worth and  currency was nearly as one to three hundred. A vast sum of this  counterfeit coin was issued in the course of one year, and forced upon  the protestants in payment of merchandize, provision, and necessaries  for the king's service. James, not content with the supply granted by  parliament, imposed, by his own authority, a tax of twenty thousand  pounds per month on chattels, as the former was laid upon lands. This  seems to have been a temporary expedient during the adjournment of the  two houses, as the term of the assessment was limited to three months;  it was however levied by virtue of a commission under the seals, and  seems to have been a stretch of prerogative the less excusable, as he  might have obtained the money in a parliamentary way. Understanding that  the protestants had laid out all their brass money in purchasing great  quantities of hides, tallow, wool, and corn, he assumed the despotic  power of fixing the prices of these commodities, and then bought them  for his own use. One may see his ministers were bent upon the utter  destruction of those unhappy people.          PROTESTANT CHURCHES SEIZED BY THE CATHOLICS.    All vacancies in public schools were supplied with popish teachers. The  pension allowed from the exchequer to the university of Dublin was  cut off; the vice-provost, fellows, and scholars, were expelled: their  furniture, plate, and public library were seized without the least  shadow or pretence, and in direct violation of a promise the king had  made to preserve their privileges and immunities. His officers converted  the college into a garrison, the chapel into a magazine, and the  apartments into prisons; a popish priest was appointed provost; one  Maccarty, of the same persuasion, was made library-keeper, and the whole  foundation was changed into a catholic seminary. When bishoprics and  benefices in the gift of the crown became vacant, the king ordered the  profits to be lodged in the exchequer, and suffered the cures to be  totally neglected. The revenues were chiefly employed in the maintenance  of Romish bishops and priests, who grew so insolent under this  indulgence, that in several places they forcibly seized the protestant  churches. When complaint was made of this outrage, the king promised  to do justice to the injured, and in some places actually ordered the  churches to be restored; but the popish clergy refused to comply with  this order, alleging, that in spirituals they owed obedience to no  earthly power but the holy see, and James found himself unable to  protect his protestant subjects against a powerful body which he durst  not disoblige. Some ships appearing in the bay of Dublin, a proclamation  was issued forbidding the protestants to assemble in any place of  worship, or elsewhere, on pain of death. By a second, they were  commanded to bring in their arms on pain of being treated as rebels and  traitors. Luttrel, governor of Dublin, published an ordinance by beat  of drum, requiring the farmers to bring in their corn for his majesty's  horses within a certain day, otherwise he would order them to be hanged  before their own doors. Brigadier Sarsfield commanded all protestants  of a certain district to retire to the distance of ten miles from their  habitations on pain of death; and in order to keep up the credit of the  brass money, the same penalty was denounced, in a proclamation, against  any person who should give more than one pound eighteen shillings for a  guinea.    [Illustration: 2-013-dover.jpg DOVER]          ACTION WITH THE FRENCH FLEET.    All the revenues of Ireland, and all the schemes contrived to bolster up  the credit of the base coin, would have proved insufficient to support  the expenses of the war, had not James received occasional supplies from  the French monarch. After the return of the fleet which had conveyed  him to Ireland, Louis sent another strong squadron, commanded by Chateau  Benault, as a convoy to some transports laden with arms, ammunition, and  a large sum of money for the use of king James. Before they sailed  from Brest, king William, being informed of their destination, detached  admiral Herbert from Spithead with twelve ships of the line, one  fire-ship, and four tenders, in order to intercept the enemy. He was  driven by stress of weather into Mil-ford-haven, from whence he steered  his course to Kin-sale, on the supposition that the French fleet had  sailed from Brest, and that in all probability he should fall in with  them on the coast of Ireland. On the first day of May he discovered them  at anchor in Bantry-bay, and stood in to engage them, though they were  greatly superior to him in number. They no sooner perceived him at  day-break, than they weighed, stood out to windward, formed their line,  bore down, and began the action, which was maintained for two hours  with equal valour on both sides, though the English fleet sustained  considerable damage from the superior fire of the enemy. Herbert tacked  several times in hope of gaining the weather-gage; but the French  admiral kept his wind with uncommon skill and perseverance. At length  the English squadron stood off to sea, and maintained a running fight  till five in the afternoon, when Chateau Renault tacked about and  returned into the bay, content with the honour he had gained. The loss  of men was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19218"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol.III. (#10)"],[1,"by nature a predilection for their own country and countrymen.  This conduct, therefore, of Wilkes was as unwise as it was unjust and  impolitic. Still no danger would have occurred to himself from the  display of such bitter feelings, had he confined his malevolence to the  subjects of Great Britain. Grown bold by impunity, however, Wilkes at  length pointed his pen at the royal family, and even at the monarch  himself; and, by so doing, he raised a persecution against himself,  which has rendered him a prominent object in the annals of his country.  On the 19th of April his majesty prorogued parliament, and in the next  number of the \"North Briton,\" the celebrated 45th, Wilkes accused the  monarch of uttering a direct falsehood in his speech on that occasion.  Whether Grenville was more sensitive than his predecessor had shown  himself, or whether Bute instigated him to take notice of this attack,  in order to revenge himself upon Wilkes, is not clear, but it is certain  that on the 26th a general warrant was issued from the secretary of  state's office, signed and sealed by Lord Halifax, for the arrest of the  authors, printers, and publishers of the seditious paper, and for the  seizure of their papers. No names were specified in this warrant, and  within three days, no less than forty-nine persons were taken upon mere  suspicion. These were innocent, but on the 29th, Kearsley, the  avowed publisher, and Balfe, the printer, were taken into custody, who  confessed that Wilkes was the author of the paper. Accordingly, the  crown lawyers having been consulted, the messengers were directed to  seize Wilkes, and bring him forthwith before the secretary of state.  It was in vain that the offender asserted that they were acting upon an  illegal warrant: his papers were seized, and he was carried before Lord  Halifax. At the request of Wilkes, his friend, Lord Temple, applied to  the court of common pleas for a writ of habeas corpus, and the motion  was granted; but before it could be prepared, he was committed to the  Tower in close custody, and his friends, his counsel, and his solicitor  were denied access to him. The confinement of Wilkes, however, was  of short duration, for on the 3rd of May, a writ of habeas corpus was  directed to the constable of the Tower, by which he was brought before  the court in Westminster Hall. In that court he made a virulent speech  against the existing administration, broadly asserting that there was a  plot among its members for destroying the liberties of the nation, and  that he was selected as their victim, because they could not corrupt him  with their gold. The court took time to consider the matter, and on the  6th, Lord Chief Justice Pratt proceeded to deliver the joint opinion of  the judges. This opinion was, that though the commitment of Wilkes  and the general warrant were not in themselves illegal, as they were  justified by numerous precedents, yet he was entitled to his discharge  by virtue of his privilege as a member of parliament; that privilege  being only forfeited by members who were guilty either of treason,  felony, or a breach of the peace. Wilkes was therefore discharged, but  the attorney-general immediately instituted a prosecution against him  for the libel in question, and the king deprived him of his commission  as colonel in the Buckinghamshire militia, and dismissed his friend Lord  Temple from the lord-lieutenancy of Buckinghamshire, and struck his  name out of the roll of privy councillors. The liberation of Wilkes was  followed by a long inky war. Upon regaining the use of his pen, he wrote  a letter to the secretaries of state, in which he complained of the  treatment he had received, and accused them of holding in their hands,  goods of which his house had been robbed by their messengers. This  letter, to which government replied, was printed and distributed by  thousands, and considerable numbers of the opposition in parliament  rallied round the author of the \"North Briton,\" while the populace began  to hail him throughout the country, as the noblest patriot England had  known since the days of Algernon Sidney and Hampden. Taking advantage  of his popularity, when he found publishers averse to the hazard of  publishing his works, he established a printing-press in his own house,  where he struck off copies of the proceedings against him, which were  sold at one guinea each; a blasphemous and obscene poem entitled, \"An  Essay on Woman,\" with annotations; and the forty-five first numbers of  the \"North Briton,\" with notes and emendations. His pen was seconded by  hundreds of newspaper writers and pamphleteers who wrote on his behalf,  and John Wilkes thereby became one of the most popular men in all  England. Men, even of talents and probity, though they detested his  immoralities, associated his name with the idea of liberty, and the  proceedings against him were designated as the tyrannical efforts of  arbitrary power.    {GEORGE III. 1760-1765}          CHANGES IN THE CABINET.    Mr. George Grenville had been first brought into notice by his connexion  with Mr. Pitt. He was a man of integrity and of understanding, but he  lacked the personal influence, and the abilities which could alone  give stability to a political party. His proceedings against Wilkes,  moreover, had brought his cabinet into public contempt, and in the month  of August he was deprived of the best supporter of his administration,  by the death of Lord Egremont. The loss of this nobleman brought his  cabinet, indeed, to the verge of dissolution, and a coalition of parties  was hence deemed desirable. To this end Bute waited, at his majesty's  commands, on his stern rival, Pitt, to whom he stated the king's wish of  employing political talent and integrity without respect of persons  or parties. This was done without the knowledge of the members of  the existing cabinet, and Pitt consented to wait upon his majesty at  Buckingham House. He was received graciously, and in a conference which  lasted three hours, he expatiated on the infirmities of the peace, and  the disorders of the state; and the remedy he proposed to adopt, was the  restoration of the Whigs to office; they only, he asserted, having the  public confidence. This was on Saturday, the 27th of August, and at this  time his majesty made no objection to his proposals, and he appointed a  second interview on the following Monday. On Sunday, Pitt was closeted  with the Duke of Newcastle, in arranging the new administration, in full  confidence that the king was acquiescent. Pitt, however, did not find  his majesty so pliant on the Monday, as he expected, and he was doomed  to experience a complete disappointment of his views and hopes. The king  wished to provide for Grenville, by allotting him the profitable place  of paymaster of the forces, and to restore Lord Temple to favour, by  placing him at the head of the treasury; but although both Grenville and  Temple were Pitt's relatives, he would not consent. \"The alliance of the  great Whig interests which had supported the revolution government,\"  he said, \"was indispensable.\" The whole project, therefore, fell to the  ground. His majesty broke up the conference by observing, \"This will not  do; my honour is concerned, and I must support it.\"    Negociation with Pitt having failed, overtures were made to the Duke of  Bedford, who, it was thought, possessed sufficient influence--though he  was little less unpopular than Bute himself--to support the tottering  cabinet. His grace accepted the post of lord president of the council,  Lord Sandwich was made secretary of state, and Lord Egmont was placed at  the head of the admiralty. Grenville still retained his post, though the  Duke of Bedford gave his name to the ministry.          MEETING OF PARLIAMENT, AND FURTHER PROCEEDINGS AGAINST WILKES.    Parliament met on the 15th of November, when his majesty exhorted both  houses to cultivate the blessings of peace; to improve the commercial  acquisitions of the country; to attend to the reduction of the debts  contracted in the late war; to improve the navy; and to promote domestic  union, and discourage the licentious spirit which prevailed, to the  utter subversion of the true principles of liberty.    The allusion in his Majesty's speech to the licentious spirit prevalent  at that time in England, had reference to Wilkes and his associates.  Many men of fashion and dissipation had lived with him and upon him  recently as boon companions and partners in debauchery. Together with  him, they formed the Dilettanti Club in Palace Yard, and they also  revived the Hell-Fire Club of the days of the Duke of Wharton, at  Medmenham Abbey, Bucks, where they revelled in obscenity, and made  everything that was moral or religious, a subject of their scorn and  derision. Over the grand entrance of this abbey was inscribed, _Fays ce  que voudras_, \"Do what you like;\" and the jokes of the members of the  club consisted principally in wearing monkish dresses, and drinking wine  out of a communion cup to a pagan divinity. For the entertainment of  these men, some of whom were even more conspicuous in their profligacy  than Wilkes himself, he took a house at the court end of the town, by  which he incurred expenses his fortune could not support, and which they  were not willing to discharge. They could feast at his table, and drink  his claret; but his entertainments and his wit, which they equally  enjoyed, must be set down to his own account. Nay, one of his  companions, the new secretary of state, Lord Sandwich, one of the most  notorious of the whole club, now suddenly turned round upon him, and  accused him of leading a profligate and debauched life!    On the return of the commons to their own house, Grenville, aware of the  intention of Wilkes to make a formal complaint respecting the breach of  privilege, anticipated him by relating what had passed in the arrest  and "]]]
