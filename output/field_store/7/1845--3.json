Herodotus, an ancient Greek historian,  who lived about 450 years before Christ, relates that the ancient  Ionians made use of sheep and goat-skins in writing, many ages before  the time of Eumenes; the Persians of old, too, wrote all their records  on skins, and probably such skins were prepared and dressed for that  purpose, after a manner not unlike our parchments, though not so  artificially.      Who were the Ionians?    The inhabitants of Ionia, an ancient country in the western part of  Asia Minor.      In what manner is Parchment now prepared?    The sheep-skins are smeared over with lime[4] on the fleshy side,  folded, laid in heaps, and thus left for some days; they are next  stretched very tight on wooden frames, after having been washed,  drained, and half dried. The flesh is then carefully taken off with  iron instruments constructed on purpose, and the skin cleansed from  the remaining hairs that adhere to it. After having gone through  several operations till it is perfectly clean and smooth, it is fit  for writing upon.    [Footnote 4: See Chapter XVI., article Lime.]      What are the uses of Parchment?    Parchment is of great use for writings which are to be preserved, on  account of its great durability; the writing on it remaining perfect  for a great number of years. It is also used for the binding of books,  and various other purposes.      What is Vellum?    A finer sort of parchment than the former, but prepared in the same  manner, except that it is not passed through the lime-pit. It is made  of the skins of very young calves: there is also a still finer sort  made of the skins of sucking lambs, or kids; this is called _virgin_  parchment, and is very thin, fine, and white, and is used for  fancy-work, such as ladies' fans, &c.          CHAPTER VIII.    CAPERS, ALMONDS, ORANGES, LEMONS, CITRONS, LIMES, OLIVES, OILS,  MELONS, TAMARINDS, AND DATES.      What are Capers?    The full-grown flower-buds of the Caper Tree, a small shrub, generally  found growing out of the fissures of rocks, or among rubbish, on old  walls and ruins, giving them a gay appearance with its large white  flowers. It is a native of Italy: it is also common in the south of  France, where it is much cultivated.      How are they prepared, and for what are they used?    They are gathered, and dried in the shade; then infused in vinegar, to  which salt is added; after which they are put in barrels, to be used  as a pickle, chiefly in sauces.      What are frequently substituted for Capers?    The buds of broom pickled in the same manner, or the berries of the  nasturtium, an American annual plant, with pungent fruit.      What are Almonds?    The nut of the Almond Tree, a species of the peach, growing in most of  the southern parts of Europe; there are two kinds, the bitter and the  sweet.      What are their qualities and use?    The sweet almonds are of a soft, grateful taste, and much used by the  confectioner in numerous preparations of sweet-meats, cookery, &c.  Both sorts yield an oil, and are useful in medicine.      Of what country is the Orange a native?    It is a native of China, India, and most tropical countries; but has  long been produced in great perfection in the warmer parts of Europe  and America. Oranges are imported in immense quantities every year,  from the Azores, Spain, Portugal, Italy, &c. They are brought over in  chests and boxes, packed separately in paper to preserve them. The  oranges in common use with us are the bitter or Seville, the China or  sweet orange, and those from Florida.      Where are the Azores situated?    In the Atlantic Ocean, about 800 miles west of Portugal. These islands  are very productive in wine and fruits.      Where is Seville?    In Spain; it is an ancient and considerable city, the capital of the  province of Andalusia. The flowers of the Seville orange are highly  odoriferous, and justly esteemed one of the finest perfumes. Its fruit  is larger than the China orange, and rather bitter; the yellow rind or  peel is warm and aromatic. The juice of oranges is a grateful and  wholesome acid.         _Odoriferous_, sweet-scented, fragrant; having a brisk,       agreeable smell which may be perceived at a distance.      Who first introduced the China Orange into Europe?    The Portuguese. It is said that the very tree from which all the  European orange trees of this sort were produced, was still preserved  some years back, at the house of the Count St. Laurent, in Lisbon. In  India, those most esteemed, and which are made presents of as  rarities, are no larger than a billiard ball. The Maltese oranges are  said by some to be the finest in the world.      Who are the Maltese?    The inhabitants of Malta, an island of the Mediterranean, situated  between Africa and Sicily.      Whence are Lemons brought?    The Lemon is a native of Eastern Asia, whence it was brought to  Greece, and afterwards to Italy; from Italy it was transplanted to  Spain, Portugal, and the South of France, whence lemons are imported  in great plenty.      What is the Citron?    The fruit of the Citron Tree, resembling the lemon, but somewhat  larger, and having a finer pulp. The citron was also brought  originally from the East of Asia, but has since been produced in the  warm parts of Europe, like the orange and lemon; Genoa especially is  the greatest nursery for them. Its rind is principally brought to this  country in a candied state, and is applied by confectioners to various  purposes.      Where is Genoa?    A city of Northern Italy, on the Mediterranean, between the rivers  Bisagno and Polcevera.      What is the Lime?    The Lime is by some thought to be a species of lemon, by others not;  it is a smaller fruit, and in the West Indies is greatly preferred to  the lemon. It is cultivated in the South of Europe, the West Indies,  and the warm parts of America. The agreeable scent called Bergamot is  prepared from the rind of a small species of lime.      What are Olives?    The fruit of the Olive Tree, an evergreen, now common in the woods of  France, Spain, and Italy; but in the wild state producing a small  fruit of no value; when cultivated, however, (which it is extensively,  both for the fruit and the quantity of oil which it yields,) it forms  one of the richest productions of Southern Europe. The olive came  originally from Asia. Its use is very ancient; it is frequently spoken  of in the Bible, both as in a wild and cultivated state. The promised  land of the Israelites was \"a land of oil, olive, and honey.\" From the  time that the dove returned to Noah in the Ark with an \"olive leaf  plucked off,\" in all ages and countries, wherever this tree is known,  down to the present day, has an olive-branch been the favorite emblem  of peace.      What nation holds the olive in great repute?    This tree was a great favorite with the ancient Greeks, and scarcely  an ancient custom existed in which the olive was not in some way  associated: at their marriages and festivals, all parts of their  dwellings, especially the doors, were ornamented with them, and the  same custom prevails at the present day, both in public and private  rejoicings. It was also scarcely less a favorite with the Romans,  although it was not held in the same sacred light as amongst the  Greeks. The olive-branch has likewise been universally considered the  emblem of plenty, and as such, is found on the coins of those  countries of which it is _not_ a native. Two centuries after the  foundation of Rome, both Italy and Africa were strangers to this  useful plant; it afterwards became naturalized in those countries, and  at length arrived in Spain, France, &c. Olive trees sometimes attain a  great age.      How are the Olives eaten?    The olives while on the tree are intolerably bitter, without any of  that peculiar taste which gains them admittance at the richest tables;  to fit them for which they are pickled. Ripe olives are eaten in the  Eastern countries, especially amongst the Greeks, as an article of  food, particularly in Lent. The oil, which they yield in great  quantities, is very highly esteemed; being that chiefly used for  salads, &c., in medicine, and in various manufactures.         _Lent_, a time of fasting; the time from Ash-Wednesday to       Easter.      How is the Oil drawn from the Olive?    By presses or mills made for the purpose. The sweetest and best olive  oil comes from the South of France, from Naples, Florence, and Lucca;  quantities are also brought from Spain and the Ionian Islands.      Where is Naples?    In the South of Italy.      Where are Florence and Lucca situated?    In Italy. Florence is a very ancient, large, and celebrated city, the  capital of Italy; Lucca, formerly a republic, belongs now to the  kingdom of Italy.         _Republic_, a state in which the supreme power of government       is lodged in representatives chosen by the people, instead       of being vested in an emperor or king.      You said that the olive is an Evergreen: to what plant or shrub is the  term particularly applied?    To any shrub or tree whose leaves continue fresh and green all the  year round, winter and summer, as the laurel, pine, cedar, holly, &c.,  which do not shed their leaves in autumn as other trees.      Is oil a production confined to the Olive alone?    By no means. Oil is a fatty, inflammable matter, drawn from many  vegetable and animal bodies. The oils in common use are of three  different kinds. The first are mere _oily_ or fatty bodies, extracted  either by pressure, or by decoction: of the first kind are those of  almonds, nuts, olives, &c.; and of the other, those of different  berries, &c., which are procured by boiling the substance in water,  which causes the oil to collect on the top.         _Decoction_, act of boiling--a chemical term.      What are the second and third kinds of Oils?    The second"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16737"],[0,"International Language, Past, Present & Future (#10)"],[1,"past, and rich with its secular decay. The  leaves are the words of the people, old yet ever new, and the flowers  are the nation's poems, drawing their life from the thousand tiny roots  that twist and twine unseen about the lives and struggles of bygone  men. You are calling to us to come forth from the cool seclusion of  these trees' shade, to leave their delights and toil in the glare of the  world at raising a mushroom growth on a dull, featureless plain that  reaches everywhither. Modern Macbeths, sophisticated by your modernity  and adding perverted instinct to crime, you are murdering not sleep,  but dreams--dreams that haunt about the mouldering lodges of the past,  and soften the contact with reality by lending their own colouring  atmosphere. You are hammering the last nail into the coffin of the old  leisurely past, the past that raised the cathedrals, to which taste and  feeling were of supreme moment, and when man put something of himself  into his every work.\"    The man must be indeed dull of soul who cannot join in a dirge for the  beauty of the vanishing past. Turn where we may now, we find the same  railways, the same trams, music-halls, coats and trousers. The mad rush  of modernity with its levelling tendency really is killing off what is  quaint, out of the way, and racy of the soil. But why visit the sins  of modernity upon an international language? The last sentence of the  indictment itself suggests the line of defence. \"You are hammering the  last nail into the coffin of the old, leisurely past....\"    Quite so, you _are_.    The universal ability to use an auxiliary language on occasion rounds  off and completes the levelling process. But the old leisurely past  will not be any the less dead, or any the less effectually buried, if  one nail is not driven home in the coffin. The slayer is modernity at  large, made up of science, steam, democracy, universal education, and  many other things--but especially universal education. And the verdict  can be, at the most, justifiable, or at any rate inevitable, pasticide.  You cannot eat your cake and have it; you cannot kill off all the bad  things and keep all the good ones. With sterilization goes purification,  pasticide may be accompanied by pasteurization. At any rate, \"the old  order changeth,\" and you've got to let it change.    The whole history of the \"progress\" of the world, meaning often material  progress, is eloquent of the lesson that it is vain to set artificial  limits to advancing invention. The substitution of cheap mechanical  processes of manufacture for hand-work involved untold misery to many,  and incidentally led to the partial disappearance of a type of character  which the world could ill afford to lose, and which we would give much  to be able to bring back. The old semi-artist-craftsman, with hand and  eye really trained up to something like their highest level of capacity,  with knowledge not wide, but deep, and all gained from experience, and  not from books or technical education--this type of character is a loss.  Many, with the gravest reason, are dissatisfied with the type which has  already largely replaced it, and which will replace it for good or evil,  but ever more swiftly and surely. But no well-judging person proposes  on that account to forgo the material advantages conferred upon mankind  by the invention of machinery. If the world rejects, on sentimental  grounds, the labour-saving invention of international language, it will  be flying in the face of economic history, and it will not appreciably  retard the disappearance of the picturesque.    There is another type of argument which may also be classed as  aesthetic, but which differs somewhat from the one just discussed. It  emanates chiefly from literary men and scholars, and may be presented as  follows:    \"Language is precious, and worthy of study, inasmuch as it enshrines  the imperishable monuments of the thought and genius of the race on  whose lips it was born. The study of the words and forms in which a  nation clothed its thoughts throws many a ray of light on phases of the  evolution of the race itself, which would otherwise have remained dark.  The history of a language and literature is in some measure an epitome  of the history of a people. We miss all these points of interest in your  artificial language, and we shall, therefore, refuse to study it, and  hereby commit it to the devil.\"    This is a particularly humiliating type of answer to receive, because  it implies that one is an ass. In truth the man who should invent an  artificial language and invite the world to study it for itself would  be a fool, and a very swell-headed fool at that. It seems in vain to  point this out to persons who use the above argument; or to explain to  them that they would be aided in their study of languages that do repay  study by the introduction of an easy international language, because  many commentaries, etc., would become accessible to them, which are not  so now, or only at the expense of deciphering some difficult language in  which the commentary is written, the commentary itself being in no sense  literature, and its form a matter of complete indifference.    Back comes the old answer in one form or another, every variation  tainted with the heresy that the language is to be studied as a language  for itself.    Perhaps the least tedious way of giving an idea of this kind of  opposition, and the way in which it may be met, is to give some extracts  from a scholar's letter, and the writer's answer. The letter is fairly  typical.          \"MY DEAR ----,             \"Many thanks for your long letter on Esperanto....     According to the books, Esperanto can be learnt quickly by any     one. This means that they will forget it quite as rapidly; for     what is easily acquired is soon forgotten.... In my humble     opinion, an Englishman who knows French and German would do     much better to devote any extra time at his disposal to the     study of his own language, which, I repeat, is one of the most     delicate mediums of communication now in existence. It has     taken centuries to construct, while Esperanto was apparently     created in a few hours. One is God's handiwork, and the other     a man's toy. Personally, any living language interests me more     than Esperanto. I am sorry I am such a heretic, but I fear my     love for the English language carries me away....                                                             \"Yours ever,                                                                 \"----.\"    The points that rankle are artificiality and lack of a history.                                    _Reply_          \"MY DEAR ----,             \"I really can't put it any more plainly, so I must just repeat     it: we are not trying to introduce a language that has any interest     for anybody in itself. An international language is a labour-saving     device. The question is, Is it an efficient one? If so, it must     surely be adopted. The world wants to be saved labour. It never pays     permanently to do things a longer way, if the shorter one produces     equally good results. No one has yet proved, or, in my opinion,     advanced any decent argument tending to show, that the results     produced by a universal language will not be just as good _for many     purposes_[1] as those produced by national languages. That the results     are more economically produced surely does not admit of doubt.          [1]And those very important ones, relatively to man's whole field        of activity.          'Personally, any living language interests me more than     Esperanto.' Of course it does. So it does me, and most sensible     people. But what the digamma does it matter to Esperanto whether we     are interested in it or not? It is not there to interest us. The     question is, Does it, or not, save us or others unprofitable labour     on a large scale? Neither you nor most sane persons are probably     particularly interested in shorthand or Morse codes or any signalling     systems. Yet they bear up.          \"Do try to see that we think there is a certain felt want, amongst     countless numbers of persons, which is much more efficiently and     economically met by a neutral, easy, international language,     than by any national one. That is the position you have got to     controvert, if you are seriously to weaken the argument in favour of     an international language. If you say that it is not a want felt by     many people, I can only say, at the risk of being dogmatic, that you     are wrong. I happen to know that it is.[1] The question then is, Is     there an easy way of meeting that want? And the equally certain and     well-grounded answer is, There is....          [1]I have before me a list of 119 societies, representing many        different lines of work and play and many nations, who had already        in 1903 given in their adhesion to a scheme for an international        language. Technical terms alone (in all departments of study) want        standardizing, and an international language affords the best        means. The number of societies is now (1907) over 270.          \"As to your argument that what is easy is more easily     forgotten--it is true. But I think you must see that, neither in     practice nor in principle, does it or should it make for choosing the     harder way of arriving at a given result. Chance the forgetting, if     necessary re-learning as required, and use the time and effort saved     for some more remunerative purpose.          \"'One is God's handiwork, the other a man's toy.' I should have     said the first was man's lip-work, but I see what you mean. It is     God working through his creature's natural development. The same     is equally true of all man's 'toys.' Man moulded his language in     pursuance of his ends under God. Under the same guidance he moulded     the "]]]
