In the Babi Dispensation,  however, it was destined to be established in clear and unequivocal  language, though not embodied in a separate document. Unlike the Prophets  gone before Him, Whose Covenants were shrouded in mystery, unlike  Baha'u'llah, Whose clearly defined Covenant was incorporated in a  specially written Testament, and designated by Him as \"the Book of My  Covenant,\" the Bab chose to intersperse His Book of Laws, the Persian  Bayan, with unnumbered passages, some designedly obscure, mostly  indubitably clear and conclusive, in which He fixes the date of the  promised Revelation, extols its virtues, asserts its pre-eminent  character, assigns to it unlimited powers and prerogatives, and tears down  every barrier that might be an obstacle to its recognition. \"He, verily,\"  Baha'u'llah, referring to the Bab in His Kitab-i-Badi', has stated, \"hath  not fallen short of His duty to exhort the people of the Bayan and to  deliver unto them His Message. In no age or dispensation hath any  Manifestation made mention, in such detail and in such explicit language,  of the Manifestation destined to succeed Him.\"    Some of His disciples the Bab assiduously prepared to expect the imminent  Revelation. Others He orally assured would live to see its day. To Mulla  Baqir, one of the Letters of the Living, He actually prophesied, in a  Tablet addressed to him, that he would meet the Promised One face to face.  To Sayyah, another disciple, He gave verbally a similar assurance. Mulla  Husayn He directed to Tihran, assuring him that in that city was enshrined  a Mystery Whose light neither Hijaz nor _Sh_iraz could rival. Quddus, on  the eve of his final separation from Him, was promised that he would  attain the presence of the One Who was the sole Object of their adoration  and love. To _Sh_ay_kh_ Hasan-i-Zunuzi He declared while in Mah-Ku that he  would behold in Karbila the countenance of the promised Husayn. On Dayyan  He conferred the title of \"the third Letter to believe in Him Whom God  shall make manifest,\" while to Azim He divulged, in the  Kitab-i-Panj-_Sh_a'n, the name, and announced the approaching advent, of  Him Who was to consummate His own Revelation.    A successor or vicegerent the Bab never named, an interpreter of His  teachings He refrained from appointing. So transparently clear were His  references to the Promised One, so brief was to be the duration of His own  Dispensation, that neither the one nor the other was deemed necessary. All  He did was, according to the testimony of 'Abdu'l-Baha in \"A Traveller's  Narrative,\" to nominate, on the advice of Baha'u'llah and of another  disciple, Mirza Yahya, who would act solely as a figure-head pending the  manifestation of the Promised One, thus enabling Baha'u'llah to promote,  in relative security, the Cause so dear to His heart.    \"The Bayan,\" the Bab in that Book, referring to the Promised One, affirms,  \"is, from beginning to end, the repository of all of His attributes, and  the treasury of both His fire and His light.\" \"If thou attainest unto His  Revelation,\" He, in another connection declares, \"and obeyest Him, thou  wilt have revealed the fruit of the Bayan; if not, thou art unworthy of  mention before God.\" \"O people of the Bayan!\" He, in that same Book, thus  warns the entire company of His followers, \"act not as the people of the  Qur'an have acted, for if ye do so, the fruits of your night will come to  naught.\" \"Suffer not the Bayan,\" is His emphatic injunction, \"and all that  hath been revealed therein to withhold you from that Essence of Being and  Lord of the visible and invisible.\" \"Beware, beware,\" is His significant  warning addressed to Vahid, \"lest in the days of His Revelation the Vahid  of the Bayan (eighteen Letters of the Living and the Bab) shut thee out as  by a veil from Him, inasmuch as this Vahid is but a creature in His  sight.\" And again: \"O congregation of the Bayan, and all who are therein!  Recognize ye the limits imposed upon you, for such a One as the Point of  the Bayan Himself hath believed in Him Whom God shall make manifest before  all things were created. Therein, verily, do I glory before all who are in  the kingdom of heaven and earth.\"    \"In the year nine,\" He, referring to the date of the advent of the  promised Revelation, has explicitly written, \"ye shall attain unto all  good.\" \"In the year nine, ye will attain unto the presence of God.\" And  again: \"After Hin (68) a Cause shall be given unto you which ye shall come  to know.\" \"Ere nine will have elapsed from the inception of this Cause,\"  He more particularly has stated, \"the realities of the created things will  not be made manifest. All that thou hast as yet seen is but the stage from  the moist germ until We clothed it with flesh. Be patient, until thou  beholdest a new creation. Say: 'Blessed, therefore, be God, the most  excellent of Makers!'\" \"Wait thou,\" is His statement to Azim, \"until nine  will have elapsed from the time of the Bayan. Then exclaim: 'Blessed,  therefore, be God, the most excellent of Makers!'\" \"Be attentive,\" He,  referring in a remarkable passage to the year nineteen, has admonished,  \"from the inception of the Revelation till the number of Vahid (19).\" \"The  Lord of the Day of Reckoning,\" He, even more explicitly, has stated, \"will  be manifested at the end of Vahid (19) and the beginning of eighty (1280  A.H.).\" \"Were He to appear this very moment,\" He, in His eagerness to  insure that the proximity of the promised Revelation should not withhold  men from the Promised One, has revealed, \"I would be the first to adore  Him, and the first to bow down before Him.\"    \"I have written down in My mention of Him,\" He thus extols the Author of  the anticipated Revelation, \"these gem-like words: 'No allusion of Mine  can allude unto Him, neither anything mentioned in the Bayan.'\" \"I,  Myself, am but the first servant to believe in Him and in His signs....\"  \"The year-old germ,\" He significantly affirms, \"that holdeth within itself  the potentialities of the Revelation that is to come is endowed with a  potency superior to the combined forces of the whole of the Bayan.\" And  again: \"The whole of the Bayan is only a leaf amongst the leaves of His  Paradise.\" \"Better is it for thee,\" He similarly asserts, \"to recite but  one of the verses of Him Whom God shall make manifest than to set down the  whole of the Bayan, for on that Day that one verse can save thee, whereas  the entire Bayan cannot save thee.\" \"Today the Bayan is in the stage of  seed; at the beginning of the manifestation of Him Whom God shall make  manifest its ultimate perfection will become apparent.\" \"The Bayan  deriveth all its glory from Him Whom God shall make manifest.\" \"All that  hath been revealed in the Bayan is but a ring upon My hand, and I Myself  am, verily, but a ring upon the hand of Him Whom God shall make  manifest... He turneth it as He pleaseth, for whatsoever He pleaseth, and  through whatsoever He pleaseth. He, verily, is the Help in Peril, the Most  High.\" \"Certitude itself,\" He, in reply to Vahid and to one of the Letters  of the Living who had inquired regarding the promised One, had declared,  \"is ashamed to be called upon to certify His truth ... and Testimony  itself is ashamed to testify unto Him.\" Addressing this same Vahid, He  moreover had stated: \"Were I to be assured that in the day of His  manifestation thou wilt deny Him, I would unhesitatingly disown thee...  If, on the other hand, I be told that a Christian, who beareth no  allegiance to My Faith, will believe in Him, the same will I regard as the  apple of My eye.\"    And finally is this, His moving invocation to God: \"Bear Thou witness  that, through this Book, I have covenanted with all created things  concerning the mission of Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest, ere the  covenant concerning My own mission had been established. Sufficient  witness art Thou and they that have believed in Thy signs.\" \"I, verily,  have not fallen short of My duty to admonish that people,\" is yet another  testimony from His pen, \"...If on the day of His Revelation all that are  on earth bear Him allegiance, Mine inmost being will rejoice, inasmuch as  all will have attained the summit of their existence.... If not, My soul  will be saddened. I truly have nurtured all things for this purpose. How,  then, can any one be veiled from Him?\"    The last three and most eventful years of the Bab's ministry had, as we  have observed in the preceding pages, witnessed not only the formal and  public declaration of His mission, but also an unprecedented effusion of  His inspired writings, including both the revelation of the fundamental  laws of His Dispensation and also the establishment of that Lesser  Covenant which was to safeguard the unity of His followers and pave the  way for the advent of an incomparably mightier Revelation. It was during  this same period, in the early days of His incarceration in the fortress  of _Ch_ihriq, that the independence of the new-born Faith was openly  recognized and asserted by His disciples. The laws underlying the new  Dispensation had been revealed by its Author in a prison-fortress in the  mountains of A_dh_irbayjan, while the Dispensation itself was now to be  inaugurated in a plain on the border of Mazindaran, at a conference of His  assembled followers.    Baha'u'llah, maintaining through continual correspondence close contact  with the Bab, and Himself the directing force behind the manifold  activities of His struggling fellow-disciples, unobtrusively yet  effectually presided over that conference, and guided and controlled its  proceedings. Quddus, regarded as the exponent of the conservative element  within it, affected, in pursuance of a pre-conceived plan designed to  mitigate the alarm and consternation which such a conference was sure to  arouse, to oppose the seemingly extremist"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19279"],[0,"Memorials of the Faithful (#10)"],[1,"appeared and--urged on by those familiars-turned-strangers--made plans to  tear out the Holy Tree by the roots; when they determined to cast me into  the depths of the sea or banish me to the Fezzan, and this was their  settled purpose; and when the commission accordingly tried their utmost to  get hold of some document or other, they failed. In the thick of all that  turmoil, with all the pressures and restraints, and the foul attacks of  those persons who were pitiless as Yazid,(33) still the mail went through.    For many long years, Siyyid Man_sh_adi befittingly performed this service  in Port Sa'id. The friends were uniformly pleased with him. In that city  he earned the gratitude of travelers, placed those who had emigrated in  his debt, brought joy to the local believers. Then the heavy heat of Egypt  proved too much for him; he took to his bed, and in a raging fever, cast  off the robe of life. He abandoned Port Sa'id for the Kingdom of Heaven,  and rose up to the mansions of the Lord.    Siyyid Man_sh_adi was the essence of virtue and intellect. His qualities  and attainments were such as to amaze the most accomplished minds. He had  no thought except of God, no hope but to win the good pleasure of God. He  was the embodiment of \"Keep all my words of prayer and praise confined to  one refrain; make all my life but servitude to Thee.\"    May God cool his feverish pain with the grace of reunion in the Kingdom,  and heal his sickness with the balm of nearness to Him in the Realm of the  All-Beauteous. Upon him be the glory of God the Most Glorious.            MUHAMMAD-'ALI SABBAQ OF YAZD      Early in youth, Muhammad-'Ali Sabbaq became a believer while in 'Iraq. He  tore away hindering veils and doubts, escaped from his delusions and  hastened to the welcoming shelter of the Lord of Lords. A man to outward  seeming without education, for he could neither read nor write, he was of  sharp intelligence and a trustworthy friend. Through one of the believers,  he was brought into the presence of Baha'u'llah, and was soon widely known  to the public as a disciple. He found himself a corner to live in, close  beside the house of the Blessed Beauty, and mornings and evenings would  enter the presence of Baha'u'llah. For a time he was supremely happy.    When Baha'u'llah and His retinue left Ba_gh_dad for Constantinople, Aqa  Muhammad-'Ali was of that company, and fevered with the love of God. We  reached Constantinople; and since the Government obliged us to settle in  Adrianople we left Muhammad-'Ali in the Turkish capital to assist the  believers as they came and went through that city. We then went on to  Adrianople. This man remained alone and he suffered intense distress for  he had no friend nor companion nor anyone to care for him.    After two years of this he came on to Adrianople, seeking a haven in the  loving-kindness of Baha'u'llah. He went to work as a peddler, and when the  great rebellion(34) began and the oppressors drove the friends to the  extreme of adversity, he too was among the prisoners and was exiled with  us to the fortress at Akka.    He spent a considerable time in the Most Great Prison, after which  Baha'u'llah desired him to leave for Sidon, where he engaged in trade.  Sometimes he would return and be received by Baha'u'llah, but otherwise he  stayed in Sidon. He lived respected and trusted, a credit to all. When the  Supreme Affliction came upon us, he returned to Akka and passed the  remainder of his days near the Holy Tomb.    The friends, one and all, were pleased with him, and he was cherished at  the Holy Threshold; in this state he soared to abiding glory, leaving his  kin to mourn. He was a kind man, an excellent one: content with God's will  for him, thankful, a man of dignity, long-suffering. Upon him be the glory  of the All-Glorious. May God send down, upon his scented tomb in Akka,  tiers of celestial light.            'ABDU'L-GHAFFAR OF ISFAHAN      Another of those who left their homeland to become our neighbors and  fellow prisoners was 'Abdu'l-_Gh_affar of Isfahan. He was a highly  perceptive individual who, on commercial business, had traveled about Asia  Minor for many years. He made a journey to 'Iraq, where Aqa Muhammad-'Ali  of Sad (Isfahan) brought him into the shelter of the Faith. He soon ripped  off the bandage of illusions that had blinded his eyes before, and he rose  up, winging to salvation in the Heaven of Divine love. With him, the veil  had been thin, almost transparent, and that is why, as the first word was  imparted, he was immediately released from the world of idle imaginings  and attached himself to the One Who is clear to see.    On the journey from 'Iraq to the Great City, Constantinople,  'Abdu'l-_Gh_affar was a close and agreeable companion. He served as  interpreter for the entire company, for he spoke excellent Turkish, a  language in which none of the friends was proficient. The journey came  peacefully to an end and then, in the Great City, he continued on, as a  companion and friend. The same was true in Adrianople and also when, as  one of the prisoners, he accompanied us to the city of Haifa.    Here, the oppressors determined to send him to Cyprus. He was terrified  and shouted for help, for he longed to be with us in the Most Great  Prison.(35) When they held him back by force, from high up on the ship he  threw himself into the sea. This had no effect whatever on the brutal  officers. After dragging him from the water they held him prisoner on the  ship, cruelly restraining him, and carrying him away by force to Cyprus.  He was jailed in Famagusta, but one way or another managed to escape and  hastened to Akka. Here, protecting himself from the malevolence of our  oppressors, he changed his name to 'Abdu'llah. Sheltered within the  loving-kindness of Baha'u'llah, he passed his days at ease, and happy.    But when the world's great Light had set, to shine on forever from the  All-Luminous Horizon, 'Abdu'l-_Gh_affar was beside himself and a prey to  anguish. He no longer had a home. He left for Damascus and spent some time  there, pent up in his sorrow, mourning by day and night. He grew weaker  and weaker. We despatched Haji Abbas there, to nurse him and give him  treatment and care, and send back word of him every day. But  'Abdu'l-_Gh_affar would do nothing but talk, unceasingly, at every hour,  with his nurse, and tell how he longed to go his way, into the mysterious  country beyond. And at the end, far from home, exiled from his Love, he  set out for the Holy Threshold of Baha'u'llah.    He was truly a man long-suffering, and mild; a man of good character, good  acts, and goodly words. Greetings and praise be unto him, and the glory of  the All-Glorious. His sweet-scented tomb is in Damascus.            'ALI NAJAF-ABADI      Also among the emigrants and near neighbors was Aqa 'Ali Najaf-Abadi. When  this spiritual young man first listened to the call of God he set his lips  to the holy cup and beheld the glory of the Speaker on the Mount. And  when, by grace of the light, he had attained positive knowledge, he  journeyed to the Most Great Prison, where he witnessed the substance of  knowledge itself, and arrived at the high station of indubitable truth.    For a long time he remained in and about the sacred city; he became the  proverbial Habibu'llah the Merchant, and spent his days relying upon God,  in supplication and prayer. He was a man meek, quiet, uncomplaining,  steadfast; in all things pleasing, worthy of praise. He won the approval  of all the friends and was accepted and welcome at the Holy Threshold.  During his latter days, when he felt that a happy end was in store for  him, he again presented himself at the holy city of the Most Great Prison.  Upon arrival he fell ill, weakened, passed his hours in supplicating God.  The breath of life ceased within him, the gates of flight to the supreme  Kingdom were flung wide, he turned his eyes away from this world of dust  and went onward to the Holy Place.    'Ali Najaf-Abadi was tender and sensitive of heart, at all times mindful  of God and remembering Him, and toward the close of his life detached,  without stain, free from the contagion of this world. Sweetly, he gave up  his corner of the earth, and pitched his tent in the land beyond. May God  send upon him the pure savors of forgiveness, brighten his eyes with  beholding the Divine Beauty in the Kingdom of Splendors, and refresh his  spirit with the musk-scented winds that blow from the Abha Realm. Unto him  be salutation and praise. His sweet and holy dust lies in Akka. Ma_sh_hadi  Husayn and Ma_sh_hadi Muhammad-i-A_dh_irbayjani    Ma_sh_hadi Husayn and Ma_sh_hadi Muhammad were both from the province of  A_dh_irbayjan. They were pure souls who took the great step in their own  country: they freed themselves from friend and stranger alike, escaped  from the superstitions that had blinded them before, strengthened their  resolve, and bowed themselves down before the grace of God, the Lord of  Life. They were blessed souls, loyal, unsullied in faith; evanescent,  submissive, poor, content with the will of God, in love with His guiding  Light, rejoicing over the great message. They left their province and  traveled to Adrianople. Here beside the holy city they lived for quite a  time in the village of Qumruq-Kilisa. By day, they supplicated God and  communed with Him; by night, they wept, bemoaning the plight of Him Whom  the world hath wronged.    When the exile to Akka was under way, they were not present in the city  and thus were not arrested. Heavy of heart, they continued on in that  area, shedding their tears. Once they had obtained a definite report from  Akka, they left Rumelia and came here: two excellent souls, loyal bondsmen  of the Blessed Beauty. It is impossible to tell how translucent they were  of heart, how firm in faith.    They lived outside Akka in Ba_gh_-i-Firdaws, worked as farmers, and"]]]
