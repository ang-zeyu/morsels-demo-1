[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19271"],[0,"Dawn of a New Day (#10)"],[1," of Baha'u'llah & the New Era into Burmese    Shoghi Effendi wishes me to write you this short note to enclose a check  for thirty pounds.    This is his contribution towards the publication of the translation of Dr.  Esslemont's book into Burmese which has been made by Sayed Mustafa Rumi.  Please inform the latter about its receipt because he has asked the  Guardian to send this contribution through you and he may be anxious to  receive this news.    March 1, 1933    He was very glad to learn that the Burmese translation has been completed  and that it is now in the hands of the printers.    Now the translation into Burmese and Gujrati have been completed and the  latter is even printed and circulated the Guardian feels we should  concentrate upon the Hindi and Urdu translations. We should not permit so  much unnecessary delay. If one way seems closed or difficult we could try  another and strive for the speedy completion of those books. The more we  see the crying need of the world for the spiritual teachings of our Faith  the more restless we should feel in giving out the Message and improving  the means of diffusing the precepts of the Cause.    In his moments of prayers at the Blessed Shrines the Guardian will think  of you and ask God to guide and sustain your efforts. He knows fully how  difficult it is these days to bring a task to a speedy and successful  conclusion, but to a person who is determined and lays his trust in God  nothing is impossible.          Teaching Among the Masses in India      [From the Guardian:]    I rejoice to hear of the steps that are being taken for the printing of  the Burmese edition of the 'New Era' but deplore the delay in the  translation of the book into Hindi and Urdu. The Gujrati copies have  already been placed in the library of the Mansion at Bahji, and I long  with all my heart to witness these remaining translations in their final  and printed form, side by side with the nineteen printed versions which  have already been collected and distributed throughout the world. I would  urge you to concentrate your energy on this important and essential  preliminary to an intensive campaign of teaching among the masses in  India. Persevere and rest assured that my prayers will continue to be  offered on your behalf.    March 24, 1933    He was very glad to receive the Gujrati translation of Dr. Esslemont's  book, and he hopes that through your efforts the Hindi and Urdu  translation of it will soon be ready for publication. As you may know,  this work has already been translated into 19 different languages and its  rendering into 11 others will be soon completed. This is really  encouraging.    [From the Guardian:]    I long to hear from you and of the progress of your devoted and incessant  activities in the service of our beloved Faith. I am also eager to receive  the good news of the completion of the translation and early publication  of the Urdu and Hindi versions of the 'New Era'. The utmost effort should  be exerted to ensure the consummation of this work which, I feel, must  precede an intensive teaching campaign among the masses in India. I am  arranging for Mrs. Kehler to visit southern Persia this autumn after which  she is expecting to visit India, this winter.    June 8, 1933          Baha'i Magazine      He was particularly glad to learn that some of our Indian friends have  encouraged you to start a fortnightly paper on the Cause. The idea is,  undoubtedly, most genuine and meets with our Guardian's wholehearted  approval. He wishes you, however, not to act hurriedly, to take all the  necessary steps which can insure its safety and development. Such projects  are not so easy to carry out, especially in these days when the economic  crisis is getting so acute. At any rate, if you find that your financial  conditions allow you to undertake such an important work, you should  persevere in your efforts and try to make your paper an indispensable  adjunct to the teaching activities of the friends.    The Guardian hopes that you will be more successful in this, your second  attempt. The unexpected death of the 'Baha'i Weekly', he feels, had badly  affected the prestige of the Cause. It is hoped that your new fortnightly  paper will enable all to appreciate more adequately the divine potency  with which it is endowed.    Mrs. Keith Ransom-Kehler, who has been doing such a fine work in Persia,  is planning to leave for India at the beginning of winter. Her presence  among you will be certainly appreciated. She is such a wonderful soul, so  devoted, so active and so capable. The Guardian hopes that you will make  the utmost use of her stay in India.    [From the Guardian:]    Your unswerving loyalty and inflexible resolve to carry on the work you  have so nobly initiated are indeed worthy of the highest praise. I will  pray for your success and the steady and uninterrupted progress of your  activities whenever I lay my head on the sacred Threshold and will  supplicate for you all the strength and guidance you need for the  prosecution of your task. The friends in India and Burma should bestir  themselves and, under the guidance and by the aid of the National Assembly  prepare the way for the forthcoming visit of our able and brilliant  international teacher Mrs. Kehler. May the Lord sustain and guide them in  their endeavours and reward them for their acts of self-sacrifice in His  Path.    June 13, 1933          Publication of Baha'u'llah & the New Era      As regards the Urdu translation of Dr. Esslemont's book, Shoghi Effendi  wishes you to make all the necessary effort to have it published as soon  as possible. He is fully aware of the difficulties that have caused an  inevitable delay in the publication of this highly important work, but he  feels certain that, through your perseverance and through the kind and  invaluable assistance of Prof. Pritam Singh ... the translation will be  soon completed and be ready for publication.    The Guardian would like you also to take all the necessary steps for the  Hindi translation of this same work. It is hoped that no delay will be  caused this time.    [From the Guardian:]    The Serbian and Hungarian versions of \"The New Era\" have been recently  published through the efforts of Martha Root. The Rumanian translation has  been undertaken and the Greek version will soon be started. I long to see  the Urdu, the Hindi and the Burmese versions in print and circulated among  the masses of the Indian people. Persevere and redouble in your efforts.    August 6, 1933    Shoghi Effendi was deeply gratified to learn of the important steps you  have taken for the translation and publication of Dr. Esslemont's book  into Hindi. He has greatly appreciated the assistance of Dr. Kaushal  Kishore, and sincerely trusts that through your combined efforts the work  will be soon completed and will be ready for circulation. In a recent  communication to the Guardian, our devoted friend Siyyid, Mustafa Rumi,  has given the news of the publication of this same book in Burmese. It is  hoped that this will serve to encourage our Indian believers to follow his  example.    [From the Guardian:]    I am so pleased and grateful to you for your incessant efforts in  connexion with the translation and publication of the 'New Era', and I am  deeply gratified to learn of the progress already achieved. I will  continue to pray for the speedy realization of your hopes, plans and  wishes in the service of this glorious Faith.    September 10, 1933          Passing Away of Brilliant Teacher--Mrs. Kehler      The sudden passing of that wholly-consecrated and brilliant teacher and  international promoter of the Cause Mrs. Keith Ransom-Kehler, has plunged  Shoghi Effendi into deepest sorrow for in her he has lost not only a  valuable co-worker but a dear friend. After more than a year of intense  teaching work in Persia, where she was entrusted by the Guardian with the  mission of acquainting our Persian brethren with the basic principles of  the Administration and of liberating them from the appalling persecutions  to which they have been lately subjected, our precious Keith left this  world under so tragic circumstances that she was given by the Guardian the  title of the first western martyr on Persian soil, and was raised by him  to the station of one of the Hands of the Cause. Her deep-rooted and  unshakable faith, her unqualified loyalty to the Cause of the  Administration and her profound knowledge of the Teachings, all these  fully entitle her to occupy such an eminent rank among the faithful.    Our Indian friends, who have been so appreciative of her last visit to  them, must have been particularly affected by such an irretrievable loss.  May the memory of her services inspire them to follow in her footsteps,  and to tread the path of service as firmly and as successfully as she did.          Twentyfive Printed Versions of Baha'u'llah & the New Era      [From the Guardian:]    I am so eager to receive the news of the completion and publication of the  Hindi and Urdu versions of the \"New Era\", and it will please and encourage  you to know that we have already twentyfive different printed versions of  this precious book translated into Eastern and Western tongues.    November 26, 1933          Registration of Bombay Assembly      The Guardian was greatly pleased to read the minutes of the last meeting  of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of India and Burma and  he wishes me to express his genuine appreciation of the important steps  which your Assembly has taken for the further extension and consolidation  of the administrative institutions of the Faith in that country. He would  be very grateful if you send him regularly the minutes of the meetings of  the N.S.A. and he would be only too glad to offer any suggestion or advice  which may help its members to better discharge their manifold and delicate  functions. He sincerely hopes that "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19274"],[0,"Letters from the Guardian to Australia and New Zealand (#10)"],[1,"are with them all, and his loving gratitude goes out to you  who lead and co-ordinate their activities.    With warm Baha'i greetings    Yours in the service of the beloved Faith,  R. Rabbani.    [From the Guardian:]    Dearly-beloved co-workers:    In these days when perils are increasingly threatening that far-off  continent, the most distant outpost of our beloved Faith, my thoughts turn  with deepening anxiety, solicitude, and love to those who are so valiantly  holding aloft the banner of the Cause of Baha'u'llah. I appeal to every  one of them, and particularly to the members of the assemblies who  safeguard their interests, not to allow any disturbance, suffering, or  anxiety to dim the splendour of their faith, to deflect them from their  high purpose, to cause any division in their ranks, to interfere with the  steady consolidation and expansion of their activities and institutions. I  will specially pray that the work they have magnificently initiated, and  so marvellously and soundly developed may suffer no setback, but rather  continue to develop and yield its destined fruit. Persevere and rest  assured.    Your true and grateful brother,  Shoghi.            LETTER OF FEB. 23RD, 1942      Haifa, Feb. 23rd, 1942.    Dear Baha'i Sister:    Your letter, with enclosures, of Nov. 8th reached the Guardian safely, and  he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.    His thoughts and prayers are very often with the Australian Baha'is in  these difficult and dangerous times. They are now facing a much more acute  situation than hitherto. But whatever of trial and affliction the  immediate future may hold for them, we know that the destiny of mankind is  in the firm grasp of Baha'u'llah, and that He will guide it to its  ultimate and highest goal. This assurance is more precious than life  itself, it is our anchor in every difficulty and trial.    The Guardian was very happy to know that the work in Brisbane is  progressing, and that the Cause is more and more coming before the public  and reaching the attention of prominent people.    He feels the believers must continue to do their utmost to acquaint their  fellow-citizens with the teachings, that they may at least hear of the  Baha'i ideals, whether they are ready to accept them yet or not.    The recent meeting of the National Spiritual Assembly must have been of  great benefit to all the members and to the work of the Cause in general.  Their responsibility in these days is greater than ever, but Shoghi  Effendi feels sure they will be guided and protected and continue to  spread and safe-guard the Faith in those distant lands.    He assures you, and all the N.S.A. members, of his deep appreciation for  your untiring services, and his loving and ardent prayers. He will beseech  for you all blessings and protection in the Holy Shrines.    With loving Baha'i greetings,    Yours in His service,  R. Rabbani.    [From the Guardian:]    Dear and valued co-workers:    As the diffulties and problems facing the valiant and high-minded  supporters and upholders of the Faith in Australia and New Zealand  multiply, my thoughts and prayers turn increasingly towards them, in  loving admiration for the work they have performed and will continue to  perform in the future. Adversity, in whatever form, will, I feel  confident, now that they have laid an unassailable basis for the Faith, in  their hearts and through their institutions, serve to heighten the ardour  of their devotion, and reinforce the foundation of their spiritual  community life. They should persevere, redouble their efforts, close their  ranks, intensify their individual as well as collective teaching  activities, and defend even more tenaciously and courageously the tenets,  claims and institutions of their Faith. Measureless blessings will crown  their exertions if they persevere, and face heroically the challenge, the  problems, and the perplexities of the present hour.    Your true brother,  Shoghi.            LETTER OF APRIL 18TH, 1942      Haifa, April 18th, 1942.    Dear Baha'i Sister:    The Guardian has instructed me to answer your two letters of Jan. 15th and  24th, and to acknowledge the receipt of the enclosed letter of Mrs. Dunn.    He was delighted to learn that the New Zealand members were able to make  the trip to Australia, and that such a highly satisfactory N.S.A. meeting  was held, in such a spirit of love and harmony. No doubt this experience  will prove of great value, not only to the National Assembly, but also to  the work of the Cause in the days to come.    Regarding the various matters you refer to in your letters: The Guardian  highly approves of the very kind and helpful arrangements made by Dr.  Bolton, by which his property at Yerrinbool will pass to the Faith at his  death and be used, according to the requirements of a future date, as  dictated by the discretion of the N.S.A. It is better that the believers,  subject to the judgements of the N.S.A., be left free to select any spot  that will prove most convenient for the majority for their summer-schools.    Regarding the Summer-Schools in general; although there is no objection to  their being under the direct management of a special Committee elected for  that purpose, they must be generally supervised by the N.S.A. in respect  to policy, etc. In other words they must be considered as a national and  not a purely local institution.    For purposes of convenience the N.S.A. may appoint as members of such  Committees, those who are situated near the Summer-Schools and are able to  pay direct attention to their affairs.    Concerning individual Baha'is' letters to the Guardian and his replies;  the friends are free to write to the Guardian when they feel the urge to  do so. However, for the believers to suppose that the Guardian's letters  to them, however full of loving encouragement they may be, give them any  special powers or authority to go against or ignore the wishes of their  local or national assembly, is to grossly misinterpret his true meaning.  The Guardian has been at great pains to build up the administrative order  and teach the friends how to use it. How could he possibly himself act in  such a way as to ignore or belittle the functions of these bodies? He  often encourages believers to work, to teach, to pursue some plan they  propose in their letters to him but this does not mean a veto of the  assembly's rights, or that the individual thus becomes free to ignore its  authority. He trusts this will make the matter quite plain to the friends.    Regarding the matter of Mother Dunn's letter; the N.S.A., will, he feels  sure, do all in their power to allay the fears of Mother Dunn and smooth  out any misunderstandings that may arise. He feels, however, that you  should point out to Mother Dunn that if, at any future date, the believers  of Australia and New Zealand should wish to remove the remains of Father  Dunn and herself to a beautiful site in a Baha'i cemetery, or any other  chosen spot, they cannot do it without some legal authorization. Just at  present, after an infinite amount of red tape being gotten through, the  Egyptian N.S.A. has at last succeeded in getting arrangements made for the  transfer of Lua Getsinger's and Mirza Abu'l-Fadl's bodies to the new  Baha'i Cemetery. It is to ensure success and save trouble in the future,  that your assembly is asking her to delegate certain powers to it in this  matter. He feels sure she will cooperate fully when she understands the  matter.    In view of the criticalness of the times, the great issues facing the  entire human race, and the uncertainty of what perils and trials may yet  remain ahead of us to be endured, the Guardian feels, that the sooner  Father Dunn's memorial is erected the better. Mother Dunn may rest assured  in her heart that future believers of Australia will know how to honour  and cherish dear Father Dunn's grave; for the time being, though, it seems  to him, it would be wise to complete whatever arrangements are under way  as speedily as possible, subject, of course, to her acceptance, as he does  not want her to be distressed or unhappy over this matter.    The Guardian would be very glad to receive as soon as possible photographs  of Father Dunn's grave upon its completion, to be placed in the Mansion of  Baha'u'llah at Bahji.    He assures you all that he feels the greatest confidence in your ability  to aid the believers of Australia and New Zealand to weather all storms  during the dark days we are passing through. The friends of those two  countries have amply displayed their deep loyalty to the Faith, their  profound dedication to its Divine Mission, their adherence to its laws and  institutions. He always thinks of them with a heart at rest and feelings  of deep affection.    Rest assured that his loving prayers will continue to be offered on their  behalf, and for you and your fellow members of the N.S.A., who are serving  with such devotion and self-sacrifice the Holy Faith.    With warm Baha'i Greetings and love, R. Rabbani.    [From the Guardian:]    Dearly-beloved friends:    The spirit manifested by the valiant supporters of the Faith in Australia  and New Zealand is most encouraging, highly meritorious, and truly  exemplary. The work they have achieved, the plans they are devising, the  hopes they cherish for the future, fill me with admiration and evoke my  deepest gratitude. The Beloved will assuredly continue to illumine their  path, to sustain their efforts, and to bless their accomplishments in  these days of unprecedented stress, anxiety, and peril. I will continue to  supplicate for them all His abundant and imperishable blessings.    Your true and grateful brother,  Shoghi.            LETTER OF MARCH 19TH, 1943      Haifa, March 19th, 1943.    Dear Baha'i Sister:    Your letters, written on behalf of the National Spiritual Assembly, and  dated April 21st, 1942 and Nov. 18th, 1942, reached"]]]
