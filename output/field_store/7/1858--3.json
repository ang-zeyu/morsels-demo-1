God truly  knoweth the very recesses of your breasts.\"(61)    Ere long, thine eyes will behold the standards of divine power unfurled  throughout all regions, and the signs of His triumphant might and  sovereignty manifest in every land. As most of the divines have failed to  apprehend the meaning of these verses, and have not grasped the  significance of the Day of Resurrection, they therefore have foolishly  interpreted these verses according to their idle and faulty conception.  The one true God is My witness! Little perception is required to enable  them to gather from the symbolic language of these two verses all that We  have purposed to propound, and thus to attain, through the grace of the  All-Merciful, the resplendent morn of certitude. Such are the strains of  celestial melody which the immortal Bird of Heaven, warbling upon the  Sadrih of Baha, poureth out upon thee, that, by the permission of God,  thou mayest tread the path of divine knowledge and wisdom.    And now, concerning His words: \"And He shall send His angels....\" By  \"angels\" is meant those who, reinforced by the power of the spirit, have  consumed, with the fire of the love of God, all human traits and  limitations, and have clothed themselves with the attributes of the most  exalted Beings and of the Cherubim. That holy man, Sadiq,(62) in his  eulogy of the Cherubim, saith: \"There stand a company of our  fellow-_Sh_i'ihs behind the Throne.\" Divers and manifold are the  interpretations of the words \"behind the Throne.\" In one sense, they  indicate that no true _Sh_i'ihs exist. Even as he hath said in another  passage: \"A true believer is likened unto the philosopher's stone.\"  Addressing subsequently his listener, he saith: \"Hast thou ever seen the  philosopher's stone?\" Reflect, how this symbolic language, more eloquent  than any speech, however direct, testifieth to the non-existence of a true  believer. Such is the testimony of Sadiq. And now consider, how unfair and  numerous are those who, although they themselves have failed to inhale the  fragrance of belief, have condemned as infidels those by whose word belief  itself is recognized and established.    And now, inasmuch as these holy beings have sanctified themselves from  every human limitation, have become endowed with the attributes of the  spiritual, and have been adorned with the noble traits of the blessed,  they therefore have been designated as \"angels.\" Such is the meaning of  these verses, every word of which hath been expounded by the aid of the  most lucid texts, the most convincing arguments, and the best established  evidences.    As the adherents of Jesus have never understood the hidden meaning of  these words, and as the signs which they and the leaders of their Faith  have expected have failed to appear, they therefore refused to  acknowledge, even until now, the truth of those Manifestations of Holiness  that have since the days of Jesus been made manifest. They have thus  deprived themselves of the outpourings of God's holy grace, and of the  wonders of His divine utterance. Such is their low estate in this, the Day  of Resurrection! They have even failed to perceive that were the signs of  the Manifestation of God in every age to appear in the visible realm in  accordance with the text of established traditions, none could possibly  deny or turn away, nor would the blessed be distinguished from the  miserable, and the transgressor from the God-fearing. Judge fairly: Were  the prophecies recorded in the Gospel to be literally fulfilled; were  Jesus, Son of Mary, accompanied by angels, to descend from the visible  heaven upon the clouds; who would dare to disbelieve, who would dare to  reject the truth, and wax disdainful? Nay, such consternation would  immediately seize all the dwellers of the earth that no soul would feel  able to utter a word, much less to reject or accept the truth. It was  owing to their misunderstanding of these truths that many a Christian  divine hath objected to Muhammad, and voiced his protest in such words:  \"If Thou art in truth the promised Prophet, why then art Thou not  accompanied by those angels our sacred Books foretold, and which must  needs descend with the promised Beauty to assist Him in His Revelation and  act as warners unto His people?\" Even as the All-Glorious hath recorded  their statement: \"Why hath not an angel been sent down to him, so that he  should have been a warner with Him?\"(63)    Such objections and differences have persisted in every age and century.  The people have always busied themselves with such specious discourses,  vainly protesting: \"Wherefore hath not this or that sign appeared?\" Such  ills befell them only because they have clung to the ways of the divines  of the age in which they lived, and blindly imitated them in accepting or  denying these Essences of Detachment, these holy and divine Beings. These  leaders, owing to their immersion in selfish desires, and their pursuit of  transitory and sordid things, have regarded these divine Luminaries as  being opposed to the standards of their knowledge and understanding, and  the opponents of their ways and judgments. As they have literally  interpreted the Word of God, and the sayings and traditions of the Letters  of Unity, and expounded them according to their own deficient  understanding, they have therefore deprived themselves and all their  people of the bountiful showers of the grace and mercies of God. And yet  they bear witness to this well-known tradition: \"Verily Our Word is  abstruse, bewilderingly abstruse.\" In another instance, it is said: \"Our  Cause is sorely trying, highly perplexing; none can bear it except a  favorite of heaven, or an inspired Prophet, or he whose faith God hath  tested.\" These leaders of religion admit that none of these three  specified conditions is applicable to them. The first two conditions are  manifestly beyond their reach; as to the third, it is evident that at no  time have they been proof against those tests that have been sent by God,  and that when the divine Touchstone appeared, they have shown themselves  to be naught but dross.    Great God! Notwithstanding their acceptance of the truth of this  tradition, these divines who are still doubtful of, and dispute about, the  theological obscurities of their faith, yet claim to be the exponents of  the subtleties of the law of God, and the expounders of the essential  mysteries of His holy Word. They confidently assert that such traditions  as indicate the advent of the expected Qa'im have not yet been fulfilled,  whilst they themselves have failed to inhale the fragrance of the meaning  of these traditions, and are still oblivious of the fact that all the  signs foretold have come to pass, that the way of God's holy Cause hath  been revealed, and the concourse of the faithful, swift as lightning, are,  even now, passing upon that way, whilst these foolish divines wait  expecting to witness the signs foretold. Say, O ye foolish ones! Wait ye  even as those before you are waiting!    Were they to be questioned concerning those signs that must needs herald  the revelation and rise of the sun of the Muhammadan Dispensation, to  which We have already referred, none of which have been literally  fulfilled, and were it to be said to them: \"Wherefore have ye rejected the  claims advanced by Christians and the peoples of other faiths and regard  them as infidels,\" knowing not what answer to give, they will reply:  \"These Books have been corrupted and are not, and never have been, of  God.\" Reflect: the words of the verses themselves eloquently testify to  the truth that they are of God. A similar verse hath been also revealed in  the Qur'an, were ye of them that comprehend. Verily I say, throughout all  this period they have utterly failed to comprehend what is meant by  corrupting the text.    Yea, in the writings and utterances of the Mirrors reflecting the sun of  the Muhammadan Dispensation mention hath been made of \"Modification by the  exalted beings\" and \"alteration by the disdainful.\" Such passages,  however, refer only to particular cases. Among them is the story of  Ibn-i-Suriya. When the people of _Kh_aybar asked the focal center of the  Muhammadan Revelation concerning the penalty of adultery committed between  a married man and a married woman, Muhammad answered and said: \"The law of  God is death by stoning.\" Whereupon they protested saying: \"No such law  hath been revealed in the Pentateuch.\" Muhammad answered and said: \"Whom  do ye regard among your rabbis as being a recognized authority and having  a sure knowledge of the truth?\" They agreed upon Ibn-i-Suriya. Thereupon  Muhammad summoned him and said: \"I adjure thee by God Who clove the sea  for you, caused manna to descend upon you, and the cloud to overshadow  you, Who delivered you from Pharaoh and his people, and exalted you above  all human beings, to tell us what Moses hath decreed concerning adultery  between a married man and a married woman.\" He made reply: \"O Muhammad!  death by stoning is the law.\" Muhammad observed: \"Why is it then that this  law is annulled and hath ceased to operate among the Jews?\" He answered  and said: \"When Nebuchadnezzar delivered Jerusalem to the flames, and put  the Jews to death, only a few survived. The divines of that age,  considering the extremely limited number of the Jews, and the multitude of  the Amalekites, took counsel together, and came to the conclusion that  were they to enforce the law of the Pentateuch, every survivor who hath  been delivered from the hand of Nebuchadnezzar would have to be put to  death according to the verdict of the Book. Owing to such considerations,  they totally repealed the penalty of death.\" Meanwhile Gabriel inspired  Muhammad's illumined heart with these words: \"They pervert the text of the  Word of God.\"(64)    This is one of the instances that have been referred to. Verily by  \"perverting\" "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16984"],[0,"Prayers and Meditations (#10)"],[1," recounted throughout Thy  realm. Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the  Ever-Forgiving, the Most Generous.    Praised be Thou, O Lord my God! This is Thy servant whom Thou hast in the  kingdom of Thy names called by Thine own name, and whom Thou hast reared  under the wings of Thy grace and favors. Thou seest him, therefore,  hastening in the direction of Thy gifts, and rushing forth towards Thee  seeking after Thy bounty. Attire him, O my God, with the mantle of Thy  favor and the robe of Thy munificence and generosity, that all created  things may perceive from him the sweet smell of the raiment of Thy love.  Adorn, then, his head with the crown of Thy remembrance, in such wise that  his fame may be noised abroad among Thy servants as one who loveth Thee  and cleaveth steadfastly to Thy Cause. Assist him, moreover, at all times  and under all conditions to help Thee and to remember Thee, and to extol  Thy virtues amidst Thy creatures.    I swear by Thy glory, O my God! Every time I muse on Thy glory and Thy  sovereignty I find myself as the most guilty among them that have  transgressed against Thee in Thy realm, and every time I contemplate the  heights in which none except Thee can abide, I discover that I am the most  sinful of all the creatures that dwell in Thy land. Had it not been for  Thy name, the Concealer, and for Thy name, the Ever-Forgiving, and for the  sweet savors of Thy name, the Most Merciful, all Thy chosen ones had been  reckoned amongst the perverse and the wicked.    I render Thee thanks that Thy mercy hath overtaken them and Thy grace and  bountiful favors compassed them on every side.    And now, having confessed the things Thou didst cause to flow down from my  Pen, I implore Thee, by Thy name which Thou hast raised up above every  other name, and hast caused to overshadow all that are in heaven and all  that are on earth, to cast not away him that hath turned towards Thee, and  to deny him not the wonders of Thy grace and the hidden evidences of Thy  mercy. Let the hands of Thine omnipotence kindle in his heart a lamp that  will enable him to shine brightly in Thy days, and to cry out with such  vehemence in Thy name that no timidity will deter him from soaring in the  atmosphere of Thy love, and from ascending to the horizon of rapture and  longing for Thee, and that the pursuits of Thy creatures will not withhold  him from magnifying Thy word, that Thou mayest behold him sanctified as  Thou wishest and as beseemeth Thy majesty and glory.    Exalted though this station may be, O my God, and however excellent this  position--for who else except Thyself hath the power to show forth what may  be deemed worthy of Thine exaltation and befit Thy greatness--yet Thou art  He Who is the All-Bountiful, the Most Compassionate. All the atoms of the  earth testify that Thou art the Ever-Forgiving, the Benevolent, the Great  Giver, the All-Glorious, the All-Wise. Look, then, upon him, O my God,  with the eyes of Thy loving-kindness, and cast upon him the glance of Thy  generosity. Enrapture him, moreover, with the sweet melodies of Him Who is  the Fountain-Head of Thy Revelation, in such wise that he may wholly  surrender his will to Thy pleasure, and fix his hopes upon the things Thou  didst ordain in Thy Tablets. Strengthen, then, his heart by Thy name, the  Almighty, the Faithful, that he may draw forth the hand of power, and with  it help Thy Cause when the light of Thy beauty is manifested and the  Day-Star of Thy majesty is risen.    Since Thou hast called him by Thy name, O my Lord, single him out among  Thy servants for Thy service. Thou well knowest, O my Lord, that in  revealing myself I have sought only to reveal Thy Cause, and have turned  to no one except for the sake of Thy Revelation and for the purpose of  manifesting Thy loving-kindness. I beseech Thee, by Thy treasured Name  Who, at this very moment, is speaking, to send down upon him and upon them  that love Thee that which is enshrined in the heaven of Thy favor and  bounties, that they may be filled with vehement longing towards Thee, and  exult in Thy Covenant, O Thou Who art the Lord of Lords! Ordain, then, for  him and for them that which becometh Thy name, the All-Bountiful.    Thou art, in truth, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the Most Powerful, the  All-Glorious, the Most Great.            XLV: \"MY GOD, MY FIRE AND MY LIGHT! THE DAYS WHICH...\"      My God, my Fire and my Light! The days which Thou hast named the  Ayyam-i-Ha (the Days of Ha, Intercalary days) in Thy Book have begun, O  Thou Who art the King of names, and the fast which Thy most exalted Pen  hath enjoined unto all who are in the kingdom of Thy creation to observe  is approaching. I entreat Thee, O my Lord, by these days and by all such  as have during that period clung to the cord of Thy commandments, and laid  hold on the handle of Thy precepts, to grant that unto every soul may be  assigned a place within the precincts of Thy court, and a seat at the  revelation of the splendors of the light of Thy countenance.    These, O my Lord, are Thy servants whom no corrupt inclination hath kept  back from what Thou didst send down in Thy Book. They have bowed  themselves before Thy Cause, and received Thy Book with such resolve as is  born of Thee, and observed what Thou hadst prescribed unto them, and  chosen to follow that which had been sent down by Thee.    Thou seest, O my Lord, how they have recognized and confessed whatsoever  Thou hast revealed in Thy Scriptures. Give them to drink, O my Lord, from  the hands of Thy graciousness the waters of Thine eternity. Write down,  then, for them the recompense ordained for him that hath immersed himself  in the ocean of Thy presence, and attained unto the choice wine of Thy  meeting.    I implore Thee, O Thou the King of kings and the Pitier of the  downtrodden, to ordain for them the good of this world and of the world to  come. Write down for them, moreover, what none of Thy creatures hath  discovered, and number them with those who have circled round Thee, and  who move about Thy throne in every world of Thy worlds.    Thou, truly, art the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.            XLVI: \"PRAISED BE THOU, O MY GOD, THAT THOU HAST ORDAINED...\"      Praised be Thou, O my God, that Thou hast ordained Naw-Ruz as a festival  unto those who have observed the fast for love of Thee and abstained from  all that is abhorrent unto Thee. Grant, O my Lord, that the fire of Thy  love and the heat produced by the fast enjoined by Thee may inflame them  in Thy Cause, and make them to be occupied with Thy praise and with  remembrance of Thee.    Since Thou hast adorned them, O my Lord, with the ornament of the fast  prescribed by Thee, do Thou adorn them also with the ornament of Thine  acceptance, through Thy grace and bountiful favor. For the doings of men  are all dependent upon Thy good-pleasure, and are conditioned by Thy  behest. Shouldst Thou regard him who hath broken the fast as one who hath  observed it, such a man would be reckoned among them who from eternity had  been keeping the fast. And shouldst Thou decree that he who hath observed  the fast hath broken it, that person would be numbered with such as have  caused the Robe of Thy Revelation to be stained with dust, and been far  removed from the crystal waters of this living Fountain.    Thou art He through Whom the ensign \"Praiseworthy art Thou in Thy works\"  hath been lifted up, and the standard \"Obeyed art Thou in Thy behest\" hath  been unfurled. Make known this Thy station, O my God, unto Thy servants,  that they may be made aware that the excellence of all things is dependent  upon Thy bidding and Thy word, and the virtue of every act is conditioned  by Thy leave and the good-pleasure of Thy will, and may recognize that the  reins of men's doings are within the grasp of Thine acceptance and Thy  commandment. Make this known unto them, that nothing whatsoever may shut  them out from Thy Beauty, in these days whereon the Christ exclaimeth:  \"All dominion is Thine, O Thou the Begetter of the Spirit (Jesus)\"; and  Thy Friend (Muhammad) crieth out: \"Glory be to Thee, O Thou the  Best-Beloved, for that Thou hast uncovered Thy Beauty, and written down  for Thy chosen ones what will cause them to attain unto the seat of the  revelation of Thy Most Great Name, through which all the peoples have  lamented except such as have detached themselves from all else except  Thee, and set themselves towards Him Who is the Revealer of Thyself and  the Manifestation of Thine attributes.\"    He Who is Thy Branch and all Thy company, O my Lord, have broken this day  their fast, after having observed it within the precincts of Thy court,  and in their eagerness to please Thee. Do Thou ordain for him, and for  them, and for all such as have entered Thy presence in those days all the  good Thou didst destine in Thy Book. Supply them, then, with that which  will profit them, in both this life and in the life beyond.    Thou, in truth, art the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.            XLVII: \"O THOU THE LORD OF THE VISIBLE AND THE INVISIBLE,...\"      O Thou the Lord of the visible and the invisible, and the Enlightener of  all creation! I beseech Thee, by Thy sovereignty which is hid from the  eyes of men, to reveal in all directions the signs of Thy manifold  blessings and the tokens of Thy loving-kindness, that I may arise with  exultation and rapture and extol Thy wondrous virtues, O Thou the Most  Merciful, and stir up by Thy name all created things, and so kindle the  fire of Thy glorification amidst Thy creatures, that all the world may be  filled with the brightness of the light of Thy glory, and all existence be  inflamed with the fire of Thy Cause.    Roll not up, O my Lord, what hath been spread out in Thy name, and  extinguish not the lamp which Thine own fire hath lit. Withhold not, O my  Lord, the water that is life indeed from running down--th"]]]
