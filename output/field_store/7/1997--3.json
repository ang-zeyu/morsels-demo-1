Koom itself is  a cave; Koom-in, a hole; Zi-koom, a valley; Koom-zi, vacancy or void;  Bodh-koom, ignorance (literally, knowledge-void). Koom-posh is their  name for the government of the many, or the ascendancy of the most  ignorant or hollow. Posh is an almost untranslatable idiom, implying, as  the reader will see later, contempt. The closest rendering I can give to  it is our slang term, \"bosh;\" and this Koom-Posh may be loosely rendered  \"Hollow-Bosh.\" But when Democracy or Koom-Posh degenerates from popular  ignorance into that popular passion or ferocity which precedes its  decease, as (to cite illustrations from the upper world) during the  French Reign of Terror, or for the fifty years of the Roman Republic  preceding the ascendancy of Augustus, their name for that state of  things is Glek-Nas. Ek is strife--Glek, the universal strife. Nas, as I  before said, is corruption or rot; thus, Glek-Nas may be construed, \"the  universal strife-rot.\" Their compounds are very expressive; thus,  Bodh being knowledge, and Too a participle that implies the action of  cautiously approaching,--Too-bodh is their word for Philosophy; Pah is  a contemptuous exclamation analogous to our idiom, \"stuff and nonsense;\"  Pah-bodh (literally stuff and nonsense-knowledge) is their term for  futile and false philosophy, and applied to a species of metaphysical or  speculative ratiocination formerly in vogue, which consisted in making  inquiries that could not be answered, and were not worth making; such,  for instance, as \"Why does an An have five toes to his feet instead of  four or six? Did the first An, created by the All-Good, have the same  number of toes as his descendants? In the form by which an An will be  recognised by his friends in the future state of being, will he retain  any toes at all, and, if so, will they be material toes or spiritual  toes?\" I take these illustrations of Pahbodh, not in irony or jest, but  because the very inquiries I name formed the subject of controversy by  the latest cultivators of that 'science,'--4000 years ago.    In the declension of nouns I was informed that anciently there were  eight cases (one more than in the Sanskrit Grammar); but the effect  of time has been to reduce these cases, and multiply, instead of these  varying terminations, explanatory propositions. At present, in the  Grammar submitted to my study, there were four cases to nouns, three  having varying terminations, and the fourth a differing prefix.         SINGULAR.                          PLURAL.       Nom.     An,            Man,  |   Nom.    Ana,              Men.       Dat.     Ano,        to Man,  |   Dat.    Anoi,          to Men.       Ac.      Anan,          Man,  |   Ac.     Ananda,           Men.       Voc.     Hil-an,      O Man,  |   Voc.    Hil-Ananda,     O Men.    In the elder inflectional literature the dual form existed--it has long  been obsolete.    The genitive case with them is also obsolete; the dative supplies its  place: they say the House 'to' a Man, instead of the House 'of' a Man.  When used (sometimes in poetry), the genitive in the termination is the  same as the nominative; so is the ablative, the preposition that marks  it being a prefix or suffix at option, and generally decided by ear,  according to the sound of the noun. It will be observed that the  prefix Hil marks the vocative case. It is always retained in addressing  another, except in the most intimate domestic relations; its omission  would be considered rude: just as in our of forms of speech in  addressing a king it would have been deemed disrespectful to say \"King,\"  and reverential to say \"O King.\" In fact, as they have no titles of  honour, the vocative adjuration supplies the place of a title, and is  given impartially to all. The prefix Hil enters into the composition of  words that imply distant communications, as Hil-ya, to travel.    In the conjugation of their verbs, which is much too lengthy a subject  to enter on here, the auxiliary verb Ya, \"to go,\" which plays so  considerable part in the Sanskrit, appears and performs a kindred  office, as if it were a radical in some language from which both  had descended. But another auxiliary or opposite signification also  accompanies it and shares its labours--viz., Zi, to stay or repose. Thus  Ya enters into the future tense, and Zi in the preterite of all verbs  requiring auxiliaries. Yam, I shall go--Yiam, I may go--Yani-ya, I shall  go (literally, I go to go), Zam-poo-yan, I have gone (literally, I  rest from gone). Ya, as a termination, implies by analogy, progress,  movement, efflorescence. Zi, as a terminal, denotes fixity, sometimes in  a good sense, sometimes in a bad, according to the word with which it  is coupled. Iva-zi, eternal goodness; Nan-zi, eternal evil. Poo (from)  enters as a prefix to words that denote repugnance, or things from  which we ought to be averse. Poo-pra, disgust; Poo-naria, falsehood,  the vilest kind of evil. Poosh or Posh I have already confessed to be  untranslatable literally. It is an expression of contempt not unmixed  with pity. This radical seems to have originated from inherent sympathy  between the labial effort and the sentiment that impelled it, Poo being  an utterance in which the breath is exploded from the lips with more or  less vehemence. On the other hand, Z, when an initial, is with them a  sound in which the breath is sucked inward, and thus Zu, pronounced Zoo  (which in their language is one letter), is the ordinary prefix to words  that signify something that attracts, pleases, touches the heart--as  Zummer, lover; Zutze, love; Zuzulia, delight. This indrawn sound of  Z seems indeed naturally appropriate to fondness. Thus, even in our  language, mothers say to their babies, in defiance of grammar, \"Zoo  darling;\" and I have heard a learned professor at Boston call his wife  (he had been only married a month) \"Zoo little pet.\"    I cannot quit this subject, however, without observing by what slight  changes in the dialects favoured by different tribes of the same race,  the original signification and beauty of sounds may become confused and  deformed. Zee told me with much indignation that Zummer (lover) which in  the way she uttered it, seemed slowly taken down to the very depths of  her heart, was, in some not very distant communities of the Vril-ya,  vitiated into the half-hissing, half-nasal, wholly disagreeable, sound  of Subber. I thought to myself it only wanted the introduction of 'n'  before 'u' to render it into an English word significant of the last  quality an amorous Gy would desire in her Zummer.    I will but mention another peculiarity in this language which gives  equal force and brevity to its forms of expressions.    A is with them, as with us, the first letter of the alphabet, and  is often used as a prefix word by itself to convey a complex idea of  sovereignty or chiefdom, or presiding principle. For instance, Iva is  goodness; Diva, goodness and happiness united; A-Diva is unerring and  absolute truth. I have already noticed the value of A in A-glauran,  so, in vril (to whose properties they trace their present state of  civilisation), A-vril, denotes, as I have said, civilisation itself.    The philologist will have seen from the above how much the language  of the Vril-ya is akin to the Aryan or Indo-Germanic; but, like all  languages, it contains words and forms in which transfers from very  opposite sources of speech have been taken. The very title of Tur, which  they give to their supreme magistrate, indicates theft from a tongue  akin to the Turanian. They say themselves that this is a foreign word  borrowed from a title which their historical records show to have been  borne by the chief of a nation with whom the ancestors of the Vril-ya  were, in very remote periods, on friendly terms, but which has long  become extinct, and they say that when, after the discovery of vril,  they remodelled their political institutions, they expressly adopted a  title taken from an extinct race and a dead language for that of their  chief magistrate, in order to avoid all titles for that office with  which they had previous associations.    Should life be spared to me, I may collect into systematic form such  knowledge as I acquired of this language during my sojourn amongst the  Vril-ya. But what I have already said will perhaps suffice to show to  genuine philological students that a language which, preserving so many  of the roots in the aboriginal form, and clearing from the immediate,  but transitory, polysynthetical stage so many rude incumbrances, has  attained to such a union of simplicity and compass in its final  inflectional forms, must have been the gradual work of countless ages  and many varieties of mind ; that it contains the evidence of fusion  between congenial races, and necessitated, in arriving at the shape of  which I have given examples, the continuous culture of a highly  thoughtful people.    That, nevertheless, the literature which belongs to this language is a  literature of the past; that the present felicitous state of society at  which the Ana have attained forbids the progressive cultivation of  literature, especially in the two main divisions of fiction and history,  --I shall have occasion to show.          Chapter XIII.      This people have a religion, and, whatever may be said against it, at  least it has these strange peculiarities: firstly, that all believe in  the creed they profess; secondly, that they all practice the precepts  which the creed inculcates. They unite in the worship of one divine  Creator and Sustainer of the universe. They believe that it is one of  the properties of the all-permeating agency of vril, to transmit to  the well-spring of life and intelligence every thought that a living  creature can conceive;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19511"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: Wimborne Minster and Christchurch Priory (#10)"],[1,"LIBRARY.]    The #Vestry# stands in the south-east angle between the transept  and choir aisle; it is a vaulted building dating from the fourteenth  century, and is lighted by two windows, one looking to the east, the  other to the south. A small door at the south-west corner opens upon the  staircase leading to the #Library#--a chamber situated above the vestry.  The collection consists chiefly of books left to the minster by will  of the Rev. William Stone, Principal of New Inn Hall, Oxford, a native  of Wimborne. They were brought from Oxford in 1686, under the care of  the Rev. Richard Lloyd, at that time Master of the Grammar School at  Wimborne. The books are chiefly works on divinity; some additions were  subsequently and at various times made to the original collection. The  books were attached to the shelves for safety's sake by iron chains, the  upper end carrying rings which slid on rods fastened to the shelf above,  the other end to the edge of the binding of the books. Hence the volumes  had to be placed on the shelves with their backs to the walls. The room  in which the books were placed was formerly known as the Treasury; it  was refitted in 1857, but the old chains are still used. It would occupy  too much space were any attempt made to give a list of the books. The  oldest volume is a manuscript of 1343, \"Regimen Animarum,\" written on  vellum, and containing a few illuminated initials. A \"Breeches,\"  Black-Letter Bible, dated 1595, is another book worth mentioning; also  a volume of Sir Walter Raleigh's History of the World. A hole was burnt  through 104 of its pages. It is said that Matthew Prior, the poet, was  reading it by candle light and fell asleep, and when he woke was much  distressed to find that the snuff from his candle had done the mischief.  He did his best to repair the damage, by placing a tiny piece of paper  over the hole in each page, and inserting the missing letters with pen  and ink. The book has since been rebound, leaves taken from another copy  having been bound in between the damaged pages.    [Illustration: THE CRYPT.]    [Illustration: THE FONT.]    The lower part of the west tower is used as a baptistery; this is  separated from the nave by a screen, formed of fragments of the old rood  screen. In the centre stands the octagonal late Norman #Font#, supported  by eight slender shafts of Purbeck marble, and a modern spirally-carved  central pillar of white stone, through which runs the drain to carry off  the water.    [Illustration: THE CLOCK IN THE WEST TOWER.]    In the inner southern wall of this tower, rather low down, is fixed a  curious old #Clock# made by Peter Lightfoot, a Glastonbury monk, in the  early part of the fourteenth century. The earth is represented by a  globe in the centre, the sun by a disc which travels round it once in  twenty-four hours, showing the time of day; the moon by a globe so  fastened to a blue disc that it revolves once during a lunar month; half  of this is painted black, the other half is gilt, and the age of the  moon is indicated by the amount of the gilded portion visible--when the  moon is full the whole of the gilt hemisphere is shown, when new the  whole of the black. This clock still goes, the works being in a room in  the tower above. It requires winding once a day. The same clock also  causes the Jack outside the tower to strike the quarters.    In the #Belfry# is a peal of eight bells. The tenor weighs about 36  cwts., the treble 7 cwts.    The tenor bears this inscription:        MR WILHEMUS LORINGE ME PRIMO FECIT,          IN HONOREM  STAE CUTBERGAE.      RENOVABAR SUMPTU PAROCHALI PER AB,              ANNO DOMINI 1629.    The seventh bell is dated 1798.    The sixth bell 1600, and is thus inscribed: \"SOUND OUT THE BELLS, IN GOD  REGOYCE.\"    The fifth 1698, \"PRAISE THE LORD.\"    The fourth 1686, \"PULSATA ROSAMUNDI MARIA VOCATA. SMV.\"    The third was originally the smallest bell of the peal, and bears the  Latin hexameter: \"SUM MINIMA HIC CAMPANA, AT INEST, SUA GRATIA PARVIS,\"  and the words, \"THIS BELL WAS ADDED TO YE FIVE IN 1686, Samuel Knight.\"  The two smaller bells are of recent date.    The #Lectern# bears date 1623. The stone pulpit is modern (1868).  The old wooden pulpit, whose place it has taken, has been removed to the  church at Holt.    The earliest mention of an #Organ# is in 1405, but the earliest  authentic record is of one set up by John Vaucks, Organ Master,  in 1533. A memorandum in the churchwardens' accounts speak of him  setting up a pair of organs on the rood loft. In the year 1643, we have  records of the sale of organ-pipes and old tin. After the Restoration  in 1664, we have a record of the purchase of a new organ for L180.  This was repaired, enlarged, and rebuilt at various times, and at the  restoration, when the rood screen was unfortunately destroyed, the organ  was placed in the south choir aisle.    All the lower windows are now filled with painted glass; all of which,  with the exception of a few fragments, is nineteenth-century work.

The date of the foundation of  this hospital is uncertain; tradition has it that it was founded by  John of Gaunt, son of Edward III., but this is without doubt wrong,  as documents--the character of which seem to indicate an early  thirteenth-century date--have been found, from which it appears that  this hospital existed at that time, and was set apart for the relief and  support of poor persons afflicted with leprosy. This disease was at one  time so common in England that a great number of lazar-houses were  erected in the country, and many were well endowed; but when, after a  time, the disease became less violent, many abuses crept in, persons not  really suffering from the disease pretended to be lepers in order to get  pecuniary benefits, and hence in many cases the leper hospitals were  suppressed, or converted to other purposes. At the present day we find  in many places, as here at Wimborne, that they are used as almshouses.    [Illustration: ST MARGARET'S HOSPITAL.]    This hospital, however, was not one of the well-endowed. It appears from  a deed, dated in the sixteenth year of Henry VIII., that the hospital  was chiefly maintained, not by endowments, but by the gifts of the  charitable who were willing to contribute to its support; and to  encourage the benevolent to give, the deed recites that \"Pope Innocent  IV, in the year 1245, by an indulgans or bulle did assoyl them of all  syns forgotten, and offences done against fader and moder, and all  swerynges neglygently made. This indulgans, grantyd of Petyr and Powle,  and of the said pope, was to hold good for 51 yeres and 260 days,  provided they repeated a certain specified number of Paternosters and  Ave Marias daily.\" The date of this indulgence proves the antiquity of  the hospital, as it shows that it was in existence before the middle  of the thirteenth century. A chantry was also founded in the chapel  here by John Redcoddes of one priest to say masses for his soul. To this  chantry, according to a deed dated in the sixteenth year of Henry VI.,  many tenements in Wimborne belonged. In later times the Rev. William  Stone, who has been mentioned before as the founder of the Minster  Library, by his will left his lands and tenements in the parish of  Wimborne Minster to be applied to the benefit of almsmen only who should  live in St Margaret's Hospital.    There is a further endowment, but how it came to this hospital has not  been discovered. The advowson and tithes of the Rectory of Poole were,  in the reign of James I., granted to the Mayor and Corporation of Poole  for forty years, on the corporation undertaking to find a curate to  discharge the duties lately discharged by the vicar, and to pay a rent  to the crown of L12, 16s. per annum. In the reign of Charles I., the  advowson and tithes were granted to two men, Thomas Ashton and Henry  Harryman, and their heirs for ever, on the same conditions; but they are  now again held by the Corporation, who pay out of the revenues--to St  Margaret's hospital L9, 16s.; to the churchwardens of Wimborne Minster,  for the maintenance of the Etricke tomb, L1; and"]]]
