Desire and self come in the door  And blot out virtue, bright before,  And a hundred veils will rise  From the heart, to blind the eyes.    True civilization will unfurl its banner in the midmost heart of the world  whenever a certain number of its distinguished and high-minded  sovereigns--the shining exemplars of devotion and determination--shall, for  the good and happiness of all mankind, arise, with firm resolve and clear  vision, to establish the Cause of Universal Peace. They must make the  Cause of Peace the object of general consultation, and seek by every means  in their power to establish a Union of the nations of the world. They must  conclude a binding treaty and establish a covenant, the provisions of  which shall be sound, inviolable and definite. They must proclaim it to  all the world and obtain for it the sanction of all the human race. This  supreme and noble undertaking--the real source of the peace and well-being  of all the world--should be regarded as sacred by all that dwell on earth.  All the forces of humanity must be mobilized to ensure the stability and  permanence of this Most Great Covenant. In this all-embracing Pact the  limits and frontiers of each and every nation should be clearly fixed, the  principles underlying the relations of governments towards one another  definitely laid down, and all international agreements and obligations  ascertained. In like manner, the size of the armaments of every government  should be strictly limited, for if the preparations for war and the  military forces of any nation should be allowed to increase, they will  arouse the suspicion of others. The fundamental principle underlying this  solemn Pact should be so fixed that if any government later violate any  one of its provisions, all the governments on earth should arise to reduce  it to utter submission, nay the human race as a whole should resolve, with  every power at its disposal, to destroy that government. Should this  greatest of all remedies be applied to the sick body of the world, it will  assuredly recover from its ills and will remain eternally safe and  secure.(41)    Observe that if such a happy situation be forthcoming, no government would  need continually to pile up the weapons of war, nor feel itself obliged to  produce ever new military weapons with which to conquer the human race. A  small force for the purposes of internal security, the correction of  criminal and disorderly elements and the prevention of local disturbances,  would be required--no more. In this way the entire population would, first  of all, be relieved of the crushing burden of expenditure currently  imposed for military purposes, and secondly, great numbers of people would  cease to devote their time to the continual devising of new weapons of  destruction--those testimonials of greed and bloodthirstiness, so  inconsistent with the gift of life--and would instead bend their efforts to  the production of whatever will foster human existence and peace and  well-being, and would become the cause of universal development and  prosperity. Then every nation on earth will reign in honor, and every  people will be cradled in tranquillity and content.    A few, unaware of the power latent in human endeavor, consider this matter  as highly impracticable, nay even beyond the scope of man's utmost  efforts. Such is not the case, however. On the contrary, thanks to the  unfailing grace of God, the loving-kindness of His favored ones, the  unrivaled endeavors of wise and capable souls, and the thoughts and ideas  of the peerless leaders of this age, nothing whatsoever can be regarded as  unattainable. Endeavor, ceaseless endeavor, is required. Nothing short of  an indomitable determination can possibly achieve it. Many a cause which  past ages have regarded as purely visionary, yet in this day has become  most easy and practicable. Why should this most great and lofty Cause--the  daystar of the firmament of true civilization and the cause of the glory,  the advancement, the well-being and the success of all humanity--be  regarded as impossible of achievement? Surely the day will come when its  beauteous light shall shed illumination upon the assemblage of man.    The apparatus of conflict will, as preparations go on at their present  rate, reach the point where war will become something intolerable to  mankind.    It is clear from what has already been said that man's glory and greatness  do not consist in his being avid for blood and sharp of claw, in tearing  down cities and spreading havoc, in butchering armed forces and civilians.  What would mean a bright future for him would be his reputation for  justice, his kindness to the entire population whether high or low, his  building up countries and cities, villages and districts, his making life  easy, peaceful and happy for his fellow beings, his laying down  fundamental principles for progress, his raising the standards and  increasing the wealth of the entire population.    Consider how throughout history many a king has sat on his throne as a  conqueror. Among them were Hulague _Kh_an and Tamerlane, who took over the  vast continent of Asia, and Alexander of Macedon and Napoleon I, who  stretched their arrogant fists over three of the earth's five continents.  And what was gained by all their mighty victories? Was any country made to  flourish, did any happiness result, did any throne stand? Or was it rather  that those reigning houses lost their power? Except that Asia went up in  the flame of many battles and fell away to ashes, _Ch_angiz's Hulague, the  warlord, gathered no fruit from all his conquests. And Tamerlane, out of  all his triumphs, reaped only the peoples blown to the winds, and  universal ruin. And Alexander had nothing to show for his vast victories,  except that his son toppled from the throne and Philip and Ptolemy took  over the dominions he once had ruled. And what did the first Napoleon gain  from subjugating the kings of Europe, except the destruction of  flourishing countries, the downfall of their inhabitants, the spreading of  terror and anguish across Europe and, at the end of his days, his own  captivity? So much for the conquerors and the monuments they leave behind  them.    Contrast with this the praiseworthy qualities and the greatness and  nobility of Anu_sh_irvan the Generous and the Just.(42) That fair-minded  monarch came to power at a time when the once solidly established throne  of Persia was about to crumble away. With his Divine gift of intellect, he  laid the foundations of justice, uprooting oppression and tyranny and  gathering the scattered peoples of Persia under the wings of his dominion.  Thanks to the restoring influence of his continual care, Persia that had  lain withered and desolate was quickened into life and rapidly changed  into the fairest of all flourishing nations. He rebuilt and reinforced the  disorganized powers of the state, and the renown of his righteousness and  justice echoed across the seven climes,(43) until the peoples rose up out  of their degradation and misery to the heights of felicity and honor.  Although he was a Magian, Muhammad, that Center of creation and Sun of  prophethood, said of him: \"I was born in the time of a just king,\" and  rejoiced at having come into the world during his reign. Did this  illustrious personage achieve his exalted station by virtue of his  admirable qualities or rather by reaching out to conquer the earth and  spill the blood of its peoples? Observe that he attained to such a  distinguished rank in the heart of the world that his greatness still  rings out through all the impermanence of time, and he won eternal life.  Should We comment on the continuing life of the great, this brief essay  would be unduly prolonged, and since it is by no means certain that public  opinion in Persia will be materially affected by its perusal, We shall  abridge the work, and go on to other matters which come within the purview  of the public mind. If, however, it develops that this abridgement  produces favorable results, We shall, God willing, write a number of books  dealing at length and usefully with fundamental principles of the Divine  wisdom in its relation to the phenomenal world.    No power on earth can prevail against the armies of justice, and every  citadel must fall before them; for men willingly go down under the  triumphant strokes of this decisive blade, and desolate places bloom and  flourish under the tramplings of this host. There are two mighty banners  which, when they cast their shadow across the crown of any king, will  cause the influence of his government quickly and easily to penetrate the  whole earth, even as if it were the light of the sun: the first of these  two banners is wisdom; the second is justice. Against these two most  potent forces, the iron hills cannot prevail, and Alexander's wall will  break before them. It is clear that life in this fast-fading world is as  fleeting and inconstant as the morning wind, and this being so, how  fortunate are the great who leave a good name behind them, and the memory  of a lifetime spent in the pathway of the good pleasure of God.    It is all one, if it be a throne  Or the bare ground under the open sky,  Where the pure soul lays him  Down to die.(44)    A conquest can be a praiseworthy thing, and there are times when war  becomes the powerful basis of peace, and ruin the very means of  reconstruction. If, for example, a high-minded sovereign marshals his  troops to block the onset of the insurgent and the aggressor, or again, if  he takes the field and distinguishes himself in a struggle to unify a  divided state and people, if, in brief, he is waging war for a righteous  purpose, then this seeming wrath is mercy itself, and this apparent  tyranny the very substance of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19238"],[0,"Foundations of World Unity (#10)"],[1,". What distinction is  there? What prerogatives, what perfections? None whatever! Animals are  better even--thinking only of themselves and negligent of the needs of  others.    Consider how the greatest men in the world--whether among prophets or  philosophers--all have forfeited their own comfort, have sacrificed their  own pleasure for the well-being of humanity. They have sacrificed their  own lives for the body politic. They have sacrificed their own wealth for  that of the general welfare. They have forfeited their own honor for the  honor of mankind. Therefore it becomes evident that this is the highest  attainment for the world of humanity.    We ask God to endow human souls with justice so that they may be fair, and  may strive to provide for the comfort of all, that each member of humanity  may pass his life in the utmost comfort and welfare. Then this material  world will become the very paradise of the Kingdom, this elemental earth  will be in a heavenly state and all the servants of God will live in the  utmost joy, happiness and gladness. We must all strive and concentrate all  our thoughts in order that such happiness may accrue to the world of  humanity.            \"THE QUESTION OF SOCIALIZATION IS VERY IMPORTANT. IT WILL NOT BE...\"      The question of socialization is very important. It will not be solved by  strikes for wages. All the governments of the world must be united and  organize an assembly the members of which should be elected from the  parliaments and the nobles of the nations. These must plan with utmost  wisdom and power so that neither the capitalist suffer from enormous  losses nor the laborers become needy. In the utmost moderation they should  make the law; then announce to the public that the rights of the working  people are to be strongly preserved. Also the rights of the capitalists  are to be protected. When such a general plan is adopted by the will of  both sides, should a strike occur, all the governments of the world  collectively should resist it. Otherwise, the labor problem will lead to  much destruction, especially in Europe. Terrible things will take place.    For instance, the owners of properties, mines and factories should share  their incomes with their employees and give a fairly certain percentage of  their products to their workingmen in order that the employees may  receive, beside their wages, some of the general income of the factory so  that the employee may strive with his soul in the work.    No more trusts will remain in the future. The question of the trusts will  be wiped away entirely. Also, every factory that has ten thousand shares  will give two thousand shares of these ten thousand to its employees and  will write the shares in their names, so that they may have them, and the  rest will belong to the capitalists. Then at the end of the month or year  whatever they may earn after the expenses and wages are paid, according to  the number of shares, should be divided among both. In reality, so far  great injustice has befallen the common people. Laws must be made because  it is impossible for the laborers to be satisfied with the present system.  They will strike every month and every year. Finally, the capitalists will  lose. In ancient times a strike occurred among the Turkish soldiers. They  said to the government: \"Our wages are very small and they should be  increased.\" The government was forced to give them their demands. Shortly  afterwards they struck again. Finally all the incomes went to the pockets  of the soldiers to the extent that they killed the king, saying: \"Why  didst thou not increase the income so that we might have received more?\"    It is impossible for a country to live properly without laws. To solve  this problem rigorous laws must be made, so that all the governments of  the world will be the protectors thereof.    In the Bolshevistic principles equality is effected through force. The  masses who are opposed to the people of rank and to the wealthy class  desire to partake of their advantages.    But in the divine teachings equality is brought about through a ready  willingness to share. It is commanded as regards wealth that the rich  among the people, and the aristocrats should, by their own free will and  for the sake of their own happiness, concern themselves with and care for  the poor. This equality is the result of the lofty characteristics and  noble attributes of mankind.            THE CRITERIONS OF TRUTH      During my visit to London and Paris last year(7) I had many talks with the  materialistic philosophers of Europe. The basis of all their conclusions  is that the acquisition of knowledge of phenomena is according to a fixed,  invariable law,--a law mathematically exact in its operation through the  senses. For instance, the eye sees a chair; therefore there is no doubt of  the chair's existence. The eye looks up into the heavens and beholds the  sun; I see flowers upon this table; I smell their fragrance; I hear sounds  outside, etc., etc. This, they say, is a fixed mathematical law of  perception and deduction, the operation of which admits of no doubt  whatever; for inasmuch as the universe is subject to our sensing, the  proof is self-evident that our knowledge of it must be gained through the  avenues of the senses. That is to say, the materialists announce that the  criterion and standard of human knowledge is sense perception. Among the  Greeks and Romans the criterion of knowledge was reason; that whatever is  provable and acceptable by reason must necessarily be admitted as true. A  third standard or criterion is the opinion held by theologians that  traditions or prophetic statement and interpretations constitute the basis  of human knowing. There is still another, a fourth criterion upheld by  religionists and metaphysicians who say that the source and channel of all  human penetration into the unknown is through inspiration. Briefly then,  these four criterions according to the declarations of men are:  First--Sense Perception; Second--Reason; Third--Traditions;  Fourth--Inspiration.    In Europe I told the philosophers and scientists of materialism that the  criterion of the senses is not reliable. For instance, consider a mirror  and the images reflected in it. These images have no actual corporeal  existence. Yet if you had never seen a mirror you would firmly insist and  believe that they were real. The eye sees a mirage upon the desert as a  lake of water but there is no reality in it. As we stand upon the deck of  a steamer the shore appears to be moving, yet we know the land is  stationary and we are moving. The earth was believed to be fixed and the  sun revolving about it but although this appears to be so, the reverse is  now known to be true. A whirling torch makes a circle of fire appear  before the eye, yet we realize there is but one point of light. We behold  a shadow moving upon the ground but it has no material existence, no  substance. In deserts the atmospheric effects are particularly productive  of illusions which deceive the eye. Once I saw a mirage in which a whole  caravan appeared traveling upward into the sky. In the far north other  deceptive phenomena appear and baffle human vision. Sometimes three or  four suns called by scientists \"mock suns\" will be shining at the same  time whereas we know the great solar orb is one and that it remains fixed  and single. In brief, the senses are continually deceived and we are  unable to separate that which is reality from that which is not.    As to the second criterion--reason--this likewise is unreliable and not to  be depended upon. This human world is an ocean of varying opinions. If  reason is the perfect standard and criterion of knowledge, why are  opinions at variance and why do philosophers disagree so completely with  each other? This is a clear proof that human reason is not to be relied  upon as an infallible criterion. For instance, great discoveries and  announcements of former centuries are continually upset and discarded by  the wise men of today. Mathematicians, astronomers, chemical scientists  continually disprove and reject the conclusions of the ancients; nothing  is fixed, nothing final; everything continually changing because human  reason is progressing along new roads of investigation and arriving at new  conclusions every day. In the future much that is announced and accepted  as true now will be rejected and disproved. And so it will continue ad  infinitum.    When we consider the third criterion--traditions--upheld by theologians as  the avenue and standard of knowledge, we find this source equally  unreliable and unworthy of dependence. For religious traditions are the  report and record of understanding and interpretation of the Book. By what  means has this understanding, this interpretation been reached? By the  analysis of human reason. When we read the Book of God the faculty of  comprehension by which we form conclusions is reason. Reason is mind. If  we are not endowed with perfect reason, how can we comprehend the meanings  of the Word of God? Therefore human reason, as already pointed out, is by  its very nature finite and faulty in conclusions. It cannot surround the  Reality Itself, the Infinite Word. Inasmuch as the source of traditions  and interpretations is human reason, and human reason is faulty, how can  we depend upon its findings for real knowledge?    The fourth criterion I have named is inspiration through which it is  claimed the reality of knowledge is attainable. What is inspiration? It is  the influx of the human heart. But what are satanic promptings which  afflict mankind? They are the influx of the heart also. How shall we  differentiate between them? The question arises, How shall we know whether  we are following inspiration from God or satanic promptings of the human  soul? Briefly, the point is that in the human material world of phenomena  these four are the"]]]
