[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19282"],[0,"The Promised Day Is Come (#10)"],[1," Lord, the  Ancient of Days. We make mention of thee for the sake of God, and desire  that thy name may be exalted through thy remembrance of God, the Creator  of earth and heaven. He, verily, is witness unto that which I say. We have  been informed that thou hast forbidden the trading in slaves, both men and  women. This, verily, is what God hath enjoined in this wondrous  Revelation. God hath, truly, destined a reward for thee, because of this.  He, verily, will pay the doer of good his due recompense, wert thou to  follow what hath been sent unto thee by Him Who is the All-Knowing, the  All-Informed. As to him who turneth aside, and swelleth with pride, after  that the clear tokens have come unto him, from the Revealer of signs, his  work shall God bring to naught. He, in truth, hath power over all things.  Man's actions are acceptable after his having recognized [the  Manifestation]. He that turneth aside from the True One is indeed the most  veiled amongst His creatures. Thus hath it been decreed by Him Who is the  Almighty, the Most Powerful.    \"We have also heard that thou hast entrusted the reins of counsel into the  hands of the representatives of the people. Thou, indeed, hast done well,  for thereby the foundations of the edifice of thine affairs will be  strengthened, and the hearts of all that are beneath thy shadow, whether  high or low, will be tranquilized. It behooveth them, however, to be  trustworthy among His servants, and to regard themselves as the  representatives of all that dwell on earth. This is what counseleth them,  in this Tablet, He Who is the Ruler, the All-Wise.... Blessed is he that  entereth the assembly for the sake of God, and judgeth between men with  pure justice. He, indeed, is of the blissful....    \"Turn thou unto God and say: O my Sovereign Lord! I am but a vassal of  Thine, and Thou art, in truth, the King of kings. I have lifted my  suppliant hands unto the heaven of Thy grace and Thy bounties. Send down,  then, upon me from the clouds of Thy generosity that which will rid me of  all save Thee, and draw me nigh unto Thyself. I beseech Thee, O my Lord,  by Thy name, which Thou hast made the king of names and the manifestation  of Thyself to all who are in heaven and on earth, to rend asunder the  veils that have intervened between me and my recognition of the  Dawning-Place of Thy signs and the Dayspring of Thy Revelation. Thou art,  verily, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, the All-Bounteous. Deprive me not,  O my Lord, of the fragrances of the Robe of Thy mercy in Thy days, and  write down for me that which Thou hast written down for Thy handmaidens  who have believed in Thee and in Thy signs, and have recognized Thee, and  set their hearts towards the horizon of Thy Cause. Thou art truly the Lord  of the worlds and of those who show mercy the Most Merciful. Assist me,  then, O my God, to remember Thee amongst Thy handmaidens, and to aid Thy  Cause in Thy lands. Accept, then, that which hath escaped me when the  light of Thy countenance shone forth. Thou, indeed, hast power over all  things. Glory be to Thee, O Thou in Whose hand is the kingdom of the  heavens and of the earth.\"    In the Kitab-i-Aqdas, His Most Holy Book, Baha'u'llah thus addresses the  German Emperor, William I: \"Say: O King of Berlin! Give ear unto the Voice  calling from this manifest Temple: Verily, there is none other God but Me,  the Everlasting, the Peerless, the Ancient of Days. Take heed lest pride  debar thee from recognizing the Dayspring of Divine Revelation, lest  earthly desires shut thee out, as by a veil, from the Lord of the Throne  above and of the earth below. Thus counseleth thee the Pen of the Most  High. He, verily, is the Most Gracious, the All-Bountiful. Do thou  remember the one whose power transcended thy power [Napoleon III], and  whose station excelled thy station. Where is he? Whither are gone the  things he possessed? Take warning, and be not of them that are fast  asleep. He it was who cast the Tablet of God behind him, when We made  known unto him what the hosts of tyranny had caused Us to suffer.  Wherefore, disgrace assailed him from all sides, and he went down to dust  in great loss. Think deeply, O King, concerning him, and concerning them  who, like unto thee, have conquered cities and ruled over men. The  All-Merciful brought them down from their palaces to their graves. Be  warned, be of them who reflect.\"    And further, in that same Book, this remarkable prophecy: \"O banks of the  Rhine! We have seen you covered with gore, inasmuch as the swords of  retribution were drawn against you; and you shall have another turn. And  We hear the lamentations of Berlin, though she be today in conspicuous  glory.\"    Again in the Kitab-i-Aqdas these words, directed to Emperor Francis  Joseph, are recorded: \"O Emperor of Austria! He who is the Dayspring of  God's Light dwelt in the prison of Akka, at the time when thou didst set  forth to visit the Aqsa Mosque [Jerusalem]. Thou passed Him by, and  inquired not about Him, by Whom every house is exalted, and every lofty  gate unlocked. We, verily, made it [Jerusalem] a place whereunto the world  should turn, that they might remember Me, and yet thou hast rejected Him  Who is the Object of this remembrance, when He appeared with the Kingdom  of God, thy Lord and the Lord of the worlds. We have been with thee at all  times, and found thee clinging unto the Branch and heedless of the Root.  Thy Lord, verily, is a witness unto what I say. We grieved to see thee  circle round Our Name, whilst unaware of Us, though We were before thy  face. Open thine eyes, that thou mayest behold this glorious Vision, and  recognize Him Whom thou invokest in the daytime and in the night season,  and gaze on the Light that shineth above this luminous Horizon.\"    In the Suriy-i-Muluk Sultan 'Abdu'l-'Aziz is addressed in the following  terms: \"Hearken, O king, to the speech of Him that speaketh the truth, Him  that doth not ask thee to recompense Him with the things God hath chosen  to bestow upon thee, Him Who unerringly treadeth the straight Path. He it  is Who summoneth thee unto God, thy Lord, Who showeth thee the right  course, the way that leadeth to true felicity, that haply thou mayest be  of them with whom it shall be well.... He that giveth up himself wholly to  God, God shall, assuredly, be with him; and he that placeth his complete  trust in God, God shall, verily, protect him from whatsoever may harm him,  and shield him from the wickedness of every evil plotter.    \"Wert thou to incline thine ear unto My speech and observe My counsel, God  would exalt thee to so eminent a position that the designs of no man on  the whole earth could ever touch or hurt thee. Observe, O king, with thine  inmost heart and with thy whole being, the precepts of God, and walk not  in the paths of the oppressor. Seize thou, and hold firmly within the  grasp of thy might, the reins of the affairs of thy people, and examine in  person whatever pertaineth unto them. Let nothing escape thee, for therein  lieth the highest good.    \"Render thanks unto God for having chosen thee out of the whole world, and  made thee king over them that profess thy faith. It well beseemeth thee to  appreciate the wondrous favors with which God hath favored thee, and to  magnify continually His name. Thou canst best praise Him if thou lovest  His loved ones, and dost safeguard and protect His servants from the  mischief of the treacherous, that none may any longer oppress them. Thou  shouldst, moreover, arise to enforce the law of God amongst them, that  thou mayest be of those who are firmly established in His law.    \"Shouldst thou cause rivers of justice to spread their waters amongst thy  subjects, God would surely aid thee with the hosts of the unseen and of  the seen, and would strengthen thee in thine affairs. No God is there but  Him. All creation and its empire are His. Unto Him return the works of the  faithful.    \"Place not thy reliance on thy treasures. Put thy whole confidence in the  grace of God, thy Lord. Let Him be thy trust in whatever thou doest, and  be of them that have submitted themselves to His Will. Let Him be thy  helper and enrich thyself with His treasures, for with Him are the  treasuries of the heavens and of the earth. He bestoweth them upon whom He  will, and from whom He will He withholdeth them. There is none other God  but Him, the All-Possessing, the All-Praised. All are but paupers at the  door of His mercy; all are helpless before the revelation of His  sovereignty, and beseech His favors.    \"Overstep not the bounds of moderation, and deal justly with them that  serve thee. Bestow upon them according to their needs, and not to the  extent that will enable them to lay up riches for themselves, to deck  their persons, to embellish their homes, to acquire the things that are of  no benefit unto them, and to be numbered with the extravagant. Deal with  them with undeviating justice, so that none among them may either suffer  want, or be pampered with luxuries. This is but manifest justice. Allow  not the abject to rule over and dominate them who are noble and worthy of  honor, and suffer not the high-minded to be at the mercy of the  contemptible and worthless, for this is what We observed upon Our arrival  in the City [Constantinople], and to it We bear witness....    \"Set before thine eyes God's unerring Balance and, as one standing in His  Presence, weigh in that balance thine actions every day, every moment of  thy life. Bring thyself to account ere thou art summoned to a reckoning,  on the Day when no man shall have strength to stand for fear of God, the  Day when the hearts of the heedless ones shall be made to tremble....    \"Thou art God's shadow on earth. Strive, therefore, to act in such a  manner as befitteth so eminent, so august a station. If thou dost depart  from following the things We have caused to descend upon thee and taught "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19284"],[0,"Paris Talks (#10)"],[1,"towards Him. May  you one and all approach to the threshold of unity, and enter into the  Kingdom. May each of you be like unto a flaming torch, lighted and burning  bright with the fire of the Love of God.          BAHA'U'LLAH      November 7th    'Abdu'l-Baha said:    I will speak to you today of Baha'u'llah. In the third year after the Bab  had declared his Mission, Baha'u'llah, being accused by fanatical Mullas  of believing in the new doctrine, was arrested and thrown into prison. The  next day, however, several ministers of the Government and other  influential men caused him to be set free. Later on he was again arrested,  and the priests condemned him to death! The Governor hesitated to have  this sentence carried out for fear of a revolution. The priests met  together in the Mosque, before which was the place of execution. All the  people of the town gathered in crowds outside the Mosque. The carpenters  brought their saws and hammers, the butchers came with their knives, the  bricklayers and builders shouldered their spades, all these men, incited  by the frenzied Mullas, were eager to share in the honour of killing Him.  Inside the Mosque were assembled the doctors of religion. Baha'u'llah  stood before them, and answered all their questions with great wisdom. The  chief sage in particular, was completely silenced by Baha'u'llah, who  refuted all his arguments.    A discussion arose between two of these priests as to the meaning of some  words in the writings of the Bab; accusing Him of inaccuracy, they  challenged Baha'u'llah to defend Him if He were able. These priests were  entirely humiliated, for Baha'u'llah proved before the whole assembly that  the Bab was absolutely right, and that the accusation was made in  ignorance.    The defeated ones now put Him to the torture of the bastinado, and more  infuriated than before brought Him out before the walls of the Mosque unto  the place of execution, where the misguided people were awaiting His  coming.    Still the Governor feared to comply with the demand of the priests for His  execution. Realizing the danger in which the dignified prisoner was  placed, some men were sent to rescue Him. In this they succeeded by  breaking through the wall of the Mosque and leading Baha'u'llah through  the opening into a place of safety, but not of freedom; for the Governor  shifted the responsibility from off his own shoulders by sending him to  Tihran. Here He was imprisoned in an underground dungeon, where the light  of day was never seen. A heavy chain was placed about his neck by which He  was chained to five other Babis; these fetters were locked together by  strong, very heavy bolts, and screws. His clothes were torn to pieces,  also His fez. In this terrible condition He was kept for four months.    During this time none of His friends were able to get access to Him.    A prison official made an attempt to poison Him but, beyond causing Him  great suffering, this poison had no effect.    After a time the Government liberated Him and exiled Him and His family to  Ba_gh_dad, where He remained for eleven years. During this time He  underwent severe persecutions, being surrounded by the watchful hatred of  His enemies.    He bore all evils and torments with the greatest courage and fortitude.  Often when He arose in the morning, He knew not whether He would live  until the sun should set. Meanwhile, each day, the priests came and  questioned Him on religion and metaphysics.    At length the Turkish Governor exiled Him to Constantinople, whence He was  sent to Adrianople; here He stayed for five years. Eventually, He was sent  to the far off prison fortress of St. Jean d'Acre. Here He was imprisoned  in the military portion of the fortress and kept under the strictest  surveillance. Words would fail me to tell you of the many trials He had to  suffer, and all the misery He endured in that prison. Notwithstanding, it  was from this prison that Baha'u'llah wrote to all the Monarchs of Europe,  and these letters with one exception were sent through the post.    The Epistle of Nasiri'd-Din _Sh_ah was confided to a Persian Baha'i, Mirza  Badi _Kh_urasani, who undertook to deliver it into the _Sh_ah's own hands.  This brave man waited in the neighbourhood of Tihran for the passing of  the _Sh_ah, who had the intention to journey by that way to his Summer  Palace. The courageous messenger followed the _Sh_ah to his Palace, and  waited on the road near the entrance for several days. Always in the same  place was he seen waiting on the road, until the people began to wonder  why he should be there. At last the _Sh_ah heard of him, and commanded his  servants that the man should be brought before him.    'Oh! servants of the _Sh_ah, I bring a letter, which I must deliver into  his own hands', Badi said, and then Badi said to the _Sh_ah, 'I bring you  a letter from Baha'u'llah!'    He was immediately seized and questioned by those who wished to elicit  information which would help them in the further persecutions of  Baha'u'llah. Badi would not answer a word; then they tortured him, still  he held his peace! After three days they killed him, having failed to  force him to speak! These cruel men photographed him whilst he was under  torture.(7)    The _Sh_ah gave the letter from Baha'u'llah to the priests that they might  explain it to him. After some days these priests told the _Sh_ah that the  letter was from a political enemy. The _Sh_ah grew angry and said, 'This  is no explanation. I pay you to read and answer my letters, therefore  obey!'    The spirit and meaning of the Tablet to Nasiri'd-Din _Sh_ah was, in short,  this: 'Now that the time has come, when the Cause of the Glory of God has  appeared, I ask that I may be allowed to come to Tihran and answer any  questions the priests may put to Me.    'I exhort you to detach yourself from the worldly magnificence of your  Empire. Remember all those great kings who have lived before you--their  glories have passed away!'    The letter was written in a most beautiful manner, and continued warning  the King and telling him of the future triumph of the Kingdom of  Baha'u'llah, both in the Eastern and in the Western World.    The _Sh_ah paid no attention to the warning of this letter and continued  to live in the same fashion until the end.    Although Baha'u'llah was in prison the great Power of the Holy Spirit was  with Him!    None other in prison could have been like unto Him. In spite of all the  hardships He suffered, He never complained.    In the dignity of His Majesty, He always refused to see the Governor, or  the influential people of the town.    Although the surveillance was unremittingly strict He came and went as He  wished! He died in a house situated about three kilometers from St. Jean  d'Acre.          GOOD IDEAS MUST BE CARRIED INTO ACTION      November 8th    All over the world one hears beautiful sayings extolled and noble precepts  admired. All men say they love what is good, and hate everything that is  evil! Sincerity is to be admired, whilst lying is despicable. Faith is a  virtue, and treachery is a disgrace to humanity. It is a blessed thing to  gladden the hearts of men, and wrong to be the cause of pain. To be kind  and merciful is right, while to hate is sinful. Justice is a noble quality  and injustice an iniquity. That it is one's duty to be pitiful and harm no  one, and to avoid jealousy and malice at all costs. Wisdom is the glory of  man, not ignorance; light, not darkness! It is a good thing to turn one's  face toward God, and foolishness to ignore Him. That it is our duty to  guide man upward, and not to mislead him and be the cause of his downfall.  There are many more examples like unto these.    But all these sayings are but words and we see very few of them carried  into the world of action. On the contrary, we perceive that men are  carried away by passion and selfishness, each man thinking only of what  will benefit himself even if it means the ruin of his brother. They are  all anxious to make their fortune and care little or nothing for the  welfare of others. They are concerned about their own peace and comfort,  while the condition of their fellows troubles them not at all.    Unhappily this is the road most men tread.    But Baha'is must not be thus; they must rise above this condition. Actions  must be more to them than words. By their actions they must be merciful  and not merely by their words. They must on all occasions confirm by their  actions what they proclaim in words. Their deeds must prove their  fidelity, and their actions must show forth Divine light.    Let your actions cry aloud to the world that you are indeed Baha'is, for  it is actions that speak to the world and are the cause of the progress of  humanity.    If we are true Baha'is speech is not needed. Our actions will help on the  world, will spread civilization, will help the progress of science, and  cause the arts to develop. Without action nothing in the material world  can be accomplished, neither can words unaided advance a man in the  spiritual Kingdom. It is not through lip-service only that the elect of  God have attained to holiness, but by patient lives of active service they  have brought light into the world.    Therefore strive that your actions day by day may be beautiful prayers.  Turn towards God, and seek always to do that which is right and noble.  Enrich the poor, raise the fallen, comfort the sorrowful, bring healing to  the sick, reassure the fearful, rescue the oppressed, bring hope to the  hopeless, shelter the destitute!    This is the work of a true Baha'i, and this is what is expected of him. If  we strive to do all this, then are we true Baha'is, but if we neglect it,  we are not followers of the Light, and we have no right to the name.    God, who sees all hearts, knows how far our lives are the fulfilment of  our words.          THE TRUE MEANING OF BAPTISM BY WATER AND"]]]
