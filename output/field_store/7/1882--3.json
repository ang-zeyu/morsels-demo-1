Thus these Northern Syrians became by degrees assimilated to the people  of Babylon and Nineveh, much as the inhabitants of a remote province  nowadays adapt their dress, their architecture, their implements of  husbandry and handicraft, their military equipment and organisation, to  the fashions of the capital.*         * One can judge of their social condition from the       enumeration of the objects which formed their tribute, or       the spoil which the Assyrian kings carried off from their       country.

Their armies were modelled on similar lines, and consisted of archers,  plkemen, slingers, and those troops of horsemen which accompanied the  chariotry on flying raids; the chariots, moreover, closely followed the  Assyrian type, even down to the padded bar with embroidered hangings  which connected the body of the chariot with the end of the pole.

The Syrian princes did not adopt the tiara, but they wore the long  fringed robe, confined by a girdle at the waist, and their mode of life,  with its ceremonies, duties, and recreations, differed little from that  prevailing in the palaces of Calah or Babylon. They hunted big game,  including the lion, according to the laws of the chase recognised at  Nineveh, priding themselves as much on their exploits in hunting, as on  their triumphs in war.    [Illustration: 056.jpg A KING OF THE KHATI HUNTING A LION IN HIS  CHARIOT]         Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by Hogarth, published in       the _Recueil de Travaux_.    Their religion was derived from the common source which underlay all  Semitic religions, but a considerable number of Babylonian deities were  also worshipped; these had been introduced in some cases without any  modification, whilst in others they had been assimilated to more ancient  gods bearing similar characteristics: at Nerab, among the Patina, Nusku  and his female companion Nikal, both of Chaldaean origin, claimed the  homage of the faithful, to the disparagement of Shahr the moon and  Shamash the sun. Local cults often centred round obscure deities held  in little account by the dominant races; thus Samalla reverenced Uru the  light, Bekubel the wind, the chariot of El, not to mention El himself,  Besheph, Hadad, and the Cabin, the servants of Besheph.    [Illustration: 057.jpg THE GOD HADAD]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from the photograph in Luschan.    These deities were mostly of the Assyrian type, and if one may draw  any conclusion from the few representations of them already discovered,  their rites must have been celebrated in a manner similar to that  followed in the cities on the Lower Euphrates. Scarcely any signs of  Egyptian influence survived, though here and there a trace of it might  be seen in the figures of calf or bull, the vulture of Mut or the  sparrow-hawk of Horus. Assur-nazir-pal, marching from the banks of the  Khabur to Bit-Adini, and from Bit-Adini passing on to Northern Syria,  might almost have imagined himself still in his own dominions, so  gradual and imperceptible were the changes in language and civilisation  in the country traversed between Nineveh and Assur, Tul-Barsip and  Samalla.    His expedition was unattended by danger or bloodshed. Lubarna, the  reigning prince of the Patina, was possibly at that juncture meditating  the formation of a Syrian empire under his rule. Unki, in which lay his  capital of Kunulua, was one of the richest countries of Asia,* being  well watered by the Afrin, Orontes, and Saluara;** no fields produced  such rich harvests as his, no meadows pastured such cattle or were  better suited to the breeding of war-horses.         * The Unki of the Assyrians, the Uniuqa of the Egyptians, is       the valley of Antioch, the Amk of the present day. Kunulua       or Kinalia, the capital of the Patina, has been identified       with the Gindaros of Greek times; I prefer to identify it       with the existing Tell-Kunana, written for Tell-Kunala by       the common substitution of _n_ for _l_ at the end of proper       names.         ** The Saluara of the Assyrian texts is the present Kara-su,       which flows into the Ak-Deniz, the lake of Antioch.    [Illustration: 058.jpg RELIGIOUS SCENE DISPLAYING EGYPTIAN FEATURES]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from the impression taken from a       Hittite cylinder.    His mountain provinces yielded him wood and minerals, and provided a  reserve of semi-savage woodcutters and herdsmen from which to recruit  his numerous battalions. The neighbouring princes, filled with  uneasiness or jealousy by his good fortune, saw in the Assyrian monarch  a friend and a liberator rather than an enemy. Carchemish opened its  gates and laid at his feet the best of its treasures--twenty talents of  silver, ingots, rings, and daggers of gold, a hundred talents of copper,  two hundred talents of iron, bronze bulls, cups decorated with scenes  in relief or outline, ivory in the tusk or curiously wrought, purple  and embroidered stuffs, and the state carriage of its King Shangara.  The Hittite troops, assembled in haste, joined forces with the Aramaean  auxiliaries, and the united host advanced on Coele-Syria. The scribe  commissioned to record the history of this expedition has taken a  delight in inserting the most minute details. Leaving Carchemish, the  army followed the great caravan route, and winding its way between the  hills of Munzigani and Khamurga, skirting Bit-Agusi, at length arrived  under the walls of Khazazu among the Patina.*         * Khazazu being the present Azaz, the Assyrian army must       have followed the route which still leads from Jerabis to       this town. Mount Munzigani and Khamurga, mentioned between       Carchemish and Akhanu or Iakhanu, must lie between the Sajur       and the Koweik, near Shehab, at the only point on the route       where the road passes between two ranges of lofty hills.    The town having purchased immunity by a present of gold and of finely  woven stuffs, the army proceeded to cross the Aprie, on the bank of  which an entrenched camp was formed for the storage of the spoil.  Lubarna offered no resistance, but nevertheless refused to acknowledge  his inferiority; after some delay, ifc was decided to make a direct  attack on his capital, Kunulua, whither he had retired. The appearance  of the Assyrian vanguard put a speedy end to his ideas of resistance:  prostrating himself before his powerful adversary, he offered hostages,  and emptied his palaces and stables to provide a ransom. This comprised  twenty talents of silver, one talent of gold, a hundred talents of  lead, a hundred talents of iron, a thousand bulls, ten thousand sheep,  daughters of his nobles with befitting changes of garments, and all the  paraphernalia of vessels, jewels, and costly stuffs which formed  the necessary furniture of a princely household. The effect of his  submission on his own vassals and the neighbouring tribes was shown in  different ways. Bit-Agusi at once sent messengers to congratulate the  conqueror, but the mountain provinces awaited the invader's nearer  approach before following its example. Assur-nazir-pal, seeing that they  did not take the initiative, crossed the Orontes, probably at the spot  where the iron bridge now stands, and making his way through the country  between laraku and Iaturi,* reached the banks of the Sangura* without  encountering any difficulty.         * The spot where Assur-nazir-pal must have crossed the       Orontes is determined by the respective positions of Kunulua       and Tell-Kunana. At the iron bridge, the modern traveller       has the choice of two roads: one, passing Antioch and Beit-       el-Ma, leads to Urdeh on the Nahr-el-Kebir; the other       reaches the same point by a direct route over the Gebel       Kosseir. If, as I believe, Assur-nazir-pal took the latter       route, the country and Mount laraku must be the northern       part of Gebel Kosseir in the neighbourhood of Antioch, and       Iaturi, the southern part of the same mountain near Derkush.       laraku is mentioned in the same position by Shalmaneser       III., who reached it after crossing the Orontes, on       descending from the Amanos _en route_ for the country of       Hamath.         ** The Sangura or Sagura has been identified by Delattre       with the Nahr-el-Kebir, not that river which the Greeks       called the Eleutheros, but that which flows into the sea       near Latakia. Before naming the Sangura, the _Annals_       mention a country, whose name, half effaced, ended in _-ku_:       I think we may safely restore this name as [Ashtama]kou,       mentioned by Shalmaneser III. in this region, after the name       of laraku. The country of Ashtamaku would thus be the       present canton of Urdeh, which is traversed before reaching       the banks of the Nahr-el-Kebir.    After a brief halt there in camp, he turned his back on the sea, and  passing between Saratini and Duppani,* took by assault the fortress of  Aribua.** This stronghold commanded all the surrounding country, and was  the seat of a palace which Lubarna at times used as a similar residence.  Here Assur-nazir-pal took up his quarters, and deposited within its  walls the corn and spoils of Lukhuti;*** "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17328"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 8 (of 12) (#10)"],[1,"was not so evident as  to preclude their adversaries also claiming the victory with some show  of truth. In any case, the losses on both sides were so considerable as  to force the two belligerents to suspend operations; they returned each  to his capital, and matters remained much as they had been before the  battle took place.*         * _Pinches' Babylonian Chronicle_ attributes the victory to       the Elamites, and says that the year in which the battle was       fought was unknown. The testimony of this chronicle is so       often marred by partiality, that to prefer it always to that       of the Ninevite inscriptions shows deficiency of critical       ability: the course of events seems to me to prove that the       advantage remained with the Assyrians, though the victory       was not decisive. The date, which necessarily falls between       692 and 689 B.C., has been decided by general considerations       as 691 B.C., the very year in which the _Taylor Cylinder_       was written.    Years might have elapsed before Sennacherib could have ventured to  recommence hostilities: he was not deluded by the exaggerated estimate  of his victory in the accounts given by his court historians, and he  recognised the fact that the issue of the struggle must be uncertain  as long as the alliance subsisted between Elam and Chaldaea. But fortune  came to his aid sooner than he had expected. Umman-minanu was not  absolute in his dominions any more than his predecessors had been,  and the losses he had sustained at Khalule, without obtaining any  compensating advantages in the form of prisoners or spoil, had lowered  him in the estimation of his vassals; Mushezib-marduk, on the other  hand, had emptied his treasuries, and though Karduniash was wealthy,  it was hardly able, after such a short interval, to provide further  subsidies to purchase the assistance of the mountain tribes.  Sennacherib's emissaries kept him well informed of all that occurred  in the enemy's court, and he accordingly took the field again at the  beginning of 689 B.C., and on this occasion circumstances seemed likely  to combine to give him an easy victory.*         * The Assyrian documents insert the account of the capture       of Babylon directly after the battle of Khalule, and modern       historians therefore concluded that the two events took       place within a few months of each other. The information       afforded by _Pinches' Babylonian Chronicle_ has enabled us       to correct this mistake, and to bring down the date of the       taking of Babylon to 689 B.C.    Mushezib-marduk shut himself up in Babylon, not doubting that the  Elamites would hasten to his succour as soon as they should hear of his  distress; but his expectation was not fulfilled. Umman-minanu was struck  down by apoplexy, on the 15th of Nisan, and though his illness did not  at once terminate fatally, he was left paralysed with distorted mouth,  and loss of speech, incapable of action, and almost unfit to govern.  His seizure put a stop to his warlike preparations: and his ministers,  preoccupied with the urgent question of the succession to the throne,  had no desire to provoke a conflict with Assyria, the issue of which  could not be foretold: they therefore left their ally to defend his own  interests as best he might. Babylon, reduced to rely entirely on its  own resources, does not seem to have held out long, and perhaps the  remembrance of the treatment it had received on former occasions may  account for the very slight resistance it now offered. The Assyrian  kings who had from time to time conquered Babylon, had always treated  it with great consideration. They had looked upon it as a sacred city,  whose caprices and outbreaks must always be pardoned; it was only with  infinite precautions that they had imposed their commands upon it, and  even when they had felt that severity was desirable, they had restrained  themselves in using it, and humoured the idiosyncrasies of the  inhabitants. Tiglath-pileser III, Shalmaneser V., and Sargon had all  preferred to be legally crowned as sovereigns of Babylon instead  of remaining merely its masters by right of conquest, and though  Sennacherib had refused compliance with the traditions by which his  predecessors had submitted to be bound, he had behaved with unwonted  lenity after quelling the two previous revolts. He now recognised that  his clemency had been shown in vain, and his small stock of patience was  completely exhausted just when fate threw the rebellious city into his  power. If the inhabitants had expected to be once more let off easily,  their illusions were speedily dissipated: they were slain by the sword  as if they had been ordinary foes, such as Jews, Tibarenians, or Kalda  of Bit-Yakin, and they were spared none of the horrors which custom then  permitted the stronger to inflict upon the weaker. For several days the  pitiless massacre lasted. Young and old, all who fell into the hands of  the soldiery, perished by the sword; piles of corpses filled the streets  and the approaches to the temples, especially the avenue of winged bulls  which led to E-sagilla, and, even after the first fury of carnage had  been appeased, it was only to be succeeded by more organised pillage.  Mushezib-marduk was sent into exile with his family, and immense convoys  of prisoners and spoil followed him. The treasures carried off from  the royal palace, the temples, and the houses of the rich nobles were  divided among the conquerors: they comprised gold, silver, precious  stones, costly stuffs, and provisions of all sorts. The sacred edifices  were sacked, the images hacked to pieces or carried off to Nineveh:  Bel-Marduk, introduced into the sanctuary of Assur, became subordinate  to the rival deity amid a crowd of strange gods. In the inmost recess  of a chapel were discovered some ancient statues of Kamman and Shala  of E-kallati, which Marduk-nadin-akhe had carried off in the time of  Tiglath-pileser I., and these were brought back in triumph to their own  land, after an absence of four hundred and eighteen years. The buildings  themselves suffered a like fate to that of their owners and their gods.  \"The city and its houses, from foundation to roof, I destroyed them,  I demolished them, I burnt them with fire; walls, gateways, sacred  chapels, and the towers of earth and tiles, I laid them all low and cast  them into the Arakhtu.\" The incessant revolts of the people justified  this wholesale destruction. Babylon, as we have said before, was too  powerful to be reduced for long to the second rank in a Mesopotamian  empire: as soon as fate established the seat of empire in the districts  bordering on the Euphrates and the middle course of the Tigris,  its well-chosen situation, its size, its riches, the extent of its  population, the number of its temples, and the beauty of its palaces,  all conspired to make it the capital of the country. In vain Assur,  Calah, or Nineveh thrust themselves into the foremost rank, and by a  strenuous effort made their princes rulers of Babylon; in a short time  Babylon replenished her treasury, found allies, soldiers, and leaders,  and in spite of reverses of fortune soon regained the upper hand. The  only treatment which could effectually destroy her ascendency was that  of leaving in her not one brick upon another, thus preventing her from  being re-peopled for several generations, since a new city could not  at once spring up from the ashes of the old; until she had been utterly  destroyed her conquerors had still reason to fear her. This fact  Sennacherib, or his councillors, knew well. If he merits any reproach,  it is not for having seized the opportunity of destroying the city which  Babylon offered him, but rather for not having persevered in his design  to the end, and reduced her to a mere name.    In the midst of these costly and absorbing wars, we may well wonder how  Sennacherib found time and means to build villas or temples; yet he is  nevertheless, among the kings of Assyria, the monarch who has left us  the largest number of monuments. He restored a shrine of Nergal in the  small town of Tarbizi; he fortified the village of Alshi; and in 704  B.C. he founded a royal residence in the fortress of Kakzi, which  defended the approach to Calah from the south-east. He did not reside  much at Dur-Sharrukin, neither did he complete the decoration of his  father's palace there: his pride as a victorious warrior suffered  when his surroundings reminded him of a more successful conqueror than  himself, and Calah itself was too full of memories of Tiglath-pileser  III. and the sovereigns of the eighth century for him to desire to  establish his court there. He preferred to reside at Nineveh, which  had been much neglected by his predecessors, and where the crumbling  edifices merely recalled the memory of long-vanished splendours.    [Illustration: 063.jpg THE MOUNDS OF NINEVEH SEEN FROM THE TERRACE OF A  HOUSE IN MOSUL]         Drawn by Boudier, from a lithograph in Layard.    He selected this city as his residence at the very beginning of his  reign, perhaps while he was still only crown prince, and began by  repairing its ancient fortifications; later on, when the success of  his earlier campaigns had furnished him with a sufficient supply of  prisoners, he undertook the restoration of the whole city, with its  avenues, streets, canals, quays, gardens, and aqueducts: the labour of  all the captives brought together from different quarters of his empire  was pressed into the execution of his plans--the Kalda, the Aramaeans,  the Mannai, the people of Kui, the Cilicians, the Philistines, and  the iyrians; the provinces vied with each other in furnishing him with  materials without stint,--precious woods were procured from Syria,  marbles from Kapri-dargila, alabaster from Balad, while Bit-Yakin  provided the rushes to be laid between the courses of brickwork."]]]
