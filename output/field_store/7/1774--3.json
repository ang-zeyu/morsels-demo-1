She sat up beside her mother and looked at the minister  almost all the time; but sometimes she had to wink hard to keep awake.  When she thought she could not let her feet hang down another minute,  she would slip down to the footstool to rest.    Elizabeth was often ashamed of Hope, who could not sit still ten  minutes. She tried to listen to the sermon, but could not. When she  began to stir about a little, her mother shook her head at her. She sat  still for a few minutes, but was soon restless again.    Presently she began to be sleepy and laid her head upon her father's arm  for a nap. Just then she felt something in his pocket. A happy smile  came over Hope's face; she was wide-awake now. Slipping her hand into  the wide pocket, she drew out Mary Ellen and smoothed her wrinkled gown.    Master Brown's thoughts were all on the sermon, and even Mistress Brown  did not notice Hope for a little time. When she did, what do you suppose  she saw? Hope was standing on the seat showing her doll to the little  girl in the pew behind her.    Oh, how ashamed her mother was! She pulled her little daughter down  quickly and whispered, \"Do you want the tithingman to come? Well, sit  down and listen.\" Taking Mary Ellen, she slipped the doll into her muff.    Little Hope did sit down and listen. She did not even turn around when  the kind lady behind them dropped a peppermint over the high-backed pew  for her. She was very much afraid of the tithingman, who sat on a high  seat. He had a long rod with a hard knob on one end and a squirrel's  tail on the other.    [Illustration: The tithingman tickling the nodding lady]    When he saw a lady nodding during the sermon, he stepped around to her  pew and tickled her face with the fur end of the rod. She would waken  with a start and be, oh! so ashamed. She would be very glad the pew had  such high sides to hide her blushing face.    Perhaps you think the boys who sat on the other side of the church had a  good time. But there was the tithingman again. When he saw a boy  whispering or playing, he rapped him on the head with the knob end of  the rod. The whispering would stop at once, for the rod often brought  tears and left a headache.    Besides keeping the boys from playing and the grown people from going to  sleep, the tithingman must turn the hourglass. In those days very few  people could afford clocks, but every one had an hourglass. It took the  fine sand just one hour to pour from the upper part of the glass into  the lower part.    When the sand had all run through, the tithingman turned the glass over  and the sand began to tell another hour. The glass was always turned  three times before the minister closed the service. Then the men picked  up their muskets and foot stoves, the women wrapped their long capes  closely about them, and all went home.    At sunset the Puritan Sabbath ended. The women brought out their  knitting and spinning, or prepared for Monday's washing, and the  children were free to play until bedtime.    --MARGARET PUMPHREY.          NAHUM PRINCE      More than a hundred years ago, our country was at war with England.  George Washington was at the head of our army. As you know, he and his  men were fighting for our country's freedom.    The English army was larger than our army, and General Washington needed  all the men he could get. The regular troops were with him.    In one little town in Vermont all the strong, able-bodied men had gone  to the front. News came that the English and the Americans were about to  meet in battle. The Americans needed more men and called for volunteers.  Old men with white hair and long beards volunteered. Young boys with  smooth cheeks and unshaven lips volunteered. There wasn't a boy in the  village over thirteen years of age who didn't volunteer.    Even lame Nahum Prince offered himself. He brought out his grandfather's  old gun and got in line with the others. He stood as straight and tall  as he could--as a soldier should stand.    Soon the captain came along the line to inspect the volunteers. When he  saw Nahum, he said, \"No, no, Nahum, you cannot go; you know you cannot.  Why, you could not walk a mile. Go home, my lad.\"    Just then the good old minister came by. \"Yes, Nahum,\" he said, \"you  must stay at home. Who knows but that you will find a greater work to do  for your country right here?\"    And lame Nahum dropped out of the line.    Then the volunteers marched off, every man and boy in the village except  Nahum Prince. Poor Nahum! His heart was heavy.    \"What can I do for my country in this small village?\" he said to  himself. \"Oh, I wish I could be a soldier!\"    He walked toward his home slowly and sadly. Just as he passed the  blacksmith shop, three horseman galloped up to the door.    [Illustration: The horseman speaks to Nahum]    \"Where is the blacksmith?\" asked one.    \"He and all the men and boys have gone to join the army,\" said Nahum.  \"There isn't a man or a boy in town except me. I wouldn't be here if I  were not lame.\"    \"We cannot have this horse shod,\" said the rider to the others. \"We  shall not reach there in time.\"    \"Why, I can set a shoe,\" said Nahum.    \"Then it is lucky you are left behind,\" said the man. \"Light up the  forge and set the shoe.\"    Nahum lighted the fire, blew the coals with the bellows, and soon put on  the shoe.    \"You have done a great deed to-day, my boy,\" said the rider as he  thanked Nahum and rode away.    The next week the boys came home and told of a great battle. They told  how the Americans were about to lose the fight when Colonel Seth Warner,  leading a band of soldiers, rode up just in time to save the day.    Nahum said nothing, but he knew that Colonel Warner would not have  arrived in time if he had not set that shoe. And it was really Nahum  Prince and Colonel Seth Warner who won the victory of Bennington.          THE LITTLE COOK'S REWARD      Betty lived a long, long time ago on a farm in North Carolina. She knew  how to clean up the house, to wash the dishes, to sew, and to cook. She  knew how to knit, and to spin and weave, too.    One day Betty's father said, \"Let us go to town to-morrow. President  Washington is passing through the South, and a man told me to-day that  he will be in Salisbury to-morrow.\"    \"Yes,\" said Betty's brother Robert, \"and our company has been asked to  march in the parade. One of the boys is going to make a speech of  welcome.\"    \"I should like to go,\" said their mother, \"but I can't leave home.\"    \"Oh, yes, you can, mother,\" said Betty. \"I have stayed here by myself  many times, and I can stay to-morrow. You go with father, and I will  take care of things.\"    The next morning every one on the place was up before the sun. Robert  was so impatient to start to town that he could scarcely eat any  breakfast. Mother was so excited that she forgot to put coffee in the  coffee pot.    At last every one had left, and Betty was alone. \"I wish I could see the  President,\" she said, \"and I do wish I could see his great coach. Father  says that it is finer than the Governor's. Four men ride in front of it,  and four behind it. The servants are dressed in white and gold. How I  wish I could see it all!\"    While Betty was talking to herself, she was not idle. She washed the  dishes and she cleaned the house. Then, as it was not time to get  dinner, she sat down on the shady porch.    \"I wonder whether General Washington looks like his picture,\" she said.  \"Oh, if I could only see him!\"    But what sound was that? Betty stood up, and shading her eyes with her  hands, looked down the road. Four horsemen came along at a gallop. Then  there followed a great white coach, trimmed with gold and drawn by four  white horses. There were four horsemen behind the coach, and last of all  came several black servants.    [Illustration: Betty looking up at the great coach]    All stopped at the gate. A tall handsome man stepped from the coach and  came up the walk. Betty felt as if she could neither move nor speak. She  remembered, however, all that her mother had taught her, and she made a  low curtsy as the gentleman reached the steps.    \"Good morning, my little maid,\" he said. \"I know it is late, but would  you give an old man some breakfast?\"    Betty's cheeks grew as pink as the rose by the porch. She made another  curtsy and said, \"Indeed, I will. I am the only one at home, for father,  mother, and Robert have gone to Salisbury to see the great Washington.  But I am sure I can give you some breakfast. Father says that I am a  good cook.\"    \"I know you are, and that you are as brisk as you are pretty. Just give  me a breakfast, and I promise you that you shall see Washington before  your father, mother, or brother Robert does.\"    \"I will do the best I can, sir,\" Betty said.    The other men came in, and all sat on the porch and talked while Betty  worked. Getting her mother's whitest cloth and the silver that came from  England, she quickly set the table. She brought out a loaf of new bread  and a jar of fresh honey. Then she ran to the spring house and got  yellow butter and rich milk. She had some fresh eggs that had been laid  by her own hens. These she dropped into boiling water. Last of all she  cut thin slices of delicious ham.    When everything was ready, Betty went to the porch and invited the  strangers in. Her cheeks were now the color of the red rose by the gate.    The visitors ate heartily of all the good things Betty had prepared. As  the tall, handsome gentleman rose to go, he leaned over and kissed her.  \"My pretty little cook,\" he said, \"you may tell your brother Robert that  you saw Washington before he did, and that he kissed you, too.\"    You may believe that Betty did tell it. She told it to her children, and  they told it to their children, and I am telling it to you to-day.    --MRS.

I tried to explain to her, but she would not listen to  me and we were on the verge of quarreling but as usual, when there was a  difference of opinion between any of us, we always appealed to our old  lady and she agreed with me that there was no sin in shaking hands.  'Sin,' she said, 'comes from thoughts--if while talking or laughing or  even shaking hands, evil thoughts pass through the minds of men or women  then, and then only, is the act likely to be a sin. In Europe,' she went  on to say, 'it is quite a natural thing for men and women to shake hands  and talk to each other naturally.'    \"Then I asked my new friend Huldah (a young wife of fifteen years of  age) to tell us all about her own love-affair and marriage. She was  greatly shocked to hear me speaking of love _before_ marriage--'Such a  thing could never happen to a modest Jewish maiden in those days,' she  said.    \"I told her that it did happen in Europe. 'May be,' she replied; 'it may  happen in lands where Jews mix with non-Jews and copy their ways!'    \"As I rather liked to tease her, I said she was mistaken, for here in  Jerusalem did the great Rabbi Akiba fall in love with his wife before  marriage. 'Oh, that was quite different!' she replied. 'Not at all,'  said I, for were not feasts and rejoicing held so that youths and  maidens could meet one another in the vineyards and dance in the  meadows?--Look in the Bible,' I continued, 'and you will see it is  mentioned there.' Then all looked abashed. The only one who smiled was  our old lady.    \"'Don't unsettle their minds, dear,' she whispered softly to me. 'I  don't want to,' I said; 'I only want to show them that, though such  things are done in other countries, there is no sin in it as they have  been brought up to believe.' 'Well, well!' she said, 'let us hope God  will restore our beloved land to us in his own good time, and then we  shall again, as in days of old, celebrate such Festivals!'    \"We all said 'AMEN,' most heartily, to this wish.    \"In my next letter I will tell you of our friend's engagement and  marriage. Your loving cousin, Millie.\"          ENGAGEMENT AND WEDDING CEREMONIES      The hearers waited with eagerness for the next Friday evening, as they  enjoyed so much hearing those interesting letters.    The next Mr Jacobs read was this:    \"Hulda is only fifteen years of age, and has already been married six  months. If she were dressed as girls are dressed in England, she would  really look beautiful; but her beauty is, I think, marred by the silk  handkerchief she wears on her head, which covers half her forehead and  her ears, so that none of her hair can be seen, I mean that part of it  that was shaved off. Over the silk handkerchief she wears a black velvet  band, to which gold coins are attached and these are put on so  coquettishly that it makes the head-gear look quite artistic. Sometimes  she wears ornaments with pearls in them. These special trinkets are, of  course, worn only on Sabbaths and Festivals or some other special  occasions.    \"The shaving of part of the young wife's head the day after her marriage  is a custom to prevent young married women from being tempted by vanity  to show off their hair, which is generally in Palestine very beautiful.  The poor things cover up the part so well that there is no fear of any  of it being seen.    \"Hulda is tall and well-developed for her age, and lively as a cricket,  always ready to play and laugh and joke with us. She started by telling  me: 'I was invited to visit my betrothed's family during the holidays,  and my future mother-in-law let me help her with the baking and cooking,  and was specially pleased with the way I stretched out the dough for the  lockshen--I made it look so thin, like a paper wrapper. She told me that  I would make a good housewife. Then I showed all the family some of the  linen garments I had made and had with me, and the crochet I had trimmed  them with.'    \"Here Hulda turned to me and said: 'our mothers encourage us at eight  years of age to begin to make garments for our trousseaux, and at the  age of ten we start to crochet lace and embroider, so by the time we get  married we have all our things ready, for they cannot be bought  ready-made in Palestine. When we become betrothed we work our future  initials on our things and make our dresses.'    \"'While I was staying at my betrothed's home, we never spoke to each  other, except to say Good-morning and Good-night. Sometimes when no one  saw us we looked at one another, for already I liked my young man,  though he was not handsome. A wise girl does not want good looks in a  husband so much as that he should be a good Talmudist and be a good  character; this he is, and I could listen to him for ever,' she said,  blushing like a rose; 'when he sings Zmires, his voice is like a  nightingale, and even in the mornings, when he thinks I am asleep, it is  just lovely to hear his sing-song as he studies--it is to me the  sweetest of all music,' she said.    \"'So it should be, my child,' said our old lady, 'and it is a privilege  for us women to help them to study.'    \"'So my mother says,' said Hulda, naturally.    \"At the same time I thought to myself: 'A nice thing it would be if only  our men were to study and our women to work, as they mostly do here and  in Russian ghetto towns. No,' I thought, 'I would rather that the men  did some manual labour as well as study, and the women have some time  for study as well as for household work.'    \"But I kept these thoughts to myself, while Hulda continued to tell me  what a longing she had to see more of her betrothed; but she did not see  him again till after the marriage ceremony.    \"I will try to describe the ceremonies to you in detail, as I have now  been to several weddings here, and I think you would like to know.    \"A week before the wedding, all the relations and friends come to help  bake and prepare the wedding-feast; for, as these proceedings last about  eight days, it is no easy matter to celebrate them.    \"The bride's trousseau is shown to the guests who come, and everything  is examined and counted by all, especially the relations of the  bridegrooms. When there happens to be less than expected, woe betide the  bride, for she is always reproached about it by her mother-in-law or his  other relatives.    \"On the Sabbath before the marriage the bridegroom is called up to read  the Law, and friends pay him visits.--First they send him nicely baked  cakes or puddings and a bottle of wine. (It is a good thing that this is  the custom, or else a poor man would be ruined by the cost of all the  feasting that he is expected to provide).    \"During the week the bride's friends come every evening and dance and  sing in her home, coffee and cakes and baked nuts being handed round.    \"The morning of the wedding, both bride and bridegroom fast, and each  goes with his or her parents to the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem, to pray  for a blessing on their married life, and then they go to be blessed by  the Rav.    \"When the bride returns home, she is dressed in her bridal dress. Then  she is led up to a chair that has been raised off the floor; her hair is  unloosed and allowed to hang over her shoulders; and this is the last  time, for the next day most of it is shaved off.    \"Her young friends stand near her and each sings a song, bidding  good-bye to her maiden days; and the bride weeps, fearing what the  future may hold in store for her. Then the bridegroom comes in, led by  his friends, who carry candles. He is given a veil, which he throws over  his bride's head, and then leaves with his friends for the Synagogue.    \"Though some parts of the ceremony look ridiculous, yet all is carried  out so solemnly that one feels very much impressed.    \"The bride is then led by two of her relatives or friends, who carry  candles, and all the other friends follow them through the streets, some  also carrying candles. As there are no carriages to be had in Jerusalem,  they have sometimes to walk some distance to the Synagogue.    \"The usual bridal canopy is in the Synagogue, and they walk round it  seven times; then prayers are said, and the glass is broken; Mazzeltov  is said, and with songs and clapping of hands the bridal pair is led  home again. Near the home a large Bagel is held by a friend, and as the  couple cross the threshold it is broken over their heads, and the pieces  are distributed among the guests. The bride and bridegroom are then led  into a room, and the door is closed for five minutes--I suppose to be  sure that they are the right persons, anyhow the bridegroom lifts the  bride's veil and gives her the first kiss he has ever given her. (I do  not know if she kisses him, for she may be too shy: they will not tell  when I ask).    \"After the five minutes have passed, the bride is led out of the room to  a room where the women-guests are assembled, while the bridegroom goes  to a room where the men-guests are. The feasting lasts for a few hours  in each room. Then the bride is led by some of her women friends to the  room where the men are, and the bridegroom takes her by the hand and  starts dancing; the other guests follow suit. It is amusing to see the  old grey-bearded scholars, who, one would think, could not move their  legs, dance and rejoice while the lookers-on clap and sing. It is far  more exciting than a wedding in London, for it is considered a 'Mitzvah'  to rejoice with a young bridal couple.    \"The dancing goes on for some time, the only miserable pair, I expect,  are the bride and bridegroom, who generally become very weary of it  all, for they started their wedding pilgrimage very early in the morning  and had fasted till the feasting began late in the afternoon--I often  wonder that they have any energy left in them, poor things, for they  cannot retire till late at night.    \"The next day comes the ceremony of cutting off the bride's"]]]
