He could not  admit that the pale, modest girl with the great black eyes and smile  of childish mischief bore the slightest resemblance to the respectable  matron who had brought her into existence.    The great fiesta for Chicha was the Sunday mass. It represented a  journey of three leagues to the nearest village, a weekly contact with  people unlike those of the ranch. A carriage drawn by four horses took  the senora and the two senoritas in the latest suits and hats arrived,  via Buenos Aires, from Europe. At the suggestion of Chicha, Desnoyers  accompanied them in the capacity of driver.    The father remained at home, taking advantage of this opportunity  to survey his fields in their Sunday solitude, thus keeping a  closer oversight on the shiftlessness of his hands. He was very  religious--\"Religion and good manners, you know.\" But had he not given  thousands of dollars toward building the neighboring church? A man  of his fortune should not be submitted to the same obligations as  ragamuffins!    During the Sunday lunch the young ladies were apt to make comments upon  the persons and merits of the young men of the village and neighboring  ranches, who had lingered at the church door in order to chat with them.    \"Don't fool yourselves, girls!\" observed the father shrewdly. \"You  believe that they want you for your elegance, don't you? . . . What  those shameless fellows really want are the dollars of old Madariaga,  and once they had them, they would probably give you a daily beating.\"    For a while the ranch received numerous visitors. Some were young men of  the neighborhood who arrived on spirited steeds, performing all kinds of  tricks of fancy horsemanship. They wanted to see Don Julio on the most  absurd pretexts, and at the same time improved the opportunity to chat  with Chicha and Luisa. At other times they were youths from Buenos Aires  asking for a lodging at the ranch, as they were just passing by. Don  Madariaga would growl--    \"Another good-for-nothing scamp who comes in search of the Spanish  ranchman! If he doesn't move on soon . . . I'll kick him out!\"    But the suitor did not stand long on the order of his going, intimidated  by the ominous silence of the Patron. This silence, of late, had  persisted in an alarming manner, in spite of the fact that the ranch was  no longer receiving visitors. Madariaga appeared abstracted, and all the  family, including Desnoyers, respected and feared this taciturnity.  He ate, scowling, with lowered head. Suddenly he would raise his eyes,  looking at Chicha, then at Desnoyers, finally fixing them upon his wife  as though asking her to give an account of things.    His Romantica simply did not exist for him. The only notice that he ever  took of her was to give an ironical snort when he happened to see  her leaning at sunset against the doorway, looking at the reddening  glow--one elbow on the door frame and her cheek in her hand, in  imitation of the posture of a certain white lady that she had seen in a  chromo, awaiting the knight of her dreams.    Desnoyers had been five years in the house when one day he entered his  master's private office with the brusque air of a timid person who has  suddenly reached a decision.    \"Don Julio, I am going to leave and I would like our accounts settled.\"    Madariaga looked at him slyly. \"Going to leave, eh? . . . What for?\" But  in vain he repeated his questions. The Frenchman was floundering through  a series of incoherent explanations--\"I'm going; I've got to go.\"    \"Ah, you thief, you false prophet!\" shouted the ranchman in stentorian  tones.    But Desnoyers did not quail before the insults. He had often heard his  Patron use these same words when holding somebody up to ridicule, or  haggling with certain cattle drovers.    \"Ah, you thief, you false prophet! Do you suppose that I do not know  why you are going? Do you suppose old Madariaga has not seen your  languishing looks and those of my dead fly of a daughter, clasping  each others' hands in the presence of poor China who is blinded in her  judgment? . . . It's not such a bad stroke, Frenchy. By it, you would be  able to get possession of half of the old Spaniard's dollars, and then  say that you had made it in America.\"    And while he was storming, or rather howling, all this, he had grasped  his lash and with the butt end kept poking his manager in the stomach  with such insistence that it might be construed in an affectionate or  hostile way.    \"For this reason I have come to bid you good-bye,\" said Desnoyers  haughtily. \"I know that my love is absurd, and I wish to leave.\"    \"The gentleman would go away,\" the ranchman continued spluttering. \"The  gentleman believes that here one can do what one pleases! No, siree!  Here nobody commands but old Madariaga, and I order you to stay. . . .  Ah, these women! They only serve to antagonize men. And yet we can't  live without them!\" . . .    He took several turns up and down the room, as though his last words  were making him think of something very different from what he had just  been saying. Desnoyers looked uneasily at the thong which was still  hanging from his wrist. Suppose he should attempt to whip him as he did  the peons? . . . He was still undecided whether to hold his own against  a man who had always treated him with benevolence or, while his back  was turned, to take refuge in discreet flight, when the ranchman planted  himself before him.    \"You really love her, really?\" he asked. \"Are you sure that she loves  you? Be careful what you say, for love is blind and deceitful. I, too,  when I married my China was crazy about her. Do you love her, honestly  and truly? . . . Well then, take her, you devilish Frenchy. Somebody has  to take her, and may she not turn out a weak cow like her mother! . . .  Let us have the ranch full of grandchildren!\"    In voicing this stock-raiser's wish, again appeared the great breeder of  beasts and men. And as though he considered it necessary to explain his  concession, he added--\"I do all this because I like you; and I like you  because you are serious.\"    Again the Frenchman was plunged in doubt, not knowing in just what this  greatly appreciated seriousness consisted.    At his wedding, Desnoyers thought much of his mother. If only the poor  old woman could witness this extraordinary stroke of good fortune! But  she had died the year before, believing her son enormously rich because  he had been sending her sixty dollars every month, taken from the wages  that he had earned on the ranch.    Desnoyers' entrance into the family made his father-in-law pay less  attention to business.    City life, with all its untried enchantments and snares, now attracted  Madariaga, and he began to speak with contempt of country women, poorly  groomed and inspiring him with disgust. He had given up his cowboy  attire, and was displaying with childish satisfaction, the new suits  in which a tailor of the Capital was trying to disguise him. When Elena  wished to accompany him to Buenos Aires, he would wriggle out of it,  trumping up some absorbing business. \"No; you go with your mother.\"    The fate of his fields and flocks gave him no uneasiness. His fortune,  managed by Desnoyers, was in good hands.    \"He is very serious,\" again affirmed the old Spaniard to his family  assembled in the dining roam--\"as serious as I am. . . . Nobody can make  a fool of him!\"    And finally the Frenchman concluded that when his father-in-law spoke of  seriousness he was referring to his strength of character. According to  the spontaneous declaration of Madariaga, he had, from the very first  day that he had dealings with Desnoyers, perceived in him a nature  like his own, more hard and firm perhaps, but without splurges  of eccentricities. On this account he had treated him with such  extraordinary circumspection, foreseeing that a clash between the  two could never be adjusted. Their only disagreements were about  the expenses established by Madariaga during his regime. Since the  son-in-law was managing the ranches, the work was costing less, and  the people working more diligently;--and that, too, without yells, and  without strong words and deeds, with only his presence and brief orders.    The old man was the only one defending the capricious system of a  blow followed by a gift. He revolted against a minute and mechanical  administration, always the same, without any arbitrary extravagance or  good-natured tyranny. Very frequently some of the half-breed peons whom  a malicious public supposed to be closely related to the ranchman, would  present themselves before Desnoyers with, \"Senor Manager, the old Patron  say that you are to give me five dollars.\" The Senor Manager would  refuse, and soon after Madariaga would rush in in a furious temper, but  measuring his words, nevertheless, remembering that his son-in-law's  disposition was as serious as his own.    \"I like you very much, my son, but here no one overrules me. . . . Ah,  Frenchy, you are like all the rest of your countrymen! Once you get your  claws on a penny, it goes into your stocking, and nevermore sees  the light of day, even though they crucify you. . . ! Did I say five  dollars? Give him ten. I command it and that is enough.\"    The Frenchman paid, shrugging his shoulders, whilst his father-in-law,  satisfied with his triumph, fled to Buenos Aires. It was a good thing to  have it well understood that the ranch still belonged to Madariaga, the  Spaniard.    From one of these trips, he returned with a companion, a young German  who, according to him, knew everything and could do everything. "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1487"],[0,"The Perfect Wagnerite: A Commentary on the Niblung's Ring (#10)"],[1," the wit to ask what he  wants to know, instead of pretending to know everything already. It  is above all things needful to him at this moment to find out how that  sword can be mended; and there has just dropped in upon him in his need  the one person who can tell him. In such circumstances a wise man would  hasten to show to his visitor his three deepest ignorances, and ask him  to dispel them. The dwarf, being a crafty fool, desiring only to detect  ignorance in his guest, asks him for information on the three points on  which he is proudest of being thoroughly well instructed himself. His  three questions are, Who dwell under the earth? Who dwell on the earth?  and Who dwell in the cloudy heights above? The Wanderer, in reply, tells  him of the dwarfs and of Alberic; of the earth, and the giants Fasolt  and Fafnir; of the gods and of Wotan: himself, as Mimmy now recognizes  with awe.    Next, it is Mimmy's turn to face three questions. What is that race,  dearest to Wotan, against which Wotan has nevertheless done his worst?  Mimmy can answer that: he knows the Volsungs, the race of heroes born  of Wotan's infidelities to Fricka, and can tell the Wanderer the whole  story of the twins and their son Siegfried. Wotan compliments him on his  knowledge, and asks further with what sword Siegfried will slay Fafnir?  Mimmy can answer that too: he has the whole history of the sword at his  fingers' ends. Wotan hails him as the knowingest of the knowing, and  then hurls at him the question he should himself have asked: Who  will mend the sword? Mimmy, his head forfeited, confesses with  loud lamentations that he cannot answer. The Wanderer reads him an  appropriate little lecture on the folly of being too clever to ask what  he wants to know, and informs him that a smith to whom fear is unknown  will mend Nothung. To this smith he leaves the forfeited head of his  host, and wanders off into the forest. Then Mimmy's nerves give way  completely. He shakes like a man in delirium tremens, and has a horrible  nightmare, in the supreme convulsion of which Siegfried, returning from  the forest, presently finds him.    A curious and amusing conversation follows. Siegfried himself does not  know fear, and is impatient to acquire it as an accomplishment. Mimmy  is all fear: the world for him is a phantasmagoria of terrors. It is not  that he is afraid of being eaten by bears in the forest, or of burning  his fingers in the forge fire. A lively objection to being destroyed  or maimed does not make a man a coward: on the contrary, it is the  beginning of a brave man's wisdom. But in Mimmy, fear is not the effect  of danger: it is natural quality of him which no security can allay.  He is like many a poor newspaper editor, who dares not print the truth,  however simple, even when it is obvious to himself and all his readers.  Not that anything unpleasant would happen to him if he did--not, indeed  that he could fail to become a distinguished and influential leader  of opinion by fearlessly pursuing such a course, but solely because  he lives in a world of imaginary terrors, rooted in a modest and  gentlemanly mistrust of his own strength and worth, and consequently of  the value of his opinion. Just so is Mimmy afraid of anything that can  do him any good, especially of the light and the fresh air. He is also  convinced that anybody who is not sufficiently steeped in fear to be  constantly on his guard, must perish immediately on his first sally  into the world. To preserve Siegfried for the enterprise to which he has  destined him he makes a grotesque attempt to teach him fear. He appeals  to his experience of the terrors of the forest, of its dark places, of  its threatening noises its stealthy ambushes, its sinister flickering  lights its heart-tightening ecstasies of dread.    All this has no other effect than to fill Siegfried with wonder and  curiosity; for the forest is a place of delight for him. He is as eager  to experience Mimmy's terrors as a schoolboy to feel what an electric  shock is like. Then Mimmy has the happy idea of describing Fafnir to him  as a likely person to give him an exemplary fright. Siegfried jumps at  the idea, and, since Mimmy cannot mend the sword for him, proposes to  set to work then and there to mend it for himself. Mimmy shakes his  head, and bids him see now how his youthful laziness and frowardness  have found him out--how he would not learn the smith's craft from  Professor Mimmy, and therefore does not know how even to begin mending  the sword. Siegfried Bakoonin's retort is simple and crushing. He points  out that the net result of Mimmy's academic skill is that he can neither  make a decent sword himself nor even set one to rights when it is  damaged. Reckless of the remonstrances of the scandalized professor, he  seizes a file, and in a few moments utterly destroys the fragments of  the sword by rasping them into a heap of steel filings. Then he puts  the filings into a crucible; buries it in the coals; and sets to at the  bellows with the shouting exultation of the anarchist who destroys only  to clear the ground for creation. When the steel is melted he runs it  into a mould; and lo! a sword-blade in the rough. Mimmy, amazed at the  success of this violation of all the rules of his craft, hails Siegfried  as the mightiest of smiths, professing himself barely worthy to be his  cook and scullion; and forthwith proceeds to poison some soup for him so  that he may murder him safely when Fafnir is slain. Meanwhile Siegfried  forges and tempers and hammers and rivets, uproariously singing the  while as nonsensically as the Rhine maidens themselves. Finally he  assails the anvil on which Mimmy's swords have been shattered, and  cleaves it with a mighty stroke of the newly forged Nothung.    The Second Act    In the darkest hour before the dawn of that night, we find ourselves  before the cave of Fafnir, and there we find Alberic, who can find  nothing better to do with himself than to watch the haunt of the dragon,  and eat his heart out in vain longing for the gold and the ring. The  wretched Fafnir, once an honest giant, can only make himself terrible  enough to keep his gold by remaining a venomous reptile. Why he should  not become an honest giant again and clear out of his cavern, leaving  the gold and the ring and the rest of it for anyone fool enough to take  them at such a price, is the first question that would occur to anyone  except a civilized man, who would be too accustomed to that sort of  mania to be at all surprised at it.    To Alberic in the night comes the Wanderer, whom the dwarf, recognizing  his despoiler of old, abuses as a shameless thief, taunting him with the  helpless way in which all his boasted power is tied up with the laws and  bargains recorded on the heft of his spear, which, says Alberic truly,  would crumble like chaff in his hands if he dared use it for his own  real ends. Wotan, having already had to kill his own son with it, knows  that very well; but it troubles him no more; for he is now at last  rising to abhorrence of his own artificial power, and looking to the  coming hero, not for its consolidation but its destruction. When Alberic  breaks out again with his still unquenched hope of one day destroying  the gods and ruling the world through the ring, Wotan is no longer  shocked. He tells Alberic that Brother Mime approaches with a hero whom  Godhead can neither help nor hinder. Alberic may try his luck against  him without disturbance from Valhalla. Perhaps, he suggests, if Alberic  warns Fafnir, and offers to deal with the hero for him, Fafnir, may give  him the ring. They accordingly wake up the dragon, who condescends  to enter into bellowing conversation, but is proof against their  proposition, strong in the magic of property. \"I have and hold,\" he  says: \"leave me to sleep.\" Wotan, with a wise laugh, turns to Alberic.  \"That shot missed,\" he says: \"no use abusing me for it. And now let me  tell you one thing. All things happen according to their nature; and you  can't alter them.\" And so he leaves him Alberic, raging with the sense  that his old enemy has been laughing at him, and yet prophetically  convinced that the last word will not be with the god, hides himself as  the day breaks, and his brother approaches with Siegfried.    Mimmy makes a final attempt to frighten Siegfried by discoursing of the  dragon's terrible jaws, poisonous breath, corrosive spittle, and deadly,  stinging tail. Siegfried is not interested in the tail: he wants to know  whether the dragon has a heart, being confident of his ability to stick  Nothung into it if it exists. Reassured on this point, he drives Mimmy  away, and stretches himself under the trees, listening to the morning  chatter of the birds. One of them has a great deal to say to him; but  he cannot understand it; and after vainly trying to carry on the  conversation with a reed which he cuts, he takes to entertaining the  bird with tunes on his horn, asking it to send him a loving mate such  as all the other creatures of the forest have. His tunes wake up the  dragon; and Siegfried makes merry over the grim mate the bird has  sent him. Fafnir is highly scandalized by the irreverence of the young  Bakoonin. He loses his temper; fights; and is forthwith slain, to his  own great astonishment.    In such conflicts one learns to interpret the messages of Nature a  little. When Siegfried, stung by the dragon's vitriolic blood, pops his  finger into his mouth and tastes it, he understands what the bird is  saying to him, and, instructed by it concerning the treasures within his  reach, goes into the cave to secure the gold, the ring and the wishing  cap. Then Mimmy returns, and is confronted by Alberic. The two quarrel  furiously over the sharing of the booty they have not yet secured, until  Siegfried comes from the cave with the ring and the helmet, not much  impressed by the heap of gold, and"]]]
