The locality that the regiment had  reached at the time was one where stood several farms, and the trees  surrounding these homesteads afforded cover under which a hostile  force could assemble without being perceived from a distance. On the  right was a ravine with wood in it, and amongst that the Boers were  lying in ambush. How unexpected was the appearance of a force of  Boers to the English may be judged from the fact that the band  of the regiment was playing at the time. Colonel Anstruther,  immediately he caught sight of the enemy on the crest of a slight  rise to the front, called a halt, and the order was passed to the  rear for the waggons to close up. Before this could be done a  messenger from the enemy, carrying a white flag, came forward and  handed the Colonel a note signed by Piet Joubert, and countersigned  by other Boer leaders, desiring him to halt where he was until a  reply had been received from Sir Owen Lanyon to the ultimatum the  Boers had addressed to him. The message also contained the warning  that if the soldiers advanced beyond a small stream in front of  them, it would be taken as a declaration of war. Colonel Anstruther,  with Conductor Egerton, had ridden out in front of the advanced  guard to meet this flag of truce; after he had read the message, the  bearer of it informed him verbally that two minutes were allowed for  his decision. Colonel Anstruther verbally replied that he should  march on to Pretoria, and, to use his own words, as published in his  despatch written just before he died, the Boer messenger 'said that  he would take my message to the Commandant-General; and I asked him  to let me know the result, to which he nodded assent. Almost  immediately, however, the enemy's line advanced.'    Whilst this short parley was going on, every effort was being made in  the rear to get the waggons up, but without much good result, because  when the Boers opened fire the rear-guard would be at least half a  mile behind the head of the column. Even those who were guarding the  waggons had not time to join the main body. When Colonel Anstruther  saw the Boers advancing, he gave the order to his men to extend in  skirmishing order, but before they could open out to more than loose  files they were met with a murderous volley, and at the same time  Boers on the right and left flank and in the rear, who had previously  measured and marked off the distances, picked off every man within  sight. Our men returned the fire as best they could, but in less than  ten minutes 120 were either killed or wounded, besides a large  proportion of the oxen in the waggons shot. The officers who exposed  themselves were picked off almost immediately by the Boer marksmen.  Captain Nairne, Lieutenant M'Sweeney, Lieutenant and Adjutant  Harrison, Lieutenant Hume, Deputy-Assistant Commissary-General  Barter, Conductor Egerton, Surgeon Ward, were all wounded, besides  Colonel Anstruther himself, who was shot in two or three places.    It was useless to contend against such odds, and the 'cease fire' was  sounded, and handkerchiefs waved to denote submission. During this  unequal struggle, Mrs. Smith, the widow of the bandmaster of the  regiment, who, with the wife of Sergeant-Major Fox and some children,  were riding in one of the foremost waggons, came fearlessly up to  where the wounded lay, and, tearing strips from her clothing, helped  the surgeon to bandage the wounds. The sergeant-major's wife was  severely wounded, as was also Fox himself. There was no lack of  heroism during those awful ten minutes, whilst men were being shot  down like dogs. Lieutenant Harrison was shot through the head while  cheering on his men; Lieutenant Hume was equally conspicuous  for his coolness. An orderly-room clerk named Maistre and the  Sergeant-Master-Tailor Pears quietly concealed the regimental colours  in a waggon-box when they saw the danger of them falling into the  hands of the enemy; and their work was not in vain, as Conductor  Egerton managed subsequently to wrap them round his body under his  tunic, and having obtained permission after the fight was over to walk  to Pretoria for medical assistance, he carried them safely to the  capital, as well as the disastrous news of the engagement. Forty-two  miles traversed by a wounded man on foot in eleven hours is in itself  a feat worth mentioning, and one the value of which can only be  really estimated by those who know what South African roads are in  the rainy seasons.    As soon as our force surrendered, Franz Joubert, who had been in  command of the Boers, and who, it is said, fired the first shot, with  the exclamation, 'What is the use of waiting?' came forward with some  of his men, and on finding poor Colonel Anstruther severely wounded  expressed sorrow.    Whether the affair of Bronkhorst Spruit can be called an act of  treachery on the part of the Boers is rather a nice question. Colonel  Anstruther's words--the words of a dying man--rather go to prove that  he was unfairly treated, though he does not say so directly. He was  given to understand by the messenger who came with the flag of truce  that another communication would be made to him as soon as his reply  to the request to halt had been reported to the Boer Commandant. The  only reply given him was 'a murderous volley.' The Boers cannot lay  claim to much bravery or superiority (except in numbers) over our  soldiers in this fight. Theirs was a deliberately-planned ambush to  entrap men who had no idea that they were marching in an enemy's  country. Bronkhorst Spruit engagement is the one during the whole of  the war which does not redound to the credit of the Dutch, even if it  does not reflect great discredit upon them. If a reasonable time had  been allowed Colonel Anstruther to give his reply, the 94th could not  then say, as they do say and will say, that they were treacherously  surprised. 'Two minutes' looks, under the circumstances, very much  like an idle pretence of fair dealing to cover an intentional act of  cowardice which subsequent conduct could hardly palliate. The Boers  say that they had not more men than were marching with the 94th on  that occasion; that statement is worth very little, considering the  evidence of our officers, and, above all, the harsh evidence of the  facts that the 94th was from advance-guard to rear-guard practically  surrounded and outnumbered in every direction.    The preparedness of the Boers and the precision of their fire may be  gathered from the testimony of Dr. Crow, of Pretoria, who attended  the wounded, and vouched for an average of five wounds per man. Dr.  Crow also wrote:    But as disastrous as the late war in the Transvaal had been to  British prestige, thank God those at Bronkhorst Spruit did their duty  and died like men, a noble example to any army. If any stain has been  cast on the British flag in the Transvaal, the gallant 94th did all  that was possible by their deeds at Bronkhorst Spruit to obliterate  it.    The news of this affair was received with horror, and the feelings  roused by the details of it have never been allayed. Race-hatred may  have its origin in a hundred little incidents, but in the Transvaal  there were two which undoubtedly, whether justly or otherwise, gave  a character to the Boers that has embittered feeling against them  more than any which had occurred in generations previous. The  second affair followed very closely on the Bronkhorst Spruit  engagement--_i.e.,_ the infamous murder of Captain Elliott, the only  surviving unwounded officer from Bronkhorst Spruit. Captains Elliott  and Lambert were taken prisoners, and were offered the choice of  two alternatives--either to remain prisoners of war during the  hostilities in the Transvaal, or to be released on _parole  d'honneur_ on condition that they should leave the Transvaal at  once, cross into the Free State under escort, and not bear arms  against the Republican Government during the war. The second  alternative was chosen. They received an escort and free pass from  Commandant-General Piet Joubert. The following is extracted from  Captain Lambert's Report to Sir George Colley on January 5:    We started about 1 p.m. from the Boer camp, passing through the town  of Heidelberg. After going about six to eight miles, I noticed we  were not going the right road, and mentioned the fact to the escort,  who said it was all right. Having been 'look-out' officer in the  Transvaal, I knew the district well. I was certain we were going  wrong, but we had to obey orders. At nightfall we found ourselves  nowhere near the river drift, and were ordered to outspan for the  night, and next morning the escort told us they would look for the  drift. Inspanning at daybreak, we again started, but after driving  about for some hours across country, I told the escort we would stop  where we were while they went to search for the drift. Shortly after  they returned and said they had found it, and we must come, which we  did, eventually arriving at the junction of two rivers (Vaal and  Klip), where we found the Vaal impassable, but a small punt, capable  of holding only two passengers at most, by which they said we must  cross. I pointed out that it was impossible to get my carriage or  horses over by it, and that it was not the punt the General said we  were to cross. The escort replied it was Pretorius's punt that the  General told them to take us, and we must cross; that we must leave  the carriage behind and swim the horses, which we refused to do, as  we then should have had no means of getting on. I asked them to show  me their written instructions, which they did (written in Dutch), and  I pointed out that the name of Pretorius was not in it. I then told  them they must either take us back to the Boer camp again or on to  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16523"],[0,"The Kitáb-i-Aqdas (#10)"],[1,"all His  creatures. Take heed not to stir up mischief in the land after it hath  been set in order. Whoso acteth in this way is not of Us, and We are quit  of him. Such is the command which hath, through the power of truth, been  made manifest from the heaven of Revelation.    65 It hath been laid down in the Bayan that marriage is dependent upon the  consent of both parties. Desiring to establish love, unity and harmony  amidst Our servants, We have conditioned it, once the couple's wish is  known, upon the permission of their parents, lest enmity and rancour  should arise amongst them. And in this We have yet other purposes. Thus  hath Our commandment been ordained.    66 No marriage may be contracted without payment of a dowry, which hath  been fixed for city-dwellers at nineteen mit{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}h{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}qals of pure gold, and for  village-dwellers at the same amount in silver. Whoso wisheth to increase  this sum, it is forbidden him to exceed the limit of ninety-five  mit{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}h{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}qals. Thus hath the command been writ in majesty and power. If he  content himself, however, with a payment of the lowest level, it shall be  better for him according to the Book. God, verily, enricheth whomsoever He  willeth through both heavenly and earthly means, and He, in truth, hath  power over all things.    67 It hath been decreed by God that, should any one of His servants intend  to travel, he must fix for his wife a time when he will return home. If he  return by the promised time, he will have obeyed the bidding of his Lord  and shall be numbered by the Pen of His behest among the righteous;  otherwise, if there be good reason for delay, he must inform his wife and  make the utmost endeavour to return to her. Should neither of these  eventualities occur, it behoveth her to wait for a period of nine months,  after which there is no impediment to her taking another husband; but  should she wait longer, God, verily, loveth those women and men who show  forth patience. Obey ye My commandments, and follow not the ungodly, they  who have been reckoned as sinners in God's Holy Tablet. If, during the  period of her waiting, word should reach her from her husband, she should  choose the course that is praiseworthy. He, of a truth, desireth that His  servants and His handmaids should be at peace with one another; take heed  lest ye do aught that may provoke intransigence amongst you. Thus hath the  decree been fixed and the promise come to pass. If, however, news should  reach her of her husband's death or murder, and be confirmed by general  report, or by the testimony of two just witnesses, it behoveth her to  remain single; then, upon completion of the fixed number of months, she is  free to adopt the course of her choosing. Such is the bidding of Him Who  is mighty and powerful in His command.    68 Should resentment or antipathy arise between husband and wife, he is  not to divorce her but to bide in patience throughout the course of one  whole year, that perchance the fragrance of affection may be renewed  between them. If, upon the completion of this period, their love hath not  returned, it is permissible for divorce to take place. God's wisdom,  verily, hath encompassed all things. The Lord hath prohibited, in a Tablet  inscribed by the Pen of His command, the practice to which ye formerly had  recourse when thrice ye had divorced a woman. This He hath done as a  favour on His part, that ye may be accounted among the thankful. He who  hath divorced his wife may choose, upon the passing of each month, to  remarry her when there is mutual affection and consent, so long as she  hath not taken another husband. Should she have wed again, then, by this  other union, the separation is confirmed and the matter is concluded  unless, clearly, her circumstances change. Thus hath the decree been  inscribed with majesty in this glorious Tablet by Him Who is the  Dawning-place of Beauty.    69 If the wife accompany her husband on a journey, and differences arise  between them on the way, he is required to provide her with her expenses  for one whole year, and either to return her whence she came or to entrust  her, together with the necessaries for her journey, to a dependable person  who is to escort her home. Thy Lord, verily, ordaineth as He pleaseth, by  virtue of a sovereignty that overshadoweth the peoples of the earth.    70 Should a woman be divorced in consequence of a proven act of  infidelity, she shall receive no maintenance during her period of waiting.  Thus hath the day-star of Our commandment shone forth resplendent from the  firmament of justice. Truly, the Lord loveth union and harmony and  abhorreth separation and divorce. Live ye one with another, O people, in  radiance and joy. By My life! All that are on earth shall pass away, while  good deeds alone shall endure; to the truth of My words God doth Himself  bear witness. Compose your differences, O My servants; then heed ye the  admonition of Our Pen of Glory and follow not the arrogant and wayward.    71 Take heed lest the world beguile you as it beguiled the people who went  before you! Observe ye the statutes and precepts of your Lord, and walk ye  in this Way which hath been laid out before you in righteousness and  truth. They who eschew iniquity and error, who adhere to virtue, are, in  the sight of the one true God, among the choicest of His creatures; their  names are extolled by the Concourse of the realms above, and by those who  dwell in this Tabernacle which hath been raised in the name of God.    72 It is forbidden you to trade in slaves, be they men or women. It is not  for him who is himself a servant to buy another of God's servants, and  this hath been prohibited in His Holy Tablet. Thus, by His mercy, hath the  commandment been recorded by the Pen of justice. Let no man exalt himself  above another; all are but bondslaves before the Lord, and all exemplify  the truth that there is none other God but Him. He, verily, is the  All-Wise, Whose wisdom encompasseth all things.    73 Adorn yourselves with the raiment of goodly deeds. He whose deeds  attain unto God's good pleasure is assuredly of the people of Baha and is  remembered before His throne. Assist ye the Lord of all creation with  works of righteousness, and also through wisdom and utterance. Thus,  indeed, have ye been commanded in most of the Tablets by Him Who is the  All-Merciful. He, truly, is cognizant of what I say. Let none contend with  another, and let no soul slay another; this, verily, is that which was  forbidden you in a Book that hath lain concealed within the Tabernacle of  glory. What! Would ye kill him whom God hath quickened, whom He hath  endowed with spirit through a breath from Him? Grievous then would be your  trespass before His throne! Fear God, and lift not the hand of injustice  and oppression to destroy what He hath Himself raised up; nay, walk ye in  the way of God, the True One. No sooner did the hosts of true knowledge  appear, bearing the standards of Divine utterance, than the tribes of the  religions were put to flight, save only those who willed to drink from the  stream of everlasting life in a Paradise created by the breath of the  All-Glorious.    74 God hath decreed, in token of His mercy unto His creatures, that semen  is not unclean. Yield thanks unto Him with joy and radiance, and follow  not such as are remote from the Dawning-place of His nearness. Arise ye,  under all conditions, to render service to the Cause, for God will  assuredly assist you through the power of His sovereignty which  overshadoweth the worlds. Cleave ye unto the cord of refinement with such  tenacity as to allow no trace of dirt to be seen upon your garments. Such  is the injunction of One Who is sanctified above all refinement. Whoso  falleth short of this standard with good reason shall incur no blame. God,  verily, is the Forgiving, the Merciful. Wash ye every soiled thing with  water that hath undergone no alteration in any one of the three respects;  take heed not to use water that hath been altered through exposure to the  air or to some other agent. Be ye the very essence of cleanliness amongst  mankind. This, truly, is what your Lord, the Incomparable, the All-Wise,  desireth for you.    75 God hath, likewise, as a bounty from His presence, abolished the  concept of \"uncleanness\", whereby divers things and peoples have been held  to be impure. He, of a certainty, is the Ever-Forgiving, the Most  Generous. Verily, all created things were immersed in the sea of  purification when, on that first day of Ridvan, We shed upon the whole of  creation the splendours of Our most excellent Names and Our most exalted  Attributes. This, verily, is a token of My loving providence, which hath  encompassed all the worlds. Consort ye then with the followers of all  religions, and proclaim ye the Cause of your Lord, the Most Compassionate;  this is the very crown of deeds, if ye be of them who understand.    76 God hath enjoined upon you to observe the utmost cleanliness, to the  extent of washing what is soiled with dust, let alone with hardened dirt  and similar defilement. Fear Him, and be of those who are pure. Should the  garb of anyone be visibly sullied, his prayers shall not ascend to God,  and the celestial Concourse will turn away from him. Make use of  rose-water, and of pure perfume; this, indeed, is that which God hath  loved from the beginning that hath no beginning, in order that there may  be diffused from you what your Lord, the Incomparable, the All-Wise,  desireth.    77 God hath relieved you of the ordinance laid down in the Bayan  concerning the destruction of books. We have permitted you to read such  sciences as are profitable unto you, not such as end in idle disputation;  better is this for you, if ye be of them that comprehend.    78 O kings of the earth! He Who is the sovereign"]]]
