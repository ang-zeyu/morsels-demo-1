I am a Christian. Do your  best to annul that confession: none of your torments will be able to  overcome my faith.\" Her brother, after trying in vain, by alternate  threats and blandishments, to bring her back from her error, finally  dragged her before the Kadi; and he, hearing her brother's accusation,  and her own confession, ordered her to be barbarously beaten, and then  given up nearly dead to her brother. She managed, however, to recover,  and escaped under angelic guidance.[2] Shortly afterwards, while praying  in a church, she was found by Maria, sister of Walabonsus  above-mentioned,[3] who had been martyred a few months previously.  Their father, being a Christian, converted his unbelieving wife. They  came to live at Froniano, near Cordova, and their daughter was educated  at the nunnery of Cuteclara, near the city, under the care of the  abbess, Artemia. Brooding over her brother's martyrdom, and perhaps, as  was so often the case, seeing his glorified spirit in a vision, she left  the cloister, determining to follow in his saintly footsteps. While on  her way to give herself up, she turned aside into a church to pray, and  found Flora there.        [1] \"Life of Flora and Maria,\" by Eulogius, secs. 3 ff.        [2] _Ibid._, sec. 8. \"Agelico comitante meatu.\"        [3] \"Life of Flora and Maria,\" sec. 11. Lane Poole, \"Moors in      Spain,\" says, \"Sister of Isaac.\"    Together, then, did these devoted girls go forth[1] to curse Mohammed,  of whom they probably knew next to nothing, and lose their own lives.  The judge, however, pitying their youth and beauty, merely imprisoned  them. News of his sister's imprisonment being brought to Flora's  brother, he induced the judge to make a further examination of her, and  she was brought out of prison before the Kadi, who, pointing to her  brother, asked her if she knew him. Flora answered that she did--as her  brother according to the flesh. \"How is it, then,\" asked the judge,  \"that he remains a good Moslem, while you have apostatized?\" She  answered that God had enlightened her; and, on professing herself ready  to repeat her former denunciations of the Prophet, she was again  remanded to prison. Here she and Maria are threatened with being thrown  upon the streets as prostitutes[2]--a punishment far worse than the  easy death they had desired. This shakes their constancy; when they  find an unexpected comforter in Eulogius himself, who is now imprisoned  for being an encourager and inciter of defiance to the laws. It is  strange that he should have been allowed to carry on in the prison  itself the very work for which he had been imprisoned. The support of  Eulogius enabled these tender maidens to stand firm through another  examination, and the judge, proving too merciful, or too good a Moslem,  to carry out the above-mentioned threat, they were led forth to die  (November 24, 851). Before their death they had promised Eulogius to  intercede before the throne of God for his release, which accordingly is  brought to pass six days after their own execution.[3]    An interval of only a little more than a month elapsed before  Gumesindus, a priest of the district called Campania, near Cordova, and  Servus Dei, a monk, suffered death in the same way (January 13, 852).[4]        [1] Eulog. to Alvar, i. sec. 2; \"Life of Flora and Maria,\" by      Eulog., sec. 12.        [2] _Ibid._, sec. 13, and Eulog., \"Doc. Mart.,\" sec. 4.      Eulogius tried to lessen the terror of this threat by pointing      out that \"non polluit mentem aliena corruptio, quam non foedat      propria delectatis,\"--a poor consolation, but the only one! He      does not seem to have known--or surely he would have quoted      it--the express injunction of the Koran (xxiv. verse      35):--\"Compel not your maidservants to prostitute themselves,      if they be willing to live chastely ... but, if any shall      compel them thereto, verily God will be gracious and merciful      unto such women after their compulsion.\"        [3] Eulog., letter to Alvar, Florez, xi. 295. Fleury, v. 100.        [4] Eulogius, \"Mem. Sanct.,\" ii. c. ix.    There was now a pause for six months in the race for martyrdom, and it  seemed as if the Church had come to its right mind upon this subject.  This, however, was far from being the case. Hitherto the victims had  been almost without exception priests, monks, and nuns; but the next  martyrs afford us instances of married couples claiming a share in this  doubtful honour. These were Aurelius, son of a Moslem father and a  Christian mother, and his wife Sabigotha (or Nathalia), the daughter of  Moslem parents, whose father dying, her mother married a Christian and  was converted; and Felix and his wife Liliosa.[1] It would seem that  with all the harm that was done by this outbreak of fanaticism, some  good was also effected in awaking the worldly-minded adherents of  Christianity from the spiritual torpor into which they were sinking; for  these new martyrs were of the class of hidden[2] Christians, who were  now shamed into avowing their real creed.[3] Yet surely it had been far  better if they had been content to live like Christians instead of dying  like suicides. In their case, indeed, we find no sudden irresistible  impulse driving them to defy the laws, but a slowly-matured conviction  that it was their duty, disregarding all human ties, to give themselves  up to death. In this resolution they were fortified by the advice and  encouragement of Eulogius and Alvar,[4] the latter of whom prudently  warns Aurelius to make sure that his courage is sufficient to stand the  trial.[5] Sabigotha is persuaded to accompany her husband in his  self-destruction, her natural reluctance to leave her children being  overcome by Eulogius,[6] who recommends that they should be given over  to the care of a monastery. A seasonable vision, in which Flora and  Maria appear to her, clenches her purpose.        [1] _Ibid._, ii. ch. x., secs. 1, 2.        [2] See below, p. 72.        [3] Aurelius was roused from his religious dissimulation by      seeing the sufferings of John. See Eulog., \"Mem. Sanct.,\" ii.      c. x. sec. 5.        [4] _Ibid._, sec. 18.        [5] This would lead us to suppose that the courage of some      _had_ failed.        [6] Eulogius comments:--\"O admirabilis ardor divinus, quo      filiorum affectus respuitur!\" The parents not only desert their      children, but give away most of their goods to the poor,      thereby making their own children of the number.    Meanwhile a foreign monk from Bethlehem, who, being sent on business  connected with his monastery to Africa, had crossed over in Spain,  impelled by the wild enthusiasm there prevailing, determined to offer  himself as a candidate for martyrdom with the four persons above  mentioned.    They then take counsel together how they may best effect their purpose,  there being evidently enough difficulty in procuring martyrdom for  themselves to shew the statements of the apologists, that there was a  fierce persecution raging, to be at least much exaggerated, if not  entirely without foundation. The plan decided upon, which the devisers  audaciously attributed to the suggestion of God,[1] was that the women  should go forth unveiled and with hurried steps to the church, in the  hope that such an unwonted sight would direct attention to them, and  occasion the arrest of the whole number. It fell out as desired, and  they were all brought before the judge, and interrogated with the usual  result, except that the judge on this occasion dismissed them with  scornful anger.[2] But George, disappointed at his untoward clemency, as  they were being led away broke out with,[3] \"Can you not go down to hell  without seeking to drag us also thither as your companions?\"    This incoherent abuse naturally incensed the soldiers, as it was no  doubt intended that it should. Accordingly the prisoners were dragged  again before the Kadi, who asked them in a mild tone of remonstrance,  why they had abandoned the faith of Islam,[4] and refused to live,  promising them at the same time great rewards, if they would become  Moslems again. On their refusal they were remanded for two days, which  seemed a very long time, so eager were they to die. They pass the time  with singing hymns, and are blessed with visits of angels and miraculous  signs. Their chains drop off, and the gaolers dare not again bind those  whom Christ Himself had loosed.[5] The authorities, now as ever, anxious  if possible to avoid extreme penalties, determine to release George,  because they had not themselves[6] heard his blasphemy. He baulks their  merciful intention by repeating his words on the spot, and he is  accordingly led forth and beheaded with the others (July 27, 852).    Within a month Christopher,[7] a monk of Rojana, and of Arab lineage,  and Leovigild, a monk of Fraga, both being places near Cordova, are  executed for the same offence and in the same manner, their dead bodies  being nailed to stakes. While taking the air in his palace,[8] the king  saw these bodies, and ordered them to be burnt, and the ashes scattered  in the river. The same night Abdurrahman II. was struck down with  apoplexy, and the martyrs' friends hailed it as a manifest judgment from  Heaven.        [1] Eulog., \"Mem. Sanct.,\" ii. sec. 27. \"Omnes in cornmuni      coepimus _cogitare quomodo ad desideratum perveniremus      coronam:_ et ita _Domino disfiensante_ visum est nobis ut      fugerent sorores nostrae revelatis vultibus ad ecclesiam si      forte nos alligandi daretur occasio, et ita factum est.\"        [2] _Ibid._, sec. 29. \"Exite quibus vita praesens taedium est,      et mors pro gloria computatur.\"        [3] _Ibid._, sec. 30.

In a few days, however, Napoleon will have a room down  town, and at odd times they can be sent there. I am not willing to put  any more with the family where I have hitherto sometimes sent them.    When it is possible I wish you would advise me two days before a  shipment of your intention, as Napoleon is not always on hand to look  out for them at short notice. In special cases you might advise me by  Telegraph, thus: \"One M. (or one F.) this morning.

DEAR FRIEND STILL:--I write to inform you that Miss Mary Wever arrived  safe in this city. You may imagine the happiness manifested on the part  of the two lovers, Mr. H. and Miss W. I think they will be married as  soon as they can get ready. I presume Mrs. Hill will commence to make up  the articles to-morrow. Kind Sir, as all of us is concerned about the  welfare of our enslaved brethren at the South, particularly our friends,  we appeal to your sympathy to do whatever is in your power to save poor  Willis Johnson from the hands of his cruel master. It is not for me to  tell you of his case, because Miss Wever has related the matter fully to  you. All I wish to say is this, I wish you to write to my uncle, at  Petersburg, by our friend, the Capt. Tell my uncle to go to Richmond and  ask my mother whereabouts this man is. The best for him is to make his  way to Petersburg; that is, if you can get the Capt. to bring him. He  have not much money. But I hope the friends of humanity will not  withhold their aid on the account of money. However we will raise all  the money that is wanting to pay for his safe delivery. You will please  communicate this to the friends as soon as possible.    Yours truly,    JOHN H. HILL.        LETTER FROM J. BIGELOW, ESQ.      WASHINGTON, D.C., June 22d, 1854.    MR. WILLIAM STILL:--_Sir_--I have just received a letter from my friend,  Wm. Wright, of York Sulphur Springs, Pa., in which he says, that by  writing to you, I may get some information about the transportation of  some _property_ from this neighborhood to your city or vicinity.    A person who signs himself Wm. Penn, lately wrote to Mr. Wright, saying  he would pay $300 to have this service performed. It is for the  conveyance of _only one_ SMALL package; but it has been discovered  since, that the removal cannot be so safely effected without taking _two  larger_ packages with it. I understand that the _three_ are to be  brought to this city and stored in safety, as soon as the forwarding  merchant in Philadelphia shall say he is ready to send on. The storage,  etc., here, will cost a trifle, but the $300 will be promptly paid for  the whole service. I think Mr. Wright's daughter, Hannah, has also seen  you. I am also known to Prof. C.D. Cleveland, of your city. If you  answer this promptly, you will soon hear from Wm. Penn himself.    Very truly yours,    J. BIGELOW.        LETTER FROM HAM & EGGS, SLAVE (U.G.R.R. AG'T).      PETERSBURG, VA., Oct. 17th, 1860.    MR. W. STILL:--_Dear Sir_--I am happy to think, that the time has come  when we no doubt can open our correspondence with one another again.  Also I am in hopes, that these few lines may find you and family well  and in the enjoyment of good health, as it leaves me and family the  same. I want you to know, that I feel as much determined to work in this  glorious cause, as ever I did in all of my life, and I have some very  good hams on hand that I would like very much for you to have. I have  nothing of interest to write about just now, only that the politics of  the day is in a high rage, and I don't know of the result, therefore, I  want you to be one of those wide-a-wakes as is mentioned from your  section of country now-a-days, &c. Also, if you wish to write to me, Mr.  J. Brown will inform you how to direct a letter to me.    No more at present, until I hear from you; but I want you to be a  wide-a-wake.    Yours in haste,    HAM & EGGS.        LETTER FROM REV H. WILSON (U.G.R.R. AG'T).      ST. CATHARINE, C.W., July 2d, 1855.    MY DEAR FRIEND, WM. STILL:--Mr. Elias Jasper and Miss Lucy Bell having  arrived here safely on Saturday last, and found their \"companions in  tribulation,\" who had arrived before them, I am induced to write and let  you know the fact. They are a cheerful, happy company, and very grateful  for their freedom. I have done the best I could for their comfort, but  they are about to proceed across the lake to Toronto, thinking they can  do better there than here, which is not unlikely. They all remember you  as their friend and benefactor, and return to you their sincere thanks.  My means of support are so scanty, that I am obliged to write without  paying postage, or not write at all. I hope you are not moneyless, as I  am. In attending to the wants of numerous strangers, I am much of the  time perplexed from lack of means; but send on as many as you can and I  will divide with them to the last crumb.

Please meet them.    Thine, &c.,    E.F. PENNYPACKER.    We have within the past 2 mos. passed 43 through our hands, transported  most of them to Norristown in our own conveyance. E.F.P.        LETTER FROM JOS. C. BUSTILL (U.G.R.R. DEPOT).      HARRISBURG, March 24, '56.    FRIEND STILL:--I suppose ere this you have seen those five large and  three small packages I sent by way of Reading, consisting of three men  and women and children. They arrived here this morning at 8-1/2 o'clock  and left twenty minutes past three. You will please send me any  information likely to prove interesting in relation to them.    Lately we have formed a Society here, called the Fugitive Aid Society.  This is our first case, and I hope it will prove entirely successful.    When you write, please inform me what signs or symbols you make use of  in your despatches, and any other information in relation to operations  of the Underground Rail Road.    Our reason for sending by the Reading Road, was to gain time; it is  expected the owners will be in town this afternoon, and by this Road we  gained five hours' time, which is a matter of much importance, and we  may have occasion to use it sometimes in future. In great haste,    Yours with great respect,    Jos. C. BUSTILL,        LETTER FROM A SLAVE SECRETED IN RICHMOND.      RICHMOND, VA, Oct. 18th, 1860.    To MR.

Sir, if this should reach you, be assured  that it comes from the same poor individual that you have heard of  before; the person who was so unlucky, and deceived also. If you write,  address your letter John M. Hill, care of Box No. 250. I am speaking of  a person who lives in P.va. I hope, sir, you will understand this is  from a poor individual.
