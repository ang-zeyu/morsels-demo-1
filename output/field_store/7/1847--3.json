But if God allowed the devil to approach me in this open way,  Angels too were sent to console and strengthen me. Marie never  left me, and never showed the least trace of weariness in spite of  all the trouble I gave her--for I could not rest when she was  away. During meals, when Victoire took care of me, I never ceased  calling tearfully \"Marie! Marie!\" When she wanted to go out, it  was only if she were going to Mass or to see Pauline that I kept  quiet. As for Leonie and my little Celine, they could not do  enough for me. On Sundays they shut themselves up for hours with a  poor child who seemed almost to have lost her reason. My own dear  sisters, how much I made you suffer! My uncle and aunt were also  devoted to me. My aunt came to see me every day, and brought me  many little gifts. I could never tell you how my love for these  dear ones increased during this illness. I understood better than  ever what Papa had so often told us: \"Always remember, children,  that your uncle and aunt have devoted themselves to you in a way  that is quite exceptional.\" In his old age he experienced this  himself, and now he must bless and protect those who lavished upon  him such affectionate care.[5]    When my sufferings grew less, my great delight was to weave  garlands of daisies and forget-me-nots for Our Lady's statue. We  were in the beautiful month of May, when all nature is clothed  with the flowers of spring; the Little Flower alone drooped, and  seemed as though it had withered for ever. Yet she too had a  shining sun, the miraculous statue of the Queen of Heaven. How  often did not the Little Flower turn towards this glorious Sun!    One day Papa came into my room in the deepest distress, and I  watched him go up to Marie and give her some money, bidding her  write to Paris, and have a novena of Masses said at the shrine of  Our Lady of Victories,[6] to obtain the cure of his poor little  Queen. How touching were his faith and love! How much I longed to  get up and tell him I was cured! Alas! my wishes could not work a  miracle, and it needed one to restore me to health. Yes, it needed  a great miracle, and this was wrought by Our Lady of Victories  herself.    One Sunday, during the novena, Marie went into the garden, leaving  me with Leonie, who was reading by the window. After a short time  I began to call: \"Marie! Marie!\" very softly. Leonie, accustomed  to hear me fret like this, took no notice, so I called louder,  until Marie came back to me. I saw her come into the room quite  well, but, for the first time, I failed to recognise her. I looked  all round and glanced anxiously into the garden, still calling:  \"Marie! Marie!\" Her anguish was perhaps greater than mine, and  that was unutterable. At last, after many fruitless efforts to  make me recognise her, she whispered a few words to Leonie, and  went away pale and trembling. Leonie presently carried me to the  window. There I saw the garden, and Marie walking up and down, but  still I did not recognise her; she came forward, smiling, and held  out her arms to me calling tenderly: \"Therese, dear little  Therese!\" This last effort failing, she came in again and knelt in  tears at the foot of my bed; turning towards the statue of Our  Lady, she entreated her with the fervour of a mother who begs the  life of her child and will not be refused. Leonie and Celine  joined her, and that cry of faith forced the gates of Heaven. I  too, finding no help on earth and nearly dead with pain, turned to  my Heavenly Mother, begging her from the bottom of my heart to  have pity on me. Suddenly the statue seemed to come to life and  grow beautiful, with a divine beauty that I shall never find words  to describe. The expression of Our Lady's face was ineffably  sweet, tender, and compassionate; but what touched me to the very  depths of my soul was her gracious smile. Then, all my pain  vanished, two big tears started to my eyes and fell silently. . . .    They were indeed tears of unmixed heavenly joy. \"Our Blessed Lady  has come to me, she has smiled at me. How happy I am, but I shall  tell no one, or my happiness will leave me!\" Such were my  thoughts. Looking around, I recognised Marie; she seemed very much  overcome, and looked lovingly at me, as though she guessed that I  had just received a great grace.    Indeed her prayers had gained me this unspeakable favour--a smile  from the Blessed Virgin! When she saw me with my eyes fixed on the  statue, she said to herself: \"Therese is cured!\" And it was true.  The Little Flower had come to life again--a bright ray from its  glorious Sun had warmed and set it free for ever from its cruel  enemy. \"The dark winter is past, the rain is over and gone,\"[7]  and Our Lady's Little Flower gathered such strength that five  years later it opened wide its petals on the fertile mountain of  Carmel.    As I said before, Marie was convinced that Our Blessed Lady, while  restoring my bodily health, had granted me some hidden grace. So,  when I was alone with her, I could not resist her tender and  pressing inquiries. I was so astonished to find my secret already  known, without my having said a word, that I told her everything.  Alas! as I had foreseen, my joy was turned into bitterness. For  four years the remembrance of this grace was a cause of real pain  to me, and it was only in the blessed sanctuary of Our Lady of  Victories, at my Mother's feet, that I once again found peace.  There it was restored to me in all its fulness, as I will tell you  later.    This is how my joy was changed into sadness. When Marie had heard  the childish, but perfectly sincere, account of the grace I had  received, she begged my leave to tell them at the Carmel, and I  did not like to refuse her. My first visit there after my illness  was full of joy at seeing Pauline clothed in the habit of Our Lady  of Carmel. It was a happy time for us both, we had so much to say,  we had both suffered so much. My heart was so full that I could  hardly speak.    You were there, dear Mother, and plainly showed your affection for  me; I saw several other Sisters too, and you must remember how  they questioned me about my cure. Some asked if Our Lady was  holding the Infant Jesus in her arms, others if the Angels were  with her, and so on. All these questions distressed and grieved  me, and I could only make one answer: \"Our Lady looked very  beautiful; I saw her come towards me and smile.\" But noticing that  the nuns thought something quite different had happened from what  I had told them, I began to persuade myself that I had been guilty  of an untruth.    If only I had kept my secret I should have kept my happiness also.  But Our Lady allowed this trouble to befall me for the good of my  soul; perhaps without it vanity would have crept into my heart,  whereas now I was humbled, and I looked on myself with feelings of  contempt. My God, Thou alone knowest all that I suffered!  ______________________________    [1] Marie Guerin entered the Carmel at Lisieux on August 15, 1895,  and took the name of Sister Mary of the Eucharist. She died on  April 14, 1905, aged thirty-four.    [2] With the Carmelites the grating is only opened for near  relatives and very young children.

Monsieur Guerin, having  for many years used his pen in defence of the Church, and his  fortune in the support of good works, died a beautiful death on  September 28, 1909, in his sixty-ninth year. [Ed.]    [6] It was in this small church--once deserted and to-day perhaps  the most frequented in Paris--that the saintly Abbe Desgenettes  was inspired by Our Lady, in 1836, to establish the Confraternity  of the Immaculate Heart of Mary for the conversion of sinners.  [Ed.]    [7] Cant. 2:11.    ______________________________    CHAPTER IV  FIRST COMMUNION AND CONFIRMATION    While describing this visit to the Carmel, my thoughts are carried  back to the first one which I paid after Pauline entered. On the  morning of that happy day, I wondered what name would be given to  me later on. I knew that there was already a Sister Teresa of  Jesus; nevertheless, my beautiful name of Therese could not be  taken from me. Suddenly I thought of the Child Jesus whom I loved  so dearly, and I felt how much I should like to be called Teresa  of the Child Jesus. I was careful not to tell you of my wish, dear  Mother, yet you said to me, in the middle of our conversation:  \"When you come to us, little one, you will be called 'Teresa of  the Child Jesus.'\" My joy was great indeed. This happy coincidence  of thought seemed a special favour from the Holy Child.    So far I have not said anything about my love for pictures and  books, and yet I owe some of the happiest and strongest  impressions which have encouraged me in the practice of virtue to  the beautiful pictures Pauline used to show me. Everything was  forgotten while looking at them. For instance, \"The Little Flower  of the Divine Prisoner\" suggested so many thoughts that I would  remain gazing at it in a kind of ecstasy. I offered myself to Our  Lord to be His Little Flower; I longed to console Him, to draw as  near as possible to the Tabernacle, to be looked on, cared for,  and gathered by Him.    As I was of no use at games, I should have preferred to spend all  my time in reading. Happily for me, I had visible guardian angels  to guide me in this matter; they chose books suitable"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/168"],[0,"The History and Practice of the Art of Photography (#10)"],[1,"with brass band rests instead of the button; but the only  recommendation these can possibly possess in the eyes of any artist, is  their cheapness.    [Illustration: Fig. 19 (hipho_19.gif)]    For a Daguerreotypist permanently located the independent iron  head-rest, B fig. 19, is the most preferable, principally on account of  its solidity.  It is entirely of iron, is supported by a tripod (a) of  the same metal and can be elevated by means of a rod (b) passing  through the body of the tripod, to a height sufficient for a person,  standing, to rest against.    [Illustration: Fig. 20 (hipho_20.gif)]    GALVANIC BATTERY.--This article is used for the purpose of giving to  imperfectly coated plates a thicker covering of silver.  The form of  battery now most universally employed for electrotype, and other  galvanic purposes, is Smee's--Fig. 20.  It consists of a piece of  platinized silver, A, on the top of which is fixed a beam of wood, B,  to prevent contact with the silver.  A binding screw C is soldered on  to the silver plate to connect it with any desired object, by means of  the copper wire, e.  A plate of amalgamated zinc, D, varying with the  fancy of the operator from one half to the entire width of the silver  is placed on each side of the wood.  This is set into a glass vessel,  P,--the extreme ends of the wood resting upon its edge--on which the  acid with which it is charged has no effect.  The jar is charged with  sulphuric acid, (common oil of vitriol) diluted in eight parts its bulk  of water.  The zinc plates of the battery have been amalgamated with  quicksilver, and when the battery is set into the jar of acid there  should be no action percieved upon them when the poles F, G, are not in  contact.  Should any action be percieved, it indicates imperfect  amalgamation; this can be easily remedied by pouring a little mercury  upon them immediately after removing them from the acid, taking care to  get none upon the centre plate A.    Directions for use.--A sheet of silver must be attached to the wire  connected with the centre plate A of the battery, and placed in the  silver solution--prepared as directed below.  The plate to be silvered  is first cleaned with diluted sulphuric acid, and then attached to the  wire, G, proceeding from the zinc plates D, D, and placed in the silver  solution, opposite the silver plate attached to the pole F, and about  half an inch from it.  A slight effervescence will now be percieved  from the battery, and the silver will be deposited upon the  Daguerreotype plate, while at the same time a portion of the silver  plate is dissolved.    To prepare the solution of silver.--Dissolve one ounce of chloride of  silver in a solution of two ounces of cyanide of potassium, previously  dissolved in one quart of water.  The oxide of silver may be used  instead of the chloride.  This solution is put into a tumbler, or other  vessel.    [Illustration: Fig. 21 (hipho_21.gif)]    [Illustration: Fig. 22 (hipho_22.gif)]    This battery with the necessary articles for using it may be obtained  of E. Anthony, 205 Broadway, New York city.    The other articles required by every operator may be simply enumerated,  viz:    Sticking, or sealing paper.    A pair of pliers, or forceps.    Porcelain pans or dishes, for applying the hyposulphite of soda and  washing after the imagine is fixed, something in form like fig. 23.    A support for holding the plate while being washed, like fig. 24.

THE DAGUERREOTYPE PROCESS.    The process of taking Daguerreotype pictures differs very materially  from all others of the photographic art, inasmuch as the production of  the image is effected upon plates of copper coated with silver.  The  silver employed should be as pure as possible; the thickness of the  plate is of little consequence, provided there be sufficient silver to  bear the cleaning and polishing--is free from copper spots, is  susceptible of a high polish, an exquisitely sensitive coating and a  pleasing tone.  These qualities are possessed to an eminent degree by  the French plates.    Having already enumerated the various processes--and the apparatus  necessary for the manipulation, I will here give a list of the  chemicals to be used, and then proceed to explain them more fully.  The  requisite chemicals are--      NITRIC ACID,             ROUGE,    DRY IODINE,              MERCURY,    DRYING POWDER,           HYPOSULPHITE OF SODA,    CYANIDE OF POTASSIUM,    CHLORIDE OF GOLD; OR    ROTTENSTONE,             HYPOSULPHITE OF GOLD.    TRIPOLI,                 CHLORIDE OF SILVER.    CHLORIDE OF IODINE,  } their compounds, or other    BROMINE              } accelerating mixtures.    FIRST OPERATION.--Cleaning and polishing the plate.--For this purpose  the operator will require the--    Plate Blocks,    Plate Vice    Spirit Lamp,    Polishing Buffs,    Nitric Acid, diluted in fifteen times its bulk of water    Galvanic Battery, to galvanize the plate, if it is too imperfect to be  used without, previous cleaning it, as directed in the last chapter.    Rottenstone,    Tripoli, which is too often dispensed with.    Rouge, or lampblack--the first being most preferable.  The English  operators mix the two together.    Prepared cotton Wool, or Canton flannel.  If the first is used, it  should be excluded from the dust, as it is not so easily cleansed as  the latter.    The plate is secured, with its silver side upward, to the block, by the  means described on page 58--having previously turned the edges backward  all around.  The amount of cleaning a plate requires, depends upon the  state it is in.  We will suppose one in the worst condition; dirty,  scratched, and full of mercury spots, all of which imperfections are  more or less to be encountered.  The mercury spots are to be removed by  burning the plate.  To do this hold the plate over the flame of a  spirit lamp, more particularly under the mercury spots, until they,  assume a dull appearance, when the lamp is to be removed, and the plate  allowed to cool, after which it is attached to the block.    Place the block upon the swivle, and hold it firmly with the left hand;  take a small knot or pellet of cotton, or, if you like it better, a  small piece of canton flannel--wet it with a little diluted nitric  acid; then sift some finely prepared rottenstone--Davie's,* if you can  get it--upon it, and rub it over the plate with a continual circular  motion, till all traces of the dirt and scratches are removed; then  wipe off the rottenstone with a clean piece of cotton, adopting, as  before, a slight circular motion, at the same time wiping the edges of  the plate.  Even the back should not be neglected, but throughly  cleansed from any dirt or greasy film it may have received from  handling.    * Sold by E. Anthony.    When this is thoroughly accomplished, mix a portion of your tripoli  with the dilute nitric acid, to the consistence of thick cream.  Then  take a pellet of cotton and well polish the plate with this mixture, in  the same manner as with the rottenstone.  Continue the process till, on  removing the tripoli with a clean pellet, the plate exhibits a clear,  smooth, bright surface, free from all spots, or scratches.  Any remains  of the acid on the plate may be entirely removed By sifting on it a  little Drying powder, and then wiping it carefully off with a fine  camels hair brush, or duster.  The finishing polish is now to be given.    For this purpose the rouge--or a mixture of rouge and lamp-black, in  the proportion of one part of the former to seven of the latter--is  used.  It should be kept either in a muslin bag, or wide mouth bottle,  over which a piece of muslin is tied--in fact, both the rottenstone and  tripoli should be preserved from the dust in the same manner.  With a  little of this powder spread over the buff--described on page 53--the  plate recieves its final polish; the circular motion is changed for a  straight one across the plate, which, if intended for a portrait,  should be buffed the narrow way; but if, for a landscape or view of a  house, the length way of the plate.    The operation of cleaning the plate at first appears difficult and  tedious, and many have been deterred from attempting this interesting  art on that account; but, in reality, it is more simple in practice  than in description, and with a little patience and observation, all  difficulties are easily overcome.  Great care must be taken to keep the  buff free from all extraneous matter, and perfectly dry, and when not  in use it should be wrapped up in tissue paper, or placed in a tight  box.    The plate should be buffed immediately before the sensitive coating is  given; particles of dust are thus effectually removed; the temperature  of the plate is also increased by the friction, and the required tint  more readily obtained.    SECOND OPERATION.--Applying the sensative coating.--The apparatus and  chemicals required, are an    Iodine box--see fig. 14 page 53.    Bromine box--similar to the iodine box but a trifle deeper.    Dry Iodine.    Bromine, or a compound of Bromine and Chloride of Iodine, or other  sensitive mixture.    Most of our best operators use the compound Bromine and Chloride of  Iodine.  In the early days of the Daguerreotype, Iodine alone was used  in preparing the plate, and although it still plays a very important  part, other"]]]
