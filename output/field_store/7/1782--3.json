Although the hour was growing late, sunset was still a long way off  and the prospect visible through the window was bathed in golden  light. From where I sat I could catch a glimpse of the tree-lined  road, and for the first time since that strange experience had  befallen me, I found myself wondering if the vaguely-perceived  follower whom I had detected on the previous night and those blazing  feline eyes which had looked out at me from beneath the shadow of the  hedge could have had any possible connection with the tragedy which at  about the same hour was being enacted in the Red House. I determined  presently to confide the strange particulars to my friend, but first I  was all anxiety to learn what evidence Marie had given; and that this  evidence, to which he had referred had done little more than to  increase Gatton's perplexity was clear enough from his expression.  Therefore:    \"Tell me about Marie,\" I said.    Gatton smiled grimly, took a drink from his glass, and then:    \"She began of course as I had anticipated, by denying all knowledge of  the matter, but recognizing that she was in a tight corner, she  presently changed her tactics, and although every available plan was  tried to induce her to change her ground, she afterwards stuck to the  extraordinary story which we first extracted from her. Briefly it was  this:    \"The late Sir Marcus had been paying unwelcome attention to Miss  Merlin for a long time, and Marie had instructions that he was to be  discouraged as much as possible. In fact I am pleased to say that your  theory of Miss Merlin's ignorance respecting the murder plot is borne  out by the testimony of her maid. On several occasions, it appears,  when he sent his card to the dressing-room, Marie returned equivocal  messages and did not even inform her mistress of Sir Marcus's visit.  This had been going on for some time when one night whilst Miss Merlin  was on the stage a telephone call came for Marie and a certain  proposal was made to her.    \"It was this: if on the following night Sir Marcus should present  himself she was to tell him that Miss Merlin would take supper in his  company after the performance, but that he was to observe every  possible precaution. Marie, according to her account, at first  declined to entertain the proposal, but being informed that it was  merely intended to play a practical joke upon the baronet, she  ultimately consented. I may add that the promise of a ten-pound note  undoubtedly hastened her decision and it was on her receipt of the  amount by post on the following morning that she determined to carry  out her part of the bargain.    \"Her instructions had been explicit. She was to tell Sir Marcus that  Miss Merlin would see him after the performance, then when he  presented himself, to inform him that her mistress had decided it  would be more prudent for him to proceed to the rendezvous alone,  where she would join him in a quarter of an hour. She was to give him  the door key (which had arrived with the money) and to direct him to  enter and wait in the room on the right of the hall. A cabman who knew  the address would be waiting at the stage door.\"    Gatton paused, puffing slowly at his pipe, then: \"Unknown to Miss  Merlin,\" he continued, \"this scheme was carried out. Sir Marcus  presented himself at ten o'clock and received Marie's message; he  returned about eleven and she told him, as she had been instructed,  that her mistress would join him in a quarter of an hour. Curiosity  respecting the joke which she believed was being played upon the  baronet prompted her to go outside the stage-door to see if there was  actually a cab waiting. There was, and she heard Sir Marcus ask the  man if he knew the address to which he was to drive.    \"The cabman replied that he did, and Marie claims to know no more  about the matter, except that Sir Marcus drove off in the cab, and  that her mistress returned to her flat alone about a quarter of an  hour later. Next point. Inquiries for the cabman have been made at all  the ranks since early this morning, and he turned up at the Yard about  a couple of hours ago. His story is simple enough; some one called up  the rank where he chanced to be standing that evening, instructing him  to call for Sir Marcus at the stage-door of the New Avenue Theater and  to drive him to--\"    He paused:    \"Yes?\"    \"To the Red House!\"    \"At last we have it!\" I cried excitedly.    \"There is no doubt of it,\" answered Gatton; \"the cabman drove him  there, and it was certainly at the Red House that he met his death.  Indeed the cabby appears to be the last witness who spoke to the  murdered man. He inquired his way to the Red House from a chance  pedestrian, a tramp, whom he met at the corner of College Road. He has  even described this person to us, but I don't think his evidence of  sufficient importance to justify our searching for him. On reaching  the Red House the cabman and his fare found it to be vacant. Sir  Marcus, however, who had a very brusk manner with his inferiors,  having paid the cabman, curtly dismissed him, and the man, who admits  having bargained for a double fare for the journey, because it was  such an out-of-the-way spot, drove away vaguely curious, but not so  curious as another might have been, since London cabmen are used to  strange jobs.\"    \"We are getting near the heart of the mystery.\"    \"H'm,\" said Gatton, \"I'm not so sure. The deeper we go the darker it  gets. A man has been scouring the neighborhood all day in quest of the  carter who delivered the crate to the docks, but so far without  results. I consider it a very important point that we should learn not  only how and when the crate was collected, but when and by whom it was  delivered at the garage.\"    \"Another question,\" I said: \"although I believe I know the answer. Was  it a man or a woman who ordered the cab?\"    \"Both in the case of Marie and in the case of the cab-rank,\" replied  Gatton, \"it was a woman's voice that spoke.\"    \"Thank God, one doubt is resolved!\" I said. \"It cannot possibly have  been Isobel in either of these cases!\"    \"Right!\" agreed Gatton, promptly. \"I am as glad as you are. There is  clearly a second woman in the case; yet I can't bring myself to  believe that this elaborate scheme was the work of a woman.\"    \"Not of a _jealous_ woman?\" I suggested.    \"Not of any woman,\" he replied. \"Besides--who put the body into the  crate? What kind of a woman would it be who could do a deed like  that?\"    \"In other words,\" said I, \"you are still without a ghost of a clew to  the identity of the person who committed the murder, and to the means  employed?\"    Resting his pipe upon an ash-tray, the Inspector took up from my  writing-table the little image of Bast and held it up between finger  and thumb.    \"We always come back to the green cat,\" he said slowly. \"I will  trouble you now, Mr. Addison, for the history of such a little image  as this.\"    \"Yes,\" I replied abstractedly. \"But there is a matter about which I  have not spoken to you hitherto because quite frankly I had doubted if  it had any existence outside my imagination; but every new development  of the case is so utterly fantastic that I no longer regard my  experience as being in the least degree outside the province of  possibility. Before we go further, therefore, into the purely  archaeological side of the inquiry (and I have still serious doubt  respecting the usefulness of such a quest) let me relate a peculiar  experience which I had last night after I had left Bolton.\"    Gatton listened in silence whilst I gave him an account of that  evasive shadow which I had perceived behind me, and then of the great  cat's eyes which had looked in through the window.    His expression of naive wonderment was almost funny; and when I had  concluded:    \"Well, Mr. Addison,\" said he, \"if you had told me this story before I  had taken up 'the _Oritoga_ mystery,' for so I observe--\" drawing an  evening paper from his pocket--\"the press has agreed to entitle the  case, I should have suggested that your peculiar studies had begun to  tell upon your nerves; but this voice on the 'phone and this empty  house in which only one room was furnished, finally the green cat  painted on the packing-case and the green cat which stands there upon  the table have prepared me for even stranger things than your  adventure of last night.\"    \"Yet,\" I urged, \"there is no visible connection between the episodes  of the case and this strange apparition which I saw in the garden last  night.\"    \"There was no visible connection between Sir Marcus's body in a  packing-case in the hold of the _Oritoga_ and the garage of the house  in College Road until we found one,\" retorted Gatton. \"Anyway I am  glad you mentioned the matter to me; I will take a note of it, for it  may prove to provide a link in the chain. And now\"--taking out a  note-book and pencil--\"for the history of these cat things.\"    I sighed rather wearily as I crossed the room to my bookcase and took  down the volume of Gaston Maspero, the same which I had been reading  but had returned to its shelf as Gatton had been admitted.    \"We have it here in a nutshell,\" I said.    Gatton methodically noted the passages which I read to him. The task  concluded:    \"H'm,\" he muttered, scanning his notes, \"very strange, very strange  indeed. 'She had also her hours of treacherous perversity, during  which she played with her victim as with a mouse, before finishing him  off with a blow of her claws.'\"    He raised his eyes and stared at me strangely.    \"She played with her victim as with a mouse,\" he murmured, \"before  finishing him off with a blow--\"          CHAPTER VIII    MY VISITOR      For long enough after Gatton's departure I sat thinking over our"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15344"],[0,"Grace Harlowe's Sophomore Year at High School (#10)"],[1,"similarity  between the two cases. That girl last year was untruthful and extremely  dishonorable. It is perfectly ridiculous to think of placing the blame for  those signals upon Anne. If the girls are silly enough to listen to  Miriam's insinuations, then they must choose between Miriam and me. Anne  is my dear friend, and I shall stick to her until the end.\"          CHAPTER VIII    THE PRICE OF FRIENDSHIP      It was a week before Dr. Gale pronounced Grace fit to return to school.  When she did make her appearance, she was hailed with delight by her  schoolmates and made much of. Miss Thompson greeted her warmly. She was  very fond of Grace, and had expressed great concern over the young girl's  accident. It was unusual for a girl to receive so serious an injury during  a game, as all rough play was strictly forbidden.    The principal had kept the members of both teams after school and  questioned them closely. No one had seen Grace fall, nor realized that she  was hurt until she had been discovered sitting on the gymnasium floor.  Miss Thompson had a vague suspicion of foul play on the part of the  juniors, but was unable to find out anything.    \"Athletics for girls have always been encouraged in this school,\" she had  said. \"Rough play is disgraceful. If I found that any member of any High  School basketball organization, either directly or indirectly, caused the  injury of an opponent, I should forbid basketball for the rest of the  season at least, and perhaps absolutely. Tripping, striking and kicking  are barred out of the boys' games and will certainly not be tolerated in  those of the girls.\"    As Grace was returning to the study hall from geometry recitation that  morning, she encountered Julia Crosby. Julia glanced at her with an  expression half fearful, half cunning, as though she wondered if Grace  knew the truth about her fall.    Grace returned the look with one of such quiet contempt and scorn that  Julia dropped her eyes and hurried along the corridor.    \"How could she have been so contemptible?\" thought Grace.    \"I wonder if she'll tell,\" thought Julia. \"She evidently knows I was  responsible for her tumble. My, what a look she gave me. I wonder if that  snippy little Anne Pierson knows about it, too. Very likely she does, for  Grace Harlowe tells her all her business. If they do say anything I'll  take good care no one believes it.\"    She was so absorbed in her own ruminations that she crashed into the  dignified president of the senior class with considerable force, much to  the glee of Nora, who happened to be near enough to catch the icy  expression on the senior's face as Julia mumbled an apology.    At recess Grace notified the members of the basketball team and their  substitutes that she had called a meeting to take place that afternoon at  three o'clock in the sophomore locker room. \"Only the basketball people  are requested to be present,\" she concluded, \"so don't bring any of the  rest of the class.\"    At three o'clock precisely the last member had arrived. Every girl took  particular pains to be there, for most of them had been at the Harlowe's  on the day that Grace had silenced Miriam.    The meeting promised to be one of interest, for had not Grace Harlowe said  that she would tell them something about the betrayed signals?    \"Girls,\" Grace began, \"you all know that although it is against the rules  to allow any outsider to witness our practice, we have always made an  exception in favor of Jessica. You all have perfect confidence in Jessica,  I am sure. Since practice began this fall we have allowed Anne to come to  it, too. You remember I asked permission for her to see the practice game,  because I knew her to be absolutely trustworthy.\"    Here Nora nodded emphatically, Miriam tossed her head and smiled  mockingly, while the rest of the girls looked a trifle mystified.    \"Anne,\" continued Grace, \"did not understand many of our plays, so I  wrote out a list of signals for her, to study and learn by heart, telling  her to destroy them as soon as she was sure she knew them. Unfortunately,  she lost them, and at once told me about it. She felt very unhappy over  it; but I told her not to worry, because I never supposed their loss would  make any difference.    \"When the game was well under way and the juniors began to block our  plays, it flashed across me that in some way they had found that list.  Anne, who has a mania for labeling everything, had written 'Sophomore  basketball signals' across the paper; so, of course, any one who found it  would know exactly what the list meant.    \"We were warned that the juniors held a meeting at the Omnibus House a day  or so before the game, and that they meant mischief. I never thought,  however, they would be quite so dishonorable.    \"I would have told you this before the game, but was afraid it would  confuse and worry you. I am sure that you will agree with me, and absolve  Anne from all blame.\"    \"I don't agree with you at all,\" flashed Miriam, \"and I am glad to have a  chance to speak my mind. I told you before the game that I objected to  Miss Pierson watching our practice, that it was against the rules, but no  attention was paid to what I said. If you had taken my advice the result  would have been far different. I have no doubt Grace believes that Miss  Pierson lost the list, but I am not so easily deceived. I believe she  deliberately handed it over to the juniors, and every loyal member of the  team should cut her acquaintance.\"    \"Miriam Nesbit,\" cried Nora. \"You haven't the least right to accuse Anne  Pierson of any such thing. She is too honorable to think of it, and she  has no love for the junior class either. She isn't even friendly with  them. If any one is to be accused of treachery, I should say that there  are members of the team far more friendly with the juniors than poor  little Anne.\"    This was a direct slap at Miriam, who winced a little at Nora's words.    \"Well,\" said Marian Barber quickly, \"it stands to reason that no member of  the team would be foolish enough to help the enemy. I don't know anything  about Miss Pierson, but I do know that I overheard Julia Crosby telling  some girl in her class that the sophomores could thank one of their own  class for their defeat.\"    \"When did you hear her say that?\" queried Miriam sharply.    \"Yesterday morning. I was walking behind her, and she was so busy talking  she didn't notice me.\"    \"You girls can draw your own conclusions,\" said Miriam triumphantly. \"That  simply proves what I have said.\"    \"That simply proves nothing at all,\" exclaimed Grace Harlowe, who had been  too angry to trust herself to speak. \"You are making a very serious charge  against Anne without one bit of ground on which to base your suspicions.  You have always disliked her because she won the freshman prize, and you  know nothing whatever against her.\"    \"No,\" said Miriam scornfully, \"nor anything to her credit either. Who is  she, anyway? The daughter of a strolling third-rate actor, who goes  barnstorming about the country, and she has been on the stage, too. She  has a very good opinion of herself since Mrs. Gray and certain Oakdale  girls took her up, but I wouldn't trust her as far as I could see her. Why  should girls of good Oakdale families be forced to associate with such  people? I suppose she wanted to be on good terms with the juniors, too,  and took that method of gaining her point.\"    \"That is pure nonsense,\" exclaimed Nora. \"Don't you think so, girls?\"    But the other girls made no reply. They were thinking hard. Suspicion  seemed to point in Anne's direction. What a pity Grace had been so rash  about taking Anne up if her father were a common actor. Miriam was right  about not caring to associate with Anne. After all, they knew very little  about her. Grace Harlowe was always picking queer people and trying to  help them.    \"I think we ought to be very careful about taking outsiders into our  confidence,\" firmly said Eva Allen, one of the team. \"I didn't know Miss  Pierson had ever been an actress.\" There was a note of horror in her voice  as she pronounced the last word.    \"I have always heard that they were very unreliable people,\" said another  miss of sixteen.    Grace was in despair. She felt that she had lost. By dragging up Anne's  unfortunate family history, Miriam had produced a bad impression that she  was powerless to efface.    \"Girls,\" she said, \"you ought to be ashamed of yourselves. You know  perfectly well that Anne is innocent. If you wish to be my friend you must  be Anne's also. Please say that you believe her.\"    \"Count on me,\" said Nora.    But the other sophomores had nothing to say.    Grace looked about her appealingly, only to meet cold looks and averted  faces. Miriam was smiling openly.    \"The meeting is adjourned,\" said Grace shortly, and without another word  she went to her locker and began taking out her wraps. Nora followed her,  but the majority of the girls walked over to the other end of the room and  began to talk in low tones with Miriam.    Grace realized that her team had deserted her for Miriam. It was almost  unbelievable. She set her lips and winked hard to keep back the tears  which rose to her eyes. Then, followed by her one faithful friend, she  walked out of the locker room, leaving her fickle classmates with their  chosen leader.          CHAPTER IX    AN UNSUCCESSFUL INTERVIEW      There were two subjects of interest under discussion in the sophomore  class. One was the coming ball, the other the story of the lost signals,  which had gone the round of the class. The general opinion seemed to be  that Anne had betrayed the team, and with the unthinking cruelty of youth,  the girls had resolved to teach her a lesson. Miriam's accusation had been  repeated from one girl to another, with unconscious additions, until Anne  loomed up in the light of a traitor, and was treated accordingly.    Grace had"]]]
