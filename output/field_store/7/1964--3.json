This instrument  belongs to the physician, not to the singer.    The importance of the third factor, the _resonator_, has been  considered in Chapter V, on Resonance, but the fourth element in voice  production, _articulation_, is so cooerdinated to resonance that the  significance and primacy of the latter are too often overlooked.    Placing or \"focusing the voice\" I have found to be chiefly a matter  of control and use of the resonator, consisting of chest, pharynx,  mouth, and the nasal and head cavities.    A tone lacking in resonance is ineffective,--devoid of carrying  power,--is diffuse and unfocused; while a resonant tone, no matter how  soft dynamically, has carrying power and is focused in its vibration.    Now \"voice placing\" depends primarily on correct _vowel placing_,  which in turn depends on proper adjustment of the resonators, which  again depends chiefly on the positions and motions of the organs of  articulation. The interdependence of tone quality and pronunciation is  therefore obvious.    Constant emphasis must be laid upon the fact that focusing a tone is a  matter of resonance, and that perhaps the most important element in  this is _nasal_ resonance. In this country, particularly, teachers  have, in their desire to overcome the too common nasal twang,  mistakenly sought to shut out the nasal chamber from all participation  in speech and song.    There are those who, partly recognizing the importance of _head_  resonance, would secure it while ignoring _nasal_ resonance. It is  impossible to secure head resonance in this fashion, for it is only  through free nasal resonance that the cooerdinate resonance in the air  sinuses above the nasal cavity and connected with it can be  established.    The fear of nasal twang and failure to distinguish between it and true  nasal resonance has been the stumbling block. They are very  different,--one is to be shunned, the other to be cultivated. The  first is an obvious blemish, the second is an important essential of  good singing.    Nasal tones are caused by a raised or stiffened tongue, a sagging soft  palate, a stiffened jaw, or by other rigidities that prevent free tone  emission and which at the same time--note this--prevent true nasal  resonance.    As tone, or vocalized breath, issues from the larynx, it is divided  into two streams or currents by the pendent veil of the soft palate.  One stream flows directly into the mouth, where it produces oral  resonance; the other stream passes through the nasopharynx into the  hollow chambers of the face and head, inducing nasal and head  resonance.    It is commonly supposed that tone passing in whole or in part through  the nasal cavities must be nasal in quality; whereas a tone of  objectionable nasal quality can be sung equally well with the nostrils  either closed or open.    Browne and Behnke state the matter thus: \"However tight the closure of  the soft palate may be, it is never sufficient to prevent the air in  the nasal cavities being thrown into co-vibrations with that in the  mouth. These co-vibrations are, in fact, necessary for a certain  amount of the brilliancy of the voice, and if they are prevented by a  stoppage of the posterior openings of the nasal passages, the voice  will sound dull and muffled. This is of course due, to an _absence of  nasal resonance_, and must on no account be described as nasal  _twang_. It is, indeed, the very opposite of it.\"    Nasal tone quality and nasal resonance must not be confounded. A nasal  tone is constricted, while a tone with nasal resonance is free. Again,  a tone may be unmarred by the nasal quality, yet if it lacks nasal  resonance it lacks vibrancy, carrying power.    Nasal tones are produced, not because the vibrations pass through the  nasal passage, but because they are obstructed in their passage  through them. A nasal tone is always a cramped tone, due to  impediment, tension, or muscular contraction, particularly in the  nasopharynx.    The congestion and consequent thickening of the mucous membrane lining  the cavities of the nose and head, resulting from a cold, make the  tone muffled and weak, owing to the inability of the parts to respond  to the vibrations and add to the tone normal nasal resonance.    The elder Booth (Junius Brutus), about 1838, suffered from a broken  nose which defaced his handsome visage and spoiled his splendid voice.  His disability was so great that afterward he seldom played. That the  cause of this impairment of Booth's voice was due to the contraction  and more or less complete obstruction of the nasal passages is too  evident to call for comment.    Many singers have sweet but characterless voices that lack the  fulness, power, and ring they might have because they fail to avail  themselves of the augmenting power of the resonance cavities. The  singer must learn to habitually use all of the resonance cavities and  use them simultaneously.    Lilli Lehmann, in _How to Sing_, says that, \"although the nasal sound  can be exaggerated,--which rarely happens,--it can be much  neglected,--something that very often happens.\" The context makes  clear that what in the English translation of the great singer's book  is called \"nasal sound\" is exactly what we term _nasal resonance_.    After charging the monotonous quality or lack of color in the voice of  a famous opera star to lack of nasal resonance, Madame Lehmann speaks  of the consummate art of Marcella Sembrich who \"in recent years  appears to have devoted very special study to nasal resonance, whereby  her voice, especially in the middle register, has gained greatly in  warmth.\" She says further that nasal resonance \"cannot be studied  enough. It ought always to be employed.\" \"How often,\" she says, \"have  I heard young singers say, 'I no longer have the power to respond to  the demands made upon me,' whereas the trouble lies only in the  insufficient use of the resonance of the head cavities.\"    From the foregoing, the conclusion follows that the head vibrations  are not only an essential element, but that nasal resonance is a most  important element in imparting to tone its brilliance and carrying  power. Without thought of the mechanism of _how_ nasal resonance is  produced, the singer has control over it by direct influence of the  will. The tones, low as well as high, should seem to start in the nose  and head, and the vibrations of the perfect tone can be plainly felt  upon any part of the nose and head. Without the head vibrations no  tone can be perfect, for nothing else will compensate for the lack of  these. Vocal organs used as here described will suffer no fatigue  from reasonable use; hoarseness will be to them a thing unknown, and  \"minister's sore throat\" an unheard of complaint. Not only is faulty  voice production a source of great discomfort, but it is the cause of  many diseases of the chest, throat, and head.    The gentle practice in easy range of the exercises given in the  chapter following, will do much to restore a normal condition.          CHAPTER VIII    PLACING THE VOICE      What is called \"placing the voice\" or \"tone production\" or \"focusing  the voice\" is, as already stated in the previous chapter, chiefly a  matter of resonance--of control of the resonator. Now vocalization is  largely vowelization, and vocal tones are a complex of sound and  resonance. The character of a vowel is given it by the shape of the  vowel chamber; and the shaping of the vowel chamber depends upon  delicate adjustment of the movable parts,--jaw, lips, cheeks, tongue,  veil of the palate, and pharynx. While this adjustment is made through  more or less conscious muscular action, the parts must never be forced  into position; local effort to this end will invariably defeat itself.  The important consideration in all voice movements is a flexible,  _natural_ action of all the parts, and all the voice movements are so  closely allied, so sympathetically related, that if one movement is  constrained the others cannot be free. It is a happy fact that _the  right way is the easiest way_, and a fundamental truth that =right  effort is the result of right thought=. From these axiomatic principles  we deduce the very first rule for the singer and speaker,--=THINK the  right tone, mentally picture it; then concentrate upon the picture,  not upon the mechanism=.      WHEN IS THE VOCAL ACTION CORRECT?    There are two sound criterions for judging the correctness of vocal  action,--first, the _ease_ of the action, its naturalness, its  flexibility. As Mills concisely states it: \"He sings or speaks best  who attains the end with the least expenditure of energy.\" Second, the  _beauty_ of the result. Harsh, unlovely tones are a sure indication of  misplaced effort, of tension somewhere, of wrong action. On the other  hand the nearer the tones approach to perfection the closer does the  organism come to correct action. _Beauty of tone_, then, is the truest  indication of proper vocal action.    Judgment as to the relative beauty of a tone depends on the training  of the ear. Pupils should habitually listen to their own voices, for  between the hearing and feeling of the voice a knowledge of progress  can be obtained. The function of the ear in governing voice production  is thus stated by Prof. Mills: \"The nervous impulses that pass from  the ear to the brain are the most important guides in determining the  necessary movements.\" Mr. Ffrangcon-Davies maintains that, \"The  training of the ear is one-half of the training of the voice.\" The  student should improve every opportunity to hear the best singers and  speakers, for both consciously and unconsciously we learn much by  imitation. Good examples are often our best teachers.    Keeping well in mind the principles stated above, we are now ready to  begin their application in placing the voice--that is, in setting it  free--not by learning some strange and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19142"],[0,"The Devil Doctor (#10)"],[1," yards beyond.    From the miniature jungle bordering the path, a soft whistle sounded.    \"Is that Carter?\" called Smith sharply.    A shadowy figure uprose, and vaguely I made it out for that of a man  in the unobtrusive blue serge which is the undress uniform of the  Force.    \"Well?\" rapped my companion.    \"Mr. Slattin returned ten minutes ago, sir,\" reported the constable.  \"He came in a cab which he dismissed--\"    \"He has not left again?\"    \"A few minutes after his return,\" the man continued, \"another cab came  up, and a lady alighted.\"    \"A lady!\"    \"The same, sir, that has called upon him before.\"    \"Smith!\" I whispered, plucking at his arm--\"is it--?\"    He half turned, nodding his head; and my heart began to throb  foolishly. For now the manner of Slattin's campaign suddenly was  revealed to me. In our operations against the Chinese murder-group two  years before, we had had an ally in the enemy's camp--Karamaneh, the  beautiful slave, whose presence in those happenings of the past had  coloured the sometimes sordid drama with the opulence of old Arabia;  who had seemed a fitting figure for the romances of Bagdad during the  Caliphate--Karamaneh, whom I had thought sincere, whose inscrutable  Eastern soul I had presumed, fatuously, to have laid bare and  analysed.    Now once again she was plying her old trade of go-between; professing  to reveal the secrets of Dr. Fu-Manchu, and all the time--I could not  doubt it--inveigling men into the net of this awful fisher.    Yesterday, I had been her dupe; yesterday, I had rejoiced in my  captivity. To-day, I was not the favoured one; to-day I had not been  selected recipient of her confidences--confidences sweet, seductive,  deadly: but Abel Slattin, a plausible rogue, who, in justice, should  be immured in Sing Sing, was chosen out, was enslaved by those lovely  mysterious eyes, was taking to his soul the lies which fell from those  perfect lips, triumphant in a conquest that must end in his undoing;  deeming, poor fool, that for love of him this pearl of the Orient was  about to betray her master, to resign herself a prize to the victor!    Companioned by these bitter reflections, I had lost the remainder of  the conversation between Nayland Smith and the police officer; now,  casting off the succubus memory which threatened to obsess me, I put  forth a giant mental effort to purge my mind of this uncleanness, and  became again an active participant in the campaign against the  Master--the director of all things noxious.    Our plans being evidently complete, Smith seized my arm, and I found  myself again out upon the avenue. He led me across the road and into  the gate of a house almost opposite. From the fact that two upper  windows were illuminated, I adduced that the servants were retiring;  the other windows were in darkness, except for one on the ground floor  to the extreme left of the building, through the lowered venetian  blinds whereof streaks of light shone out.    \"Slattin's study!\" whispered Smith. \"He does not anticipate  surveillance, and you will note that the window is wide open!\"    With that my friend crossed the strip of lawn, and, careless of the  fact that his silhouette must have been visible to any one passing the  gate, climbed carefully up the artificial rockery intervening, and  crouched upon the window-ledge peering into the room.    A moment I hesitated, fearful that if I followed I should stumble or  dislodge some of the lava blocks of which the rockery was composed.    Then I heard that which summoned me to the attempt, whatever the cost.    Through the open window came the sound of a musical voice--a voice  possessing a haunting accent, possessing a quality which struck upon  my heart and set it quivering as though it were a gong hung in my  bosom.    Karamaneh was speaking.    Upon hands and knees, heedless of damage to my garments, I crawled up  beside Smith. One of the laths was slightly displaced and over this my  friend was peering in. Crouching close beside him, I peered in also.    I saw the study of a business man, with its files, neatly arranged  works of reference, roll-top desk, and Milner safe. Before the desk,  in a revolving chair, sat Slattin. He sat half-turned towards the  window, leaning back and smiling; so that I could note the gold crown  which preserved the lower left molar. In an armchair by the window,  close, very close, and sitting with her back to me, was Karamaneh!    She, who, in my dreams, I always saw, was ever seeing, in an Eastern  dress, with gold bands about her white ankles, with jewel-laden  fingers, with jewels in her hair, wore now a fashionable costume and a  hat that could only have been produced in Paris. Karamaneh was the one  Oriental woman I had ever known who could wear European clothes; and  as I watched that exquisite profile, I thought that Delilah must have  been just such another as this; that, excepting the Empress Poppae,  history has record of no woman who, looking so innocent, was yet so  utterly vile.    \"Yes, my dear,\" Slattin was saying, and through his monocle ogling his  beautiful visitor, \"I shall be ready for you to-morrow night.\"    I felt Smith start at the words.    \"There will be a sufficient number of men?\"    Karamaneh put the question in a strangely listless way.    \"My dear little girl,\" replied Slattin, rising and standing looking  down at her, with his gold tooth twinkling in the lamplight, \"there  will be a whole division, if a whole division is necessary.\"    He sought to take her white gloved hand, which rested upon the chair  arm; but she evaded the attempt with seeming artlessness, and stood  up. Slattin fixed his bold gaze upon her.    \"So now, give me my orders,\" he said.    \"I am not prepared to do so, yet,\" replied the girl composedly; \"but  now that I know you are ready, I can make my plans.\"    She glided past him to the door, avoiding his outstretched arm with an  artless art which made me writhe; for once I had been the willing  victim of all these wiles.    \"But--\" began Slattin.    \"I will ring you up in less than half an hour,\" said Karamaneh; and  without further ceremony, she opened the door.    I still had my eyes glued to the aperture in the blind, when Smith  began tugging at my arm.    \"Down! you fool!\" he hissed sharply; \"if she sees us, all is lost!\"    Realizing this, and none too soon, I turned, and rather clumsily  followed my friend. I dislodged a piece of granite in my descent; but,  fortunately Slattin had gone out into the hall and could not well have  heard it.    We were crouching around an angle of the house, when a flood of light  poured down the steps, and Karamaneh rapidly descended. I had a  glimpse of a dark-faced man who evidently had opened the door for her;  then all my thoughts were centred upon that graceful figure receding  from me in the direction of the avenue. She wore a loose cloak, and I  saw this fluttering for a moment against the white gate-posts; then  she was gone.    Yet Smith did not move. Detaining me with his hand he crouched there  against a quick-set hedge; until, from a spot lower down the hill, we  heard the start of the cab, which had been waiting. Twenty seconds  elapsed, and from some other distant spot a second cab started.    \"That's Weymouth!\" snapped Smith. \"With decent luck, we should know  Fu-Manchu's hiding-place before Slattin tells us!\"    \"But--\"    \"Oh! as it happens he's apparently playing the game.\" In the  half-light, Smith stared at me significantly. \"Which makes it all the  more important,\" he concluded, \"that we should not rely upon his aid!\"    Those grim words were prophetic.    My companion made no attempt to communicate with the detective (or  detectives) who shared our vigil; we took up a position close under  the lighted study window and waited--waited.    Once, a taxi-cab laboured hideously up the steep gradient of the  avenue.... It was gone. The lights at the upper windows above us  became extinguished. A policeman tramped past the gateway, casually  flashing his lamp in at the opening. One by one the illuminated  windows in other houses visible to us became dull; then lived again as  mirrors for the pallid moon. In the silence, words spoken within the  study were clearly audible; and we heard some one--presumably the man  who had opened the door--inquire if his services would be wanted again  that night.    Smith inclined his head and hung over me in a tense attitude, in order  to catch Slattin's reply.    \"Yes, Burke,\" it came, \"I want you to sit up until I return; I shall  be going out shortly.\"    Evidently the man withdrew at that; for a complete silence followed  which prevailed for fully half an hour. I sought cautiously to move my  cramped limbs, unlike Smith, who seeming to have sinews of piano-wire,  crouched beside me immovable, untiringly. Then loud upon the  stillness, broke the strident note of the telephone bell.    I started, nervously, clutching at Smith's arm. It felt hard as iron  to my grip.    \"Hullo!\" I heard Slattin call, \"who is speaking?... Yes, yes! This is  Mr. A. S.... I am to come at once?... I know where--yes!... You will  meet me there?... Good!--I shall be with you in half an hour....  Good-bye!\"    Distinctly I heard the creak of the revolving office-chair as Slattin  rose; then Smith had me by the arm, and we were flying swiftly away  from the door to take up our former post around the angle of the  building. This gained--    \"He's going to his death!\" rapped Smith beside me; \"but Carter has a  cab from the Yard waiting in the nearest rank. We shall follow to see  where he goes--for it is possible that Weymouth may have been thrown  off the scent; then, when we are sure of his destination, we can take  a hand in the game! We--\"    The end of the sentence was lost to me--drowned in such a frightful  wave of sound as I despair to describe. It began with a high, thin  scream, which was choked off staccato fashion; upon it"]]]
