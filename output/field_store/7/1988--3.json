Hostjoghon stepped to the head of the rainbow goddess and taking  the small gourd of medicine water dipped the cedar twig into the water and  sprinkled the figures, then touched the twig to the feet, heart, and head  of each figure, commencing at the male figure to the north and passing  south, then beginning with the female figures to the north and passing  south. The invalid took his seat in the center of the painting with his  knees drawn to his chin. Hostjoghon held the medicine gourd over each  figure and passed it to the invalid, who took four sips, Hostjoghon  hooting each time he passed the gourd to the invalid. After returning the  gourd and twig to their former position he placed the palms of his hands  to the feet and head of each figure and then placed his palms on the  corresponding parts of the invalid's body, and pressed his head several  times between his hands. After touching any part of the invalid,  Hostjoghon threw his hands upward and gave one of his characteristic  hoots. The song-priest placed coals in front of the invalid and herbs upon  them, as he had done the day before, and then retired. The coals were  afterwards thrown out of the fire opening and the crowd rushed to the  painting to rub their bodies with the sand. The painting was obliterated  in the usual manner and the sand carried out and deposited at the base of  a pinon tree some 200 yards from the lodge.                                  [Illustration]            EIGHTH DAY.      The grinding of the paint began at daylight, and just at sunrise the  artists commenced their work. When any mistake occurred, which was very  seldom, it was obliterated by sifting the ground color over it. Each  artist endeavored to finish his special design first, and there was  considerable betting as to who would succeed. The rapidity with which  these paints are handled is quite remarkable, particularly as most of the  lines are drawn entirely by the eye. After the completion of the painting,  each figure being three and a half feet long, corn pollen was sprinkled  over the whole by the song priest. (See illustration, Pl. CXXIII.)    The corn stalk in the picture signifies the main subsistence of life; the  square base and triangle are clouds, and the three white lines at the base  of the corn stalk denote the roots of the corn. The figures of this  picture are each 3-1/2 feet in length. These are the Zenichi (people of  the white rock with a red streak through it) and their wives. Their homes  are high in the canyon wall. The black parallelogram to the west of the  painting designates a red streak in the rock in which are their homes. The  delicate white lines indicate their houses, which are in the interior or  depths of the rock, and can not be seen from the surface. This canyon wall  is located north of the Ute Mountain. These people of the rocks move in  the air like birds. The red portion of the bodies of the Zenichi denote  red corn; the black portion black clouds. The red half of the face  represents also the red corn; the blue of the bodies of the others denote  vegetation in general, and the yellow, pollen of all vegetation. The  zigzag lines of the bodies is lightning; the black lines around the head,  zigzagged with white, are cloud baskets that hold red corn, which is  stacked in pyramidal form and capped with three eagle plumes. There are  five feathers of the red and black shafted flicker (_Colapteo cafer_) on  either side of the head. A lightning bow is held in the left hand, the  right holds a rattle ornamented with feathers. The females carry in their  hands decorated baskets and sprigs of pinon, and they wear white leggings  and beaded moccasins. The Zenichi never dance. These gods are also called  Zaadoljaii, meaning rough mouth, or anything that protrudes roughly from  the mouth. (The mouth and eyes of these gods protrude.) The rainbow  goddess is represented at the north and south end of the painting. The  corn stalk has two ears of corn, while the original stalk had 12 ears. Two  of these ears the gods gave to the younger brother of the Tolchini when  they commanded him to return to the Navajo and instruct them how to  represent the gods in sand painting and in masks. The four corner figures  will be recognized as the Naashiddi (hunchback, or mountain sheep).                                  [Illustration]      During the ceremony Hasjelti, dressed in black velvet ornamented with  silver, and Hostjoboard, with her nude body painted white and with silk  scarf around the loins caught on with silver belt, left the lodge to  gather the children upon the mesa for the purpose of initiating them; but  the children had already been summoned by men who rode over the mesa on  horseback, visiting every hogan to see that all the children were brought  for initiation. A buffalo robe was spread at the end of the avenue which  extended from the medicine lodge some three hundred yards. The head of the  robe was to the east; at the end of the robe blankets were spread in a  kind of semicircle. Most of the children were accompanied by their  mothers. The boys were stripped of their clothing and sat upon the buffalo  robe. The head of the line being to the north, they all faced east with  their feet stretched out. Their arms hung by their sides and their heads  were bent forward. The girls sat in line upon the blanket in company with  their mothers and the mothers of the boys. It is entirely a matter of  choice whether or not a mother accompanies her child or takes any part in  the ceremony. The girls also sat like the boys, their heads bent forward.  Their heads were bent down that they might not look upon the gods until  they had been initiated. Up to this time they were supposed never to have  had a close view of the masks or to have inspected anything pertaining to  their religious ceremonies. The children ranged from five to ten years of  age. At this particular ceremony nine boys and six girls were initiated.  When the children were all in position, Hasjelti, carrying a fawn skin  containing sacred meal, and Hostjoboard, carrying two needles of the  Spanish bayonet, stood in front of the children. The boy at the head of  the line was led out and stood facing the east. Hasjelti, with the sacred  meal, formed a cross on his breast, at the same time giving his peculiar  hoot. Hostjoboard struck him upon the breast, first with the needles held  in her right hand and then with those held in the left. Hasjelti then  turned the boy toward the right until he faced west and made a cross with  meal upon his back, when Hostjoboard struck him twice on the back with the  needles. He was again turned to face the east, when both arms were  extended and brought together. Hasjelti made a cross over the arms and  then over the knees. Each time the boy was crossed with the meal  Hostjoboard struck the spot first with the needles in the right hand and  then with those in the left, after which the boy returned to his seat. The  cross denotes the scalp knot. Most of the boys advanced quite bravely to  receive the chastisement. I noticed but one who seemed very nervous, and  with great difficulty he kept back the tears. The boys' ceremony over, the  gods approached the girls, beginning at the end of the line next to the  boys. Hasjelti marked a line of meal on each side of the foot of the girl,  when Hostjoboard, now holding two ears of yellow corn wrapped with pinon  twigs, placed them to the soles of the girl's feet and Hasjelti drew a  line of meal on each hand; after which Hostjoboard placed the ears of corn  to the palms of the hands, she holding the corn in her palms and pressing  it to the palms of the girl's hands. Hasjelti formed a cross on the breast  with the meal and Hostjoboard pressed the two ears of corn to the breast;  a cross was made on the back and the two ears of corn pressed to the back.  Hasjelti, with his right hand, then drew a line on the girl's left  shoulder, and with his left hand a line on the girl's right shoulder, the  corn being pressed to the shoulders in the manner described. Two lines of  meal were run over the forehead back to the top of the head, and the two  ears of corn pressed to the top of head. The boys were nude but the girls  were gayly dressed in blankets, jewelry, etc. At the close of this  ceremony the representatives of the gods removed their masks and called  upon the children to raise their heads. The amazement depicted upon the  faces of the children when they discovered their own people and not gods  afforded much amusement to the spectators. The masks were laid upon a  blanket and the girls and boys were commanded to look upon them.  Hostjoboard placed her mask upon the face of each boy and girl and woman  in the line, beginning at the north end of the line, giving a hoot each  time the mask was placed upon anyone. Great care was taken that the mask  should be so arranged upon the face that the eyes might look directly  through the eyeholes, for should any blunder occur the sight of at least  one eye would be lost. It is scarcely on before it is removed. After the  masks had been placed on all the faces it was laid beside Hasjelti's. The  man personating Hasjelti sprinkled his mask and then Hostjoboard's with  pollen, and the man personating Hostjoboard sprinkled Hasjelti's mask and  then his own with pollen. The boy to the north end of the line was called  out and from the pollen bag took a pinch of pollen and sprinkled first the  mask of Hasjelti and then Hostioboard's. This was repeated by each boy,  girl, and woman in the line. In approaching the masks they always pass  back of the line around to the north side and then step in front of the  masks. The mask is sprinkled in this wise: A line of pollen is run from  the top of the head down to the mouth; passing around to the right the  line is drawn"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19337"],[0,"A Christmas Carol (#10)"],[1,"on the Seventh Day,\" said Scrooge. \"And  it comes to the same thing.\"    \"_I_ seek!\" exclaimed the Spirit.    \"Forgive me if I am wrong. It has been done in your name, or at least in  that of your family,\" said Scrooge.    \"There are some upon this earth of yours,\" returned the Spirit, \"who lay  claim to know us, and who do their deeds of passion, pride, ill-will,  hatred, envy, bigotry, and selfishness in our name, who are as strange  to us, and all our kith and kin, as if they had never lived. Remember  that, and charge their doings on themselves, not us.\"    Scrooge promised that he would; and they went on, invisible, as they  had been before, into the suburbs of the town. It was a remarkable  quality of the Ghost (which Scrooge had observed at the baker's), that,  notwithstanding his gigantic size, he could accommodate himself to any  place with ease; and that he stood beneath a low roof quite as  gracefully and like a supernatural creature as it was possible he could  have done in any lofty hall.    And perhaps it was the pleasure the good Spirit had in showing off this  power of his, or else it was his own kind, generous, hearty nature, and  his sympathy with all poor men, that led him straight to Scrooge's  clerk's; for there he went, and took Scrooge with him, holding to his  robe; and, on the threshold of the door, the Spirit smiled, and stopped  to bless Bob Cratchit's dwelling with the sprinklings of his torch.  Think of that! Bob had but fifteen \"Bob\" a week himself; he pocketed on  Saturdays but fifteen copies of his Christian name; and yet the Ghost of  Christmas Present blessed his four-roomed house!    Then up rose Mrs. Cratchit, Cratchit's wife, dressed out but poorly in a  twice-turned gown, but brave in ribbons, which are cheap, and make a  goodly show for sixpence; and she laid the cloth, assisted by Belinda  Cratchit, second of her daughters, also brave in ribbons; while Master  Peter Cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes, and,  getting the corners of his monstrous shirt collar (Bob's private  property, conferred upon his son and heir in honour of the day) into his  mouth, rejoiced to find himself so gallantly attired, and yearned to  show his linen in the fashionable Parks. And now two smaller Cratchits,  boy and girl, came tearing in, screaming that outside the baker's they  had smelt the goose, and known it for their own; and, basking in  luxurious thoughts of sage and onion, these young Cratchits danced about  the table, and exalted Master Peter Cratchit to the skies, while he (not  proud, although his collars nearly choked him) blew the fire, until the  slow potatoes, bubbling up, knocked loudly at the saucepan lid to be let  out and peeled.    \"What has ever got your precious father, then?\" said Mrs. Cratchit. \"And  your brother, Tiny Tim? And Martha warn't as late last Christmas-day by  half an hour!\"    \"Here's Martha, mother!\" said a girl, appearing as she spoke.    \"Here's Martha, mother!\" cried the two young Cratchits. \"Hurrah! There's  _such_ a goose, Martha!\"    \"Why, bless your heart alive, my dear, how late you are!\" said Mrs.  Cratchit, kissing her a dozen times, and taking off her shawl and bonnet  for her with officious zeal.    \"We'd a deal of work to finish up last night,\" replied the girl, \"and  had to clear away this morning, mother!\"    \"Well! never mind so long as you are come,\" said Mrs. Cratchit. \"Sit ye  down before the fire, my dear, and have a warm, Lord bless ye!\"    \"No, no! There's father coming,\" cried the two young Cratchits, who were  everywhere at once. \"Hide, Martha, hide!\"    So Martha hid herself, and in came little Bob, the father, with at least  three feet of comforter, exclusive of the fringe, hanging down before  him; and his threadbare clothes darned up and brushed to look  seasonable; and Tiny Tim upon his shoulder. Alas for Tiny Tim, he bore a  little crutch, and had his limbs supported by an iron frame!    \"Why, where's our Martha?\" cried Bob Cratchit, looking round.    \"Not coming,\" said Mrs. Cratchit.    \"Not coming!\" said Bob with a sudden declension in his high spirits; for  he had been Tim's blood horse all the way from church, and had come home  rampant. \"Not coming upon Christmas-day!\"    Martha didn't like to see him disappointed, if it were only in joke; so  she came out prematurely from behind the closet door, and ran into his  arms, while the two young Cratchits hustled Tiny Tim, and bore him off  into the wash-house, that he might hear the pudding singing in the  copper.    \"And how did little Tim behave?\" asked Mrs. Cratchit when she had  rallied Bob on his credulity, and Bob had hugged his daughter to his  heart's content.    \"As good as gold,\" said Bob, \"and better. Somehow, he gets thoughtful,  sitting by himself so much, and thinks the strangest things you ever  heard. He told me, coming home, that he hoped the people saw him in the  church, because he was a cripple, and it might be pleasant to them to  remember upon Christmas-day who made lame beggars walk and blind men  see.\"    Bob's voice was tremulous when he told them this, and trembled more when  he said that Tiny Tim was growing strong and hearty.    His active little crutch was heard upon the floor, and back came Tiny  Tim before another word was spoken, escorted by his brother and sister  to his stool beside the fire; and while Bob, turning up his cuffs--as  if, poor fellow, they were capable of being made more shabby--compounded  some hot mixture in a jug with gin and lemons, and stirred it round and  round, and put it on the hob to simmer, Master Peter and the two  ubiquitous young Cratchits went to fetch the goose, with which they soon  returned in high procession.    Such a bustle ensued that you might have thought a goose the rarest of  all birds; a feathered phenomenon, to which a black swan was a matter of  course--and, in truth, it was something very like it in that house. Mrs.  Cratchit made the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan) hissing  hot; Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour; Miss  Belinda sweetened up the apple sauce; Martha dusted the hot plates; Bob  took Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny corner at the table; the two young  Cratchits set chairs for everybody, not forgetting themselves, and,  mounting guard upon their posts, crammed spoons into their mouths, lest  they should shriek for goose before their turn came to be helped. At  last the dishes were set on, and grace was said. It was succeeded by a  breathless pause, as Mrs. Cratchit, looking slowly all along the  carving-knife, prepared to plunge it in the breast; but when she did,  and when the long-expected gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur of  delight arose all round the board, and even Tiny Tim, excited by the two  young Cratchits, beat on the table with the handle of his knife, and  feebly cried Hurrah!    There never was such a goose. Bob said he didn't believe there ever was  such a goose cooked. Its tenderness and flavour, size and cheapness,  were the themes of universal admiration. Eked out by apple sauce and  mashed potatoes, it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family;  indeed, as Mrs. Cratchit said with great delight (surveying one small  atom of a bone upon the dish), they hadn't ate it all at last! Yet every  one had had enough, and the youngest Cratchits, in particular, were  steeped in sage and onion to the eyebrows! But now, the plates being  changed by Miss Belinda, Mrs. Cratchit left the room alone--too nervous  to bear witnesses--to take the pudding up, and bring it in.    Suppose it should not be done enough! Suppose it should break in turning  out! Suppose somebody should have got over the wall of the back-yard and  stolen it, while they were merry with the goose--a supposition at which  the two young Cratchits became livid! All sorts of horrors were  supposed.    Hallo! A great deal of steam! The pudding was out of the copper. A smell  like a washing-day! That was the cloth. A smell like an eating-house and  a pastrycook's next door to each other, with a laundress's next door to  that! That was the pudding! In half a minute Mrs. Cratchit  entered--flushed, but smiling proudly--with the pudding, like a speckled  cannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half of half-a-quartern of  ignited brandy, and bedight with Christmas holly stuck into the top.    Oh, a wonderful pudding! Bob Cratchit said, and calmly too, that he  regarded it as the greatest success achieved by Mrs. Cratchit since  their marriage. Mrs. Cratchit said that, now the weight was off her  mind, she would confess she had her doubts about the quantity of flour.  Everybody had something to say about it, but nobody said or thought it  was at all a small pudding for a large family. It would have been flat  heresy to do so. Any Cratchit would have blushed to hint at such a  thing.    At last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the hearth  swept, and the fire made up. The compound in the jug being tasted, and  considered perfect, apples and oranges were put upon the table, and a  shovel full of chestnuts on the fire. Then all the Cratchit family drew  round the hearth in what Bob Cratchit called a circle, meaning half a  one; and at Bob Cratchit's elbow stood the family display of glass. Two  tumblers and a custard cup without a handle.    These held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well as golden  goblets would have done; and Bob served it out with beaming looks, while  the chestnuts on the fire sputtered and cracked noisily. Then Bob  proposed:    \"A merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God bless us!\"    Which all the family re-echoed.    \"God bless us every one!\" said Tiny Tim, the last of all.    He sat very close to his father's side, upon his little stool. Bob held  his withered little hand in his, as if he loved the child, and wished to  keep him by his side, and dreaded that he might be taken from him.    \"Spirit,\" said Scrooge "]]]
