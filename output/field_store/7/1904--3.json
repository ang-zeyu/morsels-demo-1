The water absorbed the acid formed by the burning  sulphur. It was next discovered that by mixing with the sulphur some  nitre, much more sulphuric acid could be produced per given quantity of  brimstone. At first large glass carboys were used, but in 1746 the  carboys were replaced by chambers of lead containing water at the  bottom, and in these lead chambers the mixture of sulphur and nitre was  burnt on iron trays. Next, although gradually, the plant was divided  into two portions--a furnace for burning the sulphur, and a chamber for  receiving the vapours. The system was thus developed into the one  followed at the present time. The sulphur, or, in most cases, cupreous  iron pyrites (a combination of iron and copper with sulphur), is burned  in specially constructed kilns or furnaces, and the hot gases,  consisting essentially of sulphur dioxide with the excess of air, pass  through flues in which are placed cast-iron \"nitre pots\" containing a  mixture of nitre (sodium nitrate) and vitriol. The gases thus become  mixed with nitrous fumes or gaseous oxides of nitrogen, and, after  cooling, are ready for mixing with steam or water spray in the lead  chambers in which the vitriol is produced. These oxides of nitrogen  enable the formation of sulphuric acid to take place more quickly by  playing the part of oxygen-carriers. Sulphuric acid is formed by the  union of oxygen with sulphur dioxide and water; the oxides of nitrogen  combine with the oxygen of the air present in the chambers, then give up  this oxygen to the sulphur dioxide and water or steam to form sulphuric  acid, again combine with more oxygen, and so on. The exact processes or  reactions are of course much more complicated, but the above represents  what is practically the ultimate result. It is evident that the gases  leaving the last lead chamber in which the formation of vitriol is  effected, must still contain nitrous fumes, and it becomes a matter of  importance to recover them, so that they can be used over again. To  effect this object, use is made of the solubility of nitrous fumes in  strong vitriol. The gases from the last lead chamber of the series are  passed through what is called a Gay-Lussac tower (the process was  invented by the eminent French chemist Gay-Lussac), which is a tower  made of lead, supported by a wooden framework, and filled with coke or  special stoneware packing, over which strong vitriol is caused to flow.  The vitriol dissolves the nitrogen oxides, and so-called \"nitrous  vitriol\" flows out at the base of the tower. The recovery of the  nitrogen compounds from the nitrous vitriol is effected in Glover towers  (the invention of John Glover of Newcastle), which also serve to  concentrate to some extent the weak acid produced in the lead chambers,  and to cool the hot gases from the sulphur burners or pyrites kilns. The  weak chamber acid is mixed with the nitrous vitriol from the Gay-Lussac  tower, and the mixture is pumped to the top of the Glover tower, which  is of similar construction to the Gay-Lussac tower, but is generally  packed with flints. This Glover tower is placed between the sulphur  burners or pyrites kilns and the first lead chamber. The nitrous vitriol  passing down the tower meets the hot gases from the kilns, and a  threefold object is effected: (1) The nitrous fumes are expelled from  the nitrous vitriol, and are carried into the chambers, to again play  the part of oxygen-carriers; (2) the weak chamber acid which was mixed  with the nitrous vitriol is concentrated by the hot kiln gases; and (3)  the hot gases themselves are cooled. The acid from the Glover tower is  purified by special treatment--for example, the arsenic may be removed,  after precipitation with sulphuretted hydrogen, in the form of insoluble  arsenic sulphide,--and the purified acid is concentrated by heating in  glass or platinum vessels.    A considerable amount of sulphuric acid is now made by the so-called  \"contact process,\" in which sulphur dioxide and oxygen unite to form  sulphuric acid in presence of a heated \"contact\" substance, usually some  form of finely-divided platinum.    _Nitric Acid._--This acid is usually prepared by distilling a mixture of  sodium nitrate and vitriol in cast-iron retorts or pots, the nitric acid  being collected in stoneware vessels connected one with another, or, as  is more generally the case at the present time, in condensing apparatus  consisting of stoneware pipes or coils cooled by water. The effluent  gases are passed through a scrubber in order to free them from the last  traces of acid before discharging them into the atmosphere.    _Hydrochloric Acid._--The greater part of the hydrochloric acid  manufactured in Great Britain is obtained as an intermediate product in  the Leblanc alkali process, which will presently be described, being  produced by heating common salt with vitriol. A large quantity is,  however, also produced by the so-called direct process of Hargreaves &  Robinson, which is, in principle, the same method as that employed in  the Leblanc process, except that the intermediate product, vitriol, is  not separated. It consists essentially in passing the hot gases from  pyrites kilns, as used in the manufacture of vitriol, through large  cast-iron vessels containing common salt heated to a high temperature.  Various physical conditions must be complied with in order to make the  process a success. For example, the salt is used in the form of moulded  hard porous cakes made from a damp mixture of common salt and rock salt.  The cast-iron vessels must be heated uniformly, and the hot pyrites kiln  gases must be passed downwards through the salt in order to ensure  uniform distribution. The hydrochloric acid is condensed in stoneware  pipes connected with towers packed with coke or stoneware.    _Alkali: Leblanc Process._--The manufacture of vitriol, as I have  described it to you, is the first step in the Leblanc process. The next  stage consists in the manufacture of sodium sulphate (salt-cake) and  hydrochloric acid from the sulphuric acid and common salt; this is  called the salt-cake process. The production of salt-cake or crude  sodium sulphate is carried out in two stages. A large covered iron pan,  called the decomposing pan or salt-cake pot, is mounted in one part of  the salt-cake furnace, and alongside it is the hearth or bed on which  the second stage of the process, the drying or roasting, is effected.  The mixture of common salt and vitriol is charged into the salt-cake  pot, which is heated by a fire below. When from two-thirds to  three-quarters of the hydrochloric acid has been expelled from the  charge, the mass acquires the consistence of thick dough, and at this  stage it is raked out of the pan on to the roasting hearth alongside,  where the decomposition is completed by means of flames playing directly  on to the top of the charge. The hydrochloric acid evolved during the  process is condensed in much the same manner as in the process of  Hargreaves & Robinson previously described. It is a curious fact that in  the earlier years of the Leblanc process, hydrochloric acid, or \"spirits  of salt,\" as it is frequently called, was a by-product that required all  the vigilance of the alkali-works inspectors to prevent it being allowed  to escape from the chimneys in more than a certain small regulated  amount. Now, it is the principal product; indeed, the Leblanc alkali  maker may be said to subsist on that hydrochloric acid, as his chief  instrument for producing chloride of lime or bleaching powder.    Mechanical furnaces are now used to a large extent for the salt-cake  process. They consist broadly of a large revolving furnace-hearth or  bed, on to which the mixture of salt and vitriol is charged, and on  which it is continuously agitated, and gradually moved to the place of  discharge, by rakes or the like, operated by suitable machinery.    The next stage of the Leblanc process is the manufacture of \"black ash,\"  or crude sodium carbonate. This is usually done in large cylindrical  revolving furnaces, through, which flames from a fire-grate, or from the  burning of gaseous fuel, pass; the waste heat is utilised for boiling  down \"black ash\" liquor, obtained by lixiviating the black ash. A  mixture of salt-cake, limestone or chalk (calcium carbonate), and  powdered coal or coal slack is charged into the revolving cylinder;  during the process the mass becomes agglomerated, and the final product  is what is known as a \"black-ash ball,\" consisting chiefly of crude  sodium carbonate and calcium sulphide, but containing smaller quantities  of many other substances. The soda ash or sodium carbonate is obtained  from the black ash by lixiviating with water, and after various  purification processes, the solution is boiled down, as previously  stated, by the waste heat of the black-ash furnace. The alkali is sold  in various forms as soda ash, soda crystals, washing soda, etc.    Caustic soda is manufactured from solution of carbonate of soda by  causticising, that is, treatment with caustic lime or quicklime.    It will have been noticed that one of the chief reagents in the Leblanc  process is the sulphur used in the form of brimstone or as pyrites for  making vitriol in the first stage; this sulphur goes through the entire  process; from the vitriol it goes to form a constituent of the  salt-cake, and afterwards of the calcium sulphide contained in the black  ash. This calcium sulphide remains as an insoluble mass when the  carbonate of soda is extracted from the black ash, and forms the chief  constituent of the alkali waste, which until the year 1880 could be seen  in large heaps around chemical works. Now, however, by means of  treatment with kiln gases containing carbonic acid, the sulphur is  extracted from the waste in the form of hydrogen sulphide,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17748"],[0,"The Extermination of the American Bison (#10)"],[1,"by fear. That it was often manifested, however, is proven by the  following from Audubon and Bachman:[29]    [Note 29: Quadrupeds of North America, vol. II, pp. 38, 39.]    \"Buffalo calves are drowned from being unable to ascend the steep banks  of the rivers across which they have just swam, as the cows cannot help  them, although they stand near the bank, and will not leave them to  their fate unless something alarms them.    \"On one occasion Mr. Kipp, of the American Fur Company, caught eleven  calves, their dams all the time standing near the top of the bank.  Frequently, however, the cows leave the young to their fate, when most  of them perish. In connection with this part of the subject, we may add  that we were informed, when on the Upper Missouri River, that when the  banks of that river were practicable for cows, and their calves could  not follow them, they went down again, after having gained the top, and  would remain by them until forced away by the cravings of hunger. When  thus forced by the necessity of saving themselves to quit their young,  they seldom, if ever, return to them. When a large herd of these wild  animals are crossing a river, the calves or yearlings manage to get on  the backs of the cows, and are thus conveyed safely over.\"    5. _The Yearling._--During the first five months of his life, the calf  changes its coat completely, and becomes in appearance a totally  different animal. By the time he is six months old he has taken on all  the colors which distinguish him in after life, excepting that upon his  fore quarters. The hair on the head has started out to attain the  luxuriant length and density which is so conspicuous in the adult, and  its general color is a rich dark brown, shading to black under the chin  and throat. The fringe under the neck is long, straight, and black, and  the under parts, the back of the fore arm, the outside of thigh, and the  tail-tuft are all black.    The color of the shoulder, the side, and upper part of the hind quarter  is a peculiar smoky brown (\"broccoli brown\" of Ridgway), having in  connection with the darker browns of the other parts a peculiar faded  appearance, quite as if it were due to the bleaching power of the sun.  On the fore quarters there is none of the bright straw color so  characteristic of the adult animal. Along the top of the neck and  shoulders, however, this color has at last begun to show faintly. The  hair on the body is quite luxuriant, both in length and density, in both  respects quite equaling, if not even surpassing, that of the finest  adults. For example, the hair on the side of the mounted yearling in the  Museum group has a length of 2 to 21/2 inches, while that on the same  region of the adult bull, whose pelage is particularly fine, is recorded  as being 2 inches only.    The horn is a straight, conical spike from 4 to 6 inches long, according  to age, and perfectly black. The legs are proportionally longer and  larger in the joints than those of the full-grown animal. The  countenance of the yearling is quite interesting. The sleepy, helpless,  innocent expression of the very young calf has given place to a  wide-awake, mischievous look, and he seems ready to break away and run  at a second's notice.    The measurements of the yearling in the Museum group are as follows:    +----------------------------------------------------------------+  |BISON AMERICANUS. (Male yearling, taken Oct. 31, 1886.

The curve of the horn is generally hidden in  the hair, and the only part visible is the straight, terminal spike.  Usually the spike points diverge from each other, but often they are  parallel, and also perpendicular. In the fourth year, however, the  points of the horns begin to curve inward toward each other, describing  equal arcs of the same circle, as if they were going to meet over the  top of the head.    In the handsome young \"spike\" bull in the Museum group, the hair on the  shoulders has begun to take on the length, the light color, and tufted  appearance of the adult, beginning at the highest point of the hump and  gradually spreading. Immediately back of this light patch the hair is  long, but dark and woolly in appearance. The leg tufts have doubled in  length, and reveal the character of the growth that may be finally  expected. The beard has greatly lengthened, as also has the hair upon  the bridge of the nose, the forehead, ears, jaws, and all other portions  of the head except the cheeks.    The \"spike\" period of a buffalo is a most interesting one. Like a  seventeen-year-old boy, the young bull shows his youth in so many ways  it is always conspicuous, and his countenance is so suggestive of a  half-bearded youth it fixes the interest to a marked degree. He is  active, alert, and suspicious, and when he makes up his mind to run the  hunter may as well give up the chase.    By a strange fatality, our spike bull appears to be the only one in any  museum, or even in preserved existence, as far as can be ascertained.  Out of the twenty-five buffaloes killed and preserved by the Smithsonian  expedition, ten of which were adult bulls, this specimen was the only  male between the yearling and the adult ages. An effort to procure  another entire specimen of this age from Texas yielded only two spike  heads. It is to be sincerely regretted that more specimens representing  this very interesting period of the buffalo's life have not been  preserved, for it is now too late to procure wild specimens.    The following are the post-mortem dimensions of our specimen:    +---------------------------------------------------------------+  |                        BISON AMERICANUS.                      |  +---------------------------------------------------------------+  |(\"Spike\" bull, two years old; taken October 14, 1886.

But the head  is irresistible in its claims to precedence.    [Illustration: SPIKE BULL. From the group in the National Museum.  Reproduced from the _Cosmopolitan Magazine_, by permission of the  publishers.]    It must be observed at this point that in many respects this animal is  an exceptionally fine one. In actual size of frame, and in quantity and  quality of pelage, it is far superior to the average, even of wild  buffaloes when they were most numerous and at their best.[30] In one  respect, however, that of actual bulk, it is believed that this specimen  may have often been surpassed. When buffaloes were numerous, and not  required to do any great amount of running in order to exist, they were,  in the autumn months, very fat. Audubon says: \"A large bison bull will  generally weigh nearly 2,000 pounds, and a fat cow about 1,200 pounds.  We weighed one of the bulls killed by our party, and found it to reach  1,727 pounds, although it had already lost a good deal of blood. This  was an old bull, and not fat. It had probably weighed more at some  previous period.\"[31] Our specimen when killed (by the writer, December  6, 1886) was in full vigor, superbly muscled, and well fed, but he  carried not a single pound of fat. For years the never-ceasing race for  life had utterly prevented the secretion of useless and cumbersome fat,  and his \"subsistence\" had gone toward the development of useful muscle.  Having no means by which to weigh him, we could only estimate his  weight, in which I called for the advice of my cowboys, all of whom were  more or less familiar with the weight of range cattle, and one I  regarded as an expert. At first the estimated weight of the animal was  fixed at 1,700 pounds, but with a constitutional fear of estimating over  the truth, I afterward reduced it to 1,600 pounds. This I am now"]]]
