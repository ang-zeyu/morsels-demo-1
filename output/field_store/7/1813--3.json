While Douglas was visiting Rome in 1450,  the Livingstones had been forfeited, and Crichton became Chancellor.        FALL OF THE BLACK DOUGLASES.      The Douglases, through a royal marriage of an ancestor to a daughter of  the more legitimate marriage of Robert II., had a kind of claim to the  throne which they never put forward.  The country was thus spared  dynastic wars, like those of the White and Red Roses in England; but,  none the less, the Douglases were too rich and powerful for subjects.    The Earl at the moment held Galloway and Annandale, two of his brothers  were Earls of Moray and Ormond; in October 1448, Ormond had distinguished  himself by defeating and taking Percy, urging a raid into Scotland, at a  bloody battle on the Water of Sark, near Gretna.    During the Earl of Douglas's absence in Rome, James had put down some of  his unruly retainers, and even after his return (1451) had persevered in  this course.  Later in the year Douglas resigned, and received back his  lands, a not uncommon formula showing submission on the vassal's favour  on the lord's part, as when Charles VII., at the request of Jeanne d'Arc,  made this resignation to God!    Douglas, however, was suspected of intriguing with England and with the  Lord of the Isles, while he had a secret covenant or \"band\" with the  Earls of Crawford and Ross.  If all this were true, he was planning a  most dangerous enterprise.    He was invited to Stirling to meet the king under a safe-conduct, and  there (February 22, 1452) was dirked by his king at the sacred table of  hospitality.    Whether this crime was premeditated or merely passionate is unknown, as  in the case of Bruce's murder of the Red Comyn before the high altar.  Parliament absolved James on slender grounds.  James, the brother of the  slain earl, publicly defied his king, gave his allegiance to Henry VI. of  England, withdrew it, intrigued, and, after his brothers had been routed  at Arkinholm, near Langholm (May 18, 1455), fled to England.  His House  was proclaimed traitorous; their wide lands in southern and south-western  Scotland were forfeited and redistributed, the Scotts of Buccleuch  profiting largely in the long-run.  The leader of the Royal forces at  Arkinholm, near Langholm, was another Douglas, one of \"the Red  Douglases,\" the Earl of Angus; and till the execution of the Earl of  Morton, under James VI., the Red Douglases were as powerful, turbulent,  and treacherous as the Black Douglases had been in their day.  When  attacked and defeated, these Douglases, red or black, always allied  themselves with England and with the Lords of the Isles, the hereditary  foes of the royal authority.    Meanwhile Edward IV. wrote of the Scots as \"his rebels of Scotland,\" and  in the alternations of fortune between the Houses of York and Lancaster,  James held with Henry VI.  When Henry was defeated and taken at  Northampton (July 10, 1460), James besieged Roxburgh Castle, an English  hold on the Border, and (August 3, 1460) was slain by the explosion of a  great bombard.    James was but thirty years of age at his death.  By the dagger, by the  law, and by the aid of the Red Douglases, he had ruined his most powerful  nobles--and his own reputation.  His early training, like that of James  VI., was received while he was in the hands of the most treacherous,  bloody, and unscrupulous of mankind; later, he met them with their own  weapons.  The foundation of the University of Glasgow (1451), and the  building and endowment of St Salvator's College in St Andrews, by Bishop  Kennedy, are the most permanent proofs of advancing culture in the reign  of James.    Many laws of excellent tendency, including sumptuary laws, which suggest  the existence of unexpected wealth and luxury, were passed; but such laws  were never firmly and regularly enforced.  By one rule, which does seem  to have been carried out, no poisons were to be imported: Scottish  chemical science was incapable of manufacturing them.  Much later, under  James VI., we find a parcel of arsenic, to be used for political  purposes, successfully stopped at Leith.          CHAPTER XIII.  JAMES III.      James II. left three sons; the eldest, James III., aged nine, was crowned  at Kelso (August 10, 1460); his brothers, bearing the titles of Albany  and Mar, were not to be his supports.  His mother, Mary of Gueldres, had  the charge of the boys, and, as she was won over by her uncle, Philip of  Burgundy, to the cause of the House of York, while Kennedy and the Earl  of Angus stood for the House of Lancaster, there was strife between them  and the queen-mother and nobles.  Kennedy relied on France (Louis XL),  and his opponents on England.    The battle of Towton (March 30, 1461) drove Henry VI. and his queen  across the Border, where Kennedy entertained the melancholy exile in the  Castle of St Andrews.  The grateful Henry restored Berwick to the Scots,  who could not hold it long.  In June 1461, while the Scots were failing  to take Carlisle, Edward IV. was crowned, and sent his adherent, the  exiled Earl of Douglas, to treat for an alliance with the Celts, under  John, Lord of the Isles, and that Donald Balloch who was falsely believed  to have long before been slain in Ireland.    It is curious to think of the Lord of the Isles dealing as an independent  prince, through a renegade Douglas, with the English king.  A treaty was  made at John's Castle of Ardtornish--now a shell of crumbling stone on  the sea-shore of the Morvern side of the Sound of Mull--with the English  monarch at Westminster.  The Highland chiefs promise allegiance to  Edward, and, if successful, the Celts are to recover the ancient kingdom  from Caithness to the Forth, while Douglas is to be all-powerful from the  Forth to the Border!    But other intrigues prevailed.  The queen-mother and her son, in the most  friendly manner, met the kingmaker Warwick at Dumfries, and again at  Carlisle, and Douglas was disgraced by Edward, though restored to favour  when Bishop Kennedy declined to treat with Edward's commissioners.  The  Treaty of England with Douglas and the Celts was then ratified; but  Douglas, advancing in front of Edward's army to the Border, met old  Bishop Kennedy in helmet and corslet, and was defeated.  Louis XI.,  however, now deserted the Red for the White Rose.  Kennedy followed his  example; and peace was made between England and Scotland in October 1464.  Kennedy died in the summer of 1465.    There followed the usual struggles between confederations of the nobles,  and, in July 1466, James was seized, being then aged fourteen, by the  party of the Boyds, Flemings, and Kennedys, aided by Hepburn of Hailes  (ancestor of the turbulent Earl of Bothwell), and by the head of the  Border House of Cessford, Andrew Ker.    It was a repetition of the struggles of Livingstone and Crichton, and now  the great Border lairds begin to take their place in history.  Boyd made  himself Governor to the king, his son married the king's eldest sister,  Mary, and became Earl of Arran.  But brief was the triumph of the Boyds.  In 1469 James married Margaret of Norway; Orkney and Shetland were her  dower; but while Arran negotiated the affair abroad, at home the fall of  his house was arranged.  Boyd fled the country; the king's sister,  divorced from young Arran, married the Lord Hamilton; and his family, who  were Lords of Cadzow under Robert Bruce, and had been allies of the Black  Douglases till their fall, became the nearest heirs of the royal  Stewarts, if that family were extinct.  The Hamiltons, the wealthiest  house in Scotland, never produced a man of great ability, but their  nearness to the throne and their ambition were storm-centres in the time  of Mary Stuart and James VI., and even as late as the Union in 1707.    The fortunes of a nephew of Bishop Kennedy, Patrick Graham, Kennedy's  successor as Bishop of St Andrews, now perplex the historian.  Graham  dealt for himself with the Pope, obtained the rank of Archbishop for the  Bishop of St Andrews (1472), and thus offended the king and country,  always jealous of interference from Rome.  But he was reported on as more  or less insane by a Papal Nuncio, and was deposed.  Had he been defending  (as used to be said) the right of election of Bishop for the Canons  against the greed of the nobles, the Nuncio might not have taken an  unfavourable view of his intellect.  In any case, whether the clergy,  backed by Rome, elected their bishops, or whether the king and nobles  made their profit out of the Church appointments, jobbery was the  universal rule.  Ecclesiastical corruption and, as a rule, ignorance,  were attaining their lowest level. {67}  By 1476 the Lord of the Isles,  the Celtic ally of Edward IV., was reduced by Argyll, Huntly, and  Crawford, and lost the sheriffdom of Inverness, and the earldom of Ross,  which was attached to the Crown (1476).  His treaty of Ardtornish had  come to light.  But his bastard, Angus Og, filled the north and west with  fire and tumult from Ross to Tobermory (1480-1490), while James's  devotion to the arts--a thing intolerable--and to the society of low-born  favourites, especially Thomas Cockburn, \"a stone-cutter,\" prepared the  sorrows and the end of his reign.    The intrigues which follow, and the truth about the character of James,  are exceedingly obscure.  We have no Scottish chronicle written at the  time; the later histories, by Ferrerius, an Italian, and, much later, by  Queen Mary's Bishop Lesley, and by George Buchanan, are full of rumours  and contradictions, while the State Papers and Treaties of England merely  prove the extreme treachery of James's brother Albany, and no evidence  tells us how James contrived to get the better of the traitor.  James's  brothers Albany and Mar were popular; were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1597"],[0,"Andersen's Fairy Tales (#10)"],[1,"wildly about the ceiling; and as to the smell  therein--no--that was beyond description.    \"You had better lay the cloth below in the stable,\" said one of the  travellers; \"there, at all events, one knows what one is breathing.\"    The windows were quickly opened, to let in a little fresh air. Quicker,  however, than the breeze, the withered, sallow arms of the beggars were  thrust in, accompanied by the eternal whine of \"Miserabili, miserabili,  excellenza!\" On the walls were displayed innumerable inscriptions,  written in nearly every language of Europe, some in verse, some in  prose, most of them not very laudatory of \"bella Italia.\"    The meal was served. It consisted of a soup of salted water, seasoned  with pepper and rancid oil. The last ingredient played a very prominent  part in the salad; stale eggs and roasted cocks'-combs furnished the  grand dish of the repast; the wine even was not without a disgusting  taste--it was like a medicinal draught.    At night the boxes and other effects of the passengers were placed  against the rickety doors. One of the travellers kept watch while the  others slept. The sentry was our young Divine. How close it was in the  chamber! The heat oppressive to suffocation--the gnats hummed and stung  unceasingly--the \"miserabili\" without whined and moaned in their sleep.    \"Travelling would be agreeable enough,\" said he groaning, \"if one only  had no body, or could send it to rest while the spirit went on its  pilgrimage unhindered, whither the voice within might call it. Wherever  I go, I am pursued by a longing that is insatiable--that I cannot  explain to myself, and that tears my very heart. I want something better  than what is but what is fled in an instant. But what is it, and where  is it to be found? Yet, I know in reality what it is I wish for. Oh!  most happy were I, could I but reach one aim--could but reach the  happiest of all!\"    And as he spoke the word he was again in his home; the long white  curtains hung down from the windows, and in the middle of the floor  stood the black coffin; in it he lay in the sleep of death. His wish  was fulfilled--the body rested, while the spirit went unhindered on its  pilgrimage. \"Let no one deem himself happy before his end,\" were the  words of Solon; and here was a new and brilliant proof of the wisdom of  the old apothegm.    Every corpse is a sphynx of immortality; here too on the black coffin  the sphynx gave us no answer to what he who lay within had written two  days before:         \"O mighty Death! thy silence teaches nought,         Thou leadest only to the near grave's brink;        Is broken now the ladder of my thoughts?       Do I instead of mounting only sink?         Our heaviest grief the world oft seeth not,        Our sorest pain we hide from stranger eyes:        And for the sufferer there is nothing left       But the green mound that o'er the coffin lies.\"    Two figures were moving in the chamber. We knew them both; it was the  fairy of Care, and the emissary of Fortune. They both bent over the  corpse.    \"Do you now see,\" said Care, \"what happiness your Galoshes have brought  to mankind?\"    \"To him, at least, who slumbers here, they have brought an imperishable  blessing,\" answered the other.    \"Ah no!\" replied Care. \"He took his departure himself; he was not called  away. His mental powers here below were not strong enough to reach the  treasures lying beyond this life, and which his destiny ordained he  should obtain. I will now confer a benefit on him.\"    And she took the Galoshes from his feet; his sleep of death was ended;  and he who had been thus called back again to life arose from his  dread couch in all the vigor of youth. Care vanished, and with her the  Galoshes. She has no doubt taken them for herself, to keep them to all  eternity.          THE FIR TREE    Out in the woods stood a nice little Fir Tree. The place he had was a  very good one: the sun shone on him: as to fresh air, there was enough  of that, and round him grew many large-sized comrades, pines as well as  firs. But the little Fir wanted so very much to be a grown-up tree.    He did not think of the warm sun and of the fresh air; he did not care  for the little cottage children that ran about and prattled when they  were in the woods looking for wild-strawberries. The children often came  with a whole pitcher full of berries, or a long row of them threaded on  a straw, and sat down near the young tree and said, \"Oh, how pretty he  is! What a nice little fir!\" But this was what the Tree could not bear  to hear.    At the end of a year he had shot up a good deal, and after another year  he was another long bit taller; for with fir trees one can always tell  by the shoots how many years old they are.    \"Oh! Were I but such a high tree as the others are,\" sighed he. \"Then I  should be able to spread out my branches, and with the tops to look into  the wide world! Then would the birds build nests among my branches: and  when there was a breeze, I could bend with as much stateliness as the  others!\"    Neither the sunbeams, nor the birds, nor the red clouds which morning  and evening sailed above him, gave the little Tree any pleasure.    In winter, when the snow lay glittering on the ground, a hare would  often come leaping along, and jump right over the little Tree. Oh, that  made him so angry! But two winters were past, and in the third the Tree  was so large that the hare was obliged to go round it. \"To grow and  grow, to get older and be tall,\" thought the Tree--\"that, after all, is  the most delightful thing in the world!\"    In autumn the wood-cutters always came and felled some of the largest  trees. This happened every year; and the young Fir Tree, that had now  grown to a very comely size, trembled at the sight; for the magnificent  great trees fell to the earth with noise and cracking, the branches were  lopped off, and the trees looked long and bare; they were hardly to be  recognised; and then they were laid in carts, and the horses dragged  them out of the wood.    Where did they go to? What became of them?    In spring, when the swallows and the storks came, the Tree asked them,  \"Don't you know where they have been taken? Have you not met them  anywhere?\"    The swallows did not know anything about it; but the Stork looked  musing, nodded his head, and said, \"Yes; I think I know; I met many  ships as I was flying hither from Egypt; on the ships were magnificent  masts, and I venture to assert that it was they that smelt so of fir.  I may congratulate you, for they lifted themselves on high most  majestically!\"    \"Oh, were I but old enough to fly across the sea! But how does the sea  look in reality? What is it like?\"    \"That would take a long time to explain,\" said the Stork, and with these  words off he went.    \"Rejoice in thy growth!\" said the Sunbeams. \"Rejoice in thy vigorous  growth, and in the fresh life that moveth within thee!\"    And the Wind kissed the Tree, and the Dew wept tears over him; but the  Fir understood it not.    When Christmas came, quite young trees were cut down: trees which often  were not even as large or of the same age as this Fir Tree, who could  never rest, but always wanted to be off. These young trees, and they  were always the finest looking, retained their branches; they were laid  on carts, and the horses drew them out of the wood.    \"Where are they going to?\" asked the Fir. \"They are not taller than  I; there was one indeed that was considerably shorter; and why do they  retain all their branches? Whither are they taken?\"    \"We know! We know!\" chirped the Sparrows. \"We have peeped in at the  windows in the town below! We know whither they are taken! The greatest  splendor and the greatest magnificence one can imagine await them. We  peeped through the windows, and saw them planted in the middle of the  warm room and ornamented with the most splendid things, with gilded  apples, with gingerbread, with toys, and many hundred lights!\"    \"And then?\" asked the Fir Tree, trembling in every bough. \"And then?  What happens then?\"    \"We did not see anything more: it was incomparably beautiful.\"    \"I would fain know if I am destined for so glorious a career,\" cried  the Tree, rejoicing. \"That is still better than to cross the sea! What  a longing do I suffer! Were Christmas but come! I am now tall, and my  branches spread like the others that were carried off last year! Oh!  were I but already on the cart! Were I in the warm room with all the  splendor and magnificence! Yes; then something better, something still  grander, will surely follow, or wherefore should they thus ornament me?  Something better, something still grander must follow--but what? Oh, how  I long, how I suffer! I do not know myself what is the matter with me!\"    \"Rejoice in our presence!\" said the Air and the Sunlight. \"Rejoice in  thy own fresh youth!\"    But the Tree did not rejoice at all; he grew and grew, and was green  both winter and summer. People that saw him said, \"What a fine tree!\"  and towards Christmas he was one of the first that was cut down. The axe  struck deep into the very pith; the Tree fell to the earth with a sigh;  he felt a pang--it was like a swoon; he could not think of happiness,  for he was sorrowful at being separated from his home, from the place  where he had sprung up. He well knew that he should never see his dear  old comrades, the little bushes and flowers around him, anymore; perhaps  not even the birds! The departure was not at all agreeable.    The Tree only came to himself when he was unloaded in a court-yard with  the other trees, and heard a man say, \"That one is splendid! We don't  want the others.\" Then two servants came in rich livery and carried the  Fir Tree into a large and splendid drawing-room. Portraits were hanging  on the walls, and near the white porcelain stove stood two large Chinese  vases with lions on the covers. There, too, were large"]]]
