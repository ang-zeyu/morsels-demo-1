We settled them before you came. You are to have three shots  with your own arrows. Nobody is to borrow or lend. So shoot away.\"    24. John seized his second arrow; \"If I have any luck,\" said he;--but just  as he pronounced the word \"luck,\" the string broke, and the arrow fell  from his hands.    25.  Master Sharp. There! It is all over with you.    26.  Ben. Here is my bow for him, and welcome.    27. Master Sharp. No, no, sir; that is not fair.  Did you not hear the  rules? There is to be no lending.    28. It was now Ben's turn to make his trial. His first arrow missed the  mark; the second was exactly as near as John's first. Before venturing the  last arrow, Ben very prudently examined the string of his bow; and, as he  pulled it to try its strength, it snapped.    29. Master Sharp clapped his hands and danced for joy. But his dancing  suddenly ceased, when careful Ben drew out of his pocket an excellent  piece of cord, and began to tie it to the bow.    30. \"The everlasting whipcord, I declare!\" cried John. \"Yes,\" said Ben, \"I  put it in my pocket today, because I thought I might want it.\"    31. Ben's last arrow won the prize; and when the bow and arrows were  handed to him, John said, \"How valuable that whipcord has been to you,  Ben. I'll take care how I waste anything hereafter.\"      DEFINITIONS,--2. Ex-am'ine, to look at carefully. 6. Sig'ni--fies, to be  important. 22. Marks'man, one who shoots well. 28. Pru'dent-ly, with  proper caution. 29. Ceased, stopped. 30. Ev--er-last'ing, lasting always.      EXERCISES.--What is this lesson designed to teach? Which of the boys  preserved his whipcord? What good did it do him? What did the other boy do  with his? What was the consequence? What did he learn from it?    XXII. JEANNETTE AND JO. (67)    By Mary Mapes Dodge, who was born in New York City in 1838. She is the  editor of the \"St. Nicholas\" magazine, and has written many stories for  children.    1. Two girls I know--Jeannette and Jo,     And one is always moping;     The other lassie, come what may,     Is ever bravely hoping.    2. Beauty of face and girlish grace     Are theirs, for joy or sorrow;     Jeannette takes brightly every day,     And Jo dreads each to-morrow.    3. One early morn they watched the dawn--     I saw them stand together;     Their whole day's sport, 't was very plain,     Depended on the weather.    4. \"'T will storm!\" cried Jo. Jeannette spoke low;     \"Yes, but 't will soon be over.\"     And, as she spoke, the sudden shower     Came, beating down the clover.    5. \"I told you so!\" cried angry Jo:     \"It always is a-raining!\"     Then hid her face in dire despair,     Lamenting and complaining.    6. But sweet Jeannette, quite hopeful yet,--     I tell it to her honor,--     Looked up and waited till the sun     Came streaming in upon her.    7. The broken clouds sailed off in crowds,     Across a sea of glory.     Jeannette and Jo ran, laughing, in--     Which ends my simple story.    8. Joy is divine. Come storm, come shine,     The hopeful are the gladdest;     And doubt and dread, children, believe     Of all things are the saddest.    9. In morning's light, let youth be bright;     Take in the sunshine tender;     Then, at the close, shall life's decline     Be full of sunset splendor.    10. And ye who fret, try, like Jeannette,      To shun all weak complaining;     And not, like Jo, cry out too soon--     \"It always is a-raining!\"        XXIII. THE LION. (69)    1. The lion is often called the \"king of beasts,\" His height varies from  three to four feet, and he is from six to nine feet long. His coat is of  it yellowish brown or tawny color, and about his neck is a great shaggy  mane which gives his head a majestic appearance.    2. The strength of the lion is so great that he can easily crush the  skulls of such animals as the horse or ox with one blow of his paw. No one  who has not seen the teeth of a full grown lion taken out of their sockets  can have any idea of their real size; one of them forms a good handful,  and might easily be mistaken for a small elephant's tooth.    3. The home of the lion is in the forests of Asia and Africa, where he is  a terror to man and beast. He generally lies concealed during the day, but  as darkness comes on he prowls about where other animals are accustomed to  go for food or drink, and springs upon them unawares, with a roar that  sounds like the rumble of thunder.    4. The lion sometimes lives to a great age. One by the name of Pompey died  at London, in the year 1760, at the age of seventy years. If taken when  young the lion can be tamed, and will even show marks of kindness to his  keeper.    5. In a menagerie at Brussels, there was a cell where a large lion, called  Danco, used to be kept. The cell happened to be in need of repair, and the  keeper, whose name was William, desired a carpenter to come and mend it.  The carpenter came, but was so afraid of the lion, that he would not go  near the cell alone.    6. So William entered the cell, and led the lion to the upper part of it,  while the other part was refitting. He played with the lion for some time;  but, at last, being wearied, both he and the lion fell asleep. The  carpenter went on with his work, and when he had finished he called out  for William to come and see it.    7. He called again and again, but no William answered. The poor carpenter  began to be frightened, lest the lion had made his dinner of the keeper,  or else crushed him with his great paws. He crept round to the upper part  of the cell, and there, looking through the railing, he saw the lion and  William sleeping side by side as contentedly as two little brothers.    8. He was so astonished that he uttered a loud cry. The lion, awakened by  the noise, stared at the carpenter with an eye of fury, and then placing  his paw on the breast of his keeper, as if to say, \"Touch him if you  dare,\" the heroic beast lay down to sleep again. The carpenter was  dreadfully alarmed, and, not knowing how he could rouse William, he ran  out and related what he had seen.    9. Some people came, and, opening the door of the cell, Contrived to  awaken the keeper, who, rubbing his eyes, quietly looked around him, and  expressed himself very well satisfied with his nap. He took the lion's  paw, shook it kindly, and then retired uninjured from the cell.      DEFINITIONS.--l. Ma-jes'tic, royal, noble. 3. Prowls, wanders in search of  prey.  Un-a-wares', unexpectedly. Rum'ble, a low heavy sound. 5.  Men-ag'er-ie, a collection of wild animals. 6. Re-fit'ting, repairing. 8.  He-ro'-ic, bold.      EXERCISES.--Describe the lion's appearance. What is said of his strength?  His teeth? Describe the lion's home and habits. To what age do lions live?  Can they be tamed? Relate the story about the lion Danco.        XXIV. STRAWBERRIES. (71)    By John Townsend Trowbridge, who was born at Ogden, N. Y., in 1827. He is  a well-known author, and has written much for children both in poetry and  prose.    1. Little Pearl Honeydew, six years old,     From her bright ear parted the curls of gold;     And laid her head on the strawberry bed,     To hear what the red-cheeked berries said.    2. Their cheeks were blushing, their breath was sweet,     She could almost hear their little hearts beat;     And the tiniest, lisping, whispering sound     That ever you heard, came up from the ground.    3. \"Little friends,\" she said, \"I wish I knew     How it is you thrive on sun and dew!\"     And this is the story the berries told     To little Pearl Honeydew, six years old.    4. \"You wish you knew? And so do we.     But we can't tell you, unless it be     That the same Kind Power that cares for you     Takes care of poor little berries, too.    5. \"Tucked up snugly, and nestled below     Our coverlid of wind-woven snow,     We peep and listen, all winter long,     For the first spring day and the bluebird's song.    6. \"When the swallows fly home to the old brown shed,     And the robins build on the bough overhead,     Then out from the mold, from the darkness and cold,     Blossom and runner and leaf unfold.    7. \"Good children, then, if they come near,     And hearken a good long while, may hear     A wonderful tramping of little feet,--     So fast we grow in the summer heat.    8. \"Our clocks are the flowers; and they count the hours     Till we can mellow in suns and showers,     With warmth of the west wind and heat of the south,     A ripe red berry for a ripe red month.    9. \"Apple blooms whiten, and peach blooms fall,     And roses are gay by the garden wall,     Ere the daisy's dial gives the sign     That we may invite little Pearl to dine.    10. \"The days are longest, the month is June,      The year is nearing its golden noon,      The weather is fine, and our feast is spread      With a green cloth and berries red.    11. \"Just take us betwixt your finger and thumb,      And quick, oh, quick! for, see! there come      Tom on all fours, and Martin the man,      And Margaret, picking as fast as they can.    12. \"Oh, dear! if you only knew how it shocks      Nice berries like us to be sold by the box,      And eaten by strangers, and paid for with pelf,      You would surely take pity, and eat us yourself!\"    13. And this is the story the small lips told      To dear Pearl Honeydew, six years old,      When she laid her head on the strawberry bed      To hear what the red-cheeked berries said.      DEFINITIONS.--3. Thrive, to grow well, to flourish. 5. Nes'tled, gathered  closely together. 6. Mold, fine, soft earth. Run'ner, a slender branch  running along the ground. 8. Mel'low, to ripen. 9. Di'al, the face of a  timepiece. 10. Feast, a festive or joyous meal, a banquet. 12. Pelf,  money.      EXERCISES.--What did little Pearl ask of the strawberries? What did they  reply? Can you tell what name is given to this kind of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14883"],[0,"Grandmother Elsie (#10)"],[1," they had become under his renovating and  improving hands.    After that he drew a vivid picture of Elsie's appearance in her bridal  robes, told who were present at the ceremony, who performed it, how the  several actors acquitted themselves, and what refreshments were served  after it was over.    He said he thought happiness was working a rapid cure with Lester, and  that from all he could see and hear, his success as both painter and  sculptor was already assured.    Elsie's themes were the same, but she had much to say of Edward's kind  thoughtfulness, his energy and helpfulness; \"the best and kindest of  brothers,\" she called him, and as she read the words the mother's eyes  shone with love and pride in her eldest son.    But her voice trembled, and the tears had to be wiped away once and again  when she came to that part of the letter in which Elsie told of her  feelings as she robed herself for her bridal with none to assist but  Dinah; how sad was her heart, dearly as she loved Lester, and how full of  longing for home and mother and all the dear ones so far away; then of the  comfort she found in the idea that possibly the dear departed father might  be near her in spirit.    \"Was it wrong, mamma,\" she asked, \"to think he might perhaps be allowed to  be a ministering spirit to me in my loneliness? and to find pleasure in  the thought?\"    \"Mamma, what do you think about it?\" asked Herbert.    \"I do not know that we have any warrant for the idea in the Scriptures,\"  she answered; \"it seems to be one of the things that is not revealed; yet  I see no harm in taking comfort in the thought that it may be so. My poor  lonely darling! I am glad she had that consolation. Ah, papa, what a  different wedding from mine!\"    \"Yes,\" he said, \"and from what we thought hers would be. But I trust she  will never see cause to regret the step she has taken. Lester is worth  saving even at the sacrifice she has made.\"    His daughter looked at him with glistening eyes. \"Thank you, papa, that is  a good thought, and consoles me greatly for both our darling and  ourselves.\"    She went on with the reading of the letter; there were but a few more  sentences; then, while the others discussed its contents, Violet stole  quietly from the room, unobserved as she thought. But in that she was  mistaken. Her mother's eyes followed her with a look of love and sympathy.    \"Dear child!\" she said in a low aside to her father, \"she misses Elsie  sorely; I sometimes think almost more than I do, they were so inseparable  and so strongly attached.\"    Vi's heart was very full, for Elsie's marriage, though far, far from being  so great a sorrow as the death of their father, seemed in some respects  even more the breaking up of a life that had been very sweet.    She sought the studio she and Elsie had shared together (how lonely and  deserted it seemed!) and there gave vent to her feelings in a burst of  tears.    \"O Elsie, darling! we were so happy together! such dear friends! with  never a disagreement, hardly a thought unshared! And now I am alone! all  alone!\"    She had unconsciously spoken aloud. A soft sweet voice echoed the last  word.    \"Alone! ah, my darling, no! not while your mother lives. You and I must  cling the closer together, Vi dearest,\" the voice went on, while two  loving arms enfolded her and a gentle kiss was imprinted upon cheek and  brow.    \"Dearest mamma!\" cried Violet, returning the caress, \"forgive me that I  should indulge in such grief while you are left me--you and your dear  love, the greatest of earthly treasures.\"    \"Yes, dear child, your grief is very natural. These changes, though not  unmixed calamities, are one of the hard conditions of life in this lower  world, dear daughter; but we must not let them mar our peace and  happiness; let us rejoice over the blessings that are left, rather than  weep for those that are gone.\"    \"I will, mamma,\" Violet said, wiping away her tears. \"Ah, how much I still  have to rejoice in and be thankful for!\"    \"Yes, dear, we both have! and not the least the love of Him who has said,  'Lo, _I_ am with you _alway_.' Oh the joy, the bliss of knowing that  _nothing_ can ever part us from _Him_! And then to know, too, that some  day we shall all be together in His immediate presence, beholding His face  and bearing His image!\"    Neither spoke again for some moments, then the mother said, \"Vi, dearest,  there is nothing more conducive to cheerfulness at such a time as this  than being fully employed. So I ask you to take charge of Rosie and Walter  for a few hours. They are not yet well enough for tasks or for out door  sports, but need to be amused. And your grandpa and grandma want me to  drive with them to the Laurels and Roselands.\"    \"Yes, do go, mamma, and try to enjoy yourself. You have seen so little of  Aunt Adelaide since she came, or of Aunt Rosie, since the sickness began  with her children and ours. Thank you for your trust, I shall do my best,\"  Violet said with cheerful alacrity. \"Ah, the recovery of the darlings is  one of the many mercies we have to be thankful for!\"    \"Yes, Vi, and my heart is full of joy and gratitude to the Great  Physician.\"    At Roselands Mrs. Conly still lay helpless on her couch, her condition  having changed very slightly for the better; she could now at times, with  great effort, speak a word or two, but friends and physicians had scarcely  a hope of any further improvement; she might live on thus for years, or  another stroke might at any moment bring the end.    Cut off from all other means of communicating her thoughts and feelings,  she could show them only by the expression of her countenance, which was  sullen, fierce, despairing, piteous by turns.    She had the best of care and nursing from her sisters, her sons, and her  old mammy, assisted occasionally by other friends and relatives, and could  not fail to read in their faces and the tones of their voices tender pity  and sympathy for her in her sore affliction.    They could not tell whether she understood all that was said to her, but  hoping that she did, spoke often to her of the loving Saviour and tried to  lead her to Him.    Hitherto the Ion friends had not been able to be with her a great deal,  but it had not been necessary, as Adelaide was still at Roselands.    She, however, expected soon to return to her own home, and there would  then be greater need of their services; therefore there was double reason  for thankfulness for the restoration to health of the little ones at Ion  and the Laurels; releasing, as it did, both Mrs. Dinsmore and Mrs.  Travilla from the cares and labors which had occupied them for some weeks  past.    The latter gave expression to that thought while driving to the Laurels  with her father and his wife, adding, \"I can now hold myself in readiness  to take Aunt Adelaide's place at any moment.\"    \"Not with my consent,\" said Mr. Dinsmore emphatically; \"if you consider  yourself at all under my authority you will take a week at least of entire  rest and relaxation.\"    She looked at him with her own sweet smile, full of filial love and  reverence, and putting her hand in his, said, \"Yes, my dear father, that  is still one of my great happinesses, as it has been almost ever since I  can remember. Ah, it is often very restful to me just to resign myself to  your wise, loving guidance and control!\"    His fingers closed over the small, daintily gloved hand, holding it in a  warm and tender clasp.    \"Then do not forget that you are not to undertake anything that can tax  your strength, without my knowledge and permission. Nor must you, Rose,\"  he added with playful authority, turning an affectionate, smiling glance  upon her; \"you too are worn out and must have rest.\"    \"Well, my dear,\" she said laughingly, \"I make no rash promises. You know I  never have equalled Elsie in submissiveness.\"    \"No; and yet you have usually shown yourself amenable to authority.\"    \"Perhaps because it has so seldom been exerted,\" she saucily returned. \"My  dear, we have not yet had our first quarrel.\"    \"And have lived together for thirty odd years. I think it would hardly be  worth while to begin after so long a delay.\"    \"Nor do I,\" she said, \"therefore shall probably yield to your wishes in  this matter--or commands, call them what you will; especially as they are  in full accord with my own inclinations.\"    \"Elsie,\" he said, turning to his daughter again, \"I have taken the liberty  of inviting some guests to Ion this morning.\"    \"Liberty, papa!\" she exclaimed. \"It would be impossible for you to take  liberties with me or mine; I consider your rights and authority in any  house of mine fully equal, if not superior to my own. If the mistress of  the mansion be subject to your control,\" she added, with a bright look up  into his face, and much of the old time archness in her smile, \"surely all  else must be.\"    \"Thank you, daughter; then I have not taken a liberty, but I have invited  the guests all the same. You do not ask how it happened or who they are,  but I proceed to explain.    \"In glancing over the morning paper, while you and Rose were attiring  yourselves for the drive, I saw among the items of news that Donald Keith  is in our city. So I dispatched Solon with a carriage and a hastily  written note, asking Donald to come out to see us, bringing with him any  friend or friends he might choose.\"    \"I am glad you did, papa; they shall have a warm welcome. But will it not  make it necessary for us to return home earlier than we intended?\"    \"No, not at all, it is not likely they will arrive until near our dinner  hour--if they come at all to-day, and if they should be there earlier,  Violet is quite capable of entertaining them.\"    \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Dinsmore, \"I know of no one more competent to minister to  the enjoyment of either grown people or children. As regards talent,  sweetness of disposition, and utter unselfishness combined,"]]]
