The crocodile, which came with it, has, like it also, been  compelled to beat a retreat. Lord of the river throughout all ancient  times, worshipped and protected in some provinces, execrated and  proscribed in others, it might still be seen in the neighbourhood of  Cairo towards the beginning of our century. In 1840, it no longer passed  beyond the neighbourhood of Gebel et-Ter, nor beyond that of Manfalut  in Thirty years later, Mariette asserted that it was steadily retreating  before the guns of tourists, and the disturbance which the regular  passing of steamboats produced in the deep waters. To-day, no one knows  of a single crocodile existing below Aswan, but it continues to infest  Nubia, and the rocks of the first cataract: one of them is occasionally  carried down by the current into Egypt where it is speedily despatched  by the fellahin, or by some traveller in quest of adventure. The  fertility of the soil, and the vastness of the lakes and marshes,  attract many migratory birds; passerinae and palmipedes flock thither  from all parts of the Mediterranean. Our European swallows, our  quails, our geese and wild ducks, our herons--to mention only the  most familiar--come here to winter, sheltered from cold and inclement  weather.    [Illustration: 044.jpg THE IBIS OF EGYPT.]    Even the non-migratory birds are really, for the most part, strangers  acclimatized by long sojourn. Some of them--the turtledove, the magpie,  the kingfisher, the partridge, and the sparrow-may be classed with our  European species, while others betray their equatorial origin in the  brightness of their colours. White and black ibises, red flamingoes,  pelicans, and cormorants enliven the waters of the river, and animate  the reedy swamps of the Delta in infinite variety. They are to be seen  ranged in long files upon the sand-banks, fishing and basking in the  sun; suddenly the flock is seized with panic, rises heavily, and settles  away further off. In hollows of the hills, eagle and falcon, the merlin,  the bald-headed vulture, the kestrel, the golden sparrow-hawk, find  inaccessible retreats, whence they descend upon the plains like so many  pillaging and well-armed barons. A thousand little chattering birds come  at eventide to perch in flocks upon the frail boughs of tamarisk and  acacia.    [Illustration: 045.jpg THE MORMYRUS OXYRHYNCHUS.]    Many sea-fish make their way upstream to swim in fresh waters-shad,  mullet, perch, and labrus--and carry their excursions far into the Said.  Those species which are not Mediterranean came originally, still come  annually, from the heart of Ethiopia with the of the Nile, including two  kinds of Alestes, the elled turtle, the Bagrus docmac, and the mormyrus.  Some attain to a gigantic size, the Bagrus bayad and the turtle to about  one yard, the latus to three and a half yards in length, while others,  such as the sihlrus (catfish), are noted for their electric properties.  Nature seems to have made the fahaka (the globe-fish) in a fit of  playfulness. It is a long fish from beyond the cataracts, and it is  carried by the Nile the more easily on account of the faculty it has of  filling itself with air, and inflating its body at will.    [Illustration: 046.jpg AHAKA]    When swelled out immoderately, the fahaka overbalances, and drifts along  upside down, its belly to the wind, covered with spikes so that it looks  like a hedgehog. During the inundation, it floats with the current from  one canal to another, and is cast by the retreating waters upon the  muddy fields, where it becomes the prey of birds or of jackals, or  serves as a plaything for children.    [Illustration: 47.jpg TWO FISHERMEN CARRYING A LATUS. 1]         1 Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a Medum painting.    Petrie,       _Medum_, pl. xii.    Everything is dependent upon the river:--the soil, the produce of the  soil, the species of animals it bears, the birds which it feeds: and  hence it was the Egyptians placed the river among their gods. They  personified it as a man with regular features, and a vigorous and  portly body, such as befits the rich of high lineage. His breasts, fully  developed like those of a woman, though less firm, hang heavily upon a  wide bosom where the fat lies in folds. A narrow girdle, whose ends fall  free about the thighs, supports his spacious abdomen, and his attire  is completed by sandals, and a close-fitting head-dress, generally  surmounted with a crown of water-plants. Sometimes water springs from  his breast; sometimes he presents a frog, or libation vases; or holds a  bundle of the cruces ansato, as symbols of life; or bears a flat tray,  full of offerings--bunches of flowers, ears of corn, heaps of fish,  and geese tied together by the feet. The inscriptions call him, \"Hapi,  father of the gods, lord of sustenance, who maketh food to be, and  covereth the two lands of Egypt with his products; who giveth life,  banisheth want, and filleth the granaries to overflowing.\" He is evolved  into two personages, one being sometimes coloured red, and the other  blue. The former, who wears a cluster of lotus-flowers upon his head,  presides over the Egypt of the south; the latter has a bunch of papyrus  for his head-dress, and watches over the Delta.[**]         [**]  Wilkinson was the first who suggested that this god,       when painted red was the Red (that is High) Nile and when       painted blue, was to be identified with the Low Nile.       This opinion has since been generally adopted; but to me it       does not appear so incontrovertible as it has been       considered. Here, as in other cases, the difference in       colour is only a means of making the distinction between two       personages obvious to sight.    Two goddesses, corresponding to the two Hapis--Mirit Qimait for Upper,  and Mirit Mihit for Lower Egypt--personified the banks of the river.  They are often represented as standing with outstretched arms, as though  begging for the water which should make them fertile. The Nile-god had  his chapel in every province, and priests whose right it was to bury all  bodies of men or beasts cast up by the river; for the god had claimed  them, and to his servants they belonged.    [Illustration: 048.jpg THE NILE GOD. 1]         1 THE NILE GOD: Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, after a statue in       the British Museum. The dedication of this statue took place       about 880 B.c. The giver was Sheshonqu, high-priest of Amon       in Thebes, afterwards King of Egypt under the name of       Sheshhonqu II., and he is represented as standing behind the       leg of the god.    [Illustration: 049.jpg THE Shrine Of The Nile At Biggeh.1]         1 Reproduced from a bas-relief in the small temple of       Philae, built by Rajan and his successors.    The window or       door of this temple opened upon gen, and by comparing the       drawing of the Egyptian artist with the view i the end of       the chamber, it is easy to recognize the original of this       cliff bouette in the piled-up rocks of the island.    By a       mistake of the modern copyist's, his drawing faces the wrong       way.    Several towns were dedicated to him: Hathapi, Nuit-Hapi, Nilo-polis.  It was told in the Thebaid how the god dwelt within a grotto, or shrine  (tophit), in the island of Biggeh, whence he issued at the inundation.  This tradition dates from a time when the cataract was believed to be at  the end of the world, and to bring down the heavenly river upon earth.  Two yawning gulfs (_qoriti_), at the foot of the two granite cliffs  (_moniti_) between which it ran, gave access to this mysterious retreat.  A bas-relief from Philae represents blocks of stone piled one above  another, the vulture of the south and the hawk of the north, each  perched on a summit, wearing a panther skin, with both arms upheld in  adoration. The statue is mutilated: the end of the nose, the beard, and  part of the tray have disappeared, but are restored in the illustration.  The two little birds hanging alongside the geese, together with a bunch  of ears of corn, are fat quails, and the circular chamber wherein Hapi  crouches concealed, clasping a libation vase in either hand. A single  coil of a serpent outlines the contour of this chamber, and leaves a  narrow passage between its overlapping head and tail through which the  rising waters may overflow at the time appointed, bringing to Egypt \"all  things good, and sweet, and pure,\" whereby gods and men are fed. Towards  the summer solstice, at the very moment when the sacred water from the  gulfs of Syene reached Silsileh, the priests of the place, sometimes the  reigning sovereign, or one of his sons, sacrificed a bull and geese, and  then cast into the waters a sealed roll of papyrus. This was a written  order to do all that might insure to Egypt the benefits of a normal  inundation. When Pharaoh himself deigned to officiate, the memory of  the event was preserved by a stela engraved upon the rocks. Even in his  absence, the festivals of the Nile were among the most solemn and joyous  of the land. According to a tradition transmitted from age to age, the  prosperity or adversity of the year was dependent upon the splendour  and fervour with which they were celebrated. Had the faithful shown the  slightest lukewarmness, the Nile might have refused to obey the command  and failed to spread freely over the surface of the country. Peasants  from a distance, each bringing his own provisions, ate their meals  together for days, and lived in a state of brutal intoxication as long  as this kind of fair lasted. On the great day itself, the priests came  forth in procession from the sanctuary, bearing the statue of the god  along the banks, to the sound of instruments and the chanting of hymns.

The exports in that year were  34,844 flasks, or 13,666 less than in 1876.

On Monday evening, January 29, 1877, a meeting of this Academy was  held at the School of Mines, Columbia College, Dr. J.S. Newberry,  President, in the chair. Mr. A.A. Julian, A.M., read a paper on the      PREPARATION OF ROCK AND MINERAL SECTIONS FOR MICROSCOPIC STUDY.    The speaker described in detail the various operations, exhibited the  different kinds of apparatus employed, showed the operations, and  exhibited the finished sections. In some rocks a thin chip can be  broken off, others require to be sawn, and for the latter purpose the  diamond saw is best. Having obtained the chip, it is first polished on  one side, then cemented to a little square of glass, and the other  side polished in the same way. The sections must not be too thick, nor  too thin; they are usually made from a hundredth to a thousandth of an  inch thick. Lathes employed in polishing minerals require to be  provided with conical spindles, so that the wear, due to grit and  emery dust getting on them, may be readily taken up. The grinding  wheel may be either horizontal or vertical; the former has the  advantage that the mineral can be held in either hand; with the latter  only the right hand can be employed, and that in an awkward and  tiresome position. Mr. Julian then referred briefly to the kinds of  emery, its preparation by elutriation, etc., and cautioned operators  against using rouge or tin putty powder in polishing rock sections,  although they may be employed in polishing certain minerals and gems.  The object of making the rock sections being to study their  constituents and determine what minerals enter into their composition,  it is important that no foreign substance, liable to adhere to the  specimen and to be mistaken for one of its ingredients, be placed on  the section while grinding. Lastly, the minerals are mounted on glass,  with or without covers, by means of Canada balsam. Square glasses are  to be preferred to the long and narrow strips, usually employed, as  less liable to break in the center, and more easily revolved on the  stage of a microscope.    Mr. L.H. Landy then exhibited, by means of the gas microscope, several  beautiful rock sections, both American and German. The same gentleman  also showed the effect of passing polarized light through certain  crystal sections, the black cross and rainbow-hued rings revolving  like so many wheels as the polarizer was turned.    At the conclusion of this brilliant exhibition, Dr. P.T. Austen made  some remarks on      LABORATORY MANIPULATIONS.    The points referred to were the apparently unimportant details which  often contribute so much to the ease and pleasure of working. First,  the use of square pieces of felt, such as are used under beer glasses  in saloons, for setting hot beakers and flasks on to prevent chilling  and consequent cracking. Second, in crystallizing substances for  examination under the microscope; one watch glass is placed upon  another with the substance between them, and the upper glass filled  with ether, the cold produced by its evaporation hastening the  crystallization. Third, removing precipitates and solid matter from  flasks, by heating to boiling, and inverting in a vessel of water.  Fourth, crystallization by gradual dilution. Fifth, filter paper  without ash. In German laboratories it is customary to dissolve out  the mineral matter from white filtering paper by washing in dilute  hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids. Sixth, the use of infusorial  silica for drying purposes. Being very porous, it will absorb five  times its own volume of water. If a filter paper, holding a wet  precipitate, be placed upon a layer of this earth, it will become  quite dry in a very short space of time. Mr. Austen also remarked that  substances retain their heat for several days when placed in cork  boxes. To keep a substance air-tight, it may be placed in a flask, the  neck painted with a solution of india rubber in chloroform, and a  plate of glass laid upon it. The solvent quickly evaporates, leaving a  delicate film of rubber, which holds the glass tightly in place.    The next meeting of the Chemical Section will be held February 12; of  the Mineralogical Section, February 19.           *       *       *       *       *          ANNUAL REPORT OF THE PATENT OFFICE.      The annual report to Congress of the Commissioner of Patents, for the  year 1876, has made its appearance.    The amount received on applications for patents, reissues, designs,  extensions, caveats, disclaimers, appeals, trade marks, labels,  copies, etc., was $757,987.65. The amount paid for salaries was  $425,930; other expenses, $226,612. Total payments, $652,542.      Number of applications for patents during the year 1876         21,425    Number of patents issued, including reissues and designs        15,595    Number of applications for extension of patents                      2    Number of patents extended                                           3    Number of caveats filed during the year                          2,697    Number of patents expired during the year                          814    Number of patents allowed but not issued for want of final fee   3,353    Number of applications for registering of trade marks            1,081    Number of trade marks registered                                   959    Number of applications for registering of labels                   650    Number of labels registered                                        402    Of the patents granted there were to--      Citizens of the United States                                   16,239    Subjects of Great Britain                                          511    Subjects of France                                                 104    Subjects of other foreign governments                              172                                                                     -----    Total                                                           17,026    The number of applications for patents was a little less than during  the previous year. The Commissioner suggests that Congress should  appropriate $50,000 to promote the printing of the old patents; that  additional examiners be employed, and more clerks, for the purpose of  expediting the business of the office; that the price of the Official  Gazette be reduced, also the fee for trade mark registration; that the  library fund be increased; that more space be provided for models, and  for the transaction of business.    In respect to the Centennial, the value of new improvements, and the  service of the Patent Office in stimulating discovery, the Acting  Commissioner speaks as follows:        \"The display made at the Exposition by the Patent Office was      creditable in every respect, and excited general attention.      About 5,000 models of inventions, representing the leading      branches of the arts and manufactures, were exhibited in      suitable cases, and properly labeled, the various publications      of the Office were displayed, its practice fully explained to      all inquirers, and copies of the Patent Laws and the Office      regulations and forms freely distributed. The knowledge of our      patent system thus imparted to foreigners and all others unable      to visit Washington has more than repaid the small cost      attendant upon the representation. The exhibits were sent from      and returned to the Office with scarcely any damage being      suffered.        \"But the array of models, etc., made by the Patent Office at the      Exposition was not needed to illustrate the value of our patent      practice. The wisdom of that system was demonstrated in the most      practical and triumphant manner in nearly every branch of that      munificent enterprise. Not only in the grand display of      labor-saving machinery, but in the vast collection of      manufactured articles, and even in the department of fine arts,      were seen the fruits of that provision in our Constitution      giving to Congress the power 'to promote the progress of science      and the useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and      inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and      discoveries.'        \"Whatever persons may do in a 'perfect condition of society' in      sharing, without price, the fruits of their labors with others,      it must be apparent to the dullest observer that the wonderful      growth of the useful arts in this country is due, thus far, to      the protection given by our Government to property in      inventions--a property as sacred as any other class of property,      and whose value is determined by the same general law of supply      and demand.        \"It may be safely said that two thirds of the manufacturing      interests of the country are based upon patents, and the welfare      of all such interests are intimately connected with the welfare      of the patent system. During the past seven years a larger      number of applications for patents were filed and patents      granted than during the entire seventy-eight"]]]
