Then, that we do  not employ our tongue to instigate or counsel thereto. Further, that we  neither use nor assent to any kind of means or methods whereby any one  may be injured. And finally, that the heart be not ill disposed toward  any one, nor from anger and hatred wish him ill, so that body and soul  may be innocent in regard to every one, but especially those who wish  you evil or inflict such upon you. For to do evil to one who wishes and  does you good is not human, but diabolical.    Secondly, under this commandment not only he is guilty who does evil to  his neighbor, but he also who can do him good, prevent, resist evil,  defend and save him, so that no bodily harm or hurt happen to him and  yet does not do it. If, therefore, you send away one that is naked when  you could clothe him, you have caused him to freeze to death; you see  one suffer hunger and do not give him food, you have caused him to  starve. So also, if you see any one innocently sentenced to death or in  like distress, and do not save him, although you know ways and means to  do so, you have killed him. And it will not avail you to make the  pretext that you did not afford any help, counsel, or aid thereto for  you have withheld your love from him and deprived him of the benefit  whereby his life would have been saved.    Therefore God also rightly calls all those murderers who do not afford  counsel and help in distress and danger of body and life, and will pass  a most terrible sentence upon them in the last day, as Christ Himself  has announced when He shall say, Matt.25, 42f.: I was an hungered, and  ye gave Me no meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave Me no drink; I was a  stranger, and ye took Me not in; naked, and ye clothed Me not; sick and  in prison and ye visited Me not. That is: You would have suffered Me  and Mine to die of hunger thirst, and cold, would have suffered the  wild beasts to tear us to pieces, or left us to rot in prison or perish  in distress. What else is that but to reproach them as murderers and  bloodhounds? For although you have not actually done all this, you have  nevertheless, so far as you were concerned, suffered him to pine and  perish in misfortune.    It is just as if I saw some one navigating and laboring in deep water  [and struggling against adverse winds] or one fallen into fire, and  could extend to him the hand to pull him out and save him, and yet  refused to do it. What else would I appear, even in the eyes of the  world, than as a murderer and a criminal?    Therefore it is God's ultimate purpose that we suffer harm to befall no  man, but show him all good and love; and, as we have said it is  specially directed toward those who are our enemies. For to do good to  our friends is but an ordinary heathen virtue as Christ says Matt. 5,  46.    Here we have again the Word of God whereby He would encourage and urge  us to true noble and sublime works, as gentleness patience, and, in  short, love and kindness to our enemies, and would ever remind us to  reflect upon the First Commandment, that He is our God, that is, that  He will help, assist, and protect us, in order that He may thus quench  the desire of revenge in us.    This we ought to practice and inculcate and we would have our hands  full doing good works. But this would not be preaching for monks; it  would greatly detract from the religious estate, and infringe upon the  sanctity of Carthusians, and would even be regarded as forbidding good  works and clearing the convents. For in this wise the ordinary state of  Christians would be considered just as worthy, and even worthier, and  everybody would see how they mock and delude the world with a false,  hypocritical show of holiness, because they have given this and other  commandments to the winds, and have esteemed them unnecessary, as  though they were not commandments but mere counsels, and have at the  same time shamelessly proclaimed and boasted their hypocritical estate  and works as the most perfect life, in order that they might lead a  pleasant, easy life, without the cross and without patience, for which  reason, too, they have resorted to the cloisters, so that they might  not be obliged to suffer any wrong from any one or to do him any good.  But know now that these are the true, holy, and godly works, in which,  with all the angels He rejoices, in comparison with which all human  holiness is but stench and filth, and besides, deserves nothing but  wrath and damnation.    The Sixth Commandment.    Thou shalt not commit adultery.    These commandments now [that follow] are easily understood from [the  explanation of] the preceding; for they are all to the effect that we  [be careful to] avoid doing any kind of injury to our neighbor. But  they are arranged in fine [elegant] order. In the first place, they  treat of his own person. Then they proceed to the person nearest him,  or the closest possession next after his body namely, his wife, who is  one flesh and blood with him, so that we cannot inflict a higher injury  upon him in any good that is his. Therefore it is explicitly forbidden  here to bring any disgrace upon him in respect to his wife. And it  really aims at adultery, because among the Jews it was ordained and  commanded that every one must be married. Therefore also the young were  early provided for [married], so that the virgin state was held in  small esteem, neither were public prostitution and lewdness tolerated  (as now). Therefore adultery was the most common form of unchastity  among them.    But because among us there is such a shameful mess and the very dregs  of all vice and lewdness, this commandment is directed also against all  manner of unchastity, whatever it may be called; and not only is the  external act forbidden, but also every kind of cause, incitement, and  means, so that the heart, the lips, and the whole body may be chaste  and afford no opportunity, help, or persuasion to unchastity. And not  only this, but that we also make resistance, afford protection and  rescue wherever there is danger and need; and again, that we give help  and counsel, so as to maintain our neighbor's honor. For whenever you  omit this when you could make resistance, or connive at it as if it did  not concern you, you are as truly guilty as the one perpetrating the  deed. Thus, to state it in the briefest manner, there is required this  much, that every one both live chastely himself and help his neighbor  do the same, so that God by this commandment wishes to hedge round  about and protect [as with a rampart] every spouse that no one trespass  against them.    But since this commandment is aimed directly at the state of matrimony  and gives occasion to speak of the same, you must well understand and  mark, first, how gloriously God honors and extols this estate, inasmuch  as by His commandment He both sanctions and guards it. He has  sanctioned it above in the Fourth Commandment: Honor thy father and thy  mother; but here He has (as we said ) hedged it about and protected it.  Therefore He also wishes us to honor it, and to maintain and conduct it  as a divine and blessed estate; because, in the first place, He has  instituted it before all others, and therefore created man and woman  separately (as is evident), not for lewdness, but that they should  [legitimately] live together, be fruitful, beget children, and nourish  and train them to the honor of God.    Therefore God has also most richly blessed this estate above all  others, and, in addition, has bestowed on it and wrapped up in it  everything in the world, to the end that this estate might be well and  richly provided for. Married life is therefore no jest or presumption;  but it is an excellent thing and a matter of divine seriousness. For it  is of the highest importance to Him that persons be raised who may  serve the world and promote the knowledge of God, godly living, and all  virtues, to fight against wickedness and the devil.    Therefore I have always taught that this estate should not be despised  nor held in disrepute, as is done by the blind world and our false  ecclesiastics, but that it be regarded according to God's Word, by  which it is adorned and sanctified, so that it is not only placed on an  equality with other estates, but that it precedes and surpasses them  all, whether they be that of emperor, princes, bishops, or whoever they  please. For both ecclesiastical and civil estates must humble  themselves and all be found in this estate as we shall hear. Therefore  it is not a peculiar estate, but the most common and noblest estate,  which pervades all Christendom, yea which extends through all the  world.    In the second place, you must know also that it is not only an  honorable, but also a necessary state, and it is solemnly commanded by  God that, in general, in all conditions, men and women, who were  created for it, shall be found in this estate; yet with some exceptions  (although few) whom God has especially excepted, so that they are not  fit for the married estate, or whom He has released by a high,  supernatural gift that they can maintain chastity without this estate.  For where nature has its course, as it is implanted by God, it is not  possible to remain chaste without marriage. For flesh and blood remain  flesh and blood, and the natural inclination and excitement have their  course without let or hindrance, as everybody sees and feels. In  order, therefore, that it may be the more easy in some degree to avoid  unchastity, God has commanded the estate of matrimony, that every one  may have his proper portion and be satisfied therewith; although God's  grace besides is required in order that the heart also may be pure.    From this you see how this popish rabble, priests, monks, and nuns,  resist God's order and commandment, inasmuch as they despise and forbid  matrimony, and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17221"],[0,"History of the Plague in London (#10)"],[1,"appear.         _Sequestration of the Sick._         As soon as any man shall be found by this examiner, chirurgeon, or       searcher, to be sick of the plague, he shall the same night be       sequestered in the same house; and in case he be so sequestered,       then, though he die not, the house wherein he sickened shall be       shut up for a month after the use of the due preservatives taken by       the rest.         _Airing the Stuff._         For sequestration of the goods and stuff of the infection, their       bedding and apparel, and hangings of chambers, must be well aired       with fire, and such perfumes as are requisite, within the infected       house, before they be taken again to use.

And that no children be suffered, at time of burial of any corpse,       in any church, churchyard, or burying place, to come near the       corpse, coffin, or grave; and that all graves shall be at least six       feet deep.

And if any broker or other person shall buy       any bedding, apparel, or other stuff out of any infected house,       within two months after the infection hath been there, his house       shall be shut up as infected, and so shall continue shut up twenty       days at the least.         _No Person to be conveyed out of any Infected House._         If any person visited[82] do fortune,[83] by negligent looking       unto, or by any other means, to come or be conveyed from a place       infected to any other place, the parish from whence such party hath       come, or been conveyed, upon notice thereof given, shall, at their       charge, cause the said party so visited and escaped to be carried       and brought back again by night; and the parties in this case       offending to be punished at the direction of the alderman of the       ward, and the house of the receiver of such visited person to be       shut up for twenty days.         _Every Visited House to be marked._         That every house visited be marked with a red cross of a foot long,       in the middle of the door, evident to be seen, and with these usual       printed words, that is to say, \"Lord have mercy upon us,\" to be set       close over the same cross, there to continue until lawful opening       of the same house.         _Every Visited House to be watched._         That the constables see every house shut up, and to be attended       with watchmen, which may keep in, and minister necessaries to them       at their own charges, if they be able, or at the common charge if       they be unable.

ORDERS FOR CLEANSING AND KEEPING OF THE STREETS SWEPT.         _The Streets to be kept Clean._         First, it is thought necessary, and so ordered, that every       householder do cause the street to be daily prepared before his       door, and so to keep it clean swept all the week long.         _That Rakers take it from out the Houses._         That the sweeping and filth of houses be daily carried away by the       rakers, and that the raker shall give notice of his coming by the       blowing of a horn, as hitherto hath been done.         _Laystalls_[85] _to be made far off from the City._         That the laystalls be removed as far as may be out of the city and       common passages, and that no nightman or other be suffered to empty       a vault into any vault or garden near about the city.         _Care to be had of Unwholesome Fish or Flesh, and of Musty Corn._         That special care be taken that no stinking fish, or unwholesome       flesh, or musty corn, or other corrupt fruits, of what sort soever,       be suffered to be sold about the city or any part of the same.

ORDERS CONCERNING LOOSE PERSONS AND IDLE ASSEMBLIES.         _Beggars._         Forasmuch as nothing is more complained of than the multitude of       rogues and wandering beggars that swarm about in every place about       the city, being a great cause of the spreading of the infection,       and will not be avoided[87] notwithstanding any orders that have       been given to the contrary: it is therefore now ordered that such       constables, and others whom this matter may any way concern, take       special care that no wandering beggars be suffered in the streets       of this city, in any fashion or manner whatsoever, upon the penalty       provided by law to be duly and severely executed upon them.         _Plays._         That all plays, bear baitings,[88] games, singing of ballads,       buckler play,[89] or such like causes of assemblies of people, be       utterly prohibited, and the parties offending severely punished by       every alderman in his ward.         _Feasting prohibited._         That all public feasting, and particularly by the companies[90] of       this city, and dinners in taverns, alehouses, and other places of       public entertainment, be forborne till further order and allowance,       and that the money thereby spared be preserved, and employed for       the benefit and relief of the poor visited with the infection.         _Tippling-Houses._         That disorderly tippling in taverns, alehouses, coffeehouses, and       cellars, be severely looked unto as the common sin of the time, and       greatest occasion of dispersing the plague.
