On the 8th, the Germans, who  had in great haste reinforced their right by bringing their Second  and Fourth Army Corps back to the north, obtained some successes by  attacks of extreme violence. They occupied Betz, Thury-en-Valois, and  Nanteuil-le-Haudouin. But in spite of this pressure our troops held  their ground well. In a brilliant action they took three standards, and,  being reinforced, prepared a new attack for the 10th. At the moment that  this attack was about to begin the enemy was already in retreat toward  the north. The attack became a pursuit, and on the 12th we established  ourselves on the Aisne.      LEFT OF KLUCK'S ARMY THREATENED.    Why did the German forces which were confronting us and on the evening  before attacking so furiously retreat on the morning of the 10th?  Because in bringing back on the 6th several army corps from the south to  the north to face our left the enemy had exposed his left to the attacks  of the British Army, which had immediately faced around toward the  north, and to those of our armies which were prolonging the English  lines to the right. This is what the French command had sought to bring  about. This is what happened on Sept. 8 and allowed the development and  rehabilitation which it was to effect.    On the 6th the British Army had set out from the line Rozcy-Lagny and  had that evening reached the southward bank of the Grand Morin. On the  7th and 8th it continued its march, and on the 9th had debouched to the  north of the Marne below Chateau-Thiery, taking in flank the German  forces which on that day were opposing, on the Ourcq, our left army.  Then it was that these forces began to retreat, while the British Army,  going in pursuit and capturing seven guns and many prisoners, reached  the Aisne between Soissons and Longueval.    The role of the French Army, which was operating to the right of the  British Army, was threefold. It had to support the British attacking on  its left. It had on its right to support our centre, which from Sept. 7  had been subjected to a German attack of great violence. Finally, its  mission was to throw back the three active army corps and the reserve  corps which faced it.    On the 7th it made a leap forward, and on the following days reached and  crossed the Marne, seizing, after desperate fighting, guns, howitzers,  mitrailleuses, and 1,300,000 cartridges. On the 12th it established  itself on the north edge of the Montagne-de-Reime in contact with our  centre, which for its part had just forced the enemy to retreat in  haste.      THE ACTION OF FERE-CHAMPENOISE.    Our centre consisted of a new army created on Aug. 29 and of one of  those which at the beginning of the campaign had been engaged in Belgian  Luxemburg. The first had retreated on Aug. 29 to Sept. 5 from the Aisne  to the north of the Marne and occupied the general front Sezanne-Mailly.    The second, more to the east, had drawn back to the south of the line  Humbauville-Chateau-Beauchamp-Bignicourt-Blesmes-Maurupt-le-Montoy.    The enemy, in view of his right being arrested and the defeat of his  enveloping movement, made a desperate effort from the 7th to the 10th to  pierce our centre to the west and to the east of Fere-Champenoise. On  the 8th he succeeded in forcing back the right of our new army, which  retired as far as Gouragancon. On the 9th, at 6 o'clock in the morning,  there was a further retreat to the south of that village, while on the  left the other army corps also had to go back to the line  Allemant-Connantre.    Despite this retreat the General commanding the army ordered a general  offensive for the same day. With the Morocco Division, whose behavior  was heroic, he met a furious assault of the Germans on his left toward  the marshes of Saint Gond. Then with the division which had just  victoriously overcome the attacks of the enemy to the north of Sezanne,  and with the whole of his left army corps, he made a flanking attack in  the evening of the 9th upon the German forces, and notably the guard,  which had thrown back his right army corps. The enemy, taken by  surprise by this bold manoeuvre, did not resist, and beat a hasty  retreat.    On the 11th we crossed the Marne between Tours-sur-Marne and Sarry,  driving the Germans in front of us in disorder. On the 12th we were in  contact with the enemy to the north of the Camp de Chalons. Our other  army of the centre, acting on the right of the one just referred to, had  been intrusted with the mission during the 7th, 8th, and 9th of  disengaging its neighbor, and it was only on the 10th that, being  reinforced by an army corps from the east, it was able to make its  action effectively felt. On the 11th the Germans retired. But,  perceiving their danger, they fought desperately, with enormous  expenditure of projectiles, behind strong intrenchments. On the 12th the  result had none the less been attained, and our two centre armies were  solidly established on the ground gained.      THE OPERATIONS OF THE RIGHT.    To the right of these two armies were three others. They had orders to  cover themselves to the north and to debouch toward the west on the  flank of the enemy, which was operating to the west of the Argonne. But  a wide interval in which the Germans were in force separated them from  our centre. The attack took place, nevertheless, with very brilliant  success for our artillery, which destroyed eleven batteries of the  Sixteenth German Army Corps.    On the 10th inst. the Eighth and Fifteenth German Army Corps  counter-attacked, but were repulsed. On the 11th our progress continued  with new successes, and on the 12th we were able to face round toward  the north in expectation of the near and inevitable retreat of the  enemy, which, in fact, took place from the 13th.    The withdrawal of the mass of the German force involved also that of the  left. From the 12th onward the forces of the enemy operating between  Nancy and the Vosges retreated in a hurry before our two armies of the  East, which immediately occupied the positions that the enemy had  evacuated. The offensive of our right had thus prepared and  consolidated in the most useful way the result secured by our left and  our centre.    [Illustration: Map showing the successive stages of the Battle of the  Marne.]    Such was this seven days' battle, in which more than two millions of men  were engaged. Each army gained ground step by step, opening the road to  its neighbor, supported at once by it, taking in flank the adversary  which the day before it had attacked in front, the efforts of one  articulating closely with those of the other, a perfect unity of  intention and method animating the supreme command.    To give this victory all its meaning it is necessary to add that it was  gained by troops which for two weeks had been retreating, and which,  when the order for the offensive was given, were found to be as ardent  as on the first day. It has also to be said that these troops had to  meet the whole German army, and that from the time they marched forward  they never again fell back. Under their pressure the German retreat at  certain times had the appearance of a rout.    In spite of the fatigue of our men, in spite of the power of the German  heavy artillery, we took colors, guns, mitrailleuses, shells, more than  a million cartridges, and thousands of prisoners. A German corps lost  almost the whole of its artillery, which, from information brought by  our airmen, was destroyed by our guns.      \"THE RUSH TO THE SEA.\"    _LONDON, March 18.--The third installment of the historical review of  the war, emanating from French official sources and purely from the  French viewpoint, has been received by The Associated Press. The French  narrative contains a long chapter on the siege war from the Oise to the  Vosges, which lasted from Sept. 13 to Nov. 30. Most of the incidents in  this prolonged and severe warfare have been recorded in the daily  bulletins. The operations were of secondary importance, and were  conducted on both sides with the same idea of wearing down the troops  and the artillery of the opposing forces with the view of influencing  the decisive result in the great theatre of war in the north. The next  chapter deals with \"the rush to the sea,\" Sept. 13 to Oct. 23, and is as  follows:_    GENERAL CHARACTER OF THE ACTION.    As early as Sept. 11 the Commander in Chief had directed our left army  to have as important forces as possible on the right bank of the Oise.  On Sept. 17 he made that instruction more precise by ordering \"a mass to  be constituted on the left wing of our disposition, capable of coping  with the outflanking movement of the enemy.\" Everything led us to expect  that flanking movement, for the Germans are lacking in invention.  Indeed, their effort at that time tended to a renewal of their manoeuvre  of August. In the parallel race the opponents were bound in the end to  be stopped only by the sea; that is what happened about Oct. 20.    The Germans had an advantage over us, which is obvious from a glance at  the map--the concentric form of their front, which shortened the length  of their transports. In spite of this initial inferiority we arrived in  time. From the middle of September to the last week in October fighting  went on continually to the north of the Oise, but all the time we were  fighting we were slipping northward. On the German side this movement  brought into line more than eighteen new army corps, (twelve active army  corps, six reserve corps, four cavalry corps.) On our side it ended in  the constitution of three fresh armies on our left and in the transport  into the same district of the British Army and the Belgian Army from  Antwerp.    For the conception and realization of this fresh and extended  disposition the French command, in the first place, had to reduce to a  minimum the needs for effectives of our armies to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15480"],[0,"New York Times Current History; The European War, Vol 2, No. 3, June, 1915 (#10)"],[1,"war material, as she  had on previous trips._    _The Lokal Anzeiger also assumes that the steamship was carrying  munitions of war, and maintains that this and \"the fact that she was a  fully armed cruiser completely justifies her destruction under the laws  of warfare.\"_    _The Kreuz Zeitung, after referring to the warning issued by Ambassador  von Bernstorff, adds:_    If citizens of neutral States were lost with the sunken ship they must  bear the full blame.    _Some papers further testify the sinking of the steamer because on a  previous occasion she had resorted to the expedient of flying the  American flag. Germania, the clerical organ, deprecates probable  attempts by Germany's antagonists to make moral capital against her out  of the sinking of the Lusitania and the loss of life. The paper says:_    We can look forward to such efforts with a clear conscience, for we have  proceeded correctly. We can only answer to those who place their  sympathies above justice, that war is war.    _An editorial article in the Frankfurter Zeitung was quoted in an  Amsterdam dispatch to The London Times of May 10, as follows:_    The Lusitania has been sent to the bottom. That is the announcement  which must arouse measureless horror among many thousands.    A giant ship of the British merchant fleet, a vessel of over 31,000  tons, one of the most famous of the fast steamers of the  British-American passenger service, a ship full of people, who had  little or nothing to do with the war, has been attacked and sunk by a  German torpedo. This is the announcement which in a few words indicates  a mighty catastrophe to a ship with 2,000 people aboard.    We always feel that it is tragic and all too hard when war inflicts  wounds on those who do not carry its weapons.    We lament similarly the fate of the unfortunate villages and towns where  war rages and the innocent victims of bombs who, far behind the  trenches, and often without our being able to estimate the meaning of  this murder, are snatched from the ranks of the unarmed.    Much more terrible is the fate of those who on the high sea, many  hundreds in number, suddenly see death before their eyes.    A German war vessel has sunk the ship. It has done its duty.    For the German Navy the sinking of the Lusitania means an extraordinary  success. Its destruction demolished the last fable with which the people  of England consoled themselves; on which hostile shipping relied when it  dared to defy the German warnings.    We do not need to seek grounds to justify the destruction of a British  ship. She belonged to the enemy and brought us harm. She has fallen to  our shots.    The enemy and the whole world were warned that he who ventured to trust  himself within her staked his life.    _The London Daily Mail of May 16 quotes from Der Tag the following  article by Herr von Rath, who is described as a favorite spokesman in  the Wilhelmstrasse:_    President Wilson is very much troubled by the drowning of so many  American citizens, and we Germans sincerely share his feelings, but we  see in the Lusitania affair one of the many cruel necessities which the  struggle for existence brings with it.    If, as English reports try to make us believe, Mr. Wilson is now  meditating revenge, we will not disturb him in this occupation, but  would only hope that his demands will be addressed to the right and not  the wrong quarters.    The right address is England. On the German side, everything was done to  warn American travelers from the impending peril, while British  irresponsibility and arrogance nullified the effect of the German  admonition.    Mr. Wilson is certainly in a precarious position. After showing himself  so weak in the face of the long and ruthless British provocations, he  has to play the strong man with Germany. Otherwise he will lose what  prestige he has left, and he knows that in the background the pretender  to the throne, Mr. Roosevelt, is lurking.    But what are the gallant shouters in the United States thinking about?  Should the United States send troops to take part in the fighting in  Flanders? The gigantic losses of their Canadian neighbors should not  exactly encourage them, from a military standpoint. Moreover the United  States are so weak that they have never even been able to impose their  will on Mexico or to do anything to the still more unpleasant Japanese  than to clench their fists in their pockets.    Should their superdreadnoughts cross the Atlantic Ocean? England has  not even useful work for her own ironclads in this war. What would  American warships do?    How about our Germanic brethren in the United States--the half million  German and Austro-Hungarian reservists who are not permitted to take  part in the defense of their home lands? Will they stand with folded  arms and see their fatherlands attacked?    What the United States has already done to support our enemies is, apart  from interference with private property, the worst which she could do to  us. We have nothing more to expect or to fear. Therefore, the threats of  our erstwhile friend Roosevelt leave us quite cold.    Let the United States also preserve up from warmed-up humanitarian  platitudes, for her craven submission to England's will is promoting an  outrageous scheme to deliver Germany's women and children to death by  starvation.    _A wireless dispatch from Berlin to Sayville, L.I., on May 16 reported  this outgiving by the Overseas News Agency:_    The whole German press, particularly the Cologne Gazette, the Frankfort  Gazette and the Berliner Tageblatt, deeply regret the loss of American  lives caused by the sinking of the Lusitania.    The Tages Zeitung and other newspapers state that the responsibility  rests with the British Government, which, attempting to starve the  peaceful civilian population of a big country, forced Germany in  self-defense to declare British waters a war zone; with shipowners, who  allowed passengers to embark on an armed steamer carrying war material,  and neglected German warnings against entering the war zone, and,  finally, with the English press.    Heartfelt sympathy is expressed by the German press and public for the  victims of the catastrophe and their relatives.    _From The Hague, via London, on May 19 a special cable to_ THE NEW YORK  TIMES _reported that, acting apparently under official instructions,  several leading German newspapers had on that day joined in a fierce  attack on the United States, making a concerted demand that Germany  refuse to yield to the American protest._    _Practically all these newspapers repeat the same arguments, declaring  that neutrals entering the war zone do so at their own risk, and that  the Americans aboard the Lusitania \"were shielding contraband goods with  their persons.\" The Berliner Tageblatt said:_    The demand of the Washington Government must be rejected. Indeed, the  whole note hardly merits serious consideration. Its \"firm tone\" is only  a cloak to hide America's consciousness of her own culpability. If  American citizens, in spite of the warnings of the German Admiralty,  intrusted themselves on the Lusitania, the blame for the consequences  falls on themselves and their Government.    Can the United States affirm that there were no munitions aboard? If  not, it has not the shadow of a right to protest.      GERMAN-AMERICAN PRESS COMMENTS.    _Under the heading \"The President's Note,\" Herman Ridder, editor of the  New Yorker Staats-Zeitung, one of the leading German-American  newspapers, said in that publication on May 15:_    The attitude assumed by the President, in the note delivered yesterday  to the German Government, toward the infringement of our rights on the  seas is diplomatically correct and must compel the support of the entire  American people.    We have suffered grievously at the hands of more than one of the  belligerent nations, but for the moment we are dealing only with  Germany. The note recites a series of events which the Government of the  United States could not silently pass by, and demands reparation for  American lives lost and American property already destroyed and a  guarantee that the rights of the United States and its citizens shall be  observed in the future. All this the German Government may well grant,  frankly and unreservedly and without loss of honor or prestige. It  would be incomprehensible if it did not do so.    The note admits, as most diplomatic documents do, of two  interpretations. They will be applied to it variously, as the reader is  inclined to pessimism or to optimism. It is a document in which lies the  choice of war or peace evenly balanced. I prefer to read into it all the  optimism which can be derived from the knowledge that two nations,  historically like-minded and bound to one another by strong ties of  friendship, seldom go to war over matters which can be settled without  resort to the arbitrament of arms. There is no question outstanding  today between the United States and Germany which cannot be settled  through diplomatic channels. I am inclined all the more to this optimism  by the temperament and character of the President of the United for the  time being.    I see in the note great possibilities for good. The undersea activities  of the German Navy in their effect upon the rights of the United States  and its citizens form, properly, the burden of its argument. We are  addressing Germany, and it is only over her submarine policy that our  interests have clashed with hers. The note takes cognizance, however, of  the inter-relation of Germany's submarine policy and the British policy  of \"starving out Germany.\" The President has opened an avenue to the  full discussion of the rights and obligations of submarines in naval  warfare, and when Germany has stated her case it is not only not  impossible but it is highly probable that he will be asked to suggest a  modus vivendi by which the objectionable"]]]
