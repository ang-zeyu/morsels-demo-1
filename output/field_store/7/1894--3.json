Gluck's death, in 1787, was caused by overindulgence in wine at a dinner  which he gave to some of his friends. The love of stimulants had grown  upon him in his old age, and had become almost a passion. An enforced  abstinence of some months was succeeded by a debauch, in which he drank  an immense quantity of brandy. The effects brought on a fit of apoplexy,  of which he died, aged seventy-three.    Gluck's place in musical history is peculiar and well marked, he entered  the field of operatic composition when it was hampered with a great  variety of dry forms, and utterly without soul and poetic spirit. The  object of composers seemed to be to show mere contrapuntal learning, or  to furnish singers opportunity to display vocal agility. The opera, as  a large and symmetrical expression of human emotions, suggested in the  collisions of a dramatic story, was utterly an unknown quantity in art.  Gluck's attention was early called to this radical inconsistency; and,  though he did not learn for many years to develop his musical ideas  according to a theory, and never carried that theory to the logical  results insisted on by his great after-type, Wagner, he accomplished  much in the way of sweeping reform. He elaborated the recitative or  declamatory element in opera with great care, and insisted that his  singers should make this the object of their most careful efforts. The  arias, duos, quartets, etc., as well as the choruses and orchestral  parts, were made consistent with the dramatic motive and situations.  In a word, Gluck aimed with a single-hearted purpose to make music the  expression of poetry and sentiment.    The principles of Gluck's school of operatic writing may be briefly  summarized as follows: That dramatic music can only reach its highest  power and beauty when joined to a simple and poetic text, expressing  passions true to Nature; that music can be made the language of all the  varied emotions of the heart; that the music of an opera must exactly  follow the rhythm and melody of the words; that the orchestra must be  only used to strengthen and intensify the feeling embodied in the  vocal parts, as demanded by the text or dramatic situation. We get some  further light on these principles from Gluck's letter of dedication to  the Grand-Duke of Tuscany on the publication of \"Alceste.\" He writes: \"I  am of opinion that music must be to poetry what liveliness of color and  a happy mixture of light and shade are for a faultless and well-arranged  drawing, which serve to add life to the figures without injuring the  outlines;... that the overture should prepare the auditors for the  character of the action which is to be presented, and hint at the  progress of the same; that the instruments must be employed according to  the degree of interest and passion; that the composer should avoid too  marked a disparity in the dialogue-between the air and recitative, in  order not to break the sense of a period, or interrupt the energy of the  action.... Finally, I have even felt compelled to sacrifice rules to the  improvement of the effect.\"    We find in this composer's music, therefore, a largeness and dignity  of treatment which have never been surpassed. His command of melody is  quite remarkable, but his use of it is under severe artistic restraint;  for it is always characterized by breadth, simplicity, and directness.  He aimed at and attained the symmetrical balance of an old Greek play.          HAYDN.      I.    \"Papa Haydn!\" Thus did Mozart ever speak of his foster-father in music,  and the title, transmitted to posterity, admirably expressed the sweet,  placid, gentle nature, whose possessor was personally beloved no less  than he was admired. His life flowed, broad and unruffled, like some  great river, unvexed for the most part by the rivalries, jealousies, and  sufferings, oftentimes self-inflicted, which have harassed the careers  of other great musicians. He remained to the last the favorite of the  imperial court of Vienna, and princes followed his remains to their last  resting-place.    Joseph Haydn was the eldest of the twenty children of Matthias Haydn, a  wheelwright at Rohrau, Lower Austria, where he was born in 1732. At  the age of twelve years he was engaged to sing in Vienna. He became a  chorister in St. Stephen's Church, but offended the choir-master by the  revolt on the part of himself and parents from submitting to the usual  means then taken to perpetuate a fine soprano in boys. So Haydn, who had  surreptitiously picked up a good deal of musical knowledge apart from  the art of singing, was at the age of sixteen turned out on the world.  A compassionate barber, however, took him in, and Haydn dressed and  powdered wigs down-stairs, while he worked away at a little worm-eaten  harpsichord at night in his room. Unfortunate boy! he managed to get  himself engaged to the barber's daughter, Anne Keller, who was for a  good while the Xantippe of his gentle life, and he paid dearly for his  father-in-law's early hospitality.    The young musician soon began to be known, as he played the violin in  one church, the organ in another, and got some pupils. His first rise  was his acquaintance with Metastasio, the poet laureate of the court.  Through him, Haydn got introduced to the mistress of the Venetian  embassador, a great musical enthusiast, and in her circle he met  Porpora, the best music-master in the world, but a crusty, snarling old  man. Porpora held at Vienna the position of musical dictator and censor,  and he exercised the tyrannical privileges of his post mercilessly.  Haydn was a small, dark-complexioned, insignificant-looking youth, and  Porpora, of course, snubbed him most contemptuously. But Haydn wanted  instruction, and no one in the world could give it so well as the savage  old _maestro_. So he performed all sorts of menial services for him,  cleaned his shoes, powdered his wig, and ran all his errands. The  result was that Porpora softened and consented to give his young admirer  lessons--no great hardship, for young Haydn proved a most apt and  gifted pupil. And it was not long either before the young musician's  compositions attracted public attention and found a sale. The very  curious relations between Haydn and Porpora are brilliantly sketched in  George Sand's \"Consuelo.\"    At night Haydn, accompanied by his friends, was wont to wander about  Vienna by moonlight, and serenade his patrons with trios and quartets of  his own composition. He happened one night to stop under the window  of Bernardone Kurz, a director of a theatre and the leading clown of  Vienna. Down rushed Kurz very excitedly. \"Who are you?\" he shrieked.  \"Joseph Haydn.\" \"Whose music is it?\" \"Mine.\" \"The deuce it is! And  at your age, too!\" \"Why, I must begin with something.\" \"Come along  up-stairs.\"    The enthusiastic director collared his prize, and was soon deep in  explaining a wonderful libretto, entitled \"The Devil on Two Sticks.\"  To write music for this was no easy matter; for it was to represent all  sorts of absurd things, among others a tempest. The tempest made Haydn  despair, and he sat at the piano, banging away in a reckless fashion,  while the director stood behind him, raving in a disconnected way as  to his meaning. At last the distracted pianist brought his fists  simultaneously down upon the key-board, and made a rapid sweep of all  the notes.    \"Bravo! bravo! that is the tempest!\" cried Kurz.    The buffoon also laid himself on a chair, and had it carried about the  room, during which he threw out his limbs in imitation of the act of  swimming. Haydn supplied an accompaniment so suitable that Kurz soon  landed on _terra firma_, and congratulated the composer, assuring him  that he was the man to compose the opera. By this stroke of good luck  our young musician received one hundred and thirty florins.      II.    At the age of twenty-eight Haydn composed his first symphony. Soon after  this he attracted the attention of the old Prince Esterhazy, all the  members of whose family have become known in the history of music as  generous Maecenases of the art.    \"What! you don't mean to say that little blackamoor\" (alluding to  Haydn's brown complexion and small stature) \"composed that symphony?\"    \"Surely, prince,\" replied the director Friedburg, beckoning to Joseph  Haydn, who advanced toward the orchestra.    \"Little Moor,\" says the old gentleman, \"you shall enter my service. I am  Prince Esterhazy. What's your name?\"    \"Haydn.\"    \"Ah! I've heard of you. Get along and dress yourself like a  _Kapellmeister_. Clap on a new coat, and mind your wig is curled. You're  too short. You shall have red heels; but they shall be high, that your  stature may correspond with your merit.\"    So he went to live at Eisenstadt in the Esterhazy household, and  received a salary of four hundred florins, which was afterward raised to  one thousand by Prince Nicholas Esterhazy. Haydn continued the intimate  friend and associate of Prince Nicholas for thirty years, and death only  dissolved the bond between them. In the Esterhazy household the life of  Haydn was a very quiet one, a life of incessant and happy industry; for  he poured out an incredible number of works, among them not a few of  his most famous ones. So he spent a happy life in hard labor, alternated  with delightful recreations at the Esterhazy country-seat, mountain  rambles, hunting and fishing, open-air concerts, musical evenings, etc.    A French traveler who visited Esterhaz about 1782 says: \"The chateau  stands quite solitary, and the prince sees nobody but his officials  and servants, and strangers who come hither from curiosity. He has  a puppet-theatre, which is certainly unique in character. Here the  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17474"],[0,"How to Listen to Music, 7th ed. (#10)"],[1,"the amateur an admirable  opportunity for orchestral study, Wagner resorts to this device in  some instances for the sake of dramatic characterization. _Elsa_, a  dreamy, melancholy maiden, crushed under the weight of wrongful  accusation, and sustained only by the vision of a seraphic champion  sent by Heaven to espouse her cause, is accompanied on her entrance  and sustained all through her scene of trial by the dulcet tones of  the wood-winds, the oboe most often carrying the melody. _Lohengrin's_  superterrestrial character as a Knight of the Holy Grail is prefigured  in the harmonies which seem to stream from the violins, and in the  prelude tell of the bringing of the sacred vessel of Christ's passion  to Monsalvat; but in his chivalric character he is greeted by the  militant trumpets in a strain of brilliant puissance and rhythmic  energy. Composers have studied the voices of the instruments so long  and well, and have noted the kind of melodies and harmonies in which  the voices are most effective, that they have formulated what might  almost be called an instrumental language. Though the effective  capacity of each instrument is restricted not only by its mechanics,  but also by the quality of its tones--a melody conceived for one  instrument sometimes becoming utterly inexpressive and unbeautiful by  transferrence to another--the range of effects is extended almost to  infinity by means of combination, or, as a painter might say, by  mixing the colors. The art of writing effectively for instruments in  combination is the art of instrumentation or orchestration, in which  Berlioz and Wagner were Past Grand Masters.    [Sidenote: _Number of instruments._]    The number of instruments of each kind in an orchestra may also be  said to depend measurably upon the music, or the use to which the band  is to be put. Neither in instruments nor in numbers is there absolute  identity between a dramatic and a symphonic orchestra. The apparatus  of the former is generally much more varied and complex, because of  the vast development of variety in dramatic expression stimulated by  Wagner.    [Sidenote: _Symphony and dramatic orchestras._]    The modern symphony, especially the symphonic poem, shows the  influence of this dramatic tendency, but not in the same degree. A  comparison between model bands in each department will disclose what  is called the normal orchestral organization. For the comparison (see  page 82), I select the bands of the first Wagner Festival held in  Bayreuth in 1876, the Philharmonic Society of New York, the Boston  Symphony Orchestra, and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.    [Sidenote: _Instruments rarely used._]    Instruments like the corno di bassetto, bass trumpet, tenor tuba,  contra-bass tuba, and contra-bass trombone are so seldom called for in  the music played by concert orchestras that they have no place in  their regular lists. They are employed when needed, however, and the  horns and other instruments are multiplied when desirable effects are  to be obtained by such means.

It is the only choir which has numerous  representation of its constituent units. This was not always so, but  is the fruit of development in the art of instrumentation which is the  newest department in music. Vocal music had reached its highest point  before instrumental music made a beginning as an art. The former was  the pampered child of the Church, the latter was long an outlaw. As  late as the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries instrumentalists were  vagabonds in law, like strolling players. They had none of the rights  of citizenship; the religious sacraments were denied them; their  children were not permitted to inherit property or learn an honourable  trade; and after death the property for which they had toiled  escheated to the crown. After the instruments had achieved the  privilege of artistic utterance, they were for a long time mere  slavish imitators of the human voice. Bach treated them with an  insight into their possibilities which was far in advance of his time,  for which reason he is the most modern composer of the first half of  the eighteenth century; but even in Handel's case the rule was to  treat them chiefly as supports for the voices. He multiplied them just  as he did the voices in his choruses, consorting a choir of oboes and  bassoons, and another of trumpets of almost equal numbers with his  violins.    [Sidenote: _The modern band._]    The so-called purists in England talk a great deal about restoring  Handel's orchestra in performances of his oratorios, utterly unmindful  of the fact that to our ears, accustomed to the myriad-hued orchestra  of to-day, the effect would seem opaque, heavy, unbalanced, and  without charm were a band of oboes to play in unison with the violins,  another of bassoons to double the 'cellos, and half a dozen trumpets  to come flaring and crashing into the musical mass at intervals. Gluck  in the opera, and Haydn and Mozart in the symphony, first disclosed  the charm of the modern orchestra with the wind instruments  apportioned to the strings so as to obtain the multitude of tonal  tints which we admire to-day. On the lines which they marked out the  progress has been exceedingly rapid and far-reaching.    [Sidenote: _Capacity of the orchestra._]    [Sidenote: _The extremes of range._]    In the hands of the latter-day Romantic composers, and with the help  of the instrument-makers, who have marvellously increased the capacity  of the wind instruments, and remedied the deficiencies which  embarrassed the Classical writers, the orchestra has developed into an  instrument such as never entered the mind of the wildest dreamer of  the last century. Its range of expression is almost infinite. It can  strike like a thunder-bolt, or murmur like a zephyr. Its voices are  multitudinous. Its register is coextensive in theory with that of the  modern pianoforte, reaching from the space immediately below the sixth  added line under the bass staff to the ninth added line above the  treble staff. These two extremes, which belong respectively to the  bass tuba and piccolo flute, are not at the command of every player,  but they are within the capacity of the instruments, and mark the  orchestra's boundaries in respect of pitch. The gravest note is almost  as deep as any in which the ordinary human ear can detect pitch, and  the acutest reaches the same extremity in the opposite direction.    [Sidenote: _The viols._]    [Sidenote: _The violin._]    With all the changes that have come over the orchestra in the course  of the last two hundred years, the string quartet has remained its  chief factor. Its voice cannot grow monotonous or cloying, for,  besides its innate qualities, it commands a more varied manner of  expression than all the other instruments combined. The viol, which  term I shall use generically to indicate all the instruments of the  quartet, is the only instrument in the band, except the harp, that can  play harmony as well as melody. Its range is the most extensive; it is  more responsive to changes in manipulation; it is endowed more richly  than any other instrument with varieties of timbre; it has an  incomparable facility of execution, and answers more quickly and more  eloquently than any of its companions to the feelings of the player. A  great advantage which the viol possesses over wind instruments is  that, not being dependent on the breath of the player, there is  practically no limit to its ability to sustain tones. It is because  of this long list of good qualities that it is relied on to provide  the staff of life to instrumental music. The strings as commonly used  show four members of the viol family, distinguished among themselves  by their size, and the quality in the changes of tone which grows out  of the differences in size. The violins (Appendix, Plate I.) are the  smallest members of the family. Historically they are the culmination  of a development toward diminutiveness, for in their early days viols  were larger than they are now. When the violin of to-day entered the  orchestra (in the score of Monteverde's opera \"Orfeo\") it was"]]]
