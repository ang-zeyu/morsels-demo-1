So  this thing has come to pass. Witness this people which had attained the  summit of power, how degraded and downtrodden it is now.    The other nations \"shall send gifts to one another,\" meaning that they  should help each other, for \"these two prophets tormented them that dwelt  upon the earth\"--that is, they overcame the other nations and peoples of  the world and conquered them.    \"And after three days and a half the spirit of life from God entered into  them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them that  saw them.\"(52) Three days and a half, as we before explained, is twelve  hundred and sixty years. Those two persons whose bodies were lying  spiritless are the teachings and the law that Muhammad established and  'Ali promoted, from which, however, the reality had departed and only the  form remained. The spirit came again into them means that those  foundations and teachings were again established. In other words, the  spirituality of the Religion of God had been changed into materiality, and  virtues into vices; the love of God had been changed into hatred,  enlightenment into darkness, divine qualities into satanic ones, justice  into tyranny, mercy into enmity, sincerity into hypocrisy, guidance into  error, and purity into sensuality. Then after three days and a half, which  by the terminology of the Holy Books is twelve hundred and sixty years,  these divine teachings, heavenly virtues, perfections and spiritual  bounties were again renewed by the appearance of the Bab and the devotion  of Jinab-i-Quddus.(53)    The holy breezes were diffused, the light of truth shone forth, the season  of the life-giving spring came, and the morn of guidance dawned. These two  lifeless bodies again became living, and these two great ones--one the  Founder and the other the promoter--arose and were like two candlesticks,  for they illumined the world with the light of truth.    \"And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up  hither. And they ascended up to heaven,\"(54) meaning that from the  invisible heaven they heard the voice of God, saying: You have performed  all that was proper and fitting in delivering the teachings and glad  tidings; you have given My message to the people and raised the call of  God, and have accomplished your duty. Now, like Christ, you must sacrifice  your life for the Well-Beloved, and be martyrs. And that Sun of Reality,  and that Moon of Guidance,(55) both, like Christ, set on the horizon of  the greatest martyrdom and ascended to the Kingdom of God.    \"And their enemies beheld them,\"(56) meaning that many of their enemies,  after witnessing their martyrdom, realized the sublimity of their station  and the exaltation of their virtue, and testified to their greatness and  perfection.    \"And the same hour there was a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the  city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand.\"(57)    This earthquake occurred in _Sh_iraz after the martyrdom of the Bab. The  city was in a turmoil, and many people were destroyed. Great agitation  also took place through diseases, cholera, dearth, scarcity, famine and  afflictions, the like of which had never been known.    \"And the remnant was affrighted and gave glory to the God of heaven.\"(58)    When the earthquake took place in Fars, all the remnant lamented and cried  day and night, and were occupied in glorifying and praying to God. They  were so troubled and affrighted that they had no sleep nor rest at night.    \"The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe cometh quickly.\"(59)  The first woe is the appearance of the Prophet, Muhammad, the son of  'Abdu'llah--peace be upon Him! The second woe is that of the Bab--to Him be  glory and praise! The third woe is the great day of the manifestation of  the Lord of Hosts and the radiance of the Beauty of the Promised One. The  explanation of this subject, woe, is mentioned in the thirtieth chapter of  Ezekiel, where it is said: \"The word of the Lord came again unto me,  saying, Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord God; Howl ye,  Woe worth the day! For the day is near, even the day of the Lord is  near.\"(60)    Therefore, it is certain that the day of woe is the day of the Lord; for  in that day woe is for the neglectful, woe is for the sinners, woe is for  the ignorant. That is why it is said, \"The second woe is past; behold the  third woe cometh quickly!\" This third woe is the day of the manifestation  of Baha'u'llah, the day of God; and it is near to the day of the  appearance of the Bab.    \"And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven,  saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord,  and of His Christ; and He shall reign for ever and ever.\"(61)    The seventh angel is a man qualified with heavenly attributes, who will  arise with heavenly qualities and character. Voices will be raised, so  that the appearance of the Divine Manifestation will be proclaimed and  diffused. In the day of the manifestation of the Lord of Hosts, and at the  epoch of the divine cycle of the Omnipotent which is promised and  mentioned in all the books and writings of the Prophets--in that day of  God, the Spiritual and Divine Kingdom will be established, and the world  will be renewed; a new spirit will be breathed into the body of creation;  the season of the divine spring will come; the clouds of mercy will rain;  the sun of reality will shine; the life-giving breeze will blow; the world  of humanity will wear a new garment; the surface of the earth will be a  sublime paradise; mankind will be educated; wars, disputes, quarrels and  malignity will disappear; and truthfulness, righteousness, peace and the  worship of God will appear; union, love and brotherhood will surround the  world; and God will rule for evermore--meaning that the Spiritual and  Everlasting Kingdom will be established. Such is the day of God. For all  the days which have come and gone were the days of Abraham, Moses and  Christ, or of the other Prophets; but this day is the day of God, for the  Sun of Reality will arise in it with the utmost warmth and splendor.    \"And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their seats, fell  upon their faces, and worshipped God.    \"Saying, We give Thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, Which art, and wast,  and art to come; because Thou hast taken to Thee Thy great power, and hast  reigned.\"(62) In each cycle the guardians and holy souls have been twelve.  So Jacob had twelve sons; in the time of Moses there were twelve heads or  chiefs of the tribes; in the time of Christ there were twelve Apostles;  and in the time of Muhammad there were twelve Imams. But in this glorious  manifestation there are twenty-four, double the number of all the others,  for the greatness of this manifestation requires it. These holy souls are  in the presence of God seated on their own thrones, meaning that they  reign eternally.    These twenty-four great persons, though they are seated on the thrones of  everlasting rule, yet are worshipers of the appearance of the universal  Manifestation, and they are humble and submissive, saying, \"We give thanks  to Thee, O Lord God Almighty, Which art, and wast, and art to come,  because Thou hast taken to Thee Thy great power and hast reigned\"--that is  to say, Thou wilt issue all Thy teachings, Thou wilt gather all the people  of the earth under Thy shadow, and Thou wilt bring all men under the  shadow of one tent. Although it is the Eternal Kingdom of God, and He  always had, and has, a Kingdom, the Kingdom here means the manifestation  of Himself;(63) and He will issue all the laws and teachings which are the  spirit of the world of humanity and everlasting life. And that universal  Manifestation will subdue the world by spiritual power, not by war and  combat; He will do it with peace and tranquillity, not by the sword and  arms; He will establish this Heavenly Kingdom by true love, and not by the  power of war. He will promote these divine teachings by kindness and  righteousness, and not by weapons and harshness. He will so educate the  nations and people that, notwithstanding their various conditions, their  different customs and characters, and their diverse religions and races,  they will, as it is said in the Bible, like the wolf and the lamb, the  leopard, the kid, the sucking child and the serpent, become comrades,  friends and companions. The contentions of races, the differences of  religions, and the barriers between nations will be completely removed,  and all will attain perfect union and reconciliation under the shadow of  the Blessed Tree.    \"And the nations were angry,\" for Thy teachings opposed the passions of  the other peoples; \"and Thy wrath is come\"(64)--that is to say, all will be  afflicted by evident loss; because they do not follow Thy precepts,  counsels and teachings, they will be deprived of Thy everlasting bounty,  and veiled from the light of the Sun of Reality.    \"And the time of the dead, that they should be judged\" means that the time  has come that the dead(65)--that is to say, those who are deprived of the  spirit of the love of God and have not a share of the sanctified eternal  life--will be judged with justice, meaning they will arise to receive that  which they deserve. He will make the reality of their secrets evident,  showing what a low degree they occupy in the world of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1929"],[0,"The School for Scandal (#10)"],[1,"the Jew in.    FIRST GENTLEMAN. Aye and the Broker too by all means----    SECOND GENTLEMAN. Yes yes the Jew and the Broker.    CHARLES. Egad with all my Heart--Trip--bid the Gentlemen walk in--tho'  there's one of them a Stranger I can tell you----    TRIP. What Sir--would you chuse Mr. Premium to come up with----    FIRST GENTLEMAN. Yes--yes Mr. Premium certainly.    CARELESS. To be sure--Mr. Premium--by all means Charles, let us give  them some generous Burgundy, and perhaps they'll grow conscientious----    CHARLES. O, Hang 'em--no--wine does but draw forth a man's natural  qualities; and to make them drink would only be to whet their Knavery.         Enter TRIP, SIR OLIVER, and MOSES    CHARLES. So--honest Moses--walk in--walk in pray Mr. Premium--that's the  Gentleman's name isn't it Moses.    MOSES. Yes Sir.    CHARLES. Set chairs--Trim.--Sit down, Mr Premium.--Glasses Trim.--sit  down Moses.--Come, Mr. Premium I'll give you a sentiment--Here's Success  to Usury--Moses fill the Gentleman a bumper.    MOSES. Success to Usury!    CARELESS. Right Moses--Usury is Prudence and industry and deserves to  succeed----    SIR OLIVER. Then Here is--all the success it deserves!     [Drinks.]    CHARLES. Mr. Premium you and I are but strangers yet--but I hope we  shall be better acquainted by and bye----    SIR OLIVER. Yes Sir hope we shall--more intimately perhaps than you'll  wish. [Aside.<5>]    CARELESS. No, no, that won't do! Mr. Premium, you have demurred at the  toast, and must drink it in a pint bumper.    FIRST GENTLEMAN. A pint bumper, at least.    MOSES. Oh, pray, sir, consider--Mr. Premium's a gentleman.    CARELESS. And therefore loves good wine.    SECOND GENTLEMAN. Give Moses a quart glass--this is mutiny, and a high  contempt for the chair.    CARELESS. Here, now for't! I'll see justice done, to the last drop of my  bottle.    SIR OLIVER. Nay, pray, gentlemen--I did not expect this usage.    CHARLES. No, hang it, you shan't; Mr. Premium's a stranger.    SIR OLIVER. Odd! I wish I was well out of their company. [Aside.]    CARELESS. Plague on 'em then! if they won't drink, we'll not sit down  with them. Come, Harry, the dice are in the next room.--Charles, you'll  join us when you have finished your business with the gentlemen?    CHARLES. I will! I will!--         [Exeunt SIR HARRY BUMPER and GENTLEMEN; CARELESS following.]  Careless.    CARELESS. [Returning.] Well!    CHARLES. Perhaps I may want you.    CARELESS. Oh, you know I am always ready: word, note, or bond, 'tis all  the same to me.         [Exit.]    MOSES. Sir, this is Mr. Premium, a gentleman of the strictest honour  and secrecy; and always performs what he undertakes. Mr. Premium, this  is----    CHARLES. Psha! have done. Sir, my friend Moses is a very honest fellow,  but a little slow at expression: he'll be an hour giving us our titles.  Mr. Premium, the plain state of the matter is this: I am an extravagant  young fellow who wants to borrow money; you I take to be a prudent old  fellow, who have got money to lend. I am blockhead enough to give fifty  per cent. sooner than not have it! and you, I presume, are rogue enough  to take a hundred if you can get it. Now, sir, you see we are acquainted  at once, and may proceed to business without further ceremony.    SIR OLIVER. Exceeding frank, upon my word. I see, sir, you are not a man  of many compliments.    CHARLES. Oh, no, sir! plain dealing in business I always think best.    SIR OLIVER. Sir, I like you the better for it. However, You are mistaken  in one thing; I have no money to lend, but I believe I could procure  some of a friend; but then he's an unconscionable dog. Isn't he, Moses?  And must sell stock to accommodate you. Mustn't he, Moses!    MOSES. Yes, indeed! You know I always speak the truth, and scorn to tell  a lie!    CHARLES. Right. People that speak truth generally do. But these are  trifles, Mr. Premium. What! I know money isn't to be bought without  paying for't!    SIR OLIVER. Well, but what security could you give? You have no land, I  suppose?    CHARLES. Not a mole-hill, nor a twig, but what's in the bough pots out  of the window!    SIR OLIVER. Nor any stock, I presume?    CHARLES. Nothing but live stock--and that's only a few pointers and  ponies. But pray, Mr. Premium, are you acquainted at all with any of my  connections?    SIR OLIVER. Why, to say the truth, I am.    CHARLES. Then you must know that I have a devilish rich uncle in  the East Indies, Sir Oliver Surface, from whom I have the greatest  expectations?    SIR OLIVER. That you have a wealthy uncle, I have heard; but how your  expectations will turn out is more, I believe, than you can tell.    CHARLES. Oh, no!--there can be no doubt. They tell me I'm a prodigious  favourite, and that he talks of leaving me everything.    SIR OLIVER. Indeed! this is the first I've heard of it.    CHARLES. Yes, yes, 'tis just so. Moses knows 'tis true; don't you,  Moses?    MOSES. Oh, yes! I'll swear to't.    SIR OLIVER. Egad, they'll persuade me presently I'm at Bengal. [Aside.]    CHARLES. Now I propose, Mr. Premium, if it's agreeable to you, a  post-obit on Sir Oliver's life: though at the same time the old fellow  has been so liberal to me, that I give you my word, I should be very  sorry to hear that anything had happened to him.    SIR OLIVER. Not more than I should, I assure you. But the bond you  mention happens to be just the worst security you could offer me--for I  might live to a hundred and never see the principal.    CHARLES. Oh, yes, you would! the moment Sir Oliver dies, you know, you  would come on me for the money.    SIR OLIVER. Then I believe I should be the most unwelcome dun you ever  had in your life.    CHARLES. What! I suppose you're afraid that Sir Oliver is too good a  life?    SIR OLIVER. No, indeed I am not; though I have heard he is as hale and  healthy as any man of his years in Christendom.    CHARLES. There again, now, you are misinformed. No, no, the climate has  hurt him considerably, poor uncle Oliver. Yes, yes, he breaks apace, I'm  told--and is so much altered lately that his nearest relations would not  know him.    SIR OLIVER. No! Ha! ha! ha! so much altered lately that his nearest  relations would not know him! Ha! ha! ha! egad--ha! ha! ha!    CHARLES. Ha! ha!--you're glad to hear that, little Premium?    SIR OLIVER. No, no, I'm not.    CHARLES. Yes, yes, you are--ha! ha! ha!--you know that mends your  chance.    SIR OLIVER. But I'm told Sir Oliver is coming over; nay, some say he is  actually arrived.    CHARLES. Psha! sure I must know better than you whether he's come or  not. No, no, rely on't he's at this moment at Calcutta. Isn't he, Moses?    MOSES. Oh, yes, certainly.    SIR OLIVER. Very true, as you say, you must know better than I, though I  have it from pretty good authority. Haven't I, Moses?    MOSES. Yes, most undoubted!    SIR OLIVER. But, Sir, as I understand you want a few hundreds  immediately, is there nothing you could dispose of?    CHARLES. How do you mean?    SIR OLIVER. For instance, now, I have heard that your father left behind  him a great quantity of massy old plate.    CHARLES. O Lud! that's gone long ago. Moses can tell you how better than  I can.    SIR OLIVER. [Aside.] Good lack! all the family race-cups and  corporation-bowls!--[Aloud.] Then it was also supposed that his library  was one of the most valuable and compact.    CHARLES. Yes, yes, so it was--vastly too much so for a private  gentleman. For my part, I was always of a communicative disposition, so  I thought it a shame to keep so much knowledge to myself.    SIR OLIVER. [Aside.] Mercy upon me! learning that had run in the family  like an heir-loom!--[Aloud.] Pray, what has become of the books?    CHARLES. You must inquire of the auctioneer, Master Premium, for I don't  believe even Moses can direct you.    MOSES. I know nothing of books.    SIR OLIVER. So, so, nothing of the family property left, I suppose?    CHARLES. Not much, indeed; unless you have a mind to the family  pictures. I have got a room full of ancestors above: and if you have a  taste for old paintings, egad, you shall have 'em a bargain!    SIR OLIVER. Hey! what the devil! sure, you wouldn't sell your  forefathers, would you?    CHARLES. Every man of them, to the best bidder.    SIR OLIVER. What! your great-uncles and aunts?    CHARLES. Ay, and my great-grandfathers and grandmothers too.    SIR OLIVER. [Aside.] Now I give him up!--[Aloud.] What the plague,  have you no bowels for your own kindred? Odd's life! do you take me for  Shylock in the play, that you would raise money of me on your own flesh  and blood?    CHARLES. Nay, my little broker, don't be angry: what need you care, if  you have your money's worth?    SIR OLIVER. Well, I'll be the purchaser: I think I can dispose of the  family canvas.--[Aside.] Oh, I'll never forgive him this! never!         Re-enter CARELESS    CARELESS. Come, Charles, what keeps you?    CHARLES. I can't come yet. I'faith, we are going to have a sale above  stairs; here's little Premium will buy all my ancestors!    CARELESS. Oh, burn your ancestors!    CHARLES. No, he may do that afterwards, if he pleases. Stay, Careless,  we want you: egad, you shall be auctioneer--so come along with us.    CARELESS. Oh, have with you, if that's the case. I can handle a hammer  as well as a dice box! Going! going!    SIR OLIVER. Oh, the profligates! [Aside.]    CHARLES. Come, Moses, you shall be appraiser, if we want one. Gad's  life, little Premium, you don't seem to like the business?    SIR OLIVER. Oh, yes, I do, vastly! Ha! ha! ha! yes, yes, I think it a  rare joke to sell one's family by auction--ha! ha!--[Aside.] Oh, the  prodigal!    CHARLES. To be sure! when a man wants money, where the plague should he  get assistance, if he can't make free with his own relations?         [Exeunt.]    SIR OLIVER. I'll never forgive him; never! never!         END OF THE THIRD ACT          ACT IV"]]]
