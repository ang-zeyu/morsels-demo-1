Thus they were carried up into the blue sky, until  they scraped their faces against the moon; and still they slept  on.    [Illustration: _Photograph by Fiske_.  NORTH DOME (TO-KO'-YA). 3,725 Feet.  This rock is believed by the Indians to represent Tis-sa'-ack's  husband, turned into stone for beating his wife. The lower dome  to the right is the basket which she threw at him. See \"Legend of  Tis-sa'-ack.\"]    Then all the animals assembled to bring down the little boys from  the top of the great rock. Each animal sprang up the face of the  rock as far as he could. The mouse could only spring a hand's  breadth, the rat two hands' breadths, the raccoon a little more,  and so on. The grizzly bear made a great leap up the wall, but  fell back like all the others, without reaching the top. Finally  came the lion, who jumped up farther than any of the others, but  even he fell back and could not reach the top.    Then came the _tul-tok'-a-na,_ the insignificant measuring  worm, who was despised by all the other creatures, and began to  creep up the face of the rock. Step by step, little by little, he  measured his way up until he was soon above the lion's jump, and  still farther and farther, until presently he was out of sight;  and still he crawled up and up, day and night, through many  moons, and at length he reached the top, and took the little boys  and brought them safely down to the ground. And therefore the  rock was named for the measuring worm, and was called  Tu-tok-a-nu'-la.      LEGEND OF GROUSE LAKE.    I will here relate a personal experience which occurred in  September, 1857, while out with a large party of Indians on a  deer hunt in the mountains.    One day, after a long tramp, I stopped to rest by the side of a  small lake about eight miles from the present site of Wawona, and  I then named it Grouse Lake on account of the great number of  grouse found there. Very soon a party of Indians came along  carrying some deer, and stopped on the opposite side of the lake  to rest and get some water. Soon after they had started again for  their camp I heard a distinct wailing cry, somewhat like the cry  of a puppy when lost, and I thought the Indians must have left  one of their young dogs behind.    When I joined the Indians in camp that night I inquired of them  about the sound I had heard. They replied that it was not a  dog--that a long time ago an Indian boy had been drowned in the  lake, and that every time any one passed there he always cried  after them, and that no one dared to go in the lake, for he  would catch them by the legs and pull them down and they would,  be drowned. I then concluded that it must have been some unseen  water-fowl that made the cry, and at that time I thought that the  Indians were trying to impose on my credulity, but I am now  convinced that they fully believed the story they told me.    Po-ho'-no Lake, the headwaters of the Bridal Veil Creek, was  also thought to be haunted by troubled spirits, which affected  the stream clear down into the Yosemite Valley; and the Indians  believed that an evil wind there had been the cause of some fatal  accidents many years ago. The word Po-ho'-no means a puffing  wind, and has also been translated \"Evil Wind,\" on account of the  superstition above referred to.      LEGEND OF THE LOST ARROW.    Tee-hee'-nay was a beautiful Ah-wah'-nee maiden, said to be  the most beautiful of her tribe, and she was beloved by  Kos-su'-kah, a strong and valiant young brave. Valuable  presents had been made to the bride's parents, and they had given  their consent to an early marriage, which was to be celebrated by  a great feast.    To provide an abundance of venison and other meat for this  banquet, Kos-su'-kah gathered together his young companions and  went into the mountains in search of game. In order that  Tee-hee'-nay might know of his welfare and the success of the  hunt, it was agreed between the lovers that at sunset Kos-su'-kah  should go to the high rock to the east of Cho'-lak [Yosemite  Falls], and should shoot an arrow into the Valley, to which  should be attached a number of grouse feathers corresponding to  the number of deer that had fallen before the skill of the  hunters.    [Illustration: _Photograph by Fiske_.  BRIDAL VEIL FALL (PO-HO'-NO).  940 Feet.  The-source of this stream is supposed by the Indians to be  haunted by troubled spirits, which affect the water along its  whole course. The word Po-ho'-no means a \"puffing wind.\"]    At the time appointed Tee-hee'-nay went near the foot of the  great cliff and waited, with her eyes raised to the towering  rocks above, hoping with her keen sight to see the form of her  lover outlined against the sky, but no form could she see, and no  arrow fell into the Valley. As darkness gathered, gloomy  forebodings took possession of her, and she climbed part way up  the canyon called Le-ham'-i-tee [now known as Indian Canyon]  because the arrow-wood grew there, and finally she stood at the  very foot of the rocky wall which rose to dizzy heights above  her, and there she waited through the long night.    With the first streak of dawn she bounded swiftly up the rough  canyon, for she was fully convinced that some terrible fate had  overtaken the brave Kos-su'-kah, and soon she stood upon the  lofty summit [Yosemite Point], where she found her lover's  footsteps leading towards the edge of the precipice. Drawing  nearer she was startled to find that a portion of the cliff had  given way, and, upon peering over the brink, what was her horror  to discover the blood-stained and lifeless body of Kos-su'-kah  lying on a rocky ledge far beneath.    Summoning assistance by means of a signal fire, which was seen  from the Valley below, a rope was made of sapling tamaracks  lashed firmly together with thongs from one of the deer that was  to have furnished the marriage feast, and Tee-hee'-nay herself  insisted on being lowered over the precipice to recover the body  of her lover. This was at last successfully accomplished, and  when his ghastly form lay once more upon the rocky summit, she  threw herself on his bosom and gave way to passionate outburst of  grief.    Finally she became quiet, but when they stooped to raise her they  found that her spirit had fled to join the lost Kos-su'-kah and  that the lovers were re-united in death!    The fateful arrow that was the cause of so much sorrow could  never be found, and the Indians believe that it was taken away by  the spirits of Kos-su'-kah and Tee-hee'-nay. In memory of  them, and of this tragedy, the slender spire of rock [sometimes  called \"The Devil's Thumb\"] that rises heavenward near the top of  the cliff at this point is known among the Indians as Hum-mo',  or the Lost Arrow.          Appendix    HINTS TO YOSEMITE VISITORS.      Secure stage seats in advance.    Take only hand baggage, unless for a protracted visit. For a  short trip, an outing suit and two or three waists, with a change  for evening wear, will be found sufficient. The free baggage  allowance on the stage lines is fifty pounds.    Men will find flannel or negligee shirts the most comfortable.    In April, May and June wear warm clothing and take heavy wraps.  In July, August and September wear medium clothing, with light  wraps. In October and November wear warm clothing, with heavy  wraps. The nights are cool at all seasons.    Dusters are always advisable, and ladies should provide some  light head covering to protect the hair from dust. Sun bonnets  are frequently worn.    Short skirts are most convenient.    Divided skirts are proper for trail trips, as ladies are required  to ride astride. Heavy denim for skirt and bloomers is very  satisfactory. Such skirts can be hired in the Valley.    Waists of soft material and neutral shades are appropriate. Avoid  white.    Something absolutely soft for neckwear will be found a great  comfort, both by men and women.    Leggings, stout, comfortable shoes, and heavy, loose gloves, will  be found very serviceable.    A soft felt hat is preferable to straw. One that will shade the  eyes is best. A cloth traveling cap is the worst thing to wear.    Smoked glasses will sometimes save the wearer a headache.    Except in April, May and November, an umbrella is apt to be a  useless encumbrance.    If the skin is sensitive, and one wishes to avoid painful  sunburn, the use of a pure cream and soft cloth is preferable to  water, and far more efficacious.    A week is the shortest time that should be allowed for a trip to  Yosemite. Two weeks are better. The grandeur of the Valley cannot  be fully appreciated in a few days. Those not accustomed to  staging or mountain climbing should make some allowance in their  itineraries for rest. Many visitors spoil their pleasure by  getting too tired.    Take a little more money than you think will be needed. You may  want to prolong your stay.    Hunting, or the possession of firearms, is not permitted in the  Yosemite National Park. Fishing is allowed, and in June and July  an expert angler is likely to be well rewarded. Rods and tackle  may be hired in the Valley.    There is no hardship, risk or danger in any part of the Yosemite  trip. Many old people and children visit the Valley without  difficulty.    A knowledge of horsemanship is not needed for going on the  trails. The most timid people make the trips with enjoyment. Some  of the finest views can only be obtained in this way.    There is a laundry in the Valley.    There is a barber shop.    There is a post office, telegraph and express. There is a  general store and places for the sale of photographs, curios and  Indian work.    Treat the Indians with courtesy and consideration, if you expect  similar treatment from them. Do not expect them to pose for you  for nothing.

PHAEDO: I had a singular feeling at being in his company. For I  could hardly believe that I was present at the death of a friend, and  therefore I did not pity him, Echecrates; he died so fearlessly, and  his words and bearing were so noble and gracious, that to me he appeared  blessed. I thought that in going to the other world he could not be  without a divine call, and that he would be happy, if any man ever was,  when he arrived there, and therefore I did not pity him as might have  seemed natural at such an hour. But I had not the pleasure which I  usually feel in philosophical discourse (for philosophy was the theme  of which we spoke). I was pleased, but in the pleasure there was also a  strange admixture of pain; for I reflected that he was soon to die, and  this double feeling was shared by us all; we were laughing and weeping  by turns, especially the excitable Apollodorus--you know the sort of  man?    ECHECRATES: Yes.    PHAEDO: He was quite beside himself; and I and all of us were greatly  moved.    ECHECRATES: Who were present?    PHAEDO: Of native Athenians there were, besides Apollodorus, Critobulus  and his father Crito, Hermogenes, Epigenes, Aeschines, Antisthenes;  likewise Ctesippus of the deme of Paeania, Menexenus, and some others;  Plato, if I am not mistaken, was ill.    ECHECRATES: Were there any strangers?    PHAEDO: Yes, there were; Simmias the Theban, and Cebes, and Phaedondes;  Euclid and Terpison, who came from Megara.    ECHECRATES: And was Aristippus there, and Cleombrotus?    PHAEDO: No, they were said to be in Aegina.    ECHECRATES: Any one else?    PHAEDO: I think that these were nearly all.    ECHECRATES: Well, and what did you talk about?    PHAEDO: I will begin at the beginning, and endeavour to repeat the  entire conversation. On the previous days we had been in the habit of  assembling early in the morning at the court in which the trial took  place, and which is not far from the prison. There we used to wait  talking with one another until the opening of the doors (for they were  not opened very early); then we went in and generally passed the day  with Socrates. On the last morning we assembled sooner than usual,  having heard on the day before when we quitted the prison in the evening  that the sacred ship had come from Delos, and so we arranged to meet  very early at the accustomed place. On our arrival the jailer who  answered the door, instead of admitting us, came out and told us to stay  until he called us. 'For the Eleven,' he said, 'are now with Socrates;  they are taking off his chains, and giving orders that he is to die  to-day.' He soon returned and said that we might come in. On entering we  found Socrates just released from chains, and Xanthippe, whom you know,  sitting by him, and holding his child in her arms. When she saw us she  uttered a cry and said, as women will: 'O Socrates, this is the last  time that either you will converse with your friends, or they with you.'  Socrates turned to Crito and said: 'Crito, let some one take her home.'  Some of Crito's people accordingly led her away, crying out and beating  herself. And when she was gone, Socrates, sitting up on the couch, bent  and rubbed his leg, saying, as he was rubbing: How singular is the  thing called pleasure, and how curiously related to pain, which might be  thought to be the opposite of it; for they are never present to a man at  the same instant, and yet he who pursues either is generally compelled  to take the other; their bodies are two, but they are joined by a single  head. And I cannot help thinking that if Aesop had remembered them, he  would have made a fable about God trying to reconcile their strife, and  how, when he could not, he fastened their heads together; and this is  the reason why when one comes the other follows, as I know by my own  experience now, when after the pain in my leg which was caused by the  chain pleasure appears to succeed.    Upon this Cebes said: I am glad, Socrates, that you have mentioned the  name of Aesop. For it reminds me of a question which has been asked by  many, and was asked of me only the day before yesterday by Evenus the  poet--he will be sure to ask it again, and therefore if you would like  me to have an answer ready for him, you may as well tell me what I  should say to him:--he wanted to know why you, who never before wrote  a line of poetry, now that you are in prison are turning Aesop's fables  into verse, and also composing that hymn in honour of Apollo.    Tell him, Cebes, he replied, what is the truth--that I had no idea of  rivalling him or his poems; to do so, as I knew, would be no easy task.  But I wanted to see whether I could purge away a scruple which I felt  about the meaning of certain dreams. In the course of my life I have  often had intimations in dreams 'that I should compose music.' The same  dream came to me sometimes in one form, and sometimes in another, but  always saying the same or nearly the same words: 'Cultivate and make  music,' said the dream. And hitherto I had imagined that this was only  intended to exhort and encourage me in the study of philosophy, which  has been the pursuit of my life, and is the noblest and best of music.  The dream was bidding me do what I was already doing, in the same way  that the competitor in a race is bidden by the spectators to run when he  is already running. But I was not certain of this, for the dream might  have meant music in the popular sense of the word, and being under  sentence of death, and the festival giving me a respite, I thought that  it would be safer for me to satisfy the scruple, and, in obedience to  the dream, to compose a few verses before I departed. And first I made  a hymn in honour of the god of the festival, and then considering that a  poet, if he is really to be a poet, should not only put together words,  but should invent stories, and that I have no invention, I took some  fables of Aesop, which I had ready at hand and which I knew--they were  the first I came upon--and turned them into verse. Tell this to Evenus,  Cebes, and bid him be of good cheer; say that I would have him come  after me if he be a wise man, and not tarry; and that to-day I am likely  to be going, for the Athenians say that I must.    Simmias said: What a message for such a man! having been a frequent  companion of his I should say that, as far as I know him, he will never  take your advice unless he is obliged.    Why, said Socrates,--is not Evenus a philosopher?    I think that he is, said Simmias.    Then he, or any man who has the spirit of philosophy, will be willing to  die, but he will not take his own life, for that is held to be unlawful.    Here he changed his position, and put his legs off the couch on to the  ground, and during the rest of the conversation he remained sitting.    Why do you say, enquired Cebes, that a man ought not to take his own  life, but that the philosopher will be ready to follow the dying?    Socrates replied: And have you, Cebes and Simmias, who are the disciples  of Philolaus, never heard him speak of this?    Yes, but his language was obscure, Socrates.    My words, too, are only an echo; but there is no reason why I should not  repeat what I have heard: and indeed, as I am going to another place,  it is very meet for me to be thinking and talking of the nature of  the pilgrimage which I am about to make. What can I do better in the  interval between this and the setting of the sun?    Then tell me, Socrates, why is suicide held to be unlawful? as I have  certainly heard Philolaus, about whom you were just now asking, affirm  when he was staying with us at Thebes: and there are others who say the  same, although I have never understood what was meant by any of them.    Do not lose heart, replied Socrates, and the day may come when you will  understand. I suppose that you wonder why, when other things which are  evil may be good at certain times and to certain persons, death is to  be the only exception, and why, when a man is better dead, he is not  permitted to be his own benefactor, but must wait for the hand of  another.    Very true, said Cebes, laughing gently and speaking in his native  Boeotian.    I admit the appearance of inconsistency in what I am saying; but  there may not be any real inconsistency after all. There is a doctrine  whispered in secret that man is a prisoner who has no right to open  the door and run away; this is a great mystery which I do not quite  understand. Yet I too believe that the gods are our guardians, and that  we are a possession of theirs. Do you not agree?    Yes, I quite agree, said Cebes.    And if one of your own possessions, an ox or an ass, for example, took  the liberty of putting himself out of the way when you had given no  intimation of your wish that he should die, would you not be angry with  him, and would you not punish him if you could?    Certainly, replied Cebes.    Then, if we look at the matter thus, there may be reason in saying that  a man should wait, and not take his own life until God summons him, as  he is now summoning me.    Yes, Socrates, said Cebes, there seems to be truth in what you say. And  yet how can you reconcile this seemingly true belief that God is our  guardian and we his possessions, with the willingness to die which we  were just now attributing to the philosopher? That the wisest of men  should be willing to leave a service in which they are ruled by the gods  who are the best of rulers, is not reasonable; for surely no wise man  thinks that when set at liberty he can take better care of himself than  the gods take of him. A fool may perhaps think so--he may argue that he  had better run away from his master, not considering that his duty is  to remain to the end, and not to run away from the good, and that there  would be no sense in his running away. The wise man will want to be ever "]]]
