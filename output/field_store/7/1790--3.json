It usually consists in writing  off the melody of a song--in other words, playing the 'tune' on an  instrument instead of hearing it sung with words--or in the case of a  piano composition, in writing off the upper voice, leaving the rest  intact, regardless of sonority, tone-color or even effectiveness, and,  furthermore, without consideration of the idiomatic principles of the  instrument to which the adaptation was meant to fit.    \"A 'transcription,' on the other hand, can be raised to the dignity of  an art-work. Indeed, at times it may even surpass the original, in the  quality of thought brought into the work, the delicate and sympathetic  treatment and by the many subtleties* which an artist can introduce to  make it thoroughly a _re-creation_ of his chosen instrument.        *Transcriber's note: Original text read \"subleties\".    \"It is the transcriber's privilege--providing he be sufficiently the  artist to approach the personality of another artist with reverence--to  donate his own gifts of ingenuity, and to exercise his judgment in  either adding, omitting, harmonically or otherwise embellishing the work  (_while preserving the original idea and characteristics_), so as to  thoroughly _re-create_ it, so completely destroying the very sensing of  the original _timbre_ that one involuntarily exclaims, 'Truly, this  never was anything but a violin piece!' It is this, the blending and  fusion of two personalities in the achievement of an art-ideal, that is  the result of a true adaptation.    \"Among the transcriptions I have most enjoyed making were those of  Debussy's _Il pleure dans mon coeur_, and _La Fille aux cheveaux de  lin_. Debussy was my cherished friend, and they represent a labor of  love. Though Debussy was not, generally speaking, an advocate of  transcriptions, he liked these, and I remember when I first played _La  Fille aux cheveaux de lin_ for him, and came to a bit of counterpoint I  had introduced in the violin melody, whistling the harmonics, he nodded  approvingly with a '_pas bete ca!_' (Not stupid, that!)                            DEBUSSY'S POEME FOR VIOLIN    \"Debussy came near writing a violin piece for me once!\" continued Mr.  Hartmann, and brought out a folio containing letters the great  impressionist had written him. They were a delightful revelation of the  human side of Debussy's character, and Mr. Hartmann kindly consented to  the quotation of one bearing on the _Poeme_ for violin which Debussy had  promised to write for him, and which, alas, owing to his illness and  other reasons, never actually came to be written:         \"Dear Friend:         \"Of course I am working a great deal now, because I feel       the need of writing music, and would find it difficult       to build an aeroplane; yet at times Music is ill-natured,       even toward those who love her most! Then I take my       little daughter and my hat and go walking in the Bois de       Boulogne, where one meets people who have come from afar       to bore themselves in Paris.         \"I think of you, I might even say I am in need of you       (assume an air of exaltation and bow, if you please!) As       to the _Poeme_ for violin, you may rest assured that I       will write it. Only at the present moment I am so       preoccupied with the 'Fall of the House of Usher!' They       talk too much to me about it. I'll have to put an end to       all that or I will go mad. Once more I want to write it,       and above all _on your account_. And I believe you will       be the only one to play the _Poeme_. Others will attempt       it, and then quickly return to the Mendelssohn Concerto!         \"Believe me always your sincere friend,                                             \"CLAUDE DEBUSSY.\"    \"He never did write it,\" said Mr. Hartmann, \"but it was not for want of  good will. As to other transcriptions, I have never done any that I did  not feel instinctively would make good fiddle pieces, such as  MacDowell's _To a Wild Rose_ and others of his compositions. And  recently I have transcribed some fine Russian things--Gretchaninoff's  _Chant d'Automne_, Karagitscheff's _Exaltation_, Tschaikovsky's  _Humoresque_, Balakirew's _Chant du Pecheur_, and Poldini's little  _Poupee valsante_, which Maud Powell plays so delightfully on all her  programs.\"                                             VII                                    JASCHA HEIFETZ                        THE DANGER OF PRACTICING TOO MUCH.                            TECHNICAL MASTERY AND                                 TEMPERAMENT      Mature in virtuosity--the modern virtuosity which goes so far beyond the  mere technical mastery that once made the term a reproach--though young  in years, Jascha Heifetz, when one makes his acquaintance \"off-stage,\"  seems singularly modest about the great gifts which have brought him  international fame. He is amiable, unassuming and--the best proof,  perhaps, that his talent is a thing genuine and inborn, not the result  of a forcing process--he has that broad interest in art and in life  going far beyond his own particular medium, the violin, without which no  artist may become truly great. For Jascha Heifetz, with his wonderful  record of accomplishment achieved, and with triumphs still to come  before him, does not believe in \"all work and no play.\"            [Illustration: JASCHA HEIFETZ, with hand-written note]                          THE DANGER OF PRACTICING TOO MUCH    He laughed when I put forward the theory that he worked many hours a  day, perhaps as many as six or eight? \"No,\" he said, \"I do not think I  could ever have made any progress if I had practiced six hours a day. In  the first place I have never believed in practicing too much--it is just  as bad as practicing too little! And then there are so many other things  I like to do. I am fond of reading and I like sport: tennis, golf,  bicycle riding, boating, swimming, etc. Often when I am supposed to be  practicing hard I am out with my camera, taking pictures; for I have  become what is known as a 'camera fiend.' And just now I have a new car,  which I have learned to drive, and which takes up a good deal of my  time. I have never believed in grinding. In fact I think that if one has  to work very hard to get his piece, it will show in the execution. To  interpret music properly, it is necessary to eliminate mechanical  difficulty; the audience should not feel the struggle of the artist with  what are considered hard passages. I hardly ever practice more than  three hours a day on an average, and besides, I keep my Sunday when I  do not play at all, and sometimes I make an extra holiday. As to six or  seven hours a day, I would not have been able to stand it at all.\"    I implied that what Mr. Heifetz said might shock thousands of aspiring  young violinists for whom he pointed a moral: \"Of course,\" his answer  was, \"you must not take me too literally. Please do not think because I  do not favor overdoing practicing that one can do without it. I'm quite  frank to say I could not myself. But there is a happy medium. I suppose  that when I play in public it looks easy, but before I ever came on the  concert stage I worked very hard. And I do yet--but always putting the  two things together, mental work and physical work. And when a certain  point of effort is reached in practice, as in everything else, there  must be relaxation.                        THE DEVELOPMENT OF A VIRTUOSE TECHNIC    \"Have I what is called a 'natural' technic? It is hard for me to say,  perhaps so. But if such is the case I had to develop it, to assure it,  to perfect it. If you start playing at three, as I did, with a little  violin one-quarter of the regular size, I suppose violin playing becomes  second nature in the course of time. I was able to find my way about in  all seven positions within a year's time, and could play the Kayser  _etudes_; but that does not mean to say I was a virtuoso by any means.    \"My first teacher? My first teacher was my father, a good violinist and  concertmaster of the Vilna Symphony Orchestra. My first appearance in  public took place in an overcrowded auditorium of the Imperial Music  School in Vilna, Russia, when I was not quite five. I played the  _Fantaisie Pastorale_ with piano accompaniment. Later, at the age of  six, I played the Mendelssohn concerto in Kovno to a full house.  Stage-fright? No, I cannot say I have ever had it. Of course, something  may happen to upset one before a concert, and one does not feel quite at  ease when first stepping on the stage; but then I hope that is not  stage-fright!    \"At the Imperial Music School in Vilna, and before, I worked at all the  things every violinist studies--I think that I played almost everything.  I did not work too hard, but I worked hard enough. In Vilna my teacher  was Malkin, a pupil of Professor Auer, and when I had graduated from the  Vilna school I went to Auer. Did I go directly to his classes? Well,  no, but I had only a very short time to wait before I joined the  classes conducted by Auer personally.                             PROFESSOR AUER AS A TEACHER    \"Yes, he is a wonderful and an incomparable teacher; I do not believe  there is one in the world who can possibly approach him. Do not ask me  just how he does it, for I would not know how to tell you. But he is  different with each pupil--perhaps that is one reason he is so great a  teacher. I think I was with Professor Auer about six years, and I had  both class lessons and private lessons of him, though toward the end my  lessons were not so regular. I never played exercises or technical works  of any kind for the Professor, but outside of the big things--the  concertos and sonatas, and the shorter pieces which he would let me  prepare--I often chose what I wanted.    \"Professor Auer was a very active and energetic teacher. He was never  satisfied with a mere explanation, unless"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15540"],[0,"Across India; Or, Live Boys in the Far East (#10)"],[1,"additions to which  had been made at Cairo, Alexandria, and elsewhere.    \"This is not a library of romances,\" said his lordship with a smile, as he  took in the encyclopaedias, books of travel, scientific treatises, and  geographical works.    \"No, sir; they cover a broad range of useful information,\" replied the  commander. \"Those of our company who are disposed to read novels supply  themselves with that kind of literature. Quite a number of them are  lecturers\"--    \"Lecturers!\" exclaimed the distinguished guest. \"Then a large number of  your passengers must be scientific people.\"    \"Not at all, sir; the large majority of them are men and women of good  education, and Professor Giroud is a learned Frenchman who has been a  lecturer at various colleges and schools. Dr. Hawkes is a leading member of  his profession, and is sometimes a lecturer in various medical and surgical  institutions in New York. Both of these gentlemen are making this voyage to  regain their health, injured by over-work.\"    \"You are fortunate in having such men on board,\" added his lordship.    \"But most of our lecturers are persons of fair education, and only three of  them have been graduated from the university. We assign subjects to them  some time in advance, and they prepare themselves for the occasion. This  gives the unprofessional people an interest in the exercises they would not  otherwise have. For example, Mr. Woolridge\"--    \"I beg pardon, but he is the father of the beautiful young lady who was  seated at the table next to Mr. Belgrave, is he not?\" interposed Lord  Tremlyn.    \"The same, sir. At first he considered the lectures a bore; and doubtless  they were such to him, for he had been a sporting-man and a yachtsman,  though he has since abandoned the races. But I gave him as a subject the  horses and other animals of Egypt. He did very well with it in his peculiar  way; and since that he is one of the most interested in the lectures,--or  perhaps I had better call them simply talks,\" added the commander.    \"Then this voyage will create a new taste for him.\"    \"I have no doubt of it. He is a Fifth Avenue millionaire, and he is able to  cultivate any taste he may acquire. Mr. Belgrave is one of our most useful  speakers, for he studies his subjects very faithfully. He is a devoted  student, speaks French fluently, and gets along very well with Spanish.  This voyage is a college course for him.\"    \"Do your ladies take an interest in these lectures, Captain Ringgold?\"    \"All of them, though I have assigned a subject to only one of them. They  all manifest their interest by asking questions. Like myself, Mrs. Belgrave  and Mrs. Blossom are Methodists, while the Woolridge family are  Episcopalians, though none of us are bigoted. The sisters of my church are  very favorable to religious topics, such as were suggested on the Nile; and  when we were near the land of Goshen and the Sinai peninsula Mrs. Belgrave  spoke to us in this connection. Mrs. Blossom is one of the \"salt of the  earth,\" a very good woman, very religious, and her studies have been  confined to the Bible and her denominational newspapers. Her education was  neglected, and she is rather tonguey, so that she asks curious questions;  but we all esteem her very highly, though her American peculiarities may  seem very odd to you.\"    \"I have known similar people in England, and your description of her leads  me to respect the lady,\" replied the titled gentleman, who appeared to be  very democratic so far as homely merit was concerned.    Dr. Hawkes had taken his professional brother in charge, and Louis, Sir  Modava, as the commander had Lord Tremlyn, and they were showing them over  the ship. We need not follow them or repeat their explanations; but they  finally reached the promenade deck, where all the officers were presented  to the guests of the steamer. At Conference Hall the three couples met, and  the lectures were again commented upon; for this subject was uppermost in  the mind of the commander.    \"Do you have a lecture to-day, Captain Ringgold?\" asked his lordship.    \"No, sir; this is Sunday, and we keep the Sabbath in a reasonable manner,  and the conference is usually omitted on this day, though when the subject  is appropriate for the day the lecture is given. The professor is a Roman  Catholic; but we have not had the slightest friction in regard to any man's  creed. The owner and voyager in our consort, the white ship abreast of us,  whose boat picked up five men of your ship's company, is a Mohammedan,  though the captain and his wife are Congregationalists. We have a religious  service on board at eleven o'clock, to which your party are invited, though  no umbrage will be taken if you prefer to absent yourselves.\"    \"I shall certainly attend,\" replied his lordship; and his companions said  the same. \"Have you a chaplain?\"    \"We have not, and I am obliged to act in that capacity for the want of a  better,\" replied the captain. \"We Methodists are all trained to 'speak in  meeting,' whether we have the gift or not.\"    At the appointed time the gong was sounded for divine service, and four  whistles were given, that all on board might hear the call. Chairs had been  provided for the guests, and all the party were seated when six bells  struck. The two engineers of the Travancore were seated on the platform  with, the cook, and all the officers and seamen who could be spared stood  within hearing.    Most of the party were provided with tune-books, and the captain gave out  \"The Life-Boat.\" Books were passed to the strangers, and the commander led  off in the singing. Lord Tremlyn and Dr. Ferrolan joined in with vigorous  bass voices. Captain Ringgold then followed with an extemporaneous prayer,  in which he poured forth his thanks to the God who rules the sea and the  land for the mercy that had spared their brothers from other lands from the  mighty power of the raging billows. Instead of reading a printed sermon as  usual, he gave an impromptu address relating to the event of the early  morning. Its bearing was very religious, and it was as eloquent as it was  homely compared with studied discourses.    After the singing of \"Nearer, my God, to thee,\" the service closed; but the  people were invited to keep their seats. Without any explanation of what  was to follow, the captain introduced Lord Tremlyn.    \"Mr. Commander, and ladies and gentlemen, I am utterly unable to express my  high appreciation of the religious service in which we have all assisted.  It went to my heart, and I am sure we who have been saved from perishing in  the stormy billows joined heartily with him who officiated in giving thanks  to God for our preservation,\" his lordship began.    \"We are all profoundly impressed by the kindness, the unbounded  hospitality, which have been extended to us in our unfortunate, I may say  our forlorn, condition; and I am sure that not one of us, from the amateur  captain of the Travancore, to the coolies who were saved by the Blanche,  will ever cease to bless the commander, the officers, the crew, and the  passengers of the Guardian-Mother for the overwhelming kindness and care  they have all bestowed upon us. Though we are not at the festive board, I  venture to propose to you the health of Captain Ringgold, as the  representative of all to whom we are so gratefully indebted.\"               \"For he's a jolly good fellow!              For he's a jolly good fellow!              For he's a jolly good fellow!              So say we all of us!\"    To the astonishment, and perhaps to the disgust, of the two Methodist  ladies, Dr. Ferrolan struck up this refrain, singing with a vigor which  proved his earnestness. Sir Modava, the engineers, and the cook immediately  joined in with him. Dr. Hawkes, Uncle Moses, Mr. Woolridge, and others,  because they approved the sentiment of the words, struck in at the second  line, and it became a full chorus before the last line was reached.    It is an English custom to follow a toast to a distinguished personage with  this refrain, as expressive of the sentiments of the company; and though it  was not adapted to Sunday use, it was sincere and heartfelt on the part of  all who sang it. Captain Ringgold rose and bowed his thanks, and Lord  Tremlyn spoke again:--    \"It is very natural that you should desire to know something about the  guests who have been so fortuitously cast into your kindly embrace, and  especially in regard to the calamity which has made us the recipients of  your generous hospitality; and Captain Ringgold gives us this opportunity  to gratify your reasonable curiosity. I am no orator, like my brother, the  commander of the Guardian-Mother, and I shall call upon my friend and  secretary, who has been travelling with me in India for his health, to give  you the desired information.\" Though it was Sunday, even the commander  joined in the applause that greeted the doctor when he mounted the rostrum.    \"Mr. Commander, and ladies and gentlemen, I beg to inform you that my Lord  Tremlyn is quite as capable of speaking for himself as I am for him; but as  I am called upon to make this explanation, I shall do so with pleasure. I  have the honor to be the secretary of the Right Honorable Viscount Tremlyn,  the son of the noble earl who is Secretary of State for India. He has been  on a mission in the interests of his father to obtain certain information,  though he holds no official position.    \"Sir Modava Rao has held several official positions in India, and is  perhaps more familiar with the country and its British and native  governments than any other man. He has been travelling with Lord Tremlyn,  to assist him in obtaining the information connected with his unofficial  mission. My lord has completed the work assigned to him; but the viceroy  wished him to visit the Imam of Muscat unofficially for a certain purpose I  am not at liberty to state.    \"In a small steam-yacht"]]]
