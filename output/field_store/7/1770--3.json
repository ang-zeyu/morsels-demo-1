They were all armed, but on  seeing the Governor approach with signs of friendship, alone and unarmed,  they readily returned his confidence by laying down their weapons. They  were perfectly devoid of cloathing, yet seemed fond of ornaments, putting  the beads and red baize that were given them, on their heads or necks,  and appearing pleased to wear them. The presents offered by their new  visitors were all readily accepted, nor did any kind of disagreement  arise while the ships remained in Botany Bay. This very pleasing effect  was produced in no small degree by the personal address, as well as by  the great care and attention of the Governor. Nor were the orders which  enforced a conduct so humane, more honourable to the persons from whom  they originated, than the punctual execution of them was to the officers  sent out: it was evident that their wishes coincided with their duty; and  that a sanguinary temper was no longer to disgrace the European settlers  in countries newly discovered.    The next care after landing was the examination of the bay itself, from  which it appeared that, though extensive, it did not afford a shelter  from the easterly winds: and that, in consequence of its shallowness,  ships even of a moderate draught, would always be obliged to anchor with  the entrance of the bay open, where they must be exposed to a heavy sea,  that rolls in whenever it blows hard from the eastward.    Several runs of fresh water were found in different parts of the bay, but  there did not appear to be any situation to which there was not some very  strong objection. In the northern part of it is a small creek, which runs  a considerable way into the country, but it has water only for a boat,  the sides of it are frequently overflowed, and the low lands near it are  a perfect swamp. The western branch of the bay is continued to a great  extent, but the officers sent to examine it could not find there any  supply of fresh water, except in very small drains.    Point Sutherland offered the most eligible situation, having a run of  good water, though not in very great abundance. But to this part of the  harbour the ships could not approach, and the ground near it, even in the  higher parts, was in general damp and spungy. Smaller numbers might  indeed in several spots have found a comfortable residence, but no place  was found in the whole circuit of Botany Bay which seemed at all  calculated for the reception of so large a settlement. While this  examination was carried on, the whole fleet had arrived. The Supply had  not so much outsailed the other ships as to give Governor Phillip the  advantage he had expected in point of time. On the 19th of January, the  Alexander, Scarborough, and Friendship, cast anchor in Botany Bay; and on  the 20th, the Sirius, with the remainder of the convoy*. These ships had  all continued very healthy; they had not, however, yet arrived at their  final station.    [* The annexed view of Botany Bay, represents the Supply, etc. at anchor,  and the Sirius with her convoy coming into the bay.]    The openness of this bay, and the dampness of the soil, by which the  people would probably be rendered unhealthy, had already determined the  Governor to seek another situation. He resolved, therefore, to examine  Port Jackson, a bay mentioned by Captain Cook as immediately to the north  of this. There he hoped to find, not only a better harbour, but a fitter  place for the establishment of his new government. But that no time might  be lost, in case of a disappointment in these particulars, the ground  near Point Sutherland was ordered immediately to be cleared, and  preparations to be made for landing, under the direction of the  Lieutenant Governor.    These arrangements having been settled, Governor Phillip prepared to  proceed to the examination of Port Jackson: and as the time of his  absence, had he gone in the Supply, must have been very uncertain,  he went round with three boats; taking with him Captain Hunter  and several other officers, that by examining several parts of the  harbour at once the greater dispatch might be made.    22d January, 1788.    On the 22d of January they set out upon this expedition, and early  in the afternoon arrived at Port Jackson, which is distant about three  leagues. Here all regret arising from the former disappointments was  at once obliterated; and Governor Phillip had the satisfaction to find  one of the finest harbours in the world, in which a thousand sail of  the line might ride in perfect security.    The different coves of this harbour were examined with all possible  expedition, and the preference was given to one which had the finest  spring of water, and in which ships can anchor so close to the shore,  that at a very small expence quays may be constructed at which the  largest vessels may unload. This cove is about half a mile in length, and  a quarter of a mile across at the entrance. In honour of Lord Sydney, the  Governor distinguished it by the name of Sydney Cove.    On the arrival of the boats at Port Jackson, a second party of the  natives made its appearance near the place of landing. These also were  armed with lances, and at first were very vociferous; but the same gentle  means used towards the others easily persuaded these also to discard  their suspicions, and to accept whatsoever was offered. One man in  particular, who appeared to be the chief of this tribe, shewed very  singular marks both of confidence in his new friends, and of determined  resolution. Under the guidance of Governor Phillip, to whom he  voluntarily intrusted himself, he went to a part of the beach where the  men belonging to the boats were then boiling their meat: when he  approached the marines, who were drawn up near that place, and saw that  by proceeding he should be separated from his companions, who remained  with several of the officers at some distance, he stopped, and with great  firmness, seemed by words and gestures to threaten revenge if any  advantage should be taken of his situation. He then went on with perfect  calmness to examine what was boiling in the pot, and by the manner in  which he expressed his admiration, made it evident that he intended to  profit by what he saw. Governor Phillip contrived to make him understand  that large shells might conveniently be used for the same purpose, and it  is probable that by these hints, added to his own observation, he will be  enabled to introduce the art of boiling among his countrymen. Hitherto  they appear to have known no other way of dressing food than broiling.  Their methods of kindling fire are probably very imperfect and laborious,  for it is observed that they usually keep it burning, and are very rarely  seen without either a fire actually made, or a piece of lighted wood,  which they carry with them from place to place, and even in their  canoes.* The perpetual fires, which in some countries formed a part of  the national religion, had perhaps no other origin than a similar  inability to produce it at pleasure; and if we suppose the original flame  to have been kindled by lightning, the fiction of its coming down from  heaven will be found to deviate very little from the truth.    [* In Hawksw. Voy. vol. iii. p. 234, it is said that they produce fire  with great facility, etc. which account is the more correct, time will  probably show.]    In passing near a point of land in this harbour, the boats were perceived  by a number of the natives, twenty of whom waded into the water unarmed,  received what was offered them, and examined the boat with a curiosity  which impressed a higher idea of them than any former accounts of their  manners had suggested. This confidence, and manly behaviour, induced  Governor Phillip, who was highly pleased with it, to give the place the  name of Manly Cove. The same people afterwards joined the party at the  place where they had landed to dine. They were then armed, two of them  with shields and swords, the rest with lances only. The swords were made  of wood, small in the gripe, and apparently less formidable than a good  stick. One of these men had a kind of white clay rubbed upon the upper  part of his face, so as to have the appearance of a mask. This ornament,  if it can be called such, is not common among them, and is probably  assumed only on particular occasions, or as a distinction to a few  individuals. One woman had been seen on the rocks as the boats passed,  with her face, neck and breasts thus painted, and to our people appeared  the most disgusting figure imaginable; her own countrymen were perhaps  delighted by the beauty of the effect.    During the preparation for dinner the curiosity of these visitors  rendered them very troublesome, but an innocent contrivance altogether  removed the inconvenience. Governor Phillip drew a circle round the place  where the English were, and without much difficulty made the natives  understand that they were not to pass that line; after which they sat  down in perfect quietness. Another proof how tractable these people are,  when no insult or injury is offered, and when proper means are to  influence the simplicity of their minds.    24 January 1788    January 24th, 1788. On the 24th of January, Governor Phillip having  sufficiently explored Port Jackson, and found it in all respects highly  calculated to receive such a settlement as he was appointed to establish,  returned to Botany Bay. On his arrival there, the reports made to him,  both of the ground which the people were clearing, and of the upper"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15106"],[0,"Origin of the Anglo-Boer War Revealed (2nd ed.) (#10)"],[1,"gans--the Bloemfontein _Express_,  the Pretoria _Volksstem_, the _Standard and Diggers' News_ of  Johannesburg, and numerous papers of note abroad as well. These were  coached, in the usual masterly manner, sophisticating and perverting  truth. Whenever a lull occurred in treating one or other of the more  salient questions, those South African papers would invariably  contain--especially in their Dutch columns--aspersive articles, coupled  with invective comments to prejudice the Boer mind and to reawaken  anti-English sentiments. It is notable as a proof that the Bond party  lacked all occasions for recriminations, so that those papers had to  resort for material for their vituperation to distorted incidents of  Transvaal history prior to the peace of 1881. There would, for example,  be dished up falsely rendered and dramatically coloured and perverted  selections, such as the treacherous massacre of Retief's party in 1838,  averring that the Zulu king, Dingaan, had been incited thereto by the  British authorities; tragic descriptions of events, coupled with the  massacres by Zulu impis soon after at Weenen and Blaauwkrantz, averred  also to have taken place at the instance of the English Government, and  ever and anon references and full tragic descriptions of the  Slachtersnek execution in 1816, omitting to state that the Boer culprits  were hanged after fair and open trial and conviction by a \"Boer\" jury  for high treason in conspiring with Kaffirs against the Government,  which crime had led to bloodshed, and that their relatives had been  ordered to witness the execution because they had been abettors and  privy to the crime.    Books teaching the history of South Africa were adapted for school use  wherein denunciations against the English appear in almost every  chapter. Poetry in the vernacular Dutch and pamphlets teeming with like  burdens and calumnies also did their share in inspiring race hatred.    Pro-Boer journalism in England and elsewhere abroad had assumed such  dimensions, especially during the past decade, as to bring the Secret  Service expenditure on that head during recent years to over L100,000  per annum. Dr. Leyds, the Transvaal ambassador, now (December, 1899) in  Europe, is known to some to have with him some L250,000 to defray Press  expenditure, etc., apart from the millions to which he is authorized to  engage his Government in diplomatic projects, such as procuring allies,  or to create embroilments and diversions to the prejudice of England.    To sum up the success achieved by anti-English propaganda, we find the  Boer nation, from the Zambesi to the Cape, unanimous in convictions as  to their fancied claims, their own absolute innocence, and the  immeasurable guilt of the British Government, abetted by  capitalism--guilt which cries to heaven for retribution; and those  convictions take with each man the form of a resolute patriotism wherein  mingled fanaticism and religious fervour in their cause form a  powerfully sustaining part.    Partisanship outside of Africa counts by millions of individuals and  entire peoples; with these it is not so much conviction, but rather  persuasion induced by political hatred and the souring effects of  jealousy and unsuccessful rivalry. This feature is, of course, most  accentuated in Holland, where, with the eyes set upon the loaves and  fishes in South Africa, that nation has for some time been \"publicly  praying\" for Boer victory over England. These are instances of mere  interest in lieu of genuine convictions. In England the spectacle is  more varied. There we see interest where there are paid agencies, and  persuasion more or less pronounced induced by political party spirit and  also by real convictions. It is in regard to the latter category where  perverted journalism triumphs most and stabs deepest, where men of  honour and patriotism have adopted views which clash against public  interest, and convictions which torture their own minds with grief and  shame under the supposed idea of England's unjust attitude towards the  Boer people, assuming that a Government majority allows itself to be  actuated by base motives.    Is it not attributable in a large proportion to misguided as well as to  venal journalism that the Boer cause has so heavily scored?    Was all this not manifest in the divisions of England's counsels, in the  hampered progress of her diplomacy, her fateful hesitancy and delay in  providing appropriate preventive and protective measures in South  Africa?    And as regards the tenacity of those convictions, it is with them as it  is in plant life. The longer a tree is in maturing, the harder is it to  uproot it.    The activities of Bond propaganda have been in continuance for many  years, and the prejudices fostered so long are correspondingly  deep-rooted.    Bond patriotism was not long subjected to the strain of individual  contributions and unpaid performances. When the Transvaal revenues  advanced with such giant strides the Afrikaner Bond leaders in that  State contrived arrangements by which the financial requirements were  supplied from State receipts. Nor was the least compunction felt in  doing so. Was the revenue of the State not chiefly derived from the  Uitlander element--from Uitlander investments, which all throve from the  nation's own buried gold wealth? No scruples existed to provide from  those sources the armaments and all else needed for the common cause of  conquest.    A secret service fund of some L40,000 per year only was placed upon the  budget list. But this amount was vastly exceeded by the growing  requirements of the Afrikaner Bond for expenditure in South Africa  alone. It was easily contrived to divert, _sub rosa_, large State  receipts to supply the remaining financial needs. Among these figured,  besides the heavy outlays in journalism abroad, gratuities, etc., a  large bill also for secret agencies, spies, and the like.    The entire expenditure was under the direction of a few only of the  trusted leaders and audited by the chiefs, all being kept otherwise  undivulged.    The Transvaal thus became the treasury as well as the arsenal of the  entire Afrikaner Bond.    Hundreds of agents were in constant employ in the Cape Colonies and  Natal suborning the Boer colonists; many of them occupied positions in  various branches of the Colonial Government, and were able to supply  information upon any subject and even to influence elections.    There were numerous permanent agents drawing large emoluments in Europe  also, and emissaries to different places abroad, some touring in  America, England, and the Continent, as the Rev. Mr. Bosman did  recently, and also the P.M.G., Isaac van Alphen.    Much energy and money were also devoted to electioneering campaigns, as  had notoriously been done in the Cape Colony towards bringing in a Bond  majority. Large sums are spent in the diplomatic arena in Holland to  propitiate foreign statesmen, soliciting sympathy, and in coquettings  for Transvaal allies. One of these attempts that failed had been with  Germany. It would appear that some progress had been feasible some years  ago in temporarily luring Emperor William to favour a Holland-Transvaal  combination, but when that sovereign had at last penetrated the infamous  business that lay behind it all, he, as a true \"_Bayard_\" promptly  washed his hands clean of it, preferring to forego obvious brilliant  advantages for his people than to sully Germany's fair fame in a  connection amounting to no less than abetting a foul conspiracy.    The readers of the Johannesburg _Standard and Diggers' News_ will  remember among the staple attacks upon capitalism quite a series of  articles intended to decoy mining artisans and operatives to Boer views.  Secret agents were also employed for that purpose, and to induce the  belief that the Government was the enemy of capitalism, and would  champion its victims (the mining operatives) in the State. It would  support miners and the working class generally against attempts to  curtail the just rights of labour, and to parade its sincerity actually  passed a law constituting eight tours a legal day's labour. With such  coquettings it was hoped to gain the miners' confidence and adhesion.  Those men were, however, not to be taught by quasi-socialistic  professions of concern, and when, some months later, the exodus prior  to the war occurred, they nearly all left, much to the disgust and  discomfiture of the Government, which had counted upon them to stay to  work the mines for its own account when the moment should arrive.    The appropriation of gold mines and their exploitation for Government  benefit bring about a singular anomaly for a nation engaged in war,  viz., that of a plethora of gold and a scarcity of paper currency, the  Transvaal mint coining the sinews of war at the expense of its victims,  but the plundered gold after all not equalling commercial paper values.    In connection with the foregoing remarks the following may also be said.  States professing neutrality still permit themselves to trade with the  Transvaal to a large extent. It is notorious that that State possesses  no funds available for payments except the gold derived from the  misappropriated mines. The output is seized in its entirety, and not  limited to the extent accruing to British scrip holders only. The  hustling rivalry of doing business with the Transvaal thus involves  receiving stolen money in payment of trade accounts. We see the  receivers eager to stand upon the same platform as the thief, thus not  only as his political partisans, but also as his accomplices.          DISLOYALTY OF COLONIAL BOERS      The Boer section in the Cape Colonies represents nearly one-half of the  white population there. Their representatives in the administration were  ever profuse and assertive in professions of loyalty to the Queen and to  the English Government, and any aspersions to "]]]
