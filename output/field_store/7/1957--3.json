You'll have to go on  foot but they'll never look for you on that side. When you get to the  easygoin', down in the valley, buy a hoss and hit for the railroad.\"    Kate turned on Vic, trembling. \"Are you going to let him do it?\" she  asked. \"Are you going to let him do it, again?\"    He had seen a certain promise of escape held before him the moment  before, but pride made him throw that certainty away.    \"Not in a million years,\" he answered.    \"You'll do what I say, and you'll start now. I got a better idea than  that. If you head just over the side of that north mountain you'll find  a path that a hoss can follow. It won't take you clear away from them  down below, but there ain't a chance in ten that they'll come that way.  Take my old brown hoss with the white face. He'll carry you safe.\"    Vic hesitated. The fierce eyes of Kate were on him and with all his soul  he wanted to play the man, but liberty was sweet, sweeter than ever to  Vic. She seemed to give him up as he stood there with his heart, in his  throat; she turned back to Barry.    \"Dan!\" she pleaded.    She had not touched him, but he made a vague gesture as though brushing  away a restraining hand. She cried: \"If you come close to them--if, they  start shooting--you might want to fight back--\"    \"They shot before,\" he answered, \"and I didn't fire once.\"    \"But the second time?\"    To be sure, there would be danger in it, but as Barry himself had said,  if the way was closed to him he could surrender to them, and they could  not harm him. Vic tried in vain to understand this overmastering terror  in the girl, for she seemed more afraid of what Dan might do to the  posse than what the posse might do to Dan.    \"This ain't a day for fightin',\" said Dan, and he waved towards the  mountains. It was one of those misty spring days when the sun raises  a vapor from the earth and the clouds blow low around the upper peaks;  every ravine was poured full of blue shadow, and even high up the  slopes, where patches of snow had melted, grass glimmered, a tender  green among the white. \"This ain't a day for fighting,\" he repeated.    A shrill, quavering neigh, like the whinney of a galloping horse, rang  from beyond the house, and Vic saw the black stallion racing up and down  his corral. Back and forth he wove, then raced straight for the bars,  flashed above them, and stood free beyond, with the sunshine trembling  on him. He seemed to pause, wondering what to do with his new freedom,  then he came at a loose gallop for the master. Not Satan alone, for  now Black Bart slid across the plateau like a shadow, weaving among the  boulders, and came straight towards Barry. Vic himself felt a change, a  sort of uneasy happiness; he breathed it with the air. The very sunlight  was electric. He saw Kate run close to Barry.    \"If you go this time, you'll never come back, Dan!\"    The black stallion swung up beside them, and as he halted his hoofs  knocked a rattling spray of pebbles ahead. On the other side of the  woman and the man the wolf-dog ran uneasily here and there, trying to  watch the face of the master which Kate obscured.    \"I ain't goin' far. I just want to get a hoss runnin' under me enough to  cut a wind.\"    \"Even Satan and Bart feel what I feel. They came without being called.  They never do that unless there's danger ahead. What can I do to  convince you? Dan, you'll drive me mad!\"    He made no answer, and if the girl wished him to stay now seemed the  time for persuasion; but she gave up the argument suddenly. She turned  away, and Vic saw in her face the same desperate, helpless look as that  of a boy who cannot swim, beyond his depth in the river. There was no  sign of tears; they might come afterwards.    What had come over them? This desperation in Kate, this touch of anxiety  in the very horse and the wolf-dog? Vic forgot his own danger while  he stared and it seemed to him that the spark of change had come from  Barry. There was something in his eyes which Vic found hard to meet.    \"The moment you came I knew you brought bad luck with you!\" cried Kate.  \"He brought you in bleeding. He saved you and came in with blood on his  hands and I guessed at the end. Oh, I wish you--\"    \"Kate!\" broke in Barry.    She dropped upon one of the stones and buried her face in her hands and  Dan paid no more attention to her.    \"Hurry up,\" he said. \"They're across the river.\"    And Vic gave up the struggle, for the tears of Kate made him think  of Betty Neal and he followed Dan towards the corral. Around them the  stallion ran like a hunting dog eager to be off.        Chapter X. One Trail Ends    \"You can trust Grey Molly to me, Vic,\" said Dan, standing at the head of  the gray mare. \"I'll keep her as safe as if she was Satan.\"    Gregg watched her almost sadly. He had always taken a rather childish  pride in her fierceness. She knew him as a dog knows its master and he  had always been the only one who could handle her readily in the saddle.  But one who knew nothing of horses and their ways could see the entente  which had been instantly established between Barry and Grey Molly. When  he spoke her ears pricked. When he raised his hand she stretched her  nose inquisitively.    There was no pitch in her when Barry swung into the saddle and that  was a thing without precedent in Molly's history. She tried none of her  usual catlike side-steps and throwing of the head. Altogether, Vic was  troubled even as he would have been at the sight of Betty Neal in the  arms of another man. It was desertion.    \"Dan,\" he said, \"I know what you've done for me and I know what you're  doin' now.\" He took the slender hand of the other in his big paw.    \"If the time comes when I can pay you back, so help me God--\"    \"Oaths don't do no good,\" cut in Barry without a trace of emotion. He  added frankly: \"It ain't altogether for your sake. Those gents down  there have played tag once with me and now I'd like to play with them.  Molly's fresh today.\"    He was already looking over his shoulder while he spoke; as if his mind  were even then at work upon the posse.    \"S'long.\"    \"S'long, partner. Good luck.\"    So they parted and Vic, jogging slowly up the steep path, saw Grey Molly  wheeled and sent at a sweeping gallop over the meadow. His heart  leaped jealously and the next moment went out in a flood of gratitude,  admiration, as Barry swung off the shoulder of the mountain, waved his  hat towards Kate, and dipped at once out of sight.    The shelving ground along which Barry rode sometimes was a broad surface  like a spacious, graded road; again it shelved away and opened a view  of all the valley. When he reached the first of these places the rider  looked back and down and saw the posse skirting rapidly on his side of  the river, behind him and close to the cliff. They rode at an easy lope,  and he could see that their heads were bent to watch the ground. Even  at this casual gait they would reach the point at which he and the gray  must swing onto the floor of the valley before him unless he urged Molly  to top speed. He must get there at a sufficient distance from them  to escape close rifle fire, and certainly beyond point-blank revolver  range. Accordingly he threw his weight more into the stirrups and over  the withers of the mare. This brought greater poundage on her forehand  and made her apt to stumble or actually miss her step, but it increased  her running power.    There was no need of a touch of the spurs. The gathering of the reins  seemed to tell Molly everything. One ear flickered back, then she leaped  out at full speed. It was as though the mind of the man had sent an  electric current down the reins and told her his thought. Now she  floundered at her foot, struck a loose stone, now she veered sharply and  wide to escape a boulder, now she cleared a gulley with a long leap, and  riding high as he was, bent forward out of balance to escape observation  from below. It was only a miracle of horsemanship that kept her from  breaking her neck as they lurched down the pitch. Grey Molly seemed to  be carrying no weight, only a clinging intelligence.    At this speed he was sure to reach the valley safely in front unless the  posse caught sight of him on the way and gave chase, and Barry counted  on that instinct in hunting men which makes them keep their eyes  low--the same sense which leads a searcher to look first under the bed  and last of all at the wall and ceiling. Once more, as he neared his  goal, he looked back and down, and there came the six horsemen, their  quirts swinging, their hat-brims blown straight up they raced at full  speed. They had seen the gray and they rode for blood.    The outstretched neck of Grey Molly, her flattened ears, the rapid  clangor of her hoofs on the rocks, seemed to indicate that she already  was doing her uttermost, but after the glimpse of the pursuit, Barry  crouched a little lower, his hand gathering the reins just behind her  head, his voice was near her, speaking softly, quickly. She responded  with a snort of effort, as though she realized the danger and willingly  accepted it. One ear, as she rushed down the slope, was pricked and one  flagged back to the guiding, strengthening voice of the rider.    The path wound in leisurely curves now, but there was a straight  cut down a slide of gravel, a dangerous slope even in firm ground, a  terrible angle with those loose pebbles underfoot. Yet this was a time  for chance-taking. Already the dusty man on the roan rode with his  revolver balanced for the snap shot. The next instant his gun swung  down, he actually reined up in astonishment. The fugitive had flung  himself far back against the cantle and sent Grey Molly at the slide. It  was not a matter of running as the mare shot over the brink. Molly  sat back on her haunches, braced her forelegs, and went down like an  avalanche.

So well did they understand  the mentality and the trends of character of the German people that it  was comparatively easy to impose upon them a militaristic system and  philosophy by which the individual yielded countless personal liberties  for the alleged good of the state. Rigorous and compulsory military  service, unquestioning adherence to the doctrine that might makes right  and a cession to \"the All-Highest,\" as the Emperor was styled, of  supreme powers in the state, are some of the sufferances to which the  German people submitted.    German propaganda abroad was quite as vigorous as at home, but  infinitely less successful. The German High Command did not expect  England to enter the war. It counted upon America's neutrality with a  leaning toward Germany. It believed that German colonization in South  Africa and South America would incline these vast domains toward  friendship for the Central empires. How mistaken the propagandists and  psychologists were events have demonstrated.    It was this dream of world-domination by Teutonic kultur that supplied  the motive leading to the world's greatest war. Bosnia, an unwilling  province of Austria-Hungary, at one time a province of Serbia and  overwhelmingly Slavic in its population, had been seething for years  with an anti-Teutonic ferment. The Teutonic court at Vienna, leading the  minority Germanic party in Austria-Hungary, had been endeavoring to  allay the agitation among the Bosnian Slavs. In pursuance of that  policy, Archduke Francis Ferdinand, heir-presumptive to the thrones of  Austria and Hungary, and his morganatic wife, Sophia Chotek, Duchess of  Hohenberg, on June 28, 1914, visited Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia. On  the morning of that day, while they were being driven through the narrow  streets of the ancient town, a bomb was thrown at them, but they were  uninjured. They were driven through the streets again in the afternoon,  for purpose of public display. A student, just out of his 'teens, one  Gavrilo Prinzep, attacked the royal party with a magazine pistol and  killed both the Archduke and his wife.    Here was the excuse for which Germany had waited. Here was the dawn of  \"The Day.\" The Germanic court of Austria asserted that the crime was the  result of a conspiracy, leading directly to the Slavic court of Serbia.  The Serbians in their turn declared that they knew nothing of the  assassination. They pointed out the fact that Sophia Chotek was a Slav,  and that Francis Ferdinand was more liberal than any other member of the  Austrian royal household, and finally, that he, more than any other  member of the Austrian court, understood and respected the Slavic  character and aspirations.    At six o'clock on the evening of July 23d, Austria sent an ultimatum to  Serbia, presenting eleven demands and stipulating that categorical  replies must be delivered before six o'clock on the evening of July  25th. Although the language in which the ultimatum was couched was  humiliating to Serbia, the answer was duly delivered within the  stipulated time.    The demands of the Austrian note in brief were as follows:    1. The Serbian Government to give formal assurance of its condemnation  of Serb propaganda against Austria.    2. The next issue of the Serbian \"Official Journal\" was to contain a  declaration to that effect.    3. This declaration to express regret that Serbian officers had taken  part in the propaganda.    4. The Serbian Government to promise that it would proceed rigorously  against all guilty of such activity.    5. This declaration to be at once communicated by the King of Serbia to  his army, and to be published in the official bulletin as an order of  the day.    6. All anti-Austrian publications in Serbia to be suppressed.    7. The Serbian political party known as the \"National Union\" to be  suppressed, and its means of propaganda to be confiscated.    8. All anti-Austrian teaching in the schools of Serbia to be suppressed.    9. All officers, civil and military, who might be designated by Austria  as guilty of anti-Austrian propaganda to be dismissed by the Serbian  Government.    10. Austrian agents to co-operate with the Serbian Government in  suppressing all anti-Austrian propaganda, and to take part in the  judicial proceedings conducted in Serbia against those charged with  complicity in the crime at Sarajevo.    11. Serbia to explain to Austria the meaning of anti-Austrian utterances  of Serbian officials at home and abroad, since the assassination.    To the first and second demands Serbia unhesitatingly assented. To the  third demand, Serbia assented, although no evidence was given to show  that Serbian officers had taken part in the propaganda.    The Serbian Government assented to the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and  eighth demands also.    Extraordinary as was the ninth demand, which would allow the Austrian  Government to proscribe Serbian officials, so eager for peace and  friendship was the Serbian Government that it assented to it, with the  stipulation that the Austrian Government should offer some proof of the  guilt of the proscribed officers.    The tenth demand, which in effect allowed Austrian agents to control the  police and courts of Serbia, it was not possible for Serbia to accept  without abrogating her sovereignty. However, it was not unconditionally  rejected, but the Serbian Government asked that it be made the subject  of further discussion, or be referred to arbitration. The Serbian  Government assented to the eleventh demand, on the condition that if the  explanations which would be given concerning the alleged anti-Austrian  utterances of Serbian officials would not prove satisfactory to the  Austrian Government, the matter should be submitted to mediation or  arbitration.    Behind the threat conveyed in the Austrian ultimatum was the menacing  figure of militant Germany. The veil that had hitherto concealed the  hands that worked the string, was removed when Germany, under the  pretense of localizing the quarrel to Serbian and Austrian soil,  interrogated France and England, asking them to prevent Russia from  defending Serbia in the event of an attack by Austria upon the Serbs.  England and France promptly refused to participate in a tragedy which  would deliver Serbia to Austria as Bosnia had been delivered. Russia,  bound by race and creed to Serbia, read into the ultimatum of Teutonic  kultur a determination for warfare. Mobilization of the Russian forces  along the Austrian frontier was arranged, when it was seen that Serbia's  pacific reply to Austria's demands would be contemptuously disregarded  by Germany and Austria.    During the days that intervened between the issuance of the ultimatum  and the actual declaration of war by Germany against Russia on Saturday,  August 1st, various sincere efforts were made to stave off the  world-shaking catastrophe. Arranged chronologically, these events may  thus be summarized: Russia, on July 24th, formally asked Austria if she  intended to annex Serbian territory by way of reprisal for the  assassination at Sarajevo. On the same day Austria replied that it had  no present intention to make such annexation. Russia then requested an  extension of the forty-eight-hour time-limit named in the ultimatum.    Austria, on the morning of Saturday, July 25th, refused Russia's request  for an extension of the period named in the ultimatum. On the same day,  the newspapers published in Petrograd printed an official note issued by  the Russian Government warning Europe generally that Russia would not  remain indifferent to the fate of Serbia. These newspapers also printed  the appeal of the Serbian Crown Prince to the Czar dated on the  preceding day, urging that Russia come to the rescue of the menaced  Serbs. Serbia's peaceful reply surrendering on all points except one,  and agreeing to submit that to arbitration, was sent late in the  afternoon of the same day, and that night Austria declared the reply to  be unsatisfactory and withdrew its minister from Belgrade.    England commenced its attempts at pacification on the following day,  Sunday, July 26th. Sir Edward Grey spent the entire Sabbath in the  Foreign Office and personally conducted the correspondence that was  calculated to bring the dispute to a peaceful conclusion. He did not  reckon, however, with a Germany determined upon war, a Germany whose  manufacturers, ship-owners and Junkers had combined with its militarists  to achieve \"Germany's place in the sun\" even though the world would be  stained in the blood of the most frightful war this earth has ever  known. Realization of this fact did not come to Sir Edward Grey until  his negotiations with Germany and with Austria-Hungary had proceeded for  some time. His first suggestion was that the dispute between Russia and  Austria be committed to the arbitration of Great Britain, France, Italy  and Germany. Russia accepted this but Germany and Austria rejected it.  Russia had previously suggested that the dispute be settled by a  conference between the diplomatic heads at Vienna and Petrograd. This  also was refused by Austria.    Sir Edward Grey renewed his efforts on Monday, July 27th, with an  invitation to Germany to present suggestions of its own, looking toward  a settlement. This note was never answered. Germany took the position  that its proposition to compel Russia to stand aside while Austria  punished Serbia had been rejected by England and France and it had  nothing further to propose.    During all this period of negotiation the German Foreign Office, to all  outward appearances at least, had been acting independently of the  Kaiser, who was in Norway on a vacation trip. He returned to Potsdam on  the night of Sunday, July 26th. On Monday morning the Czar of Russia  received a personal message from the Kaiser, urging Russia to"]]]
