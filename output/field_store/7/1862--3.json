It would drive me mad in a week; but if  you really care for that sort of thing--\"    \"An occupied cottage?\" I interrupted.    \"Yes; a couple rent it from me, very decent people of the name of  Braithwaite. The man is out all day, and won't bother you when he's in;  he's not like other people, poor chap. But the woman 's all there, and  would do her best for you in a humble, simple, wholesome sort of way.\"    \"You think they would take me in?\"    \"They have taken other men--artists as a rule.\"    \"Then it's a picturesque country?\"    \"Oh, it's that if it's nothing else; but not a town for miles, mind you,  and hardly a village worthy the name.\"    \"Any fishing?\"    \"Yes--trout--small but plenty of 'em--in a beck running close behind the  cottage.\"    \"Come,\" cried I, \"this sounds delightful! Shall you be up there?\"    \"Only for a day or two,\" was the reply. \"I shan't trouble you, Mr.  Cole.\"    \"My dear sir, that wasn't my meaning at all. I'm only sorry I shall not  see something of you on your own heath. I can't thank you enough for  your kind suggestion. When do you suppose the Braithwaites could do with  me?\"    His charming smile rebuked my impatience.    \"We must first see whether they can do with you at all,\" said he. \"I  sincerely hope they can; but this is their time of year for tourists,  though perhaps a little late. I'll tell you what I'll do. As a matter  of fact, I'm going down there to-morrow, and I've got to telegraph to my  place in any case to tell them when to meet me. I'll send the telegram  first thing, and I'll make them send one back to say whether there's  room in the cottage or not.\"    I thanked him warmly, but asked if the cottage was close to Kirby Hall,  and whether this would not be giving a deal of trouble at the other end;  whereupon he mischievously misunderstood me a second time, saying the  cottage and the hall were not even in sight of each other, and I really  had no intrusion to fear, as he was a lonely bachelor like myself,  and would only be up there four or five days at the most. So I made my  appreciation of his society plainer than ever to him; for indeed I  had found a more refreshing pleasure in it already than I had hoped to  derive from mortal man again; and we parted, at three o'clock in the  morning, like old fast friends.    \"Only don't expect too much, my dear Mr. Cole,\" were his last words to  me. \"My own place is as ancient and as tumble-down as most ruins that  you pay to see over. And I'm never there myself because--I tell you  frankly--I hate it like poison!\"          CHAPTER VIII. A SMALL PRECAUTION      My delight in the society of this young Squire Rattray (as I soon was to  hear him styled) had been such as to make me almost forget the sinister  incident which had brought us together. When I returned to my room,  however, there were the open window and the litter on the floor to  remind me of what had happened earlier in the night. Yet I was less  disconcerted than you might suppose. A common housebreaker can have  few terrors for one who has braved those of mid-ocean single-handed; my  would-be visitor had no longer any for me; for it had not yet occurred  to me to connect him with the voices and the footsteps to which, indeed,  I had been unable to swear before the doctor. On the other hand, these  morbid imaginings (as I was far from unwilling to consider them) had  one and all deserted me in the sane, clean company of the capital young  fellow in the next room.    I have confessed my condition up to the time of this queer meeting.  I have tried to bring young Rattray before you with some hint of his  freshness and his boyish charm; and though the sense of failure is heavy  upon me there, I who knew the man knew also that I must fail to do him  justice. Enough may have been said, however, to impart some faint idea  of what this youth was to me in the bitter and embittering anti-climax  of my life. Conventional figures spring to my pen, but every one of them  is true; he was flowers in spring, he was sunshine after rain, he was  rain following long months of drought. I slept admirably after all;  and I awoke to see the overturned toilet-table, and to thrill as I  remembered there was one fellow-creature with whom I could fraternize  without fear of a rude reopening of my every wound.    I hurried my dressing in the hope of our breakfasting together. I  knocked at the next door, and, receiving no answer, even ventured  to enter, with the same idea. He was not there. He was not in the  coffee-room. He was not in the hotel.    I broke my fast in disappointed solitude, and I hung about disconsolate  all the morning, looking wistfully for my new-made friend. Towards  mid-day he drove up in a cab which he kept waiting at the curb.    \"It's all right!\" he cried out in his hearty way. \"I sent my telegram  first thing, and I've had the answer at my club. The rooms are vacant,  and I'll see that Jane Braithwaite has all ready for you by to-morrow  night.\"    I thanked him from my heart. \"You seem in a hurry!\" I added, as I  followed him up the stairs.    \"I am,\" said he. \"It's a near thing for the train. I've just time to  stick in my things.\"    \"Then I'll stick in mine,\" said I impulsively, \"and I'll come with you,  and doss down in any corner for the night.\"    He stopped and turned on the stairs.    \"You mustn't do that,\" said he; \"they won't have anything ready. I'm  going to make it my privilege to see that everything is as cosey as  possible when you arrive. I simply can't allow you to come to-day, Mr.  Cole!\" He smiled, but I saw that he was in earnest, and of course I gave  in.    \"All right,\" said I; \"then I must content myself with seeing you off at  the station.\"    To my surprise his smile faded, and a flush of undisguised annoyance  made him, if anything, better-looking than ever. It brought out a  certain strength of mouth and jaw which I had not observed there  hitherto. It gave him an ugliness of expression which only emphasized  his perfection of feature.    \"You mustn't do that either,\" said he, shortly. \"I have an appointment  at the station. I shall be talking business all the time.\"    He was gone to his room, and I went to mine feeling duly snubbed; yet I  deserved it; for I had exhibited a characteristic (though not chronic)  want of taste, of which I am sometimes guilty to this day. Not to show  ill-feeling on the head of it, I nevertheless followed him down again  in four or five minutes. And I was rewarded by his brightest smile as he  grasped my hand.    \"Come to-morrow by the same train,\" said he, naming station, line, and  hour; \"unless I telegraph, all will be ready and you shall be met. You  may rely on reasonable charges. As to the fishing, go up-stream--to the  right when you strike the beck--and you'll find a good pool or two. I  may have to go to Lancaster the day after to-morrow, but I shall give  you a call when I get back.\"    With that we parted, as good friends as ever. I observed that my regret  at losing him was shared by the boots, who stood beside me on the steps  as his hansom rattled off.    \"I suppose Mr. Rattray stays here always when he comes to town?\" said I.    \"No, sir,\" said the man, \"we've never had him before, not in my time;  but I shouldn't mind if he came again.\" And he looked twice at the coin  in his hand before pocketing it with evident satisfaction.    Lonely as I was, and wished to be, I think that I never felt my  loneliness as I did during the twenty-four hours which intervened  between Rattray's departure and my own. They dragged like wet days by  the sea, and the effect was as depressing. I have seldom been at such  a loss for something to do; and in my idleness I behaved like a child,  wishing my new friend back again, or myself on the railway with my new  friend, until I blushed for the beanstalk growth of my regard for him,  an utter stranger, and a younger man. I am less ashamed of it now: he  had come into my dark life like a lamp, and his going left a darkness  deeper than before.    In my dejection I took a new view of the night's outrage. It was no  common burglar's work, for what had I worth stealing? It was the work of  my unseen enemies, who dogged me in the street; they alone knew why; the  doctor had called these hallucinations, and I had forced myself to agree  with the doctor; but I could not deceive myself in my present mood.  I remembered the steps, the steps--the stopping when I stopped--the  drawing away in the crowded streets---the closing up in quieter places.  Why had I never looked round? Why? Because till to-day I had thought it  mere vulgar curiosity; because a few had bored me, I had imagined the  many at my heels; but now I knew--I knew! It was the few again: a few  who hated me even unto death.    The idea took such a hold upon me that I did not trouble my head with  reasons and motives. Certain persons had designs upon my life; that was  enough for me. On the whole, the thought was stimulating; it set a new  value on existence, and it roused a certain amount of spirit even in me.  I would give the fellows another chance before I left town. They should  follow me once more, and this time to some purpose. Last night they had  left a knife on me; to-night I would have a keepsake ready for them.    Hitherto I had gone unarmed since my landing, which, perhaps, was no  more than my duty as a civilized citizen. On Black Hill Flats, however,  I had formed another habit, of which I should never have broken myself  so easily, but for the fact that all the firearms I ever had were  reddening and rotting at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. I now went  out and bought me such a one as I had never possessed before.    The revolver was then in its infancy; but it did exist; and by dusk  I was owner of as fine a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17034"],[0,"English Fairy Tales (#10)"],[1,"    Now James the footman was truthful as well as honest, so he told the  master how he had come down to get the sick laundry-maid a drop of  brandy, but that his hand had shaken so that he could not pour it out,  and it had fallen on the ground, and that the smell of it had got to his  head.    \"A likely tale,\" said the master, and beat James soundly.    Then the master went to the mistress, his wife, and said: \"Send away  that laundry-maid of yours. Something has come over my men. They have  all drawn out their savings as if they were going to be married, yet  they don't leave, and I believe that girl is at the bottom of it.\"    But his wife would not hear of the laundry-maid being blamed; she was  the best servant in the house, and worth all the rest of them put  together; it was his men who were at fault. So they quarrelled over it;  but in the end the master gave in, and after this there was peace, since  the mistress bade the girl keep herself to herself, and none of the men  would say ought of what had happened for fear of the laughter of the  other servants.    So it went on until one day when the master was going a-driving, the  coach was at the door, and the footman was standing to hold the coach  open, and the butler on the steps all ready, when who should pass  through the yard, so saucy and bright with a great basket of clean  clothes, but the laundry-maid. And the sight of her was too much for  James, the footman, who began to blub.    \"She is a wicked girl,\" he said. \"She got all my savings, and got me a  good thrashing besides.\"    Then the coachman grew bold. \"Did she?\" he said. \"That was nothing to  what she served me.\" So he up and told all about the wet clothes and the  awful job he had had the livelong night. Now the butler on the steps  swelled with rage until he nearly burst, and at last he out with his  night of banging shutters.    \"And one,\" he said, \"hit me on the nose.\"    This settled the three men, and they agreed to tell their master the  moment he came out, and get the girl sent about her business. Now the  laundry-maid had sharp ears and had paused behind a door to listen; so  when she heard this she knew she must do something to stop it. So she  out with her three feathers and said, \"By virtue of the three feathers  from over my true love's heart may there be striving as to who suffered  most between the men so that they get into the pond for a ducking.\"    Well! no sooner had she said the words than the three men began  disputing as to which of them had been served the worst; then James up  and hit the stout butler, giving him a black eye, and the fat butler  fell upon James and pommelled him hard, while the coachman scrambled  from his box and belaboured them both, and the laundry-maid stood by  laughing.    So out comes the master, but none of them would listen, and each wanted  to be heard, and fought, and shoved, and pommelled away until they  shoved each other into the pond, and all got a fine ducking.    Then the master asked the girl what it was all about, and she said:    \"They all wanted to tell a story against me because I won't marry them,  and one said his was the best, and the next said his was the best, so  they fell a-quarrelling as to which was the likeliest story to get me  into trouble. But they are well punished, so there is no need to do  more.\"    Then the master went to his wife and said, \"You are right. That  laundry-maid of yours is a very wise girl.\"    So the butler and the coachman and James had nothing to do but look  sheepish and hold their tongues, and the laundry-maid went on with her  duties without further trouble.    Then when the seven years and a day were over, who should drive up to  the door in a fine gilded coach but the bird-husband restored to his  shape as a handsome young man. And he carried the laundry-maid off to be  his wife again, and her master and mistress were so pleased at her good  fortune that they ordered all the other servants to stand on the steps  and give her good luck. So as she passed the butler she put a bag with  seventy pounds in it into his hand and said sweetly, \"That is to  recompense you for shutting the shutters.\"    And when she passed the coachman she put a bag with forty pounds into  his hand and said, \"That is your reward for bringing in the clothes.\"  But when she passed the footman she gave him a bag with a hundred pounds  in it, and laughed, saying, \"That is for the drop of brandy you never  brought me!\"    So she drove off with her handsome husband, and lived happy ever after.          LAZY JACK      Once upon a time there was a boy whose name was Jack, and he lived with  his mother on a common. They were very poor, and the old woman got her  living by spinning, but Jack was so lazy that he would do nothing but  bask in the sun in the hot weather, and sit by the corner of the hearth  in the winter-time. So they called him Lazy Jack. His mother could not  get him to do anything for her, and at last told him, one Monday, that  if he did not begin to work for his porridge she would turn him out to  get his living as he could.    This roused Jack, and he went out and hired himself for the next day to  a neighbouring farmer for a penny; but as he was coming home, never  having had any money before, he lost it in passing over a brook.    \"You stupid boy,\" said his mother, \"you should have put it in your  pocket.\"    \"I'll do so another time,\" replied Jack.    Well, the next day, Jack went out again and hired himself to a  cowkeeper, who gave him a jar of milk for his day's work. Jack took the  jar and put it into the large pocket of his jacket, spilling it all,  long before he got home.    \"Dear me!\" said the old woman; \"you should have carried it on your  head.\"    \"I'll do so another time,\" said Jack.    So the following day, Jack hired himself again to a farmer, who agreed  to give him a cream cheese for his services. In the evening Jack took  the cheese, and went home with it on his head. By the time he got home  the cheese was all spoilt, part of it being lost, and part matted with  his hair.    \"You stupid lout,\" said his mother, \"you should have carried it very  carefully in your hands.\"    \"I'll do so another time,\" replied Jack.    Now the next day, Lazy Jack again went out, and hired himself to a  baker, who would give him nothing for his work but a large tom-cat. Jack  took the cat, and began carrying it very carefully in his hands, but in  a short time pussy scratched him so much that he was compelled to let it  go.    When he got home, his mother said to him, \"You silly fellow, you should  have tied it with a string, and dragged it along after you.\"    \"I'll do so another time,\" said Jack.    So on the following day, Jack hired himself to a butcher, who rewarded  him by the handsome present of a shoulder of mutton. Jack took the  mutton, tied it with a string, and trailed it along after him in the  dirt, so that by the time he had got home the meat was completely  spoilt. His mother was this time quite out of patience with him, for the  next day was Sunday, and she was obliged to do with cabbage for her  dinner.    [Illustration: Jack found it hard to hoist the donkey on his shoulders]    \"You ninney-hammer,\" said she to her son, \"you should have carried it on  your shoulder.\"    \"I'll do so another time,\" replied Jack.    Well, on the Monday, Lazy Jack went once more and hired himself to a  cattle-keeper, who gave him a donkey for his trouble. Now though Jack  was strong he found it hard to hoist the donkey on his shoulders, but at  last he did it, and began walking home slowly with his prize. Now it so  happened that in the course of his journey he passed a house where a  rich man lived with his only daughter, a beautiful girl, who was deaf  and dumb. And she had never laughed in her life, and the doctors said  she would never speak till somebody made her laugh. So the father had  given out that any man who made her laugh would receive her hand in  marriage. Now this young lady happened to be looking out of the window  when Jack was passing by with the donkey on his shoulders; and the poor  beast with its legs sticking up in the air was kicking violently and  heehawing with all its might. Well, the sight was so comical that she  burst out into a great fit of laughter, and immediately recovered her  speech and hearing. Her father was overjoyed, and fulfilled his promise  by marrying her to Lazy Jack, who was thus made a rich gentleman. They  lived in a large house, and Jack's mother lived with them in great  happiness until she died.          [Illustration: The giant Cormoran was the terror of all the country-side]    JACK THE GIANT-KILLER      I    When good King Arthur reigned with Guinevere his Queen, there lived,  near the Land's End in Cornwall, a farmer who had one only son called  Jack. Now Jack was brisk and ready; of such a lively wit that none nor  nothing could worst him.    In those days, the Mount of St. Michael in Cornwall was the fastness of  a hugeous giant whose name was Cormoran.    He was full eighteen feet in height, some three yards about his middle,  of a grim fierce face, and he was the terror of all the country-side. He  lived in a cave amidst the rocky Mount, and when he desired victuals he  would wade across the tides to the mainland and furnish himself forth  with all that came in his way. The poor folk and the rich folk alike ran  out of their houses and hid themselves when they heard the swish-swash  of his big feet in the water; for if he saw them, he would think nothing  of broiling half-a-dozen or so of them for breakfast. As it was, he  seized their cattle by the score, carrying off half-a-dozen fat oxen on  his back at a time, and hanging sheep and pigs to his waistbelt like  bunches of dip-candles. Now this had gone on for long years, and the  poor folk of Cornwall were in despair, for none could put an end to the  giant Cormoran.    It so happened that one "]]]
