He has discovered your absence and in his  righteous anger will punish you severely.\"    \"Lead me to him,\" replied the Hoopoe. \"I know that he will forgive me  when he hears where I have been and what I have to tell him.\"    The Eagle led him to the King, who with a wrathful face was sitting on  his throne. The Hoopoe trembled and drooped his feathers humbly, but  when Solomon would have crushed him in his mighty fist the bird cried,--    \"Remember, King, that one day you also must give an account of your  sins. Let me not therefore be condemned unheard.\"    \"And if I hear you, what excuse can you have to offer?\" answered  Solomon, frowning. But this was his favorite bird and he hoped that  there might be some reason for sparing him.    \"Well,\" said the Hoopoe, \"at Mecca I met a Hoopoe of my acquaintance who  told me so wonderful a tale of the marvelous Kingdom of Sheba in Arabia  that I could not resist the temptation to visit that country of gold and  precious stones. And there, indeed, I saw the most prodigious treasures;  but best of all, O King, more glorious than gold, more precious than  rare jewels, I saw Queen Balkis, the most beautiful of queens.\"    \"Tell me of this Queen,\" said Solomon, loosening his rough grasp upon  the Hoopoe. So it was, say the Mussulmans, that a bird told Solomon of  the great Queen whose journey to Jerusalem is described in the Bible.    The Hoopoe told of her power and glory, her riches, her wisdom, and her  beauty, until Solomon sighed a great sigh and said, \"It seems too good  to be true! But we shall see.\"    So the King wrote a letter to Balkis, bidding her follow the guidance of  fate and come to the court of the wise King. This note he sealed with  musk, stamped with his great signet, and gave to the Hoopoe, saying,--    \"If now you have spoken truth, take this letter to Queen Balkis; then  come away.\"    The Hoopoe did as he was bid, darting off towards the south like an  arrow. And the next day he came to the palace of the Queen of Sheba,  where she sat in all her splendor among her counselors. He hopped into  the hall and dropped the letter into her lap, then flew away.    Queen Balkis stared and stared at the great King's seal upon the  mysterious letter, and when she had read the brief invitation she stared  and stared again. But she had heard the fame of Solomon and was eager to  ask him some of her clever questions to prove his wisdom. So she decided  to accept his invitation and come to Jerusalem.    She came with a great train of attendants, with camels that bore spices  and treasures of gold and precious stones, gifts for the most wise King.  And she asked him more questions than any woman had ever asked him  before, though he knew a great many ladies, and they were all  inquisitive.    But Solomon was so wise that he answered all her questions without any  trouble.    And she said to him, \"It was a true report that I heard of you in my own  land, of your wisdom and of your glory. Only that which now I know and  see is greater than what I heard. Happy are thy men and happy are thy  servants who stand continually before thee and hear thy wisdom.\"    And she gave the King a hundred and twenty talents of gold, which was a  very rich treasure, besides great store of spices, and the most precious  gifts; no one had ever seen such gifts as the Queen of Sheba gave to  Solomon.    But he in turn was even more generous. For he gave to the fair Balkis  all that she desired and everything she asked, because he admired so  much this splendid Queen of whom the Hoopoe had first told him.    And so, the Bible says, the Queen of Sheba turned and went to her own  country, she and her servants. But the Mussulmans' tales say that in  later days she married Solomon and they lived happily ever after. And it  was all the work of that little Hoopoe with a yellow crown, whom after  that we may be sure Solomon loved better than ever.          THE PIOUS ROBIN          \"Art thou the bird whom man loves best,      The pious bird with the scarlet breast,           Our little English Robin?\"                                        WORDSWORTH.    The English Robin is not precisely like our little American friend whom  we call by that name, although, as the lines of poetry quoted above will  show, in two ways he is the same as ours: he has a red breast, and he is  the bird whom every one loves. Of all the little brothers of the air, in  every land and clime, the pretty, jolly, neighborly Robin Redbreast is  the favorite.    There are many stories about him: some which tell how he came by his  scarlet breast, others which explain why he has always been best beloved  of the birds. I have already told how he helped the Wren to bring fire  to men. Every one knows how tenderly he covered with leaves the poor  Babes in the Wood, when they had been deserted even by their nearest of  kin. Some have heard about Saint Kentigern, and how he restored to life  the pious Robin of his master Servan,--the dear little bird who used to  sing psalms every morning in the Saint's company. Some also know about  the Robin who brought the wheat-ear in his bill to the poor brothers in  Brittany who had no grain to plant for their future harvest. All these  tales show the Robin's generous heart, cheerful nature, and pious  devotion, which make him beloved by men. But perhaps you do not know why  he is called God's own bird.        \"The Robin and the Wren      Are God's cock and hen,\"    sing the little English children, and they think it is very wicked to  injure one of the holy birds or make her unhappy by robbing her nest of  its pretty eggs.    This is why the Robin is called the good bird, God's bird. The oldest  stories say that the little Christ-child used to feed most tenderly the  Robins who hopped about the door of His mother's house, for they were  dearest of all to His baby heart. Perhaps He thus early learned to love  them because His mother had told Him of the service which the dear  little birds had once performed for her.    For it is said that once upon a time, when Mary was a little girl, as  she was going along the gusty road a bit of straw blew into her eye and  pained her terribly. She sat down upon a stone and began to cry. Now a  Robin was sitting on a branch close by, singing with all the power of  his little throat when the maiden passed, for she was very sweet to see  and the Robin loved her looks. But when he saw the blessed Mary begin to  cry and rub her eye with her chubby hand, he stopped his gay song and  became very sad, wondering what he could do to help her.    What he did was to fly away and tell his friend the Swallow all about  it, asking her aid. After that he fluttered to a little fountain which  bubbled up close by and brought thence in his bill a drop of water.  Then, perching on Mary's forehead, he gently dropped this into the  suffering eye. At the same time the Swallow softly brushed her long  tail-feathers under the maiden's eyelid, and the hateful straw was wiped  away. Thus the little Mary was relieved, and when once more she could  look up happily with her pretty eyes she smiled upon the two kind birds  and blessed them for their aid.    Of course, if the little Christ heard His mother tell this pretty story  He would have been sure to love the Robin, just as she did. And so these  little birds became His boyhood friends.    Those were happy times. But in the after years, in the dreadful day  when the Saviour was so cruelly done to death by His enemies, the little  Robin once more proved his generous and pious heart, so the legends say.    The Saviour hung upon the cross, suffering and sad, while the world was  veiled with darkness and all good creatures mourned. Two birds perched  upon the cross beside His weary, drooping head. One was the faithful  Robin, who was then a plain and dark-colored bird with the scorched  feathers of a fire-bringer upon his breast. The other was the Magpie,  who at that time was among the most gorgeous and beautiful of all the  birds. She had a tuft of bright feathers on her head, and her plumage  outshone even that of the Peacock, who has the hundred gleaming eyes of  Argus set in his fan-like tail. But the Magpie, in spite of her beauty,  was at heart a wicked bird. Think of it! She mocked the dying Saviour in  His agony and seemed to rejoice in His suffering!    But the Robin fluttered about the holy figure, timidly uttering chirps  of sorrow and longing to help the Master who had fed him tenderly for so  many years. With his soft wings he wiped away the tears which flowed  from the Lord's eyes, while with his beak he tugged at the cruel thorns  which pierced His brow, trying to relieve Him.    Suddenly a drop of blood fell from Christ's forehead upon the Robin's  breast and tinged with bright crimson the rusty reddish feathers.    \"Blessed be thou,\" said the Lord, \"thou sharer of my suffering. Wherever  thou goest happiness and joy shall follow thee. Blue as the heaven shall  be thy eggs, and from henceforth thou shalt be the Bird of God, the  bearer of good tidings. But thou,\" He added, addressing the Magpie  sorrowfully, \"thou art accursed. No longer shall the brilliant tuft and  bright feathers of which thou art so proud and so unworthy adorn thee.  Thy color shall be the streaked black and white of shadows, thy life a  hard one. And thy nest, however well builded, shall be open to the  storm.\"    These were almost the last words which the Saviour spoke. After that,  when the Lord was laid in the sepulchre, the faithful Robin still  watched beside Him for those three dread days until He rose on Easter  morning, when the little bird rejoiced with all nature at the wondrous  happening. And again on Ascension Day he paid his last tribute to the  risen Master, joining his little song with the chorus of the angels  themselves in the gladdest Hosanna which the universe had ever heard.    This explains how"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16145"],[0,"Journals of Two Expeditions of Discovery in North-West and Western Australia, (#10)"],[1,"of natives  about, and the whole of this valley was an extensive warran ground in  which they had that very morning been digging for their favourite root.    At length, just as my patience began to wear out, we ascended, out of a  dry watercourse, a rise rather more elevated than the others we had met  with in crossing the valley; and from the summit of this a curious sight  met our view: beneath us lay the dry bed of a large river, its depth at  this point being between forty and fifty feet, and its breadth upwards of  three hundred yards; it was at times subject to terrific inundations; for  along its banks lay the trunks of immense trees, giants of the forest  which had been washed down from the interior in the season of the floods;  yet nothing now met our craving eyes but a vast sandy channel which  scorched our eyeballs as the rays of the sun were reflected back from its  white glistening bed.    WATER FOUND IN IT BY DIGGING.    I picked out the most shady spot I could for the men to halt at, then  descended into the bed of the river to search, with the native, for  water; and immediately on scraping a hole a few inches deep in the bed of  the river the water came streaming into it, for the sand composing the  bottom of the watercourse was completely saturated, and I afterwards  found that there were large pools of it immediately above and below where  we were.    The wants of the men having been thus supplied I determined, as it was  intensely hot, to halt for an hour or two; we each of us therefore ate a  little doughboy, or piece of damper, and the men then lay down to rest.  As I sat musing alone the first thought that struck me was how  providentially it happened that we had not fallen in with this river in  the season of the floods, as our crossing it then would have been utterly  impossible.    APPROACH OF NATIVES TO THE RIVER.    But my reveries were soon disturbed by hearing the call of a native from  the opposite bank, and I roused up poor Kaiber from his sleep that he  might ascertain what was going on upon the other side. His quick eyes  soon detected natives moving about amongst the bushes; but on farther  examination he ascertained that there was only one man, who walked as if  he had been wounded, the rest of the party being made up of women and  children, who were digging for roots. They were quite unconscious of our  presence, and we lay snugly behind a bush, watching all their movements.  As soon as they had dug a sufficient quantity of roots for their purpose  they descended to the bed of the river and walked up to a pool about one  hundred yards above our position, where they all drank and then sat down  to cook their roots. I ordered the men to keep themselves as quiet as  possible so that we in no way disturbed these poor creatures; and when at  length the party moved off we passed them in a diagonal direction so as  to give them an opportunity of seeing us without frightening them. When  first we emerged into view they began to run away; but when they saw that  we still moved steadily on without noticing them they were no longer  alarmed, but stood still, gazing at us with the greatest wonder and  amazement; the youngest children standing behind their mothers, peeping  cautiously out at us; and many a strange thought must have passed through  the breasts of these natives as they saw us wind in regular order up the  opposite hill. This tribe was the most northern one that I had seen wear  the kangaroo-skin cloak.    Another mile and a half in a south by east direction brought us to a low  range to the south of this river, which I named the Arrowsmith River  after Mr. John Arrowsmith, the distinguished geographer. From this range  we had a fine view of the rich valleys drained by this important stream.    MOUNT HORNER.    These valleys ran nearly north and south between the interior range and  the sandy limestone range parallel to the coast on which we now were; but  the river must also, of course, from its magnitude, penetrate the  interior range, which was only distant about sixteen miles from us. A  very remarkable peak in the latter, which bore east-north-east from this  point, I named Mount Horner, after my friend Leonard Horner, Esquire.    It appears from the report of the party who came along the coast that  this river loses itself in a large lake, between which and the sea a  great bar of dry sand intervenes in the dry season; there is however a  very fair proportion of good country in the neighbourhood of the  Arrowsmith.    In the course of the evening we travelled six and a half miles further in  a south-south-east direction, over barren, sandy, scrubby plains, which  extended on all sides as far as the eye could see, and even the interior  range appeared to be perfectly bare. Towards nightfall we were all quite  worn out from the difficulty we had experienced in walking through the  prickly scrub, yet I could see no place that afforded sufficient wood to  enable us to make a fire and, as most of us had no covering with us, and  the nights were intensely cold, we had every prospect of passing a most  wretched one; but at length I spied two clumps of Banksia trees, the  nearest of which we just reached as it became quite dark. The other clump  was about a quarter of a mile to the eastward of us, at which I soon  distinguished native fires; as the men were however much exhausted I  thought it better not to mention this circumstance to them, and Kaiber  and myself, who always slept at a little fire alone, kept a good look out  during the night.    This evening we found the Bohn or Boh-rne, a native esculent root, and it  is the most northern point at which I have met with it.*    (*Footnote. A small red root somewhat resembling in flavour a mild  onion.)    April 12.    Before dawn this morning our native neighbours, who doubtless were not  pleased at our sleeping so near them, began to cooee to each other, which  is their usual signal for collecting their forces; and, as our safety  depended upon none of the party being incapacitated by a wound or other  cause from proceeding with the utmost rapidity, I at once roused the men  and we resumed our way.    CONTINUE OUR ROUTE.    In the course of the day we made a march of twenty-five miles in a  south-south-east direction, the whole of this distance being across  elevated undulating sandy plains, covered with a thick prickly scrub,  about two and a half feet high; these plains were however occasionally  studded with a few Banksia trees, but anything more dark, cheerless, and  barren than their general appearance can scarcely be conceived.    About half an hour before sunset we came to the bed of a dry watercourse,  the direction of which was from south-east to north, so that it was  probably a tributary of the Arrowsmith. We were fortunate enough to find  a small pool of water in it, yet the large flights of birds of every  description that came here for the purpose of drinking showed the rarity  of water in these parts. We made several attempts to get a shot at them  but they were so wild, and we were so worn out and weak, that all our  exertions were unsuccessful. In the course of the evening one of the men  made up my last pound of flour into a damper for me, and I supped on a  spoonful of arrowroot.    SERIOUS ROBBBRY BY A RAT.    April 13.    On waking up this morning I found that in the night a rat had gnawed a  hole in the canvas bag in which my little damper was placed, and had  eaten more than half of it; this was a very serious misfortune as all my  provisions were now reduced to three table-spoonfuls of arrowroot and the  morsel of damper left me by the rat. As I had shared my provisions with  the native my situation was far worse than that of any of the others, and  he, poor fellow, had become so dispirited and weak that he was incapable  of searching for his food. Indeed the productions of the country through  which he had hitherto passed were so different from those of the one in  which he had lived that the various kinds of roots and vegetables were,  with one or two exceptions, quite unknown to him.    We made a very good march of it this morning, having travelled nineteen  miles in a nearly south direction before 12 o'clock. Soon after starting  we sighted Mount Perron, distant about two and twenty miles and, seen  over the waste and barren plains which surrounded us, it was a very  remarkable object.    We halted at noon for about two hours, during which time I made my  breakfast with Kaiber, sharing my remaining portion of damper between us.  It was almost a satisfaction to me when it was gone, for, tormented by  the pangs of hunger, as I had now been for many days, I found that nearly  the whole of my time was passed in struggling with myself as to whether I  should eat at once all the provisions I had left or refrain till a future  hour. Having completed this last morsel I occupied myself for a little  with my journal, then read a few chapters in the New Testament and,  having fulfilled these duties, I felt myself as contented and cheerful as  I had ever been in the most fortunate moments of my life.    GAIRDNER'S RANGE.    Soon after two P.M. we resumed our journey, travelling for about eight  miles in a due south direction over plains similar to those we had passed  yesterday and this morning, and then began to ascend a red sandstone  range of the same description as the Perth ironstone and thinly studded  with black bay trees. I named this range Gairdner's Range after my friend  Gordon Gairdner, Esquire, of the Colonial Office and, after continuing a  gradual ascent for about four miles, I found that we were in the  neighbourhood of a forest, at the outskirts of which I chose a spot for  our halting-place, which afforded plenty of firewood but was deficient in  water. As we had now however marched thirty-one miles without seeing  water, and were all perfectly worn out, I judged it more prudent"]]]
