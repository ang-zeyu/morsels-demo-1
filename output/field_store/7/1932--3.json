Not long atter dat, Daddy bid for de  contract to carry de mail and he got de place, but it made de white  folkses mighty mad, 'cause some white folkses had put in bids for dat  contract. Dey 'lowed dat Daddy better not never start out wid dat mail,  'cause if he did he was gwine to be sorry. Marster begged Daddy not to  risk it and told him if he would stay dar wid him he would let him have  a plantation for as long as he lived, and so us stayed on dar 'til Daddy  died, and a long time atter dat us kept on wukin' for Old Marster.    \"White folkses owned us back in de days 'fore de war but our own white  folkses was mighty good to deir slaves. Dey had to larn us 'bedience  fust, how to live right, and how to treat evvybody else right; but de  best thing dey larned us was how to do useful wuk. De onliest time I  'member stealin' anything 'cept Aunt Tama's gingerbread was one time  when I went to town wid Daddy in de buggy. When us started back home a  man got in de seat wid Daddy and I had to ride down in de back of de  buggy whar Daddy had hid a jug of liquor. I could hear it slushin'  'round and so I got to wantin' to know how it tasted. I pulled out de  corncob stopper and tuk one taste. It was so good I jus' kep' on tastin'  'til I passed out, and didn't know when us got home or nuffin else 'til  I waked up in my own bed next day. Daddy give me a tannin' what I didn't  forgit for a long time, but dat was de wussest drunk I ever was. Lord,  but I did love to follow my Daddy.    \"Folkses warn't sick much in dem days lak dey is now, but now us don't  eat strong victuals no more. Us raked out hot ashes den and cooked good  old ashcakes what was a heap better for us dan dis bread us buys from de  stores now. Marster fed us plenty ashcake, fresh meat, and ash roasted  'taters, and dere warn't nobody what could out wuk us.    \"A death was somepin what didn't happen often on our plantation, but  when somebody did die folkses would go from miles and miles around to  set up and pray all night to comfort de fambly of de daid. Dey never  made up de coffins 'til atter somebody died. Den dey measured de corpse  and made de coffin to fit de body. Dem coffins was lined wid black  calico and painted wid lampblack on de outside. Sometimes dey kivvered  de outside wid black calico lak de linin'. Coffins for white folkses was  jus' lak what dey had made up for deir slaves, and dey was all buried in  de same graveyard on deir own plantations.    \"When de war was over dey closed de little one-room school what our good  Marster had kept in his back yard for his slaves, but out young Miss  Ellen larnt my sister right on 'til she got whar she could teach school.  Daddy fixed up a room onto our house for her school and she soon had it  full of chillun. Dey made me study too, and I sho did hate to have to go  to school to my own aister for she evermore did take evvy chance to lay  dat stick on me, but I s'pects she had a right tough time wid me. When  time come 'round to celebrate school commencement, I was one proud  little Nigger 'cause I never had been so dressed up in my life before.  I had on a red waist, white pants, and a good pair of shoes; but de  grandest thing of all 'bout dat outfit was dat Daddy let me wear his  watch. Evvybody come for dat celebration. Dere was over 300 folks at dat  big dinner, and us had lots of barbecue and all sorts of good things  t'eat. Old Marster was dar, and when I stood up 'fore all dem folks and  said my little speech widout missin' a word, Marster sho did laugh and  clap his hands. He called me over to whar he was settin' and said: 'I  knowed you could larn if you wanted to.' _Best of all, he give me a  whole dollar._ [TR: 'for reciting a speech' written in margin.] I was  rich den, plumb rich. One of my sisters couldn't larn nothin'. De only  letters she could ever say was 'G-O-D.' No matter what you axed her to  spell she allus said 'G-O-D.' She was a good field hand though and a  good 'oman and she lived to be more dan 90 years old.    \"Now, talkin' 'bout frolickin', us really used to dance. What I means,  is sho 'nough old-time break-downs. Sometimes us didn't have no music  'cept jus' beatin' time on tin pans and buckets but most times Old Elice  Hudson played his fiddle for us, and it had to be tuned again atter evvy  set us danced. He never knowed but one tune and he played dat over and  over. Sometimes dere was 10 or 15 couples on de floor at de same time  and us didn't think nothin' of dancin' all night long. Us had plenty of  old corn juice for refreshment, and atter Elice had two or three cups of  dat juice, he could git 'Turkey in de Straw' out of dat fiddle lak  nobody's business.    \"One time a houseboy from another plantation wanted to come to one of  our Saddy night dances, so his marster told him to shine his boots for  Sunday and fix his hoss for de night and den he could git off for de  frolic. Abraham shined his marster's boots 'till he could see hisself in  'em, and dey looked so grand he was tempted to try 'em on. Dey was a  little tight but he thought he could wear 'em, and he wanted to show  hisself off in 'em at de dance. Dey warn't so easy to walk in and he was  'fraid he might git 'em scratched up walkin' through de fields, so he  snuck his Marster's hoss out and rode to de dance. When Abraham rid up  dar in dem shiny boots, he got all de gals' 'tention. None of 'em wanted  to dance wid de other Niggers. Dat Abraham was sho sruttin' 'til  somebody run in and told him his hoss had done broke its neck. He had  tied it to a limb and sho 'nough, some way, dat hoss had done got  tangled up and hung its own self. Abraham begged de other Nigger boys to  help him take de deid hoss home, but he had done tuk deir gals and he  didn't git no help. He had to walk 12 long miles home in dem tight  shoes. De sun had done riz up when he got dar and it warn't long 'fore  his Marster was callin': 'Abraham, bring, me my boots.' Dat Nigger would  holler out: 'Yas sah! I'se a-comin'. But dem boots wouldn't come off  'cause his foots had done swelled up in 'em. His marster kept on callin'  and when Abraham seed he couldn't put it off no longer, he jus' cut dem  boots off his foots and went in and told what he had done. His marster  was awful mad and said he was a good mind to take de hide off Abraham's  back. 'Go git my hoss quick, Nigger, 'fore I most kills you,' he yelled.  Den Abraham told him: 'Marster I knows you is gwine to kill me now, but  your hoss is done daid.' Den pore Abraham had to out and tell de whole  story and his marster got to laughin' so 'bout how he tuk all de gals  away from de other boys and how dem boots hurt him dat it looked lak he  never would stop. When he finally did stop laughin' and shakin' his  sides he said: 'Dat's all right Abraham. Don't never let nobody beat  your time wid de gals.' And dat's all he ever said to Abraham 'bout it.    \"When my sister got married, us sho did have a grand time. Us cooked a  pig whole wid a shiny red apple in its mouth and set it right in de  middle of de long table what us had built out in de yard. Us had  evvything good to go wid dat pig, and atter dat supper, us danced all  night long. My sister never had seed dat man but one time 'fore she  married him.    \"My Daddy and his cousin Jim swore wid one another dat if one died 'fore  de other dat de one what was left would look atter de daid one's fambly  and see dat none of de chillun was bound out to wuk for nobody. It  warn't long atter dis dat Daddy died. I was jus' fourteen, and was  wukin' for a brick mason larnin' dat trade. Daddy had done been sick a  while, and one night de fambly woke me up and said he was dyin'. I run  fast as I could for a doctor but Daddy was done daid when I got back. Us  buried him right side of Mammy in de old graveyard. It was most a year  atter dat 'fore us had de funeral sermon preached. Dat was de way  folkses done den. Now Mammy and Daddy was both gone, but old Marster  said us chillun could live dar long as us wanted to. I went on back to  wuk, 'cause I was crazy to be as good a mason as my Daddy was. In  Lexin'ton dere is a rock wall still standin' 'round a whole square what  Daddy built in slavery time. Long as he lived he blowed his bugle evvy  mornin' to wake up all de folkses on Marse Frank's plantation. He never  failed to blow dat bugle at break of day 'cep on Sundays, and evvybody  on dat place 'pended on him to wake 'em up.    \"I was jus' a-wukin' away one day when Cousin Jim sent for me to go to  town wid him. Missy, dat man brung ne right here to Athens to de old  courthouse and bound me out to a white man. He done dat very thing atter  swearin' to my Daddy he wouldn't never let dat happen. I didn't want to  wuk dat way, so I run away and went back home to wuk. De sheriff come  and got me and said I had to go back whar I was bound out or go to jail.  Pretty soon I runned away again and went to Atlanta, and dey never  bothered me 'bout dat no more.    \"De onliest time I ever got 'rested was once when I come to town to see  'bout gittin' somebody to pick cotton for me and jus' as I got to a  certain Nigger's house de police come in and caught 'em in a crap game.  Mr. McCune, de policeman, said I would have to go 'long wid de others to  jail, but he would help me atter us got der and he did. He 'ranged it so  I could hurry back home.    \"'Bout de best times us had in de plantation days was de corn shuckin's,  log rollin's and syrup cookin's. Us allus finished up dem syrup cookin's  wid a candy pullin'.    \"Atter he had all his corn gathered and put in big long piles, Marster  'vited de folkses from all 'round dem parts. Dat was de way it was done;  evvybody holped de others git de corn shucked. Nobody thought of hirin'  folkses and payin' out cash money for extra wuk lak dat.

The poet feigns himself present, in  slumber, at the Royal birth-day; and supposes that he addresses his  majesty, on his household matters as well as the affairs of the  nation. Some of the princes, it has been satirically hinted, behaved  afterwards in such a way as if they wished that the scripture of the  Burns should be fulfilled: in this strain, he has imitated the license  and equalled the wit of some of the elder Scottish Poets.    \"The Vision\" is wholly serious; it exhibits the poet in one of those  fits of despondency which the dull, who have no misgivings, never  know: he dwells with sarcastic bitterness on the opportunities which,  for the sake of song, he has neglected of becoming wealthy, and is  drawing a sad parallel between rags and riches, when the muse steps in  and cheer his despondency, by assuring him of undying fame.  \"Halloween\" is a strain of a more homely kind, recording the  superstitious beliefs, and no less superstitious doings of Old  Scotland, on that night, when witches and elves and evil spirits are  let loose among the children of men: it reaches far back into manners  and customs, and is a picture, curious and valuable. The tastes and  feelings of husbandmen inspired \"The old Farmer's Address to his old  mare Maggie,\" which exhibits some pleasing recollections of his days  of courtship and hours of sociality. The calm, tranquil picture of  household happiness and devotion in \"the Cotter's Saturday Night,\" has  induced Hogg, among others, to believe that it has less than usual of  the spirit of the poet, but it has all the spirit that was required;  the toil of the week has ceased, the labourer has returned to his  well-ordered home--his \"cozie ingle and his clean hearth-stane,\"--and  with his wife and children beside him, turns his thoughts to the  praise of that God to whom he owes all: this he performs with a  reverence and an awe, at once natural, national, and poetic. \"The  Mouse\" is a brief and happy and very moving poem: happy, for it  delineates, with wonderful truth and life, the agitation of the mouse  when the coulter broke into its abode; and moving, for the poet takes  the lesson of ruin to himself, and feels the present and dreads the  future. \"The Mountain Daisy,\" once, more properly, called by Burns  \"The Gowan,\" resembles \"The Mouse\" in incident and in moral, and is  equally happy, in language and conception. \"The Lament\" is a dark, and  all but tragic page, from the poet's own life. \"Man was made to  Mourn'\" takes the part of the humble and the homeless, against the  coldness and selfishness of the wealthy and the powerful, a favourite  topic of meditation with Burns. He refrained, for awhile, from making  \"Death and Doctor Hernbook\" public; a poem which deviates from the  offensiveness of personal satire, into a strain of humour, at once  airy and original.    His epistles in verse may be reckoned amongst his happiest  productions: they are written in all moods of mind, and are, by turns,  lively and sad; careless and serious;--now giving advice, then taking  it; laughing at learning, and lamenting its want; scoffing at  propriety and wealth, yet admitting, that without the one he cannot be  wise, nor wanting the other, independent. The Epistle to David Sillar  is the first of these compositions: the poet has no news to tell, and  no serious question to ask: he has only to communicate his own  emotions of joy, or of sorrow, and these he relates and discusses with  singular elegance as well as ease, twining, at the same time, into the  fabric of his composition, agreeable allusions to the taste and  affections of his correspondent. He seems to have rated the intellect  of Sillar as the highest among his rustic friends: he pays him more  deference, and addresses him in a higher vein than he observes to  others. The Epistles to Lapraik, to Smith, and to Rankine, are in a  more familiar, or social mood, and lift the veil from the darkness of  the poet's condition, and exhibit a mind of first-rate power, groping,  and that surely, its way to distinction, in spite of humility of  birth, obscurity of condition, and the coldness of the wealthy or the  titled. The epistles of other poets owe some of their fame to the rank  or the reputation of those to whom they are addressed; those of Burns  are written, one and all, to nameless and undistinguished men. Sillar  was a country schoolmaster, Lapraik a moorland laird, Smith a small  shop-keeper, and Rankine a farmer, who loved a gill and a joke. Yet  these men were the chief friends, the only literary associates of the  poet, during those early years, in which, with some exceptions, his  finest works were written.    Burns, while he was writing the poems, the chief of which we have  named, was a labouring husbandman on the little farm of Mossgiel, a  pursuit which affords but few leisure hours for either reading or  pondering; but to him the stubble-field was musing-ground, and the  walk behind the plough, a twilight saunter on Parnassus. As, with a  careful hand and a steady eye, he guided his horses, and saw an evenly  furrow turned up by the share, his thoughts were on other themes; he  was straying in haunted glens, when spirits have power--looking in  fancy on the lasses \"skelping barefoot,\" in silks and in scarlets, to  a field-preaching--walking in imagination with the rosy widow, who on  Halloween ventured to dip her left sleeve in the burn, where three  lairds' lands met--making the \"bottle clunk,\" with joyous smugglers,  on a lucky run of gin or brandy--or if his thoughts at all approached  his acts--he was moralizing on the daisy oppressed by the furrow which  his own ploughshare had turned. That his thoughts were thus wandering  we have his own testimony, with that of his brother Gilbert; and were  both wanting, the certainty that he composed the greater part of his  immortal poems in two years, from the summer of 1784 to the summer of  1786, would be evidence sufficient. The muse must have been strong  within him, when, in spite of the rains and sleets of the  \"ever-dropping west\"--when in defiance of the hot and sweaty brows  occasioned by reaping and thrashing--declining markets, and showery  harvests--the clamour of his laird for his rent, and the tradesman for  his account, he persevered in song, and sought solace in verse, when  all other solace was denied him.    The circumstances under which his principal poems were composed, have  been related: the \"Lament of Mailie\" found its origin in the  catastrophe of a pet ewe; the \"Epistle to Sillar\" was confided by the  poet to his brother while they were engaged in weeding the kale-yard;  the \"Address to the Deil\" was suggested by the many strange portraits  which belief or fear had drawn of Satan, and was repeated by the one  brother to the other, on the way with their carts to the kiln, for  lime; the \"Cotter's Saturday Night\" originated in the reverence with  which the worship of God was conducted in the family of the poet's  father, and in the solemn tone with which he desired his children to  compose themselves for praise and prayer; \"the Mouse,\" and its moral  companion \"the Daisy,\" were the offspring of the incidents which they  relate; and \"Death and Doctor Hornbook\" was conceived at a  freemason-meeting, where the hero of the piece had shown too much of  the pedant, and composed on his way home, after midnight, by the poet,  while his head was somewhat dizzy with drink. One of the most  remarkable of his compositions, the \"Jolly Beggars,\" a drama, to which  nothing in the language of either the North or South can be compared,  and which was unknown till after the death of the author, was  suggested by a scene which he saw in a low ale-house, into which, on a  Saturday night, most of the sturdy beggars of the district had met to  sell their meal, pledge their superfluous rags, and drink their gains.  It may be added, that he loved to walk in solitary spots; that his  chief musing-ground was the banks of the Ayr; the season most  congenial to his fancy that of winter, when the winds were heard in  the leafless woods, and the voice of the swollen streams came from  vale and hill; and that he seldom composed a whole poem at once, but  satisfied with a few fervent verses, laid the subject aside, till the  muse summoned him to another exertion of fancy. In a little back  closet, still existing in the farm-house of Mossgiel, he committed  most of his poems to paper.    But while the poet rose, the farmer sank. It was not the cold clayey  bottom of his ground, nor the purchase of unsound seed-corn, not the  fluctuation in the markets alone, which injured him; neither was it  the taste for freemason socialities, nor a desire to join the mirth of  comrades, either of the sea or the shore: neither could it be wholly  imputed to his passionate following of the softer sex--indulgence in  the \"illicit rove,\" or giving way to his eloquence at the feet of one  whom he loved and honoured; other farmers indulged in the one, or  suffered from the other, yet were prosperous. His want of success  arose from other causes; his heart was not with his task, save by fits  and starts: he felt he was designed for higher purposes than  ploughing, and harrowing, and sowing, and reaping: when the sun called  on him, after a shower, to come to the plough, or when the ripe corn  invited the sickle, or the ready market called for the measured grain,  the poet was under other spells, and was slow to avail himself of  those golden moments which come but once in the season. To this may be  added, a too superficial knowledge of the art of farming, and a want  of intimacy with the nature of the soil he was called to cultivate. He  could speak fluently of leas, and faughs, and fallows, of change of  seed and rotation of crops, but practical knowledge and application  were required, and"]]]
