Even more insidious is the pageantry which since the days of King  Tissa has been the outward sign of religion. It may be justified as  being merely an edifying method of venerating the memory of a great  man but when images and relics are treated with profound reverence or  carried in solemn procession it is hard for the ignorant, especially  if they are accustomed to the ceremonial of Hindu temples, not to  think that these symbols are divine. This ornate ritualism is not  authorized in any known canonical text, but it is thoroughly  Indian. Asoka records in his inscriptions the institution of religious  processions and Hsuan Chuang relates how King Harsha organized a  festival during which an image of the Buddha was carried on an  elephant while the monarch and his ally the king of Assam, dressed as  Indra and Brahma respectively, waited on it like servants.[116] Such  festivities were congenial to the Sinhalese, as is attested by the  long series of descriptions which fill the Mahavamsa down to the  very last book, by what Fa-Hsien saw about 412 and by the Perahera  festival celebrated to-day.    6      The Buddhism of southern India resembled that of Ceylon in character  though not in history. It was introduced under the auspices of Asoka,  who mentions in his inscriptions the Colas, Pandyas and  Keralaputras.[117] Hsuan Chuang says that in the Malakuta country,  somewhere near Madura or Tanjore, there was a stupa erected by Asoka's  orders and also a monastery founded by Mahinda. It is possible that  this apostle and others laboured less in Ceylon and more in south  India than is generally supposed. The pre-eminence and continuity of  Sinhalese Buddhism are due to the conservative temper of the natives  who were relatively little moved by the winds of religion which blew  strong on the mainland, bearing with them now Jainism, now the worship  of Vishnu or Siva.    In the Tamil country Buddhism of an Asokan type appears to have been  prevalent about the time of our era. The poem Manimegalei, which by  general consent was composed in an early century A.D., is Buddhist but  shows no leanings to Mahayanism. It speaks of Sivaism and many  other systems[118] as flourishing, but contains no hint that Buddhism  was persecuted. But persecution or at least very unfavourable  conditions set in. Since at the time of Hsuan Chuang's visit Buddhism  was in an advanced stage of decadence, it seems probable that the  triumph of Sivaism began in the third or fourth century and that  Buddhism offered slight resistance, Jainism being the only serious  competitor for the first place. But for a long while, perhaps even  until the sixteenth century, monasteries were kept up in special  centres, and one of these is of peculiar importance, namely Kancipuram  or Conjeveram.[119] Hsuan Chuang found there 100 monasteries with more  than 10,000 brethren, all Sthaviras, and mentions that it was the  birthplace of Dharmapala.[120] We have some further information from  the Talaing chronicles[121] which suggests the interesting hypothesis  that the Buddhism of Burma was introduced or refreshed by missionaries  from southern India. They give a list of teachers who flourished in  that country, including Kaccayana and the philosopher Anuruddha.[122]  Of Dharmapala they say that he lived at the monastery of Bhadratittha  near Kancipura and wrote fourteen commentaries in Pali.[123] One was  on the Visuddhi-magga of Buddhaghosa and it is probable that he lived  shortly after that great writer and like him studied in Ceylon.    I shall recur to this question of south Indian Buddhism in treating  of Burma, but the data now available are very meagre.

Mademoiselle  worked late--far into the night.\"    \"Where did the table with the night-light stand,--far from the bed?\"    \"Some way from the bed.\"    \"Can you light the burner now?\"    \"The lamp is broken and the oil that was in it was spilled when the  table was upset. All the rest of the things in the room remain just as  they were. I have only to open the blinds for you to see.\"    \"Wait.\"    Rouletabille went back into the laboratory, closed the shutters of the  two windows and the door of the vestibule.    When we were in complete darkness, he lit a wax vesta, and asked Daddy  Jacques to move to the middle of the chamber with it to the place where  the night-light was burning that night.    Daddy Jacques who was in his stockings--he usually left his sabots  in the vestibule--entered The Yellow Room with his bit of a vesta. We  vaguely distinguished objects overthrown on the floor, a bed in one  corner, and, in front of us, to the left, the gleam of a looking-glass  hanging on the wall, near to the bed.    \"That will do!--you may now open the blinds,\" said Rouletabille.    \"Don't come any further,\" Daddy Jacques begged, \"you may make marks  with your boots, and nothing must be deranged; it's an idea of the  magistrate's--though he has nothing more to do here.\"    And he pushed open the shutter. The pale daylight entered from without,  throwing a sinister light on the saffron-coloured walls. The floor--for  though the laboratory and the vestibule were tiled, The Yellow Room had  a flooring of wood--was covered with a single yellow mat which was  large enough to cover nearly the whole room, under the bed and under the  dressing-table--the only piece of furniture that remained upright. The  centre round table, the night-table and two chairs had been overturned.  These did not prevent a large stain of blood being visible on the mat,  made, as Daddy Jacques informed us, by the blood which had flowed from  the wound on Mademoiselle Stangerson's forehead. Besides these stains,  drops of blood had fallen in all directions, in line with the visible  traces of the footsteps--large and black--of the murderer. Everything  led to the presumption that these drops of blood had fallen from the  wound of the man who had, for a moment, placed his red hand on the wall.  There were other traces of the same hand on the wall, but much less  distinct.    \"See!--see this blood on the wall!\" I could not help exclaiming.  \"The man who pressed his hand so heavily upon it in the darkness must  certainly have thought that he was pushing at a door! That's why  he pressed on it so hard, leaving on the yellow paper the terrible  evidence. I don't think there are many hands in the world of that sort.  It is big and strong and the fingers are nearly all one as long as the  other! The thumb is wanting and we have only the mark of the palm; but  if we follow the trace of the hand,\" I continued, \"we see that, after  leaving its imprint on the wall, the touch sought the door, found it,  and then felt for the lock--\"    \"No doubt,\" interrupted Rouletabille, chuckling,--\"only there is no  blood, either on the lock or on the bolt!\"    \"What does that prove?\" I rejoined with a good sense of which I was  proud; \"he might have opened the lock with his left hand, which would  have been quite natural, his right hand being wounded.\"    \"He didn't open it at all!\" Daddy Jacques again exclaimed. \"We are not  fools; and there were four of us when we burst open the door!\"    \"What a queer hand!--Look what a queer hand it is!\" I said.    \"It is a very natural hand,\" said Rouletabille, \"of which the shape has  been deformed by its having slipped on the wall. The man dried his hand  on the wall. He must be a man about five feet eight in height.\"    \"How do you come at that?\"    \"By the height of the marks on the wall.\"    My friend next occupied himself with the mark of the bullet in the wall.  It was a round hole.    \"This ball was fired straight, not from above, and consequently, not  from below.\"    Rouletabille went back to the door and carefully examined the lock and  the bolt, satisfying himself that the door had certainly been burst open  from the outside, and, further, that the key had been found in the lock  on the inside of the chamber. He finally satisfied himself that with the  key in the lock, the door could not possibly be opened from without with  another key. Having made sure of all these details, he let fall these  words: \"That's better!\"--Then sitting down on the ground, he hastily  took off his boots and, in his socks, went into the room.    The first thing he did was to examine minutely the overturned furniture.  We watched him in silence.    \"Young fellow, you are giving yourself a great deal of trouble,\" said  Daddy Jacques ironically.    Rouletabille raised his head and said:    \"You have spoken the simple truth, Daddy Jacques; your mistress did not  have her hair in bands that evening. I was a donkey to have believed she  did.\"    Then, with the suppleness of a serpent, he slipped under the bed.  Presently we heard him ask:    \"At what time, Monsieur Jacques, did Monsieur and Mademoiselle  Stangerson arrive at the laboratory?\"    \"At six o'clock.\"    The voice of Rouletabille continued:    \"Yes,--he's been under here,--that's certain; in fact, there was no  where else where he could have hidden himself. Here, too, are the marks  of his hobnails. When you entered--all four of you--did you look under  the bed?\"    \"At once,--we drew it right out of its place--\"    \"And between the mattresses?\"    \"There was only one on the bed, and on that Mademoiselle was placed; and  Monsieur Stangerson and the concierge immediately carried it into the  laboratory. Under the mattress there was nothing but the metal netting,  which could not conceal anything or anybody. Remember, monsieur, that  there were four of us and we couldn't fail to see everything--the  chamber is so small and scantily furnished, and all was locked behind in  the pavilion.\"    I ventured on a hypothesis:    \"Perhaps he got away with the mattress--in the mattress!--Anything  is possible, in the face of such a mystery! In their distress of mind  Monsieur Stangerson and the concierge may not have noticed they were  bearing a double weight; especially if the concierge were an accomplice!  I throw out this hypothesis for what it is worth, but it explains many  things,--and particularly the fact that neither the laboratory nor the  vestibule bear any traces of the footmarks found in the room. If,  in carrying Mademoiselle on the mattress from the laboratory of the  chateau, they rested for a moment, there might have been an opportunity  for the man in it to escape.    \"And then?\" asked Rouletabille, deliberately laughing under the bed.    I felt rather vexed and replied:    \"I don't know,--but anything appears possible\"--    \"The examining magistrate had the same idea, monsieur,\" said Daddy  Jacques, \"and he carefully examined the mattress. He was obliged to  laugh at the idea, monsieur, as your friend is doing now,--for whoever  heard of a mattress having a double bottom?\"    I was myself obliged to laugh, on seeing that what I had said was  absurd; but in an affair like this one hardly knows where an absurdity  begins or ends.    My friend alone seemed able to talk intelligently. He called out from  under the bed.    \"The mat here has been moved out of place,--who did it?\"    \"We did, monsieur,\" explained Daddy Jacques. \"When we could not find  the assassin, we asked ourselves whether there was not some hole in the  floor--\"    \"There is not,\" replied Rouletabille. \"Is there a cellar?\"    \"No, there's no cellar. But that has not stopped our searching, and has  not prevented the examining magistrate and his Registrar from studying  the floor plank by plank, as if there had been a cellar under it.\"    The reporter then reappeared. His eyes were sparkling and his nostrils  quivered. He remained on his hands and knees. He could not be better  likened than to an admirable sporting dog on the scent of some unusual  game. And, indeed, he was scenting the steps of a man,--the man whom he  has sworn to report to his master, the manager of the \"Epoque.\" It must  not be forgotten that Rouletabille was first and last a journalist.    Thus, on his hands and knees, he made his way to the four corners of the  room, so to speak, sniffing and going round everything--everything that  we could see, which was not much, and everything that we could not see,  which must have been infinite.    The toilette table was a simple table standing on four legs; there was  nothing about it by which it could possibly be changed into a temporary  hiding-place. There was not a closet or cupboard. Mademoiselle  Stangerson kept her wardrobe at the chateau.    Rouletabille literally passed his nose and hands along the walls,  constructed of solid brickwork. When he had finished with the walls, and  passed his agile fingers over every portion of the yellow paper covering  them, he reached to the ceiling, which he was able to touch by mounting  on a chair placed on the toilette table, and by moving this ingeniously  constructed stage from place to place he examined every foot of it. When  he had finished his scrutiny of the ceiling, where he carefully examined  the hole made by the second bullet, he approached the window, and, once  more, examined the iron bars and blinds, all of which were solid and  intact. At last, he gave a grunt of satisfaction and declared \"Now I am  at ease!\"    \"Well,--do you believe that the poor dear young lady was shut up when  she was being murdered--when she cried out for help?\" wailed Daddy  Jacques.    \"Yes,\" said the young reporter, drying his forehead, \"The Yellow Room  was as tightly shut as an iron safe.\"    \"That,\" I said, \"is why this mystery is the most surprising I know.  Edgar Allan Poe, in 'The Murders in the Rue Morgue,' invented nothing  like it."]]]
