All their pastures yield      Herds in all plenty. All their roofs are filled                 With rich possessions.        High happiness and wealth attend them,        While, with laws well-ordered, they        Cities of happy households sway;      And their sons exult in the pleasure of youth,      And their daughters dance with the flower-decked girls,      Who play among the flowers of summer!      Such are the honors thy full hands divide;      Mother of Gods and starry Heaven's bride!\"[A]    A buzz of pleasure and a smile ran round the circle, in which the  new-comers joined. They were the soldiers who had been to hear and join  the music at the Carmel-men's post. The tones of Homer's harp had  tempted them to return; and they had brought with them the Hebrew  minstrel, to whom they had been listening. It was the outlaw David, of  Bethlehem Ephrata.    David had listened to Homer more intently than any one; and, as the  pleased applause subsided, the eyes of the circle gathered upon him, and  the manner of all showed that they expected him, in minstrel-fashion, to  take up the same strain.    He accepted the implied invitation, played a short prelude, and taking  Homer's suggestion of topic, sang in parallel with it:--        \"I will sing a new song unto thee, O God!      Upon psaltery and harp will I sing praise to thee.      Thou art He that giveth salvation to kings,      That delivereth David, thy servant, from the sword.      Rid me and save me from those who speak vanity,      Whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood,--      That our sons may be as plants in fresh youth;      That our daughters may be as corner-stones,--      The polished stones of our palaces;      That our garners may be full with all manner of store;      That our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in the          way;      That there may be no cry nor complaint in our streets      Happy is the people that is in such a case;      Yea, happy is the people whose God is the Lord!\"    The melody was triumphant; and the enthusiastic manner yet more so. The  Philistines listened delighted,--too careless of religion, they, indeed  not to be catholic in presence of religious enthusiasm; and Homer wore  the exalted expression which his face seldom wore. For the first time  since his childhood, Homer felt that he was not alone in the world!    Who shall venture to tell what passed between the two minstrels, when  Homer, leaving his couch, crossed the circle at once, flung himself on  the ground by David's side, gave him his hand; when they looked each  other in the face, and sank down into the rapid murmuring of talk, which  constant gesture illustrated, but did not fully explain to the rough men  around them? They respected the poets' colloquy for a while; but then,  eager again to hear one harp or the other, they persuaded one of the  Ionian sailors to ask Homer again to sing to them.    It was hard to persuade Homer. He shook his head, and turned back to the  soldier-poet.    \"What should _I_ sing?\" he said.    They did not enter into his notion: hearers will not always. And so,  taking his question literally, they replied, \"Sing? Sing us of the  snow-storm, the storm of stones, of which you sang at noon.\"    Poor Homer! It was easier to do it than to be pressed to do it; and he  struck his harp again:--        \"It was as when, some wintry day, to men        Jove would, in might, his sharp artillery show;      He wills his winds to sleep, and over plain        And mountains pours, in countless flakes, his snow,      Deep it conceals the rocky cliffs and hills,        Then covers all the blooming meadows o'er,      All the rich monuments of mortals' skill,        All ports and rocks that break the ocean-shore      Rock, haven, plain, are buried by its fall;      But the near wave, unchanging, drinks it all.      So while these stony tempests veil the skies,      While this on Greeks, and that on Trojans flies,      The walls unchanged above the clamor rise.\"[B]    The men looked round upon David, whose expression, as he returned the  glance, showed that he had enjoyed the fragment as well as they. But  when they still looked expectant, he did not decline the unspoken  invitation; but, taking Homer's harp, sang, as if the words were  familiar to him:--        \"He giveth snow like wool;      He scattereth the hoar-frost like ashes;      He casteth forth his ice like morsels;      Who can stand before his cold?      He sendeth forth his word, and melteth them;      He causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow.\"    \"Always this '_He_,'\" said one of the young soldiers to another.    \"Yes,\" he replied; \"and it was so in the beginning of the evening, when  we were above there.\"    \"There is a strange difference between the two men, though the one plays  as well as the other, and the Greek speaks with quite as little foreign  accent as the Jew, and their subjects are the same.\"    \"Yes,\" said the young Philistine harper; \"if the Greek should sing one  of the Hebrew's songs, you would know he had borrowed it, in a moment.\"    \"And so, if it were the other way.\"    \"Of course,\" said their old captain, joining in this conversation.  \"Homer, if you call him so, sings the thing made: David sings the maker.  Or, rather, Homer thinks of the thing made: David thinks of the maker,  whatever they sing.\"    \"I was going to say that Homer would sing of cities; and David, of the  life in them.\"    \"It is not what they say so much, as the way they look at it. The Greek  sees the outside,--the beauty of the thing; the Hebrew--\"    \"Hush!\"    For David and his new friend had been talking too. Homer had told him of  the storm at sea they met a few days before; and David, I think, had  spoken of a mountain-tornado, as he met it years before. In the  excitement of his narrative he struck the harp, which was still in his  hand, and sung:--        \"Then the earth shook and trembled,      The foundations of the hills moved and were shaken,          Because He was wroth;      There went up a smoke out of his nostrils,      And fire out of his mouth devoured;          It burned with living coal.        He bowed the heavens also, and came down,      And darkness was under his feet;      He rode upon a cherub and did fly,      Yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.      He made darkness his resting-place,      His pavilion were dark waters and clouds of the skies;      At the brightness before him his clouds passed by,        Hail-stones and coals of fire.      The Lord also thundered in the heavens,      And the highest gave his voice;        Hail-stones and coals of fire.      Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them,      And he shot out his lightnings, and discomfited them.        Then the channels of waters were seen,        And the foundations of the world were made known,          At thy rebuke, O Lord!        At the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.          He sent from above, he took me,          He drew me out of many waters.\"    \"Mine were but a few verses,\" said Homer. \"I am more than repaid by  yours. Imagine Neptune, our sea-god, looking on a battle:--        \"There he sat high, retired from the seas;      There looked with pity on his Grecians beaten;      There burned with rage at the god-king who slew them.      Then he rushed forward from the rugged mountains,           Quickly descending;      He bent the forests also as he came down,      And the high cliffs shook under his feet.         Three times he trod upon them,      And with his fourth step reached the home he sought for.        \"There was his palace, in the deep waters of the seas,      Shining with gold, and builded forever.      There he yoked him his swift-footed horses;      Their hoofs are brazen, and their manes are golden.         He binds them with golden thongs,         He seizes his golden goad,      He mounts upon his chariot, and doth fly:      Yes! he drives them forth into the waves!      And the whales rise under him from the depths,          For they know he is their king;      And the glad sea is divided into parts,      That his steeds may fly along quickly;      And his brazen axle passes dry between the waves,      So, bounding fast, they bring him to his Grecians.\"[C]    And the poets sank again into talk.    \"You see it,\" said the old Philistine. \"He paints the picture. David  sings the life of the picture.\"    \"Yes: Homer sees what he sings; David feels his song.\"    \"Homer's is perfect in its description.\"    \"Yes; but for life, for the soul of the description, you need the  Hebrew.\"    \"Homer might be blind; and, with that fancy and word-painting power of  his, and his study of everything new, he would paint pictures as he  sang, though unseen.\"    \"Yes,\" said another; \"but David--\" And he paused.    \"But David?\" asked the chief.    \"I was going to say that he might be blind, deaf, imprisoned, exiled,  sick, or all alone, and that yet he would never know he was alone;  feeling as he does, as he must to sing so, of the presence of this Lord  of his!\"    \"He does not think of a snow-flake, but as sent from him.\"    \"While the snow-flake is reminding Homer of that hard, worrying,  slinging work of battle. He must have seen fight himself.\"    They were hushed again. For, though they no longer dared ask the poets  to sing to them,--so engrossed were they in each other's society,--the  soldiers were hardly losers from this modest courtesy. For the poets  were constantly arousing each other to strike a chord, or to sing some  snatch of remembered song. And so it was that Homer, _apropos_ of I do  not know what, sang in a sad tone:--        \"Like leaves on trees the race of man is found,      Now green in youth, now withering on the ground:      Another race the following spring supplies;      They fall successive, and successive rise.      So generations in their course"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15869"],[0,"A Voyage Towards the South Pole and Round the World Volume 2 (#10)"],[1," because it is sheltered from the reigning winds; and the winds to which it  is open, viz. from N.W. by N. to E. by N., seldom blow strong. The  promontory, or peninsula, which disjoins these two bays, I named Traitor's  Head, from the treacherous behaviour of its inhabitants. It is the N.E.  point of the island, situated in the latitude 18 deg. 43' S. longitude 169 deg.  '28' E., and terminates in a saddle-hill which is of height sufficient to  be seen sixteen or eighteen leagues. As we advanced to S.S.E., the new  island, we had before discovered, began to appear over the S.E. point of  the one near us, bearing S. 1/2 E., distant ten or twelve leagues. After  leaving this one, we steered for the east end of the other, being directed  by a great light we saw upon it.    At one o'clock the next morning, drawing near the shore, we tacked and  spent the remainder of the night making short boards. At sun-rise we  discovered a high table land (an island) bearing E. by S., and a small low  isle in the direction of N.N.E., which we had passed in the night without  seeing it. Traitor's Head was still in sight, bearing N. 20 deg. W. distant  fifteen leagues, and the island to the south extended from S. 7 deg. W. to S.  87 deg. W. distant three or four miles. We then found that the light we had  seen in the night was occasioned by a volcano, which we observed to throw  up vast quantities of fire and smoke, with a rumbling noise heard at a  great distance. We now made sail for the island; and, presently after,  discovered a small inlet which had the appearance of being a good harbour.  In order to be better informed, I sent away two armed boats, under the  command of Lieutenant Cooper, to sound it; and, in the meanwhile, we stood  on and off with the ship, to be ready to follow, or give them any  assistance they might want. On the east point of the entrance, we observed  a number of people, and several houses and canoes; and when our boats  entered the harbour, they launched some, and followed them, but came not  near. It was not long before Mr Cooper made the signal for anchorage; and  we stood in with the ship. The wind being at west, and our course S.S.W.,  we borrowed close to the west point, and passed over some sunken rocks,  which might have been avoided, by keeping a little more to the east, or  about one-third channel over. The wind left us as soon as we were within  the entrance, and obliged us to drop an anchor in four fathoms water. After  this, the boats were sent again to sound; and, in the meantime, the launch  was hoisted out, in order to carry out anchors to warp in by, as soon as we  should be acquainted with the channel.    While we were thus employed, many of the natives got together in parties,  on several parts of the shore, all armed with bows, spears, etc. Some swam  off to us, others came in canoes. At first they were shy, and kept at the  distance of a stone's throw; they grew insensibly bolder; and, at last,  came under our stern, and made some exchanges. The people in one of the  first canoes, after coming as near as they durst, threw towards us some  cocoa-nuts. I went into a boat and picked them up, giving them in return  some cloth and other articles. This induced others to come under the stern,  and alongside, where their behaviour was insolent and daring. They wanted  to carry off every thing within their reach; they got hold of the fly of  the ensign, and would have torn it from the staff; others attempted to  knock the rings off the rudder; but the greatest trouble they gave us was  to look after the buoys of our anchors, which were no sooner thrown out of  our boats, or let go from the ship, than they got hold of them. A few  muskets fired in the air had no effect; but a four-pounder frightened them  so much, that they quitted their canoes that instant, and took to the  water. But as soon as they found themselves unhurt, they got again into  their canoes, gave us some halloos, flourished their weapons, and returned  once more to the buoys. This put us to the expence of a few musquetoon  shot, which had the desired effect. Although none were hurt, they were  afterwards afraid to come near the buoys; very soon all retired on shore,  and we were permitted to sit down to dinner undisturbed.    During these transactions, a friendly old man in a small canoe made several  trips between us and the shore, bringing off each time a few cocoa-nuts, or  a yam, and taking in exchange whatever we gave him. Another was on the  gangway when the great gun was fired, but I could not prevail on him to  stay there long. Towards the evening, after the ship was moored, I landed  at the head of the harbour, in the S.E. corner, with a strong party of men,  without any opposition being made by a great number of the natives who were  assembled in two parties, the one on our right and the other on the left,  armed with clubs, darts, spears, slings, and stones, bows, and arrows, etc.  After distributing to the old people (for we could distinguish no chief),  and some others, presents of cloth, medals, etc. I ordered two casks to be  filled with water out of a pond about twenty paces behind the landing-place;  giving the natives to understand, that this was one of the articles  we wanted. Besides water, we got from them a few cocoa-nuts, which seemed  to be in plenty on the trees; but they could not be prevailed upon to part  with any of their weapons. These they held in constant readiness, and in  the proper attitudes of offence and defence; so that little was wanting to  make them attack us; at least we thought so, by their pressing so much upon  us, and in spite of our endeavours to keep them off. Our early re-embarking  probably disconcerted their scheme; and after that, they all retired. The  friendly old man before mentioned, was in one of these parties; and we  judged, from his conduct, that his temper was pacific.    CHAPTER V.    _An Intercourse established with the Natives; some Account of the Island,  and a Variety of Incidents that happened during our Stay at it._    August 1774    As we wanted to take in a large quantity both of wood and water, and as,  when I was on shore, I had found it practicable to lay the ship much nearer  the landing-place than she now was, which would greatly facilitate that  work, as well as overawe the natives, and enable us better to cover and  protect the working party on shore; with this view, on the 6th, we went to  work to transport the ship to the place I designed to moor her in. While we  were about this, we observed the natives assembling from all parts, and  forming themselves into two parties, as they did the preceding evening, one  on each side the landing-place, to the amount of some thousands, armed as  before. A canoe, sometimes conducted by one, and at other times by two or  three men, now and then came off, bringing a few cocoa-nuts or plantains.  These they gave us without asking for any return; but I took care they  should always have something. Their chief design seemed to invite us on  shore. One of those who came off was the old man, who had already  ingratiated himself into our favour. I made him understand, by signs, that  they were to lay aside their weapons, took those which were in the canoe,  and threw them overboard, and made him a present of a large piece of cloth.  There was no doubt but he understood me, and made my request known to his  countrymen. For as soon as he landed, we observed him to go first to the  one party, and then to the other; nor was he, ever after, seen by us with  any thing like a weapon in his hand. After this, three fellows came in a  canoe under the stern, one of them brandishing a club, with which he struck  the ship's side, and committed other acts of defiance, but at last offered  to exchange it for a string of beads, and some other trifles. These were  sent down to him by a line; but the moment they were in his possession, he  and his companions paddled off in all haste, without giving the club or any  thing else in return. This was what I expected, and indeed what I was not  sorry for, as I wanted an opportunity to shew the multitude on shore, the  effect of our fire arms, without materially hurting any of them. Having a  fowling-piece loaded with small shot (No. 3) I gave the fellow the  contents; and, when they were above musquet-shot off, I ordered some of the  musquetoons, or wall-pieces, to be fired, which made them leap out of the  canoe, keep under her offside, and swim with her ashore. This transaction  seemed to make little or no impression on the people there. On the  contrary, they began to halloo, and to make sport of it.    After mooring the ship, by four anchors, with her broadside to the  landing-place, hardly musquet-shot off, and placing our artillery in such a  manner as to command the whole harbour, I embarked with the marines, and a  party of seamen, in three boats, and rowed in for the shore. It hath been  already mentioned, that the two divisions of the natives were drawn up on each  side the landing-place. They had left a space between them of about thirty or  forty yards, in which were laid, to the most advantage, a few small bunches  of plantains, a yam, and two or three roots. Between these and the water  were stuck upright in the sand, for what purpose I never could learn, four  small reeds, about two feet from each other, in a line at right angles to  the shore, where they remained for two or three days after. The old man  before-mentioned, and two more, stood by these things, inviting us, by  signs, to land; but I had not forgot the trap I was so near being caught in  at the last island; and this looked something like it. We answered, by  making signs for the two divisions to retire farther back, and give us more  room. The old man seemed to desire them so to do, but no more regard was  paid to him than to us. More were continually joining them, and, except two  or three old men, not"]]]
