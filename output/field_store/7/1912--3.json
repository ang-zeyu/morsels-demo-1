Such a one, from  which two young were taken on January 31, 1920, was at a depth of about  65 centimeters, and about 1-1/2 meters beyond the periphery of the mound  itself.    The individual tunnels average about 8 centimeters in height, and about  11 centimeters in width, though the variation, especially in width, is  considerable. The expansions mentioned as being the chief places of  storage are from 15 to 25 centimeters in diameter, and may or may not  involve a considerable increase in height. They are frequently located  at junction points of two or more branches of the tunnel system.    The nest cavity is a chamber of approximately spherical shape and from  17 to 23 centimeters in diameter. Chambers of this character were  observed and noted as \"old storage\" in a number of cases. They were  sometimes cut off from the rest of the habitation, and at first were  supposed to contain abandoned musty storage. As experience in excavating  and interpreting results has been gained we have concluded that these  chambers in fact represent abandoned nests.    [Illustration: FIG. 3.--Diagram of the system of surface runways and  subsidiary dens of _Dipodomys spectabilis spectabilis_. The underground  tunnels of the main den were too complicated to illustrate on this  scale, being very similar to those of Figure 2. The underground tunnels  of the subsidiaries are shown in solid black. Some runways fade out in  the grass in a manner that can not be indicated in a line drawing.]    Bailey gives the dimensions of nest chambers observed in New Mexico as  about 6 by 8 inches to 8 by 10 inches. The nest is composed of finer,  softer, and more chaffy material than the regular storage. The chaff  refuse from the food probably contributes largely to it, though some  leaves of grasses not stored for food may also be found, and a nest,  especially the one in use, may be distinguished, if excavating is  carefully done, by the distinct cavity about the size of a fist in its  interior (Pl. IX, Fig. 1). One may sometimes find this cavity distinctly  warm from the recent presence of the inhabitant.    The walls or partitions between the chambers and tunnels are in places  surprisingly thin, and it is no wonder that one is almost certain to  break through in stepping on a mound, since the whole is a honeycomblike  structure of from two to four stories in vertical plan, as shown by the  transect of a mound in Plate VII, Figure 1. As Bailey writes, these  partition walls are a mixture of earth and old food and nest material  discarded years ago, resembling the adobe walls of the Mexican houses  built of chopped earth and straw. This is the result of the continual  ejection of refuse and earth as before mentioned, combined with the  caving action of rains and disturbances from larger animals.    Apparently there are no special pockets for deposit of feces in  _Dipodomys_ burrows; such matter may be found throughout the den, and is  more or less mixed with the food refuse which carpets practically the  entire tunnel system. The nest and food stores are, however, clean and  neat, the droppings being dry and, though present on the floor of a  storage chamber, not actually mingled with the food. Evidently the  animal does not clean up the floor litter before storing food material.    The entire system for any one den seems to consist not only of the  burrows within the mound itself, as described, but of those small  outlying ones which we have referred to as subsidiary burrows. These are  two to four in number, and are connected with the main mound by the  runways already mentioned. They often seem to be way stations on the  runways connecting main mounds, and there is seldom any mound of earth  whatever in connection with them. One entire den system, the home mound  and three subsidiaries, was mapped after being excavated (Fig. 3), all  having been carefully gassed with carbon bisulphide. The subsidiaries  were simple and contained no storage. Two of them were shallow, while in  the third a depth of 48 centimeters was reached. They appear to be  merely places of refuge, though the well-worn trails connecting them  with the main mound indicate regular use. These runways are conspicuous  on the Range Reserve, and are apparently characteristic of mounds  throughout the range of the animal. Dwellers in different mounds must  have rather extensive social contacts, notwithstanding the enmity of  individuals toward each other in captivity. The main mound, in this  instance very complicated, was in one place three stories high, and we  have found as many as four utilized stories; but as a rule there are two  or three only.    Since collapses are rather frequent during rainy seasons, aside from the  trampling previously referred to, the kangaroo rats, where abundant,  as on the Range Reserve, may well be a factor in increasing soil  porosity and fertility; for in the course of time they probably have  succeeded in plowing and cultivating the whole surface layer of the  soil. They may thus be a factor in ecologic succession, tending to  improve the character of the soil and adapt it to another stage.    Doubtless their own workings afford the only shelter the animals know.  In the course of our digging in one mound, the occupant, an adult male,  did not forsake the den until the excavation was three-fourths  completed; and even then it did not leave by a burrow leading away from  our operations, but came toward us, escaped the active efforts of four  individuals bent on its capture, and ran speedily along a used runway  toward another burrow several meters distant. A sack had been stuffed in  the mouth of this, however, and, baffled, the rat then returned to the  original burrow and was captured. Observations on other rats thus driven  from the home mound indicate that they are very familiar with the  runways of the vicinity of the mound and the various subsidiary burrows,  and it is a question whether they need to see clearly to follow these  runs. Apparently they never attempt to escape by forsaking their  well-traveled runways. Tests of the maze-running ability of these  animals by animal-behavior experts would be of extraordinary interest,  in view of the character of the homes which they always inhabit and the  network of runs on the outside.      [Illustration: PLATE IX. FIG. 1.--KANGAROO RAT NEST AND YOUNG.    Nest and the two young, the ordinary number in the litter, of _Dipodomys  s. spectabilis_, taken from den on January 31, 1920.]    [Illustration: PLATE IX. FIG. 2.--YOUNG OF THE KANGAROO RAT.    The same young as shown in Figure 1, above. They were probably about two  weeks old, the pelage being short but with the white markings of the  adult; the tails are relatively short and with scarcely any hair.]          COMMENSALS AND ENEMIES.      COMMENSALS.    It is doubtful whether any animals live in a truly commensal  relationship with _spectabilis_, but of not unfriendly associates there  are a great number. It is the experience of Bailey, corroborated by  observations of Vorhies on living animals, that these kangaroo rats are  active in defending their caches of food, and will even fight  individuals of the same species savagely and to the death. One moonlight  night a strange individual was liberated on a mound. It deliberately  entered one of the openings, but after about two minutes' time made an  exceedingly rapid exit, running rapidly out of sight as if pursued,  though the owner of the home did not appear outside of the burrow. There  can be little doubt that the stranger was precipitately ejected by the  owner. We suspect, though this is a point difficult to prove  satisfactorily, that _merriami_ does not always store food supplies for  itself, but visits the burrows of _spectabilis_ regularly to pilfer the  seed stored therein. The observed facts thus far recorded which suggest  this are that in no _merriami_ burrow examined has a store of food been  found, and also that in trapping for _spectabilis_ on its own  characteristic mounds one catches a large percentage of _merriami_.    On two separate occasions Vorhies has observed the smaller species  running over the mounds of the larger, actually carrying away the grain  which had been placed to entice the larger when it might appear. (In  these cases the larger species did not put in an appearance until near  morning.) Furthermore, the dens of _merriami_ are often connected by  distinct runways with those of _spectabilis_, indicating much traveling  or visiting. That this is probably not friendly visiting is suggested by  the certainty with which an individual of the larger species will strike  and kill one of the smaller when they are placed together in the same  inclosure. The word \"thief\" expresses this suspected relationship better  than would the term \"parasite.\"    It is not to be expected that such obvious shelter retreats as the  mounds of _spectabilis_ should fail to attract the attention of other  animals. We have found a small gecko (_Coleonyx variegatus_), scorpions  of two or three undetermined species, and certain insects (of the Order  Orthoptera) to be very common inhabitants of the dens. With the  exception of the parasitic insects the most common are wingless  locustids (_Ceuthophilus_ spp.) and the peculiar wingless females of a  species of cockroach (_Arenivaga erratica_). These two are seldom absent  when a burrow is excavated, the female cockroaches being abundant,  although the winged males have never been taken in the burrows.    Cary's observations at Monahans, Tex., and those of others at numerous  localities, combined with our own, show that at various times the dens  furnish protection and shelter for various species of cottontail rabbits  (_Sylvilagus_), ground squirrels (_Citellus_ and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/180"],[0,"The 1994 CIA World Factbook (#10)"],[1," and troposcatter    routes; high frequency radio used extensively for military links;    telephone service limited mostly to government and business use;    40,300 telephones (4.1 telephones per 1,000 persons); broadcast    stations - 17 AM, 13 FM, 6 TV; 2 Atlantic Ocean INTELSAT earth    stations    @Angola, Defense Forces    Branches:    Army, Navy, Air Force/Air Defense, People's Defense Organization and    Territorial Troops,  Manpower availability:    males age 15-49 2,262,669; fit for military service 1,139,319; reach    military age (18) annually 96,900 (1994 est.)
