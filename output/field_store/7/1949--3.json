[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18854"],[0,"The Gourmet's Guide to Europe (#10)"],[1," it has some good Chateau Neuf de Pape.      Cannes    Cannes is the first important town of the Riviera that the gourmet  flying south comes to, and at Cannes he will find a typical Riviera  restaurant. The Reserve at Cannes consists of one glassed-in shelter and  another smaller building on the rocks, which juts out into the sea from  the elbow of the Promenade de la Croisette. The spray of the wavelets  set up by the breeze splash up against the glass, and to one side are  the Iles des Lerins, St-Marguerite, and St-Honorat, where the liqueur  Lerina is made, shining on the deep blue sea, and to the other the  purple Montagnes de l'Esterel stand up with a wonderful jagged edge  against the sky. Amongst the rocks on which the building of the  restaurant stand are tanks, and in these swim fish, large and small, the  fine lazy _dorades_ and the lively little sea-gudgeon. One of the  amusements of the place is that the breakfasters fish out with a net the  little fishes which are to form a _friture_, or point out the bigger  victim which they will presently eat for their meal. The cooking is  simple and good, and with fish that thirty minutes before were swimming  in the green water, an omelette, a simple dish of meat, and a pint of  Cerons, or other white wine, a man may breakfast in the highest content  looking at some of the sunniest scenes in the world. There is always  some little band of Italian musicians playing and singing at the  Reserve, and though in London one would vote them a nuisance, at Cannes  the music seems to fit in with the lazy pleasure of breakfasting almost  upon the waves, and the throaty tenor who has been singing of Santa  Lucia gets a lining of francs to his hat. Most of the crowned heads who  make holiday at Cannes have taken their breakfast often enough in the  little glass summer-house, but the prices are in no way alarming. The  ladies gather at tea-time at the white building, where Mme. Rumplemayer  sells cakes and tea and coffee; and the Gallia also has a _clientele_ of  tea-drinkers, for whose benefit the band plays of an afternoon.      Nice    At Nice the London House is one of the classical restaurants of France,  and one may talk of it in comparison with the great houses of the  boulevards of the capital. I am bound to confess that the great salon  with its painted panels, its buffet and its skylight screened by an  awning, is not a lively room; but the attendance is quiet, soft-footed,  and unhurried, and the cooking is distinctly good. It has of course its  _specialites du maison_, and classical dishes have been invented within  its walls; but the man who wants to take his wife out to dine, and who  is prepared to pay a couple of sovereigns for the meal, will find that  he need not exceed that amount. Here is the menu of a little dinner for  two which I ordered last winter at the restaurant. With a pint of white  wine, a pint of champagne, a liqueur, and two cups of coffee, my bill  was 46 francs.               Hors-d'oeuvre.            Potage Lamballe.           Friture de Goujons.       Longe de veau aux Celeris.        Gelinotte a la Casserole.      Salade Romaine et Concombre.                Dessert.    The little Restaurant Francais, on the Promenade des Anglais, is one of  the cheeriest places possible to breakfast at on a sunny morning. In the  garden are palm-trees, and the tables are further shaded by great pink  and white umbrellas. A scarlet-coated band of Hungarians plays  inoffensive music under the verandah of the house, and the page and the  _chasseur_ water the road before the garden constantly with a fire-hose,  in order that the motor-cars which go rushing past shall not smother the  breakfast-eaters with dust. Broiled eggs and asparagus points, a trout  fresh from the river Loup--if such a fish is on the bill of fare--and  some tiny bird either roasted or _en casserole_, with some light white  wine, is a suitable meal to be eaten in this garden of a doll's-house  restaurant. The house has its history. It was formerly the Villa Wuertz  Dundas, where so many art treasures were collected in the salons Louis  XV. and XVI. Mons. Emile Favre, the new proprietor, has added  considerably to the old house.    The Restaurant du Helder, the white building in the arcade of the big  Place, has good cookery, and its _table-d'hote_ meals are excellent.    On regatta days the world of fashion occupies all the tables of the  restaurant on the _jetee_ at breakfast-time.    Two resorts patronised by the young sparks of Nice are the Regence and  the Garden Bar. The subjoined menu shows what the Regence can do when a  big dinner is given there:--            Hors-d'oeuvre varies.         Consomme a la d'Orleans.            Bouchees Montglas.        Filets de soles Joinville.       Piece de boeuf Renaissance.      Chaud-froid de foie gras.      Petits pois a la Francaise.      Faisans de Boheme a la broche.             Salade nicoise.             Mousse Regence.           Patisserie. Dessert.    The great confectioner's shop in the Place Massena and the Casino  Municipal are always crowded with ladies at tea-time.      Beaulieu    At Beaulieu the Restaurant de la Reserve is famous. It is just a  convenient distance for a drive from Monte Carlo, and the world and the  half-world drive or motor out there from the town on the rock and sit at  adjacent tables in the verandah without showing any objection one to the  other. The restaurant is a little white building in a garden, with a  long platform built out over the sea, so that breakfasting one looks  right down upon a blue depth of water. There are tables inside the  building, but the early-comers and those wise people who have telephoned  for tables take those in the verandah if the day be sunny. There are  tanks into which the water runs in and out with each little wave and in  these are the Marennes oysters and other shell-fish. Oysters, a  _Mostelle a l'Anglaise_--Mostelle being the especial fish of this part  of the world--and some tiny bit of meat is the breakfast I generally  order at the Beaulieu Reserve; but the cook is capable of high flights,  and I have seen most elaborate meals well served. The proprietors are  two Italians who also own the neighbouring hotel, and who take their  cook with them to Aix-les-Bains when they migrate during the summer to  the restaurant of one of the casinos there. A little band of Italian  singers and musicians add to the noise of this very merry little  breakfasting place.    At Villefranche there are two unpretentious inns where men with an  unnatural craving for _Bouillabaisse_ go and eat it, and return with a  strong aroma of saffron and garlic accompanying them, saying that they  have partaken of the real dish, such as the fishermen cook for  themselves, and not the stew toned down to suit civilised palates.      Monte Carlo    The first time that I stayed for a week or so in the principality, I  lodged at the Hotel du Monte Carlo, on the hill below the Post Office.  It was a dingy hotel then, not having been redecorated and brightened up  as it has been now; but it had the supreme attraction to a lieutenant in  a marching regiment of being cheap. When the first day at dinner I cast  my eye down the wine-list, I found amongst the clarets wines of the  great vintage years at extraordinarily low prices, and in surprise I  asked the reason. The manager explained to me that the hotel was in the  early days used as a casino, and that the wines formed part of the  cellar of the proprietor--whether Mons. Blanc, or another, I do not  remember. Most of them were too old to bear removal to Paris, and they  were put down on the wine-list at ridiculously low prices in order to  get rid of them, for, as the manager said, \"In Monte Carlo the winners  drink nothing but champagne, the losers water or whisky and soda.\" So  it is. In Monte Carlo, when a man has won, he wants the very best of  everything, and does not mind what he pays for it; when he has lost he  has no appetite, and grudges the money he pays for a chop in the  grill-room of the Cafe de Paris. The prices at the restaurants are  nicely adapted to the purses of the winners; and there is no place in  the world where it is more necessary to order with discrimination and to  ask questions as to prices. At Monte Carlo it is the custom to entirely  disassociate your lodging from your feeding, and you may stay at one  hotel and habitually feed at the restaurant of another without the  proprietor of the first being at all unhappy. Ciro's in the arcade is a  restaurant only, and is very smart and not at all cheap. A story is told  that an Englishman, new to Monte Carlo and its ways, asked the liveried  porter outside Ciro's whether it was a cheap restaurant. \"Not exactly  cheap,\" said the Machiavelian servitor, \"but really very cheap for what  you get here.\" On a fine day grand duchesses and the _haute cocotterie_  beseech Ciro to reserve tables for them on the balcony looking out on  the sea, and unless you are a person of great importance or notoriety,  or of infinite push, you will find yourself relegated to a place inside  the restaurant. At dinner there is not so much competition. Ciro himself  is a little Italian, who speaks broken English and has a sense of humour  which carries him over all difficulties. Every day brings some fresh  story concerning the little man, and a typical one is his comforting  assurance to some one who complained of an overcharge for butter. \"Alla  right\" said Ciro complacently, \"I take him off your bill and charge him  to the Grand Duke. He not mind.\" The joke is sometimes against Ciro, as  when, anxious to have all possible luxuries for a great British  personage who was going to dine at the restaurant, and knowing that  plover's eggs are much esteemed in England, he obtained some of the  eggs, cooked them, and served them hot. Ciro's Restaurant originally was  where his bar now is; but when the Cafe"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18857"],[0,"A Journey to the Centre of the Earth (#10)"],[1,"the slightest notice of him, went in front of the horses,  and walked ahead with the same imperturbable phlegm he had always  exhibited.    Three hours later, still traveling over those apparently interminable  and sandy prairies, we were compelled to go round the Kollafjord, an  easier and shorter cut than crossing the gulfs. Shortly after we entered  a place of communal jurisdiction called Ejulberg, and the clock of which  would then have struck twelve, if any Icelandic church had been rich  enough to possess so valuable and useful an article. These sacred  edifices are, however, very much like these people, who do without  watches--and never miss them.    Here the horses were allowed to take some rest and refreshment, then  following a narrow strip of shore between high rocks and the sea, they  took us without further halt to the Aoalkirkja of Brantar, and after  another mile to Saurboer Annexia, a chapel of ease, situated on the  southern bank of the Hvalfjord.    It was four o'clock in the evening and we had traveled four Danish  miles, about equal to twenty English.    The fjord was in this place about half a mile in width. The sweeping and  broken waves came rolling in upon the pointed rocks; the gulf was  surrounded by rocky walls--a mighty cliff, three thousand feet in  height, remarkable for its brown strata, separated here and there by  beds of tufa of a reddish hue. Now, whatever may have been the  intelligence of our horses, I had not the slightest reliance upon them,  as a means of crossing a stormy arm of the sea. To ride over salt water  upon the back of a little horse seemed to me absurd.    \"If they are really intelligent,\" I said to myself, \"they will certainly  not make the attempt. In any case, I shall trust rather to my own  intelligence than theirs.\"    But my uncle was in no humor to wait. He dug his heels into the sides of  his steed, and made for the shore. His horse went to the very edge of  the water, sniffed at the approaching wave and retreated.    My uncle, who was, sooth to say, quite as obstinate as the beast he  bestrode, insisted on his making the desired advance. This attempt was  followed by a new refusal on the part of the horse which quietly shook  his head. This demonstration of rebellion was followed by a volley of  words and a stout application of whipcord; also followed by kicks on the  part of the horse, which threw its head and heels upwards and tried to  throw his rider. At length the sturdy little pony, spreading out his  legs, in a stiff and ludicrous attitude, got from under the Professor's  legs, and left him standing, with both feet on a separate stone, like  the Colossus of Rhodes.    \"Wretched animal!\" cried my uncle, suddenly transformed into a foot  passenger--and as angry and ashamed as a dismounted cavalry officer on  the field of battle.    \"Farja,\" said the guide, tapping him familiarly on the shoulder.    \"What, a ferry boat!\"    \"Der,\" answered Hans, pointing to where lay the boat in  question--\"there.\"    \"Well,\" I cried, quite delighted with the information; \"so it is.\"    \"Why did you not say so before,\" cried my uncle; \"why not start at  once?\"    \"Tidvatten,\" said the guide.    \"What does he say?\" I asked, considerably puzzled by the delay and the  dialogue.    \"He says tide,\" replied my uncle, translating the Danish word for my  information.    \"Of course I understand--we must wait till the tide serves.\"    \"For bida?\" asked my uncle.    \"Ja,\" replied Hans.    My uncle frowned, stamped his feet and then followed the horses to where  the boat lay.    I thoroughly understood and appreciated the necessity for waiting,  before crossing the fjord, for that moment when the sea at its highest  point is in a state of slack water. As neither the ebb nor flow can then  be felt, the ferry boat was in no danger of being carried out to sea, or  dashed upon the rocky coast.    The favorable moment did not come until six o'clock in the evening. Then  my uncle, myself, and guide, two boatmen and the four horses got into a  very awkward flat-bottom boat. Accustomed as I had been to the steam  ferry boats of the Elbe, I found the long oars of the boatmen but sorry  means of locomotion. We were more than an hour in crossing the fjord;  but at length the passage was concluded without accident.    Half an hour later we reached Gardar.          CHAPTER 10    TRAVELING IN ICELAND      It ought, one would have thought, to have been night, even in the  sixty-fifth parallel of latitude; but still the nocturnal illumination  did not surprise me. For in Iceland, during the months of June and July,  the sun never sets.    The temperature, however, was very much lower than I expected. I was  cold, but even that did not affect me so much as ravenous hunger.  Welcome indeed, therefore, was the hut which hospitably opened its doors  to us.    It was merely the house of a peasant, but in the matter of hospitality,  it was worthy of being the palace of a king. As we alighted at the door  the master of the house came forward, held out his hand, and without any  further ceremony, signaled to us to follow him.    We followed him, for to accompany him was impossible. A long, narrow,  gloomy passage led into the interior of this habitation, made from beams  roughly squared by the ax. This passage gave ingress to every room. The  chambers were four in number--the kitchen, the workshop, where the  weaving was carried on, the general sleeping chamber of the family, and  the best room, to which strangers were especially invited. My uncle,  whose lofty stature had not been taken into consideration when the house  was built, contrived to knock his head against the beams of the roof.    We were introduced into our chamber, a kind of large room with a hard  earthen floor, and lighted by a window, the panes of which were made of  a sort of parchment from the intestines of sheep--very far from  transparent.    The bedding was composed of dry hay thrown into two long red wooden  boxes, ornamented with sentences painted in Icelandic. I really had no  idea that we should be made so comfortable. There was one objection to  the house, and that was, the very powerful odor of dried fish, of  macerated meat, and of sour milk, which three fragrances combined did  not at all suit my olfactory nerves.    As soon as we had freed ourselves from our heavy traveling costume, the  voice of our host was heard calling to us to come into the kitchen, the  only room in which the Icelanders ever make any fire, no matter how cold  it may be.    My uncle, nothing loath, hastened to obey this hospitable and friendly  invitation. I followed.    The kitchen chimney was made on an antique model. A large stone standing  in the middle of the room was the fireplace; above, in the roof, was a  hole for the smoke to pass through. This apartment was kitchen, parlor  and dining room all in one.    On our entrance, our worthy host, as if he had not seen us before,  advanced ceremoniously, uttered a word which means \"be happy,\" and then  kissed both of us on the cheek.    His wife followed, pronounced the same word, with the same ceremonial,  then the husband and wife, placing their right hands upon their hearts,  bowed profoundly.    This excellent Icelandic woman was the mother of nineteen children, who,  little and big, rolled, crawled, and walked about in the midst of  volumes of smoke arising from the angular fireplace in the middle of the  room. Every now and then I could see a fresh white head, and a slightly  melancholy expression of countenance, peering at me through the vapor.    Both my uncle and myself, however, were very friendly with the whole  party, and before we were aware of it, there were three or four of these  little ones on our shoulders, as many on our boxes, and the rest hanging  about our legs. Those who could speak kept crying out saellvertu in  every possible and impossible key. Those who did not speak only made all  the more noise.    This concert was interrupted by the announcement of supper. At this  moment our worthy guide, the eider-duck hunter, came in after seeing to  the feeding and stabling of the horses--which consisted in letting them  loose to browse on the stunted green of the Icelandic prairies. There  was little for them to eat, but moss and some very dry and innutritious  grass; next day they were ready before the door, some time before we  were.    \"Welcome,\" said Hans.    Then tranquilly, with the air of an automaton, without any more  expression in one kiss than another, he embraced the host and hostess  and their nineteen children.    This ceremony concluded to the satisfaction of all parties, we all sat  down to table, that is twenty-four of us, somewhat crowded. Those who  were best off had only two juveniles on their knees.    As soon, however, as the inevitable soup was placed on the table, the  natural taciturnity, common even to Icelandic babies, prevailed over all  else. Our host filled our plates with a portion of lichen soup of  Iceland moss, of by no means disagreeable flavor, an enormous lump of  fish floating in sour butter. After that there came some skyr, a kind of  curds and whey, served with biscuits and juniper-berry juice. To drink,  we had blanda, skimmed milk with water. I was hungry, so hungry, that by  way of dessert I finished up with a basin of thick oaten porridge.    As soon as the meal was over, the children disappeared, whilst the grown  people sat around the fireplace, on which was placed turf, heather, cow  dung and dried fish-bones. As soon as everybody was sufficiently warm, a  general dispersion took place, all retiring to their respective couches.  Our hostess offered to pull off our stockings and trousers, according to  the custom of the country, but as we graciously declined to be so  honored, she left us to our bed of dry fodder.    Next day, at five in the morning, we took our leave of these hospitable  peasants. My uncle had great"]]]
