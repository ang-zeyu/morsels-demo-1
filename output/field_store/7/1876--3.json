Orleans was the Huguenot rallying-place, and while  besieging it Guise himself was assassinated. His death was believed by  his family to be due to the Admiral de Coligny. The city of Rochelle,  fortified by Jeanne of Navarre, became the stronghold of the Huguenots.  Leader after leader fell--Montmorency, on the one hand, was killed at  Montcontour; Conde, on the other, was shot in cold blood after the fight  of Jarnac. A truce followed, but was soon broken again, and in 1571  Coligny was the only man of age and standing at the head of the Huguenot  party; while the Catholics had as leaders Henry, Duke of Anjou, the  king's brother, and Henry, Duke of Guise, both young men of little more  than twenty. The Huguenots had been beaten at all points, but were still  strong enough to have wrung from their enemies permission to hold  meetings for public worship within unwalled towns and on the estates of  such nobles as held with them.      6. Catherine's Policy.--Catherine made use of the suspension of arms  to try to detach the Huguenot leaders, by entangling them in the  pleasures of the court and lowering their sense of duty. The court was  studiously brilliant. Catherine surrounded herself with a bevy of  ladies, called the Queen-Mother's Squadron, whose amusements were found  for the whole day. The ladies sat at their tapestry frames, while  Italian poetry and romance was read or love-songs sung by the gentlemen;  they had garden games and hunting-parties, with every opening for the  ladies to act as sirens to any whom the queen wished to detach from the  principles of honour and virtue, and bind to her service. Balls,  pageants, and theatricals followed in the evening, and there was hardly  a prince or noble in France who was not carried away by these seductions  into darker habits of profligacy. Jeanne of Navarre dreaded them for her  son Henry, whom she kept as long as possible under training in religion,  learning, and hardy habits, in the mountains of Bearn; and when  Catherine tried to draw him to court by proposing a marriage between him  and her youngest daughter Margaret, Jeanne left him at home, and went  herself to court. Catherine tried in vain to bend her will or discover  her secrets, and her death, early in 1572, while still at court, was  attributed to the queen-mother.      7. Massacre of St. Bartholomew (1572).--Jeanne's son Henry was  immediately summoned to conclude the marriage, and came attended by all  the most distinguished Huguenots, though the more wary of them remained  at home, and the Baron of Rosny said, \"If that wedding takes place the  favours will be crimson.\" The Duke of Guise seems to have resolved on  taking this opportunity of revenging himself for his father's murder,  but the queen-mother was undecided until she found that her son Charles,  who had been bidden to cajole and talk over the Huguenot chiefs, had  been attracted by their honesty and uprightness, and was ready to throw  himself into their hands, and escape from hers. An abortive attempt on  Guise's part to murder the Admiral Coligny led to all the Huguenots  going about armed, and making demonstrations which alarmed both the  queen and the people of Paris. Guise and the Duke of Anjou were,  therefore, allowed to work their will, and to rouse the bloodthirstiness  of the Paris mob. At midnight of the 24th of August, 1572, St.  Bartholomew's night, the bell of the church of St. Germain l'Auxerrois  began to ring, and the slaughter was begun by men distinguished by a  white sleeve. The king sheltered his Huguenot surgeon and nurse in his  room. The young King of Navarre and Prince of Conde were threatened into  conforming to the Church, but every other Huguenot who could be found  was massacred, from Coligny, who was slain kneeling in his bedroom by  the followers of Guise, down to the poorest and youngest, and the  streets resounded with the cry, \"Kill! kill!\" In every city where royal  troops and Guisard partisans had been living among Huguenots, the same  hideous work took place for three days, sparing neither age nor sex. How  many thousands died, it is impossible to reckon, but the work was so  wholesale that none were left except those in the southern cities, where  the Huguenots had been too strong to be attacked, and in those castles  where the seigneur was of \"the religion.\" The Catholic party thought the  destruction complete, the court went in state to return thanks for  deliverance from a supposed plot, while Coligny's body was hung on a  gibbet. The Pope ordered public thanksgivings, while Queen Elizabeth put  on mourning, and the Emperor Maximilian II., alone among Catholic  princes, showed any horror or indignation. But the heart of the unhappy  young king was broken by the guilt he had incurred. Charles IX. sank  into a decline, and died in 1574, finding no comfort save in the surgeon  and nurse he had saved.      8. The League.--His brother, _Henry III._, who had been elected King  of Poland, threw up that crown in favour of that of France. He was of a  vain, false, weak character, superstitiously devout, and at the same  time ferocious, so as to alienate every one. All were ashamed of a man  who dressed in the extreme of foppery, with a rosary of death's heads at  his girdle, and passed from wild dissipation to abject penance. He was  called \"the Paris Church-warden and the Queen's Hairdresser,\" for he  passed from her toilette to the decoration of the walls of churches with  illuminations cut out of old service-books. Sometimes he went about  surrounded with little dogs, sometimes flogged himself walking barefoot  in a procession, and his _mignons_, or favourites, were the scandal of  the country by their pride, license, and savage deeds. The war broke out  again, and his only remaining brother, Francis, Duke of Alencon, an  equally hateful and contemptible being, fled from court to the Huguenot  army, hoping to force his brother into buying his submission; but when  the King of Navarre had followed him and begun the struggle in earnest,  he accepted the duchy of Anjou, and returned to his allegiance. Francis  was invited by the insurgent Dutch to become their chief, and spent some  time in Holland, but returned, unsuccessful and dying. As the king was  childless, the next male heir was Henry of Bourbon, King of Navarre, who  had fled from court soon after Alencon returned to the Huguenot faith,  and was reigning in his two counties of Bearn and Foix, the head of the  Huguenots. In the resolve never to permit a heretic to wear the French  crown, Guise and his party formed a Catholic league, to force Henry III.  to choose another successor. Paris was devoted to Guise, and the king,  finding himself almost a prisoner there, left the city, but was again  mastered by the duke at Blois, and could so ill brook his arrogance, as  to have recourse to assassination. He caused him to be slain at the  palace at Blois in 1588. The fury of the League was so great that Henry  III. was driven to take refuge with the King of Navarre, and they were  together besieging Paris, when Henry III. was in his turn murdered by a  monk, named Clement, in 1589.      9. Henry IV.--The Leaguers proclaimed as king an old uncle of the  King of Navarre, the Cardinal of Bourbon, but all the more moderate  Catholics rallied round Henry of Navarre, who took the title of _Henry  IV._ At Ivry, in Normandy, Henry met the force of Leaguers, and defeated  them by his brilliant courage. \"Follow my white plume,\" his last order  to his troops, became one of the sayings the French love to remember.  But his cause was still not won--Paris held out against him, animated by  almost fanatical fury, and while he was besieging it France was invaded  from the Netherlands. The old Cardinal of Bourbon was now dead, and  Philip II. considered his daughter Isabel, whose mother was the eldest  daughter of Henry II., to be rightful Queen of France. He sent therefore  his ablest general, the Duke of Parma, to co-operate with the Leaguers  and place her on the throne. A war of strategy was carried on, during  which Henry kept the enemy at bay, but could do no more, since the  larger number of his people, though intending to have no king but  himself, did not wish him to gain too easy a victory, lest in that case  he should remain a Calvinist. However, he was only waiting to recant  till he could do so with a good grace. He really preferred Catholicism,  and had only been a political Huguenot; and his best and most faithful  adviser, the Baron of Rosny, better known as Duke of Sully, though a  staunch Calvinist himself, recommended the change as the only means of  restoring peace to the kingdom. There was little more resistance to  Henry after he had again been received by the Church in 1592. Paris,  weary of the long war, opened its gates in 1593, and the inhabitants  crowded round him with ecstasy, so that he said, \"Poor people, they are  hungry for the sight of a king!\" The Leaguers made their peace, and when  Philip of Spain again attacked Henry, the young Duke of Guise was one of  the first to hasten to the defence. Philip saw that there were no  further hopes for his daughter, and peace was made in 1596.      10. The Edict of Nantes.--Two years later, in 1598, Henry put forth  what was called the Edict of Nantes, because first registered in that  parliament. It secured to the Huguenots equal civil rights with those of  the Catholics, accepted their marriages, gave them, under restrictions,  permission to meet for worship and for consultations, and granted them  cities for the security of their rights, of which La Rochelle was the  chief. The Calvinists had been nearly exterminated in the north, but  there were still a large number in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/173"],[0,"The Insidious Dr. Fu Manchu (#10)"],[1,"than upon the day  when I left Mandalay.  You offer me a clew; I am here.  Your affair, I  believe, stands thus: A series of attempted burglaries, or something of  the kind, has alarmed your household.  Yesterday, returning from London  with your daughter, you were both drugged in some way and, occupying a  compartment to yourselves, you both slept.  Your daughter awoke, and  saw someone else in the carriage--a yellow-faced man who held a case of  instruments in his hands.\"    \"Yes; I was, of course, unable to enter into particulars over the  telephone.  The man was standing by one of the windows.  Directly he  observed that my daughter was awake, he stepped towards her.\"    \"What did he do with the case in his hands?\"    \"She did not notice--or did not mention having noticed.  In fact, as  was natural, she was so frightened that she recalls nothing more,  beyond the fact that she strove to arouse me, without succeeding, felt  hands grasp her shoulders--and swooned.\"    \"But someone used the emergency cord, and stopped the train.\"    \"Greba has no recollection of having done so.\"    \"Hm!  Of course, no yellow-faced man was on the train.  When did you  awake?\"    \"I was aroused by the guard, but only when he had repeatedly shaken me.\"    \"Upon reaching Great Yarmouth you immediately called up Scotland Yard?  You acted very wisely, sir.  How long were you in China?\"    Mr. Eltham's start of surprise was almost comical.    \"It is perhaps not strange that you should be aware of my residence in  China, Mr. Smith,\" he said; \"but my not having mentioned it may seem  so.  The fact is\"--his sensitive face flushed in palpable  embarrassment--\"I left China under what I may term an episcopal cloud.  I have lived in retirement ever since.  Unwittingly--I solemnly declare  to you, Mr. Smith, unwittingly--I stirred up certain deep-seated  prejudices in my endeavors to do my duty--my duty.  I think you asked  me how long I was in China?  I was there from 1896 until 1900--four  years.\"    \"I recall the circumstances, Mr. Eltham,\" said Smith, with an odd note  in his voice.  \"I have been endeavoring to think where I had come  across the name, and a moment ago I remembered.  I am happy to have met  you, sir.\"    The clergyman blushed again like a girl, and slightly inclined his  head, with its scanty fair hair.    \"Has Redmoat, as its name implies, a moat round it?  I was unable to  see in the dusk.\"    \"It remains.  Redmoat--a corruption of Round Moat--was formerly a  priory, disestablished by the eighth Henry in 1536.\" His pedantic  manner was quaint at times. \"But the moat is no longer flooded. In  fact, we grow cabbages in part of it. If you refer to the strategic  strength of the place\"--he smiled, but his manner was embarrassed  again--\"it is considerable. I have barbed wire fencing, and--other  arrangements. You see, it is a lonely spot,\" he added apologetically.  \"And now, if you will excuse me, we will resume these gruesome  inquiries after the more pleasant affairs of dinner.\"    He left us.    \"Who is our host?\" I asked, as the door closed.    Smith smiled.    \"You are wondering what caused the 'episcopal cloud?'\" he suggested.  \"Well, the deep-seated prejudices which our reverend friend stirred up  culminated in the Boxer Risings.\"    \"Good heavens, Smith!\" I said; for I could not reconcile the diffident  personality of the clergyman with the memories which those words  awakened.    \"He evidently should be on our danger list,\" my friend continued  quickly; \"but he has so completely effaced himself of recent years that  I think it probable that someone else has only just recalled his  existence to mind.  The Rev. J. D. Eltham, my dear Petrie, though he  may be a poor hand at saving souls, at any rate, has saved a score of  Christian women from death--and worse.\"    \"J. D. Eltham--\" I began.    \"Is 'Parson Dan'!\" rapped Smith, \"the 'Fighting Missionary,' the man  who with a garrison of a dozen cripples and a German doctor held the  hospital at Nan-Yang against two hundred Boxers.  That's who the Rev.  J. D. Eltham is!  But what is he up to, now, I have yet to find out.  He is keeping something back--something which has made him an object of  interest to Young China!\"    During dinner the matters responsible for our presence there did not  hold priority in the conversation.  In fact, this, for the most part,  consisted in light talk of books and theaters.    Greba Eltham, the clergyman's daughter, was a charming young hostess,  and she, with Vernon Denby, Mr. Eltham's nephew, completed the party.  No doubt the girl's presence, in part, at any rate, led us to refrain  from the subject uppermost in our minds.    These little pools of calm dotted along the torrential course of the  circumstances which were bearing my friend and me onward to unknown  issues form pleasant, sunny spots in my dark recollections.    So I shall always remember, with pleasure, that dinner-party at  Redmoat, in the old-world dining-room; it was so very peaceful, so  almost grotesquely calm.  For I, within my very bones, felt it to be  the calm before the storm.  When, later, we men passed to the library,  we seemed to leave that atmosphere behind us.    \"Redmoat,\" said the Rev. J. D. Eltham, \"has latterly become the theater  of strange doings.\"    He stood on the hearth-rug. A shaded lamp upon the big table and  candles in ancient sconces upon the mantelpiece afforded dim  illumination.  Mr. Eltham's nephew, Vernon Denby, lolled smoking on the  window-seat, and I sat near to him.  Nayland Smith paced restlessly up  and down the room.    \"Some months ago, almost a year,\" continued the clergyman, \"a  burglarious attempt was made upon the house.  There was an arrest, and  the man confessed that he had been tempted by my collection.\" He waved  his hand vaguely towards the several cabinets about the shadowed room.    \"It was shortly afterwards that I allowed my hobby for--playing at  forts to run away with me.\"  He smiled an apology.  \"I virtually  fortified Redmoat--against trespassers of any kind, I mean.  You have  seen that the house stands upon a kind of large mound.  This is  artificial, being the buried ruins of a Roman outwork; a portion of the  ancient castrum.\" Again he waved indicatively, this time toward the  window.    \"When it was a priory it was completely isolated and defended by its  environing moat.  Today it is completely surrounded by barbed-wire  fencing.  Below this fence, on the east, is a narrow stream, a  tributary of the Waverney; on the north and west, the high road, but  nearly twenty feet below, the banks being perpendicular.  On the south  is the remaining part of the moat--now my kitchen garden; but from  there up to the level of the house is nearly twenty feet again, and the  barbed wire must also be counted with.    \"The entrance, as you know, is by the way of a kind of cutting.  There  is a gate at the foot of the steps (they are some of the original steps  of the priory, Dr. Petrie), and another gate at the head.\"    He paused, and smiled around upon us boyishly.    \"My secret defenses remain to be mentioned,\" he resumed; and, opening a  cupboard, he pointed to a row of batteries, with a number of electric  bells upon the wall behind.  \"The more vulnerable spots are connected  at night with these bells,\" he said triumphantly.  \"Any attempt to  scale the barbed wire or to force either gate would set two or more of  these ringing.  A stray cow raised one false alarm,\" he added, \"and a  careless rook threw us into a perfect panic on another occasion.\"    He was so boyish--so nervously brisk and acutely sensitive--that it was  difficult to see in him the hero of the Nan-Yang hospital.  I could  only suppose that he had treated the Boxers' raid in the same spirit  wherein he met would-be trespassers within the precincts of Redmoat.  It had been an escapade, of which he was afterwards ashamed, as,  faintly, he was ashamed of his \"fortifications.\"  \"But,\" rapped Smith,  \"it was not the visit of the burglar which prompted these elaborate  precautions.\"    Mr. Eltham coughed nervously.    \"I am aware,\" he said, \"that having invoked official aid, I must be  perfectly frank with you, Mr. Smith.  It was the burglar who was  responsible for my continuing the wire fence all round the grounds, but  the electrical contrivance followed, later, as a result of several  disturbed nights.  My servants grew uneasy about someone who came, they  said, after dusk.  No one could describe this nocturnal visitor, but  certainly we found traces.  I must admit that.    \"Then--I received what I may term a warning.  My position is a peculiar  one--a peculiar one.  My daughter, too, saw this prowling person, over  by the Roman castrum, and described him as a yellow man.  It was the  incident in the train following closely upon this other, which led me  to speak to the police, little as I desired to--er--court publicity.\"    Nayland Smith walked to a window, and looked out across the sloping  lawn to where the shadows of the shrubbery lay.  A dog was howling  dismally somewhere.    \"Your defenses are not impregnable, after all, then?\" he jerked.  \"On  our way up this evening Mr. Denby was telling us about the death of his  collie a few nights ago.\"    The clergyman's face clouded.    \"That, certainly, was alarming,\" he confessed.    \"I had been in London for a few days, and during my absence Vernon came  down, bringing the dog with him.  On the night of his arrival it ran,  barking, into the shrubbery yonder, and did not come out.  He went to  look for it with a lantern, and found it lying among the bushes, quite  dead.  The poor creature had been dreadfully beaten about the head.\"    \"The gates were locked,\" Denby interrupted, \"and no one could have got  out of the grounds without a ladder and someone to assist him.  But  there was no sign of a living thing about.  Edwards and I searched  every corner.\"    \"How long has that other dog taken to"]]]
