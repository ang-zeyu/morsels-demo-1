It is flanked by two towers  built in front of the aisles, with two smaller porches at the base of  each. The three divisions of the west front are marked by buttresses,  prominent and richly ornamented, one on each side of the west window and  two at the external corners of the towers. The buttresses, covered with  niches and panelling, grow narrower and less prominent as they rise,  until they are cut short with three cornered caps some feet below the  battlements of the towers. The central window and the principal entrance  are surrounded with niches, and there is an elaborate gable above each  of them. The west front exhibits three different styles; the lowest  part, containing the porches and the west windows of the aisle, being of  the geometrical Decorated style; the middle portion, including the great  west window, the gables above it, and the middle windows of the towers  of the later or curvilinear Decorated; and the towers above the roof,  Perpendicular of the fifteenth century. The central gable and the great  west window are almost flamboyant in their decoration. A battlement  immediately above the central window runs right across the front. The  niches on the buttresses are in four storeys, and those on the central  part of the front in six, of varying heights. There is also a row of  niches on the towers immediately above the ornamental gable of the aisle  windows, and the upper part of each tower is covered with niches. The  greater part of these niches above the two lowest rows do not appear to  have ever contained sculpture. The bases of the lowest row of niches are  richly ornamented with foliage. The main entrance, though small, is  extraordinarily beautiful. It consists of a single arch, divided into  two smaller cusped arches by a central pillar with a circular opening  above it, glazed and filled with six divisions of cusped tracery. Above  the main arch is a gable, in which are five niches, the central one  containing the figure of an archbishop. It is uncertain whether this is  Archbishop John Romeyn, who began the nave, or Archbishop Melton, who  finished the west front and glazed the central window. On either side of  the gable are statues of the Percy and Vavasour, who gave the wood and  stone necessary for the building of the nave. These statues, and the  greater, part of the porch, have been restored. But even after  restoration the fine proportions and delicate workmanship of the porch  are evident. The slender shafts supporting the arches are well grouped  and contrasted. The capitals, though characteristically small, are most  delicate, and the mouldings are admirably varied with foliage, figures,  canopies, and brackets for statues, formal decoration, and courses of  plain stone. These mouldings contain the history of Adam and Eve. Even  the porches at Sienna and Orvieto, though made of far more costly  materials, can hardly be more beautiful than was this porch at the time  of its completion. There is but little other statuary remaining on the  west front. A few figures of saints remain in the upper niches of the  buttresses, and there are fragments of sculpture on some of the lowest.  The towers are 201 feet high, and are uniform in design. The front of  each contains three large windows; the highest, Perpendicular in style,  containing three lights; the middle, curvilinear Decorated, containing  four; and the lowest, the west windows of the aisle, being geometrical  Decorated, and containing three lights. The middle windows to the north  and south are of very curious half geometrical, half curvilinear  tracery. The highest and lowest windows of the towers have ornamented  gables above them, the lowest being triangular, the upper ogee-shaped.  The towers are topped with large battlements and pinnacles.    [Illustration: The West Front--Main Entrance.]    It will be seen, therefore, that this west front is planned on the most  regular lines and the most ambitious scale. True, some French facades  are loftier, as at Amiens for instance, but, as Professor Freeman has  pointed out, the effect aimed at at York is one of breadth rather than  of height, and it is an advantage that the front is not too high for the  towers to rise some way above it. It is also richly decorated and well  proportioned in the mass, and yet nearly every one, on first seeing it,  must be struck by its curious ineffectiveness when its height and  breadth, its regular outline, and profusion of ornament are considered.  To tell the truth, the English architects have here endeavoured to rival  the French on their own ground, and have not succeeded. The English  cathedral, as has been said, was not usually planned on such lines as to  make a sumptuous facade possible. Throughout the whole course of English  Gothic architecture, the treatment of the west end is curiously  hesitating and arbitrary. Sometimes it is altogether unambitious, as at  Winchester and Norwich; sometimes boldly illogical, as at Lincoln or  Peterborough; and at Salisbury, where everything else is beautiful, it  is altogether unsatisfactory. In all these cases circumstances were  against the architect, but at York there was every opportunity for a  great architectural triumph. Yet the designer was not able to throw off  his English timidity, to forget the small English features to which he  was used, and to conceive his front as a gigantic whole.    To begin with, he made his west window so large that every other  important feature of the central division of the front had to be  sacrificed to make room for it. In the great French facades the  customary circular window leaves ample space for vast porches below it.  These are pushed forward to a level with the great flanking buttresses,  so that the actual wall of the church above it appears to be recessed.  As the side porches fronting the aisles are on the same level with the  main porch, the bottom part of the front is bound together, and the  divisions of nave and aisle, emphasised above by the prominent  buttresses, are minimised below. This arrangement gives at once unity  and variety to the whole design. The towers do not appear to be external  additions rising from the ground, but an integral part, the very crown  and flower, in fact, of the whole design.    At York the central window is so large that it leaves but little room  below it for the porch. This porch, though exquisite in itself, is not  pushed forward, but flat with the wall, and appears a mere hole cut in  the surface. It has necessarily no connection with the entrances to the  aisles; and the finest feature of the great French facades is wanting.  But the size of the west window has other disastrous effects. It would  have been difficult, almost impossible, to assimilate an opening so  large, and of such an elaborate pattern, to the rest of the design, and  hardly an effort even has been made to do so. It appears, therefore,  like the porches, to have been cut bodily out of the front without  regard for the rest of the plan, and its acute arch harmonises badly  with the gable above it. No doubt the designer saw the fault; he placed  an acute ornamental gable above the window, rising to the top of the  front, and he covered the actual gable of the roof with flamboyant  tracery of the same character as that on the window; but, by so doing,  he merely weakened the contrast between tracery and bare spaces of  masonry so necessary to every great design.    The weakness of the central division is not made up for by any  excellence in the towers. These, though fine on their lower storeys, are  strangely feeble above. They are, in fact, the worst part of the  minster, and have been condemned by all critics, from Mr Ruskin  downwards. In most towers of this kind there are two windows above and a  single one below. At York the three storeys of single windows give the  design an air of monotony and weakness. Further, the highest window is  not only far too large, but is placed too low. Like the great west  window, it appears to have been cut out of the wall. It is also  peculiarly unfortunate that the buttresses should die into the wall  below the pinnacles. Where a tower is buttressed, it is a natural and  logical device to make the pinnacles a continuation of the buttresses.  Here both pinnacles and buttresses, unusually prominent and elaborate,  do not seem to be an integral part of the design. They have been called  a kind of architectural confectionery, and the criticism is just. The  fact that the battlements and pinnacles project a few inches over the  walls of the towers, only adds to the air of weakness and instability of  the whole. Nowhere else surely has a Gothic architect approached so  closely to the ideals of his \"churchwarden\" imitators of the beginning  of this century.    But these faults, though serious enough, do not include everything that  can be said against the west front of the minster. Gothic churches have  often been noble and triumphant works of art in spite of errors almost  as grave. Unfortunately the west front suffers from a tendency first  beginning to show itself in the middle of the fourteenth century, which  afterwards became the most serious drawback of the whole Perpendicular  style. It is not only because the porches do not project that it appears  flat and thin. The west front of Notre Dame at Paris has no projecting  porches, yet the alternations of bare spaces of wall and of rich and  deep masses of carving, the strong horizontal lines, and the deep-set  windows, give it a boldness and strength altogether wanting at York.  Like all Norman and earlier Gothic work, it has this great merit, often  most strongly felt by people who are quite unable to explain it, that  the design seems to emphasise, and to be dictated by, the materials in  which it is carried out. The Norman architect never forgot for a  moment--he was not skilful"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19423"],[0,"The Story of Porcelain (#10)"],[1,"enameled earthenwares, in the Low  Countries and the German States a new variety of pottery with a coarse  surface not unlike the porous skin of an orange was being made. This  was known as Gres de Flandres, _gres_ meaning earthenware. The unique  feature it possessed was not so much its orange-skin surface as the  surprising method by which it was glazed. The ware itself was made on  a potter's wheel often from the commonplace kinds of clay, such as are  employed in making stone china; sometimes this was brown, sometimes  gray, sometimes cream-colored. There was nothing original about the  material employed. But afterward--then came the amazing thing! When  the clay articles were put into the kiln to be fired a quantity of  common salt was thrown in with them and this salt created a vapor  which when it settled upon the ware fused with it, giving to the clay  a coarse, porous-appearing surface.\"    \"How do you suppose anybody ever thought of using salt?\" inquired  Theo.    \"I do not know. Probably the discovery, like so many others, was a  mere happen-so. At any rate it was a fortunate happening, for  immediately this method of glazing earthenware was carried to England,  where Doulton of Lambeth began manufacturing some very beautiful  gres. For gres can be of exquisite beauty as well as of most ordinary  type. Do not forget that. The term serves to cover those opaque  earthenwares which are fired until vitrification or an external  glassing results. At first all styles of gres were called Gres de  Flandres, but later the single term gres was given them. You will  hardly be surprised when I tell you that those past masters in the art  of every kind of pottery-making, the Chinese and Japanese, have given  us our finest specimens of gres, some of them having designs of  imitation jewels upon them; and others decorations of beautifully  colored enamels. Next to these Oriental varieties Germany has always  excelled in the making of gres. There is a great scope for artistic  expression in this ware, a far broader range for merit than in many  others.\"    \"So it was this salt glaze that England took up, was it?\" ruminated  Theo.    \"Yes. You see, up to this time very little glazed ware had been made  in England, for until the Dutch traders came with their Chinese and  Delft wares the English had been cheerfully using, as I told you,  unglazed clay, wood, pewter, and on rare occasions silver dishes. Even  the ladies of Queen Elizabeth's household felt no shame to eat from  wooden dishes. As for knives and forks--nobody used those! Every one  ate with his fingers. Think how primitive it must have been to go to a  banquet of the Lord-Mayor of London arrayed in your silk or velvet  costume, and eat roasted ox with your fingers from a trencher, or  square slab of wood! Yet such a procedure was considered entirely  proper in those days.\"    Theo was much amused.    \"Afterward for quite a long time dishes of brown stoneware were in  vogue; and then as an improvement on those came a coarse  greenish-yellow type of ware. It was about 1645 that into England  strayed a few Dutch potters who began to make a reproduction of Delft  pottery. In the meantime in quite another part of the country a  salt-glazed stoneware of far better quality than any previously  manufactured made its appearance. To this the name _porcellane_ was  given, and although the product was in reality simply a gres the fact  is interesting because it is the first time that we have the word  applied to china. It probably came from the Italian noun _porcellana_,  meaning a shell, which the thinness of the new ware may have  suggested; or the term may have been derived from the French word  _pourcelaine_, a word used for any material from which a sculptor  models his statues. We are not certain which of these theories is  correct. Nevertheless we have the name, although at this particular  date it was incorrectly applied.\"    \"But the English had nothing at that time but pottery to give the name  to,\" objected Theo.    Mr. Croyden chuckled.    \"Exactly! So they shouldn't have used the term at all,\" he said,  \"because they have confused a lot of good people since then. From this  period on England went steadily forward with its china-making.  Earthenware of various kinds covered with salt glaze were made at  Fulham, Stoke-on-Trent, and Staffordshire. It was about 1750 that the  second of the great potters made his advent.\"    \"Ah!\" cried Theo, \"now we are going to hear who he was!\"    Mr. Croyden paused a moment as if thinking just how he should best  tell the story. Then he began:    \"The name of this second pottery-maker to whom the world owes a mighty  debt was Josiah Wedgwood. He was a man who came naturally by his skill  at pottery-making, for, not only was he himself a potter, but he also  had several ancestors who had followed the trade. He was a  conscientious workman of limited education, but a person to whom a  thorough, careful piece of work, done as well as it was possible to do  it, was a satisfaction and delight. Remember that fact, for it had  much to do with Wedgwood's subsequent success. He also loved beauty  of form, and probably had he been able to choose he would have turned  his entire attention to making a classic type of pottery. But being  one of thirteen children he was poor, and his common sense told him  that there were far more necessary things to be done in the world than  to give all one's time to articles that were not useful. So he put his  dream behind him, like the practical fellow he was, and looked about  to see what his contemporaries needed, and what he could do to aid his  generation.\"    \"I should think that if he could have made some dishes it would have  helped as much as anything,\" asserted Theo emphatically.    \"That was precisely what he decided,\" answered  Mr. Croyden. \"Accordingly he went to work to apply his knowledge of  pottery to the improvement of English earthenware. First he made a  kind of cream-white pottery which he dubbed Queen's Ware in honor of  Queen Charlotte; and which in spite of the fact that it boasted no  decoration, became very popular in England because of its moderate  price. From this simple beginning Wedgwood got money to experiment  further, and work out other varieties of china. In 1773 he began his  famous dinner-set for Empress Catherine II of Russia, which had upon  it over twelve hundred enameled views of English estates, and for  which she paid three thousand pounds. For two months before this set  was packed and sent away it was on exhibition in London, where it was  the marvel of every one who saw it.\"    \"I'd like to have seen it!\" interjected Theo.    \"And I too,\" echoed Mr. Croyden. \"By this time Wedgwood had money  enough to carry out some of his dreams. He was fortunate in having the  friendship of several Englishmen of wealth and through one of them,  Sir William Hamilton, he obtained a chance to take impressions of rare  cameos from Italy and Pompeii; later the Duke of Portland, who you may  recall outbid him at the sale of the world-famed Portland Vase,  allowed him to copy it. It was a very generous thing for an art-lover  to do, and I think it must have cost the duke a wrench. It took  Wedgwood a whole year to copy this vase, and when he had succeeded in  doing so he made fifty more copies. The venture cost him not only his  time but a small fortune as well; but it proved far from a waste of  hours or money, since the feat brought to the manufacturer a  familiarity with Grecian art which had its outcome in his well-known  Jasper ware.\"    Theo glanced up questioningly.    \"Surely you have seen this ware, Theo,\" asserted Mr. Croyden. \"It  comes in blue sage-green, or purple, and has upon it Grecian figures  in white.\"    Instantly a flash of recognition came into Theo's face.    \"Oh, I know it now!\" he ejaculated. \"Mother has a teapot of it at  home.\"    \"That is more than likely,\" came cordially from Mr. Croyden. \"At  first, however, Wedgwood did not put the white figures on this ware;  he merely mixed the coloring matter with the clay and got as a result  a dull, opaque ware of green. Afterward he conceived the idea of  making the pottery in other colors and decorating it with the Grecian,  Italian, or Roman figures of which he had long before taken  impressions. As this venture took form sculptors became interested in  the project and lent their aid, so that by and by an entirely original  ware was developed which has come down through history as one of the  significant art contributions of the age. In addition to his Queen's  ware, and Jasper ware, Wedgwood also made a black Egyptian-like ware  called Basalt; another variety of cream-colored ware known as Bamboo;  and a kind of terra-cotta that imitated granite.\"    \"Well, I should certainly think Wedgwood did his bit!\" declared Theo.    \"Ah, but this was not all he did,\" retorted Mr. Croyden quickly. \"His  most important work I have not yet mentioned.\"    \"What was that?\"    \"He invented two things of widely different nature which have been of  the greatest practical value to our civilization ever since. One was a  hard biscuit porcelain such as is used in laboratories, and for  chemist's and pharmacist's utensils. This meant far greater  convenience in the mixing and preparation of drugs and medicines.\"    \"And the other?\"    \"The other was the glazing of common earthenware or terra-cotta  drain-pipes. This non-aesthetic product was perhaps Wedgwood's greatest  contribution to his time, for it revolutionized sanitation, and was a  mighty step toward better living conditions. Surely no one can say  that Josiah Wedgwood did not let his art serve his generation both  from an artistic and a practical standpoint.\"          [Illustration]          CHAPTER VII    PORCELAIN AT LAST      Progress toward health now became quite rapid, for Theo, being a  normal boy, the injured bone knit quickly, and before long Dr. Swift  "]]]
