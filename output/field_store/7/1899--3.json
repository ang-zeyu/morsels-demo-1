We passed through Tirlemont, and I thought  of my poor nurse and wished I could get out and see what she was doing.  Then I began to be rather puzzled by the way we were going. I knew this  line pretty well, but could not make out where we were. About three  o'clock in the morning I saw great forts on a hill sending out powerful  search-lights. I knew I could not be mistaken, this must be Liege. And  then we drew up in the great busy station, and I saw that it was indeed  Liege. So we were on our way to Germany after all, and not to the Dutch  frontier as we had been promised.    Next morning this was quite apparent, for we passed through Verviers and  then Herbesthal the frontier town. At the latter place the doors of all  our carriages were thrown violently open, and a Prussian officer shouted  in a raucous voice \"Heraus.\" Few of our party understood German, and  they did not get out quickly enough to please his lordship, for he  bellowed to the soldiers: \"Push those women out of the train if they  don't go quicker.\" Our things were thrown out after us as we scrambled  out on to the platform, while two officers walked up and down having  every bag and portmanteau turned out for their inspection. All  scissors, surgical instruments and other useful articles were taken away  from the Sisters, who protested in vain against this unfair treatment.  The soldiers belonging to our carriage, seeing this, tumbled all our  possessions back into the carriage, pretending that they had been  examined--for we had become fast friends since we had shared our scanty  stock of food and chocolate together. I was personally very thankful not  to have my belongings looked at too closely, for I had several things I  did not at all want to part with; one was my camera, which was sewn up  inside my travelling cushion, a little diary that I had kept in Belgium,  and a sealed letter that had been given me as we stood outside the  station at Brussels by a lady who implored me to take it to England and  post it for her there, as it was to her husband in Petrograd, who had  had no news of her since the war began. I had this in an inside secret  pocket, and very much hoped I should get it through successfully.    We were ordered into the train again in the same polite manner that we  had been ordered out. Our two soldiers were much upset by the treatment  we had received. One had tears in his eyes when he told us how sorry he  was, for he had the funny old-fashioned idea that Red Cross Sisters on  active service should be treated with respect--even if they were  English. He then told us that their orders were to accompany us to  Cologne; he did not know what was going to happen to us after that. So  Germany was to be our destination after all.    At the next station we stopped for a long time, and then the doors of  the carriages were opened and we were each given a bowl of soup. It was  very good and thick, and we christened it \"hoosh\" with remembrance of  Scott's rib-sticking compound in the Antarctic; and there was plenty of  it, so we providently filled up a travelling kettle with it for the  evening meal. Then we went on again and crawled through that  interminable day over the piece of line between Herbesthal and Cologne.  Evening came, and we thought of the \"hoosh,\" but when it came to the  point no one could look at it, and we threw it out of the window. A  horrible yellow scum had settled on the top of it and clung to the  sides, so that it spoilt the kettle for making tea--and we _were_ so  thirsty.    At last, late at night, we saw the lights of Cologne. We had been  thirty-two hours doing a journey that ordinarily takes six or seven. We  were ordered out of the train when we reached the station, and were  marched along between two rows of soldiers to a waiting-room. No porters  were allowed to help us, so we trailed all along those underground  corridors at Cologne station with our own luggage. Fortunately it was so  late that there were not many people about. We were allowed to have a  meal here, and could order anything we liked. Some coffee was a great  comfort, and we were able to buy rolls and fruit for the journey.    An incident happened here that made my blood boil, but nothing could be  done, so we had to set our teeth and bear it. A waiter came in smiling  familiarly, with a bundle of papers under his arm, and put one of these  illustrated weeklies beside each plate. On the front page was a horrible  caricature of England--so grossly indecent that it makes me hot now  even to think of it. As soon as I saw what they were, I went round to  each place, gathered them up and put them aside.    As we waited I wondered what was to be the next step, and could not help  thinking of my last visit to Cologne two years before. Then I went as a  delegate to a very large Congress and Health Exhibition, when we were  the honoured guests of the German National Council of Nurses. Then we  were feted by the Municipality of Cologne--given a reception at the  Botanical Gardens, a free pass to all the sights of Cologne, a concert,  tableaux, a banquet, I don't know what more. Now I was a prisoner  heavily guarded, weary, dirty, humiliated in the very city that had done  us so much honour.    After about three hours' wait we were ordered into another train,  mercifully for our poor bones rather a more comfortable one this time,  with plenty of room, and we went on our way, over the Rhine, looking  back at Cologne Cathedral, on past Essen and Dusseldorf, into the very  heart of Germany. It was rather an original idea--this trip through the  enemy's country in the middle of the war!    In the morning we had a nice surprise. We arrived at Muenster, and found  breakfast awaiting us. The Red Cross ladies of that town kindly provide  meals for all prisoners and wounded soldiers passing through. They  seemed very surprised when all we English people turned up, but they  were very kind in waiting on us, and after breakfast we got what was  better than anything in the shape of a good wash. We had a long wait at  Muenster so there was no hurry, and we all got our turn under the  stand-pipe and tap that stood in the station. Then on and on and on, and  it seemed that we had always been in the train, till at last, late one  evening, we arrived at Hamburg.    We were ordered out of the train here for a meal, and this was by far  the most unpleasant time we had. Evidently the news of our arrival had  preceded us, and a whole crowd of Hamburgers were at the station waiting  to see us emerge from the train.    They were not allowed on to the platform, but lined the outside of the  railing all the way down, laughing at us, spitting, hissing, jeering,  and making insulting remarks. And though we were English we had to take  it lying down. At the first indiscreet word from any of us they would  have certainly taken off the men of our party to prison, though they  would have probably done nothing more to us women than to delay our  journey. There were about fifteen doctors and dressers with us, and we  were naturally much more afraid for their safety than for our own. I  think I shall never forget walking down that platform at Hamburg. We  were hurried into a waiting-room, the door of which was guarded by two  soldiers, and a meal of bread and cold meat ordered for us. The German  waiters evidently much resented being asked to serve us, for they nearly  threw the food at us.    Then something happened that made up for everything. A young German  officer came up and asked in very good English if there was anything he  could do for us in any way.    \"I beg your pardon for speaking to you,\" he said, \"but I received so  much kindness from every one when I was in England, that it would be the  greatest pleasure I could have if I could help you at all.\" And he  started by giving the waiter the biggest blowing-up he had ever had in  his life, for which I could have hugged him. He then went off and came  back in a few minutes with fruit and chocolate and everything he could  find for us to take with us. He was a very bright and shining star in a  dark place. Then along the platform past that horrible, jeering crowd  and into the train once more.    It was night, and most of us were asleep when the train stopped with a  jerk, the doors of the train were thrown open, and the fresh, salty  smell of the sea met our nostrils. Some of the party, hardly awake,  thought they had to get out, and began to descend, but such volumes of  wrath met their attempt that they hastily got in again. Every window in  the train was shut, every blind pulled down and curtains closed, and a  soldier with loaded rifle stood at each window. We were crossing the  Kiel Canal. There were a great many people in England who would have  given anything to have been in our shoes just then. But we saw  absolutely nothing.    They forgot to give us any breakfast that day, but we did not mind.  Every mile now, along this flat, marshy country, was a mile nearer  Denmark and freedom, and our spirits rose higher every moment. Though  why the Germans should take us all through Germany and Denmark, when  they could just as easily have dropped us on the Dutch frontier, I  cannot even now imagine.    Early that afternoon we arrived at Vendrup, the Danish frontier, and the  soldiers and the train that had brought us all the way from Cologne went  back to Germany. It was difficult to realize that we were free once  more, after two months of being prisoners with no news of home, tied  down to a thousand tiresome regulations, and having witnessed terrible  sights that none of us will ever forget. Strange and delightful it was  to be able to send a telegram to England once more and to buy a paper;  wonderful to see the friendly, smiling faces all round us. It felt  almost like getting home again.

(#10)"],[1,"t, half of a shears.  But of some words originally, and in fact plural, we have formed a  singular; as, \"one twin died, and, tho the other one survived its  dangerous illness, the mother wept bitterly for her twins.\" _Twin_ is  composed of _two_ and _one_. It is found in old books, spelled _twane_,  two-one, or twin. Thus, the _twi_-light is formed by the mingling of two  lights, or the division of the rays of light by the approaching or  receding darkness. They _twain_ shall be one flesh. Sheep and deer are  singular or plural.    Most plurals are formed by adding _s_ to the singular, or, when euphony  requires it, _es_; as, tree, trees; sun, suns; dish, dishes; box, boxes.  Some retain the old plural form; as, ox, oxen; child, children; chick,  chicken; kit, kitten. But habit has burst the barrier of old rules, and  we now talk of chicks and chickens, kits and kittens. _Oxen_ alone  stands as a monument raised to the memory of unaltered saxon plurals.    Some nouns form irregular plurals. Those ending in _f_ change that  letter to _v_ and then add _es_; as, half, halves; leaf, leaves; wolf,  wolves. Those ending in _y_ change that to _i_ and add the _es_; as,  cherry, cherries; berry, berries; except when the _y_ is preceded by a  vowel, in which case it only adds the _s_; as, day, days; money, moneys  (not _ies_); attorney, attorneys. All this is to make the sound more  easy and harmonious. _F_ and _v_ were formerly used indiscriminately, in  singulars as well as plurals, and, in fact, in the composition of all  words where they occurred. The same may be said of _i_ and _y_.        \"The Fader (Father) Almychty of the heven abuf (above)      In the mene tyme, unto Juno his _luf_ (love)      Thus spak; and sayd.\"                                _Douglas, booke 12, pag. 441._        \"They lyued in ioye and in felycite      For eche of hem had other lefe and dere.\"                                _Chaucer, Monks Tale, fol. 81, p. 1._        \"When straite twane beefes he tooke      And an the aultar layde.\"    The reason why _y_ is changed into _i_ in the formation of plurals, and  in certain other cases, is, I apprehend, accounted for from the fact  that words which now end in _y_ formerly ended in _ie_, as may be seen  in all old books. The regular plural was then formed by adding _s_.    \"And upon those members of the _bodie_, which _wee_ thinke most  unhonest, put _wee_ more honestie on.\" \"It rejoyceth not in  iniquitie--diversitie of gifts--all thinges edifie not.\" See old bible,  1 Cor., chap. 13 and 14.    Other words form their plurals still more differently, for which no  other rule than habit can be given; as, man, men; foot, feet; tooth,  teeth; die, dice; mouse, mice; penny, pence, and sometimes pennies, when  applied to distinct pieces of money, and not to value.    Many foreign nouns retain the plural form as used by the nations from  whom we have borrowed them; as, cherub, cherubim; seraph, seraphim;  radius, radii; memorandum, memoranda; datum, data, &c. We should be  pleased to have such words carried home, or, if they are ours by virtue  of possession, let them be adopted into our family, and put on the  garments of naturalized citizens, and no longer appear as lonely  strangers among us. There is great aukwardness in adding the english to  the hebrew plural of cherub, as the translators of the common version of  the bible have done. They use _cherub_ in the singular and cherub_ims_  in the plural. The _s_ should be omitted and the Hebrew plural retained,  or the preferable course adopted, and the final _s_ be added, making  cherubs, seraphs, &c. The same might be said of all foreign nouns. It  would add much to the regularity, dignity, and beauty, of our vernacular  tongue.    Proper nouns admit of the plural number; as, there are sixty-four John  Smiths in New-York, twenty Arnolds in Providence, and fifteen Davises in  Boston. As we are not accustomed to form the plurals of proper names  there is not that ease and harmony in the first use of them that we have  found in those with which we are more familiar; especially those we have  rarely heard pronounced. Habit surmounts the greatest obstacles and  makes things the most harsh and unpleasant appear soft and agreeable.    Gender is applied to the distinction of the sexes. There are  two--masculine and feminine. The former is applied to males, the latter  to females. Those words which belong to neither gender, have been called  _neuter_, that is, _no gender_. But it is hardly necessary to perplex  the minds of learners with _negatives_. Let them distinguish between  masculine and feminine genders, and little need be said to them about a  _neuter_.    There are some nouns of both genders, as student, writer, pupil,  person, citizen, resident. _Poet_, _author_, editor, and some other  words, have of late been applied to females, instead of poet_ess_,  author_ess_, edit_ress_. Fashion will soon preclude the necessity of  this former distinction.    Some languages determine their genders by the form of the endings of  their nouns, and what is thus made masculine in Rome, may be feminine in  France. It is owing, no doubt, to this practice, in other nations, that  we have attached the idea of gender to inanimate things; as, \"the sun,  _he_ shines majestically;\" while of the moon, it is said, \"_she_ sheds a  milder radiance.\" But we can not coincide with the reason assigned by  Mr. Murray, for this distinction. His notion is not valid. It does not  correspond with facts. While in the south of Europe the sun is called  masculine and the moon feminine, the northern nations invariably reverse  the distinction, particularly the dialects of the Scandinavian. It was  so in our own language in the time of Shakspeare. He calls the sun a  \"_fair wench_.\"    By figures of rhetoric, genders may be attached to inanimate matter.  Where things are personified, we usually speak of them as masculine and  feminine; but this practice depends on fancy, and not on any fixed  rules. There is, in truth, but two genders, and those confined to  animals. When we break these rules, and follow the undirected wanderings  of fancy, we can form no rules to regulate our words. We may have as  many fanciful ones as we please, but they will not apply in common  practice. For example: poets and artists have usually attached female  loveliness to angels, and placed them in the feminine gender. But they  are invariably used in the masculine thro out the scriptures.    There is an apparent absurdity in saying of the ship General Williams,  _she_ is beautiful; or, of the steamboat Benjamin Franklin, _she_ is out  of date. It were far better to use no gender in such cases. But if  people will continue the practice of making distinctions where there are  none, they must do it from habit and whim, and not from any reason or  propriety.    There are three ways in which we usually distinguish the forms of words  in reference to gender. 1st. By words which are different; as boy, girl;  uncle, aunt; father, mother. 2d. By a different termination of the same  word; as instructor, instructress; lion, lioness; poet, poetess. _Ess_  is a contraction from the hebrew _essa_, a female. 3d. By prefixing  another word; as, a male child, a female child; a man servant, a maid  servant; a he-goat, a she-goat.    The last consideration that attaches to nouns, is the _position_ they  occupy in written or spoken language, in relation to other words, as  being _agents_, or _objects_ of action. This is termed _position_.    There are two positions in which nouns stand in reference to their  meaning and use. First, as _agents_ of action, as _David_ killed  Goliath. Second, as _objects_ on which action terminates; as, _Richard_  conquered _Henry_. These two distinctions should be observed in the use  of all nouns. But the propriety of this division will be more evident  when we come to treat of verbs, their agents and objects.    It will be perceived that we have abandoned the use of the \"_possessive  case_,\" a distinction which has been insisted on in our grammars; and  also changed the names of the other two. As we would adopt nothing that  is new without first being convinced that something is needed which the  thing proposed will supply; so we would reject nothing that is old,  till we have found it useless and cumbersome. It will be admitted on all  hands that the fewer and simpler the rules of grammar, the more readily  will they be understood, and the more correctly applied. We should  guard, on the one hand, against having so many as to perplex, and on the  other, retain enough to apply in the correct use of language. It is on  this ground that we have proposed an improvement in the names and number  of cases, or positions.    The word noun signifies name, and _nominative_ is the adjective derived  from noun, and partakes of the same meaning. Hence the _nominative_ or  _naming_ case may apply as correctly to the object as the agent. \"_John_  strikes _Thomas_, and _Thomas_ strikes _John_.\" John and Thomas name the  boys who strike, but in the first case John is the actor or agent and  Thomas the object. In the latter it is changed. To use a _nominative  name_ is a redundancy which should be avoided. You will understand my  meaning and see the propriety of the change proposed, as the mind of the  learner should not be burthened with needless or irrelevant phrases.    But our main objection lies against the \"possessive case.\" We regard it  as a false and unnecessary distinction. What is the possessive case?  Murray defines it as \"expressing the relation of property or possession;  as, my father's house.\" His rule of syntax is, \"one substantive governs  another, signifying a different thing, in the possessive or genitive  case; as, my father's house.\" I desire you to understand the definition  and use as here given. Read it over again, and be careful that you know  the meaning of _property_, _possession_, and "]]]
