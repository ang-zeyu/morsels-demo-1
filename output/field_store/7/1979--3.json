It was this  community which won the immortal honor of being the first to introduce the  Faith in the British Isles, in France and in Germany, and which sent forth  its consecrated pioneers and teachers to China, Japan and India, to  Australia and New Zealand, to the Balkan Peninsula, to South Africa, to  Latin America, to the Baltic States, to Scandinavia and the islands of the  Pacific, hoisting thereby its banner in the vast majority of the countries  won over to its cause, in both the East and the West, prior to  'Abdu'l-Baha's passing.    It was this community, the cradle and stronghold of the Administrative  Order of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, which, on the morrow of 'Abdu'l-Baha's  ascension, was the first among all other Baha'i communities in East and  West to arise and champion the cause of that Order, to fix its pattern, to  erect its fabric, to initiate its endowments, to establish and consolidate  its subsidiary institutions, and to vindicate its aims and purposes. To it  belongs the unique distinction of having erected, in the heart of the  North American continent, the first Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar of the West, the  holiest edifice ever to be reared by the hands of the followers of  Baha'u'llah in either the Eastern or Western Hemisphere. It was through  the assiduous and unflagging labors of the most distinguished and  consecrated among its itinerant teachers that the allegiance of royalty to  the Cause of Baha'u'llah was won, and unequivocally proclaimed in  successive testimonies as penned by the royal convert herself. To its  members, the vanguard of the torchbearers of the future world  civilization, must, moreover, be ascribed the imperishable glory of having  launched and successfully concluded the first stage of 'Abdu'l-Baha's  Divine Plan, in the concluding years of the first Baha'i century,  establishing thereby the structural basis of the Administrative Order of  the Faith in all the republics of Central and South America. It is this  same community which is once again carrying off the palm of victory  through launching, in the first decade of the second century of the Baha'i  Era, the second stage of that same Plan, destined to lay the foundations  of the Baha'i Administrative Order in no less than ten sovereign states in  the continent of Europe, comprising the Scandinavian states, the Low  Countries, the states of the Iberian Peninsula, Switzerland and Italy. And  lastly, to its enterprising members must go the unique honor and privilege  of having arisen, on unnumbered occasions, and over a period of more than  a quarter of a century, to champion the cause of the down-trodden and  persecuted among their brethren in Persia, in Egypt, in Russia, in 'Iraq  and in Germany, to stretch a generous helping hand to the needy among  them, to defend and safeguard the interests of their institutions, and to  plead their cause before political and ecclesiastical adversaries.    On the other hand is a nation that has achieved undisputed ascendancy in  the entire Western Hemisphere, whose rulers have been uniquely honored by  being collectively addressed by the Author of the Baha'i Revelation in His  Kitab-i-Aqdas; which has been acclaimed by 'Abdu'l-Baha as the \"home of  the righteous and the gathering-place of the free,\" where the \"splendors  of His light shall be revealed, where the mysteries of His Faith shall be  unveiled\" and belonging to a continent which, as recorded by that same  pen, \"giveth signs and evidences of very great advancement,\" whose \"future  is even more promising,\" whose \"influence and illumination are  far-reaching,\" and which \"will lead all nations spiritually.\" Moreover, it  is to this great republic of the West that the Center of the Covenant of  Baha'u'llah has referred as the nation that has \"developed powers and  capacities greater and more wonderful than other nations,\" and which \"is  equipped and empowered to accomplish that which will adorn the pages of  history, to become the envy of the world, and be blest in both the East  and the West for the triumph of its people.\" It is for this same American  democracy that He expressed His fervent hope that it might be \"the first  nation to establish the foundation of international agreement,\" \"to  proclaim the unity of mankind,\" and \"to unfurl the Standard of the Most  Great Peace,\" that it might become \"the distributing center of spiritual  enlightenment, and all the world receive this heavenly blessing,\" and that  its inhabitants might \"rise from their present material attainments to  such a height that heavenly illumination may stream from this center to  all the peoples of the world.\" It is in connection with its people that He  has affirmed that they are \"indeed worthy of being the first to build the  Tabernacle of the Great Peace and proclaim the oneness of mankind.\"            THE UNITED STATES IS SIGNALLY BLEST      This nation so signally blest, occupying so eminent and responsible a  position in a continent so wonderfully endowed, was the first among the  nations of the West to be warmed and illuminated by the rays of the  Revelation of Baha'u'llah, soon after the proclamation of His Covenant on  the morrow of His ascension. This nation, moreover, may well claim to  have, as a result of its effective participation in both the first and  second world wars, redressed the balance, saved mankind the horrors of  devastation and bloodshed involved in the prolongation of hostilities, and  decisively contributed, in the course of the latter conflict, to the  overthrow of the exponents of ideologies fundamentally at variance with  the universal tenets of our Faith.    To her President, the immortal Woodrow Wilson, must be ascribed the unique  honor, among the statesmen of any nation, whether of the East or of the  West, of having voiced sentiments so akin to the principles animating the  Cause of Baha'u'llah, and of having more than any other world leader,  contributed to the creation of the League of Nations--achievements which  the pen of the Center of God's Covenant acclaimed as signalizing the dawn  of the Most Great Peace, whose sun, according to that same pen, must needs  arise as the direct consequence of the enforcement of the laws of the  Dispensation of Baha'u'llah.    To the matchless position achieved by so preeminent a president of the  American Union, in a former period, at so critical a juncture in  international affairs, must now be added the splendid initiative taken, in  recent years by the American government, culminating in the birth of the  successor of that League in San Francisco, and the establishment of its  permanent seat in the city of New York. Nor can the preponderating  influence exerted by this nation in the councils of the world, the  prodigious economic and political power that it wields, the prestige it  enjoys, the wealth of which it disposes, the idealism that animates its  people, her magnificent contribution, as a result of her unparalleled  productive power, for the relief of human suffering and the rehabilitation  of peoples and nations, be overlooked in a survey of the position which  she holds, and which distinguishes her from her sister nations in both the  new and old worlds.            TRIBULATIONS ARE INEVITABLE      Many and divers are the setbacks and reverses which this nation, extolled  so highly by 'Abdu'l-Baha, and occupying at present so unique a position  among its fellow nations, must, alas, suffer. The road leading to its  destiny is long, thorny and tortuous. The impact of various forces upon  the structure and polity of that nation will be tremendous. Tribulations,  on a scale unprecedented in its history, and calculated to purge its  institutions, to purify the hearts of its people, to fuse its constituent  elements, and to weld it into one entity with its sister nations in both  hemispheres, are inevitable.    In one of the most remarkable Tablets revealed by 'Abdu'l-Baha, passages  of which have already been quoted on previous occasions, written in the  evening of His life, soon after the termination of the first World War, He  anticipates, in succinct and ominous sentences, the successive ebullitions  which must afflict humanity, and whose full force the American nation  must, if her destiny is to be accomplished, inevitably experience. \"The  ills from which the world now suffers,\" He wrote, \"will multiply; the  gloom which envelops it will deepen. The Balkans will remain discontented.  Its restlessness will increase. The vanquished powers will continue to  agitate. They will resort to every measure that may rekindle the flame of  war. Movements, newly born and world-wide in their range, will exert their  utmost effort for the advancement of their designs. The Movement of the  Left will acquire great importance. Its influence will spread.\"    The agitation in the Balkan Peninsula; the feverish activity in which  Germany and Italy played a disastrous role, culminating in the outbreak of  the second World War; the rise of the Fascist and Nazi movements, which  spread their ramifications to distant parts of the globe; the spread of  communism which, as a result of the victory of Soviet Russia in that same  war, has been greatly accelerated--all these happenings, some  unequivocally, others in veiled language, have been forecast in this  Tablet, the full force of whose implications are as yet undisclosed, and  which, we may well anticipate, the American nation, as yet insufficiently  schooled by adversity, must sooner or later experience.            AMERICA TO EVOLVE UNTIL LAST TASK IS DISCHARGED      Whatever the Hand of a beneficent and inscrutable Destiny has reserved for  this youthful, this virile, this idealistic, this spiritually blessed and  enviable nation, however severe "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19270"],[0,"Directives from the Guardian (#10)"],[1,"upon  the full approval of all four parents. Also your statement to the effect  that the principle of the oneness of mankind prevents any true Baha'i from  regarding race itself as a bar to union is in complete accord with the  Teachings of the Faith on this point. For both Baha'u'llah and  'Abdu'l-Baha never disapproved of the idea of interracial marriage, nor  discouraged it. The Baha'i Teachings, indeed, by their very nature  transcend all limitations imposed by race, and as such can and should  never be identified with any particular school of racial philosophy.\"            118: MARRIAGE, BAHA'I (CONSENT OF PARENTS--DUTY OF ASSEMBLY TO ASCERTAIN  VALIDITY)      \"With reference to the matter of the consent of the parents to a Baha'i  marriage: As this is a vital binding obligation, it is the duty of the  Assemblies to ascertain, before giving their sanction, that the consent  obtained has been given freely by the parents themselves.\"            119: MARRIAGE--(CONSENT OF PARENTS--NON-BAHA'I PARTICIPANTS)      \"Regarding the question whether it is necessary to obtain the consent of  the parents of a non-Baha'i participant in a marriage with a Baha'i; as  Baha'u'llah has stated that the consent of the parents of both parties is  required in order to promote unity and avoid friction, and as the Aqdas  does not specify any exceptions to this rule, the Guardian feels that  under all circumstances the consent of the parents of both parties is  required.\"            120: MARRIAGE TO NON-BAHA'I      \"The general principle in regard to the marriage of a Baha'i to a  non-Baha'i is as follows:    \"If a Baha'i marries a non-Baha'i who wishes to have the religious  ceremony of his own sect carried out, it must be quite clear that, first,  the Baha'i partner is understood to be a Baha'i by religion, and not to  accept the religion of the other party to the marriage through having his  or her religious ceremony; and second, the ceremony must be of a nature  which does not commit the Baha'i to any declaration of faith in a religion  other than his own. Under these circumstances the Baha'i can partake of  the religious ceremony of his non-Baha'i partner.    \"The Baha'i should insist on having the Baha'i ceremony carried out before  or after the non-Baha'i one, on the same day.\"            121: MARRIAGES, BAHA'I--(REPORTING TO THE NSA)      \"In reporting Baha'i marriages it is much better to mention that the  ceremony was performed by the Assembly, as this is the proper thing to do,  and an individual only acts for the Assembly on this occasion. As a  funeral is not a legal ceremony more latitude can be allowed, especially  as the family of the deceased may want some particular Baha'i friend to  officiate.\"            122: MARRIAGE, BAHA'I (RE: CONSENT OF NATURAL PARENTS)      \"Our beloved Guardian made it clear that it was the responsibility of the  Baha'i body performing the marriage ceremony to confirm without question  the fact that the living natural parents of the two individuals who are  being married have given their consent to the marriage. It is preferable  that this consent be given in writing, but if this is not possible, or  inadvisable for some reason, verbal consent in the present of witnesses is  sufficient.\"... \"Regarding your question of applying the sanction of  suspension of voting rights to people who marry without the consent of  parents, this should be done from now on. The laws of the Kitab-i-Aqdas  are explicit and not open to any ambiguity at all. As long as the parents  are alive, the consent must be obtained; it is not conditioned on their  relationship to their children. If the whereabouts of the parents is not  known legally, in other words, if they are legally dead, then it is not  necessary for the children to obtain their consent, obviously. It is not a  question of the child not knowing the present whereabouts of the parents,  it is a question of a legal thing--if the parents are alive, they must be  asked.\"            123: MARRIAGE OF BAHA'U'LLAH      \"It would, however, be very helpful for the friends to know that the  question which the above-mentioned missionary has raised in connection  with the marriage of Baha'u'llah and the provisions in the Aqdas regarding  the institution of marriage have been explained by 'Abdu'l-Baha in a  Tablet which the Guardian hopes to have translated and published in  conjunction with the Aqdas. Moreover, as regards Baha'u'llah's marriage,  it should be noted that His three marriages were all contracted before He  revealed His Book of Laws, and even before His declaration in Ba_gh_dad,  at a time when Baha'i marriage laws had not yet been made known, and the  Revelation not yet disclosed.\"            124: MASONRY, FREE (MEMBERSHIP IN)      \"Disapprove membership (in) Freemasonry.\" \"Any Baha'i determined retain  membership (in) Freemasonry loses voting rights.\"    \"The directive regarding membership in Freemasonry should be carried out  by your Assembly in all areas under your Assembly's jurisdiction.\"            125: MEDICAL SCIENCE (LEAVING BODIES TO)      \"There is nothing in the Teachings against leaving our bodies to Medical  Science. The only thing we should stipulate is that we do not wish to be  cremated, as it is against Baha'i Law.\"    \"As many people make arrangements to leave their bodies to Medical Science  for investigation, he suggests that you inquire, either through some  lawyer friend or through some hospital, how you could do this and then  make the necessary provision in your will, stipulating that you wish your  body to be of service to mankind in death, and that, being a Baha'i, you  request that your remains not be cremated and not be taken more than an  hour's journey from the place you die.\"    \"The spirit has no more connection with the body after it departs, but as  the body was once the temple of the spirit, we Baha'is are taught that it  must be treated with respect.\"            126: MEDITATION      \"Through meditation doors of deeper knowledge and inspiration may be  opened. Naturally, if one meditates as a Baha'i he is connected with the  Source;... Meditation is very important, and the Guardian sees no reason  why the friends should not be taught to meditate, but they should guard  against superstitions or foolish ideas creeping into it.\"            127: MEETINGS, BAHA'I      \"Regarding your question as to the advisability of holding Baha'i meetings  at a time coinciding with church meetings; the Guardian would advise the  friends to avoid such a coincidence, as otherwise many church people may  feel offended, and this may lead to unnecessary and even harmful  misunderstandings and developments which may injure the Cause and affect  its prestige in the eyes of the public. The friends should, under all  circumstances, be careful not to arouse unnecessarily any feelings of  religious antagonism.\"            128: MEMBERSHIP RESPONSIBILITIES, LSA (RESIDENTIAL QUALIFICATIONS)      \"...it is only too obvious that unless a member can attend regularly the  meetings of his local Assembly, it would be impossible for him to  discharge the duties incumbent upon him, and to fulfill his  responsibilities, as a representative of the community. Membership in a  Local Spiritual Assembly carries with it, indeed, an obligation and  capacity to remain in close touch with local Baha'i activities, and  ability to attend regularly the sessions of the Assembly.\"            129: MEMORIAL OFFERINGS      \"He feels sure this offering, expended in memory of your dear ones, will  rejoice their spirits, and aid them to progress in the world beyond.\"            130: MENTAL ILLNESS      \"Regarding persons whose condition has not been defined by the civil  authorities after medical diagnosis, the Assembly on the spot must  investigate every case that arises and, after consultation with experts,  deliver its verdict. Such a verdict, however, should, in important cases,  be preceded by consultation with the NSA. No doubt, the power of prayer is  very great, yet consultation with experts is enjoined by Baha'u'llah.  Should these experts believe that an abnormal case exists, the withholding  of voting rights is justified.\"            131: MILITARY DUTY (STATUS OF BAHA'IS IN RELATION TO)      \"No change whatsoever (in) status (of) Baha'is (in) relation (to) active  military duty. No compromise (of) spiritual principles (of) Faith possible  however tense (the) situation, however aroused public opinion.\"            132: MILITARY SERVICE      \"As there is neither an International Police Force nor any immediate  prospect of one coming into being, the Baha'is should continue to apply,  under all circumstances, for exemption from any military duties that  necessitate the taking of life. There is no justification for any change  of attitude on our part at the present time.\"            133: MORMONS (RELIGIOUS SECTS--ASSOCIATE WITH ALL--SHOW TOLERANCE AND  FRIENDLINESS)      \"The Baha'is should deal with the members of all religious sects, however,  with the greatest tolerance and friendliness, and try to point out to them  the significance of the Revelation of Baha'u'llah to the world in this  Great Day. The Guardian would advise you to teach the Mormons, like  everyone else, the Faith, when you find them receptive. They have many  great principles and their teachings regarding charity, not drinking or  smoking, etc., are quite similar to ours and should form a point of common  interest.\"            134: MUNIRIH _KH_ANUM      \"With regard to Munirih _Kh_anum's account of her life, concerning which  certain questions have been raised by one of the believers; what has been  written by Munirih _Kh_anum herself in that account, and also the  references to the subject made by Nabil in his Narrative should be taken  as the accurate standard and not what has been reported in Dr. Esslemont's  book.\"            135: MUSIC      \"Music, as one of the arts, is a natural"]]]
