Well, one day at the great fair of the races, my wife saw a  large doll in some window of a shop, and said, 'That looks just like our  Wacker!'  So we called him Wackerdoll, but after my wife died I called  him Wacker again, because Wacker_doll_ put me in mind of my poor wife.\"    When further interrogated on the same subject, he said:    \"A'ter my juva mullered, if I dicked a waver rakli with lakis'nav, an'  mandy was a rakkerin laki, mandy'd pen ajaw a waver geeri's nav, an  rakker her by a waver nav:--dovo's to pen I'd lel some bongonav sar's  Polly or Sukey.  An' it was the sar covva with my dades nav--if I dicked  a mush with a nav that simmed leskers, mandy'd rakker him by a waver nav.  For 'twould kair any mush wafro to shoon the navyas of the mullas a't  'were cammoben to him.\"    Or in English, \"After my wife died, if I saw another girl with her name,  and I was talking to her, I'd _speak_ another woman's name, and call her  by another name; that's to say, I'd take some nick-name, such as Polly or  Sukey.  And it was the same thing with my father's name--if I saw a man  with a name that was the same as his (literally, 'that _samed_ his'), I'd  call him by another name.  For 'twould make any man grieve (lit. 'bad')  to hear the names of the dead that were dear to him.\"    I suppose that there are very few persons, not of Gipsy blood, in  England, to whom the information will not be new, that there are to be  found everywhere among us, people who mourn for their lost friends in  this strange and touching manner.    Another form of respect for the departed among Gipsies, is shown by their  frequently burying some object of value with the corpse, as is, however,  done by most wild races.  On questioning the same Gipsy last alluded to,  he spoke as follows on this subject, I taking down his words:--    \"When Job mullered and was chivved adree the puv, there was a nevvi  kushto-dickin dui chakkas pakkered adree the mullo mokto.  Dighton penned  a mandy the waver divvus, that trin thousand bars was gavvered posh yeck  o' the Chilcotts.

Some chivs covvas pash the mullos adree the puv, and boot  adusta don't.\"    In English: \"When Job died and was buried, there was a new beautiful pair  of shoes put in the coffin (_lit_. corpse-box).  Dighton told me the  other day, that three thousand pounds were hidden with one of the  Chilcotts.  And I have heard of some Stanleys who were buried with gold  rings on their fingers.  '_Do all the Gipsies do that_?'  No! some put  things with the dead in the earth, and many do not.\"    Mr Liebich further declares, that while there is really nothing in it to  sustain the belief, this extraordinary reverence and regard for the dead  is the only fact at all indicating an idea of the immortality of the soul  which he has ever found among the Gipsies; but, as he admits, it proves  nothing.  To me, however, it is grimly grotesque, when I return to the  disciples of Comte--the Positivists--the most highly cultivated scholars  of the most refined form of philosophy in its latest stage, and find that  their ultimate and practical manifestation of _la religion_, is quite the  same as that of those unaffected and natural Positivists, the Gipsies.  With these, as with the others, our fathers find their immortality in our  short-lived memories, and if among either, some one moved by deep love--as  Auguste was by the eyes of Clotilda--has yearned for immortality with the  dear one, and cursed in agony Annihilation, he falls upon the faith  founded in ancient India, that only that soul lives for ever which has  done so much good on earth, as to leave behind it in humanity,  ineffaceable traces of its elevation.    Verily, the poor Gipsies would seem, to a humourist, to have been created  by the devil, whose name they almost use for God, a living parody and  satanic burlesque of all that human faith, doubt, or wisdom, have ever  accomplished in their highest forms.  Even to the weakest minded and most  uninformed manufacturers of \"Grellmann-diluted\" pamphlets, on the  Gipsies, their parallel to the Jews is most apparent.  All over the world  this black and God-wanting shadow dances behind the solid Theism of \"The  People,\" affording proof that if the latter can be preserved, even in the  wildest wanderings, to illustrate Holy Writ--so can gipsydom--for no  apparent purpose whatever.  How often have we heard that the preservation  of the Jews is a phenomenon without equal?  And yet they both live--the  sad and sober Jew, the gay and tipsy Gipsy, Shemite and Aryan--the one so  ridiculously like and unlike the other, that we may almost wonder whether  Humour does not enter into the Divine purpose and have its place in the  Destiny of Man.  For my own part, I shall always believe that the Heathen  Mythology shows a superiority to any other, in _one_ conception--that of  Loki, who into the tremendous upturnings of the Universe always inspires  a grim grotesqueness; a laughter either diabolic or divine.    Judaism, which is pre-eminently the principle of religious belief:--the  metaphysical emancipation and enlightenment of Germany, and the  materialistic positivism of France, are then, as I have indicated,  nowhere so practically and yet laughably illustrated as by the Gipsy.  Free from all the trammels of faith, and, to the last degree, indifferent  and rationalistic, he satisfies the demands of Feuerbach; devoted to the  positive and to the memory of the dead, he is the ideal of the greatest  French philosophy, while as a wanderer on the face of the earth--not  neglectful of picking up things _en route_--he is the rather blurred  _facsimile_ of the Hebrew, the main difference in the latter parallel  being that while the Jews are God's chosen people, the poor Gipsies seem  to have been selected as favourites by that darker spirit, whose name  they have naively substituted for divinity:--_Nomen et omen_.    I may add, however, in due fairness, that there are in England some true  Gipsies of unmixed blood, who--it may be without much reflection--have  certainly adopted ideas consonant with a genial faith in immortality, and  certain phases of religion.  The reader will find in another chapter a  curious and beautiful Gipsy custom recorded, that of burning an ash fire  on Christmas-day, in honour of our Saviour, because He was born and lived  like a Gipsy; and one day I was startled by bearing a Rom say \"Miduvel  hatch for mandy an' kair me kushto.\"--My God stand up for me and make me  well.  \"That\" he added, in an explanatory tone, \"is what you say when  you're sick.\"  These instances, however, indicate no deep-seated  conviction, though they are certainly curious, and, in their extreme  simplicity, affecting.  That truly good man, the Rev. James Crabb, in his  touching little book, \"The Gipsies' Advocate,\" gave numbers of instances  of Gipsy conversions to religion and of real piety among them, which  occurred after their minds and feelings had been changed by his labours;  indeed, it would seem as if their lively imaginations and warm hearts  render them extremely susceptible to the sufferings of Jesus.  But this  does not in the least affect the extraordinary truth that in their  nomadic and natural condition, the Gipsies, all the world over, present  the spectacle, almost without a parallel, of total indifference to, and  ignorance of, religion, and that I have found true old-fashioned  specimens of it in England.    I would say, in conclusion, that the Rev. James Crabb, whose unaffected  and earnest little book tells its own story, did much good in his own  time and way among the poor Gipsies; and the fact that he is mentioned to  the present day, by them, with respect and love, proves that missionaries  are not useless, nor Gipsies ungrateful--though it is almost the fashion  with too many people to assume both positions as rules without  exceptions.          CHAPTER V.  GIPSY LETTERS.      A Gipsy's Letter to his Sister.--Drabbing Horses.--Fortune Telling.--Cock  Shys.--\"Hatch 'em pauli, or he'll lel sar the Covvas!\"--Two German Gipsy  Letters.    I shall give in this chapter a few curious illustrations of Gipsy life  and character, as shown in a letter, which is illustrated by two  specimens in the German Rommany dialect.    With regard to the first letter, I might prefix to it, as a motto, old  John Willett's remark: \"What's a man without an imagination?\"  Certainly  it would not apply to the Gipsy, who has an imagination so lively as to  be at times almost ungovernable; considering which I was much surprised  that, so far as I know, the whole race has as yet produced only one  writer who has distinguished himself in the department of fiction--albeit  he who did so was a giant therein--I mean John Bunyan.    And here I may well be allowed an unintended digression, as to whether  Bunyan were really a Gipsy.  In a previous chapter of this work, I, with  little thought of Bunyan, narrated the fact that an intelligent tinker,  and a full Gipsy, asked me last summer in London, if I thought that the  Rommany were of the Ten Tribes of Israel?  When John Bunyan tells us  explicitly that he once asked his father whether he and his relatives  were of the race of the Israelites--he having then never seen a Jew--and  when he carefully informs his readers that his descent was of a low and  inconsiderable generation, \"my father's house being of that rank that is  meanest and most despised of all the families of the land,\" there remains  no rational doubt whatever that Bunyan was indeed a Rom of the Rommany.  \"_Applico_\" of which, as my own special and particular Gipsy is wont to  say--it is worth noting that the magician Shakespeare, who knew  everything, showed himself superior to many modern dramatists in being  aware that the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16360"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 561, October 2, 1886 (#10)"],[1,".    Mr. Biles remarked that there were many advantages in the use of twin  screws which had not been sufficiently taken into account. When a ship  with twin screws was being handled in dock there was greater  maneuvering power, and therefore less liability for the ship to come  in contact with the walls, although, if she did so, there would be  greater probability of damage to the propellers. He thought means  could be easily devised of protecting the screws when the ship was in  dock. Another of the incidental advantages connected with twin screws  was that smaller engines and smaller propellers were required, and  therefore they might run them at a higher speed. They would also get  lighter machinery with twin screws, and there would be less liability  to have bad castings and forgings in the smaller engines, and of  course the cost would be less.    With respect to the question of the middle line bulkheads, he could  not quite agree with Mr. John as to the great advantages of them in a  big passenger steamer. He thought there would be greater difficulty in  managing a ship so built if she was in danger of sinking. Increased  subdivision in a longitudinal direction was a very desirable thing,  and almost necessary for a condition of immunity from sinking. In  future Atlantic steamers longitudinal bulkheads should be placed not  in the middle line, but nearer the sides of the ships, and they should  recognize the fact that they had engines and boilers in different  compartments, and make arrangements whereby the ship would still  float, although the doors in these compartments were kept open. The  proper way to arrive at that was to have a ship with great beam, and  to have two longitudinal bulkheads at considerable distances from the  sides of the ship, subdivided as completely as possible, both under  and above water, so that, even supposing they got water into the space  between one bulkhead and the side of the ship, they would have  sufficient buoyancy in the other parts of the ship to keep her afloat.  Broad ships must necessarily mean deep ships, in order to have comfort  at sea. They were limited in length, and first came the question how  many passengers they wanted to carry. The experience of a ship like  the America--which was only 400 ft. in length--showed it was not  necessary to go to great length to have great speed. A ship of 400 ft.  to 430 ft. in length, 65 ft. of beam, and with a depth of 45 ft.,  would be a ship of proper dimensions for the Atlantic trade, and he  believed it quite possible to build a vessel of special construction  of about 7,000 tons gross register which should steam with less  consumption of coal than the Umbria and Etruria at a rate of 22 knots,  crossing the Atlantic from Liverpool to New York in six days. He  thought that was likely to be the vessel of the future, and that it  would be quite as commercially successful as the Umbria or Etruria.    Mr. J. Campbell remarked that at present the great American liners had  only the ordinary compound engines, and he thought that, instead of  converting them to triple expansion, they should take a step further  at once, and adopt quadruple expansion engines. This class of engines  was being very successfully built in various parts of the country. He  should recommend the adoption of a three-crank six-cylinder engine.    Mr. Hamilton did not think it had been demonstrated that greater  efficiency had been got out of twin screws than out of single screws;  but there was no doubt they would tend to additional safety.    Mr. Martell said that when they had got satisfactory data, twin screws  would be adopted for ships requiring great speed; but they had not got  that data at present.    Admiral Sir John Hay, referring to twin screws as applying to  sea-going steamers which might be employed for imperial defense, said  it was quite certain that the defense of their extended commerce  would always require to be assisted by ships such as the Oregon and  other magnificent vessels which had been used for that purpose on a  recent occasion. He believed that for war purposes the twin screw was  recognized by all naval men as having very many advantages. If that  were so, it was quite evident that it would be a great advantage,  under such conditions as occurred at the loss of the Oregon, if the  compartments could be made completely water-tight; and the twin screw,  with the separation of the ship longitudinally, gave them the very  greatest possible protection. They could not trust to bulkheads that  were only closed occasionally by doors. What was required for war  purposes was the entire and complete isolation of different parts of  the ship, having always practically closed communications between  them.    Mr. John then replied on the general discussion. He was pleased to  find that they had faith in the future of the twin screw and of  subdivision. The public had a right to demand greater safety than they  at present had on the Atlantic, or could have with a single screw.           *       *       *       *       *          EXAMINATION QUESTIONS IN GENERAL CONSTRUCTION.
