He passed by me quickly, saying, in a whisper that  seemed scarcely to come from his lips, \"Run, run! it is after me!\"  He gained the door to the landing, pulled it open, and rushed  forth.  I followed him into the landing involuntarily, calling him  to stop; but, without heeding me, he bounded down the stairs,  clinging to the balusters, and taking several steps at a time.  I  heard, where I stood, the street door open,--heard it again clap  to.  I was left alone in the haunted house.    It was but for a moment that I remained undecided whether or not to  follow my servant; pride and curiosity alike forbade so dastardly a  flight.  I re-entered my room, closing the door after me, and  proceeded cautiously into the interior chamber.  I encountered  nothing to justify my servant's terror.  I again carefully examined  the walls, to see if there were any concealed door.  I could find  no trace of one,--not even a seam in the dull-brown paper with  which the room was hung.  How, then, had the THING, whatever it  was, which had so scared him, obtained ingress except though my own  chamber?    I returned to my room, shut and locked the door that opened upon  the interior one, and stood on the hearth, expectant and prepared.  I now perceived that the dog had slunk into an angle of the wall,  and was pressing himself close against it, as if literally striving  to force his way into it.  I approached the animal and spoke to it;  the poor brute was evidently beside itself with terror.  It showed  all its teeth, the slaver dropping from its jaws, and would  certainly have bitten me if I had touched it.  It did not seem to  recognize me.  Whoever has seen at the Zoological Gardens a rabbit,  fascinated by a serpent, cowering in a corner, may form some idea  of the anguish which the dog exhibited.  Finding all efforts to  soothe the animal in vain, and fearing that his bite might be as  venomous in that state as in the madness of hydrophobia, I left him  alone, placed my weapons on the table beside the fire, seated  myself, and recommenced my Macaulay.    Perhaps, in order not to appear seeking credit for a courage, or  rather a coolness, which the reader may conceive I exaggerate, I  may be pardoned if I pause to indulge in one or two egotistical  remarks.    As I hold presence of mind, or what is called courage, to be  precisely proportioned to familiarity with the circumstances that  lead to it, so I should say that I had been long sufficiently  familiar with all experiments that appertain to the marvelous.  I  had witnessed many very extraordinary phenomena in various parts of  the world,--phenomena that would be either totally disbelieved if I  stated them, or ascribed to supernatural agencies.  Now, my theory  is that the supernatural is the impossible, and that what is called  supernatural is only a something in the laws of Nature of which we  have been hitherto ignorant.  Therefore, if a ghost rise before me,  I have not the right to say, \"So, then, the supernatural is  possible;\" but rather, \"So, then, the apparition of a ghost is,  contrary to received opinion, within the laws of Nature,--that is,  not supernatural.\"    Now, in all that I had hitherto witnessed, and indeed in all the  wonders which the amateurs of mystery in our age record as facts, a  material living agency is always required.  On the Continent you  will find still magicians who assert that they can raise spirits.  Assume for the moment that they assert truly, still the living  material form of the magician is present; and he is the material  agency by which, from some constitutional peculiarities, certain  strange phenomena are represented to your natural senses.    Accept, again, as truthful, the tales of spirit manifestation in  America,--musical or other sounds; writings on paper, produced by  no discernible hand; articles of furniture moved without apparent  human agency; or the actual sight and touch of hands, to which no  bodies seem to belong,--still there must be found the MEDIUM, or  living being, with constitutional peculiarities capable of  obtaining these signs.  In fine, in all such marvels, supposing  even that there is no imposture, there must be a human being like  ourselves by whom, or through whom, the effects presented to human  beings are produced.  It is so with the now familiar phenomena of  mesmerism or electro-biology; the mind of the person operated on is  affected through a material living agent.  Nor, supposing it true  that a mesmerized patient can respond to the will or passes of a  mesmerizer a hundred miles distant, is the response less occasioned  by a material being; it may be through a material fluid--call it  Electric, call it Odic, call it what you will--which has the power  of traversing space and passing obstacles, that the material effect  is communicated from one to the other.  Hence, all that I had  hitherto witnessed, or expected to witness, in this strange house,  I believed to be occasioned through some agency or medium as mortal  as myself; and this idea necessarily prevented the awe with which  those who regard as supernatural things that are not within the  ordinary operations of Nature, might have been impressed by the  adventures of that memorable night.    As, then, it was my conjecture that all that was presented, or  would be presented to my senses, must originate in some human being  gifted by constitution with the power so to present them, and  having some motive so to do, I felt an interest in my theory which,  in its way, was rather philosophical than superstitious.  And I can  sincerely say that I was in as tranquil a temper for observation as  any practical experimentalist could be in awaiting the effects of  some rare, though perhaps perilous, chemical combination.  Of  course, the more I kept my mind detached from fancy, the more the  temper fitted for observation would be obtained; and I therefore  riveted eye and thought on the strong daylight sense in the page of  my Macaulay.    I now became aware that something interposed between the page and  the light,--the page was overshadowed.  I looked up, and I saw what  I shall find it very difficult, perhaps impossible, to describe.    It was a Darkness shaping itself forth from the air in very  undefined outline.  I cannot say it was of a human form, and yet it  had more resemblance to a human form, or rather shadow, than to  anything else.  As it stood, wholly apart and distinct from the air  and the light around it, its dimensions seemed gigantic, the summit  nearly touching the ceiling.  While I gazed, a feeling of intense  cold seized me.  An iceberg before me could not more have chilled  me; nor could the cold of an iceberg have been more purely  physical.  I feel convinced that it was not the cold caused by  fear.  As I continued to gaze, I thought--but this I cannot say  with precision--that I distinguished two eyes looking down on me  from the height.  One moment I fancied that I distinguished them  clearly, the next they seemed gone; but still two rays of a pale-  blue light frequently shot through the darkness, as from the height  on which I half believed, half doubted, that I had encountered the  eyes.    I strove to speak,--my voice utterly failed me; I could only think  to myself, \"Is this fear?  It is NOT fear!\"  I strove to rise,--in  vain; I felt as if weighed down by an irresistible force.  Indeed,  my impression was that of an immense and overwhelming Power opposed  to my volition,--that sense of utter inadequacy to cope with a  force beyond man's, which one may feel PHYSICALLY in a storm at  sea, in a conflagration, or when confronting some terrible wild  beast, or rather, perhaps, the shark of the ocean, I felt MORALLY.  Opposed to my will was another will, as far superior to its  strength as storm, fire, and shark are superior in material force  to the force of man.    And now, as this impression grew on me,--now came, at last, horror,  horror to a degree that no words can convey.  Still I retained  pride, if not courage; and in my own mind I said, \"This is horror;  but it is not fear; unless I fear I cannot be harmed; my reason  rejects this thing; it is an illusion,--I do not fear.\"  With a  violent effort I succeeded at last in stretching out my hand toward  the weapon on the table; as I did so, on the arm and shoulder I  received a strange shock, and my arm fell to my side powerless.  And now, to add to my horror, the light began slowly to wane from  the candles,--they were not, as it were, extinguished, but their  flame seemed very gradually withdrawn; it was the same with the  fire,--the light was extracted from the fuel; in a few minutes the  room was in utter darkness.  The dread that came over me, to be  thus in the dark with that dark Thing, whose power was so intensely  felt, brought a reaction of nerve.  In fact, terror had reached  that climax, that either my senses must have deserted me, or I must  have burst through the spell.  I did burst through it.  I found  voice, though the voice was a shriek.  I remember that I broke  forth with words like these, \"I do not fear, my soul does not  fear\"; and at the same time I found strength to rise.  Still in  that profound gloom I rushed to one of the windows; tore aside the  curtain; flung open the shutters; my first thought was--LIGHT.  And  when I saw the moon high, clear, and calm, I felt a joy that almost  compensated for the previous terror.  There was the moon, there was  also the light from the gas lamps in the deserted slumberous  street.  I turned to look back into the room; the moon penetrated  its shadow very palely and partially--but still there was light.  The dark Thing, whatever it might be, was gone,--except that I  could yet see a dim shadow, which seemed the shadow of that shade,  against the opposite wall.    My eye now rested on the table, and from under the table (which was  without cloth or "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18350"],[0,"Social Life in the Insect World (#10)"],[1,"smaller, and  are assembled in regular groups which remind one of microscopical  bundles of cigars. We will consider the eggs of the common Cigale to the  exclusion of the others, as their history is the history of all.    September is not yet over when the shining white as of ivory gives way  to the yellow hue of cheese. During the first days of October you may  see, at the forward end of the egg, two tiny points of chestnut brown,  which are the eyes of the embryo in formation. These two shining eyes,  which almost seem to gaze at one, and the cone-shaped head of the egg,  give it the look of a tiny fish without fins--a fish for whom half a  nut-shell would make a capacious aquarium.    About the same time I notice frequently, on the asphodels in the paddock  and on those of the neighbouring hills, certain indications that the  eggs have recently hatched out. There are certain cast-off articles of  clothing, certain rags and tatters, left on the threshold of the  egg-chamber by the new-born grubs as they leave it and hurry in search  of a new lodging. We shall see in a moment what these vestiges mean.    But in spite of my visits, which were so assiduous as to deserve  success, I had never contrived to see the young Cigales emerge from  their egg-chambers. My domestic researches had been pursued in vain. Two  years running I had collected, in boxes, tubes, and bottles, a hundred  twigs of every kind which were peopled by the eggs of the Cigale; but  not one had shown me what I so desired to witness: the issue of the  new-born Cigales.    Reaumur experienced the same disappointment. He tells us how all the  eggs supplied by his friends were abortive, even when he placed them in  a glass tube thrust under his armpit, in order to keep them at a high  temperature. No, venerable master! neither the temperate shelter of our  studies and laboratories, nor the incubating warmth of our bodies is  sufficient here; we need the supreme stimulant, the kiss of the sun;  after the cool of the mornings, which are already sharp, the sudden  blaze of the superb autumn weather, the last endearments of summer.    It was under such circumstances, when a blazing sun followed a cold  night, that I found the signs of completed incubation; but I always came  too late; the young Cigales had departed. At most I sometimes found one  hanging by a thread to its natal stem and struggling in the air. I  supposed it to be caught in a thread of gossamer, or some shred of  cobweb.    At last, on the 27th of October, despairing of success, I gathered some  asphodels from the orchard, and the armful of dry twigs in which the  Cigales had laid their eggs was taken up to my study. Before giving up  all hope I proposed once more to examine the egg-chambers and their  contents. The morning was cold, and the first fire of the season had  been lit in my room. I placed my little bundle on a chair before the  fire, but without any intention of testing the effect of the heat of the  flames upon the concealed eggs. The twigs, which I was about to cut  open, one by one, were placed there to be within easy reach of my hand,  and for no other reason.    Then, while I was examining a split twig with my magnifying-glass, the  phenomenon which I had given up all hope of observing took place under  my eyes. My bundle of twigs was suddenly alive; scores and scores of the  young larvae were emerging from their egg-chambers. Their numbers were  such that my ambition as observer was amply satisfied. The eggs were  ripe, on the point of hatching, and the warmth of the fire, bright and  penetrating, had the effect of sunlight in the open. I was quick to  profit by the unexpected piece of good fortune.    At the orifice of the egg-chamber, among the torn fibres of the bark, a  little cone-shaped body is visible, with two black eye-spots; in  appearance it is precisely like the fore portion of the butter-coloured  egg; or, as I have said, like the fore portion of a tiny fish. You would  think that an egg had been somehow displaced, had been removed from the  bottom of the chamber to its aperture. An egg to move in this narrow  passage! a walking egg! No, that is impossible; eggs \"do not do such  things!\" This is some mistake. We will break open the twig, and the  mystery is unveiled. The actual eggs are where they always were, though  they are slightly disarranged. They are empty, reduced to the condition  of transparent skins, split wide open at the upper end. From them has  issued the singular organism whose most notable characteristics are as  follows:--    In its general form, the configuration of the head and the great black  eyes, the creature, still more than the egg, has the appearance of an  extremely minute fish. A simulacrum of a ventral fin increases the  resemblance. This apparent fin in reality consists of the two  fore-limbs, which, packed in a special sheath, are bent backwards,  stretched out against one another in a straight line. Its small degree  of mobility must enable the grub to escape from the egg-shell and, with  greater difficulty, from the woody tunnel leading to the open air.  Moving outwards a little from the body, and then moving back again, this  lever serves as a means of progression, its terminal hooks being already  fairly strong. The four other feet are still covered by the common  envelope, and are absolutely inert. It is the same with the antennae,  which can scarcely be seen through the magnifying-glass. The organism  which has issued from the egg is a boat-shaped body with a fin-shaped  limb pointing backwards on the ventral face, formed by the junction of  the two fore-limbs. The segmentation of the body is very clear,  especially on the abdomen. The whole body is perfectly smooth, without  the least suspicion of hair.    What name are we to give to this initial phase of the Cigale--a phase so  strange, so unforeseen, and hitherto unsuspected? Must I amalgamate some  more or less appropriate words of Greek and fabricate a portentous  nomenclature? No, for I feel sure that barbarous alien phrases are only  a hindrance to science. I will call it simply the _primary larva_, as I  have done in the case of the Meloides, the Leucospis, and the Anthrax.    The form of the primary larva of the Cigale is eminently adapted to its  conditions and facilitates its escape. The tunnel in which the egg is  hatched is very narrow, leaving only just room for passage. Moreover,  the eggs are arranged in a row, not end to end, but partially  overlapping. The larva escaping from the hinder ranks has to squeeze  past the empty shells, still in position, of the eggs which have already  hatched, so that the narrowness of the passage is increased by the empty  egg-shells. Under these conditions the larva as it will be presently,  when it has torn its temporary wrappings, would be unable to effect the  difficult passage. With the encumbrance of antennae, with long limbs  spreading far out from the axis of the body, with curved, pointed talons  which hook themselves into their medium of support, everything would  militate against a prompt liberation. The eggs in one chamber hatch  almost simultaneously. It is therefore essential that the first-born  larvae should hurry out of their shelter as quickly as possible, leaving  the passage free for those behind them. Hence the boat-like shape, the  smooth hairless body without projections, which easily squeezes its way  past obstructions. The primary larva, with its various appendages  closely wrapped against its body by a common sheath, with its fish-like  form and its single and only partially movable limb, is perfectly  adapted to make the difficult passage to the outer air.    This phase is of short duration. Here, for instance, a migrating larva  shows its head, with its big black eyes, and raises the broken fibres of  the entrance. It gradually works itself forward, but so slowly that the  magnifying-glass scarcely reveals its progress. At the end of half an  hour at the shortest we see the entire body of the creature; but the  orifice by which it is escaping still holds it by the hinder end of the  body.    Then, without further delay, the coat which it wears for this rough  piece of work begins to split, and the larva skins itself, coming out of  its wrappings head first. It is then the normal larva; the only form  known to Reaumur. The rejected coat forms a suspensory thread, expanding  at its free end to form a little cup. In this cup is inserted the end of  the abdomen of the larva, which, before allowing itself to fall to  earth, takes a sun-bath, grows harder, stretches itself, and tries its  strength, lightly swinging at the end of its life-line.    This little flea, as Reaumur calls it, first white, then amber-coloured,  is precisely the larva which will delve in the earth. The antennae, of  fair length, are free and waving to and fro; the limbs are bending at  their articulations; the fore-limbs, which are relatively powerful, open  and shut their talons. I can scarcely think of any more curious  spectacle than that of this tiny gymnast hanging by its tail, swinging  to the faintest breath, and preparing in the air for its entry into the  world. It hangs there for a variable period; some larvae let themselves  fall at the end of half an hour; others spend hours in their  long-stemmed cup; some even remain suspended until the following day.    Whether soon or late, the fall of the larva leaves suspended the thread  by which it hung, the wrappings of the primary larva. When all the brood  have disappeared, the aperture of the nest is thus hung with a branch of  fine, short threads, twisted and knotted together, like dried white of  egg. Each thread is expanded into a tiny cup at its free end. These are  very delicate and ephemeral relics, which perish at a touch. The least  wind quickly blows them away.    Let us return to the larva. Sooner or later, as we have seen, it falls  to the ground,"]]]
