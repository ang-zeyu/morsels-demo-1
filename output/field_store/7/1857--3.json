[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16965"],[0,"Queen Victoria (#10)"],[1,"ency, to sketchy and unfinished work.\"    She prepared herself for her life's work by years of hard study and  ten years' training, visiting all the best institutions in Germany,  France, and Italy. She gave up a life of ease and comfort in order  to develop her natural gift to the utmost.    Her opportunity was not long in coming. In 1854 the Crimean War broke  out. Most of the generals in the English army were old men whose  experience of actual warfare dated back to the early days of the  century. Everything was hopelessly mismanaged from the beginning.  In August the English and French allied forces moved against the  fortress of Sebastopol, from which Russia was threatening an attack  on Constantinople. Troops were landed in a hostile country without  the means of moving them away again; there was little or no provision  made to transport food, baggage, or medical stores.    After the victory of Alma Lord Raglan marched on to Balaclava, and  here the transport utterly broke down. The soldiers, in addition to  undertaking hard fighting, were forced to turn themselves into  pack-mules and tramp fourteen miles through the mud in the depth of  winter in order to obtain food and warm blankets for their comrades  and themselves. Their condition rapidly became terrible. Their  clothing wore to rags, their boots--mostly of poor quality--gave out  entirely. Their food--such as it was--consisted of biscuit, salt  beef or pork, and rum.    No vegetables could be obtained, and for want of green food scurvy  broke out among the troops. Stores were left decaying in the holds  of transports, and the doctors were forced to see men dying before  their eyes without the means of helping them. The loss of life from  the actual fighting was considerable, but more particularly so from  the insanitary condition of the camp and the wretched hospital  arrangements.    The actual figures of our losses in the war speak for themselves.  Out of a total loss of 20,656, only 2598 fell in battle; 18,058 died  from other causes in hospital. Several regiments lost nearly all  their men, and during the first seven months of the siege men died  so fast that in a year and a half no army would have been left at  all.    William Russell, the special correspondent of _The Times_, first  brought this appalling state of affairs to the notice of the public,  and the nation at last woke up. A universal outburst of indignation  forced ministers to act, and to act quickly.    Stores were hurried to the front; fresh troops were sent out to  relieve the almost exhausted remnants of the army, and on the 21st  October Florence Nightingale, with a band of nurses, set sail; she  arrived on the very eve of the Battle of Inkerman.    Within a few months of her arrival it is estimated that she had no  fewer than ten thousand sick men in her charge, and the rows of beds  in one hospital alone measured two and one-third miles in length.    Her influence over the rough soldiers was extraordinary; one of them  said of her: \"She would speak to one and another, and nod and smile  to many more; but she could not do it to all, you know--we lay there  in hundreds--but we could kiss her shadow as it fell, and lay our  heads on the pillow again, content.\"    Out of chaos she made order, and there were no more complaints of  waste and inefficiency. She never quitted her post until the war was  at an end, and on her return to England she received a national  welcome. She was received by the Queen and presented with a jewel  in commemoration of her work, and no less than fifty thousand pounds  was subscribed by the nation, a sum which was presented by Miss  Nightingale to the hospitals to defray the expenses of training  nurses.    [Illustration: Florence Nightingale]    Since this time no war between civilized peoples has taken place  without trained nurses being found in the ranks of both armies, and  at the Convention of Geneva, some years later, it was agreed that  in time of war all ambulances, military hospitals, etc., should be  regarded as neutral, and that doctors and nurses should be considered  as non-combatants. Nursing rapidly became a profession, and from the  military it spread to the civil hospitals, which were used as  training schools for all who took up the work.    Florence Nightingale's advice was sought by the Government and  freely given upon every matter which affected the health of the  people, and it is entirely owing to her influence and example that  speedy reforms were carried out, especially in the army.    Her noble work was celebrated by Longfellow, in his poem \"Santa  Filomena,\" often better known as \"The Lady with the Lamp\":        Thus thought I, as by night I read      Of the great army of the dead,          The trenches cold and damp,          The starved and frozen camp,        The wounded from the battle-plain,      In dreary hospitals of pain,          The cheerless corridors,          The cold and stony floors.        Lo! in that house of misery      A lady with a lamp I see          Pass through the glimmering gloom,          And flit from room to room.        And slow, as in a dream of bliss,      The speechless sufferer turns to kiss          Her shadow, as it falls          Upon the darkening walls.    The Queen followed the course of the war with painful interest. \"This  is a terrible season of mourning and sorrow,\" she wrote; \"how many  mothers, wives, sisters, and children are bereaved at this moment.  Alas! It is that awful accompaniment of war, disease, which is  so much more to be dreaded than the fighting itself.\" And again, after  a visit to Chatham: \"Four hundred and fifty of my dear, brave, noble  heroes I saw, and, thank God, upon the whole, all in a very  satisfactory state of recovery. Such patience and resignation,  courage, and anxiety to return to their service. Such fine men!\"    Many acts had been passed in previous reigns to improve the  disgraceful state of the prisons in this country, but it was left  to a band of workers, mostly Quakers, led by Elizabeth Fry, to bring  about any real improvement. Any one who wishes to read what dens of  filth and hotbeds of infection prisons were at this time need only  read the account of the Fleet prison in the _Pickwick Papers_ and  of the Marshalsea in _Little Dorrit_.    Reform proved at first to be a very slow and difficult matter. New  laws passed in 1823 and 1824 insisted upon cleanliness and regular  labour for all prisoners; chaplains and matrons for female prisoners  were appointed. The public, however, got the idea--as in the case  of workhouses--that things were being made too comfortable for the  inmates, and the Society for the Improvement of Prison Discipline  was bitterly attacked.    Mrs Fry had started work in Newgate Prison, then justly considered  to be the worst of all the bad prisons in the country. The condition  of the women and children was too dreadful to describe, and she felt  that the only way to introduce law and decency into this 'hell upon  earth' was by influencing the children.    She founded a school in the prison, and it was not long before there  was a marked improvement in the appearance and behaviour of both the  children and the women.    The success of her work attracted public attention, and a Committee  of the House of Commons was appointed to inquire into the condition  of the London prisons. Mrs Fry was called upon to give evidence, and  she recommended several improvements, _e.g._ that prisoners should  be given some useful work to do, that rewards should be given for  good behaviour, and that female warders should be appointed.    She visited other countries in order to study foreign prison systems,  and her work in the prisons led her to consider what could be done  to improve the condition of the unfortunate women who were  transported as convicts. She succeeded in improving matters so much  that female warders were provided on board ship, and proper  accommodation and care on their arrival at their destination.    Even such a tender-hearted man and friend of the poor as Thomas Hood,  author of \"Song of the Shirt,\" misunderstood Mrs Fry's aims, for in  a poem called \"A Friendly Address to Mrs Fry,\" he wrote:        No--I will be your friend--and, like a friend,      Point out your very worst defect--Nay, never      Start at that word! But I _must_ ask you why      You keep your school _in_ Newgate, Mrs Fry?        Your classes may increase, but I must grieve      Over your pupils at their bread and waters!      Oh, though it cost you rent--(and rooms run high)--      Keep your school _out_ of Newgate, Mrs Fry!    In the face of domestic sorrows and misfortunes, Mrs Fry persevered  until the day of her death in 1845 in working for the good of others.    The work in this direction was continued by Mary Carpenter, whose  father was the headmaster of a Bristol school. She began her life's  work after a severe outbreak of cholera in Bristol in 1832. At this  time there were practically no reformatory or industrial schools in  the country, and Mary Carpenter set to work with some friends to found  an institution near Bristol. She worked to save children--especially  those whose lives were spent in the midst of sin and wickedness--from  becoming criminals, and in order to bring this about she aimed at  making their surroundings as homelike and cheerful as possible.    She even helped to teach the children herself, as she found great  difficulty in finding good assistants. She wished to convince the  Government that her methods were right, and so persuade them to set  up schools of a similar kind throughout the country.    The great Lord Shaftesbury was her chief supporter, but it was not  until the year 1854 that Mary Carpenter succeeded in her desire, when  a Bill was passed establishing reformatory schools. From this time  her influence rapidly increased, and it is mainly owing to her  efforts that at the present day such"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16972"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 711, August 17, 1889 (#10)"],[1,"forces the copper bands to take up a position exactly in line with the  terminal contacts when the switch is closed, or at right angles to  them when it is opened.    [Illustration: FIG. 4A]    [Illustration: FIGS. 4, 4B and 4C]    Further, each lamp has its own separate adjustable resistance, fuse,  and switch. These are of special construction, combined in one, and  are illustrated in Figs. 4 and 4A; the other figures, 4B and 4C,  showing some of the details of the same. The wires, W W, lead from and  to one lamp. The current enters at one wire, passes through the fuse,  f--Figs. 4C and 4A--down the center of the cylinder to a divided  contact, into which a switch arm can be shot. When this is so, a  connection is made to the upright brass rod, T, which serves to grip  the band, R, passing round the body of the cylinder. The current then  passes through all the turns of wire above the band, and out at the  other terminal. The resistance can be varied by raising or lowering  the band. Fig. 4B shows the manner of tightening the band against the  wires on the cylinder. The upright rod, T, is seen in section, and is  fixed in one position to the frame of the apparatus. Abutting against  this, and working in the block to which the two ends of the band are  screwed, is a thumb screw, S, by turning which the band may be  loosened for adjusting, and tightened when the right position is  found. The cylinder is covered with asbestos sheet, and the wire,  which is of nickel, and measures altogether from 3 to 4 ohms, is wound  helically round this. The switch arm, to which the handle is attached  below, does not itself make and break the circuit, but carries a  spring, as shown, which, when the arm is at the end of its movement,  pulls over the contact lever with a rapid action, shooting the same  between the divided contact piece, and making a perfect contact. The  switchboard forms one side of a closed wooden case or cupboard, with  sufficient room for a man to enter and adjust the resistances or  switches for each lamp. These are screwed to the inside of the case in  rows, to the number of twenty-five. The greatest care has been taken  in the fixing of the connections to the inside of this case, and no  leading wires of different potential are allowed to cross each other.    [Illustration: FIG. 11A]    The Oerlikon lamp, which is designed to work with constant potential,  is shown partly in section in Fig. 8. There is only one solenoid, A,  through which all the current passes, and whose action is to strike  the arc and maintain the current constant. The soft iron core, C, is  suspended from the inside of the tube, T, in which it has an up and  down movement checked by an air piston in the tube. An end elevation  of the brake wheels and solenoid is given in Fig. 9, where it will be  seen that the spindle carrying these wheels also carries between them  a pinion engaging with the rack rod, R. The top carbon attached to the  rack rod falls by its own weight, and is therefore in contact with the  lower carbon before the lamp is switched in circuit. When this is done  the core is instantly magnetized, and attracted to the soft iron brake  wheels, which it holds firmly. The air cushion in the tube prevents  the core being drawn up until it has fairly gripped the sides of the  wheels. The subsequent raising of the core therefore turns the wheels,  raises the rack rod, and strikes the arc. The feed is operated by the  weakening of the magnetic field of the coil, which causes the core to  lose its grip of the wheels, and allows the top carbon to descend. The  catch, L, Fig. 8, has a lateral play, and serves to engage in the  teeth of the rack rod, so as to prevent its falling when being  trimmed. Each carbon when in position is held against two rectangular  guide bars by the pressure of a wire spring--see figure. In this way  the carbon is pressed against two parallel knife edges, and is  therefore always in true alignment. The action of the lamp is very  simple, the working parts are few and solidly constructed, and the  regulation, as exhibited by the lamps running in the galleries, is  exceptionally steady.    The transmission of power plant consists of two 250 horse power  dynamos--C.E.L. Brown's patent--the generator being driven by a  vertical compound condensing engine of the same power, running at 180  revolutions. The dynamo generator is a four-pole 600 volt direct  current machine, series wound, and may be distinguished in the  engraving next to the switch board; while the motor receiver  connected to it, and erected in another portion of the Swiss section,  is of exactly the same size and type. The field, which is hexagonal in  shape, is cast in two pieces, bolted together horizontally, the  cross-sectional area of iron being 170 square inches. The armature is  cylindrical, and built up of flat rings stamped out of soft sheet  iron, eight notches in the same being provided to fit over the arms of  the spider keyed to the shaft. The spider is in halves, which are  bolted together longitudinally after the rings are in position. It is  Gramme wound, and measures over the winding 7 in. radial depth, 37 in.  outside diameter, and 22 in. in length. The current is collected by  four brushes. The fitting and mechanical build of the dynamos leaves  nothing to be desired. All the working parts of the dynamos and  engines are turned up to gauge and template, so as to be  interchangeable. As an instance of this, the armature of the generator  was built in the works, while the field magnets were being erected in  the exhibition, and, on arrival, fitted in position perfectly, and ran  at once without trouble.    The energy taken off on the motor shaft is close on 200 horse power,  but varies according to the machines at work; the speed of the motor  does not, however, vary more than 3 per cent., and the brushes need no  adjustment. About 6 ft. of shafting is coupled on in line with the  motor shaft, and an extra plummer block fixed at the end. This  shafting carries at its extremity an additional 2 ft. pulley, the  power being delivered by belting from these pulleys to two large  pulleys on the main shaft.    The machines run by this transmission consist of the looms of Rieter &  Co., of Winterthur; the large flour mill and lift of A. Millot & Co.;  the flour milling machinery of Frederick Wegmann & Co., of Zurich; the  brick and tile making machines of the Rorschach foundries; and the  looms of Messrs. Houget & Teston, of Verviers, in the Belgian section.  A 15 horse power two-pole Oerlikon dynamo is also run by a belt from  the main shaft, and generates power to drive a motor of similar type  in the Swiss section of the upper gallery. This runs a length of  countershafting supplying power to three silk-weaving machines  constructed by Benninger Freres; six weaving machines from the Ruti  works, near Zurich; and one knitting machine exhibited by Edward  Dubied & Co., of Couvet.    The dynamo and motor are connected to the main cable by switches of  the type shown in Fig. 5. These are specially designed to destroy the  extra current on breaking circuit by the formation of an arc which  gradually increases the resistance till the break occurs, rendering it  less sudden. One wire passes through the handle and makes contact with  the springs, and the other is attached to the clamp in which the  carbon rod is held. The current is made to enter at the carbon rod, so  that the arcs formed cause consumption of the carbon. A magnetic  cut-out--Fig. 6--is also provided to each machine; this consists of an  electro-magnet, through which the main current passes, provided with  side pole pieces. A flat soft iron plate armature is hinged so as to  come up against the pole pieces when attracted. When the current is  not sufficiently strong to cause the plate to be attracted, a hole in  the center of the latter engages over a small projection in the top of  a weighted arm hinged in the center of the board, and keeps it  upright. If now the current exceeds the limits of safety to the  machine, due to a too heavy load being thrown on, the armature is  attracted and releases the vertical arm, which falls over and enters  with considerable force between the two spring contacts below. These  contacts are connected to the field terminals, which are, therefore,  short-circuited, and prevent the dynamo generating any current. A  retractile spring can be adjusted to cause cut-off at any required  current. These details are indicated in our illustrations mounted on  their respective switch boards.    Since the erection of plant by these works at Solothurn for  transmitting 50 horse power five miles distant, which attracted so  much interest some time ago, several important works have been carried  out. Among these we may mention a 280 horse power transmission at 11/2  kilom. distance to a cotton mill at Derendingen in Switzerland, a 250  horse power transmission at 1/2 kilom. distance, carried out for Gaetano  Rossi at Piovene in Italy, and a 300 horse transmission at 6 kilom.  distance installed for Giovanni Rossi, in which the power is given off  at two different stations.--_The Engineer._           *       *       *       *       *          THE ADER FLOURISH OF TRUMPETS.      Although telephonic novelties are not numerous at the Universal  Exposition, telephony--that quite young branch of electric science--is  daily the object of curious and interesting experiments which we must  make known to our readers, a large number of whom were not yet born to  scientific life when the experiments were made for the first time at  Paris in 1881; and it is proper to congratulate the Societe Generale  des Telephones on having repeated them in 1889 to the great  satisfaction of the rising generation.    We allude to the Ader system of telephonic transmissions of sounds in  such a way that they can be heard by an audience.    The essential parts of this"]]]
