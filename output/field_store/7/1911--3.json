Of this there is only one specimen, a panegyric (for such in  most cases is the Persian _qasidah_) on Napoleon, and, as may therefore  be imagined, of purely Occidental content.[141]           *       *       *       *       *    Of Platen's translations from Hafid we need not speak here. But we must  call attention to the attempt which he made to translate from Nidami's  _Iskandar Namah_ in the original _mutaqarib_-metre. The first eight  couplets of the invocation are thus rendered, and in spite of the great  difficulty attending the use of this metre in a European language, the  rendering must be pronounced fairly successful. It is also faithful, as  a comparison with the original shows. We cite the first two couplets  from the Persian:         [Arabic]       [Arabic]         \"O God, world-sovereignty is Thine! From us comes service, Godhead       is Thine. The Protection of high and low Thou art! Everything is       nonexistent; whatever is, Thou art.\"[142]    Of other Oriental poems, not translations, we notice \"Parsenlied,\"  dating from the year 1819, when Goethe's _Divan_ appeared, and it is  quite possible that the _Parsi Nameh_ of that work suggested to Platen  the composition of his poem.[143] His best known ballad, \"Harmosan,\"  written in 1830, has a Persian warrior for its hero. The source for the  poem is probably Gibbon's _Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire_ (chap.  li.)[144]      FOOTNOTES:    [132] We might say into European literature. The only previous attempts,  as far as we know, to reproduce this form were made by Jones, who  translated a ghazal of Jami (Works, vol. ii. p. 501) into English, and  by a certain Tommaso Chabert, who translated several ghazals of Jami  into Italian (Fundgruben, vol. i. pp. 16-19).

His Oriental Studies--Introduces the Ghasele--Oestliche Rosen;        Imitations of Hafid--Erbauliches und        Beschauliches--Morgenlaendische Sagen und Geschichten--Brahmanische        Erzaehlungen--Die Weisheit des Brahmanen--Other Oriental        Poems.      When speaking of the introduction of the _gazal_-form into German  literature mention was made of the name of the man who is unquestionably  the central figure in the great Oriental movement which is occupying our  attention. Combining the genius of the poet with the learning of the  scholar, Rueckert was preeminently fitted to be the literary mediator  between the East and the West. And his East was not restricted, as  Goethe's or Platen's, to Arabia and Persia, but included India and even  China. He is not only a devotee to the mystic poetry of Rumi and the  joyous strain of Hafid, but he is above all the German Brahman, who by  masterly translations and imitations made the treasures of Sanskrit  poetry a part of the literary wealth of his own country. To his  productivity as poet and translator the long list of his works bears  conclusive testimony. In this investigation, however, we shall confine  ourselves to those of his original poems which are Oriental in origin or  subject-matter. A discussion of the numerous translations cannot be  undertaken in the limited space at our disposal.    Like Goethe and Platen, Rueckert also owed to Hammer the impulse to  Oriental study. His meeting with the famous Orientalist at Vienna, in  1818,[145] decided his future career. He at once took up the study of  Arabic, Persian and Sanskrit, and with such success that in a few years  he became one of the foremost Orientalists in Europe.    The first fruit of these studies were the _Gaselen_ which appeared in  the _Taschenbuch fuer Damen_, 1821, the first poems of this form in  German literature.[146] They have been generally regarded as  translations from the _divan_ of Rumi, but this is true of only a  limited number; and even these were probably not taken directly from the  Persian, but from the versions given by Hammer in his _Redekuenste_.[147]  As a matter of fact, only twenty-eight--less than one-half of the  _Gaselen_,--can be identified with originals in Hammer's book, and a  comparison of these with their models shows with what freedom the latter  were handled.[148] Furthermore in the opening poem, (a version of _Red._  p. 187, \"So lang die Sonne\") the last couplet:        Dschelaleddin nennt sich das Licht im Ost,      Dess Wiederschein euch zeiget mein Gedicht,    is original with Rueckert, and clearly shows that he himself did not  pretend to offer real translations. The majority of poems are simply  original _gazals_ in Rumi's manner.        Dschelaleddin, im Osten warst du der Salbenhaendler,      Ich habe nun die Bude im Westen aufgeschlagen.[149]    These lines, we believe, define very well the attitude which the poet of  the West assumed toward his mystic brother in the East.           *       *       *       *       *    The series of _Ghaselen_ signed Freimund and dated 1822 (third series in  our edition) are not characteristically Persian. Hence we proceed at  once to a consideration of the fourth series (p. 253 seq.), which we  shall discuss together with the poems collected under the title of  _Oestliche Rosen_ (p. 289 seq.) from which they differ in nothing but the  form. They were, besides, a part of the _Oestliche Rosen_ as published  originally at Leipzig, 1822.    These poems are free reproductions or variations of Hafizian themes and  motives. The spirit of revelry and intoxication finds here a much wilder  and more bacchanalian expression than in the _Divan_ of Goethe or the  _Ghaselen_ of Platen. _Carpe diem_ is the sum and substance of the  philosophy of such poems as \"Einladung\" (p. 287) and \"Lebensgnuege\" (p.  293); their note is in thorough accord with Hafid, when he exclaims  (H. 525. 7):         [Arabic]       [Arabic]    \"to me, who worship the beloved, do not mention anything else; for  except for her and my cup of wine, I care for none.\" We are admonished  to leave alone idle talk on how and why (\"Im Fruehlingsthau,\" p. 261),  for as Hafid says (H. 487. 11): \"Our existence is an enigma, whereof  the investigation is fraud and fable.\" The tavern is celebrated with as  much enthusiasm (e.g. \"Das Weinhaus,\" p. 290) as the [Arabic] to which  Hafid was destined by God (H. 492. 1). Monks and preachers are scored  mercilessly (e.g. \"Der Bussprediger,\" p. 255; \"Dem Prediger,\" p. 295) as  in H. 430. 7:         [Arabic]       [Arabic]         \"The admonisher spoke tauntingly: Wine is forbidden, do not drink!       I said: On my eye (be it); I do not lend my ear to every ass.\"    The characteristic Persian images and rhetorical figures, familiar to us  from Platen, are also found here in still greater variety and number.  Thus to mention some new ones, the soul is likened to a bird (p. 270,  No. 29, cf. H. 427. 5: [Arabic]); the cypress is invoked to come to the  brook (p. 336, cf. H. 108. 3: [Arabic] \"the place  of the straight cypress is on the bank of the brook\"); the rose-bush  glows with the fire of Moses (\"Gnosis,\" p. 350, cf. H. 517. 2: [Arabic]  [Arabic] \"the rose displays the fire of Musa\"); _Hafis_ is an  idol-worshipper (p. 305, \"Liebesandacht,\" cf. H. 439. 6, where  [Arabic] \"the idol of sweet motions\" is addressed). We meet also the  striking Oriental conception of the dust of the dead being converted  into cups and pitchers. In \"Von irdischer Herrlichkeit\" (p. 257) the  character \"der alte Wirth\" is the _pir_ of H. 4. 10 et passim, and  when speaking of the fate of Jamsid, Sulaiman and Ka'us Kai, he says:        Von des Glueckrads hoechstem Gipfel warf der Tod in Staub sie,      Und ein Toepfer nahm den Staub in Dienst des Toepferrades.      Diesen Becher formt' er draus, und glueht' ihn aus im Feuer.      Nimm! aus edlen Schaedeln trink und deiner Lust nicht schad' es!    This very striking thought, as is well known, is extremely common in  Persian poetry. To cite from Hafid (H. 459. 4):         [Arabic]       [Arabic]         \"The day when the wheel (of fate) from our dust will make jugs,       take care! make our skull (lit. the cup of the head) full of       wine.\"[150]    Some of the poems are versions, more or less free, of Hafid--passages,  e.g. \"Die verloren gegangene Schoene\" (p. 290, H. 268), \"An die Schoene\"  (p. 308, H. 160, couplets 2 and 5 being omitted), \"Beschwichtigter  Zweifel\" (p. 310, H. 430. 6), \"Das harte Wort\" (p. 350, H. 77. 1 and  2). Sometimes a theme is taken from Hafid and then expanded, as in \"Die  Busse\" (p. 346), where the first verse is a version of H. 384. 1, the  rest being original.    Of course, reminiscences of Hafid are bound to be frequent. We shall  point out only a few instances. \"Nicht solltest du so, O Rose, versaeumen  die Nachtigall\" (\"Stimme der Sehnsucht,\" p. 256) is inspired by a verse  like H. 292."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17959"],[0,"The Hand of Fu-Manchu (#10)"],[1,"you know best,\" he said, bowed to us both, and retired.    When the door was closed--    \"You see, Petrie,\" said Smith, beginning to stuff tobacco into his  briar, \"if we are ever short of funds, here's something\"--pointing to  the Tulun-Nur box upon the table--\"which would retrieve our fallen  fortunes.\"    He uttered one of his rare, boyish laughs, and began to pace the  carpet again, his gaze always set upon our strange treasure. What did  it contain?    The manner in which it had come into our possession suggested that it  might contain something of the utmost value to the Yellow group. For  we knew the house of John Ki to be, if not the head-quarters, certainly  a meeting-place of the mysterious organization the Si-Fan; we knew  that Dr. Fu-Manchu used the place--Dr. Fu-Manchu, the uncanny being  whose existence seemingly proved him immune from natural laws, a  deathless incarnation of evil.    My gaze set upon the box, I wondered anew what strange, dark secrets  it held; I wondered how many murders and crimes greater than murder  blackened its history.    \"Smith,\" I said suddenly, \"now that the mystery of the absence of a  key-hole is explained, I am sorely tempted to essay the task of  opening the coffer. I think it might help us to a solution of the  whole mystery.\"    \"And I think otherwise!\" interrupted my friend grimly. \"In a word,  Petrie, I look upon this box as a sort of hostage by means of which--  who knows--we might one day buy our lives from the enemy.  I have a sort of fancy, call it superstition if you will, that  nothing--not even our miraculous good luck--could save us if once  we ravished its secret.\"    I stared at him amazedly; this was a new phase in his character.    \"I am conscious of something almost like a spiritual unrest,\" he  continued. \"Formerly you were endowed with a capacity for divining  the presence of Fu-Manchu or his agents. Some such second-sight would  appear to have visited me now, and it directs me forcibly to avoid  opening the box.\"    His steps as he paced the floor grew more and more rapid. He  relighted his pipe, which had gone out as usual, and tossed the  match-end into the hearth.    \"To-morrow,\" he said, \"I shall lodge the coffer in a place of greater  security. Come along, Petrie, Weymouth is expecting us at Scotland Yard.\"        CHAPTER XI    IN THE FOG      \"But, Smith,\" I began, as my friend hurried me along the corridor, \"you  are not going to leave the box unguarded?\"    Nayland Smith tugged at my arm, and, glancing at him, I saw him  frowningly shake his head. Utterly mystified, I nevertheless  understood that for some reason he desired me to preserve silence for  the present. Accordingly I said no more until the lift brought us down  into the lobby and we had passed out from the New Louvre Hotel,  crossed the busy thoroughfare and entered the buffet of an  establishment not far distant. My friend having ordered cocktails--    \"And now perhaps you will explain to me the reason for your mysterious  behavior?\" said I.    Smith, placing my glass before me, glanced about him to right and left,  and having satisfied himself that his words could not be overheard--    \"Petrie,\" he whispered, \"I believe we are spied upon at the New Louvre.\"    \"What!\"    \"There are spies of the Si-Fan--of Fu-Manchu--amongst the hotel  servants! We have good reason to believe that Dr. Fu-Manchu at one  time was actually in the building, and we have been compelled to draw  attention to the state of the electric fitting in our apartments, which  enables any one in the corridor above to spy upon us.\"    \"Then why do you stay?\"    \"For a very good reason, Petrie, and the same that prompts me to  retain the Tulun-Nur box in my own possession rather than to deposit  it in the strong-room of my bank.\"    \"I begin to understand.\"    \"I trust you do, Petrie; it is fairly obvious. Probably the plan is a  perilous one, but I hope, by laying myself open to attack, to  apprehend the enemy--perhaps to make an important capture.\"    Setting down my glass, I stared in silence at Smith.    \"I will anticipate your remark,\" he said, smiling dryly. \"I am aware  that I am not entitled to expose _you_ to these dangers. It is _my_  duty and I must perform it as best I can; you, as a volunteer, are  perfectly entitled to withdraw.\"    As I continued silently to stare at him, his expression changed; the  gray eyes grew less steely, and presently, clapping his hand upon my  shoulder in his impulsive way--    \"Petrie!\" he cried, \"you know I had no intention of hurting your  feelings, but in the circumstances it was impossible for me to say less.\"    \"You have said enough, Smith,\" I replied shortly. \"I beg of you to say  no more.\"    He gripped my shoulder hard, then plunged his hand into his pocket and  pulled out the blackened pipe.    \"We see it through together, then, though God knows whither it will  lead us.\"    \"In the first place,\" I interrupted, \"since you have left the chest  unguarded----\"    \"I locked the door.\"    \"What is a mere lock where Fu-Manchu is concerned?\"    Nayland Smith laughed almost gaily.    \"Really, Petrie,\" he cried, \"sometimes I cannot believe that you mean  me to take you seriously. Inspector Weymouth has engaged the room  immediately facing our door, and no one can enter or leave the suite  unseen by him.\"    \"Inspector Weymouth?\"    \"Oh! for once he has stooped to a disguise: spectacles, and a muffler  which covers his face right up to the tip of his nose. Add to this a  prodigious overcoat and an asthmatic cough, and you have a picture of  Mr. Jonathan Martin, the occupant of room No. 239.\"    I could not repress a smile upon hearing this description.    \"No. 239,\" continued Smith, \"contains two beds, and Mr. Martin's  friend will be joining him there this evening.\"    Meeting my friend's questioning glance, I nodded comprehendingly.    \"Then what part do _I_ play?\"    \"Ostensibly we both leave town this evening,\" he explained; \"but I  have a scheme whereby you will be enabled to remain behind. We shall  thus have one watcher inside and two out.\"    \"It seems almost absurd,\" I said incredulously, \"to expect any member  of the Yellow group to attempt anything in a huge hotel like the New  Louvre, here in the heart of London!\"    Nayland Smith, having lighted his pipe, stretched his arms and stared  me straight in the face.    \"Has Fu-Manchu never attempted outrage, murder, in the heart of London  before?\" he snapped.    The words were sufficient. Remembering black episodes of the past (one  at least of them had occurred not a thousand yards from the very spot  upon which we now stood), I knew that I had spoken folly.    Certain arrangements were made then, including a visit to Scotland  Yard; and a plan--though it sounds anomalous--at once elaborate and  simple, was put into execution in the dusk of the evening.    London remained in the grip of fog, and when we passed along the  corridor communicating with our apartments, faint streaks of yellow  vapor showed in the light of the lamp suspended at the further end.  I knew that Nayland Smith suspected the presence of some spying  contrivance in our rooms, although I was unable to conjecture how this  could have been managed without the connivance of the management. In  pursuance of his idea, however, he extinguished the lights a moment  before we actually quitted the suite. Just within the door he helped  me to remove the somewhat conspicuous check traveling-coat which I  wore. With this upon his arm he opened the door and stepped out into  the corridor.    As the door slammed upon his exit, I heard him cry: \"Come along,  Petrie! we have barely five minutes to catch our train.\"    Detective Carter of New Scotland Yard had joined him at the threshold,  and muffled up in the gray traveling-coat was now hurrying with Smith  along the corridor and out of the hotel. Carter, in build and features,  was not unlike me, and I did not doubt that any one who might be  spying upon our movements would be deceived by this device.    In the darkness of the apartment I stood listening to the retreating  footsteps in the corridor. A sense of loneliness and danger assailed  me. I knew that Inspector Weymouth was watching and listening from the  room immediately opposite; that he held Smith's key; that I could  summon him to my assistance, if necessary, in a matter of seconds.    Yet, contemplating the vigil that lay before me in silence and  darkness, I cannot pretend that my frame of mind was buoyant. I could  not smoke; I must make no sound.    As pre-arranged, I cautiously removed my boots, and as cautiously  tiptoed across the carpet and seated myself in an arm-chair. I  determined there to await the arrival of Mr. Jonathan Martin's friend,  which I knew could not now be long delayed.    The clocks were striking eleven when he arrived, and in the perfect  stillness of that upper corridor. I heard the bustle which heralded  his approach, heard the rap upon the door opposite, followed by a  muffled \"Come in\" from Weymouth. Then, as the door was opened, I heard  the sound of a wheezy cough.    A strange cracked voice (which, nevertheless, I recognized for Smith's)  cried, \"Hullo, Martin!--cough no better?\"    Upon that the door was closed again, and as the retreating footsteps  of the servant died away, complete silence--that peculiar silence  which comes with fog--descended once more upon the upper part of the  New Louvre Hotel.        CHAPTER XII    THE VISITANT      That first hour of watching, waiting, and listening in the lonely  quietude passed drearily; and with the passage of every quarter--  signalized by London's muffled clocks--my mood became increasingly  morbid. I peopled the silent rooms opening out of that wherein I sat,  with stealthy, murderous figures; my imagination painted hideous  yellow faces upon the draperies, twitching yellow hands protruding  from this crevice and that. A score of times I started"]]]
