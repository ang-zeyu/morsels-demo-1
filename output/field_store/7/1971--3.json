Maximilian was, if he pleased, comprehended in Henry's  treaty; but he disdained to be in any respect beholden to an ally, of  whom, he thought, he had reason to complain: he made a separate peace  with France, and obtained restitution of Artois, Franche Compte, and  Charolois, which had been ceded as the dowry of his daughter when she  was affianced to the king of France.         * Bacon, p. 605. Polyd Virg. p. 586.    The peace concluded between England and France was the more likely to  continue, because Charles, full of ambition and youthful hopes, bent  all his attention to the side of Italy, and soon after undertook the  conquest of Naples; an enterprise which Henry regarded with the greater  indifference, as Naples lay remote from him, and France had never, in  any age, been successful in that quarter. The king's authority was  fully established at home; and every rebellion which had been attempted  against him, had hitherto tended only to confound his enemies, and  consolidate his power and influence. His reputation for policy and  conduct was daily augmenting; his treasures had increased even from the  most unfavorable events; the hopes of all pretenders to his throne were  cut off, as well by his marriage as by the issue which it had brought  him. In this prosperous situation, the king had reason to flatter  himself with the prospect of durable peace and tranquillity; but his  inveterate and indefatigable enemies, whom he had wantonly provoked,  raised him an adversary, who long kept him in inquietude, and sometimes  even brought him into danger.    The duchess of Burgundy, full of resentment for the depression of her  family and its partisans, rather irritated than discouraged by the ill  success of her past enterprises, was determined at least to disturb that  government which she found it so difficult to subvert. By means of  her emissaries, she propagated a report that her nephew, Richard  Plantagenet, duke of York, had escaped from the Tower when his elder  brother was murdered, and that he still lay somewhere concealed: and  finding this rumor, however improbable, to be greedily received by the  people, she had been looking out for some young man proper to personate  that unfortunate prince.    There was one Osbec, or Warbec, a renegade Jew of Tournay, who had been  carried by some business to London in the reign of Edward IV., and had  there a son born to him. Having had opportunities of being known to  the king, and obtaining his favor, he prevailed with that prince, whose  manners were very affable, to stand godfather to his son, to whom  he gave the name of Peter, corrupted, after the Flemish manner, into  Peterkin, or Perkin. It was by some believed that Edward, among his  amorous adventures, had a secret commerce with Warbec's wife; and people  thence accounted for that resemblance which was afterwards remarked  between young Perkin and that monarch.[*]         * Bacon, p. 606.    Some years after the birth of this child, Warbec returned to Tournay;  where Perkin, his son, did not long remain, but by different accidents,  was carried from place to place, and his birth and fortunes became  thereby unknown, and difficult to be traced by the most diligent  inquiry. The variety of his adventures had happily favored the natural  versatility and sagacity of his genius; and he seemed to be a youth  perfectly fitted to act any part, or assume any character. In this light  he had been represented to the duchess of Burgundy, who, struck with the  concurrence of so many circumstances suited to her purpose, desired to  be made acquainted with the man, on whom she already began to ground  her hopes of success. She found him to exceed her most sanguine  expectations; so comely did he appear in his person, so graceful in his  air, so courtly in his address, so full of docility and good sense in  his behavior and conversation. The lessons necessary to be taught him,  in order to his personating the duke of York, were soon learned by a  youth of such quick apprehension; but as the season seemed not then  favorable for their enterprise, Margaret, in order the better to conceal  him, sent him, under the care of Lady Brampton into Portugal, where he  remained a year unknown to all the world.    The war, which was then ready to break out between France and England,  seemed to afford a proper opportunity for the discovery of this new  phenomenon; and Ireland, which still retained its attachments to  the house of York, was chosen as the proper place for his first  appearance.[*] He landed at Cork; and immediately assuming the name of  Richard Plantagenet, drew to him partisans among that credulous people.  He wrote letters to the earls of Desmond and Kildare, inviting them to  join his party: he dispersed every where the strange intelligence of  his escape from the cruelty of his uncle Richard: and men, fond of every  thing new and wonderful, began to make him the general subject of their  discourse, and even the object of their favor.    The news soon reached France; and Charles, prompted by the secret  solicitations of the duchess of Burgundy, and the intrigues of one  Frion, a secretary of Henry's, who had deserted his service, sent Perkin  an invitation to repair to him at Paris. He received him with all the  marks of regard due to the duke of York; settled on him a handsome  pension, assigned him magnificent lodgings, and in order to provide at  once for his dignity and security, gave him a guard for his person,  of which Lord Congresal accepted the office of captain. The French  courtiers readily embraced a fiction which their sovereign thought  it his interest to adopt: Perkin, both by his deportment and personal  qualities, supported the prepossession which was spread abroad of his  royal pedigree: and the whole kingdom was full of the accomplishments,  as well as the singular adventures and misfortunes, of the young  Plantagenet. Wonders of this nature are commonly augmented at a  distance. From France the admiration and credulity diffused themselves  into England: Sir George Nevil,[*] Sir John Taylor, and above a hundred  gentlemen more, came to Paris, in order to offer their services to the  supposed duke of York, and to share his fortunes: and the impostor had  now the appearance of a court attending him, and began to entertain  hopes of final success in his undertakings.         * Polyd Virg. p. 589.    When peace was concluded between France and England at Estaples, Henry  applied to have Perkin put into his hands; but Charles, resolute not  to betray a young man, of whatever birth, whom he had invited into his  kingdom, would agree only to dismiss him. The pretended Richard retired  to the duchess of Burgundy, and craving her protection and assistance,  offered to lay before her all the proofs of that birth to which he laid  claim. The princess affected ignorance of his pretensions; even put  on the appearance of distrust: and having, as she said, been already  deceived by Simnel, she was determined never again to be seduced by  any impostor. She desired before all the world to be instructed in his  reasons for assuming the name which he bore; seemed to examine every  circumstance with the most scrupulous nicety; put many particular  questions to him; affected astonishment at his answers; and at last,  after long and severe scrutiny, burst out into joy and admiration at  his wonderful deliverance, embraced him as her nephew, the true image of  Edward, the sole heir of the Plantagenets, and the legitimate successor  to the English throne.    {1493.} She immediately assigned him an equipage suited to his pretended  birth; appointed him a guard of thirty halberdiers; engaged every one to  pay court to him; and on all occasions honored him with the appellation  of the White Rose of England. The Flemings, moved by the authority which  Margaret, both from her rank and personal character, enjoyed among them,  readily adopted the fiction of Perkin's royal descent: no surmise of his  true birth was as yet heard of little contradiction was made to the  prevailing opinion: and the English, from their great communication with  the Low Countries, were every day more and more prepossessed in favor of  the impostor.    It was not the populace alone of England that gave credit to Perkin's  pretensions. Men of the highest birth and quality, disgusted at Henry's  government, by which they found the nobility depressed, began to turn  their eyes towards the new claimant; and some of them even entered into  a correspondence with him. Lord Fitzwater, Sir Simon Mountfort, Sir  Thomas Thwaites, betrayed their inclination towards him: Sir William  Stanley himself, lord chamberlain, who had been so active in raising  Henry to the throne, moved either by blind credulity or a restless  ambition, entertained the project of a revolt in favor of his enemy.[*]           * Bacon, p. 608.    Sir Robert Clifford and William Barley were still more open in their  measures: they went over to Flanders, were introduced by the duchess of  Burgundy to the acquaintance of Perkin, and made him a tender of their  services. Clifford wrote back to England, that he knew perfectly the  person of Richard, duke of York, that this young man was undoubtedly  that prince himself, and that no circumstance of his story was exposed  to the least difficulty. Such positive intelligence, conveyed by a  person of rank and character, was sufficient with many to put the matter  beyond question, and excited the attention and wonder even of the most  indifferent. The whole nation was held in suspense; a regular conspiracy  was formed against the king's authority, and a correspondence settled  between the malecontents in Flanders and those in England.    The king was informed of all these particulars; but agreeably to  his character, which was both cautious and resolute, he proceeded  deliberately,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19214"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol. I., Part D. (#10)"],[1,"gave her just reason to expect. She  was still a Papist, and though she published, soon after her arrival, a  proclamation enjoining every one to submit to the established religion,  the preachers and their adherents could neither be reconciled to a  person polluted with so great an abomination, nor lay aside their  jealousies of her future conduct. It was with great difficulty she could  obtain permission for saying mass in her own chapel; and had not the  people apprehended, that if she had here met with a refusal, she would  instantly have returned to France, the zealots never would have granted  her even that small indulgence. The cry was, \"Shall we suffer that idol  to be again erected within the realm?\" It was asserted in the pulpit,  that one mass was more terrible than ten thousand armed men landed  to invade the kingdom:[*] Lord Lindesey, and the gentlemen of Fife,  exclaimed, \"that the idolater should die the death;\" such was their  expression. One that carried tapers for the ceremony of that worship was  attacked and insulted in the court of the palace. And if Lord James and  some popular leaders had not interposed, the most dangerous uproar was  justly apprehended from the ungoverned fury of the multitude.[**]         * Knox, p. 287.         ** Knox, p. 284, 285, 287. Spotswood, p. 179.    The usual prayers in the churches were to this purpose: that God would  turn the queen's heart, which was obstinate against him and his truth;  or if his holy will be otherwise, that he would strengthen the hearts  and hands of the elect, stoutly to oppose the rage of all tyrants.[*]  Nay, it was openly called in question, whether that princess, being an  idolatress, was entitled to any authority, even in civil matters.[**]    The helpless queen was every moment exposed to contumely, which she bore  with benignity and patience. Soon after her arrival, she dined in the  Castle of Edinburgh; and it was there contrived, that a boy, six years  of age, should be let down from the roof, and should present her with  a Bible, a Psalter, and the keys of the castle. Lest she should be at a  loss to understand this insult on her as a Papist, all the decorations  expressed the burning of Corah, Dathan, and Abiram, and other  punishments inflicted by God upon idolatry.[***] The town council  of Edinburgh had the assurance, from their own authority, to issue a  proclamation banishing from their district \"all the wicked rabble of  Antichrist the pope, such as priests, monks, friars, together with  adulterers and fornicators.\"[****] And because the privy council  suspended the magistrates for their insolence, the passionate  historians[v] of that age have inferred that the queen was engaged, by  a sympathy of manners, to take adulterers and fornicators under her  protection. It appears probable, that the magistrates were afterwards  reinstated in their office, and that their proclamation was  confirmed.[v*]         * Keith, p. 179.         ** Keith, p. 202.         *** Keith, p. 189.         *** Keith, p. 192.         v   Knox, p. 292. Buchan. lib. xvii. c. 20. Haynes, vol. i.       p. 372.         v*  Keith, p. 202.    But all the insolence of the people was inconsiderable in comparison  of that which was exercised by the clergy and the preachers, who took  a pride in vilifying, even to her face, this amiable princess. The  assembly of the church framed an address, in which, after telling her  that her mass was a bastard service of God, the fountain of all impiety,  and the source of every evil which abounded in the realm, they expressed  their hopes, that she would ere this time have preferred truth to her  own preconceived opinion, and have renounced her religion, which, they  assured her, was nothing but abomination and vanity. They said, that the  present abuses of government were so enormous, that if a speedy remedy  were not provided, God would not fail in his anger to strike the head  and the tail, the disobedient prince and sinful people. They  required, that severe punishment should be inflicted on adulterers  and fornicators. And they concluded with demanding for themselves some  addition both of power and property.[*]    The ringleader in all these insults on majesty was John Knox; who  possessed an uncontrolled authority in the church and even in the civil  affairs of the nation, and who triumphed in the contumelious usage of  his sovereign. His usual appellation for the queen was Jezebel; and  though she endeavored by the most gracious condescension to win his  favor, all her insinuations could gain nothing on his obdurate heart.  She promised him access to her whenever he demanded it; and she even  desired him, if he found her blamable in any thing, to reprehend her  freely in private, rather than vilify her in the pulpit before the whole  people: but he plainly told her, that he had a public ministry intrusted  to him; that if she would come to church, she should there hear the  gospel of truth, and that it was not his business to apply to every  individual, nor had he leisure for that occupation.[**] The political  principles of the man, which he communicated to his brethren, were as  full of sedition, as his theological were of rage and bigotry. Though  he once condescended so far as to tell the queen that he would submit to  her, in the same manner as Paul did to Nero,[***] he remained not long  in this dutiful strain. He said to her, that \"Samuel feared not to slay  Agag the fat and delicate king of Amalek, whom King Saul had saved;  neither spared Elias Jezebel's false prophets, and Baal's priests,  though King Ahab was present. Phineas,\" added he, \"was no magistrate;  yet feared he not to strike Cosbi and Zimri in the very act of filthy  fornication. And so, madam, your grace may see that others than chief  magistrates may lawfully inflict punishment on such crimes as are  condemned by the law of God.\"[****] Knox had formerly, during the reign  of Mary of England, written a book against female succession to the  crown: the title of it is, \"The first blast of the trumpet against  the monstrous regimen of women.\" He was too proud either to recant the  tenets of this book, or even to apologize for them; and his conduct  showed that he thought no more civility than loyalty due to any of the  female sex.         * Knox, p. 311, 312.         ** Knox, p. 310.         *** Knox, p. 288.         **** Knox, p. 326.    The whole life of Mary was, from the demeanor of these men, filled with  bitterness and sorrow. This rustic apostle scruples not, in his history,  to inform us, that he once treated her with such severity, that she lost  all command of temper, and dissolved in tears before him: yet so far  from being moved with youth, and beauty, and royal dignity reduced to  that condition, he persevered in his insolent reproofs; and when he  relates this incident, he discovers a visible pride and satisfaction  in his own conduct.[*] The pulpits had become mere scenes of railing  against the vices of the court; among which were always noted as  the principal, feasting, finery, dancing, balls, and whoredom, their  necessary attendant.[**] Some ornaments, which the ladies at that time  wore upon their petticoats, excited mightily the indignation of the  preachers; and they affirmed, that such vanity would provoke God's  vengeance not only against these foolish women, but against the whole  realm.[***]    Mary, whose age, condition, and education, invited her to liberty and  cheerfulness, was curbed in all amusements by the absurd severity of  these reformers; and she found every moment reason to regret her leaving  that country, from whose manners she had in her early youth received  the first impressions.[****] Her two uncles, the duke of Aumale and the  grand prior, with the other French nobility, soon took leave of her: the  marquis of Elbeuf remained some time longer; but after his departure,  she was left to the society of her own subjects; men unacquainted  with the pleasures of conversation, ignorant of arts and civility, and  corrupted, beyond their usual rusticity, by a dismal fanaticism, which  rendered them incapable of all humanity or improvement. Though Mary  had made no attempt to restore the ancient religion, her Popery was a  sufficient crime: though her behavior was hitherto irreproachable, and  her manners sweet and engaging, her gayety and ease were interpreted as  signs of dissolute vanity. And to the harsh and preposterous usage which  this princess met with may, in part, be ascribed those errors of her  subsequent conduct which seemed so little of a piece with the general  tenor of her character.         * Knox, p. 332, 333.         ** Knox, p. 322.         *** Knox, p. 330.         **** Knox, p. 294    There happened to the marquis of Elbeuf, before his departure, an  adventure which, though frivolous, might enable him to give Mary's  friends in France a melancholy idea of her situation. This nobleman,  with the earl of Bothwell and some other young courtiers, had been  engaged, after a debauch, to pay a visit to a woman called Alison Craig,  who was known to be liberal of her favors; and because they were denied  admittance, they broke the windows, thrust open the door, and committed  some disorders in searching for the damsel. It happened that the  assembly of the church was sitting at that time, and they immediately  took the matter under their cognizance. In conjunction with several  of the nobility, they presented an address to the queen, which was  introduced with this awful prelude: \"To the queen's majesty, and to her  secret and great council, her grace's faithful and obedient subjects,  the professors of Christ Jesus's holy evangil, wish the spirit of  righteous judgment.\" The tenor of the petition was that the fear of  God, the duty which they owed her grace, and the terrible threatenings  denounced by God against every city or country where horrible crimes  were openly"]]]
