The little that we know of his life reveals  an energy and steadfastness of purpose quite unusual; he proceeded  slowly but surely in his undertakings, and if he did not succeed in  extending his domains as far as he had hoped at the beginning of his  campaigns against the Medes, he at all events never lost any of the  provinces he had acquired. Under his auspices agriculture flourished,  and manufactures attained a degree of perfection hitherto unknown.    [Illustration: 053.jpg A LYDIAN FUNERY COUCH]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from Choisy.    None of the vases in gold, silver, or wrought-iron, which he dedicated  and placed among the treasures of the Greek temples, has come down to  us, but at rare intervals ornaments of admirable workmanship are found  in the Lydian tombs. Those now in the Louvre exhibit, in addition to  human figures somewhat awkwardly treated, heads of rams, bulls, and  griffins of a singular delicacy and faithfulness to nature. These  examples reveal a blending of Grecian types and methods of production  with those of Egypt or Chaldaea, the Hellenic being predominant,* and  the same combination of heterogeneous elements must have existed in the  other domains of industrial art---in the dyed and embroidered stuffs,**  the vases,*** and the furniture.****         * The ornaments, of which we have now no specimens, but only       the original moulds cut in serpentine, betray imitation of       Assyria and Chaldaea.           ** The custom of clothing themselves in dyed and embroidered       stuffs was one of the effeminate habits with which the poet       Xenophanes reproached the Ionians as having been learned       from their Lydian neighbours.         *** M. Perrot points out that one of the vases discovered by       G. Dennis at Bintepe is an evident imitation of the Egyptian       and Phoenician chevroned glasses. The shape of the vase is       one of those found represented, with the same decoration, on       Egyptian monuments subsequent to the Middle Empire, where       the chevroned lines seem to be derived from the undulations       of ribbon-alabaster.         **** The stone funerary couches which have been discovered       in Lydian tombs are evidently copied from pieces of wooden       furniture similarly arranged and decorated.    [Illustration: 054a.jpg LYDIAN COIN BEARING A RUNNING FOX]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a specimen in the Cabinet des       Medailles: a stater of electrum weighing 14.19 grammes.         [These illustrations are larger than the original pieces.--Tr.]    [Illustration: 054b.jpg LYDIAN COIN WITH A HARE]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a coin in the _Cabinet des       Medailles._    Lydia, inheriting the traditions of Phrygia, and like that state  situated on the border of two worlds, allied moreover with Egypt as well  as Babylon, and in regular communication with the Delta, borrowed from  each that which fell in with her tastes or seemed likely to be most  helpful to her in her commercial relations. As the country produced  gold in considerable quantities, and received still more from extraneous  sources, the precious metal came soon to be employed as a means of  exchange under other conditions than those which had hitherto prevailed.  Besides acting as commission agents and middle-men for the disposal  of merchandise at Sardes, Ephesus, Miletus, Clazomenaa, and all the  maritime cities, the Lydians performed at the same time the functions  of pawnbrokers, money-changers, and bankers, and they were ready to  make loans to private individuals as well as to kings. Obliged by the  exigencies of their trade to cut up the large gold ingots into sections  sufficiently small to represent the smallest values required in daily  life, they did not at first impress upon these portions any stamp as  a guarantee of the exact weight or the purity of the metal; they were  estimated like the _tabonu_ of the Egyptians, by actual weighing on the  occasion of each business transaction.    [Illustration: 055.jpg LYDIAN COINS WITH A LION AND LION'S HEAD]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a coin in the Cabinet des       Medailles.    The idea at length occurred to them to impress each of these pieces with  a common stamp, serving, like the trade-marks employed by certain guilds  of artisans, to testify at once to their genuineness and their exact  weight: in a word, they were the inventors of money. The most ancient  coinage of their mint was like a flattened sphere, more or less ovoid,  in form: it consisted at first of electrum, and afterwards of smelted  gold, upon which parallel striae or shallow creases were made by a  hammer. There were two kinds of coinage, differing considerably from  each other; one consisted of the heavy stater, weighing about 14.20  grammes, perhaps of Phoenician origin, the other of the light stater, of  some 10.80 grammes in weight, which doubtless served as money for  the local needs of Lydia: both forms were subdivided into pieces  representing respectively the third, the sixth, the twelfth, and the  twenty-fourth of the value of the original.    [Illustration: 056a.jpg COIN BEARING HEAD OF MOUFLON GOAT]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a coin in the Cabinet des       Medailles.    [Illustration: 056b.jpg MONEY OF CROESUS]    The stamp which came to be impressed upon the money was in relief, and  varied with the banker; * when political communities began to follow the  example of individuals, it also bore the name of the city where it was  minted.         * [The best English numismatists do not agree with M.       Babelon's \"banker\" theory. Cf. Barclay V. Head, _Historia       Nummorum_, p. xxxiv.---Tr.]    The type of impression once selected, was little modified for fear of  exciting mistrust among the people, but it was more finely executed and  enlarged so as to cover one of the faces, that which we now call the  _obverse_. Several subjects entered into the composition of the design,  each being impressed by a special punch: thus in the central concavity  we find the figure of a running fox, emblem of Apollo Bassareus, and  in two similar depressions, one above and the other below the central,  appear a horse's or stag's head, and a flower with four petals. Later  on the design was simplified, and contained only one, or at most two  figures--a hare squatting under a tortuous climbing plant, a roaring  lion crouching with its head turned to the left, the grinning muzzle of  a lion, the horned profile of an antelope or mouflon sheep: rosettes and  flowers, included within a square depression, were then used to replace  the stria and irregular lines of the reverse. These first efforts were  without inscriptions; it was not long, however, before there came to be  used, in addition to the figures, legends, from which we sometimes  learn the name of the banker; we read, for instance, \"I am the mark of  Phannes,\" on a stater of electrum struck at Ephesus, with a stag grazing  on the right. We are ignorant as to which of the Lydian kings first made  use of the new invention, and so threw into circulation the gold and  electrum which filled his treasury to overflowing. The ancients say it  was Gyges, but the Gygads of their time cannot be ascribed to him; they  were, without any doubt, simply ingots marked with the stamp of the  banker of the time, and were attributed to Gyges either out of pure  imagination or by mistake.*         * The gold of Gyges is known to us through a passage in       Pollux. Fr. Lenormant attributed to Gyges the coins which       Babelon restores to the banks of Asia Minor. Babelon sees in       the Gygads only \"ingots of gold, struck _possibly_ in the       name of Gyges, capable of being used as coin, doubtless       representing a definitely fixed weight, but still lacking       that ultimate perfection which characterises the coinage of       civilised peoples: from the standpoint of circulation in the       market their shape was defective and inconvenient; their       subdivision did not extend to such small fractions as to       make all payments easy; they were too large and too dear for       easy circulation through many hands.\"    The same must be said of the pieces of money which have been assigned  to his successors, and, even when we find on them traces of writing, we  cannot be sure of their identification; one legend which was considered  to contain the name of Sadyattes has been made out, without producing  conviction, as involving, instead, that of Clazomenae. There is no  certainty until after the time of Alyattes, that is, in the reign of  Croesus. It is, as a fact, to this prince that we owe the fine gold and  silver coins bearing on the obverse a demi-lion couchant confronting  a bull treated similarly.* The two creatures appear to threaten one  another, and the introduction of the lion recalls a tradition regarding  the city of Sardes; it may represent the actual animal which was alleged  to have been begotten by King Meles of one of his concubines, and which  he caused to be carried solemnly round the city walls to render them  impregnable.    Croesus did not succeed to the throne of his father without trouble. His  enemies had not laid down their arms after the Carian campaign, and they  endeavoured to rid themselves of him by all the means in use at Oriental  courts. The Ionian mother of his rival furnished the slave who kneaded  the bread with poison, telling her to mix it with the dough, but the  woman revealed the intended crime to her master, who at once took the  necessary measures to frustrate the plot; later on in life he dedicated  in the temple of Delphi a statue of gold representing the faithful  bread-maker.** The chief of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17330"],[0,"History of Egypt From 330 B.C. To the Present Time, Volume 10 (of 12) (#10)"],[1,"to Egypt, and  Seleucus regained Babylonia. There, by following the example of Ptolemy  in his good treatment of the people, and in leaving them their own laws  and religion, he founded a monarchy, and gave his name to a race of  kings which rivalled even the Lagidae. He raised up again for a short  time the throne of Nebuchadnezzar. But it was only for a short time. The  Chal-dees and Assyrians now yielded the first rank to the Greeks who  had settled among them; and the Greeks were more numerous in the Syrian  portion of his empire. Accordingly Seleucus built a new capital on  the river Orontes, and named it Antioch after his father. Babylon then  yielded the same obedience to this new Greek city that Memphis paid  to Alexandria. Assyria and Babylonia became subject provinces; and  the successors of Seleucus, who came to be known as Selucids, styled  themselves not kings of Babylon but of Syria.    When Antigonus, who was in Phrygia on the other side of his kingdom,  heard that his son Demetrius had been beaten at Gaza, he marched with  all his forces to give battle to Ptolemy. He soon crossed Mount Taurus,  the lofty range which divides Asia Minor from Syria and Mesopotamia, and  joined his camp to that of his son in Upper Syria. But Ptolemy had gone  through life without ever making a hazardous move; not indeed without  ever suffering a loss, but without ever fighting a battle when its loss  would have ruined him, and he did not choose to risk his kingdom against  the far larger forces of Antigonus. Therefore, with the advice of his  council of generals, he levelled the fortifications of Acre, Joppa,  Samaria, and Gaza, and withdrew his forces and treasure into Egypt,  leaving the desert between himself and the army of Antigonus.    Antigonus could not safely attempt to march through the desert in the  face of Ptolemy's army. He had, therefore, first, either to conquer or  gain the friendship of the Nabataeans, a warlike race of Arabs, who held  the north of Arabia; and then he might march by Petra, Mount Sinai, and  the coast of the Red Sea, without being in want of water for his army.  The Nabataeans were the tribe at an earlier time called Edomites. But  they lost that name when they carried it to the southern portion of  Judaea, then called Idumaea; for when the Jews regained Idumaea, they  called these Edomites of the desert Nebaoth or Nabataeans. The Nabataens  professed neutrality between Antigonus and Ptolemy, the two contending  powers; but the mild temper of Ptolemy had so far gained their  friendship that the haughty Antigonus, though he did not refuse their  pledges of peace, secretly made up his mind to conquer them. Petra, the  city of the Nabataeans, is in a narrow valley between steep overhanging  rocks, so difficult of approach that a handful of men could guard it  against the largest army. Not more than two horsemen can ride abreast  through the chasm in the rock by which it is entered from the east,  while the other entrance from the west is down a hillside too steep for  a loaded camel.    [Illustration: 062.jpg ON THE COAST OF THE RED SEA]    The Eastern proverb reminds us that \"Water is the chief thing;\" and  a large stream within the valley, in addition to the strength of the  fortress, made it a favourite resting-place for caravans, which, whether  they were coming from Tyre or Jerusalem, were forced to pass by this  city in their way to the Incense Country of Arabia Felix, or to the  Elanitic Gulf of the Red Sea, and for other caravans from Egypt to Dedam  on the Persian Gulf. These warlike Arabs seem to have received a toll  from the caravans, and they held their rocky fastness unconquered by  the great nations which surrounded them. Their temples and tombs were  cut out of the live rock, and hence the city was by the Jews named  Selah, (the rock), and by the Greeks named Petra, from which last the  country was sometimes called Arabia Petraea.    Antigonus heard that the Nabataeans had left Petra less guarded than  usual, and had gone to a neighbouring fair, probably to meet a caravan  from the south, and to receive spices in exchange for the woollen goods  from Tyre. He therefore sent forward four thousand light-armed foot and  six hundred horse, who overpowered the guard and seized the city. The  Arabs, when they heard of what had happened, returned in the night,  surrounded the place, came upon the Greeks from above, by paths known  only to themselves, and overcame them with such slaughter that, out of  the four thousand six hundred men, only fifty returned to Antigonus to  tell the tale.    The Nabataeans then sent to Antigonus to complain of this crafty attack  being made upon Petra after they had received from him a promise of  friendship. He endeavoured to put them off their guard by disowning the  acts of his general; he sent them home with promises of peace, but at  the same time sent forward his son Demetrius, with four thousand horse  and four thousand foot, to take revenge upon them, and again seize their  city. But the Arabs were this time upon their guard; the nature of  the place was as unfavourable to the Greek arms and warfare as it was  favourable to the Arabs; and these eight thousand men, the flower of the  army, under brave Demetrius, were unable to force their way through the  narrow pass into this remarkable city.    Had Antigonus been master of the sea, he might perhaps have marched  through the desert along the coast of the Mediterranean to Pelusium,  with his fleet to wait upon his army, as Perdiccas had done. But  without this, the only way that he could enter Egypt was through the  neighbourhood of Petra, and then along the same path which the Jews are  supposed to have followed; and the stop thus put upon the invasion of  Egypt by this little city shows us the strength of Ptolemy's eastern  frontier. Antigonus then led his army northward, leaving the kingdom of  Egypt unattacked.    This retreat was followed by a treaty of peace between these generals,  by which it was agreed that each should keep the country that he then  held; that Cassan-der should govern Macedonia until Alexander AEgus, the  son of Alexander the Great, should be of age; that Lysimachus should  keep Thrace, Ptolemy Egypt, and Antigonus Asia Minor and Palestine; and  each wishing to be looked upon as the friend of the soldiers by whom  his power was upheld, and the whole of these wide conquests kept in awe,  added the very unnecessary article, that the Greeks living in each of  these countries should be governed according to their own laws.    All the provinces held by these generals became more or less Greek  kingdoms, yet in no one did so many Greeks settle as in Lower Egypt.  Though the rest of Egypt was governed by Egyptian laws and judges, the  city of Alexandria was under Macedonian law. It did not form part of the  nome of Hermopolites in which it was built. It scarcely formed a part of  Egypt, but was a Greek state in its neighbourhood, holding the Egyptians  in a state of slavery. In that city no Egyptian could live without  feeling himself of a conquered race. He was not admitted to the  privileges of Macedonian citizenship, while they were at once granted to  every Greek, and soon to every Jew, who would settle there.    By the treaty just spoken of, Ptolemy, in the thirteenth year after the  death of Alexander, was left undisputed master of Egypt. During these  years he had not only gained the love of the Egyptians and Alexandrians  by his wise and just government, but had won their respect as a general  by the skill with which he had kept the war at a distance. He had lost  and won battles in Syria, in Asia Minor, in the island of Cyprus, and at  sea; but since Perdiccas marched against him, before he had a force to  defend himself with, no foreign army had drunk the sacred waters of the  Nile.    It was under the government of Ptolemy that the wonders of Upper Egypt  were first seen by any Greeks who had leisure, a love of knowledge, and  enough of literature, to examine carefully and to describe what they  saw. Loose and highly coloured accounts of the wealth of Thebes  had reached Greece even before the time of Homer, and again through  Herodotus and other travellers in the Delta; but nothing was certainly  known of it till it was visited by Hecataeus of Abdera, who, among other  works, wrote a history of the Hyperborean or northern nations, and also  a history, or rather a description of Egypt, part of which we now read  in the pages of Dio-dorus Siculus. When he travelled in Upper Egypt,  Thebes, though still a populous city, was more thought of by the  antiquary than by the statesman. Its wealth, however, was still great;  and when, under the just government of Ptolemy, it was no longer  necessary for the priests to hide their treasures, it was found that the  temples still held the very large sum of three hundred talents of gold,  and two thousand three hundred talents of silver, or above five million  dollars, which had escaped the plundering hands of the Persian satraps.  Many of the Theban tombs, which are sets of rooms tunnelled into the  hills on the Libyan side of the Nile, had even then been opened to  gratify the curiosity of the learned or the greediness of the conqueror.  Forty-seven royal tombs were mentioned in the records of the priests,  of which the entrances had been covered up with earth, and hidden in  the sloping sides of the hills, in the hope that they might remain  undisturbed and unplundered, and might keep safe the embalmed bodies  of the kings till they should rise again at the end of the world; and  seventeen of these had already been found out and broken open. Hecataeus  was told that the other tombs had been before destroyed; and we owe it,  perhaps, to this mistake that they remained unopened for more than two  thousand years longer, to reward the searches of modern travellers, and  to unfold to us the history of their builders.
