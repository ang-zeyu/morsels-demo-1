It was discovered under the floor  of Bishop Audley's Chapel during the last century, and appears from  internal evidence to have been probably designed about 1314 by a certain  Richard of Haldingham and of Lafford (Holdingham and Sleaford in  Lincolnshire).        \"Tuz ki cest estorie ont      Ou oyront, oy luront, ou veront,      Prient a Jhesu en deyte    De Richard de Haldingham e de Lafford eyt pite      Ki l'at fet e compasse      Ke joie en cel li seit done.\"    Prebendary Havergal says: \"It is believed to be one of the very oldest  maps in the world, if not the oldest, and it is full of the deepest  interest. It is founded on the cosmographical treatises of the time, which  generally commence by stating that Augustus Caesar sent out three  philosophers, Nichodoxus, Theodotus, and Polictitus, to measure and survey  the world, and that all geographical knowledge was the result. In the  left-hand corner of the map the Emperor is delivering to the philosophers  written orders, confirmed by a handsome mediaeval seal. The world is here  represented as round, surrounded by the ocean. At the top of the map is  represented Paradise, with its rivers and trees; also the eating of the  forbidden fruit and the expulsion of our first parents. Above is a  remarkable representation of the Day of Judgment, with the Virgin Mary  interceding for the faithful, who are seen rising from their graves and  being led within the walls of heaven.    \"The map is chiefly filled with ideas taken from Herodotus, Solinus,  Isidore, Pliny, and other ancient historians. There are numerous figures  of towns, animals, birds, and fish, with grotesque customs, such as the  mediaeval geographers believed to exist in different parts of the world;  Babylon with its famous tower; Rome, the capital of the world, bearing the  inscription--_'Roma, caput mundi, tenet orbis frena rotundi'_; and Troy as  '_civitas bellicosissima_.' In Great Britain most of the cathedrals are  mentioned; but of Ireland the author seems to have known very little.    \"Amongst the many points of interest are the columns of Hercules, the  Labyrinth of Crete, the pyramids in Egypt, the house of bondage, the  journeys of the Children of Israel, the Red Sea, Mount Sinai, with a  figure of Moses and his supposed place of burial, the Phoenician Jews  worshipping the molten image, Lot's wife,\" etc.    *Bishop's Cloisters.*--At the eastern end of the south nave aisle a door  opens to the cloisters connecting the cathedral with the episcopal palace.  In the cloister is placed a monument and inscription to Colonel John  Matthews of Belmont, near Hereford, who died 1826. The subject, \"Grief  consoled by an Angel,\" is carved in Caen stone.    Other monuments are:--one to the Hon. Edward Grey, D.D., formerly Bishop of  Hereford, 1832 to 1837. He died July 1837, and is buried beneath the  bishop's throne. A monument to Bishop George Isaac Huntingford, D.D., 1815  to 1832. He died in his eighty-fourth year, April 1832, and was buried at  Compton, near Winchester. Also a monument to Dr. Clarke Whitfield, an  organist of the cathedral.    The following inscription, on an ancient brass, affixed to a gravestone  near the west part of the cathedral, which, being taken off, was kept in  the city tolsey or hall for some time until it was finally fastened to a  freestone on the west side of the Bishop's Cloisters:--      \"Good Christeyn People of your Charite    That here abide in this transitorye life,    For the souls of Richard Philips pray ye,    And also of Anne his dere beloved wife,    Which here togeder continued without stryfe    In this Worshipful City called Hereford by Name,    He being 7 times Mayer and Ruler of the same:    Further, to declare of his port and fame,    His pitie and compassion of them that were in woe,    To do works of charitie his hands were nothing lame,    Throughe him all people here may freely come and goe    Without paying of Custom, Toll, or other Woe.    The which Things to redeme he left both House and Land    For that intent perpetually to remain and stand.    Anne also that Godlye woman hath put to her Hand,    Approving her Husband's Acte, and enlarging the same,    Whyche Benefits considered all this Contry is band    Entirely to pray for them or ellis it were to blame.    Now Christe that suffered for us all Passion, Payne, and Shame,    Grant them their Reward in Hevyn among that gloriouse Company.    There to reigne in Joy and Blyss with them eternally!            Amen.\"    *The South-east Transept*, lying between the retro-choir and the  chapter-house, into which it opens, is in the main Decorated, though its  window tracery is perhaps somewhat later, being almost flamboyant in  character. It was altered from the original Norman apse, and in the walls  bases of the earlier work remain. It has an eastern aisle, separated from  it by a single octagonal pillar.    Before the aisles were added the now open window looking into the Lady  Chapel formed part of the outside wall of the chapel, and was glazed.  There is a lovely view from this transept, looking slantwise into the Lady  Chapel. In this transept are a number of fragments of brasses, mouldings,  stone, etc. The chief monument is that to Bishop Lewis Charleton, 1369.  His effigy lies under the wall dividing the transept from the vestibule of  the Lady Chapel. Above it is a fine monument, restored in 1875, to Bishop  Coke, died 1646. This bishop was brother to Sir John Coke, Secretary of  State to Charles I. His coloured shield is borne by two angels.    A black marble slab, in excellent preservation, marks the spot where the  remains of Bishop Ironside were laid on Christmas Eve, 1867, in presence  of the dean, archdeacon, and praecentor, in a vault specially prepared for  them; and there is a small brass on the wall. Gilbert Ironside, D.D.,  Warden of Wadham College, Oxford, was Vice-Chancellor of the University in  1687, when James II. seized upon the venerable foundation of Magdalen  College and sent his commissioners to Oxford to expel the Fellows.    In his replies to the king, Dr. Ironside showed a firm and resolute spirit  in defence of the rights of Oxford. His refusal to dine with the  commissioners on the day of the Magdalen expulsion is described thus by  Macaulay:--\"I am not,\" he said, \"of Colonel Kerke's mind. I cannot eat my  meals with appetite under a gallows.\"    The brave old Warden of Wadham was not left to \"eat his meals\" much longer  in his beautiful college hall. William III., almost immediately after his  accession, made him Bishop of Bristol, whence he was translated to  Hereford, and, dying in 1701 at the London residence of the Bishops of  Hereford, in the parish of St. Mary Somerset, was buried in that church.    It was at the instigation of the Warden and Fellows of Wadham College that  the Dean and Chapter of Hereford consented to the proposal that the  remains and marble slab should be removed to the precincts of their  cathedral.    St. Mary Somerset, Thames Street, was the first church closed under the  Bishop of London's Union of Benefices Act, and when it was dismantled and  the dead removed from their vaults in the autumn of 1867, the remains of  Bishop Ironside were found encased in lead only, all the outer coffins in  the vault having been previously removed or stolen.    For the purpose of identification the lead coffin was opened by the Burial  Board authorities, \"and,\" says Mr. Havergal, \"so perfect were the remains  that the skin was not broken, and the features of the placid-looking  bishop were undisturbed.\" In a square recess on the east wall is a bust  which has been taken by various critics to be Hogarth, Cowper, Garrick,  and others, but is in reality a portrait of a Mr. James Thomas, a citizen  of Hereford, who is buried near this place. Under it is a brass to Sir  Richard Delabere, 1514, his two wives and twenty-one children; the  inscription is as follows:--    \"Of your Charitie pray for the Soul of Sir Richard Delabere, Knight, late  of the Countie of Hereford; Anne, daughter of the Lord Audley, and  Elizabeth, daughter of William Mores, late sergeant of the hall to King  Henry VII., wyves of the said Sir Richard, whyche decessed the 20th day of  July, A.D. 1513, on whose souls Jesu have mercye. Amen.\"    The north-east window contains stained glass to the memory of Bishop  Huntingford. There is also an old effigy supposed to represent St. John  the Baptist.    *The Lady Chapel.*--The elaborate and beautiful Early English work of this  chapel, which dates from the first half of the thirteenth century, about  1220, was twice under the restorers' hands, the eastern end and roof  having been rebuilt by Cottingham and the porch and Audley Chapel by Sir  G. G. Scott. It is 24 by 45 feet in extent and has three bays. On the  north side each of these bays contains two large windows, and on the south  side two of the bays contain each two windows, while the third is filled  by the Audley Chapel.    In 1841 the eastern gable of the chapel was stated by Professor Willis to  be in a parlous state, and the rebuilding of this portion was one of the  first works undertaken by Mr. Cottingham. Sir G. G. Scott completed the  pavement and other restorations.    The glorious east window consists of five narrow lancets recessed within  arches supported by clustered shafts, the wall above being perforated with  five quatrefoil openings, of which the outside ones are circular and the  centre three are oval.    Fergusson(5) remarks: \"Nowhere on the Continent are such combinations to  be found as the Five Sisters at York, the east end of Ely, or such a group  as that which terminates the east end of Hereford.\"    Of the beauties and interesting features which were developed by the  clearing of the Lady Chapel by Mr. Cottingham, Dean Merewether wrote:--                         [Illustration: THE LADY CHAPEL.]                      "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19494"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Saint Albans (#10)"],[1,"the north wall of the  rectangular chapter-house, but is closed at the west end by a wall with  a window in it, and at the east end has a door. Fortunately, a  photograph taken before the destruction was available for reproduction,  so that the reader may see the original condition of the south wall of  the slype (see p. 20). The west wall of the transept has entirely  different shafts in its triforium from those on the opposite side. A  little double-light window or grating may be seen in the west wall near  the aisle; it once opened into a small watching chamber, which was  walled up at the time of the restoration for the sake of giving  additional strength to the walls at the angle. It will be noticed that  the pilasters projecting from the west wall do not come down to the  ground. Lord Grimthorpe considers that these were not cut away, as might  be imagined but were originally built as we see them to give strength to  the walls where they were thinner on account of the passages in their  thickness. There is a recess in this wall which was once a doorway into  the cloister; it now contains some old oak chests, in which are placed  every week the loaves provided for the poor by Robert Skelton's charity,  1628. The wooden ceiling is due to Lord Grimthorpe.    [Illustration: DOORWAY IN SOUTH TRANSEPT.]    #The North Arm of the Transept.#--The upper part of the north wall, with  its high circular window, was rebuilt by Lord Grimthorpe. Above the  triforium on the east and west walls are three Norman windows and below  these on the west side again two other Norman ones. The Norman doorway  by which pilgrims to St. Albans shrine entered the church, and two  Norman windows, with glass representing the four Latin doctors, inserted  to the memory of Archdeacon Grant, who died 1883, may be seen below the  wheel window; in the east wall are two pairs of lancets due to Lord  Grimthorpe. Here, as in the corresponding wall on the south side, there  are two arches which once led into two chapels. After their destruction,  altars dedicated to the Holy Trinity (north) and to St. Osyth (south)  were placed in the recesses. Here may be seen two modern monuments: one  the cenotaph of Dr. Claughton, first Bishop of St. Albans, 1877-1892;[7]  this stands at equal distances from the east and west walls: the other,  an altar tomb, was erected in memory of Alfred Blomfield, Suffragan  Bishop of Colchester, who died 1884. The ceiling is by Lord Grimthorpe.  A panel from the old ceiling, representing the death of St. Alban, may  be seen in the south aisle of the presbytery.        [7] Designed by Mr. J.O. Scott; carved by Mr. Forsyth, of Hampstead.    If we stand under the central tower we get, looking westward, a view  into the choir with its modern fittings, the stalls given by various  donors, and the Bishop's throne which was brought hither from Rochester.  From the way in which the piers are cut away on their faces looking into  the choir, it is concluded that the backs of the original stalls reached  to a considerable height. The piers, like those in the nave, were at one  time painted, and on the west face of the second pier from the east of  the north arcade are remains of a painting of the Holy Trinity. In 1875  Mr. Chappie discovered wall-paintings between the clerestory windows,  three on the north and one on the south; the soffits of the arches are  also coloured.    The painted ceiling of the choir was accidentally discovered during the  restoration. A workman was cleaning one of the panels, which was  coarsely painted, and happened to rub off the surface paint, disclosing  other work below. The upper paint was then cleared away from all the  other panels. Two, in the centre, bore a Scripture subject. The others  bore, alternately, coats of arms and the monogram IHS, with wreaths of  vine-leaves. The arms belong almost entirely to those who were by blood  or marriage connected with Edward III.    The ceiling of the lantern, 102 feet from the pavement, is painted with  the red and white roses of the houses of Lancaster and York, together  with various coats of arms. The lofty arches beneath the tower (55 feet  high) are of great grandeur, as will be seen from the illustration. The  four inside faces of the lantern are alike, each containing windows  above the three arches of the arcade, each of which comprises two  subarches springing from a quadrilateral shaft.    [Illustration: THE CROSSING, LOOKING WESTWARD.]    [Illustration: THE CHOIR.]    To the east is the #presbytery#, closed by the Wallingford or high altar  #screen.# This screen was sorely dilapidated, and all its niches were  stripped of their statues, no record remaining of whose statues  originally filled them. Mr. H. Hucks Gibbs (now Lord Aldenham) undertook  to restore this screen, making good the canopies and filling them again  with statues. The screen is of clunch, a hard stone from the lower chalk  formation quarried at Tottenhoe near Dunstable, a stone much used for  interior work in the church, though it will not stand exposure to  weather in exterior walls. The new statues are by Mr. Harry Hems of  Exeter; the larger ones of magnesian limestone from Mansfield Woodhouse,  Nottinghamshire, and the smaller of alabaster. They are excellent  examples of modern carved work. The general idea was to represent \"the  Passion of our Lord and of the testimony of the faith in that Passion  given in the lives and deeds of men\"[8] of English race. A careful  comparison of the screen (see illustration, p. 58), with the key given  (p. 59) will enable the reader to identify the persons represented.        [8] Lord Aldenham's words in describing his scheme.    The coloured altarpiece in high relief is by Mr. Alfred Gilbert, R.A.,  and is a work quite unique in character. It represents the resurrection.  In the centre is the upper half of our Lord's figure; on one side is an  angel holding a cross, emblem of faith; on the other, one holding a  crystal globe, emblem of dominion; the wings of these angels are formed  of mother-of-pearl, and before them are grills of brass scrollwork,  intended to give an air of mystery to their appearance. The work does  not appear to be fully finished, the grills being only roughly attached  to the wall. The space before the altar is paved with slabs of marble.    [Illustration: THE WALLINGFORD SCREEN.]    [Illustration: KEY TO THE SCULPTURE ON THE WALLINGFORD SCREEN]    In an arch south of the altar is Abbot John of Wheathampstead's chantry,  containing a splendid brass of Flemish workmanship, which once covered  the grave before the high altar in which Abbot Thomas de la Mare was  buried. He is represented in full vestments carrying a pastoral staff  and wearing a mitre, according to the Pope's grant, although he was not  a bishop but only a mitred abbot, and therefore could not perform the  rite of ordination, which could be administered only by the Bishop of  Lincoln; the Abbey Church, though independent of him in all other  matters, was for this purpose in his diocese. The rebus of Abbot John  was three ears of wheat, and his motto \"Valles habundabunt,\" an allusion  to the fertile lowland of Wheathampstead, whence he came. This rebus may  be found in various places where the work was due to him. Opposite to  this chantry is the far more magnificent one of Abbot Thomas Ramryge.  His rebus is a ram wearing a collar with the letters R.Y.G.E. inscribed  on it. This chantry was at one time, after the dissolution, appropriated  as a burial-place for the Ffaringdons, a Lancashire family, but the  original slab with Abbot Thomas's figure and inscription has been  restored to its place. Within the altar rails are four memorial stone  tablets covering the graves of four fourteenth-century Abbots--Thomas de  la Mare, Hugh of Eversden, Richard of Wallingford, and Michael of  Mentmore. Four other Abbots are known to have been buried beneath the  presbytery floor outside the altar rails--John de Marinis, John of  Berkhampstead, Roger of Norton, and John Stokes--as well as other monks  and laymen. It will be noticed that the presbytery is divided from the  aisles by solid walls, pierced only for the two chantries above  described, and for two doorways, one on each side, further west. Over  each of these doorways is a tabernacle; that on the south was put  together of fragments by Sir Gilbert Scott, and that on the north made  to match it. The clerestory windows are Lord Grimthorpe's; the painted  wooden vaulting which extends beyond the screen and over the Saints'  Chapel is John of Wheathampstead's. It will be noticed that this springs  from vaulting shafts, and it is by some considered that a stone roof was  contemplated. The triforium here is an arcade without any passage. The  pulpit, which stands close by the north pier of the eastern tower arch,  was designed by Mr. J.O. Scott and given by the Freemasons of England,  who regard St. Alban as their patron saint.    [Illustration: RAMRYGE CHANTRY.]    We will now turn to the south and pass eastward under the curtain which  hangs beneath the western arch of the south aisle of the presbytery. On  the south side we see, as we enter, a fourteenth-century holy water  stoup, and further on, under a window, a wide round-headed archway which  formerly led into a chapel now demolished, which once was dedicated to  our Lady, before the larger chapel at the east end was built. In the  next bay is a blocked Norman window from which the plaster has been  scraped to show the character of the wall, built of Roman tiles; the  quadripartite vaulting is of plaster with lines painted red to make it  appear like stone. Opposite is a large oak money-chest, and above it on  the wall is the figure of a mendicant (see p. 63), carved in wood by a  verger in the eighteenth century, hat in hand, as if asking the  passer-by to put a coin in the poor-box below. In the south wall is a  doorway which led into the"]]]
