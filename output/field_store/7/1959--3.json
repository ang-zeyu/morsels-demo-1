[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19042"],[0,"Animal Figures in the Maya Codices (#10)"],[1,"  bird head-dress (Pl. 15, fig. 2), which from the length of the bill is  probably made from a heron's head, though the crest seems greatly  exaggerated. The bas-relief on which this is found is strongly Nahua in  feeling and execution. This head covering may indicate, according to the  Nahua fashion, the tribe to which the warrior belongs. Again in Dresden  36a (Pl. 15, fig. 7), a man is shown wearing as a head-dress the head  and neck of a heron that holds in its bill a fish. This head resembles  very closely that of the heron in fig. 1. What appears to be a similar  head is shown in Pl. 15, fig. 6. It is interesting to note that the  heron with a fish (Pl. 15, fig. 5) from Palenque also forms a part of a  complicated head-dress.    It is, of course, uncertain to which of the several herons occurring in  Central America these representations refer. Possibly the Great Blue  heron (_Ardea herodias_) or the Louisiana heron (_Hydranassa tricolor  ruficollis_) is intended. It seems not unlikely also, that one of the  white egrets may be shown as their crests are fairly conspicuous.    FRIGATE-BIRD (_Fregata aquila_). We have included here two figures (Pl.  15, figs. 8, 9) that undoubtedly represent a single species of bird. It  is characterized by a deeply forked tail and long beak, which has part  way on its length, a circular object surrounded by a circle of dots. It  seems still problematical what this object may be. In one figure (fig.  9), the beak is strongly hooked, in the other (fig. 8) it is straight,  but as the latter is plainly a much more carelessly made drawing, we may  infer that the hooked bill is more nearly correct. This would exclude  the Terns (_Sterna_), to which Stempell has referred the figures. It  seems probable that the frigate-bird (_Fregata aquila_) is the species  intended, as this is not only a large conspicuous form on these coasts,  but it has a long and strongly hooked beak and forked tail. The length  of the beak would probably exclude from consideration, the  swallow-tailed kite that also occurs in the region.    Both these birds are pictured, evidently as an offering or sacrifice. It  is very seldom that the whole bird is represented in this connection,  and still more infrequent to find anything but the turkey, which is the  usual bird of sacrifice. The figure from the Dresden Codex (Pl. 15, fig.  9) rests upon the usual bowl or jar, that from the Tro-Cortesianus (Pl.  15, fig. 8) is pictured upon a grotesque animal head, three _Kan_ signs  and these upon the jar.    In the Tro-Cortesianus 20c, 21c, there occur several representations of  man-like forms with very peculiar heads. The latter are each provided  with a beak-like projection, on which appears the circle surrounded by  dots noted above in connection with the frigate-bird. Brinton concludes  that this mystic symbol is a representation of the curious knob on the  bill of the male white pelican, and therefore identifies these curious  figures as pelicans. Stempell follows Brinton in this, but considers  that they are the brown pelican (_P. fuscus_), since the white pelican  is rare or casual, as far south as Yucatan. Unfortunately, however, for  this supposition, the brown pelican lacks the curious knob that Brinton  believed to be represented by the circle of dots. Moreover, this same  sign occurs on the drawings of the bills of the frigate-bird and the  ocellated turkey, and is evidently not of specific significance. To our  minds it is doubtful if the figures under discussion are birds at all,  and we are unable to assign them a name with any degree of confidence. A  peculiar glyph occurs in connection with them which may be an aid to  their ultimate identification. Brinton calls the glyph the \"fish and  oyster sign.\"    OCELLATED TURKEY (_Agriocharis ocellata_). This turkey (Maya _ku[[c].]_)  is an important species in the Maya economy, and is seen frequently in  the manuscripts. This is a smaller bird than the more northern true  turkey (_Meleagris_) and is characterized by the presence of curious  erect knobs on the top of the naked head. These are shown in  conventionalized form in the various figures (Pl. 16), and afford a  ready means of identification. On the bill of the bird shown in  Tro-Cortesianus 10b (Pl. 16, fig. 2) occurs again the curious symbol, a  circle surrounded by dots, previously noted under the frigate-bird and  pelican. It probably has some special significance. Other figures of  ocellated turkeys show but little in addition to the points just  discussed. One shown in Pl. 16, fig. 7, from Codex Vaticanus 3773,  however, has a circular ring about the eye and the wattles are indicated  as projections merely. In fig. 13, they are apparently shown as stalked  knobs found elsewhere in connection with serpent head ornaments. It is  only the head in this latter figure, which is considered in this  interpretation.    In the Nuttall Codex, there frequently occur representations of a bird  that was evidently used for sacrificial purposes. It is shown with  erectile head feathers and a ring of circular marks about the eye (Pl.  26, figs. 12, 14; Pl. 27, figs. 2-3) or with concentric circles (Pl. 27,  fig. 1). These figures are not surely identifiable, but probably  represent this turkey. Possibly they are the chachalaca (_Ortalis vetula  pallidiventris_), a gallinaceous bird, commonly kept in  semi-domestication in Mexico, whose bare eye ring and slightly erectile  head feathers may be represented by the drawings. It is probable that  this turkey is the bird represented frequently in the Maya codices as a  bird of sacrifice. The head alone usually appears in this connection,  among other places, in Dresden 34a (Pl. 16, fig. 10), 41c (fig. 14), 29c  (fig. 16), 28c (fig. 17), and in Tro-Cortesianus 12b (Pl. 16, fig. 11),  105b (fig. 12), 107b (fig. 15). In several of these places the head is  represented as resting on one or more _Kan_ signs, again meaning bread,  as well as on the vessel or jar. In Dresden 26c (Pl. 16, fig. 9), the  whole turkey is pictured as an offering, as in the preceding case noted  in Dresden 35a (Pl. 15, fig. 9). The whole bird as an offering may also  appear in Tro-Cortesianus 4a (Pl. 16, fig. 4) corresponding to the  offering of venison and iguana on the following pages. This  representation of the entire bird is very rare although the fish, when  used as an offering, is always represented as a whole and the iguana is  in most cases when used in the same connection. Landa (1864, p.  222)[327-*] confirms the offering of the heads of birds with bread.    It is, however, the sacrifice of a bird, probably a turkey, by  decapitating, that is especially interesting, as the operation as shown  in the Dresden Codex 25c (Pl. 26, fig. 2), 26c, 27c, 28c, in the rites  of the four years, is described in full by Landa. In the codex, a priest  is represented as holding in his hand before an altar, a headless bird.  Landa (1864, pp. 212, 218, 224, 228)[327-[+]] tells us that in the  _Kan_, the _Muluc_, the _Ix_, and the _Cauac_ years, the priests burnt  incense to the idol, decapitated a \"_gallina_\" (undoubtedly a turkey),  and presented it to the god.    The turkey is also used as a head-dress. Only in one case, however,  Tro-Cortesianus 95c (Pl. 16, fig. 5), is the whole bird represented in  this connection. This is clearly of totemic significance here, as it  occurs in that part of the codex where birth and infant baptism are  shown. In many other places there are curious partial representations of  bird heads in the front of head-dresses which may or may not be  identified as heads of turkeys. Among these are the head-dress of god H  in Dresden 7c, of god E in Dresden 11e, of god C in Dresden 13b, of god  A in Dresden 23c, and a female divinity in Dresden 20a (Pl. 16, fig.  13). Schellhas (1904, p. 43) identifies these birds as vultures.    That the turkey is connected with the rain seems clear. This is  especially the case among the Nahuas. In the Aubin manuscript the rain  god, _Tlaloc_, often appears in the disguise of the turkey-cock  (_uexolotl_), and in the Vaticanus 3773, 14, the turkey (Pl. 16, fig. 7)  is represented in the \"House of Rain,\" in contrast to the owl shown in  the \"House of Drought\" (Seler, 1902-1903, p. 75). It might be noted also  that Fewkes (1892, p. 228) shows that the turkey is emblematic of the  rain among the pueblo peoples. The same idea seems to be present among  the Mayas, as we note in the Tro-Cortesianus 10b (Pl. 16, fig. 2) the  turkey is pictured in the rain and surrounded on three sides by bands of  constellation signs.    Two methods of capturing the turkey are shown in the Tro-Cortesianus 93a  and 91a (Pl. 16, figs. 1, 3). By the first, the bird is captured alive  in a sort of wicker basket, which drops over it at the proper moment.  The second method is by the \"twich-up\" or snare, which consists of a  noose tied to a bent sapling and properly baited. In connection with Pl.  16, fig. 1, it may be suggested that possibly this represents a cage  rather than a trap, in which the bird is confined. The Lacandones at the  present time often keep their totem animals in captivity (Tozzer, 1907,  p. 40).    KING VULTURE (_Sarcorhamphus papa_). Numerous figures of vultures appear  in the codices and elsewhere. Indeed, they are among the most common of  the birds depicted. Two species only seem to occur in the writings, the  king vulture and the black vulture. The former is a large black and  white bird with the head and the upper part of the neck unfeathered,  except for numerous short, almost bristle-like plumules. These naked  portions are often colored red and there is a large more or less  squarish fleshy knob at the base of the upper ramus of the beak. This  conspicuous protuberance has been seized upon as a characteristic in the  conventionalized figures, and serves to identify the king from the black  vulture.

I may here mention that this discovery is the one to which I alluded in  the opening pages of my story.  Time strengthened the impression made  upon me at first; and, though I remained in doubt for several months, I  feel now no longer uncertain.    When I had done eating, my hosts approached, and pointed down the valley  leading to their own country, as though wanting to show that I must go  with them; at the same time they laid hold of my arms, and made as though  they would take me, but used no violence.  I laughed, and motioned my  hand across my throat, pointing down the valley as though I was afraid  lest I should be killed when I got there.  But they divined me at once,  and shook their heads with much decision, to show that I was in no  danger.  Their manner quite reassured me; and in half an hour or so I had  packed up my swag, and was eager for the forward journey, feeling  wonderfully strengthened and refreshed by good food and sleep, while my  hope and curiosity were aroused to their very utmost by the extraordinary  position in which I found myself.    But already my excitement had begun to cool and I reflected that these  people might not be the ten tribes after all; in which case I could not  but regret that my hopes of making money, which had led me into so much  trouble and danger, were almost annihilated by the fact that the country  was full to overflowing, with a people who had probably already developed  its more available resources.  Moreover, how was I to get back?  For  there was something about my hosts which told me that they had got me,  and meant to keep me, in spite of all their goodness.          CHAPTER VII: FIRST IMPRESSIONS      We followed an Alpine path for some four miles, now hundreds of feet  above a brawling stream which descended from the glaciers, and now nearly  alongside it.  The morning was cold and somewhat foggy, for the autumn  had made great strides latterly.  Sometimes we went through forests of  pine, or rather yew trees, though they looked like pine; and I remember  that now and again we passed a little wayside shrine, wherein there would  be a statue of great beauty, representing some figure, male or female, in  the very heyday of youth, strength, and beauty, or of the most dignified  maturity and old age.  My hosts always bowed their heads as they passed  one of these shrines, and it shocked me to see statues that had no  apparent object, beyond the chronicling of some unusual individual  excellence or beauty, receive so serious a homage.  However, I showed no  sign of wonder or disapproval; for I remembered that to be all things to  all men was one of the injunctions of the Gentile Apostle, which for the  present I should do well to heed.  Shortly after passing one of these  chapels we came suddenly upon a village which started up out of the mist;  and I was alarmed lest I should be made an object of curiosity or  dislike.  But it was not so.  My guides spoke to many in passing, and  those spoken to showed much amazement.  My guides, however, were well  known, and the natural politeness of the people prevented them from  putting me to any inconvenience; but they could not help eyeing me, nor I  them.  I may as well say at once what my after-experience taught  me--namely, that with all their faults and extraordinary obliquity of  mental vision upon many subjects, they are the very best-bred people that  I ever fell in with.    The village was just like the one we had left, only rather larger.  The  streets were narrow and unpaved, but very fairly clean.  The vine grew  outside many of the houses; and there were some with sign-boards, on  which was painted a bottle and a glass, that made me feel much at home.  Even on this ledge of human society there was a stunted growth of  shoplets, which had taken root and vegetated somehow, though as in an air  mercantile of the bleakest.  It was here as hitherto: all things were  generically the same as in Europe, the differences being of species only;  and I was amused at seeing in a window some bottles with barley-sugar and  sweetmeats for children, as at home; but the barley-sugar was in plates,  not in twisted sticks, and was coloured blue.  Glass was plentiful in the  better houses.    Lastly, I should say that the people were of a physical beauty which was  simply amazing.  I never saw anything in the least comparable to them.  The women were vigorous, and had a most majestic gait, their heads being  set upon their shoulders with a grace beyond all power of expression.  Each feature was finished, eyelids, eyelashes, and ears being almost  invariably perfect.  Their colour was equal to that of the finest Italian  paintings; being of the clearest olive, and yet ruddy with a glow of  perfect health.  Their expression was divine; and as they glanced at me  timidly but with parted lips in great bewilderment, I forgot all thoughts  of their conversion in feelings that were far more earthly.  I was  dazzled as I saw one after the other, of whom I could only feel that each  was the loveliest I had ever seen.  Even in middle age they were still  comely, and the old grey-haired women at their cottage doors had a  dignity, not to say majesty, of their own.    The men were as handsome as the women beautiful.  I have always delighted  in and reverenced beauty; but I felt simply abashed in the presence of  such a splendid type--a compound of all that is best in Egyptian, Greek  and Italian.  The children were infinite in number, and exceedingly  merry; I need hardly say that they came in for their full share of the  prevailing beauty.  I expressed by signs my admiration and pleasure to my  guides, and they were greatly pleased.  I should add that all seemed to  take a pride in their personal appearance, and that even the poorest (and  none seemed rich) were well kempt and tidy.  I could fill many pages with  a description of their dress and the ornaments which they wore, and a  hundred details which struck me with all the force of novelty; but I must  not stay to do so.    When we had got past the village the fog rose, and revealed magnificent  views of the snowy mountains and their nearer abutments, while in front I  could now and again catch glimpses of the great plains which I had  surveyed on the preceding evening.  The country was highly cultivated,  every ledge being planted with chestnuts, walnuts, and apple-trees from  which the apples were now gathering.  Goats were abundant; also a kind of  small black cattle, in the marshes near the river, which was now fast  widening, and running between larger flats from which the hills receded  more and more.  I saw a few sheep with rounded noses and enormous tails.  Dogs were there in plenty, and very English; but I saw no cats, nor  indeed are these creatures known, their place being supplied by a sort of  small terrier.    In about four hours of walking from the time we started, and after  passing two or three more villages, we came upon a considerable town, and  my guides made many attempts to make me understand something, but I  gathered no inkling of their meaning, except that I need be under no  apprehension of danger.  I will spare the reader any description of the  town, and would only bid him think of Domodossola or Faido.  Suffice it  that I found myself taken before the chief magistrate, and by his orders  was placed in an apartment with two other people, who were the first I  had seen looking anything but well and handsome.  In fact, one of them  was plainly very much out of health, and coughed violently from time to  time in spite of manifest efforts to suppress it.  The other looked pale  and ill but he was marvellously self-contained, and it was impossible to  say what was the matter with him.  Both of them appeared astonished at  seeing one who was evidently a stranger, but they were too ill to come up  to me, and form conclusions concerning me.  These two were first called  out; and in about a quarter of an hour I was made to follow them, which I  did in some fear, and with much curiosity.    The chief magistrate was a venerable-looking man, with white hair and  beard and a face of great sagacity.  He looked me all over for about five  minutes, letting his eyes wander from the crown of my head to the soles  of my feet, up and down, and down and up; neither did his mind seem in  the least clearer when he had done looking than when he began.  He at  length asked me a single short question, which I supposed meant \"Who are  you?\"  I answered in English quite composedly as though he would  understand me, and endeavoured to be my very most natural self as well as  I could.  He appeared more and more puzzled, and then retired, returning  with two others much like himself.  Then they took me into an inner room,  and the two fresh arrivals stripped me, while the chief looked on.  They  felt my pulse, they looked at my tongue, they listened at my chest, they  felt all my muscles; and at the end of each operation they looked at the  chief and nodded, and said something in a tone quite pleasant, as though  I were all right.  They even pulled down my eyelids, and looked, I  suppose, to see if they were bloodshot; but it was not so.  At length  they gave up; and I think that all were satisfied of my being in the most  perfect health, and very robust to boot.  At last the old magistrate made  me a speech of about five minutes long, which the other two appeared to  think greatly to the point, but from which I gathered nothing.  As soon  as it was ended, they proceeded to overhaul my swag and the contents of  my pockets.  This gave me little uneasiness, for I had no money with me,  nor anything which they were at all likely to want, or which I cared  about losing.  At least I fancied so, but I soon found"]]]
