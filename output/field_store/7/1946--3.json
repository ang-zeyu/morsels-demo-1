I swear by your true Lord, by Him Who is the Lord of the heavens and of  the earth, that the divine Promise concerning His Remembrance is naught  but the sovereign truth and, as decreed in the Mother Book, it shall come  to pass...    Say, O peoples of the earth! Were ye to assemble together in order to  produce the like of a single letter of My Works, ye would never be able to  do so,(32) and verily God is cognizant of all things...    O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Say: Behold! Verily the Moon hath faded; verily the  night hath retreated; verily the dawn hath brightened;(33) verily the  command of God, your true Lord, hath been accomplished...    Out of utter nothingness, O great and omnipotent Master, Thou hast,  through the celestial potency of Thy might, brought me forth and raised me  up to proclaim this Revelation. I have made none other but Thee my trust;  I have clung to no will but Thy Will. Thou art, in truth, the  All-Sufficing and behind Thee standeth the true God, He Who overshadoweth  all things. Indeed sufficient unto Me is God, the Exalted, the Powerful,  the Sustainer. _Chapter LVIII._          \"O Thou Remnant of God! I have sacrificed myself wholly ...\"      O Thou Remnant of God! I have sacrificed myself wholly for Thee; I have  accepted curses for Thy sake, and have yearned for naught but martyrdom in  the path of Thy love. Sufficient witness unto me is God, the Exalted, the  Protector, the Ancient of Days.    O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! The words Thou hast uttered in this momentous Call have  grieved Me bitterly. However, the irrevocable decision resteth with none  but God and the decree proceedeth from none save Him alone. By My life,  Thou art the Well-Beloved in the sight of God and His creation. Verily,  there is no power except in God, and sufficient witness unto Me is your  Lord, Who is, in very truth, the Omnipotent Avenger. _Chapter LVIII._          \"O Peoples of the earth! By the righteousness of God, this ...\"      O Peoples of the earth! By the righteousness of God, this Book hath,  through the potency of the sovereign Truth, pervaded the earth and the  heaven with the mighty Word of God concerning Him Who is the supreme  Testimony, the Expected Qa'im, and verily God hath knowledge of all  things. This divinely-inspired Book hath firmly established His Proof for  all those who are in the East and in the West, hence beware lest ye utter  aught but the truth regarding God, for I swear by your Lord that this  supreme Proof of Mine beareth witness unto all things...    O servants of God! Be ye patient, for, God grant, He Who is the sovereign  Truth will suddenly appear amongst you, invested with the power of the  mighty Word, and ye shall then be confounded by the Truth itself, and ye  shall have no power to ward it off;(34) and verily I am a witness over all  mankind. _Chapter LIX._          \"Verily such as ridicule the wondrous, divine Verses ...\"      Verily such as ridicule the wondrous, divine Verses revealed through His  Remembrance, are but making themselves the objects of ridicule, and We, in  truth, aid them to wax in their iniquity.(35) Indeed God's knowledge  transcendeth all created things...    The infidels, of a truth, seek to separate God from His Remembrance,(36)  but God hath determined to perfect His Light(37) through His Remembrance,  and indeed He is potent over all things...    Verily, Christ is Our Word which We communicated unto Mary;(38) and let no  one say what the Christians term as 'the third of three',(39) inasmuch as  it would amount to slandering the Remembrance Who, as decreed in the  Mother Book, is invested with supreme authority. Indeed God is but one  God, and far be it from His glory that there should be aught else besides  Him. All those who shall attain unto Him on the Day of Resurrection are  but His servants, and God is, of a truth, a sufficient Protector. Verily I  am none other but the servant of God and His Word, and none but the first  one to bow down in supplication before God, the Most Exalted; and indeed  God witnesseth all things. _Chapter LXI._          \"O People of the Qur'an! Ye are as nothing unless ye ...\"      O People of the Qur'an! Ye are as nothing unless ye submit unto the  Remembrance of God and unto this Book. If ye follow the Cause of God, We  will forgive you your sins, and if ye turn aside from Our command, We  will, in truth, condemn your souls in Our Book, unto the Most Great Fire.  We, verily, do not deal unjustly with men, even to the extent of a speck  on a date-stone. _Chapter LXII._          \"O Peoples of the earth! Verily the resplendent Light of ...\"      O Peoples of the earth! Verily the resplendent Light of God hath appeared  in your midst, invested with this unerring Book, that ye may be guided  aright to the ways of peace and, by the leave of God, step out of the  darkness into the light and onto this far-extended Path of Truth(40) ...    God hath, out of sheer nothingness and through the potency of His command,  created the heavens and the earth and whatever lieth between them. He is  single and peerless in His eternal unity with none to join partner with  His holy Essence, nor is there any soul, except His Own Self, who can  befittingly comprehend Him...    O peoples of the earth! Verily His Remembrance is come to you from God  after an interval during which there were no Messengers,(41) that He may  purge and purify you from uncleanliness in anticipation of the Day of the  One true God; therefore seek ye whole-heartedly divine blessings from Him,  inasmuch as We have, in truth, chosen Him to be the Witness and the Source  of wisdom unto all that dwell on earth...    O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Proclaim that which hath been sent down unto Thee as a  token of the grace of the merciful Lord, for if Thou do it not, Our secret  will never be made known to the people,(42) while the purpose of God in  creating man is but for him to know Him. Indeed God hath knowledge of all  things and is self-sufficient above the need of all mankind. _Chapter  LXII._          \"Whenever the faithful hear the verses of this Book ...\"      Whenever the faithful hear the verses of this Book being recited, their  eyes will overflow with tears and their hearts will be deeply touched by  Him Who is the Most Great Remembrance for the love they cherish for God,  the All-Praised. He is God, the All-Knowing, the Eternal. They are indeed  the inmates of the all-highest Paradise wherein they will abide for ever.  Verily they will see naught therein save that which hath proceeded from  God, nothing that will lie beyond the compass of their understanding.  There they will meet the believers in Paradise, who will address them with  the words 'Peace, Peace' lingering on their lips...    O concourse of the faithful! Incline your ears to My Voice, proclaimed by  this Remembrance of God. Verily God hath revealed unto Me that the Path of  the Remembrance which is set forth by Me is, in very truth, the straight  Path of God, and that whoever professeth any religion other than this  upright Faith, will, when called to account on the Day of Judgement,  discover that as recorded in the Book no benefit hath he reaped out of  God's Religion...    Fear ye God, O concourse of kings, lest ye remain afar from Him Who is His  Remembrance [the Bab], after the Truth hath come unto you with a Book and  signs from God, as spoken through the wondrous tongue of Him Who is His  Remembrance. Seek ye grace from God, for God hath ordained for you, after  ye have believed in Him, a Garden the vastness of which is as the vastness  of the whole of Paradise. Therein ye shall find naught save the gifts and  favours which the Almighty hath graciously bestowed by virtue of this  momentous Cause, as decreed in the Mother Book. _Chapter LXIII._          \"O Spirit of God! Call Thou to mind the bounty which ...\"      O Spirit of God! Call Thou to mind the bounty which I bestowed upon Thee  when I conversed with Thee in the midmost heart of My Sanctuary and aided  Thee through the potency of the Holy Spirit that Thou mightest, as the  peerless Mouthpiece of God, proclaim unto men the commandments of God  which lie enshrined within the divine Spirit.    Verily God hath inspired Thee with divine verses and wisdom while still a  child and hath graciously deigned to bestow His favour upon the peoples of  the world through the influence of Thy Most Great Name, for indeed men  have not the least knowledge of the Book. _Chapter LXIII._          \"O People of the earth! To attain the ultimate retreat in ...\"      O People of the earth! To attain the ultimate retreat in God, the True  One, are we to seek a Gate other than this exalted Being?...    When God created the Remembrance He presented Him to the assemblage of all  created beings upon the altar of His Will. Thereupon the concourse of the  angels bowed low in adoration to God, the Peerless, the Incomparable;  while Satan waxed proud, refusing to submit to His Remembrance; hence he  is identified in the Book of God as the arrogant one and the accursed.(43)  _Chapter LXVII._          \"God, besides Whom there is none other true God, saith: ...\"      God, besides Whom there is none other true God, saith: Indeed, whoso  visiteth the Remembrance of God after His passing, it is as though he hath  attained the presence of the Lord, seated upon His mighty Throne. Verily  this is the Way of God, the Most Exalted, which hath been irrevocably  decreed in the Mother Book...    Say, O peoples of the world! Do ye dispute with Me about God by virtue of  the names which ye and your fathers have adopted for Him at the promptings  of the Evil One?(44) God hath indeed sent down this Book unto Me with  truth that ye may be enabled to recognize the true names "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18833"],[0,"With Clive in India; Or, The Beginnings of an Empire (#10)"],[1,"ore, watching other boats, with the  soldiers and baggage, coming ashore; and then, being accosted by a  gentleman in the employment of the Company, followed him to the  residence of the chief factor. Here they were told that rooms would be  given them, in one of the houses erected by the Company for the use of  its employees; that they would mess with the other clerks residing in  the same house; and that, at nine o'clock in the morning, they would  report themselves as ready for work.    Charlie and his friends amused themselves by sauntering about in the  native town, greatly surprised by the sights and scenes which met  their eyes; for in those days very little was known of India, in  England. They were, however, greatly disappointed. Visions of oriental  splendour, of palaces and temples, of superbly dressed chiefs with  bands of gorgeous retainers, had floated before their mind's eye.  Instead of this they saw squalid huts, men dressed merely with a rag  of cotton around them, everywhere signs of squalor and poverty.    Madras, however, they were told that evening, was not to be taken as a  sample of India. It was a mere collection of huts, which had sprung up  round the English factories. But when they went to a real Indian city,  they would see a very different state of things.        Chapter 5: Madras.      After the young writers had seen the native town, they returned to the  beach, and spent the afternoon watching the progress of landing the  cargo of the Lizzie Anderson. They were pleased to see their own  luggage safely ashore; as it would have been greatly damaged, had the  boat containing it been swamped; a misfortune which happened to  several of the boats laden with cargo. It was very amusing, each time  that one of these boats arrived, to see a crowd of natives rush down  into the water, waist deep, seize it, and drag it up beyond the next  wave. Many of them would be knocked down, and some swept out by the  retreating wave, only to return on the next roller. All could swim  like fish, and any of these events were greeted with shouts of  laughter by the rest.    When the packages were landed a rope was put round them, and through  this a long bamboo pole was inserted, which would be lifted on to the  shoulders of two, four, or six porters, according to its weight; and  these would go off, at a hobbling sort of trot, with their burden to  the factory.    Their own baggage was taken up to the quarters allotted to them, and  at the hour named for dinner the newcomers met, for the first time,  those with whom they were to be associated. All were dressed in white  suits, and Charlie was struck with the pallor of their faces, and the  listless air of most of them. The gentleman to whom they had first  been introduced made them acquainted with the others.    \"How refreshingly healthy and well you look!\" a young man of some six  and twenty years old, named Johnson, said. \"I was something like that,  when I first came out here, though you'd hardly think it now. Eight  years of stewing, in this horrible hole, takes the life and spirits  out of anyone.    \"However, there's one consolation. After eight or ten years of quill  driving in a stuffy room, one becomes a little more one's own master,  and one's duties begin to be a little more varied and pleasant. One  gets a chance of being sent up, occasionally, with goods; or on some  message or other to one of the native princes, and then one gets  treated like a prince, and sees that India is not necessarily so  detestable as we have contrived to make it here. The only bearable  time of one's life is the few hours after dinner, when one can sit in  a chair in the veranda, and smoke and look at the sea. Some of the  fellows play billiards and cards; but if you will take my advice, you  won't go in for that sort of thing. It takes a lot out of one, and  fellows that do it are, between you and me, in the bad books of the  bigwigs. Besides, they lose money, get into debt, and all sorts of  mischief comes of it.\"    The speaker was sitting between Charlie and Peters, and was talking in  a tone of voice which would not be overheard by the others.    \"Thank you,\" Charlie said. \"I, for one, will certainly take your  advice. I suppose one can buy ponies here. I should think a good ride  every morning early, before work, would do one good.\"    \"Yes, it is not a bad thing,\" Johnson said. \"A good many fellows do  it, when they first come out here. But after a time they lose their  energy, you see, though some do keep it up.    \"What appetites you fellows have! It does one good to see you eat.\"    \"I have not the least idea what we are eating,\" Charlie said,  laughing; \"but it's really very nice, whatever it is. But there seems  an immense quantity of pepper, or hot stuff of some kind or other;  which one would have thought, in this tremendous heat, would have made  one hotter instead of cooler.\"    \"Yes,\" their new friend answered. \"No doubt all this pepper and curry  do heat the blood; but you see, it is done to tempt the appetite. Meat  here is fearfully coarse and tasteless. Our appetites are poor, and  were it not for these hot sauces, we should eat next to nothing.    \"Will you have some bananas?\"    \"They are nice and cool,\" Peters said as, having peeled the long fruit  as he saw his companion doing, he took a bite of one; \"but they have  very little taste.\"    \"Most of our fruit is tasteless,\" Johnson said, \"except, indeed, the  mango and mangostine. They are equal to any English fruit in flavour,  but I would give them all for a good English apple. Its sharpness  would be delicious here.    \"And now, as you have done, if you will come and sit in the veranda of  my room, we will smoke a cigar and have something cool to drink; and I  will answer, as well as I can, the questions you've asked me about the  state of things here.\"    When they had seated themselves in the extremely comfortable cane  chairs, in a veranda facing the sea, and had lit their cigars, their  friend began:    \"Madras isn't much of a place, now; but you should have seen it before  the French had it. Our chiefs think of nothing but trade, and care  nothing how squalid and miserable is the place in which they make  money. The French have larger ideas. They transformed this place;  cleared away that portion of the native town which surrounded the  factory and fort, made wide roads, formed an esplanade, improved and  strengthened the fortifications, forbade the natives to throw all  their rubbish and offal on the beach; and made, in fact, a decent  place of it. We hardly knew it when we came back, and whatever the  Company may have thought, we were thoroughly grateful for the French  occupation.    \"One good result, too, is that our quarters have been greatly  improved; for not only did the French build several new houses, but at  present all the big men, the council and so on, are still living at  Fort Saint David, which is still the seat of administration. So you  see, we have got better quarters; we are rid of the stenches and  nuisances of the native town; the plague of flies which made our life  a burden is abated; and we can sit here and enjoy the cool sea breeze,  without its being poisoned before it reaches us by the heaped up filth  on the beach.    \"It must have wrung Dupleix's heart to give up the place over which  they expended so much pains, and after all it didn't do away with the  fighting. In April we sent a force from Fort Saint David--before we  came back here--four hundred and thirty white soldiers and a thousand  Sepoys, under the command of Captain Cope, to aid a fellow who had  been turned out of the Rajahship of Tanjore. I believe he was a great  blackguard, and the man who had taken his place was an able ruler  liked by the people.\"    \"Then why should we interfere on behalf of the other?\" Charlie asked.    \"My dear Marryat,\" their host said compassionately, \"you are very  young yet, and quite new to India. You will see, after a time, that  right has nothing at all to do with the dealings of the Company, in  their relations to the native princes. We are, at present, little  people living here on sufferance, among a lot of princes and powers  who are enemies and rivals of each other. We have, moreover, as  neighbours, another European colony considerably stronger than we are.  The consequence is, the question of right cannot enter into the  considerations of the Company. It may be said that, for every petty  kingdom in Southern India, there are at least two pretenders, very  often half a dozen. So far we have not meddled much in their quarrels,  but the French have been much more active that way. They always side  with one or other of these pretenders, and when they get the man they  support into power, of course he repays them for their assistance. In  this manner, as I shall explain to you presently, they have virtually  made themselves masters of the Carnatic, outside the walls of Fort  Saint David and this place.    \"Well, our people thought to take a leaf out of the French book, and  as the ex-rajah offered us, in payment for our aid, the possession of  Devikota, a town at the mouth of the river Kolrun, a place likely to  be of great use to us, we agreed to assist him. Cope, with the land  forces, had marched to the border of the Tanjore territory, and the  guns and heavy baggage were to go by sea.    \"But, unfortunately, we had a tremendous gale just after they sailed.  The admiral's flagship, the Namur, of seventy-four guns; the Pembroke,  of sixty; and the hospital ship, Apollo, were totally lost; and the  rest of the fleet scattered in all directions. Cope entered the  Tanjore territory, but found the whole population attached to the new  rajah. It was useless for him, therefore, to march upon Tanjore, which  is a really strong town, so he marched down to Devikota, where he  hoped to find some of the fleet. Not a ship, however, was to be seen,  and as without"]]]
