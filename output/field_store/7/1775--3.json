The  results showed a considerable increase in the yield of seed and straw,  the ripening was more rapid and the barley ripened nearly two weeks  earlier with electroculture. Potatoes grown by the latter method were  seldom diseased, only to 5 per cent., against 10 to 40 per cent. by  ordinary culture.    Grandeau, at the School of Forestry at Nancy, found by experiment that  the electrical tension always existing between the upper air and soil  stimulated growth. He found plants protected from the influence were  less vigorous than those subject to it.    Macagno, also believing that the passage of electricity from air  through the vine to earth would stimulate growth, selected a certain  number of vines, all of the same variety and all in the same condition  of health and development. Sixteen vines were submitted to experiment  and sixteen were left to natural influences. In the ends of the vines  under treatment, pointed platinum wires were inserted, to which were  attached copper wires, leading to the tops of tall poles near the  vines; at the base of these same vines other platinum wires were  inserted and connected by copper wires with the soil. At the close of  the experiment, which began April 15, and lasted till September 16,  the wood, leaves and fruit of both sets of vines were submitted to  careful analysis with the following results:                            Without conductor.  With conductor.      Moisture per cent.          78.21            79.84    Sugar.                      16.86            18.41    Tartaric acid.               0.880            0.791    Bitartrate of potash.        0.180            0.186    Thus we see that the percentage of moisture and sugar is greater and  the undesirable acid lower in those vines subject to electrical  influences than in those left to natural conditions. There are also  experiments which prove the beneficial effects of electricity on vines  attacked by phylloxera.    The following experiments were made at this station: Several plots  were prepared in the greenhouse, all of which had the same kind of  soil and were subjected to like influences and conditions. Frames in  the form of a parallelogram, about three feet by two feet, were put  together; across the narrow way were run copper wires in series of  from four to nine strands, each series separated by a space about four  inches wide, and the strands by a space of one-half inch. These frames  were buried in the soil of the plot at a little depth, so that the  roots of the garden plants set would come in contact with the wires,  the supposition being that the currents of electricity passing along  the wires would decompose into its constituents the plant food in the  vicinity of the roots and more readily prepare it for the plants. Two  electric gardens were thus prepared and each furnished with two common  battery cells, so arranged as to allow continuous currents to pass  through each series of wires. Near each electric garden was a plot  prepared in the same manner, save the electrical apparatus. We will  call the two gardens A and B.    The place chosen for the experiments was in a part of the greenhouse  which is given up largely to the raising of lettuce, and the gardens  were located where much trouble from mildew had been experienced. The  reason for this choice of location was to notice, if any, the effect  of electricity upon mildew, this disease being, as it is well known, a  source of much trouble to those who desire to grow early lettuce. The  soil was carefully prepared, the material taken from a pile of loam  commonly used in the plant house.    Garden A was located where mildew had been the most detrimental; the  experiments began the first of January and closed the first of April.  For the garden, fifteen lettuce plants of the head variety were  selected, all of the same size and of the same degree of vitality, as  nearly as could be determined; the plants were set directly over the  wires, so that the roots were in contact with the latter; the plants  were well watered and cared for as in ordinary culture, and the fluid  in the battery cells was renewed from time to time, that the current  of electricity might not become too feeble. At the close of the  experiments the following results were noted:    Five plants died from mildew, the others were well developed and the  heads large. The largest heads were over the greatest number of wires  and nearest the electrodes. It was further noticed that the healthiest  and largest plants, as soon as the current became feeble or ceased  altogether, began to be affected with mildew. On examining the roots  of the plants it was found that they had grown about the wires as if  there they found the greatest amount of nourishment; the roots were  healthy and in no way appeared to have been injured by the current,  but, rather, much benefited by the electrical influences.    Beside garden A was prepared another plot of the same dimensions,  having the same kind of soil and treated in like manner as the first,  but the electrical apparatus and wires were wanting. At the close of  the experiments only three plants had partially developed, and two of  these were nearly destroyed by mildew--one only was free from the  disease. The results, therefore, show that the healthiest and largest  plants grew in the electric plot.    In the second experiment, which we called B, twenty plants of the same  variety of lettuce and of equal size were taken. The treatment given  was the same as the plants in plot A received. Five plants only  remained unaffected with mildew; seven died from the disease when they  were half grown; the rest were quite well developed, but at the last  part of the experiment began to be affected. Several heads were large,  the largest being over the greatest number of wires and nearest the  electrodes. Examination of the roots disclosed the same phenomena as  in A.    Near plot B were also set twenty other plants, subjected to like  conditions as the first, but without electricity; all but one died  from mildew before they were half grown, the solitary plant that  survived being only partly developed at the close of the experiment,  and even this was badly affected with the disease.    Everything considered, the results were in favor of electricity. Those  plants subjected to the greatest electrical influence were hardier,  healthier, larger, had a better color, and were much less affected by  mildew than the others. Experiments were made with various grasses,  but no marked results were obtained.    The question would naturally arise whether there may not be a limit  reached where electricity would completely overcome the attack of  mildew and stimulate the plant to a healthy and vigorous condition  throughout its entire growth. From the fact that the hardiest,  healthiest, and largest heads of lettuce grew over the greatest number  of currents and nearest the electrodes, it would seem that electricity  is one of the agents employed by nature to aid in supplying the plant  with nourishment and to stimulate its growth. To what extent plants  may be submitted to electrical influence, or what strength of current  is best suited to them and what currents prove detrimental to their  development, have not been determined as yet, but it is desirable to  continue this research until some definite information shall be gained  on these points. Probably different varieties of plants differ greatly  in their capacity for enduring the action of electric currents without  injury--experiment alone must determine this.    It has been proved that the slow discharge of static electricity  facilitates the assimilation of nitrogen by plants. Faraday showed  that plants grown in metallic cages, around which circulated electric  currents, contained 50 per cent. less organic matter than plants grown  in the open air. It would seem from the researches of the latter  physicist that those plants requiring a large percentage of nitrogen  for their development would be remarkably benefited if grown under  electric influence.--_Massachusetts Agricultural College, Bulletin No  16._    [A very interesting article on the Influence of Electricity upon  Plants, illustrated, is given in SUPPLEMENT 806.

By AMOS W. BARBER, M.D.,[1] Cheyenne.    [Footnote 1: Governor of Wyoming.]      Poisoned wounds, inflicted by the fangs of the rattlesnake, are  happily more rare each year, since, as the country is becoming more  populated, the crotalus is rapidly being exterminated. Yet,  considering the recklessness which characterizes the cow boy in his  treatment of this reptile, it is astonishing that this class of injury  is not more common. Thus it is the invariable custom among the  cattlemen to dismount and destroy these snakes whenever they are seen.  This is readily accomplished, since a slight blow will break the back.  This blow is, however, generally delivered by means of the quirt, a  whip not over two and a half feet long, and hence a weapon which  brings the one who wields it in unpleasant proximity to the fangs of  the reptile. A still more dangerous practice, and one which I have  frequently seen, is a method of playing with the rattlesnake for the  delectation of the cow boy at the expense of a \"tenderfoot.\" It is  well known that unless a snake is coiled, or held by the tail or body,  or placed at length in a hole or crevice so narrow that by rendering  its length sinuous a certain amount of support is given, it cannot  strike.

We may  certainly consider that in a chemical phenomenon annihilations and  creations of matter are really produced; but the experimental law  teaches us that there is compensation in certain respects.    The discovery of the radioactive bodies has, in some sort, rendered  popular the speculations of physicists on the phenomena of the  disaggregation of matter. We shall have to seek the exact meaning  which ought to be given to the experiments on the emanation of these  bodies, and to discover whether these experiments really imperil the  law of Lavoisier.    For some years different experimenters have also effected many very  precise measurements of the weight of divers bodies both before and  after chemical reactions between these bodies. Two highly experienced  and cautious physicists, Professors Landolt and Heydweiller, have not  hesitated to announce the sensational result that in certain  circumstances the weight is no longer the same after as before the  reaction. In particular, the weight of a solution of salts of copper  in water is not the exact sum of the joint weights of the salt and the  water. Such experiments are evidently very delicate; they have been  disputed, and they cannot be considered as sufficient for conviction.  It follows nevertheless that it is no longer forbidden to regard the  law of Lavoisier as only an approximate law; according to Sandford and  Ray, this approximation would be about 1/2,400,000. This is also the  result reached by Professor Poynting in experiments regarding the  possible action of temperature on the weight of a body; and if this be  really so, we may reassure ourselves, and from the point of view of  practical application may continue to look upon matter as  indestructible.    The principles of physics, by imposing certain conditions on  phenomena, limit after a fashion the field of the possible. Among  these principles is one which, notwithstanding its importance when  compared with that of universally known principles, is less familiar  to some people. This is the principle of symmetry, more or less  conscious applications of which can, no doubt, be found in various  works and even in the conceptions of Copernican astronomers, but which  was generalized and clearly enunciated for the first time by the late  M. Curie. This illustrious physicist pointed out the advantage of  introducing into the study of physical phenomena the considerations on  symmetry familiar to crystallographers; for a phenomenon to take  place, it is necessary that a certain dissymmetry should previously  exist in the medium in which this phenomenon occurs. A body, for  instance, may be animated with a certain linear velocity or a speed of  rotation; it may be compressed, or twisted; it may be placed in an  electric or in a magnetic field; it may be affected by an electric  current or by one of heat; it may be traversed by a ray of light  either ordinary or polarized rectilineally or circularly, etc.:--in  each case a certain minimum and characteristic dissymmetry is  necessary at every point of the body in question.    This consideration enables us to foresee that certain phenomena which  might be imagined _a priori_ cannot exist. Thus, for instance, it is  impossible that an electric field, a magnitude directed and not  superposable on its image in a mirror perpendicular to its direction,  could be created at right angles to the plane of symmetry of the  medium; while it would be possible to create a magnetic field under  the same conditions.    This consideration thus leads us to the discovery of new phenomena;  but it must be understood that it cannot of itself give us absolutely  precise notions as to the nature of these phenomena, nor disclose  their order of magnitude.      Sec. 2. THE PRINCIPLE OF THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY    Dominating not physics alone, but nearly every other science, the  principle of the conservation of energy is justly considered as the  grandest conquest of contemporary thought. It shows us in a powerful  light the most diverse questions; it introduces order into the most  varied studies; it leads to a clear and coherent interpretation of  phenomena which, without it, appear to have no connexion with each  other; and it supplies precise and exact numerical relations between  the magnitudes which enter into these phenomena.    The boldest minds have an instinctive confidence in it, and it is the  principle which has most stoutly resisted that assault which the  daring of a few theorists has lately directed to the overthrow of the  general principles of physics. At every new discovery, the first  thought of physicists is to find out how it accords with the principle  of the conservation of energy. The application of the principle,  moreover, never fails to give valuable hints on the new phenomenon,  and often even suggests a complementary discovery. Up till now it  seems never to have received a check, even the extraordinary  properties of radium not seriously contradicting it; also the general  form in which it is enunciated gives it such a suppleness that it is  no doubt very difficult to overthrow.    I do not claim to set forth here the complete history of this  principle, but I will endeavour to show with what pains it was born,  how it was kept back in its early days and then obstructed in its  development by the unfavourable conditions of the surroundings in  which it appeared. It first of all came, in fact, to oppose itself to  the reigning theories; but, little by little, it acted on these  theories, and they were modified under its pressure; then, in their  turn, these theories reacted on it and changed its primitive form.    It had to be made less wide in order to fit into the classic frame,  and was absorbed by mechanics; and if it thus became less general, it  gained in precision what it lost in extent. When once definitely  admitted and classed, as it were, in the official domain of science,  it endeavoured to burst its bonds and return to a more independent and  larger life. The history of this principle is similar to that of all  evolutions.    It is well known that the conservation of energy was, at first,  regarded from the point of view of the reciprocal transformations  between heat and work, and that the principle received its first clear  enunciation in the particular case of the principle of equivalence. It  is, therefore, rightly considered that the scholars who were the first  to doubt the material nature of caloric were the precursors of R.  Mayer; their ideas, however, were the same as those of the celebrated  German doctor, for they sought especially to demonstrate that heat was  a mode of motion.    Without going back to early and isolated attempts like those of Daniel  Bernoulli, who, in his hydrodynamics, propounded the basis of the  kinetic theory of gases, or the researches of Boyle on friction, we  may recall, to show how it was propounded in former times, a rather  forgotten page of the _Memoire sur la Chaleur_, published in 1780 by  Lavoisier and Laplace: \"Other physicists,\" they wrote, after setting  out the theory of caloric, \"think that heat is nothing but the result  of the insensible vibrations of matter.... In the system we are now  examining, heat is the _vis viva_ resulting from the insensible  movements of the molecules of a body; it is the sum of the products of  the mass of each molecule by the square of its velocity.... We shall  not decide between the two preceding hypotheses; several phenomena  seem to support the last mentioned--for instance, that of the heat  produced by the friction of two solid bodies. But there are others  which are more simply explained by the first, and perhaps they both  operate at once.\" Most of the physicists of that period, however, did  not share the prudent doubts of Lavoisier and Laplace. They admitted,  without hesitation, the first hypothesis; and, four years after the  appearance of the _Memoire sur la Chaleur_, Sigaud de Lafond, a  professor of physics of great reputation, wrote: \"Pure Fire, free from  all state of combination, seems to be an assembly of particles of a  simple, homogeneous, and absolutely unalterable matter, and all the  properties of this element indicate that these particles are  infinitely small and free, that they have no sensible cohesion, and  that they are moved in every possible direction by a continual and  rapid motion which is essential to them.... The extreme tenacity and  the surprising mobility of its molecules are manifestly shown by the  ease with which it penetrates into the most compact bodies and by its  tendency to put itself in equilibrium throughout all bodies near to  it.\"    It must be acknowledged, however, that the idea of Lavoisier and  Laplace was rather vague and even inexact on one important point. They  admitted it to be evident that \"all variations of heat, whether real  or apparent, undergone by a bodily system when changing its state, are  produced in inverse order when the system passes back to its original  state.\" This phrase is the very denial of equivalence where these  changes of state are accompanied by external work.    Laplace, moreover, himself became later a very convinced partisan of  the hypothesis of the material nature of caloric, and his immense  authority, so fortunate in other respects for the development of  science, was certainly in this case the cause of the retardation of  progress.    The names of Young, Rumford, Davy, are often quoted among those  physicists who, at the commencement of the nineteenth century, caught  sight of the new truths as to the nature of heat. To these names is  very properly added that of Sadi Carnot. A note found among his papers  unquestionably proves that,"]]]
