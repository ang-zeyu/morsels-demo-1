Antony gave a little  apologetic laugh and stood up.    \"Well, come on, Bill,\" he said; \"we ought to be stepping.\" He held out a  hand and pulled his friend up. Then, turning to Cayley, he went on, \"You  must forgive me if I have let my thoughts run on rather. Of course, I  was considering the matter purely as an outsider; just as a problem, I  mean, which didn't concern the happiness of any of my friends.\"    \"That's all right, Mr. Gillingham,\" said Cayley, standing up too. \"It  is for you to make allowances for me. I'm sure you will. You say that  you're going up to the inn now about your bag?\"    \"Yes.\" He looked up at the sun and then round the parkland stretching  about the house. \"Let me see; it's over in that direction, isn't it?\" He  pointed southwards. \"Can we get to the village that way, or must we go  by the road?\"    \"I'll show you, my boy,\" said Bill.    \"Bill will show you. The park reaches almost as far as the village. Then  I'll send the car round in about half an hour.\"    \"Thanks very much.\"    Cayley nodded and turned to go into the house. Antony took hold of  Bill's arm and walked off with him in the opposite direction.          CHAPTER VII. Portrait of a Gentleman      They walked in silence for a little, until they had left the house and  gardens well behind them. In front of them and to the right the park  dipped and then rose slowly, shutting out the rest of the world. A thick  belt of trees on the left divided them from the main road.    \"Ever been here before?\" said Antony suddenly.    \"Oh, rather. Dozens of times.\"    \"I meant just here where we are now. Or do you stay indoors and play  billiards all the time?\"    \"Oh Lord, no!\"    \"Well, tennis and things. So many people with beautiful parks never by  any chance use them, and all the poor devils passing by on the dusty  road think how lucky the owners are to have them, and imagine them doing  all sorts of jolly things inside.\" He pointed to the right. \"Ever been  over there?\"    Bill laughed, as if a little ashamed.    \"Well, not very much. I've often been along here, of course, because  it's the short way to the village.\"    \"Yes.... All right; now tell me something about Mark.\"    \"What sort of things?\"    \"Well, never mind about his being your host, or about your being a  perfect gentleman, or anything like that. Cut out the Manners for Men,  and tell me what you think of Mark, and how you like staying with him,  and how many rows your little house-party has had this week, and how you  get on with Cayley, and all the rest of it.\"    Bill looked at him eagerly.    \"I say, are you being the complete detective?\"    \"Well, I wanted a new profession,\" smiled the other.    \"What fun! I mean,\" he corrected himself apologetically, \"one oughtn't  to say that, when there's a man dead in the house, and one's host--\"  He broke off a little uncertainly, and then rounded off his period by  saying again, \"By Jove, what a rum show it is. Good Lord!\"    \"Well?\" said Antony. \"Carry on, Mark.\"    \"What do I think of him?\"    \"Yes.\"    Bill was silent, wondering how to put into words thoughts which had  never formed themselves very definitely in his own mind. What did he  think of Mark? Seeing his hesitation, Antony said:    \"I ought to have warned you that nothing that you say will be taken down  by the reporters, so you needn't bother about a split infinitive or two.  Talk about anything you like, how you like. Well, I'll give you a start.  Which do you enjoy more, a week-end here or at the Barrington's, say?\"    \"Well; of course, that would depend--\"    \"Take it that she was there in both cases.\"    \"Ass,\" said Bill, putting an elbow into Antony's ribs. \"It's a little  difficult to say,\" he went on. \"Of course they do you awfully well  here.\"    \"Yes.\"    \"I don't think I know any house where things are so comfortable. One's  room--the food--drinks--cigars--the way everything's arranged: All that  sort of thing. They look after you awfully well.\"    \"Yes?\"    \"Yes.\" He repeated it slowly to himself, as if it had given him a new  idea: \"They look after you awfully well. Well, that's just what it is  about Mark. That's one of his little ways. Weaknesses. Looking after  you.\"    \"Arranging things for you?\"    \"Yes. Of course, it's a delightful house, and there's plenty to do, and  opportunities for every game or sport that's ever been invented, and,  as I say, one gets awfully well done; but with it all, Tony, there's  a faint sort of feeling that well, that one is on parade, as it were.  You've got to do as you're told.\"    \"How do you mean?\"    \"Well, Mark fancies himself rather at arranging things. He arranges  things, and it's understood that the guests fall in with the  arrangement. For instance, Betty--Miss Calladine--and I were going to  play a single just before tea, the other day. Tennis. She's frightfully  hot stuff at tennis, and backed herself to take me on level. I'm rather  erratic, you know. Mark saw us going out with our rackets and asked us  what we were going to do. Well, he'd got up a little tournament for  us after tea--handicaps all arranged by him, and everything ruled out  neatly in red and black ink--prizes and all--quite decent ones, you  know. He'd had the lawn specially cut and marked for it. Well, of course  Betty and I wouldn't have spoilt the court, and we'd have been quite  ready to play again after tea--I had to give her half-fifteen according  to his handicap--but somehow--\" Bill stopped and shrugged his shoulders.    \"It didn't quite fit in?\"    \"No. It spoilt the effect of his tournament. Took the edge off it just  a little, I suppose he felt. So we didn't play.\" He laughed, and added,  \"It would have been as much as our place was worth to have played.\"    \"Do you mean you wouldn't have been asked here again?\"    \"Probably. Well, I don't know. Not for some time, anyway.\"    \"Really, Bill?\"    \"Oh, rather! He's a devil for taking offence. That Miss Norris, did you  see her? She's done for herself. I don't mind betting what you like that  she never comes here again.\"    \"Why?\"    Bill laughed to himself.    \"We were all in it, really--at least, Betty and I were. There's supposed  to be a ghost attached to the house. Lady Anne Patten. Ever heard of  her?\"    \"Never.\"    \"Mark told us about her at dinner one night. He rather liked the idea  of there being a ghost in his house, you know; except that he doesn't  believe in ghosts. I think he wanted all of us to believe in her, and  yet he was annoyed with Betty and Mrs. Calladine for believing in ghosts  at all. Rum chap. Well, anyhow, Miss Norris--she's an actress, some  actress too--dressed up as the ghost and played the fool a bit. And poor  Mark was frightened out of his life. Just for a moment, you know.\"    \"What about the others?\"    \"Well, Betty and I knew; in fact, I'd told her--Miss Norris I mean--not  to be a silly ass. Knowing Mark. Mrs. Calladine wasn't there--Betty  wouldn't let her be. As for the Major, I don't believe anything would  frighten him.\"    \"Where did the ghost appear?\"    \"Down by the bowling-green. That's supposed to be its haunt, you know.  We were all down there in the moonlight, pretending to wait for it. Do  you know the bowling-green?\"    \"No.\"    \"I'll show it to you after dinner.\"    \"I wish you would.... Was Mark very angry afterwards?\"    \"Oh, Lord, yes. Sulked for a whole day. Well, he's just like that.\"    \"Was he angry with all of you?\"    \"Oh, yes sulky, you know.\"    \"This morning?\"    \"Oh, no. He got over it--he generally does. He's just like a child.  That's really it, Tony; he's like a child in some ways. As a matter of  fact, he was unusually bucked with himself this morning. And yesterday.\"    \"Yesterday?\"    \"Rather. We all said we'd never seen him in such form.\"    \"Is he generally in form?\"    \"He's quite good company, you know, if you take him the right way.  He's rather vain and childish well, like I've been telling you and  self-important; but quite amusing in his way, and--\" Bill broke off  suddenly. \"I say, you know, it really is the limit, talking about your  host like this.\"    \"Don't think of him as your host. Think of him as a suspected murderer  with a warrant out against him.\"    \"Oh! but that's all rot, you know.\"    \"It's the fact, Bill.\"    \"Yes, but I mean, he didn't do it. He wouldn't murder anybody. It's a  funny thing to say, but well, he's not big enough for it. He's got his  faults, like all of us, but they aren't on that scale.\"    \"One can kill anybody in a childish fit of temper.\"    Bill grunted assent, but without prejudice to Mark. \"All the same,\" he  said, \"I can't believe it. That he would do it deliberately, I mean.\"    \"Suppose it was an accident, as Cayley says, would he lose his head and  run away?\"    Bill considered for a moment.    \"Yes, I really think he might, you know. He nearly ran away when he saw  the ghost. Of course, that's different, rather.\"    \"Oh, I don't know. In each case it's a question of obeying your instinct  instead of your reason.\"    They had left the open land and were following a path through the  bordering trees. Two abreast was uncomfortable, so Antony dropped  behind, and further conversation was postponed until they were outside  the boundary fence and in the high road. The road sloped gently down to  the village of Waldheim--a few red-roofed cottages, and the grey tower of  a church showing above the green.    \"Well, now,\" said Antony, as they stepped out more quickly, \"what about  Cayley?\"    \"How do you mean, what about him?\"    \"I want to see him. I can see Mark perfectly, thanks to you, Bill. You  were wonderful. Now let's have Cayley's character. Cayley from within.\"    Bill laughed in pleased embarrassment, and protested that he was not a  blooming novelist.    \"Besides,\" he added, \"Mark's easy. Cayley's one of these heavy, quiet  people, who might be thinking about anything. Mark gives himself  away.... Ugly, black-jawed devil, isn't he?\"    \""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18721"],[0,"The Victim: A Romance of the Real Jefferson Davis (#10)"],[1,"--I'm  afraid--I just can't help it--I'm afraid. I've always had a horror of  such things. I've a presentiment that you'll die that way--\"    \"Presentiments and dreams go by opposites. I'll live to a ripe old  age--\"    She looked up into his face with a tender smile:    \"You think so?\"    \"Yes, why not?\"    \"Well--I've something to tell you--\"    She paused and the man bent low.    \"What?\"    \"I've made a vow to God--\" the voice stopped with a sob--\"that if He  will only send you safely back to me this time--I'll wait no longer on  my father's whim--I am yours--\"    The lover clasped her trembling form to his heart.    \"Good-by, dearest,\" he said at last. \"I wish to go with that promise  ringing in my soul.\"    Ten days after he reached Lexington, the cholera broke out, and hundreds  fled. He stood by his men, watched their diet, nursed the sick, and  buried the dead. He helped the carpenter make the coffins and reverently  bore the victims to their graves. No fear was in his soul. Love was  chanting the anthem of Life.    A strange new light was burning in the eyes of the woman he loved on the  day he returned in safety.    She seized his hand and spoke with decision:    \"Come with me.\"    Her father was standing at the gate. She faced him, holding defiantly  the hand of her lover.    The old man saw and understood. His jaw was set with sullen  determination and his face hardened.    \"We have waited two long years,\" she began softly. \"We have been patient  and hopeful, but you have given no sign. My lover's character is beyond  reproach, and I am proud of him. I am sorry to cross you, Father, but  I've made up my mind, I am going to marry him now.\"    The Colonel turned in silence and slowly walked into the house.    Captain McCrea engaged a stateroom for her on the boat for Louisville.  The lovers planned to meet at her aunt's, the Colonel's oldest sister.  The tearful good-bys had been said to Mother and sisters and brother.    The Colonel had not spoken, but he had business on the boat before she  cast her lines from the shore.    The daughter drew him into her stateroom and slipped her arms around his  neck. Few words were spoken and they were broken.    \"Please, Father--please?--I love you--please--\"    \"No.\"    \"I'm no longer a child. I'm a woman. You're a real man and you know I  could have no respect for myself if I should yield my life's happiness  to a whim--\"    The old Colonel stroked her shoulder:    \"I understand. You're a chip off the old block. You're just as stubborn  as I am. And--I--won't--eat--my--words.\"    With firm hand, he drew away and hurried from the boat.    The Taylor clan of Kentucky gathered for the wedding in force. The  romance appealed to their fancy. They loved their high-spirited,  self-poised little kinswoman and they liked the tall, modest, young  officer she had chosen for her husband. The stern old Colonel was not  there, but his brother and his three sisters and all their tribe made  merry at the wedding feast.    On the deck of the lazy river steamer, the bride and groom slowly  drifted down the moonlit shimmering way to the fields of Mississippi.    The bride nestled close to her lover's side in the long sweet silences  too deep for words.    He took her hand in his at last, and said tenderly:    \"I've something very important to tell you now, my dear--\"    \"I'm not afraid--\"    \"You trust me implicitly?\"    \"Perfectly--\"    \"You have given up all for me,\" he went on evenly, \"I'll show your  father what I can do for you--\"    \"You love me--it's enough.\"    \"No. I have resigned my commission in the army. I have given up my  career. We'll live only for each other now and build our nest in the far  sunny South beyond the frost line.\"    A little smothered cry was her answer. And then her head slowly sank  with a sob on his breast.          XI    THE FAIRY BELLS      They built their home on the banks of the great river where the tide  sweeps in graceful curve, all but completing the circle of an enchanted  isle.    From the little flower-veiled porch through festoons of lacing boughs  gleamed the waters of the huge curved mirror held by Nature's hand. The  music from the decks of the steamers floated up on the soft air until  music and perfume of flowers seemed one.    In the cool of the morning, on swift, high-bred horses, they rode side  by side along the river's towering bluff and laughed in sheer joy at  their foolish happiness. In the waning afternoon, hand in hand, they  walked the sunlit fields and paused at dusk to hear the songs of slaves.  The happiness of lovers is contagious. It sets the hearts of slaves to  singing.    In the white solemn splendor of the Southern moon they strolled through  enchanted paths of scented roses. On the rustic seat beneath a magnolia  in full second bloom they listened to the song of a mocking-bird whose  mate had built her nest in the rose trellis beside their door. They  could count the beat of his bird heart night after night as he sang the  glory of his love and the beauty of his coming brood of young.    \"You are happy, dearest?\" the lover sighed.    \"In heaven,--I am with you.\"    \"And it shall be forever.\"    \"Forever!\"    \"The old life of blood and strife--it seems an ugly dream.\"    \"Except for the sweet days when you were near.\"    \"This only is life, my own, to hold your hand, and walk the way  together, to build, not to destroy, to make flowers bloom, birds and  slaves sing, to create, not kill--production is communion with God. We  live now in His peace that passeth understanding!\"    A long silence followed. An owl in a distant tree top gave a shrill  plaintive cry. The bride nestled closer and he felt her shiver.    \"You are chill, dearest?\" he murmured.    \"Just a little.\"    \"We're forgetting the late August night winds--\"    \"No--no--it's nothing--I'm just a wee bit afraid of an owl, that's all.\"    A dark figure slowly approached and stood with uncovered head.    \"What is it, James?\" the master asked.    \"It's too late, sir, for you and the mistis to be out in dis air--it's  chill an' fever time--\"    \"Thank you, James--we'll go in at once.\"    When the faithful footfall had died away, the lover lifted his bride in  his arms and carried her in, while she softly laughed and clung to his  strong young shoulders.    It came with swift, sure tread, the silent white figure of the  Pestilence that walks in Tropic Splendor.    The lover laughed the doctor's fears to scorn and the old man was brave  and cheerful in the presence of youth and happiness.    James Pemberton followed him to the gate and held his horse's bridle  with a tremor in his black hand.    \"You don't think, doctor--\" he paused, afraid to say the thing--\"you  don't think my young mistis gwine ter die?\"    \"She's very ill, Jim--it's an even fight for life.\"    \"Ef she do--hit'll kill my young marster--\"    \"Soldiers can't die that way--no--\"    \"Yassah--but dey ain't been married but three months, sah, an' he des  worship de very groun' her little foot walks on--she des can't die--she  too young an' putty, sah--hit des natchally can't be--\"    The doctor's gray head slowly moved as if in remembrance of tragic  scenes.    \"Death loves a shining mark sometimes!\"    He turned to the slave in tones of warning:    \"Watch your master closely--\"    \"My _marster_--sah!\"    \"He'll go down next--\"    \"Yassah--yassah!\"    Two days later, the strong man collapsed with a crash that took even the  experienced old doctor by surprise. An iron will had bent over the  bedside of his bride and fought with grim defiance the battle with  unseen foe until the last ounce of strength had gone.    In his delirium they moved him to another room and he awoke to find  himself in a prison cell on a desert island a thousand miles from the  mate he adored.    He watched his jailers and at last his hour came. The tired guard beside  his prison pallet slept. With fevered stealth he rose and with the  strength of a giant, bent the bars of his cage and crawled and fought  his way over hill and valley, rocks and mountains, back to the bedside  of his beloved.    He paused in rapture at the door. She was sitting up in bed, the pillows  propped behind her back, singing their favorite song--\"Fairy Bells.\" How  soft and weirdly sweet her voice--its notes so far away and  plaintive--never had she sung so divinely!    He held his breath lest a word or quiver of its melody should be lost.  And then he slipped his strong arms about her and looked into her eyes  shining with unearthly beauty.    \"You have come at last, my own!\" she sighed. \"I knew the Bells would  call you--\"    \"Yes--dearest--and I'll never leave you again--they took me away a  wounded prisoner of war--but I broke the bars and came when I heard you  call--\"    \"Look,\" she whispered, pointing with the slender blue-veined finger,  \"there she is, in the doorway again with her baby in her arms, waving at  sunset to her lover on the hill?--what does it matter, a cabin or a  palace!\"    The shining eyes grew dim, the figure drooped, and a wild piteous cry  came from the lover's fevered lips:    \"Lord God of Love and Pity--she's dying!--Help--Help--Help!\"    His faithful servant, worn with watching day and night, heard the cry,  rushed to his side and caught his fainting form, as the light of the  world faded.          XII    TRUTH      They nursed him slowly back into life again, the loving heart of the  older brother guiding the arm of his faithful slave.    He refused to live at first.    \"It's no use, Joe,\" he cried with bitter despair. \"Life isn't worth the  struggle any more. I'm tired, I just want to rest--by her side--that's  all.\"    \"I know, Boy, how you feel. But you must live. Duty calls. Great events  are stirring the world. You've a man's part to play--\"    \"I won't play it. I'm done with ambition. I'm done with strife. The  game's not worth the candle. I've lived the only life worth living, and  it's finished.\""]]]
