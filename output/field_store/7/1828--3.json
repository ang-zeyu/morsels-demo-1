Mouth-washes, it must  be remembered, are as much used for rinsing the mouth after smoking as  for a dentifrice.    MYRTLE.--A very fragrant otto may be procured by distilling  both flowers and leaves of the common myrtle; one hundred-weight will  yield about five ounces of the volatile oil. The demand for essence of  myrtle being very limited, the odor as found in the perfumers' shops is  very rarely a genuine article, but it is imitated thus:--    IMITATION ESSENCE OF MYRTLE.    Extract of vanilla,             1/2 pint.     \"       roses                  1  \"  Extract of fleur d'orange,      1/2 pint.      \"      tubereuse,           1/2  \"      \"      jasmine,                 2 oz.    Mix and allow to stand for a fortnight: it is then fit for bottling, and  is a perfume that gives a great deal of satisfaction.    Myrtle-flower water is sold in France under the name of eau d'ange, and  may be prepared like rose, elder, or other flower waters.    NEROLI, OR ORANGE-FLOWER.--Two distinct odors are procurable  from the orange-blossom, varying according to the methods adopted for  procuring them. This difference of perfume from the same flower is a  great advantage to the manufacturer. This curious fact is worthy of  inquiry by the chemical philosopher. It is not peculiar to the  orange-flower, but applies to many others, especially rose--probably to  all flowers.    When orange-flowers are treated by the maceration process, that is, by  infusion in a fatty body, we procure orange-flower pomatum, its strength  and quality being regulated by the number of infusions of the flower  made in the same grease.    By digesting this orange-flower pomatum in rectified spirits in the  proportions of from six pounds to eight pounds of pomade to a gallon of  spirit, for about a fortnight at a summer heat, we obtain the extrait de  fleur d'orange, or extract of orange-flowers, a handkerchief perfume  surpassed by none. In this state its odor resembles the original so  much, that with closed eyes the best judge could not distinguish the  scent of the extract from that of the flower. The peculiar flowery odor  of this extract renders it valuable to perfumers, not only to sell in a  pure state, but slightly modified with other _extraits_ passes for  \"sweet pea,\" \"magnolia,\" &c., which it slightly resembles in fragrance.    [Illustration: Orange.]    Now, when orange-flowers are distilled with water, we procure the otto  of the blossom, which is known commercially as oil of neroli. The neroli  procured from the flowers of the Citrus aurantium is considered to be  the finest quality, and is called \"neroli petale.\" The next quality,  \"neroli bigarade,\" is derived from the blossoms of the _Citrus  bigaradia_, or Seville orange. Another quality, which is considered  inferior to the preceding, is the neroli petit grain, obtained by  distilling the leaves and the young unripe fruit of the different  species of the citrus.    The \"petale\" and \"bigarade\" neroli are used to an enormous extent in the  manufacture of eau de Cologne and other handkerchief perfumes. The petit  grain is mainly consumed for scenting soap. To form the esprit de  neroli, dissolve 1-1/2 oz. of neroli petale in one gallon of rectified  spirits. Although very agreeable, and extensively used in the  manufacture of bouquets, it has no relation to the flowery odor of the  extrait de fleur d'orange, as derived from the same flowers by  maceration; in fact, it has as different an odor as though obtained from  another plant, yet in theory both these _extraits_ are but alcoholic  solutions of the otto of the flower.    The water used for distillation in procuring the neroli, when well freed  from the oil, is imported into this country under the name of eau de  fleur d'orange, and may be used, like elder-flower and rose-water, for  the skin, and as an eye lotion. It is remarkable for its fine fragrance,  and it is astonishing that it is not more used, being moderate in price.  (See _Syringa_.)    NUTMEG.--The beautiful odor of the nutmeg is familiar to all.  Though an otto can be drawn from them of a very fragrant character, it  is rarely used in perfumery. The ground nuts are, however, used  advantageously in the combinations of scented powders used for scent  bags.--See \"Sachet's Powders.\"    OLIBANUM is a gum resin, used to a limited extent in this  country, in the manufacture of incense and pastilles. It is chiefly  interesting as being one of those odoriferous bodies of which frequent  mention is made in the Holy volume.[C]    \"It is believed,\" says Burnett, \"to have been one of the ingredients in  the sweet incense of the Jews; and it is still burnt as incense in the  Greek and Romish churches, where the diffusion of such odors round the  altar forms a part of the prescribed religious service.\"    Olibanum is partially soluble in alcohol, and, like most of the balsams,  probably owes its perfume to a peculiar odoriferous body, associated  with the benzoic acid it contains.    For making the tincture or extract of olibanum, take 1 pound of the gum  to 1 gallon of the spirit.    ORANGE.--Under the title \"Neroli\" we have already spoken of the  odoriferous principle of the orange-blossom. We have now to speak of  what is known in the market as Essence of Orange, or, as it is more  frequently termed, Essence of Portugal,--a name, however, which we  cannot admit in a classified list of the \"odors of plants.\"    The otto of orange-peel, or odoriferous principle of the orange fruit,  is procured by expression and by distillation. The peel is rasped in  order to crush the little vessels or sacs that imprison the otto.    Its abundance in the peel is shown by pinching a piece near the flame of  a candle; the otto that spirts out ignites with a brilliant  illumination.    It has many uses in perfumery, and from its refreshing fragrance finds  many admirers.    It is the leading ingredient in what is sold as \"Lisbon Water\" and \"Eau  de Portugal.\" The following is a very useful form for preparing    LISBON WATER.    Rectified spirit (not less than 60 over proof),      1 gallon.  Otto of orange peel,                                     3 oz.    \"     lemon peel,                                      3 oz.    \"     rose                                           1/4 oz.    This is a form for    EAU DE PORTUGAL.    Rectified spirit (60 over proof),      1 gallon.  Essential oil of orange peel,              6 oz.     \"             lemon peel,               1 oz.     \"             lemon grass,            1/4 oz.     \"             bergamot,                 1 oz.     \"             otto of rose,           1/4 oz.    It should be noted that these perfumes are never to be filled into wet  bottles, for if in any way damp from water, a minute portion of the  ottos are separated, which gives an opalescent appearance to the  mixture. Indeed, all bottles should be _spirit rinsed_ prior to being  filled with any perfume, but especially with those containing essences  of orange or lemon peel.    ORRIS, properly IRIS.--The dried rhizome of _Iris  florentina_ has a very pleasant odor, which, for the want of a better  comparison, is said to resemble the smell of violets; it is, however,  exceedingly derogatory to the charming aroma of that modest flower when  such invidious comparisons are made. Nevertheless the perfume of iris  root is good, and well worthy of the place it has obtained as a  perfuming substance. The powder of orris root is very extensively used  in the manufacture of sachet powders, tooth-powder, &c. It fathers that  celebrated \"oriental herb\" known as \"Odonto.\" For tincture of orris, or,  as the perfumers call it,    EXTRACT OF ORRIS,    Take orris root, crushed,        7 lbs.  Rectified spirits,            1 gallon.    After standing together for about a fortnight, the extract is fit to  take off. It requires considerable time to drain away, and, to prevent  loss, the remainder of the orris should be placed in the tincture press.  This extract enters into the composition of many of the most celebrated  bouquets, such as \"Jockey Club,\" and others, but is never sold alone,  because its odor, although grateful, is not sufficiently good to stand  public opinion upon its own merits; but in combination its value is very  great; possessing little aroma itself, yet it has the power of  strengthening the odor of other fragrant bodies; like the flint and  steel, which though comparatively incombustible, readily fire  inflammable bodies.    PALM.--The odor of palm oil--the fat oil of commerce--is due to  a fragrant principle which it contains. By infusion in alcohol, the  odoriferous body is dissolved, and resembles, to a certain extent, the  tincture of orris, or of extract of violet, but is very indifferent, and  is not likely to be brought into use, though several attempts have been  made to render it of service when the cultivation of the violets have  failed from bad seasons.    PATCHOULY.--_Pogostemon patchouly_ (LINDLEY),  _Plectranthus crassifolius_ (BURNETT), is an herb that grows  extensively in India and China. It somewhat resembles our garden sage in  its growth and form, but the leaves are not so fleshy.    [Illustration: Patchouly.]    The odor of patchouly is due to an otto contained in the leaves and  stems, and is readily procured by distillation. 1 cwt. of good herb will  yield about 28 oz. of the essential oil, which is of a dark brown color,  and of a density about the same as that of oil of sandal wood, which it  resembles in its physical character. Its odor is the most powerful of  any derived from the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16379"],[0,"Children's Classics in Dramatic Form, Book Two (#10)"],[1,"bows  aloft to make an arch.
