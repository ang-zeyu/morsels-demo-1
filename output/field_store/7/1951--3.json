The splendid exhibit of the French aluminum manufacturers at the late  Exhibition has again called attention to that metal, which is so  admirably adapted to many purposes on account of its great lightness  and its stability under the influence of the atmosphere. While  aluminum industry has heretofore been thought to be confined to France  solely, we are now told by Mr. C. Bambery, in the Annual Report of the  Society of Berlin Instrument Makers, that for some years past aluminum  has been extensively manufactured in Berlin.    Three firms especially (Stueckradt, Haecke, and Schultze) are engaged in  this branch of industry.    The articles manufactured principally are nautical instruments, as  sextants, compasses, etc. The German navy is supplied throughout with  aluminum instruments. As a proof of the superiority of German  aluminum, it may here be mentioned that the normal sets of weights and  balances used by the International Commission for the regulation of  weights and measures, which lately was in session at Paris, were  obtained from Stueckradt, in Berlin, and not from any of the firms  at Paris, the reputed seat of aluminum industry.    Aluminum is, in Berlin, generally used pure, and cast pieces only are  composed of aluminum containing about 5 per cent of silver.    Nevertheless the use of aluminum will remain limited, even in case the  cost of manufacturing it could be materially reduced, until some  method shall have been discovered by which aluminum may be soldered.    This difficulty has, in spite of all efforts, not yet been overcome,  and for some purposes, to which the metal would otherwise be well  adapted, it remains so far unavailable. Here then is a chance for some  ingenious mind.           *       *       *       *       *          AN IMPROVED DOOR BOLT.      The accompanying engraving represents, in perspective and in section,  an improved door bolt, recently patented by Mr. Thomas Hoesly, of New  Glaras, Wis.    The principal features of this bolt will be understood by reference to  the engraving. On the plate or body are cast two loops or guides for  the bolt, and the plate is slotted under the bolt, and a lug projects  into the slot and bears against a spring contained by a small casing  riveted to the back of the plate. The end of the bolt is beveled, and  its operation is similar to that of the ordinary door latch. Two  handles are provided, one of which is of sufficient length to reach  through the door, and a pawl or dog accompanies the bolt, which may be  attached to the door with a single screw, and is to be used in locking  the door. The bolt is very simple and strong, suitable for shops,  out-buildings such as barns, stables, etc., and some of the doors of  dwellings.    [Illustration: HOESLY'S DOOR BOLT.]    Further information may be obtained by addressing the inventor, as  above.           *       *       *       *       *          CHIMNEY FLUES.      Messrs. W. H. Jackson & Co., of this city, whose long experience in  treating refractory flues gives weight to their opinion, communicate  to the _American Architect_ the following useful information:    To secure a good draught the chimney should be of sufficient size,  should be carried up above surrounding objects, should be as straight  as possible throughout its length, and should be as smooth as possible  inside, to avoid friction. As a draught is caused by unequal  temperatures, the chimney should be so arranged as to avoid a rapid  radiation of heat. If in an exterior wall there should be at least 8  inches of brickwork between the flue and the exterior surface. For  country houses it is much better to have the chimneys run up through  the interior, as the flue is more easily kept warm, and the heat that  is radiated helps to warm the house. The most frequent cause of a  \"smoky chimney\" is the insufficient size of the flue for the grate or  fireplace connected therewith. The flue should not be less than one  eighth the capacity of the square of the width and height of the grate  or fireplace. That is, if the grate has a front opening 20 inches wide  and 26 inches high, the flue should be 8 in. x 8 in.; or, with an  opening 36 inches wide and 32 inches high, the flue should be 12 in. x  12 in.; and, to get the best result, the opening into the flue from  the grate or fireplace should be of a less number of square inches  than the square of the flue, and never larger, as no more air should  be admitted at the inlet than can be carried through the flue. Where  there is more than one inlet to the same flue, the sum of all the  inlets should not more than equal the size of the flue. A number of  stoves may be connected with the same flue, one above another, if this  rule is observed.    A square flue is better than a narrow one, as in two flues containing  the same number of square inches the square flue would have the  smallest amount of wall surface, and consequently less friction for  the ascending currents, and less absorption of heat by the walls.  Chimneys should be closely built, having no cracks nor openings  through which external air may be drawn to weaken the draught. If they  could be made throughout their length as impervious to air as a tube  of glass, with interior surface as smooth, one cause of smoky chimneys  would be removed. A downward current of air is frequently caused by  some contiguous object higher than the chimney, against which the wind  strikes. This higher object may sometimes be quite a distance from the  chimney, and still affect it badly. A good chimney top constructed to  prevent a down draught will remedy this difficulty. Each grate or  fireplace should have a flue to itself. Under very favorable  conditions, two grates or fireplaces might be connected with the same  flue, but it is not a good plan. We have known grates and fireplaces  connected with two flues, where they have been built under a window  for instance, and, owing to there being insufficient room for a flue  of suitable size, a flue has been run up on each side of the window.  This is a very bad plan, and never can work well; it requires too much  heat to warm both flues, and if the room in which the grate or  fireplace is situated should be pretty close, so that there was no  other entrance for air, there is danger that it would circulate down  one flue and up the other, forcing smoke out of the fireplace into the  room.           *       *       *       *       *          IMPROVED FURNACE FOR BURNING GARBAGE.      The refuse matter and garbage of large cities is in the main composed  of animal and vegetable offal of the kitchens; of the sweepings of  warehouses, manufactories, saloons, groceries, public and private  houses; of straw, sawdust, old bedding, tobacco stems, ashes, old  boots, shoes, tin cans, bottles, rags, and feathers; dead cats, dogs,  and other small animals; of the dust and sweepings of the streets, the  condemned fruit, vegetables, meat, and fish of the markets, all of  which compose a mass of the most obnoxious and unhealthy matter that  can be deposited near human habitations.    The inventor of the furnace shown in the accompanying engravings aims  to produce a change of form and of chemical nature and a great  reduction in bulk of all such refuse and garbage within the limits of  the city where it accumulates, without screening, separating,  preparing, or mixing, without the expense of using other fuel, without  any offensive odors being generated in the operation, and to produce  an entirely unobjectionable residuum or product that may be made  useful.    [Illustration: Fig. 1.--FOOTE'S FURNACE FOR BURNING GARBAGE.]    As a rule organic matter largely preponderates in the refuse, being as  high in some instances as 94 per cent. There is always more than  enough to generate sufficient heat to fuse the earthy or inorganic  portion, which is mainly composed of sand, clay, and the alkalies from  the coal and vegetable ashes, etc.    By producing a high degree of heat in the combustion of the organic  portion of the refuse with a forced blast or forced draught, the  non-combustible elements are fused, and form a vitreous slag, which is  entirely inodorous and unobjectionable, and which may be utilized for  many purposes.    The upper section or cone of the consuming furnace is built of boiler  iron, and lined with fire brick resting upon an iron plate, which is  supported by iron columns.    The hearth is made of fire brick, and is in the form of an inverted  cone, being smaller at the bottom and larger at the top, as shown in  Fig. 2.    The sides of the hearth are perforated near the bottom with arches for  the tuyeres or blast pipes, and also in front for the special blast  pipe and the tapping hole. The top of the furnace is closed with an  iron plate, provided with a circular opening, through which the hopper  enters the top of the furnace.    At the left in the larger engraving is seen an elevator, operated by a  steam engine, for conveying the garbage and refuse to a platform,  whence it is projected into the furnace by an inclined plane or chute.    Gas or smoke conductors convey the gas from the top of the furnace to  the furnace of the boiler and to the heating oven, where it is used in  heating air, which is conveyed through the iron pipes passing through  the heating oven into a wind box, from which it enters the furnace at  several points"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18880"],[0,"The New York Times Current History: the European War, February, 1915 (#10)"],[1,"to some malign  influence rather than to his own recklessness. When in this depressed  mood the more violent natures are apt to have recourse to extreme  measures.    By bearing in mind this national peculiarity the reader will more easily  understand the strange events which followed close on the heels of the  great reforms which I have just mentioned. Alexander II. was preparing  to advance further along the path on which he had entered so  successfully, when his reforming ardor was suddenly cooled by alarming  symptoms of a widespread revolutionary agitation. Many members of the  young generation, male and female, had imbibed the most advanced  political and socialist theories of France and Germany, and they  imagined that, by putting these into practice, Russia might advance by a  single bound far beyond the more conservative nations and set an example  for imitation to the future generations of humanity! The less violent of  these enthusiasts, recognizing that a certain amount of preparatory work  was necessary, undertook a campaign of propaganda among the lower  classes, as factory workers in the towns and school teachers in the  villages. The more violent, on the contrary, considered that a quicker  and more efficient method of attaining the desired object was the  destruction of autocracy by revolvers and bombs, and several attempts  were accordingly made on the lives of the Czar and his advisers. For  more than ten years, undismayed by these revolutionary manifestations,  Alexander II. clung to his ideas of reform, but at last, in 1881, on the  eve of issuing a decree for the convocation of a National Assembly, he  fell a victim to the bomb throwers.    The practical result of all this was that for the next quarter of a  century no great reforms were initiated, but those already effected were  consolidated, and some progress was made in a quiet, unostentatious way,  especially in the sphere of economic development.    A new period of reform began after the Japanese war, and this time the  reform current took the direction of parliamentary institutions. At  last, after much waiting, the political aspirations of the educated  classes were partially realized, so that Russia has now a Chamber of  Deputies, called the Imperial Duma, freely elected by the people, and an  upper house, called the Imperial Council, whose members are selected  partly by election and partly by nomination.    What strikes a stranger on first entering the Duma is the variety of  costumes, showing plainly that all classes of the population are  represented. There are landed proprietors not unlike English country  squires; long-haired priests in ecclesiastical robes; workingmen from  the factories and peasants from the villages in their Sunday clothes;  one or two Cossacks in uniform; Mussulmans from the Eastern provinces in  semi-Oriental attire. The various nationalities seem to live happily  together--Great Russians, Little Russians, Poles, Lithuanians,  Russo-Germans, Circassians, Tartars, &c. Almost as numerous as the  nationalities are the recognized political parties--Conservatives,  Nationalists, Liberals, Radicals, Labor Members, Social Democrats, and  Socialists. Great liberty of speech is allowed, but the President has  generally no difficulty in keeping order.    Thus, to all appearance, the Duma seems exactly what was required to  complete the edifice of self-government founded fifty years ago; but we  must not suppose that a Constitution not yet ten years old can be as  strong and efficient as a Constitution which has gradually emerged from  centuries of political struggle. In other words, the Russian Duma  differs in many respects from the British House of Commons. One  fundamental difference may be cited by way of example. In England, as  all the world knows, the Cabinet is practically chosen by the party  which happens to be predominant for the moment, and as soon as it fails  to command a majority it must resign; whereas in Russia, as in Germany,  the Cabinet is nominated by the Emperor. This is, of course, a very  important difference, and all to our advantage, but it is not so great  in practice as in theory. The Czar, though free theoretically to choose  his Ministers as he pleases, must choose such men as can obtain a  working majority in the Assembly; otherwise, the whole parliamentary  machinery comes to a standstill. Such a deadlock actually occurred in  the First Duma. Smarting under the humiliation of the Japanese war,  attributing the defeats to the incurable incapacity of the Supreme  Government, and believing that the old system had become too weak to  withstand a vigorous assault, the majority of the Deputies resolved to  abolish at once the autocratic power and replace it by ultra-democratic  institutions. They accordingly adopted, from the very first day of the  session, an attitude of irreconcilable hostility to the Cabinet, refused  to listen to Ministerial explanations, abstained from all useful  legislative work, and carried their strategy of obstruction so far that  the Government had to take refuge in a dissolution.    For this unfortunate result, which tended to retard the natural growth  of constitutional freedom in Russia, the Government was severely blamed  by many of its critics, but I venture to think that a large share of the  responsibility must be attributed to the unreasonable impatience of the  Deputies and their supporters. In defense of this opinion I might adduce  many strong arguments, but I confine myself to citing a significant  little incident from my personal experience. Happening to meet at dinner  one evening immediately after the dissolution an old friend who had  played a leading part in the policy of obstruction, I took the liberty  of remarking to him that he and his party appeared to me to have  committed a strategical mistake. If they had shown themselves ready to  co-operate with the Government in resisting the dangerous revolutionary  movement and favoring moderate reforms, they might have made for  themselves, in the course of nine or ten years, a very influential  position in the parliamentary system, and might have greatly advanced  the cause of democracy which they had at heart. Here my friend  interrupted me with the exclamation: \"Nine or ten years? We can't wait  so long as that!\"    The Second Duma was shipwrecked, like its predecessor, through youthful  impatience. Among the Deputies there was a small group of Social  Democrats who attempted to prepare a military insurrection, and when the  conspiracy was discovered there was great reason to fear that the  Government might adopt a reactionary policy; but it happily confined  itself to some changes in the suffrage regulations and a dissolution of  the Chamber, followed by a general election. Since that time the  parliamentary machinery has worked much more smoothly. The Duma has  learned the truth of the old adage that half a loaf is better than no  bread, and on many important subjects, such as the preparation of the  annual budget, it now co-operates loyally with the Ministers. In this  way it gets its half loaf, and the country benefits by the new-born  spirit of compromise.    Before going further, perhaps I ought to warn my readers that I am often  reproached by my Russian friends with taking too favorable a view of the  Duma and of many other things in Russia. To this I usually reply by  taking those friends to task for their habitual pessimism in criticising  themselves and their institutions. Naturally inclined to idealism, and  not possessing sufficient hereditary experience to correct this  tendency, they compare their institutions with ideals which nowhere  exist in the real world, and consequently they condemn them very  severely. The impartial foreigner who wishes to form a true estimate of  these institutions must always take this into account. In spite of the  impassioned philippics to which I have listened hundreds of times from  my Russian friends, I am strongly of opinion that the Russian people  have made in recent years considerable progress in their political  education, and that they will continue to do so in the future.    But how is genuine national progress possible so long as the great mass  of the population are grossly ignorant, conservative, and superstitious?  Here again we must beware of adopting current exaggerations. To begin  with the peasantry, who are by far the most numerous class, we must  admit that they are very far from being well educated, but they are keen  to learn and they gladly send their children to the village schools,  which have been greatly increased and improved in recent years. Another  source of education is the army. Since the introduction of universal  military service every unlettered recruit must learn to read and write.  A third educational agency is the peculiar village organization. As  every head of a family has a house of his own and a share of the  communal land, he is a miniature farmer; and, unlike agricultural  laborers, who need not look much ahead beyond the weekly pay day, he  must make his agricultural and domestic arrangements for an entire year,  under pain of incurring starvation or falling into the clutches of the  usurer. This is in itself a sort of practical education. Then he has to  attend regularly the meetings of the village assembly, at which all  communal affairs are discussed and decided. To this I must add that he  is by no means obstinately conservative. Habitually cautious, he may be  slow to change his traditional habits and methods of cultivation, but he  does change them when he sees, by the experience of his neighbors, that  new methods are more profitable than old ones. Ask any dealer in  improved implements and machines how many he has sold to peasants in a  single year. Or ask any director of a peasant land bank how many  thousand peasants within the area of his activity are purchasing land  outside the"]]]
