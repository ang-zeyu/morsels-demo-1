And although  their productions, which were nothing but translations of great man's  art into average man's art, became popular, as was inevitable, with the  average man of their time, (who comprehended them better and felt more  comfortable in their presence than in that of the originals which he  respectfully admired but did not so thoroughly enjoy), nevertheless we  need not dwell on these popularisers nor on their popularisations--not  even on Filippino, with his touch of consumptive delicacy, nor  Raffaelino del Garbo, with his glints of never-to-be-fulfilled promise.    [Page heading: FRA BARTOLOMMEO]    Before approaching the one man of genius left in Florence after  Botticelli and Leonardo, before speaking of Michelangelo, the man in  whom all that was most peculiar and much that was greatest in the  striving of Florentine art found its fulfilment, let us turn for a  moment to a few painters who, just because they were men of manifold  talent, might elsewhere almost have become masters. Fra Bartolommeo,  Andrea del Sarto, Pontormo, and Bronzino were perhaps no less gifted as  artists than Palma, Bonifazio Veronese, Lotto, and Tintoretto; but their  talents, instead of being permitted to flower naturally, were scorched  by the passion for showing off dexterity, blighted by academic ideals,  and uprooted by the whirlwind force of Michelangelo.    Fra Bartolommeo, who in temperament was delicate, refined, graceful, and  as a painter had a miniaturist's feeling for the dainty, was induced to  desert his lovely women, his exquisite landscape, and his gentleness of  expression for figures constructed mechanically on a colossal scale, or  for effects of the round at any cost. And as evil is more obvious than  good, Bartolommeo, the painter of that masterpiece of colour and light  and shade, of graceful movement and charming feeling, the \"Madonna with  the Baptist and St. Stephen\" in the Cathedral at Lucca, Bartolommeo, the  dainty deviser of Mr. Mond's tiny \"Nativity,\" Bartolommeo, the artificer  of a hundred masterpieces of pen drawing, is almost unknown; and to most  people Fra Bartolommeo is a sort of synonym for pomposity. He is known  only as the author of physically colossal, spiritually insignificant  prophets and apostles, or, perchance, as the painter of pitch-dark  altar-pieces: this being the reward of devices to obtain mere relief.    [Page heading: ANDREA DEL SARTO]    Andrea del Sarto approached perhaps as closely to a Giorgione or a  Titian as could a Florentine, ill at ease in the neighbourhood of  Leonardo and Michelangelo. As an artist he was, it is true, not endowed  with the profoundest sense for the significant, yet within the sphere of  common humanity who has produced anything more genial than his \"Portrait  of a Lady\"--probably his wife--with a Petrarch in her hands? Where out  of Venetia can we find portraits so simple, so frank, and yet so  interpretive as his \"Sculptor,\" or as his various portraits of  himself--these, by the way, an autobiography as complete as any in  existence, and tragic as few? Almost Venetian again is his \"St. James\"  caressing children, a work of the sweetest feeling. Even in colour  effect, and technique, how singularly close to the best Venetian  painting in his \"Dispute about the Trinity\"--what blacks and whites,  what greys and purplish browns! And in addition, tactile values peculiar  to Florence--what a back St. Sebastian's! But in a work of scarcely less  technical merit, the \"Madonna of the Harpies,\" we already feel the man  not striving to get the utmost out of himself, but panting for the grand  and magnificent. Even here, he remains almost a great artist, because  his natural robustness comes to his rescue; but the \"Madonna\" is too  obviously statuesque, and, good saints, pray why all these draperies?    The obviously statuesque and draperies were Andrea's devices for keeping  his head above water in the rising tide of the Michelangelesque. As you  glance in sequence at the Annunziata frescoes, on the whole so full of  vivacity, gaiety, and genuine delight in life, you see from one fresco  to another the increased attention given to draperies. In the Scalzo  series, otherwise masterpieces of tactile values, the draperies do their  utmost to smother the figures. Most of these paintings are closed in  with ponderous forms which have no other purpose than to serve as a  frame, and as clothes-horses for draperies: witness the scene of  Zacharias in the temple, wherein none of the bystanders dare move for  fear of disturbing their too obviously arranged folds.    Thus by constantly sacrificing first spiritual, and then material  significance to pose and draperies, Andrea loses all feeling for the  essential in art. What a sad spectacle is his \"Assumption,\" wherein the  Apostles, the Virgin herself, have nothing better to do than to show off  draperies! Instead of feeling, as in the presence of Titian's \"Assunta,\"  wrapt to heaven, you gaze at a number of tailor's men, each showing how  a stuff you are thinking of trying looks on the back, or in a certain  effect of light. But let us not end on this note; let us bear in mind  that, despite all his faults, Andrea painted the one \"Last Supper\" which  can be looked at with pleasure after Leonardo's.    [Page heading: PONTORMO]    Pontormo, who had it in him to be a decorator and portrait-painter of  the highest rank, was led astray by his awe-struck admiration for  Michelangelo, and ended as an academic constructor of monstrous nudes.  What he could do when expressing _himself_, we see in the lunette at  Poggio a Caiano, as design, as colour, as fancy, the freshest, gayest,  most appropriate mural decoration now remaining in Italy; what he could  do as a portrait-painter, we see in his wonderfully decorative panel of  Cosimo dei Medici at San Marco, or in his portrait of a \"Lady with a  Dog\" (at Frankfort), perhaps the first portrait ever painted in which  the sitter's social position was insisted upon as much as the personal  character. What Pontormo sank to, we see in such a riot of meaningless  nudes, all caricatures of Michelangelo, as his \"Martyrdom of Forty  Saints.\"    [Page heading: BRONZINO]    Bronzino, Pontormo's close follower, had none of his master's talent as  a decorator, but happily much of his power as a portrait-painter. Would  he had never attempted anything else! The nude without material or  spiritual significance, with no beauty of design or colour, the nude  simply because it was the nude, was Bronzino's ideal in composition, and  the result is his \"Christ in Limbo.\" But as a portrait-painter, he took  up the note struck by his master and continued it, leaving behind him a  series of portraits which not only had their effect in determining the  character of Court painting all over Europe, but, what is more to the  point, a series of portraits most of which are works of art. As  painting, it is true, they are hard, and often timid; but their air of  distinction, their interpretive qualities, have not often been  surpassed. In his Uffizi portraits of Eleanora di Toledo, of Prince  Ferdinand, of the Princess Maria, we seem to see the prototypes of  Velasquez' queens, princes, and princesses: and for a fine example of  dignified rendering of character, look in the Sala Baroccio of the  Uffizi at a bust of a young woman with a missal in her hand.      XIV.    [Page heading: MICHELANGELO]    The great Florentine artists, as we have seen, were, with scarcely an  exception, bent upon rendering the material significance of visible  things. This, little though they may have formulated it, was the  conscious aim of most of them; and in proportion as they emancipated  themselves from ecclesiastical dominion, and found among their employers  men capable of understanding them, their aim became more and more  conscious and their striving more energetic. At last appeared the man  who was the pupil of nobody, the heir of everybody, who felt profoundly  and powerfully what to his precursors had been vague instinct, who saw  and expressed the meaning of it all. The seed that produced him had  already flowered into a Giotto, and once again into a Masaccio; in him,  the last of his race, born in conditions artistically most propitious,  all the energies remaining in his stock were concentrated, and in him  Florentine art had its logical culmination.    [Page heading: ANTHROPOMORPHISM IN ART]    Michelangelo had a sense for the materially significant as great as  Giotto's or Masaccio's, but he possessed means of rendering, inherited  from Donatello, Pollaiuolo, Verrocchio and Leonardo,--means that had  been undreamt of by Giotto or even by Masaccio. Add to this that he saw  clearly what before him had been felt only dimly, that there was no  other such instrument for conveying material significance as the human  nude. This fact is as closely dependent on the general conditions of  realising objects as tactile values are on the psychology of sight. We  realise objects when we perfectly translate them into terms of our own  states, our own feelings. So obviously true is this, that even the least  poetically inclined among us, because we keenly realise the movement of  a railway train, to take one example out of millions, speak of it as  _going_ or _running_, instead of _rolling on its wheels_, thus being no  less guilty of anthropomorphising than the most unregenerate savages. Of  this same fallacy we are guilty every time we think of anything  whatsoever with the least warmth--we are lending this thing some human  attributes. The more we endow it with human "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17412"],[0,"The Bobbsey Twins (#10)"],[1,"closely and wondered what they had best do if the dog leaped straight  through and attacked them in the dark.    The barking continued for over quarter of an hour. To Nan and Bert it  seemed hours and hours. Then came a call from a distance.    \"Hi, Tige, what's the matter? Have you spotted a tramp in the shed?\"    \"Help! help!\" called out Bert. \"Call off your dog!\"    \"A tramp, sure enough,\" said the man who was coming toward the cow-shed.    \"I am not a tramp,\" answered Bert. \"And my sister isn't a tramp,  either.\"    \"What's that? You've got your sister with you? Open the door.\"    \"Please, we are afraid of the dog,\" came from Nan. \"He came after us and  we ran into the shed for shelter.\"    \"Oh, that's it?\" The farmer gave a short laugh. \"Well, you needn't be  skeert! Tige won't hurt ye none.\"    \"Are you sure of that?\" put in Bert. \"He seems to be very savage.\"    \"I won't let him touch ye.\"    Thus assured Nan opened the door and followed Bert outside. At a word  from the farmer Tige stopped barking and began to wag his tail.    \"That dog wouldn't hurt nobody, 'ceptin' he was attacked, or if a person  tried to git in my house,\" said Farmer Sandborn. \"He's a very nice  fellow, he is, and likes boys and gals fust-rate; don't ye, Tige?\" And  the dog wagged his tail harder than ever, as if he understood every  word.    \"I--I was so scared,\" said Nan.    \"May I ask what you be a-doin' on the road all alone and in this  snowstorm?\"    \"We are going home,\" answered Bert, and then explained how they had been  ice-boating and what had happened on the lake.    \"I do declare!\" cried Farmer Sandborn. \"So the boat up an' run away with  ye, did she? Contrary critter, eh!\" And he began to laugh. \"Who be you?\"    \"I am Bert Bobbsey and this is my twin sister Nan.\"    \"Oh, yes, I know now. You're one pair o' the Bobbsey twins, as they  call 'em over to Lakeport. I've heard Sary speak o' ye. Sary's my wife.\"  The farmer ran his hand through his thick beard. \"You can't tramp home  in this storm.\"    \"Oh, we must get home,\" said Nan. \"What will mamma say? She will think  we are killed, or drowned, or something,--and she isn't over the scare  she got when Freddie was lost.\"    \"I'll take you back to town in my sleigh,\" said Farmer Sandborn. \"I was  going to town for some groceries to-morrow morning, but I might just as  well go now, while the roads are open. They'll be all closed up ag'in by  daylight, if this storm keeps up.\"    He led the way down the road to his house and they were glad enough to  follow. By Nan's side walked Tige and he licked her hand, just to show  that he wanted to make friends with her.    \"I guess you are a good dog after all,\" said she, patting his head. \"But  you did give me _such_ a scare!\"    Both of the twins were very cold and glad enough to warm themselves by  the kitchen fire while the farmer hitched up his horse. The farmer's  wife wished to give them supper, but this they declined, saying they  would get supper at home. But she made each eat a big cookie, which  tasted exceedingly good.    Soon Farmer Sandborn drove around to the door with his sleigh and in  they piled, on the soft straw, with several robes to keep them warm.  Then the horse set off on a brisk trot for town.    \"It's a nice enough sleigh ride for anybody,\" declared Bert. And yet  they did not enjoy it very much, for fear of what would happen to them  when they got home.    \"Where in the world have you been?\" exclaimed Mrs. Bobbsey as she ran to  the door to let them in. \"We have been looking all over for you. Your  papa was afraid you had been drowned in the lake.\"    An evening dinner was in waiting for them, and sitting down to satisfy  their hunger, they told their story, to which all of the others listened  with much interest.    \"You can be thankful you weren't blown clear to the other end of the  lake,\" said Mr. Bobbsey. \"I think after this you had better leave  ice-boating alone.\"    \"I know I shall!\" declared Nan.    \"Oh, I'll be more careful, papa, after this,\" pleaded Bert. \"You know I  promised to go out again with Charley.\"    \"Well then, don't go when the wind is strong,\" and Bert promised.    \"I'm so glad the dog didn't bite you,\" said little Flossie. \"He might  have given you hy--hy_dro_pics.\"    \"Flossie means hydrophobics,\" put in Freddie. \"Ain't no hy_dro_pics, is  there, Bert?\"    \"Oh, Freddie, you mean hydrophobia!\" burst out Nan, with a laugh.    \"No, I mean hydrophobics,\" insisted the little fellow. \"That's what  Dinah calls them anyway.\"    After the adventure on the ice boat matters ran smoothly with the  Bobbsey twins for two weeks and more. There was a great deal of snow and  as a consequence Freddie and Flossie stayed home from school most of the  time. Nan and Bert also remained home two separate days, and during  those days all of the children had great fun in the attic, where there  was a large storeroom, filled with all sort of things.    \"Let us play theater,\" said Nan, who had been to several exhibitions  while at home and while visiting.    \"All right,\" said Bert, falling in with the plan at once. \"Let us play  Rip Van Winkle. I can be Rip and you can be the loving wife, and Flossie  and Freddie can be the children.\"    Across the storeroom a rope was placed and on this they hung a sliding  curtain, made out of a discarded blanket. Then at one side they arranged  chairs, and Nan and Flossie brought out their dolls to be the audience.    \"They won't clap their hands very much,\" said Bert. \"But then they won't  make any disturbance either.\"    The performance was a great success. It was their own version of Rip Van  Winkle, and Bert as old Rip did many funny things which caused Freddie  and Flossie to roar with laughter. Nan as the loving wife recited a  piece called \"Doughnuts and Daisies,\" pretending to be working around  the kitchen in the meantime. The climax was reached when Bert tried to  imitate a thunderstorm in the mountains and pulled over a big trunk full  of old clothes and some window screens standing in a corner. The show  broke up in a hurry, and when Mrs. Bobbsey appeared on the scene,  wanting to know what the noise meant, all the actors and the doll  audience were out of sight.    But later, when mamma went below again, Bert and Nan sneaked back, and  put both the trunk and the screens in their proper places.          CHAPTER XIII    NAN'S FIRST CAKE-BAKING      \"Let's!\" cried Nan.    \"Yes, let's!\" echoed Flossie.    \"I want to help too,\" put in Freddie, \"Want to make a cake all by my own  self.\"    \"Freddie can make a little cake while we make a big one,\" said Bert.    It was on an afternoon just a week before Christmas and Mrs. Bobbsey had  gone out to do some shopping. Dinah was also away, on a visit to some  relatives, so the children had the house all to themselves.    It was Bert who spoke about cake-making first. Queer that a boy should  think of it, wasn't it? But Bert was very fond of cake, and did quite  some grumbling when none was to be had.    \"It ought to be easy to make a nice big plain cake,\" said Bert. \"I've  seen Dinah do it lots of times. She just mixes up her milk and eggs and  butter, and sifts in the flour, and there you are.\"    \"Much you know about it!\" declared Nan. \"If it isn't just put together  right, it will be as heavy as lead.\"    \"We might take the recipe out of mamma's cook-book,\" went on Bert; and  then the cry went up with which I have opened this chapter.    The twins were soon in the kitchen, which Dinah had left spotlessly  clean and in perfect order.    \"We mustn't make a muss,\" warned Nan. \"If we do, Dinah will never  forgive us.\"    \"As if we couldn't clean it up again,\" said Bert loftily.    Over the kitchen table they spread some old newspapers, and then Nan  brought forth the big bowl in which her mother or the cook usually mixed  the cake batter.    \"Bert, you get the milk and sugar,\" said Nan, and began to roll up her  sleeves. \"Flossie, you can get the butter.\"    She would have told Freddie to get something, too--just to start them  all to work--but Freddie was out of sight.    He had gone into the pantry, where the flour barrel stood. He did not  know that Nan intended to use the prepared flour, which was on the  shelf. The door worked on a spring, so it closed behind him, shutting  him out from the sight of the others.    Taking off the cover of the barrel, Freddie looked inside. The barrel  was almost empty, only a few inches of flour remaining at the bottom.  There was a flour scoop in the barrel, but he could reach neither this  nor the flour itself.    \"I'll have to stand on the bench,\" he said to himself and pulled the  bench into position. Then he stood on it and bent down into the barrel  as far as possible.    The others were working in the kitchen when they heard a strange _thump_  and then a spluttering yell.    \"It's Freddie,\" said Nan. \"Bert, go and see what he is doing in the  pantry.\"    Bert ran to the pantry door and pulled it open. A strange sight met his  gaze. Out of the top of the barrel stuck Freddie's legs, with a cloud  of flour dust rising around them. From the bottom of the barrel came a  succession of coughs, sneezes, and yells for help.    \"Freddie has fallen into the flour barrel!\" he cried, and lost no time  in catching his brother by the feet and pulling him out. It was hard  work and in the midst of it the flour barrel fell over on its side,  scattering the flour over the pantry and partly on the kitchen floor.    \"Oh! oh! oh!\" roared Freddie as soon as he could catch his breath. \"Oh,  my! oh, my!\"    \"Oh, Freddie, why did you go into the barrel?\" exclaimed Nan, wiping off  her hands and running to him. \"Did you ever see such a sight before?\"    Freddie was digging at the flour in his eyes. He was white from head to  feet, and coughing and spluttering.    \"Wait, I'll get the whisk-broom,\" said Bert, and ran for it.    \"Brush off his hair first, and then I'll wipe his face,\" came from"]]]
