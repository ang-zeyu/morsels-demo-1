Inopinantes nostri re nova  perturbantur, ac vix primum impetum cohors in statione sustinet.  Circumfunduntur ex reliquis hostes partibus, si quem aditum reperire  possent. Aegre portas nostri tuentur, reliquos aditus locus ipse per se  munitioque defendit. Totis trepidatur castris, atque alius ex alio  causam tumultus quaerit; neque quo signa ferantur neque quam in partem  quisque conveniat provident. Alius iam castra capta pronuntiat, alius  deleto exercitu atque imperatore victores barbaros venisse contendit;  plerique novas sibi ex loco religiones fingunt Cottaeque et Tituri  calamitatem, qui in eodem occiderint castello, ante oculos ponunt. Tali  timore omnibus perterritis confirmatur opinio barbaris, ut ex captivo  audierant, nullum esse intus praesidium. Perrumpere nituntur seque ipsi  adhortantur, ne tantam fortunam ex manibus dimittant.      38    Erat aeger cum praesidio relictus Publius Sextius Baculus, qui primum  pilum ad Caesarem duxerat, cuius mentionem superioribus proeliis  fecimus, ac diem iam quintum cibo caruerat. Hic diffisus suae atque  omnium saluti inermis ex tabernaculo prodit: videt imminere hostes atque  in summo esse rem discrimine: capit arma a proximis atque in porta  consistit. Consequuntur hunc centuriones eius cohortis quae in statione  erat: paulisper una proelium sustinent. Relinquit animus Sextium  gravibus acceptis vulneribus: aegre per manus tractus servatur. Hoc  spatio interposito reliqui sese confirmant tantum, ut in munitionibus  consistere audeant speciemque defensorum praebeant.      39    Interim confecta frumentatione milites nostri clamorem exaudiunt:  praecurrunt equites; quanto res sit in periculo cognoscunt. Hic vero  nulla munitio est quae perterritos recipiat: modo conscripti atque usus  militaris imperiti ad tribunum militum centurionesque ora convertunt;  quid ab his praecipiatur exspectant. Nemo est tam fortis quin rei  novitate perturbetur. Barbari signa procul conspicati oppugnatione  desistunt: redisse primo legiones credunt, quas longius discessisse ex  captivis cognoverant; postea despecta paucitate ex omnibus partibus  impetum faciunt.      40    Calones in proximum tumulum procurrunt. Hinc celeriter deiecti se in  signa manipulosque coniciunt: eo magis timidos perterrent milites. Alii  cuneo facto ut celeriter perrumpant censent, quoniam tam propinqua sint  castra, et si pars aliqua circumventa ceciderit, at reliquos servari  posse confidunt; alii, ut in iugo consistant atque eundem omnes ferant  casum. Hoc veteres non probant milites, quos sub vexillo una profectos  docuimus. Itaque inter se cohortati duce Gaio Trebonio, equite Romano,  qui eis erat praepositus, per medios hostes perrumpunt incolumesque ad  unum omnes in castra perveniunt. Hos subsecuti calones equitesque eodem  impetu militum virtute servantur. At ei qui in iugo constiterant, nullo  etiam nunc usu rei militaris percepto neque in eo quod probaverant  consilio permanere, ut se loco superiore defenderent, neque eam quam  prodesse aliis vim celeritatemque viderant imitari potuerunt, sed se in  castra recipere conati iniquum in locum demiserunt. Centuriones, quorum  nonnulli ex inferioribus ordinibus reliquarum legionum virtutis causa in  superiores erant ordines huius legionis traducti, ne ante partam rei  militaris laudem amitterent, fortissime pugnantes conciderunt. Militum  pars horum virtute summotis hostibus praeter spem incolumis in castra  pervenit, pars a barbaris circumventa periit.      41    Germani desperata expugnatione castrorum, quod nostros iam constitisse  in munitionibus videbant, cum ea praeda quam in silvis deposuerant trans  Rhenum sese receperunt. Ac tantus fuit etiam post discessum hostium  terror ut ea nocte, cum Gaius Volusenus missus cum equitatu ad castra  venisset, fidem non faceret adesse cum incolumi Caesarem exercitu. Sic  omnino animos timor praeoccupaverat ut paene alienata mente deletis  omnibus copiis equitatum se ex fuga recepisse dicerent neque in columi  exercitu Germanos castra oppugnaturos fuisse contenderent. Quem timorem  Caesaris adventus sustulit.      42    Reversus ille eventus belli non ignorans unum, quod cohortes ex statione  et praesidio essent emissae, questus ne minimo quidem casu locum  relinqui debuisse, multum fortunam in repentino hostium adventu potuisse  iudicavit, multo etiam amplius, quod paene ab ipso vallo portisque  castrorum barbaros avertisset. Quarum omnium rerum maxime admirandum  videbatur, quod Germani, qui eo consilio Rhenum transierant, ut  Ambiorigis fines depopularentur, ad castra Romanorum delati optatissimum  Ambiorigi beneficium obtulerunt.      43    Caesar rursus ad vexandos hostes profectus magno coacto numero ex  finitimis civitatibus in omnes partes dimittit. Omnes vici atque omnia  aedificia quae quisque conspexerat incendebantur; praeda ex omnibus  locis agebatur; frumenta non solum tanta multitudine iumentorum atque  hominum consumebantur, sed etiam anni tempore atque imbribus  procubuerant ut, si qui etiam in praesentia se occultassent, tamen his  deducto exercitu rerum omnium inopia pereundum videretur. Ac saepe in  eum locum ventum est tanto in omnes partes diviso equitatu, ut modo  visum ab se Ambiorigem in fuga circumspicerent captivi nec plane etiam  abisse ex conspectu contenderent, ut spe consequendi illata atque  infinito labore suscepto, qui se summam ab Caesare gratiam inituros  putarent, paene naturam studio vincerent, semperque paulum ad summam  felicitatem defuisse videretur, atque ille latebris aut saltibus se  eriperet et noctu occultatus alias regiones partesque peteret non maiore  equitum praesidio quam quattuor, quibus solis vitam suam committere  audebat.      44    Tali modo vastatis regionibus exercitum Caesar duarum cohortium damno  Durocortorum Remorum reducit concilioque in eum locum Galliae indicto de  coniuratione Senonum et Carnutum quaestionem habere instituit et de  Accone, qui princeps eius consili fuerat, graviore sententia pronuntiata  more maiorum supplicium sumpsit. Nonnulli iudicium veriti profugerunt.  Quibus cum aqua atque igni interdixisset, duas legiones ad fines  Treverorum, duas in Lingonibus, sex reliquas in Senonum finibus Agedinci  in hibernis collocavit frumentoque exercitui proviso, ut iustituerat, in  Italiam ad conventus agendos profectus est.      Liber VII    Gaius Iulius Caesar    post 52    1    Quieta Gallia Caesar, ut constituerat, in Italiam ad conventus agendos  proficiscitur. Ibi cognoscit de Clodii caede [de] senatusque consulto  certior factus, ut omnes iuniores Italiae coniurarent, delectum tota  provincia habere instituit. Eae res in Galliam Transalpinam celeriter  perferuntur. Addunt ipsi et ad fingunt rumoribus Galli, quod res poscere  videbatur, retineri urbano motu Caesarem neque in tantis dissensionibus  ad exercitum venire posse. Hac impulsi occasione, qui iam ante se populi  Romani imperio subiectos dolerent liberius atque audacius de bello  consilia inire incipiunt. Indictis inter se principes Galliae conciliis  silvestribus ac remotis locis queruntur de Acconis morte; posse hunc  casum ad ipsos recidere demonstrant: miserantur communem Galliae  fortunam: omnibus pollicitationibus ac praemius deposcunt qui belli  initium faciant et sui capitis periculo Galliam in libertatem vindicent.  In primis rationem esse habendam dicunt, priusquam eorum clandestina  consilia efferantur, ut Caesar ab exercitu intercludatur. Id esse  facile, quod neque legiones audeant absente imperatore ex hibernis  egredi, neque imperator sine praesidio ad legiones pervenire possit.  Postremo in acie praestare interfici quam non veterem belli gloriam  libertatemque quam a maioribus acce perint recuperare.      2    His rebus agitatis profitentur Carnutes se nullum periculum communis  salutis causa recusare principesque ex omnibus bellum facturos  pollicentur et, quoniam in praesentia obsidibus cavere inter se non  possint ne res efferatur, ut iureiurando ac fide sanciatur, petunt,  collatis militaribus signis, quo more eorum gravissima caerimonia  continetur, ne facto initio belli ab reliquis deserantur. Tum  collaudatis Carnutibus, dato iureiurando ab omnibus qui aderant, tempore  eius rei constituto ab concilio disceditur.      3    Vbi ea dies venit, Carnutes Cotuato et Conconnetodumno ducibus,  desperatis hominibus, Cenabum signo dato concurrunt civesque Romanos,  qui negotiandi causa ibi constiterant, in his Gaium Fufium Citam,  honestum equitem Romanum, qui rei frumentariae iussu Caesaris praeerat,  interficiunt bonaque eorum diripiunt. Celeriter ad omnes Galliae  civitates fama perfertur. Nam ubicumque maior atque illustrior incidit  res, clamore per agros regionesque significant; hunc alii deinceps  excipiunt et proximis tradunt, ut tum accidit. Nam quae Cenabi oriente  sole gesta essent, ante primam confectam vigiliam in finibus Arvernorum  audita sunt, quod spatium est milium passuum circiter centum LX.      4    Simili ratione ibi Vercingetorix, Celtilli filius, Arveruus, summae  potentiae adulescens, cuius pater principatum Galliae totius obtinuerat  et ob eam causam, quod regnum appetebat, ab civitate erat interfectus,  convocatis suis clientibus facile incendit. Cognito eius consilio ad  arma concurritur. Prohibetur ab Gobannitione, patruo suo, reliquisque  principibus, qui hanc temptandam fortunam non existimabant; expellitur  ex oppido Gergovia; non destitit tamen atque in agris habet dilectum  egentium ac perditorum. Hac coacta manu, quoscumque adit ex civitate ad  suam sententiam perducit; hortatur ut communis libertatis causa arma  capiant, magnisque coactis copiis adversarios suos a quibus paulo ante  erat eiectus expellit ex civitate. Rex ab suis appellatur. Dimittit  quoque versus legationes; obtestatur ut in fide maneant.

Later on the child may think, from cause to effect, thus: \"Sweet, good,  want, taste, spank, hurt (or no dinner, all by self, lonely), spank hurt  more than sweets good. Not taste.\" But long before he can work this out,  consciously, two distinct memories, one of pleasure and one of pain, are  aroused by the sight of the sweet. And what he will do with it depends  upon which memory is stronger. In other words, his action is governed  altogether by his feeling, though memory, which is an intellectual  factor, supplies the material for feeling.      DEVELOPMENT OF REASON AND WILL    Later still, when the child is older, we may have somewhat the following  mechanism: \"Sweets, good, want, taste; spank, hurt; don't care, spank  not hurt much, maybe never found put, sweets very good.\"    Now the child is reasoning and choosing between two courses of action,  _don't_ and _do_. His decision will depend upon whether immediate  satisfaction of desire is stronger than the deferred satisfaction of  being good, and the fear of punishment. He probably prefers to take a  chance, and even if the worst comes, weighs it with the other worst, not  having the sweet--and takes the \"bird in the hand.\" He has reasoned, and  has chosen between two emotions the one which his judgment says is the  more desirable; and his will carries out the decision of his reasoning.  His chief end in life is still to get the most immediate pleasure. Still  later in child-life, much later, perhaps, his decision about the jam is  based on neither love of it nor fear of punishment, but--despite his  still sweet tooth--on a reasoned conclusion that if he eats jam now he  may be sick, or he may spoil his appetite for dinner; or on a  consideration that sweets between meals are not best on dietetic  principles; and _will_ very readily backs up the result of his  reasoning. Though his determination is largely based upon feeling,  reason has chosen between feelings, between immediate desire to have,  and desire to avoid future discomfort. Reason is triumphant over present  desire.      JUDGMENT    The conclusion or decision that reason has reached we call a judgment.  The youth who decides against the sweet between meals, we say, has good  judgment. And we base our commendation on the proved fact that sweets  are real fuel, giving abundantly of heat and energy, and are not to be  eaten as mere pastime when the body is already fully supplied with  high calorie food not yet burned up; that if sweets are eaten at  irregular intervals and at the call of appetite, and not earned by an  adequate output of physical work, the digestive apparatus may become  clogged, and an overacid condition of the entire intestinal tract  threaten. We call judgment good, then, when it is the result of  reasoning with correct or logical premises which correspond with the  facts of life. We call it bad when it is the conclusion of incorrect or  partial or illogic premises.    A _premise_ \"is a proposition laid down, proved, supposed, or assumed,  that serves as a ground for argument or for a conclusion; a judgment  leading to another judgment as a conclusion\" (Standard Dictionary).    Let us illustrate good and bad judgment by following out two lines of  reasoning, each quite accurate as such.    I want sweets. Sweets are good for people. They give heat and energy,  and I need that, for I am chilly and tired. People say \"Don't eat sweets  between meals.\" But why? They contain just what I need and the sooner I  get them the better.    So I have sweets when I want them. The judgment to take the sweets as  desire indicates is entirely logical if we accept all the premises as  correct. And they are, so far as they go; but they are partial; and so  cannot altogether correspond with the facts of life. Sweets are good for  people who expend much physical energy. They prove injurious in more  than limited amounts to the bed-ridden, the inactive, or the sluggish.  Hence this premise is partial and so far incorrect. Sweets do give heat  and energy, true. I am chilly and tired, also true. But why? Because I  am already toxic from the sweets and meats I have had throughout my  sedentary years. The question is, Do I need any more energy-producing  food when I am not burning up what I have? So again the premise is  partial. I do need heat and energy, but I already have the material for  it, and my mode of life has disorganized my system's capacity to utilize  these foods normally. So now sweets have become a detriment to my  well-being. The judgment which determines me to the habit of eating  sweets between meals is the result of logic, but of logic spent on tying  up premises which do not fit the facts of the case.    One of the most prevalent defects of judgment is illustrated in this  common disability to select premises which fit the facts. Ignorance,  emotional reasoning, and a defective critical sense probably explain  most poor judgments.    The other judgment illustrates the logic of correct, provable premises.    \"No, I shall wait until dinner-time. I have no need of so rich a food,  for I had an adequate meal at the usual time and have not worked hard  enough to justify adding this burden to my digestive apparatus; besides  only hard workers with their muscles can afford to eat many sweets. They  cause an overacid condition when taken in excess; and any except at  mealtimes would be excess for me, with my moderate physical exercise.\"    This judgment we call good. Its premises correspond to scientific facts.    But much reasoning must always be done with probable premises, ones  which seem to correspond to the facts, but which have yet to be proved.  And our judgment from such suppositions cannot be final until we see if  it works.    Some few centuries ago supposedly wise men called Christopher Columbus a  fool. Of course the world was flat. If it were round man would fall off.  It was all spread out and the oceans were its limits. If it should be  round, like a ball, as that mad man claimed, then the waters must reach  from Europe 'round the sphere and touch Asia; or there might be land  out there beyond the ocean's curve. But it wasn't round, and the idea of  finding a new way to Asia by sailing in the opposite direction was a  fool's delusion.    Their logic was perfect. If the earth was flat, and Asia lay east of  Europe, it was madness to sail west to reach it. But they argued from a  wrong premise, so their judgment was imperfect--for they did not yet  know the facts.    The result of all reasoning is judgment. And judgment is good as the  materials of the reasoning process correspond to facts, or are in line  with the most probable of the yet unknown. It is poor as the reasoning  material fails to meet the facts, or is out of harmony with the most  probable of the yet unproved.    It is of no avail, then, to attempt to improve our final judgments as  such. We must examine the materials we reason with, then learn to group  and compare them logically. And in the very separating of true premises  from false, we use and train the judgment we would improve. And this the  normal mind can do.      REACTION PROPORTIONED TO STIMULI    In the normal mind the emotional or feeling accompaniment of thought and  action is proportionate and adequate to the circumstances, _i. e._,  there is a certain feeling, of a certain strength, natural to every  thought and act; and when only that strength, not more or less,  accompanies the thought or the act, we say, \"That man is emotionally  stable. His mind is normally balanced.\"    Joy naturally follows some stimuli; sorrow others. Disappointment or  loss, shock, failure, death of loved ones, illness in ourselves or  others, do not normally bring joy. A keen sense of suffering,  temporarily, perhaps, of numbness; the inability to grasp the calamity;  or flowing tears, an aching heart, or the stress of willed endurance,  are natural, and normal reactions to such stimuli.    A developed will may refuse indulgence in the outward expression of the  normal feeling of shock, grief, and loss; and this may be normal. But  normal volition does not force us to laugh and dance and be wildly merry  in the face of grief and loss and pain. It only suggests the adequate,  reasonable acceptance of the facts that cannot be changed--the  acceptance of love, faith, and hope that sees in present suffering a  means of consecration to service; it does not convert the emotion of  sorrow and loss into a pleasurable one. Normal reason does not suggest  that _will_ force the reactions to loss and suffering that belong by  nature to attainment and success.    Nor does reason suggest the long face, the bitter tears, a storm of  anger, in response to comedy and farce, in the face of a good joke, or  to meet success; and normal will puts reason's counsel into effect.      NORMAL EMOTIONAL REACTIONS    Some emotions, that seem exaggerated at first thought, may be normal  under the circumstances. For no one can know the whole background for  emotional response in the life of another. After being long shut up in a  darkened room, with bandaged eyes and aching head and sick body, the  first visit to the bit of woods back of the house--when all the pains  have gone--may bring almost delirious joy. The green of the foliage, the  blue of the sky, the arousing tang of the air, the birds, the sense of  freedom--all go to the head like new wine. The abandon of joy is a  normal response under the circumstances, now. It would hardly be normal  to one whose habit it is to visit this same bit of woods every day, to  one who loved it, but for whom it had lost the force of newness.
