How happens this, my  child?\"    This was the first time she had ever called her \"my child.\"    The girl told her frankly all the matter, not without dropping out great  numbers of diamonds.    \"Truly,\" cried the mother, \"I must send my own dear child thither.  Fanny, look at what comes out of your sister's mouth when she speaks.  Would you not be glad, my dear, to have the same gift? You have only to  go and draw water out of the fountain, and when a poor woman asks you  to let her drink, to give it to her very civilly.\"    [Illustration: \"WITH ALL MY HEART, GOODY.\" p. 75.]    \"I should like to see myself going to the fountain to draw water,\" said  this ill-bred minx.    \"I insist you shall go,\" said the mother, \"and that instantly.\"    She went, but grumbled all the way, taking with her the best silver  tankard in the house.    She no sooner reached the fountain than she saw coming out of the wood,  a magnificently dressed lady, who came up to her, and asked to drink.  This was the same fairy who had appeared to her sister, but she had now  taken the air and dress of a princess, to see how far this girl's  rudeness would go.    \"Am I come hither,\" said the proud, ill-bred girl, \"to serve you with  water, pray? I suppose this silver tankard was brought purely for your  ladyship, was it? However, you may drink out of it, if you have a  fancy.\"    \"You are scarcely polite,\" answered the fairy, without anger. \"Well,  then, since you are so disobliging, I give you for gift that at every  word you speak there shall come out of your mouth a snake or a toad.\"    So soon as her mother saw her coming, she cried out:--    \"Well, daughter?\"    \"Well, mother?\" answered the unhappy girl, throwing out of her mouth a  viper and a toad.    \"Oh, mercy!\" cried the mother, \"what is it I see? It is her sister who  has caused all this, but she shall pay for it,\" and immediately she ran  to beat her. The poor child fled away from her, and went to hide herself  in the forest nearby.    The King's son, who was returning from the chase, met her, and seeing  her so beautiful, asked her what she did there alone and why she cried.    \"Alas! sir, my mother has turned me out of doors.\"    The King's son, who saw five or six pearls and as many diamonds come out  of her mouth, desired her to tell him how that happened. She told him  the whole story. The King's son fell in love with her, and, considering  that such a gift was worth more than any marriage portion another bride  could bring, conducted her to the palace of the King, his father, and  there married her.    As for her sister, she made herself so much hated that her own mother  turned her out of doors. The miserable girl, after wandering about and  finding no one to take her in, went to a corner of the wood, and there  died.          LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.      Once upon a time there lived in a certain village a little country girl,  the prettiest creature that ever was seen. Her mother was very fond of  her, and her grandmother loved her still more. This good woman made for  her a little red riding-hood, which became the girl so well that  everybody called her Little Red Riding-hood.    One day her mother, having made some custards, said to her:--    \"Go, my dear, and see how your grandmother does, for I hear she has been  very ill; carry her a custard and this little pot of butter.\"    Little Red Riding-hood set out immediately to go to her grandmother's,  who lived in another village.    As she was going through the wood, she met Gaffer Wolf, who had a very  great mind to eat her up; but he dared not, because of some fagot-makers  hard by in the forest. He asked her whither she was going. The poor  child, who did not know that it was dangerous to stay and hear a wolf  talk, said to him:--    \"I am going to see my grandmother, and carry her a custard and a little  pot of butter from my mamma.\"    \"Does she live far off?\" said the Wolf.    \"Oh, yes,\" answered Little Red Riding-hood; \"it is beyond that mill you  see there, the first house you come to in the village.\"    \"Well,\" said the Wolf, \"and I'll go and see her, too. I'll go this way,  and you go that, and we shall see who will be there first.\"    The Wolf began to run as fast as he could, taking the shortest way, and  the little girl went by the longest way, amusing herself by gathering  nuts, running after butterflies, and making nosegays of such little  flowers as she met with. The Wolf was not long before he reached the old  woman's house. He knocked at the door--tap, tap, tap.    \"Who's there?\" called the grandmother.    \"Your grandchild, Little Red Riding-hood,\" replied the Wolf, imitating  her voice, \"who has brought a custard and a little pot of butter sent to  you by mamma.\"    The good grandmother, who was in bed, because she was somewhat ill,  cried out:--    \"Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.\"    The Wolf pulled the bobbin, and the door opened. He fell upon the good  woman and ate her up in no time, for he had not eaten anything for more  than three days. He then shut the door, went into the grandmother's  bed, and waited for Little Red Riding-hood, who came sometime afterward  and knocked at the door--tap, tap, tap.    \"Who's there?\" called the Wolf.    Little Red Riding-hood, hearing the big voice of the Wolf, was at first  afraid; but thinking her grandmother had a cold, answered:--    \"'Tis your grandchild, Little Red Riding-hood, who has brought you a  custard and a little pot of butter sent to you by mamma.\"    The Wolf cried out to her, softening his voice a little:--    \"Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.\"    Little Red Riding-hood pulled the bobbin, and the door opened.    The Wolf, seeing her come in, said to her, hiding himself under the  bedclothes:--    \"Put the custard and the little pot of butter upon the stool, and come  and lie down with me.\"    Little Red Riding-hood undressed herself and went into bed, where she  was much surprised to see how her grandmother looked in her  night-clothes.    She said to her:--    \"Grandmamma, what great arms you have got!\"    \"That is the better to hug thee, my dear.\"    \"Grandmamma, what great legs you have got!\"    [Illustration: \"HE FELL UPON THE GOOD WOMAN.\" p. 81.]      \"That is to run the better, my child.\"    \"Grandmamma, what great ears you have got!\"    \"That is to hear the better, my child.\"    \"Grandmamma, what great eyes you have got!\"    \"It is to see the better, my child.\"    \"Grandmamma, what great teeth you have got!\"    \"That is to eat thee up.\"    And, saying these words, this wicked Wolf fell upon Little Red  Riding-hood, and ate her all up.          NOTE.      The eight stories contained in this volume are first found in print in  French in a magazine entitled, _Receuil de pieces curieuses et nouvelles  tant en prose qu'en vers_, which was published by Adrian Moetjens at The  Hague in 1696-1697. They were immediately afterward published at Paris  in a volume entitled, _Histoires ou Contes du Temps Passe, avec des  Moralites--Contes de ma mere l'Oie_.    The earliest translation into English has been found in a little book  containing both the English and French, entitled, \"Tales of Passed  Times, by Mother Goose. With Morals. Written in French by M. (Charles)  Perrault, and Englished by R.S. Gent.\"    Who R.S. was and when he made his translation we can only conjecture.  Mr. Andrew Lang, in his \"Perrault's Popular Tales\" (p. xxxiv), writes:  \"An English version translated by Mr. Samber, printed for J. Pote, was  advertised, Mr. Austin Dobson tells me, in the _Monthly Chronicle_,  March, 1729.\"    These stories which may be said to be as old as the race  itself--certainly their germs are to be found in the oldest literature  and among the oldest folk-tales in the world--were orally current in  France and the neighboring countries in nearly the form in which  Perrault wrote them for very many years; and an interesting account of  the various forms in which they are found in the literature and  folklore of other nations before Perrault's time is given in _Les Contes  de ma mere l'Oie avant Perrault_, by Charles Deulin, Paris, E. Dentu,  1878.    In this book Mr. Deulin inclines to the view that the stories as first  published by Perrault were not really written by him, but by his little  son of ten or eleven, to whom Perrault told the stories as he had  gathered them up with the intention of rendering them in verse after the  manner of La Fontaine. The lad had an excellent memory, much natural  wit, and a great gift of expression. He loved the stories his father  told him and thoroughly enjoyed the task his father set him of rewriting  them from memory, as an exercise. This was so happily done, in such a  fresh, artless, and engaging style, exactly befitting the subjects of  the stories, that the father found the son's version better than the one  he had contemplated and gave that to the world instead.    These stories made their way slowly in England at first, but in the end  they nearly eclipsed the native fairy tales and legends, which, owing to  Puritan influence, had been frowned upon and discouraged until they were  remembered only in the remoter districts, and told only by the few who  had not come under its sway. Indeed, the Puritanical objection to  nursery lore of all kinds still lingers in some corners of England.    The stories of Perrault came in just when the severer manifestations of  Puritanism were beginning to decline, and they have since become as much  a part of English fairy lore as the old English folk and fairy tales  themselves. These latter, thanks to Mr. Joseph Jacob, Mr. Andrew Lang,  Mr. E.S. Hartland, and others, have been unearthed and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17211"],[0,"A School History of the Great War (#10)"],[1,"a crushing blow with all the weight of  her powerful army and navy and establish herself as the mistress of the  world. On this she was willing to stake her very existence. To use a  phrase made famous by one of her leading military writers, Germany had  decided upon \"world power or downfall.\"    German militarists all looked forward to the day when her years of  preparation would at last reap their reward through the crushing of  Germany's rivals. England particularly, with her vast trade, her  colonial empire, and her control of the sea, they planned to lower to a  subordinate position in the world. \"_Der Tag_\" (d[)e]r tahkh), \"the day\"  when the long-awaited war should burst upon the world, was a favorite  toast in the German army and navy. As long ago as the end of the  Spanish-American War, a German diplomat said to an American army  officer: \"About fifteen years from now my country will start her great  war. She will be in Paris in about two months after the commencement of  hostilities. Her move on Paris will be but a step to her real  object--the crushing of England. Everything will move like clockwork. We  will be prepared and others will not be prepared.\"    FINAL PREPARATIONS.--In 1913 the German government decided upon a  large increase in her already tremendous standing army. Immense sums  were also appropriated for aircraft and for huge guns powerful enough to  batter to pieces the strongest fortresses. To pay for this extra  equipment additional heavy taxes were voted. The new arrangements were  all to be completed by the fall of 1914. Alterations were also hurried  on the Kiel Canal. This waterway, connecting the Baltic with the North  Sea, had been opened in 1895 and was of great naval importance. The new  German battleships, however, were so large that the canal was not large  enough to admit them. The work of widening and deepening the passage was  undertaken by the government, and was finally completed on July 1, 1914.  Preparations for the Great War were complete at last, both on land and  sea. The gunpowder was ready. All that was needed was a spark to bring  about the explosion.    THE AUSTRO-SERBIAN QUESTION.--For years before the war the Serbs and  other Jugo-Slavs in the southern provinces of Austria-Hungary had been  dissatisfied with Austrian rule. The Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina  (h[)e]r-ts[)e]-go-vee'nah) were especially aroused when those provinces, after  a long temporary government by Austria-Hungary, were formally annexed by  that power in 1908. Their wish was for union with the adjoining Serbian  kingdom. Their aspirations did not cause very much trouble while Serbia  was small and weak; but when, as a result of the Balkan wars, Serbia was  revealed to the world as a warlike nation with extended boundaries and  growing national ambitions, the Austrian Serbs grew restless. There is  little doubt that Serbs of Serbia had much to do with the anti-Austrian  activities that rapidly spread among their brothers within the Austrian  Empire. The Austrian government, much disturbed by a movement that  threatened to spread among her other subject populations, began to seek  a pretext for crushing her southern neighbor and so settling the  troublesome Serbian question once for all.    In 1913, at the close of the second Balkan war, Austria-Hungary informed  her allies, Italy and Germany, of her intention to make war upon Serbia,  and asked for the support of those countries. Italy refused to have any  part in the matter. Germany, realizing that Russia would probably come  to the assistance of Serbia and that a general European war might  follow, no doubt prevailed upon Austria to stay her hand. Germany's  preparations at that time were not quite complete.    THE ASSASSINATION OF FRANCIS FERDINAND.--In the early summer of 1914  occurred the event that was destined to plunge the world into war.  Archduke Francis Ferdinand, heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary, made  a visit to the southern provinces of the monarchy. On June 28, while he  and his wife were driving through the streets of Serajevo (s[)e]r'a-y[=a]-vo),  in Bosnia, three pistol shots were fired into the carriage, mortally  wounding the archduke and his wife. The assassin was an Austrian Serb, a  member of a Serbian secret society which had for its aim the separation  of the Serb provinces from Austria-Hungary and their annexation to the  kingdom of Serbia. The crime caused great excitement and horror  throughout Europe. But the deed had given Austria the opportunity to  settle its account with Serbia and thus put an end to the Serb plottings  within the Austrian borders.    THE DECISION FOR WAR.--There is evidence that on July 5, one week  after the murder at Serajevo, a secret meeting of German and Austrian  statesmen and generals took place in the German emperor's palace at  Potsdam, a suburb of Berlin. Probably at this conference it was  definitely decided that the assassination of the Austrian crown prince  should be used as a pretext for crushing Serbia. Austria, it was  expected, would thus permanently settle her Serbian problem. Germany  must have known that this action would probably lead to a general  European war, since Russia would come to the rescue of Serbia and France  would stand by Russia. But Germany was ready at last, and so the  terrible decision was made.    THE AUSTRIAN ULTIMATUM.--On July 23, the Austro-Hungarian government  sent a note to the government of Serbia holding her accountable for the  Serajevo murder and making a number of humiliating demands. Serbia was  told she must suppress all newspapers inciting enmity to Austria, that  she must dissolve all societies that were working toward \"Pan-Serbism,\"  that she must dismiss from the Serbian public service all officials whom  the Austrian government should officially accuse of plotting against  Austria, that she must accept the help of Austrian officials in Serbia  in the putting down of anti-Austrian activities and in searching out  accessories to the plot of June 28, that she must arrest two Serbian  officials who had been implicated by the trial in Serajevo, and that she  must put a stop to the smuggling of arms from Serbia into Austria.    The demand that Serbia admit Austrian officials into Serbia to take part  in the work of investigation and suppression was an intolerable invasion  of Serbia's sovereignty within her own borders. But the most threatening  part of the note was its conclusion: \"The Austro-Hungarian government  expects the reply of the royal [Serbian] government at the latest by 6  o'clock on Saturday evening, the 25th of July.\" In other words, the note  was an ultimatum giving Serbia a period of only forty-eight hours in  which to agree to the Austrian demands.    SERBIA'S REPLY.--Serbia's answer to the Austrian ultimatum was  delivered within a few minutes of the time set. She agreed, practically,  to all the Austrian demands except those which required that Austrian  officials should conduct investigations and suppress conspiracies in  Serbia, and she even went part way toward accepting those. Serbia went  on to suggest that if Austria was not entirely satisfied with the reply,  the points still in dispute should be referred to the international  tribunal at The Hague. This reply the Austrian government considered  unsatisfactory. Forty-five minutes after the Serbian note had been  placed in the hands of the Austrian minister to Serbia that official  handed a notice to the Serbian government stating \"that not having  received a satisfactory answer within the time limit set, he was leaving  Belgrade\" (the Serbian capital). Austria-Hungary made immediate  preparations for the invasion of Serbia and on July 28 declared war.    EFFORTS FOR PEACE.--Meanwhile Great Britain, France, and Italy were  putting forth every effort to preserve the peace of Europe. In these  efforts the lead was taken by Sir Edward Grey, the British foreign  minister. As early as July 26 he urged a conference at London of the  representatives of France, Germany, Italy, and Great Britain to find  some solution of the problem which might be satisfactory to both Austria  and Russia. Italy and France agreed at once, but Germany raised  objections. Germany's only suggestion for preserving the general peace  of Europe was that Austria should be permitted to deal with Serbia as  she pleased, without interference from any other power. And so it  continued through those critical days. Every effort made by England  looking toward a peaceful settlement of the quarrel was baffled by  Germany's refusal to cooeperate. This is not difficult to understand in  the light of our later knowledge of the plans and aims of the German  government.    THE DECLARATIONS OF WAR.--Austria's declaration of war on Serbia (July  28) was followed by the general mobilization of Austria's troops.  Austria maintained that all her armies were for the war on Serbia, but  her preparations were so extensive that it was clear she was getting  ready to fight Russia also. In reply Russia began to mobilize her  troops, partly to prevent the destruction of Serbia, but also to defend  herself from possible Austrian attacks. Russia definitely notified  Germany that her mobilization was directed against Austria only.  Meanwhile England continued her efforts to bring about a conference of  the powers, a plan which Germany continued to foil. The Czar in a formal  telegram to the Kaiser on July 29 suggested that the Austro-Serbian  problem be given over to the Hague Tribunal, a suggestion which would  have led to peace. Nothing came of this proposal.    On July 31 the German government, on the ground that Russia's  mobilization was a threat of war, sent ultimatums to both Russia and  France. The ultimatum to Russia gave that government twelve hours in  which to stop all war preparations against both Germany and Austria. The  ultimatum to France informed that government of the message just sent to"]]]
