Doubtless he  had learnt something from the difficulties his predecessor encountered,  and knew how to avoid them. At any rate, he pushed forward the work with  great vigour and boldness. He formed his pillars of horizontal sections  of Purbeck marble from nine to fifteen inches thick: five boutelles on  each side presenting \"the appearance of twenty-five shafts bound in  one.\" In the pavement of the choir more than ten thousand tiles were  used. For the vaulting of the choir, also his work, though the honour  due to him has till lately been denied, he procured quantities of  Portland stone. Material for bases and capitals was imported also from  Portland: the entry in the Fabric Rolls runs: \"For the purchase of 18  great blocks of stone at Portland for the keys or bosses, together with  60 bases and capitals, including carriage by sea L4 16 8.\" The colouring  of the keystones was due to Stapledon in the first year of his  episcopate.    [Illustration: THE CHOIR, LOOKING WEST.                 The Photochrom. Co. Photo.]    [Illustration: THE CHOIR BEFORE RESTORATION                 (FROM AN ENGRAVING AFTER CHARLES WILD).]    Between 1870 and 1875 the choir underwent very extensive repairs. For  the most part they were successful, and if in particular instances  objection may be taken, it would be hyper-criticism to detract from  their value. Wherever possible, the stone was taken from the quarries  used by the first builders. The Purbeck marbles especially had severely  suffered, and the mouldings and bases ruthlessly destroyed for the  better accommodation of the wainscoting to the stalls; moreover, the  differences in the nature of the stone were rendered null by a hideous  yellow wash with which they had been lavishly besprinkled. During the  restoration the corbels and roof-bosses were cleaned and carefully  repaired. These, though of the same character as those in the nave, are  both richer and more varied in design and more skilfully carved.    #The Choir Stalls.#--The stalls are entirely modern, and the work of Sir  Gilbert Scott. Originally, no doubt, they were similar in style to the  bishop's throne, one of the most admirable of Stapledon's additions to  the cathedral. They were probably surmounted with canopies, with an open  arcade of stone behind them. The modern designer has so constructed his  stalls as to bear out this idea, since as far as possible they are meant  to replace the earlier ones. The misericords of Bishop Bruere have been  placed beneath the seats. These misericords have not their equal in  England. They are richly carved, representing foliage, wild beasts, an  elephant, men fighting, others playing musical instruments, and  legendary monsters. The introduction of an elephant proves that these  misericords were not completed until after Bruere's death in 1244; the  elephant having been first brought into England in 1255. There is also a  representation of a knight in a swan-boat, showing that the legend of  Lohengrin was known in England.    #The Reredos.#--This, too, is modern work, and most successfully has  Earp carried out the designs of Sir Gilbert Scott. It is of alabaster,  inlaid with agate, carnelian, and jasper. In the centre of the three  compartments into which it is divided is the Ascension, the other two  groups representing the Descent of the Holy Ghost and the  Transfiguration. As the work has met with considerable opposition, it is  well to remember Archdeacon Freeman's words, he having the best of all  rights to speak. \"With its delicate canopies of alabaster, and  sculptures wrought in bold relief, its inlay of choice marbles, its  redundance of costly stones, and its attendant angel figures, it  enshrines a multitude of ideas well harmonizing with its place and  purpose.\" The ancient altar of Stapledon's has long since disappeared.  This was mostly of silver, the mensa only being of marble. In the  monument of Leofric, erected by Hoker, the historian, was found a large  slab of marble marked with crosses. This possibly was a portion of  Stapledon's altar destroyed by an Order in Council, 1550 (see below, p.  69).    #The Bishop's Throne# was Stapledon's work, erected in 1316. It is  notable for not having a single nail in it, being entirely fixed  together with wooden pegs. This \"magnificent sheaf of carved oak,\" as it  has been called, rises to the height of fifty-seven feet. The carving  shows foliage and finials of great beauty, and beneath the canopies are  angel figures bearing the insignia of the Bishop's office. On one side  the chalice and Host of blessing; on the other, the bell, book, and  candle that conveyed the Bishop's curse.    At the date of the 1870 restorations the throne was in a very defective  state. It had been covered with brown paint, and the lower panels were  not a little damaged. There are traces of ancient colouring still, but  only the paintings at the base have been renovated, which commemorate  the quartette of famous bishops, Warelwast, Quivil, Stapledon, and  Grandisson, and were, no doubt, somewhat later than the throne itself.  Originally the niches of the tabernacle work were filled with figures,  but these have disappeared.    [Illustration: THE CHOIR, LOOKING EAST.                 The Photochrom. Co. Photo.]    [Illustration: SEDILIA IN THE CHOIR.                 The Photochrom. Co. Photo.]    #The Sedilia.#--It is natural after an examination of the throne in wood  to turn to Stapledon's equally splendid achievement in stone. The  sedilia were most carefully restored under Sir Gilbert Scott. There are  three arches, each ten feet high, of openwork, above which is a rich  display of tabernacle work. The niches once contained statues, for the  sockets are visible. The carving, extraordinarily skilful and intricate,  consists of leaves and animals' heads. Like much of the carving in the  cathedral that is attributed to this date, it was the work of De  Montacute, a French artist. The seats are divided by metal shafts, the  terminal divisions being supported by lions. It has been contended that  these lions are of considerably earlier date than the rest of the work;  but there is no evidence to go upon except a fancied resemblance to  Early English work. There seems no reason why Stapledon should not have  chosen lions as a fitting decoration, and carved them in a style more or  less traditional. Three small heads are carved on the back of the  sedilia, the centre one being that of Leofric, and on either side the  heads of Edward the Confessor and his wife Eadgytha. It will be  remembered that they were present, with their whole court, at the  installation of Leofric. The central seat is known as Leofric's stone,  on which he is traditionally said to have sat, and there is an entry in  the year 1418 recording that twenty pence was paid \"for writing on the  stone of my Lord Leofric.\"    On the triforium arcading, just over the sedilia, the heads of Leofric,  Edward, and Eadgytha are repeated.    The decoration of the choir vault is by Messrs. Clayton and Bell. The  attempt to give life to the roofing by gilding the bosses and painting  the ribs red and blue and gold, while the ground colour is a dull white,  is not without merit.    #Pulpit in Choir# of Devon marbles and alabaster, erected in 1871. The  beautifully carved panels represent our Lord blessing the children; the  Sermon on the Mount; St. Peter preaching on the day of Pentecost; St.  Paul at Athens; and St. Paul before Festus.    #The East Window.#--Henry de Blakeborn, a canon of the cathedral,  enlarged \"this Gable window in the Perpendicular style.\" Although it was  damaged a good deal in Cromwell's time, much of the old glass remains.  The shields on the upper part of the window are modern, but those at the  bottom are those of the first bishops and benefactors. The three centre  figures in the lowest row were added in Brantyngham's day.    [Illustration: PULPIT IN THE CHOIR.                 The Photochrom. Co. Photo.]    [Illustration: ST. JAMES' CHAPEL (DRAWN BY H.P. CLIFFORD).]    #St. James' Chapel.#--In the aisle on the south of the choir. In the  north aisle immediately opposite is the companion chapel of St. Andrew.  It will be noticed how frequently one part balances another throughout  the building. These chapels are partly Marshall's work. When the apsidal  chapels were pulled down at the time the apse was destroyed, Marshall  built the present chapels of St. James and St. Andrew. Bronscombe  altered them considerably, and the first item in the Fabric Rolls is,  \"for 3 windows for St. James Chapel 8s. 9d.; for glass 16s.\" This is the  last year of Bronscombe's episcopate, and proves he had, at any rate,  almost finished the renovation of this chapel. The most noticeable  features are the upper chamber, and the magnificent but half-destroyed  monument popularly known as Leofric's tomb. The chapel contained two  altars, one dedicated to St. James and the other probably to St. Thomas  of Canterbury.    Nearly opposite this chapel are the effigies of two knights, dating from  the fourteenth century; their cross-legged attitude leading to the  erroneous notion that they were Crusaders. They probably represent  Humphrey de Bohun, father of Margaret, wife of Hugh Courtenay, 1332, and  Sir Arthur Chichester of Raleigh, 1301. Old histories describe armorial  bearings painted on their shields, but these have long since perished.    #St. Andrew's Chapel.#--Opposite to, and corresponding with that of St.  James'. It was Marshall's work originally, like its fellow chapel, being  a substitute for one of the old apsidal chapels of the Norman choir.  Stapledon completed the renovations so as to make it a parallel to  Bronscombe's restored chapel of St. James. The detached shafts are  clearly an imitation of the earlier bishop's work. The chapel contains  an upper chamber, formerly used as a muniments room. The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19449"],[0,"The North American Indian, Vol. 1 (#10)"],[1,"E~}ni, quarrelled. The Bluebird revealed  to the latter the spot where Naye{~COMBINING BREVE~}nezgani kept his veins buried, so he  sought them out and shot arrows into them, thus killing him. Other myths  relate how Naye{~COMBINING BREVE~}nezgani was later resurrected, and he is still prayed to  as the chief War God.                           [Illustration: Apache Girl]                                   Apache Girl                 _From Copyright Photograph 1906 by E.S. Curtis_      2--Dutli{~COMBINING BREVE~}shi Skhin was created within the blue clouds at the time they were  made, and emerged from them. He took part in the creation, assisting  Kuterastan and Stenatlihan in finishing their work. At their direction he  made a few people and many birds and animals.    3--To Yolkai Skhin is attributed the creation of all white things. He  himself was brought into existence in the white cloud, and on emerging  therefrom immediately began the work of making white rock and shells under  the direction of Kuterastan and Stenatlihan.    4--Hadintin Skhin is the God of Disease and Health. It is he who causes  much sickness and he who can cure any disease, if he be so disposed.  Especial care is taken by the Apache not to arouse his displeasure, and he  is supplicated and propitiated whenever disease appears among them.    Disc M 1--Tubadzischi{~COMBINING BREVE~}ni, the second son of Stenatlihan, is the God of  Water, because his mother conceived as she slept one afternoon under a  ledge of rock from which drops of water trickled upon her. In the dance  for rain all prayers and songs are addressed to him. It was he who created  the ocean.    2--Yadilhkih Skhin is Chief of the Sky. In the origin story the Lightning  was sent to encircle the earth to find how things appeared on all sides.  On his return he brought back with him a large turquoise bowl containing  three ill-formed persons, one of whom was Sky Boy. Later all three were  put through a sweat-bath and their bodies perfected.    3--Yolkai Skhin, described above.    4--Hadintin Skhin, described above.                        [Illustration: The Ford - Apache]                                The Ford - Apache                 _From Copyright Photograph 1903 by E.S. Curtis_      Disc N 1--Yolkai Nali{~COMBINING BREVE~}n, one of the most venerated and greatly feared  personages in the Apache mythology. She is the Goddess of Death, or rather  of the after-life, for she controls all souls that pass on to the future  world. The road to this afterworld is supposed to cross her shoulders and  is symbolized by the Milky Way, a trail made by the departing spirits. The  Apache will not utter the name of a deceased person, because they say the  dead have gone on to Yolkai Nali{~COMBINING BREVE~}n and are her people. If they talked of  them it might anger her, and when their death ensues she might refuse them  admittance to the eternal paradise. This goddess is supposed to preside  over the birth of children, hence supplications and offerings are made to  her immediately before childbirth. She is invoked at other times to  withhold her call, for it is believed that she can cause death. These  prayers are addressed to Yolkai Nali{~COMBINING BREVE~}n through the medium of small white  shells and white stone beads. The white beads are symbolic of purity, and  through them Yolkai Nali{~COMBINING BREVE~}n is asked to keep the minds of the people free  from evil thoughts or deeds.    2--Dutli{~COMBINING BREVE~}shi Nali{~COMBINING BREVE~}n, the Turquoise Girl, is the creator of all things  green. She has to do with the crops in the fields, and the devout Apache  prays to her every morning during the season of growth.    3--Enasho Dilhkli{~COMBINING BREVE~}shen is the God of Intellect. He controls the minds of  the people, making their thoughts good or evil at will. It was he who  first talked to the people on earth. When a child is born its parents  often pray that Kuterastan will make it grow to be like Enasho  Dilhkli{~COMBINING BREVE~}shen, to whom prayers are addressed for aid when one must talk to  the people. In such case no offering of pollen is made unless the request  be presented to an image representing this god, when pollen is sprinkled  upon it.    4--Hadintin Nali{~COMBINING BREVE~}n is Chieftainess of Pollen, because she causes pollen to  grow on the trees. The Indians know the function of pollen in plants and  pray that their corn and other products of the fields, as well as the nuts  and fruits that grow wild, may be fructified early in the season, to  insure good harvests.    Disc O 1--Hadintin Nali{~COMBINING BREVE~}n, described above.    2--Nilchidilhkizn, Chief of the Winds. The Apache never complains of the  wind, for should he become impatient about them and give vent to  sacrilegious utterances he might anger the Wind God and thereby bring on  destructive storms.    3--Yolkai Nali{~COMBINING BREVE~}n, described above.    4--Yakosha Skhin, God of Moisture and also Controller of Rain. Since snow,  ice, hail, frost, dew, and fog are derived from the clouds, Yakosha Skhin  is sometimes termed Chief of the Clouds, but in general the clouds are  regarded as his workshop, for there is another who has direct charge and  control of them.    P, Q, R, and S--These figures represent gods, or, in Apache, _gaun_, who  are supposed to have been made by the Sun for the purpose of curing people  stricken with bodily disease. Diseases of the body are regarded as  distinct from those of the mind. The _gaun_ live in the four cardinal  directions and are impersonated in medicine ceremonies by men wearing  stick masks, who always take stations at the four sides of the patient.  These doctors are not called in case of illness until after the four chief  deities have been supplicated, when, as a last resort, the medicine-man  prays to the _gaun_. If the _gaun_ cannot help, there is believed to be no  hope for the patient. In ancient times all animals could talk, and many  were used as beasts of burden. The bear and the deer were the horses of  that time. In the graphic representations of the Apache these four spirits  are often pictured riding deer and bear.          MEDICINE AND MEDICINE-MEN      The medicine-men of the Apache are most influential personages. They are  usually men of more than ordinary ability, claiming, through their many  deities and their knowledge of the occult and ominous, to have  supernatural power. In sickness any individual may make supplication to  the deities, but the prayers of the medicine-men are accepted as being  most efficacious.                       [Illustration: Apache Medicine-man]                               Apache Medicine-man                 _From Copyright Photograph 1907 by E.S. Curtis_      Many of the medicine-men have some knowledge of the medicinal properties  of plants and generally make use of them in the treatment of disease, but  their treatment consists more of incantation than aught else. Even in  collecting the plants they invoke the deities, usually facing the cardinal  points in turn. In case the prescription calls for a combination of herbs  or other vegetal products, the number four is always strictly adhered to;  it might be a decoction made of four roots of one variety or of a single  root from each of four varieties of plants.    Every Apache medicine-man has a medicine skin, his _epu{~COMBINING BREVE~}n ezchi_,  inscribed with the symbolism of the tribal mythology. With his prayer  wands he rehearses the symbolic figures, praying to the mythical  characters who are regarded as most efficacious in the particular ailment  under treatment. In his own little _kowa_, or dwelling, with the painted  deerskin spread before him, on which are delineated the symbolic  representations of a score of gods comprising the Apache pantheon, a  medicine-man will sit and croon songs and pray all day and all night in  the hope of hearing the voices of celestial messengers.    Many of the prayers and songs of the Apache medicine-men are very  beautiful. The following is an example:    1 _Stena pehi{~COMBINING BREVE~}nda nzhoni, togonil adahe be{~COMBINING BREVE~}oishka__n__._    2 _Inate{~COMBINING BREVE~}sh nzhoni be{~COMBINING BREVE~}oishka__n__._    3 _Enude{~COMBINING BREVE~}tsos nzhoni be{~COMBINING BREVE~}oishka__n__._    4 _Inyatil nzhoni be{~COMBINING BREVE~}oishka__n__._    5 _Be{~COMBINING BREVE~}hnandahi inkehi togonil adahe be{~COMBINING BREVE~}oishka__n__._    6 _Indu{~COMBINING BREVE~}h binandahe be{~COMBINING BREVE~}oishka__n__._    7 _Beh nashalolezh nde; nasheyo shichi{~COMBINING TILDE~}sigo__n__ zho__n__dolezh._    8 _Nde shinkloho beh sanandahe be{~COMBINING BREVE~}oishka__n__._    9 _Beh sanashado be{~COMBINING BREVE~}oishka__n__._    10 _No osko__n__go adishni dahazhi behnashado ti nde ta nasheyo  go__n__zhodo._    11 _Shagocho paogo nasha._    12 _Akud nde sa nzhoni ye{~COMBINING BREVE~}sitchi ye{~COMBINING BREVE~}atido._    13 _Pidi yu{~COMBINING BREVE~}gga sa nzhoni ye{~COMBINING BREVE~}kissin shi{~COMBINING TILDE~}dil e{~COMBINING BREVE~}ndo._    14 _Shitu{~COMBINING BREVE~}h gozho__n__dolezh pogo hadishndi._    1 _Stenatliha__n__, you are good, I pray for a long life._    2 _I pray for your good looks._    3 _I pray for good breath._    4 _I pray for good speech._    5 _I pray for feet like yours to carry me through a long life._    6 _I pray for a life like yours._    7 _I walk with people; ahead of me all is well._    8 _I pray for people to smile as long as I live._    9 _I pray to live long._    10 _I pray, I say, for a long life to live with you where the good people  are._    11 _I live in poverty._    12 _I wish the people there to speak of goodness and to talk to me._    13 _I wish you to divide your good things with me, as a brother._    14 _Ahead of me is goodness, lead me on._    While this prayer is worded as if uttered by the supplicant, it is in  reality offered by the medicine-man in his behalf."]]]
