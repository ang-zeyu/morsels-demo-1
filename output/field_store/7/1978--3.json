In case the  Auckland assembly has been registered in the government, will you be so  kind as to send him photostatic reproductions of any registration papers  or documents that the Auckland friends may have obtained from the  authorities, as he wishes to have them published in the next \"Baha'i  World\"....    (Extract, ibid., p. 14)          (48) November 17th, 1936      Dear Baha'i Sister,    On behalf of the Guardian I acknowledge with deepest thanks the receipt of  your letter of the 17th October, and wish also to thank your Assembly for  forwarding to him the photostatic reproduction of the registration  certificate of the Assembly of Auckland....    (Extract, ibid., p. 18)          (49) January 31st, 1938      Dear Baha'i Sister,    The Guardian wishes me to express his loving thanks for your letter of the  third instant, enclosing the half-yearly reports of the Perth and Auckland  Spiritual Assemblies, all of which he has been delighted to read.    He wishes you to write the Auckland Assembly assuring them of his approval  of the request they have made on behalf of Miss Kitty Carpenter for  permission to visit Haifa. He has every hope that through this pilgrimage  she will be greatly refreshed and strengthened spiritually, and will upon  her return home impart to the friends in New-Zealand some measure of the  inspiration she will gain through close contact with the Holy Shrines....    (Extract, ibid., p. 24)          (50) November 2nd, 1938      Dear Baha'i Sister,    ...The Guardian wishes me to express his gratification at the news of the  enrolment of three new members in the Sydney Baha'i group, and of two  others in the Auckland community. He will pray that these new believers  may continue deepening in their faith, and in their understanding of the  Teachings, and that each of them may arise and lend every assistance in  his power to the further expansion and firmer consolidation of the Faith  in that far-off continent....    (Extract, ibid., p. 28)          (51) March 22nd, 1939      Dear Baha'i Brothers and Sisters,    The Guardian wishes me to gratefully acknowledge the receipt of your card  conveying to him your Assembly's greetings for Naw-Ruz, and to assure you  how deeply he feels appreciative of the renewed expressions of love which  you had felt prompted to transmit to him on such a happy and blessed  occasion.    He immeasurably values indeed your sentiments, and wishes me to take this  opportunity of assuring your Assembly, and all the members of the Auckland  Baha'i Community, of his ardent prayers for the further extension of the  Faith, and its firmer consolidation in your centre, and for the spiritual  advancement and welfare of each and every member of your group. May this  new Baha'i Year we have just entered witness a fresh intensification of  the spirit of service in the heart of each one of you, and lead you to  scale still nobler heights of service and sacrifice in your stewardship to  the Cause.    Reciprocating your kind greetings and with all good wishes for a happy  Naw-Ruz.    Yours in His Service,  H.

She had the great  honour and blessing of being the first New-Zealand believer and her reward  must be great....    [From the Guardian:]    _Dear and valued co-workers:_    _...The passing of yet another staunch and indefatigable worker, Miss  Stevenson, constitutes yet another loss to the believers in that  continent. The work which that exemplary pioneer has achieved however is  imperishable. Kindly assure her relatives of my deepfelt sympathy._    _Sh._    (Extract, ibid., pp. 38, 39)          (53) April 25th, 1941      Dear Baha'i friends:    Shoghi Effendi has instructed me to answer your Naw-Ruz greetings of the  year 98.    He deeply appreciated your thought in sending him a message at such a  time. The loving remembrance of the friends is dear to his heart in these  heavy and sad times.    He assures you that the friends of Australia and New Zealand are often in  his thoughts and prayers, and he is so pleased with the continued  evidences of their devotion and services to the Cause of God.    With Baha'i greetings,    Yours in His Service,  R. Rabbani          (54) April 18th, 1942      Dear Baha'i Sister:    ...He was delighted to learn that the New Zealand members were able to  make the trip to Australia, and that such a highly satisfactory N.S.A.  meeting was held, in such a spirit of love and harmony. No doubt this  experience will prove of great value, not only to the National Assembly,  but also to the work of the Cause in the days to come....    (Extract, ibid., p. 45)          (55) May 12th, 1944      Dear Baha'i Sister:    Your letters dated March 1st, 25th and March 21st--Baha'i Naw-Ruz  greeting--have been received, and the Guardian has instructed me to answer  them on his behalf.    He was very pleased indeed to hear that the Cause in New Zealand is not  only steadily progressing but that it is winning such good friends as Rev.  Chandler. Also the preparations you are making for the Centenary should  serve to not only publicise the Faith, but bring the believers closer to  liberal-minded fellow-citizens.    He himself is at present frightfully busy with local preparations for the  Centenary and with cables and correspondence--but he wishes you all to  know that his thoughts will be with you on this glorious day of the 100th  anniversary of the Bab's declaration, and he will pray for all the New  Zealand Baha'is in the Holy Shrines.    With most loving greetings and best wishes from the Guardian for the  success of all your plans.    Yours with Baha'i love,  R. Rabbani    P.S. He appreciated very much your sending Naw-Ruz greetings.

Dear Baha'i friends:    Your letter of October 25th was received and our Guardian was delighted to  hear the details of this property you have purchased, and which he trusts  will grow to be a very important Baha'i endowment. He will be pleased to  receive the pictures of it.    He felt that no name could be more befitting than that of dear father  Dunn. May the spirit this wonderful soul exemplified stream forth from  your school and quicken those Islands.    With Baha'i greetings,  R. Rabbani    P.S. Since writing this letter yours of Nov. 29 has been received. He will  certainly pray for the success of your Summer School sessions so soon to  begin and for the speedy development of the new school property you have  just purchased.    [From the Guardian:]    _May the Almighty bless bountifully your meritorious labours, guide and  sustain you, at all times and under all circumstances, aid you to overcome  every obstacle that confronts you and enable you to lend a tremendous  impetus, in the days to come, to the progress of your historic work in  that promising and far-away Island._    _Your true and grateful brother, _  _ Shoghi_          (57) June 28th, 1950      The National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Australia and New  Zealand.    Dear Baha'i Friends:    ...As Mrs Axford requested Mrs Thomas to write about her Baha'i life there  is every reason to respect her wishes. This in no way precludes the New  Zealand Community from writing about her services and life and keeping  this record in the National archives. The Guardian feels the Auckland  Assembly should be consulted, as her, (Mrs Axford's), home community, by  Mrs Thomas. He hopes this In Memoriam article, about so dear and tireless  a servant of the Faith, will produce a spirit of love and co-operation  amongst all concerned....    The acquisition of the site for the New Zealand Summer School was a great  step forward in the progress of the Faith there, and he was very pleased  about it. He was also delighted to hear of the formation of the Devonport  Assembly, and he hopes next year there will be still more....    (Extract, ibid., p. 83)          (58) November 1st, 1950      Secretary,  Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Auckland, New Zealand    Dear Baha'i Brother,    Your letter on behalf of the Assembly, (as well as your personal note)  dated July 6, have been received, but due to the pressure of work piled up  during the long and serious illness of Mr Maxwell the Guardian's  correspondence has piled up unanswered for some time.    He is very pleased to hear the Cause is making progress in New Zealand and  the friends unitedly serving, which is the most important thing of all.    He was also pleased to hear the Summer School property will be gradually  developed and serve the friends and the Community at large in other ways.  He thanks you for the plan of it sent under separate cover.    He sends his loving greetings to all the members of the Assembly, and also  would like to wish you success with your book.

Dear Baha'i Friends:    ...I would like to add that the Guardian does not consider that it is  advisable for New Zealand to be separated in the near future from  Australia, and come"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19252"],[0,"Bahá'í Administration (#10)"],[1,"and inclinations, and  concentrate their minds upon those measures that will conduce to the  welfare and happiness of the Baha'i Community and promote the common weal.          The Baha'i Fund      And as the progress and execution of spiritual activities is dependent and  conditioned upon material means, it is of absolute necessity that  immediately after the establishment of local as well as national Spiritual  Assemblies, a Baha'i Fund be established, to be placed under the exclusive  control of the Spiritual Assembly. All donations and contributions should  be offered to the Treasurer of the Assembly, for the express purpose of  promoting the interests of the Cause, throughout that locality or country.  It is the sacred obligation of every conscientious and faithful servant of  Baha'u'llah who desires to see His Cause advance, to contribute freely and  generously for the increase of that Fund. The members of the Spiritual  Assembly will at their own discretion expend it to promote the Teaching  Campaign, to help the needy, to establish educational Baha'i institutions,  to extend in every way possible their sphere of service. I cherish the  hope that all the friends, realizing the necessity of this measure, will  bestir themselves and contribute, however modestly at first, towards the  speedy establishment and the increase of that Fund.    The need for the centralization of authority in the National Spiritual  Assembly, and the concentration of power in the various local Assemblies,  is made manifest when we reflect that the Cause of Baha'u'llah is still in  its age of tender growth and in a stage of transition; when we remember  that the full implications and the exact significance of the Master's  world-wide instructions, as laid down in His Will, are as yet not fully  grasped, and the whole Movement has not sufficiently crystallized in the  eyes of the world.    It is our primary task to keep the most vigilant eye on the manner and  character of its growth, to combat effectively the forces of separation  and of sectarian tendencies, lest the Spirit of the Cause be obscured, its  unity be threatened, its Teachings suffer corruption; lest extreme  orthodoxy on one hand, and irresponsible freedom on the other, cause it to  deviate from that Straight Path which alone can lead it to success.          The Most Essential Obligation      But let us be on our guard--so the Master continually reminds us from His  Station on high--lest too much concern in that which is secondary in  importance, and too long a preoccupation with the details of our affairs  and activities, make us neglectful of the most essential, the most urgent  of all our obligations, namely, to bury our cares and teach the Cause,  delivering far and wide this Message of Salvation to a sorely-stricken  world.    To His valiant combatants on earth, who at times may feel disheartened,  our ever-victorious Commander, 'Abdu'l-Baha, gives us the following  assurance:    \"O ye servants of the Sacred Threshold! The triumphant Hosts of the  Celestial Concourse, arrayed and marshalled in the Realms above, stand  ready and expectant to assist and assure victory to that valiant horseman  who with confidence spurs on his charger into the arena of service. Well  is it with that fearless warrior, who armed with the power of true  Knowledge, hastens unto the field, disperses the armies of ignorance, and  scatters the hosts of error, who holds aloft the Standard of Divine  Guidance, and sounds the Clarion of Victory. By the righteousness of the  Lord! He hath achieved a glorious triumph and obtained the true  victory....\"    With such inspiring words as these, are we to remain any longer unmoved  and inactive? His trumpet-call resounds on every side, and summons us to  service; are we to tarry and hesitate? His voice is calling aloud from  every land; let us march on, unfettered and unafraid, and fulfill our  glorious Destiny.    SHOGHI.    Haifa, Palestine,  March 12, 1923.          Transliteration of Baha'i Terms      P.S. On another page(6) is given the list of the best known and most  current Baha'i terms, and other Oriental names and expressions, all  properly and accurately transliterated, the faithful spelling of which by  all the Western friends will avoid confusion in future, and insure in this  matter a uniformity which is greatly needed at present in all Baha'i  literature. The full code will be duly communicated to the various  National Assemblies, and the transliteration of the Oriental terms  mentioned in the English letters sent out by the Haifa Spiritual Assembly  will provide a correct and reliable supplement to the above-mentioned  list. I feel confident that all the friends will from now on follow this  system and adhere scrupulously and at all times to this code in all their  writings.          Letter of April 8th, 1923.      To the beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful, the  accredited delegates to the Annual Convention of America, Chicago,  Illinois.    Dearly beloved brothers and sisters in 'Abdu'l-Baha:    On this auspicious occasion, when the elected representatives of the  Baha'i Community throughout the continent of America, gathered for the  first time within the Foundation Hall of the stately edifice of the  Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar, are assembled to take counsel together regarding  those vital issues that confront the Cause of Baha'u'llah in that land,  may I, as one of your humble fellow-workers in the field of service, offer  you from the very depths of my heart my brotherly love and sincere  greetings, and assure you of my fervent prayers for the success of your  deliberations and the attainments of your hearts' desire.    You stand at this challenging hour in the history of the Cause at the  threshold of a new era; the functions you are called upon to discharge are  fraught with immense possibilities; the responsibilities you shoulder are  grave and momentous; and the eyes of many peoples are turned, at this  hour, towards you, expectant to behold the dawning of a Day that shall  witness the fulfilment of His divine Promise.    Forgetful of the past and its vicissitudes, conscious of the need for  renewed and combined effort, freed from all earthly limitations and  motives, with every lingering trace of ill-feeling forever banished from  our hearts, freshly united and determined, let us join in deep and silent  communion with the ever-watchful Spirit of our beloved 'Abdu'l-Baha, and  with humility and earnestness supplicate for the guidance that will enable  us to fulfil the task which is now committed to our charge. May this  year's Convention, by the range of its activities, by the character of its  proceedings, by its faithful adherence to the divine Instructions of our  loving Master, and above all by its radiant spirit of enthusiasm and true  fellowship, prove itself one of the greatest landmarks in the history of  the Cause in America.    May the all-pervading Spirit of Baha'u'llah so permeate the souls of its  members as to cause it to mirror forth the glories and the splendors of  the Celestial Concourse.    Your devoted brother,  SHOGHI.    Haifa, Palestine.  April 8, 1923.          Letter of April 9th, 1923.      To the members of the American National Spiritual Assembly.    Dearest friends:    I have lately received your long-awaited reports on the present situation  of the Movement in that land, and have read them all, together with their  enclosures, with the utmost care and deepest interest.    I am much impressed and feel deeply gratified to learn of your devoted and  unremitting labors, individually and collectively in the field of service  to the Cause; of your constant vigilance and watchful care in upholding  its fundamental principles and guarding its essential interests; of the  efficiency, faithfulness and vigor with which you are conducting the  administration of its affairs throughout that land.    Many and grave may be the obstacles, whether from within or from without,  which we shall have to encounter in the days to come, but we feel sure  that if we but maintain consistently before our eyes a broad and noble  vision of its significance and vital necessity in these days, and above  all of its universality and all-conquering power, we shall be enabled to  surmount them, one and all, and by the Power of Faith, carry the Ark of  the Covenant to its Haven of Safety and Triumph.    It is, I firmly believe, of the utmost urgent importance that, with unity  of purpose and action firmly established in our midst, and with every  trace of the animosity and mistrust of the past banished from our hearts,  we should form one united front and combat, wisely and tactfully, every  force that might darken the spirit of the Movement, cause division in its  ranks, and narrow it by dogmatic and sectarian belief.          National Spiritual Assemblies      It is primarily upon the elected members of the National Spiritual  Assemblies throughout the Baha'i world that this highly important duty  devolves, as in their hands the direction and management of all spiritual  Baha'i activities have been placed and centralized, and as they constitute  in the eyes of the people of their country the supreme body in that land  that officially represents, promotes and safeguards the various interests  of the Cause, it is my fervent prayer and my most cherished desire, that  the unfailing guidance of Baha'u'llah and the blessings of our beloved  Master will enable them to set a high and true example to all other Baha'i  institutions and local Assemblies, and will show them what absolute  harmony, mature deliberation and whole-hearted cooperation can achieve.    Should such a representative and responsible body fail to realize this  fundamental requisite for all successful achievement, the whole structure  is sure to crumble, and the Great Plan of the Future, as unfolded by the  Master's Will and Testament, will be"]]]
