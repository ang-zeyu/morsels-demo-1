No courtier's, toying with a sword,        Nor minstrel's, laid across a lute;      A chief's, uplifted to the Lord        When all the kings of earth were mute!        The hand of Anak, sinewed strong,        The fingers that on greatness clutch;      Yet, lo! the marks their lines along        Of one who strove and suffered much.        For here in knotted cord and vein        I trace the varying chart of years;      I know the troubled heart, the strain,        The weight of Atlas--and the tears.        Again I see the patient brow        That palm erewhile was wont to press;      And now 'tis furrowed deep, and now        Made smooth with hope and tenderness.        For something of a formless grace        This moulded outline plays about;      A pitying flame, beyond our trace,        Breathes like a spirit, in and out,--        The love that cast an aureole        Round one who, longer to endure,      Called mirth to ease his ceaseless dole,        Yet kept his nobler purpose sure.        Lo, as I gaze, the statured man,        Built up from yon large hand, appears;      A type that Nature wills to plan        But once in all a people's years.        What better than this voiceless cast        To tell of such a one as he,      Since through its living semblance passed        The thought that bade a race be free!      NOTES    =this cast=:--A cast of Lincoln's hand was made by Leonard W. Volk, in  1860, on the Sunday following the nomination of Lincoln for the  Presidency. The original, in bronze, can be seen at the National Museum  in Washington. Various copies have been made in plaster. An anecdote  concerning one of these is told on page 107 of William Dean Howells's  _Literary Friends and Acquaintances_; facing page 106 of the same book  there is an interesting picture. In the _Critic_, volume 44, page 510,  there is an article by Isabel Moore, entitled _Hands that have Done  Things_; a picture of Lincoln's hand, in plaster, is given in the course  of this article.    =Anak=:--The sons of Anak are spoken of in the Bible as a race of  giants. See Numbers, 13:33; Deuteronomy, 9:2.    =Atlas=:--In Greek story, the giant who held the world on his shoulders.    =the thought=:--The Emancipation Proclamation.      SUGGESTIONS FOR STUDY    Read the poem through from beginning to end. Then go back to the first  and study it more carefully. Notice that there is no pause at the end of  the first stanza. In the ninth line, mentally put in _how_ after _know_.  Explain what is said about Freedom's training her son. _Loftier office_:  Loftier than what? Note that _might_ is a noun. Mentally insert _hand_  after _courtier's_. Can you tell from the hand of a person whether he  has suffered or not? What does the author mean here by \"the weight of  Atlas\"? What is a \"formless grace\"? Is the expression appropriate here?  What characteristic of Lincoln is referred to in the line beginning  \"Called mirth\"? Are great men so rare as the author seems to think? Why  is the cast a good means of telling of \"such a one as he\"? Look  carefully at one of Lincoln's portraits, and then read this poem aloud  to yourself.    Compare this poem with the sonnet _On the Life-Mask of Abraham Lincoln_,  page 210.

A door at the back opens on  the street. At one side, a window overlooks the garden; at the other,  curtains hang before an alcove._ MADEMOISELLE, _the Bishop's_ SISTER, _a  sweet-faced lady, sits by the fire, knitting._ MADAME, _his_  HOUSEKEEPER, _is laying the table for supper._]    MLLE. Has the Bishop returned from the service?    MADAME. Yes, Mademoiselle. He is in his room, reading. Shall I  call him?    MLLE. No, do not disturb him--he will come in good time--when  supper is ready.    MADAME. Dear me--I forgot to get bread when I went out to-day.    MLLE. Go to the baker's, then; we will wait.    [_Exit Madame. Pause._]    [_Enter the_ BISHOP. _He is an old man, gentle and kindly._]    BISHOP. I hope I have not kept you waiting, sister.    MLLE. No, brother, Madame has just gone out for bread. She  forgot it this morning.    BISHOP (_having seated himself by the fire_). The wind blows  cold from the mountains to-night.    MLLE. (_nodding_). All day it has been growing colder.    BISHOP. 'Twill bring great suffering to the poor.    MLLE. Who suffer too much already.    BISHOP. I would I could help them more than I do!    MLLE. You give all you have, my brother. You keep nothing for  yourself--you have only bare necessities.    BISHOP. Well, I have sent in a bill for carriage hire in making  pastoral visits.    MLLE. Carriage hire! I did not know you ever rode. Now I am  glad to hear that. A bishop should go in state sometimes. I venture to  say your bill is small.    BISHOP. Three thousand francs.    MLLE. Three thousand francs! Why, I cannot believe it!    BISHOP. Here is the bill.    MLLE. (_reading bill_). What is this!

Ha, ha! I might have known it!    [_They laugh together._]    [_Enter_ MADAME, _excited, with bread._]    MADAME. Such news as I have heard! The whole town is talking  about it! We should have locks put on our doors at once!    MLLE. What is it, Madame? What have you heard?    MADAME. They say there is a suspicious vagabond in the town.  The inn-keeper refused to take him in. They say he is a released convict  who once committed an awful crime.    [_The Bishop is looking into the fire, paying no attention to Madame._]    MLLE. Do you hear what Madame is saying, brother?    BISHOP. Only a little. Are we in danger, Madame?    MADAME. There is a convict in town, your Reverence!    BISHOP. Do you fear we shall be robbed?    MADAME. I do, indeed!    BISHOP. Of what?    MADAME. There are the six silver plates and the silver  soup-ladle and the two silver candlesticks.    BISHOP. All of which we could do without.    MADAME. Do without!    MLLE. 'Twould be a great loss, brother. We could not treat a  guest as is our wont.    BISHOP. Ah, there you have me, sister. I love to see the silver  laid out for every guest who comes here. And I like the candles lighted,  too; it makes a brighter welcome.    MLLE. A bishop's house should show some state.    BISHOP. Aye--to every stranger! Henceforth, I should like every  one of our six plates on the table whenever we have a guest here.    MLLE. All of them?    MADAME. For one guest?    BISHOP. Yes--we have no right to hide treasures. Each guest  shall enjoy all that we have.    MADAME. Then 'tis time we should look to the locks on the  doors, if we would keep our silver. I'll go for the locksmith now--    BISHOP. Stay! This house shall not be locked against any man!  Would you have me lock out my brothers?    [_A loud knock is heard at street door._]    Come in!    [_Enter_ JEAN VALJEAN, _with his knapsack and cudgel. The women  are frightened._]    JEAN (_roughly_). See here! My name is Jean Valjean. I am a  convict from the galleys. I was set free four days ago, and I am looking  for work. I hoped to find a lodging here, but no one will have me. It  was the same way yesterday and the day before. To-night a good woman  told me to knock at your door. I have knocked. Is this an inn?    BISHOP. Madame, put on another plate.    JEAN. Stop! You do not understand, I think. Here is my  passport--see what it says: \"Jean Valjean, discharged convict, has been  nineteen years in the galleys; five years for theft; fourteen years for  having attempted to escape. He is a very dangerous man.\" There! you know  it all. I ask only for straw in your stable.    BISHOP.

The melancholy remnant  preserve traditions of prosperity in comparatively recent times.  Notwithstanding their miserable condition, however, these wretched  people are drained by taxation of thirty mahboubs per annum--so many  drops of blood! The eastern village pays in proportion. Possibly in a  few years this cluster of wadys may be abandoned to chance Arab  visitors, so that the starting-point for the traverse of the Hamadah  will be removed farther back, perhaps to Mizdah. There is no life in the  civilisation which claims lordship over these countries unfriended by  nature. The only object of those who wield paramount authority over them  seems to be to extract money in the most vexatious and expeditious  manner.    I purchased of the people of Ghareeah a greyhound bitch for four  Tunisian piastres, so that we may now expect some hares and gazelles. In  returning to the encampment I observed the phenomenon of a column of  dust carried into the heavens in a spiral form by the wind, whilst all  around was perfectly calm. Such columns are not of so frequent  occurrence in the desert as is imagined, but from time to time, as in  this instance, are seen.    The evening was spent in making arrangements with Dr. Barth and Dr.  Overweg, who had agreed to traverse the Hamadah by day, whilst I was to  follow by night, with the blacks. Next morning, accordingly, the caravan  separated into two portions, and my companions rode slowly away over the  burning desert.    This important day could not be allowed to pass by my people without a  tremendous quarrel. Our blacks seemed to be in a peculiarly excitable  state. Ali, especially, who has distinguished himself for several days  in the obstreperous line, has had a regular turn-to with his  father-in-law; and not satisfied with this, nearly strangled Moknee's  son. The Mandara black threw himself on the ground and called  out,--\"Load my pistol, O Chaouch; I must shoot this reprobate Ali!\"    This fellow is a pest in the caravan, and I have been obliged to send  him off and insist on his return to Tripoli. He may be brought to his  senses in this way.          CHAPTER IV.

The sun was setting as our caravan, which we had collected in as compact  a body as possible, got under way, and rising out of the valley of  Tabooneeah, began to enter upon the plateau. It is difficult to convey  an idea of the solemn impressions with which one enters upon such a  journey. Everything ahead is unknown and invested with perhaps  exaggerated terrors by imagination and report. The name of Desert--the  waterless Desert--hangs over the horizon, and suggests the most gloomy  apprehensions. Behind, in the fading light, the trees of the valley  still show their dim groups; before, the lofty level, slightly broken by  undulations, stretches away. There was one cheering thought, however. My  companions had by this time set up their tent for the night; and  although, creeping along at the camel's slow pace, we could not expect  to come up to that temporary home until it was about to be deserted,  still the knowledge of its existence took away much of the mysterious  terror with which I entered upon this desolate region in the hour of  coming shadows. An additional solemnity was imparted to the commencement  of this arduous journey by the fact that we now passed the last pillar  erected by the Romans. Their mighty power seems to have recoiled, as  well it might, before the horrid aspect of the Hamadah.    We pushed on at a steady pace over the rough ground; and as I surveyed  the scene from my elevated position on the camel's back, I could not  help contrasting this primitive style of travelling with that with which  I had been conversant a few months before. Instead of whirling along the  summit of an embankment, or through a horizontal well miles deep, in a  machine that always reminded me of a disjointed dragon, at the rate of  some fifty miles an hour, here I was leisurely swaying to and fro on the  back of the slowest beast that man has ever tamed, in the midst of a  crowd loosely scattered over the country, some on foot, some in the  saddle--not seeking to keep any determinate track, but following a  general direction by the light of the stars, which shine with warm  beneficence overhead. There is no sound to attract the ear, save the  measured tread of the caravan, the occasional \"_Isa! Isa!_\" of the  drivers, the hasty wrench with which our camels snatch a mouthful of  some ligneous plant that clings to the stony soil, the creaking of the  baggage, or the whistling of the wind that comes moaning over the  desert. These are truly moments in a man's life to remember; and I shall  ever look back to that solemn night-march over the desert, which my pen  fails to describe, with sentiments of pleasurable awe.    This night we moved at comparatively a rapid pace--nearly three miles an  hour; for there was scarcely any temptation to the camels to linger for  browsing purposes, and the drivers seemed desperately anxious to get  over as much ground as possible at once. At first all went well enough;  and now and then even, the blacks, who were on foot, braved the Hamadah  with a lively ditty--celebrating some Lucy Long of Central Africa. But  by degrees these merry sounds ceased to be heard; and the hastily-moving  crowd of the caravan insensibly stretched out into a longer line. The  poor women were beginning to knock up, and several fell at times from  mere exhaustion. We proceeded, however, without stopping, for eleven  hours, and after a long, dreary night indeed, halted at five in the  morning, having reached the encampment of our German friends.    The dawn soon lighted up the waste, and enabled us to see that it was a  level plain of hard red earth, scattered over with pebbles and loose  pieces of limestone mixed with flint.    The Hamadah was very cold in the night, the wind being from the north.  Dr. Overweg does not think that the plateau is more than fifteen hundred  feet above the level of the sea; but it may be two thousand, and a  little more in some places. By day it is hot enough; and as there is  little to be observed on these vast, elevated stretches of stony desert,  I thought it best to continue my original plan for three whole nights.    To spare one's self is the great secret of Saharan travelling; and there  is, after all, not much to observe in this desolate region.    I should mention, that the second night Ali came up in a penitent state  along with a khafilah from Ghareeah, and so our poor black women had an  opportunity of getting a lift on the spare camels. We could, therefore,  go on until morning without fear of losing any of our party in the  night. The position of a person who falls behind a caravan in the desert  very much resembles that of a man overboard. This khafilah preceded us  to Shaty.    After the third night I found the weather so cool and temperate, that I  continued on the whole of the day; and the Germans joining me in the  evening, we did not again separate. It was towards the close of the  third night that we were assailed by an awful tempest of wind, rain, and  lightning, which flashed upon us occasionally through the thick  darkness. The Germans, who were encamped, had their tents carried away,  whilst we who were in motion found ourselves compelled to stop and  crouch under the bellies of our camels until the morning broke, and the  hurricane had spent its force. The cold was intense, and our people  complained bitterly. More than once, indeed, the thermometer was down to  freezing-point whilst we were traversing the plateau; and one morning  the desert was covered with a shining frost.    Although we became accustomed to the desolate appearance of this  district by degrees, we counted eagerly the days and hours that brought  us nearer the confines of Fezzan. Every night's incidents were the same.  On we went, nodding drowsily on our camels, sometimes dropping off into  a sound sleep, variegated by a snatch of pleasant dreams. But these  indulgences are dangerous. I was more than once on the point of falling  off. By day, few objects of interest presented themselves: linnets and  finches fluttered here and there upon the rare bushes, whilst swallows  joined the caravan, and skimmed round and round for hours among the  camels, almost brushing the faces of the drivers. Lizards glanced and  snakes writhed across the path. We started three wadan or mouflon,  churlish animals, fond of such solitudes. As to the birds, our people  say they do not drink in winter, and in summer leave the Hamadah  altogether. Four-fifths of the surface were utterly barren. Little  mounds marked the graves of children, slaves who had perished on the way  from inner Africa. The mirage was common, but rarely pretty. Sometimes  ridges of low mountains seemed raised on the level plain, probably  reflected from the cliffs that edge the plateau. The scattered herbage  also assumed regular forms--squares, ovals, circles. Now and then it  seemed as if vast ruins were ahead, but as we drew nigh these dwindled  into little desert-mosques, formed of half-circles of stones, now turned  to the east, now to the west.
