The explosion of the American's lower guns at the opening of the battle  had made her helpless against the corresponding battery of the enemy,  which pounded away until a huge, yawning gap was opened. Some of the  shots went clean through the battered hull and splashed into the water,  hundreds of feet distant. The disadvantage was more than offset by the  concentration of the Americans on the upper deck and in the rigging. The  fire of the _Bonhomme Richard_ became so terrible that every officer and  man of the enemy kept out of sight, observing which an American seaman  crawled out on the main yard, carrying a bucket of hand grenades which  he threw wherever he saw a man. He did this with such excellent aim that  he dropped one through the main hatchway and into the gunroom. It fell  into a heap of powder and produced an explosion that was awful beyond  description, for it killed and wounded thirty-eight men and really  decided the battle.    At that moment, when it all seemed over, Captain Landais fired a  broadside from the _Alliance_ into the _Bonhomme Richard_. Captain Jones  called to him in God's name to desist, but he circled about the two  ships and fired again and again into his ally, killing and wounding a  number of men and officers. It was believed that the _Alliance_ had been  captured by the enemy and had joined in the attack on the _Bonhomme  Richard_, which was so injured that she began slowly to sink. Having  wrought this irreparable damage, the _Alliance_ drew off and ceased her  murderous work.    Jones incited his prisoners to desperate pumping by the report that the  _Serapis_ must soon go down and that the only way to save themselves  from drowning was to keep the _Bonhomme_ afloat. An officer ran to the  quarter deck to haul down the colors, but they had been shot away. He  then hurried to the taffrail and shouted for quarter. Jones, being in  another part of the ship, did not hear him. The British commander  mustered his men to board the American, but they were driven back by the  firing from the rigging of the _Bonhomme Richard_. The condition of the  latter could not have been more desperate. She was so mangled that she  began to settle, most of her guns had been disabled, a fire that could  not be checked was already close to her magazine and several hundred  prisoners were stealing here and there, waiting for a chance to strike  from behind.    [Illustration: OLD-TIME BATTLESHIPS.]    A deserter had slipped on board of the _Serapis_ in the confusion and  acquainted the commander with the frightful plight of the American.  After firing with renewed ardor for several minutes Captain Pearson  again called to know whether Jones had surrendered. He shouted back a  defiant negative, and, pistol in hand, ordered his men to the guns,  threatening to kill the first one who refused. All knew his temper too  well to hesitate, and the battle was renewed with greater fury than  before. Captain Pearson could not believe the condition of the _Bonhomme  Richard_ as bad as was represented by the deserter. He had lost a great  many men, all his guns were silenced, and, being utterly unable to make  any further defence, he hauled down his flag with his own hands.    The surrender was just in time to save the _Bonhomme Richard_, which  was in danger of going down and blowing up. The united efforts of both  crews were necessary to extinguish the flames before they reached the  magazine. She was kept afloat through the night, while the wounded and  prisoners were transferred to the _Serapis_. Then the battered and  riddled old hulk plunged downward bow foremost into the depths of the  German Ocean.    [Illustration: MEDAL PRESENTED BY CONGRESS TO CAPTAIN JOHN PAUL JONES.]    This battle has never been surpassed in heroism. Both sides fought with  a bravery that has given the conflict a place by itself in naval  annals, and it will always stand as a proof of the dauntless courage of  the Anglo-Saxon beyond the reach of those of the Latin race. The  _Bonhomme Richard_ had 42 guns and the _Serapis_ 50; the American crew  numbered 304 and the English 320. The killed on each side was 49; the  wounded on the _Bonhomme Richard_ was 116 and on the _Serapis_ 117,  there being a difference of only one in the total of killed and wounded.  The battle lasted three hours and a half.    The _Countess of Scarborough_ made a gallant resistance for two hours,  when she was so crippled that she was compelled to surrender to the  Frenchman. An investigation into the treacherous conduct of Captain  Landais caused many to believe him insane, though others were convinced  that he was inspired by intense jealousy of Captain Jones. He was  discharged from both the French and American navy. Benjamin Franklin was  among those who believed he deserved punishment for his perfidy.    The _Serapis_ and _Countess of Scarborough_ were refitted and given to  France, while Captain Jones was placed in command of the _Alliance_. He  was loaded with honors in France, the king presenting him with a gold  sword, and when he sailed for the United States he gave another  exhibition of his superb seamanship by eluding the blockaders that were  waiting for him outside of Texel, running through the Straits of Dover  and then defiantly standing down the English Channel in full view of  more than one of the largest British fleets. He reached the United  States in June, 1780, without mishap.    Congress gave Captain Jones a vote of thanks, and, had the war  continued, no doubt he would have rendered more brilliant service for  the country he loved so well, but before he could be given a fitting  command hostilities ceased. He had won a world-wide reputation and  accepted the appointment of rear-admiral in the Russian navy, but gained  no opportunity to display his marvelous prowess. He died in Paris in  1792.          CHAPTER VII.      Our Naval War with France--The Tribute Paid to the Barbary States by  Christian Nations--War Declared Against the United States by  Tripoli--Bainbridge, Decatur, Stewart, Dale and Preble.        Now I suspect that if my young readers were asked to name the nations  with which, at one time or another we have been at war, they would not  be likely to include France in the list. All the same, we have had a war  with her, though it was confined to the ocean and there was no formal  declaration on either side.    A few years after the close of our Revolution one of the most appalling  uprisings in the history of the world took place in France. The kings  and nobility ground the people into the very dust until they were goaded  into revolt, which overturned the throne and was marked by atrocities  that shocked the world. Incredible as it may seem, there were a million  people put to death during the awful days of the Reign of Terror.    The mad rulers, not satisfied with deluging their own country with  blood, were at war with most of the neighboring nations. They seemed to  wish to array themselves against all mankind and began a system of  action toward us which soon became unbearable.    They seemed to think we could be scared into paying the rulers immense  sums of money for the privilege of being left alone. They encouraged  their naval officers to capture American vessels, and when we sent  commissioners to France to protest they were coolly told that outrages  upon our commerce would not be stopped until we paid the leaders several  hundred thousand dollars in the way of bribes. Then it was that one of  our commissioners made the memorable reply: \"Millions for defence, but  not one cent for tribute.\"    Our representatives were driven out of France and the capture of our  vessels by French cruisers continued. So Congress met, cancelled all  treaties with France, formed an army, placed Washington, then an old  man, at the head, formed a new navy and told the men-of-war to go out  and give the insolent nation a lesson she very much needed.    And France got the lesson. The fighting on the ocean, beginning in 1798,  continued for two years and a half. The French cruisers succeeded in  capturing only one vessel from the American navy, while 84 armed French  ships, mostly privateers, mounting more than 500 guns, were captured by  our vessels. In February, 1801, a treaty of peace was signed with  France, which brought our troubles with her to an end.    Now, if you will examine your map of Africa, you will notice a group of  countries along the southern coast of the Mediterranean that are known  as the Barbary States. Their names are Morocco, Algiers, Tunis, and  Tripoli. I remember when I was a boy how easy it was to learn the names  of the capitals of those countries, for each one was the same as the  country itself.    The people of the Barbary States are only half civilized or barbarous,  but they have always had a mighty high opinion of themselves, though it  can hardly be as high to-day as it was a hundred years ago. They looked  upon the \"dogs of Christians\" as heathen nations, only fitted to be  their slaves, and it must be admitted that it was quite natural they  should hold the leading maritime nations of Europe as well as ourselves  in contempt, for all deserved it.    The favorite business of those barbarians was playing pirate. Their  corsairs roamed up and down the Mediterranean, eagerly hunting for  Christian merchant vessels, that they might kill the crews and divide  the plunder among themselves. Sometimes, by way of variety, they would  throw their captives into dungeons and then notify the governments to  which they belonged that they would be set free upon the payment of a  large sum of money to their captors. If the government did not choose to  pay the ransom, why their captors would give themselves the pleasure of  putting the prisoners to death.    Now, it would have been an easy thing for any one of the Christian  nations interested to send a fleet into the Mediterranean, which,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1726"],[0,"Theaetetus (#10)"],[1,"hrist. Of this  discovery, the first distinct assertion is contained in the thesis of  Protagoras. Probably he had no intention either of denying or affirming  an objective standard of truth. He did not consider whether man in the  higher or man in the lower sense was a 'measure of all things.' Like  other great thinkers, he was absorbed with one idea, and that idea was  the absoluteness of perception. Like Socrates, he seemed to see that  philosophy must be brought back from 'nature' to 'truth,' from the world  to man. But he did not stop to analyze whether he meant 'man' in the  concrete or man in the abstract, any man or some men, 'quod semper quod  ubique' or individual private judgment. Such an analysis lay beyond  his sphere of thought; the age before Socrates had not arrived at these  distinctions. Like the Cynics, again, he discarded knowledge in any  higher sense than perception. For 'truer' or 'wiser' he substituted  the word 'better,' and is not unwilling to admit that both states and  individuals are capable of practical improvement. But this improvement  does not arise from intellectual enlightenment, nor yet from  the exertion of the will, but from a change of circumstances and  impressions; and he who can effect this change in himself or others may  be deemed a philosopher. In the mode of effecting it, while agreeing  with Socrates and the Cynics in the importance which he attaches to  practical life, he is at variance with both of them. To suppose that  practice can be divorced from speculation, or that we may do good  without caring about truth, is by no means singular, either in  philosophy or life. The singularity of this, as of some other  (so-called) sophistical doctrines, is the frankness with which they are  avowed, instead of being veiled, as in modern times, under ambiguous and  convenient phrases.    Plato appears to treat Protagoras much as he himself is treated by  Aristotle; that is to say, he does not attempt to understand him from  his own point of view. But he entangles him in the meshes of a more  advanced logic. To which Protagoras is supposed to reply by Megarian  quibbles, which destroy logic, 'Not only man, but each man, and each  man at each moment.' In the arguments about sight and memory there is a  palpable unfairness which is worthy of the great 'brainless brothers,'  Euthydemus and Dionysodorus, and may be compared with the egkekalummenos  ('obvelatus') of Eubulides. For he who sees with one eye only cannot be  truly said both to see and not to see; nor is memory, which is liable  to forget, the immediate knowledge to which Protagoras applies the  term. Theodorus justly charges Socrates with going beyond the truth;  and Protagoras has equally right on his side when he protests against  Socrates arguing from the common use of words, which 'the vulgar pervert  in all manner of ways.'    III. The theory of Protagoras is connected by Aristotle as well as Plato  with the flux of Heracleitus. But Aristotle is only following Plato,  and Plato, as we have already seen, did not mean to imply that such a  connexion was admitted by Protagoras himself. His metaphysical genius  saw or seemed to see a common tendency in them, just as the modern  historian of ancient philosophy might perceive a parallelism between  two thinkers of which they were probably unconscious themselves. We must  remember throughout that Plato is not speaking of Heracleitus, but of  the Heracliteans, who succeeded him; nor of the great original ideas of  the master, but of the Eristic into which they had degenerated a hundred  years later. There is nothing in the fragments of Heracleitus which at  all justifies Plato's account of him. His philosophy may be resolved  into two elements--first, change, secondly, law or measure pervading  the change: these he saw everywhere, and often expressed in strange  mythological symbols. But he has no analysis of sensible perception such  as Plato attributes to him; nor is there any reason to suppose that  he pushed his philosophy into that absolute negation in which  Heracliteanism was sunk in the age of Plato. He never said that 'change  means every sort of change;' and he expressly distinguished between  'the general and particular understanding.' Like a poet, he surveyed  the elements of mythology, nature, thought, which lay before him, and  sometimes by the light of genius he saw or seemed to see a mysterious  principle working behind them. But as has been the case with other great  philosophers, and with Plato and Aristotle themselves, what was really  permanent and original could not be understood by the next generation,  while a perverted logic carried out his chance expressions with an  illogical consistency. His simple and noble thoughts, like those of the  great Eleatic, soon degenerated into a mere strife of words. And when  thus reduced to mere words, they seem to have exercised a far wider  influence in the cities of Ionia (where the people 'were mad about  them') than in the life-time of Heracleitus--a phenomenon which, though  at first sight singular, is not without a parallel in the history of  philosophy and theology.    It is this perverted form of the Heraclitean philosophy which is  supposed to effect the final overthrow of Protagorean sensationalism.  For if all things are changing at every moment, in all sorts of ways,  then there is nothing fixed or defined at all, and therefore no sensible  perception, nor any true word by which that or anything else can be  described. Of course Protagoras would not have admitted the justice  of this argument any more than Heracleitus would have acknowledged the  'uneducated fanatics' who appealed to his writings. He might have said,  'The excellent Socrates has first confused me with Heracleitus, and  Heracleitus with his Ephesian successors, and has then disproved the  existence both of knowledge and sensation. But I am not responsible  for what I never said, nor will I admit that my common-sense account of  knowledge can be overthrown by unintelligible Heraclitean paradoxes.'    IV. Still at the bottom of the arguments there remains a truth, that  knowledge is something more than sensible perception;--this alone would  not distinguish man from a tadpole. The absoluteness of sensations  at each moment destroys the very consciousness of sensations (compare  Phileb.), or the power of comparing them. The senses are not mere holes  in a 'Trojan horse,' but the organs of a presiding nature, in which they  meet. A great advance has been made in psychology when the senses  are recognized as organs of sense, and we are admitted to see or feel  'through them' and not 'by them,' a distinction of words which, as  Socrates observes, is by no means pedantic. A still further step has  been made when the most abstract notions, such as Being and Not-being,  sameness and difference, unity and plurality, are acknowledged to be the  creations of the mind herself, working upon the feelings or impressions  of sense. In this manner Plato describes the process of acquiring them,  in the words 'Knowledge consists not in the feelings or affections  (pathemasi), but in the process of reasoning about them (sullogismo).'  Here, is in the Parmenides, he means something not really different  from generalization. As in the Sophist, he is laying the foundation of a  rational psychology, which is to supersede the Platonic reminiscence of  Ideas as well as the Eleatic Being and the individualism of Megarians  and Cynics.    V. Having rejected the doctrine that 'Knowledge is perception,' we now  proceed to look for a definition of knowledge in the sphere of opinion.  But here we are met by a singular difficulty: How is false opinion  possible? For we must either know or not know that which is presented  to the mind or to sense. We of course should answer at once: 'No; the  alternative is not necessary, for there may be degrees of knowledge; and  we may know and have forgotten, or we may be learning, or we may have a  general but not a particular knowledge, or we may know but not be able  to explain;' and many other ways may be imagined in which we know and do  not know at the same time. But these answers belong to a later stage of  metaphysical discussion; whereas the difficulty in question naturally  arises owing to the childhood of the human mind, like the parallel  difficulty respecting Not-being. Men had only recently arrived at the  notion of opinion; they could not at once define the true and pass  beyond into the false. The very word doxa was full of ambiguity, being  sometimes, as in the Eleatic philosophy, applied to the sensible world,  and again used in the more ordinary sense of opinion. There is no  connexion between sensible appearance and probability, and yet both  of them met in the word doxa, and could hardly be disengaged from one  another in the mind of the Greek living in the fifth or fourth century  B.C. To this was often added, as at the end of the fifth book of the  Republic, the idea of relation, which is equally distinct from either of  them; also a fourth notion, the conclusion of the dialectical process,  the making up of the mind after she has been 'talking to herself'  (Theat.).    We are not then surprised that the sphere of opinion and of Not-being  should be a dusky, half-lighted place (Republic), belonging neither  to the old world of sense and imagination, nor to the new world of  reflection and reason. Plato attempts to clear up this darkness. In  his accustomed manner he passes from the lower to the higher, without  omitting the intermediate stages. This appears to be the reason why he  seeks for the definition of knowledge first in the sphere of opinion.  Hereafter we shall find that something more than opinion is required.    False opinion is explained by Plato at first as a confusion of mind and  sense, which arises when the impression on the mind does not correspond  to the impression made on the senses."]]]
