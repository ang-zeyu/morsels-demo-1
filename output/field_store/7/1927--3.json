Have ready a cupful of very hot cream sauce, made by blending a  tablespoonful each of flour and butter, and when melted adding a scant  cup of hot milk. Stir until smooth and thickened. Add the cheese to this  sauce, also the yolks of two eggs diluted with a little cream. Stir the  whole and let it remain on the stove a moment until the cheese gets  \"steady.\" Season with salt, red and white pepper, and just a grating of  nutmeg. Put this mixture on the ice until cold, then form into small  croquettes and roll in fine bread or cracker crumbs. Dip in beaten egg,  then again roll in the crumbs, drop into boiling fat and cook to a  golden brown.      ~CHICKEN AND PIMENTO SANDWICHES~--Add to finely minced chicken, roasted  or boiled, an equal amount of pimentos. Moisten with mayonnaise and  spread between wafer thin slices of white or brown bread. A leaf of  lettuce may also be added.      ~CRESS SANDWICHES~--Take thin slices of rare roast beef and cut into  small pieces. Add an equal quantity of minced watercress dressed with a  teaspoonful of grated horseradish, a little salt and paprika to season,  and enough softened butter or thick cream to moisten. Blend the  ingredients well, and spread between thin slices of buttered graham or  whole wheat bread. Cut in neat triangles, but do not reject the crust.      ~BANANA SANDWICHES~--Remove the skin and fibers from four bananas, cut  them in quarters and force through a ricer. Mix with the pulp the juice  of half a lemon, a dash of salt and nutmeg and set it away to become  very cold while you prepare the bread. This should be cut in very thin  slices, freed from crusts and trimmed into any preferred shape. Slightly  sweeten some thick cream and add a speck of salt. Spread the bread with  a thin layer of the cream, then with the banana pulp put together and  wrap each in waxed paper, twist the ends, and keep very cold until  serving time.      ~GERMAN RYE BREAD SANDWICHES~--Put between buttered slices of rye bread  chopped beef, cheese or chicken, and cover with finely chopped pickle,  dill or the plain sour pickle. Another variation of the German sandwich  is a layer of bologna sausage, then a thin layer of pumpernickel covered  with another thin slice of rye bread. Cut into strips half an inch wide  and the length of the slice.      ~GRILLED SARDINES ON TOAST~--Drain the sardines and cook in a buttered  frying-pan or chafing dish until heated, turning frequently. Place on  oblong pieces of hot buttered toast, and serve.      ~HAM SANDWICHES~--Chop two cups of ham, using a little fat with the  lean. Mix one tablespoon of flour with enough cold water to make smooth,  add one-half cup of boiling water, and cook five minutes; then add the  ham and one teaspoon of dry mustard. Mix well and press into a bowl or  jar.    ~JAPANESE SANDWICHES~--These are made of any kind of left-over fish,  baked, broiled or boiled. Pick out every bit of skin and bone, and flake  in small pieces. Put into a saucepan with just a little milk or cream to  moisten, add a little butter and a dusting of salt and pepper. Work to a  paste while heating, then cool and spread on thin slices of buttered  bread.      ~KEDGEREE~--For this take equal quantities of boiled fish and boiled  rice. For a cupful each use two hard boiled eggs, a teaspoonful curry  powder, two tablespoonfuls butter, a half tablespoonful cream, and  salt, white pepper and cayenne to season. Take all the skin and bone  from the fish and put in a saucepan with the butter. Add the rice and  whites of the boiled eggs cut fine, the cream, curry powder and cayenne.  Toss over the fire until very hot, then take up and pile on a hot dish.  Rub the yolks of the boiled eggs through a sieve on top of the curry,  and serve.      ~SANDWICH FILLINGS~--Other timely and appetizing fillings are green  pepper and cucumber chopped fine and squeezed dry, then seasoned with  mayonnaise, any of the potted and deviled meats seasoned with chopped  parsley or cress with a teaspoonful creamed butter to make it spread,  cheese and chopped spinach moistened with lemon juice and mayonnaise,  veal chopped fine with celery or cress and mayonnaise, Camembert cheese  heated slightly, just enough to spread, a Boston rarebit made with cream  and egg left over scrambled eggs and cress, roast chicken and chopped  dill pickles, cheese and chopped dates or figs, orange marmalade, and  sardines pounded to a paste with a few drops of lemon juice added.      ~SANDWICHES FROM COLD MUTTON~--Chop very fine, and to each pint add a  tablespoonful of capers, a teaspoonful each chopped mint and salt, a  dash of pepper, and a teaspoonful lemon juice. Spread thickly on  buttered slices of whole wheat bread, cover with other slices of  buttered bread, and cut in triangles.      ~TONGUE CANAPES~--Cut bread into rounds, toast delicately, spread with  potted tongue. In the centre put a stuffed olive and surround with a row  of chopped beet and another of chopped white of egg.      ~CORN TOAST~--Toast some slices of stale bread and butter, then pour  over some canned corn, prepared as for the table, sprinkling a little  pepper over it. If you have not already done so. Do not prepare so long  before serving as to soak the bread too much. Peas are also good used  the same way.      ~TONGUE TOAST~--Mince boiled smoked tongue very fine, heat cream to the  boiling point and make thick with the tongue. Season to taste with  pepper, nutmeg, parsley or chopped green peppers and when hot stir in a  beaten egg and remove from the fire at once. Have ready as many slices  as are required, spread with the creamed tongue and serve at once. If  you have no cream make a cream sauce, using a tablespoonful each of  butter and flour and a cup of milk.      ~LUNCHEON SURPRISE~--Line buttered muffin cups with hot boiled rice  about half an inch thick. Fill the centers with minced cooked chicken  seasoned with salt and pepper and a little broth or gravy. Cover the  tops with rice and bake in a moderate oven for fifteen minutes. Unmold  on a warm platter and serve with a cream sauce seasoned with celery  salt. If liked, two or three oysters may be added to the filling in each  cup.      ~SARDINE RAREBIT~--One level tablespoon butter, one-fourth level  teaspoon salt, one-fourth level teaspoon paprika, one level teaspoon  mustard, one cup thin cream or milk, one cup grated cheese, one-fourth  pound can sardines, boned and minced, two eggs, toast or crackers. Melt  the butter, add the salt, paprika, mustard, cream and cheese and cook  over hot water, stirring until the cheese is melted. Then add the  sardines and eggs slightly beaten. When thick and smooth serve on toast  or crackers.      ~BANANA CROQUETTES~--Remove skins and scrape bananas. Sprinkle with  powdered sugar and moisten with lemon juice. Let stand twenty minutes;  cut in halves crosswise. Dip in egg, then in fine cracker crumbs and fry  in deep fat. When done drain on brown paper. Serve with lemon sauce.      ~BACON AND GREEN PEPPERS~--Select firm green peppers, cut into rings,  removing all the seeds. Soak for twenty minutes in salted ice water.  Drain and dry and fry in the pan in which the bacon has cooked crisp.  Keep the bacon hot meanwhile. When the peppers are tender heap them up  in the center of a small platter and arrange the slices of bacon around  them.      ~CHEESE RAMEKINS~--Use two rounding tablespoons of grated cheese, a  rounding tablespoon of butter, one-quarter cup of fine breadcrumbs, the  same of milk, and a saltspoon each of mustard and salt, the yolk of one  egg. Cook the crumbs in the milk until soft, add the stiffly beaten  white of the egg. Fill china ramekins two-thirds full and bake five  minutes. Serve immediately.      ~CHEESE TIMBALES~--Crumble into timbale cups, alternate layers of bread  and American cheese. Pour over them a mixture of eggs, milk, salt,  pepper and mustard, allowing one egg and a tablespoonful of milk to each  timbale. Cook in the oven or on top of the stove in a shallow pan of hot  water, kept covered.      ~FRIED BANANAS~--Peel some bananas and cut in halves crosswise, roll in  flour and fry in deep hot fat. Set on end and pour a hot lemon sauce  around them.      ~MINCED CABBAGE~--Wash a cabbage and lay in cold water for half an hour.  With a sharp knife cut it into strips or shreds, an inch long, then drop  them into iced water. Beat a pint of cream very stiff. Drain the  cabbage, sprinkle lightly with salt, and stir it into the whipped cream,  turning and tossing until it is thoroughly coated with the white foam.  The cabbage should be tender and crisp for this dish.      ~NUT HASH~--Chop fine cold boiled potatoes and any other vegetables  desired that happen to be on hand. Put them into a buttered frying-pan  and heat quickly and thoroughly, salt to taste, then just before serving  stir in lightly a large spoonful of nut meal for each person to be  served.      ~PEANUT MEATOSE~--Dissolve one cup of cornstarch in two cups of tomato  juice, add two cups of peanut butter and two teaspoons of salt. Stir for  five minutes, then pour into cans and steam for four or five hours.      ~REMNANTS OF HAM WITH PEAS~--Cut the ham into small cubes, measure and add  an equal quantity of peas. In using canned peas rinse them well with  cold water and drain. Mix the peas and ham and for one and one-half cups  add a cup of white sauce seasoned with a teaspoon of lemon juice, a dash  each of nutmeg and cayenne and salt to taste. Mix well and add one egg  well beaten. Turn into a buttered baking dish, cover with buttered  breadcrumbs and bake in a hot oven until well browned.      ~SCOTCH SNIPE~--Four slices bread buttered, one-half box sardines  (one-half pound size), five drops of onion juice, six drops lemon juice,  few grains salt, two level teaspoons grated cheese, one tablespoon thick  cream. Remove the skins and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18440"],[0,"Logic: Deductive and Inductive (#10)"],[1," civic organisation), the term denoting them as a whole is Singular; but  'the world' or 'town of Nottingham,' meaning the inhabitants only, is  Collective.    In their strictly collective use, all such expressions are equivalent to  singular terms; but many of them may also be used as general terms, as  when we speak of 'so many regiments of the line,' or discuss the  'plurality of worlds'; and in this general use they denote any of a  multitude of things of the same kind--regiments, or habitable worlds.    Names of substances, such as 'gold,' 'air,' 'water,' may be employed as  singular, collective, or general terms; though, perhaps, as singular  terms only figuratively, as when we say _Gold is king_. If we say with  Thales, '_Water is the source of all things_,' 'water' seems to be used  collectively. But substantive names are frequently used as general  terms. For example, _Gold is heavy_ means 'in comparison with other  things,' such as water. And, plainly, it does not mean that the  aggregate of gold is heavier than the aggregate of water, but only that  its specific gravity is greater; that is, bulk for bulk, any piece of  gold is heavier than water.    Finally, any class-name may be used collectively if we wish to assert  something of the things denoted by it, not distributively but  altogether, as that _Sheep are more numerous than wolves_.          CHAPTER IV    THE CONNOTATION OF TERMS      Sec. 1. Terms are next to be classified according to their  Connotation--that is, according to what they imply as characteristic of  the things denoted. We have seen that general names are used to denote  many things in the same sense, because the things denoted resemble one  another in certain ways: it is this resemblance in certain points that  leads us to class the things together and call them by the same name;  and therefore the points of resemblance constitute the sense or meaning  of the name, or its Connotation, and limit its applicability to such  things as have these characteristic qualities. 'Sheep' for example, is  used in the same sense, to denote any of a multitude of animals that  resemble one another: their size, shape, woolly coats, cloven hoofs,  innocent ways and edibility are well known. When we apply to anything  the term 'sheep,' we imply that it has these qualities: 'sheep,'  denoting the animal, connotes its possessing these characteristics; and,  of course, it cannot, without a figure of speech or a blunder, be used  to denote anything that does not possess all these qualities. It is by a  figure of speech that the term 'sheep' is applied to some men; and to  apply it to goats would be a blunder.    Most people are very imperfectly aware of the connotation of the words  they use, and are guided in using them merely by the custom of the  language. A man who employs a word quite correctly may be sadly posed by  a request to explain or define it. Moreover, so far as we are aware of  the connotation of terms, the number and the kind of attributes we  think of, in any given case, vary with the depth of our interest, and  with the nature of our interest in the things denoted. 'Sheep' has one  meaning to a touring townsman, a much fuller one to a farmer, and yet a  different one to a zoologist. But this does not prevent them agreeing in  the use of the word, as long as the qualities they severally include in  its meaning are not incompatible.    All general names, and therefore not only class-names, like 'sheep,' but  all attributives, have some connotation. 'Woolly' denotes anything that  bears wool, and connotes the fact of bearing wool; 'innocent' denotes  anything that habitually and by its disposition does no harm (or has not  been guilty of a particular offence), and connotes a harmless character  (or freedom from particular guilt); 'edible' denotes whatever can be  eaten with good results, and connotes its suitability for mastication,  deglutition, digestion, and assimilation.    Sec. 2. But whether all terms must connote as well as denote something, has  been much debated. Proper names, according to what seems the better  opinion, are, in their ordinary use, not connotative. To say that they  have no meaning may seem violent: if any one is called John Doe, this  name, no doubt, means a great deal to his friends and neighbours,  reminding them of his stature and physiognomy, his air and gait, his wit  and wisdom, some queer stories, and an indefinite number of other  things. But all this significance is local or accidental; it only exists  for those who know the individual or have heard him described: whereas a  general name gives information about any thing or person it denotes to  everybody who understands the language, without any particular knowledge  of the individual.    We must distinguish, in fact, between the peculiar associations of the  proper name and the commonly recognised meaning of the general name.  This is why proper names are not in the dictionary. Such a name as  London, to be sure, or Napoleon Buonaparte, has a significance not  merely local; still, it is accidental. These names are borne by other  places and persons than those that have rendered them famous. There are  Londons in various latitudes, and, no doubt, many Napoleon Buonapartes  in Louisiana; and each name has in its several denotations an altogether  different suggestiveness. For its suggestiveness is in each application  determined by the peculiarities of the place or person denoted; it is  not given to the different places (or to the different persons) because  they have certain characteristics in common.    However, the scientific grounds of the doctrine that proper names are  non-connotative, are these: The peculiarities that distinguish an  individual person or thing are admitted to be infinite, and anything  less than a complete enumeration of these peculiarities may fail to  distinguish and identify the individual. For, short of a complete  enumeration of them, the description may be satisfied by two or more  individuals; and in that case the term denoting them, if limited by such  a description, is not a proper but a general name, since it is  applicable to two or more in the same sense. The existence of other  individuals to whom it applies may be highly improbable; but, if it be  logically possible, that is enough. On the other hand, the enumeration  of infinite peculiarities is certainly impossible. Therefore proper  names have no assignable connotation. The only escape from this  reasoning lies in falling back upon time and place, the principles of  individuation, as constituting the connotation of proper names. Two  things cannot be at the same time in the same place: hence 'the man who  was at a certain spot on the bridge of Lodi at a certain instant in a  certain year' suffices to identify Napoleon Buonaparte for that instant.  Supposing no one else to have borne the name, then, is this its  connotation? No one has ever thought so. And, at any rate, time and  place are only extrinsic determinations (suitable indeed to events like  the battle of Lodi, or to places themselves like London); whereas the  connotation of a general term, such as 'sheep,' consists of intrinsic  qualities. Hence, then, the scholastic doctrine 'that individuals have  no essence' (see chap. xxii. Sec. 9), and Hamilton's dictum 'that every  concept is inadequate to to the individual,' are justified.    General names, when used as proper names, lose their connotation, as  Euxine or Newfoundland.    Singular terms, other than Proper, have connotation; either in  themselves, like the singular pronouns 'he,' 'she,' 'it,' which are  general in their applicability, though singular in application; or,  derivatively, from the general names that combine to form them, as in  'the first Emperor of the French' or the 'Capital of the British  Empire.'    Sec. 3. Whether Abstract Terms have any connotation is another disputed  question. We have seen that they denote a quality or qualities of  something, and that is precisely what general terms connote: 'honesty'  denotes a quality of some men; 'honest' connotes the same quality,  whilst denoting the men who have it.    The denotation of abstract terms thus seems to exhaust their force or  meaning. It has been proposed, however, to regard them as connoting the  qualities they directly stand for, and not denoting anything; but surely  this is too violent. To denote something is the same as to be the name  of something (whether real or unreal), which every term must be. It is a  better proposal to regard their denotation and connotation as  coinciding; though open to the objection that 'connote' means 'to mark  along with' something else, and this plan leaves nothing else. Mill  thought that abstract terms are connotative when, besides denoting a  quality, they suggest a quality of that quality (as 'fault' implies  'hurtfulness'); but against this it may be urged that one quality cannot  bear another, since every qualification of a quality constitutes a  distinct quality in the total ('milk-whiteness' is distinct from  'whiteness,' _cf._ chap. iii. Sec. 4). After all, if it is the most  consistent plan, why not say that abstract, like proper, terms have no  connotation?    But if abstract terms must be made to connote something, should it not  be those things, indefinitely suggested, to which the qualities belong?  Thus 'whiteness' may be considered to connote either snow or vapour, or  any white thing, apart from one or other of which the quality has no  existence; whose existence therefore it implies. By this course the  denotation and connotation of abstract and of general names would be  exactly reversed. Whilst the denotation of a general name is limited by  the qualities connoted, the connotation of an abstract name includes all  the things in which its denotation is realised. But the whole difficulty  may be avoided by making it a rule to translate, for logical purposes,  all"]]]
