When she had been in Calcutta she had not addressed  Kamal by any name; indeed she had rarely spoken; but seeing that Kamal  was very loving-hearted, she had become fond of her. In the years that  had intervened without a meeting she had a little forgotten Kamal;  but now, both being amiable, their affection was born afresh, and  became very close.    When Kamal Mani talked of returning home, Surja Mukhi said, \"Nay,  sister, stay a little longer. I shall be wretched when you are gone.  It relieves me to talk to you of my trouble.\"    \"I shall not go without arranging your affairs.\"    \"What affairs?\" said Surja Mukhi.    \"Your _Shradda_\" (funeral ceremonies), replied Kamal; but mentally she  said, \"Extracting the thorns from your path.\"    When Kunda heard that Kamal talked of going, she went to her room and  wept. Kamal going quietly after her found her with her head on the  pillow, weeping. Kamal sat down to dress Kunda's hair, an occupation  of which she was very fond. When she had finished she drew Kunda's  head on to her lap, and wiped away the tears. Then she said, \"Kunda,  why do you weep?\"    \"Why do you go away?\" was the reply.    \"Why should you weep for that?\"    \"Because you love me.\"    \"Does no one else love you?\"    Kunda did not reply; and Kamal went on: \"Does not the _Bou_ (Surja  Mukhi) love you? No? Don't hide it from me.\" (Still no answer.) \"Does  not my brother love you?\" (Still silence.) \"Since I love you and you  love me, shall we not go together?\" (Yet Kunda spoke not.) \"Will you  go?\"    Kunda shook her head, saying, \"I will not go.\"    Kamal's joyous face became grave; she thought, \"This does not sound  well. The girl has the same complaint as my brother, but he suffers  the more deeply. My husband is not here, with whom can I take  counsel?\" Then Kamal Mani drew Kunda's head lovingly on her breast,  and taking hold of her face caressingly, said, \"Kunda, will you tell  me the truth?\"    \"About what?\" said the girl.    \"About what I shall ask thee. I am thy elder, I love thee as a sister;  do not hide it from me, I will tell no one.\" In her mind she thought,  \"If I tell any one it will be my husband and my baby.\"    After a pause Kunda asked, \"What shall I tell you?\"    \"You love my brother dearly, don't you?\"    Kunda gave no answer.    Kamal Mani wept in her heart; aloud she said: \"I understand. It is so.  Well that does not hurt you, but many others suffer from it.\"    Kunda Nandini, raising her head, fixed a steadfast look on the face of  Kamal Mani.    Kamal, understanding the silent question, replied, \"Ah, unhappy one!  dost thou not see that my brother loves thee?\"    Kunda's head again sank on Kamal's breast, which she watered with her  tears. Both wept silently for many minutes.    What the passion of love is the golden Kamal Mani knew very well. In  her innermost heart she sympathized with Kunda, both in her joy and in  her sorrow. Wiping Kunda's eyes she said again, \"Kunda, will you go  with me?\"    Kunda's eyes again tilled with tears.    More earnestly, Kamal said: \"If you are out of sight my brother will  forget you, and you will forget him; otherwise, you will be lost, my  brother will be lost and his wife--the house will go to ruin.\"    Kunda continued weeping.    Again Kamal asked, \"Will you go? Only consider my brother's condition,  his wife's.\"    Kunda, after a long interval, wiped her eyes, sat up, and said, \"I  will go.\"    Why this consent after so long an interval? Kamal understood that  Kunda had offered up her own life on the temple of the household  peace. Her own peace? Kamal felt that Kunda did not comprehend what  was for her own peace.          CHAPTER XII.    HIRA.      On this occasion, Haridasi _Boisnavi_ entering, sang--        \"I went into the thorny forest to pluck a soiled flower--      Yes, my friend, a soiled flower;      I wore it twined about my head, I hung it in my ears--      Friends, a soiled flower.\"    This day Surja Mukhi was present. She sent to call Kamal to hear the  singing. Kamal came, bringing Kunda Nandini with her. The _Boisnavi_  sang--        \"I would die for this blooming thorn,      I will steal its honied sweets,      I go to seek where it doth bloom,      This fresh young bud.\"    Kamal Mani frowned, and said: \"_Boisnavi_ Didi, may ashes be thrown  on your face! Can you not sing something else?\"    Haridasi asked, \"Why?\"    Kamal, more angrily, said: \"Why? Bring a bough of the _babla_ tree,  and show her how pleasant it is to be pierced by thorns.\"    Surja Mukhi said gently: \"We do not like songs of that sort; sing  something suitable for the home circle.\"    The _Boisnavi_, saying \"Very well,\" began to sing--        \"By clasping the Pandit's feet, I shall become learned in the Shastras;      Learning thus the holy Shastras, who will dare speak ill of me?\"    Kamal, frowning, said: \"Listen to this singing if it pleases you,  sister. I shall go away.\"    She went, and Surja Mukhi also left, with a displeased countenance. Of  the rest of the women, those who relished the song remained, the  others left; Kunda Nandini stayed. She did not understand the hidden  meaning of the songs, she scarcely even heard them. Her thoughts were  absent, so she remained where she was seated. Haridasi sang no more,  but talked on trivial subjects. Seeing that there would be no more  singing, all left except Kunda Nandini, whose feet seemed as though  they would not move. Thus, finding herself alone with Kunda, the  _Boisnavi_ talked much to her. Kunda heard something of her talk, but  not all.    Surja Mukhi saw all this from a distance, and when the two showed  signs of being deep in conversation she called Kamal and pointed them  out to her.    Kamal said: \"What of that? they are only talking. She is a woman, not  a man.\"    \"Who knows?\" said Surja. \"I think it is a man in disguise; but I will  soon find out. How wicked Kunda must be!\"    \"Stay a moment,\" said Kamal, \"I will fetch a _babla_ branch, and let  her feel its thorns.\"    Thus saying, Kamal went in search of a bough. On the way she saw  Satish, who had got possession of his aunt's vermilion, and was  seated, daubing neck, nose, chin, and breast with the red powder. At  this sight Kamal forgot the _Boisnavi,_ the bough, Kunda Nandini, and  everything else.    Surja Mukhi sent for the servant Hira.    Hira's name has been mentioned once; it is now needful to give a  particular account of her. Nagendra and his father always took special  care that the female servants of the household should be of good  character. With this design they offered good wages, and sought to  engage servants of a superior class. The women servants of the house  dwelt in happiness and esteem, therefore many respectable women of  small means took service with them. Amongst these Hira was the  principal. Many maid-servants are of the Kaystha caste. Hira was a  Kaystha. Her grandmother had first been engaged as a servant, and  Hira, being then a child, had come with her. When Hira became capable  the old woman gave up service, built herself a house out of her  savings, and dwelt in Govindpur. Hira entered the service of the Datta  family. She was then about twenty years of age, younger than most of  the other servants, but in intelligence and in mental qualities their  superior. Hira had been known in Govindpur from childhood as a widow,  but no one had ever heard anything of her husband, neither had any one  heard of any stain upon her character. She was something of a shrew.  She dressed and adorned herself as one whose husband is living. She  was beautiful, of brilliant complexion, lotus-eyed, short in stature,  her face like the moon covered with clouds, her hair raised in front  like a snake-hood.    Hira was sitting alone singing. She made quarrels among the maids for  her own amusement. She would frighten the cook in the dark, incite the  boys to tease their parents to give them in marriage; if she saw any  one sleeping she would paint the face with lime and ink. Truly she had  many faults, as will appear by degrees. At present I will only add  that if she saw attar or rose-water she would steal it.    Surja Mukhi, calling Hira, said, \"Do you know that _Boisnavi_?\"    \"No,\" replied Hira. \"I was never out of the neighbourhood, how should  I know a _Boisnavi_ beggar-man. Ask the women of the _Thakur bari_;  Karuna or Sitala may know her.\"    \"This is not a _Thakur bari Boisnavi_. I want to know who she is,  where her home is, and why she talks so much with Kunda. If you find  all this out for me I will give you a new Benares _sari_, and send you  to see the play.\"    At this offer Hira became very zealous, and asked, \"When may I go to  make inquiry?\"    \"When you like; but if you do not follow her now you will not be able  to trace her. Be careful that neither the _Boisnavi_ nor any one else  suspects you.\"    At this moment Kamal returned, and, approving of Surja Mukhi's design,  said to Hira, \"And if you can, prick her with _babla_ thorns.\"    Hira said: \"I will do all, but only a Benares _sari_ will not content  me.\"    \"What do you want?\" asked Surja.    \"She wants a husband,\" said Kamal. \"Give her in marriage.\"    \"Very well,\" said Surja. \"Would you like to have the _Thakur  Jamai_?[8] Say so, and Kamal will arrange it.\"    [Footnote 8: _Thakur Jamai_--Kamal Mani's husband.]    \"Then I will see,\" said Hira; \"but there is already in the house a  husband suited to my mind.\"    \"Who is it?\" asked Surja.    \"Death,\" was Hira's reply.          CHAPTER XIII.    NO!      On the evening of that day, Kunda was sitting near the _talao_[9] in  the middle of the garden. The _talao_ was broad; its water pure and  always blue. The reader will remember that behind this _talao_ was a  flower-garden, in the midst of which stood a white marble house  covered with creepers. In front, a flight of steps led down to the  water. The steps were built of brick to resemble stone,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17456"],[0,"The Romance of a Christmas Card (#10)"],[1,"might 'a' been here  as well as not an' got her handkerchief an' her card.

The blaze of the logs on his own family  hearth-stone, after many months of steam heaters in the hall bedrooms  of cheap hotels, how it soothed his tired heart and gave it visions of  happiness to come! The card was on his knee, where he could look from  its pictured scene to the real one of which he was again a glad and  grateful part.    \"Bless the card!\" whispered Letty Boynton to herself as she went to  her moonlit bedroom. Her eyes searched the snowy landscape and found  the parsonage, \"over the hills and far away.\" Then her heart flew like  a bird across the distance and beat its wings in gladness, for a faint  light streamed from the parson's study windows and she knew that  father and son were together. That, in itself, was enough, with David  sleeping under the home roof; but to-morrow was coming and to-morrow  might be hers--her very own!    \"Bless the card!\" said Reba Larrabee, the tears shining in her eyes as  she left the minister alone with his son. \"Bless everybody and  everything! Above all, bless God, 'from whom all blessings flow.'\"    \"Bless the card,\" said Dick Larrabee when he went up the narrow  parsonage stairs to the room of his boyhood and found everything as it  had been years ago. He leaned the little piece of paper magic against  the mantel clock, threw it a kiss, and then, opening his pocket-book,  he went nearer to the lamp and took out the faded tintype of a  brown-haired girl in a brown cape. \"Bless the card!\" he said again,  with a new note in his voice: \"Bless the girl! And bless to-morrow if  it brings me what I want most in all the world!\"    [Illustration]"]]]
