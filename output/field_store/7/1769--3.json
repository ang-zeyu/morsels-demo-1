Take a moderate mouthful and rassel with it until it is  automatically swallowed. Chew until it is all gone before you put any  more in your mouth. There is no better way of jollying yourself into  thinking that you have had all you want than this Fletcherizing habit,  and it takes the same time to consume one-half the amount of food you  have been in the habit of eating.    I will allow you all the water you want, in reason; in fact, I advise it  while you are reducing, both at the meals and between meals. The only  precaution is that at the meals it should not be drunk while food is in  the mouth, for this would tend to lessen thorough mastication.    Now, Madam and Madam's husband, when are you going to begin this  important business of reducing? After the holidays? Tomorrow? _No!  Right now._ The sooner you get started, the better. The chief thing to  do, and the hardest, is to get started and to get the habit. After the  first three days you will not dread it; in fact; you will feel so much  better that you will not be willing to go back to your old habits of  overeating.    Now let's review a bit what you are to do.    [Sidenote: _Plan the Day Before_]    First: Pledge yourself to yourself, and to someone else, so you will be  ashamed to fail. There is a great deal of psychology to reducing. Use  strong auto-suggestion. Decide just how much you are going to eat in  advance of the meal--so many calories, _no more!_ This sounds foolish,  but it helps wonderfully.    Second: Begin with a fast or a low caloric diet for the first day; keep  it, if necessary, one day weekly.    [Sidenote: _Low Bridge on Fats and Pastries_]    Third: Study food list and make out menus the caloric totals of which  _are less_ than your maintenance diet. Have a fairly balanced diet, some  fat, some carbohydrates, some protein, and a good amount of green  vegetables and fruit. _Have 200-300 C's of protein._    Fourth: Masticate every morsel with such thoroughness that it is  automatically swallowed.    Fifth: Keep up your activities--Red Cross and other relief work.    Sixth: Remember that you will feel good in your little heart when you  resist temptation to overeat, and when you don't, you won't feel good  anywhere.    Seventh: Some vigorous exercise every day.    [Sidenote: _There Is Life Substance and Intelligence in Chocolate  Creams!_]    NOTE: If there comes a time when you think you will die unless you have  some chocolate creams, go on a c.c. debauch. I do, occasionally, and  will eat as many as ten or so; but I take them before dinner, then me  for the balance of my dinner--         1 bowl of clear soup                       25 C.       1 cracker                                  25 C.                                                 ------       Total                                      50 C.    And thus, you see, every supposed pleasure in sin (eating) will furnish  more than its equivalent of pain (dieting) until belief in material life  (chocolate creams) is destroyed.      _Review_    1. Describe your stomach.    2. If there is one thing more important than another, what is it?    3. Repeat the five orders in chapter 8.    4. Repeat the warnings.    5. Work the following example:         X gains 25 pounds during the year.       How many calories has he averaged       daily over his maintenance diet?    KEY:           25 lbs. fat = 400 oz. fat.         1 oz. fat represents 275 C. food consumed.         400 oz. = 400 x 275, or 110,000 C.         110,000 / 365 = 301 C.       _Answer_. X has eaten 301 C. per day more           than necessary.    6. How many calories have you averaged daily over your maintenance diet?  And what could you have left off your menu and kept from gaining all  that weight?          10    Testimonials      [Sidenote: _From the Field_]    After you have reduced or gained, let me share your joys. Write me a  little note. You need not sign your name if you don't want to. I  anticipate the following:    DEAR DOCTOR:    I am so grateful to you, Dr. Lulu Hunt Peters, for what you have done  for me. After reading your book, \"Diet and Health, with Key to the  Calories\" my chronic case of meanness--I mean leanness--was absolutely  cured. My weight, which was ... now is ... and I am on my way to normal.  I am fond of you.           *       *       *       *       *    DEAREST DOCTOR:    I cannot be too grateful to you, dear Doctor Lulu Hunt Peters, for your  book \"Diet and Health, with Key to the Calories,\" for I have lost ...  pounds! My weight was ... and now is ... and I am on my way to normal.    I should be ungrateful indeed if I did not mention that while reading  the book a chronic case of dammdruff which I had had for years, and  which had been given up by six specialists, was absolutely cured. I  adore you!           *       *       *       *       *    [Sidenote: _A Wonderful Demonstration_]    DEAR DOCTOR:    For your book, \"Diet and Health, with Key to the Calories,\" words are  inadequate to express my thanks. For I have been delivered from a  chronic affliction of many years' duration, for which I had tried all  known methods of cure. I refer to the smoking of cheap cigars by my  husband. He suddenly found he had no desire for the noxious weed! Your  arm and leg exercises are wonderful.           *       *       *       *       *          11    An Apology and Some Amendments    On re-reading this literary gem, humorous classic, and scientific  treatise on weight reduction and gaining, I see that I have a very  intimate mixture of the thins and the fats. But that is as it should be  for balance. I had intended to keep you strictly separate, but the  preaching, the exercises, the dry definitions, the Key to the Calories,  and so forth, was matter that was applicable to both, so it could not be  done.    [Sidenote: _Watch Your Weight_]    I have just got to bring this to a close now, if I have it ready as I  promised, for the lecture, \"Watch Your Weight!\" I am glad of it, too. I  am getting so ... funny it is painful. I will close with the next  chapter. It will be beautifully scientific, but not funny, I promise.      _Some Amendments_    [Sidenote: _No. 1_]    You perhaps have noticed that my first chapter is called \"Preliminary  Bout,\" and then I have gone on to describe a club meeting. I am aware  that P.B. is a prize fighting term, and I meant it for the picture of me  fighting myself, not for the club meeting. I have attended many club  meetings, and in none of them have I ever seen any fighting that would  have taken any prize anywhere, although I will say I have seen and have  myself personally conducted some very classy stuff.    [Sidenote: _No. 2_]    I do not use slang. I use only the purest, most refined, and cultured  English. I leave slang to those who can get by with it and put it over.  So where I have used dashes you may use your favorite slang words. Mine  were deleted by the censors.    [Sidenote: _No. 3 (a)_]    Mrs. Ima Gobbler is not really fat enough to be called a fat--! She is  only 40 or 50 pounds overweight, but she is fond of me and I took  liberties with her. She is a darling.    [Sidenote: _No. 3 (b)_]    She is a purist, too. I called her up after I put her in my book, and I  said, \"You are fond of me, aren't you, Mrs. Gobbler?\" And she said,  \"Youbetcha.\" \"And you are a good sport, aren't you?\" \"Surest thing you  know!\" \"That's good, for I have said a horrid thing to you. I had to,  in order to stop the club discussion.\" And she responded soulfully, \"Go  to it, Kid!\"    [Sidenote: _No. 4_]    Mrs. Sheesasite's husband did not really have to buy her a pair of  freight scales; that is just a gentle josh. The ordinary scales will  weigh 300 pounds, I believe. She is also a dear.    [Sidenote: _No. 5_]    My husband's eyes are not really green, nor is he cross-eyed. They are  the loveliest, softest brown. The green eyes belong on the maternal side  of this house.    [Sidenote: _No. 6_]    My artist is not really noted. He is just an ordinary adorable  ten-year-old boy kiddie. Aren't his little figures the dearest ever?           *       *       *       *       *    [Sidenote: _Doing My Bit_]    All the characters in my book are friends of mine. Perhaps you had  better substitute _were_ for _are_. There was one woman mentioned in my  original manuscript and my husband said what have you put her in for  Pattie? (a corruption of Pettie, a H.moon hangover) she is no friend of  yours: she knocks you. And I said loftily like, I want you to know Ijit  (corruption of Idiot, also a H.moon hangover) I am above personalities  she is prominent and besides she is fat especially in the feet and head  and she doesn't know it and he said that doesn't make any difference you  do not have to immortalize her and I said I would look up the  authorities on the subject and he said he was authority enough and I  said I would see what the other authorities said anyway and I did and I  found one most eminent that said you should love your enemies but none  that said you should immortalize them so I said I'd drop her and he said  he should say so and so I did.    [Illustration: Dear Enemy Unimmortalised]    --All the characters in my book are friends of mine. Perhaps you had  better substitute _were_ for _are_.          12    Maintenance Diet and Conclusions    [Illustration: Maintenance Diet 1000 C. over 1000 C. under]    [Sidenote: _1st Circle_]    THE HEAVY circle represents the amount of daily food (number of  calories) which will maintain you at present weight. It may be your  weight is too much or too little, but this is your maintenance diet for  that weight.    [Sidenote: _2nd Circle_]    THE SECOND circle represents a daily diet containing more than necessary  for maintenance; for example, let us say 1000 calories more. This 1000  calories of food is equivalent to approximately 4 ounces of fat  [1"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15097"],[0,"A Grammar of the English Tongue (#10)"],[1," thence the origin of any thing:      and to spring, to germinate, and spring, one of the four seasons. From      the same spr and out, is formed sprout, and wit the termination ig,      sprig; of which the following, for the most part, is the difference:      sprout, of a grosser sound, imports a fatter or grosser bud; sprig, of      a slenderer sound, denotes a smaller shoot. In like manner, from str of      the verb strive, and out, comes strout, and strut. From the same str,      and the termination uggle, is made struggle; and this gl imports, but      without any great noise, by reason of the obscure sound of the vowel u.      In like manner, from throw and roll is made troll, and almost in the      same sense is trundle, from throw or thrust, and rundle. Thus graff or      grough is compounded of grave and rough; and trudge from tread or trot,      and drudge.    In these observations it is easy to discover great sagacity and great  extravagance, an ability to do much defeated by the desire of doing more  than enough. It may be remarked,    1. That Wallis's derivations are often so made, that by the same license  any language may be deduced from any other.    2. That he makes no distinction between words immediately derived by us  from the Latin, and those which being copied from other languages, can  therefore afford no example of the genius of the English language, or its  laws of derivation.    3. That he derives from the Latin, often with great harshness and violence,  words apparently Teutonick; and therefore, according to his own  declaration, probably older than the tongue to which he refers them.    4. That some of his derivations are apparently erroneous.           *       *       *       *       *    SYNTAX.        The established practice of grammarians requires that I should here      treat of the Syntax; but our language has so little inflection, or      variety of terminations, that its construction neither requires nor      admits many rules. Wallis, therefore, has totally neglected it; and      Jonson, whose desire of following the writers upon the learned      languages made him think a syntax indispensably necessary, has      published such petty observations as were better omitted.    The verb, as in other languages, agrees with the nominative in number and  person; as, Thou fliest from good; He runs to death.    Our adjectives and pronouns are invariable.    Of two substantives the noun possessive is in the genitive; as, His  father's glory; The sun's heat.    Verbs transitive require an oblique case; as, He loves me; You fear him.    All prepositions require an oblique case: as, He gave this to me; He took  this from me; He says this of me; He came with me.           *       *       *       *       *    PROSODY.        It is common for those that deliver the grammar of modern languages, to      omit the Prosody. So that of the Italians is neglected by Buomattei;      that of the French by Desmarais; aad that of the English by Wallis,      Cooper, and even by Jonson, though a poet. But as the laws of metre are      included in the idea of grammar, I have thought proper to insert them.    PROSODY comprises orthoepy, or the rules of pronunciation; and orthometry,  or the laws of versification.    Pronunciation is just, when every letter has its proper sound, and every  syllable has its proper accent, or, which in English versification is the  same, its proper quantity.        The sounds of the letters have been already explained; and rules for      the accent or quantity are not easily to be given, being subject to      innumerable exceptions. Such, however, as I have read or formed, I      shall here propose.    1. Of dissyllables, formed by affixing a termination, the former syllable  is commonly accented, as childish, kingdom, actest, acted, toilsome, lover,  scoffer, fairer, foremost, zealous, fulness, godly, meekly, artist.    2. Dissyllables formed by prefixing a syllable to the radical word, have  commonly the accent on the latter; as to beget, to beseem, to bestow.    3. Of dissyllables, which are at once nouns and verbs, the verb has  commonly the accent on the latter, and the noun on the former syllable; as,  to descant, a descant; to cement, a cement; to contract, a contract.        This rule has many exceptions. Though verbs seldom have their accent on      the former, yet nouns often have it on the latter syllable; as delight,      perfume.    4. All dissyllables ending in y, as cranny; in our, as labour, favour; in  ow, as willow, wallow, except allow; in le, as battle, bible; in ish, as  banish; in ck, as cambrick, cassock; in ter, as to batter; in age, as  courage, in en, as fasten; in et, as quiet; accent the former syllable.    5. Dissyllable nouns in er, as canker, butter, have the accent on the  former syllable.    6. Dissyllable verbs terminating in a consonant and e final, as comprise,  escape; or having a diphthong in the last syllable, as appease, reveal; or  ending in two consonants, as attend; have the accent on the latter  syllable.    7. Dissyllable nouns having a diphthong in the latter syllable, have  commonly their accent on the latter syllable, as applause; except words in  ain, certain, mountain.    8. Trissyllables formed by adding a termination, or prefixing a syllable,  retain the accent of the radical word; as, loveliness, tenderness,  contemner, wagonner, physical, bespatter, commenting, commending,  assurance.    9. Trissyllables ending in ous, as gracious, arduous; in al, as capital; in  ion, as mention; accent the first.    10. Trissyllables ending in ce, ent, and ate, accent the first syllable, as  countenance, continence, armament, imminent, elegant, propagate, except  they be derived from words having the accent on the last, as connivance,  acquaintance; or the middle syllable hath a vowel before two consonants, as  promulgate.    11. Trissyllables ending in y, as entity, specify, liberty, victory,  subsidy, commonly accent the first syllable.    12. Trissyllables in re or le accent the first syllable, as legible,  theatre, except disciple, and some words which have a position, as example,  epistle.    13. Trissyllables in ude commonly accent the first syllable, as plenitude.    14. Trissyllables ending in ator or atour, as creatour; or having in the  middle syllable a diphthong, as endeavour; or a vowel before two  consonants, as domestick; accent the middle syllable.    15. Trissyllables that have their accent on the last syllable are commonly  French, as acquiesce, repartee, magazine, or words formed by prefixing one  or two syllables to an acute syllable, as immature, overcharge.    16. Polysyllables, or words of more than three syllables, follow the accent  of the words from which they are derived, as arrogating, continency,  incontinently, commendable, communicableness. We should therefore say  disputable, indisputable; rather than disputable, indisputable; and  advertisement, rather than advertisement.    17. Words in ion have the accent upon the antepenult, as salvation,  perturbation, concoction; words in atour or ator on the penult, as  dedicator.    18. Words ending in le commonly have the accent on the first syllable, as  amicable, unless the second syllable have a vowel before two consonants, as  combustible.    19. Words ending in ous have the accents on the antepenult, as uxorious,  voluptuous.    20. Words ending in ty have their accent on the antepenult, as  pusillanimity, activity.        These rules are not advanced as complete or infallible, but proposed as      useful. Almost every rule of every language has its exceptions; and in      English, as in other tongues, much must be learned by example and      authority. Perhaps more and better rules may be given that have escaped      my observation.    VERSIFICATION is the arrangement of a certain number of syllables according  to certain laws.    The feet of our verses are either iambick, as aloft, create; or trochaick,  as holy, lofty.    Our iambick measure comprises verses    Of four syllables,      Most good, most fair,    Or things as rare,    To call you's lost;    For all the cost    Words can bestow,    So poorly show    Upon your praise,    That all the ways    Sense hath, come short.       Drayton.      With ravish'd ears    The monarch hears.       Dryden.    Of six,      This while we are abroad,      Shall we not touch our lyre?    Shall we not sing an ode?      Or shall that holy fire,    In us that strongly glow'd,      In this cold air expire?      Though in the utmost peak,      A while we do remain,    Amongst the mountains bleak,      Expos'd to sleet and rain,    No sport our hours shall break,      To exercise our vein.      What though bright Phoebus' beams      Refresh the southern ground,    And though the princely Thames      With beauteous nymphs abound,    And by old Camber's streams      Be many wonders found:      Yet many rivers clear      Here glide in silver swathes,    And what of all most dear,      Buxton's delicious baths,    Strong ale and noble chear,      T' asswage breem winters scathes.      In places far or near,      Or famous, or obscure,    Where wholsom is the air,      Or where the most impure,    All times, and every where,      The muse is still in ure.       Drayton.    Of eight, which is the usual measure for short poems,      And may at last my weary age    Find out the peaceful hermitage,    The hairy gown, and mossy cell,    Where I may sit, and nightly spell    Of ev'ry star the sky doth shew,    And ev'ry herb that sips the dew.       Milton.    Of ten, which is the common measure of heroick and tragick poetry,      Full in the midst of this created space,    Betwixt heav'n, earth, and skies, there stands a place    Confining on all three; with triple bound;    Whence all things, though remote, are view'd around,    And thither bring their undulating sound.
