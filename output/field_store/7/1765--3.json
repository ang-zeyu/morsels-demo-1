At first the shoe seems to have been cut off at the  heel end, but as apparently after being on for some time, bruises were  noticed, the shoe was made longer at the heel, and this part was  turned up so as to prevent them from becoming loose too soon, as both  the Spanish horseshoes of this period show, and the acquisition was  even later transferred to England (Fig. 7).    [Illustration: FIG. 5.]    The shoe containing a groove (Fig. 6), which we shall see later, made  its appearance in Germany in the fifteenth century. From this time,  according to our present knowledge, ceases the period of the Roman  horseshoe. Its influence, however, lasted a great deal longer, and has  even remained until our present day.    [Illustration: FIG. 6.]    Its successor became partly the Arabo-Turkomanic and partly the  Southwest European horseshoe.    For the descendants of the Numidian light cavalry, the Roman and old  Spanish horseshoe was evidently too heavy for their sandy, roadless  deserts, so they made it thinner and omitted the bent-up rim, because  it prevented the quick movement of the horse. For the protection of  the nail heads the outer margin of the shoe was staved, so as to form  a small rim on the outer surface of the shoe, thus preventing the nail  heads from being worn and the shoe lost too soon.    [Illustration: FIG. 7.]    [Illustration: FIG. 8.]    [Illustration: FIG. 9.]    A horseshoe of that kind is shown by Fig. 8, which was used in North  Africa in the twelfth century, and became the model for all forms of  horseshoes of the Mahometan tribes. Even now quite similar shoes (Fig.  9) are made south and east from the Caspian Sea, at the Amu-Darja, in  Samarkand, etc., which were probably introduced under Tamerlane, the  conqueror of nearly the whole of Asia Minor in the fourteenth century.    The so-called \"Sarmatische\" (Sarmatian) horseshoe (Figs. 10 and 11),  of South Russia, shows in its form, at the same time, traces of the  last named shoe, however, greatly influenced by the Mongolian shoe,  the \"Goldenen Horde,\" which at the turn of the sixteenth to the  seventeenth century played havoc at the Volga and the Aral. The  unusual width of the toe, and especially the lightness of the iron,  reminds us of the Turkomanic horseshoe, whereas, on the contrary, the  large bean-shaped holes, as well as the calks, were furnished through  Mongolian influence.    [Illustration: FIG. 10.]    The Sarmatian tribes were principally horsemen, and it is not  surprising, therefore, that the coat of arms of the former kingdom of  Poland in the second and third quadrate shows a silver rider in armor  on a silver running horse shod with golden shoes, and that at present  about 1,000 families in 25 lineages of the Polish Counts Jastrzembiec  Bolesezy, the so-called \"Polnische Hufeisen Adel\" (Polish Horseshoe  Nobility), at the same time also carried the horseshoe on their coats  of arms. The silver horseshoe in a blue field appears here as a symbol  of the \"Herbestpfardes\" (autumnal horse), to which, after the  christianization of Poland, was added the golden cross. The noblemen  participating in the murder of the holy Stanislaus in 1084 had to  carry the horseshoe reversed on their escutcheon.    [Illustration: FIG. 11.]    From the African and Turkomanic horseshoe, through the turning up of  the toes and heels, originated later the Turkish, Grecian and  Montenegrin horseshoe of the present as shown by Fig. 12.    [Illustration: FIG. 12.]    By the Moorish invasion in Spain, the Spanish-Gothic horseshoeing was  also modified, through which the shoe became smooth, staved at the  margin, very broad in the toe, and turned up at toe and heel, and at a  later period the old open Spanish national horseshoe (Fig. 13) was  developed. As we thus see, we can in no way deny the Arabian-Turkish  origin of this shoe.    [Illustration: FIG. 13.]    As France had received her whole culture from the south, and as the  crusades especially brought the Roman nation in close contact with  them for centuries, so it cannot appear strange that the old French  horseshoe, a form of which has been preserved by Bourgelat and is  represented by Fig. 14, still remained in the smooth, turned up in  front and behind, like the shoe of the southern climates, with Asiatic  traces, which hold on the ground, the same as all southern shoeing, by  the nail heads.    [Illustration: FIG. 14.]    The transit of the German empire, in order to keep up the historical  course, once more brings us back to the middle of the fifth century.  At this time Attila, the \"Godegisel\" (gods' scourge), left his wooden  capitol in the lowlands near the river Theis, to go to the Roman  empire and to the German and Gallican provinces, there to spread  indescribable misery to the horrors of judgment day.    The following is a prayer in those days of horror:          \"Kleiner Huf, kleines Ross,        Krummer Sabel, spitz Geschoss--        Blitzesschnell und sattlefest:        Schrim uns Herr von Hunnenpest.\"    We are at present reminded of those times of fright, when during the  clearing and tilling of the soil, a small roughly made horseshoe is  found in Southern Germany, about as far as the water boundary of the  Thuringian forest, and occasionally on, but principally around  Augsburg, and in France as far as the Loire.    These shoes, covering the margin or wall of the foot, show slight  traces of having been beveled on the lower surface, and contain two  bent calks very superficially placed. Occasionally they are sharpened  and turned in two directions. The characteristic wide bean-shaped nail  holes are conical on the inside, and are frequently placed so near the  outer margin of the shoe that from the pressure the hoofs were likely  to split open. The nail heads were shaped like a sleigh runner, and  almost entirely sunk into the shoe. It evidently was not bent up at  the toe, like the old form of these kinds of shoes.    These shoes, according to our conception of to-day, were so carelessly  finished that in the scientific circles of historical researches they  were, until very recently, looked upon as saddle mountings or  something similar, and not as horseshoes.    This shoe was for some time, while it was plentifully found in France,  regarded as of Celtic make; but this is certainly not the case, as it  is of Hunish and Hungarian \"nationalitat\" (nationality). An exactly  scientific proof, it is true, according to our present knowledge,  cannot be furnished; however, it will stand well enough until the  error is proved.    This peculiar kind of horseshoe has been found in South Germany and  Northeast France, as far as the region of Orleans, where, as it has  been proved, the Huns appeared. This, therefore, speaks for their  descendants: 1st, the far extended and yet sharply limited places of  finding the shoe; 2d, the small size corresponds to the historically  proved smallness of the Hunish horse; 3d, the hasty and careless make,  which does not indicate that it was made by settled workmen; 4th, the  horseshoe (Fig. 15) bespeaks the Hunish workmanship of the present  Chinese shoe, which, in making of the nail holes, shows to-day related  touches of the productions of the Mongolian ancestors.    [Illustration: FIG. 15.]    Aside from the peculiar shaped nail holes, the characteristic of the  Hunish shoe consists in the changes of the calks for summer and winter  shoeing, as well as in the sinking of the nail heads. The Huns,  therefore, aside from the indistinctly marked attempts of the Romans  in this direction, which are the only ones known to me, must be  regarded as the inventors not only of the calks, but partly, next to  the Normans, also of the sharpened winter shoeing, and of the not  unimportant invention of sinking the nail heads observed in Fig. 15.    The Hunish shoeing was therefore an important invention for the  Germans. After centuries later, wherever horseshoeing was practiced,  it was done solely according to Hunish methods; whereby the shoe was  very possibly made heavier, was more carefully finished and in course  of time showed an attempt to bend the toe (Fig. 16a).    [Illustration: FIG. 16.]    [Illustration: FIG. 16A.]    In the Bomberg Dom we find an equestrian statue, not unknown in the  history of art, which was formerly held to be that of Emperor Conrad  III. At present however the opinion prevails generally that it  represents \"Stephen I., den Heiligen\" (Stephen I., the Saint).    Stephen I., the first king of Hungary, formerly was a heathen, and was  named \"Najk.\" He reigned from 997 to 1038. His important events were  the many victorious wars led against rebellious chieftains of his  country, and he was canonized in 1087. His equestrian monument in  Bomberg Dom was, in consequence, hardly made before the year 1087.  Notwithstanding that the Huns had been defeated 500 years before on  the plains of Catalania, the horse of the above mentioned monument  carries, as I have convinced myself personally, Hunish horseshoes,  modified, however, by blade-shaped calks just then coming into use.  This is proof that, at least in Hungary, the Hunish method of shoeing  was preserved an extraordinary long time. By this it has not become  improbable that at least the many shoes of this kind which were found  on the Lechfield come, not directly from the Huns, but from their  successors, the Hungarians, whose invasions took place in the first  half of the tenth century.    About the same time of the Hungarian invasions, the Normans began to  disturb the southwestern part of Europe with their Viking expeditions.  Their sea kings seem to have been equestrians at very early times, and  to have had their horses shod, although perhaps only in winter; at  least"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14992"],[0,"The Life of Froude (#10)"],[1,"there had been one Catholic Church, and as an  Englishman he asserted in the language of the Articles that the  Bishop of Rome had no jurisdiction within this realm of England. He  wanted to vindicate the reformers, and to prove that in the struggle  against Papal Supremacy English patriots took the side of the king.  He was roused to indignation by slanders against the character of  Elizabeth; and he held, as almost every one now holds, that the  attempt to make an innocent saint of Mary Stuart was futile. Even  More and Fisher he refused to accept as candidates for the crown of  martyrdom. They were both excellent men. More was, in some respects,  a great man. They were certainly far more virtuous than the king who  put them to death. But they were executed for treason, not for  heresy, and to clear their memory it is necessary to show that they  had no part in conspiring with a foreign Power against their lawful  sovereign. That Power, the Church of Rome, a Power till 1870, Froude  cordially hated. He regarded it as an obstacle to progress, an enemy  of freedom, an enslaver of the intellect and the soul. The English  Catholics of his own time were mild, honourable, and loyal. Although  they had been relieved of their disabilities, they had no power.  Froude's reading and reflection led him to infer that when the  Church was powerful it aimed a deadly blow at English independence,  and that Henry VIII., with all his moral failings, was entitled to  the credit of averting it. These opinions were not new. They were  held by most people when Froude was a boy. It was from Oxford that  an attack upon them came, and from Oxford came also, in the person  of Froude, their champion.    Froude's historical work took at first the form of essays, chiefly  in The Westminster Review and Fraser's Magazine. The Rolls Series of  State Papers had not then begun, and the reign of Henry was  imperfectly understood. Froude was  especially attracted by the age  of Elizabeth, who admired her father as a monarch, whatever she may  have thought of him as a man. It was an age of mighty dramatists, of  divine poets, of statesmen wise and magnanimous, if not great, of  seamen who made England, not Spain, the ruler of the seas. It was  with the seamen that Froude began. His essay on England's Forgotten  Worthies, which appeared in The Westminster Review for 1852, was  suggested by a new, and very bad, edition of Hakluyt. It inspired  Kingsley with the idea of his historical novel, Westward Ho! and  Tennyson drew from it, many years later, the story of his noble  poem, The Revenge. The eloquence is splendid, and the patriotic  fervour stirs the blood like the sound of a trumpet. The cruelties  of the Spaniards in South America, perpetrated in the name of Holy  Church, are described with unflinching fidelity and unsparing truth.  For instance, four hundred French Huguenots were massacred in cold  blood by Spaniards, who invaded their settlement in Florida at a  time when France was at peace with Spain. These Protestants were  flayed alive, and, to show that it was done in the cause of  religion, an inscription was suspended over their bodies, \"Not as  Frenchmen, but as heretics.\" Even at this distance of time it is  satisfactory to reflect that these defenders of the faith were not  left to the slow judgment of God. A French privateer, Dominique de  Gourges, whose name deserves to be held in honour and remembrance,  sailed from Rochelle, collected a body of American Indians, swooped  down upon the Spanish forts, and hanged their pious inmates,  wretches not less guilty than the authors of St. Bartholomew, with  the appropriate legend, \"Not as Spaniards, but as murderers.\" \"It  was at such a time,\" says Froude, \"and to take their part amidst  such scenes as these, that the English navigators appeared along the  shores of South America as the armed soldiers of the Reformation,  and as the avengers of humanity.\" Hawkins, Drake, Raleigh, Davis,  Grenville, are bright names in the annals of British seamanship. But  they were not merely staunch patriots, and loyal subjects of the  great Queen; they were pioneers of civil and religious freedom from  the most grievous yoke and most intolerable bondage that had ever  oppressed mankind.    In The Westminster for 1853 appeared Froude's essay on the Book of  Job, which may be taken as his final expression of theological  belief. Henceforward he turned from theology to history, from  speculation to fact. Even his friendship for Frederic Maurice could  not rouse him to any great interest in the latter's expulsion from  King's College. \"As thinkers,\" he wrote to Clough on the 22nd of  November, 1853, \"Maurice, and still more the Mauricians, appear to  me the most hopelessly imbecile that any section of the world have  been driven to believe in. I am glad you liked Job, though my  writing it was a mere accident, and I am not likely to do more of  the kind. I am going to stick to the History in spite of your  discouragement, and I believe I shall make something of it. At  any rate one has substantial stuff between one's fingers to be moulding  at, and not those slime and sea sand ladders to the moon 'opinion.'\"    Froude pursued his studies, reading all the collections of original  documents in Strype and other chroniclers. Why, he asked himself  should Henry, this bloody and ferocious tyrant, have been so popular  in his own lifetime? Parliament, judges, juries, all the articulate  classes of the community, why had they stood by him? No doubt he  could dissolve Parliament, and dismiss the judges. But to submit  without a struggle, without even protest or remonstrance, was not  like Englishmen, before or since. When Erasmus visited England he  found that the laity were the best read and the best behaved in  Europe, while the clergy were gluttonous, profligate, and  avaricious. No historian ever prepared himself more thoroughly for  his task than Froude. Sir Francis Palgrave, the Deputy Keeper of the  Records under Sir John Romilly, offered to let him see the  unpublished documents in the Chapter House at Westminster which  dealt with the later years of Wolsey's Government, and to the action  of Parliament after the Cardinal' s fall. He examined them  thoroughly, and accepted Parker's proposal that he should write the  history of the period. But he had to leave Plas Gwynant. The London  Library, which Carlyle had founded, sufficed for contributions to  magazines. History was a more serious affair, and it was necessary  for him to be, if not in London, at least near a railway. He  returned to his native county, and took a house at Babbicombe, from  which, after three years, he moved to Bideford. He made frequent  visits to London, where he was the guest of his publisher, John  Parker, at whose table he met Arthur Helps, John and Richard Doyle,  Cornewall Lewis, Richard Trench, then Dean of Westminster, and Henry  Thomas Buckle, once famous as a scientific historian. He called on  the Carlyles at their house in Chelsea, and began an intimacy only  broken by death. Carlyle himself was an excellent adviser in  Froude's peculiar field. He had the same Puritan leanings, the same  sympathy with the Reformation, the same hostility to ecclesiastical  interference with secular affairs, unless, as in the case of John  Knox, the interference was directed against Rome. Froude considered  him not unlike Knox in humour, keenness of intellect, integrity, and  daring. History was the one form of literature outside Goethe and  Burns for which he really cared. He had translated Wilhelm Meister  in 1824, and it was probably at his suggestion that Froude  translated Elective Affinities for Bohn's Library in 1850. Scottish  history and Scottish character Carlyle knew as he knew his Bible.  His assistance and encouragement, which were freely given, proved  invaluable to Froude.    Froude settled steadily down to work, dividing his time between  London and Devonshire. Shooting and fishing had for the time to be  dropped. For recreation he joined an archery club, where, as James  Spedding told him, you were always sure of your game. In after life  Froude, who never bore malice, used to say that his father had been  right in leaving him to his own resources, and that the necessity of  providing for himself was, in his instance, as in so many others,  the foundation of his career. He owed much to his publisher, John  Parker, who was liberal, generous, and confiding. Publishers, like  mothers-in-law, have got a bad name from bad jokes. Parker, by  trusting Froude, and relieving him from anxiety while he wrote,  smoothed the way for a memorable contribution to English history  which after many vicissitudes has now an established place as a work  of genius and research.    The principles on which he worked are explained in a contribution to  the volume of Oxford Essays for the year 1855.  The subject of this  brilliant though forgotten paper is the best means of teaching  English history, and the author's judgments upon modern historians  are peculiar. Hume and Hallam, the latter of whom was still living,  are indiscriminately condemned. Macaulay, whose first two volumes  were already famous, is ignored. The Oxford examiners are severely  censured for prescribing Campbell's Lives of the Chancellors as  authoritative, and Carlyle's Cromwell, a collection of materials  rather than a book, is pronounced to be the one good modern history,  though Froude denounces, with friendly candour, Carlyle's  \"distempered antagonism to the prevailing fashions of the age.\" The  most characteristic part of this essay, however, is that which  recommends the Statutes, with their preambles, as the best text-  book, and the following passage would be confidently assigned by  most critics to the History itself:    \"Who now questions, to mention an extreme instance, that Anne  Boleyn's death was the result of the licentious caprice of Henry?  and yet"]]]
