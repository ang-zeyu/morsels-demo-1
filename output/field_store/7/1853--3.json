He granted permission  to burn and bury the bodies of his victims. Piso's wife Verania and  his brother Scribonianus laid out his body, and this was done for  Vinius by his daughter Crispina. They had to search for the heads and  buy them back from the murderers, who had preserved them for sale.

He continued to hold the           office under Vitellius (ii. 63).        [76] See chap. 42, note 71.        [77] As a _libertus Caesaris_ he passed into Otho's hands with           the rest of the palace furniture.        [78] The consuls Galba and Vinius (chap. 1), were both dead.      DRAMATIS PERSONAE    Piso was in his thirty-first year. His reputation was better than       48  his fortune. His brothers had been executed, Magnus by Claudius,  Crassus by Nero.[79] He himself after being long in exile was a Caesar  for four days. Hastily adopted in preference to his elder brother,[80]  the only advantage he reaped was to be killed first.    Titus Vinius in his fifty-seven years had displayed strange contrasts  of character. His father belonged to a family of praetorian rank; his  mother's father was one of the proscribed.[81] A scandal marked his  first military service under the general Calvisius Sabinus.[82] The  general's wife suffered from a suspicious desire to inspect the  arrangements of the camp, which she entered by night disguised in  soldier's uniform. There she brazenly interfered with the guard and  the soldiers on duty, and eventually had the effrontery to commit  adultery in the general's own quarters. The man convicted of  implication in this scandal was Titus Vinius. He was therefore put in  irons by order of Caligula.[83] However, the fortunes of the time soon  changed and he was set at liberty. After mounting the ladder of office  without check, he was as an ex-praetor given the command of a legion,  and proved successful. But soon again he soiled his reputation, and  laid himself under the charge of having been mean enough to steal a  gold cup from Claudius' dinner-table. Claudius gave orders that on the  next day Vinius alone of all his guests should be served on  earthenware. However, as pro-consul, Vinius' government of Narbonese  Gaul was strict and honest. Subsequently his friendship with Galba  brought him into danger. He was bold, cunning, and efficient, with  great power for good or for evil, according to his mood. Vinius' will  was annulled because of his great wealth. Piso was poor, so his last  wishes were respected.    Galba's body lay long neglected, and under cover of darkness was        49  subjected to various insults. Eventually his steward Argius, one of  his former slaves, gave it a humble burial in his private garden. His  head, which the camp-followers and servants had mangled and carried on  a pole, was found next day in front of the tomb of Patrobius (one of  Nero's freedmen whom Galba had executed) and buried with the body  which had already been cremated. Such was the end of Servius Galba,  who for seventy-three years had enjoyed prosperity under five  different emperors, happier in their reign than his own. He came of an  old and noble family and possessed great wealth. His own character was  mediocre, rather free from vices than rich in virtues. Though not  indifferent to fame, he did not court it by advertisement. Not greedy  of other people's money, he was careful of his own, and a miser with  public funds. His attitude towards friends and freedmen, if they were  honest, was one of kindly complaisance; when they were not, he was  culpably blind. But his distinguished origin and the peculiar perils  of the time disguised his apathy, which passed as prudence.[84] In the  flower of his youth he served with distinction in Germany. As  pro-consul he governed Africa wisely, and in later years showed the  same equity in Nearer Spain.[85] When he was a commoner he seemed too  big for his station, and had he never been emperor, no one would have  doubted his ability to reign.    FOOTNOTES:        [79] Cn. Pompeius Magnus was Claudius' son-in-law, and           executed by him 'on a vague charge'. M. Licinius Crassus Frugi           was accused of treason to Nero by Aquilius Regulus, an           informer, whom one of Pliny's friends calls 'the vilest of           bipeds'. Regulus' brother was Vipstanus Messala. Cp. iv. 42.        [80] Scribonianus. Cp. chap. 15        [81] Under the second triumvirate.        [82] He was governor of Pannonia under Caligula.        [83] Sabinus and his wife were prosecuted, and both committed           suicide.        [84] Under Nero, says Tacitus in his Life of Agricola, 'the           wisest man was he who did least.'        [85] He had governed the upper province of Germany under           Caligula; Africa under Claudius; the Tarragona division of           Spain under Nero. In Germany he defeated the Chatti A.D. 41.      THE RISE OF VITELLIUS    The city was in a panic. The alarm aroused by the recent atrocious      50  crime and by Otho's well-known proclivities was further increased by  the fresh news about Vitellius.[86] This news had been suppressed  before Galba's murder, and it was believed that only the army of Upper  Germany had revolted. Now when they saw that the two men in the world  who were most notorious for immorality, indolence, and extravagance  had been, as it were, appointed by Providence to ruin the empire, not  only the senators and knights who had some stake and interest in the  country, but the masses as well, openly deplored their fate. Their  talk was no longer of the horrors of the recent bloody peace: they  reverted to the records of the civil wars, the taking and retaking of  Rome by her own troops, the devastation of Italy, the pillage of the  provinces, the battles of Pharsalia, Philippi, Perusia, and  Mutina,[87] those bywords of national disaster. 'The world was turned  upside down,' they mused, 'even when good men fought for the throne:  yet the Roman Empire survived the victories of Julius Caesar and of  Augustus, as the Republic would have survived had Pompey and Brutus  been victorious. But now--are we to go and pray for Otho or for  Vitellius? To pray for either would be impious. It would be wicked to  offer vows for the success of either in a war of which we can only be  sure that the winner will prove the worse.' Some cherished hopes of  Vespasian and the armies of the East: he was preferable to either of  the others; still they shuddered at the thought of a fresh war and  fresh bloodshed. Besides, Vespasian's reputation was doubtful. He was  the first emperor who ever changed for the better.    I must now explain the origin and causes of the rising of               51  Vitellius. After the slaughter of Julius Vindex[88] and his whole  force, the troops were in high spirits at the fame and booty they had  acquired. Without toil or danger they had won a most profitable  victory. So they were all for marching against the enemy: plunder  seemed better than pay. They had endured a long and unprofitable  service, rendered the more irksome by the country and climate and by  the strict discipline observed. But discipline, however stern in time  of peace, is always relaxed in civil wars, when temptation stands on  either hand and treachery goes unpunished. Men, armour, and horses  they had in abundance for use and for show. But, whereas before the  war the soldiers only knew the men of their own company or troop, and  the provincial frontier[89] separated the armies, now, having once  joined forces against Vindex, they had gained a knowledge of their own  strength and the state of the province, and were looking for more  fighting and fresh quarrels, calling the Gauls no longer allies, as  before, but 'our enemies' or 'the vanquished'. They had also the  support of the Gallic tribes on the banks of the Rhine, who had  espoused their cause and were now the most eager to rouse them  against 'the Galbians'[90] as they now called them, despising the name  of Vindex. So, cherishing hostility against the Sequani and Aedui,[91]  and against all the other communities in proportion to their wealth,  they drank in dreams of sacking towns and pillaging fields and looting  houses, inspired partly by the peculiar failings of the strong, greed  and vanity, and partly also by a feeling of irritation at the  insolence of the Gauls, who boasted, to the chagrin of the army, that  Galba had remitted a quarter of their tribute and given the franchise  and grants of land to their community.[92] Further fuel was added by a  rumour, cunningly circulated and rashly credited, that there was a  project on foot to decimate the legions and discharge all the most  enterprising centurions. From every side came alarming news and  sinister reports from the city. The colony of Lugdunum[93] was up in  arms, and its stubborn attachment to Nero made it a hotbed of rumour.  But in the camp itself the passions and fears of the soldiers, and,  when once they had realized their strength, their feeling of security,  furnished the richest material for lies and won them easy credence.    In the preceding year,[94] shortly after the beginning of               52  December, Aulus Vitellius had entered the province of Lower Germany  and held a careful inspection of the winter quarters of the legions.  He restored many to their rank, remitted degrading penalties, and  relieved those who had suffered disgrace, acting mainly from ambitious  motives, but partly also upon sound judgement. Amongst other things he  showed impartiality in remedying the injustices due "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16939"],[0,"Gems of Divine Mysteries (#10)"],[1,"this hope, and exclaim: \"Praise be unto Him, for verily He is the  Eternal Truth, and unto Him do we return!\"    109 Know, moreover, that should one who hath attained unto these stations  and embarked upon these journeys fall prey to pride and vainglory, he  would at that very moment come to naught and return to the first step  without realizing it. Indeed, they that seek and yearn after Him in these  journeys are known by this sign, that they humbly defer to those who have  believed in God and in His verses, that they are lowly before those who  have drawn nigh unto Him and unto the Manifestations of His Beauty, and  that they bow in submission to them that are firmly established upon the  lofty heights of the Cause of God and before its majesty.    110 For were they to reach the ultimate object of their quest for God and  their attainment unto Him, they would have but reached that abode which  hath been raised up within their own hearts. How then could they ever hope  to ascend unto such realms as have not been ordained for them or created  for their station? Nay, though they journey from everlasting to  everlasting, they will never attain unto Him Who is the midmost Heart of  existence and the Axis of the entire creation, He on Whose right hand flow  the seas of grandeur, on Whose left stream the rivers of might, and Whose  court none can ever hope to reach, how much less His very abode! For He  dwelleth in the ark of fire, speedeth, in the sphere of fire, through the  ocean of fire, and moveth within the atmosphere of fire. How can he who  hath been fashioned of contrary elements ever enter or even approach this  fire? Were he to do so, he would be instantly consumed.    111 Know, moreover, that should the cord of assistance binding this mighty  Pivot to the dwellers of earth and heaven be severed, they would all  assuredly perish. Great God! How can the lowly dust ever reach unto Him  Who is the Lord of lords? Immeasurably exalted is God above that which  they conceive in their hearts, and immensely glorified is He beyond that  which they attribute to Him.    112 Yea, the seeker reacheth a station wherein that which hath been  ordained for him knoweth no bounds. The fire of love so blazeth in his  heart that it seizeth the reins of constraint from his grasp. At every  moment his love for his Lord increaseth and draweth him nearer unto his  Creator, in such wise that if his Lord be in the east of nearness, and he  dwell in the west of remoteness and possess all that earth and heaven  contain of rubies and gold, he would forsake it all and rush forth to the  land of the Desired One. And shouldst thou find him to be otherwise, know  assuredly that such a man is a lying impostor. We, verily, all belong unto  Him Whom God shall make manifest in the latter Resurrection, and through  Him shall we be raised again to life.    113 In these days, inasmuch as We have lifted not the veils that conceal  the countenance of the Cause of God, nor disclosed unto men the fruits of  these stations which We have been forbidden to describe, thou beholdest  them drunk with heedlessness. Otherwise, were the glory of this station to  be revealed unto men to an extent smaller than a needle's eye, thou  wouldst witness them gathering before the threshold of divine mercy and  hastening from all sides to the court of nearness in the realms of divine  glory. We have concealed it, however, as mentioned before, that those who  believe may be distinguished from them that deny, and that those who turn  unto God may be discerned from them that turn aside. I verily proclaim:  \"There is no power nor strength except in God, the Help in Peril, the  Self-Subsisting.\"    114 From this station the wayfarer ascendeth unto a City that hath no name  or description, and whereof one heareth neither sound nor mention. Therein  flow the oceans of eternity, whilst this city itself revolveth round the  seat of eternity. Therein the sun of the Unseen shineth resplendent above  the horizon of the Unseen, a sun that hath its own heavens and its own  moons, which partake of its light and which rise from and set upon the  ocean of the Unseen. Nor can I ever hope to impart even a dewdrop of that  which hath been decreed therein, as none is acquainted with its mysteries  save God, its Creator and Fashioner, and His Manifestations.    115 Know, moreover, that when We undertook to reveal these words and  committed some of them to writing, it was Our intention to elucidate for  thine eminence, in the sweet accents of the blessed and the well-favoured  of God, all that We had previously mentioned of the words of the Prophets  and the sayings of the Messengers. Time, however, was lacking, and the  traveller who came from thy presence was in great haste and eager to  return. Thus have We cut short Our discourse and contented Ourself with  this much, without completing the description of these stages in a seemly  and befitting manner. Indeed, We have omitted the description of major  cities and mighty journeys. Such was the haste of the courier that We even  forsook the mention of the two exalted journeys of Resignation and  Contentment.    116 Yet, should thine eminence reflect upon these brief statements, thou  wouldst assuredly acquire every knowledge, attain unto the Object of all  learning, and exclaim: \"Sufficient are these words unto all creation both  visible and invisible!\"    117 Even so, should the fire of love burn within thy soul, thou wouldst  ask: \"Is there yet any more?\" (67) And We say: \"Praise be to God, the Lord  of the worlds!\"              FOOTNOTES          1 Shoghi Effendi, _God Passes By_ (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust,        1974), p. 110.        2 Baha'u'llah, _The Kitab-i-Iqan _(Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust,        1994), p. 26.        3 cf.
