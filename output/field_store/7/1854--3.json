They held their land \"of their lord\", the King, by knight's  service. The King had \"enfeoffed\" them [given them a fief: a  source of income] with land. The theory that by right all land  was the King's and that land was held by others only at his gift  and in return for specified service was new to English thought.    The Saxon governing class was destroyed. The independent power of  earls, who had been drawn from three great family houses, was  curtailed. Most died or fled the country. The people were  deprived of their most popular leaders, who were excluded from  all positions of trust and profit, especially the clergy of all  degrees.    William was a stern and fierce man and ruled as an autocrat by  terror. Whenever the people revolted or resisted his mandates,  he seized their lands or destroyed the crops and laid waste the  countryside and so that they starved to death. He had a strict  system of policing the nation. Instead of the Anglo-Saxon self-  government throughout the districts and hundreds of resident  authorities in local courts, he aimed at substituting for it the  absolute rule of the barons under military rule so favorable to  the centralizing power of the Crown. He used secret police and  spies and the terrorism this system involved. This especially  curbed the minor barons and preserved the public peace.    The English people were disarmed. Curfew bells were rung at 7:00  PM when everyone had to remain in their own dwellings on pain of  death and all fires and candles were to be put out, This  prevented any nightly gatherings, assassinations, or seditions.  Order was brought to the kingdom so that no man dare kill  another, no matter how great the injury he had received. William  extended the King's peace on high roads to include the whole  nation. Any individual of any rank could travel from end to end  of the land unharmed. Before, prudent travelers would travel  only in groups of twenty.    The barons subjugated the English who were on their newly  acquired land. There began a hierarchy of seisin [rightful  occupation] of land so that there could be no land without its  lord. Also, every lord had a superior lord with the King as the  overlord or supreme landlord. One piece of land may be held by  several tenures. For instance, A, holding by barons's service of  the King, may enfeoff B, a church, to hold of him on the terms  of praying for the souls of his ancestors, and B may enfeoff a  freeman C to hold of the church by giving it a certain  percentage of his crops every year. There were about 200 barons  who held land directly of the King. Other fighting men were the  knights, who were tenants or subtenants of a baron. Knighthood  began as a reward for valor on the field of battle by the King  or a noble. Altogether there were about 5000 fighting men  holding land.    The essence of Norman feudalism was that the land remained under  the lord, whatever the vassal might do. The lord had the duty to  defend the vassals on his land. The vassal owed military service  to the lord and also the service of attending the courts of the  hundred and the shire, which were courts of the King,  administering old customary law. They were the King's courts on  the principle that a crime anywhere was a breach of the King's  peace.    This feudal bond based on occupancy of land rather than on  personal ties was uniform throughout the realm. No longer could  a man choose his lord and transfer his land with him to a new  lord. He held his land at the will of his lord, to be terminated  anytime the lord decided to do so. In later eras, tenancies would  be held for the life of the tenant, and even later, for his life  and those of his heirs.    This uniformity of land organization plus the new requirement of  every freeman to take an oath of loyalty directly to the King  that would supersede any oath to any other man gave the nation a  new unity.    English villani, bordarii, cottarii, and servi on the land of the  barons were subjugated into a condition of \"villeinage\"  servitude and became \"tied to the land\" so that they could not  leave the land without their lord's permission. The villeins  formed a new bottom class as the population's percentage of  slaves declined dramatically. They held their land of their  lord, the baron. To guard against uprisings of the conquered  people, the barons used villein labor to build about a hundred  great stone castles, with moats and walls with towers around  them, at easily defensible positions such as hilltops all over  the nation.    A castle could be built only with permission of the King. A  typical castle had a stone building of about four floors on a  small, steep hill. Later it also had an open area surrounded by  a stone wall with towers at the corners. Around the wall were  ditches and banks and perhaps a moat. One traveled over these via  a drawbridge let down at the gatehouse of the enclosing wall. On  either side of the gatehouse were chambers for the guards.  Arrows could be shot through slits in the enclosing walls.  Inside the enclosed area might be stables, a granary, barracks  for the soldiers, and workshops.    The castle building was entered by an outer wood staircase to the  guard room on the second floor. The first floor had a well and  was used as a storehouse and/or dungeons for prisoners. The  second floor had a two-storied great hall, with small rooms and  aisles around it within the thick walls. There was also a chapel  area on the second floor. There were small areas of the third  floor which could be used for sleeping. The floors were wood and  were reached by a spiral stone staircase in one corner of the  building. Sometimes there was a reservoir of water on an upper  level with pipes carrying the water to floors below. Each floor  had a fireplace with a slanted flue going through the wall to the  outside. There were toilets in the walls with a pit or shaft  down the exterior of the wall. The first floor had only arrow  slits in the walls, but the higher floors had small windows.    The great hall was the main room of the castle. It was used for  meals and meetings at which the lord received homages, recovered  fees, and held the view of frankpledge. At the main table, the  lord and his lady sat on chairs. Everyone else sat on benches at  trestle tables, which could be folded up, e.g. at night.  Lighting was by oil lamps or candles on stands or on wall  fixtures. The residence of the lord's family and guests was at a  screened off area at the extreme end of the hall or on a higher  floor. Chests stored garments and jewels. Iron keys and locks  were used for chests and doors. The great bed had a wooden frame  and springs made of interlaced rope or strips of leather. It was  covered with a feather mattress, sheets, quilts, fur covers, and  pillows. Drapery around the bed kept out cold drafts and  provided privacy. There was a water bowl for washing in the  morning. A chamber pot was kept under the bed for nighttime use.  Hay was used as toilet paper. The lord's personal servants slept  nearby on benches or trundle beds. The floor of the hall was  strewn with straw, on which common folk could sleep at night.  There were stools on which to sit. Cup boards (boards on which  to store cups) and chests stored spices and plate. Cooking was  done outside on an open fire, roasting on spits and boiling in  post. One-piece iron shears were available to cut cloth. Hand  held spindles were used for weaving. On the roof there were  rampart walks for sentry patrols and parapets from which to  shoot arrows or throw things at besiegers. Each tenant of the  demesne of the King where he had a castle had to perform a  certain amount of castle-guard duty for its continuing defense.  These knights performing castle- guard duty slept at their posts.  Bathing was done in a wooden tub located in the garden in the  summer and indoors near the fire in winter. The great bed and tub  for bathing were taken on trips with the lord.    Markets grew up outside castle walls. Any trade on a lord's land  was subject to \"passage\", a payment on goods passing through,  \"stallage\", a payment for setting up a stall or booth in a  market, and \"pontage\", a payment for taking goods across a  bridge.    The Norman man was clean-shaven and wore his hair short. He wore  a long-sleeved under-tunic of linen or wool that reached to his  ankles. Over this the Norman noble wore a tunic without sleeves,  open at the sides, and fastened with a belt. Over one shoulder  was his cloak, which was fastened on the opposite shoulder by  being drawn through a ring brooch and knotted. He wore thick  cloth stockings and leather shoes. Common men wore tunics to the  knee so as not to impede them in their work. They could roll up  their stockings when working in the fields. A lady also wore a  long-sleeved linen or wool tunic fitted at the waist and laced  at the side, but full in the skirt. She wore a jeweled belt,  passed twice around her waist and knotted in front. Her hair was  often in two long braids, and her head covered with a white  round cloth held in place by a metal circlet like a small crown.  Over her tunic was a cloak fastened at the front with a cord. The  Norman knight wore an over-tunic of leather or heavy linen on  which were sewn flat rings or iron and a conical iron helmet  with nose cover. He wore a sword at his waist and a metal shield  on his back, or he wore his sword and his accompanying retainers  carried spear and shield.    Norman customs were adopted by the nation. As a whole,  Anglo-Saxon men shaved their beards and whiskers from their  faces, but they kept their custom of long hair flowing from  their heads. But a few kept their whiskers and beards in protest  of the Normans. Everyone had a permanent surname indicating  parentage,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16940"],[0,"Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh (#10)"],[1,"language, hath  made have been fulfilled; though, in spite of His not being accounted  among the learned, His being unschooled and inexperienced in the  disputations current among the divines, He hath rained upon men the  showers of His manifold and Divinely-inspired knowledge; yet, behold how  this generation hath rejected His authority, and rebelled against Him! He  hath, during the greater part of His life, been sore-tried in the clutches  of His enemies. His sufferings have now reached their culmination in this  afflictive Prison, into which His oppressors have so unjustly thrown Him.  God grant that, with a penetrating vision and radiant heart, thou mayest  observe the things that have come to pass and are now happening, and,  pondering them in thine heart, mayest recognize that which most men have,  in this Day, failed to perceive. Please God, He may enable thee to inhale  the sweet fragrance of His Day, to partake of the limitless effusions of  His grace, to quaff thy fill, through His gracious favor, from the most  great Ocean that surgeth in this Day in the name of the Ancient King, and  to remain firm and immovable as the mountain in His Cause.    Say: Glory be to Thee Who hast caused all the holy Ones to confess their  helplessness before the manifold revelations of Thy might, and every  Prophet to acknowledge His nothingness at the effulgence of Thine abiding  glory. I beseech Thee, by Thy name that hath unlocked the gates of Heaven  and filled with ecstasy the Concourse on high, to enable me to serve Thee,  in this Day, and to strengthen me to observe that which Thou didst  prescribe in Thy Book. Thou knowest, O my Lord, what is in me; but I know  not what is in Thee. Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.            XXIV: BEWARE, O BELIEVERS IN THE UNITY OF GOD,...      Beware, O believers in the Unity of God, lest ye be tempted to make any  distinction between any of the Manifestations of His Cause, or to  discriminate against the signs that have accompanied and proclaimed their  Revelation. This indeed is the true meaning of Divine Unity, if ye be of  them that apprehend and believe this truth. Be ye assured, moreover, that  the works and acts of each and every one of these Manifestations of God,  nay whatever pertaineth unto them, and whatsoever they may manifest in the  future, are all ordained by God, and are a reflection of His Will and  Purpose. Whoso maketh the slightest possible difference between their  persons, their words, their messages, their acts and manners, hath indeed  disbelieved in God, hath repudiated His signs, and betrayed the Cause of  His Messengers.            XXV: IT IS EVIDENT THAT EVERY AGE IN WHICH A MANIFESTATION...      It is evident that every age in which a Manifestation of God hath lived is  divinely ordained, and may, in a sense, be characterized as God's  appointed Day. This Day, however, is unique, and is to be distinguished  from those that have preceded it. The designation \"Seal of the Prophets\"  fully revealeth its high station. The Prophetic Cycle hath, verily, ended.  The Eternal Truth is now come. He hath lifted up the Ensign of Power, and  is now shedding upon the world the unclouded splendor of His Revelation.            XXVI: PRAISE BE TO GOD, THE ALL-POSSESSING, THE...      Praise be to God, the All-Possessing, the King of incomparable glory, a  praise which is immeasurably above the understanding of all created  things, and is exalted beyond the grasp of the minds of men. None else  besides Him hath ever been able to sing adequately His praise, nor will  any man succeed at any time in describing the full measure of His glory.  Who is it that can claim to have attained the heights of His exalted  Essence, and what mind can measure the depths of His unfathomable mystery?  From each and every revelation emanating from the Source of His glory,  holy and never-ending evidences of unimaginable splendor have appeared,  and out of every manifestation of His invincible power oceans of eternal  light have outpoured. How immensely exalted are the wondrous testimonies  of His almighty sovereignty, a glimmer of which, if it but touched them,  would utterly consume all that are in the heavens and in the earth! How  indescribably lofty are the tokens of His consummate power, a single sign  of which, however inconsiderable, must transcend the comprehension of  whatsoever hath, from the beginning that hath no beginning, been brought  into being, or will be created in the future till the end that hath no  end. All the Embodiments of His Names wander in the wilderness of search,  athirst and eager to discover His Essence, and all the Manifestations of  His Attributes implore Him, from the Sinai of Holiness, to unravel His  mystery.    A drop of the billowing ocean of His endless mercy hath adorned all  creation with the ornament of existence, and a breath wafted from His  peerless Paradise hath invested all beings with the robe of His sanctity  and glory. A sprinkling from the unfathomed deep of His sovereign and  all-pervasive Will hath, out of utter nothingness, called into being a  creation which is infinite in its range and deathless in its duration. The  wonders of His bounty can never cease, and the stream of His merciful  grace can never be arrested. The process of His creation hath had no  beginning, and can have no end.    In every age and cycle He hath, through the splendorous light shed by the  Manifestations of His wondrous Essence, recreated all things, so that  whatsoever reflecteth in the heavens and on the earth the signs of His  glory may not be deprived of the outpourings of His mercy, nor despair of  the showers of His favors. How all-encompassing are the wonders of His  boundless grace! Behold how they have pervaded the whole of creation. Such  is their virtue that not a single atom in the entire universe can be found  which doth not declare the evidences of His might, which doth not glorify  His holy Name, or is not expressive of the effulgent light of His unity.  So perfect and comprehensive is His creation that no mind nor heart,  however keen or pure, can ever grasp the nature of the most insignificant  of His creatures; much less fathom the mystery of Him Who is the Day Star  of Truth, Who is the invisible and unknowable Essence. The conceptions of  the devoutest of mystics, the attainments of the most accomplished amongst  men, the highest praise which human tongue or pen can render are all the  product of man's finite mind and are conditioned by its limitations. Ten  thousand Prophets, each a Moses, are thunderstruck upon the Sinai of their  search at His forbidding voice, \"Thou shalt never behold Me!\"; whilst a  myriad Messengers, each as great as Jesus, stand dismayed upon their  heavenly thrones by the interdiction, \"Mine Essence thou shalt never  apprehend!\" From time immemorial He hath been veiled in the ineffable  sanctity of His exalted Self, and will everlastingly continue to be wrapt  in the impenetrable mystery of His unknowable Essence. Every attempt to  attain to an understanding of His inaccessible Reality hath ended in  complete bewilderment, and every effort to approach His exalted Self and  envisage His Essence hath resulted in hopelessness and failure.    How bewildering to me, insignificant as I am, is the attempt to fathom the  sacred depths of Thy knowledge! How futile my efforts to visualize the  magnitude of the power inherent in Thine handiwork--the revelation of Thy  creative power! How can mine eye, which hath no faculty to perceive  itself, claim to have discerned Thine Essence, and how can mine heart,  already powerless to apprehend the significance of its own potentialities,  pretend to have comprehended Thy nature? How can I claim to have known  Thee, when the entire creation is bewildered by Thy mystery, and how can I  confess not to have known Thee, when, lo, the whole universe proclaimeth  Thy Presence and testifieth to Thy truth? The portals of Thy grace have  throughout eternity been open, and the means of access unto Thy Presence  made available, unto all created things, and the revelations of Thy  matchless Beauty have at all times been imprinted upon the realities of  all beings, visible and invisible. Yet, notwithstanding this most gracious  favor, this perfect and consummate bestowal, I am moved to testify that  Thy court of holiness and glory is immeasurably exalted above the  knowledge of all else besides Thee, and the mystery of Thy Presence is  inscrutable to every mind except Thine own. No one except Thyself can  unravel the secret of Thy nature, and naught else but Thy transcendental  Essence can grasp the reality of Thy unsearchable being. How vast the  number of those heavenly and all-glorious beings who, in the wilderness of  their separation from Thee, have wandered all the days of their lives, and  failed in the end to find Thee! How great the multitude of the sanctified  and immortal souls who were lost and bewildered while seeking in the  desert of search to behold Thy face! Myriad are Thine ardent lovers whom  the consuming flame of remoteness from Thee hath caused to sink and  perish, and numberless are the faithful souls who have willingly laid down  their lives in the hope of gazing on the light of Thy countenance. The  sighs and moans of these longing hearts that pant after Thee can never  reach Thy holy court, neither can the lamentations of the wayfarers that  thirst to appear before Thy face attain Thy seat of glory.            XXVII: ALL PRAISE TO THE UNITY OF GOD, AND ALL...      All praise to the unity of God, and all honor to Him, the sovereign Lord,  the incomparable and all-glorious Ruler of the universe, Who, out of utter  nothingness, hath created the reality of all things, Who, from naught,  hath brought into being the most refined and subtle elements of His  creation, and Who, rescuing His creatures from the abasement of remoteness  and the perils of"]]]
