[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17388"],[0,"Andrew Marvell (#10)"],[1,"have informed the distinguished author that he had done so. But  alas for the vanity of the writing man! The sublime poet, who in his  early manhood had composed _Lycidas_, and was in his old age to write  _Paradise Lost_, demanded further and better particulars as to the  precise manner in which the chief of his office received, not only the  book, but the letter which accompanied it. Nobody is now left to think  much of Bradshaw, but in 1654 he was an excellent representative of the  class Carlyle was fond of describing as the _alors celebre_. Prompted by  this desire, Milton must have written to Marvell hinting, as he well  knew how to do, his surprise at the curtness of his friend's former  communication, and Marvell's reply to this letter has come down to us.  It is Marvell's glory that long before _Paradise Lost_ he recognised the  essential greatness of the blind secretary, and his letter is a fine  example of the mode of humouring a great man. Be it remembered, as we  read, that this letter was not addressed to one of the greatest names in  literature, but to a petulant and often peevish scholar, living of  necessity in great retirement, whose name is never once mentioned by  Clarendon, and about whom the voluminous Thurloe, who must have seen him  hundreds of times, has nothing to say except that he was \"a blind man  who wrote Latin letters.\" Odder still, perhaps, Richard Baxter, whose  history of his own life and times is one of the most informing books in  the world, never so much as mentions the one and only man whose name  can, without any violent sense of unfitness, be given to the age about  which Baxter was writing so laboriously.       \"HONOURED SIR,--I did not satisfie my self in the account I     gave you of presentinge your Book to my Lord, although it seemed to     me that I writ to you all which the messenger's speedy returne the     same night from Eaton would permit me; and I perceive that, by reason     of that hast, I did not give you satisfaction neither concerninge the     delivery of your Letter at the same time. Be pleased therefore to     pardon me and know that I tendered them both together. But my Lord     read not the Letter while I was with him, which I attributed to our     despatch, and some other businesse tendinge thereto, which I     therefore wished ill to, so farr as it hindred an affaire much better     and of greater importance, I mean that of reading your Letter. And to     tell you truly mine own imagination, I thought that he would not open     it while I was there, because he might suspect that I, delivering it     just upon my departure, might have brought in it some second     proposition like to that which you had before made to him by your     Letter to my advantage. However, I assure myself that he has since     read it, and you, that he did then witnesse all respecte to your     person, and as much satisfaction concerninge your work as could be     expected from so cursory a review and so sudden an account as he     could then have of it from me. Mr. Oxenbridge, at his returne from     London, will, I know, give you thanks for his book, as I do with all     acknowledgement and humility for that you have sent me. I shall now     studie it even to the getting of it by heart; esteeming it, according     to my poore judgment (which yet I wish it were so right in all things     else), as the most compendious scale for so much to the height of the     Roman Eloquence, when I consider how equally it turnes and rises with     so many figures it seems to me a Trajan's columne, in whose winding     ascent we see imboss'd the severall monuments of your learned     victoryes: And Salmatius and Morus make up as great a triumph as that     of Decebalus, whom too, for ought I know, you shall have forced, as     Trajan the other, to make themselves away out of a just desperation.     I have an affectionate curiousity to know what becomes of Colonell     Overton's businesse. And am exceeding glad that Mr. Skynner is got     near you, the happinesse which I at the same time congratulate to him     and envie, there being none who doth, if I may so say, more jealously     honour you then, Honoured Sir, Your most affectionate humble servant,                                                         ANDREW MARVELL.       \"Eaton, _June 2, 1654._\"       Addressed: \"For my most honoured friend,                    John Milton, Esquire, Secretarye                       for the Forrain affaires                          at his house in Petty France,                             Westminster.\"    To conclude Marvell's Eton experiences; in 1657, and very shortly before  his obtaining his appointment as Milton's assistant in the place of  Philip Meadows, who was sent on a mission to Lisbon, Marvell was chosen  by the Lord-Protector to be tutor at Eton to Cromwell's ward, Mr.  Dutton, and took up his residence with his pupil with the Oxenbridges.  The following letter, addressed by Marvell to Oliver, will be read with  interest:--       \"May it please your Excellence,--It might, perhaps, seem fit for me     to seek out words to give your Excellence thanks for myself. But,     indeed, the only civility which it is proper for me to practice with     so eminent a person is to obey you, and to perform honestly the work     that you have set me about. Therefore I shall use the time that your     Lordship is pleased to allow me for writing, onely for that purpose     for which you have given me it; that is, to render you an account of     Mr. Dutton. I have taken care to examine him several times in the     presence of Mr. Oxenbridge, as those who weigh and tell over money     before some witnesse ere they take charge of it; for I thought that     there might be possibly some lightness in the coyn, or errour in the     telling, which hereafter I should be bound to make good. Therefore,     Mr. Oxenbridge is the best to make your Excellency an impartial     relation thereof: I shall only say, that I shall strive according to     my best understanding (that is, according to those rules your     Lordship hath given me) to increase whatsoever talent he may have     already. Truly, he is of gentle and waxen disposition; and God be     praised, I cannot say he hath brought with him any evil impression;     and I shall hope to set nothing into his spirit but what may be of a     good sculpture. He hath in him two things that make youth most easy     to be managed,--modesty, which is the bridle to vice; and emulation,     which is the spur to virtue. And the care which your Excellence is     pleased to take of him is no small encouragement and shall be so     represented to him; but, above all, I shall labour to make him     sensible of his duty to God; for then we begin to serve faithfully,     when we consider He is our master. And in this, both he and I owe     infinitely to your Lordship, for having placed us in so godly a     family as that of Mr. Oxenbridge, whose doctrine and example are like     a book and a map, not only instructing the ear, but demonstrating to     the eye, which way we ought to travell; and Mrs. Oxenbridge has     looked so well to him, that he hath already much mended his     complexion; and now she is ordering his chamber, that he may delight     to be in it as often as his studys require. For the rest, most of     this time hath been spent in acquainting ourselves with him; and     truly he is chearfull, and I hope thinks us to be good company. I     shall, upon occasion, henceforward inform your Excellence of any     particularities in our little affairs, for so I esteem it to be my     duty. I have no more at present, but to give thanks to God for your     Lordship, and to beg grace of Him, that I may approve myself, Your     Excellency's most humble and faithful servant,                                                         ANDREW MARVELL.       \"Windsor, _July 28, 1653_.       \"Mr. Dutton[55:1] presents his most humble service to your     Excellence.\"    Something must now be said of Marvell's literary productions during this  period, 1652-1657. It was in 1653 that he began his stormy career as an  anonymous political poet and satirist. The Dutch were his first victims,  good Protestants though they were. Marvell never liked the Dutch, and  had he lived to see the Revolution must have undergone some qualms.    In 1652 the Commonwealth was at war with the United Provinces. Trade  jealousy made the war what politicians call \"inevitable.\" This jealousy  of the Dutch dates back to Elizabeth, and to the first stirring in the  womb of time of the British navy. This may be readily perceived if we  read Dr. John Dee's \"Petty Navy Royal,\" 1577, and \"A Politic Plat (plan)  for the Honour of the Prince,\" 1580, and, somewhat later in date,  \"England's Way to Win Wealth,\" 1614.[56:1]    These short tracts make two things quite plain--first, the desire to get  our share of the foreign fishing trade, then wholly in the hands of the  Dutch; and second, the recognition that England was a sea-empire,  dependent for its existence upon a great navy manned by the seafaring  inhabitants of our coasts.    The enormous fishing trade done in our own waters by the Dutch, the  splendid fleet of fishing craft with twenty thousand handy sailors on  board, ready by every 1st of June to sail out of the Maas, the Texel,  and the Vlie, to catch herring in the North Sea, excited admiration,  envy, and almost despair.       \"O, slothful England and careless countrymen! look but on these     fellows that we call the plump Hollanders! Behold their diligence in     fishing and our most careless negligence! Six hundred of these     fisherships and more be great Busses, some six score tons, most of     them be a hundred tons, and the rest three score tons and fifty tons;     the biggest of them having four and twenty men, some twenty men, and     some eighteen or sixteen men apiece. So there cannot be in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17396"],[0,"The Secret Garden (#10)"],[1,"which only a few people understood, so she was not  surprised when Martha used words she did not know.    Martha laughed as she had done the first morning.    \"There now,\" she said. \"I've talked broad Yorkshire again like Mrs. Medlock  said I mustn't. 'Nowt o' th' soart' means 'nothin'-of-the-sort,'\" slowly  and carefully, \"but it takes so long to say it. Yorkshire's th' sunniest  place on earth when it is sunny. I told thee tha'd like th' moor after a  bit. Just you wait till you see th' gold-colored gorse blossoms an' th'  blossoms o' th' broom, an' th' heather flowerin', all purple bells, an'  hundreds o' butterflies flutterin' an' bees hummin' an' skylarks soarin'  up an' singin'. You'll want to get out on it at sunrise an' live out on  it all day like Dickon does.\"    \"Could I ever get there?\" asked Mary wistfully, looking through her  window at the far-off blue. It was so new and big and wonderful and such  a heavenly color.    \"I don't know,\" answered Martha. \"Tha's never used tha' legs since tha'  was born, it seems to me. Tha' couldn't walk five mile. It's five mile  to our cottage.\"    \"I should like to see your cottage.\"    Martha stared at her a moment curiously before she took up her polishing  brush and began to rub the grate again. She was thinking that the small  plain face did not look quite as sour at this moment as it had done the  first morning she saw it. It looked just a trifle like little Susan  Ann's when she wanted something very much.    \"I'll ask my mother about it,\" she said. \"She's one o' them that nearly  always sees a way to do things. It's my day out to-day an' I'm goin'  home. Eh! I am glad. Mrs. Medlock thinks a lot o' mother. Perhaps she  could talk to her.\"    \"I like your mother,\" said Mary.    \"I should think tha' did,\" agreed Martha, polishing away.    \"I've never seen her,\" said Mary.    \"No, tha' hasn't,\" replied Martha.    She sat up on her heels again and rubbed the end of her nose with the  back of her hand as if puzzled for a moment, but she ended quite  positively.    \"Well, she's that sensible an' hard workin' an' good-natured an' clean  that no one could help likin' her whether they'd seen her or not. When  I'm goin' home to her on my day out I just jump for joy when I'm  crossin' th' moor.\"    \"I like Dickon,\" added Mary. \"And I've never seen him.\"    \"Well,\" said Martha stoutly, \"I've told thee that th' very birds likes  him an' th' rabbits an' wild sheep an' ponies, an' th' foxes themselves.  I wonder,\" staring at her reflectively, \"what Dickon would think of  thee?\"    \"He wouldn't like me,\" said Mary in her stiff, cold little way. \"No one  does.\"    Martha looked reflective again.    \"How does tha' like thysel'?\" she inquired, really quite as if she were  curious to know.    Mary hesitated a moment and thought it over.    \"Not at all--really,\" she answered. \"But I never thought of that  before.\"    Martha grinned a little as if at some homely recollection.    \"Mother said that to me once,\" she said. \"She was at her wash-tub an' I  was in a bad temper an' talkin' ill of folk, an' she turns round on me  an' says: 'Tha' young vixon, tha'! There tha' stands sayin' tha'  doesn't like this one an' tha' doesn't like that one. How does tha' like  thysel'?' It made me laugh an' it brought me to my senses in a minute.\"    She went away in high spirits as soon as she had given Mary her  breakfast. She was going to walk five miles across the moor to the  cottage, and she was going to help her mother with the washing and do  the week's baking and enjoy herself thoroughly.    Mary felt lonelier than ever when she knew she was no longer in the  house. She went out into the garden as quickly as possible, and the  first thing she did was to run round and round the fountain flower  garden ten times. She counted the times carefully and when she had  finished she felt in better spirits. The sunshine made the whole place  look different. The high, deep, blue sky arched over Misselthwaite as  well as over the moor, and she kept lifting her face and looking up into  it, trying to imagine what it would be like to lie down on one of the  little snow-white clouds and float about. She went into the first  kitchen-garden and found Ben Weatherstaff working there with two other  gardeners. The change in the weather seemed to have done him good. He  spoke to her of his own accord.    \"Springtime's comin',\" he said. \"Cannot tha' smell it?\"    Mary sniffed and thought she could.    \"I smell something nice and fresh and damp,\" she said.    \"That's th' good rich earth,\" he answered, digging away. \"It's in a good  humor makin' ready to grow things. It's glad when plantin' time comes.  It's dull in th' winter when it's got nowt to do. In th' flower gardens  out there things will be stirrin' down below in th' dark. Th' sun's  warmin' 'em. You'll see bits o' green spikes stickin' out o' th' black  earth after a bit.\"    \"What will they be?\" asked Mary.    \"Crocuses an' snowdrops an' daffydowndillys. Has tha' never seen them?\"    \"No. Everything is hot, and wet, and green after the rains in India,\"  said Mary. \"And I think things grow up in a night.\"    \"These won't grow up in a night,\" said Weatherstaff. \"Tha'll have to  wait for 'em. They'll poke up a bit higher here, an' push out a spike  more there, an' uncurl a leaf this day an' another that. You watch 'em.\"    \"I am going to,\" answered Mary.    Very soon she heard the soft rustling flight of wings again and she knew  at once that the robin had come again. He was very pert and lively, and  hopped about so close to her feet, and put his head on one side and  looked at her so slyly that she asked Ben Weatherstaff a question.    \"Do you think he remembers me?\" she said.    \"Remembers thee!\" said Weatherstaff indignantly. \"He knows every cabbage  stump in th' gardens, let alone th' people. He's never seen a little  wench here before, an' he's bent on findin' out all about thee. Tha's no  need to try to hide anything from _him_.\"    \"Are things stirring down below in the dark in that garden where he  lives?\" Mary inquired.    \"What garden?\" grunted Weatherstaff, becoming surly again.    \"The one where the old rose-trees are.\" She could not help asking,  because she wanted so much to know. \"Are all the flowers dead, or do  some of them come again in the summer? Are there ever any roses?\"    \"Ask him,\" said Ben Weatherstaff, hunching his shoulders toward the  robin. \"He's the only one as knows. No one else has seen inside it for  ten year'.\"    Ten years was a long time, Mary thought. She had been born ten years  ago.    She walked away, slowly thinking. She had begun to like the garden just  as she had begun to like the robin and Dickon and Martha's mother. She  was beginning to like Martha, too. That seemed a good many people to  like--when you were not used to liking. She thought of the robin as one  of the people. She went to her walk outside the long, ivy-covered wall  over which she could see the tree-tops; and the second time she walked  up and down the most interesting and exciting thing happened to her, and  it was all through Ben Weatherstaff's robin.    She heard a chirp and a twitter, and when she looked at the bare  flower-bed at her left side there he was hopping about and pretending to  peck things out of the earth to persuade her that he had not followed  her. But she knew he had followed her and the surprise so filled her  with delight that she almost trembled a little.    \"You do remember me!\" she cried out. \"You do! You are prettier than  anything else in the world!\"    She chirped, and talked, and coaxed and he hopped, and flirted his tail  and twittered. It was as if he were talking. His red waistcoat was like  satin and he puffed his tiny breast out and was so fine and so grand and  so pretty that it was really as if he were showing her how important and  like a human person a robin could be. Mistress Mary forgot that she had  ever been contrary in her life when he allowed her to draw closer and  closer to him, and bend down and talk and try to make something like  robin sounds.    Oh! to think that he should actually let her come as near to him as  that! He knew nothing in the world would make her put out her hand  toward him or startle him in the least tiniest way. He knew it because  he was a real person--only nicer than any other person in the world. She  was so happy that she scarcely dared to breathe.    The flower-bed was not quite bare. It was bare of flowers because the  perennial plants had been cut down for their winter rest, but there were  tall shrubs and low ones which grew together at the back of the bed, and  as the robin hopped about under them she saw him hop over a small pile  of freshly turned up earth. He stopped on it to look for a worm. The  earth had been turned up because a dog had been trying to dig up a mole  and he had scratched quite a deep hole.    Mary looked at it, not really knowing why the hole was there, and as she  looked she saw something almost buried in the newly-turned soil. It was  something like a ring of rusty iron or brass and when the robin flew up  into a tree nearby she put out her hand and picked the ring up. It was  more than a ring, however; it was an old key which looked as if it had  been buried a long time.    Mistress Mary stood up and looked at it with an almost frightened face  as it hung from her finger.    \"Perhaps it has been buried for ten years,\" she said in a whisper.  \"Perhaps it is the key to the garden!\"          CHAPTER VIII    THE ROBIN WHO SHOWED THE WAY      She looked at the key quite a long time. She turned it over and over,  and thought about it. As I have said before, she was not a child who had  been trained to ask permission or consult her elders about things. All  she thought about the key was that if it was the key to the closed  garden, and she could find out where the door was, she could perhaps  open it and see what was inside the walls, and"]]]
