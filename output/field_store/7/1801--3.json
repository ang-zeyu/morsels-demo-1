The retreat of Yule's force was effected without more trouble than that  which was caused by the nature of the country and the alternations of  the climate. Van Tonder's Pass--a difficult defile which would have been  impassable under opposition--was crossed, and a sudden spate on the  Waschbank river only temporarily checked the retirement. A column was  sent out from Ladysmith by White to check the Free Staters who had  re-occupied Elandslaagte and to prevent them falling on Yule, and on  October 24 they were engaged with success at Rietfontein. The sound of  the artillery in this action was audible to Yule on the Waschbank, but  he was unable to account for it.    On the afternoon of October 25 Yule was within one day's march of  Ladysmith. He proposed to halt for the night; but suddenly a patrol from  a column sent out by White to help him in appeared, and he received  orders to press forward to Ladysmith.    The exhausted men resumed their march, and the misery of that night's  journey was probably never exceeded during any subsequent movement in  the war. Sodden, hungry, weary, disheartened; men and transport animals  inextricably intermingled; the column plodded onwards in the rain and  the night. A halt at daylight next morning brought in some of the  stragglers and gave a little rest to those who were still in the ranks;  and by mid-day the men of Talana Hill had trudged into Ladysmith.    The urgency of the immediate resumption of the march had arisen from  White's anxiety for the safety of Yule's force. Rietfontein had indeed,  like Talana and Elandslaagte, been a tactically successful engagement  and had similarly been followed by a retreat; but Yule was exposed to an  attack by Erasmus, to whom he had given the slip at Dundee during the  night of October 22 and who was known to be endeavouring to overtake  him. Erasmus was believed to be acting from the direction of  Elandslaagte; but fortunately for Yule his movements were not  judiciously directed and his information was imperfect.    [Sidenote: Map, p. 139.]    All the detached members of the Natal Wedge had now been driven in and  the reconnaissances sent out by White on October 27 and the following  days showed that the Boers had lost no time in pressing on to Ladysmith.  The Transvaalers were apparently in force N.E. of the town on a section  of the arc in which Lombard's Kop, Long Hill, and Pepworth Hill were the  chief physical features; the Free Staters were approaching from the N.W.  and a small force of them under A.P. Cronje was already in touch with  the Transvaalers; their main body, however, seemed to be making for the  Tugela in order to isolate Ladysmith from the south. On October 29 White  assumed the offensive with the greater part of his command, and  endeavoured to cut through the still unconsolidated investing line and  to thwart the co-operation of the allies.    The general idea was that an infantry brigade, supported on its right  flank by cavalry acting towards Lombard's Kop, should attack the enemy,  who was presumed to be in force on Long Hill and Pepworth Hill. On the  left flank of the attack a column would endeavour to pass through the  Boer line, and having seized Nicholson's Nek due north of Ladysmith  would either close it against the retreating enemy or hold it as a post  through which a mounted force could debouch in pursuit on to the more  practicable ground beyond.    Some difficulty in drawing and loading up ammunition delayed the start  of the column, which under the command of Carleton was to secure the  left flank of the operations; and fearing that daylight on October 30  would find his vulnerable force still on the march he determined soon  after midnight to halt short of Nicholson's Nek, from which he was then  two miles distant. He had succeeded in passing through the enemy's  picket line, and was perhaps not justified in discontinuing his advance,  although his instructions were to take Nicholson's Nek only \"if  possible.\" But an error of judgment made by a commanding officer on a  dark night in a strange country acting under instructions which left him  a free hand must not be judged severely, and had it not been for a  disaster which could not be foreseen, he would probably have been  commended for his prudence.    Kainguba Hill, which rises on the left of the road to Nicholson's Nek,  seemed to offer a suitable stage on the journey and towards it the  column was diverted. While the men were climbing the steep and stony  hillside a panic suddenly seized the transport mules. It may have been a  spontaneous emotion, or it may have originated in an alarm raised by the  Boers who were holding the crest. The animals stampeded down the slope,  and carrying with them not only the reserve ammunition but also the  signalling equipment, the water carts, and the component parts of the  mountain artillery, charged through the rear of the column. The timely  exertions of the officers checked the general scare that was imminent;  and with the exception of a few score of infantry men and gunners the  column reached the summit before daybreak, having lost almost everything  needed for a successful occupation of it.    Misfortune continued relentlessly to pursue the column. A position was  taken up on the hill on the supposition that it could only be attacked  from the south, but at daylight C. de Wet, who here came upon the stage  which afterwards he often filled so effectively, threatened it from the  north with a Free State commando. A gesture made by an officer in order  to attract attention was interpreted as a signal to retire; another  officer thinking that his company was left alone on the summit, though  it was in fact within seventy yards of an occupied sangar, raised the  white flag; and almost at the same moment a bugle sounded the Cease  Fire. Neither the white flag nor the bugle call was authorized by  Carleton; but a glance at the situation showed him that they could not  be repudiated and after a gallant struggle to maintain an indefensible  position he surrendered. Nearly a thousand men were led away into  captivity.    The main infantry attack was made by a force of five battalions with six  field batteries under the command of Grimwood. He marched out of  Ladysmith soon after midnight, but had not covered half the distance to  the point of attack when an unfortunate incident deprived him of all his  artillery and of two of his battalions. The guns marching in the centre  of the column and acting under orders which were not communicated to  Grimwood, diverged to the right and were followed by the two battalions  in rear; and the absence of nearly half the force was not discovered by  him until daybreak, and after he had taken up the position assigned  south of Long Hill. Daybreak also revealed the fact that Long Hill which  was assumed to be the Boer left was not occupied, and that Long Tom from  Impati had been emplaced on Pepworth Hill. The cavalry brigade under  French upon whom Grimwood relied to protect his right flank was two  miles away in his rear; and finding himself attacked on that flank  instead of from the front he was compelled to swing round and almost  reverse his front. Thus far the general scheme of attack had signally  failed. Carleton on the left had not reached Nicholson's Nek and was in  trouble; Grimwood with nearly half of his command gone astray, and  having discovered that the enemy's left was not on Long Hill but on  Lombard's Kop, had to improvise a scheme of his own; while French  instead of conforming to Grimwood was compelling Grimwood to conform to  him. At 8 a.m. Grimwood was suffering severely from artillery fire, and  French whose cavalry now prolonged Grimwood's line southwards was with  difficulty holding his own. The enemy, whom the general idea destined to  be outflanked and rolled up towards the north and pursued by mounted  troops issuing from Nicholson's Nek, was instead attacking vigorously  from Lombard's Kop on the east and seemed likely to outflank White; the  infantry reserves under Ian Hamilton were almost expended; and the  British artillery was unable to silence the Boer guns.    All through the forenoon Ladysmith and the little garrison left behind  for its defence was the target of Long Tom on Pepworth Hill. The  fugitives from Kainguba brought in disheartening reports and the Boers  seemed to be threatening from the north. W. Knox, a Horse Artillery  officer who had been left in command, anticipated an attack which he had  little chance of meeting successfully with the scanty force at his  disposal and sent an urgent message to White, who at noon ordered the  battle to be broken off and the troops to retire to Ladysmith.    The retreat was effected in confusion. Grimwood's force was the first to  be withdrawn and was saved from disaster by the gallant stand made by  two field batteries as it crossed the level ground. The cavalry  scampered home in Grimwood's track. A dramatic episode brought the  battle of Lombard's Kop to a close. Just as the baffled troops were  entering Ladysmith a battery of naval guns, which had arrived from  Durban that morning and had gone immediately into action, succeeded in  silencing Long Tom and some other guns on Pepworth Hill, nearly four  miles distant. In the evening Joubert sent in a flag of truce to White  to announce Carleton's surrender.    The Natal Wedge disappeared in the smoke of the battle of Lombard's Kop  and was never again heard of as an instrument in the Natal campaign. The  Boers filled the gaps in the investing line without difficulty, and on  November 2 the Siege of Ladysmith began. The last man to leave the town  was French, who went forth to win honour on distant fields.

And then when you jerk  her by the elbow and box her ears, and make her leave the table when  the pudding comes, and tell all the other children that it's because  she's a thief, wouldn't you expect her to run away?    I only ran four miles.  They caught me and brought me back; and every  day for a week I was tied, like a naughty puppy, to a stake in the back  yard while the other children were out at recess.    Oh, dear!  There's the chapel bell, and after chapel I have a committee  meeting.  I'm sorry because I meant to write you a very entertaining  letter this time.                                   Auf wiedersehen                                     Cher Daddy,                                         Pax tibi!                                                     Judy      PS.  There's one thing I'm perfectly sure of I'm not a Chinaman.                                                         4th February    Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,    Jimmie McBride has sent me a Princeton banner as big as one end of the  room; I am very grateful to him for remembering me, but I don't know  what on earth to do with it.  Sallie and Julia won't let me hang it up;  our room this year is furnished in red, and you can imagine what an  effect we'd have if I added orange and black.  But it's such nice,  warm, thick felt, I hate to waste it.  Would it be very improper to  have it made into a bath robe?  My old one shrank when it was washed.    I've entirely omitted of late telling you what I am learning, but  though you might not imagine it from my letters, my time is exclusively  occupied with study.  It's a very bewildering matter to get educated in  five branches at once.    'The test of true scholarship,' says Chemistry Professor, 'is a  painstaking passion for detail.'    'Be careful not to keep your eyes glued to detail,' says History  Professor.  'Stand far enough away to get a perspective of the whole.'    You can see with what nicety we have to trim our sails between  chemistry and history.  I like the historical method best.  If I say  that William the Conqueror came over in 1492, and Columbus discovered  America in 1100 or 1066 or whenever it was, that's a mere detail that  the Professor overlooks.  It gives a feeling of security and  restfulness to the history recitation, that is entirely lacking in  chemistry.    Sixth-hour bell--I must go to the laboratory and look into a little  matter of acids and salts and alkalis.  I've burned a hole as big as a  plate in the front of my chemistry apron, with hydrochloric acid.  If  the theory worked, I ought to be able to neutralize that hole with good  strong ammonia, oughtn't I?    Examinations next week, but who's afraid?                                   Yours ever,                                             Judy                                                         5th March    Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,    There is a March wind blowing, and the sky is filled with heavy, black  moving clouds.  The crows in the pine trees are making such a clamour!  It's an intoxicating, exhilarating, CALLING noise.  You want to close  your books and be off over the hills to race with the wind.    We had a paper chase last Saturday over five miles of squashy 'cross  country.  The fox (composed of three girls and a bushel or so of  confetti) started half an hour before the twenty-seven hunters.  I was  one of the twenty-seven; eight dropped by the wayside; we ended  nineteen.  The trail led over a hill, through a cornfield, and into a  swamp where we had to leap lightly from hummock to hummock.  of course  half of us went in ankle deep.  We kept losing the trail, and we wasted  twenty-five minutes over that swamp.  Then up a hill through some woods  and in at a barn window!  The barn doors were all locked and the window  was up high and pretty small.  I don't call that fair, do you?    But we didn't go through; we circumnavigated the barn and picked up the  trail where it issued by way of a low shed roof on to the top of a  fence.  The fox thought he had us there, but we fooled him.  Then  straight away over two miles of rolling meadow, and awfully hard to  follow, for the confetti was getting sparse.  The rule is that it must  be at the most six feet apart, but they were the longest six feet I  ever saw.  Finally, after two hours of steady trotting, we tracked  Monsieur Fox into the kitchen of Crystal Spring (that's a farm where  the girls go in bob sleighs and hay wagons for chicken and waffle  suppers) and we found the three foxes placidly eating milk and honey  and biscuits.  They hadn't thought we would get that far; they were  expecting us to stick in the barn window.    Both sides insist that they won.  I think we did, don't you?  Because  we caught them before they got back to the campus.  Anyway, all  nineteen of us settled like locusts over the furniture and clamoured  for honey.  There wasn't enough to go round, but Mrs. Crystal Spring  (that's our pet name for her; she's by rights a Johnson) brought up a  jar of strawberry jam and a can of maple syrup--just made last  week--and three loaves of brown bread.    We didn't get back to college till half-past six--half an hour late for  dinner--and we went straight in without dressing, and with perfectly  unimpaired appetites!  Then we all cut evening chapel, the state of our  boots being enough of an excuse.    I never told you about examinations.  I passed everything with the  utmost ease--I know the secret now, and am never going to fail again.  I shan't be able to graduate with honours though, because of that  beastly Latin prose and geometry Freshman year.  But I don't care.  Wot's the hodds so long as you're 'appy?  (That's a quotation.  I've  been reading the English classics.)    Speaking of classics, have you ever read Hamlet?  If you haven't, do it  right off.  It's PERFECTLY CORKING.  I've been hearing about  Shakespeare all my life, but I had no idea he really wrote so well; I  always suspected him of going largely on his reputation.    I have a beautiful play that I invented a long time ago when I first  learned to read.  I put myself to sleep every night by pretending I'm  the person (the most important person) in the book I'm reading at the  moment.    At present I'm Ophelia--and such a sensible Ophelia!  I keep Hamlet  amused all the time, and pet him and scold him and make him wrap up his  throat when he has a cold.  I've entirely cured him of being  melancholy.  The King and Queen are both dead--an accident at sea; no  funeral necessary--so Hamlet and I are ruling in Denmark without any  bother.  We have the kingdom working beautifully.  He takes care of the  governing, and I look after the charities.  I have just founded some  first-class orphan asylums.  If you or any of the other Trustees would  like to visit them, I shall be pleased to show you through.  I think  you might find a great many helpful suggestions.                           I remain, sir,                             Yours most graciously,                                 OPHELIA,                                     Queen of Denmark.                                                     24th March,                                             maybe the 25th    Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,    I don't believe I can be going to Heaven--I am getting such a lot of  good things here; it wouldn't be fair to get them hereafter too.  Listen to what has happened.    Jerusha Abbott has won the short-story contest (a twenty-five dollar  prize) that the Monthly holds every year.  And she's a Sophomore!  The  contestants are mostly Seniors.  When I saw my name posted, I couldn't  quite believe it was true.  Maybe I am going to be an author after all.  I wish Mrs. Lippett hadn't given me such a silly name--it sounds like  an author-ess, doesn't it?    Also I have been chosen for the spring dramatics--As You Like It out of  doors.  I am going to be Celia, own cousin to Rosalind.    And lastly:  Julia and Sallie and I are going to New York next Friday  to do some spring shopping and stay all night and go to the theatre the  next day with 'Master Jervie.'  He invited us.  Julia is going to stay  at home with her family, but Sallie and I are going to stop at the  Martha Washington Hotel.  Did you ever hear of anything so exciting?  I've never been in a hotel in my life, nor in a theatre; except once  when the Catholic Church had a festival and invited the orphans, but  that wasn't a real play and it doesn't count.    And what do you think we're going to see?  Hamlet.  Think of that!  We  studied it for four weeks in Shakespeare class and I know it by heart.    I am so excited over all these prospects that I can scarcely sleep.    Goodbye, Daddy.    This is a very entertaining world.                                           Yours ever,                                                         Judy      PS.  I've just looked at the calendar.  It's the 28th.    Another postscript.    I saw a street car conductor today with one brown eye and one blue.  Wouldn't he make a nice villain for a detective story?                                                             7th April    Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,    Mercy!  Isn't New York big?  Worcester is nothing to it.  Do you mean  to tell me that you actually live in all that confusion?  I don't  believe that I shall recover for months from the bewildering effect of  two days of it.  I can't begin to tell you all the amazing things I've  seen; I suppose you know, though, since you live there yourself.    But aren't the streets entertaining?  And the people?  And the shops?  I never saw such lovely things as there are in the windows.  It makes  you want to devote your life to wearing clothes.    Sallie and Julia and I went shopping together Saturday morning.  Julia  went into the very most gorgeous place I ever saw, white and gold "]]]
