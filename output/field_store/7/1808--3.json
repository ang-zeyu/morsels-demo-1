He probably would have drowned if Uncle Ed hadn't  been on hand to work over him. Bill was a fine swimmer, but even the  best of swimmers will sometimes get a cramp, so it is never safe for any  one to go into the water without some one at hand to help him out in  case of accident. In the present case Bill was doing some fancy strokes  by himself over near the Pennsy shore, while the rest of us were  watching Uncle Ed give Dutchy a lesson in swimming. All of a sudden Bill  threw up his hands and sank. I happened to glance up as he did it. We  thought he was fooling at first, but soon made out that he was in  genuine trouble. Uncle Ed dropped Dutchy to my tender care, and raced  over with a powerful stroke to the spot where he had last seen his  nephew. He failed to find him on the first dive, but the second time was  successful and he carried the lifeless body to the Pennsylvania shore.  In the meantime I had landed Dutchy and with the rest of the boys had  crossed the lake. Uncle Ed first laid Bill on his back and hastily wiped  dry the mouth and nostrils. Then he pried his jaws apart, holding them  open with a piece of wood wedged in between the teeth. After which he  turned him on his face over a log which was placed under his stomach. By  stomach I do not mean the bowels, but the real stomach, which lies just  under the ribs in front. Then he pressed with a good weight on the back  directly over the log for nearly a minute, causing the water to flow out  of the mouth. Dutchy had by this time rowed across in the scow, in which  fortunately there happened to be some of Uncle Ed's clothing. This he  took and rolled into a bundle, then Bill was laid on his back over the  roll of clothing, which was arranged to raise the pit of his stomach  above the rest of his body. Uncle Ed now wrapped a handkerchief around  his forefinger, and with it wiped out Bill's mouth and throat. Reddy,  who was the least excited of the lot, was told to draw Bill's tongue  forward so as to prevent it from falling back and choking the windpipe.  This he did with the dry part of the handkerchief, drawing the end of  the tongue out at the corner of the mouth, and holding it there while  Uncle Ed and I started the pumping action, which produced artificial  respiration. I was directed to grasp Bill's arms just below the elbows,  and swing them vertically in an arc until the hands met the ground again  above the head. This expanded the chest. Uncle Ed at the same time stood  over the body with his elbows on his knees and hands extended, as  illustrated in Fig. 88. Then I swung the arms up and back to the sides  of the body, but just before the hands touched the ground Uncle Ed  seized the body in both hands just below the ribs, and as soon as I  touched the arms to the ground he swung forward with all his weight on  his hands, squeezing the waist and pushing upward so as to force out the  air in the chest. Then he slowly counted, one, two, three, four, all the  time steadily increasing the pressure, until at the signal four, with a  final push, he shoved himself to the first position, shown in Fig. 88.  At the same signal I drew the arms up again over the head, and held them  there while Uncle Ed again counted four; then I returned the arms to the  sides, and Uncle Ed repeated the squeezing process. These movements were  continued for about three minutes, and then Bill gave a short, faint  gasp. We kept on with the artificial respiration, assisting the gasps,  which gradually grew stronger, until they had deepened into steady  breathing. Then we stripped off the wet bathing suit, and wrapping Bill  in Uncle Ed's clothing, laid him in the bottom of the boat. While Dutchy  hurried the boat across, Uncle Ed rubbed the patient's arms and legs.  The rest of us swam over and ran for blankets from the tent. Bill was  wrapped in one of the blankets and the other was used as a stretcher, on  which we carried him to the tent. Then one of us was sent post-haste  across to Lumberville for some whiskey, which was diluted in hot water  and given the patient a teaspoonful at a dose, every fifteen minutes at  first, and then at less frequent intervals. Uncle Ed kept Bill in bed  all the next day for fear of congestion of the lungs. He told us that  unless the patient kept perfectly quiet for a couple of days, he was  liable to be seized with a sudden attack of hard breathing that might  choke him to death in a short time. To stop such an attack he told us  that the best plan was to apply a mustard plaster to the chest, and if  the patient commenced to gasp, to start pumping the arms and squeezing  the waist so as to help him breathe. After Bill had come around and was  himself again Uncle Ed gave us a thorough drill in methods of restoring  the drowned. He laid down on the grass and made us practise on him the  various directions which he gave us.      HOW TO WORK OVER A PATIENT ALONE.    [Illustration: Fig. 90. Working alone over a Patient.]    \"If you boys hadn't been so excited,\" he said, \"I would have made you  rub Bill's body and limbs while we were pumping the air into him, but I  knew you would get in the way, and be more of a bother than a help. You  must learn to be calm in any accident; excitement doesn't pay. Keep  steadily and slowly at your pumping, for you might have to do it for  four hours before the patient comes to.\" He taught us just how to swing  the arms and squeeze the ribs to best advantage, and how to hold the  tongue without getting in the way of the arms as they were pumped back  and forth. There was also a special way of rubbing the arms and legs.  The limbs were always rubbed upward, or toward the body, with the bare  hands, or a dry cloth if there was one at hand, but this all had to be  done without interfering with the pumping action. \"If the patient  doesn't come around in five minutes,\" he said, \"turn him on his face  again over the roll of clothing, or any other suitable substitute, and  press out the water from the stomach, rolling him first to one side and  then to the other; be sure to get all the water out.\" When we had  learned our lesson well, Uncle Ed took Dutchy for his patient, and  proceeded to show us how a man could work over him alone. First he went  through the operation of squeezing the water out of him, and drying his  nose and mouth, much to the patient's discomfort; then he drew Dutchy's  tongue out of the corner of his mouth, holding it there by closing the  jaws on it, and holding the jaws together by passing a handkerchief over  his chin and lapping it over his head. After that he began to pump,  seizing the patient's arms and swinging them up over the head and back,  as before. Just as the arms were dropped back to the sides of the body,  he squeezed them in against the ribs, at the same time drawing upward  toward the head and counting four each time, as he had done before. But  the lesson was abruptly interrupted by Dutchy, whose imagination was  worked up to such a pitch that I actually believe he thought he had been  drowning. Anyway, he squirmed out of Uncle Ed's grasp, and wouldn't play  patient any longer. For several days after that we couldn't persuade him  to venture near deep water.          CHAPTER IX.    BRIDGE BUILDING.      Willow Clump Island was, for the most part, a trackless wilderness, and  as soon as we had made our map we laid out roads to the different  important points. Our main highway ran from Point Lookout to Tiger's  Tail. This road was made rather winding, to add to its picturesqueness,  and from it a number of shorter roads branched off.      SPAR BRIDGE.    [Illustration: Figs. 91 and 92. Frames for the Spar Bridge.]    [Illustration: Fig 93. The Spar Bridge.]    We ran a bridge across the mill-race at its narrowest point. This bridge  was made of trees which we had cut down in making our road. It was quite  a piece of engineering, built under Uncle Ed's guidance. Two frames were  made of the shape shown in Figs. 91 and 92. The side sticks were 15 feet  long and spaced about 10 feet apart at the base by crosspieces. At the  upper end one frame was made 6 feet wide and the other 5 feet wide. The  side and cross spars were mortised together and secured by lashing a  rope around them. To make the frames more rigid we braced them with  diagonal braces nailed on. When completed we set the frames up on  opposite sides of the stream and with ropes carefully lowered their  upper ends until they interlocked, the side spars of each frame resting  on the cross spars of the other. In the angles formed by the crossing  side spars a center spar was laid, and a number of floor beams or spars  were stretched to this from the opposite shores. On these a flooring was  spread made of saplings, cut and trimmed to the right size. A rustic  railing on each side of the bridge completed the structure.      THE ROPE RAILWAY.    [Illustration: Fig. 94. The Swing Seat.]    [Illustration: Fig. 95. Tying the Ropes to the Seat.]      The mill-race was crossed further down by a rope line on which we rigged  a traveling carriage. A light manila rope was used, anchored to a tree  at each side about fifteen feet from the ground. A pulley block with a  wheel or sheave 4 inches in diameter was mounted to travel on the rope.  Suspended from this block by means of fall and tackle was a swing seat.  This, as shown in Fig. 94, was merely a board fastened with four rope  strands to the ring of the tackle block. A single rope was used, with  the ends tied firmly together. The loop thus formed was passed through  the ring of the tackle block and the opposite ends were twisted over the  ends of the seat board in the manner illustrated in Fig. 95. The tackle  blocks were quite small, having 2-inch sheaves, and they, together with  the large pulley or \"traveling block,\" as we called it, cost us about  $2.50. Two light ropes were fastened to the large traveling block, each  rope long enough to reach"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15839"],[0,"The Rebel of the School (#10)"],[1,"reary,       abominable land, it is this where they wave the British flag.       The ugliness of it would make you sick. The people are as ugly       as the country, and they're so stiff and stuck-up. If you       suppose for a moment that your wild Irish girl can stand much       of this sort of thing, you are fine and mistaken, and you can       tell the mother so. I mean to write to Aunt Katie O'Flynn       to-morrow and give her a fine piece of my mind. Early in the       day, dad, I did not think that I could stay at all; but I have       got a plan in my head now, and if I succeed I may at least put       up with one term of this detestable school. I won't tell you       the plan, for you mightn't approve; in fact, I can guess in       advance that you wouldn't approve. Anyhow, it is going to       occupy the time and thoughts of your Kathleen. Now I want a       good bit of money; not a pound or even five pounds, but more       than that. Can you send me a ten-pound note, daddy mine, and       say nothing whatever about it to the mother or the retainers       at Carrigrohane? And can you let me have it as quick as quick       can be? Maybe I will want more before the term is up, or maybe       I won't. Anyhow, we will let that lie in the future. Oh, my       broth of an old dad, wouldn't I like to hug you this blessed       minute? How is everybody at home? How are the mountains? How       is the sea? How is the trout-stream? Are those young cousins       of mine behaving themselves, the spalpeens? And how are you,       my heart of hearts--missing your Kathleen, I doubt not? Well,       no more for the present. They're rattling at the door like       anything, and there's a detestable boy now whistling 'Garry       Owen' right into my heart. You can't imagine what I am       feeling. Oh, the omadhaun! he is changing it now into 'St.       Patrick's Day,' Wisha, then, daddy! I must stop, for it's more       than the heart of woman can stand. Your affectionate daughter,         \"KATHLEEN.\"    This letter was posted by Kathleen herself. After supper she went with  David into the old loft over the tumble-down stables. It was not a very  safe place of refuge, for the rafters were rotten and might tumble down  at any time. Still, the sense of danger made it all, the more  interesting to the children. There they sat side by side, and Kathleen  told David about her old life. She was very outspoken and affectionate,  and very fierce and very wild. To look at her, one would have said there  never was any one less reserved; but Kathleen in her heart of hearts was  intensely reserved. Her real feelings she never told; her real hopes she  never breathed. She talked with high spirits all the time; and although  she liked David and was much comforted by his words and his actions, he  did not get at the real Kathleen at all.    When Alice came back that evening Kathleen was sound asleep in her  little bed, dreaming of Carrigrohane and the old home. She was murmuring  some loving words as Alice entered the room.    \"Oh, daddy mine, my heart is sore for you,\" she was saying in a tone  which caused Alice to pause and look at her attentively.    \"She is the most awful girl I ever heard of,\" thought Alice. \"I am sure  she will get us into trouble. I know that those three guineas a week  that mother gets for having her are not worth all the mischief she will  drag us into. But still, she does look pretty when she is asleep.\"    Kathleen had very long and very thick eyelashes and nobly arched brows.  Her forehead was broad and full and beautifully white. The mischievous,  dare-devil expression of her face when awake was softened in her sleep.  Alice, who had determined to come very noisily into the room and bang  her things about, to take rude possession of her own half of the  room--which, after all, was the better half--was softened by the look  on the girl's face. She knelt for a moment at her bedside and prayed  that God would keep her from quite hating Kathleen. This was a great  deal from Alice, who had made up her mind never to be friends with the  Irish girl. Then she got into bed and fell asleep.    The next morning, quite early, Kathleen was up. She was accustomed to  getting up almost at cock-crow at Carrigrohane, and when Alice opened  her eyes, it was to see an empty bed and an empty room.    \"I wonder if she's up to mischief?\" she thought.    She got up and went to the window. Kathleen was walking across the  common. She had no hat on, and no jacket. She was stepping along  leisurely, looking up sometimes at the sky, and sometimes pausing as  though she was thinking hard.    \"She will catch cold and be ill; that will be the next trouble,\" thought  the indignant Alice. She sleepily proceeded with her dressing. It was  only half-past seven. The Great Shirley School met at nine. Alice was  seldom downstairs until past eight. When she came down this morning she  saw, to her amazement, Kathleen helping the very untidy maid-of-all-work  to lay the breakfast things. She was dashing about, putting plates and  cups and saucers anyhow upon the board.    \"Now then, Maria,\" she said, \"shall I run down to the kitchen and bring  up the hot bacon and the porridge? I will, with a heart and a half. Oh,  you poor girl, how tired you look!\"    Maria, whom Alice never noticed, looked with adoring eyes at beautiful  Kathleen.    \"It isn't right, miss. I ought to be doing my own work,\" she said. \"I am  ever so much obliged to you, miss.\"    \"Wisha, then, it is I who like to help you,\" said Kathleen, \"for you  look fair beat.\"    She dashed past Alice, and appeared the next moment in the kitchen.    \"Where's the bacon, cook? And where's the bread, and where's the butter,  and all the rest of the breakfast? See, woman--see! Give me a tray and I  will fill it up and take the things upstairs with my own hands. You  think it is beneath me, perhaps; but I am a lady from a castle, and at  Carrigrohane Castle we often do this sort of thing when the hands of the  poor maids are full to overflowing.\"    The cook, a sandy-haired and sour-looking woman, began by scowling at  Kathleen; but soon the girl's pretty face and merry eyes appeased her.  She and Kathleen had almost a quarrel as to who was to carry up the  tray, but Kathleen won the day; and when Mrs. Tennant made her  appearance, feeling tired and overdone, she was amazed to see Kathleen  acting parlor-maid.    \"I love it,\" she said. \"If I can help you, you dear, tired, worn one, I  shall be only too glad.\"    \"I am sure, mother,\" said Alice, \"it is very good of Kathleen to wish to  do the household work; but as she has been sent here to gain some  information of another sort, do you think it ought to be allowed?\"    \"And who will prevent it, darling? That is the question,\" said Kathleen  in her softest voice.    Alice was silent.    \"I tell you what,\" said Kathleen. \"When I see you beginning to help your  poor, exhausted mother, and running messages for that overworked  slavey--I think you call her Maria--then perhaps I'll do less. And when  there's some one else to mend the boys' socks, perhaps I won't offer;  but until there is, the less you say about such things the better, Miss  Alice Tennant.\"    Ben kicked David under the table, and David kicked him back to stay  quiet. Altogether the breakfast was a noisy one.    Kathleen went to school quite prepared to carry out her promise to Susy  Hopkins. She had neatly packed the little Irish diamond brooch in a box,  and had slipped under it a tiny note:         \"Get as many foundation girls as you can to meet me, at       whatever place you like to appoint, this evening. I have a       plan to propose.--KATHLEEN O'HARA.         \"_P.S._--You can name the place by pinning a note under my       desk. Be sure you all come. The plan is gloryious.\"    The thought of the note and the plan and the little brooch kept Kathleen  in a fairly good humor on her walk to school. There she saw Ruth Craven.  She was decidedly angry with Ruth for having, as she said to herself,  \"snubbed her\" the day before. But beauty always had a curious effect on  the Irish girl, and when she observed Ruth's really exquisite little  face, clear cut as a cameo, with eyes full of expression, and watched  the lips ready to break into the gentlest smiles, Kathleen said to  herself:    \"It is all over with me. She is the only decent-looking colleen I have  met in this God-forsaken country. Make up to her I will.\"    She dashed, therefore, almost rudely through a great mass of incoming  girls, and seized Ruth by her shoulder.    \"Ruth,\" she said, \"go and talk to Susy Hopkins during recess. She will  have something to say, and I want you so badly. You won't refuse me,  will you, Ruth?\"    \"But I don't know what you want,\" said Ruth.    \"Go and talk to Susy Hopkins; she will know. Oh, there she is!\"    \"Kathleen, Kathleen!\" called out Alice. \"The school-bell has just rung,  and they are opening the doors. Come do come.\"    \"In a jiff,\" replied Kathleen.    She ran up to Susy.    \"This is what I promised,\" she said; \"and there is a note inside. Read  it, and give me the answer where I have asked you.\"    Susy Hopkins, a most ordinary little girl, who had no position of any  sort in the school, colored high with delight. Some of the paying girls  looked at her in astonishment. Susy walked into the school with her head  high in the air; she quite adored Kathleen, for she was making her a  person of great distinction.    \"We are going to have a glorious time,\" whispered Susy to Kate Rourke as  they made their way to their respective classes.    Susy was small, rather stupid, and absolutely unimportant. Kate was big,  black-eyed, impudent. She was jealous of the paying girls of the school;  but she treated Susy as some one beneath contempt.    \"Don't drag my sleeve,\" she replied crossly. \"And what you do mean by a  glorious time? I don't understand you.\"    \"You will presently,\""]]]
