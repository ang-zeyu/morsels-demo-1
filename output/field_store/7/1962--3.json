I have spoken the more concerning it, because I shall  borrow many things in my farther discourse, from those discoveries which  were made by it.      [Sidenote 1: _ibid. c. 5._]      [Sidenote 2: _Cap. 1._]      [Sidenote 3: _Cap. 5._]    I have now cited such Authors both ancient and moderne, who have  directly maintained the same opinion. I told you likewise in the  proposition that it might probably be deduced from the tenent of others:  such were _Aristarchus_, _Philolaus_ and _Copernicus_, with many other  later writers who assented to their hypothesis, so _Ioach. Rlelicus_,  _David Origanus_, _Lansbergius_, _Guil. Gilbert_, and (if I may believe  _Campanella_[1]) _Innumeri alii Angli & Galli_. Very many others both  English and French, all who affirmed our Earth to be one of the Planets,  and the Sunne to bee the Centre of all, about which the heavenly bodies  did move, and how horrid soever this may seeme at the first, yet is it  likely enough to be true, nor is there any maxime or observation in  Opticks (saith _Pena_) that can disprove it.      [Sidenote 1: _Apologia pro Galilaeo._]    Now if our earth were one of the Planets (as it is according to them)  then why may not another of the Planets be an earth?    Thus have I shewed you the truth of this proposition: Before I proceede  farther, 'tis requisite that I informe the Reader, what method I shall  follow in the proving of this chiefe assertion, that there is a World in  the Moone.    The order by which I shall bee guided will be that which _Aristotle_[1]  uses in his booke _De mundo_ (if that booke were his.)      [Sidenote 1: _a 1ยบ. cap. ad 10m._]    First, +peri ton en aute+ of those chiefe parts which are in it; not the  elementary and aethereall (as he doth there) since this doth not belong  to the elementary controversie, but of the Sea and Land, &c. Secondly,  +peri auten pathon+, of those things which are extrinsecall to it, as  the seasons, meteors and inhabitants.          Proposition 7.    _That those spots and brighter parts which by our sight may be    distinguished in the Moone, doe shew the difference betwixt the Sea    and Land in that other World._      For the cleare proofe of this proposition, I shall first reckon up and  refute the opinions of others concerning the matter and forme of those  spots, and then shew the greater probability of this present assertion,  and how agreeable it is to that truth, which is most commonly received;  as for the opinions of other concerning these, they have beene very  many, I will only reckon up those which are common and remarkeable.    Some there are that thinke those spots doe not arise from any deformity  of the parts, but a deceit of the eye, which cannot at such a distance  discerne an equall light in that planet, but these do but onely say it,  and shew not any reason for the proofe of their opinion: Others think[1]  that there be some bodies betwixt the Sunne and Moone, which keeping off  the lights in some parts, doe by their shadow produce these spots which  wee there discerne.      [Sidenote 1: So _Bede_ in _d. de Mund. constit._]    Others would have them to be the figure of the mountaines here below  represented there as in a looking-glasse. But none of those fancies can  bee true, because the spots are stil the same, & not varied according to  the difference of places, and besides, _Cardan_ thinks it is impossible  that any image should be conveyed so farre as there to be represented  unto us at such a distance,[1] but tis commonly related of _Pythagoras_,  that he by writing, what he pleased in a glasse, by the reflexio of the  same species, would make those letters to appeare in the circle of the  Moone, where they should be legible by any other, who might at that time  be some miles distant from him.[2]* _Agrippa_ affirmes this to be  possible, and the way of performing it not unknowne to himselfe, with  some others in his time. It may be that our Bishop did by the like  meanes performe those strange conclusions which hee professes in his  _Nuncius inanimatus_, where hee pretends that hee can informe his  friends of what he pleases, though they be an hundred miles distant,  _forte etiam, vel milliare millesimum_, they are his owne words, and,  perhaps, a thousand, and all this in a minutes space, or little more,  quicker than the Sunne can move.      [Sidenote 1: _De subtil. lib. 3._]      [Sidenote 2*: _Occulta ad Philos. l. 1. cap. 6._]    Now, what conveyance there should be for so speedy a passage, I cannot  conceive, unlesse it be carried with the light, then which wee know not  any thing quicker; but of this onely by the way; however, whether those  images can be represented so or not, yet certaine it is, those spots are  not such representations. Some thinke that when God had at first created  too much earth to make a perfect globe, not knowing well where to bestow  the rest, he placed it in the Moone, which ever since hath so darkened  it in some parts, but the impiety of this is sufficient confutation,  since it so much detracts from the divine power and wisedome.    The *[1]Stoicks held that planet to be mixed of fire and aire, and in  their opinion, the variety of its composition, caused her spots:  _Anaxagoras_ thought all the starres to be of an earthly nature, mixed  with some fire, and as for the Sunne, hee affirmed it to be nothing else  but a fiery stone; for which later opinion, the _Athenians_ sentenc'd  him to death;[2] those zealous Idolaters counting it a great blasphemy,  to make their God a stone, whereas not withstanding, they were so  senslesse in their adoration of Idolls, as to make a stone their God,  this _Anaxagoras_ affirmed the Moone to be more terrestriall then the  other, but of a greater purity then any thing here below, and the spots  hee thought were nothing else, but some cloudy parts, intermingled with  the light which belonged to that Planet, but I have above destroyed the  supposition on which this fancy is grounded: _Pliny_[3] thinkes they  arise from some drossie stuffe, mixed with that moysture which the Moone  attracts unto her selfe, but hee was of their opinion, who thought the  starres were nourished by some earthly vapours, which you may commonly  see refuted in the _Commentators_ on the bookes, _de Coelo_.      [Sidenote 1*: _Plut. de placit. phil. l. 2. c. 25._]      [Sidenote 2: _Iosephus l. 2. con. App._    _August. de civit. Dei. l. 18. c. 41._]      [Sidenote 3: _Nat. Hist. lib. 2. c. 9._]    _Vitellio_ and _Reinoldus_[1] affirme the spots to be the thicker parts  of the Moone, into which the Sunne cannot infuse much light, and this  (say they) is the reason, why in the Sunnes eclipses, the spots and  brighter parts are still in some measure distinguished, because the  Sunne beames are not able so well to penetrate through those thicker, as  they may through the thinner parts of the Planet. Of this opinion also  was _Caesar la Galla_, whose words are these,[2]      \"The Moone doth there appeare clearest, where shee is transpicuous,    not onely through the superficies, but the substance also, and there    she seemes spotted, where her body is most opacous.\"    The ground of this his assertion was, because hee thought the Moone did  receive and bestow her light by illumination onely, and not at all by  reflexion, but this, together with the supposed penetration of the Sunne  beames, and the perspicuity of the Moones body I have above answered and  refuted.      [Sidenote 1: _Opt. lib. 9._    _Comment. in Purb. pag. 164._]      [Sidenote 2: _Ex qua parte luna est transpicua non totum secundum    superficiem, sed etiam secundum substantiam, eatenus clara, ex qua    autem parte opaca est, eatenus obscura videtur._ _De Phaenom.    cap. 11._]    The more common and generall opinion[1] is, that the spots are the  thinner parts of the Moone, which are lesse able to reflect the beames  that they receive from the Sunne, and this is most agreeable to reason,  for if the starres are therefore brightest, because they are thicker and  more solid then their orbes, then it will follow, that those parts of  the Moone which have lesse light, have also lesse thickenesse. It was  the providence of nature (say some) that so contrived that planet to  have these spots within it, for since that is neerest to those lower  bodies which are so full of deformity, 'tis requisite that it should in  some measure agree with them, and as in this inferiour world the higher  bodies are the most compleat, so also in the heavens perfection is  ascended unto by degrees, and the Moone being the lowest, must be the  least pure, and therefore _Philo_ the Jew[2] interpreting _Iacobs_  dreame concerning the ladder, doth in an allegory shew, how that in the  fabricke of the world, all things grow perfecter as they grow higher,  and this is the reason (saith hee) why the Moone doth not consist of any  pure simple matter, but is mixed with aire, which shewes so darkely  within her body.      [Sidenote 1: _Albert. mag. de coaevis. Q. 4. Art. 21._    _Colleg. Con._]      [Sidenote 2: _De Somniis._]    But this cannot be a sufficient reason, for though it were true that  nature did frame every thing perfecter as it was higher, yet is it as  true, that nature frames every thing fully perfect for that office to  which shee intends it. Now, had she intended the Moone meerly to reflect  the Sunne beames and give light, the spots then had not so much argued  her providence, as her unskilfulnesse and imperfection,[1] as if in the  haste of her worke shee could not tell how to make that body exactly  fit, for that office to which she appointed it.

(#10)"],[1," eateth not; and let not him which eateth not  judge him that eateth\" (Rom. xiv. 3)! You see here how the Apostle  blames those who, not from religious feeling, but in mere contempt,  neglect and rail at ceremonial observances, and teaches them not to  despise, since this \"knowledge puffeth up.\" Again, he teaches the  pertinacious upholders of these things not to judge their opponents. For  neither party observes towards the other that charity which edifieth. In  this matter we must listen to Scripture, which teaches us to turn aside  neither to the right hand nor to the left, but to follow those right  precepts of the Lord which rejoice the heart. For just as a man is  not righteous merely because he serves and is devoted to works and  ceremonial rites, so neither will he be accounted righteous merely  because he neglects and despises them.    It is not from works that we are set free by the faith of Christ, but  from the belief in works, that is from foolishly presuming to seek  justification through works. Faith redeems our consciences, makes them  upright, and preserves them, since by it we recognise the truth that  justification does not depend on our works, although good works neither  can nor ought to be absent, just as we cannot exist without food and  drink and all the functions of this mortal body. Still it is not on them  that our justification is based, but on faith; and yet they ought not  on that account to be despised or neglected. Thus in this world we  are compelled by the needs of this bodily life; but we are not hereby  justified. \"My kingdom is not hence, nor of this world,\" says Christ;  but He does not say, \"My kingdom is not here, nor in this world.\" Paul,  too, says, \"Though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh\"  (2 Cor. x. 3), and \"The life which I now live in the flesh I live by  the faith of the Son of God\" (Gal. ii. 20). Thus our doings, life, and  being, in works and ceremonies, are done from the necessities of this  life, and with the motive of governing our bodies; but yet we are not  justified by these things, but by the faith of the Son of God.    The Christian must therefore walk in the middle path, and set these two  classes of men before his eyes. He may meet with hardened and obstinate  ceremonialists, who, like deaf adders, refuse to listen to the truth of  liberty, and cry up, enjoin, and urge on us their ceremonies, as if they  could justify us without faith. Such were the Jews of old, who would not  understand, that they might act well. These men we must resist, do just  the contrary to what they do, and be bold to give them offence, lest  by this impious notion of theirs they should deceive many along with  themselves. Before the eyes of these men it is expedient to eat flesh,  to break fasts, and to do in behalf of the liberty of faith things which  they hold to be the greatest sins. We must say of them, \"Let them alone;  they be blind leaders of the blind\" (Matt. xv. 14). In this way Paul  also would not have Titus circumcised, though these men urged it;  and Christ defended the Apostles, who had plucked ears of corn on the  Sabbath day; and many like instances.    Or else we may meet with simple-minded and ignorant persons, weak in  the faith, as the Apostle calls them, who are as yet unable to apprehend  that liberty of faith, even if willing to do so. These we must spare,  lest they should be offended. We must bear with their infirmity, till  they shall be more fully instructed. For since these men do not act thus  from hardened malice, but only from weakness of faith, therefore, in  order to avoid giving them offence, we must keep fasts and do other  things which they consider necessary. This is required of us by charity,  which injures no one, but serves all men. It is not the fault of these  persons that they are weak, but that of their pastors, who by the snares  and weapons of their own traditions have brought them into bondage and  wounded their souls when they ought to have been set free and healed by  the teaching of faith and liberty. Thus the Apostle says, \"If meat make  my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth\" (1  Cor. viii. 13); and again, \"I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus,  that there is nothing unclean of itself; but to him that esteemeth  anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean. It is evil for that man  who eateth with offence\" (Rom. xiv. 14, 20).    Thus, though we ought boldly to resist those teachers of tradition, and  though the laws of the pontiffs, by which they make aggressions on the  people of God, deserve sharp reproof, yet we must spare the timid crowd,  who are held captive by the laws of those impious tyrants, till they  are set free. Fight vigorously against the wolves, but on behalf of the  sheep, not against the sheep. And this you may do by inveighing against  the laws and lawgivers, and yet at the same time observing these laws  with the weak, lest they be offended, until they shall themselves  recognise the tyranny, and understand their own liberty. If you wish to  use your liberty, do it secretly, as Paul says, \"Hast thou faith? have  it to thyself before God\" (Rom. xiv. 22). But take care not to use it in  the presence of the weak. On the other hand, in the presence of tyrants  and obstinate opposers, use your liberty in their despite, and with the  utmost pertinacity, that they too may understand that they are tyrants,  and their laws useless for justification, nay that they had no right to  establish such laws.    Since then we cannot live in this world without ceremonies and works,  since the hot and inexperienced period of youth has need of being  restrained and protected by such bonds, and since every one is bound  to keep under his own body by attention to these things, therefore  the minister of Christ must be prudent and faithful in so ruling and  teaching the people of Christ, in all these matters, that no root of  bitterness may spring up among them, and so many be defiled, as Paul  warned the Hebrews; that is, that they may not lose the faith, and begin  to be defiled by a belief in works as the means of justification. This  is a thing which easily happens, and defiles very many, unless faith be  constantly inculcated along with works. It is impossible to avoid this  evil, when faith is passed over in silence, and only the ordinances of  men are taught, as has been done hitherto by the pestilent, impious,  and soul-destroying traditions of our pontiffs and opinions of our  theologians. An infinite number of souls have been drawn down to hell by  these snares, so that you may recognise the work of antichrist.    In brief, as poverty is imperilled amid riches, honesty amid business,  humility amid honours, abstinence amid feasting, purity amid pleasures,  so is justification by faith imperilled among ceremonies. Solomon says,  \"Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?\"  (Prov. vi. 27). And yet as we must live among riches, business, honours,  pleasures, feastings, so must we among ceremonies, that is among perils.  Just as infant boys have the greatest need of being cherished in the  bosoms and by the care of girls, that they may not die, and yet, when  they are grown, there is peril to their salvation in living among  girls, so inexperienced and fervid young men require to be kept in and  restrained by the barriers of ceremonies, even were they of iron, lest  their weak minds should rush headlong into vice. And yet it would be  death to them to persevere in believing that they can be justified  by these things. They must rather be taught that they have been thus  imprisoned, not with the purpose of their being justified or gaining  merit in this way, but in order that they might avoid wrong-doing, and  be more easily instructed in that righteousness which is by faith, a  thing which the headlong character of youth would not bear unless it  were put under restraint.    Hence in the Christian life ceremonies are to be no otherwise looked  upon than as builders and workmen look upon those preparations for  building or working which are not made with any view of being permanent  or anything in themselves, but only because without them there could be  no building and no work. When the structure is completed, they are laid  aside. Here you see that we do not contemn these preparations, but set  the highest value on them; a belief in them we do contemn, because no  one thinks that they constitute a real and permanent structure. If any  one were so manifestly out of his senses as to have no other object  in life but that of setting up these preparations with all possible  expense, diligence, and perseverance, while he never thought of the  structure itself, but pleased himself and made his boast of these  useless preparations and props, should we not all pity his madness and  think that, at the cost thus thrown away, some great building might have  been raised?    Thus, too, we do not contemn works and ceremonies--nay, we set the  highest value on them; but we contemn the belief in works, which no one  should consider to constitute true righteousness, as do those hypocrites  who employ and throw away their whole life in the pursuit of works, and  yet never attain to that for the sake of which the works are done. As  the Apostle says, they are \"ever learning and never able to come to the  knowledge of the truth\" (2 Tim. iii. 7). They appear to wish to build,  they make preparations, and yet they never do build; and thus they  continue in a show of godliness, but never attain to its power.    Meanwhile they please themselves with this zealous pursuit, and even  dare to judge all others, whom they do not see adorned with such a  glittering display of works; while, if they had been imbued with faith,  they might have done great things for their own and others' salvation,  at the same cost which they now waste in abuse of the gifts of God. But  since "]]]
