Common quick filtering-paper (English) is best for most work  in assaying. The specially prepared paper (Swedish or Rhenish) is used  for collecting those precipitates which have to be weighed. The papers  are folded as shown in fig. 16, and should not project above the funnel.  The filter-paper works better if damped with hot water. In special cases  filtering is hastened by means of an air-pump. The apparatus used  consists of a water-jet (fig. 17), which is connected with the tap, as  also with a bottle fitted as shown in fig. 18. The pump draws the air  out from the bottle, and atmospheric pressure forces the liquid through  the filter-paper. The bottom of the funnel is provided with a platinum  cone, which supports the filter-paper, and prevents its breaking. The  pump is only used in exceptional cases; nearly all the filtrations  required by the assayer can be made without it. The usual methods of  supporting the funnel during filtration are shown in fig. 19. Where the  filtrate is not wanted, pickle bottles make convenient supports. After  the precipitate has been thrown on the filter, it is washed. In washing,  several washings with a small quantity of water are more effective than  a few with a larger quantity of that fluid. The upper edge of the  filter-paper is specially liable to escape complete washing. Excessive  washing must be avoided; the point at which the washing is complete is  found by collecting a little of the filtrate and testing it. The  precipitate is removed from the filter-paper for further treatment by  opening out the paper and by washing the precipitate with a jet of water  from a wash-bottle into a beaker, or back through the funnel into the  flask. In some cases, when the precipitate has to be dissolved in  anything in which it is readily soluble, solution is effected in the  filter itself allowing the liquid to run through as it is formed.    ~Drying and Igniting.~--Precipitates, as a rule, require drying before  being ignited. With small precipitates the filter-paper may be opened  out, and placed on a warm asbestos slab till dry; or the funnel and the  filter with the precipitate is placed in a warm place, and supported by  any convenient means. The heat must never be sufficient to char the  paper. Some precipitates must be dried at a temperature not higher than  100° C. These are placed in the water-oven (fig. 20), and, when  apparently dry, they are taken from the funnel, placed between glasses,  and then left in the oven till they cease to lose weight. Such  precipitates are collected on tared filters. Those precipitates which  will stand a higher temperature are dried in the hot-air oven at a  temperature of from 120° to 150°. The drying is continued until they  appear to be free from moisture, and until the precipitate ceases to  adhere to the filter. In drying sulphides the heat must not be raised to  the melting point of sulphur, since, if there is any free sulphur  present, it fuses and filters through.    [Illustration: FIG. 20.]    The precipitate, having been dried, is transferred to a watch-glass. The  filter-paper is opened out over a sheet of note-paper, and, with a  camel-hair brush, the precipitate is gently brought into the glass. Most  precipitates come away easily, and the transfer can be made without  apparent loss. The watch-glass is covered by the funnel, and the  filter-paper (folded into a quadrant) held by the tweezers and set fire  to with the flame of a Bunsen burner. It is allowed to burn over the  crucible, into which the black bulky ash is allowed to drop, and two or  three drops of nitric acid are then added. The crucible is placed on a  pipe-stem triangle (fig. 21), supported on a tripod. It is at first  heated gently with a Bunsen burner, and afterwards more strongly, until  the residue is free from carbon. It is cooled, and treated with any acid  necessary to convert the small amount of precipitate into the state in  which it is to be weighed; heated again, and cooled. The main  precipitate is transferred to the crucible, and the heating repeated  very gently at first, but more strongly towards the end of the  operation. It is next placed in the muffle, and, after two or three  minutes at a red heat, it is removed and allowed to cool in the  desiccator before weighing. This is for bodies that will bear a red  heat; for those compounds that require a lower temperature the heating  in the muffle is omitted. The muffle used for this purpose must not be  used at the same time for cupelling; a gas muffle (fig. 22), such as one  of Fletcher's, is best. A desiccator (fig. 23) is an air-tight vessel  which prevents access of moisture, &c., to the substance. Usually the  air in it is kept dry by means of a basin containing sulphuric acid.    [Illustration: FIG. 21.]    [Illustration: FIG. 22.]    [Illustration: FIG. 23.]    The crucible is removed from the muffle with the tongs and carried to  the desiccator. It is best, in an office, to have a large desiccator  permanently fixed alongside the balance, into which all substances may  be put before being weighed. The substance is removed from the bench or  muffle in the small hand apparatus generally sold, and carried to the  balance room to be transferred to the large desiccator, where it is  allowed to become thoroughly cold before being weighed. Twenty minutes  is generally the time allowed after ignition before it is advisable to  weigh. Bodies allowed to cool in the air after they have been ignited will  absorb moisture, and hot bodies placed in the balance-pan will disturb  the equilibrium and show false results. Compounds that absorb moisture  must be weighed quickly; they should, therefore, be weighed in covered  vessels. Such compounds are detected by their continually-increasing  weight. They should be ignited and weighed again  in a well-covered dish.    Substances that have been washed with alcohol, ether, or any readily  volatile liquid are dried in the water oven. They quickly dry if there  is no water present, and are generally fit for weighing in less than one  hour. Sometimes drying for a few minutes only will be sufficient.    The weight of the crucible and precipitate having been obtained, the  weight of the crucible and ash is deducted; for example--      Crucible and precipitate    10.183 grams.    Crucible and ash             9.527   \"                                ------                                 0.656   \"    The weight of the ash is best added to that of the crucible. The amount  of ash in filter-papers must not be neglected, although papers are now  made almost free from ash, and the amount to be deducted is found by  taking eight or ten papers and burning them until they become white, and  then weighing the ash. The amount varies from 0.004 to 0.0005 gram for  different papers. Having determined the ash, place in the balance-drawer  three of the filter-papers pinned together, with the weights marked on  them in the way shown in fig. 24, so as to be readily seen when there is  occasion to refer to them.    [Illustration: FIG. 24.]    It must be remembered that the determination of small quantities of  substances generally involves the use of reagents which are often  contaminated, as an impurity, with the body sought for. Thus, in  assaying silver, the oxide of lead or metallic lead used is rarely free  from silver; and in the case of arsenic, the acids, zinc or ferric  chloride are sure to contain arsenic. The same observation applies to  the precipitation of lead by zinc, &c. The errors caused by these  impurities are more marked in the determination of material having small  quantities of metal than in that of ores which contain larger  quantities. Errors of this kind are counteracted or neutralised by  \"blank\" or \"blind\" determinations. These consist in carrying out by the  side of and during the assay a duplicate experiment with the reagents  only, which are thereby subjected to the same processes of solution,  evaporation, filtration, &c. The final result thus obtained is deducted  from that given by the assay, the difference gives the corrected result.  In some cases, where it is desired or necessary to have a tangible  residue or precipitate, some _pure_ inert material is added.          CHAPTER IV.    VOLUMETRIC ASSAYS.      These have been already described as those in which the results are got  by measuring, either--(1) the volume of a reagent required to complete  some reaction, or (2) the volume of the resulting product. For example,  if a permanganate of potash solution be added to a solution containing a  weighed amount of iron, dissolved in sulphuric acid, the strong colour  of the permanganate of potash will be removed until a certain quantity  of it has been added. Repeating the experiment, it will be found that  the same amount of iron decolorises the same volume of the permanganate  solution within certain narrow limits of variation, known as \"error of  experiment.\" This error is due to variation in the method of working and  to slight differences in the weighings and measurings; it is present in  all experimental methods, although the limits of variation are wider in  some than in others. Apart from this error of experiment, however, it is  certain that a given volume of the permanganate of potash solution  corresponds to a definite weight of iron, so that if either is known the  other may be calculated. Similarly, if a known weight of zinc (or of  carbonate of lime) be dissolved in hydrochloric acid, a gas will be  given off which can be measured, and so long as the conditions of the  experiment do not vary, the same weight of zinc (or of carbonate of  lime) gives off the same volume of gas. The weight of the one can be  determined from the volume of the other.    Or, again, the quantity of some substances may be measured by the colour  of their solutions, on the principle that, other things being equal, the  colour of a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18755"],[0,"Summa Theologica, Part II-II (Secunda Secundae) (#10)"],[1,"Mediator of God and men, Jesus Christ.\"    _I answer that,_ As stated above (A. 5; Q. 1, A. 8), the object of  faith includes, properly and directly, that thing through which man  obtains beatitude. Now the mystery of Christ's Incarnation and  Passion is the way by which men obtain beatitude; for it is written  (Acts 4:12): \"There is no other name under heaven given to men,  whereby we must be saved.\" Therefore belief of some kind in the  mystery of Christ's Incarnation was necessary at all times and for  all persons, but this belief differed according to differences of  times and persons. The reason of this is that before the state of  sin, man believed, explicitly in Christ's Incarnation, in so far as  it was intended for the consummation of glory, but not as it was  intended to deliver man from sin by the Passion and Resurrection,  since man had no foreknowledge of his future sin. He does, however,  seem to have had foreknowledge of the Incarnation of Christ, from the  fact that he said (Gen. 2:24): \"Wherefore a man shall leave father  and mother, and shall cleave to his wife,\" of which the Apostle says  (Eph. 5:32) that \"this is a great sacrament . . . in Christ and the  Church,\" and it is incredible that the first man was ignorant about  this sacrament.    But after sin, man believed explicitly in Christ, not only as to the  Incarnation, but also as to the Passion and Resurrection, whereby the  human race is delivered from sin and death: for they would not, else,  have foreshadowed Christ's Passion by certain sacrifices both before  and after the Law, the meaning of which sacrifices was known by the  learned explicitly, while the simple folk, under the veil of those  sacrifices, believed them to be ordained by God in reference to  Christ's coming, and thus their knowledge was covered with a veil, so  to speak. And, as stated above (Q. 1, A. 7), the nearer they were to  Christ, the more distinct was their knowledge of Christ's mysteries.    After grace had been revealed, both learned and simple folk are bound  to explicit faith in the mysteries of Christ, chiefly as regards  those which are observed throughout the Church, and publicly  proclaimed, such as the articles which refer to the Incarnation, of  which we have spoken above (Q. 1, A. 8). As to other minute points in  reference to the articles of the Incarnation, men have been bound to  believe them more or less explicitly according to each one's state  and office.    Reply Obj. 1: The mystery of the Kingdom of God was not entirely  hidden from the angels, as Augustine observes (Gen. ad lit. v, 19),  yet certain aspects thereof were better known to them when Christ  revealed them to them.    Reply Obj. 2: It was not through ignorance that John the Baptist  inquired of Christ's advent in the flesh, since he had clearly  professed his belief therein, saying: \"I saw, and I gave testimony,  that this is the Son of God\" (John 1:34). Hence he did not say: \"Art  Thou He that hast come?\" but \"Art Thou He that art to come?\" thus  saying about the future, not about the past. Likewise it is not to be  believed that he was ignorant of Christ's future Passion, for he had  already said (John 1:39): \"Behold the Lamb of God, behold Him who  taketh away the sins [Vulg.: 'sin'] of the world,\" thus foretelling  His future immolation; and since other prophets had foretold it, as  may be seen especially in Isaias 53. We may therefore say with  Gregory (Hom. xxvi in Evang.) that he asked this question, being in  ignorance as to whether Christ would descend into hell in His own  Person. But he did not ignore the fact that the power of Christ's  Passion would be extended to those who were detained in Limbo,  according to Zech. 9:11: \"Thou also, by the blood of Thy testament  hast sent forth Thy prisoners out of the pit, wherein there is no  water\"; nor was he bound to believe explicitly, before its  fulfilment, that Christ was to descend thither Himself.    It may also be replied that, as Ambrose observes in his commentary on  Luke 7:19, he made this inquiry, not from doubt or ignorance but from  devotion: or again, with Chrysostom (Hom. xxxvi in Matth.), that he  inquired, not as though ignorant himself, but because he wished his  disciples to be satisfied on that point, through Christ: hence the  latter framed His answer so as to instruct the disciples, by pointing  to the signs of His works.    Reply Obj. 3: Many of the gentiles received revelations of Christ, as  is clear from their predictions. Thus we read (Job 19:25): \"I know  that my Redeemer liveth.\" The Sibyl too foretold certain things about  Christ, as Augustine states (Contra Faust. xiii, 15). Moreover, we  read in the history of the Romans, that at the time of Constantine  Augustus and his mother Irene a tomb was discovered, wherein lay a  man on whose breast was a golden plate with the inscription: \"Christ  shall be born of a virgin, and in Him, I believe. O sun, during the  lifetime of Irene and Constantine, thou shalt see me again\" [*Cf.  Baron, Annal., A.D. 780]. If, however, some were saved without  receiving any revelation, they were not saved without faith in a  Mediator, for, though they did not believe in Him explicitly, they  did, nevertheless, have implicit faith through believing in Divine  providence, since they believed that God would deliver mankind in  whatever way was pleasing to Him, and according to the revelation of  the Spirit to those who knew the truth, as stated in Job 35:11: \"Who  teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth.\"  _______________________    EIGHTH ARTICLE [II-II, Q. 2, Art. 8]    Whether It Is Necessary for Salvation to Believe Explicitly in the  Trinity?    Objection 1: It would seem that it was not necessary for salvation to  believe explicitly in the Trinity. For the Apostle says (Heb. 11:6):  \"He that cometh to God must believe that He is, and is a rewarder to  them that seek Him.\" Now one can believe this without believing in the  Trinity. Therefore it was not necessary to believe explicitly in the  Trinity.    Obj. 2: Further our Lord said (John 17:5, 6): \"Father, I have  manifested Thy name to men,\" which words Augustine expounds (Tract.  cvi) as follows: \"Not the name by which Thou art called God, but the  name whereby Thou art called My Father,\" and further on he adds: \"In  that He made this world, God is known to all nations; in that He is  not to be worshipped together with false gods, 'God is known in  Judea'; but, in that He is the Father of this Christ, through Whom He  takes away the sin of the world, He now makes known to men this name  of His, which hitherto they knew not.\" Therefore before the coming of  Christ it was not known that Paternity and Filiation were in the  Godhead: and so the Trinity was not believed explicitly.    Obj. 3: Further, that which we are bound to believe explicitly of God  is the object of heavenly happiness. Now the object of heavenly  happiness is the sovereign good, which can be understood to be in  God, without any distinction of Persons. Therefore it was not  necessary to believe explicitly in the Trinity.    _On the contrary,_ In the Old Testament the Trinity of Persons is  expressed in many ways; thus at the very outset of Genesis it is  written in manifestation of the Trinity: \"Let us make man to Our image  and likeness\" (Gen. 1:26). Therefore from the very beginning it was  necessary for salvation to believe in the Trinity.    _I answer that,_ It is impossible to believe explicitly in the  mystery of Christ, without faith in the Trinity, since the mystery of  Christ includes that the Son of God took flesh; that He renewed the  world through the grace of the Holy Ghost; and again, that He was  conceived by the Holy Ghost. Wherefore just as, before Christ, the  mystery of Christ was believed explicitly by the learned, but  implicitly and under a veil, so to speak, by the simple, so too was  it with the mystery of the Trinity. And consequently, when once grace  had been revealed, all were bound to explicit faith in the mystery of  the Trinity: and all who are born again in Christ, have this bestowed  on them by the invocation of the Trinity, according to Matt. 28:19:  \"Going therefore teach ye all nations, baptizing them in the name of  the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.\"    Reply Obj. 1: Explicit faith in those two things was necessary at all  times and for all people: but it was not sufficient at all times and  for all people.    Reply Obj. 2: Before Christ's coming, faith in the Trinity lay hidden  in the faith of the learned, but through Christ and the apostles it  was shown to the world.    Reply Obj. 3: God's sovereign goodness as we understand it now  through its effects, can be understood without the Trinity of  Persons: but as understood in itself, and as seen by the Blessed, it  cannot be understood without the Trinity of Persons. Moreover the  mission of the Divine Persons brings us to heavenly happiness.  _______________________    NINTH ARTICLE [II-II, Q. 2, Art. 9]    Whether to Believe Is Meritorious?    Objection 1: It would seem that to believe is not meritorious. For  the principle of all merit is charity, as stated above (I-II, Q. 114,  A. 4). Now faith, like nature, is a preamble to charity. Therefore,  just as an act of nature is not meritorious, since we do not merit by  our natural gifts, so neither is an act of faith.    Obj. 2: Further, belief is a mean between opinion and scientific  knowledge or the consideration of things scientifically known  [*Science is a certain knowledge of a demonstrated conclusion through  its demonstration.]. Now the considerations of science are not  meritorious, nor on the other hand is opinion. Therefore belief is  not meritorious.    Obj. 3: Further, he who assents to a point of faith, either has a  sufficient motive for believing, or he has not. If he has a  sufficient motive for his belief, this does not seem to imply any  merit on his part, since "]]]
