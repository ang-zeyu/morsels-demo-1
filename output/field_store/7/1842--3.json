[Illustration: ARROW MACHINE.]    The siege of Veii lasted ten years, and during the last the Alban lake  filled to an unusual height, although the summer was very dry. One of  the Veian soldiers cried out to the Romans half in jest, \"You will  never take Veii till the Alban lake is dry.\" It turned out that there  was an old tradition that Veii should fall when the lake was drained. On  this the senate sent orders to have canals dug to carry the waters to  the sea, and these still remain. Still Veii held out, and to finish the  war a dictator was appointed, Marcus Furius Camillus, who chose for his  second in command a man of one of the most virtuous families in Rome, as  their surname testified, Publius Cornelius, called Scipio, or the Staff,  because either he or one of his forefathers had been the staff of his  father's old age. Camillus took the city by assault, with an immense  quantity of spoil, which was divided among the soldiers.    Camillus in his pride took to himself at his triumph honors that had  hitherto only been paid to the gods. He had his face painted with  vermilion and his car drawn by milk-white horses. This shocked the  people, and he gave greater offence by declaring that he had vowed a  tenth part of the spoil to Apollo, but had forgotten it in the division  of the plunder, and now must take it again. The soldiers would not  consent, but lest the god should be angry with them, it was resolved to  send a gold vase to his oracle at Delphi. All the women of Rome brought  their jewels, and the senate rewarded them by a decree that funeral  speeches might be made over their graves as over those of men, and  likewise that they might be driven in chariots to the public games.    Camillus commanded in another war with the Falisci, also an Etruscan  race, and laid siege to their city. The sons of almost all the chief  families were in charge of a sort of schoolmaster, who taught them both  reading and all kinds of exercises. One day this man, pretending to take  the boys out walking, led them all into the enemy's camp, to the tent of  Camillus, where he told that he brought them all, and with them the  place, since the Romans had only to threaten their lives to make their  fathers deliver up the city. Camillus, however, was so shocked at such  perfidy, that he immediately bade the lictors strip the fellow  instantly, and give the boys rods with which to scourge him back into  the town. Their fathers were so grateful that they made peace at once,  and about the same time the AEqui were also conquered; and the commons  and open lands belonging to Veii being divided, so that each Roman  freeman had six acres, the plebeians were contented for the time.    [Illustration]    The truth seems to have been that these Etruscan nations were weakened  by a great new nation coming on them from the North. They were what the  Romans called Galli or Gauls, one of the great races of the old stock  which has always been finding its way westward into Europe, and they had  their home north of the Alps, but they were always pressing on and on,  and had long since made settlements in northern Italy. They were in  clans, each obedient to one chief as a father, and joining together in  one brotherhood. They had lands to which whole families had a common  right, and when their numbers outgrew what the land could maintain, the  bolder ones would set off with their wives, children, and cattle to  find new homes. The Greeks and Romans themselves had begun first in the  same way, and their tribes, and the claims of all to the common land,  were the remains of the old way; but they had been settled in cities so  long that this had been forgotten, and they were very different people  from the wild men who spoke what we call Welsh, and wore checked tartan  trews and plaids, with gold collars round their necks, round shields,  huge broadswords, and their red or black hair long and shaggy. The  Romans knew little or nothing about what passed beyond their own  Apennines, and went on with their own quarrels. Camillus was accused of  having taken more than his proper share of the spoil of Veii, in  especial a brass door from a temple. His friends offered to pay any fine  that might be laid on him, but he was too proud to stand his trial, and  chose rather to leave Rome. As he passed the gates, he turned round and  called upon the gods to bring Rome to speedy repentance for having  driven him away.    Even then the Gauls were in the midst of a war with Clusium, the city of  Porsena, and the inhabitants sent to beg the help of the Romans, and the  senate sent three young brothers of the Fabian family to try to arrange  matters. They met the Gaulish Bran or chief, whom Latin authors call  Brennus, and asked him what was his quarrel with Clusium or his right to  any part of Etruria. Brennus answered that his right was his sword, and  that all things belonged to the brave, and that his quarrel with the men  of Clusium was, that though they had more land than they could till,  they would not yield him any. As to the Romans, they had robbed their  neighbors already, and had no right to find fault.    This put the Fabian brothers in a rage, and they forgot the caution of  their family, as well as those rules of all nations which forbid an  ambassador to fight, and also forbid his person to be touched by the  enemy; and when the men of Clusium made an attack on the Gauls they  joined in the attack, and Quintus, the eldest brother, slew one of the  chiefs. Brennus, wild as he was, knew these laws of nations, and in  great anger broke up his siege of Clusium, and, marching towards Rome,  demanded that the Fabii should be given up to him. Instead of this, the  Romans made them all three military tribunes, and as the Gauls came  nearer the whole army marched out to meet them in such haste that they  did not wait to sacrifice to the gods nor consult the omens. The  tribunes were all young and hot-headed, and they despised the Gauls; so  out they went to attack them on the banks of the Allia, only seven and  a-half miles from Rome. A most terrible defeat they had; many fell in  the field, many were killed in the flight, others were drowned in trying  to swim the Tiber, others scattered to Veii and the other cities, and a  few, horror-stricken and wet through, rushed into Rome with the sad  tidings. There were not men enough left to defend the walls! The enemy  would instantly be upon them! The only place strong enough to keep them  out was the Capitol, and that would only hold a few people within it! So  there was nothing for it but flight. The braver, stronger men shut  themselves up in the Capitol; all the rest, with the women and children,  put their most precious goods into carts and left the city. The Vestal  Virgins carried the sacred fire, and were plodding along in the heat,  when a plebeian named Albinus saw their state, helped them into his  cart, and took them to the city of Cumae, where they found shelter in a  temple. And so Rome was left to the enemy.          CHAPTER XII.    THE SACK OF ROME.    B.C. 390.      Rome was left to the enemy, except for the small garrison in the Capitol  and for eighty of the senators, men too old to flee, who devoted  themselves to the gods to save the rest, and, arraying themselves in  their robes--some as former consuls, some as priests, some as  generals--sat down with their ivory staves in their hands, in their  chairs of state in the Forum, to await the enemy.    [Illustration: RUINS OF THE FORUM AT ROME.]    In burst the savage Gauls, roaming all over the city till they came to  the Forum, where they stood amazed and awe-struck at the sight of the  eighty grand old men motionless in their chairs. At first they looked at  the strange, calm figures as if they were the gods of the place, until  one Gaul, as if desirous of knowing whether they were flesh and blood  or not, stroked the beard of the nearest. The senator, esteeming this an  insult, struck the man on the face with his staff, and this was the  sign for the slaughter of them all.    Then the Gauls began to plunder every house, dragging out and killing  the few inhabitants they found there; feasting, revelling, and piling up  riches to carry away; burning and overthrowing the houses. Day after day  the little garrison in the Capitol saw the sight, and wondered if their  stock of food would hold out till the Gauls should go away or till their  friends should come to their relief. Yet when the day came round for the  sacrifice to the ancestor of one of these beleaguered men, he boldly  went forth to the altar of his own ruined house on the Quirinal Hill,  and made his offering to his forefathers, nor did one Gaul venture to  touch him, seeing that he was performing a religious rite.    The escaped Romans had rested at Ardea, where they found Camillus, and  were by him formed into an army, but he would not take the generalship  without authority from what was left of the Senate, and that was shut up  in the Capitol in the midst of the Gauls. A brave man, however, named  Pontius Cominius, declared that he could make his way through the Gauls  by night, and climb up the Capitol and down again by a precipice which  they did not watch because they thought no one could mount it, and that  he would bring back the orders of the Senate. He swam the Tiber by the  help of corks, landed at night in ruined Rome among the sleeping enemy,  and climbed up the rock, bringing hope at last to the worn-out and  nearly starving garrison. Quickly they met, recalled the sentence of  banishment against Camillus, and named him Dictator.

We  were now in a country which, in addition to the Mazitu invasion, was  suffering from one of those inexplicable droughts to which limited and  sometimes large portions of this country are subject. It had not been  nearly so severe on the opposite or south side, and thither too the  Mazitu had not penetrated. Rushes, which plagued us nearer the coast,  are not observed now; the grass is all crisp and yellow; many of the  plants are dead, and leaves are fallen off the trees as if winter had  begun. The ground is covered with open forest, with here and there  thick jungle on the banks of the streams. All the rivulets we have  passed are mere mountain torrents filled with sand, in which the  people dig for water.    We passed the spot where an Arab called Birkal was asked payment for  leave to pass. After two and a half days' parley he fought, killed two  Makonde, and mortally wounded a headman, which settled the matter; no  fresh demand has been made. Ali's brother also resisted the same sort  of demand, fought several times, or until three Makonde and two of his  people were killed; they then made peace, and no other exactions have  been made.    _11th May, 1866._--We now found a difficulty in getting our carriers  along, on account of exhaustion from want of food. In going up a sand  stream called Nyede, we saw that all moist spots had been planted with  maize and beans, so the loss caused by the Mazitu, who swept the land  like a cloud of locusts, will not be attended by much actual  starvation. We met a runaway woman: she was seized by Ali, and it was  plain that he expected a reward for his pains. He thought she was a  slave, but a quarter of a mile off was the village she had left, and  it being doubtful if she were a runaway at all, the would-be fugitive  slave-capture turned out a failure.    _12th May, 1866._--About 4' E.N.E. of Matawatawa, or Nyamatolole, our  former turning point.    _13th May, 1866._--We halted at a village at Matawatawa. A  pleasant-looking lady, with her face profusely tattooed, came forward  with a bunch of sweet reed, or _Sorghum saceliaratum_, and laid it at  my feet, saying, \"I met you here before,\" pointing to the spot on the  river where we turned. I remember her coming then, and that I asked  the boat to wait while she went to bring us a basket of food, and I  think it was given to Chiko, and no return made. It is sheer  kindliness that prompts them sometimes, though occasionally people do  make presents with a view of getting a larger one in return: it is  pleasant to find that it is not always so. She had a quiet, dignified  manner, both in talking and walking, and I now gave her a small  looking-glass, and she went and brought me her only fowl and a basket  of cucumber-seeds, from which oil is made; from the amount of oily  matter they contain thov are nutritious when roasted and eaten as  nuts. She made an apology, saying they were hungry times at present. I  gave her a cloth, and so parted with Kanangone, or, as her name may be  spelled, Kananone. The carriers were very useless from hunger, and we  could not buy anything for them; for the country is all dried up, and  covered sparsely with mimosas and thorny acacias.    _14th May, 1866._--I could not get the carriers on more than an hour  and three-quarters: men tire very soon on empty stomachs. We had  reached the village of Hassane, opposite to a conical hill named  Chisulwe, which is on the south side of the river, and evidently of  igneous origin. It is tree-covered, while the granite always shows  lumps of naked rock. All about lie great patches of beautiful  dolomite. It may have been formed by baking of the tufa, which in this  country seems always to have been poured out with water after volcanic  action. Hassane's daughter was just lifting a pot of French beans,  boiled in their pods, off the fire when we entered the village, these  he presented to me, and when I invited him to partake, he replied that  he was at home and would get something, while I was a stranger on a  journey. He, like all the other headmen, is a reputed doctor, and his  wife, a stout old lady, a doctoress; he had never married any wife but  this one, and he had four children, all of whom lived with their  parents. We employed one of his sons to go to the south side and  purchase food, sending at the same time some carriers to buy for  themselves. The siroko and rice bought by Hassane's son we deposited  with him for the party behind, when they should arrive. The amount of  terror the Mazitu inspire cannot be realized by us. They shake their  shields and the people fly like stricken deer. I observed that a child  would not go a few yards for necessary purposes unless grandmother  stood in sight. Matumora, as the Arabs call the chief at Ngomano, gave  them a warm reception, and killed several of them: this probably  induced them to retire.    _15th and 16th May, 1866._--Miserably short marches from hunger, and I  sympathise with the poor fellows. Those sent to buy food for  themselves on the south bank were misled by a talkative fellow named  Chikungu, and went off north, where we knew nothing could be had. His  object was to get paid for three days, while they only loitered here.  I suppose hunger has taken the spirit out of them; but I told them  that a day in which no work was done did not count: they admitted  this. We pay about two feet of calico per day, and a fathom or six  feet for three days' carriage.    _17th May, 1866._--With very empty stomachs they came on a few miles  and proposed to cross to the south side; as this involved crossing the  Luendi too, I at first objected, but in hopes that we might get food  for them we consented, and were taken over in two very small canoes. I  sent Ali and Musa meanwhile to the south to try and get some food. I  got a little green sorghum for them and paid them off. These are the  little troubles of travelling, and scarce worth mentioning. A granitic  peak now appears about 15' off, to the W.S.W. It is called Chihoka.    _18th May, 1866._--At our crossing place metamorphic rocks of a  chocolate colour stood on edge; and in the country round we have  patches of dolomite, sometimes as white as marble. The country is all  dry: grass and leaves crisp and yellow. Though so arid now, yet the  great abundance of the dried stalks of a water-loving plant, a sort of  herbaceous acacia, with green pea-shaped flowers, proves that at other  times it is damp enough. The marks of people's feet floundering in  slush, but now baked, show that the country can be sloppy.    The headman of the village where we spent the night of 17th is a  martyr to rheumatism. He asked for medicine, and when I gave some he  asked me to give it to him out of my own hand. He presented me with a  basket of siroko and of green sorghum as a fee, of which I was very  glad, for my own party were suffering, and I had to share out the  little portion of flour I had reserved to myself.    _19th May, 1866._--Coming on with what carriers we could find at the  crossing place, we reached the confluence without seeing it; and  Matumora being about two miles up the Loendi, we sent over to him for  aid. He came over this morning early,--a tall, well-made man, with a  somewhat severe expression of countenance, from a number of wrinkles  on his forehead. He took us over the Loendi, which is decidedly the  parent stream of the Rovuma, though that as it comes from the west  still retains the name Loendi from the south-west here, and is from  150 to 200 yards wide, while the Rovuma above Matawatawa is from 200  to 250, full of islands, rocks, and sandbanks. The Loendi has the same  character. We can see the confluence from where we cross about 2' to  the north. Both rivers are rapid, shoal, and sandy; small canoes are  used on them, and the people pride themselves on their skilful  management: in this the women seem in no way inferior to the men.    In looking up the Loendi we see a large granitic peak called Nkanje,  some 20 miles off, and beyond it the dim outline of distant highlands,  in which seams of coal are exposed. Pieces of the mineral are found in  Loendi's sands.    Matumora has a good character in the country, and many flee to him  from oppression. He was very polite; sitting on the right bank till  all the goods were carried over, then coming in the same canoe wifn me  himself, he opened a fish basket in a weir and gave me the contents,  and subsequently a little green sorghum. He literally has lost all his  corn, for he was obliged to flee with his people to Marumba, a rocky  island in Rovuma, about six miles above Matawatawa. He says that both  Loendi and Rovuma come out of Lake Nyassa; a boat could not ascend,  however, because many waterfalls are in their course: it is strange if  all this is a myth. Matumora asked if the people through whose country  I had come would preserve the peace I wished. He says he has been  assailed on all sides by slave-hunters: he alone has never hunted for  captives: if the people in front should attack me he would come and  fight them: finally he had never seen a European before (Dr. Roscher  travelled as an Arab), nor could I learn where Likumbu at Ngomano  lives; it was with him that Roscher is said to have left his goods.    The Mazitu had women, children, oxen and goats with them. The whole  tribe lives on plundering the other natives by means of the terror  their shields inspire; had they gone further down the Rovuma, no ox  would have survived the tsetse.    _20th May, 1866._--I paid Ali to his entire satisfaction, and  entrusted him with a despatch, \"No. 2 Geographical,\" and then sent off  four men south to buy food. Here we are among Matambwe. Two of  Matumora's men act as guides. We are about 2' south and by west of the  confluence Ngomano. Lat. 11 deg. 26' 23\" S.; long. 37 deg. 40' 52\" E.
