With the second week lessons began for the children. Each task had its  appointed hour, and they were required to be as systematic, punctual and  well prepared for recitations as pupils in an ordinary school, but at the  same time great care was taken that neither mind nor body should be  overtaxed, and they enjoyed many liberties and indulgences which could not  have been granted elsewhere than at home.    The mornings were spent by Rosie and Lulu in the school-room in study and  recitation, under the supervision of either \"Grandma Elsie\" or \"Mamma Vi.\"    Grace and Walter would be there also at the start, but their short and  easy tasks having been attended to, they might stay and amuse themselves  quietly, or if inclined for noisy sport, go to the nursery or play-room to  enjoy it there.    Max conned his lessons alone in his own room, joining the others only when  the hour arrived for reciting to Mr. Dinsmore, who took sole charge of his  education, and of the two little girls, so far as concerned Latin and  arithmetic. Rosie and Max were together in both these studies, but  Lulu--because of being younger and not so far advanced--was alone in both,  much to her dissatisfaction, for she was by no means desirous to have Mr.  Dinsmore's attention concentrated upon herself for even a short space of  time.    His keen dark eyes seemed to look her through and through, and though he  had never shown her any sternness, she was quite sure he could and would  if she gave him any occasion.    But for that there was no necessity, his requirements being always  reasonable and only such as she was fully capable of meeting. She had a  good mind, quick discernment and retentive memory, and she was quite  resolved to be industrious and to keep her promise to her father to be a  good girl in every way. Also her ambition was aroused to attempt to  overtake her brother and Rosie.    She was moderately fond of study, but had a decided repugnance to plain  sewing, therefore looked ill-pleased enough upon discovering that it was  to be numbered among her daily tasks.    \"I hate sewing!\" she said with a scowl, \"and when I'm old enough to do as  I please, I'll never touch a needle and thread.\"    It was afternoon of their first school day, and the little girls had just  repaired to the school-room in obedience to directions given them on their  dismissal for the morning.    All the ladies of the family were there, gathered cosily about the fire  and the table at which Grandma Elsie was busily cutting out garments that  seemed to be intended for a child, yet were of coarser, heavier material  than any of the family were accustomed to wearing.    \"Perhaps you may change your mind by that time,\" she answered Lulu, with  pleasant tone and smile; \"and I hope you will find it more agreeable now  than you expect. You are a kind-hearted little girl, I know, and when I  tell you these clothes are for a little Indian girl who needs them sadly,  I am quite sure you will be glad to help in making them.\"    Lulu's brow cleared. \"Yes, ma'am,\" she said with a little hesitation, \"if  I could sew nicely, but I can't.\"    \"The more need to learn then, dear. Mamma Vi is basting a seam for you,  and will show you how to sew it.\"    \"And when we all get started there'll be some nice story read aloud, won't  there, mamma?\" asked Rosie.    \"Yes; your sister Elsie will be the reader to-day, and the book Scott's  'Lady of the Lake.'\"    \"Oh, how nice!\" cried Rosie in delight; \"it's such a lovely book, and  sister Elsie's such a beautiful reader.\"    \"In my little sister's opinion,\" laughed Mrs. Leland.    \"And that of all present, I presume,\" said \"Grandma Rose.\"    \"I am fortunate in having so appreciative an audience,\" returned Elsie  gayly.    Lulu had accepted a mute invitation to take a seat by Violet's side.    \"Mamma Vi,\" she whispered with heightened color, \"I can't sew as well as  Gracie, and I'm ashamed to have anybody see my poor work.\"    \"Never mind, dear, we won't show your first attempts, and you will find  this coarse, soft muslin easy to learn on,\" Violet answered in the same  low tone. \"See, this is the way,\" taking a few stitches. \"Your father told  me he wanted his dear little girls to learn every womanly accomplishment,  and I feel sure you will do your best to please him. Take pains, and you  may be able to send him some specimen of your work as a Christmas gift.  Would you not enjoy that?\"    \"Yes, ma'am, yes indeed!\" returned the little girl, setting resolutely to  work.    \"Mamma,\" said Gracie, coming to Violet's other side, \"mayn't I have some  work, too? I like sewing better than Lulu does. Aunt Beulah taught me to  overseam and to hem.\"    \"Then you may help us, little girlie,\" Violet said, kissing the little  fair cheek, \"but must stop the minute you begin to feel fatigued; for I  must not let papa's baby girl wear out her small strength.\"    Presently, all having been supplied with work, the reading began. Every  one seemed able to listen with enjoyment except Lulu, who bent over her  task with frowning face, making her needle go in and out with impatient  pushes and jerks.    Violet watched the performance furtively for a few minutes, then gently  taking the work from her, said in a pleasant undertone, \"You are getting  your stitches too long and too far apart, dear. We will take them out, and  you shall try again.\"    \"I can't do it right! I'll never succeed, if I try ever so hard!\" muttered  Lulu, impatiently.    \"Oh, yes, you will,\" returned Violet with an encouraging smile. \"Keep  trying, and you will be surprised to find how easy it will grow.\"    The second attempt was quite an improvement upon the first, and under  Violet's pleased look and warm praise Lulu's ruffled temper smoothed down,  and the ugly frown left her face.    In the mean while Gracie was handling her needle with the quiet ease of  one accustomed to its use, making tiny even stitches that quite surprised  her new mamma.    With all her faults Lulu was incapable of envy or jealousy, especially  toward her dearly loved brother and sister, and when at the close of the  sewing hour Gracie's work was handed about from one to another, receiving  hearty commendation, no one was better pleased than Lulu.    \"Isn't it nice, Grandma Elsie?\" she said, glancing at her little sister  with a flush of pride in her skill, \"a great deal better than I can do,  though she's two years younger.\"    \"It's only because I couldn't run about and play like Lulu, and so I just  sat beside Aunt Beulah and learned to hem and back-stitch and run and  overseam,\" said Gracie. \"But Lulu can do everything else better than I  can.\"    \"And she will soon equal you in that, I trust,\" said Violet, with an  affectionate glance from one to the other; \"I am quite sure she will if  she continues to try as she has done to-day. And it makes my heart rejoice  to see how you love one another, dear children.\"    \"I think everybody loves Gracie, because she's hardly ever naughty,\" said  Lulu; \"I wish I'd been made so.\"          CHAPTER VIII.        \"Where'er I roam, whatever realms to see,       My heart untravelled fondly turns to thee.\"                              --Goldsmith.      \"How very pretty, Zoe!\" said Violet, examining her young sister-in-law's  work, a piece of black satin upon which she was embroidering leaves and  flowers in bright-colored silks.    \"Oh, isn't it!\" cried Lulu, in delighted admiration. \"Mamma Vi, I'd like  to learn that kind of sewing.\"    \"So you shall, dear, some day; but mamma's theory is that plain sewing  should be thoroughly mastered first. That has been her plan with all her  children, and Rosie has done scarcely any fancy work yet.\"    \"But mamma has promised to let me learn all I can about it this winter,\"  remarked Rosie, with much satisfaction.    \"Mamma,\" Zoe said, with a blush, \"I'm afraid I ought to join your  plain-sewing class. I should be really ashamed to exhibit any of my work  in that line.\"    \"Well, dear child, I shall be glad to receive you as a pupil if you  desire it,\" Elsie returned, giving her a motherly glance and smile.    \"Hark!\" exclaimed Zoe, hastily gathering up her work, her cheeks rosy and  eyes sparkling with pleasure. \"I hear Edward's step and voice,\" and she  tripped out of the room.    \"How fond she is of him!\" Violet remarked, looking after her with a  pleased smile.    \"Yes,\" said her mother, \"it does my heart good to see how they love each  other. And I think we are all growing fond of Zoe.\"    \"Yes, indeed, mamma!\" came in chorus from her three daughters.    \"I'm sure we are; my husband and I as well as the rest,\" added Mrs.  Dinsmore.    \"And, Vi,\" said Elsie Leland laughingly, \"I really think mamma's new sons  are as highly appreciated in the family as her new daughter, and that all  three doat upon their new mother. Mamma, Lester says you are a pattern  mother-in-law, and I answer, 'Of course; mamma is a pattern in every  relation in life.'\"    \"My child, don't allow yourself to become a flatterer,\" returned her  mother gravely.    \"Zoe, Zoe, where are you?\" Edward was calling from below.    \"Here,\" she answered, running down to meet him. \"I've been in the  school-room with mamma and the others,\" she added, as she gained his  side, and looking up brightly into his face as she spoke.    \"Ah,\" he said, bending down to kiss the ruby lips. \"I thought you were to  be my pupil.\"    \"Oh, so I am! except in purely feminine accomplishments. See!\" holding up  her work. \"I've been busy with this. It was the sewing hour, and sister  Elsie read aloud to us while we worked.\"    \"Ah, yes! I have been reader many a time while mamma and sisters plied the  needle.\"    \"How nice! you are such a beautiful reader! But she is almost as good.\"    \"Not only almost, but altogether,\" he returned gayly as he held open the  door of her boudoir for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14916"],[0,"Fairy Tales Every Child Should Know (#10)"],[1," another; I will endeavour to  help you. If you have no mind to learn any handicraft, I will take a  shop for you, furnish it with all sorts of fine stuffs and linens; and  then with the money you make of them you can lay in fresh goods, and  live in an honourable way. Tell me freely what you think of my proposal;  you shall always find me ready to keep my word.\"    This plan just suited Aladdin, who hated work. He told the magician he  had a greater inclination to that business than to any other, and that  he should be much obliged to him for his kindness. \"Well then,\" said the  African magician, \"I will carry you with me to-morrow, clothe you as  handsomely as the best merchants in the city, and afterward we will open  a shop as I mentioned.\"    The widow, after his promises of kindness to her son, no longer doubted  that the magician was her husband's brother. She thanked him for his  good intentions; and after having exhorted Aladdin to render himself  worthy of his uncle's favour, served up supper, at which they talked of  several indifferent matters; and then the magician took his leave and  retired.    He came again the next day, as he had promised, and took Aladdin with  him to a merchant, who sold all sorts of clothes for different ages and  ranks, ready made, and a variety of fine stuffs, and bade Aladdin choose  those he preferred, which he paid for.    When Aladdin found himself so handsomely equipped, he returned his uncle  thanks, who thus addressed him: \"As you are soon to be a merchant, it is  proper you should frequent these shops, and be acquainted with them.\" He  then showed him the largest and finest mosques, carried him to the khans  or inns where the merchants and travellers lodged, and afterward to the  sultan's palace, where he had free access; and at last brought him to  his own khan, where, meeting with some merchants he had become  acquainted with since his arrival, he gave them a treat, to bring them  and his pretended nephew acquainted.    This entertainment lasted till night, when Aladdin would have taken  leave of his uncle to go home; the magician would not let him go by  himself, but conducted him to his mother, who, as soon as she saw him so  well dressed, was transported with joy, and bestowed a thousand  blessings upon the magician.    Early the next morning the magician called again for Aladdin, and said  he would take him to spend that day in the country, and on the next he  would purchase the shop. He then led him out at one of the gates of the  city, to some magnificent palaces, to each of which belonged beautiful  gardens, into which anybody might enter. At every building he came to,  he asked Aladdin if he did not think it fine; and the youth was ready to  answer when any one presented itself, crying out, \"Here is a finer  house, uncle, than any we have yet seen,\" By this artifice, the cunning  magician led Aladdin some way into the country; and as he meant to carry  him farther, to execute his design, he took an opportunity to sit down  in one of the gardens, on the brink of a fountain of clear water, which  discharged itself by a lion's mouth of bronze into a basin, pretending  to be tired: \"Come, nephew,\" said he, \"you must be weary as well as I;  let us rest ourselves, and we shall be better able to pursue our walk.\"          The magician next pulled from his girdle a handkerchief with cakes and  fruit, and during this short repast he exhorted his nephew to leave off  bad company, and to seek that of wise and prudent men, to improve by  their conversation; \"for,\" said he, \"you will soon be at man's estate,  and you cannot too early begin to imitate their example.\" When they had  eaten as much as they liked, they got up, and pursued their walk through  gardens separated from one another only by small ditches, which marked  out the limits without interrupting the communication; so great was the  confidence the inhabitants reposed in each other. By this means the  African magician drew Aladdin insensibly beyond the gardens, and crossed  the country, till they nearly reached the mountains.    At last they arrived between two mountains of moderate height and equal  size, divided by a narrow valley, which was the place where the magician  intended to execute the design that had brought him from Africa to  China. \"We will go no farther now,\" said he to Aladdin; \"I will show you  here some extraordinary things, which, when you have seen, you will  thank me for: but while I strike a light, gather up all the loose dry  sticks you can see, to kindle a fire with.\"    Aladdin found so many dried sticks, that he soon collected a great heap.  The magician presently set them on fire; and when they were in a blaze,  threw in some incense, pronouncing several magical words, which Aladdin  did not understand.    He had scarcely done so when the earth opened just before the magician,  and discovered a stone with a brass ring fixed in it. Aladdin was so  frightened that he would have run away, but the magician caught hold of  him, and gave him such a box on the ear that he knocked him down.  Aladdin got up trembling, and with tears in his eyes said to the  magician, \"What have I done, uncle, to be treated in this severe  manner?\" \"I am your uncle,\" answered the magician; \"I supply the place  of your father, and you ought to make no reply. But child,\" added he,  softening, \"do not be afraid; for I shall not ask anything of you, but  that you obey me punctually, if you would reap the advantages which I  intend you. Know, then, that under this stone there is hidden a  treasure, destined to be yours, and which will make you richer than the  greatest monarch in the world. No person but yourself is permitted to  lift this stone, or enter the cave; so you must punctually execute what  I may command, for it is a matter of great consequence both to you and  me.\"    Aladdin, amazed at all he saw and heard, forgot what was past, and  rising said, \"Well, uncle, what is to be done? Command me, I am ready to  obey.\" \"I am overjoyed, child,\" said the African magician, embracing  him, \"Take hold of the ring, and lift up that stone.\" \"Indeed, uncle,\"  replied Aladdin, \"I am not strong enough; you must help me.\" \"You have  no occasion for my assistance,\" answered the magician; \"if I help you,  we shall be able to do nothing. Take hold of the ring, and lift it up;  you will find it will come easily.\" Aladdin did as the magician bade  him, raised the stone with ease, and laid it on one side.    When the stone was pulled up, there appeared a staircase about three or  four feet deep, leading to a door. \"Descend, my son,\" said the African  magician, \"those steps, and open that door. It will lead you into a  palace, divided into three great halls. In each of these you will see  four large brass cisterns placed on each side, full of gold and silver;  but take care you do not meddle with them. Before you enter the first  hall, be sure to tuck up your robe, wrap it about you, and then pass  through the second into the third without stopping. Above all things,  have a care that you do not touch the walls so much as with your  clothes; for if you do, you will die instantly. At the end of the third  hall, you will find a door which opens into a garden, planted with fine  trees loaded with fruit. Walk directly across the garden to a terrace,  where you will see a niche before you, and in that niche a lighted lamp.  Take the lamp down and put it out. When you have thrown away the wick  and poured out the liquor, put it in your waistband and bring it to me.  Do not be afraid that the liquor will spoil your clothes, for it is not  oil, and the lamp will be dry as soon as it is thrown out.\"    After these words the magician drew a ring off his finger, and put it on  one of Aladdin's, saying, \"It is a talisman against all evil, so long as  you obey me. Go, therefore, boldly, and we shall both be rich all our  lives.\"    Aladdin descended the steps, and, opening the door, found the three  halls just as the African magician had described. He went through them  with all the precaution the fear of death could inspire, crossed the  garden without stopping, took down the lamp from the niche, threw out  the wick and the liquor, and, as the magician had desired, put it in his  waistband. But as he came down from the terrace, seeing it was perfectly  dry, he stopped in the garden to observe the trees, which were loaded  with extraordinary fruit of different colours on each tree. Some bore  fruit entirely white, and some clear and transparent as crystal; some  pale red, and others deeper; some green, blue, and purple, and others  yellow; in short, there was fruit of all colours. The white were pearls;  the clear and transparent, diamonds; the deep red, rubies; the paler,  balas rubies; the green, emeralds; the blue, turquoises; the purple,  amethysts; and the yellow, sapphires. Aladdin, ignorant of their value,  would have preferred figs, or grapes, or pomegranates; but as he had his  uncle's permission, he resolved to gather some of every sort. Having  filled the two new purses his uncle had bought for him with his clothes,  he wrapped some up in the skirts of his vest, and crammed his bosom as  full as it could hold.    Aladdin, having thus loaded himself with riches of which he knew not the  value, returned through the three halls with the utmost precaution, and  soon arrived at the mouth of the cave, where the African magician  awaited him with the utmost impatience. As soon as Aladdin saw him, he  cried out, \"Pray, uncle, lend me your hand, to help me out.\" \"Give me  the lamp first,\" replied the magician; \"it will be troublesome to you,\"  \"Indeed, uncle,\" answered Aladdin, \"I cannot now, but I will as soon as  I am up.\" The African magician was determined that he would have the  lamp before he would help him up; and Aladdin, who had encumbered  himself so much with his fruit that he could not well get at it, refused  to"]]]
