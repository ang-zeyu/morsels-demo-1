It is only quite lately that they have  come at all to see that the Dithyramb was a Spring Song, a primitive  rite. Formerly it was considered to be a rather elaborate form of lyric  poetry invented comparatively late. But, even allowing it is the Spring  Song, are we much further? Why should the Dithyramb be bull-driving? How  can driving a Bull help the spring to come? And, above all, what are the  \"slender-ankled\" Graces doing, helping to drive the great unwieldy Bull?    The difficulty about the Graces, or Charites, as the Greeks called them,  is soon settled. They are the Seasons, or \"Hours,\" and the chief Season,  or Hour, was Spring herself. They are called Charites, or Graces,  because they are, in the words of the Collect, the \"Givers of all  grace,\" that is, of all increase physical and spiritual. But why do they  want to come driving in a Bull? It is easy to see why the Givers of all  grace lead the Dithyramb, the Spring Song; their coming, with their  \"fruits in due season\" is the very gist of the Dithyramb; but why is the  Dithyramb \"bull-driving\"? Is this a mere \"poetical\" epithet? If it is,  it is not particularly poetical.    But Pindar is not, we now know, merely being \"poetical,\" which amounts,  according to some scholars, to meaning anything or nothing. He is  describing, alluding to, an actual rite or _dromenon_ in which a Bull is  summoned and driven to come in spring. About that we must be clear.  Plutarch, the first anthropologist, wrote a little treatise called  _Greek Questions_, in which he tells us all the strange out-of-the-way  rites and customs he saw in Greece, and then asks himself what they  meant. In his 36th _Question_ he asks: \"Why do the women of Elis summon  Dionysos in their hymns to be present with them with his bull-foot?\" And  then, by a piece of luck that almost makes one's heart stand still, he  gives us the very words of the little ritual hymn the women sang, our  earliest \"Bull-driving\" Spring Song:        \"In Spring-time,[25] O Dionysos,        To thy holy temple come;      To Elis with thy Graces,        Rushing with thy bull-foot, come,            Noble Bull, Noble Bull.\"    It is a strange primitive picture--the holy women standing in springtime  in front of the temple, summoning the Bull; and the Bull, garlanded and  filleted, rushing towards them, driven by the Graces, probably three  real women, three Queens of the May, wreathed and flower-bedecked. But  what does it mean?    Plutarch tries to answer his own question, and half, in a dim, confused  fashion, succeeds. \"Is it,\" he suggests, \"that some entitle the god as  'Born of a Bull' and as a 'Bull' himself? ... or is it that many hold  the god is the beginner of sowing and ploughing?\" We have seen how a  kind of _daimon_, or spirit, of Winter or Summer arose from an actual  tree or maid or man disguised year by year as a tree. Did the god  Dionysos take his rise in like fashion from the driving and summoning  year by year of some holy Bull?    First, we must notice that it was not only at Elis that a holy Bull  appears at the Spring Festival. Plutarch asks another instructive  _Question_:[26] \"Who among the Delphians is the Sanctifier?\" And we find  to our amazement that the sanctifier is a Bull. A Bull who not only is  holy himself, but is so holy that he has power to make others holy, he  is the Sanctifier; and, most important for us, he sanctifies by his  death in the month Bysios, the month that fell, Plutarch tells us, \"at  the beginning of spring, the time of the blossoming of many plants.\"    We do not hear that the \"Sanctifier\" at Delphi was \"driven,\" but in all  probability he was led from house to house, that every one might partake  in the sanctity that simply exuded from him. At Magnesia,[27] a city of  Asia Minor, we have more particulars. There, at the annual fair year by  year the stewards of the city bought a Bull, \"the finest that could be  got,\" and at the new moon of the month at the beginning of seedtime they  dedicated it, for the city's welfare. The Bull's sanctified life began  with the opening of the agricultural year, whether with the spring or  the autumn ploughing we do not know. The dedication of the Bull was a  high solemnity. He was led in procession, at the head of which went the  chief priest and priestess of the city. With them went a herald and the  sacrificer, and two bands of youths and maidens. So holy was the Bull  that nothing unlucky might come near him; the youths and maidens must  have both their parents alive, they must not have been under the  _taboo_, the infection, of death. The herald pronounced aloud a prayer  for \"the safety of the city and the land, and the citizens, and the  women and children, for peace and wealth, and for the bringing forth of  grain and of all the other fruits, and of cattle.\" All this longing for  fertility, for food and children, focuses round the holy Bull, whose  holiness is his strength and fruitfulness.    The Bull thus solemnly set apart, charged as it were with the luck of  the whole people, is fed at the public cost. The official charged with  his keep has to drive him into the market-place, and \"it is good for  those corn-merchants who give the Bull grain as a gift,\" good for them  because they are feeding, nurturing, the luck of the State, which is  their own luck. So through autumn and winter the Bull lives on, but  early in April the end comes. Again a great procession is led forth, the  senate and the priests walk in it, and with them come representatives of  each class of the State--children and young boys, and youths just come  to manhood, _epheboi_, as the Greeks called them. The Bull is  sacrificed, and why? Why must a thing so holy die? Why not live out the  term of his life? He dies because he _is_ so holy, that he may give his  holiness, his strength, his life, just at the moment it is holiest, to  his people.         \"When they shall have sacrificed the Bull, let them divide it up       among those who took part in the procession.\"    The mandate is clear. The procession included representatives of the  whole State. The holy flesh is not offered to a god, it is eaten--to  every man his portion--by each and every citizen, that he may get his  share of the strength of the Bull, of the luck of the State.           *       *       *       *       *    Now at Magnesia, after the holy civic communion, the meal shared, we  hear no more. Next year a fresh Bull will be chosen, and the cycle begin  again. But at Athens at the annual \"Ox-murder,\" the _Bouphonia_, as it  was called, the scene did not so close. The ox was slain with all  solemnity, and all those present partook of the flesh, and then--the  hide was stuffed with straw and sewed up, and next the stuffed animal  was set on its feet and yoked to a plough as though it were ploughing.  The Death is followed by a Resurrection. Now this is all-important. We  are so accustomed to think of sacrifice as the death, the giving up, the  renouncing of something. But _sacrifice_ does not mean \"death\" at all.  It means making holy, sanctifying; and holiness was to primitive man  just special strength and life. What they wanted from the Bull was just  that special life and strength which all the year long they had put into  him, and nourished and fostered. That life was in his blood. They could  not eat that flesh nor drink that blood unless they killed him. So he  must die. But it was not to give him up to the gods that they killed  him, not to \"sacrifice\" him in our sense, but to have him, keep him, eat  him, live _by_ him and through him, by his grace.    And so this killing of the sacred beast was always a terrible thing, a  thing they fain would have shirked. They fled away after the deed, not  looking backwards; they publicly tried and condemned the axe that struck  the blow. But their best hope, their strongest desire, was that he had  not, could not, really have died. So this intense desire uttered itself  in the _dromenon_ of his resurrection. If he did not rise again, how  could they plough and sow again next year? He must live again, he  should, he _did_.    The Athenians were a little ashamed of their \"Ox-murder,\" with its  grotesque pantomime of the stuffed, resurrected beast. Just so some of  us now-a-days are getting a little shy of deliberately cursing our  neighbours on Ash Wednesday. They probably did not feel very keenly  about their food-supply, they thought their daily dinner was secure.  Anyhow the emotion that had issued in the pantomime was dead, though  from sheer habit the pantomime went on. Probably some of the less  educated among them thought there \"might be something in it,\" and anyhow  it was \"as well to be on the safe side.\" The queer ceremony had got  associated with the worship of Olympian Zeus, and with him you must  reckon. Then perhaps your brother-in-law was the Ox-striker, and anyhow  it was desirable that the women should go; some of the well-born girls  had to act as water-carriers.    The Ox-murder was obsolete at Athens, but the spirit of the rite is  alive to-day among the Ainos in the remote island of Saghalien. Among  the Ainos the Bear is what psychologists rather oddly call the main  \"food focus,\" the chief \"value centre.\" And well he may be. Bear's flesh  is the Ainos' staple food; they eat it both fresh and salted; bearskins  are their principal clothing; part of their taxes are paid in bear's  fat. The Aino men spend the autumn, winter and spring in hunting the  Bear. Yet we are told the Ainos \"worship the Bear\"; they apply to it the  name _Kamui_, which has been translated god; but it is a word applied to  all strangers, and so only means what catches attention, and hence is  formidable. In the religion of the Ainos \"the Bear plays a chief part,\"  says one writer. The Bear \"receives idolatrous veneration,\" says  another. They \"worship it after their fashion,\" says a third."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17132"],[0,"The Makers of Canada: Champlain (#10)"],[1,"ll. They had been able to procure fresh meat during the whole  season, and consequently scurvy had not made its appearance. \"By  avoiding salt food and using fresh meat, the health is as good here as  in France.\"    The Indians had been waiting from day to day for the return of  Champlain, for they wished him to accompany them to war. He therefore  went ashore to assure them that he would fulfil his promise under the  conditions made, namely, that upon his return they would point out to  him the three rivers, and the lake which they had described as  resembling a sea, the end of which could not be seen, and by means of  which he could return by way of the Saguenay to Tadousac. The Indians  had readily promised to do all this, but only in the following year.  Champlain had also promised the Hurons and Algonquins that he would  assist them in their wars, if they would show him their country, the  great lake and the copper mines. \"I had accordingly,\" he said, \"two  strings to my bow, so that, in case one should break, the other might  hold.\"    On April 25th, 1610, Champlain set out from Tadousac for Quebec, where  he found Captain Chauvin and his companions in good health. They had  with them a stranger named Captain Batiscan, who was so pleased at  Champlain's return that he and his comrades showed their appreciation by  singing and dancing all night. Champlain entertained them at a banquet,  with which they were delighted.    Some days after a party of the Montagnais, numbering about sixty men,  made their appearance at Quebec, _en route_ for the war. They presented  themselves before Champlain, and said: \"Here are numerous Basques and  Mistigoches (so they named the Normans and Malouins) who say they will  go to the war with us. What do you think of it? Do they speak the  truth?\" Champlain answered: \"No, I know very well what they really mean;  they say this only to get possession of your commodities.\" The Indians  replied: \"You have spoken the truth. They are women and want to make war  only upon our beavers.\" Confiding in Champlain's word, the Montagnais  went to Three Rivers under the agreement that a general rendezvous  should be held there with the French. The Hurons were to await them at  the entrance of the Iroquois River.    Champlain started on his journey on June 14th. When he was eight leagues  from Quebec he met a canoe bearing an Algonquin and a Montagnais, who  entreated him to hasten towards Three Rivers, as the Algonquins and  Hurons would be at the meeting-place within two days. The Algonquins  presented Champlain with a piece of copper a foot long and quite pure,  and stated that there were large quantities to be found on the bank of a  river, near a great lake. The Indians also stated that they collected  the copper in lumps, and after they had melted it, spread it in sheets  and smoothed it with stones. Champlain was well pleased to receive this  present, although it was of small value.    The Montagnais assembled at Three Rivers, and on June 18th they all set  out together. On the following day they arrived at an island situated at  the mouth of the river Richelieu, which the Montagnais used to frequent  when they wished to avoid the Iroquois.    An alarm was soon given that the Algonquins had fallen in with a band of  Iroquois, numbering one hundred, who were strongly barricaded. Each man  then took his arms and set out in a canoe towards the enemy. The firing  immediately began, and Champlain was wounded by an arrow which pierced  his ear and entered his neck. He seized the arrow and withdrew it from  the wound. The Iroquois were much astonished at the noise caused by the  discharge of the French muskets, and some of them, seeing their  companions wounded or dead, threw themselves upon the ground whenever  they, heard a musket fired. Champlain resolved after a while to force  the barricade, sword in hand, which he accomplished without much  resistance, and entered the fort. Fifteen prisoners were taken, and the  rest were killed either by musket shots, arrows, or the sword. The  savages, according to their custom, scalped the dead. The Montagnais and  Algonquins had three killed and fifty wounded. On the following day  Pont-Grave and Chauvin did some trading in peltry.    Amongst Champlain's party there was a young lad named Nicholas Marsolet,  who desired to accompany the Algonquins in order to learn their  language, and he was pleased to learn that after much deliberation the  Algonquins had decided to take him, on the condition that Champlain  accepted a young Huron as hostage. The Indian boy was named Savignon by  the French. Lescarbot writes that he met this youth many times in Paris,  and that \"he was a big and stout boy.\"    The French and the allied Indians separated with many promises of  friendship. The Indians departed for the fall of the great river of  Canada, and the French, with Champlain at their head, proceeded to  Quebec. On the return journey they met at Lake St. Peter, Pont-Grave,  who was on his way to Tadousac, to arrange some business connected with  headquarters.    Pont-Grave contemplated passing the winter at Quebec, but in the  meantime des Marets arrived from France, much to the delight of every  one, as his vessel was long overdue. The news which he brought,  however, was so serious that both Champlain and Pont-Grave decided to  return to France. The intelligence received was to the effect that M. de  St. Luc had expelled the Catholics from Brouage, that the king had been  killed, and that the Duke of Sully and two other noblemen had shared the  same fate.    Champlain was much distressed over the condition of affairs in France,  and on his departure he left du Parc in command of Quebec, and placed  under him sixteen men, \"all of whom were enjoined to live soberly, and  in the fear of God, and in strict observance of the obedience due to the  authority of du Parc.\" The settlement was left with a plentiful supply  of kitchen vegetables, together with a sufficient quantity of Indian  corn, wheat, rye and barley. Everything was in good order when Champlain  set out from Quebec on August 8th, five days after Pont-Grave's vessel  sailed from Tadousac for France. On September 27th they arrived at  Honfleur, the voyage having lasted one month and a half.    This second voyage of Champlain did not restore de Monts' fortunes. The  withdrawal of the exclusive privilege of trading was the signal for a  large number of trading vessels to appear in the St. Lawrence. In fact  the operations were so great as to render the profits of the company  null. The disaster was so complete that Champlain says: \"Many will  remember for a long time the loss made this year.\" For all the labour  which Champlain had bestowed upon the settlement the result was small,  and it was evident that if any French merchant were allowed without  restrictions to trade with the Indians, commerce would be ruined, and  the development of the settlement would be impossible. During the first  years a beaver skin could be exchanged in return for two knives, and now  fifteen or twenty were required for the same exchange. Champlain  therefore desired to establish some form of rule by which commerce could  be restricted, or in other words, whereby he or de Monts, or any one  else who would undertake the direction of the affairs of New France,  might be protected.    It was during this winter of 1610-11, that Champlain, who was now more  than forty years of age, entertained thoughts of marriage. His constant  voyages during the past twelve years had probably prevented him from  entering into this estate before. It is, perhaps, somewhat surprising  that he so suddenly put aside this consideration against the marriage.  Did he contemplate residing permanently at Quebec, or did he foresee  that circumstances would render his remaining in New France improbable?  There is nothing in his narrative which throws any light on this  question. Champlain does not mention the name of his wife in any of his  writings, but we find later that she accompanied him to Quebec, where  she dwelt for four years. The name of Champlain's wife was Helene  Boulle, the daughter of Nicholas Boulle, secretary of the king's  chamber, and of Marguerite Alix of St. Germain l'Auxerrois, Paris.  Helene Boulle was born in 1598, and at the time of her marriage she was  only twelve years of age. Her parents were Calvinists, and she was  brought up in the same faith, but through the lessons and influence of  her husband she became a Catholic.    The marriage settlements were executed at Paris on December 27th, 1610,  and signed by Choquillot and Arragon, notaries, in the presence of the  parents and friends of both parties. Among those who attended on that  occasion were Pierre du Gua, friend; Lucas Legendre, of Rouen, friend;  Hercule Rouer, merchant of Paris; Marcel Chenu, merchant of Paris; Jehan  Roernan, secretary of de Monts, Champlain's friend; Francois Lesaige,  druggist of the king's stables, friend and relative; Jehan Ravenel,  Sieur de la Merrois; Pierre Noel, Sieur de Cosigne, friend; Anthoine de  Murad, king's councillor and almoner; Anthoine Marye; Barbier, surgeon,  relative and friend; Genevieve Lesaige, wife of Simon Alix, uncle of  Helene Boulle, on the mother's side.    According to the terms of the contract, Nicholas Boulle and his wife  pledged themselves, by anticipated payment of the inheritance, to pay  six thousand livres cash, the day preceding the marriage. Champlain also  agreed to give his future wife the benefit of his wealth at his death.  Two days after, Nicholas Boulle sent to his son-in-law the sum of four  thousand five hundred livres, the balance was to be sent later on.    The betrothal took place in the church of St. Germain l'Auxerrois, on  Wednesday, December 29th, 1610, and on the following day the marriage  was celebrated in the same church. As the young bride was not of  marriageable age, she returned"]]]
