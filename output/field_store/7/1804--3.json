[1] The circle of  \"enlightened\" Jews in Vilna pledged its support to Lilienthal, and he  left full of faith in the success of his enterprise.    [Footnote 1: Op. Cit. p. 266.]    A cruel disappointment awaited him in Minsk. Here the arguments which  the opponents advanced in a passionate debate at a public meeting were  of a utilitarian rather than of an idealistic nature.      So long as the Government does not accord equal rights to the Jew,    general culture will only he his misfortune. The plain uneducated    Jew does not balk at the low occupation of factor [1] or peddler,    for, drawing comfort and joy from his religion, he is reconciled to    his miserable lot. But the Jew who is educated and enlightened, and    yet has no means of occupying an honorable position in the country,    will be moved by a feeling of discontent to renounce his religion,    and no honest father will think of giving an education to his    children which may lead to such an issue. [2]    [Footnote 1: The Polish name for agent. See Vol. I, p. 170, n. 1.]    [Footnote 2: Quoted from Lilienthal's own account in _Die Allgemeine  Zeitung des Judentums_, 1842, No. 41, p. 605b.]    The opponents of official enlightenment in Minsk were not content with  advancing arguments that appealed to reason. Both at the meeting and in  the street, Lilienthal was the target of insulting remarks from the  crowd.    On his return to St. Petersburg, Lilienthal presented Uvarov with a  report which convinced the Minister that the execution of the  school-reform was a difficult but not a hopeless task.    On June 22, 1842, an imperial rescript was issued, placing all Jewish  schools, including the heders and yeshibahs, under the supervision of  the Ministry of Public Instruction. Simultaneously it was announced that  the Government had summoned a Commission of four Rabbis to meet in St.  Petersburg for the purpose of \"supporting the efforts of the Government\"  in the realization of the school-reform. This Committee was to serve  Russian Jewry as a security that the school-reforms would not be  directed against the Jewish religion.    At the same time Lilienthal was ordered to proceed again to the Pale of  Settlement. He was directed to tour principally through the  South-western and New-Russian governments and exert his influence upon  the Jewish masses in accordance with the instructions received from the  ministry. Before setting out on his journey, Lilienthal published a  Hebrew pamphlet under the title _Maggid Yeshu'ah_ (\"Herald of  Salvation\") which called upon the Jewish communities to comply readily  with the wishes of the Government. In his private letters, addressed to  prominent Jews, Lilienthal expressed the assurance that the school ukase  was merely the forerunner of a series of measures for the betterment of  the civic status of the Jews.    This time Lilienthal met with a greater measure of success than on his  first journey. In several large centers, such as Berdychev, Odessa,  Kishinev, he was accorded, a friendly welcome and assured of the  co-operation of the communities in making the new school system a  success. Filled with fresh hopes, Lilienthal returned in 1843 to St.  Petersburg to participate in the work of the \"Rabbinical Commission\"  which had been convoked by the Government and was now holding its  sessions in the capital from May till August.    The make-up of the Rabbinical Commission did not fully justify its  appellation. Only two \"ecclesiastics\" were on it, the president of the  Talmudic Academy of Volozhin, [1] Rabbi Itzhok (Isaac) Itzhaki, and the  leader of the White Russian Hasidim, Rabbi Mendel Shneorsohn, [2] while  the South-western region and New Russia had sent two laymen: the banker  Halperin of Berdychev, and the director of the Jewish school in Odessa,  Bezalel Stern. The two representatives of the \"clergy\" put up a warm  defence for the traditional Jewish school, the heder, endeavoring to  save it from the ministerial \"supervision,\" which aimed at its  annihilation. Finally a compromise was effected: the traditional heder  was to be left intact for the time being, but the proposed Crown school  was to be given full scope in competing with it. The Commission even  went so far as to work out a program of Jewish studies for the new type  of school.    [Footnote 1: In the government of Vilna. See Vol I, p. 380, et seq.]    [Footnote 2: The grandson of Rabbi Shneor Zalman, the founder of that  faction. See Vol. I, p. 372.]    The labors of the Rabbinical Commission were submitted to the Jewish  Committee, under the chairmanship of Kiselev, and discussed by it in  connection with the general plan of a Russian school-reform. It was  necessary to find the resultant between two opposing forces: between the  desire of the Government to substitute the Russian Crown school for the  old-fashioned Jewish school and the determination of Russian Jewry to  preserve its own school as a bulwark against the official institutions  foisted upon it. The Government was bent on carrying out its policy, and  found itself compelled to resort to diplomatic contrivances.    On November 13, 1844, Nicholas signed two enactments, the one a public  ukase relating to \"the Education of the Jewish Youth.\" the other a  confidential rescript addressed to the Minister of Public Instruction.  The public enactment called for the establishment of Jewish schools of  two grades, corresponding to the courses of instruction in the parochial  and county schools, and ordered the opening of two rabbinical institutes  for the training of rabbis and teachers. The teaching staff in the  Jewish Crown schools was to consist both of Jews and Christians. The  graduates of these schools were granted a reduction in the term of  military service. The execution of the school reforms in the respective  localities was placed in the hands of \"School Boards,\" composed of Jews  and Christians, which were to be appointed provisionally for that  purpose.    In the secret rescript the tone was altogether different. There it was  stated that \"the aim pursued, in the training of the Jews is that of  bringing them nearer to the Christian population and eradicating the  prejudices fostered in them by the study of the Talmud\"; that with the  opening of the new schools the old ones were to be gradually closed or  reorganized, and that as soon as the Crown schools have been established  in sufficient numbers, attendance at them would become obligatory; that  the superintendents of the new schools should only be chosen from among  Christians; that every possible effort should be made \"to put obstacles  in the way of granting teaching licenses\" to the melammeds who lacked a  secular education; that after the lapse of twenty years no one should  hold the position of teacher or rabbi without having obtained his degree  from one of the official rabbinical schools.    It was not long, however, before the secret came out. The Russian Jews  were terror-stricken at the thought of being robbed of their ancient  school autonomy, and decided to adopt the well-tried tactics of passive  resistance to all Government measures. The school-reform was making slow  progress. The opening of the elementary schools and of the two  rabbinical institutes in Vilna and Zhitomir did not begin until 1847,  and for the first few years they dragged on a miserable existence.  Lilienthal himself disappeared from the scene, without waiting for the  consummation of the reform plan. In 1845 he suddenly abandoned his post  at the Ministry of Public Instruction, and left Russia for ever. A more  intimate acquaintance with the intentions of the leading Government  circles had made Lilienthal realize that the apprehensions voiced in his  presence by the old men of the Vilna community were well-founded, and he  thought it his duty to fulfill the pledge given by him publicly. From  the land of serfdom, where, to use Lilienthal's own words, the only way  for the Jew to make peace with the Government was \"by bowing down before  the Greek cross,\" he went to the land of freedom, the United States of  America. There he occupied important pulpits in New York and Cincinnati  where he died in 1882.      3. THE ABOLITION OF JEWISH AUTONOMY AND RENEWED  PERSECUTIONS    No sooner had the school reform, which was tantamount to the abrogation  of Jewish school autonomy, been publicly announced than the Government  took steps to realize the second article of its program, the  annihilation of the remnants of Jewish communal autonomy. An ukase  published on December 19, 1844, ordered \"the placing of the Jews in the  cities and countries under the jurisdiction of the general (i.e.,  Russian) administration, with the abolition of the Kahals.\" By this  ukase all the administrative functions of the Kahals were turned over to  the police departments, and those of an economic and fiscal character to  the municipalities and town councils; the old elective Kahal  administration was to pass out of existence.    Carried to its logical conclusions, this \"reform\" would necessarily have  led, as it actually did lead in Western Europe, to the abolition of the  Jewish community, outside the narrow limits of a synagogue parish, had  the Jews of Russia been placed at the same time on a footing of equality  in regard to _taxation_. But such European consistency was beyond the  mental range of Russian autocracy. It was neither willing to abandon the  special, and for the Jews doubly burdensome, method of conscription, nor  to forego the extra levies imposed upon the Jews, over and above the  general state taxes, for needs which, properly speaking, should have  been met by the exchequer.

The horses, splashing the water, made some noise, but  they were not so careful in that particular now since they had put a  mile between themselves and the grove. In fact, the Panther urged them  to greater speed, careless of the sounds, and they kept in the water for  a full two miles further. Then they quit the stream at a point where the  soil seemed least likely to leave traces of their footsteps, and stood  for a little while upon the prairie, resting and shivering. Then they  started at a rapid pace across the country, pushing for the Rio Grande  until noon. Then Fields stalked and shot an antelope, with which they  renewed their supply of food. In the afternoon it rained heavily, but by  dark they reached the Rio Grande, across which they made a dangerous  passage, as the waters had risen, and stood once more on the soil of  Texas.    \"Thank God!\" said Will.    \"Thank God!\" repeated Ned.    Then they looked for shelter, which all felt they must have.          CHAPTER IV    THE CABIN IN THE WOODS      It proved a difficult matter to find shelter. All the members of the  little group were wet and cold, and a bitter wind with snow began to  whistle once more across the plain. But every one strove to be cheerful  and the relief that their escape had brought was still a tonic to their  spirits. Yet they were not without comment upon their condition.    \"I've seen hard winters in Maine,\" said Obed White, \"but there you were  ready for them. Here it tricks you with warm sunshine and then with  snow. You suffer from surprise.\"    \"We've got to find a cabin,\" said the Panther.    \"Why not make it a whole city with a fine big hotel right in the center  of it?\" said Obed. \"Seems to me there's about as much chance of one as  the other.\"    \"No, there ain't,\" said the Panther. \"There ain't no town, but there are  huts. I've rid over this country for twenty year an' I know somethin'  about it. There are four or five settlers' cabins in the valleys of the  creeks runnin' down to the Rio Grande. I had a mighty good dinner at one  of 'em once. They're more'n likely to be abandoned now owin' to the war  an' their exposed situation, but if the roofs haven't fell in any of 'em  is good enough for us.\"    \"Then you lead on,\" said Obed. \"The quicker we get there the happier all  of us will be.\"    \"I may not lead straight, but I'll get you there,\" replied the Panther  confidently.    Roylston, at his own urgent insistence, dismounted and walked a little  while. When he betook himself again to the back of Old Jack he spoke  with quiet confidence.    \"I'm regaining my strength rapidly,\" he said. \"In a week or two I shall  be as good as I ever was. Meanwhile my debt to you, already great, is  accumulating.\"    The Panther laughed.    \"You don't owe us nothin',\" he said. \"Why, on this frontier it's one  man's business to help another out of a scrape. If we didn't do that we  couldn't live.\"    \"Nevertheless, I shall try to pay it,\" said Roylston, in significant  tones.    \"For the moment we'll think of that hut we're lookin' for,\" said the  Panther.    \"It will be more than a hut,\" said Will, who was of a singularly  cheerful nature. \"I can see it now. It will be a gorgeous palace. Its  name will be the Inn of the Panther. Menials in gorgeous livery will  show us to our chambers, one for every man, where we will sleep between  white sheets of the finest linen.\"    \"I wonder if they will let us take our rifles to bed with us,\" said Ned,  \"because in this country I don't feel that I can part with mine, even  for a moment.\"    \"That is a mere detail which we will discuss with our host,\" said Obed.  \"Perhaps, after you have eaten of the chicken and drunk of the wine at  this glorious Inn of the Panther, you will not be so particular about  the company of your rifle, Mr. Fulton.\"    The Panther uttered a cry of joy.    \"I've got my b'arin's exactly now,\" he said. \"It ain't more'n four miles  to a cabin that I know of, an' if raiders haven't smashed it it'll give  us all the shelter we want.\"    \"Then lead us swiftly,\" said Obed. \"There's no sunset or anything to  give me mystical lore, but the coming of that cabin casts its shadow  before, or at least I want it to do it.\"    The Panther's announcement brought new courage to every one and they  quickened their lagging footsteps. He led toward a dark line of timber  which now began to show through the driving snow, and when they passed  among the trees he announced once more and with exultation:    \"Only a mile farther, boys, an' we'll be where the cabin stands, or  stood. Don't git your feelin's too high, 'cause it may have been wiped  off the face of the earth.\"    A little later he uttered another cry, and this was the most exultant of  all.    \"There she is,\" he said, pointing ahead. \"She ain't been wiped away by  nobody or nothin'. Don't you see her, that big, stout cabin ahead?\"    \"I do,\" said young Allen joyously, \"and it's the Inn of the Panther as  sure as you live.\"    \"But I don't see any smoke coming out of the chimney,\" said Ned, \"and  there are no gorgeous menials standing on the doorstep waiting for us.\"    \"It's been abandoned a long time,\" said the Panther. \"I can tell that by  its looks, but I'm thinkin' that it's good enough fur us an' mighty  welcome. An' there's a shed behind the house that'll do for the horses.  Boys, we're travelin' in tall luck.\"    The cabin, a large one, built of logs and adobe, was certainly a  consoling sight. They had almost reached the limit of physical  endurance, but they broke into a run to reach it. The Panther and Ned  were the first to push open a heavy swinging door, and they entered side  by side. It was dry within. The solid board roof did not seem to be  damaged at all, and the floor of hard, packed earth was as dry as a bone  also. At one end were a wide stone fireplace, cold long since, and a  good chimney of mud and sticks. There were two windows, closed with  heavy clapboard shutters.    There was no furniture in the cabin except two rough wooden benches.  Evidently the original owners had prepared well for their flight, but it  was likely that no one had come since. The lonely place among the trees  had passed unobserved by raiders. The shed behind the cabin was also in  good condition, and they tethered there the horses, which were glad  enough to escape from the bitter wind and driving snow.    The whole party gathered in the cabin, and as they no longer feared  pursuit it was agreed unanimously that they must have luxury. In this  case a fire meant the greatest of all luxuries.    They gathered an abundance of fallen wood, knocked the snow from it and  heaped it on either side of the fireplace. They cut with infinite  difficulty dry shavings from the inside of the logs in the wall of the  house, and after a full hour of hard work lighted a blaze with flint and  steel. The rest was easy, and soon they had a roaring fire. They  fastened the door with the wooden bar which stood in its place and let  the windows remain shut. Although there was a lack of air, they did not  yet feel it, and gave themselves up to the luxury of the glowing heat.    They took off their clothes and held them before the fire. When they  were dry and warm they put them on again and felt like new beings.  Strips of the antelope were fried on the ends of ramrods, and they ate  plentifully. All the chill was driven from their bodies, and in its  place came a deep pervading sense of comfort. The bitter wind yet howled  without and they heard the snow driven against the door and windows.  The sound heightened their feeling of luxury. They were like a troop of  boys now, all of them--except Roylston. He sat on one of the piles of  wood and his eyes gleamed as the others talked.    \"I vote that we enlarge the name of our inn,\" said Allen. \"Since our  leader has black hair and black eyes, let's call it the Inn of the Black  Panther. All in favor of that motion say 'Aye.'\"    \"Aye!\" they roared.    \"All against it say 'no.'\"    Silence.    \"The Inn of the Black Panther it is,\" said Will, \"an' it is the most  welcome inn that ever housed me.\"    The Panther smiled benevolently.    \"I don't blame you boys for havin' a little fun,\" he said. \"It does feel  good to be here after all that we've been through.\"    The joy of the Texans was irrepressible. Fields began to pat and three  or four of them danced up and down the earthen floor of the cabin. Will  watched with dancing eyes. Ned, more sober, sat by his side.    However, the highest spirits must grow calm at last, and gradually the  singing and dancing ceased. It had grown quite close in the cabin now,  and one of the window shutters was thrown open, permitting a rush of  cool, fresh air that was very welcome. Ned looked out. The wind was  still whistling and moaning, and the snow, like a white veil, hid the  trees.    The men one by one went to sleep on the floor. Obed and Fields kept  watch at the window during the first half of the night, and the Panther  and Ned relieved them for the second half. They heard nothing but the  wind, and saw nothing but the snow. Day came with a hidden sun, and the  fine snow still driven by the wind, but the Panther, a good judge of  weather, predicted a cessation of the snow within an hour.    The men awoke and rose slowly from the floor. They were somewhat stiff,  but no one had been overcome, and after a little stretching of the  muscles all the soreness disappeared. The horses were within the shed,  unharmed and warm, but hungry. They relighted the fire and broiled more  strips of the antelope, but they saw that little would be left. The  Panther turned to Roylston, who inspired respect in them all.    \"Now, Mr. Roylston,\" he said, \"we've got to agree upon some course of  action an' we've got to put it to ourselves squar'ly. I take it that all  of us want to serve Texas in one way or another, but"]]]
