While I was thus engaged, I heard that General Buller had relieved  Ladysmith on the 1st of March, that General Gatacre had taken Stormberg  on the 5th, and that General Brabant was driving the Boers before him.    These were the first results of General Cronje's surrender.    But that fatal surrender was not only the undoing of our burghers; it  also reinforced the enemy, and gave him new courage. This was evident  from the reply which Lord Salisbury made to the peace proposals made by  our two Presidents on March 5th. But more of this anon.    Our last day at Poplar Grove was signalized by a visit paid to us by  President Kruger, the venerable chief of the South African Republic. He  had travelled by rail from Pretoria to Bloemfontein; the remaining  ninety-six miles of the journey had been accomplished in a  horse-waggon--he, whom we all honoured so greatly, had been ready to  undergo even this hardship in order to visit us.    The President's arrival was, however, at an unfortunate moment. It was  March the 7th, and Lord Roberts was approaching. His force, extending  over ten miles of ground, was now preparing to attack my burghers, whom  I had posted at various points along some twelve miles of the bank of  the Modder River. It did not seem possible for the old President even to  outspan, for I had received information that the enemy's right wing was  already threatening Petrusburg. But as the waggon had travelled that  morning over twelve miles of a heavy rain-soaked road, it was absolutely  necessary that the horses should be outspanned for rest. But hardly had  the harness been taken off the tired animals when a telegram arrived,  saying that Petrusburg was already in the hands of the English.  President Kruger was thus compelled to return without a moment's delay.  I saw him into his waggon, and then immediately mounted my horse, and  rode to the positions where my burghers were stationed.    Again I was confronted with the baleful influence of Cronje's surrender.  A panic had seized my men. Before the English had even got near enough  to shell our positions to any purpose, the wild flight began. Soon every  position was evacuated. There was not even an attempt to hold them,  though some of them would have been almost impregnable. It was a flight  such as I had never seen before, and shall never see again.    I did all that I could, but neither I nor my officers were able to  prevent the burghers from following whither the waggons and guns had  already preceded them. I tried every means. I had two of the best horses  that a man could wish to possess, and I rode them till they dropped. All  was in vain. It was fortunate for us that the advance of the English was  not very rapid. Had it been so, everything must have fallen into their  hands.    In the evening we came to Abraham's Kraal, a farm belonging to Mr.  Charles Ortel, some eighteen miles from Poplar Grove. The enemy were  encamped about an hour and a half's ride from us.    The next morning the burghers had but one desire, and that was to get  away. It was only with the greatest difficulty that I succeeded in  persuading them to go into position. I then hastened to Bloemfontein, in  order to take counsel with the Government about our affairs generally,  and especially to see what would be the most suitable positions to  occupy for the defence of the capital. Judge Hertzog and I went out  together to inspect the ground; we placed a hundred men in the forts,  with Kaffirs to dig trenches and throw up earthworks.    I was back at Abraham's Kraal by nine o'clock on the morning of March  the 18th. I found that our forces had been placed in position by  Generals De la Rey, Andreas Cronje, Philip Botha, Froneman and Piet de  Wet, the last-named having arrived with his commandos from Colesberg a  few days before the rout at Poplar Grove.    We had not long to wait before fighting began, fighting confined for the  most part to the artillery. The English shells were at first directed  against Abraham's Kraal, which was subjected to a terrific bombardment;  later on they turned their guns upon Rietfontein, where the Transvaalers  and a part of the Free State commandos, under General De la Rey, were  posted. The attack upon these positions was fierce and determined; but  De la Rey's burghers, though they lost heavily, repulsed it with  splendid courage. I will not say more of this. It is understood that  General De la Rey will himself describe what he and his men succeeded in  accomplishing on that occasion.    From ten in the morning until sunset the fight continued, and still the  burghers held their positions. They had offered a magnificent  resistance. Their conduct had been beyond all praise, and it was hard to  believe that these were the same men who had fled panic-stricken from  Poplar Grove. But with the setting of the sun a change came over them.  Once more panic seized them; leaving their positions, they retreated in  all haste towards Bloemfontein. And now they were only a disorderly  crowd of terrified men blindly flying before the enemy.    But it was Bloemfontein that lay before them, and the thought that his  capital was in peril might well restore courage in the most disheartened  of our burghers. I felt that this would be the case, and a picture arose  before me of our men holding out, as they had never done before.    Before going further I must say a few words about the peace proposals  which our Presidents made to the English Government on the 5th of March.  They called God to witness that it was for the independence of the two  Republics, and for that alone, that they fought, and suggested that  negotiations might be opened with the recognition of that independence  as their basis.    Lord Salisbury replied that the only terms he would accept were  unconditional surrender. He asserted, as he did also on many subsequent  occasions, that it was our ultimatum that had caused the war. We have  always maintained that in making this assertion he misrepresented the  facts, to use no stronger term.[24]    Naturally our Government would not consent to such terms, and so the war  had to proceed.    It was decided to send a deputation to Europe. This deputation,  consisting of Abraham Fissher,[25] Cornelius H. Wessels,[26] and Daniel  Wolmarans,[27] sailed from Delagoa Bay.[28]    The reader may ask the object which this deputation had in view. Was it  that our Governments relied on foreign intervention? Emphatically, no!  They never thought of such a thing. Neither in his harangue to the  burghers at Poplar Grove, nor in any of his subsequent speeches, did  President Steyn give any hint of such an intention. The deputation was  sent in order that the whole world might know the state of affairs in  South Africa. It fulfilled its purpose, and was justified by its  results. It helped us to win the sympathy of the nations.    But I must return to my narrative.    A few days before the flight from Poplar Grove, I had appointed Danie  Theron captain of a scouting party. I now left him and his corps behind,  with instructions to keep me informed of Lord Roberts' movements, and  proceeded myself to Bloemfontein. There I disposed the available forces  for defence, and kept them occupied in throwing up _schanzes_. These  _schanzes_ were erected to the west and south of the town, and at  distances of from four to six miles from it.    On the evening of the 12th of March, Lord Roberts appeared, and a few  skirmishes ensued south of the town, but no engagement of any importance  took place. We awaited the morrow with various forebodings.    For myself, I believed that that 13th of March should see a fight to the  finish, cost what it might! for if Bloemfontein was to be taken, it  would only be over our dead bodies.    With this before my eyes, I made all necessary arrangements, riding at  nightfall from position to position, and speaking both to the officers  and to the private burghers. They must play the man, I told them, and  save the capital at any cost. An excellent spirit prevailed amongst  them; on every face one could read the determination to conquer or to  die.    But when, about an hour before midnight, I reached the southern  positions, I heard a very different story. They told me there that  Commandant Weilbach had deserted his post early in the evening. What was  I to do? It was impossible to search for him during the night, and I was  compelled to take burghers away from other commandos, and to place them  in the abandoned positions. On their arrival there, they discovered that  no sooner had Weilbach failed us than the enemy had seized his post--the  key to Bloemfontein! We did all that we could, but our situation had  been rendered hopeless by the action of a Commandant who ought to have  been dismissed out of hand for his conduct at Poplar Grove.    That night I did not close an eye.           *       *       *       *       *    The morning of the 13th of March dawned.    Hardly had the sun risen, when the English in the entrenchments which  Commandant Weilbach had deserted, opened a flank fire on our nearest  positions.    First one position and then another was abandoned by our burghers, who  followed one another's example like sheep; few made any attempt to  defend their posts, and in spite of my efforts and those of the officers  under me, they retreated to the north.    Thus, without a single shot being fired, Bloemfontein fell into the  hands of the English.

The  very stones in the hearth seemed to call out from some remote past,  and the strong sweet smell of burnt wood thrilled to the marrow of her  bones. How little she knew of herself! But she had intelligence enough  to understand that there was a woman in her, the female of the species;  and through that the sensations from logs and stones and earth and fire  had strange power to call up the emotions handed down to her from the  ages. The thrill, the queer heartbeat, the vague, haunting memory of  something, as of a dim childhood adventure, the strange prickling sense  of dread--these abided with her and augmented while she tried to show  Glenn her pride in him and also how funny his cabin seemed to her.    Once or twice he hesitatingly, and somewhat appealingly, she imagined,  tried to broach the subject of his work there in the West. But Carley  wanted a little while with him free of disagreeable argument. It was a  foregone conclusion that she would not like his work. Her intention  at first had been to begin at once to use all persuasion in her power  toward having him go back East with her, or at the latest some time  this year. But the rude log cabin had checked her impulse. She felt that  haste would be unwise.    \"Glenn Kilbourne, I told you why I came West to see you,\" she said,  spiritedly. \"Well, since you still swear allegiance to your girl from  the East, you might entertain her a little bit before getting down to  business talk.\"    \"All right, Carley,\" he replied, laughing. \"What do you want to do? The  day is at your disposal. I wish it were June. Then if you didn't fall in  love with West Fork you'd be no good.\"    \"Glenn, I love people, not places,\" she returned.    \"So I remember. And that's one thing I don't like. But let's not  quarrel. What'll we do?\"    \"Suppose you tramp with me all around, until I'm good and hungry. Then  we'll come back here--and you can cook dinner for me.\"    \"Fine! Oh, I know you're just bursting with curiosity to see how I'll do  it. Well, you may be surprised, miss.\"    \"Let's go,\" she urged.    \"Shall I take my gun or fishing rod?\"    \"You shall take nothing but me,\" retorted Carley. \"What chance has a  girl with a man, if he can hunt or fish?\"    So they went out hand in hand. Half of the belt of sky above was  obscured by swiftly moving gray clouds. The other half was blue and was  being slowly encroached upon by the dark storm-like pall. How cold  the air! Carley had already learned that when the sun was hidden the  atmosphere was cold. Glenn led her down a trail to the brook, where  he calmly picked her up in his arms, quite easily, it appeared, and  leisurely packed her across, kissing her half a dozen times before he  deposited her on her feet.    \"Glenn, you do this sort of thing so well that it makes me imagine you  have practice now and then,\" she said.    \"No. But you are pretty and sweet, and like the girl you were four years  ago. That takes me back to those days.\"    \"I thank you. That's dear of you. I think I am something of a cat....  I'll be glad if this walk leads us often to the creek.\"    Spring might have been fresh and keen in the air, but it had not yet  brought much green to the brown earth or to the trees. The cotton-woods  showed a light feathery verdure. The long grass was a bleached white,  and low down close to the sod fresh tiny green blades showed. The great  fern leaves were sear and ragged, and they rustled in the breeze. Small  gray sheath-barked trees with clumpy foliage and snags of dead branches,  Glenn called cedars; and, grotesque as these were, Carley rather liked  them. They were approachable, not majestic and lofty like the pines, and  they smelled sweetly wild, and best of all they afforded some protection  from the bitter wind. Carley rested better than she walked. The huge  sections of red rock that had tumbled from above also interested Carley,  especially when the sun happened to come out for a few moments and  brought out their color. She enjoyed walking on the fallen pines, with  Glenn below, keeping pace with her and holding her hand. Carley looked  in vain for flowers and birds. The only living things she saw were  rainbow trout that Glenn pointed out to her in the beautiful clear  pools. The way the great gray bowlders trooped down to the brook as if  they were cattle going to drink; the dark caverns under the shelving  cliffs, where the water murmured with such hollow mockery; the low  spear-pointed gray plants, resembling century plants, and which Glenn  called mescal cactus, each with its single straight dead stalk standing  on high with fluted head; the narrow gorges, perpendicularly walled in  red, where the constricted brook plunged in amber and white cascades  over fall after fall, tumbling, rushing, singing its water melody--these  all held singular appeal for Carley as aspects of the wild land,  fascinating for the moment, symbolic of the lonely red man and his  forbears, and by their raw contrast making more necessary and desirable  and elevating the comforts and conventions of civilization. The cave man  theory interested Carley only as mythology.    Lonelier, wilder, grander grew Glenn's canyon. Carley was finally forced  to shift her attention from the intimate objects of the canyon floor  to the aloof and unattainable heights. Singular to feel the difference!  That which she could see close at hand, touch if she willed, seemed to,  become part of her knowledge, could be observed and so possessed and  passed by. But the gold-red ramparts against the sky, the crannied  cliffs, the crags of the eagles, the lofty, distant blank walls, where  the winds of the gods had written their wars--these haunted because  they could never be possessed. Carley had often gazed at the Alps as at  celebrated pictures. She admired, she appreciated--then she forgot.  But the canyon heights did not affect her that way. They vaguely  dissatisfied, and as she could not be sure of what they dissatisfied,  she had to conclude that it was in herself. To see, to watch, to dream,  to seek, to strive, to endure, to find! Was that what they meant? They  might make her thoughtful of the vast earth, and its endless age, and  its staggering mystery. But what more!    The storm that had threatened blackened the sky, and gray scudding  clouds buried the canyon rims, and long veils of rain and sleet began  to descend. The wind roared through the pines, drowning the roar of the  brook. Quite suddenly the air grew piercingly cold. Carley had forgotten  her gloves, and her pockets had not been constructed to protect hands.  Glenn drew her into a sheltered nook where a rock jutted out from  overhead and a thicket of young pines helped break the onslaught of the  wind. There Carley sat on a cold rock, huddled up close to Glenn, and  wearing to a state she knew would be misery. Glenn not only seemed  content; he was happy. \"This is great,\" he said. His coat was open, his  hands uncovered, and he watched the storm and listened with manifest  delight. Carley hated to betray what a weakling she was, so she resigned  herself to her fate, and imagined she felt her fingers numbing into ice,  and her sensitive nose slowly and painfully freezing.    The storm passed, however, before Carley sank into abject and open  wretchedness. She managed to keep pace with Glenn until exercise  warmed her blood. At every little ascent in the trail she found herself  laboring to get her breath. There was assuredly evidence of abundance  of air in this canyon, but somehow she could not get enough of it. Glenn  detected this and said it was owing to the altitude. When they reached  the cabin Carley was wet, stiff, cold, exhausted. How welcome the  shelter, the open fireplace! Seeing the cabin in new light, Carley had  the grace to acknowledge to herself that, after all, it was not so bad.    \"Now for a good fire and then dinner,\" announced Glenn, with the air of  one who knew his ground.    \"Can I help?\" queried Carley.    \"Not today. I do not want you to spring any domestic science on me now.\"  Carley was not averse to withholding her ignorance. She watched Glenn  with surpassing curiosity and interest. First he threw a quantity of  wood upon the smoldering fire.    \"I have ham and mutton of my own raising,\" announced Glenn, with  importance. \"Which would you prefer?\"    \"Of your own raising. What do you mean?\" queried Carley.    \"My dear, you've been so steeped in the fog of the crowd that you are  blind to the homely and necessary things of living. I mean I have here  meat of both sheep and hog that I raised myself. That is to say, mutton  and ham. Which do you like?\"    \"Ham!\" cried Carley, incredulously.    Without more ado Glenn settled to brisk action, every move of which  Carley watched with keen eyes. The usurping of a woman's province by  a man was always an amusing thing. But for Glenn Kilbourne--what more  would it be? He evidently knew what he wanted, for every movement was  quick, decisive. One after another he placed bags, cans, sacks, pans,  utensils on the table. Then he kicked at the roaring fire, settling some  of the sticks. He strode outside to return with a bucket of water, a  basin, towel, and soap. Then he took down two queer little iron pots  with heavy lids. To each pot was attached a wire handle. He removed the  lids, then set both the pots right on the fire or in it. Pouring water  into the basin, he proceeded to wash his hands. Next he took a large  pail, and from a sack he filled it half full of flour. To this he added  baking powder and salt. It was instructive for Carley to see him run  his skillful fingers all through that flour, as if searching for lumps.  After this he knelt before the fire and, lifting off one of the iron  pots with a forked stick, he proceeded to wipe out the inside of the pot  and grease it with a piece of fat. His "]]]
