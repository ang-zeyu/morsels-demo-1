The colour also  helps to make an almost perfect unity of these two figures--we have the  same white and solid flesh tints, strong and delicate; the same warm and  always luminous shadows. Indeed, Jesus is confounded with Mary, so to  speak, so that the two forms together make one and the same body, and,  moreover, the Saviour at need may get rid of his majestic nakedness  beneath the veil and in the mantle of Mary.    This Virgin, in which Raphael has surpassed himself, was painted in a  moment of veritable exaltation of genius. It was not laboriously  conceived; it was born of itself, spontaneously complete, like the  antique Minerva, with its perfect form and beauty, and it was the  recompense for an entire life consecrated without intermission to the  search after nature and truth, to the study of the masters and all the  traditions, to the cult of the ideal and especially of the Virgin.    After having produced so many rare masterpieces, his love and faith were  carried to such a pitch of power and enthusiasm that he seemed to be  borne up by them, and, suddenly penetrating into a sphere superior to  all he had hitherto visited, he painted a Virgin incomparably more  beautiful than all the admirable Virgins he had painted before. Not a  single design, nor preparatory study, puts us on the trace of any  bringing forth of any of the parts of this picture.    However, if the image of this Virgin was traced on the canvas by a hand  suddenly inspired, I think that at the same time Raphael confronted his  inspiration with nature, and that, whilst resolutely springing towards  the infinite, he yet set himself face to face with reality. Perhaps,  strictly, he would have had no need of that; he had amassed so much, his  memory placed such numerous, varied, and exact documents at the service  of his will, that he had only to remember in order almost immediately to  produce an accomplished whole. Moreover, he had the model he wanted,  possessing without dominating it; and without losing sight of his ideal,  it was to this model that he applied himself for the embodiment of his  idea. Thus, in the Virgin of St. Sixtus, we recognize, not the image of  La Fornarina, but the transfiguration of her image. None of her features  are left and yet it is she, but so purified that no trouble nor shadow  comes to dim the radiant and virginal brightness of the picture. In  every human creature there is a divine germ that cannot flourish on  earth and whose blossoming is only in the skies; this is the flowering,  the splendour of which is shown in the Virgin of St. Sixtus. We care  very little about Raphael's private life; we only affirm in the presence  of his work that as a painter he did not love for this life only, and  that from the beginning to the end of his career he had the respect and  the taste for eternal love. Since the day when the Virgin appeared  transfigured to the seer of the Apocalypse, she had never revealed  herself in such effulgence. Before this picture, we lose every memory of  earth and see nothing but the Queen of Heaven and of the angels, the  creature elect and blessed above all creatures. In thus painting the  Virgin, Raphael has almost reached the confines of divinity.    But everything in this picture is food for admiration, even the  atmosphere that envelops it and those innumerable and endless legions of  cherubin that gravitate around the Virgin and the Word of God. The  aureole that encircles the divine group shows nothing at first but  dazzling and golden light; then, as it recedes from the centre, this  light gradually pales and insensibly merges from the most intense gold  into the purest blue, and is filled with those heads, chaste, innocent,  and fervent, that spring beneath the brush of Raphael like the flowers  at the breath of Spring. These aerial creatures throng to contemplate  the Virgin, and their forms recall those radiances in the shape of  crowns that fill the Dantesque Paradise, making the name of Mary resound  with their praises. Our eyes and mind lose themselves in the immense  multitude of these happy spirits. \"Number if you can the sands of the  sea or the stars in the sky, those that are visible and invisible, and  still believe that you have not attained the number of the angels. It  costs God nothing to multiply the most excellent things, and it is the  most beautiful of which he is most prodigal.\" We cannot keep our eyes  away from that sky; we gaze at it and love to dazzle and weary our eyes  with it.    On either side of the Virgin, kneel St. Sixtus and St. Barbara. Placed  also amid the clouds, but below the Madonna, they are near the sovereign  mediatrix, as mediators also between the world and the Sovereign Judge.  St. Sixtus is seen on the right in profile, his head is raised towards  the Infant Jesus, his left hand is placed devoutly on his breast while  his right is foreshortened and points towards the spectator. He wears a  white rochet tied by a girdle with golden tassels, a white amice around  his neck, a magnificent pallium woven with gold falling to his feet, and  a long chasuble embroidered with gold and lined with red enveloping his  shoulders and arms, the wide folds of which are lost amid the clouds.  His head is bare, and his white tiara, adorned with the triple crown, is  placed on the balustrade that runs horizontally across the base of the  picture. It is impossible to find a representation of pontifical  sovereignty of greater fervour, grandeur, and truth. His cranium is bald  and has only a crown of grey hair remaining. His emaciated face is full  of ardour and power: his eyes penetrate straight into the splendour of  God; and his mouth, although partially hidden by the grey beard that  covers the lower part of his face, is praying with extraordinary  fervour. His gesture, so resolute and respectful, is in itself an act of  love and charity, and his very hands, so true in drawing and so bold in  action, have their special eloquence. It seems impossible that the  divine justice will not allow itself to be swayed by such intercession.    St. Barbara is opposite St. Sixtus. Her body is in left profile, towards  the Virgin, while her head, turned over her left shoulder towards the  spectator, appears almost in full face. Only her left arm and hand are  visible, pressed against her breast. Her left knee, directly resting  upon the cloud, sustains the weight of her body; her right leg, which  is raised, only touches the clouds with the foot. Her head is as  beautiful, youthful, and fresh as the action of her whole figure is  easy, elegant, and noble. Then where did Raphael find this serenity if  not in himself? The saint, gently bending towards the earth, seems to  want to receive our hopes and vows to bear them to Heaven. She is one of  those virgins who are created in the image of the Virgin par excellence.  Nevertheless, here she affects certain worldly appearances which, beside  the severe simplicity of the Mother of the Word, establish a hierarchy  between the two figures and a sort of line of demarcation that cannot be  crossed. The higher we soar the more is grandeur simplified in  everything.    St. Barbara's hair is arranged with a certain elegance; it is very  abundant, of an ash blonde, and forms thick waving bands that are  gathered off the temples and are crossed by two white fillets, one of  which crosses the top of the forehead like a diadem. Her eyes, lowered  towards the earth, are perfectly beautiful; her mouth is calm and sweet;  and purity shines in all her features. Her shoulders are bare, only  covered with a veil of white gauze which falls down her back, passes  under her arm and returns to her breast where her left hand holds it.  Her robe of violet shading into a neutral tint, is only visible where it  covers her leg; for a green mantle, thrown over it, envelops the body,  only revealing the arm, the sleeve of which is blue on the upper arm,  yellow, and slightly puffed at the shoulder, and yellow also on the  forearm. All this is of a grand air and in exquisite taste. Thus draped,  the figure has a charming effect which, without detracting from the  religious idea, leaves room also for a more human sentiment.    Raphael, doubtless, had thought that the figures of the Virgin, the  Infant Jesus, St. Sixtus, and St. Barbara would alone be sufficient for  his picture; but the empty space remaining beneath the feet of the  Madonna was too considerable to be filled up simply by clouds: and  therefore he added that rigid and horizontal supporting bar on which two  angels lean upon their elbows, contemplating the glory of the Virgin  with such rapture. In fact, these angels seem to be painted as an  afterthought, for, laid in with a light brush, they scarcely cover the  clouds, but allow the underlying pigment to show through.    Little wings of vivid tint complete these aerial creatures, always  living around Raphael and always ready to come from his brush. Although  held to nature by the most intimate ties, although perhaps too familiar  in attitude and manner, they are yet supernatural by the clearness of  their intelligence and by the power of their admiration. We are  enchanted with their candour and beauty. They are full of zeal and  enthusiasm; they possess the grace of the Pagan Loves merged into  Christian innocence and chastity. Their faith is as beautiful as the  sky, and in loving them it is almost for God himself that we feel the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/175"],[0,"The Phantom of the Opera (#10)"],[1,"ages, the village festival and dances, he went off  with his fiddle, as in the old days, and was allowed to take his  daughter with him for a week.  They gave the smallest hamlets music to  last them for a year and slept at night in a barn, refusing a bed at  the inn, lying close together on the straw, as when they were so poor  in Sweden.  At the same time, they were very neatly dressed, made no  collection, refused the halfpence offered them; and the people around  could not understand the conduct of this rustic fiddler, who tramped  the roads with that pretty child who sang like an angel from Heaven.  They followed them from village to village.    One day, a little boy, who was out with his governess, made her take a  longer walk than he intended, for he could not tear himself from the  little girl whose pure, sweet voice seemed to bind him to her.  They  came to the shore of an inlet which is still called Trestraou, but  which now, I believe, harbors a casino or something of the sort.  At  that time, there was nothing but sky and sea and a stretch of golden  beach.  Only, there was also a high wind, which blew Christine's scarf  out to sea.  Christine gave a cry and put out her arms, but the scarf  was already far on the waves.  Then she heard a voice say:    \"It's all right, I'll go and fetch your scarf out of the sea.\"    And she saw a little boy running fast, in spite of the outcries and the  indignant protests of a worthy lady in black.  The little boy ran into  the sea, dressed as he was, and brought her back her scarf.  Boy and  scarf were both soaked through.  The lady in black made a great fuss,  but Christine laughed merrily and kissed the little boy, who was none  other than the Vicomte Raoul de Chagny, staying at Lannion with his  aunt.    During the season, they saw each other and played together almost every  day.  At the aunt's request, seconded by Professor Valerius, Daae  consented to give the young viscount some violin lessons.  In this way,  Raoul learned to love the same airs that had charmed Christine's  childhood.  They also both had the same calm and dreamy little cast of  mind.  They delighted in stories, in old Breton legends; and their  favorite sport was to go and ask for them at the cottage-doors, like  beggars:    \"Ma'am ...\" or, \"Kind gentleman ... have you a little story to tell us,  please?\"    And it seldom happened that they did not have one \"given\" them; for  nearly every old Breton grandame has, at least once in her life, seen  the \"korrigans\" dance by moonlight on the heather.    But their great treat was, in the twilight, in the great silence of the  evening, after the sun had set in the sea, when Daae came and sat down  by them on the roadside and, in a low voice, as though fearing lest he  should frighten the ghosts whom he evoked, told them the legends of the  land of the North.  And, the moment he stopped, the children would ask  for more.    There was one story that began:    \"A king sat in a little boat on one of those deep, still lakes that  open like a bright eye in the midst of the Norwegian mountains ...\"    And another:    \"Little Lotte thought of everything and nothing.  Her hair was golden  as the sun's rays and her soul as clear and blue as her eyes.  She  wheedled her mother, was kind to her doll, took great care of her frock  and her little red shoes and her fiddle, but most of all loved, when  she went to sleep, to hear the Angel of Music.\"    While the old man told this story, Raoul looked at Christine's blue  eyes and golden hair; and Christine thought that Lotte was very lucky  to hear the Angel of Music when she went to sleep.  The Angel of Music  played a part in all Daddy Daae's tales; and he maintained that every  great musician, every great artist received a visit from the Angel at  least once in his life.  Sometimes the Angel leans over their cradle,  as happened to Lotte, and that is how there are little prodigies who  play the fiddle at six better than men at fifty, which, you must admit,  is very wonderful.  Sometimes, the Angel comes much later, because the  children are naughty and won't learn their lessons or practise their  scales.  And, sometimes, he does not come at all, because the children  have a bad heart or a bad conscience.    No one ever sees the Angel; but he is heard by those who are meant to  hear him.  He often comes when they least expect him, when they are sad  and disheartened.  Then their ears suddenly perceive celestial  harmonies, a divine voice, which they remember all their lives.  Persons who are visited by the Angel quiver with a thrill unknown to  the rest of mankind.  And they can not touch an instrument, or open  their mouths to sing, without producing sounds that put all other human  sounds to shame.  Then people who do not know that the Angel has  visited those persons say that they have genius.    Little Christine asked her father if he had heard the Angel of Music.  But Daddy Daae shook his head sadly; and then his eyes lit up, as he  said:    \"You will hear him one day, my child!  When I am in Heaven, I will send  him to you!\"    Daddy was beginning to cough at that time.    Three years later, Raoul and Christine met again at Perros.  Professor  Valerius was dead, but his widow remained in France with Daddy Daae and  his daughter, who continued to play the violin and sing, wrapping in  their dream of harmony their kind patroness, who seemed henceforth to  live on music alone.  The young man, as he now was, had come to Perros  on the chance of finding them and went straight to the house in which  they used to stay.  He first saw the old man; and then Christine  entered, carrying the tea-tray. She flushed at the sight of Raoul, who  went up to her and kissed her.  She asked him a few questions,  performed her duties as hostess prettily, took up the tray again and  left the room.  Then she ran into the garden and took refuge on a  bench, a prey to feelings that stirred her young heart for the first  time.  Raoul followed her and they talked till the evening, very shyly.  They were quite changed, cautious as two diplomatists, and told each  other things that had nothing to do with their budding sentiments.  When they took leave of each other by the roadside, Raoul, pressing a  kiss on Christine's trembling hand, said:    \"Mademoiselle, I shall never forget you!\"    And he went away regretting his words, for he knew that Christine could  not be the wife of the Vicomte de Chagny.    As for Christine, she tried not to think of him and devoted herself  wholly to her art.  She made wonderful progress and those who heard her  prophesied that she would be the greatest singer in the world.  Meanwhile, the father died; and, suddenly, she seemed to have lost,  with him, her voice, her soul and her genius.  She retained just, but  only just, enough of this to enter the CONSERVATOIRE, where she did not  distinguish herself at all, attending the classes without enthusiasm  and taking a prize only to please old Mamma Valerius, with whom she  continued to live.    The first time that Raoul saw Christine at the Opera, he was charmed by  the girl's beauty and by the sweet images of the past which it evoked,  but was rather surprised at the negative side of her art.  He returned  to listen to her.  He followed her in the wings.  He waited for her  behind a Jacob's ladder.  He tried to attract her attention.  More than  once, he walked after her to the door of her box, but she did not see  him.  She seemed, for that matter, to see nobody.  She was all  indifference.  Raoul suffered, for she was very beautiful and he was  shy and dared not confess his love, even to himself.  And then came the  lightning-flash of the gala performance: the heavens torn asunder and  an angel's voice heard upon earth for the delight of mankind and the  utter capture of his heart.    And then ... and then there was that man's voice behind the door--\"You  must love me!\"--and no one in the room...    Why did she laugh when he reminded her of the incident of the scarf?  Why did she not recognize him?  And why had she written to him? ...    Perros was reached at last.  Raoul walked into the smoky sitting-room  of the Setting Sun and at once saw Christine standing before him,  smiling and showing no astonishment.    \"So you have come,\" she said.  \"I felt that I should find you here,  when I came back from mass.  Some one told me so, at the church.\"    \"Who?\" asked Raoul, taking her little hand in his.    \"Why, my poor father, who is dead.\"    There was a silence; and then Raoul asked:    \"Did your father tell you that I love you, Christine, and that I can  not live without you?\"    Christine blushed to the eyes and turned away her head.  In a trembling  voice, she said:    \"Me?  You are dreaming, my friend!\"    And she burst out laughing, to put herself in countenance.    \"Don't laugh, Christine; I am quite serious,\" Raoul answered.    And she replied gravely:  \"I did not make you come to tell me such  things as that.\"    \"You 'made me come,' Christine; you knew that your letter would not  leave me indignant and that I should hasten to Perros.  How can you  have thought that, if you did not think I loved you?\"    \"I thought you would remember our games here, as children, in which my  father so often joined.  I really don't know what I thought...  Perhaps  I was wrong to write to you ... This anniversary and your sudden  appearance in my room at the Opera, the other evening, reminded me of  the time long past and made me write to you as the little girl that I  then was...\"    There was something in Christine's attitude that seemed to Raoul not  natural.  He did not feel any hostility in her; far from it: the  distressed affection shining in her eyes told him that.  But why was  this affection distressed?  That was what he wished to know and what  was irritating him.    \"When you saw me in your dressing-room, was that the first time you  noticed me,"]]]
