Her purpose, in regard to this paper roofing, was to keep out any  possible dripping that might come through the earth roof in wet  weather, and to store up and multiply the heat from her body.  Terrific  heat, to be sure; nevertheless important in the scheme of things.  When  all was completed, this city, this mighty kingdom, measured about one  and a half inches round.    When all was completed, also, the wasp flew out for a drink and a feed.  But first she cleaned.  The most fastidious cat was a grimy tramp in  comparison to her in habits, and in all her spare time--goodness alone  knows how she squeezed in any spare time at all during those hustling  days!--her first, and generally her last, act was to clean.  She could  not afford dirt.  To be dirty, with her, was to die even more quickly  than she would, anyway; for, you see, she did not breathe through her  mouth, but all over herself, so to speak--through her armor, or  hair-like tubes in that same.    From bluebell to cowslip and lily she picked her way, sipping honey and  humming a wicked little hum through her teeth, as it were, and on to  where      Daisies pied, and violets blue,    And cuckoo buds of yellow hue,    And lady-smocks all silver white,    Do paint the meadows with delight.      Now she toyed with a yellow oxlip, now paused at a purple lungwort; but  most she went into the garden, and hovered, still as a humming-bird,  among the rose-leaves and branches, especially those growing against  the sun-bathed old wooden porch, and for so long that one wondered what  she was doing there.  She was licking up the \"honey-dew,\" which,  translated, is the juice exuded by the plant-lice or \"green-fly,\" which  swarmed all over the rose-trees.  This \"honey-dew\" was sweet, and in  great demand among such insects as had tastes that way; in fact, the  enterprising ants--who are always a decade ahead of everybody  else--were, in one place, building mud sheds over the said herds of  plant-lice to prevent their precious \"honey-dew\" being exploited by  others.    Thus a week passed, the queen fussing daily about her embryo city,  adding paper covering here, strengthening a wall there, warning off an  inquisitive insect somewhere else, and adding her heat to the natural  stuffiness of the place, though one would scarcely have thought she  could have made much difference.  At times, too, in the hot sun, she  appeared here or there outside, drinking honey from some flower, or  sipping \"honey-dew,\" much to the ants' disgust and anger.    Then, at the end of the week, the first egg hatched out within the  city, and, frankly, what came forth was not lovely.  It was a legless  grub, fat, presumably blind, and helpless; and it would have fallen  head downwards out of the cell, as it hatched, if it had not had the  sense to hook its tail into its own egg-shell, which in turn, as we  know, was already fastened to the top of the cell.  But it had jaws,  and in addition, apparently, an appetite to use them.    Whether the queen loved it, her first baby, was hard to tell.  Did she,  indeed, ever love anything?  She certainly did her duty by it; but what  was the use of setting up to be a queen, anyway, if she could not do  that?  And, moreover, you've got to do your duty in the wild.  There's  no profit in monkeying with Nature, as is possible with civilization,  for the penalty thereof is death.    Wherefore did our queen, after making quite sure that the sack-like  atom with a mouth, hanging upside-down in the cell, and wriggling like  anything to show its hunger, was alive, sound, and quite all there,  quit home in a hurry, and with a loud buzz, in search of rations.  But  there was a change in her manner from that adopted when looking for  food for herself, and for good reason.  _Then_ her object had been  honey; now it was--scalps!    From force of habit, more perhaps than from force of reasoning, she  flew to the rose-trees, and there fixed in her shear jaws not more than  two of the helpless, fool, unarmed, soft, juicy green-fly, which are  really no more, if one may so put it, than living, infinitesimal  \"white\" grapes.  That she was challenged by a sentry ant--about as big  to her as a bulldog to us--that the sentry gave the alarm, that the  guard turned out from one of the ants' \"cowsheds\" over some of the  green-fly, and that she went away in a hurry, with half-a-dozen furious  ants on their hindlegs, trying to get hold of her retiring feet with  their jaws, was a matter treated by her with insolent unconcern.    She had got her scalps, and winging home in a hurry to her baby, fed it  upon green-fly.  The baby did not feed nicely, and the picture of the  glistening, corsleted devil queen-mother, with her lugubrious,  mask-like face, and the wriggling, hanging sack babe, and the luckless,  fool, helpless green-fly between them, was not a pretty one.  Here  maternity was not a Sunday-sermon subject, yet it was maternity all the  same.    By this time other eggs in other cells were splitting, and giving out  legless grub horrors, as seeds that give forth plants, each wriggling  mummy taking care to hook itself up to its shell by the tail at once,  lest it perish.  And the queen's work from that moment really began.  Till then she had only tinkered at it, apparently.  Now she got going  \"real some,\" and--well, all the insect world outside knew it.  The  terror of the yellow flag spread.    Upon an hour she would appear, dropping, hawk-like and terrible, out of  the sun-glare, and neatly pick up a soft and juicy caterpillar from a  cabbage-stalk.  Upon another hour she would be discovered, feet tucked  up and wary, darting, like an iridescent gleam, around the angry ants,  among the green-fly on the rose-bushes.  The drowsy hum of the kettle  on the kitchen fire, and the steady, low hum of the house-fly dance in  the middle of the room, would be answered in the long, hot afternoons  by her wicked warning drone as she came sailing in at the open window,  like the insolent pirate that she was, to go out again a minute later  with a helpless fly between her jaws.  The first heat of the sun,  drinking up the dew, would discover her sailing forth to war; his full,  sizzling rays would reveal her waging violent warfare with the  bluebottle flies over some carcass; into his amber light of the noon  her yellow flag would suddenly rise from out the cool shade of the  larder, where she had been carving meat, and \"when the sun mended his  twisted copper nets,\" he would flash in bronze from her glistening  cuirass as she droned by high over some wriggling grub, caterpillar, or  palsied fly fast locked in her jaws--and all for her young, all for her  couple of dozen legless horrors, hanging by their tails, each in its  narrow cell, in darkness and in dead silence, in the embryo city under  the secret earth.    Time was when these same grubs grew so fat and big that they no longer  hung, but became fast wedged in their dormitories; time when the queen  had to set to and extend downwards the wall of each cell lest the  growing inmates bulge over, and, obsessed with their ravening hunger,  incontinently eat each other; and time at last when, one after the  other, each grub, having grown out of more than one suit of clothes and  donned new ones, cast its skin for the last time, refused all further  food, spun a cocoon of silk with a dome-shaped silken floor to each  cell, and for a period retired from the prying eyes of the world, even  of its own mother, into the sacred sanctuary of the chrysalis state.  Then the queen's labor lightened a little for a period, so that you  could again see her at spare moments sucking nectar from the flowers  for herself, robbing the jam-dish, or lapping up the \"honey-dew\" of the  green-fly.    Finally came _the_ day.  It dawned all right, and there was nothing  about it to show that it was going to be different from any other fine  day; yet, as soon as the wasp woke up, she knew that, for her, it was  the day of Fate.    A very cursory inspection of the budding city showed at once that  during the night things had been happening and changes taking place.  The domed floors of several of the cells were palpitating with life  from within, and there were sounds of the gnawing and tearing of the  silken screens.    The queen became greatly excited, and began to hum and dance a little  step-dance to herself, all alone in the darkness among the cells, as  she saw her triumph evolving before her eyes.  And, almost as if the  hum had called it, there rushed at her, out of the blackness across the  comb, a--a thing.    She knew by instinct that it was an enemy.  Indeed, it could not well  be anything else, but it fought like a black devil.    It was, in point of fact, a mole-cricket, a creature just like its  namesake, if an insect can be said to resemble an animal, only that its  jaws were like unto the jaws of a lobster.  It was a fearsome  apparition, and very much larger even than the queen.  The good God  alone knoweth why it had chosen that moment and place to run apparently  amok.    But, if the mole-cricket ran amok, the queen-wasp went berserk.

Concert pitch is nearly a half step higher than this. Some  manufacturers still tune their instruments to this higher pitch.    If it is desired to tune a piano to a certain pitch, say concert  pitch, tune the C that is an octave above middle C by a concert pitch  tuning-fork or pipe. If, however, the piano is too much below that, it  is not safe to bring it up to it at one tuning. But, say it will  permit tuning to concert pitch; after this C (3C) is well laid, tune  middle C (2C) by it, then tune the C octave below middle C (1C) to  middle C. Having 1C for a starting point, proceed by tuning a fifth  up, then its octave, then a fifth, then an octave, always tuning the  octave whichever way is necessary to keep within the two octaves.    The simplicity of this system can be readily seen; yet for the use of  beginners, we give on the following page the whole succession of  intervals as they are taken in setting the temperament.

By this, tune 2C, and by 2C tune 1C; then tune as follows:        By  1C         tune 1G    fifth above,       \"  1G          \"   2G     octave above,       \"  1G          \"   2D    fifth above,       \"  2D          \"   1D     octave below,      By  1D         tune 1A    fifth above,      \"   1A          \"   2A     octave above,      \"   1A          \"   2E    fifth above,      \"   2E          \"   1E     octave below,      \"   1E          \"   1B    fifth above,      \"   1B          \"   2B     octave above,      \"   1B          \"   2F[#] fifth above,      \"   2F[#]       \"   1F[#]  octave below,      \"   1F[#]       \"   2C[#] fifth above,      \"   2C[#]       \"   1C[#]  octave below,      \"   1C[#]       \"   1G[#] fifth above,      \"   1G[#]       \"   2G[#]  octave above,      \"   1G[#]       \"   2D[#] fifth above,      \"   2D[#]       \"   1D[#]  octave below,      \"   1D[#]       \"   1A[#] fifth above,      \"   1A[#]       \"   2A[#]  octave above,      \"   1A[#](B[b]) \"   2F    fifth above,      \"   2F          \"   1F     octave below,      \"   1F        try   2C    fifth above.    You will observe this last fifth brings you back to the starting-point  (C). It is called the \"wolf,\" from the howling of its beats when the  tuner has been inaccurate or the piano fails to stand.      QUESTIONS ON LESSON VIII.        1. What is the cause of the beats or pulsations?        2. Have you practiced tuning the unison?        3. Can you distinguish the beats clearly?        4. Have you practiced tuning the octave?        5. Do you thoroughly understand the system of setting the      temperament as set forth in this lesson?          LESSON IX.    ~SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS IN TEMPERAMENT SETTING.~      ~Pitch.~--It is a matter of importance in tuning an instrument that it  be tuned to a pitch that will adapt it to the special use to which it  may be subjected. As previously explained, there are at present two  different pitches in use, international pitch and concert pitch, the  latter being about a half-step higher than the former. The tuner  should carry with him a tuning pipe or fork tuned to 3C in one or the  other of these pitches. The special uses to which pianos are subjected  are as follows:    1st, As a concert piano.--In the opera house, music hall, and  occasionally in the church, or even in a private dwelling, the piano  is used along with orchestral instruments. All orchestral instruments  are supposed to be tuned to concert pitch. The stringed instruments  can, of course, be tuned to any pitch; but the brass and wood-wind  instruments are not so adjustable. The brass instruments are provided  with a tuning slide and their pitch can be lowered somewhat, but  rarely as much as a half-step, while the clarinet should not be varied  from its fixed pitch if it can be avoided. It is desirable, then, that  all pianos used with orchestra should be tuned to concert pitch if  possible.    2d, As an accompaniment for singing.--Some persons use their pianos  mainly for accompanying. It may be that singers cannot sing high, in  which case they are better pleased if the piano is tuned to  international pitch, while others, especially concert singers, have  their pianos at a higher pitch. Where a piano is used in the home to  practice by, and the singer goes out to various places to sing with  other instruments, we have always advised to have the piano tuned as  near concert pitch as it would bear, for the reason that if one  practices with an instrument tuned to concert pitch he may feel sure  of reaching the pitch of any instrument he may be called upon to sing  with elsewhere.    The great majority of pianos are left entirely to the tuner's judgment  in regard to pitch. The tuner knows, or should know, to what pitch to  tune the piano to insure the best results. The following suggestions  will be found entirely safe to follow in deciding the question of the  pitch to which to tune:    Ascertain if the piano is used with orchestra, and if clarinets and  cornets are used. If so, and the piano is not too much below concert  pitch, and bids fair to stand the tension, draw your 3C up to concert  pitch and proceed to lay your temperament. If the piano is nearly as  low as international pitch, do not try to bring it up at one tuning to  concert unless the owner demands it, when you may explain that it will  not stand in tune long. The slightest alteration possible, in the  pitch of an instrument, insures the best results, so far as standing  in tune is concerned.    If everything be left to your judgment, as it generally is, and the  instrument is for general, rather than special use, set your  temperament at such a pitch as will require the least possible  alteration. This may be arrived at in the following way: Ascertain  which portion of the instrument has fallen the most. The overstrung  bass strings generally stand better than any other, and in most cases  you will find the C which is two octaves below middle C to be higher  (relatively) than any other C in the piano. If so, take it as a basis  and tune by perfect octaves up to 3C.    The supposition is, that all strings in an instrument gradually grow  flatter; and in a well-balanced instrument they should do so; but the  fact is, that in certain cases some of the strings will grow sharper.  The cause is this: The tension of the strings on one side of a brace  in the metal plate or frame is greater than on the other side; and if  there is any yielding of the structure, the result is that the  overpowered strings are drawn tighter. This condition, however, is  rare in the better grade of pianos. Here is a rule which is safe, and  will prove satisfactory in ninety-nine per cent. of your practice  where no specific pitch is prescribed:    Take the three Cs included in the temperament and the C that is an  octave below 1C, and try each of them with its octave until you  ascertain which is the sharpest with respect to the others; then,  bring the others up to it. You now have your pitch established in the  Cs and can begin on 1C and proceed to set the temperament. Before  applying this rule, it is well to try 3C with tuning pipe or fork to  see if the piano is below international pitch. We would not advise  tuning any modern piano below international pitch. Aim to keep within  the bounds of the two prescribed pitches; never higher than concert,  nor lower than international. If, however, you should be called on to  tune an old instrument that has become extremely low, with very rusty  strings, and perhaps with some of them broken, that by all appearances  will not stand even international pitch, you may be compelled to leave  it somewhat below.    ~The Continuous Mute.~--Do not try to set a temperament without a  continuous mute. Its purpose is to mute all outside (1st and 3d[C])  strings of all the trios included in the temperament so that none but  the middle strings sound when struck by the hammers. The advantage of  this can be seen at once. The tuner tunes only the middle strings in  setting the temperament and thereby avoids the confusion of hearing  more than two strings at once. The continuous mute is then removed and  the outside strings tuned to the middle. Without the continuous mute,  he would be obliged to tune all three of the strings of the unison  before he could tune another interval by it, and it would not be so  safe to tune by as a single string, as there might be a slight  discrepancy in the unison giving rise to waves which would confuse the  ear. The tuner should hear but two strings at once while setting a  temperament; the one he is tuning by and the one he is tuning. A  continuous mute is a strip of muting felt of the proper thickness to  be pushed in between the trios of strings. Simply lay it across a  portion of the strings and with a screwdriver push it in between the  trios just above where the hammers strike. In the square piano, which  has but two strings to a key, the continuous mute cannot be used and  you will be obliged to tune both strings in unison before leaving to  tune another interval. This is one of the reasons"]]]
