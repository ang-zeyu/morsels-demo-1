Like other poets of lofty genius, he possessed a firm assurance of the  immortality of his fame. \"A rose,\" says he, \"may continue to bloom for  five or six days, but this Rose-Garden will flourish for ever\"; and  again: \"These verses and recitals of mine will endure after every  particle of my dust has been dispersed.\" Six centuries have passed away  since the gifted sage penned his _Gulistan_, and his fame has not only  continued in his own land and throughout the East generally, but has  spread into all European countries, and across the Atlantic, where long  after the days of Saadi \"still stood the forests primeval.\"          ORIENTAL WIT AND HUMOUR.      Sport that wrinkled Care derides,    And Laughter shaking both his sides.--_L' Allegro_.          I    MAN A LAUGHING ANIMAL--ANTIQUITY OF POPULAR JESTS--\"NIGHT AND DAY\"--THE  PLAIN-FEATURED BRIDE--THE HOUSE OF CONDOLENCE--THE BLIND MAN'S WIFE--TWO  WITTY PERSIAN LADIES--WOMAN'S COUNSEL--THE TURKISH JESTER: IN THE  PULPIT; THE CAULDRON; THE BEGGAR; THE DRUNKEN GOVERNOR; THE ROBBER; THE  HOT BROTH--MUSLIM PREACHERS AND MUSLIM MISERS.      Certain philosophers have described man as a cooking animal, others as a  tool-making animal, others, again, as a laughing animal. No creature  save man, say the advocates of the last definition, seems to have any  \"sense of humour.\" However this may be, there can be little doubt that  man in all ages of which we have any knowledge has possessed that  faculty which perceives ridiculous incongruities in the relative  positions of certain objects, and in the actions and sayings of  individuals, which we term the \"sense of the ludicrous.\" It is not to be  supposed that a dog or a cat--albeit intelligent creatures, in their own  ways--would see anything funny or laughable in a man whose sole attire  consisted in a general's hat and sash and a pair of spurs! Yet _that_  should be enough to \"make even a cat laugh\"! Certainly laughter is  peculiar to our species; and gravity is as certainly not always a token  of profound wisdom; for      The gravest beast's an ass;      The gravest bird's an owl;    The gravest fish's an oyster;      And the gravest man's a _fool_.    Many of the great sages of antiquity were also great humorists, and  laughed long and heartily at a good jest. And, indeed, as the Sage of  Chelsea affirms, \"no man who has once heartily and wholly laughed can be  altogether, irreclaimably bad. How much lies in laughter!--the cipher  key wherewith we decipher the whole man!... The man who cannot laugh is  not only fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils, but his whole life is  already a treason and a stratagem.\" Let us, then, laugh at what is  laughable while we are yet clothed in \"this muddy vesture of decay,\"  for, as delightful Elia asks, \"Can a ghost laugh? Can he shake his gaunt  sides if we be merry with him?\"    It is a remarkable fact that a considerable proportion of the familiar  jests of almost any country, which are by its natives fondly believed to  be \"racy of the soil,\" are in reality common to other peoples widely  differing in language and customs. Not a few of these jests had their  origin ages upon ages since--in Greece, in Persia, in India. Yet they  must have set out upon their travels westward at a comparatively early  period, for they have been long domiciled in almost every country of  Europe. Nevertheless, as we ourselves possess a goodly number of droll  witticisms, repartees, and jests, which are most undoubtedly and beyond  cavil our own--such as many of those which are ascribed to Sam Foote,  Harry Erskine, Douglas Jerrold, and Sydney Smith; though they have been  credited with some that are as old as the jests of Hierokles--so there  exist in what may be termed the lower strata of Oriental fiction,  humorous and witty stories, characteristic of the different peoples  amongst whom they originated, which, for the most part, have not yet  been appropriated by the European compilers of books of facetiae, and a  selection of such jests--choice specimens of Oriental Wit and  Humour--gleaned from a great variety of sources, will, I trust, amuse  readers in general, and lovers of funny anecdotes in particular.           *       *       *       *       *    To begin, then--_place aux dames_! In most Asiatic countries the ladies  are at a sad discount in the estimation of their lords and masters,  however much the latter may expatiate on their personal charms, and in  Eastern jests this is abundantly shown. For instance, a Persian poet,  through the importunity of his friends, had married an old and very ugly  woman, who turned out also of a very bad temper, and they had constant  quarrels. Once, in a dispute, the poet made some comparisons between his  aged wife and himself and between Night and Day. \"Cease your nonsense,\"  said she; \"night and day were created long before us.\" \"Hold a little,\"  said the husband. \"I know they were created long before me, but whether  before _you_, admits of great doubt!\" Again, a Persian married, and, as  is customary with Muslims, on the marriage night saw his bride's face  for the first time, when she proved to be very ugly--perhaps  \"plain-looking\" were the more respectful expression. A few days after  the nuptials, she said to him: \"My life! as you have many relatives, I  wish you would inform me before which of them I may unveil.\" (Women of  rank in Muslim countries appear unveiled only before very near  relations.) \"My soul!\" responded the husband, \"if thou wilt but conceal  thy face from _me_, I care not to whom thou showest it.\" And there is a  grim sort of humour in the story of the poor Arab whose wife was going  on a visit of condolence, when he said to her: \"My dear, if you go, who  is to take care of the children, and what have you left for them to  eat?\" She replied: \"As I have neither flour, nor milk, nor butter, nor  oil, nor anything else, what can I leave?\" \"You had better stay at home,  then,\" said the poor man; \"for assuredly _this_ is the true house of  condolence.\" And also in the following: A citizen of Tawris, in  comfortable circumstances, had a daughter so very ugly that nothing  could induce any one to marry her. At length he resolved to bestow her  on a blind man, hoping that, not seeing her personal defects, he would  be kind to her. His plan succeeded, and the blind man lived very happily  with his wife. By-and-by, there arrived in the city a doctor who was  celebrated for restoring sight to many people, and the girl's father was  urged by his friends to engage this skilled man to operate upon his  son-in-law, but he replied: \"I will take care to do nothing of the kind;  for if this doctor should restore my son-in-law's eyesight, _he_ would  very soon restore my daughter to me!\"    But occasionally ladies are represented as giving witty retorts, as in  the story of the Persian lady who, walking in the street, observed a man  following her, and turning round enquired of him: \"Why do you follow me,  sir?\" He answered: \"Because I am in love with you.\" \"Why are you in love  with me?\" said the lady. \"My sister is much handsomer than I; she is  coming after me--go and make love to her.\" The fellow went back and saw  a woman with an exceedingly ugly face, upon which he at once went after  the lady, and said to her: \"Why did you tell me what was not true?\"  \"Neither did you speak the truth,\" answered she; \"for if you were really  in love with me, you would not have turned to see another woman.\" And  the Persian poet Jami, in his _Baharistan_, relates that a man with a  very long nose asked a woman in marriage, saying: \"I am no way given to  sloth, or long sleeping, and I am very patient in bearing vexations.\" To  which she replied: \"Yes, truly: hadst thou not been patient in bearing  vexations thou hadst not carried that nose of thine these forty years.\"    The low estimation in which women are so unjustly held among Muhammedans  is perhaps to be ascribed partly to the teachings of the Kuran in one or  two passages, and to the traditional sayings of the Apostle Muhammad,  who has been credited (or rather _discredited_) with many things which  he probably never said. But this is not peculiar to the followers of the  Prophet of Mecca: a very considerable proportion of the Indian fictions  represent women in an unfavourable light--fictions, too, which were  composed long before the Hindus came in contact with the Muhammedans.  Even in Europe, during mediaeval times, _maugre_ the \"lady fair\" of  chivalric romance, it was quite as much the custom to decry women, and  to relate stories of their profligacy, levity, and perversity, as ever  it has been in the East. But we have changed all that in modern times:  it is only to be hoped that we have not gone to the other  extreme!--According to an Arabian writer, cited by Lane, \"it is  desirable, before a man enters upon any important undertaking, to  consult ten intelligent persons among his particular friends; or if he  have not more than five such friends let him consult each twice; or if  he have not more than one friend he should consult him ten times, at ten  different visits [he would be 'a friend indeed,' to submit to so many  consultations on the same subject]; if he have not one to consult let  him return to his wife and consult her, and whatever she advises him to  do let him do the contrary, so shall he proceed rightly in his affair  and attain his object.\"[25] We may suppose this Turkish story, from the  _History of the Forty Vezirs_, to be illustrative of the wisdom of such  teaching: A man went on the roof of his house to repair it, and when he  was about to come down he called to his wife, \"How should I come down?\"  The woman answered, \"T"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16955"],[0,"Three Translations of The Koran (Al-Qur'an) side (#10)"],[1," the  Scripture know that (this revelation) is the Truth from their Lord. And  Allah is not unaware of what they do.    S: Indeed We see the turning of your face to heaven, so We shall surely  turn you to a qiblah which you shall like; turn then your face towards  the Sacred Mosque, and wherever you are, turn your face towards it, and  those who have been given the Book most surely know that it is the  truth from their Lord; and Allah is not at all heedless of what they  do.    002.145  Y: Even if thou wert to bring to the people of the Book all the Signs  (together), they would not follow Thy Qibla; nor art thou going to  follow their Qibla; nor indeed will they follow each other's Qibla. If  thou after the knowledge hath reached thee, Wert to follow their (vain)  desires,-then wert thou Indeed (clearly) in the wrong.    P: And even if thou broughtest unto those who have received the  Scripture all kinds of portents, they would not follow thy qiblah, nor  canst thou be a follower of their qiblah; nor are some of them  followers of the qiblah of others. And if thou shouldst follow their  desires after the knowledge which hath come unto thee, then surely wert  thou of the evil-doers.    S: And even if you bring to those who have been given the Book every  sign they would not follow your qiblah, nor can you be a follower of  their qiblah, neither are they the followers of each other's qiblah,  and if you follow their desires after the knowledge that has come to  you, then you shall most surely be among the unjust.    002.146  Y: The people of the Book know this as they know their own sons; but  some of them conceal the truth which they themselves know.    P: Those unto whom We gave the Scripture recognise (this revelation) as  they recognise their sons. But lo! a party of them knowingly conceal  the truth.    S: Those whom We have given the Book recognize him as they recognize  their sons, and a party of them most surely conceal the truth while  they know (it).    002.147  Y: The Truth is from thy Lord; so be not at all in doubt.    P: It is the Truth from thy Lord (O Muhammad), so be not thou of those  who waver.    S: The truth is from your Lord, therefore you should not be of the  doubters.    002.148  Y: To each is a goal to which Allah turns him; then strive together (as  in a race) Towards all that is good. Wheresoever ye are, Allah will  bring you Together. For Allah Hath power over all things.    P: And each one hath a goal toward which he turneth; so vie with one  another in good works. Wheresoever ye may be, Allah will bring you all  together. Lo! Allah is Able to do all things.    S: And every one has a direction to which he should turn, therefore  hasten to (do) good works; wherever you are, Allah will bring you all  together; surely Allah has power over all things.    002.149  Y: From whencesoever Thou startest forth, turn Thy face in the direction  of the sacred Mosque; that is indeed the truth from the Lord. And Allah  is not unmindful of what ye do.    P: And whencesoever thou comest forth (for prayer, O Muhammad) turn thy  face toward the Inviolable Place of Worship. Lo! it is the Truth from  thy Lord. Allah is not unaware of what ye do.    S: And from whatsoever place you come forth, turn your face towards the  Sacred Mosque; and surely it is the very truth from your Lord, and  Allah is not at all heedless of what you do.    002.150  Y: So from whencesoever Thou startest forth, turn Thy face in the  direction of the sacred Mosque; and wheresoever ye are, Turn your face  thither: that there be no ground of dispute against you among the  people, except those of them that are bent on wickedness; so fear them  not, but fear Me; and that I may complete My favours on you, and ye May  (consent to) be guided;    P: Whencesoever thou comest forth turn thy face toward the Inviolable  Place of Worship; and wheresoever ye may be (O Muslims) turn your faces  toward it (when ye pray) so that men may have no argument against you,  save such of them as do injustice - Fear them not, but fear Me! - and  so that I may complete My grace upon you, and that ye may be guided.    S: And from whatsoever place you come forth, turn your face towards the  Sacred Mosque; and wherever you are turn your faces towards it, so that  people shall have no accusation against you, except such of them as are  unjust; so do not fear them, and fear Me, that I may complete My favor  on you and that you may walk on the right course.    002.151  Y: A similar (favour have ye already received) in that We have sent  among you a Messenger of your own, rehearsing to you Our Signs, and  sanctifying you, and instructing you in Scripture and Wisdom, and in  new knowledge.    P: Even as We have sent unto you a messenger from among you, who  reciteth unto you Our revelations and causeth you to grow, and teacheth  you the Scripture and wisdom, and teacheth you that which ye knew not.    S: Even as We have sent among you a Messenger from among you who recites  to you Our communications and purifies you and teaches you the Book and  the wisdom and teaches you that which you did not know.    002.152  Y: Then do ye remember Me; I will remember you. Be grateful to Me, and  reject not Faith.    P: Therefore remember Me, I will remember you. Give thanks to Me, and  reject not Me.    S: Therefore remember Me, I will remember you, and be thankful to Me,  and do not be ungrateful to Me.    002.153  Y: O ye who believe! seek help with patient perseverance and prayer; for  Allah is with those who patiently persevere.    P: O ye who believe! Seek help in steadfastness and prayer. Lo! Allah is  with the steadfast.    S: O you who believe! seek assistance through patience and prayer;  surely Allah is with the patient.    002.154  Y: And say not of those who are slain in the way of Allah: \"They are  dead.\" Nay, they are living, though ye perceive (it) not.    P: And call not those who are slain in the way of Allah \"dead.\" Nay,  they are living, only ye perceive not.    S: And do not speak of those who are slain in Allah's way as dead; nay,  (they are) alive, but you do not perceive.    002.155  Y: Be sure we shall test you with something of fear and hunger, some  loss in goods or lives or the fruits (of your toil), but give glad  tidings to those who patiently persevere,    P: And surely We shall try you with something of fear and hunger, and  loss of wealth and lives and crops; but give glad tidings to the  steadfast,    S: And We will most certainly try you with somewhat of fear and hunger  and loss of property and lives and fruits; and give good news to the  patient,    002.156  Y: Who say, when afflicted with calamity: \"To Allah We belong, and to  Him is our return\":-    P: Who say, when a misfortune striketh them: Lo! we are Allah's and lo!  unto Him we are returning.    S: Who, when a misfortune befalls them, say: Surely we are Allah's and  to Him we shall surely return.    002.157  Y: They are those on whom (Descend) blessings from Allah, and Mercy, and  they are the ones that receive guidance.    P: Such are they on whom are blessings from their Lord, and mercy. Such  are the rightly guided.    S: Those are they on whom are blessings and mercy from their Lord, and  those are the followers of the right course.    002.158  Y: Behold! Safa and Marwa are among the Symbols of Allah. So if those  who visit the House in the Season or at other times, should compass  them round, it is no sin in them. And if any one obeyeth his own  impulse to good,- be sure that Allah is He Who recogniseth and knoweth.    P: Lo! (the mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwah are among the indications  of Allah. It is therefore no sin for him who is on pilgrimage to the  House (of Allah) or visiteth it, to go around them (as the pagan custom  is). And he who doeth good of his own accord, (for him) lo! Allah is  Responsive, Aware.    S: Surely the Safa and the Marwa are among the signs appointed by Allah;  so whoever makes a pilgrimage to the House or pays a visit (to it),  there is no blame on him if he goes round them both; and whoever does  good spontaneously, then surely Allah is Grateful, Knowing.    002.159  Y: Those who conceal the clear (Signs) We have sent down, and the  Guidance, after We have made it clear for the people in the Book,-on  them shall be Allah's curse, and the curse of those entitled to curse,-    P: Lo! Those who hide the proofs and the guidance which We revealed,  after We had made it clear to mankind in the Scripture: such are  accursed of Allah and accursed of those who have the power to curse.    S: Surely those who conceal the clear proofs and the guidance that We  revealed after We made it clear in the Book for men, these it is whom  Allah shall curse, and those who curse shall curse them (too).    002.160  Y: Except those who repent and make amends and openly declare (the  Truth): To them I turn; for I am Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.    P: Except those who repent and amend and make manifest (the truth).  These it is toward whom I relent. I am the Relenting, the Merciful.    S: Except those who repent and amend and make manifest (the truth),  these it is to whom I turn (mercifully); and I am the Oft-returning (to  mercy), the Merciful.    002.161  Y: Those who reject Faith, and die rejecting,- on them is Allah's curse,  and the curse of angels, and of all mankind;    P: Lo! Those who disbelieve, and die while they are disbelievers; on  them is the curse of Allah and of angels and of men combined.    S: Surely those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers,  these it is on whom is the curse of Allah and the angels and men all;    002.162  Y: They will abide therein: Their penalty will not be lightened, nor  will respite be their (lot).    P: They ever dwell therein. The doom will not be lightened for them,  neither will they be reprieved.    S: Abiding in it; their chastisement shall not be lightened nor shall  they be given respite.    002.163  Y:"]]]
