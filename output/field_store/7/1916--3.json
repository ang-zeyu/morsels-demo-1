In addition to the numbers given thirteen reported a slight slope, one a  slight slope to a medium slope, two a slight to a steep slope, sixteen a  medium slope, one a medium to a steep slope, and five a steep slope--the  emphasis being laid on the moderate rising ground. No grower reported an  orchard location entirely at the base of a slope, but six reported  orchards extending from the base to the top of the slope, two from the  base to midway of the slope, twenty-five at midway of the slope, seven  from midway to the top and twenty-two at the top of a slope--the high  ground evidently being preferred for orchard sites. As a general rule,  as would naturally be expected, those who reported their orchards on the  top of the slope usually reported their ground as either high or medium.  Of ninety-six reports on the elevation of the orchards only four  reported low land, and two of these were on top of a slope, two low and  medium, one low and high, forty-six medium, fourteen medium and high,  and twenty-seven high--the medium taking the lead. These figures have  been given of the state as a whole, but when the sections are considered  the southeastern and the west central take the lead in the highest  percentage of high ground in comparison with the lower ground; the  southeastern and east central, for the greatest amount of rolling land;  and the southwestern, for the most level or nearly level land.    [Illustration: Down the long row. View in well cared for orchard of J. M.  Barclay, Madison Lake.]    As for the effect of direction of slope on hardiness, there were many  varied opinions. Thirty stated without question that the direction had  an effect, thirty-one stated that it had no effect, and seventy-two  admitted that they did not know. Of those answering in the affirmative  only seven had two or more distinctly different slopes, while fifteen of  the negatives had two or more slopes for comparison. Nine of those who  stated they didn't know had two or more slopes upon which to base their  judgment. In summing up the direction of sites preferred, seventy-seven  recommended a northerly slope, nine had no preference, one preferred  southeast, one west, one west and east, two east, one north and east,  one northeast or east, and sixty-four expressed no opinion. Two growers  stated that the north slope prevented early bloom and thereby lessened  liability to injury from late frosts, two growers stated that northern  slopes decreased the loss of moisture, and one stated that the northeast  slope gives the largest fruit and the west the best colored.    As a brief summary of the reports on orchard sites, it may be stated  that high ground, rolling or sloping to the north, is preferred by the  majority of growers who filled out these orchard survey blanks.    _Protective Agencies._ Under this heading comes windbreaks of all kinds,  whether hills, natural timber or planted trees, and bodies of water  which ameliorate the climate. Out of fifty-four replies from the central  east section, sixteen reported that their orchards were favorably  affected by lakes, the benefit coming in most cases from the prevention  of early and late frosts. One grower attributed the cooling of the air  during the summer as a benefit and two stated that the bodies of water  furnished moisture. Two growers in the southeast section received  favorable influences from the Mississippi River, and one in the  southwestern and two in the west central sections thought they received  beneficial effects from lakes. According to this data, orchards in the  east central section, owing largely to the influence of Lake Minnetonka,  are greatly benefited by the presence of water.    Windbreaks are a very important factor in successful orcharding in  Minnesota, even though one party in the southeast section and three  parties in the central east noted no beneficial effects. According to  reports from the central west and southwest sections they are of great  benefit and in some cases indispensable to apple growing. As would be  expected by any one who is acquainted with Minnesota, the planted  windbreaks are a more important factor in the prairie country than in  the natural wooded and hilly regions. In the southeast section, five  orchards were reported as protected by bluffs and hills, three by both  hills and natural woods, two by natural woods, two by both natural and  planted woods, and twenty-one by planted woods; in the central east  section, one by a hill and a planted windbreak, one by a town, fifteen  by natural timber, two by natural and planted timber, and nineteen by  planted windbreaks; in the northeast section, two by natural and four by  planted windbreaks; in the northwest section, three by natural and two  by planted windbreaks; in the west central section, one by a hill and  natural timber, five by natural timber, two by natural timber and  planted windbreaks, and eighteen by planted windbreaks; and in the  southwest section, one by a hill and natural woods, one by a hill and  planted windbreak, two by natural timber, and fifteen by planted  windbreaks. If Meeker County, which has natural timber, was not included  in the central west--and perhaps it should have been included in central  east--this section would have only one orchard protected alone by  natural timber; and if Blue Earth County was eliminated from the  southwest, this section would have no orchard protected alone by natural  timber.    The beneficial effects from windbreaks may be summed up as follows:  Twenty-five reported that they prevented fruit from being blown off  trees, nine that they prevented trees and limbs being broken by winds  and storms, ten that they protected trees from injury by winds without  specifying the kind of injury, four that they reduced injury from  frosts, ten that they either prevented or reduced winter injury, four  that they helped to retain moisture, five that they helped to hold snow,  eight that they prevented snow drifting, five that they protected  orchards from hot and dry winds, three that they permitted the growing  of apples, and one that they supplied all advantages.    The kinds of trees recommended for windbreaks and the methods of  planting are numerous and variable and to discuss them at length would  take too much time. However, the principal facts may be briefly  enumerated.    In eighty-five reports that listed set out windbreaks, it was found that  fifty-seven growers had used evergreens, thirty-seven willows,  twenty-nine box elders, twenty-five maples, seventeen cottonwoods,  thirteen ashes, eleven elms, eight poplars, four oaks, four plums, three  nuts and one apple. The evergreens consisted of thirteen Scotch pine,  eleven evergreens (not named), eight Norway spruce, five spruce (not  named), three balsam, three Austrian pine, two white pine, one yellow  pine, two cedar, two white spruce, two pine (variety not named), two  fir, two jack pine, one Black Hills spruce, and one tamarack. In the  willows were given twenty willows (variety not named), two  laurel-leaved, seven white and eight golden; in the maples, sixteen soft  maples, two hard maples, one silver-maple and six maples (kind not  named); in the poplars, five Norway, one Carolina, two poplar (kind not  named); and in the nuts, one black walnut, one butternut and one walnut.  The major part of the box elders, cottonwoods, willows and ashes were  noted in the central west and southwest sections. Thirty-seven  experienced growers of windbreaks, the most of them living in the  southwest, west central and southeast sections, recommended the  following trees for windbreaks in the given proportions, twenty-four  evergreens, fifteen willows, seven maples, six poplars, five elms, five  box elders, three elms, two plum, two cottonwood, three hedges, one oak,  one hackberry and one black walnut. The evergreens are decidedly the  most popular, and among the varieties mentioned Norway spruce takes the  lead for those recommended, and the Scotch pine for those planted.    There are about as many different systems of planting used as growers.  The main point in all cases was to have a planting that would stop the  wind and storms. A few growers advocated the use of a hedge or plum  trees to fill in under the windbreak, while one grower desires a  circulation of air under the branches of his trees. Cultivation and  intercropping of windbreaks are also recommended in a few cases. The  distance of planting varies, of course, with the trees or shrubs used.  For example: one grower recommends 8 ft. x 8 ft. for large deciduous  trees, and another grower, 6 ft. x 12 ft. apart in rows and two rows, 12  ft. apart. For Scotch pine one grower advocates eight feet. In some  cases a mixture of many kinds of trees is recommended, and then again  only one kind. One very solid windbreak is made up of a lilac hedge,  four rows of jack pine, four rows of Norway poplar and one row of  willow. Another is one row willow, one of evergreen, one of willow and  one of evergreen.    Various distances between windbreak and orchard were used and  recommended. A large number of orchards were started at about twenty  feet from the windbreak and a few as close as one rod, but these  distances proved to be too close. One grower, however, recommended close  planting and later the removal of a row of trees in the windbreak when  more space was needed. The recommended distances for planting varied  from thirty to 500 feet, although seventy-five to 100 was satisfactory  in most cases.    More details have been given in regard to orchard sites and windbreaks  than many of you are probably interested in, but for one who is planning  to set out an orchard they should prove of value and profit, as they are  based upon the experiences of many of Minnesota's best orchardists.

THE \"ALLIGATOR\" MOUND.    Although of much less importance than the mastodon, a word may be added  as to the so-called alligator mound, more especially because the  alligator, owing to its southern habitat, is not likely to have been  known to the Mound-Builders of Ohio. That it may have been known to them  either through travel or hearsay is of course possible. A copy of the  mound from the \"Ancient Monuments\" is subjoined.    The alligator mound was described under this name for no other reason  than because it was known in the vicinity as such, this designation  having been adopted by Squier and Davis, as they frankly say, \"for want  of a better,\" adding \"although the figure bears as close a resemblance  to the lizard as any other reptile.\" (Ancient Monuments, p. 99.)    In truth it bears a superficial likeness to almost any long-tailed  animal which has the power of curling its tail--which, the alligator has  not--as, for instance, the opossum. It is, however, the merest  guess-work to attempt to confine its resemblances to any particular  animal. Nevertheless recent writers have described this as the  \"alligator mound\" without suggesting a word of doubt as to its want of  positive resemblance to that saurian.    [Illustration: Fig. 30.--\"Alligator\" Mound.]          HUMAN SCULPTURES.      The conclusion reached in the foregoing pages that the animal sculptures  are not \"exact and faithful copies from nature,\" but are imitations of a  general rather than of a special character, such as comport better with  the state of art as developed among certain of the Indian tribes than  among a people that has achieved any notable advance in culture is  important not only in its bearing on the questions previously noticed in  this paper, but in its relation to another and highly interesting class  of sculptures.    If a large proportion of the animal carvings are so lacking in artistic  accuracy as to make it possible to identify positively only the few  possessing the most strongly marked characters, how much faith is to be  placed in the ability of the Mound sculptor to fix in stone the features  and expressions of the human countenance, infinitely more difficult  subject for portrayal as this confessedly is?    That Wilson regards the human sculptures as affording a basis for sound  ethnological deductions is evident from the following paragraph, taken  from Prehistoric Man, vol. 1, p. 461:         Alike from the minute accuracy of many of the sculptures of       animals, hereafter referred to, and from the correspondence to well       known features of the modern Red Indian suggested by some of the       human heads, these miniature portraits may be assumed, with every       probability, to include faithful representations of the predominant       physical features of the ancient people by whom they were executed.    Short, too, accepting the popular idea that they are faithful and  recognizable copies from nature, remarks in the North Americans of  Antiquity, p. 98, _ibid._, p. 187:         There is no reason for believing that the people who wrought stone       and clay into perfect effigies of animals have not left us       sculptures of their own faces in the images exhumed from the       mounds;\" and again, \"The perfection of the animal representations       furnish us the assurance that their sculptures of the human face       were equally true to nature.    Squier and Davis also appear to have had no doubt whatever of the  capabilities of the Mound-Builders in the direction of human  portraiture. They are not only able to discern in the sculptured heads  niceties of expression sufficient for the discrimination of the sexes,  but, as well, to enable them to point out such as are undoubtedly  ancient and the work of the Mound-Builders, and those of a more recent  origin, the product of the present Indians. Their main criterion of  origin is, apparently, that all of fine execution and finish were the  work of the Mound sculptors, and those roughly done and \"immeasurably  inferior to the relics of the mounds,\" to use their own words, were the  handicraft of the tribes found in the country by the whites. Conclusions  so derived, it may strike some, are open to criticism, however well  suited they may be to meet the necessities of preconceived theories.    After discussing in detail the methods of arranging the hair, the paint  lines, and tattooing, the features of the human carvings, Squier and  Davis arrive at the conclusion that the \"physiological characteristics  of these heads do not differ essentially from those of the great  American family.\"    Of later writers some agree with Squier and Davis in believing the type  illustrated by these heads to be Indian; others agree rather with  Wilson, who dissents from the view expressed by Squier and Davis, and,  in conformity with the predilections visible throughout his work, is of  the opinion that the Mound-Builders were of a distinct type from the  North American Indian, and that \"the majority of sculptured human heads  hitherto recovered from their ancient depositories do not reproduce the  Indian features.\" (Wilson's Prehistoric Man, vol. 1, p. 469.) Again,  Wilson says that the diversity of type found among the human sculptures  \"proves that the Mound-Builders were familiar with the American Indian  type, but nothing more.\"--_Ibid._, p. 469.    The varying type of physiognomy represented by these heads would better  indicate that their resemblances are the result of accident rather than  of intention. For the same reason that the sculptured animals of the  same species display great differences of form and expression, according  to the varying skill of the sculptors or the unexacting demands made by  a rude condition of art, so the diversified character of the human faces  is to be ascribed, not to the successful perpetuation in stone by a  master hand of individual features, but simply to a want of skill on the  part of the sculptor. The evidence afforded by the animal sculptures all  tends to the conclusion that exact individual portraiture would have  been impossible to the mound sculptor had the state of culture he lived  in demanded it; the latter is altogether improbable. A glance at the  above quotations will show that it is the assumed fidelity to nature of  the animal carvings and their fine execution which has been relied upon  in support of a similar claim for the human sculptures. As this claim is  seen to have but slight basis in fact the main argument for asserting  the human sculptures to be faithful representations of physical  features, and to embody exact racial characters falls to the ground, and  it must be admitted as in the last degree improbable that the art of the  mound sculptor was adequate for the task of accurate human portraiture.  To base important ethnologic deductions upon the evidence afforded by  the human sculptures in the present state of our knowledge concerning  them would seem to be utterly unscientific and misleading.    Copies of several of the heads as they appear in \"Ancient Monuments\"  (pp. 244-247) are here subjoined to show the various types of  physiognomy illustrated by them:    [Illustration: Fig. 31. Fig. 32. Fig. 33. Human Carvings from the  Mounds.]    [Illustration: Fig. 34. Fig. 35. Human Carvings from the Mounds.]    Could the many other stone and terra-cotta sculptures of the human face  which have been ascribed to the Mound-Builders be reproduced here it  would be seen that the specimens illustrated above are among the very  best. In not a few, traces of the grotesque are distinctly visible, and  there is little in their appearance to suggest that they had a different  origin or contain a deeper meaning than similar productions found among  present Indians. As each of the many carvings differ more or less from  every other, it will at once be perceived that the advocates of  different theories can readily find in the series abundant testimony in  support of any and all assumptions they may choose to advance.          INDIAN AND MOUND-BUILDERS' ART COMPARED.      Turning from special illustrations of the artistic skill of the  Mound-Builders, brief attention may be paid to their art in its more  general features, and as compared with art as found among our Indian  tribes.    Among some of the latter the artistic instinct, while deriving its  characteristic features, as among the Mound-Builders, from animated  nature, exhibits a decided tendency towards the production of  conventional forms, and often finds expression in creations of the most  grotesque and imaginative character.    While this is true of some tribes it is by no means true of all, nor is  it true of all the art products of even those tribes most given to  conventional art. But even were it true in its broadest terms, it is  more than doubtful if the significance of the fact has not been greatly  overestimated. Some authors indeed seem to discern in the introduction  of the grotesque element and the substitution of conventional designs of  animals for a more natural portrayal, a difference sufficient to mark,  not distinct eras of art culture merely, but different races with very  different modes of art expression.    To trace the origin of art among primitive peoples, and to note the  successive steps by which decorative art grew from its probable origin  in the readily recognized adornments of nature and in the mere  \"accidents of manufacture,\" as they have been termed, would be not only  interesting, but highly instructive. Such a study should afford us a  clew to the origin and significance of conventional as contrasted with  imitative art.    The natural process of the evolution of art would seem to be from the  purely imitative to the conventional, the tendency being for artistic  expression of a "]]]
