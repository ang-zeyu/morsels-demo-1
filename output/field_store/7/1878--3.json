[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17310"],[0,"Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas (#10)"],[1,"adopt that which the faithful Counsellor biddeth you.  Deprive not yourselves of the bounties which have been created for your  sake.    Charity is pleasing and praiseworthy in the sight of God and is regarded  as a prince among goodly deeds. Consider ye and call to mind that which  the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur'an: 'They prefer them before  themselves, though poverty be their own lot. And with such as are  preserved from their own covetousness shall it be well.'(17) Viewed in  this light, the blessed utterance above is, in truth, the day-star of  utterances. Blessed is he who preferreth his brother before himself.  Verily, such a man is reckoned, by virtue of the Will of God, the  All-Knowing, the All-Wise, with the people of Baha who dwell in the  Crimson Ark.    The word of God which the Supreme Pen hath recorded on the                                 _eleventh leaf_    of the Most Exalted Paradise is this: We enjoin upon them that are the  emblems of His names and attributes to firmly adhere henceforth unto that  which hath been set forth in this Most Great Revelation, not to allow  themselves to become the cause of strife, and, until the end that knoweth  no end, to keep their eyes directed towards the dayspring of these  resplendent words which have been recorded in this Tablet. Strife leads to  bloodshed and provokes commotion amongst people. Hearken ye unto the Voice  of this Wronged One and deviate not therefrom.    Were anyone to ponder in his heart that which hath, in this Revelation,  streamed forth from the Pen of Glory, he would be assured that whatever  this Wronged One hath affirmed He hath had no intention of establishing  any position or distinction for Himself. The purpose hath rather been to  attract the souls, through the sublimity of His words, unto the summit of  transcendent glory and to endow them with the capacity of perceiving that  which will purge and purify the peoples of the world from the strife and  dissension which religious differences provoke. Unto this bear witness My  heart, My Pen, My inner and My outer Being. God grant that all men may  turn unto the treasuries latent within their own beings.    O people of Baha! The source of crafts, sciences and arts is the power of  reflection. Make ye every effort that out of this ideal mine there may  gleam forth such pearls of wisdom and utterance as will promote the  well-being and harmony of all the kindreds of the earth.    Under all conditions, whether in adversity or at ease, whether honoured or  afflicted, this Wronged One hath directed all men to show forth love,  affection, compassion and harmony. And yet whenever there was any slight  evidence of progress and advancement, those concealed behind the veils  would sally forth and utter calumnies more wounding than the sword. They  cling unto misleading and reprehensible words and suffer themselves to be  deprived of the ocean of verses revealed by God.    If these obstructing veils had not intervened Persia would, in some two  years, have been subdued through the power of utterance, the position of  both the government and the people would have been raised and the Supreme  Goal, unveiled and unconcealed, would have appeared in the plenitude of  glory. In short, sometimes in explicit language, at other times by  allusion, We said whatever had to be said. Thus, once Persia had been  rehabilitated, the sweet savours of the Word of God would have wafted over  all countries, inasmuch as that which hath streamed forth from the Most  Exalted Pen is conducive to the glory, the advancement and education of  all the peoples and kindreds of the earth. Indeed it is the sovereign  remedy for every disease, could they but comprehend and perceive it.    Recently the Afnans and Amin--upon them be My glory and  loving-kindness--attained Our presence and beheld Our countenance; likewise  Nabil, the son of Nabil and the son of Samandar--upon them rest the glory  of God and His loving-kindness--are present and have drunk the cup of  reunion. We entreat God that He may graciously ordain for them the good of  this world and of the next and that the outpouring of His blessings and  grace may descend upon them from the heaven of His generosity and the  clouds of His tender compassion. Verily of those who show mercy He is the  Most Merciful, and He is the Gracious, the Beneficent.    O Haydar-'Ali! Thine other letter which thou hadst forwarded through him  who beareth the title of Jud(18) (Bounty) hath reached Our holy court.  Praised be God! It was adorned with the light of divine unity and of  detachment and was ablaze with the fire of love and affection. Pray thou  unto God that He may grant keenness to the eyes and illumine them with a  new light, perchance they may perceive that which hath no parallel nor  peer.    In this day the verses of the Mother Book are resplendent and unmistakable  even as the sun. They can in no wise be mistaken for any of the past or  more recent utterances. Truly this Wronged One desireth not to demonstrate  His Own Cause with proofs produced by others. He is the One Who embraceth  all things, while all else besides Him is circumscribed. Say, O people,  peruse that which is current amongst you and We will peruse what  pertaineth unto Us. I swear by God! Neither the praise of the peoples of  the world, nor the things that the kindreds of the earth possess are  worthy of mention before the remembrance of His Name. Unto this beareth  witness He Who under all conditions proclaimeth, 'Verily He is God, the  sovereign Ruler of the Day of Reckoning and the Lord of the mighty  Throne.'    Glorified be God! One wondereth by what proof or reason the disbelievers  among the people of the Bayan have turned away from the Lord of being. In  truth the station of this Revelation transcendeth the station of whatever  hath been manifested in the past or will be made manifest in the future.    Were the Point of the Bayan present in this day and should He, God forbid,  hesitate to acknowledge this Cause, then the very blessed words which have  streamed forth from the wellspring of His Own Bayan would apply to Him. He  saith, and His word is the truth, 'Lawful is it for Him Whom God will make  manifest to reject him who is the greatest on earth.' Say, O ye that are  bereft of understanding! Today that Most Exalted Being is proclaiming:  'Verily, verily, I am the first to adore Him.' How shallow is the fund of  men's knowledge and how feeble their power of perception. Our Pen of Glory  beareth witness to their abject poverty and to the wealth of God, the Lord  of all worlds.    Lauded and glorified is He Who hath called the creation into being. He is  the sovereign Truth, the Knower of things unseen. The Mother Book is  revealed and the Lord of Bounty is established upon the most blessed seat  of glory. The Dawn hath broken, yet the people understand not. The signs  have been ushered in, while He Who hath revealed them is overwhelmed with  manifest sorrow. Indeed I have endured that which hath caused the world of  existence to lament.    Say: O Yahya (Azal), produce a single verse, if thou dost possess  divinely-inspired knowledge. These words were formerly spoken by My Herald  Who at this hour proclaimeth: 'Verily, verily, I am the first to adore  Him.' Be fair, O My brother. Art thou able to express thyself when brought  face to face with the billowing ocean of Mine utterance? Canst thou  unloose thy tongue when confronted with the shrill voice of My Pen? Hast  thou any power before the revelations of Mine omnipotence? Judge thou  fairly, I adjure thee by God, and call to mind when thou didst stand in  the presence of this Wronged One and We dictated to thee the verses of  God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Beware lest the source of  falsehood withhold thee from the manifest Truth.    O thou who hast fixed thy gaze upon My countenance! Say: O ye heedless  ones! By reason of a droplet ye have deprived yourselves of the ocean of  heavenly verses and for the sake of an insignificant atom ye have shut  yourselves out from the splendours of the Day-Star of Truth. Who else but  Baha hath the power to speak forth before the face of mankind? Judge ye  fairly and be not of the unjust. Through Him the oceans have surged, the  mysteries have been divulged and the trees have lifted up their voices  exclaiming: The kingdoms of earth and heaven are God's, the Revealer of  signs, the Fountainhead of clear tokens. Peruse ye the Persian Bayan  revealed by Him Who heralded this Revelation and look at it with the eye  of fairness. Verily He will guide you aright to His Path. At this moment  He proclaimeth that which His tongue had formerly uttered when He was  seated upon the throne of His most exalted Name.    Thou hast made mention of the loved ones in those regions. Praised be God,  each one of them attained the honour of being remembered by the True  One--exalted is His glory--and the names of them, one and all, flowed from  the Tongue of Grandeur in the kingdom of utterance. Great indeed is their  blessedness and happiness, inasmuch as they have drunk the choice wine of  revelation and inspiration from the hand of their Lord, the Compassionate,  the Merciful. We beseech God to strengthen them to manifest inflexible  constancy and to summon to their aid the hosts of wisdom and utterance. He  is in truth the Mighty, the Omnipotent. Convey my greetings to them and  give them the joyful tidings that the Day-Star of remembrance hath dawned  and shed its radiance from above the horizon of the bountiful favours of  their Lord, the Ever-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.    Thou hast mentioned Husayn. We have attired his temple with the robe of  forgiveness and adorned his head with the crown of pardon. It beseemeth  him to pride himself among all men upon this resplendent, this radiant and  manifest bounty. Say: Be not despondent.

Do you think its mother would mind?\"    \"She'd mind very much indeed,\" said Anthea shortly.    \"Oh, but I should bring it up in luxury, you know. I am Lady Chittenden.  You must have seen my photograph in the illustrated papers. They call me  a Beauty, you know, but of course that's all nonsense. Anyway\"--    She opened the carriage door and jumped out. She had the wonderfullest  red high-heeled shoes with silver buckles. \"Let me hold him a minute,\"  she said. And she took the Lamb and held him very awkwardly, as if she  was not used to babies.    Then suddenly she jumped into the carriage with the Lamb in her arms and  slammed the door, and said, \"Drive on!\"    The Lamb roared, the little white dog barked, and the coachman  hesitated.    \"Drive on, I tell you!\" cried the lady; and the coachman did, for, as he  said afterwards, it was as much as his place was worth not to.    The four children looked at each other, and then with one accord they  rushed after the carriage and held on behind. Down the dusty road went  the smart carriage, and after it, at double-quick time, ran the  twinkling legs of the Lamb's brothers and sisters.    [Illustration: At double-quick time, ran the twinkling legs of the  Lamb's brothers and sisters]    The Lamb howled louder and louder, but presently his howls changed by  slow degrees to hiccupy gurgles, and then all was still, and they knew  he had gone to sleep.    The carriage went on, and the eight feet that twinkled through the  dust were growing quite stiff and tired before the carriage stopped at  the lodge of a grand park. The children crouched down behind the  carriage, and the lady got out. She looked at the Baby as it lay on the  carriage seat, and hesitated.    \"The darling--I won't disturb it,\" she said, and went into the lodge to  talk to the woman there about a setting of eggs that had not turned out  well.    The coachman and footman sprang from the box and bent over the sleeping  Lamb.    \"Fine boy--wish he was mine,\" said the coachman.    \"He wouldn't favour _you_ much,\" said the groom sourly; \"too 'andsome.\"    The coachman pretended not to hear. He said--    \"Wonder at her now--I do really! Hates kids. Got none of her own, and  can't abide other folkses'.\"    The children, crouched in the white dust under the carriage, exchanged  uncomfortable glances.    \"Tell you what,\" the coachman went on firmly, \"blowed if I don't hide  the little nipper in the hedge and tell her his brothers took 'im! Then  I'll come back for him afterwards.\"    \"No, you don't,\" said the footman. \"I've took to that kid so as never  was. If anyone's to have him, it's me--so there!\"    \"Stop your talk!\" the coachman rejoined. \"You don't want no kids, and,  if you did, one kid's the same as another to you. But I'm a married man  and a judge of breed. I knows a firstrate yearling when I sees him. I'm  a-goin' to 'ave him, an' least said soonest mended.\"    \"I should 'a' thought,\" said the footman sneeringly, \"you'd a'most  enough. What with Alfred, an' Albert, an' Louise, an' Victor Stanley,  and Helena Beatrice, and another\"--    The coachman hit the footman in the chin--the footman hit the coachman  in the waist-coat--the next minute the two were fighting here and there,  in and out, up and down, and all over everywhere, and the little dog  jumped on the box of the carriage and began barking like mad.    [Illustration: The next minute the two were fighting]    Cyril, still crouching in the dust, waddled on bent legs to the side of  the carriage farthest from the battlefield. He unfastened the door of  the carriage--the two men were far too much occupied with their quarrel  to notice anything--took the Lamb in his arms, and, still stooping,  carried the sleeping baby a dozen yards along the road to where a stile  led into a wood. The others followed, and there among the hazels and  young oaks and sweet chestnuts, covered by high strong-scented  brake-fern, they all lay hidden till the angry voices of the men were  hushed at the angry voice of the red-and-white lady, and, after a long  and anxious search, the carriage at last drove away.    \"My only hat!\" said Cyril, drawing a deep breath as the sound of wheels  at last died away. \"Everyone _does_ want him now--and no mistake! That  Sammyadd has done us again! Tricky brute! For any sake, let's get the  kid safe home.\"    So they peeped out, and finding on the right hand only lonely white  road, and nothing but lonely white road on the left, they took courage,  and the road, Anthea carrying the sleeping Lamb.    Adventures dogged their footsteps. A boy with a bundle of faggots on his  back dropped his bundle by the roadside and asked to look at the Baby,  and then offered to carry him; but Anthea was not to be caught that way  twice. They all walked on, but the boy followed, and Cyril and Robert  couldn't make him go away till they had more than once invited him to  smell their fists. Afterwards a little girl in a blue-and-white checked  pinafore actually followed them for a quarter of a mile crying for \"the  precious Baby,\" and then she was only got rid of by threats of tying her  to a tree in the wood with all their pocket handkerchiefs. \"So that  bears can come and eat you as soon as it gets dark,\" said Cyril  severely. Then she went off crying. It presently seemed wise, to the  brothers and sisters of the Baby who was wanted by everyone, to hide in  the hedge whenever they saw anyone coming, and thus they managed to  prevent the Lamb from arousing the inconvenient affection of a milkman,  a stone-breaker, and a man who drove a cart with a paraffin barrel at  the back of it. They were nearly home when the worst thing of all  happened. Turning a corner suddenly they came upon two vans, a tent, and  a company of gipsies encamped by the side of the road. The vans were  hung all round with wicker chairs and cradles, and flower-stands and  feather brushes. A lot of ragged children were industriously making  dust-pies in the road, two men lay on the grass smoking, and three women  were doing the family washing in an old red watering-can with the top  broken off.    In a moment every gipsy, men, women, and children, surrounded Anthea and  the Baby.    \"Let me hold him, little lady,\" said one of the gipsy women, who had a  mahogany-coloured face and dust-coloured hair; \"I won't hurt a hair of  his head, the little picture!\"    \"I'd rather not,\" said Anthea.    \"Let _me_ have him,\" said the other woman, whose face was also of the  hue of mahogany, and her hair jet-black, in greasy curls. \"I've nineteen  of my own, so I have\"--    \"No,\" said Anthea bravely, but her heart beat so that it nearly choked  her.    Then one of the men pushed forward.    \"Swelp me if it ain't!\" he cried, \"my own long-lost cheild! Have he a  strawberry mark on his left ear? No? Then he's my own babby, stolen from  me in hinnocent hinfancy. 'And 'im over--and we'll not 'ave the law on  yer this time.\"    He snatched the Baby from Anthea, who turned scarlet and burst into  tears of pure rage.    [Illustration: He snatched the baby from Anthea]    The others were standing quite still; this was much the most terrible  thing that had ever happened to them. Even being taken up by the police  in Rochester was nothing to this. Cyril was quite white, and his hands  trembled a little, but he made a sign to the others to shut up. He was  silent a minute, thinking hard. Then he said--    \"We don't want to keep him if he's yours. But you see he's used to us.  You shall have him if you want him\"--    \"No, no!\" cried Anthea,--and Cyril glared at her.    \"Of course we want him,\" said the women, trying to get the Baby out of  the man's arms. The Lamb howled loudly.    \"Oh, he's hurt!\" shrieked Anthea; and Cyril, in a savage undertone, bade  her \"stop it!\"    \"You trust to me,\" he whispered. \"Look here,\" he went on, \"he's awfully  tiresome with people he doesn't know very well. Suppose we stay here a  bit till he gets used to you, and then when it's bedtime I give you my  word of honour we'll go away and let you keep him if you want to. And  then when we're gone you can decide which of you is to have him, as you  all want him so much.\"    \"That's fair enough,\" said the man who was holding the Baby, trying to  loosen the red neckerchief which the Lamb had caught hold of and drawn  round his mahogany throat so tight that he could hardly breathe. The  gipsies whispered together, and Cyril took the chance to whisper too. He  said, \"Sunset! we'll get away then.\"    And then his brothers and sisters were filled with wonder and admiration  at his having been so clever as to remember this.    \"Oh, do let him come to us!\" said Jane. \"See, we'll sit down here and  take care of him for you till he gets used to you.\"    \"What about dinner?\" said Robert suddenly. The others looked at him with  scorn. \"Fancy bothering about your beastly dinner when your br--I mean  when the Baby\"--Jane whispered hotly. Robert carefully winked at her and  went on--    \"You won't mind my just running home to get our dinner?\" he said to the  gipsy; \"I can bring it out here in a basket.\"    His brothers and sisters felt themselves very noble and despised him.  They did not know his thoughtful secret intention. But the gipsies did  in a minute.    \"Oh yes!\" they said; \"and then fetch the police with a pack of lies  about it being your baby instead of ours! D'jever catch a weasel  asleep?\" they asked.    \"If you're hungry you can pick a bit along of us,\" said the light-haired  gipsy-woman, not unkindly. \"Here Levi, that blessed kid'll howl all his  buttons off. Give him to the little lady, and let's see if they can't  get him used to us a bit.\"    So the Lamb was handed back; but the gipsies crowded so closely that he  could not possibly stop howling. Then the man with the red handkerchief  said--    \"Here, Pharaoh, make up the fire; and you girls see to the pot. Give the  kid a chanst.\" So the gipsies, very much against"]]]
