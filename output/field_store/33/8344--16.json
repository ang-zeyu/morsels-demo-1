I let our unhappy prisoner grow calm before I again spoke to him.    \"You asked me,\" I said, \"how I know your name, and who I am.\"  And I  then went over many of the incidents of his early life, when he was a  happy, pleasant-mannered little boy at home.    He made no reply; but he seemed to guess who I was, and bent down his  head between his hands.  I saw tears dropping from between his fingers.  It was a good sign.  I thought of the parable of the prodigal son.  \"He  has been eating the husks: perhaps he will soon say, `I will arise and  go to my Father.'\"  I prayed that the Holy Spirit would strive mightily  with him, and make him feel not only his sad moral and physical  condition, but his terribly dangerous spiritual state.  Such prayers  are, I believe, never made in vain.    I was eager, I must own, to begin my mornings work, but I did not wish  at that moment to interrupt the man's thoughts.  I waited therefore  patiently till he should speak.  After a time he lifted up his head, and  said, \"Who are you?\"  I told him that I remembered him as a boy--that  his countenance was unchanged--and that his father had been my  benefactor.    \"Thank God for that! if such as I am may utter that name,\" he exclaimed.  \"You'll not have me hung, then; you'll not deliver me up to a shameful  death?\"    \"No indeed, Arthur,\" I answered; \"I will rather do my best to protect  you.  I do not know what crimes you have committed, and I do not wish to  know; but I hope to see you restored to tranquillity of mind, and that  you may find joy and peace in believing on that one only Saviour,  through whom you can obtain pardon for your transgressions and  reconciliation with God.\"    I then and there unfolded to him God's merciful plan of salvation.  I  was sure that then was the time.  His heart was softened; he was ready  to receive the truths of the gospel.  It was a happy thing for me that I  knew the plan of salvation before I left England.  I was thus enabled to  impart it to this poor man and to others.  His idea was that if he could  but be very sorry for all his misdeeds, and commit no more, and work  away hard to please God in some sort of fashion, he might have a chance  of going to heaven at last.  He would scarcely believe me when I told  him that I found nothing of that sort throughout the Gospels and  Epistles; that Christ, the anointed One, had done all that was required  for us sinners; that all we have to do is to accept His glorious offer,  by faith in the perfect efficacy of His atoning blood, shed for all  mankind on Calvary.  These truths and many more I tried to explain to  Arthur, and it was satisfactory to mark the readiness with which he  accepted them.    He was for some time utterly prostrated and scarcely able to stand up,  much less to work.  We, of course, were all very busy from sunrise to  sunset, and I could pay very little attention to him during the day.  I  gave him, however, the few books we had brought with us; but I was glad  to see that the Book of books, long unread, was his chief delight.  He  would sit with it in his hand all day, and at night would draw near to  the fire, and pore over its pages as long as the flames burnt with  sufficient brightness.  I felt sure from the first that he was in  earnest, though J--- warned me that he was only shamming, and that as  soon as he could have a chance he would be off with anything he could  lay hands on.  I said that I had no fear about the matter, and should  not keep a watch over him.    We had pretty hard work, you may be sure, and I doubt if any men could  have worked harder; but we kept our health very well--indeed, in spite  of the heat, I never felt stronger.  We had first our own dwelling-house  to get up, and then the huts for the men.  Our own abode was, indeed,  but a hut--larger than the others, with divisions; but there was very  little finish or ornament about it.  To be sure, it was a good deal  larger than the cabin of the _May Flower_, though the girls complained  that it was not half as neat; nor was it, indeed.  Neatness was to come  by and by, we said.  With many settlers, it must be owned, it never  comes at all.  We, however, before long put up a verandah, almost a  necessary appendage to a house in that hot climate.  There was thus  always shade and shelter on one side of the house or the other, and here  my wife and daughters could sit and work, and carry on all sorts of  operations.    Our very first work, I should have said, was to make a pen for the  sheep, where they would be secure from the natives or dingoes at night.  In the daytime, when out feeding, they could be easily kept together,  and they were so tame that they would follow us about like dogs.  Their  offspring learnt the same custom; and so instead of the sheep being  driven, as in England, they throughout the whole of the country follow  the shepherd wherever he leads, and know his voice.  Often have I  thought of the parable of the Good Shepherd when I have heard a  shepherd, in a slightly undulating or hilly country, calling to his  sheep, and seen the flock come trooping over the ridges from afar, and  gradually drawing round him, not one being missing.    As soon as we could, also, we got a garden fenced in and dug up, and a  paddock for wheat.  We had no wish to starve, and at that time  provisions were often very scarce and enormously dear in the colony.  At  one time, indeed, in consequence of the non-arrival of store-ships from  England, the settlers were nearly starved.        CHAPTER FOURTEEN.    A SETTLER'S LIFE.    The number of people who knew anything about farming or gardening was  very small, and continued so long after the colony was settled.  At  first, indeed, there were none, and they actually did not know what to  do with the seeds which had been sent out with them.    At the time of our arrival a change for the better had taken place, and  a large proportion of free settlers were agriculturists, who soon taught  the labourers they employed, and several farms were established.    We little thought at that time of the vast power of production possessed  by Australia.  Day after day we worked on, cutting down trees, splitting  them with wedges, building huts, putting up fences, and digging and  planting.  The latter operations were very important; from the number of  mouths we should soon have to feed, the expense of providing food would  be very great unless we could produce some on the estate.    As soon as Arthur Wells had recovered his strength he willingly set to  work, and no man could have laboured harder than he did.  He knew more  than any of us did about farming, though we had some books to help us.  What was of great consequence, also, he understood the climate; for it  was some time before we could bring ourselves to remember that the  Australian spring is in October; and that Christmas is the hottest time  of the year; and that the periods of seed-time and harvest are the  opposite to those of the old country.    Jacob, besides being a good guide through the country, understood  felling trees, and splitting timber, and putting up huts--very valuable  arts in that country.  He might have been a first-rate watchmaker or  jeweller, have known Hebrew or Greek, or been a good draughtsman, or  kept accounts in excellent style, or dressed to perfection, and been  able to leap with the most perfect grace and nimbleness over counters,  and yet have starved.  Rough backwoodsmen, blacksmiths, carpenters, and  ploughmen have from the first been able to secure good wages in  Australia.  Other men have succeeded by turning their hands to do  whatever might offer; but for such men as I have mentioned, the demand  remains as at first unabated.    Having got through the work requiring immediate attention, I resolved to  return to Sydney to bring up the remainder of our stores, and to procure  a few assigned servants.  Such was the name given to convicts when made  over to the charge of private persons.  The duty of the master was to  find them employment, to feed them according to a certain scale, and  more than that, the original intention of those who formed the plan was  that he should do his best to instruct and improve them.  I am afraid  that not many took much trouble about that; but some few conscientious  masters did all they could, and the consequence was that very many poor  fellows who might have been utterly lost, had they been turned loose at  home, became reformed characters, and respectable members of society.    I took Dick Nailor and Mark with me to look after the dray, thinking  that the assigned men might know very little about the matter.    We had a prosperous journey into Sydney.  The first thing I did was to  sell the horses, for which there was a great demand; and I consequently  got a high price for them, more than double what I gave.  Instead I  bought four working oxen, ten milch cows, and a fine bull.  There would  be time enough to procure horses when they became more plentiful.  Though useful, of course they were not absolute necessaries; and I hoped  from the stock I had now got, to become possessed in a few years of a  fine herd of cattle.  I might have had fifty servants assigned to me,  but I accepted only six; and those I had the opportunity of selecting.  I determined with these and the assistance of our own party to bring  under cultivation as many acres of ground as I could manage.    A settler's life in a new country is not all plain sailing, as we were  to find--though in many instances it may be somewhat monotonous.  We had  some expectation of meeting with an adventure, for we heard that several  bush-rangers were out, who were levying black-mail on all travellers.  We resolved at all events not to be taken unawares.    I felt pretty sure"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2306"],[0,"Uncle Remus, His Songs and His Sayings (#15)"],[1,"Remus's  stories, that the extraordinary statement made no unusual  impression upon him. Therefore the old man began again, and this  time in a louder and more insinuating tone:    \"One time ole man Rabbit, he wuz gwine 'long down de road  shakin' his long, bushy tail, en feelin' mighty biggity.\"    This was effective.    \"Great goodness, Uncle Remus!\" exclaimed the little boy in  open-eyed wonder, \"everybody knows that rabbits haven't got long,  bushy tails.\"    The old man shifted his position in his chair and allowed his  venerable head to drop forward until his whole appearance was  suggestive of the deepest dejection; and this was intensified by  a groan that seemed to be the result of great mental agony.  Finally he spoke, but not as addressing himself to the little  boy.    \"I notices dat dem fokes w'at makes a great 'miration 'bout w'at  dey knows is des de fokes w'ich you can't put no 'pennunce in  w'en de 'cashun come up. Yer one un um now, en he done come en  excuse me er 'lowin dat rabbits is got long, bushy tails,  w'ich  goodness knows ef I'd a dremp' it, I'd a whirl in en on-dremp  it.\"    \"Well, but Uncle Remus, you said rabbits had long, bushy tails,\"  replied the little boy. \"Now you know you did.\"    \"Ef I ain't fergit it off'n my mine, I say dat ole Brer Rabbit  wuz gwine down de big road shakin' his long, bushy tail. Dat w'at  I say, en dat I stan's by.\"    The little boy looked puzzled, but he didn't say anything. After  a while the old man continued:    \"Now, den, ef dat's 'greed ter, I'm gwine on, en ef tain't 'greed  ter, den I'm gwineter pick up my cane en look atter my own  intrust. I got wuk lyin''roun' yer dat's des natchully gittin'  moldy.\"    The little boy still remained quiet, and Uncle Remus proceeded:    \"One day Brer Rabbit wuz gwine down de road shakin' his long,  bushy tail, w'en who should he strike up wid but ole Brer Fox  gwine amblin' long wid a big string er fish! W'en dey pass de  time er day wid wunner nudder, Brer Rabbit, he open up de confab,  he did, en he ax Brer Fox whar he git dat nice string er fish, en  Brer Fox, he up'n 'spon' dat he kotch um, en Brer Rabbit, he say  whar'bouts, en Brer Fox, he say down at de babtizin' creek, en  Brer Rabbit he ax how, kaze in dem days dey wuz monstus fon' er  minners, en Brer Fox, he sot down on a log, he did, en he up'n  tell Brer Rabbit dat all he gotter do fer ter git er big mess er  minners is ter go ter de creek atter sundown, en drap his tail in  de water en set dar twel day-light, en den draw up a whole armful  er fishes, en dem w'at he don't want, he kin fling back.    \"Right dar's whar Brer Rabbit drap his watermillion, kaze he  tuck'n sot out dat night en went a fishin'.

He make a  pull, en he feel like he comin' in two, en he fetch nudder jerk,  en lo en beholes, whar wuz his tail?\"    There was a long pause.    \"Did it come off, Uncle Remus?\" asked the little boy, presently.    \"She did dat!\" replied the old man with unction. \"She did dat,  and dat w'at make all deze yer bob-tail rabbits w'at you see  hoppin' en skaddlin' thoo de woods.\"    \"Are they all that way just because the old Rabbit lost his tail  in the creek?\" asked the little boy.    \"Dat's it, honey,\" replied the old man. \"Dat's w'at dey tells me.  Look like dey er bleedzd ter take atter der pa.\"      XXVI. MR. TERRAPIN SHOWS HIS STRENGTH    \"BRER TARRYPIN wuz de out'nes' man,\" said Uncle Remus, rubbing  his hands together contemplatively, and chuckling to himself in a  very significant manner; \"he wuz de out'nes' man er de whole  gang. He wuz dat.\"    The little boy sat perfectly quiet, betraying no impatience when  Uncle Remus paused to hunt, first in one pocket and then in  another, for enough crumbs of tobacco to replenish his pipe.  Presently the old man proceeded:    \"One night Miss Meadows en de gals dey gun a candy-pullin', en  so many er de nabers come in 'sponse ter de invite dat dey hatter  put de 'lasses in de wash pot en b'il' de fier in de yard. Brer  B'ar, he holp*1 Miss Meadows bring de wood, Brer Fox, he men' de  fier, Brer Wolf, he kep' de dogs off, Brer Rabbit, he grease de  bottom er de plates fer ter keep de candy fum stickin', en Brer  Tarrypin, he klum up in a cheer, en say he'd watch en see dat de  'lasses didn't bile over. Dey wuz all dere, en dey wern't cuttin'  up no didos, nudder, kaze Miss Meadows, she done put her foot  down, she did, en say dat w'en dey come ter her place dey hatter  hang up a flag er truce at de front gate en 'bide by it.    \"Well, den, w'iles dey wuz all a settin' dar en de 'lasses wuz a  bilin' en a blubberin', dey got ter runnin' on talkin' mighty  biggity. Brer Rabbit, he say he de swiffes'; but Brer Tarrypin,  he rock long in de cheer en watch de 'lasses. Brer Fox, he say he  de sharpes', but Brer Tarrypin he rock long. Brer Wolf, he say he  de mos' suvvigus, but Brer Tarrypin, he rock en he rock long.  Brer B'ar, he say he de mos' stronges', but Brer Tarrypin he  rock, en he keep on rockin'. Bimeby he sorter shet one eye, en  say, sezee:    \"'Hit look like 'periently dat de ole hardshell ain't nowhars  'longside er dis crowd, yit yer I is, en I'm de same man w'at  show Brer Rabbit dat he ain't de swiffes'; en I'm de same man  w'at kin show Brer B'ar dat he ain't de stronges',' sezee.    \"Den dey all laff en holler, kaze it look like Brer B'ar mo'  stronger dan a steer. Bimeby, Miss Meadows, she up'n ax, she did,  how he gwine do it.    \"'Gimme a good strong rope,' sez Brer Tarrypin, sezee, 'en lemme  git in er puddle er water, en den let Brer B'ar see ef he kin  pull me out,' sezee.    \"Den dey all laff 'gin, en Brer B'ar, he ups en sez, sezee: 'We  ain't got no rope,' sezee.    \"'No,' sez Brer Tarrypin, sezee, 'en needer is you got de strenk,'  sezee, en den Brer Tarrypin, he rock en rock long, en watch de  'lasses a bilin' en a blubberin'.    \"Atter w'ile Miss Meadows, she up en say, she did, dat she'd  take'n loan de young men her bed-cord, en w'iles de candy wuz a  coolin' in de plates, dey could all go ter de branch en see Brer  Tarrypin kyar out his projick. Brer Tarrypin,\" continued Uncle  Remus, in a tone at once confidential and argumentative, \"weren't  much bigger'n de pa'm er my han', en it look mighty funny fer ter  year 'im braggin' 'bout how he kin out-pull Brer B'ar. But dey  got de bed-cord atter w'ile, en den dey all put out ter de  branch. W'en Brer Tarrypin fine de place he wanter, he tuck one  een er de bed-cord, en gun de yuther een' to Brer B'ar.    \"'Now den, ladies en gents,' sez Brer Tarrypin, sezee, 'you all  go wid Brer B'ar up dar in de woods en I'll stay yer, en w'en you  year me holler, den's de time fer Brer B'ar fer ter see ef he kin  haul in de slack er de rope.

Den he take bof han's en gin a big pull, but, all de same, Brer  Tarrypin ain't budge. Den he tu'n 'roun', he did, en put de rope  cross his shoulders en try ter walk off wid Brer Tarrypin, but  Brer Tarrypin look like he don't feel like walkin'. Den Brer Wolf  he put in en holp Brer B'ar pull, but des like he didn't, en den  dey all holp 'im, en, bless grashus! w'iles dey wuz all a  pullin', Brer Tarrypin, he holler, en ax um w'y dey don't take up  de slack.    \"Den w'en Brer Tarrypin feel um quit pullin', he dove down, he  did, en ontie de rope, en by de time dey got ter de branch, Brer  Tarrypin, he wuz settin' in de aidge er de water des ez natchul  ez de nex' un, en he up'n say, sezee:    \"'Dat las' pull er yone wuz a mighty stiff un, en a leetle mo'n  you'd er had me,' sezee. 'You er monstus stout, Brer B'ar,'  sezee, 'en you pulls like a yoke er steers, but I sorter had de  purchis on you,' sezee.    \"Den Brer B'ar, bein's his mouf 'gun ter water atter de  sweetnin,' he up'n say he speck de candy's ripe, en off dey put  atter it!\"    \"It's a wonder,\" said the little boy, after a while, \"that the  rope didn't break.\"    \"Break who?\" exclaimed Uncle Remus, with a touch of  indignation in his tone--\"break who? In dem days, Miss Meadows's  bed-cord would a hilt a mule.\"    This put an end to whatever doubts the child might have  entertained.    *1  Help; helped.      XXVII.  WHY MR.
