In taking Sir  Robert Booth's daughter to Church, he was said to have committed bigamy.  Even while he was in the House of Commons he was known by the name of  'Will Bigamy;' and that _sobriquet_ clung to him ever afterwards. Twenty  years of wholesome domestic intercourse with his first wife did not free  him from the abominable imputation, and his marriage with Miss Clavering  revived the calumny in a new form. Fools were found to believe that he  had married her during Judith Booth's life and that their union had been  concealed for several years instead of a few months. The affair with  Miss Culling was for a time forgotten, and the charge preferred against  the keeper of the queen's conscience was bigamy of a much more recent  date.    In various forms this ridiculous accusation enlivens the squibs of the  pamphleteers of Queen Anne's reign. In the 'New Atalantis' Mrs. Manley  certified that the fair victim was first persuaded by his lordship's  sophistries to regard polygamy as accordant with moral law. Having thus  poisoned her understanding, he gratified her with a form of marriage, in  which his brother Spencer, in clerical disguise, acted the part of a  priest. It was even suggested that the bride in this mock marriage was  the lawyer's ward. Never squeamish about the truth, when he could gain a  point by falsehood, Swift endorsed the spiteful fabrication, and in the  _Examiner_, pointing at Lord Cowper, wrote--\"This gentleman, knowing  that marriage fees were a considerable perquisite to the clergy, found  out a way of improving them cent. per cent. for the benefit of the  Church. His invention was to marry a second wife while the first was  alive; convincing her of the lawfulness by such arguments as he did not  doubt would make others follow the same example. _These he had drawn up  in writing with intention to publish for the general good, and it is  hoped he may now have leisure to finish them._\" It is possible that the  words in italics were the cause of Voltaire's astounding statement:  \"Plusieurs curieux ont encore le petit livre que ce Chancelier composa  en faveur de la Polygamie.\" On this point Lord Campbell, confidently  advancing an opinion which can scarcely command unanimous assent, says,  \"The fable of the '_Treatise_' is evidently taken from the panegyric on  'a plurality of wives,' which Mrs. Manley puts into the mouth of Lord  Cowper, in a speech supposed to be addressed by Hernando to Lousia.\" But  whether Voltaire accepted the 'New Atalantis,' or the _Examiner_, as an  authority for the statements of his very laughable passage, it is  scarcely credible that he believed himself to be penning the truth. The  most reasonable explanation of the matter appears to be, that tickled  by Swift's venomous lines, the sarcastic Frenchman in malice and gaiety  adopted them, and added to their piquancy by the assurance that the  Chancellor's book was not only published, but was preserved by  connoisseurs as a literary curiosity.    Like his elder brother, the Chancellor, Spencer Cowper married at an  early age, lived to wed a second wife, and was accused of immorality  that was foreign to his nature. The offence with which the younger  Cowper was charged, created so wide and profound a sensation, and gave  rise to such a memorable trial, that the reader will like to glance at  the facts of the case.    Born in 1669, Spencer Cowper was scarcely of age when he was called to  the bar, and made Comptroller of the Bridge House Estate. The office,  which was in the gift of the corporation of London, provided him with a  good income, together with a residence in the Bridge House, St. Olave's,  Southwark, and brought him in contact with men who were able to bring  him briefs or recommend him to attorneys. For several years the  boy-barrister was thought a singularly lucky fellow. His hospitable  house was brightened by a young and lovely wife (Pennington, the  daughter of John Goodeve), and he was so much respected in his locality  that he was made a justice of the peace. In his profession he was  equally fortunate: his voice was often heard at Westminster and on the  Home Circuit, the same circuit where his brother William practised and  his family interest lay. He found many clients.    Envy is the shadow of success; and the Cowpers were watched by men who  longed to ruin them. From the day when they armed and rode forth to  welcome the Prince of Orange, the lads had been notably fortunate.  Notwithstanding his reputation for immorality William Cowper had sprung  into lucrative practice, and in 1695 was returned to Parliament as  representative for Hartford, the other seat for the borough being filled  by his father, Sir William Cowper.    In spite of their comeliness and complaisant manners, the lightness of  their wit and the _prestige_ of their success, Hertford heard murmurs  that the young Cowpers were _too_ lucky by half, and that the Cowper  interest was dangerously powerful in the borough. It was averred that  the Cowpers were making unfair capital out of liberal professions: and  when the Hertford Whigs sent the father and son to the House of Commons,  the vanquished party cursed in a breath the Dutch usurper and his  obsequious followers.    It was resolved to damage the Cowpers:--by fair means or foul, to render  them odious in their native town.    Ere long the malcontents found a good cry.    Scarcely less odious to the Hertford Tories than the Cowpers themselves  was an influential Quaker of the town, named Stout, who actively  supported the Cowper interest. A man of wealth and good repute, this  follower of George Fox exerted himself enthusiastically in the election  contest of 1695: and in acknowledgment of his services the Cowpers  honored him with their personal friendship. Sir William Cowper asked him  to dine at Hertford Castle--the baronet's country residence; Sir  William's sons made calls on his wife and daughter. Of course these  attentions from Cowpers to 'the Shaker' were offensive to the Tory  magnates of the place: and they vented their indignation in whispers,  that the young men never entered Stout's house without kissing his  pretty daughter.    While these rumors were still young, Mr. Stout died leaving considerable  property to his widow, and to his only child--the beauteous Sarah; and  after his death the intercourse between the two families became yet more  close and cordial. The lawyers advised the two ladies about the  management of their property: and the baronet gave them invitations to  his London House in Hatton Garden, as well as to Hertford Castle. The  friendship had disastrous consequences. Both the brothers were very  fascinating men--men, moreover, who not only excelled in the art of  pleasing, but who also habitually exercised it. From custom,  inclination, policy, they were very kind to the mother and daughter;  probably paying the latter many compliments which they would never have  uttered had they been single men. Coming from an unmarried man the  speech is often significant of love, which on the lips of a husband is  but the language of courtesy. But, unfortunately, Miss ('Mistress' is  her style in the report of a famous trial) Sarah Stout fell madly in  love with Spencer Cowper notwithstanding the impossibility of marriage.    Not only did she conceive a dangerous fondness for him, but she openly  expressed it--by speech and letters. She visited him in the Temple, and  persecuted him with her embarrassing devotion whenever he came to  Hertford. It was a trying position for a young man not thirty years of  age, with a wife to whom he was devotedly attached, and a family whose  political influence in his native town might be hurt by publication of  the girl's folly. Taking his elder brother into his confidence, he asked  what course he ought to pursue. To withdraw totally and abruptly from  the two ladies, would be cruel to the daughter, insulting to the mother;  moreover, it would give rise to unpleasant suspicions and prejudicial  gossip in the borough. It was decided that Spencer must repress the  girl's advances--must see her loss frequently--and, by a reserved and  frigid manner, must compel her to assume an appearance of womanly  discretion. But the plan failed.    At the opening of the year 1699 she invited him to take up his quarters  in her mother's house, when he came to Hertford at the next Spring  Assizes. This invitation he declined, saying that he had arranged to  take his brother's customary lodgings in the house of Mr. Barefoot, in  the Market Place, but with manly consideration he promised to call upon  her. \"I am glad,\" Sarah wrote to him on March 5, 1699, \"you have not  quite forgot there is such a person as I in being: but I am willing to  shut my eyes and not see anything that looks like unkindness in you, and  rather content myself with what excuses you are pleased to make, than be  inquisitive into what I must not know: I am sure the winter has been too  unpleasant for me to desire the continuance of it: and I wish you were  to endure the sharpness of it but for one short hour, as I have done for  many long nights and days, and then I believe it would move that rocky  heart of yours that can be so thoughtless of me as you are.\"    On Monday, March 13, following the date of the words just quoted,  Spencer Cowper rode into Hertford, alighted at Mrs. Stout's house, and  dined with the ladies. Having left the house after dinner, in order that  he might attend to some business, he returned in the evening and supped  with the two women. Supper over, Mrs. Stout retired for the night,  leaving her daughter and the young barrister together. No sooner had the  mother left the room, than a distressing scene ensued.    Unable to control or soothe her, Spencer gently divided the clasp of her  hands, and having freed himself from her embrace, hastened from the room  and abruptly left the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2781"],[0,"Just So Stories (#15)"],[1,"ys, I will hunt you till I catch you, and when I catch  you I will bite you. And so shall all proper Dogs do after me.'    'Ah,' said the Woman, listening, 'this is a very clever Cat, but he is  not so clever as the Dog.'    Cat counted the Dog's teeth (and they looked very pointed) and he said,  'I will be kind to the Baby while I am in the Cave, as long as he does  not pull my tail too hard, for always and always and always. But still I  am the Cat that walks by himself, and all places are alike to me.'    'Not when I am near,' said the Dog. 'If you had not said that last I  would have shut my mouth for always and always and always; but now I am  going to hunt you up a tree whenever I meet you. And so shall all proper  Dogs do after me.'    Then the Man threw his two boots and his little stone axe (that makes  three) at the Cat, and the Cat ran out of the Cave and the Dog chased  him up a tree; and from that day to this, Best Beloved, three proper Men  out of five will always throw things at a Cat whenever they meet him,  and all proper Dogs will chase him up a tree. But the Cat keeps his side  of the bargain too. He will kill mice and he will be kind to Babies when  he is in the house, just as long as they do not pull his tail too hard.  But when he has done that, and between times, and when the moon gets up  and night comes, he is the Cat that walks by himself, and all places are  alike to him. Then he goes out to the Wet Wild Woods or up the Wet Wild  Trees or on the Wet Wild Roofs, waving his wild tail and walking by his  wild lone.           PUSSY can sit by the fire and sing,         Pussy can climb a tree,       Or play with a silly old cork and string         To'muse herself, not me.       But I like Binkie my dog, because         He Lnows how to behave;       So, Binkie's the same as the First Friend was,         And I am the Man in the Cave.         Pussy will play man-Friday till         It's time to wet her paw       And make her walk on the window-sill         (For the footprint Crusoe saw);       Then she fluffles her tail and mews,         And scratches and won't attend.       But Binkie will play whatever I choose,         And he is my true First Friend.         Pussy will rub my knees with her head         Pretending she loves me hard;       But the very minute I go to my bed         Pussy runs out in the yard,       And there she stays till the morning-light;         So I know it is only pretend;       But Binkie, he snores at my feet all night,         And he is my Firstest Friend!          THE BUTTERFLY THAT STAMPED    THIS, O my Best Beloved, is a story--a new and a wonderful story--a  story quite different from the other stories--a story about The Most  Wise Sovereign Suleiman-bin-Daoud--Solomon the Son of David.    There are three hundred and fifty-five stories about Suleiman-bin-Daoud;  but this is not one of them. It is not the story of the Lapwing who  found the Water; or the Hoopoe who shaded Suleimanbin-Daoud from the  heat. It is not the story of the Glass Pavement, or the Ruby with  the Crooked Hole, or the Gold Bars of Balkis. It is the story of the  Butterfly that Stamped.    Now attend all over again and listen!    Suleiman-bin-Daoud was wise. He understood what the beasts said, what  the birds said, what the fishes said, and what the insects said. He  understood what the rocks said deep under the earth when they bowed in  towards each other and groaned; and he understood what the trees  said when they rustled in the middle of the morning. He understood  everything, from the bishop on the bench to the hyssop on the wall, and  Balkis, his Head Queen, the Most Beautiful Queen Balkis, was nearly as  wise as he was.    Suleiman-bin-Daoud was strong. Upon the third finger of the right hand  he wore a ring. When he turned it once, Afrits and Djinns came Out of  the earth to do whatever he told them. When he turned it twice, Fairies  came down from the sky to do whatever he told them; and when he turned  it three times, the very great angel Azrael of the Sword came dressed  as a water-carrier, and told him the news of the three worlds,  Above--Below--and Here.    And yet Suleiman-bin-Daoud was not proud. He very seldom showed off, and  when he did he was sorry for it. Once he tried to feed all the animals  in all the world in one day, but when the food was ready an Animal came  out of the deep sea and ate it up in three mouthfuls. Suleiman-bin-Daoud  was very surprised and said, 'O Animal, who are you?' And the Animal  said, 'O King, live for ever! I am the smallest of thirty thousand  brothers, and our home is at the bottom of the sea. We heard that you  were going to feed all the animals in all the world, and my brothers  sent me to ask when dinner would be ready.' Suleiman-bin-Daoud was more  surprised than ever and said, 'O Animal, you have eaten all the dinner  that I made ready for all the animals in the world.' And the Animal  said, 'O King, live for ever, but do you really call that a dinner?  Where I come from we each eat twice as much as that between meals.' Then  Suleiman-bin-Daoud fell flat on his face and said, 'O Animal! I gave  that dinner to show what a great and rich king I was, and not because I  really wanted to be kind to the animals. Now I am ashamed, and it serves  me right. Suleiman-bin-Daoud was a really truly wise man, Best Beloved.  After that he never forgot that it was silly to show off; and now the  real story part of my story begins.    He married ever so many wifes. He married nine hundred and ninety-nine  wives, besides the Most Beautiful Balkis; and they all lived in a great  golden palace in the middle of a lovely garden with fountains. He  didn't really want nine-hundred and ninety-nine wives, but in those  days everybody married ever so many wives, and of course the King had to  marry ever so many more just to show that he was the King.    Some of the wives were nice, but some were simply horrid, and the horrid  ones quarrelled with the nice ones and made them horrid too, and then  they would all quarrel with Suleiman-bin-Daoud, and that was horrid  for him. But Balkis the Most Beautiful never quarrelled with  Suleiman-bin-Daoud. She loved him too much. She sat in her rooms in the  Golden Palace, or walked in the Palace garden, and was truly sorry for  him.    Of course if he had chosen to turn his ring on his finger and call  up the Djinns and the Afrits they would have magicked all those nine  hundred and ninety-nine quarrelsome wives into white mules of the desert  or greyhounds or pomegranate seeds; but Suleiman-bin-Daoud thought that  that would be showing off. So, when they quarrelled too much, he only  walked by himself in one part of the beautiful Palace gardens and wished  he had never been born.    One day, when they had quarrelled for three weeks--all nine hundred and  ninety-nine wives together--Suleiman-bin-Daoud went out for peace  and quiet as usual; and among the orange trees he met Balkis the Most  Beautiful, very sorrowful because Suleiman-bin-Daoud was so worried.  And she said to him, 'O my Lord and Light of my Eyes, turn the ring upon  your finger and show these Queens of Egypt and Mesopotamia and  Persia and China that you are the great and terrible King.' But  Suleiman-bin-Daoud shook his head and said, 'O my Lady and Delight of my  Life, remember the Animal that came out of the sea and made me ashamed  before all the animals in all the world because I showed off. Now, if  I showed off before these Queens of Persia and Egypt and Abyssinia and  China, merely because they worry me, I might be made even more ashamed  than I have been.'    And Balkis the Most Beautiful said, 'O my Lord and Treasure of my Soul,  what will you do?'    And Suleiman-bin-Daoud said, 'O my Lady and Content of my Heart, I  shall continue to endure my fate at the hands of these nine hundred and  ninety-nine Queens who vex me with their continual quarrelling.'    So he went on between the lilies and the loquats and the roses and the  cannas and the heavy-scented ginger-plants that grew in the garden, till  he came to the great camphor-tree that was called the Camphor Tree of  Suleiman-bin-Daoud. But Balkis hid among the tall irises and the spotted  bamboos and the red lillies behind the camphor-tree, so as to be near  her own true love, Suleiman-bin-Daoud.    Presently two Butterflies flew under the tree, quarrelling.    Suleiman-bin-Daoud heard one say to the other, 'I wonder at your  presumption in talking like this to me. Don't you know that if I stamped  with my foot all Suleiman-bin-Daoud's Palace and this garden here would  immediately vanish in a clap of thunder.'    Then Suleiman-bin-Daoud forgot his nine hundred and ninety-nine  bothersome wives, and laughed, till the camphor-tree shook, at the  Butterfly's boast. And he held out his finger and said, 'Little man,  come here.'    The Butterfly was dreadfully frightened, but he managed to fly up to  the hand of Suleiman-bin-Daoud, and clung there, fanning himself.  Suleiman-bin-Daoud bent his head and whispered very softly, 'Little man,  you know that all your stamping wouldn't bend one blade of grass. What  made you tell that awful fib to your wife?--for doubtless she is your  wife.'    The Butterfly looked at Suleiman-bin-Daoud and saw the most wise King's  eye twinkle like stars on a frosty night, and he picked up his courage  with both wings, and he put his head on one side and said, 'O King, live  for ever. She is my wife; and you know what wives are like.    Suleiman-bin-Daoud smiled in his beard and said, 'Yes, I know, little  brother.    'One must keep them in order somehow, said the Butterfly, and she has  been quarrelling with me all the morning. I said that to quiet her.'    And Suleiman-bin-Daoud said, 'May it quiet her. Go back to your wife,  little brother, and let me hear what you say.'    Back flew the Butterfly to his wife, who was all of a twitter behind  a leaf, and she said, '"]]]
