From the problem  of the licence in cross-examination, their talk strayed to Roman and  mediaeval torture, to the examining magistrate in France and the Third  Degree in America.    \"I've been reading,\" said Flambeau, \"of this new psychometric method  they talk about so much, especially in America. You know what I mean;  they put a pulsometer on a man's wrist and judge by how his heart goes  at the pronunciation of certain words. What do you think of it?\"    \"I think it very interesting,\" replied Father Brown; \"it reminds me  of that interesting idea in the Dark Ages that blood would flow from a  corpse if the murderer touched it.\"    \"Do you really mean,\" demanded his friend, \"that you think the two  methods equally valuable?\"    \"I think them equally valueless,\" replied Brown. \"Blood flows, fast or  slow, in dead folk or living, for so many more million reasons than we  can ever know. Blood will have to flow very funnily; blood will have  to flow up the Matterhorn, before I will take it as a sign that I am to  shed it.\"    \"The method,\" remarked the other, \"has been guaranteed by some of the  greatest American men of science.\"    \"What sentimentalists men of science are!\" exclaimed Father Brown, \"and  how much more sentimental must American men of science be! Who but a  Yankee would think of proving anything from heart-throbs? Why, they must  be as sentimental as a man who thinks a woman is in love with him if she  blushes. That's a test from the circulation of the blood, discovered by  the immortal Harvey; and a jolly rotten test, too.\"    \"But surely,\" insisted Flambeau, \"it might point pretty straight at  something or other.\"    \"There's a disadvantage in a stick pointing straight,\" answered the  other. \"What is it? Why, the other end of the stick always points the  opposite way. It depends whether you get hold of the stick by the right  end. I saw the thing done once and I've never believed in it since.\" And  he proceeded to tell the story of his disillusionment.    It happened nearly twenty years before, when he was chaplain to his  co-religionists in a prison in Chicago--where the Irish population  displayed a capacity both for crime and penitence which kept him  tolerably busy. The official second-in-command under the Governor was an  ex-detective named Greywood Usher, a cadaverous, careful-spoken Yankee  philosopher, occasionally varying a very rigid visage with an odd  apologetic grimace. He liked Father Brown in a slightly patronizing way;  and Father Brown liked him, though he heartily disliked his theories.  His theories were extremely complicated and were held with extreme  simplicity.    One evening he had sent for the priest, who, according to his custom,  took a seat in silence at a table piled and littered with papers, and  waited. The official selected from the papers a scrap of newspaper  cutting, which he handed across to the cleric, who read it gravely. It  appeared to be an extract from one of the pinkest of American Society  papers, and ran as follows:    \"Society's brightest widower is once more on the Freak Dinner stunt. All  our exclusive citizens will recall the Perambulator Parade Dinner, in  which Last-Trick Todd, at his palatial home at Pilgrim's Pond, caused so  many of our prominent debutantes to look even younger than their years.  Equally elegant and more miscellaneous and large-hearted in social  outlook was Last-Trick's show the year previous, the popular Cannibal  Crush Lunch, at which the confections handed round were sarcastically  moulded in the forms of human arms and legs, and during which more than  one of our gayest mental gymnasts was heard offering to eat his partner.  The witticism which will inspire this evening is as yet in Mr Todd's  pretty reticent intellect, or locked in the jewelled bosoms of our  city's gayest leaders; but there is talk of a pretty parody of the  simple manners and customs at the other end of Society's scale. This  would be all the more telling, as hospitable Todd is entertaining in  Lord Falconroy, the famous traveller, a true-blooded aristocrat fresh  from England's oak-groves. Lord Falconroy's travels began before his  ancient feudal title was resurrected, he was in the Republic in his  youth, and fashion murmurs a sly reason for his return. Miss Etta Todd  is one of our deep-souled New Yorkers, and comes into an income of  nearly twelve hundred million dollars.\"    \"Well,\" asked Usher, \"does that interest you?\"    \"Why, words rather fail me,\" answered Father Brown. \"I cannot think at  this moment of anything in this world that would interest me less. And,  unless the just anger of the Republic is at last going to electrocute  journalists for writing like that, I don't quite see why it should  interest you either.\"    \"Ah!\" said Mr Usher dryly, and handing across another scrap of  newspaper. \"Well, does that interest you?\"    The paragraph was headed \"Savage Murder of a Warder. Convict Escapes,\"  and ran: \"Just before dawn this morning a shout for help was heard  in the Convict Settlement at Sequah in this State. The authorities,  hurrying in the direction of the cry, found the corpse of the warder who  patrols the top of the north wall of the prison, the steepest and most  difficult exit, for which one man has always been found sufficient. The  unfortunate officer had, however, been hurled from the high wall, his  brains beaten out as with a club, and his gun was missing. Further  inquiries showed that one of the cells was empty; it had been occupied  by a rather sullen ruffian giving his name as Oscar Rian. He was only  temporarily detained for some comparatively trivial assault; but he  gave everyone the impression of a man with a black past and a dangerous  future. Finally, when daylight had fully revealed the scene of  murder, it was found that he had written on the wall above the body a  fragmentary sentence, apparently with a finger dipped in blood: 'This  was self-defence and he had the gun. I meant no harm to him or any man  but one. I am keeping the bullet for Pilgrim's Pond--O.R.' A man must  have used most fiendish treachery or most savage and amazing bodily  daring to have stormed such a wall in spite of an armed man.\"    \"Well, the literary style is somewhat improved,\" admitted the priest  cheerfully, \"but still I don't see what I can do for you. I should cut  a poor figure, with my short legs, running about this State after an  athletic assassin of that sort. I doubt whether anybody could find him.  The convict settlement at Sequah is thirty miles from here; the country  between is wild and tangled enough, and the country beyond, where he  will surely have the sense to go, is a perfect no-man's land tumbling  away to the prairies. He may be in any hole or up any tree.\"    \"He isn't in any hole,\" said the governor; \"he isn't up any tree.\"    \"Why, how do you know?\" asked Father Brown, blinking.    \"Would you like to speak to him?\" inquired Usher.    Father Brown opened his innocent eyes wide. \"He is here?\" he exclaimed.  \"Why, how did your men get hold of him?\"    \"I got hold of him myself,\" drawled the American, rising and lazily  stretching his lanky legs before the fire. \"I got hold of him with the  crooked end of a walking-stick. Don't look so surprised. I really did.  You know I sometimes take a turn in the country lanes outside this  dismal place; well, I was walking early this evening up a steep lane  with dark hedges and grey-looking ploughed fields on both sides; and a  young moon was up and silvering the road. By the light of it I saw a man  running across the field towards the road; running with his body bent  and at a good mile-race trot. He appeared to be much exhausted; but when  he came to the thick black hedge he went through it as if it were made  of spiders' webs;--or rather (for I heard the strong branches breaking  and snapping like bayonets) as if he himself were made of stone. In the  instant in which he appeared up against the moon, crossing the road, I  slung my hooked cane at his legs, tripping him and bringing him down.  Then I blew my whistle long and loud, and our fellows came running up to  secure him.\"    \"It would have been rather awkward,\" remarked Brown, \"if you had found  he was a popular athlete practising a mile race.\"    \"He was not,\" said Usher grimly. \"We soon found out who he was; but I  had guessed it with the first glint of the moon on him.\"    \"You thought it was the runaway convict,\" observed the priest simply,  \"because you had read in the newspaper cutting that morning that a  convict had run away.\"    \"I had somewhat better grounds,\" replied the governor coolly. \"I pass  over the first as too simple to be emphasized--I mean that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22305"],[0,"The Naval History of the United States. Volume 1 (#15)"],[1,"conflicts. Thus in the action just recorded only four men  were killed upon the defeated ship, although for more than an hour the  two vessels had exchanged broadsides a distance of less than a hundred  feet apart. The execution done on the British frigate has never been  recorded, but was probably even less.    Only the most fragmentary account can be given of any naval actions in  the year 1776, except those in which America's great naval hero Paul  Jones took part. Of the trivial encounters that go to complete the  naval annals of the year, only the briefest recountal is necessary.  The work of the little brig \"Andrea Doria,\" Capt. Biddle, deserves a  passing mention. This little fourteen-gun craft had the most wonderful  luck in making prizes. Besides capturing two transports loaded with  British soldiers, she took so many merchantmen, that on one cruise she  brought back to port only five of her original crew, the rest having  all been put aboard prizes.    On the 17th of June, the crew of the Connecticut cruiser \"Defence,\" a  fourteen-gun brig, heard the sound of distant cannonading coming  faintly over the water. All sail was crowded upon the brig, and she  made all possible speed to the scene of conflict. About nightfall, she  fell in with four American schooners that had just been having a  tussle with two heavy British transports. Three of the American  vessels were privateers, the fourth was the little cruiser \"Lee\" in  which Capt. John Manly had done such brilliant service. The four  schooners had found the transports too powerful for them, and had  therefore drawn off, but were eager to renew the fray with the help of  the \"Defence.\" Accordingly the \"Defence\" led the way to Nantasket  Roads, where the transports lay at anchor. Capt. Harding wasted little  time in manoeuvring, but, laying his vessel alongside the larger of  the two transports, summoned her commander to strike.    \"Ay, ay--I'll strike,\" was the response from the threatened vessel;  and instantly a heavy broadside was poured into the \"Defence.\" A sharp  action followed, lasting for nearly an hour. The \"Defence\" bore the  brunt of the conflict, for the four schooners did not come to  sufficiently close quarters to be of much assistance against the  enemy. The gunnery of the Americans proved too much for the enemy,  however; and after losing eighteen men, together with a large number  wounded, the British surrendered. The American vessel was a good deal  cut up aloft, and lost nine of her men. The next morning a third  transport was sighted by the \"Defence,\" and speedily overhauled and  captured. More than five hundred British soldiers were thus captured;  and the British thenceforward dared not treat the Americans as rebels,  lest the colonial army authorities should retaliate upon the British  prisoners in their hands.    It was in the year 1776 that the first naval vessel giving allegiance  to the American Colonies showed herself in European waters. This  vessel was the \"Reprisal,\" Capt. Wickes, a small craft, mounting  sixteen guns. Early in the summer of '76, the \"Reprisal\" made a cruise  to Martinique, taking several prizes. When near the island, she  encountered the British sloop-of-war \"Shark,\" and a sharp battle  ensued. In size and weight of metal, the two vessels were about evenly  matched; but the \"Reprisal\" had been sending out so many prize-crews,  that she was short eighty men of her full crew. Therefore, when, after  a brisk interchange of broadsides, the British sloop sheered off, and  left the \"Reprisal\" to continue her course, Capt. Wickes rejoiced in  his escape as being almost equal to a victory.    After completing this cruise, the \"Reprisal\" was ordered to France for  the purpose of conveying thither from Philadelphia Benjamin Franklin,  the ambassador sent from the Colonies to interest the French in the  cause of American liberty. While on the way over, she took two or  three prizes, which were sold in France. After landing her  distinguished passenger, she cruised about in the proverbially  tempestuous Bay of Biscay, where she forced several British vessels to  strike to the American flag, then first seen in those waters. On  returning to France to sell his newly captured prizes, Capt. Wickes  found trouble in store for him. The British ambassador at Paris had  declared that the American cruiser was a detestable pirate; and that  for France to permit the pirate to anchor in her harbors, or sell his  prizes in her markets, was equal to a declaration of war against  England. Wickes was, therefore, admonished to take his ships and  prisoners away. But even in that early day Yankee wit was sharp, and  able to extricate its possessor from troublesome scrapes. Wickes knew  that there were plenty of purchasers to be had for his prizes: so,  gathering a few ship-owners together, he took them out to sea beyond  the jurisdiction of France, and there sold them to the highest bidder.    The money thus obtained Wickes used in purchasing vessels suitable for  armed cruisers. While these were fitting out, the \"Lexington\" and the  \"Dolphin\" arrived in France, and soon joined the \"Reprisal\" in a  cruise around the British Islands. The little squadron fairly swept  the Channel and the Irish Sea of merchantmen. The excitement in  England ran high, and the admiralty despatched all the available  men-of-war in search of the marauders. But the swift-sailing cruisers  escaped all pursuers. Once indeed the \"Reprisal\" came near falling  into the hands of the enemy, but escaped by throwing overboard every  thing movable, sawing away her bulwarks, and even cutting away her  heavy timbers.    The result of this cruise so aroused England, that France no longer  dared to harbor the audacious Yankee cruisers. The \"Lexington\" and  \"Reprisal\" were, therefore, ordered to leave European waters  forthwith. The \"Lexington\" complied first, and when one day out from  the port of Morlaix encountered the British man-of-war cutter \"Alert.\"  The \"Alert\" was the smaller of the two vessels, but her commander had  in him all that pluck and those sterling seamanlike qualities that  made the name of England great upon the ocean. A stiff breeze was  blowing, and a heavy cross sea running, when the two vessels came  together. The gunners sighted their pieces at random and fired,  knowing little whether the shot would go plunging into the waves, or  fly high into the air. As a result, they carried on a spirited  cannonade for upwards of two hours, with the sole effect of carrying  away the top hamper of the \"Alert,\" and exhausting most of the powder  on the American craft.    Finding his ammunition rapidly giving out, the captain of the  \"Lexington\" clapped on all sail, and soon showed his crippled  antagonist a clean pair of heels. But so great was the activity of  the crew of the \"Alert\" that they repaired the damage done aloft, and  in four hours overtook the \"American,\" and opened fire upon her The  battle now became one-sided; for the \"Lexington,\" being short of  powder, could make little resistance to the brisk attack of her  persevering adversary. In less than an hour she was forced to strike  her flag.    The fate of the \"Reprisal\" was even harder than that of her consort.  While crossing the Atlantic on her way back to the coast of America,  she was overtaken by a furious gale. With furled sails and battened  hatches, the little craft made a desperate fight for life. But the  fierce wind carried away her masts and spars, and the tossing waves  opened her seams, so that it became apparent to all on board that the  fate of the gallant craft, that had so nobly defended the cause of  American liberty, was sealed. As the water rose higher and higher in  the hold, the officers saw that it was no longer a question of the  possibility of saving the ship, but that their lives and those of the  crew were in the greatest danger. Boats were lowered; but the angry  white-capped waves tossed them madly aloft, and, turning them over and  over, sent the poor fellows that manned them to their long account.  All hands then set to work at the construction of a huge raft; and  just as the ship's stern settled, it was pushed off, and all that  could reach it clambered on. A few poor fellows clung to the sinking  ship; and their comrades on the raft saw them crowd on the forecastle,  and heard their despairing cries as the good ship threw her prow high  in the air, and sunk stern foremost to the placid depths of the stormy  ocean. But those on the raft were not destined to escape the fate of  their comrades. The haggard sufferers were doomed to see the frail  structure on which their lives depended go slowly to pieces before the  mighty power of the remorseless sea. Bit by bit their foothold  vanished from beneath them. One by one they were swept off into the  seething cauldron of the storm. At last but one man remained, the cook  of the ill-fated vessel, who floated about for three days on a piece  of wreckage, until, half-starved and nearly crazed, he was picked up  by a passing vessel, and told the tale of the wreck. So ended the  career of the patriotic and gallant Capt. Wickes and his crew, and  such is the fate that every stout fellow braves when he dons his blue  jacket and goes to serve his country on the ocean.    In addition to the exploits of the American cruisers upon the high  seas, certain operations of the British navy along the American coast,  during the year 1776, demand attention. Of these the most important  was the attack by Sir Peter Parker upon Charleston, in September of  that year,--an attack made memorable by the determined courage of the  Americans, the daring exploit of Sergt. Jasper, and the discovery of  the remarkable qualities of palmetto logs as a material for  fortifications.    Charleston was then a town of but a few thousand inhabitants; but,  small as it was, it had become particularly obnoxious to the British  on account of the "]]]
