The Church of  Scotland had been expressly recognized as a Protestant Church by the Act  of Union of England and Scotland in 1707. It was therefore contended  that the ministers of that church were entitled to be considered as  \"Protestant Clergy;\" and this contention was sustained by the English  law officers of the Crown in 1819. The opinion expressed by those  learned officials was acted upon, and the Presbyterians of Upper Canada  put forward claims to a share of the Reserves. Their claims were  allowed; whereupon other Protestant denominations followed their  example, and demanded, as \"Protestant Clergy,\" to participate in the  provision made for them. The private and public quarrels which ensued  between leaders of the different sects kept the country in a state of  chronic disturbance; while the greed displayed by professed ministers of  religion furnished a striking practical commentary upon the doctrines  taught by the Founder of all Christian faiths. Opinions were obtained  from eminent lawyers as to the respective rights of the various sects,  and as to the true meaning of the Constitutional Act. The most opposite  conclusions were arrived at by different lawyers, and it became manifest  that no apportionment satisfactory to all the claimants could be made by  any tribunal. The Church of England meanwhile contrived to secure the  great bulk of the spoils. According to a return to the House of Assembly  of lands set apart as glebes in Upper Canada during the forty-six years  from 1787 to 1833, it appears that 22,345 acres were so set apart for  the Clergy of the Church of England, 1160 acres for Ministers of the  Kirk of Scotland, 400 for Roman Catholics, and \"none for any other  denomination of Christians.\"[43]    But there was a broader and stronger argument than any of these purely  technical contentions: an argument founded on experience and practical  utility. No matter what had been the intent of the original framers of  the Constitutional Act, the fact had become patent to all Dissenters,  and even to many liberal-minded lay members of the Anglican Church, that  the Clergy Reserves were a curse to the Province--a mill-stone about her  neck, which dragged her down in spite of all exertions to raise her to  the surface. Not long after this fact had become generally recognized,  an agitation arose in favour of the total abolition of State aid to  religious bodies. The plan advocated by Reformers was the sale of the  Reserves, and the application of the proceeds to public education and  municipal improvements. The agitation was kept up until long after the  period covered by this work, and the object sought to be attained by it  was not fully accomplished until the year 1854. Meanwhile, however, it  was the most important question before the country, and it occupied the  attention of the Legislature during a large part of almost every  session. Here was where the conflict between the two Houses was felt  with most pernicious effect. The advocates of abolition and  secularization clearly had the country with them, and the Assembly  passed Bill after Bill to effect those objects. Their efforts were  utterly nullified by the Upper House, which would not listen to any such  proposals, and which threw out as many Bills relating to this important  subject as the Assembly thought proper to send up for its consideration.  Such were the merits of the long and fiercely-contested question of the  Clergy Reserves.    Another serious obstacle to Upper Canadian prosperity was the continual  interference of the Colonial Office in our domestic concerns. Bills  passed by the Provincial Legislature for the regulation of our own  internal affairs were disallowed with vexatious frequency, and  sometimes, apparently, from mere caprice. Sometimes the irresponsible  Executive, unwilling that their obedient servants in the Upper House  should incur popular odium by opposing the will of the Assembly,  permitted Bills to pass both Houses, and then, through their tool the  Lieutenant-Governor, had these identical measures disallowed. Advice,  the compliance with which could not fail to be prejudicial to the  interests of the colony, was also sent across the Atlantic through the  Lieutenant-Governor, to whom it came back by return post in the shape of  Imperial instructions to be acted upon. The Colonial Minister, whoever  he might for the time happen to be, knew little and cared little about  the British North American colonies, and did not generally concern  himself with despatches to colonial Governors any further than to sign  his name to them. He was thus the unconscious means of furthering  Executive tyranny, and to some extent of alienating the loyalty of the  colonists.    Among other drawbacks, sufficiently serious in themselves and in their  ulterior consequences, but of minor importance when compared with the  all-permeating grievances already referred to, may be mentioned the  quartering of military men upon the colony in the capacity of  Lieutenant-Governors; the unequal representation of the people in the  Assembly; the exorbitant salaries of certain public officials; the union  of judicial and legislative functions in the same persons; the  appointment of judges, sheriffs, magistrates, and other officials during  the pleasure of the Executive, and not during good behaviour.    The evils attendant upon placing the local administration of the  colonies in the hands of military officers, who were inexperienced in  constitutional government, and unfitted by training for such duties as  were demanded of them, have already been glanced at.[44] Such persons  naturally enough found themselves altogether out of their proper element  upon their arrival in the colony, and looked to the Executive  Councillors for advice and instruction. That they should follow the  instruction received, and that they should surrender themselves to the  judgment of those enemies of the public weal, followed almost as a  matter of course. In this way the strength of the oligarchy was  consolidated and enlarged, and its members rendered more and more  independent of public opinion. All that can be urged on behalf of the  Home Ministry, by way of excuse for committing the direction of our  affairs to such persons, is that the position of Lieutenant-Governor of  Upper Canada was not a sufficient inducement to make it sought after by  really capable men. The office, in at least one instance to be hereafter  recorded, went a-begging.    Unequal representation was a fruitful source of discontent, though Upper  Canada was no worse off in that respect than the mother-country prior to  the passing of the Reform Bill of 1832. For years before the Rebellion,  the little district towns of Niagara, Brockville and Cornwall each  enjoyed the privilege of sending a representative to the Assembly. All  three of them were notoriously rotten boroughs--as rotten as Gatton,  Grampound or Old Sarum--and always returned Tory members prepared to do  the bidding of the Executive. By such means was the Assembly corrupted,  and the elective franchise turned into an instrument of oppression. Some  of the salaries of public officials were altogether out of proportion  to the state of the revenue, and to the nature and extent of the duties  performed. Certain highly-paid offices were the merest sinecures, and  had been created for no other purpose than to provide for serviceable  tools of the Administration. The practice of permitting judges to sit  and vote in the Legislature needs no comment. Whatever justification  there might have been for such a union of functions in the first infancy  of the Province, when educated men were few in the land, there was  certainly none in the days when Chief Justice Robinson was Speaker of  the Legislative Council. The effect of making the tenure of office of  judges and other dignitaries dependent on the will of the Executive was  such as has attended upon such a system in all countries where it has  been in vogue. The officials were selected almost entirely from one  political party, and had always an eye upon the nod of their  taskmasters, who had the power to make or unmake them. Whenever it was  desirable, in the supposed interests of the Executive, that the  authority of the courts should be strained to the perversion of  judgment, the dispensing of even-handed justice was altogether a  secondary consideration. Mr. Gourlay's case, to say nothing of that of  Bartemus Ferguson, affords a sufficient illustration of the extent to  which the traditions of the Star Chamber were revived in Upper Canadian  practice, when it was thought desirable to crush a champion of popular  liberty and equal rights.    Such were a few of the burdens which the people of Upper Canada were  compelled to bear in the by-gone epoch when tyranny reigned supreme  throughout the Province: when                           \"the law's delay,     The insolence of office, and the spurns     That patient merit of the unworthy takes,\"    were the all too frequent portion of such of the inhabitants as dared to  call in question the righteousness of existing ordinances. There was a  further intolerable grievance which was closely bound up with, and  which, so to speak, grew out of or sustained all the rest: which  comprehended within itself all the evils affecting the body politic, and  which left traces of its existence that have survived down to the  present time. This was the Family Compact--a phrase which is in  everybody's mouth, but the significance whereof, I venture to think, is  in general but imperfectly understood. The subject deserves a chapter to  itself.

But the true tale must follow its subject through the  valley of the shadow of death, and on to his grave.    The remainder of '79 and beginning of '80 were spent at Morton in  finishing the 'History of the Reign of Queen Anne;' but the work did not  go on with the ease and pleasure of former works, and on its conclusion,  Dr Burton formed the resolution to sell his library. This determination  was combated by his family and friends, as well as by his friendly  publisher, with all the arguments in their power, but in vain. Dr Burton  never would allow that parting with his treasured volumes, the  collection of which had been the pride of his life, cost him a pang. He  had done with his books, he said. They were no book-hunter's library,  but a collection made for use, and, that use over, had better be again  turned into money. Dr Burton did not contemplate undertaking any other  great work; and the possession of so extensive a library forced him to  live in a larger house than was convenient, and rendered leaving it very  troublesome. In the proceeds of its sale Dr Burton was again  disappointed. But before it could be brought to sale, while he was  engaged in the laborious task of cataloguing his books for sale, he  refreshed himself by a summer trip to Shetland, taking Aberdeen on his  return journey, where he had the gratification of being present at the  baptism of his little grandchild, the daughter of Dr and Mrs Rodger.    He wrote from Lerwick, 8th July 1880:--         \"MY DEAR LOVE,--I am not in what might be called an interesting       country--low hills, rocky, stony, heathery, and peaty--but a new       country has always something of interest to pass the time with. I       saw a valuable archaeological phenomenon to-day. The Roman roads       were all paved, and went straight over hill and across       valley--never troubled about levels. In the parts of Britain where       the Romans are historically known to have been, such roads have       been fully identified. But there, as well as in other places, where       it has been questioned if the Romans ever were--any road strewn or       surfaced with stones that have been laid down in the paving of the       road, is adopted as a Roman road. I have often supposed that this       conclusion was too readily adopted. And to-day I walked for some       distance on a road that has all the requisites--yet no one is wild       enough to say that the Romans were in Shetland. The weather to-day       was warmer than I have yet known it, the sun, such as he is, having       nearly the whole twenty-four hours to do his work in. The next       stage will be Kirkwall, then Wick.         \"I shall intimate my motions as I find them coming up for       consideration. I feel very elastic. There is nothing in my mind       demanding either hard work or anxious adjustment. The 'Queen Anne'       pressed very hard on me before I had done; and the press has rather       too justly noticed a slovenliness about the conclusion. Then came       immediately various cares and troubles, accompanied by the not very       severe, but tedious, drudgery of the index; but I am not going to       grumble more, since I am at present in comparative freedom and       idleness.--Yours, my dear love, J.H. BURTON.\"    The next is dated merely _Sunday_.         \"MY DEAR LOVE,-- ... The weather here has been divine, with       daylight, one may say, for twenty-four hours. The people are kind       and cleanly, and all the necessaries of life are abundant. I do not       know when I have enjoyed better health. There is nothing abnormal       about me, except the extent of my appetite. Walking thirty miles       here, is less fatiguing than from Morton to Edinburgh.         \"Love to all the household, and remembrances to guests, from yours       affectionately, J.H.

No direct question on the point was put to me, and       I let the affair take its run, though a good deal to the       bewilderment of some people, who I saw really knew me.[21] Good       cold weather: seeing one by one the remnants of my generation of       school and college friends.--Love to all, from your affectionate         \"J.H.

Passing Wire and Rousay, I recalled       some association in the names, and I think it was with poor nurse       Barbara. I was able to call on Mat.'s old friend, Mrs Burroughs;       her husband, now General, was out. They live in great grandeur, on       about the dreariest hillside Nature ever created.\"         [Footnote 21: A rather amusing comment on this letter is conveyed       in the following extract from one addressed to Dr Burton's       publishers, by Mr George M'Crie, a grandson of the eminent Scotch       divine of the same name:--         \"In the month of July last year, I happened to be travelling       southward, in the steamer St Magnus, from Orkney. Before calling at       Wick, and while the tourists on board were gazing at John o'       Groat's House, I was spoken to by an elderly gentleman, on the       'bridge,' regarding some of the steamer's arrangements. I satisfied       his curiosity as well as I was able, and thought no more of the       matter. We had a large number of passengers, and I did not notice       him again until we were coming out together in a boat, after a       ramble on shore at Pulteneytown. A fellow-passenger, who had       previously noticed the elderly gentleman and myself in       conversation, then whispered to me, 'A celebrated literary man       that, sir, with whom you were speaking before we went ashore; no       other than the famous Judge Haliburton of America, the author of       \"Sam Slick.\"' Some doubt, I must confess, crossed my mind at this       stage. I surely had heard of the Judge's death some years before,       but thinking, very pardonably, that I must be mistaken, I replied,       'Oh, indeed!' and viewed my late acquaintance with some curiosity.       I am imaginative, but it was difficult, in truth, to connect this       staid and sober personage with the idea of the American satirist,       however proverbially dissimilar authors may be to their own       creations. However, I am no hunter after celebrities, literary or       otherwise, and I would not, in all likelihood, have taken any steps       to further conversation with the one in question, had he not, by       chance, been seated close beside me on the quarterdeck when we       resumed our journey south. The steamer was rolling heavily, and his       seat was not a comfortable one. I gave him a camp-stool which I had       secured, and in return he kindly again entered into conversation       with me. We talked about many things, but I could not help thinking       that the American author seemed well informed, for a transatlantic       stranger, regarding the coast, the route generally, and, singularly       enough, regarding Scottish antiquities. At last an observation,       which I timidly hazarded regarding the United States, showed me, in       the reply it received, that I was hopelessly at sea regarding my       fellow-passenger's identity. Before we came to Aberdeen he had told       me that his name was John Hill Burton. The similarity of the sound       of the names had misled my too easily persuaded informant and my       own credulous self. I had taken the author of the 'Book-hunter' for       the author of the 'Clockmaker'!         \"Dr Hill Burton most kindly continued to converse with me for       several hours after we had exchanged cards. My own is a name not       unconnected with Scottish ecclesiastical history, and this, to him,       was a sufficient topic. Being an Edinburgh man by birth, I ought to       have known him by sight, but I have been absent from my native city       for many years, and may be excused for not recognising one of       Edinburgh's most distinguished dwellers, now unhappily lost to us.         \"G.M.
