He said:--    As you, my dear Mother, were always anxious about my health, I write  to-day to assure you that since I left home it has been extremely good.  I think I am making some small progress in those attainments which are  only acquired by prayer, and holy devotedness to God. I find the work I  have undertaken is an all-important one. I have many things to learn,  and many things to unlearn. I have had some severe trials, and some  mortifying scenes. At other times I have been unspeakably blessed, and I  have been greatly encouraged at some favourable prospects. Several times  my views have been greatly enlarged, and my mind enlightened, while,  with a warm and full heart, I have been trying to address a large and  much affected congregation. It is not my endeavour to shine, or to  please, but to speak to the heart and the conscience. And with a view to  this, I have aimed at the root of injurious prejudices, and notions that  I have found prevalent in different places. I find, by experience, that  a firm reliance on the power and grace of Christ is everything. I hope  that you, my dear Mother, will pray for me that the Lord will give me  grace, power, and wisdom to do my whole duty.    I am very sorry to hear of your ill-health. I hope and pray that the  Father of all mercies will continue to support, comfort, and deliver  you, in the midst of your afflictions and sorrows. Blessed be the Lord,  dear Mother, the day is not far distant when you can rest your weary  spirit in the arms of Jesus; and should I survive you, while you are  pursuing the blessed, triumphant theme of redeeming love, in strains the  most exalted, I will endeavour in my feeble way to follow you to the  same blessed kingdom.    Brother William received a letter from John last week. His health is  very bad. His excessive labour has overcome him. He has forty  appointments in four weeks. He is now stationed in Kingston.--H.]         _April 25th._--For several days past I have been altogether engaged       in writing a controversial pamphlet, and have attended little to       the duty of self-examination.         _April 28th._--I have been much blessed in reading the Journal of       John Nelson. When I compare the unwearied labours, and severe       sufferings of that brave soldier of the Cross, with my little       efforts and sufferings, I blush for my lukewarmness, and am ashamed       of my fearfulness.    _May 10th._--[In these early days, the Methodist ministers had but  little time for study before commencing their ministerial labours, and,  as Dr. Ryerson often told me, they had to resort to many expedients to  secure the necessary time for reading and study. This had often to be  done on horseback. Dr. Ryerson's eldest brother, George, who had  attended Union College, N.Y., turned his advantages in this respect to a  good account. He sought to stimulate his younger brothers to devote  every spare moment to suitable preparation for their work. In reply to a  letter on this subject, from Rev. George Ryerson to his brother William,  he said:--         I thank you for your kind advice respecting composition, and shall       endeavour to follow it, although my necessary duties leave but very       little time for literary improvement. Since I saw you, I have been       principally engaged in Biblical studies which I find both       profitable and interesting. I am now engaged in reading the Bible       through in course with Dr. Adam Clarke's notes, also Paley's books.       I received a letter from brother John a few days since. He had       received a number into the Society, and there were a number more       who appeared to be seriously awakened. Elder Madden, who was at       York last week, says that Egerton is well, and that the cause of       religion is prospering in York, and on the Yonge Street Circuit. We       have had but very little increase in Niagara since I saw you,       although our congregation is very large and attentive.--H.]    _May 18th._--[In writing to-day to his brother George, Dr. Ryerson  mentioned that he and Elder Case had visited the Credit Indians. Elder  Case, he said, had come up to get Mrs. Wm. Kerr (_nee_ Brant) to correct  the translation of one of the Gospels, and some hymns, in order to have  them printed. He also wished Peter Jones to go down and preach to the  Indians on the Bay of Quinte (Tyendinaga). It was there, he said, that  the work of religion had begun to spread among them. About twelve had  experienced religion, and others are under awakening. They do not, he  said, understand enough English to receive religious instruction in that  language; and, therefore, he wished Peter Jones to go down for two or  three weeks.    In this letter Dr. Ryerson said: I think the cause of religion is  prospering in different parts of the Circuit. Upwards of thirty have  been added to us in this town (York) since Conference, and our present  prospects are equally encouraging. My colleague is a man who is wholly  devoted to the work of saving souls. I hope that God will give us an  abundant harvest.    I am employing all my leisure time in the prosecution of my studies. I  also practice composition. I am reading Rollin's Ancient History, Greek,  and miscellaneous works. Are Father, and Mother, and all the family  well? How are their minds disposed towards God and heaven?    We have formed a Missionary Society in this place. I think we shall  collect $40 or $50. I hope that period is not remote when the whole  colony will be brought into a state of salvation!--H.]         _June 7th._--My mind has been much afflicted with care and anxiety,       for some days, on account of the controversy in which I am engaged.       I feel it to be the cause of God; and I am resolved to follow truth       and the Holy Scriptures in whatever channel they will lead me. Oh,       Lord, I commend my feeble efforts to thy blessings! Grant me wisdom       from above; and take the cause into thy own hands, for thy name's       sake!         _June 25th._--I have spent some days in visiting my friends, and       also attending a Camp-meeting. The weather has been very       unfavourable; but the showers that watered the earth are now past,       and showers of Divine blessing are descending. The song of praise       is ascending, and sinners are crying for mercy. Oh, Lord, carry on       the glorious work!         _July 7th._--The enemy gained victory over me to-day, by tempting       me to neglect Class for other employments. But I was defeated.       Company coming in, I was hindered from doing what I desired.       Conscience condemned, and darkness and distress followed. Oh, Lord,       henceforth help me _to do my duty_!         _July 9th.--Sabbath._--I was called this evening to a drunken,       dying man. He was entirely ignorant both of his bodily and       spiritual danger. What a scene! An immortal soul just plunging into       hell, and yet hoping for heaven! How awful is the state of one whom       God gives over to believe a lie! His life is ended, his family       destitute, and his soul lost!         _July 19th._--Surely nothing can afford more pleasure to an       enquiring mind bent on historical researches, than the perusal of       documents relating to the ancient chosen people of God. That a       people who could, according to their legitimate records, number       more than eight hundred thousand fighting men, should slip from the       records of men, hide themselves from human observation, and inhabit       limits beyond geographical research, is a phenomenon unprecedented       in the world's history; and that they should remain in this state       more than two thousand years, among the vast discoveries which       travellers have made, is still more surprising. Such is the       wonderful government of Him whose ways are past finding out. I       trust the day is not far distant when the lost will be found, and       the dead be alive!         _July 26th._--For several days I have been holding meetings and       conferences with the Indians. Their hearts are open to receive       instruction, and their hands extended to receive the bread of life.       If the Lord will open the way, I will try to acquire a knowledge of       their language. My soul longs to bring them to the Word of Truth.         _July 30th._--A day or two since I had the pleasure of seeing a       brother whose ecclesiastical duties have separated us for nearly a       year. How many tender recollections of God's care and merciful       dealings, since our last meeting rushed upon our minds. But while       enabled to rejoice together, we were called upon to mourn the loss       of one brother, taken away to the world of spirits.         _August 17th._--Scarcely a day passes without beholding new       openings to extend my ministerial labours. To-day, in an affecting       manner, I witnessed the hands of suffering humanity stretched forth       to receive the word of life. More than five hundred aborigines of       the country were assembled in one place. In a moral point of view,       they may be said to be \"sitting in the valley of the shadow of       death.\" \"The day star from on high\" has not yet dawned upon them.       Alas! are they to perish for lack of knowledge? Can not the dry       bones live? Oh, thou who art able to raise up children unto       Abraham! speak the word, devise the means, and these long lost       prodigals shall return to their father's house! I noticed activity,       both in body and mind, superior skill in curious workmanship;       genius flashed in their countenances; and yet shall these noble       powers be bound fast in the cruel chains of ignorance, and these       immortal spirits go from a rayless night to midnight tomb? Oh, Thou       Light of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24593"],[0,"The Oriental Story Book: A Collection of Tales (#15)"],[1,"use, and  wait for him to come out. When, then, the door opened, and at first  the immense head and still larger turban peered forth, when the rest  of the body followed covered with a small cloak which had been  irregularly curtailed, with wide pantaloons, and a broad girdle in  which hung a long dagger, so long that one could not tell whether Muck  was fastened to the dagger, or the dagger to Muck--when in this guise  he came forth, then would the air resound with our cries of joy; then  would we fling our caps aloft, and dance round him, like mad. Little  Muck, however, would salute us with a serious bow, and walk with long  strides through the street, shuffling now and then his feet, for he  wore large wide slippers, such as I have never elsewhere seen. We boys  would run behind him, crying continually, \"Little Muck! Little Muck!\"  We also had a droll little verse, which we would now and then sing in  his honor; it ran thus:--        \"Little Muck, oh Little Muck!      What a fine, brave dwarf art thou!        Livest in a house so tall;      Goest forth but once a month,        Mountain-headed, though so small.      Turn thyself but once, and look!        Run, and catch us, Little Muck.\"    In this way had we often carried on our sport, and, to my shame, I  must confess that I took the most wicked part in it, for I often  plucked him by the mantle, and once trod from behind on his large  slippers, so that he fell down. This was, at first, a source of the  greatest amusement to me, but my laughter soon ceased when I saw the  Little Muck go up to my father's house; he walked straight in, and  remained there some time. I concealed myself near the door, and saw  Muck come forth again, escorted by my father, who respectfully shook  his hand, and with many bows parted with him at the door. My mind was  uneasy, and I remained some time in my concealment; at length,  however, hunger, which I feared more than blows, drove me in, and  ashamed and with downcast head, I walked in before my father.    \"Thou hast, as I hear, insulted the good Muck,\" said he with a very  serious tone. \"I will tell thee the history of this Muck, and then I  am sure thou wilt ridicule him no more. But first, thou shalt receive  thy allowance.\" The allowance was five-and-twenty lashes, which he  took care to count only too honestly. He thereupon took a long  pipe-stem, unscrewed the amber mouthpiece, and beat me more severely  than he had ever done before.    When the five-and-twenty were all made up, he commanded me to attend,  and told me the following story of Little Muck.           *       *       *       *       *    The father of Little Muck, who is properly called Mukrah, lived here  in Nicea, a respectable, but poor man. He kept himself almost as  retired as his son does now. The latter he could not endure, because  he was ashamed of his dwarfish figure, and let him therefore grow up  in perfect ignorance. When the Little Muck was still in his  seventeenth year, a merry child, his father, a grave man, kept  continually reproaching him, that he, who ought long before to have  trodden down the shoes of infancy, was still so stupid and childish.    The old man, however, one day had a bad fall, from the effects of  which he died, and Little Muck was left behind, poor and ignorant. His  cruel relations, to whom the deceased owed more than he could pay,  turned the poor fellow out of the house, and advised him to go forth  into the world, and seek his fortune. Muck answered that he was all  ready, only asking them for his father's dress, which they willingly  granted him. His father had been a large, portly man, and the garments  on that account did not fit him. Muck, however, soon hit upon an  expedient; he cut off what was too long, and then put them on. He  seemed, however, to have forgotten that he must also take from their  width; hence the strange dress that he wears at the present day; the  huge turban, the broad girdle, the wide breeches, the blue cloak, all  these he has inherited from his father, and worn ever since. The long  Damascus dagger of his father, too, he attached to his girdle, and  seizing a little staff, set out from the door.    Gayly he wandered, the whole day, for he had set out to seek his  fortune: if he saw upon the ground a potsherd shining in the sunlight,  he took care to pick it up, in the belief that he could change it into  a diamond of the first water; if he saw in the distance the cupola of  a Mosque sparkling like fire, or the sea glittering like a mirror, he  would hasten up, fully persuaded that he had arrived at fairy-land.  But ah! these phantoms vanished as he approached, and too soon  fatigue, and his stomach gnawed by hunger, convinced him that he was  still in the land of mortals. In this way he travelled two days, in  hunger and grief, and despaired of finding his fortune; the produce of  the field was his only support, the hard earth his bed. On the  morning of the third day, he espied a large city upon an eminence.  Brightly shone the crescent upon her pinnacles, variegated flags waved  over the roofs, and seemed to be beckoning Little Muck to themselves.  In surprise he stood still, contemplating the city and the surrounding  country.    \"There at length will Klein-Muck find his fortune,\" said he to  himself, and in spite of his fatigue bounded in the air; \"there or  nowhere!\" He collected all his strength, and walked towards the city.  But although the latter seemed quite near, he could not reach it until  mid-day, for his little limbs almost entirely refused him their  assistance, and he was obliged to sit down to rest in the shade of a  palm-tree. At last he reached the gate; he fixed the mantle jauntily,  wound the turban still more tastily around his head, made the girdle  broader, and arranged the dagger so as to fall still more obliquely:  then, wiping the dust from his shoes, and seizing his cane, he marched  bravely through the gate.    He had already wandered through a few streets, but nowhere did any  door open to him, nowhere did any one exclaim, as he had anticipated:  \"Little Muck, come in and eat and drink, and rest thy little feet.\"    He was looking very wistfully straight at a large fine house, when a  window opened, and an old woman, putting out her head, exclaimed in a  singing tone--        \"Hither, come hither!        The porridge is here;      The table I've spread,        Come taste of my cheer.      Hither, come hither!        The porridge is hot;      Your neighbors bring with you,        To dip in the pot!\"    The door opened, and Muck saw many dogs and cats walking in. For a  moment he stood in doubt whether he should accept the invitation; at  last, however, he took heart and entered the mansion. Before him  proceeded a couple of genteel kittens, and he resolved to follow them,  since they, perhaps, knew the way to the kitchen better than himself.    When Muck had ascended the steps, he met the same old woman who had  looked forth from the window. With frowning air she asked what he  wanted.    \"Thou hast invited every one to thy porridge,\" answered Little Muck,  \"and as I was very hungry, I came too.\"    The old woman laughed, saying, \"Whence come you then, strange fellow?  The whole city knows that I cook for no one but my dear cats, and now  and then, as you see, I invite their companions from the  neighborhood.\" Little Muck told her how hard it had gone with him  since his father's death, and entreated her to let him dine, that day,  with her cats. The old woman, on whom the frank relation of the little  fellow made quite an impression, permitted him to become her guest,  and gave him abundance to eat and drink. When he was satisfied and  refreshed, she looked at him for some time, and then said:--    \"Little Muck, remain with me in my service; you will have little to  do, and shall be well taken care of.\" Muck, who had relished the  cat-porridge, agreed, and thus became the servant of the Frau Ahavzi.  His duties were light but singular: Frau Ahavzi had two male, and four  female cats; every morning Little Muck had to comb their hair, and  anoint them with costly ointment. When the Frau went out, he had to  give them all his attention; when they ate, he placed their bowls  before them; and, at night, he had to lay them on silken cushions, and  wrap them up in velvet coverings. There were, moreover, a few little  dogs in the house, on which he was obliged to wait; but there were not  so many ceremonies gone through with these as with the cats, whom Frau  Ahavzi treated as her own children. As for the rest, Muck led as  retired a life as in his father's house, for with the exception of the  Frau, he saw every day only dogs and cats.    For a long time it went very well with Little Muck; he had enough to  eat, and but little to do; and the old woman seemed to be perfectly  satisfied with him. But, by-and-by, the cats began to behave very  badly; the moment the Frau went out, they ran around the rooms as if  possessed, threw down every thing in confusion, and broke considerable  fine crockery, which stood in their way. When, however, they heard  their mistress coming up the steps, they would creep to their  cushions, and wag their tails, when they saw her, as if nothing had  happened. The Frau Ahavzi always fell in a passion when she saw her  rooms so disordered, and attributed all to Muck; assert his innocence  as he might, she believed her cats who looked so demure, in preference  to her servant.    Little Muck was very sorry that here also he had been disappointed in  finding his fortune, and determined in his own mind to leave the  service of the Frau Ahavzi. As, however, on his first journey, he had  learned how badly one lives without money, he resolved to procure, in  some way, for himself the wages which his mistress had once promised  him, but had never paid. In the house of the Frau Ahavzi was a room,  which was always closed, and the inside of"]]]
