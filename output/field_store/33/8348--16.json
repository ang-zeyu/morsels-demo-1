[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23280"],[0,"The Shirley Letters from California Mines in 1851-52 (#15)"],[1," optic nerves was so great that I sank helplessly upon one of the  benches, which ran, divan-like, the whole length (ten feet!) of the  building, and laughed till I cried. There was, of course, no floor. A  rude nondescript, in one corner, on which was ranged the medical  library, consisting of half a dozen volumes, did duty as a table. The  shelves, which looked like sticks snatched hastily from the woodpile,  and nailed up without the least alteration, contained quite a  respectable array of medicines. The white-canvas window stared  everybody in the face, with the interesting information painted on it,  in perfect grenadiers of capitals, that this was Dr. ----'s office.    At my loud laugh (which, it must be confessed, was noisy enough to give  the whole street assurance of the presence of a woman) F. looked  shocked, and his partner looked prussic acid. To him (the partner, I  mean; he hadn't been out of the mines for years) the \"office\" was a  thing sacred, and set apart for an almost admiring worship. It was a  beautiful architectural ideal embodied in pine shingles and cotton  cloth. Here he literally \"lived, and moved, and had his being,\" his bed  and his board. With an admiration of the fine arts truly praiseworthy,  he had fondly decorated the walls thereof with sundry pictures from  Godey's, Graham's, and Sartain's magazines, among which, fashion-plates  with imaginary monsters sporting miraculous waists, impossible wrists,  and fabulous feet, largely predominated.    During my call at the office I was introduced to one of the _finders_  of Rich Bar,--a young Georgian,--who afterwards gave me a full  description of all the facts connected with its discovery. This  unfortunate had not spoken to a woman for two years, and, in the  elation of his heart at the joyful event, he rushed out and invested  capital in some excellent champagne, which I, on Willie's principle of  \"doing in Turkey as the Turkeys do,\" assisted the company in drinking,  to the honor of my own arrival. I mention this as an instance that  nothing can be done in California without the sanctifying influence of  the _spirit_, and it generally appears in a much more \"questionable  shape\" than that of sparkling wine. Mr. H. informed me that on the 20th  of July, 1850, it was rumored at Nelson's Creek--a mining station  situated at the Middle Fork of the Feather River, about eighty miles  from Marysville--that one of those vague \"Somebodies,\" a near relation  of the \"They-Says,\" had discovered mines of a remarkable richness in a  northeasterly direction, and about forty miles from the first-mentioned  place. Anxious and immediate search was made for \"Somebody,\" but, as  our Western brethren say, he \"wasn't thar'.\" But his absence could not  deter the miners when once the golden rumor had been set afloat. A  large company packed up their goods and chattels, generally consisting  of a pair of blankets, a frying-pan, some flour, salt pork, brandy,  pickax and shovel, and started for the new Dorado. They \"traveled, and  traveled, and traveled,\" as we used to say in the fairy-stories, for  nearly a week, in every possible direction, when, one evening, weary  and discouraged, about one hundred of the party found themselves at the  top of that famous hill which figures so largely in my letters, whence  the river can be distinctly seen. Half of the number concluded to  descend the mountain that night, the remainder stopping on the summit  until the next morning. On arriving at Rich Bar, part of the  adventurers camped there, but many went a few miles farther down the  river. The next morning, two men turned over a large stone, beneath  which they found quite a sizable piece of gold. They washed a small  panful of the dirt, and obtained from it two hundred and fifty-six  dollars. Encouraged by this success, they commenced staking off the  legal amount of ground allowed to each person for mining purposes, and,  the remainder of the party having descended the hill, before night the  entire bar was \"claimed.\" In a fortnight from that time, the two men  who found the first bit of gold had each taken out six thousand  dollars. Two others took out thirty-three pounds of gold in eight  hours, which is the best day's work that has been done on this branch  of the river. The largest amount ever taken from one panful of dirt was  fifteen hundred dollars. In a little more than a week after its  discovery, five hundred men had settled upon the Bar for the summer.  Such is the wonderful alacrity with which a mining town is built. Soon  after was discovered, on the same side of the river, about half a mile  apart, and at nearly the same distance from this place, the two bars,  Smith and Indian, both very rich, also another, lying across the river,  just opposite Indian, called Missouri Bar. There are several more, all  within a few miles of here, called Frenchman's, Taylor's, Brown's, The  Junction, Wyandott, and Muggin's; but they are, at present, of little  importance as mining stations.    Those who worked in these mines during the fall of 1850 were extremely  fortunate, but, alas! the monte fiend ruined hundreds. Shall I tell you  the fate of two of the most successful of these gold-hunters? From poor  men, they found themselves, at the end of a few weeks, absolutely rich.  Elated with their good fortune, seized with a mania for monte, in less  than a year these unfortunates, so lately respectable and intelligent,  became a pair of drunken gamblers. One of them, at this present  writing, works for five dollars a day, and boards himself out of that;  the other actually suffers for the necessaries of life,--a too common  result of scenes in the mines.    There were but few that dared to remain in the mountains during the  winter, for fear of being buried in the snow, of which, at that time,  they had a most vague idea. I have been told that in these sheltered  valleys it seldom falls to the depth of more than a foot, and  disappears almost invariably within a day or two. Perhaps there were  three hundred that concluded to stay, of which number two thirds  stopped on Smith's Bar, as the labor of mining there is much easier  than it is here. Contrary to the general expectation, the weather was  delightful until about the middle of March. It then commenced storming,  and continued to snow and rain incessantly for nearly three weeks.  Supposing that the rainy season had passed, hundreds had arrived on the  river during the previous month. The snow, which fell several feet in  depth on the mountains, rendered the trail impassable, and entirely  stopped the pack trains. Provisions soon became scarce, and the  sufferings of these unhappy men were indeed extreme. Some adventurous  spirits, with true Yankee hardihood, forced their way through the snow  to the Frenchman's rancho, and packed flour _on their backs_ for more  than forty miles! The first meal that arrived sold for three dollars a  pound. Many subsisted for days on nothing but barley, which is kept  here to feed the pack-mules on. One unhappy individual, who could not  obtain even a little barley for love or money, and had eaten nothing  for three days, forced his way out to the Spanish Rancho, fourteen  miles distant, and in less than an hour after his arrival had devoured  _twenty-seven_ biscuit and a corresponding: quantity of other eatables,  and, of course, drinkables to match. Don't let this account alarm you.  There is no danger of another famine here. They tell me that there is  hardly a building in the place that has not food enough in it to last  its occupants for the next two years; besides, there are two or three  well-filled groceries in town.

Letter _the_ Fourth    ACCIDENTS--SURGERY--DEATH--FESTIVITY    RICH BAR, EAST BRANCH _of the_ NORTH FORK _of_ FEATHER RIVER,    _September_ 22, 1851.      There has been quite an excitement here for the last week, on account  of a successful amputation having been performed upon the person of a  young man by the name of W. As I happen to know all the circumstances  of the case, I will relate them to you as illustrative of the frightful  accidents to which the gold-seekers are constantly liable, and I can  assure you that similar ones happen very often. W. was one of the first  who settled on this river, and suffered extremely from the scarcity of  provisions during the last winter. By steady industry in his laborious  vocation, he had accumulated about four thousand dollars. He was  thinking seriously of returning to Massachusetts with what he had  already gained, when, in the early part of last May, a stone,  unexpectedly rolling from the top of Smith's Hill, on the side of which  he was mining, crushed his leg in the most shocking manner. Naturally  enough, the poor fellow shrank with horror from the idea of an  amputation here in the mountains. It seemed absolutely worse than  death. His physician, appreciating his feelings on the subject, made  every effort to save his shattered limb,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23286"],[0,"The Rover Boys Under Canvas; Or, The Mystery of the Wrecked Submarine (#15)"],[1,"to take hold?\"  questioned Randy.    \"He was going to take hold, but at the last minute he declined,  stating that he had made up his mind to volunteer for the army.\"    \"Well, there must be somebody else.\"    \"There was another student at that college, named Stanley Browne. He  is a cousin of Colonel Colby. We were very good friends, and I thought  sure that we could get him to take charge. But Browne has also gone  into the United States service.\"    \"Oh, if that isn't a shame--every one of them going in and you left  behind!\" grumbled Randy. \"I don't think it's fair at all!\"    \"Well, I suppose I've got to make the best of it,\" answered Tom Rover.  But as he spoke he heaved a mountainous sigh. This being left behind  while his brothers and his best friends went to the front was going to  almost break his heart.          CHAPTER XII    AT THE ROVER COMPANY OFFICES      \"Well, we're off at last! Good-bye to everybody!\"    The words came from Dick Rover as the last call was given for the  volunteers who were going to Camp Huxton to entrain.    \"Don't forget to write regularly!\" came from Sam Rover.    \"Oh, we'll do that--don't fear!\" answered his wife Grace. \"And don't  you forget to answer every letter.\"    \"And please, please, both of you be careful, and don't get hurt!\"  murmured Martha.    \"Oh, say, Martha! don't put a wet blanket on things that way,\"  whispered her brother. \"Don't you know you have to send them away with  a smile?\"    \"And I'm going to,\" she answered quickly, and then began to smile,  even though the tears were forming in her pretty eyes.    \"I know you will take good care of things while we are away, Tom,\"  said Dick Rover to his brother.    \"You can rest assured of that,\" answered Tom Rover. \"Just the same, I  wish I were going along.\"    \"So do I, now that the time has come.\"    \"We may never have to go to France,\" put in Sam Rover. \"The war may be  over before that time.\" Yet, as he spoke, he knew in his heart that  such was not likely to be the case. But he wanted to say something to  ease the minds of his wife and the other womenfolks.    There were quite a number of volunteers to entrain, and friends and  relatives were hurrying this way and that to see them off. Among the  Rovers there was much handshaking and not a few kisses, and then Dick  Rover and Sam entered the train, which, a few seconds later, glided  from the station.    It was a sober crowd that returned to the Rover homes, even Andy and  Randy being subdued. No one felt like talking. Poor Martha seemed to  be the most affected, and had she attempted to speak she would  certainly have broken out crying.    \"Well, I suppose we've got to get back to Colby Hall to finish out the  term,\" remarked Jack, after Tom Rover had departed for the offices in  Wall Street.    \"Gee! I wish I could volunteer and go to that camp,\" sighed Fred.    \"Well, we'll get a touch of camp life soon,\" returned Jack.    He referred to the annual encampment of the Colby Hall students. Every  year the cadets of the school were marched away to some place either  in the mountains or on the seashore, there to erect their tents and  live under canvas for several weeks. During this encampment the cadets  were given a taste of real military life, with strenuous drills and  marches, target and bayonet practice, and usually ending with a  thrilling sham battle.    \"Well, we can't get under canvas any too quick to suit me,\" announced  Randy. \"I'd rather be out in the open air than in the Hall.\"    It was arranged that the young folks should return to Haven Point on  the following morning. Andy and Randy wanted to see as much of their  father as possible, and so decided to run down to Wall Street late in  the afternoon and come home with him.    \"And you fellows can come along, if you want to,\" said Randy to his  cousins.    \"That suits me,\" answered Jack. \"I'd like to see how things look at  the offices. I haven't been down there in a long time.\"    \"I'd like to go, too,\" came from Fred. \"Maybe we can cheer Uncle Tom  up a bit. He certainly deserves it--having all this business thrust on  his shoulders!\"    It did not take the four boys long to reach Wall Street, and then they  hurried down to one of the small but better-class office buildings in  that vicinity.    The Rover Company occupied the entire fourth floor of this building.  There was a large general office and a counting room and three private  offices, one for each of the brothers. The office help numbered about  twenty, and the place during business hours was usually a busy one.    They found Tom Rover in his private office at a large desk piled high  with sheets and documents. He was hard at work signing his name to a  number of sheets, but smiled pleasantly when he saw who his visitors  were. The boys, of course, were well known to most of the employees,  and so had passed in without being questioned.    \"Come to help me out, I suppose,\" said the father of the twins, with a  grin. \"All right. Take off your coats, roll up your sleeves and pitch  in. There is plenty to do.\"    \"If that is the case, Uncle Tom, I guess you don't want us to disturb  you,\" said Jack quickly.    \"I'll be through here in less than half an hour,\" announced Tom Rover.  \"Just make yourselves at home for that length of time, and then I'll  be with you.\"    This was a gentle hint that he must get through with his work, and the  boys lost no time in backing out of his office. They went into the  offices usually occupied by Dick Rover and Sam Rover, looking over a  number of books, magazines and pamphlets.    \"Let's go down in the street for a while and take a look around,\"  suggested Andy, who always liked to be on the go.    As there was nothing particular for them to do in the offices, the  others agreed to this, and so, telling the twins' father that they  would come back at the end of the half hour, they walked out into the  corridor opening upon the elevators and the stairway.    As they waited at one of the elevators for a chance to go down, the  elevator came up and stopped to let out a messenger boy. Then it  continued on its way upward.    \"Say, did you notice who was in that elevator?\" cried Randy quickly.    \"I thought I saw Mr. Martell,\" answered Fred.    \"Yes, it was Martell, and Nappy was with him.\"    \"Well, there is nothing strange about that,\" came from Andy. \"Probably  he wants to see his father now he is in New York again.\"    \"I'd like to know what Nappy has told his father about us,\" went on  Fred. \"You can wager it's nothing good.\"    \"I don't care what he says, so long as he leaves us alone,\" said Jack.    Another elevator appeared, and the four boys descended to the ground  floor of the office building. Here half a dozen people were waiting to  go up, while several others were at the rear of the corridor, talking  earnestly.    \"Hello! there are Slugger Brown and his father,\" exclaimed Fred,  pointing down the corridor. \"Now, what do you know about that!\"    \"They must be in this building to visit the Martells,\" returned Jack.    \"They are talking to two men,\" put in Randy. \"I wonder who they can  be?\"    \"Oh, some friends or business acquaintances, I suppose,\" answered the  oldest of the Rover boys.    Ordinarily none of the Rover boys considered eavesdropping honorable,  but they thought it a different thing when dealing with their enemies,  and Andy, being naturally inquisitive anyway, sauntered down the  corridor and passed the group that was talking so earnestly. The  backs of both Mr. Brown and Slugger were toward him, so neither  noticed the lad.    \"And if you will do that, Mr. Brown, you will make very good money by  it,\" Andy heard one of the strange men say. He spoke with a strong  German accent.    \"You will make far more money that way than you ever did in your  business,\" added the other stranger.    \"Yes, but I'll be running a big risk,\" Mr. Brown replied. \"Those  things are getting more dangerous every day.\"    \"Say, Pop, why don't you go up and see Mr. Martell about this?\" put in  the son.    \"Yes, I think we ought to go up and see Nelson Martell,\" answered Mr.  Brown.    \"I have already seen him,\" said one of the strangers.    \"Well, it won't do any harm to talk it over again,\" returned Slogwell  Brown. \"Come on; his offices are up on the fifth floor.\"    The party of four turned, and as they did so Andy raised his hand and  made a quick motion to the other boys to get out of sight. Then, as  Slugger Brown and the men passed him, he turned quickly and, bending  down, pretended to fix the lace of his shoe. Thus he was passed  without being recognized. A few seconds later the four were in the  elevator, going up.    \"Why did you motion for us to get out of the way?\" demanded Jack, as  soon as Andy rejoined the others.    \"Because I didn't want Slugger and his father and those other men to  see you,\" was the quick reply. \"Do you know what I think?\"    \"What?\" came in a chorus from the others.    \"I think that whole crowd is up to no good. Both of those men look  like Germans, and each of them talked with a strong German accent,  even though they are both evidently very well educated.\"    \"What did they say?\" demanded Jack; and when told, he looked grave.    \"There may be something in this,\" he said slowly. \"Suppose we go up to  the fifth floor and try to find out a little more.\"    \"We might get caught,\" said Fred.    \"I don't see how,\" went on the oldest Rover boy. \"Martell doesn't  occupy the whole floor. He has the front offices only. There are  several other firms in the rear. We might be calling on them, you  know,\" and he winked.    The boys talked the matter over for a minute or so, and then, as an  elevator came down, they entered and got out at the fifth floor. The  little corridor here was empty, for which they were thankful.    \"Of course there may not be a thing in this,\" announced Jack. \"It may  be some ordinary business deal which is perfectly legitimate.\"    \"Not by"]]]
