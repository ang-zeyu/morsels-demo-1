Trees did not grow, flowers did not blossom, and water was  not clear and bright. The earth did not know that there was any other  way of living, and so she did not complain.    By and by the sky and the earth had a son who was called the Shining  One. When he was small, he had a dream, and he told it to the earth.  \"Mother Earth,\" he said, \"I had a dream, and it was that the sky was far  up above us. There was a bright light, and it made you more radiant than  I ever saw you. What could the light have been?\"    \"I do not know, my Shining One,\" she answered, \"for there is nothing but  the earth and the sky.\"    After a long, long time, the Shining One was fully grown. Then he said  to the sky, \"Father Sky, will you not go higher up, that there may be  light and warmth on the earth?\"    \"There is no 'higher up,'\" declared the sky. \"There is only just here.\"    Then the Shining One raised the sky till he rested on the mountain  peaks.    \"Oh! oh!\" cried the sky. \"They hurt. The peaks are sharp and rough. You  are an unkind, cruel son.\"    \"In my dreams you were still higher up,\" replied the Shining One, and he  raised the sky still higher.    \"Oh! oh!\" complained the sky, \"I can hardly see the peaks. I will stay  on the rough rocks.\"    \"You were far above the rocks in my dream,\" replied the Shining One.    Then when the sky was raised far above the earth and no longer touched  even the peaks, a great change came over the earth. She, too, had  thought the Shining One unkind, and she had said, \"Shining One, it was  only a dream. Why should you change the sky and the earth? Why not let  them stay as they were before you had the dream?\"    \"O Mother Earth,\" he said, \"I wish you could see the radiant change that  has come to pass. The air is full of light and warmth and fragrance. You  yourself are more beautiful than you were even in my dream. Listen and  hear the song of the birds. See the flowers blossoming in every field,  and even covering the rough peaks of the mountains. Should you be glad  if I had let all things stay as they were? Was I unkind to make you so  much more lovely than you were?\"    Before the earth could answer, the sky began to complain. \"You have  spread over earth a new cloak of green, and of course she is beautiful  with all her flowers and birds, but here am I, raised far above the  mountain peaks. I have no cloak, nor have I flowers and birds. Shining  One, give me a cloak.\"    \"That will I do, and most gladly,\" replied the Shining One, and he  spread a soft cloak of dark blue over the sky, and in it many a star  sparkled and twinkled.    \"That is very well in the night,\" said the heavens, \"but it is not good  in the daytime, it is too gloomy. Give me another cloak for the day.\"  Then the Shining One spread a light blue cloak over the sky for the  daytime, and at last the sky was as beautiful as the earth.    Now both sky and earth were contented. \"I did not know that the earth  was so radiant,\" said the sky. \"I did not know that the sky was so  beautiful,\" said the earth. \"I will send a message to tell her how  lovely she is,\" thought the sky, and he dropped down a gentle little  rain.    \"I, too, will send a message,\" thought the earth, \"and the clouds shall  carry it for me.\" That is why there is often a light cloud rising from  the earth in the morning. It is carrying a good-morning message from the  beautiful earth to the sky.          HOW SUMMER CAME TO THE EARTH.      PART I.    There was once a boy on the earth who was old enough to have a bow and  arrows, but who had never seen a summer. He had no idea how it would  look to have leaves on the trees, for he had never seen any such things.  As for the songs of birds, he may have heard them in his dreams, but he  never heard them when he was not asleep. If any one had asked, \"Do you  not like to walk on the soft grass?\" he would have answered, \"What is  grass? I never saw any.\"    The reason why this boy had never heard of summer was because there had  never been a summer on the earth. Far to the north the earth was covered  with thick ice, and even farther south, where the boy lived, the ground  was rarely free from ice and snow.    The boy's father was called the fisher. He taught his little son to  hunt, and made him a bow like his own, only smaller. The boy was proud  of his arrows, and was always happy when he went out to hunt. He had  often shot a lynx, and once or twice he had shot a wolverine. Sometimes  it chanced that he found nothing to shoot, and then he was not happy,  for he realized how cold it was. His fingers ached, and his feet ached,  and the end of his nose ached. \"Oh, if I could only carry the wigwam  fire about with me!\" he cried, for he had no idea of any other warmth  than that which came from the fire.    Now it chanced that Adjidaumo, the squirrel, was on a tree over the  boy's head, and he heard this cry. He dropped a piece of ice upon the  end of the boy's little red nose, and the boy bent his bow. Then he  realized who it was, and he cried, \"O Adjidaumo, you are warm. You have  no fingers to ache with the cold. I am warm just twice a day, once in  the morning and once at night.\"    \"Boys do not know much,\" replied Adjidaumo, dancing lightly on the  topmost bough. \"The end of _my_ nose is warm, and I have no fingers like  yours to be cold, but if I had chanced to have any, I have an idea that  would have kept them warm.\"    \"What is an idea?\" asked the boy.    \"An idea is something that is better than a fire,\" replied the squirrel,  \"for you can carry an idea about with you, and you have to leave the  fire at home. A lynx has an idea sometimes, and a wolverine has one  sometimes, but a squirrel has one twice as often as a boy.\"    The poor boy was too cold to be angry, and he begged, \"Adjidaumo, if  there is any way for me to keep warm, will you not tell me what it is? A  lynx would be more kind to me than you are, and I am sure a wolverine  would tell me.\"    Adjidaumo had rarely been cold, but when he realized how cold the boy  was, he was sorry for him, and he said, \"All you have to do is to go  home and cry. When your father says, 'Why do you cry?' answer nothing  but 'Boo-hoo, boo-hoo, boo-hoo! Get me summer, get me summer!'\"    Now this boy rarely cried, but his hands and feet were so very cold that  he thought he would do as the squirrel had told him, and he started for  home. As soon as he reached the wigwam, he threw himself down upon the  ground and cried. He cried so hard that his tears made a river that ran  out of the wigwam door. It was a frozen river, of course, but when the  fisher saw it, he knew it was made of the tears of his little son. \"What  are you crying for?\" he asked, but all the boy answered was \"Boo-hoo,  boo-hoo! Get me summer, father, get me summer!\"    \"Summer,\" repeated the fisher thoughtfully. \"It is not easy to get  summer, but I will find it if I can.\"      PART II.    The fisher made a great feast for the animals that he thought could help  him to find summer. The otter, the lynx, the badger, and the wolverine  came. After they had eaten, the hunter told them what he wished to do,  and they all set out to find summer.    For many days they traveled, and at last they came to a high mountain  upon whose summit the sky seemed to rest.    \"That is where summer is,\" declared the badger. \"All we have to do is to  climb to the summit and take it from the heavens.\" So they all climbed  and climbed, till it seemed as if they would never reach the top. After  a long time they were on the very highest summit, but the heavens were  above them.    \"We cannot reach it,\" said the fisher.    \"Let us try,\" said the lynx.    \"I will try first,\" said the otter. So the otter sprang up with all his  might, but he could not touch the heavens. He rolled down the side of  the mountain, and then he ran home. The badger tried, and the beaver  tried, and the lynx tried, but not one of them could leap far enough to  reach the heavens. \"Now I will try,\" said the wolverine. \"I am not  going to climb away up here for nothing.\" The fisher watched most  eagerly, for he thought, \"There's my boy at home crying, and what shall  I do if I cannot get the summer for him?\"    The wolverine leaped farther than any wolverine ever leaped before, and  he went where no animal on the earth had ever been before, for he went  straight through the floor of the heavens. Of course the fisher  followed, and there they were in a more lovely place than any one on the  earth had ever dreamed of, for they were in the land of summer, and  summer had never come to the earth.    The soft, warm air went down through the hole in the floor and spread  over the earth. Birds flew down, singing happily as they flew, and all  kinds of flowers that are on the earth to-day made their way through the  hole as fast as they could, for they knew all about the little boy in  the wigwam who was wishing that summer would come.    Now there were people in the heavens, and when they found that summer  was going down to the earth through the hole in the floor, they cried  out to the Great Spirit, \"Take summer away from him, take it away from  him!\" and they shot their arrows at the fisher and the wolverine. The  wolverine dropped through the hole, but the fisher was not quick enough,  and he could not get away.    The Great Spirit said, \"The heavens have the summer all the year, but  the earth shall have summer half the year. I shall close the hole in the  floor so the fisher cannot go down to earth again, but I will make him  into a fish and give him a place in the heavens.\"    When the Indians look up at the sky, they see a fish in the stars, and  they say, \"That is the good fisher who gave us the beautiful summer.\"          THE STORY OF THE FIRST SNOWDROPS.      An old man sat alone in his house. It Was full of shadows; it was dark"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22430"],[0,"Evolution in Modern Thought (#15)"],[1,"green  leaf-insects which remain green only while they are young and  difficult to see on the leaf, but which become brown again in the last  stage of larval life, when they have outgrown the leaf. They then  conceal themselves by day, sometimes only among withered leaves on the  ground, sometimes in the earth itself. It is interesting that in one  genus, Chaerocampa, one species is brown in the last stage of larval  life, another becomes brown earlier, and in many species the last  stage is not wholly brown, a part remaining green. Whether this is a  case of a double adaptation, or whether the green is being gradually  crowded out by the brown, the fact remains that the same species, even  the same individual, can exhibit both variations. The case is the same  with many of the leaf-like Orthoptera, as, for instance, the praying  mantis (_Mantis religiosa_) which we have already mentioned.    But the best proofs are furnished by those of ten-cited cases in which  the insect bears a deceptive resemblance to another object. We now  know many such cases, such as the numerous imitations of green or  withered leaves, which are brought about in the most diverse ways,  sometimes by mere variations in the form of the insect and in its  colour, sometimes by an elaborate marking, like that which occurs in  the Indian leaf-butterflies, _Kallima inachis_. In the single  butterfly-genus Anaea, in the woods of South America, there are about  a hundred species which are all gaily coloured on the upper surface,  and on the reverse side exhibit the most delicate imitation of the  colouring and pattern of a leaf, generally without any indication of  the leaf-ribs, but extremely deceptive nevertheless. Anyone who has  seen only one such butterfly may doubt whether many of the  insignificant details of the marking can really be of advantage to the  insect. Such details are for instance the apparent holes and splits  in the apparently dry or half-rotten leaf, which are usually due to  the fact that the scales are absent on a circular or oval patch so  that the colourless wing-membrane lies bare, and one can look through  the spot as through a window. Whether the bird which is seeking or  pursuing the butterflies takes these holes for dewdrops, or for the  work of a devouring insect, does not affect the question; the  mirror-like spot undoubtedly increases the general deceptiveness, for  the same thing occurs in many leaf-butterflies, though not in all, and  in some cases it is replaced in quite a peculiar manner. In one  species of Anaea (_A. divina_), the resting butterfly looks exactly  like a leaf out of the outer edge of which a large semi-circular piece  has been eaten, possibly by a caterpillar; but if we look more closely  it is obvious that there is no part of the wing absent, and that the  semi-circular piece is of a clear, pale yellow colour, while the rest  of the wing is of a strongly contrasted dark brown.    But the deceptive resemblance may be caused in quite a different  manner. I have often speculated as to what advantage the brilliant  white C could give to the otherwise dusky-coloured \"Comma butterfly\"  (_Grapta C. album_). Poulton's recent observations[46] have shown that  this represents the imitation of a crack such as is often seen in dry  leaves, and is very conspicuous because the light shines through it.    The utility obviously lies in presenting to the bird the very familiar  picture of a broken leaf with a clear shining slit, and we may  conclude, from the imitation of such small details, that the birds are  very sharp observers and that the smallest deviation from the usual  arrests their attention and incites them to closer investigation. It  is obvious that such detailed--we might almost say such  subtle--deceptive resemblances could only have come about in the  course of long ages through the acquirement from time to time of  something new which heightened the already existing resemblance.    In face of facts like these there can be no question of chance and no  one has succeeded so far in finding any other explanation to replace  that by selection. For the rest, the apparent leaves are by no means  perfect copies of a leaf; many of them only represent the torn or  broken piece, or the half or two-thirds of a leaf, but then the leaves  themselves frequently do not present themselves to the eye as a whole,  but partially concealed among other leaves. Even those butterflies  which, like the species of Kallima and Anaea, represent the whole of a  leaf with stalk, ribs, apex, and the whole breadth, are not actual  copies which would satisfy a botanist; there is often much wanting. In  Kallima the lateral ribs of the leaf are never all included in the  markings; there are only two or three on the left side and at more  four or five on the right, and in many individuals these are rather  obscure, while in others they are comparatively distinct. This  furnishes us with fresh evidence in favour of their origin through  processes of selection, for a botanically perfect picture could not  arise in this way; there could only be a fixing of such details as  heightened the deceptive resemblance.    Our postulate of origin through selection also enables us to  understand why the leaf-imitation is on the lower surface of the wing  in the diurnal Lepidoptera, and on the upper surface in the nocturnal  forms, corresponding to the attitude of the wings in the resting  position of the two groups.    The strongest of all proofs of the theory, however, is afforded by  cases of true \"mimicry,\" those adaptations discovered by Bates in  1861, consisting in the imitation of one species by another, which  becomes more and more like its model. The model is always a species  that enjoys some special protection from enemies, whether because it  is unpleasant to taste, or because it is in some way dangerous.    It is chiefly among insects and especially among butterflies that we  find the greatest number of such cases. Several of these have been  minutely studied and every detail has been investigated so that it is  difficult to understand how there can still be disbelief in regard to  them. If the many and exact observations which have been carefully  collected and critically discussed for instance by Poulton[47] were  thoroughly studied the arguments which are still frequently urged  against mimicry would be found untenable; we can hardly hope to find  more convincing proof of the actuality of the processes of selection  than these cases put into our hands. The preliminary postulates of the  theory of mimicry have been disputed, for instance, that diurnal  butterflies are persecuted and eaten by birds, but observations  specially directed towards this point in India, Africa, America and  Europe have placed it beyond all doubt. If it were necessary I could  myself furnish an account of my own observations on this point.    In the same way it has been established by experiment and observation  in the field that in all the great regions of distribution there are  butterflies which are rejected by birds and lizards, their chief  enemies, on account of their unpleasant smell or taste. These  butterflies are usually gaily and conspicuously coloured and thus--as  Wallace first interpreted it--are furnished with an easily  recognisable sign: a sign of unpalatableness or _warning colours_. If  they were not thus recognisable easily and from a distance, they would  frequently be pecked at by birds, and then rejected because of their  unpleasant taste; but as it is, the insect-eaters recognise them at  once as unpalatable booty and ignore them. Such _immune_[48] species,  wherever they occur, are imitated by other palatable species, which  thus acquire a certain degree of protection.    It is true that this explanation of the bright, conspicuous colours  is only a hypothesis, but its foundations--unpalatableness, and the  liability of other butterflies to be eaten,--are certain, and its  consequences--the existence of mimetic palatable forms--conform it in  the most convincing manner. Of the many cases now known I select one,  which is especially remarkable, and which has been thoroughly  investigated, _Papilla dardanus_ (_merope_), a large, beautiful,  diurnal butterfly which ranges from Abyssinia throughout the whole of  Africa to the south coast of Cape Colony.    The males of this form are everywhere _almost_ the same in colour and  in form of wings, save for a few variations in the sparse black  markings on the pale yellow ground. But the females occur in several  quite different forms and colourings, and one of these only, the  Abyssinian form, is like the male, while the other three or four are  _mimetic_, that is to say, they copy a butterfly of quite a different  family the Danaids, which are among the _immune_ forms. In each region  the females have thus copied two or three different immune species.  There is much that is interesting to be said in regard to these  species, but it would be out of keeping with the general tenor of this  paper to give details of this very complicated case of polymorphism in  _P. Dardanus_. Anyone who is interested in the matter will find a full  and exact statement of the case in as far as we know it, in Poulton's  _Essays on Evolution_ (pp. 373-375[49]). I need only add that three  different mimetic female forms have been reared from the eggs of a  single female in South Africa. The resemblance of the forms to their  immune models goes so far that even the details of the _local_ forms  of the models are copied by the mimetic species.    It remains to be said that in Madagascar a butterfly,    _Papilio meriones_, occurs, of which both sexes are very similar in  form and markings to the non-mimetic male of _P. dardanus_, so that it  probably represents the ancestor of this latter species.    In face of such facts as these every attempt at another explanation  must fail. Similarly all the"]]]
