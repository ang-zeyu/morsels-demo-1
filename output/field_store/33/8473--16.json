[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28402"],[0,"The Sexual Life of the Child (#15)"],[1," the early age of twelve years, although  this is quite exceptional, and, as already mentioned, in such cases the  ejaculated fluid contains no spermatozoa.    In the case of women, what has been said of the glands of Cowper applies  equally to the glands of Bartholin, the homologues of the former both as  regards significance and development. The glands of Bartholin also begin  to secrete in sexually immature girls, and even in children. It must be  added that when ejaculation occurs in sexually immature girls, the  products of other glands are probably intermingled with the secretion of  the glands of Bartholin (mucous glands of the uterus, of the cervix  uteri, the vagina, the vulva, and perhaps also of the urethra).    I have distinguished the simple outflow of secretion from its forcible  expulsion--from true ejaculation. This latter demands the rhythmical  activity of certain muscles, such as takes place during coitus. The  question arises, whether such muscular activity can occur before any  fluid has been formed capable of being ejaculated. When I compare what  is published in the literature of the subject with what I have myself  observed in this connexion, I regard the following points as definitely  established. There are certain cases, and these in young persons of both  sexes, in which typical rhythmical muscular contractions take place in  the child, although no ejaculated fluid is discoverable. It remains  doubtful, however, whether a small quantity of secretion, overlooked by  the observer, and perhaps not even recognisable, may not, after all, be  ejaculated. I consider it probable that this is so. Moreover, we must  not forget that the rhythmical muscular contractions, which in the adult  effect ejaculation, are able to expel the fluid from the urethra only  when this fluid is present in sufficient quantity. When the quantity is  minimal the fluid is retained for a time in that passage, owing to the  frictional resistance of the urethra, and is perhaps not expelled until  the next act of micturition. Some may, of course, object to denote such  a process by the word ejaculation; but I myself see no reason why the  term should not be extended to include the rhythmical muscular  contraction both in the child and the adult, even in cases in which  there is not sufficient fluid secretion in the urethra for this to be  visibly extruded by these contractions.    What have we to say regarding the voluptuous sensation in children? It  is extremely difficult to form clear ideas about this matter, for the  sources of fallacy previously described (p. 5 _et seq._) are here  markedly in operation; above all, in the case of little children, the  voluptuous sensation, purely subjective in character, is extraordinarily  difficult to recognise objectively. This much, however, may be said. It  appears to me to be beyond question that in childhood, and even in very  early childhood, a sensation may sometimes be excited of the same kind  as the voluptuous sensation of adult life. None the less, we must be  careful not to assume too readily, in any particular case, that such a  sensation has actually been experienced. Certain oscillatory movements  on the part of infants and other small children have frequently been  regarded as an indication of the practice of masturbation, and of the  occurrence of voluptuous sensations; but in my opinion that view is to a  large extent erroneous. Such movements may be no more than the  expression of a general sense of well-being, without having anything  whatever to do with the sexual life or with the specific voluptuous  sensation. Doubtless the voluptuous sensation may be experienced by very  small children, and even by infants. When we see a child lying with  moist, widely-opened eyes, and exhibiting all the other signs of sexual  excitement, such as we are accustomed to observe in adults, we are  justified in assuming that the child is experiencing a voluptuous  sensation. But what is usually wanting in such cases, at any rate in  young children, is the voluptuous acme which in adults occurs in  association with the act of ejaculation. Cases have also been  occasionally reported to me in which, even in infancy, a voluptuous acme  has occurred; and still more frequently I have been told this in respect  of somewhat older children, for example, at ages of seven or eight  years. I believe, however, that this voluptuous acme is, at any rate in  children, much less common than the equable voluptuous sensation which  can be aroused by all kinds of manipulations and stimulations of the  peripheral genital organs, and more especially of the glans, the penis,  the clitoris, and the labia minora. The older the child, the more  frequently is the voluptuous acme attained; in our own climate, during  the last years of the second period of childhood, this occurs  comparatively often; the voluptuous acme does not last so long as in  sexually mature individuals, but is in other respects described in  identical terms. It is experienced simultaneously with the occurrence of  the rhythmical muscular contractions which have previously been  described. It is possible, as I suggested before, that in such cases the  ejaculation of a certain quantity of glandular secretion always occurs,  although, as I have also explained, this secretion may sometimes be too  small in quantity to be actually expelled from the urethra by the  muscular extractions. This point is, however, still obscure. But it may  be regarded as definitely established that the equable voluptuous  sensation, and more particularly the voluptuous acme, may occur at an  age at which, at any rate, secretion does not yet exist in sufficient  quantity to be expelled from the urethra, and the existence of such  secretion is therefore not unequivocally manifested. In exceptional, and  doubtless pathological instances, and above all in cases in which, owing  to the practice of masturbation, there has been excessive stimulation,  instead of the voluptuous acme, a painful sensation may be experienced.  In general, however, in children, just as in adults, the voluptuous acme  is associated with a sense of satisfaction, and with the subsidence of  the previously existing sexual excitement. _This much is beyond  question, that the voluptuous acme and the sense of satisfaction  associated therewith make their appearance subsequent to the development  of erection and the equable voluptuous sensation in the genital organs._  Mutatis mutandis, _this is equally true of both sexes_.    In other respects, however, the voluptuous sensation and the voluptuous  acme exhibit in the child an important difference from the same  phenomena in the adult, to which we shall have to return later. To sum  up, we may regard it as certain that erections often appear many years  before the end of the second period of childhood; not infrequently,  indeed, in the beginning of the second period of childhood, and even  earlier. These erections may very early in life be associated with an  equable voluptuous sensation, allied to the sensations of itching or  tickling.[33] The voluptuous acme and ejaculation do not make their  appearance until later. These statements apply, in the first place, to  boys. The conditions in girls appear, however, to be analogous. But here  we must be most cautious in drawing conclusions, for the reason that the  sexual life of the girl is still much more obscure to us than that of  the boy; this difference in our knowledge of the sexes is no less marked  in the case of children than it is in respect of the adult man and  woman.    Hitherto we have occupied ourselves with the description of the  peripheral sexual organs, and of the processes of detumescence. We must  now pass on to the second group of sexual phenomena, the processes of  contrectation. Even in childhood, these processes play an important  part; indeed, they generally manifest themselves at an earlier age than  the processes of detumescence. But first, let me briefly summarise Max  Dessoir's account of the stages of the sexual impulse--stages in which  the contrectation impulse is alone concerned. In its development, three  stages may be distinguished. One of these is the neutral stage, in  earliest childhood, in which, speaking generally, the processes of  contrectation are not yet to be observed, and during which the child  does not feel attracted towards anyone in such a manner as to make it  necessary for us to assume the occurrence of any psychosexual process.  This stage is succeeded by the extremely important undifferentiated  stage, to which Max Dessoir[34] has drawn attention. Its principal  characteristic is indicated in its name: the direction of the impulse is  not yet completely differentiated. It oscillates to and fro, and depends  upon the external objects which happen to be in the vicinity. This  undifferentiated stage is of profound importance; and owing to the fact  that its existence has been ignored in the study of sexual perversions,  great confusion has arisen. During the undifferentiated period, it may  happen that quite normal children exhibit homosexual excitement, whose  importance is apt to be greatly over-estimated by their relatives and  others. During the undifferentiated stage a boy may love one of his  teachers or one of his friends, and yet in later life be perfectly  normal; many a woman, again, who loves her husband ardently has earlier,  during the undifferentiated period, passionately loved a school-fellow  or a governess. On the other hand, during the undifferentiated stage a  boy may exhibit an inclination towards someone of the opposite sex, the  governess or the girl-friend of his sister, for instance; conversely,  the girl may be attracted by a boy or a young man. This inclination,  whether homosexual or heterosexual, often leads to bodily acts, to  contact with the beloved person, embraces, and kisses, without the  necessary occurrence "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28434"],[0,"The Astronomy of Milton's 'Paradise Lost' (#15)"],[1," object for  poetic description than the simple and uncircumscribed arrangement of  the universe expressed by the Copernican theory. It also afforded him an  opportunity of localising those regions of space in which the chief  incidents in his poem are described--viz. HEAVEN, or THE EMPYREAN,  CHAOS, HELL, and the MUNDANE UNIVERSE. Milton's Ptolemaism, with its  adjuncts, may be understood by the following:    All that portion of space above the newly created universe, and beyond  the Primum Mobile, was known as HEAVEN, or THE EMPYREAN--a region of  light, of glory, and of happiness; the dwelling-place of the Deity, Who,  though omnipresent, here visibly revealed Himself to all the multitude  of angels whom He created, and who surrounded his throne in adoration  and worship.    Underneath the universe there existed a vast region of similar  dimensions to the Empyrean, called CHAOS, which was occupied by the  embryo elements of matter, that with incessant turmoil and confusion  warred with each other for supremacy--a wild abyss--        The womb of Nature and perhaps her grave.--ii. 911.    The lower portion of this region was divided off from the remainder, and  embraced the locality known as HELL--the place of torment, where the  rebellious angels were driven and shut in after their expulsion from  Heaven.        As far removed from God and light of Heaven      As from the centre thrice to the utmost pole.--i. 73-74.    The NEW UNIVERSE, which included the Earth and all the orbs of the  firmament known as the Starry Heavens, was created out of Chaos, and  hung, as if suspended by a golden chain, from the Empyrean above; and  although its magnitude and dimensions were inconceivable, yet, according  to the Ptolemaic theory, it was enclosed by the tenth sphere or Primum  Mobile.    By this partitioning of space Milton was able to contrive a system which  fulfilled the requirements of his great poem.    The annexed diagram explains the relative positions of the different  regions into which space was divided.    Though there are traces of Copernicanism found in 'Paradise Lost,' yet  Milton has very faithfully adhered to the Ptolemaic mechanism and  nomenclature throughout his poem.    In his description of the Creation, the Earth is formed first, then the  Sun, followed by the Moon, and afterwards the stars, all of which are  described as being in motion round the Earth. Allusion is also made to  this ancient system in several prominent passages, and in the following  lines there is a distinct reference to the various revolving spheres.    [Illustration: FIG. 2]        They pass the planets seven, and pass the fixed,      And that crystalline sphere whose balance weighs      The trepidation talked, and that first moved.--iii. 481-83.    The seven planetary spheres are first mentioned; then the eighth sphere,  or that of the fixed stars; then the ninth, or crystalline, which was  believed to cause a shaking, or trepidation, to account for certain  irregularities in the motions of the stars; and, lastly, the tenth  sphere, or Primum Mobile, called the 'first moved' because it set the  other spheres in motion.    To an uninstructed observer, the apparent motion of the heavenly bodies  round the Earth would naturally lead him to conclude that, of the two  theories, the Ptolemaic was the correct one. We therefore find that  Milton adopted the system most in accord with the knowledge and  intelligence possessed by the persons portrayed by him in his poem; and  in describing the natural phenomena witnessed in the heavens by our  first parents, he adheres to the doctrines of the Ptolemaic system, as  being most in harmony with the simple and primitive conceptions of those  created beings.    To their upward gaze, the orbs of heaven appeared to be in ceaseless  motion; the solid Earth, upon which they stood, was alone immovable and  at rest. Day after day they observed the Sun pursue his steadfast course  with unerring regularity: his rising in the east, accompanied by the  rosy hues of morn; his meridian splendour, and his sinking in the west,  tinting in colours of purple and gold inimitable the fleecy clouds  floating in the azure sky, as he bids farewell for a time to scenes of  life and happiness, rejoicing in the light and warmth of his  all-cheering beams. With the advent of night they beheld the Moon, now  increasing, now waning, pursue her irregular path, also to disappear in  the west; whilst, like the bands of an army marshalled in loose array,  the constellations of glittering stars, with stately motion, traversed  their nocturnal arcs, circling the pole of the heavens.    By referring to Book viii., 15-175, we find an account of an interesting  scientific discussion, or conversation, between Adam and Raphael  regarding the merits of the Ptolemaic and Copernican systems, and of the  relative importance and size of the heavenly bodies. By it we are  afforded an opportunity of learning how accurate and precise a knowledge  Milton possessed of both theories, and in what clear and perspicuous  language he expresses his arguments in favour of or against the  doctrines associated with each.    We may, with good reason, regard the views expressed by Adam as  representing Milton's own opinions, which were in conformity with the  Copernican theory; and in the Angel's reply, though of an undecided  character, we are able to perceive how aptly Milton describes the  erroneous conclusions upon which the Ptolemaic theory was based.    In this scientific discussion, it would seem rather strange that Adam,  the first of men, should have been capable of such philosophic  reasoning, propounding, as if by intuition, a theory upon which was  founded a system that had not been discovered until many centuries after  the time that astronomy became a science. By attributing to Adam such a  degree of intelligence and wisdom, the poet has taken a liberty which  enabled him to carry on this discussion in a manner befitting the  importance of the subject.    In the following lines Adam expresses to his Angel-guest, in forcible  and convincing language, his reasons in support of the Copernican  theory:--        When I behold this goodly frame, this World,      Of Heaven and Earth consisting, and compute      Their magnitudes--this Earth, a spot, a grain,      An atom, with the Firmament compared      And all her numbered stars, that seem to roll      Spaces incomprehensible (for such      Their distance argues, and their swift return      Diurnal) merely to officiate light      Round this opacous Earth, this punctual spot,      One day and night, in all her vast survey      Useless besides--reasoning, I oft admire,      How Nature, wise and frugal could commit      Such disproportions, with superfluous hand      So many nobler bodies to create,      Greater so manifold, to this one use,      For aught appears, and on their Orbs impose      Such restless revolution day by day      Repeated, while the sedentary Earth,      That better might with far less compass move,      Served by more noble than herself, attains      Her end without least motion, and receives,      As tribute, such a sumless journey brought      Of incorporeal speed, her warmth and light;      Speed, to describe whose swiftness number fails.--viii. 15-38.    We are enabled to perceive that Milton had formed a correct conception  of the magnitude and proportions of the universe, and also of the  relative size and importance of the Earth, which he describes as 'a  spot, a grain, an atom,' when compared with the surrounding heavens. He  expresses his surprise that all the stars of the firmament, whose  distances are so remote, and whose dimensions so greatly exceed those of  this globe, should in their diurnal revolution have 'such a sumless  journey of incorporeal speed imposed upon them' merely to officiate  light to the Earth, 'this punctual spot;' and reasoning, wonders how  Nature, wise and frugal in her ways, should commit such disproportions,  by adopting means so great to accomplish a result so small, when motion  imparted to the sedentary Earth would with greater ease produce the same  effect.    The inconceivable velocity with which it would be necessary for those  orbs to travel in order to accomplish a daily revolution round the Earth  might be described as almost spiritual, and beyond the power of  calculation by numbers.    The Angel, after listening to Adam's argument, expresses approval of his  desire to obtain knowledge, but answers him dubiously, and at the same  time criticises in a severe and adverse manner the Ptolemaic theory.        To ask or search I blame thee not; for Heaven      Is as the Book of God before thee set,      Wherein to read his wondrous works, and learn      His seasons, hours, or days, or months, or years.      This to attain, whether Heaven move or Earth,      Imports not, if thou reckon right; the rest      From Man or Angel the Great Architect      Did wisely to conceal, and not divulge      His secrets, to be scanned by them who ought      Rather admire. Or, if they list to try      Conjecture, he his fabric of the Heavens      Hath left to their disputes, perhaps to move      His laughter at their quaint opinions wide      Hereafter, when they come to model Heaven,      And calculate the stars; how they will wield      The mighty frame; how build, unbuild, contrive      To save appearances; how gird the Sphere      With Centric and Eccentric scribbled o'er      Cycle and Epicycle, Orb in Orb.--viii. 66-84.    When, with the advancement of science, astronomical observations were  made with greater accuracy, it was discovered that uniformity of motion  was not always maintained by those bodies which were believed to move in  circles round the Earth. It was observed that the Sun, when on one side  of his orbit, had an accelerated motion, as compared with the speed at  which he travelled when on the other side. The planets, also, "]]]
