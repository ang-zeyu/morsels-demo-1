[Footnote 139: The company was formed by an amalgamation of Oxford's  and Worcester's Men in 1602. See The Malone Society's _Collections_,  I, 85.]    [Footnote 140: The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 266.]    [Footnote 141: Greg, _Henslowe Papers_, p. 61; Dasent, _Acts of the  Privy Council_, XXXII, 511.]    But the Queen's Men were probably dissatisfied with the Curtain. It  was small and antiquated, and it must have suffered by comparison with  the more splendid Globe and Fortune. So the Queen's players had built  for themselves a new and larger playhouse, called \"The Red Bull.\" This  was probably ready for occupancy in 1605, yet it is impossible to say  exactly when the Queen's Men left the Curtain; their patent of April  15, 1609, gives them permission to act \"within their now usual houses  called the Red Bull, in Clerkenwell, and the Curtain in  Holywell.\"[142] It may be that they retained control of the Curtain in  order to prevent competition.    [Footnote 142: The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 270.]    What company occupied the Curtain after Queen Anne's Men finally  surrendered it is not clear. Mr. Murray is of the opinion that Prince  Charles's Men moved into the Curtain \"about December, 1609, or early  in 1610.\"[143]    [Footnote 143: _English Dramatic Companies_, I, 230.]    In 1613 \"a company of young men\" acted _The Hector of Germany_ \"at  the Red Bull and at the Curtain.\" Such plays, however, written and  acted by amateurs, were not uncommon, and no significance can be  attached to the event.    In 1622, as we learn from the Herbert Manuscripts, the Curtain was  being occupied by Prince Charles's Servants.[144] In the same year the  author of _Vox Graculi, or The Jack Daw's Prognostication for 1623_,  refers to it thus: \"If company come current to the Bull and Curtain,  there will be more money gathered in one afternoon than will be given  to Kingsland Spittle in a whole month; also, if at this time about the  hours of four and five it wax cloudy and then rain downright, they  shall sit dryer in the galleries than those who are the understanding  men in the yard.\"    [Footnote 144: Malone, _Variorum_, III, 59; cf. Chalmers's  _Supplemental Apology_, p. 213, note _y_. Murray gives the date  incorrectly as 1623.]    Prince Charles's Men did not remain long at the Curtain. At some date  between June 10 and August 19, 1623, they moved to the larger and more  handsome Red Bull.[145] After this, so far as I can discover, there is  no evidence to connect the playhouse with dramatic performances.  Malone, who presumably bases his statements on the now lost records of  Herbert, says that shortly after the accession of King Charles I it  \"seems to have been used only by prize-fighters.\"[146]    [Footnote 145: Murray, _English Dramatic Companies_, I, 237, note 1.]    [Footnote 146: Malone, _Variorum_, III, 54, note 2.]    The last mention of the Curtain is found in the _Middlesex County  Records_ under the date February 21, 1627.[147] It is merely a passing  reference to \"the common shoare near the Curtain playhouse,\" yet it is  significant as indicating that the building was then still standing.  What ultimately became of it we do not know. For a time, however, its  memory survived in Curtain Court (see page 79), and to-day its fame is  perpetuated in Curtain Road.    [Footnote 147: See Jeaffreson, _Middlesex County Records_, III, 164,  from which the notice was quoted by Ordish, _Early London Theatres_,  p. 106.]          CHAPTER V    THE FIRST BLACKFRIARS      The choir boys of the Chapel Royal, of Windsor, and of Paul's were all  engaged in presenting dramatic entertainments before Queen Elizabeth.  Each organization expected to be called upon one or more times a  year--at Christmas, New Year's, and other like occasions--to furnish  recreation to Her Majesty; and in return for its efforts each received  a liberal \"reward\" in money. Richard Farrant, Master of the Windsor  Chapel, was especially active in devising plays for the Queen's  entertainment. But having a large family, he was poor in spite of his  regular salary and the occasional \"rewards\" he received for the  performances of his Boys at Court; and doubtless he often cast about  in his mind for some way in which to increase his meagre income.    In the spring of 1576 James Burbage, having conceived the idea of a  building devoted solely to plays, had leased a plot of ground for the  purpose, and had begun the erection of the Theatre. By the autumn, no  doubt, the building was nearing completion, if, indeed, it was not  actually open to the public; and the experiment, we may suppose, was  exciting much interest in the dramatic circles of London. It seems to  have set Farrant to thinking. The professional actors, he observed,  had one important advantage over the child actors: not only could they  present their plays before the Queen and receive the usual court  reward, but in addition they could present their plays before the  public and thus reap a second and richer harvest. Since the child  actors had, as a rule, more excellent plays than the professional  troupes, and were better equipped with properties and costumes, and  since they expended just as much energy in devising plays and in  memorizing and rehearsing their parts, Farrant saw no reason why they,  too, should not be allowed to perform before the public. This, he  thought, might be done under the guise of rehearsals for the Court.  Possibly the Queen might even wink at regular performances before the  general public when she understood that this would train the Boys to  be more skilful actors, would provide Her Majesty with more numerous  and possibly more excellent plays, and would enable the Master and his  assistants to live in greater comfort without affecting the royal  purse.    [Illustration: BLACKFRIARS MONASTERY    A plan of the various buildings as they appeared before the  dissolution, based on the Loseley Manuscripts and other documents,  surveys, and maps. The Buttery became Farrant's, the Frater Burbage's  playhouse. (Drawn by the author.)]    For Farrant to build a playhouse specifically for the use of the  Children was out of the question. In the first place, it would be too  conspicuously a capitalization of the royal choristers for private  gain; and in the second place, it would be far too hazardous a  business venture for so poor a man as he to undertake. The more  sensible thing for him to do was to rent somewhere a large hall which  could at small expense be converted into a place suitable for training  the Children in their plays, and for the entertainment of  select--possibly at first invited--audiences. The performances, of  course, were not to be heralded by a trumpet-and-drum procession  through the street, by the flying of a flag, and by such-like vulgar  advertising as of a public show; instead, they were to be quiet,  presumably \"private,\" and were to attract only noblemen and those  citizens of the better class who were interested in the drama.[148]    [Footnote 148: From this notion of privacy, I take it, arose the term  \"private\" theatre as distinguished from \"common\" or \"public\" theatre.  The interpretation of the term suggested by Mr. W.J. Lawrence, and  approved by Mr. William Archer, namely, that it was a legal device to  escape the city ordinance of 1574, cannot be accepted. The city had no  jurisdiction over the precinct of Blackfriars, nor did Farrant live in  the building.]    [Illustration: THE SITES OF THE TWO BLACKFRIARS PLAYHOUSES    The smaller rectangle at the north represents the Buttery, later  Farrant's playhouse, the larger rectangle represents the Frater, later  Burbage's playhouse. (From Ogilby and Morgan's _Map of London_, 1677,  the sites marked by the author.)]    Such was Farrant's scheme. In searching for a hall suitable for his  purpose, his mind at once turned to the precinct of Blackfriars, where  in former years the Office of the Revels had been kept, and where the  Children had often rehearsed their plays. The precinct had once, as  the name indicates, been in the possession of the Dominican or \"Black\"  Friars. The Priory buildings had consisted chiefly of a great church  two hundred and twenty feet long and sixty-six feet broad, with a  cloister on the south side of the church forming a square of one  hundred and ten feet, and a smaller cloister to the south of this. At  the dissolution of the religious orders, the property had passed into  the possession of the Crown; hence, though within the city walls, it  was not under the jurisdiction of the city authorities. Farrant  probably did not anticipate any interference on the part of the Common  Council with the royal choristers \"practicing\" their plays in order  \"to yield Her Majesty recreation and delight,\" yet the absolute  certainty of being free from the adverse legislation of the London  authorities was not to be ignored. Moreover, the precinct was now the  home of many noblemen and wealthy gentlemen, and Farrant probably  thought that, as one of the most fashionable residential districts in  London, it was suitable for \"private\" performances to be given by  members of Her Majesty's household.    In furthering his project he sought the counsel and aid of his \"very  friend\" Sir Henry Neville, Lieutenant of Windsor, who, it is to be  presumed, was interested in the Windsor Boys. It happened that Neville  knew of exactly such rooms as were desired, rooms in the old monastery  of Blackfriars which he himself had once leased as a residence, and  which, he heard, were \"to be let either presently, or very shortly.\"  These rooms were in the southwestern corner of the monastery, on the  upper floor of two adjoining buildings formerly used "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22409"],[0,"A Woman who went to Alaska (#15)"],[1," deposited ourselves, still dressed, upon the tops of  madam's big packing cases, from which had been taken pillows and  blankets, and slept soundly till morning, notwithstanding the fact that  the hammers of hundreds of carpenters were busy around us all night.    Next morning all felt fresh and invigorated. The sun shone brightly. In  the roadstead two miles away lay several newly arrived steamers, their  deep-toned whistles frequently sounding over the intervening waters. It  was a beautiful sight and welcome sound. How easily the long and  graceful breakers rolled and broke upon the sands. With what music the  foam-tipped wavelets spread their edges, like the lace-trimmed ruffles  on some lady's gown, upon the smooth and glistening beach. How the white  tents everywhere looked like doves of peace just alighted, and the  little boats danced up and down on the river. I was glad to be there. I  enjoyed it. Nothing, not even the hard work, the storms, nor the bitter  Arctic winter which came afterwards ever effaced from my memory the  beautiful pictures of river, sea and sky repeatedly displayed during  those first novel and busy days at Nome.          CHAPTER X.    THE FOUR SISTERS.      It was during the first excitement of the gold discoveries in the  Klondyke that four sisters left their home in Chicago and started for  Dawson. They were young, hopeful, ambitious and handsome. They owned a  town lot in the city, but they had not the means with which to erect a  building upon it, and the money would never be forthcoming if they  remained where they were. The ordinary salary of a working woman in  office or store was not sufficient to allow them more than a trifle  above necessary living expenses, and they could see themselves old,  wrinkled and grey before they could hope to attain their desired object.    Reaching Dawson safely, as they did after weeks of peril and many novel  experiences, they set to work at what seemed to them at the moment the  most lucrative labor of which they were capable. They were fitted for  laundry work only by being well and strong physically, and by having a  willingness to do whatever they first found to do.    This proved to be work at the wash-tub. Here the four women labored  month after month with a will, with the result that at the end of a year  their bank account was not insignificant, they owned several gold  claims, and in all the mining camp there were none who did not respect  the four sisters.    Then came their first dark days. It was midsummer. Down among the grass  roots and between the rocks of the hillside back of the famous camp,  there trickled numerous fresh water springs, pure and cold when they  left their sequestered sources among the seams and fissures, but gaining  nothing of purity when spread out upon the little plain now thickly  dotted with cabins.    Here in the hurry and rush of the fast growing camp, when fortunes came  quickly, and men lived at a rapid pace, there was little time for  sanitary precautions, and so it presently happened that a shadow, like a  huge black bird of ill omen, suddenly hovered above the camp, sending a  shudder through its entire length. A tiny germ, so small as to pass  unnoticed and unheeded by, and yet withal so deadly as to be called a  plague, crept along, insinuating itself into the streamlets making their  way as best they could to their father, the Yukon; and the fever laid  low many victims.    Early and late had the sisters toiled, never in a half-hearted way, but  untiringly, day after day, until one of their number, being perhaps less  strong, or more weary from work to which she had been unaccustomed, and  more susceptible to disease, was stricken with fever, and after only a  few days' illness, whispered her loving good-byes.    This happened in the summer of 1899, and rumors of the great gold strike  at Nome now reached Dawson. One sister had been persuaded by a member of  the Dawson Bar to make for him a happy home during the remainder of his  life, and she was married.    Again their party numbered the original four, though there were now only  three sisters.    The excitement in Dawson regarding the new Nome gold fields daily  increased, and it was stated by reliable steamer men from St. Michael  that the new strike rivaled that of the Klondyke.    The little party of four decided to go to Nome. In a short time their  business was arranged, sales made, gold claims placed in charge of  agents, and everything made in readiness for their journey to Nome.    It was the middle of September. The last boats were leaving Dawson, both  for points on the Upper Yukon and for St. Michael. People leaving Dawson  by boat in the fall seldom linger beyond the third or fourth week in  September, for then the river may freeze at any time and they be  prisoners in the camp indefinitely.    The lower river steamer \"Hannah\" was about to push from the dock at  Dawson when a friend introduced me to the three sisters, and during the  following days on board an acquaintance sprung up which I much enjoyed.  Little did we know that this friendship would afterwards be renewed  nearly two thousand miles away, and under circumstances vastly different  from any with which we had before become familiar.    Landing safely from the \"Hannah\" at St. Michael, a few days were spent  by the sisters waiting for stormy weather to subside, and they then  sailed for Nome. Here they landed during the last days of September,  amid falling snow, bleak winds and boiling surf, upon the sands of the  most inhospitable beach in all that dreary Northland. No tree was to be  seen. Not a rock under whose friendly shelter one might hide from the  storms. There was almost no lumber in the camp with which to build  houses, and no incoming steamers expected. A few rude shacks, tents and  saloons, with two or three companies' buildings--of these was the town  composed. Many were rushing for the steamers in waiting, determined only  upon one thing--to get home to the States. Some carried heavy sacks of  gold, others went empty-handed. There was the summer's accumulation of  filth in the camp, too young as yet for cleanly conditions, and these  brought their sure accompaniment--the fever. Many suffered for weeks  with it, and then died.    Again came the dread plague to the sisters. Scarcely had they unpacked  their trunks or found shelter for the winter when the younger of the  sisters was stricken down. For days she raved in delirium, and all  feared she would die. Night and day they watched anxiously by her  bedside. Everything was done for her recovery and comfort that could be  done in a new and rough camp like the one at Nome; for all who knew the  beautiful little sister loved her well.    Then came the time when all the long and heavy yellow hair had to be cut  from the lovely head in obedience to the doctor's orders. But the little  sister lived. Their prayers were answered, the worst was over, the  danger past.    Then followed long and weary weeks of convalescing, while the winter  storms raged outside the little cabin, and the sun retreated farther  from the Arctic Circle and Nome, but the sisters thanked God, and again  took courage.    Months after came the welcome springtime. With the earliest fine weather  and revival of business in the camp the sisters erected a store building  and warehouse on the beach near by. Into the latter they moved  temporarily, hoping to rent the store to some of the numerous  \"tenderfeet\" sure to arrive on the first passenger steamers.    It was here I found the sisters on my arrival at Nome from San Francisco  in June, 1900. Little sister was well and strong again, growing a fresh  crop of roses and lilies on her cheeks, and a new head covering of  lovely, wavy yellow hair. On her lips she wore the same sweet, old  smiles, however, and I knew her well by these. Since her recovery from  the fever the hands of the sisters had not been idle, and they had  become expert at sewing furs. This had kept them busy as bees all  winter, and many were the caps, coats, mittens and capes made by their  industrious fingers, which brought them a good income, while their rooms  were always the rendezvous of friends than which a jollier lot could not  be discovered.    Of the good influence going out through the rough mining camp during the  long and dreary winter from the home of these sweet and Christian women,  no account has probably ever been kept, except by the recording angel,  who never forgets.    The day after we landed at Nome I secured work. Not, however, to begin  immediately, which pleased me well, as I should then have a little time  to look for father, inspect the camp, study conditions and take notes  and kodak views.    \"Can you cook for a gang of men?\" asked Mr. A. kindly smiling down at me  when I had stopped him on the street and asked for work in his camp for  the English girl and myself, as we wished to be together.    \"Indeed, I can. I will do my very best, Mr. A., and I feel sure we can  please you. My friend is an extra good cook, as you will discover if you  give us work. Will you try us?\"    \"I will,\" he replied.    \"At what wages, please?\"    \"Five dollars per day, each, with board,\" promptly answered the  gentleman whose two gold claims on famous Anvil Creek made him one of  the richest men in Alaska.    So it was settled. Claim number nine, Anvil, was about seven miles from  Nome, and one of the most noted claims in the district. Mr. A., a former  Swedish missionary at Golovin Bay, had, with his doctor brother, voyaged  to Nome on the \"St. Paul\" when we did, so we already had a slight  acquaintance with both gentlemen and were pleased to get the work.    Anvil Creek claims had been worked the summer before. Gold had first  been discovered in the fall of 1898 by Mr. Hultberg, a Swedish  missionary, who learned of the precious metal around Nome from the  Eskimos. His mission was stationed at Golovin Bay,"]]]
