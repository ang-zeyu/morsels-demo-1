The Aztec Thrush is rare in Coahuila. Van Hoose (1955:302) remarked  that No. 31619, the skull of which was incompletely ossified,  \"represents the northernmost record for this species, which was  previously unknown in Coahuila.\"    _Hylocichla guttata guttata_ (Pallas).--_Specimens examined:_ total 2:  [Male] [Male] 31074-31075 from 4 mi. W Hacienda La Mariposa, 2300 ft.,  March 25 and 26, 1952, weights, 25, 21 gms.    The Hermit Thrush is a common migrant or winter visitant in Coahuila.  _H. g. guttata_ has been reported from northern Coahuila. Miller  (1955a:171) observed _H. g. guttata_ (and _H. g. auduboni_) in the  Douglas fir and pine-oak belts and in the lower levels in the oaks at  the foot of the Sierra del Carmen. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:200) noted  _H. g. guttata_ \"in small numbers in the open woods surrounding the  summit of Diamante Pass, and at infrequent intervals in the arroyos on  the arid plateau near Saltillo.\"    _Hylocichla guttata sequoiensis_ (Belding).--Ridgway (1907:45) recorded  this subspecies of Hermit Thrush from Sierra Guadalupe in April.  However, Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:188) suggest that  the material on which this identification was based needs  redetermination.    _Hylocichla guttata auduboni_ (Baird).--_Specimens examined:_ total 3:  [Female] 31488 from Sierra del Pino (=5 mi. S, 3 mi. W Acebuches), May  12, 1954, weight, 25 gms.; [Female] 31076 (skeleton only) from Fortin  (=33 mi. N, 1 mi. E San Geronimo), 3300 ft., March 28, 1952; and  [Female] 31077 (skeleton only) from 26 mi. W Santa Teresa, 7050 ft.,  April 4, 1952.    Miller (1955a:171) found this subspecies of Hermit Thrush wintering  with _H. g. guttata_ in the Sierra del Carmen. Hellmayr (1934:456)  listed _H. g. auduboni_ from Sabinas.    **_Sialia sialis fulva_ Brewster.--Hellmayr (1934:479) listed this  subspecies of the Eastern Bluebird from Sabinas.    *_Sialia mexicana mexicana_ Swainson.--Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and  Moore (1957:199) remarked that the subspecies _mexicana_ of the Western  Bluebird breeds in the southern mountains of Coahuila where, at El  Diamante, on July 7, a specimen (or specimens ?) in breeding condition  was obtained. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:200) found _S. m. mexicana_  \"well distributed in the open woods about\" Diamante Pass, but at no  time below an elevation of approximately 6500 feet. Sutton and Burleigh  (1939a:38) also saw \"several brown-backed\" Western Bluebirds at  Diamante Pass on March 6. Ridgway (1907:150) recorded _S. m. mexicana_  from Saltillo, Carneros, and Sierra Guadalupe.    _Sialia currucoides_ (Bechstein).--_Specimen examined:_ one, [Female]  31078, from Sierra de la Encantada (=38 mi. S, 23 mi. E Boquillas),  4400 ft., March 14, 1952, weight, 23.7 gms.    The Mountain Bluebird is a winter visitant to Coahuila. Miller,  Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:200) recorded _Sialia currucoides_  from Hipolito on February 24.    **_Myadestes townsendi townsendi_ (Audubon).--_Specimen examined:_ one,  [Female] 31079, from 26 mi. W Santa Teresa, 7050 ft., April 4, 1952.    Miller (1955a:171) detected Townsend's Solitaire in clumps of large  pines in two different locations at 7000 and 7500 feet on April 4, 6,  and 8 in the Sierra del Carmen. He did not find a breeding population  of _M. t. townsendi_, but did note favorable habitat for breeding.  Ridgway (1907:164) recorded _M. townsendi_ from the Sierra Guadalupe on  April 21. Dickerman saw a Townsend's Solitaire in the Sierra de la  Madera on December 13, 1953.    The underparts of No. 31079 are not uniformly dark, being paler on the  chin, throat, and abdomen than elsewhere as is true of typical  representatives of _M. t. townsendi_.    **_Polioptila caerulea caerulea_ (Linnaeus).--_Specimen examined:_ one,  [Male] 32097, from 2 mi. S, 11 mi. E Nava, June 15, 1952.    No. 32097 is the first record of occurrence of this subspecies of  Blue-gray Gnatcatcher in the State. The white of the underparts of No.  32097 is less grayish than the underparts of typical representatives of  _P. c. amoenissima_, and the black at the base of the inner webs of the  outermost rectrix does not extend beyond the tip of the under tail  coverts. Representatives of _P. c. amoenissima_ have black at the base  of the inner web of the outermost rectrix more extended, usually  showing beyond the tip of the under tail coverts. The size of the  testes (3x2 mm.) of No. 32097 does not suggest breeding, but the date  (June 15) indicates that it was a resident.    *_Polioptila caerulea amoenissima_ Grinnell.--_Specimen examined:_ one,  [Male] 31080, from 7 mi. S, 2 mi. E Boquillas, 800 ft., February 29,  1952, weight, 5.4 gms.    This subspecies of the Blue-gray Gnatcatcher breeds in Coahuila and  occurs throughout all of the State except the northeastern section.  Miller (1955a:171) remarked that \"this gnatcatcher was apparently  established on summer territories in the oaks and walnuts of the wash  of Boquillas Canyon at the foot of the mountains\" of the Sierra del  Carmen. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:200) noted \"this species only in the  open woods at the summit of Diamante Pass, where, however, it was not  uncommon.\" Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:201) recorded  _P. c. amoenissima_ breeding at El Diamante on July 8.    *_Polioptila melanura melanura_ Lawrence.--_Specimen examined:_ one,  [Male] 31081, from 7 mi. S, 2 mi. E Boquillas, 800 ft., March 1, 1952,  weight, 5.6 gms.    In Coahuila this subspecies of the Black-tailed Gnatcatcher has been  recorded from several localities. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:200) found  that it \"was limited in its distribution to the lower altitudes and was  noted only in the open desert country west of Saltillo.\" Sutton and  Burleigh (1939a:38) noted it \"several times near San Pedro\" where on  January 29 one female was taken. Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore  (1957:205) recorded _P. m. melanura_ at Hipolito on June 30 to July 2  in breeding condition.    _Regulus satrapa satrapa_ Lichtenstein.--Miller (1955a:171) found a  small wintering flock of Golden-crowned Kinglets in the Sierra del  Carmen; this is the only record of the species in Coahuila.    _Regulus calendula calendula_ (Linnaeus).--_Specimens examined:_ total  5: [Female] 31085 from the Rio Grande (=17 mi. S Dryden, Terrell Co.,  Texas, in Coahuila), 600 ft., March 19, 1952, weight, 6.3 gms.; [Male]  [Male] 31082-31083 from 1 mi. N Boquillas, 700 ft., March 8, 1952,  weight, 7.2, 6.5 gms.; [Male] 31084 from Sierra de la Encantada (=38  mi. S, 23 mi. E Boquillas), 4400 ft., March 15, 1954, weight, 5.4 gms.;  and [Male] 31661 from the north slope of Sierra Guadalupe (=11 mi. S, 7  mi. W General Cepeda), 7800 ft., April 20, 1953, weight, 5 gms.    In Coahuila this subspecies of the Ruby-crowned Kinglet is a common  migrant. Miller (1955a:171) found it (and _R. c. cineraceus_) \"common  in the conifers and oaks of the upper levels of the mountains [Sierra  del Carmen], at 6500 to 7000 feet, as winter visitants or migrants.\"  Burleigh and Lowery (1942:201) took specimens of _R. c. calendula_ at  Diamante Pass on April 15, at the Chorro del Agua on April 19, and at  20 mi. W Saltillo on April 22. Sutton and Burleigh (1939a:38) noted the  Ruby-crowned Kinglet \"in the arid parts of southern Coahuila.\" Hellmayr  (1934:513) listed _R. c. calendula_ from Sabinas. Dickerman saw  Ruby-crowned Kinglets in the Sierra de la Madera on December 13, 1953,  20 mi. S Ocampo on April 4, 1954, and 3 mi. S and 13 mi. E San Antonio  de las Alazanas on January 12, 1954.    _Regulus calendula cineraceus_ Grinnell.--Miller (1955a:171) found _R.  c. cineraceus_ common in the Sierra del Carmen; on April 3, 5, and 10  the birds were \"abundant, as though a wave of migrants were passing  through.\"    _Anthus spinoletta rubescens_ (Tunstall).--_Specimens examined:_ Total  3: [Male] [Male] 31086-31087 and sex ? 31088 from 1 mi. N Boquillas,  700 ft., March 6, 7, and 8, 1952, weights, 19.3, 19.9, and 16.6 gms.    This subspecies of the Water Pipit is an uncommon winter visitant or  migrant in Coahuila. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:201) found \"a flock of  ten birds ... on the outskirts of Saltillo\" on April 18. Miller,  Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:210) recorded _A. s. rubescens_  from Cuatro Cienegas in November and from Hipolito in February.    _Anthus spinoletta pacificus_ Todd.--Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and  Moore (1957:209) recorded this Water Pipit from Cuatro Cienegas in  February and from Hipolito in November.    _Bombycilla cedrorum_ Vieillot.--The Cedar Waxwing is an uncommon  winter visitant to Coahuila. Miller (1955a:171) recorded a flock in the  Sierra del Carmen on April 5, and another flock on April 21. Burleigh  and Lowery (1942:201) saw two small flocks on April 15 \"in the open  woods just below the summit of Diamante Pass.\"    *_Phainopepla nitens nitens_ Swainson.--_Specimen examined:_ one,  [Male] 31674, from the west foot of Pico de Jimulco, 5000 ft., April 3,  1953, weight, 35 gms.    The Phainopepla occurs throughout most of Coahuila. Sutton and Burleigh  (1939a:39) reported _P. n. nitens_ from Diamante Pass on March 6. On  April 15 and 17 Burleigh and Lowery (1942:201) saw scattered pairs of  the Phainopepla \"only in the open woods surrounding Diamante Pass.\"  Miller (1955a:171) noted _P. n. nitens_ \"on April 20 and 28 in large  clumps of mesquite near Piedra Blanca, at about 4500 feet, on the  foothills\" of the Sierra del Carmen. Dickerman saw a Phainopepla 20 mi.  S Ocampo on April 4, 1954. Baird (1858:320) listed a male _P. n.  nitens_ from Coahuila, Mexico. Hellmayr (1935:107) remarked that  _Phainopepla nitens_ was listed from Coahuila by \"Salvin and Godman,  Biol. Centr.--Amer., Aves, 1, p. 220, 1883....\" Miller, Friedmann,  Griscom, and Moore (1957:213) stated that _P. n. nitens_ breeds at El  Diamante. The long"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26117"],[0,"Sketches of the Fair Sex, in All Parts of the World. (#15)"],[1,"nd, though too much  on the reserve, and prone to keep at an unnecessary distance, are yet  capable of the truest attachment, and always warm and zealous in the  cause of those whom they have admitted to their friendship.    Though the Germans are rather a dull and phlegmatic people, and not  greatly enslaved by the warmer passions, yet at the court of Vienna they  are much given to intrigue: and an amour is so far from being  scandalous, that a woman gains credit by the rank of her gallant, and is  reckoned silly and unfashionable if she scrupulously adheres to the  virtue of chastity. But such customs are more the customs of courts,  than of places less exposed to temptation, and consequently less  dissolute; and we are well assured that in Germany there are many women  who do honor to humanity, not by chastity only, but also by a variety of  other virtues.    The ladies at the principal courts, differ not much in their dress from  the French and English. They are not, however, so excessively fond of  paint as the former. At some courts, they appear in rich furs: and all  of them are loaded with jewels, if they can obtain them. The female part  of the burgher's families, in many of the German towns, dress in a very  different manner, and some of them inconceivably fantastic, as may be  seen in many prints published in books of travels. But, in this respect,  they are gradually reforming, and many of them make quite a different  appearance in their dress from what they did thirty or forty years ago.    The inhabitants of Vienna lived luxuriously, a great part of their time  being spent in feasting and carousing. In winter, when the different  branches of the Danube are frozen over, and the ground covered with  snow, the ladies take their recreation in sledges of different shapes,  such as griffins, tigers, swans, scallop-shells, etc. Here the lady  sits, dressed in velvet lined with rich furs, and adorned with laces and  jewels, having on her head a velvet cap. The sledge is drawn by one  horse, stag or other creature, set off with plumes of feathers, ribbons  and bells. As this diversion is taken chiefly in the night time,  servants ride before the sledge with torches; and a gentleman, standing  on the sledge behind, guides the horse.      A VIEW OF MATRIMONY IN THREE DIFFERENT LIGHTS.    The marriage life is always an insipid, a vexatious, or a happy  condition, the first is, when two people of no taste meet together, upon  such a settlement as has been thought reasonable by parents and  conveyancers, from an exact valuation of the land and cash of both  parties. In this case the young lady's person is no more regarded than  the house and improvements in purchase of an estate; but she goes with  her fortune, rather than her fortune with her. These make up the crowd  or vulgar of the rich, and fill up the lumber of the human race, without  beneficence towards those below them, or respect towards those above  them; and lead a despicable, independent, and useless life, without  sense of the laws of kindness, good-nature, mutual offices, and the  elegant satisfactions which flow from reason and virtue.    The vexatious life arises from a conjunction of two people of quick  taste and resentment, put together for reasons well known to their  friends, in which especial care is taken to avoid (what they think the  chief of evils) poverty; and ensure them riches with every evil besides.  These good people live in a constant restraint before company, and when  alone, revile each other's person and conduct. In company they are in  purgatory; when by themselves, in hell.    The happy marriage is, where two persons meet, and voluntarily make  choice of each other without principally regarding or neglecting the  circumstances of fortune or beauty. These may still love in spite of  adversity or sickness. The former we may in some measure defend  ourselves from; the other is the common lot of humanity. Love has  nothing to do with riches or state. Solitude, with the person beloved,  has a pleasure, even in a woman's mind, beyond show or pomp.      BETROTHING AND MARRIAGE.    At a very early period, families who lived in a friendly manner, fell  upon a method of securing their children to each other by what is called  in the sacred writings Betrothing. This was agreeing on a price to be  paid for the bride, the time when it should be paid, and when she should  be delivered into the hands of her husband.    There were, according to the Talmudists, three ways of betrothing. The  first by a written contract. The second, by a verbal agreement,  accompanied with a piece of money. And the third, by the parties coming  together, and living as husband and wife; which might as properly be  called marriage as betrothing.    The written contract was in the following manner--\"On such a day, month,  year, A the son of B, has said to D the daughter of E, be thou my spouse  according to the law of Moses and of the Israelites; and I give thee as  a dowry the sum of two hundred suzims, as it is ordered by our law. And  the said D hath promised to be his spouse upon the conditions aforesaid,  which the said A doth promise to perform on the day of marriage. And to  this the said A doth hereby bind himself and all that he hath, to the  very cloak upon his back; engages himself to love, honor, feed, clothe,  and protect her, and to perform all that is generally implied in  contracts of marriage in favor of the Israelitish wives.\"    The verbal agreement was made in the presence of a sufficient number of  witnesses, by the man saying to the women, \"Take this money as a pledge  that at such a time I will take thee to be my wife.\" A woman who was  thus betrothed or bargained for, was almost in every respect by the law  considered as already married.    Before the legislation of Moses, \"marriages among the Jews,\" say the  Rabbies, \"were agreed on by the parents and relations of both sides.  When this was done, the bridegroom was introduced to his bride. Presents  were mutually exchanged, the contract signed before witnesses, and the  bride, having remained sometime with her relations, was sent away to the  habitation of her husband, in the night, with singing, dancing, and the  sound of musical instruments.\"    By the institution of Moses, the Rabbies tell us the contract of  marriage was read in the presence of, and signed by, at least ten  witnesses, who were free, and of age. The bride, who had taken care to  bathe herself the night before, appeared in all her splendor, but  veiled, in imitation of Rebecca, who veiled herself when she came in  sight of Isaac. She was then given to the bridegroom by her parents, in  words to this purpose: \"Take her according to the law of Moses.\" And he  received her, by saying, \"I take her according to that law.\" Some  blessings were then pronounced on the young couple, both by the parents  and the rest of the company.    The blessings or prayers generally run in this style: \"Blessed art thou,  O Lord of heaven, and earth, who has created man in thine own likeness,  and hast appointed woman to be his partner and companion! Blessed art  thou, who fillest Zion with joy for the multitude of her children!  Blessed art thou who sendest gladness to the bridegroom and his bride;  who hast ordained for them, love, joy, tenderness, peace and mutual  affection. Be pleased to bless not only this couple, but Judah and  Jerusalem, with songs of joy, and praise for the joy that thou givest  them, by the multitudes of their sons and of their daughters.\"    After the virgins had sung a marriage song, the company partook of a  repast, the most magnificent the parties could afford; after which they  began a dance, the men round the bridegroom, the women round the bride.  They pretended that this dance was of divine institution and an  essential part of the ceremony. The bride was then carried to the  nuptial bed, and the bridegroom left with her. The company again  returned to their feasting and rejoicing; and the Rabbies inform us,  that this feasting, when the bride, was a widow, lasted only three days,  but seven if she was a virgin.    At the birth of a son, the father planted a cedar; and at that of a  daughter, he planted a pine. Of these trees the nuptial bed was  constructed, when the parties, at whose birth they were planted, entered  into the married state.    The Assyrians had a court, or tribunal whose only business was to  dispose of young women in marriage, and see the laws of that union  properly executed. What these laws were, or how the execution of them  was enforced, are circumstances that have not been handed down to us.  But the erecting a court solely for the purpose of taking cognizance of  them, suggests an idea that they were many and various.    Among the Greeks, the multiplicity of male and female deities who were  concerned in the affairs of love, made the invocations and sacrifices on  a matrimonial occasion a very tedious affair. Fortunate omens gave great  joy, and the most fortunate of all others was a pair of turtles seen in  the air, as those birds were reckoned the truest emblems of conjugal  love and fidelity. If, however, one of them was seen alone it infallibly  denoted separation, and all the ills attending an unhappy marriage.    On the wedding day, the bride and bridegroom were richly dressed, and  adorned with garlands of herbs and flowers. The bride was conducted in  the evening to the house of her husband in a chariot, seated between her  husband and one of his relations. When she alighted from the chariot the  axle-tree of it was burnt to show that there was no method for her to  return back. As soon as the young couple entered the house, figs and  other fruits were thrown upon their heads to denote plenty; and a  sumptuous entertainment was ready for them to partake of, to which all  the relations on both sides were invited.    The bride was lighted to bed by a number of torches,"]]]
