The authors think this is the highest  cost on record for ramming. It is evident, however, that the men were  under a poor foreman, for an output of only 15 cu. yds. per day with 10  men is very low for ordinary conditions. Moreover, the expensive amount  of ramming indicates either poor management or the most foolish  inspection requirements.    In conclusion it may be noted that if engineers specify a dry concrete  and \"thorough ramming,\" they would do well also to specify what the word  \"thorough\" is to mean, using language that can be expressed in cents per  cubic yard. It is a common thing, for example, to see a sewer trench  specification in which one tamper is required for each two men shoveling  the back-fill into the trench; and some such specific requirement should  be made in a concrete specification if close estimates from reliable  contractors are desired. Surely no engineer will claim that this is too  unimportant a matter for consideration when it is known that ramming can  easily be made to cost as high as 40 cts. per cu. yd., depending largely  upon the whim of the inspector.    ~THE COST OF SUPERINTENDENCE.~--This item is obviously dependent upon the  yardage of concrete handled under one foreman and the daily wages of the  foreman. If a foreman receives $3 a day and is bossing a job where only  12 cu. yds. are placed daily, we have a cost of 25 cts. per cu. yd. for  superintendence. If the same foreman is handling a gang of 20 men whose  output is 50 cu. yds., the superintendence item is only 6 cts. per cu.  yd. If the same foreman is handling a concrete-mixing plant having a  daily output of 150 cu. yds., the cost of superintendence is but 2 cts.  per cu. yd. These elementary examples have been given simply because  figures are more impressive than generalities, and because it is so  common a sight to see money wasted by running too small a gang of men  under one foreman.    Of all classes of contract work, none is more readily estimated day by  day than concrete work, not only because it is usually built in regular  shapes whose volumes are easily ascertained at the end of each day, but  because a record of the bags, or barrels, or batches gives a ready  method of computing the output of each gang. For this reason small gangs  of concrete workers need no foreman at all, provided one of the workers  is given command and required to keep tally of the batches. If the  efficiency of a gang of 6 men were to fall off, say, 15 per cent., by  virtue of having no regular non-working foreman in charge, the loss  would be only $1.35 a day--a loss that would be more than  counterbalanced by the saving of a foreman's wages. Indeed, the  efficiency of a gang of 6 men would have to fall off 25 per cent., or  more, before it would pay to put a foreman in charge. In many cases the  efficiency will not fall off at all, provided the gang knows that its  daily progress is being recorded, and that prompt discharge will follow  laziness. Indeed, one of the authors has more than once had the  efficiency increased by leaving a small gang to themselves in command of  one of the workers who was required to punch a hole in a card for every  batch.    To reduce the cost of superintendence there is no surer method than to  work two gangs of 18 to 20 men, side by side, each gang under a separate  foreman who is striving to make a better showing than his competitor.  This is done with marked advantage in street paving, and could be done  elsewhere oftener than it is.    In addition to the cost of a foreman in direct charge of the laborers,  there is always a percentage of the cost of general superintendence and  office expenses to be added. In some cases a general superintendent is  put in charge of one or two foremen; and, if he is a high-salaried man,  the cost of superintendence becomes a very appreciable item.    ~SUMMARY OF COSTS.~--Having thus analyzed the costs of making and placing  concrete, we can understand why it is that printed records of costs vary  so greatly. Moreover, we are enabled to estimate the labor cost with far  more accuracy than we can guess it; for by studying the requirements of  the specifications, and the local conditions governing the placing of  stock piles, mixing boards, etc., we can estimate each item with  considerable accuracy. The purpose, however, has not been solely to show  how to predict the labor cost, but also to indicate to contractors and  their foremen some of the many possibilities of reducing the cost of  work once the contract has been secured. An analysis of costs, such as  above given, is the most effective way of discovering unnecessary  \"leaks,\" and of opening one's eyes to the possibilities of effecting  economies in any given case.    To indicate the method of summarizing the costs of making concrete by  hand, let us assume that the concrete is to be put into a deep  foundation requiring wheeling a distance of 30 ft.; that the stock piles  are on plank 60 ft. distant from the mixing board; that the  specifications call for 6 turns of gravel concrete thoroughly rammed in  6-in. layers; and that a good sized gang of, say, 16 men (at $1.50 a day  each), is to work under a foreman receiving $2.70 a day. We then have  the following summary by applying the rules already given:                                                    Per cu. yd.                                                  concrete.  Loading sand, stone and cement                    $ .17  Wheeling 60 ft. in barrows (4 + 2 cts.)             .06  Mixing concrete, 6 turns at 5 cts.                  .30  Wheeling 30 ft. (4 + 1 ct.)                         .05  Dumping barrows (1 man helping barrowman)           .05  Spreading and heavy ramming                         .15                                                   ------  Total cost of labor                                $.90  Foreman, at $2.70 a day                             .10                                                   ------  Grand total                                       $1.00    To estimate the daily output of this gang of 16 laborers proceed thus:  Divide the daily wages of all the 16 men, expressed in cents, by the  labor cost of the concrete in cents, the quotient will be the cubic  yards output of the gang. Thus, 2,400 ÷ 90 is 27 cu. yds., in this case.    In street paving work where no man is needed to help dump the  wheelbarrows, and where it is usually possible to shovel concrete direct  from the mixing board into place, and where half as much ramming as  above assumed is usually satisfactory, we see that the last four labor  items instead of amounting to 12 + 5 + 5 + 15, or 37 cts., amount only  to one-half of the last item, one-half of 15 cts., or 7½ cts. This  makes the total labor cost only 60 cts. instead of 90 cts. If we divide  2,400 cts. (the total day's wages of 16 men) by 60 cts. (the labor cost  per cu. yd.), we have 40, which is the cubic yards output of the 16 men.  This greater output of the 16 men reduces the cost of superintendence to  7 cts. per cu. yd.          CHAPTER IV.    METHODS AND COST OF MAKING AND PLACING CONCRETE BY MACHINE.      The making and placing of concrete is virtually a manufacturing process.  This process as performed by manual labor is discussed in the preceding  chapter; it will be discussed here as it is performed by machinery. The  objects sought in using machinery for making and placing concrete are:  (1) The securing of a more perfectly mixed and uniform concrete, and (2)  the securing of a cheaper cost of concrete in place. As in every other  manufacturing process both objects cannot be obtained to the highest  degree without co-ordinate and universal efficiency throughout in plant  and methods. For example, the substitution of machine mixing for hand  mixing will not alone ensure cheaper concrete. If all materials are  delivered to the machine in wheelbarrows and if the concrete is conveyed  away in wheelbarrows, the cost of making concrete even with machine  mixers is high. On the other hand, where the materials are fed from bins  by gravity into the mixer and when the mixed concrete is hauled away in  cars, the cost of making the concrete may be very low. Making and  placing concrete by machinery involves not one but several mechanical  operations working in conjunction--in a word, a concrete making plant is  required.    The mechanical equipment of a concrete making plant has four duties to  perform. (1) It has to transport the raw materials from the cars or  boats or pits and place them in the stock piles or storage bins; (2) it  has to take the raw materials from stock and charge them to the mixer;  (3) it has to mix the raw materials into concrete and discharge the  mixture into transportable vehicles; and (4) it has to transport these  vehicles from the mixer to the work and discharge them. As all these  operations are interrelated component parts of one great process, it is  plain why one operation cannot lag without causing all the other  operations to slow up.    The mechanical devices which may be used for each of these operations  are various, and they may be combined in various ways to make the  complete train of machinery necessary to the complete process. In this  chapter we shall describe the character and qualities of each type of  devices separately. The practicable ways of combining them to form a  complete concrete making plant are best illustrated by descriptions and  records of work of actual plants, and such descriptions and records for  each class of structure considered in this book are given in the  following chapters and may be found by consulting the index. In  describing the various machines and devices we have made one  classification for those used in handling raw materials and mixed  concrete, for the reason that nearly all of them are suitable for either  purpose.

You may be owning Crescent Ranch some day, and I want  you to hear what I have to say. There is not much more to tell. After  you and your father had gone to the range with Sandy I sat down and  thought it all over. Here I was, alone! There was no getting away from  myself. I reviewed all the plans I had made--how I was going to stock  some of my friends at Glen City with provisions and charge it up to  Clark & Sons; how I was going to pad the accounts and keep the money--I  went over the whole thing, and I felt mean as a cur. It came to me that  it was a pretty poor game. Then another plan came into my mind. You were  giving me a chance to be decent--why didn't I take it? I did. I have  been absolutely honest about running the ranch while you have been gone,  Mr. Clark. I can look you and Donald in the eye just as Sandy, Jose,  Bernardo, and the other men do who have been working for your interest  all these years.\"    Mr. Clark put out his hand.    \"I am glad you told me this, Thornton,\" he said quietly, \"and I believe  you. See, here is a sheet of paper; it is scrawled over with letters and  figures of every sort. Turn it over.\"    Wonderingly the man obeyed. Nothing was written on the other side. It  was a blank page.    \"You see there is nothing on that side,\" went on Donald's father. \"We  can there write what we will. Turn your own page the same way. Let us  forget the past. Now for the future! Will you take the position as  manager of Crescent Ranch?\"    Thornton was aghast.    \"I, sir! I? After all that has happened?\" he contrived to stammer.    \"Why not?\"    \"I couldn't do it, Mr. Clark. Not one of the men would believe in me.  No, I am going to leave this place after the shearing is over, and go  somewhere where no one knows me; there I can make a fresh start. And  anyway, even if all this had not happened, I am not the man to be  manager here. I have neither the confidence of the herders, nor the  necessary knowledge about the flocks. But there is a man on Crescent  Ranch who knows everything there is to know about sheep-raising--a man  honest as the day, and who loves the place as if it was his own--Sandy  McCulloch, sir. He is the only man for the position--there never has  been any one else. Put him in as manager and you will never regret it.\"    Donald sprang up.    \"Oh, father, do put Sandy in,\" he cried. \"I never thought of Sandy as  manager--he seems so young!\"    \"I have thought of him all along,\" Thornton continued. \"That is why I  was so ready with a word against him every chance I got. I have been  afraid of him--afraid of his honesty and his goodness. It was not that  he would tell tales about me; Sandy is too big-natured a man to do  that. He would scorn to use a mean weapon. No, it was just because he  was what he was that I feared him.\"    Mr. Clark was silent.    \"You owe it to Old Angus, Sandy's father, to give the lad the place,  sir,\" pleaded Thornton.    \"And if I did what is to become of you, Thornton?\" asked the owner  slowly.    \"Oh, I don't know. It does not matter. I will stay here until after the  shearing, for it is a busy time and I might be of help. Then I can go  and look up something else.\"    Donald watched his father as he bent forward and stirred the fire. The  well-known little wrinkle had come in his forehead and the boy knew that  his mind was busy.    \"Thornton,\" said Mr. Clark at last, \"have you relatives here in the  West?\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"Are you alone in the world?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Would you like to go East with Donald and me when we return to Boston  after the shearing?\"    Thornton regarded him blankly.    \"I need another man in my office,\" explained the wool-broker. \"You have  proved yourself a good accountant. Furthermore it would be greatly to  our advantage to have a reliable helper who is familiar with ranch  affairs and knows Sandy, the new manager. Then if I wanted some one, as  I often have in the past, to make the trip out here and attend to  business for me, you could do it.\"    Thornton got up and walked to the window. They could not see his face.  He stood with his back toward them, looking out into the darkness.    Then suddenly he wheeled and came to Mr. Clark's side.    \"You took me by surprise, sir,\" he said unsteadily. \"I cannot thank you.  I know well it is another chance you are giving me. I will take it and  go East, and there I will prove to you that in the future you can trust  me.\"    \"You have proved that already, Thornton,\" replied Donald's father, as he  smiled up into the face of the ranchman and gripped his coarse brown  hand.    After Thornton had left the room Donald and his father were silent.    At last the boy said:    \"You were right about Thornton, father. He was honest with you, just as  you predicted he would be.\"    \"I believe if you expect the best of a man you will usually get it,\"  replied Mr. Clark. \"There is something big and honest in each of us  which springs to meet the big and honest in somebody else. Appeal to  that best side of people and it will respond. I have seldom known the  rule to fail. Now just one thing more. Do not forget that this man has  given us his confidence. It is a thing we must hold sacred. Never repeat  what you have heard. And above all remember that Thornton deserves both  admiration and respect, for it is only great natures that admit they  have done wrong.\"    Donald nodded.    \"I like Thornton better than I did before father,\" he said softly.    \"So do I, son!\"    [Illustration]          CHAPTER XI    THE SHEARING      There was great rejoicing among the herders when, in the latter part of  April, they drove their flocks to Glen City for the shearing, and heard  that Sandy McCulloch had been made manager of Crescent Ranch.    Mr. Clark and Donald gave out the facts with greatest care--how Thornton  was to become Clark & Son's confidential man at the Boston office; and  how Sandy was to take the vast sheep-raising portion of the business  under his direction.    \"It is a proud day for you, Sandy!\" cried Jose.    \"I'm no pretending I ain't pleased,\" replied Sandy, beaming on the  Mexican, \"but dinna think I'm proud. If I do my work well pride may  come; still, it's no time for it now.\"    \"Of course you'll do it well--how could you help it! It is in your  blood,\" Jose declared. \"You have your father's own knack about the  flocks. It is the real love for herding--a kind of part of you, it  seems.\"    \"I get it from generations of shepherds who have tended the black-faced  sheep among the broom and the heather on the hills of Scotland, I doubt  not,\" answered Sandy.    \"Well, it stands you in good stead, however you come by it,\" Jose called  over his shoulder as he moved off toward the pen where his sheep were.    \"I hope it may stand me in good stead in the future, Don,\" Sandy said  gravely to the boy beside him.    \"I am sure it will. Isn't it splendid, Sandy, to see the herders all so  pleased and ready to follow out your orders? I think nothing could have  made me happier than to have you put in to manage the ranch.\"    \"I'm verra, verra glad myself, laddie. It is a thing I never dared hope  for, and I would not have wanted to take the job from Thornton. But  since he is going East and is to be well provided for it makes  everything right.\"    \"And yet you telegraphed my father to come here, Sandy.\"    It was the first time the telegram had ever been mentioned between them.    Sandy hesitated.    \"I felt your father should come out here and cast his eye over the place  and, loving the ranch so well, I took it on myself to send for him. But  I told no tales. It was his task to find the flaws if there were any. I  am no certain what he found and I dinna want to hear. I simply know the  snarls have straightened themselves out, and that Crescent Ranch is now  going on better than it has in years. The men have all been glad for a  glimpse of your father. It is no so much fun working for somebody you  have never seen. It has been a great thing to have him come. And as for  the herds--was there ever a finer sight?\"    He swept his hand around dramatically.    On every side, in numbered pens, sheep were waiting to be sheared.    It was the first time Donald had seen the stock all together and it was  indeed, as Sandy had declared, a fine sight.    The herders were not a little proud of the thickness of the fleeces of  their respective flocks and much good-natured banter passed between  them.    \"Is it on corn-husks you have been feeding your ewes that they look so  sickly?\" called one Mexican to another.    The swarthy herdsman grinned.    \"Mind your own band, Manuel Torquello! You haven't a fleece in your fold  that will tip the scales at ten pounds.\"    Both men laughed and passed on.    \"How much ought fleeces to weigh, Sandy?\" asked Donald.    \"From six to ten pounds--as the clip runs. Some are heavier, some  lighter. It depends on the quality of the wool, and the amount of oil in  it.\"    \"I don't see why the shearing is not done at the ranch instead of  driving all the sheep down here to Glen City,\" panted Donald as he tried  to keep up with Sandy's strides.    \"Why, you see, lad, it is much more convenient to have the wool clipped  near the railroad. In that way we do away with carting it. The fleeces  can be sheared, packed, weighed, and put right on the cars. Beside that,  we get the power to run our plant from Glen City. Our shearing is done  by electricity and not by hand, you know.\"    \"It is mean of me to make you answer questions, Sandy, when you are in  such a hurry,\" Donald ventured hesitatingly, \"but I wish you had time to  explain to me about the shearing.\"    Sandy was in a hurry--there was no denying that!    He and Donald had driven down from Crescent that morning, and were to  meet Thornton and Mr. Clark as soon as possible at the"]]]
