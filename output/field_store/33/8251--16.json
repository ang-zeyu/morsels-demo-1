As long as the Greeks could maintain their ranks  they repelled every attack; but when their spears were broken, and they  had only their swords left, the enemy began to press in between them.  Leonidas was one of the first that fell, and around his body the battle  raged fiercer than ever.  The Persians made the greatest efforts to  obtain possession of it; but four times they were driven back by the  Greeks with great slaughter.  At length, thinned in numbers, and  exhausted by fatigue and wounds, this noble band retired within the  pass, and seated themselves on a hillock.  Meanwhile the Persian  detachment, which had been sent across the mountains, began to enter  the pass from the south.  The Spartan heroes were now surrounded on  every side, overwhelmed with a shower of missiles, and killed to a man.    On the hillock, where the Greeks made their last stand, a marble lion  was set up in honour of Leonidas.  Another monument, erected near the  spot, contained the memorable inscription:--      \"Go, tell the Spartans, thou that passest by,    That here obedient to their laws we lie.\"    While Leonidas had been fighting at Thermopylae, the Greek fleet had  also been engaged with the Persians at Artemisium.  The Persian fleet  set sail from the gulf of Therma, and arrived in one day at almost the  southern corner of Magnesia.  In this position they were overtaken by a  sudden hurricane, which blew upon the shore with irresistible fury.  For three days and three nights the tempest raged without intermission;  and when calm at length returned, the shore was seen strewed for many  miles with wrecks and corpses.  At least four hundred ships of war were  destroyed, together with a countless number of transports, stores, and  treasures.  The Greek fleet had been seized with a panic terror at the  approach of the Persians, and retreated to Chalcis in the narrowest  part of the Euboean straits; but upon hearing of the disaster of the  Persian fleet, they took courage, and sailed back with the utmost speed  to their former station at Artemisium.  Being now encouraged to attack  the enemy, they gained some success.  On the following night another  terrific storm burst upon the Persians.  All night long it blew upon  the Thessalian coast at Aphetae, where the Persian ships were  stationed, thus causing little inconvenience to the Greeks upon the  opposite shore.  Notwithstanding these losses, the Persian fleet still  had a vast superiority of numbers, and determined to offer battle to  the Greeks.  Quitting the Thessalian coast, they sailed towards  Artemisium in the form of a crescent.  The Greeks kept near the shore,  to prevent the Persians from bringing their whole fleet into action.  The battle raged furiously the whole day, and each side fought with  determined valour.  Both parties suffered severely; and though the  Persians lost a greater number of ships and men, yet so many of the  Greek vessels were disabled that they found it would be impossible to  renew the combat. Under these circumstances the Greek commanders saw  that it would be necessary to retreat; and their determination was  hastened by the news which they now received, that Leonidas and his  companions had fallen, and that Xerxes was master of the pass of  Thermopylae.  Having sailed through the Euboean strait, the fleet  doubled the promontory of Sunium, and did not stop till it reached the  island of Salamis.    Meanwhile the Peloponnesians had abandoned Attica and the adjoining  states to their fate, whilst they strained every nerve to secure  themselves by fortifying the isthmus of Corinth.  The Athenians,  relying upon the march of a Peloponnesian army into Boeotia, had taken  no measures for the security of their families and property, and beheld  with terror and dismay the barbarian host in full march towards their  city.  In six days it was calculated Xerxes would be at Athens--a short  space to remove the population of a whole city:  but fear and necessity  work wonders. Before the six days had elapsed, all who were willing to  abandon their homes had been safely transported, some to AEgina, and  others to Troezen in Peloponnesus; but many could not be induced to  proceed farther than Salamis.  It was necessary for Themistocles to use  all his art and all his eloquence on this occasion.  The oracle at  Delphi had told the Athenians that \"the divine Salamis would make women  childless,\"--yet, \"when all was lost, a wooden wall should still  shelter the Athenians.\" Themistocles told his countrymen that these  words clearly indicated a fleet and a naval victory as the only means  of safety.  Some however gave to the words another meaning; and a few,  especially among the aged and the poor, resolved to shut themselves up  in the Acropolis, and to fortify its accessible or western front with  barricades of timber.    On his march towards Athens, Xerxes sent a detachment of his army to  take and plunder Delphi.  But this attempt proved unsuccessful.  The  god of the most renowned oracle of the Grecian world vindicated at once  the majesty of his sanctuary and the truth of his predictions.  As the  Persians climbed the rugged path at the foot of Mount Parnassus,  leading up to the shrine, thunder was heard to roll, and two crags,  suddenly detaching themselves from the mountain, rolled down upon the  Persians, and spread dismay and destruction in their ranks, Seized with  a sudden panic, they turned and fled, pursued, as they said, by two  warriors of superhuman size and prowess, who had assisted the Delphians  in defending their temple.    On arriving before Athens, Xerxes found the Acropolis occupied by a  handful of desperate citizens, who made a brave resistance; but they  were overpowered and put to the sword.  The temples and houses on the  Acropolis were pillaged and burnt; and Xerxes thus became undisputed  master of Athens.    About the same time the Persian fleet arrived in the bay of Phalerum.  Its strength is not accurately known, but it must have exceeded 1000  vessels.  The combined Grecian fleet at Salamis consisted of 366 ships,  of which 200 were Athenian.    At this critical juncture dissension reigned in the Grecian fleet.  In  the council of war which had been summoned by Eurybiades the Spartan  commander, Themistocles urged the assembled chiefs to remain at  Salamis, and give battle to the Persians in the narrow straits, where  the superior numbers of the Persians would be of less consequence.  The  Peloponnesian commanders, on the other hand, were anxious that the  fleet should be removed to the isthmus of Corinth, and thus be put in  communication with their land-forces.  The council came to a vote in  favour of retreat; but Themistocles prevailed upon Eurybiades to  convene another assembly upon the following day.  When the council met,  the Peloponnesian commanders loudly expressed their dissatisfaction at  seeing a debate re-opened which they had deemed concluded.  Adimantus,  the Corinthian admiral broke out into open rebukes and menaces.  \"Themistocles,\" he exclaimed, \"those who rise at the public games  before the signal are whipped.\"  \"True,\" replied Themistocles; \"but  they who lag behind it never win a crown.\"  Another incident in this  discussion has been immortalized by Plutarch.  Eurybiades, incensed by  the language of Themistocles, lifted up his stick to strike him,  whereupon the Athenian exclaimed, \"Strike, but hear me!\" Themistocles  repeated his arguments and entreaties; and at length threatened that he  and the Athenians would sail away to Italy and there found a new city,  if the Peloponnesians still determined to retreat.  Eurybiades now gave  way and issued orders for the fleet to remain and fight at Salamis; but  the Peloponnesians obeyed the order with reluctance.  A third council  was summoned and Themistocles, perceiving that the decision of the  assembly would be against him, determined to effect his object by  stratagem.  He secretly despatched a trusty slave with a message to  Xerxes, representing the dissensions which prevailed in the Grecian  fleet, and how easy a matter it would be to surround and vanquish an  armament both small and disunited.  Xerxes readily adopted the  suggestion, and ordered his captains to close up the straits of Salamis  at both ends during the night.  On the council assembling in the  morning, Aristides arrived with the news that the Grecian fleet was  completely surrounded by that of the Persians, and that retreat was no  longer possible.  As the veil of night rolled gradually away, the  Persian fleet was discovered stretching as far as the eye could reach  along the coast of Attica.  The Grecian fleet, being concentrated in  the harbour of Salamis, was thus surrounded by the Persians.  Xerxes  had caused a lofty throne to be erected upon one of the projecting  declivities of Mount AEgaleos, opposite the harbour of Salamis, whence  he could survey the combat, and stimulate by his presence the courage  of his men.    As a battle was now inevitable the Grecian commanders lost no time in  making preparations for the encounter.  The Greek seamen embarked with  alacrity, encouraging one another to deliver their country, their  wives, and children, and the temples of their gods, from the grasp of  the barbarians.  History has preserved to us but few details of the  engagement.  The Persian fleet, with the exception of some of the Ionic  contingents, fought with courage.  But the very numbers on which they  so confidently relied, proved one of the chief causes of their defeat.  Too crowded either to advance or to retreat, their oars broken or  impeded by collision with one another, their fleet lay like an inert  and lifeless mass upon the water, and fell an easy prey to the Greeks.  A single incident will illustrate the terror and confusion which  reigned among the Persians.

He was formerly a fellow  of Christ's Church College, Cambridge, and took a wrangler's degree in  1803. He subsequently became curate of Littlebury, and in 1814 of  Chesterford; this latter curacy he held until Dr. Bloomfield, the late  bishop of London, was presented to that living, when Mr. Davys became  curate of Swaffham Prior; he afterwards removed to Kensington, and was  appointed tutor to the Princess Victoria. Shortly after this he was  presented to the rectory of All-Hallows, London, and in 1831 to the  deanery of Chester, on which occasion he took the degree of doctor of  divinity. He discharged his episcopal duties for a period of about  twenty-five years in such a manner as to gain universal esteem; and  died at Peterborough, after a short illness, in the 84th year of his  age, on the 18th April, 1864.    The Rev. Dr. Francis Jeune, who was appointed to the Bishopric in the  room of Dr. Davys, was educated at Pembroke College, Oxford, were he  graduated in 1827, when he took a first-class in classics. In 1832 he  was admitted into Holy Orders by Dr. Bagot, Bishop of Oxford, being  then tutor of his College. In 1834 he was elected to the Head  Mastership of King Edward's School, Birmingham, and held that  appointment until 1838, when he was nominated to the Deanery of Jersey,  and the Rectory of St. Heliers. In 1843 he was elected to the  Mastership of Pembroke College, with a canonry at Gloucester annexed,  and almost immediately afterwards he was presented by the Dean and  Chapter of Gloucester to the Rectory of Taynton. In 1850 he was  appointed one of Her Majesty's Commissioners of Inquiry for the  University of Oxford, and in 1859 was elected Vice-Chancellor of the  University. About three months previous to his promotion to this  Bishopric, Dr. Jeune was made Dean of Lincoln, in the room of the Rev.  Thomas Garnier. Dr. Jeune lived only four years after his appointment  to the see. Suffering from an internal disease he went to Whitby for  change of air, where he died on the 21st of August, 1868, after a short  and painful illness, and was succeeded by the Rev. W. Connor Magee.    Bishop Magee was born at Cork in the year 1821, his father at that time  holding a cure in that city before being presented to the living of St.  Peter's, Drogheda, in 1829. His grandfather filled the Metropolitan see  of Dublin previous to Archbishop Whately. The future bishop of  Peterborough received his earliest education at Kilkenny, from which  place, at the age of thirteen, he was removed to Trinity College,  Dublin. Here he obtained a scholarship in 1838, and Archbishop King's  Divinity prize. He graduated A.B. in 1842, A.M. and B.D. in 1854, and  D.D. in 1860. In 1844 Mr. Magee received deacon's orders at the hands  of the Bishop of Chester, and in the following year was ordained priest  by the Bishop of Tuam. His first curacy was that of St. Thomas, Dublin,  which he was obliged to resign through ill health, and after a two  years' residence abroad he accepted a curacy at St. Saviour's, Bath, in  1848. Two years later he was appointed to the joint incumbency of the  Octagon Chapel, Bath. During his residence in Bath, Mr. Magee published  two volumes of sermons. In 1859 he was nominated an Hon. Canon of Wells  Cathedral, and received the degree of D.D. from his University; and on  the resignation of Dr. Goulburn, minister of Quebec Chapel, Portman  Square, London, Canon Magee was appointed to the vacant post. In 1860  he was transferred to the precentorship of Clogher in conjunction with  the rectory of Enniskillen; in 1864, on the death of Dr. Newman, he was  installed Dean of Cork; and in 1866 was appointed Dean of the Chapel  Royal, Dublin. He was enthroned as Bishop of Peterborough shortly after  the death of Bishop Jeune in 1868, receiving his appointment from the  Conservative Prime Minister, Mr. Disraeli.

John James Stewart  Perowne, D.D., was born about the year 1823, and married in 1862 Anna  Maria, third daughter of the late Humphry William Woolrych, Esq.,  Serjeant-at-Law, of Croxley, Hertfordshire. His family is of French  (Huguenot) extraction, which came over to this country at the  Revocation of the Edict of Nantes. He was appointed to the Deanery in  August, 1878. He was educated at Norwich Grammar School and at Corpus  Christi College, Cambridge, of which College he became a Fellow. He was  a Bell's University Scholar in 1842, took the Members' Prize for a  Latin Essay on three different occasions, viz., 1844, 1846, and 1847,  and graduated B.A. in 1845, in which year he was also Crosse Scholar,  and in 1848 he proceeded M.A. and was Tyrwhitt's Hebrew Scholar. Eight  years afterwards he took the degree of B.D., having in the meantime  been ordained deacon in 1847 and priest in the same year that he took  his master's degree. In 1855 he was appointed examining chaplain to the  Bishop of Norwich, and was made prebendary of S. Andrew's and canon of  Llandaff cathedral in 1869. In 1872 he became praelector in Theology of  Trinity College, Cambridge, and in 1873 took his degree of D.D., and  became Fellow of Trinity College. In 1875 Her Majesty was pleased to  graciously appoint him one of her hon. chaplains, and in the same year  he was appointed Hulsean Professor of Divinity. In 1851 and 1852 he was  examiner for the Classical Tripos at Cambridge, and select preacher  before the University on several different occasions. For 10 years he  held the vice-principalship of St. David's College, Lampeter, which  appointment he resigned in 1872. Before this, he had been Lecturer in  Divinity at King's College, London, and assistant preacher at Lincoln's  Inn. In 1868 he was Hulsean Lecturer, and Lady Margaret's Preacher in  1874-5.
