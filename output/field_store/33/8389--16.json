Meanwhile Cajus, in a grey monk's garb  looks for his bride everywhere until a tall veiled female in flowing  white robes (Bardolph) falls into his arms; on {78} the other side Anna  appears with Fenton.  Both couples are wedded, and only when they  unveil, the mistake is discovered.

FIDELIO.    Opera in two acts by L. van BEETHOVEN.      This opera, the only one by the greatest of German composers, is also  one of the most exquisite we possess.  The music is so grand and  sublime, so passionate and deep, that it enters into the heart of the  hearer.  The libretto is also full of the highest and most beautiful  feeling.    Florestan, a Spanish nobleman, has dared to blame Don Pizarro, the  governor of the state-prison, a man as cruel as he is powerful.  Pizarro has thus become Florestan's deadly foe, he has seized him  secretly and thrown him into a dreadful dungeon, reporting his death to  the Minister.    But this poor prisoner has a wife, Leonore, who is as courageous as she  is faithful.  She never believes in the false reports, but disguising  herself in male attire, resolves not to rest until she has found her  husband.    In this disguise we find her in the first act; she has contrived to get  entrance into the fortress {79} where she supposes her husband  imprisoned, and by her gentle and courteous behaviour, and readiness  for service of all kinds has won not only the heart of Rocco, the  jailer, but that of his daughter Marcelline, who falls in love with the  gentle youth and neglects her former lover Jaquino.  Fidelio persuades  Rocco to let her help him in his office with the prisoners.  Quivering  with mingled hope and fear she opens the prison gates, to let the state  prisoners out into the court, where they may for once have air and  sunshine.    But seek as she may, she cannot find her husband and in silent despair  she deems herself baffled.    Meanwhile Pizarro has received a letter from Sevilla, announcing the  Minister's forthcoming visit to the fortress.  Pizarro, frightened at  the consequences of such a call, resolves to silence Florestan for  ever.  He orders the jailer to kill him, but the old man will not  burden his soul with a murder and refuses firmly.  Then Pizarro himself  determines to kill Florestan, and summons Rocco to dig a grave in the  dungeon, in order to hide all traces of the crime.    Rocco, already looking upon the gentle and diligent Fidelio as his  future son-in-law, confides to him his dreadful secret, and with  fearful forebodings she entreats him to accept her help in the heavy  work.  Pizarro gives his permission, Rocco being too old and feeble to  do the work quickly enough if alone; Pizarro has been rendered furious  by the {80} indulgence granted to the prisoners at Fidelio's entreaty,  but a feeling of triumph overcomes every other, when he sees Rocco  depart for the dungeon with his assistant.    Here we find poor Florestan chained to a stone; he is wasted to a  skeleton as his food has been reduced in quantity week by week by the  cruel orders of his tormentor.  He is gradually losing his reason; he  has visions and in each one beholds his beloved wife.    When Leonore recognizes him, she well-nigh faints, but with a  supernatural effort of strength she rallies, and begins her work.  She  has a piece of bread with her, which she gives to the prisoner and with  it the remainder of Rocco's wine.  Rocco, mild at heart, pities his  victim sincerely, but he dares not act against the orders of his  superior, fearing to lose his position, or even his life.    While Leonore refreshes the sick man, Rocco gives a sign to Pizarro,  that the work is done, and bids Fidelio leave; but she only hides  herself behind a stone-pillar, waiting with deadly fear for the coming  event and decided to save her husband or to die with him.    Pizarro enters, secretly resolved to kill not only his foe, but also  both witnesses of his crime.  He will not kill Florestan however  without letting him know, who his assailant is.  So he loudly shouts  his own much-feared name, but while he raises his dagger, Leonore  throws herself between him and Florestan, shielding the latter with her  breast.  {81} Pizarro, stupefied like Florestan, loses his presence of  mind.  Leonore profits by it and presents a pistol at him, with which  she threatens his life, should he attempt another attack.  At this  critical moment the trumpets sound, announcing the arrival of the  Minister, and Pizarro, in impotent wrath is compelled to retreat.  They  are all summoned before the Minister, who is shocked at seeing his old  friend Florestan in this sad state, but not the less delighted with and  full of reverence for the noble courage of Leonore.    Pizarro is conducted away in chains, and the faithful wife with her own  hands removes the fetters, which still bind the husband for whom she  has just won freedom and happiness.    Marcelline, feeling inclined to be ashamed of her mistake, returns to  her simple and faithful lover Jaquino.          LA FIGLIA DEL REGGIMENTO.    Comic Opera in two acts by GAETANO DONIZETTI.    Text by ST. GEORGE and BAYARD.      This opera is one of the few of Donizetti's numerous works, which still  retain their attraction for the theatre-visitor, the others are his  Lucrezia Borgia and Lucia di Lammermoor.    The \"Daughter of the Regiment\" happily combines Italian richness of  melody with French \"esprit\" and French sallies, and hence the continued  charm of this almost international music.    The libretto can be accounted good.    {82}    The scene in the first act is laid near Bologna in the year 1815, the  second act in the castle of the Marchesa di Maggiorivoglio.    Mary, a vivandiere, has been found and educated by a French sergeant,  named Sulpice, and therefore belongs in a sense to his regiment, which  is on a campaign in Italy.  She is called the \"daughter\" of the  regiment, which has adopted her, and she has grown up, a bright and  merry girl, full of pluck and spirit, the pet and delight of the whole  regiment.    Tonio, a young Swiss, who has fallen in love with Mary, is believed by  the grenadiers to be a spy, and is about to be hanged.  But Mary,  knowing that he has only come to see her, tells them that he lately  saved her life, when she was in danger of falling over a precipice.  This changes everything and on his expressing a desire to become one of  them, the grenadiers suffer the Swiss to enlist into their company.  After the soldiers' departure he confesses his love to Mary, who  returns it heartily.  The soldiers agree to give their consent, when  the Marchesa di Maggiorivoglio appears, and by a letter once affixed to  the foundling Mary, addressed to a Marchesa of the same name and  carefully kept by Sulpice, it is proved that Mary is the Marchesa's  niece.  Of course this noble lady refuses her consent to a marriage  with the low-born Swiss and claims Mary from her guardian.  With tears  and laments Mary takes leave of her regiment and her lover, who at once  decides to follow her.  But he {83} has enlisted as soldier and is  forbidden to leave the ranks.  Sulpice and his whole regiment curse the  Marchesa, who thus carries away their joy.    In the second act Mary is in her aunt's castle.  She has masters of  every kind for her education in order to become a lady comme il faut,  but she cannot forget her freedom, and her dear soldiers, and instead  of singing solfeggios and cavatinas, she is caught warbling her  \"Rataplan\", to the Marchesa's grief and sorrow.  Nor can she cease to  think of Tonio, and only after a great struggle has she been induced to  promise her hand to a nobleman, when she suddenly hears the  well-beloved sound of drums and trumpets.  It is her own regiment with  Tonio as their leader, for he has been made an officer on account of  his courage and brave behaviour.  Hoping that his altered position may  turn the Marchesa's heart in his favor, he again asks for Mary, but his  suit is once more rejected.  Then he proposes flight, but the Marchesa  detecting his plan, reveals to Mary that she is not her niece, but her  own daughter, born in early wedlock with an officer far beneath her in  rank, who soon after died in battle.  This fact she has concealed from  her family, but as it is now evident that she has closer ties with  Mary, the poor girl dares not disobey her, and, though broken-hearted,  consents to renounce Tonio.    The Marchesa invites a large company of guests to celebrate her  daughter's betrothal to the son of a neighboring duchess.  But Mary's  faithful {84} grenadiers suddenly appear to rescue her from those  hateful ties, and astonish the whole company by their recital of Mary's  early history.  The obedient maiden however, submissive to her fate, is  about to sign the marriage contract, when at last the Marchesa, touched  by her obedience and her sufferings, conquers her own pride and  consents to the union of her daughter with Tonio.  Sulpice and his  soldiers burst out into loud shouts of approbation, and the highborn  guests retire silently and disgusted.          DER FLIEGENDE HOLLAeNDER.    (THE FLYING DUTCHMAN.)    Romantic Opera in three acts by WAGNER.      This fine opera is Wagner's second work, which he composed in direst  need, when living at Paris with his young wife.  The songs, which so  well imitate the hurricane and the howling of the ocean, he himself  heard during an awful storm at sea.  The whole opera is exceedingly  characteristic and impressive.

Vito bounding it  on the right.    This mountain, formerly world-renowned as Mount Eryx, and still often  called Monte Erice, is now Monte S. Giuliano and gives its name both to  the town on the top and to the comune of which that town is the chief  place.  The highest point of the town is towards the east of the  mountain-top, and here are several towers, some belonging to the  Castello, a Norman fortress, and others to Le Torri, the summer residence  of Count Pepoli.  On the north, east and south sides of the summit the  mountain is precipitous, but towards the west it slopes from the towers  through a public garden called the Balio, and then through a maze of  narrow, winding streets, down to the Trapani gate.  The normal population  of the town is about 4000, but in the summer and autumn this is largely  increased, inasmuch as the great heat of Trapani and the low country  drives as many as can afford it to live on the summit where it is seldom  too hot.    The rest of the comune lies dotted about on the plain at the foot of the  mountain and consists of a dozen small villages, all visible from the  summit.  These have mostly grown up within the last hundred years or so  as colonies from the chief town, for when the country was less secure the  women and children were left within the town walls while the men went  down to work in the fields and to fish in the sea, returning for Sundays  and festas, and gradually, as it became possible, settlements were formed  below to which the women and children could safely be moved.  Custonaci,  however, one of the villages of the comune, did not spring up in this way  and is of older date than the others.    The peculiar charm of the mountain cannot be fully realized unless one  visits it at all seasons and in all weathers.  I have been there in the  winter; the summit was hidden in a cloud which, as we drove up into it,  obscured the view and chilled the marrow.  It was before the days of the  motor, when a horse bus did the journey by a shorter route in about three  hours.  I was on the box with the coachman who gave me a spare cloak with  a hood to keep me dry and warm.  Two of my friends, natives of the  mountain, one a doctor and the other the accountant to the Municipio,  were at the Trapani gate to meet me, both in hooded cloaks, so that I did  not recognize them till they spoke.  The wind was tremendous.  The narrow  sloping streets were running with water as we walked up through the town  to the albergo, where Donna Anna received us.  There was no blazing fire  or warm room as there would have been in an English inn, only  semidarkness and dampness.  The damp had patched the painting on the  ceiling and disfigured the whitewashed walls, on which were hung a few  pictures--a lithograph of the Madonna di Custonaci, a cheap Crucifixion,  a reproduction of the design for the monument to Vittorio Emmanuele in  Rome, three shiny chromolithographs of English country scenes,  representing the four seasons minus one, an absurd French engraving,  _Education Maternelle_ and S. Francesco da Paola, with a shell for holy  water.  S. Francesco belongs to South Italy, but he is a favourite in  Sicily because he walked across the Straits of Messina to carry the Last  Sacraments to a dying man.  On the undulating tiled floor were a few of  the rugs peculiar to the neighbourhood.  They are made by the natives on  looms, the length being thin, strong string and the width white, black  and coloured cotton rags--old petticoats, shirts, aprons and so on,  washed clean and torn into narrow strips.  With a little ingenuity they  make the colours go in simple patterns, chiefly diamonds and zigzags; but  sometimes they are more daring and attempt drinking-cups, etc.: the most  effective are made by running the strips in rows without any regard to  pattern.    Some winds blow some clouds away, but the roots of this cloud were so  firmly wedged in among the narrow streets and through the cracks of the  doors and windows, which would not shut close, that this wind could do  nothing with it but blow it more deeply in and the house was full of mist  like the Albert Hall in a winter fog.  The natives consider it more  healthy to keep the same temperature indoors and out, so there is not a  house on the mountain with a fireplace, and only a few with stoves.  The  absence of chimneys is a feature of the town, as it is of other Sicilian  towns that can bear their absence better.  And these are the people who  commiserate an Englishman on being compelled to live in our cold, damp,  foggy island!  In support of my statement that we do occasionally see the  sun, I showed them a picture-postcard of a house in London standing in a  garden.  It was midday, but we had to have a lamp to see the picture;  nevertheless they supposed that the flowers were artificial and were  renewed when we had a festa because, of course, real flowers will not  grow in our perpetual fog.  I told them that our fogs prevent flowers  from growing in England just as much as their brigands prevent foreigners  from travelling in Sicily, and that both are more spoken of than seen.    It must, however, be admitted that the natives do not appear to suffer  from the effects of their climate.  They boast that statistics show them  to be particularly free from pulmonary complaints, and to have an  unusually low death rate.  As the doctor said, in a tone of professional  discontent, they enjoy an epidemic of good health.    Supper consisted of maccaroni, bread and wine, and the table-cloth and  napkins were as damp as one's towels after a bath.  My two friends sat  with me and introduced me to a student with a slight cast in one of his  melancholy eyes, a misty tenor voice and the facile Italian smile, who  had come up from Castelvetrano to study a little philosophy, and supped  with me.    When it was bedtime, they all three came with Donna Anna into my bedroom  to make sure that I was comfortable and the old landlady took the  opportunity of consulting the accountant about the prisoners.  Although  the inhabitants of the province of Trapani are all good people,  nevertheless now and then some slight crime is committed, an occasional  wounding, a simple stabbing or so, and consequently it is convenient to  have a prison handy.  Part of the castle on the mountain is used for the  purpose and Donna Anna provides the prisoners with their food and also  sees to their sheets, bedding etc.  They could not have a better matron  and if she keeps everything in the prison as clean and good as it is in  her house, I am afraid she may perhaps make the prisoners more  comfortable than they deserve.    When she had disposed of her business she asked whether I should like  some fire in my bed.  I was going to decline, not being in the habit of  using a warming-pan, but then I thought of the table-cloth and the  napkins at supper--and my friends said that every one on the mountain  always has fire in the bed in cold, damp weather--so I agreed, and Donna  Anna fetched what looked like a flower-pot containing hot charcoal.  She  put this between my sheets with a wicker cage over it, and presently  shifted its position.  I wanted her to leave it all night in a corner of  the room to take the chill off, but this met with opposition from all  because they did not wish me to be found in the morning asphyxiated in my  sleep like a Parisian milliner in a novel.  I would have chanced it, had  I been allowed, for the milliners always have the greatest difficulty in  stopping up all the chinks, and even then occasionally survive; whereas,  although Donna Anna pinned up a blanket across my window, it did not keep  out the gale that was raging all about the room.  The general opinion  being against the charcoal, I acquiesced and it was taken back to its  home in the kitchen.  It was the only fire in the house and was what  Dickens would have called an honest and stout little fire.  It had cooked  the maccaroni for supper and, after warming all the beds, went back to  rest from its labour until the morning when it would be called to make  the coffee for breakfast.  It deserved its rest, not that it dried my  sheets, but it warmed them; and the doctor assured me that it is the  coldness and not the dampness of wet sheets that gives one a chill, so he  considered me practically safe.  If only I had had a cold at the time, he  said, I should have been completely safe on the principle that one must  be off with the old cold before one can be on with the new.  Owing,  doubtless, to the kindly influence of the good little fire, I passed a  comfortable night and took no harm.    When I came down in the morning there was the student immersed in his  philosophy; the industrious little fire had obligingly allowed itself to  be coaxed into two, and he had secured part of it in a flower-pot on the  floor between his feet and had a rug over his knees.  The cloud was as  thick and the wind as boisterous as it had been the day before, so I  followed his example, got another flowerpot, split off a bit of fire for  myself and sat down with a rug.    The next morning the cloud had gone and I returned to Trapani.  The bus  started very early and I had to rise before the sun, but the view would  have repaid sitting up all night.  We saw Marettimo hovering over Levanzo  \"on the horizon all highest up in the sea to the West,\" as Ithaca is  described in the _Odyssey_.  We saw Ustica floating over Cofano and Capo  S. Vito.  We looked down on Custonaci, the Sanctuary of the Madonna and  the great curve of the bay from Cofano to the foot of the mountain.  We  gazed over the low, undulating country covered with villages, roads,  fields and villas that lay all around us on the inland sides--the country  through which in 1860 Garibaldi marched to Calatafimi with his"]]]
