A very interesting anecdote is given of a person who was travelling  through Holland, accompanied by a large Newfoundland dog. Walking one  evening on a high bank, by the side of a canal, his foot slipped; he  fell into the water, and being unable to swim, soon became senseless.  When he recovered his recollection, he found himself in a cottage, on  the opposite side of the canal, surrounded by peasants, who had been  using all means for restoring him to life. He was told, that one of them  returning home from his work, saw at a considerable distance, a large  dog swimming in the water, sometimes pushing, and sometimes dragging  something which he appeared to have great difficulty in supporting; but  which he at length succeeded in getting into a small creek. When there,  the animal pulled this object as far out of the water as he was able,  and the peasant discovered it to be the body of a man. The dog shook  himself, licked the hands and face of his master; the peasant obtained  assistance, and the body was conveyed to the house, where the  endeavours used for resuscitation proved successful. Two bruises, with  marks of teeth appeared, one on the shoulder, the other on the nape of  his neck, whence it was presumed, that his preserver first seized him by  the shoulder, but that his sagacity prompted him to shift his grasp to  the neck; as by so doing he could keep the head out of the water. He had  continued to do this for at least a quarter of a mile, and thus  preserved his owner, as much by his intelligence, as by his affection.    The Newfoundland dog, like many others, possesses a sense of time, and  Mr. Bell relates an instance of this, which occurred under his own  observation. He says, that a fine Newfoundland dog, which was kept at an  inn in Dorsetshire, was accustomed every morning as the clock struck  eight, to take in his mouth a certain basket, placed for the purpose,  containing a few pence, and to carry it across the street to a baker's,  who took out the money, and replaced it by the proper number of rolls.  With these Neptune hastened back to the kitchen, and safely deposited  his trust; but what was well worthy of remark, he never attempted to  take the basket, or even to approach it on Sunday mornings. On one  occasion, when returning with the rolls, another dog made an attack upon  the basket, for the purpose of stealing its contents; when the trusty  Neptune placed the basket on the ground, severely punished the  intruder, and then bore off his charge in triumph.    The proofs of intelligence which I have related, are perhaps surpassed  by those of Dandie, a Newfoundland dog belonging to Mr. M'Intyre of  Edinburgh; but it must be recollected, that Dandie's education had been  more carefully and continuously carried on, than that of his before  mentioned brethren. He selected his master's hat from a number of  others, or a card chosen by his master from a whole pack; picked his  master's penknife from a heap of others, and any particular article  which he might have been told to find, although he would have to search  among a multitude of others belonging to the same person; proving that  it was not smell which guided him, but an understanding of what he was  required to do. One evening, a gentleman in company with others,  accidentally dropped a shilling on the floor, which, after diligent  search, could not be found. Dandie had been sitting in the corner of the  room, apparently unconscious of what had been going on, Mr. M'Intyre  then said to him. \"Find us the shilling, Dandie, and you shall have a  biscuit,\" the dog instantly jumped up, and laid the shilling upon the  table, which he had picked up unperceived by the party. On his return  home one evening after the family had gone to rest, Mr. M'Intyre could  not find his boot-jack; upon which he said, \"Dandie, I cannot find my  boot-jack; search for it.\" The dog scratched at the room-door, his  master opened it, and going to a distant part of the house Dandie  returned with the boot-jack in his mouth; where Mr. M'Intyre recollected  to have left it under a sofa.    Several gentlemen were in the habit of giving Dandie a penny a day,  which he always took to a baker's, and exchanged for bread for himself.  One of them was accosted by the dog for his accustomed present; but he  said, \"I have not a penny with me to-day, though I have one at home.\"  Having returned to his house, some time after he heard a noise at the  door; it was opened, and Dandie sprang in for his penny. By way of  frolic, the gentleman gave him a bad one; the baker refused to exchange  the loaf for it; the dog returned to the door, knocked, and when the  servant opened it, laid the penny at her feet, and walked away with an  air of contempt. He did not, however, always spend all his money, and  one Sunday, when it was very unlikely that he could have received a  present, he was observed to bring home a loaf. Surprised at this, Mr.  M'Intyre desired the servant to search the room for money. Dandie seemed  quite unconcerned till she approached the bed, when he gently drew her  from it. Mr. M'Intyre secured him, for he growled and struggled; and,  continuing the search, the woman found seven pence halfpenny under a  piece of cloth. From that time the dog could not endure her, and  henceforth hid his money in the corner of a sawpit, under a heap of  dust. He constantly escorted Mr. M'Intyre's friends home, when desired  to do so, however considerable the distance, and when they were safe, he  returned to his own quarters.    Mr. Jukes, in his \"Excursions in and about Newfoundland,\" speaks of a  dog which appeared to be of the pure breed, and which he thought to be  more intelligent than the mixed race. This animal caught his own fish,  for which purpose he sat on a projecting rock, beneath a fish stage, on  which the fish were laid to dry, watching the water, the depth being  from six to eight feet, and the bottom quite white with fish-bones. On  throwing a piece of codfish into the water, three or four heavy,  clumsy-looking fish, called in Newfoundland _sculpins_, would swim in to  catch it. The instant one turned its broadside towards him, he darted  down, and seldom came up without the fish in his mouth. He regularly  carried them as he caught them to a place a few yards off, where he  deposited them, sometimes making a pile of fifty or sixty in the day. As  he never attempted to eat them, he appeared to fish for his amusement.    Long, lanky, rough-haired, with drooping, bushy tail; long ears, half  erect; long, sharp muzzle; black and fulvous in colour, often mingled  with brown and white, the Shepherd's Dog yields to none in fidelity and  sagacity. In his own peculiar calling, nothing can exceed his  vigilance, his quick comprehension, and his intimate knowledge of every  individual entrusted to his care. Rushing into the middle of his flock,  he singles out any one member of it, and brings it to his master. Fierce  in the defence of all, he keeps them together by incessantly prowling  round them, dragging the wanderers back to their companions, and  fiercely attacking those who would offer them an injury. At night he  guides them to their fold; and if this should be in an exposed  situation, he throws himself across the entrance, so that the intruding  enemy will have to pass over his body to commence his work of  destruction.    A ludicrous instance of the promptitude with which he punishes  offenders, is related by Colonel Smith, in the following manner:--\"We  have witnessed the care they take of their charge, and with what  readiness they chastise those that molest them, in the case of a cur  biting a sheep in the rear of the flock, and unseen by the shepherd.  This assault was committed by a tailor's dog, but not unmarked by the  other, who immediately seized him, and dragging the delinquent into a  puddle, while holding his ear, kept dabbling him in the mud with  exemplary gravity; the cur yelled, the tailor came slipshod with his  goose to the rescue, and having flung it at the sheep-dog, and missed  him, stood by gaping, not venturing to fetch it back until the  castigation was over and the dog had followed the flock.\"    [Illustration: THE SHEPHERD'S DOG AND CUR.--Page 102.]    As a proof of the comprehension of the shepherd's dog, I quote the  description of Mr. St. John, in his \"Highland Sports:\"--\"A shepherd  once, to prove the quickness of his dog, who was lying before the fire  in the house where we were talking, said to me, in the middle of a  sentence concerning something else, 'I'm thinking, Sir, the cow is in  the potatoes.' Though he purposely laid no stress on these words, and  said them in a quiet, unconcerned tone of voice, the dog, who appeared  to be asleep, immediately jumped up, and leaping through the open  window, scrambled up the turf roof of the house, from which he could see  the potato field. He then (not seeing the cow there) ran and looked into  the byre [farm-yard], where she was, and finding that all was right,  came back to the house. After a short time the shepherd said the same  words again, and the dog repeated his look-out; but on the false alarm  being a third time given, the dog got up, and wagging his tail, looked  his master in the face with so comical an expression of interrogation,  that we could not help laughing aloud at him, on which, with a slight  growl, he laid himself down in his warm corner, with an offended air, as  if determined not to be made a fool of again.\"    Mr. Hogg, the Ettrick shepherd, is the person of all others to give an  adequate idea of the shepherd's dog, and I use very nearly his own  words. \"My dog Sirrah, was beyond all comparison the best dog I ever  saw; he was of a surly, unsocial temper;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21986"],[0,"The Dash for Khartoum: A Tale of the Nile Expedition (#15)"],[1,"Rupert's  feelings, but his kindness had said more than words could do; and  Rupert, as he looked back, felt ashamed at the thought that he had often  joined in a laugh about him.    At home the points that had seemed peculiar at school were unnoticeable.  The scrupulous attention to dress that had there been in strong contrast  to the general carelessness of the others in that respect, seemed but  natural in his own house, where there were a good many guests staying.  Rupert and Edgar had always been more particular at home than at school;  but Easton was the same, indeed Rupert thought that he was if anything  less particular now than he had been at River-Smith's.    A week after Christmas Rupert received a letter from his father, written  at Nice, saying that a letter from Edgar had been forwarded on from  home, and giving the brief words in which the lad said that he was well,  and that they might be under no uneasiness respecting him. \"This does  not tell us much,\" Captain Clinton went on, \"but we are very pleased,  inasmuch as it seems that Edgar does not mean altogether to drop out of  our sight, but will, we hope, write from time to time to let us know  that at any rate he is well. The letter has the London post-mark, but of  course that shows nothing; it may have been written anywhere and sent to  anyone--perhaps to a waiter at an hotel at which he stopped in London,  and with whom he had arranged to post any letters that he might inclose  to him. The letter has greatly cheered your mother, who, in spite of all  I could say, has hitherto had a dread that Edgar in his distress might  have done something rash. I have never thought so for an instant. I  trust that my two boys are not only too well principled, but too brave  to act a coward's part, whatever might befall them. Your mother, of  course, agreed with me in theory; but while she admitted that Edgar  would never if in his senses do such a thing, urged that his distress  might be so great that he would not be responsible for what he was  doing. Happily this morbid idea has been dissipated by the arrival of  the letter, and I have great hopes now that she will rouse herself, and  will shake off the state of silent brooding which has been causing me so  much anxiety. It was but this morning that we received the letter, and  already she looks brighter and more like herself than she has done since  you brought us the news of Edgar's disappearance.\"    This news enabled Rupert to enjoy the remainder of the holidays much  more than he had done the first fortnight. He and Edgar had both been  accustomed to ride since they had been children, and had in their  Christmas holidays for years accompanied their father to the hunting  field, at first upon ponies, but the previous winter on two light-weight  carrying horses he had bought specially for them. Mr. Easton had several  hunters, and Rupert, who was well mounted, thoroughly enjoyed the  hunting, and returned to school with his nerves braced up, ready for  work.    \"I won't say anything against Easton again,\" Skinner said when he heard  from Rupert how pleasant his holidays had been made for him. \"I noticed  how he took to you and made things smooth for you the last ten days of  the term, and I fully meant to tell him that I was sorry I had not  understood him better before; only, in the first place, I never happened  to have a good opportunity, and in the second place I don't know that I  ever tried to make one. However, I shall tell him now. It is not a  pleasant thing to be obliged to own that you have behaved badly, but it  is a good deal more unpleasant to feel it and not have the pluck to say  so.\"    Accordingly the next time Easton came into the senior study, Skinner  went up to him and said:    \"Easton, I want to tell you that I am uncommonly sorry that I have set  myself against you because you have been more particular about your  dress and things than the rest of us, and because you did not seem as  keen as we were about football and things. I know that I have behaved  like an ass, and I should like to be friends now if you will let me.\"    \"Certainly I will, Skinner,\" Easton said, taking the hand he held out.  \"I don't know that it was altogether your fault. My people at home are  rather particular about our being tidy and that sort of thing, and when  I came here and some of you rather made fun of me about it, I think that  I stuck to it all the more because it annoyed you. I shall be going up  for Sandhurst this term, and I am very glad to be on good terms with all  you fellows before I leave; so don't let us say anything more about it.\"    And with another shake of the hands their agreement to be friends was  ratified.    The term between Christmas and Easter was always the dullest of the  year. The house matches at football were over. Although a game was  sometimes played, there was but a languid interest in it. Paper-chases  were the leading incident in the term, and there was a general looking  forward to spring weather, when cricket could begin and the teams  commence practice for the matches of the following term.    Easton was going up in the summer for the examination for the line. He  was not troubling himself specially about it; and indeed his getting in  was regarded as a certainty, for Mr. Southley had said that he would be  safe for the Indian Civil if he chose to try, and considered it a great  pity that he was going up for so comparatively an easy competition as  that for the line. He occasionally went for a walk with Rupert, and  while chatting with him frequently about Edgar, was continually urging  him not to let his thoughts dwell too much upon it, but to stick to his  work.    The watch at the various ports had long since been given up, for had  Edgar intended to emigrate he would certainly have done so very shortly  after his arrival in London, as his means would not have permitted him  to make any stay there.    \"I think it is very thoughtful of Edgar,\" Easton said one day when  Rupert told him that he had heard from his father that another letter  had arrived. \"So many fellows when they run away or emigrate, or  anything of that sort, drop writing altogether, and do not seem to give  a thought to the anxiety those at home are feeling for them. He is  evidently determined that he will go his own way and accept no help from  your people, and under the circumstances I can quite enter into his  feelings; but, you see, he does not wish them to be anxious or troubled  about him, and I don't think there is anything for you to worry about,  Clinton. He may be having a hardish time of it; still he is no doubt  getting his living somehow or other, and I don't know that it will do  him any harm.    \"I think he is the sort of fellow to make his way in whatever line he  takes up, and though what he has learnt here may not be of much use to  him at the start, his having had a good education is sure to be of  advantage to him afterwards. A fellow who could hold his own in a tussle  such as we had with the Greenites last term can be trusted to make a  good fight in anything. At any rate it is of no use your worrying  yourself about him. You see, you will be going up in a year's time for  your examination for the line, and you will have to stick to it pretty  steadily if you are to get through at the first trial. It won't help  matters your worrying about him, and wherever he is and whatever he is  doing he is sure to keep his eye on the lists, and he will feel just as  much pleasure in seeing your name there as he would have done if he had  been here with you. So I should say, work steadily and play steadily.  You have a good chance of being in the college boat next term; that and  shooting will give you enough to do.    \"It is no use sticking to it too hard. I was telling Skinner yesterday  he will regularly addle his brain if he keeps on grinding as he is doing  now. But it is of no use talking to Skinner; when his mind is set on a  thing he can think of nothing else. Last term it was football, now it is  reading. It must be an awful nuisance to be as energetic as he is. I  cannot see why he should not take life comfortably.\"    \"He would say,\" Rupert laughed, \"he cannot see why he should do things  by fits and starts as you do, Easton.\"    \"Ah! but I do not do it on principle,\" Easton argued. \"I am all for  taking it quietly, only sometimes one gets stirred up and has to throw  one's self into a thing. One does it, you know, but one feels it a  nuisance--an unfair wear and tear of the system.\"    \"Your system does not seem to suffer seriously, Easton.\"    \"No; but it might if one were called upon to do these things often. But  it is time for us to turn back, or we shall be late for tea.\"          CHAPTER V.    ENLISTED.      Edgar had found but little difficulty in getting out from the house. He  had timed himself so as to arrive at the station just before the train  left for Gloucester, and taking his ticket, had slipped into an empty  carriage. At Gloucester there was half an hour to wait before the  up-train came in. This time he got into a carriage with several other  people. He did not want to spend the night thinking, and as long as his  fellow-passengers talked he resolutely kept his attention fixed on what  they were saying. Then when one after the other composed themselves for  a sleep, he sat with his eyes closed, thinking over his school-days. He  had already, while he lay tossing on his bed, thought over the  revelation he had heard from every point of view. He had exhausted the  subject, and would not allow his thoughts to return to it.    He now fought the football match of the Greenites over again in fancy.  It seemed to him that it was an event that had taken place a long time  back, quite in the dim distance, and he was wondering vaguely over this  when he too fell asleep, and did not wake up until the train arrived at  Paddington. It was with a feeling of"]]]
