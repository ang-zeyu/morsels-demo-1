For the purposes of everyday life the telephone is even more useful than  the telegraph. Telephones now connect one room of a building with  another, house with house, town with town, country with country. An  infinitely greater number of words pass over the telephonic circuits of  the world in a year than are transmitted by telegraph operators. The  telephone has become an important adjunct to the transaction of business  of all sorts. Its wires penetrate everywhere. Without moving from his  desk, the London citizen may hold easy converse with a Parisian, a New  Yorker with a dweller in Chicago.    Wonderful as the transmission of signals over great distances is, the  transmission of human speech so clearly that individual voices may be  distinguished hundreds of miles away is even more so. Yet the instrument  which works the miracle is essentially simple in its principles.      THE BELL TELEPHONE.    [Illustration: FIG. 62.--Section of a Bell telephone.]    The first telephone that came into general use was that of Bell, shown  in Fig. 62. In a central hole of an ebonite casing is fixed a permanent  magnet, M. The casing expands at one end to accommodate a coil of  insulated wire wound about one extremity of a magnet. The coil ends are  attached to wires passing through small channels to terminals at the  rear. A circular diaphragm, D, of very thin iron plate, clamped between  the concave mouthpiece and the casing, almost touches the end of the  magnet.    We will suppose that two Bell telephones, A and B, are connected up by  wires, so that the wires and the coils form a complete circuit. Words  are spoken into A. The air vibrations, passing through the central hole  in the cover, make the diaphragm vibrate towards and away from the  magnet. The distances through which the diaphragm moves have been  measured, and found not to exceed in some cases more than 1/10,000,000  of an inch! Its movements distort the shape of the \"lines of force\" (see  p. 118) emanating from the magnet, and these, cutting through the turns  of the coil, induce a current in the line circuit. As the diaphragm  approaches the magnet a circuit is sent in one direction; as it leaves  it, in the other. Consequently speech produces rapidly alternating  currents in the circuit, their duration and intensity depending on the  nature of the sound.    Now consider telephone B. The currents passing through its coil increase  or diminish the magnetism of the magnet, and cause it to attract its  diaphragm with varying force. The vibration of the diaphragm disturbs  the air in exact accordance with the vibrations of A's diaphragm, and  speech is reproduced.      THE EDISON TRANSMITTER.    The Bell telephone may be used both as a transmitter and a receiver, and  the permanent magnetism of the cores renders it independent of an  electric battery. But currents generated by it are so minute that they  cannot overcome the resistance of a long circuit; therefore a battery is  now always used, and with it a special device as transmitter.    If in a circuit containing a telephone and a battery there be a loose  contact, and this be shaken, the varying resistance of the contact will  cause electrical currents of varying force to pass through the circuit.  Edison introduced the first successful _microphone_ transmitter, in  which a small platinum disc connected to the diaphragm pressed with  varying force against a disc of carbon, each disc forming part of the  circuit. Vibrations of the diaphragm caused current to flow in a series  of rapid pulsations.    [Illustration: FIG. 63.--Section of a granular carbon transmitter.]      THE GRANULAR CARBON TRANSMITTER.    In Fig. 63 we have a section of a microphone transmitter now very widely  used. It was invented, in its original form, by an English clergyman  named Hunnings. Resting in a central cavity of an ebonite seating is a  carbon block, C, with a face moulded into a number of pyramidal  projections, P P. The space between C and a carbon diaphragm, D, is  packed with carbon granules, G G. C has direct contact with line  terminal T, which screws into it; D with T^1 through the brass casing,  screw S, and a small plate at the back of the transmitter. Voice  vibrations compress G G, and allow current to pass more freely from D  to C. This form of microphone is very delicate, and unequalled for  long-distance transmission.    [Illustration: FIG. 64.--A diagrammatic representation of a telephonic  circuit.]      GENERAL ARRANGEMENT OF A TELEPHONE CIRCUIT.    In many forms of subscriber's instruments both receiver and transmitter  are mounted on a single handle in such a way as to be conveniently  placed for ear and mouth. For the sake of clearness the diagrammatic  sketch of a complete installation (Fig. 64) shows them separated. The  transmitters, it will be noticed, are located in battery circuits,  including the primary windings P P_2 of induction coils. The  transmitters are in the line circuit, which includes the secondary  windings S S_2 of the coils.    We will assume that the transmitters are, in the first instance, both  hung on the hooks of the metallic switches, which their weight depresses  to the position indicated by the dotted lines. The handle of the  magneto-generator at the left-end station is turned, and current passes  through the closed circuit:--Line A, E B_2, contact 10, the switch 9;  line B, 4, the other switch, contact 5, and E B. Both bells ring. Both  parties now lift their receivers from the switch hooks. The switches  rise against contacts 1, 2, 3 and 6, 7, 8 respectively. Both primary and  both secondary circuits are now completed, while the bells are  disconnected from the line wires. The pulsations set up by transmitter T  in primary coil P are magnified by secondary coil S for transmission  through the line circuit, and affect both receivers. The same thing  happens when T_2 is used. At the end of the conversation the receivers  are hung on their hooks again, and the bell circuit is remade, ready for  the next call.    [Illustration: A TELEPHONE EXCHANGE.]      DOUBLE-LINE CIRCUITS.    The currents used in telephones pulsate very rapidly, but are very  feeble. Electric disturbances caused by the proximity of telegraph or  tram wires would much interfere with them if the earth were used for the  return circuit. It has been found that a complete metallic circuit (two  wires) is practically free from interference, though where a number of  wires are hung on the same poles, speech-sounds may be faintly induced  in one circuit from another. This defect is, however, minimized by  crossing the wires about among themselves, so that any one line does not  pass round the corresponding insulator on every pole.      TELEPHONE EXCHANGES.    In a district where a number of telephones are used the subscribers are  put into connection with one another through an \"exchange,\" to which all  the wires lead. One wire of each subscriber runs to a common \"earth;\"  the other terminates at a switchboard presided over by an operator. In  an exchange used by many subscribers the terminals are distributed over  a number of switchboards, each containing 80 to 100 terminals, and  attended to by an operator, usually a girl.    When a subscriber wishes to be connected to another subscriber, he  either turns the handle of a magneto generator, which causes a shutter  to fall and expose his number at the exchange, or simply depresses a key  which works a relay at the exchange and lights a tiny electric lamp. The  operator, seeing the signal, connects her telephone with the  subscriber's circuit and asks the number wanted. This given, she rings  up the other subscriber, and connects the two circuits by means of an  insulated wire cord having a spike at each end to fit the \"jack\" sockets  of the switchboard terminals. The two subscribers are now in  communication.    [Illustration: FIG. 65.--The headdress of an operator at a telephone  exchange. The receiver is fastened over one ear, and the transmitter to  the chest.]    If a number on switchboard A calls for a number on switchboard C, the  operator at A connects her subscriber by a jack cord to a trunk line  running to C, where the operator similarly connects the trunk line with  the number asked for, after ringing up the subscriber. The central  exchange of one town is connected with that of another by one or more  trunk lines, so that a subscriber may speak through an indefinite number  of exchanges. So perfect is the modern telephone that the writer  remembers on one occasion hearing the door-bell ring in a house more  than a hundred miles away, with which he was at the moment in telephonic  connection, though three exchanges were in the circuit.      SUBMARINE TELEPHONY.    Though telegraphic messages are transmitted easily through thousands of  miles of cable,[16] submarine telephony is at present restricted to  comparatively short distances. When a current passes through a cable,  electricity of opposite polarity induced on the outside of the cable  damps the vibration in the conductor. In the Atlantic cable, strong  currents of electricity are poured periodically into one end, and though  much enfeebled when they reach the other they are sufficiently strong to  work a very delicate \"mirror galvanometer\" (invented by Lord Kelvin),  which moves a reflected ray up and down a screen, the direction of the  movements indicating a dot or a dash. Reversible currents are used in  transmarine telegraphy. The galvanometer is affected like the coils and  small magnet in Wheatstone's needle instrument (p. 128).    Telephonic currents are too feeble to penetrate many miles of cable.  There is telephonic communication between England and France, and  England and Ireland. But transatlantic telephony is still a thing of the  future. It is hoped, however, that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28570"],[0,"Astronomy of To-day: A Popular Introduction in Non-Technical Language (#15)"],[1,"known to us as the planets, the individual stars in the heaven  remained apparently fixed with reference to each other. These seemingly  changeless points of light came in time to be regarded as sign-posts to  guide the wanderer across the trackless desert, or the voyager upon the  wide sea.    Just as when looking into the red coals of a fire, or when watching the  clouds, our imagination conjures up strange and grotesque forms, so did  the men of old see in the grouping of the stars the outlines of weird  and curious shapes. Fed with mythological lore, they imagined these to  be rough representations of ancient heroes and fabled beasts, whom they  supposed to have been elevated to the heavens as a reward for great  deeds done upon the earth. We know these groupings of stars to-day under  the name of the Constellations. Looking up at them we find it extremely  difficult to fit in the majority with the figures which the ancients  believed them to represent. Nevertheless, astronomy has accepted the  arrangement, for want of a better method of fixing the leading stars in  the memory.    Our early ancestors lived the greater part of their lives in the open  air, and so came to pay more attention in general to the heavenly orbs  than we do. Their clock and their calendar was, so to speak, in the  celestial vault. They regulated their hours, their days, and their  nights by the changing positions of the sun, the moon, and the stars;  and recognised the periods of seed-time and harvest, of calm and stormy  weather, by the rising or setting of certain well-known constellations.  Students of the classics will recall many allusions to this, especially  in the Odes of Horace.    As time went on and civilisation progressed, men soon devised measuring  instruments, by means of which they could note the positions of the  celestial bodies in the sky with respect to each other; and, from  observations thus made, they constructed charts of the stars. The  earliest complete survey of this kind, of which we have a record, is the  great Catalogue of stars which was made, in the second century B.C., by  the celebrated Greek astronomer, Hipparchus, and in which he is said to  have noted down about 1080 stars.    It is unnecessary to follow in detail the tedious progress of  astronomical discovery prior to the advent of the telescope. Certain it  is that, as time went on, the measuring instruments to which we have  alluded had become greatly improved; but, had they even been perfect,  they would have been utterly inadequate to reveal those minute  displacements, from which we have learned the actual distance of the  nearest of the celestial orbs. From the early times, therefore, until  the mediaeval period of our own era, astronomy grew up upon a faulty  basis, for the earth ever seemed so much the largest body in the  universe, that it continued from century to century to be regarded as  the very centre of things.    To the Arabians is due the credit of having kept alive the study of the  stars during the dark ages of European history. They erected some fine  observatories, notably in Spain and in the neighbourhood of Bagdad.  Following them, some of the Oriental peoples embraced the science in  earnest; Ulugh Beigh, grandson of the famous Tamerlane, founding, for  instance, a great observatory at Samarcand in Central Asia. The Mongol  emperors of India also established large astronomical instruments in the  chief cities of their empire. When the revival of learning took place in  the West, the Europeans came to the front once more in science, and  rapidly forged ahead of those who had so assiduously kept alight the  lamp of knowledge through the long centuries.    The dethronement of the older theories by the Copernican system, in  which the earth was relegated to its true place, was fortunately soon  followed by an invention of immense import, the invention of the  Telescope. It is to this instrument, indeed, that we are indebted for  our knowledge of the actual scale of the celestial distances. It  penetrated the depths of space; it brought the distant orbs so near,  that men could note the detail on the planets, or measure the small  changes in their positions in the sky which resulted from the movement  of our own globe.    It was in the year 1609 that the telescope was first constructed. A  year or so previous to this a spectacle-maker of Middleburgh in Holland,  one Hans Lippershey, had, it appears, hit upon the fact that distant  objects, when viewed through certain glass lenses suitably arranged,  looked nearer.[8] News of this discovery reached the ears of Galileo  Galilei, of Florence, the foremost philosopher of the day, and he at  once applied his great scientific attainments to the construction of an  instrument based upon this principle. The result was what was called an  \"optick tube,\" which magnified distant objects some few times. It was  not much larger than what we nowadays contemptuously refer to as a  \"spy-glass,\" yet its employment upon the leading celestial objects  instantly sent astronomical science onward with a bound. In rapid  succession Galileo announced world-moving discoveries; large spots upon  the face of the sun; crater-like mountains upon the moon; four  subordinate bodies, or satellites, circling around the planet Jupiter;  and a strange appearance in connection with Saturn, which later  telescopic observers found to be a broad flat ring encircling that  planet. And more important still, the magnified image of Venus showed  itself in the telescope at certain periods in crescent and other forms;  a result which Copernicus is said to have announced should of necessity  follow if his system were the true one.    The discoveries made with the telescope produced, as time went on, a  great alteration in the notions of men with regard to the universe at  large. It must have been, indeed, a revelation to find that those points  of light which they called the planets, were, after all, globes of a  size comparable with the earth, and peopled perchance with sentient  beings. Even to us, who have been accustomed since our early youth to  such an idea, it still requires a certain stretch of imagination to  enlarge, say, the Bright Star of Eve, into a body similar in size to our  earth. The reader will perhaps recollect Tennyson's allusion to this in  _Locksley Hall, Sixty Years After_:--    \"Hesper--Venus--were we native to that splendour or in Mars,  We should see the Globe we groan in, fairest of their evening stars.    \"Could we dream of wars and carnage, craft and madness, lust and spite,  Roaring London, raving Paris, in that point of peaceful light?\"    The form of instrument as devised by Galileo is called the Refracting  Telescope, or \"Refractor.\" As we know it to-day it is the same in  principle as his \"optick tube,\" but it is not quite the same in  construction. The early _object-glass_, or large glass at the end, was a  single convex lens (see Fig. 8, p. 113, \"Galilean\"); the modern one is,  on the other hand, composed of two lenses fitted together. The attempts  to construct large telescopes of the Galilean type met in course of time  with a great difficulty. The magnified image of the object observed was  not quite pure; its edges, indeed, were fringed with rainbow-like  colours. This defect was found to be aggravated with increase in the  size of object-glasses. A method was, however, discovered of  diminishing this colouration, or _chromatic aberration_ as it is called  from the Greek word [chroma] (_chroma_), which means colour, viz. by  making telescopes of great length and only a few inches in width. But  the remedy was, in a way, worse than the disease; for telescopes thus  became of such huge proportions as to be too unwieldy for use. Attempts  were made to evade this unwieldiness by constructing them with skeleton  tubes (see Plate II., p. 110), or, indeed, even without tubes at all;  the object-glass in the tubeless or \"aerial\" telescope being fixed at  the top of a high post, and the _eye-piece_, that small lens or  combination of lenses, which the eye looks directly into, being kept in  line with it by means of a string and manoeuvred about near the ground  (Plate III., p. 112). The idea of a telescope without a tube may appear  a contradiction in terms; but it is not really so, for the tube adds  nothing to the magnifying power of the instrument, and is, in fact, no  more than a mere device for keeping the object-glass and eye-piece in a  straight line, and for preventing the observer from being hindered by  stray lights in his neighbourhood. It goes without saying, of course,  that the image of a celestial object will be more clear and defined when  examined in the darkness of a tube.    The ancients, though they knew nothing of telescopes, had, however,  found out the merit of a tube in this respect; for they employed simple  tubes, blackened on the inside, in order to obtain a clearer view of  distant objects. It is said that Julius Caesar, before crossing the  Channel, surveyed the opposite coast of Britain through a tube of this  kind.    [Illustration: PLATE II. GREAT TELESCOPE OF HEVELIUS    This instrument, 150 feet in length, with a _skeleton_ tube, was  constructed by the celebrated seventeenth century astronomer, Hevelius  of Danzig. From an illustration in the _Machina Celestis_.    (Page 110)]    A few of the most famous of the immensely long telescopes above alluded  to are worthy of mention. One of these, 123 feet in length, was  presented to the Royal Society of London by the Dutch astronomer  Huyghens. Hevelius of Danzig constructed a skeleton one of 150 feet in  length (see Plate II., p. 110). Bradley used a tubeless one 212 feet  long to measure the diameter of Venus in 1722; while one of 600 feet is  said to have been constructed, but to have proved quite unworkable!    Such difficulties, however, produced their natural result. They set men  at work to"]]]
