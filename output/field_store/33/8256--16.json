Not that he  looked dangerous.  He had a strange look--half of baffled rage and half  of shame--which was quite new to me, and I waited anxiously to discover  what he meant.    As his eye met mine, however, he seemed to recover himself and to make  up his mind.    \"Batchelor,\" said he, \"get the screwdriver.\"    \"What are you going to do?\" asked some one.  \"Are you going to lock  Hawkesbury out?\"    \"No,\" said Smith, quietly; \"but I'm going to let out the others.\"    \"What!\" cried the fellows at this astounding announcement: \"without  waiting for their answer?  We shall all get expelled!\"    \"No, you won't!\" said Smith, doggedly, and rather scornfully.    \"You don't mean to say you're going to show the white feather?\" said  Rathbone.    \"I mean to say I'm going to let them out.\"    \"Yes, and get all the credit of it, and leave us to get into the row,\"  said Philpot.    Smith turned round short on the speaker and held out the screwdriver.  \"Here,\" said he, \"if you want the credit, go and do it yourself!\"    Of course, Philpot declined the tempting offer, and, without another  word, Smith walked up to the passage and began pulling away the desks  from the parlour door.    Flanagan and one or two of us, sorely perplexed, helped him; the others  stood aloof and grumbled or sneered.    The two masters within heard the noise, but neither of them spoke.    At last all was clear, and Smith said, \"Now then, you'd better go, you  fellows!\"    We obeyed him, though reluctantly.  Our curiosity as well as our anxiety  prompted us to stay.  We retired to the end of the passage, where from a  distant door we nervously watched Smith turn the key and draw out first  one screw then the other from the door that divided him and us from our  masters.    At last we saw it open.  Smith walked into the room and shut the door  behind him.  What happened inside we never exactly knew.  After half an  hour, which seemed to us as long as a day, the three emerged, and walked  straight down the passage and up the stairs that led to Miss Henniker's  room.  Smith, with the screwdriver, walked in the middle, very solemn  and very pale.    Stealthily we crawled up after them, and hid where we could observe what  was to follow.    Mr Ladislaw knocked at the Henniker's door.    \"Well?\" said a voice within.    The word was mildly spoken, and very unlike the snap to which we had  been accustomed in former days.    \"It is I,\" said Mr Ladislaw, \"and Mr Hashford.\"    \"I shall be glad if you will immediately have my door opened,\" was the  reply.    \"Smith, unscrew the door at once,\" said Mr Ladislaw.    Smith solemnly proceeded to do as he was bid, and presently the screws  were both dislodged.    \"Is it done?\" said the Henniker when the sound ceased.    \"Yes, Miss Henniker; the door is quite free.\"    \"Then,\" said the Henniker--and there positively seemed to be a tremor in  the voice--\"please go; I will be down presently.\"    So the little procession turned and once more walked down the stairs,  Smith, with his screwdriver, still walking solemnly in the middle.  We  who were in hiding were torn by conflicting desires.  Our first impulse  was to remain and enjoy the spectacle of the crestfallen Henniker  marching forth from her late prison.  But somehow, rough boys as we  were, and not much given to chivalric scruples, the sound of that  tremble in the Henniker's voice, and with it the recollection of the  part we had taken in her punishment, made us feel as if, after all, the  best thing we could do was not to remain, but to follow the others down  stairs.    As we were doing so the ten o'clock bell rang for morning classes, and  we naturally sought the schoolroom, where, with Mr Hashford in the  desk, school was assembled just as if nothing had happened.  Hawkesbury  was the only absentee.    I certainly admired Mr Hashford on this occasion.  He appeared to be  the only person in the room who was not thoroughly uncomfortable.  Indeed, as we went on with our work, and he, almost pleasantly, entered  into it with us, we felt ourselves getting comfortable too, and could  hardly believe that the usher now instructing us had, an hour ago, been  our prisoner, and that we so recently had been shouting words of mutiny  and defiance all over the school.  It was like a dream--and, after all,  not a very nice dream.    But we were recalled to ourselves when presently, along the passage  outside our door, there resounded a footstep which instinct told us  belonged to the Henniker.  Not much chance of feeling comfortable with  that sound in one's ears!    But to our surprise and comfort it passed on and descended the stairs.  It was like a reprieve to convicted felons.    Class went on, and the clock was getting on to twelve--the usual hour  for a break--when the door opened, and Mr Ladislaw put in his head and  said, \"Smith, will you step down to my study?  Mr Hashford, the mid-day  bell will not ring till one to-day.\"    Smith solemnly followed the master from the room, and for another hour  we worked in class--one of us, at any rate--feeling very anxious and not  a little uneasy.    When the bell did ring, and we went down stairs, not knowing exactly  what was to become of us, my first thought was, what had become of  Smith?  He was not in the playground, where we wandered about listlessly  for a quarter of an hour before dinner, nor was he to be seen when  presently we assembled in the memorable parlour for our mid-day repast.    It was not a very grand meal, that dinner.  We partook of the cold  remains of a joint which one of ourselves had made a woeful attempt to  cook the day before, and which now tasted anything but delicious.  Miss  Henniker was in her usual place, and as we sat with our eyes rigidly  fixed on the plates before us, we were conscious of her glancing once or  twice towards one and another of us, and then turning away to speak to  Mr Ladislaw, who was also present.  Except for the whispered  conversation of these two not a word was uttered during the meal.  Even  Flanagan, when, in reaching the salt, he knocked over his water, did not  receive the expected bad mark, but was left silently to mop up the spill  as best he could.    It was a terrible meal, and my anxiety about my friend Smith made it all  the worse.    Dinner was over, and we were descending to afternoon class in Mr  Ladislaw's study, when the front door opened and Hawkesbury entered.    We could see he was taken aback and utterly astonished to see Mr  Ladislaw and Miss Henniker at liberty and us once more at our old tasks.  For a moment his face looked concerned and doubtful, then, suddenly  changing, it broke out into smiles as he ran up to Mr Ladislaw.    \"Oh, Mr Ladislaw,\" cried he, \"and Miss Henniker, I am so glad!  I  really couldn't bear to be in the school while they were treating you so  shamefully!\"    \"Where have you been, Hawkesbury?\" said Mr Ladislaw.    \"Oh!  I went out in hopes of being able to--\"    \"You have told no one of what has occurred?\" said Mr Ladislaw, sternly.    \"Oh, no!\" said the smiling Hawkesbury; \"I really went out because I  couldn't bear to be in the school and be unable to do anything for you  and Miss Henniker.  I _am_ so glad you have got out!\"    None of us had the spirit to protest.  We could see that Hawkesbury's  statement, and his expressed joy at their liberation, had gone down both  with Mr Ladislaw and Miss Henniker--and at our expense, too; and yet we  dared not expostulate or do ourselves justice.    Afternoon school went on, and still no Smith appeared.  Was he locked up  in the coal-hole or in one of the attics up stairs?  I wondered; or had  he been given into custody, or what?  No solution came to the mystery  all that afternoon or evening.  We worked silently on, conscious that  the Henniker's eyes were upon us, but aware that she neither spoke nor  interfered with us.    Bedtime came at last, and, in strange trouble and anxiety, I went up.  I  almost made up my mind to ask Mr Hashford or Mr Ladislaw what had  become of Smith, but I could not screw my courage up to the pitch.    As I was undressing, Hawkesbury came near me and whispered, \"Where is  Smith?\"    I vouchsafed no reply.  I had been used to give Hawkesbury credit for  good intentions, but I had had my confidence shaken by that day's  events.    \"Don't be cross with me, Batchelor,\" said he; \"I really don't deserve  it.\"    \"Why did you desert and leave us all in the lurch?\" growled I.    \"I did not mean to do it,\" said he, very meekly; \"but really, when I  woke this morning I felt I was doing wrong, Batchelor, and could not  bear to stay in and stand by while Mr Ladislaw and Miss Henniker were  kept shut up.  That's really the reason, and I thought it would be  kinder of me to keep out of the way and not spoil your fun.  Smith quite  misunderstood me, he did really.\"    \"Why didn't you say you wouldn't join before we began?\"  I asked.    \"Why, because you know, Batchelor, I was in a bad frame of mind then,  and was angry.  But I tried hard to forgive, and I blame myself very  much that I even seemed to agree.  You mustn't think too hardly of me,  Batchelor.\"    I said nothing, but went on undressing, more perplexed than ever to know  what to think.  Hawkesbury, after a warm \"Good-night,\" left me, and I  was thankful, at any rate, for the prospect of a few hours' sleep and  forgetfulness.    I was just getting into bed, and had turned back the clothes to do so,  when I suddenly caught sight of a scrap of paper appearing from under my  pillow.    I first supposed it must be some remnant of last night's sports, but, on  taking it out, found that it was a note carefully rolled up and  addressed to me in Smith's well-known hand.    With eager haste I unfolded it and read, \"I'm expelled.  Good-bye.  Write `J.,' Post-Office, Packworth.\"    Expelled! sent off at an hour's notice, without even a word of good-bye!"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21059"],[0,"The Adventures of Dick Maitland: A Tale of Unknown Africa (#15)"],[1,"which your will imposes on him that produce the desired effect,  which can be obtained without the employment of words at all, if your  will be strong enough.  And remember, also, that no abnormal strength of  will is needed if your patient be passive, unresisting.\"  \"Surely,\"  thought Dick, \"that ought to meet the present case, and at all events it  is well worth trying; so here goes.\"  Therewith he bent over his patient  and, fixing the man's gaze in the peculiar manner which Humphreys had  taught him, silently willed him to sink into so deep a sleep that he  should feel nothing of what was about to be done to him.  Almost  immediately the man's eyelids fluttered, closed, and he sank into a  profound sleep, breathing slowly and deeply, as could be seen by the  regular rise and fall of his bare, brawny chest.    \"_Wao! 'mtagati_--_'mkulu 'mtagati_ (a wizard--a great wizard)!\"  murmured the astonished crowd of onlookers behind their hands, gazing  wonderingly in each other's eyes.    Again Dick laid his fingers on his patient's pulse; already it was  stronger and more steady.  Very gently he raised one of the man's  eyelids and lightly laid his finger upon the eyeball; the patient might  have been dead for all the effect that the touch had upon him.  Then,  the warm water opportunely arriving, the young doctor got to work  without further delay.  Strongly impregnating the water with an  antiseptic, he proceeded rapidly to cleanse the wounds, taking a pair of  scissors or a knife from time to time and removing the already  putrefying flesh; then he proceeded to dress the wounds, one after the  other, with healing ointments, drawing the edges together, where  necessary, with a few stitches; and when at length, after more than an  hour's diligent, careful work, his labours came to an end, he ordered  the wagon cartel to be brought to the village, the door of the man's hut  to be enlarged, and a window opening to be made; and finally, when all  these things had been done to his satisfaction, he caused a comfortable  bed to be arranged upon the cartel, with skins borrowed from other huts,  and the man to be laid thereon and taken back to his hut.  And all this  time the patient had been sleeping as calmly as an infant!  The time had  now, however, arrived when he must be aroused, in order that an anti-  febrifuge might be administered; Dick therefore once more bent over the  man, strongly willing him to awake, which he instantly did, when,  through Jantje as interpreter, the question was put to him how he felt.  He immediately replied, in a wonderfully strong voice, considering his  condition, that he felt much better, and that his wounds were no longer  so painful as they had been; whereupon Dick administered the draught,  telling him, still through Jantje, that immediately after taking it he  would again fall asleep and so remain until the evening, when he would  awake much refreshed and stronger.  And while the words were being  spoken Dick strongly willed that they should be fulfilled.  The man  obediently gulped down the draught, Dick gently lowered the patient's  head to the pillow, and again deep sleep fell upon the poor fellow.    \"Now,\" ordered Dick, \"I want two women to come and watch by this man.  They must constantly fan him with leaves, to keep him cool and prevent  the flies from troubling him; and when he wakes someone must immediately  fetch me.  I shall be in my tent by the wagon, yonder.\"  Then, turning  to Grosvenor, who had remained at his elbow all the time, he said:    \"No more trekking for us to-day, Phil, or for the next week, I expect.  I must stay, and pull this poor chap through, if I can, now that I have  taken him in hand.\"    \"Oh yes! rather; of course; that goes without saying,\" cheerfully  assented Grosvenor.  \"But, I say, Dick, old chap,\" he continued, \"you  have astonished me to-day, fairly taken my breath away; I hadn't the  slightest notion that you were such a swell at your profession as you  have just proved yourself to be.  Never saw anything like it in my life  before, y'know, and couldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it.  Why,  I wouldn't have given three ha'pence for that Kafir's life when I first  set eyes upon him; but now, dash it all, I believe you're going to set  him on his feet again.  If you do, your fame will spread far and wide  through the country, and do us a lot of good.  But, I say, it was a  jolly lucky thing for you that the poor chap dropped off into that sound  sleep just when he did, eh?  Because it enabled you to do several things  that, it seems to me, you couldn't possibly have done had he remained  awake.  What puzzles me is that he continued to sleep all through it.  And I noticed that you didn't seem to worry in the least about whether  you awoke him or not.  I suppose it was sleep, was it not?\"    \"Oh yes!\" answered Dick airily; \"it was sleep, right enough; nothing in  the nature of swoon about it, if that is what you mean.  But now, what  about those lions?  My patient will sleep for several hours to come, and  I can quite well leave him.  It is now,\"--consulting his watch--\"only a  few minutes past eleven o'clock, and we ought to be able to organise the  hunt and bag the beasts comfortably before tiffin.  Are you game?\"    \"You bet I am, rather!\" responded Grosvenor.  \"It is just what I was  itching to suggest, but I thought it would seem callous to propose that  you should leave your patient, and it would not have been sporting to  have proposed to go off alone, leaving you behind.\"    \"Oh, that is all right!\" returned Dick confidently; \"my patient will not  need me for hours yet, so let us see about it at once.  Where is  Jantje?\"    Jantje was close at their elbows, and already \"putting on side\" among  the villagers upon the strength of being in the service of an _'mkulu  'mtagati_.  He stepped forward at the question and answered, with an air  of proud humility:    \"I'se here, sar.  What you please to want?\"    \"Mr Grosvenor and I are going to have a try for those lions, Jantje, if  they are still lurking in the neighbourhood,\" observed Dick.  \"I believe  you said that these people report the beasts to be somewhere in yonder  clump of bush?  Very well.  Now, I want a party to enter the bush on the  windward side and carefully beat down-wind in order to drive the brutes  into the open.  Mr Grosvenor and I will place ourselves on the down-  wind side of the bush, and if the lions can be induced to break cover we  will do our best to bowl them over.  We shall also require two steady,  reliable men to come with us to carry our spare rifles; but, understand  this, they must be men of courage, who will not be scared out of their  seven senses and bolt, carrying our rifles off with them, if the lions  should show in the open.\"    \"Yes, sar,\" answered Jantje, \"I understan' you puffekly.  You leave  everyt'ing to me, sar; I arrange it all, jus' as you wish.  An' I will  come wid you myself, sar, to carry gun.  I am a brabe man, sar; no  pusson in dhis worl' more brabe as me; you shall see, sar.\"    \"Very well,\" answered Dick, suppressing a smile at the Hottentot's  vainglorious boast; \"you, being so exceedingly brave and reliable shall  go with Mr Grosvenor; but you must pick me out a good man to come with  me.  Just see about it, will you, and bring the whole party to the  wagon, where we are now going to get our rifles.\"    Puffed up with the honour of having so important a matter confided to  him, the Hottentot saluted, and turned to address the crowd that still  hung about the white men awaiting possible further developments,  explaining to them what was required.  A few words sufficed, and the  moment that the white man's intentions and wishes were understood the  crowd dissolved, as if by magic, the men hurrying away to their huts to  procure their weapons, while Dick and Grosvenor sauntered away toward  the wagon, noting, as they went, that their team of oxen had been driven  to a spot where the grass was especially good, close to the banks of the  river, and that it was being zealously watched and guarded by a dozen  well-grown lads armed with hunting assagais and knobkerries.    Arrived at the wagon, the two friends proceeded to bring forth and don  their bandoliers, having first satisfied themselves that the belts were  filled with the kind of cartridge required for the particular pattern of  weapon which they were about to employ; and then, having taken down and  loaded the four rifles which they intended to use, they awaited the  arrival of the beating party, conscious now, for the first time, of a  peculiar and not altogether pleasant feeling compounded of excitement  and--was it \"funk\"?  No, certainly not, for neither of them would have  backed out of the adventure on any account; yet, if the sensation was  not \"funk\", it bore some sort of family resemblance to it, something  perhaps, in the nature of stage fright.  The fact is that each realised,  at nearly the same moment, that they were about to embark upon a  perfectly new experience, an adventure in which they were as yet  untried, in which courage and the most perfect _sangfroid_ were of the  utmost importance, and they were by no means certain how they would  emerge from the ordeal.  To put it plainly, they were just a little  afraid that at the critical moment they might fail to exhibit that  superlative coolness and aplomb, the slightest lack of which would cause  each to feel for ever humiliated and disgraced in the eyes of the other.  Besides, there were the natives, keen of eye, and quick to observe the  smallest sign of anything approaching to perturbation; it would be awful  beyond words to fail before them!  By a curious coincidence the mind of  each had been following precisely the same line of thought, and as they  saw Jantje approaching, followed by some forty beaters and every mongrel  cur belonging to the village, the same resolution came to each--they"]]]
