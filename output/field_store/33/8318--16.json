If any of the Gargoyles act badly, and have to be put in jail, they are  brought here and their wings unhooked and taken away from them until  they promise to be good.\"    The Wizard had listened intently to what Eureka had said.    \"I wish we had some of those loose wings,\" he said.    \"Could we fly with them?\" asked Dorothy.    \"I think so. If the Gargoyles can unhook the wings then the power to fly  lies in the wings themselves, and not in the wooden bodies of the people  who wear them. So, if we had the wings, we could probably fly as well as  they do--at least while we are in their country and under the spell of  its magic.\"    \"But how would it help us to be able to fly?\" questioned the girl.    \"Come here,\" said the little man, and took her to one of the corners of  the building. \"Do you see that big rock standing on the hillside  yonder?\" he continued, pointing with his finger.    \"Yes; it's a good way off, but I can see it,\" she replied.    \"Well, inside that rock, which reaches up into the clouds, is an archway  very much like the one we entered when we climbed the spiral stairway  from the Valley of Voe. I'll get my spy-glass, and then you can see it  more plainly.\"    He fetched a small but powerful telescope, which had been in his  satchel, and by its aid the little girl clearly saw the opening.    \"Where does it lead to?\" she asked.    \"That I cannot tell,\" said the Wizard; \"but we cannot now be far below  the earth's surface, and that entrance may lead to another stairway that  will bring us on top of our world again, where we belong. So, if we had  the wings, and could escape the Gargoyles, we might fly to that rock and  be saved.\"    \"I'll get you the wings,\" said Zeb, who had thoughtfully listened to all  this. \"That is, if the kitten will show me where they are.\"    \"But how can you get down?\" enquired the girl, wonderingly.    For answer Zeb began to unfasten Jim's harness, strap by strap, and  to buckle one piece to another until he had made a long leather strip  that would reach to the ground.    [Illustration: THE FIGHT WITH THE GARGOYLES.]    \"I can climb down that, all right,\" he said.    \"No you can't,\" remarked Jim, with a twinkle in his round eyes. \"You may  _go_ down, but you can only _climb_ up.\"    \"Well, I'll climb up when I get back, then,\" said the boy, with a laugh.  \"Now, Eureka, you'll have to show me the way to those wings.\"    \"You must be very quiet,\" warned the kitten; \"for if you make the least  noise the Gargoyles will wake up. They can hear a pin drop.\"    \"I'm not going to drop a pin,\" said Zeb.    He had fastened one end of the strap to a wheel of the buggy, and now he  let the line dangle over the side of the house.    \"Be careful,\" cautioned Dorothy, earnestly.    \"I will,\" said the boy, and let himself slide over the edge.    The girl and the Wizard leaned over and watched Zeb work his way  carefully downward, hand over hand, until he stood upon the ground  below. Eureka clung with her claws to the wooden side of the house and  let herself down easily. Then together they crept away to enter the low  doorway of a neighboring dwelling.    The watchers waited in breathless suspense until the boy again appeared,  his arms now full of the wooden wings.    When he came to where the strap was hanging he tied the wings all in a  bunch to the end of the line, and the Wizard drew them up. Then the line  was let down again for Zeb to climb up by. Eureka quickly followed him,  and soon they were all standing together upon the platform, with eight  of the much prized wooden wings beside them.    The boy was no longer sleepy, but full of energy and excitement. He put  the harness together again and hitched Jim to the buggy. Then, with the  Wizard's help, he tried to fasten some of the wings to the old  cab-horse.    This was no easy task, because half of each one of the hinges of the  wings was missing, it being still fastened to the body of the Gargoyle  who had used it. However, the Wizard went once more to his  satchel--which seemed to contain a surprising variety of odds and  ends--and brought out a spool of strong wire, by means of which they  managed to fasten four of the wings to Jim's harness, two near his head  and two near his tail. They were a bit wiggley, but secure enough if  only the harness held together.    The other four wings were then fastened to the buggy, two on each side,  for the buggy must bear the weight of the children and the Wizard as it  flew through the air.    [Illustration: JIM FLUTTERED AND FLOUNDERED THROUGH THE AIR.]    These preparations had not consumed a great deal of time, but the  sleeping Gargoyles were beginning to wake up and move around, and soon  some of them would be hunting for their missing wings. So the prisoners  resolved to leave their prison at once.    They mounted into the buggy, Dorothy holding Eureka safe in her lap. The  girl sat in the middle of the seat, with Zeb and the Wizard on each side  of her. When all was ready the boy shook the reins and said:    \"Fly away, Jim!\"    \"Which wings must I flop first?\" asked the cab-horse, undecidedly.    \"Flop them all together,\" suggested the Wizard.    \"Some of them are crooked,\" objected the horse.    \"Never mind; we will steer with the wings on the buggy,\" said Zeb. \"Just  you light out and make for that rock, Jim; and don't waste any time  about it, either.\"    So the horse gave a groan, flopped its four wings all together, and flew  away from the platform. Dorothy was a little anxious about the success  of their trip, for the way Jim arched his long neck and spread out his  bony legs as he fluttered and floundered through the air was enough to  make anybody nervous. He groaned, too, as if frightened, and the wings  creaked dreadfully because the Wizard had forgotten to oil them; but  they kept fairly good time with the wings of the buggy, so that they  made excellent progress from the start. The only thing that anyone could  complain of with justice was the fact that they wobbled first up and  then down, as if the road were rocky instead of being as smooth as the  air could make it.    The main point, however, was that they flew, and flew swiftly, if a bit  unevenly, toward the rock for which they had headed.    Some of the Gargoyles saw them, presently, and lost no time in  collecting a band to pursue the escaping prisoners; so that when Dorothy  happened to look back she saw them coming in a great cloud that almost  darkened the sky.    [Illustration]          CHAPTER 13.    THE DEN OF THE DRAGONETTES      Our friends had a good start and were able to maintain it, for with  their eight wings they could go just as fast as could the Gargoyles. All  the way to the great rock the wooden people followed them, and when Jim  finally alighted at the mouth of the cavern the pursuers were still some  distance away.    \"But, I'm afraid they'll catch us yet,\" said Dorothy, greatly excited.    \"No; we must stop them,\" declared the Wizard. \"Quick Zeb, help me pull  off these wooden wings!\"    They tore off the wings, for which they had no further use, and the  Wizard piled them in a heap just outside the entrance to the cavern.  Then he poured over them all the kerosene oil that was left in his  oil-can, and lighting a match set fire to the pile.    The flames leaped up at once and the bonfire began to smoke and roar and  crackle just as the great army of wooden Gargoyles arrived. The  creatures drew back at once, being filled with fear and horror; for such  a dreadful thing as a fire they had never before known in all the  history of their wooden land.    Inside the archway were several doors, leading to different rooms built  into the mountain, and Zeb and the Wizard lifted these wooden doors from  their hinges and tossed them all on the flames.    \"That will prove a barrier for some time to come,\" said the little man,  smiling pleasantly all over his wrinkled face at the success of their  stratagem. \"Perhaps the flames will set fire to all that miserable  wooden country, and if it does the loss will be very small and the  Gargoyles never will be missed. But come, my children; let us explore  the mountain and discover which way we must go in order to escape from  this cavern, which is getting to be almost as hot as a bake-oven.\"    To their disappointment there was within this mountain no regular flight  of steps by means of which they could mount to the earth's surface. A  sort of inclined tunnel led upward for a way, and they found the floor  of it both rough and steep. Then a sudden turn brought them to a narrow  gallery where the buggy could not pass. This delayed and bothered them  for a while, because they did not wish to leave the buggy behind them.  It carried their baggage and was useful to ride in wherever there were  good roads, and since it had accompanied them so far in their travels  they felt it their duty to preserve it. So Zeb and the Wizard set to  work and took off the wheels and the top, and then they put the buggy  edgewise, so it would take up the smallest space. In this position they  managed, with the aid of the patient cab-horse, to drag the vehicle  through the narrow part of the passage. It was not a great distance,  fortunately, and when the path grew broader they put the buggy together  again and proceeded more comfortably. But the road was nothing more than  a series of rifts or cracks in the mountain, and it went zig-zag in  every direction, slanting first up and then down until they were puzzled  as to whether they were any nearer to the top of the earth than when  they had started, hours before.    \"Anyhow,\" said Dorothy, \"we've 'scaped those awful Gurgles, and that's  _one_ comfort!\"    [Illustration: \"WHY IT'S A DRAGON!\"]    \"Probably the Gargoyles are still busy trying to put out"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22567"],[0,"History of the United States, Volume 2 (#15)"],[1," and New York  actually sent them. As the powers granted the commissioners presupposed  a deputation from each of the States, those present, after mature  deliberation, deemed it inadvisable to proceed, drawing up instead an  urgent address to the States to take \"speedy measures\" for another,  fuller, convention to meet on the second Monday of May, 1787, for the  same purposes as had occasioned this one. Such was the mode in which the  memorable Federal Convention came about. Its seat was Philadelphia.    [1787]    The second Monday of May, 1787, which should have witnessed the opening,  was the 14th, but on that day too few deputies had assembled. So late as  the 25th only nine States were represented. They, however, effected an  organization on the 25th and chose officers. On the 28th eleven States  were present, so that on the next day business began in earnest.  Governor Randolph read and expounded the Virginia plan for a new  government, and Charles Pinckney the South Carolina plan. Both of these  were referred to a committee of the whole to sit next day.    This Virginia plan was substantially the work of Madison, and was the  earliest sketch of the present Constitution of the United States. With  the Pinckney plan, it was worked over, debated, and amended in the  committee of the whole, until June 13th, on which day the committee rose  and reported to the Convention nineteen resolutions based almost wholly  upon the Virginia plan. These were the text for all the subsequent  doings of the Convention.    The so-called New Jersey plan was brought forward on June 15th, the gist  of it being a recurrence to the foolish idea of merely repairing the  Confederation that then was. Its strength, which was slight, consisted  in its accord with the letter of the credentials which the delegates had  brought. It was, however, emphatically rejected, the Convention  stretching instructions, ignoring the old government, and proceeding to  build from the foundations. On July 24th and 26th the resolutions, now  increased to twenty-three, were put in the hands of a committee of  detail to be reported back in the form of a constitution. They  reappeared in this shape on August 6th, and this new document was  henceforth the basis of discussion. On September 8th a new committee was  appointed to revise style and arrangement, and brought in its work  September 13th, after which additions and changes were few. The  Constitution received signature September 17th.    The Federal Convention of 1787 was the most remarkable gathering in all  our national history thus far. Sixty-five delegates were elected, but as  ten never attended, fifty-five properly made up the body. Even these  were at no time all present together. From July 5th to August 13th New  York was not represented. Rhode Island was not represented at all.  Washington was President; Franklin, aged eighty-one, the oldest member;  Gillman, of New Hampshire, aged twenty-five, the youngest. Each State  sent its best available talent, so that the foremost figures then in  American political life were present, the chief exceptions being John  Adams, Jefferson--both abroad at the time--Samuel Adams, not favorable  to the Convention, John Jay, and Patrick Henry. Eight of the members had  signed the great Declaration, six the Articles of Confederation, seven  the Annapolis appeal of 1786. Washington and a good half dozen others  had been conspicuous military leaders in the Revolution. Five had been  or still were governors of their respective States. Nearly all had held  important offices of one sort or another. Forty of the fifty-five had  been in Congress, a large proportion of them coming to the Convention  directly from the congressional session just ended in New York.    It is interesting to note how high many from this Constituent Assembly  rose after the adoption of the paper which they had indited. Washington  and Madison became Presidents, Gerry Vice-President, Langdon senator and  President of the Senate, with duty officially to notify him who was  already First in War that the nation had made him also First in Peace.  Langdon was candidate for Vice-President in 1809. Randolph was the  earliest United States Attorney-General, Hamilton earliest Secretary of  the Treasury, M'Henry third Secretary of War, succeeding General Knox.  Dayton was a representative from New Jersey in the IId, IIId, IVth, and  Vth Congresses, being Speaker during the last, then senator in the VIth,  VIIth, and VIIIth. Ellsworth and Johnson were Connecticut's first pair  of senators, Johnson passing in 1791 to the presidency of Columbia  College, Ellsworth to the national chief-justiceship to succeed Jay.  Rutledge was one of the first associate justices of the Supreme Court.  Subsequently, in July, 1795, Washington nominated him for chief justice,  and he actually presided over the Supreme Court at its term in that  year; but, for his ill-mannered denunciation of Jay's treaty, the Senate  declined to confirm him. Wilson and Patterson also each held the  position of associate justice on the supreme bench of the nation.    Rufus King, after the adoption of the Constitution, removed to New York.  He was a senator from that State between 1789 and 1795, and again  between 1813 and 1826; and Minister to England from 1796 to 1803, and  again after 1826 till his failing health compelled his resignation. He  was the federalist candidate for Vice-President in 1804 and 1808, and  for President in 1816. Sherman of Connecticut, Gillman of New Hampshire,  and Baldwin of Georgia, went into the House of Representatives and  were  promoted thence to the Senate. Robert Morris of Pennsylvania, Gouverneur  Morris, now again of New York, Caleb Strong of Massachusetts, William  Patterson of New Jersey, Richard Bassett of Delaware, Alexander Martin  and Blount of North Carolina, Charles Pinckney and Butler of South  Carolina, and Colonel Few of Georgia, all became senators. Madison,  Gerry, Fitzsimmons of Pennsylvania, Carroll of Maryland, and Spaight and  Williamson of North Carolina, all wrought well in the House, but did not  reach the Senate. Charles Cotesworth Pinckney was nominated for the  Presidency in 1800, on the ticket with John Adams, again in 1804, and  still again in 1808.    Jared Ingersoll was the federalist candidate for Vice-President in 1812,  on the ticket with De Witt Clinton, against Madison and Gerry. Yates  rose to be Chief Justice of the State of New York, Lansing to be its  Chancellor. Gerry and Strong of Massachusetts, Patterson of New Jersey,  Bassett of Delaware, Spaight and Davie of North Carolina, and Charles  Pinckney of South Carolina, became Governors of their States, as did  Alexander Martin, of North Carolina, a second time.    Having received final revision and signature, the Constitution was  transmitted, with a commendatory letter from Washington, to the old  Congress. Suggestions were added relating to the mode of launching it.  Congress was requested to lay the new Great Charter before the States,  and, so soon as it should have been ratified by nine of them, to fix the  date for the election by these of presidential electors, the day for the  latter to cast their votes, and the time and place for commencing  proceedings under the revised constitution. Congress complied. The  debates of the Convention, only more hot, attended ratification, which  was carried in several States only by narrow majorities.    [1788-1790]    Delaware was the first to ratify, December 7, 1787. Pennsylvania and New  Jersey soon followed, the one on the 12th of the same month, the other  on the 18th. Delaware and New Jersey voted unanimously; Pennsylvania  ratified by a vote of forty-six to twenty-three. During the first month  of the new year, 1788, Georgia and Connecticut ratified, on the 2d and  9th respectively. New Hampshire next took up the question, but adjourned  her convention to await the action of Massachusetts. In this great State  the people were divided almost equally. Of the western counties the  entire population that had sympathized or sided with Shays was bitter  against the Constitution. The larger centres and in general the eastern  part of the State favored it. The vote was had on February 6th, and  showed a majority of only 19 out of 355 in favor of the Constitution.      [Illustration: Parade with a float shaped as a ship carrying a banner  \"Hamilton.\"]  Celebrating the Adoption of the Constitution in New York.      The good work still remained but half done. It was a crisis.  Accordingly, early in this year, Hamilton, Madison, and Jay published  their weighty articles, since collected in the immortal volume known as  \"The Federalist.\" These discussions seemed to have much effect. Maryland  ratified on April 28th, and South Carolina on May 23d. New Hampshire  fell into line, the necessary ninth State to ratify, June 21st. Thus the  Constitution became binding, yet it was still painfully uncertain what  the action of Virginia and New York would be. In both States the  Constitution was opposed by many of the most influential men, and after  a long and heated canvass adoption occurred in Virginia by a majority of  only ten in a vote of 168; in New York by the narrow majority of two.  Even now North Carolina and Rhode Island remained aloof. The former, not  liking the prospect of isolation, came into the Union November 21, 1789,  after the new government had been some time at work. Rhode Island, owing  to her peculiar history in the matter of religious liberty, which she  feared a closer union would jeopardize, as well as to the strength of  the paper-money fanaticism within her borders, was more obdurate. The  chief difficulty here was to get the legislature to call a convention.  The New York Packet of February 20, 1790, in a letter from Rhode Island,  tells how this was accomplished. Among the anti-adoptionists in the  senate was a rural clergyman who, prompted by his conscience, "]]]
