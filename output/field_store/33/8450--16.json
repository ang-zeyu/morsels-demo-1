[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2753"],[0,"Ali Pacha (#15)"],[1,"one was choked by dust, and in winter could  hardly get through the mud. He rejoiced in the public inconvenience, and  one day having to go out in heavy rain, he remarked to one of the  officers of his escort, \"How delightful to be driven through this in a  carriage, while you will have the pleasure of following on horseback!  You will be wet and dirty, whilst I smoke my pipe and laugh at your  condition.\"    He could not understand why Western sovereigns should permit their  subjects to enjoy the same conveniences and amusements as themselves.  \"If I had a theatre,\" he said, \"I would allow no one to be present at  performances except my own children; but these idiotic Christians do not  know how to uphold their own dignity.\"    There was no end to the mystifications which it amused the pacha to  carry out with those who approached him.    One day he chose to speak Turkish to a Maltese merchant who came to  display some jewels. He was informed that the merchant understood only  Greek and Italian. He none the less continued his discourse without  allowing anyone to translate what he said into Greek. The Maltese at  length lost patience, shut up his cases, and departed. Ali watched him  with the utmost calm, and as he went out told him, still in Turkish, to  come again the next day.    An unexpected occurrence seemed, like the warning finger of Destiny, to  indicate an evil omen for the pacha's future. \"Misfortunes arrive in  troops,\" says the forcible Turkish proverb, and a forerunner of  disasters came to Ali Dacha.    One morning he was suddenly roused by the Sheik Yussuf, who had forced  his way in, in spite of the guards. \"Behold!\" said he, handing Ali a  letter, \"Allah, who punishes the guilty, has permitted thy seraglio of  Tepelen to be burnt. Thy splendid palace, thy beautiful furniture,  costly stuffs, cashmeers, furs, arms, all are destroyed! And it is thy  youngest and best beloved son, Salik Bey himself, whose hand kindled the  flames!\" So saying; Yussuf turned and departed, crying with a triumphant  voice, \"Fire! fire! fire!\"    Ali instantly ordered his horse, and, followed by his guards, rode  without drawing rein to Tepelen. As soon as he arrived at the place  where his palace had formerly insulted the public misery, he hastened to  examine the cellars where his treasures were deposited. All was intact,  silver plate, jewels, and fifty millions of francs in gold, enclosed in  a well over which he had caused a tower to be built. After this  examination he ordered all the ashes to be carefully sifted in hopes of  recovering the gold in the tassels and fringes of the sofas, and the  silver from the plate and the armour. He next proclaimed through the  length and breadth of the land, that, being by the hand of Allah  deprived of his house, and no longer possessing anything in his native  town, he requested all who loved him to prove their affection by  bringing help in proportion. He fixed the day of reception for each  commune, and for almost each individual of any rank, however small,  according to their distance from Tepelen, whither these evidences of  loyalty were to be brought.    During five days Ali received these forced benevolences from all parts.  He sat, covered with rags, on a shabby palm-leaf mat placed at the outer  gate of his ruined palace, holding in his left hand a villainous pipe of  the kind used by the lowest people, and in his right an old red cap,  which he extended for the donations of the passers-by. Behind stood a  Jew from Janina, charged with the office of testing each piece of gold  and valuing jewels which were offered instead of money; for, in terror,  each endeavoured to appear generous. No means of obtaining a rich  harvest were neglected; for instance, Ali distributed secretly large  sums among poor and obscure people, such as servants, mechanics, and  soldiers, in order that by returning them in public they might appear to  be making great sacrifices, so that richer and more distinguished  persons could not, without appearing ill-disposed towards the pacha,  offer only the same amount as did the poor, but were obliged to present  gifts of enormous value.    After this charity extorted from their fears, the pacha's subjects hoped  to be at peace. But a new decree proclaimed throughout Albania required  them to rebuild and refurnish the formidable palace of Tepelen entirely  at the public expense. Ali then returned to Janina, followed by his  treasure and a few women who had escaped from the flames, and whom he  disposed of amongst his friends, saying that he was no longer  sufficiently wealthy to maintain so many slaves.    Fate soon provided him with a second opportunity for amassing wealth.  Arta, a wealthy town with a Christian population, was ravaged by the  plague, and out of eight thousand inhabitants, seven thousand were swept  away. Hearing this, Ali hastened to send commissioners to prepare an  account of furniture and lands which the pacha claimed as being heir to  his subjects. A few livid and emaciated spectres were yet to be found in  the streets of Arta. In order that the inventory might be more complete,  these unhappy beings were compelled to wash in the Inachus blankets,  sheets, and clothes steeped in bubonic infection, while the collectors  were hunting everywhere for imaginary hidden treasure. Hollow trees were  sounded, walls pulled down, the most unlikely corners examined, and a  skeleton which was discovered still girt with a belt containing Venetian  sequins was gathered up with the utmost care. The archons of the town  were arrested and tortured in the hope of discovering buried treasure,  the clue to which had disappeared along with the owners. One of these  magistrates, accused of having hidden some valuable objects, was plunged  up to his shoulders in a boiler full of melted lead and boiling oil. Old  men, women, children, rich and poor alike, were interrogated, beaten,  and compelled to abandon the last remains of their property in order to  save their lives.    Having thus decimated the few inhabitants remaining to the town, it  became necessary to repeople it. With this object in view, Ali's  emissaries overran the villages of Thessaly, driving before them all the  people they met in flocks, and compelling them to settle in Arta. These  unfortunate colonists were also obliged to find money to pay the pacha  for the houses they were forced to occupy.    This business being settled, Ali turned to another which had long been  on his mind. We have seen how Ismail Pacho Bey escaped the assassins  sent to murder him. A ship, despatched secretly from Prevesa, arrived at  the place of his retreat. The captain, posing as a merchant, invited  Ismail to come on board and inspect his goods. But the latter, guessing  a trap, fled promptly, and for some time all trace of him was lost. Ali,  in revenge, turned his wife out of the palace at Janina which she still  occupied, and placed her in a cottage, where she was obliged to earn a  living by spinning. But he did not stop there, and learning after some  time that Pacho Bey had sought refuge with the Nazir of Drama, who had  taken him into favour, he resolved to strike a last blow, more sure and  more terrible than the others. Again Ismail's lucky star saved him from  the plots of his enemy. During a hunting party he encountered a  kapidgi-bachi, or messenger from the sultan, who asked him where he  could find the Nazir, to whom he was charged with an important  communication. As kapidgi-bachis are frequently bearers of evil tidings,  which it is well to ascertain at once, and as the Nazir was at some  distance, Pacho Bey assumed the latter's part, and the sultan's  confidential messenger informed him that he was the bearer of a firman  granted at the request of Ali Pacha of Janina.    \"Ali of Tepelenir. He is my friend. How can I serve him?\"    \"By executing the present order, sent you by the Divan, desiring you to  behead a traitor, named Pacho Bey, who crept into your service a short  time ago.    \"Willingly I but he is not an easy man to seize being brave, vigorous,  clever, and cunning. Craft will be necessary in this case. He may appear  at any moment, and it is advisable that he should not see you. Let no  one suspect who you are, but go to Drama, which is only two hours  distant, and await me there. I shall return this evening, and you can  consider your errand as accomplished.\"    The kapidgi-bachi made a sign of comprehension, and directed his course  towards Drama; while Ismail, fearing that the Nazir, who had only known  him a short time, would sacrifice him with the usual Turkish  indifference, fled in the opposite direction. At the end of an hour he  encountered a Bulgarian monk, with whom he exchanged clothes--a disguise  which enabled him to traverse Upper Macedonia in safety. Arriving at the  great Servian convent in the mountains whence the Axius takes its rise,  he obtained admission under an assumed name. But feeling sure of the  discretion of the monks, after a few days he explained his situation to  them.    Ali, learning the ill-success of his latest stratagem, accused the Nazir  of conniving at Paeho Bey's escape. But the latter easily justified  himself with the Divan by giving precise information of what had really  occurred. This was what Ali wanted, who profited thereby in having the  fugitive's track followed up, and soon got wind of his retreat. As Pacho  Bey's innocence had been proved in the explanations given to the Porte,  the death firman obtained against him became useless, and Ali affected  to abandon him to his fate, in order the better to conceal the new plot  he was conceiving against him.    Athanasius Vaya, chief assassin of the Kardikiotes, to whom Ali imparted  his present plan for the destruction of Ismail, begged for the honour of  putting it into execution, swearing that this time Ismail should not  escape.

The    government has taken measures to curb violent crime and to spur    economic activity and trade. The economy is bolstered by remittances    from abroad of $400-$600 million annually, mostly from Greece and    Italy; this helps offset the sizable trade deficit. Agriculture,    which accounts for half of GDP, is held back because of frequent    drought and the need to modernize equipment and consolidate small    plots of land. Severe energy shortages are forcing small firms out    of business, increasing unemployment, scaring off foreign investors,    and spurring inflation. The government plans to boost energy imports    to relieve the shortages. In addition, the government is moving to    improve the poor national road network, a long-standing barrier to    sustained economic growth.
