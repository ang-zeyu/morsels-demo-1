And when he wakens, he does not waken as do we  humans;--yawningly, dazedly, drunk with slumber. At one moment he is  sound asleep. At the next he is broad awake; with every faculty alert.    So ever it was, with Lad. So it was with him, this night. An hour  before dawn, he woke with sharp suddenness; and at once he was on his  feet; tense, on guard. He did not know what had roused him. Yet, now  that he was awake, two of his senses recorded something which banished  from him all thought of further sleep.    To his ears came a far-off muffled wail;--a wail which held more than  unhappiness;--a wail which vibrated with real terror. And he knew the  voice for Lady's.    To his sensitive nostrils, through the intervening distance and the  obstructing walls and windows, drifted a faint reek of smoke.    Now, the smoke-smell, by itself, meant nothing whatever to Lad. All  evening a trace of it had hung in the air; from the brush fire. And, in  any case, this whiff was too slight to have emanated from the house or  from any spot near the house. Yet, taken together with Lady's cry of  fear--    Lad crossed to the front door, and scratched imperiously at it. The  locked door did not yield to his push. Too sensible to keep on at a  portal he could not open, he ran upstairs, to the closed door of the  Master's room. There, again he scratched; this time harder and more  loudly. Twice and thrice he scratched; whining under his breath.    At last the deep-slumbering Master heard him. Rousing himself, and  still three-quarters asleep, he heard not only the scratching and the  whimper but, in the distance, Lady's wail of fear. And, sleep-drugged,  he mumbled:    \"Shut up, Laddie!--I hear her.--Let her howl.--If she's lonely, down  there, she'll--she'll remember the lesson--all the better. Go  downstairs and--be quiet!\"    He fell sound asleep again. Obedient to the slumbrous mandate, Lad  turned and pattered mournfully away. But, he was not content to return  to his own nap, with that terror-cry of Lady's echoing in his ears. And  he made a second attempt to get out.    At each side of the piano, in the music room, was a long French window.  Often, by day, Lad used to pass in or out of these door-like windows.  He knew that they, as well as the doors, were a recognized means of  exit. Now, with eagerly scratching paw, he pushed at the nearest of  them.    The house was but carelessly locked at night. For Lad's presence  downstairs was a better burglar-preventive than the best bolts ever  forged. Tired and drowsy, the Master, this night, had neglected to bar  the French windows.    The window gave, at Lad's vehement scratch; and swung outward on its  hinges. A second later, the big dog was running at top speed toward the  tool-house.    Now, the ways of the most insignificant brushfire are beyond the exact  wisdom of man. Especially in droughty weather. When they knocked off  work for the day, the two laborers had gone back to the blaze beyond  the tool-house and conscientiously had scattered and stamped on its  last visible remnants. The Master, too, coming home from his evening  walk, had glanced toward the back garden and had seen no telltale spark  to hint at life in the trampled fire.    Nevertheless, a scrap of ember, hidden from the men's gaze beneath a  handful of dead leaves had refused to perish with its comrade-sparks.  And, in the course of five hours, an industrious little flicker had  ignited other bits of brush and of dried leafage and last year's weed  stumps. The wind was in the north. And it had guided the course of the  crawling thread of red. The advancing line had thrown out tendrils of  scarlet, as it went.    Most of these had died, in the plowed ground. One had not. It had crept  on, half-extinguished at times and again snapping merrily, until it had  reached the tool-house. The shed-like room stood on low joists, with a  clear space ten inches high between its flimsy board floor and the  ground. And, in this space, the leaves of the preceding autumn had  drifted in windrows. The persevering spark did the rest.    Lady woke from a fitful doze, to find herself choking from smoke. The  boards of the floor were too hot for endurance. Between their cracks  thin wavery slices of smoke were pouring upward into the room. The  leaves had begun to ignite the floor-boards and the lower part of the  ramshackle building's thin walls.    While the pain and humiliation of her whipping had not been able to  wring a sound from the young thoroughbred, yet fright of this sort was  afar different thing. Howling with panic terror, she dashed about the  small enclosure, clawing frantically at door and scantling. Once or  twice she made half-hearted effort to spring up at the closed window.  But, from lack of running-space as well as from lack of nerve to make  the high leap, she failed.    Across the lawn and door-yard and around the end of the stables  thundered Lad. With the speed of a charging bull he came on. Before he  reached the burning shack, he knew more of his mate's plight and peril  than any human could have known.    Around the small building he whirled, so close to it that the flames at  its base seared his mighty coat and blistered and blackened his white  paws.    Then, running back a yard or so, he flung his eighty-pound weight  crashingly at the fastened door. The door, as it chanced, was well-nigh  the only solid portion of the shack. And it held firm, under an impact  that bruised the flying dog and which knocked him breathless to the  fire-streaked ground.    At sound of her mate's approach, Lady had ceased wailing. Lad could  hear her terrified whimpers as she danced frantically about on the  red-hot boards. And the knowledge of her torture drove him momentarily  insane.    Staggering up from his fall, he flung his splendid head back and, with  muzzle to the clouded skies, he tore to shreds the solemn silences of  the spring night with a wolf-howl; hideous in its savage grief,  deafeningly loud.    As though the awesome yell had cleared his brain, he sprang to his feet  amid the stinging embers; steady, alert, calm; with no hint of despair  or of surrender.    His smarting eyes fixed themselves on the single dusty window of the  tool-house. Its sill was a full five feet above ground. Its four small  panes were separated by a wide old-fashioned cross-piece of hardwood  and putty. The putty, from age, was as solid as cement. The whole  window was a bare sixteen by twenty inches.    Lad ran back, once more, a few feet; his gaze fixed appraisingly on the  window and measuring his distance with the sureness of a sharpshooter.    The big collie had made up his mind. His plan was formed. And as he was  all-wise, with the eerie wisdom of the highest type of collie, there  can be scant doubt he knew just what that plan entailed.    It was suicide. But, oh, it was a glorious suicide! Compared to it the  love-sacrifices of a host of Antonys and Abelards and Romeos are but  petty things. Indeed, its nearest approach in real life was perhaps  Moore's idiotically beautiful boast:      Through the fiery furnace your steps I'll pursue;    To find you and save you:--or perish there, too!    The great dog gathered himself for the insane hero-deed. His shaggy  body whizzed across the scarlet pattern of embers; then shot into the  air. Straight as a flung spear he flew; hurtling through the  flame-fringed billows of smoke.    Against the shut window he crashed, with the speed of a catapult.  Against it he crashed; and clean through it, into the hell of smoke and  fire and strangulation inside the shack.    His head had smashed the strong cross-piece of wood and dried putty and  had crumpled it like so much wet paper. His giant shoulders had ripped  the window-frame clean of its screws. Into the burning room spun Lad,  amid a hail of broken glass and splintered wood.    To the fire-eaten floor he was hurled, close to his cowering and  whimpering mate. He reeled to his feet, and stood there, shoulder to  shoulder with Lady. His work was done.    And, yet, it was not in Sunnybank Lad's nature to be such a fool as is  the usual melodrama hero. True, he had come to share Lady's fate, if he  could not rescue her. Yet, he would not submit tamely to death, until  every resource had been tried.    He glanced at the door. Already he had found by harsh experience that  his strength availed nothing in the battering down of those strong  panels. And he peered up, through the swirling red smoke, toward the  oblong of window, whereby he had made his tumultuous entrance to the  death-trap.    Again, he must have known how hopeless of achievement was the feat he  was about to try. But, as ever, mere obstacles were not permitted to  stand in Lad's way.    Wheeling, he seized Lady by the nape of the neck. With a mighty heave,  he swung her clear of the hot floor. Gathering all his fierce strength  into one sublime effort, he sprang upward toward the window; his mate  hanging from his iron jaws.    Yes, it was a ridiculous thing to attempt. No dog, with thrice Lad's  muscular strength, could have accomplished the impossibility of  springing out through that high, narrow window, carrying a weight of  fifty pounds between his teeth.    Lad's leap did not carry him half the distance he had aimed for. Back  to the floor he fell, Lady with him.    Maddened by pain and by choking and by stark terror, Lady had not the  wit to realize what Lad was attempting. All she knew was that he had  seized her roughly by the neck, and had leaped in air with her; and had  then brought her bangingly down upon the torturing hot boards. And her  panic was augmented by delirious rage.    At Lad's face she flew, snarling murderously. One slash of her curving  eyetooth laid bare his cheek. Then she drove for his throat.    Lad stood stock still.

Here,  what about breakfast?  We will talk about it over our morning meal.\"    They did, with the result that their party was afterwards increased by  one who had already proved how he could manage the fresh purchases.  And  if further inducement were needed it was afforded by Mark, who suddenly  exclaimed, \"I've got it, doctor!\"    \"Got what?\"    \"This fellow can manage ponies splendidly.\"    \"Well, we know that,\" said the doctor drily.    \"Yes,\" continued Mark; \"but why couldn't a man who can manage dumb  animals like that be quite at home with bullocks?\"    \"Good boy,\" said Sir James.  \"There is something in that.  You mean, for  him to take the place of the bullock leader--fore--what you call him.\"    \"Loper, father.\"    \"Yes.  Is there any connection between loper and leaper, doctor?\"  continued Sir James.    \"I cannot say on the instant.  It wants thinking out, sir.  Antelope--  loper--leaper.\"    \"Well, never mind that,\" said Sir James.  \"But if he can manage the  bullocks too that is an additional reason why he should stay.\"    \"But he is such a dismal, unhappy sort of fellow,\" protested Mark.    \"Yes, boy, but he can be very useful to us though not very ornamental,\"  said the doctor.    \"No, sir,\" said Dean, \"I believe that the oxen would take fright at  him.\"    \"Use is second nature, Dean,\" said Mark.    \"What do you think little Dan said about him just now?\" said Dean.    \"Can't say, of course,\" said his uncle.  \"What did he say?\"    \"That he was all shadow and flam.\"    \"Yes,\" cried Mark; \"and Buck Denham compared him to a human skeleton on  stilts.  I don't like him; but I suppose we shall get used to him in  time.\"    \"Tut, tut, tut!\" ejaculated Sir James.  \"Don't trifle, boys; this is a  serious matter.  Here, Mark, go and tell Buck Denham that I want to  speak to him.\"    The man came up, looking very serious, and shaking his head.    \"Very sorry, sir,\" he said, before Sir James could speak, \"but I have  just been having it over with that other little black, and he tells me  that his mate came to him after the scare about the lion, and said he  would not go any further, and went off at once.\"    \"Oh,\" said Sir James.  \"Well, this is your business, doctor.  I said I  wouldn't interfere.  You are captain.  You had better tell Denham what  we have been talking about.\"    \"Yes.  Look here, my man; we have come to the conclusion that this  fellow would be very useful with the ponies.\"    \"Yes, sir?\"    \"And I want to ask you whether you think he could take the foreloper's  place as well?\"    \"Well, sir,\" said the man, with a grim smile, \"he doesn't look much like  one, certainly, and I don't believe he knows anything about it.\"    \"But couldn't you train him?\"    \"Oh, yes, I could train him, sir.  I don't think the beasts would take  to him all at once, but it seems to me the queshtun is would he do it?\"    \"I shall make that the condition as to his staying,\" said the doctor  firmly.        CHAPTER TWELVE.    IN MID-VELDT.    \"I know what I shall do,\" said Dean, as they prepared for their morning  start, during which he had been thoughtfully watching the helpful way in  which their new attendant loaded the ponies, over which he seemed to  have the most perfect command.    \"Well, what shall you do?\" said his cousin.    \"Learn that whistle, and manage the ponies myself.\"    \"Humph!\" grunted Mark.  \"That will be no good as long as that dreary  fellow is near them.\"    \"I say,\" said Dean, as he and his cousin were tramping along in the  rear, gazing eagerly about to the right and left of the track,  thoroughly enjoying the beauty of the scenery, and looking out the while  for something that might be a pleasant addition to their next meal.    \"Well, what do you say?  That you don't see any game?\"    \"No,\" said Dean.  \"I want you to look at black Mak.\"    \"Well, what of him?  I think he's as dingy black a nigger as ever I saw.  Not a bit like those flat-nosed woolly-headed fellows that we used to  see at home.\"    \"I don't mean that.\"    \"What do you mean, then?\" said Mark impatiently.    \"That he seems so sour and surly, as different as can be from what he  was yesterday.  We didn't do anything to give him offence.  Let's see;  what did we do yesterday and the day before to hurt his feelings?\"    \"I don't know,\" said Mark.  \"I did nothing.  What did you do?\"    \"Nothing,\" replied Dean.  \"He was as jolly and smiling as could be till  last night; and see how he helped about the scare.  Now, I tell you what  I think.\"    \"Oh, I wish you wouldn't think so much,\" cried Mark.  \"It makes you seem  so slow and sleepy!  Well, what do you think?\"    \"I think he is jealous of the new man.\"    \"Right.  He doesn't like the look of him--thinks he's a bad colour,  neither black nor white.  You are right, Dean.  I saw him scowling at  him, now you mention it.  Well, we shall have to look out and tell Buck  Denham that there must be no quarrelling.  If they don't agree he must  take them both by the scruff and knock their heads together.\"    \"Oh, but that will all blow over,\" said Dean, \"I daresay.  There's  nothing for them to disagree over, because this Brown will have his own  work to do.\"    \"And black Mak has nothing to do but look on,\" put in Mark, laughing.    \"You forget one thing,\" said Dean; \"he has to carry his spear.\"    \"Yes, spear,\" said Mark eagerly; \"and that sets one thinking.  That  spear is precious sharp.\"    \"How do you know?\"    \"He showed it to me, and seemed as proud of it as could be.\"    \"Well, what then?\"    \"Why, it would be very nasty if they quarrelled and came to a fight.  What chance would Mr Staches have, only armed with a small pair of  scissors?\"    The days wore on, one strongly resembling another, and though the black  guide stalked about like a superintendent and was rather given to scowl  at the forelopers, he every now and then unbent from his savage dignity,  and was always the best of friends with the boys.  In fact, upon  occasions when he was marching along with them beside the bullocks, or  by them when they were mounted on a couple of ponies, he would even  unbend so far as to allow one of them to carry his spear, evidently as a  great favour and a mark of honour.    \"Treats it,\" said Mark merrily, \"as if it were his sceptre.\"    But there was no suggestion of quarrelling, and the man was seen at his  best and full of smiles when, as the bullocks plodded sluggishly along,  hunting excursions were made off to the right or left of the trail--a  trail which the party formed for themselves, for the old ones soon died  out--the new one being formed as to direction by their guide himself.  He selected the most open country, and pointed out with his spear some  distant object for which Buck Denham was to make, and when it was  reached in the evening it was invariably found to be a spot where there  was a good supply of water and food for the cattle.    So far from there being any quarrelling on the side of Brown--Dunn  Brown, as to their great amusement he told the boys was his full name,  Dunn from his mother, and Brown from his father--the long, thin,  peculiar looking fellow settled down as calmly as if he had been in Sir  James's service half his life.    He was a kind and careful tender of the ponies, and after a few displays  of awkwardness which Buck Denham corrected in the most friendly way, he  was soon quite at home with the bullocks.    \"Why, the great lumbering, fat, stupid brutes are beginning quite to  know him, gentlemen, and I should not be at all surprised if one of  these days we find him whistling to them and making them come to him  like the ponies.\"    As the party journeyed on day after day farther and farther from  civilisation, the expedition was all that could be desired.  Game was  plentiful and the two keepers were quite in their element, so that the  larder was well stocked, and they took care that there was plenty of  sport for the two lads whenever the waggons' course was marked down and  the little party, trusting to the drivers to make their way to the given  point, struck off in a different direction so as to make a _detour_ and  meet at their appointed centre before night.    The ponies enabled their riders to get many a shot at the several  varieties of antelope--boks, as they were generally called--while as  game was so abundantly plentiful, the boys were asked by the doctor what  they would seek for that day when they would sometimes decide on  devoting one barrel of their double guns to small shot, the other in  case of danger being loaded with a bullet.  Then they would make the  Illaka understand what they required, and he would lead them to where  there was abundance of a large kind of partridge, or francolin, which  was delicious eating; or take them to some place at the edge of the  forest where he knew from experience that the harsh, metallic-voiced,  speckled guinea-fowl would be coming home to roost.    This would always be when the supply of the larder was very low, and  then, with the two keepers to load, a heavy bag would invariably be  made, and a pretty good odour of burning feathers pervade the camp.    Camp was formed one night with all the precautions made such as were  customary in the part of the world through which they were travelling,  so as to carefully secure the draught animals and the ponies,"]]]
