During the period of a little over four  days, the sun shines continuously on both the North and South Poles at  the same time, owing to refraction parallax, semi-diameter, and dip of  the horizon.           *       *       *       *       *          THE COLLINS LINE OF STEAMERS.      The breaking up of the Baltic, the last of the famous Collins line of  steamships, calls out a number of interesting facts with regard to the  history of the several vessels of that fleet. There were five in all,  the Adriatic, Atlantic, Pacific, Arctic, and Baltic. They were built and  equipped in New York. Their dimensions were: Length, 290 feet; beam, 45  feet; depth of hold, 311/2 feet; capacity, 2,860 tons; machinery, 1,000  horse power. In size, speed, and appointments they surpassed any  steamers then afloat, and they obtained a fair share of the passenger  traffic. A fortune was expended in decorating the saloons. The entire  cost of each steamer was not less than $600,000, and notwithstanding  their quick passages, the subsidy received, and the high rates of  freight paid, the steamers ran for six years at great loss, and finally  the company became bankrupt.    The Atlantic was the pioneer steamship of the line. She sailed from New  York April 27, 1849, and arrived in the Mersey May 10, thus making the  passage in about thirteen days, two of which were lost in repairing the  machinery; the speed was reduced in order to prevent the floats from  being torn from the paddle-wheels. The average time of the forty-two  westward trips in the early days of the line was 11 days 10 hours and 26  minutes, against the average of the then so called fastest line of  steamers, 12 days 19 hours and 26 minutes. In February, 1852, the Arctic  made the passage from New York to Liverpool in 9 days and 17 hours.    The Arctic was afterward run into by a French vessel at sea and only a  few of her passengers were saved. The Pacific was never heard from after  sailing from Liverpool, and all the persons on board were lost. The  Atlantic, after rotting and rusting at her wharf, was deprived of her  machinery and converted into a sailing vessel, and was broken up in New  York last year. The Adriatic, the \"queen of the fleet,\" made less than a  half dozen voyages, was sold to the Galway Company, and is now used in  the Western Islands as a coal hulk by an English company.    The Baltic was in the government service during the war as a supply  vessel, and was afterward sold at auction; her machinery was removed and  sold as old iron. She was then converted into a sailing ship, and of  late years has been used as a grain carrying vessel between San  Francisco and Great Britain. On a recent voyage to Boston she was  strained to such an extent as to be made unseaworthy, and for that  reason is to be broken up.    One cannot but remark in this connection how small has been the advance  in steamship building during the quarter century since the Collins line  was in its glory.           *       *       *       *       *          CHINESE WOMEN'S FEET.      [Illustration: CHINESE WOMEN'S FEET.]    An American missionary, Miss Norwood, of Swatow, recently described in a  _Times_ paragraph how the size of the foot is reduced in Chinese women.  The binding of the feet is not begun till the child has learnt to walk.  The bandages are specially manufactured, and are about two inches wide  and two yards long for the first year, five yards long for subsequent  years. The end of the strip is laid on the inside of the foot at the  instep, then carried over the toes, under the foot, and round the heel,  the toes being thus drawn toward and over the sole, while a bulge is  produced on the instep, and a deep indentation in the sole. Successive  layers of bandages are used till the strip is all used, and the end is  then sewn tightly down. The foot is so squeezed upward that, in walking,  only the ball of the great toe touches the ground. After a month the  foot is put in hot water to soak some time; then the bandage is  carefully unwound, much dead cuticle coming off with it. Frequently,  too, one or two toes may even drop off, in which case the woman feels  afterward repaid by having smaller and more delicate feet. Each time the  bandage is taken off, the foot is kneaded to make the joints more  flexible, and is then bound up again as quickly as possible with a fresh  bandage, which is drawn up more tightly. During the first year the pain  is so intense that the sufferer can do nothing, and for about two years  the foot aches continually, and is the seat of a pain which is like the  pricking of sharp needles. With continued rigorous binding the foot in  two years becomes dead and ceases to ache, and the whole leg, from the  knee downward, becomes shrunk, so as to be little more than skin and  bone. When once formed, the \"golden lily,\" as the Chinese lady calls her  delicate little foot, can never recover its original shape. Our  illustrations show the foot both bandaged and unbandaged, and are from  photographs kindly forwarded by Mr. J. W. Bennington, R.N., who writes:  \"It is an error to suppose, as many do, that it is only the Upper Ten  among the daughters of China that indulge in the luxury of 'golden  lilies,' as it is extremely common among every class, even to the very  poorest--notably the poor sewing women one sees in every Chinese city  and town, who can barely manage to hobble from house to house seeking  work. The pain endured while under the operation is so severe and  continuous that the poor girls never sleep for long periods without the  aid of strong narcotics, and then only but fitfully; and it is from this  constant suffering that the peculiar sullen or stolid look so often seen  on the woman's face is derived. The origin of this custom is involved in  mystery to the Westerns. Some say that the strong-minded among the  ladies wanted to interfere in politics, and that there is a general  liking for visiting, chattering, and gossip (and China women _can_  chatter and gossip), both and all of which inclinations their lords  desired, and desire, to stop by crippling them.\"           *       *       *       *       *      To the alteration and metamorphism of rocks by the infiltration of rain  and other meteoric waters, M. De Koninck, of the Belgian Academy of  Sciences, assigns the cause of many hitherto unexplained phenomena in  geology.           *       *       *       *       *          CORRESPONDENCE      ICE AT HIGH TEMPERATURES.    _To the Editor of the Scientific American:_    Your issues of October 23 and 30 contain some remarkable articles under  the heading of \"Ice at High Temperatures.\"    Prof. Carnelley says; \"In order to convert a solid into a liquid, the  _pressure_ must be above a certain point, otherwise no amount of heat  will melt the substance,\" as it passes at once from the sold state into  the state of gas, subliming away without previous melting. And, \"having  come to this conclusion, it was easily foreseen that it would be  possible to have solid ice at temperatures far above the ordinary  melting point.\"    The first conclusion of the professor is correct, but not new. The  second conclusion is new, but very doubtful as to its correctness, and  certainly does not follow as a sequence from his premise.    If we try to heat ice in a vacuum, we cannot apply any heat to the ice  direct, but only to the vessel containing the ice. The vessel may be  much heated; but whether it will convey heat to the ice quick enough to  heat it over 32 deg., and whether at all it can be heated over 32 deg., this is  a question of a different nature. Before crediting such a conclusion we  must know more of the details of the experiments which the professor  made in order to verify its correctness. When saying that \"on one  occasion a small quantity of water was frozen in a glass vessel which  was so hot that it could not be touched by the hand without burning it,\"  he evidently assumes that if the vessel is hot, the ice inside must be  equally so; but this assumption is erroneous. Faraday has made water to  freeze in a red hot platina pot; the ice thus formed was not red hot  like the platina, but was below the freezing point. Just so with  Professor Carnelley's glass vessel: the vessel was hot, but the ice  inside no doubt was \"ice cold.\" If the professor would surround a  thermometer bulb with ice and then make the mercury rise above the  freezing point, we would believe in \"hot ice;\" not before. Until he  does, we prefer to believe that the heat conveyed through the vessel to  the ice is all absorbed in vaporizing the ice, and not in raising its  temperature above 32 deg..    Professor Carnelley's further statement, apparently proving his theory,  that the ice at once liquefies as soon as pressure is admitted (say by  admitting air), is readily accounted for by the phenomena connected with  the \"Leydenfrost Drop.\" Water in a red hot vessel will vaporize off much  slower than in a vessel heated a little above the boiling point, from  the reason that in the red hot vessel no _real contact_ takes place  between the vessel and the water. At the place where the two ought to  touch, steam is formed quicker than it can escape, which steam prevents  the contact between vessel and water; therefore, as no real contact  takes place, the heat from the vessel can pass into the water but  slowly, viz., in the proportion as it works itself through the layer of  steam, which in itself is a bad conductor. Just so in Prof. Carnelley's  experiment: The heated glass vessel will convey heat to the ice only at  those points where it touches the ice; at those points at once a  formation of vapor takes place, which prevents an intimate contact  between the glass and the ice, so that they do not really touch each  other, consequently the heat can "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21091"],[0,"The Life of William Ewart Gladstone, Vol. 1 (of 3) (#15)"],[1,", and a third sermon in the evening, for though he became the  most copious of all speakers, Mr. Gladstone was ever the most generous  of listeners. It was at St. Ebb's that he found really congenial  ministrations--an ecclesiastical centre described by him fifty years  later--under Mr. Bulteel, a man of some note in his day; here the flame  was at white heat, and a score or two of young men felt its  attractions.[44] He always remembered among the wonderful sights of his  life, St. Mary's 'crammed in all parts by all orders, when Mr. Bulteel,  an outlying calvinist, preached his accusatory sermon (some of it too  true) against the university.' In the summer of 1830, Mr. Gladstone  notes, 'Poor Bulteel has lost his church for preaching in the open air.  Pity that he should have acted so, and pity that it should be found  necessary to make such an example of a man of God.' The preacher was  impenitent, for from a window Mr. Gladstone again heard him conduct a  service for a large congregation who listened attentively to a sermon  that was interesting, but evinced some soreness of spirit. A 'most  painful' discourse from a Mr. Crowther so moves Mr. Gladstone that he  sits down to write to the preacher, 'earnestly expostulating with him on  the character and the doctrines of the sermon,' and after re-writing his  letter, he delivers it with his own hand at the door of the displeasing  divine. The effect was not other than salutary, for a little later he  was 'happy to hear two sermons of good principles from Mr. Crowther.' To  his father, October 27, 1830:--'Dr. Chalmers has been passing through  Oxford, and I went to hear him preach on Sunday evening, though it was  at the baptist chapel.... I need hardly say that his sermon was  admirable, and quite as remarkable for the judicious and sober manner in  which he enforced his views, as for their lofty principles and piety. He  preached, I think, for an hour and forty minutes.' The admiration thus  first aroused only grew with fuller knowledge in the coming years.                                 ESSAY CLUB    An Essay Club, called from its founder's initials the WEG, was formed at  a meeting in Gaskell's rooms in October, 1829. Only two members out of  the first twelve did not belong to Christ Church, Rogers of Oriel and  Moncreiff of New.[45] The Essay Club's transactions, though not very  serious, deserve a glance. Mr. Gladstone reads an essay (Feb. 20, 1830)  on the comparative rank of poetry and philosophy, concluding with a  motion that the rank of philosophy is higher than that of poetry: it was  beaten by seven to five. Without a division, they determined that  English poetry is of a higher order than Greek. The truth of the  principles of phrenology was affirmed with the tremendous emphasis of  eleven to one. Though trifling in degree, the influence of the modern  drama was pronounced in quality pernicious. Gladstone gave his casting  vote against the capacious proposition, of which philosophers had made  so much in France, Switzerland, and other places on the eve of the  French revolution, that education and other outward circumstances have  more than nature to do with man's disposition. By four to three, Mr.  Tennyson's poems were affirmed to show considerable genius, Gladstone  happily in the too slender majority. The motion that 'political liberty  is not to be considered as the end of government' was a great affair.  Maurice, who had been admitted to the club on coming to Oxford from  Cambridge, moved an amendment 'that every man has a right to perform  certain personal duties with which no system of government has a right  to interfere.' Gladstone 'objected to an observation that had fallen  from the mover, \"A man finds himself in the world,\" as if he did not  come into the world under a debt to his parents, under obligations to  society.' The tame motion of Lord Abercorn, that Elizabeth's conduct to  Mary Queen of Scots was unjustifiable and impolitic, was stiffened into  'not only unjustifiable and impolitic, but a base and treacherous  murder,' and in that severe form was carried without a division.    Plenty of nonsense was talked we may be sure, and so there was, no  doubt, in the Olive Grove of Academe or amid those surnamed Peripatetics  and the Sect Epicurean. Yet nonsense notwithstanding, the Essay Club had  members who proved in time to have superior minds if ever men had, and  their disputations in one another's rooms helped to sharpen their mental  apparatus, to start trains of ideas however immature, and to shake the  cherished dogmatisms brought from beloved homes, even if dogmatism as  stringent took their place. This is how the world moves, and Oxford was  just beginning to rub its eyes, awaking to the speculations of a new  time.    When he looked back in after times, Mr. Gladstone traced one great  defect in the education of Oxford. 'Perhaps it was my own fault, but I  must admit that I did not learn when I was at Oxford that which I have  learned since--namely, to set a due value on the imperishable and  inestimable principle of British liberty. The temper which too much  prevailed in academical circles was that liberty was regarded with  jealousy and fear, something which could not wholly be dispensed with,  but which was to be continually watched for fear of excesses.'[46]                                       III                      TRIES FOR THE IRELAND SCHOLARSHIP    In March 1830 Gladstone made the first of two attempts to win the  scholarship newly founded by Dean Ireland, and from the beginning one of  the most coveted of university prizes. In 1830 (March 16) he  wrote:--'There is it appears smaller chance than ever of its falling out  of the hands of the Shrewsbury people. There is a very formidable one  indeed, by name Scott, come up from Christ Church. If it is to go among  them I hope he may get it.' This was Robert Scott, afterwards master of  Balliol, and then dean of Rochester, and the coadjutor with Dean Liddell  in the famous Greek Lexicon brought out in 1843. A year later he tried  again, but little better success came either to himself or to Scott. He  tells his father the story (March 16th, 1831) and collegians who have  fought such battles may care to hear it:--         I must first tell you that I am _not_ the successful candidate, and       after this I shall have nothing to communicate but what will, I       think, give you pleasure. The scholarship has been won by (I       believe) a native of Liverpool.[47] His name is Brancker, and he is       now actually at Shrewsbury, but had matriculated here though he had       not come up to reside. This result has excited immense surprise.       For my own part, I went into the examination _solely_ depending for       any hope of pre-eminence above the Shrewsbury men on three points,       Greek history, one particular kind of Greek verses, and Greek       philosophy.... It so fell out, however, that not one of these three       points was brought to bear on the examination, though, indeed, it       is but a lame one without them. Accordingly from the turn it seemed       to take as it proceeded, my own expectations regularly declined,       and I thought I might consider myself very well off if I came in       pretty high. As it is, I am even with the great competitor, Scott,       whom everybody almost thought the favourite candidate, and above       the others. Allies, an Eton man, Scott and I are placed together;       and Short, one of the examiners, told us this morning that it was       an extremely near thing, and he had great difficulty in making up       his mind, which he never had felt in any former examination in       which he had been engaged; and indeed he laid the preference given       to Brancker chiefly on his having written short and concise       answers, while ours were longwinded. And in consideration of its       having been so closely contested, the vice-chancellor is to present       each of us with a set of books.... Something however may fairly       enough be attributed to the fact that at Eton we were not educated       for such objects as these.... The result will affect the       scholarship itself more than any individual character; for previous       events have created, and this has contributed amazingly to       strengthen, a prevalent impression that the Shrewsbury system is       radically a false one, and that its object is not to educate the       mind but merely to cram and stuff it for these purposes. However,       we who are beaten are not fair judges.... I only trust that you       will not be more annoyed than I am by this event.    Brancker was said to have won because he answered all the questions not  only shortly, but most of them right, and Mr. Gladstone's essay was  marked 'desultory beyond belief.' Below Allies came Sidney Herbert, then  at Oriel, and Grove, afterwards a judge and an important name in the  history of scientific speculation.    He was equally unsuccessful in another field of competition. He sent in  a poem on Richard Coeur de Lion for the Newdigate prize in 1829. In 1893  somebody asked his leave to reprint it, and at Mr. Gladstone's request  sent him a copy:--         On perusing it I was very much struck by the contrast it exhibited       between the faculty of versification which (I thought) was good,       and the faculty of poetry, which was very defective. This faculty       of verse had been trained I suppose by verse-making at Eton, and       was based upon the possession of a good or tolerable ear with which       nature had endowed me. I think that a poetical faculty did develop       itself in me a little later, that is to say between twenty and       thirty, due perhaps to having read Dante with a real devotion and       absorption. It was, however, in my view, true but weak, and has       never got beyond that stage. It was evidently absent from the       verses, I will not say the "]]]
