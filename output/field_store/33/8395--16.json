When the great khan is seated at dinner in the principal dining-hall,  the table of which is eight cubits in length, and the cups are on  the floor ten paces from the table, filled with wine, milk, and  other good beverages, these clever magicians, by their arts, make  these cups rise by themselves, and without any one touching them,  they are placed before the great khan. This has been done before an  immense number of people, and is the exact truth; and those skilled  in necromancy will tell you that it is quite possible to do this.\"    Marco Polo next gives a history of Kublai, whom he considers to  possess more lands and treasures than any man since our first father,  Adam. He tells how the great khan ascended the throne in the year  1256, being then eighty-five; he was a man of middle height, rather  stout, but of a fine figure, with a good complexion and black eyes.  He was a good commander in war, and his talents were put to the  proof when his uncle Naian, having rebelled against him, wished to  dispute his power at the head of 400,000 cavalry. Kublai-Khan  collected (in secret) a force of 300,000 horsemen, and 100,000  foot-soldiers, and marched against his uncle. The battle was a most  terrible one, so many men being killed, but the khan was victorious,  and Naian, as a prince of the blood royal, was condemned to be sewn  up tightly in a carpet, and died in great suffering. After his  victory the khan made a triumphal entry into Cathay, capital of  Cambaluc, or, as it is now called, Pekin. When Marco Polo arrived at  this city he made a long stay there, remaining until the emperor  needed his services to undertake various missions into the interior  of China. The emperor had a splendid palace at Cambaluc, and the  traveller gives so graphic an account of the riches and magnificence  of the Mongol sovereigns, that we give it word for word. \"The palace  is surrounded by a great wall, a mile long each way, four miles in  length altogether, very thick, ten feet in height, all white and  battlemented. At each corner of this wall is a palace beautiful and  rich, in which all the trappings of war belonging to the great khan  are kept; his bows, quivers, the saddles and bridles of the horses,  the bow-strings, in fact everything that would be wanted in time of  war; in the midst of each square is another building, like those at  the corner, so that there are eight in all, and each building  contains one particular kind of harness or trapping. In the wall on  the south side are five doors, the middle or large door only being  opened when the emperor wishes to go in or out; near this great gate  on either side is a smaller one through which other people may pass,  and two others for the same purpose. Inside this wall is another,  having also eight buildings to be used in the same manner.\"    [Illustration: Plan of Pekin.]    Thus we see that all these buildings constituted the emperor's  armoury and harness-store; we shall not be surprised that there was  so much harness to be kept when we know that the emperor possessed a  race of horses white as snow, and among them ten thousand mares,  whose milk was reserved for the sole use of princes of the blood  royal.    [Illustration: The Emperor's palace at Pekin.]    Marco Polo continues his narrative thus:--\"The inner wall has five  gates on the south side, answering to those in the outer wall, but  on the other sides the walls have only one gate each. In the centre  of the enclosure made by these walls, stands the palace, the largest  in the world. It has no second story, but the ground-floor is raised  about eight feet above the ground. The roof is very high, the walls  of the rooms are covered with gold and silver, and on this gold and  silver are paintings of dragons, birds, horses, and other animals,  so that nothing can be seen but gilding and pictures. The  dining-hall is large enough to hold 6000 men, and the number of  other rooms is marvellous, and all is so well arranged that it could  not be improved. The ceilings are painted vermillion, green, blue,  yellow, and all kinds of colours, varnished so as to shine like  crystal, and the roof is so well built that it will last for many  years. Between the two walls the land is laid out in fields with  fine trees in them, containing different species of animals, the  musk-ox, white deer, roe-buck, fallow-deer, and other animals, who  fill the space between the walls, except the roads reserved for  human beings. On the north-western side is a great lake, full of  fishes of divers kinds, for the great khan has had several species  placed there, and each time that he desires it to be done, he has  his will in it. A river rises in this lake and flows out from the  grounds of the palace, but no fish escape in it, there being iron  and brass nets to prevent their doing so. On the northern side, near  an arched doorway, the emperor has had a mound made, a hundred feet  in height and more than a mile in circumference; it is covered with  evergreen trees, and the emperor, being very fond of horticulture,  whenever he hears of a fine tree, sends for it and has it brought by  his elephants, with the roots and surrounding soil, the size of the  tree being no impediment, and thus he has the finest collection of  trees in the world. The hill is called 'green hill,' from its being  covered with evergreen trees and green turf, and on the top of the  hill is a house. This hill is altogether so beautiful that it is the  admiration of every one.\"    After Marco Polo has concluded his description of this palace, he  gives one of that of the emperor's son and heir; then he speaks of  the town of Cambaluc, the old town which is separated from the  modern town of Taidu by a canal, the same which divides the Chinese  and Tartar quarters of Pekin. The traveller gives many particulars  of the emperor's habits, and among other things, he says that  Kublai-Khan has a body-guard of 2000 horse-soldiers; but he adds,  \"it is not fear that causes him to keep this guard.\" His meals are  real ceremonies, and etiquette is most rigidly enforced. His table  is raised above the others, and he always sits on the north side  with his principal wife on his right, and lower down his sons,  nephews, and relations; he is waited upon by noble barons, who are  careful to envelope their mouths and noses in fine cloth of gold,  \"so that their breath and their odour may not contaminate the food  or drink of their lord.\" When the emperor is about to drink, a band  of music plays, and when he takes the cup in his hand, all the  barons and every one present, fall on their knees.    The principal fetes given by the grand khan were on the anniversary  of his birth, and on the first day of the year. At the first, 12,000  barons were accustomed to assemble round the throne, and to them  were presented annually 150,000 garments made of gold and silk and  ornamented with pearls, whilst the subjects, idolaters as well as  Christians, offered up public prayers. At the second of these fetes,  on the first day of the year, the whole population, men and women  alike, appeared dressed in white, following the tradition that white  brings good fortune, and every one brought gifts to the king of  great value. One hundred thousand richly-caparisoned horses, five  thousand elephants covered with handsome cloths and carrying the  imperial plate, as well as a large number of camels, passed in  procession before the emperor.    During the three winter months of December, January, and February,  when the khan is living in his winter palace, all the nobles within  a radius of sixty days' march are obliged to supply him with boars,  stags, fallow-deer, roes, and bears. Besides, Kublai is a great  huntsman himself, and his hunting-train is superbly mounted and kept  up. He has leopards, lynxes and fine lions trained to hunt for wild  animals, eagles strong enough to chase wolves, foxes, fallow and  roe-deer, and, as Marco Polo says, \"often to take them too,\" and his  dogs may be counted by thousands. It is about March when the emperor  begins his principal hunting in the direction of the sea, and he is  accompanied by no less than 10,000 falconers, 500 gerfalcons, and  many goshawks, peregrine, and sacred falcons. During the hunting  excursion, a portable palace, covered outside with lions' skins and  inside with cloth of gold, and carried on four elephants harnessed  together, accompanies the emperor everywhere, who seems to enjoy all  this oriental pomp and display. He goes as far as the camp of  Chachiri-Mongou, which is situated on a stream, a tributary of the  river Amoor, and the tent is set up, which is large enough to hold  ten thousand nobles. This is his reception-saloon where he gives  audiences; and when he wishes to sleep he goes into a tent which is  hung all round with ermine and sable furs of almost priceless value.  The emperor lives thus till about Easter, hunting cranes, swans,  hares, stags, roebucks, &c., and then returns to his capital,  Cambaluc.    Marco Polo now completes his description of this fine city and  enumerates the twelve quarters it contains, in many of which the  rich merchants have their palatial houses, for commerce flourishes  in this town, and more valuable merchandise is brought to it than to  any other in the world. It is the depot and market for the richest  productions of India, such as pearls and precious stones, and  merchants come from long distances round to purchase them. The khan  has established a mint here for the benefit of trade, and it is an  inexhaustible source of revenue to him. The bank-notes, sealed with  the emperor's seal, are made of a kind of card-board manufactured  from the bark of the mulberry-tree. The card-board thus prepared is  cut into various thicknesses according to the value of the money it  is supposed to represent. The currency of this money is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24780"],[0,"The Letters of Queen Victoria : A Selection from her Majesty's correspondence (#15)"],[1,"Laws.    If the opinions of his colleagues had been in concurrence with his  own, he was fully prepared to take the responsibility of suspension,  and of the necessary consequence of suspension, a comprehensive review  of the laws imposing restrictions on the import of foreign grain and  other articles of food, with a view to their gradual diminution and  ultimate removal. He was disposed to recommend that any new laws to be  enacted should contain within themselves the principle of gradual and  ultimate removal.    Sir Robert Peel is prepared to support in a private capacity measures  which may be in general conformity with those which he advised as a  Minister.    It would be unbecoming in Sir Robert Peel to make any reference to the  details of such measures.    Your Majesty has been good enough to inform him that it is your  intention to propose to Lord John Russell to undertake the formation  of a Government.    The principle on which Sir Robert Peel was prepared to recommend the  reconsideration of the laws affecting the import of the main articles  of food, was in general accordance with that referred to in the  concluding paragraph of Lord John Russell's letter to the electors of  the City of London.[32]    Sir Robert Peel wished to accompany the removal of restrictions on the  admission of such articles, with relief to the land from such charges  as are unduly onerous, and with such other provisions as in the terms  of Lord John Russell's letter \"caution and even scrupulous forbearance  may suggest.\"    Sir Robert Peel will support measures founded on that general  principle, and will exercise any influence he may possess to promote  their success.    Sir Robert Peel feels it to be his duty to add, that should your  Majesty's servants, after consideration of the heavy demands upon the  Army of this country for colonial service, of our relations with the  United States, and of the bearing which steam navigation may have upon  maritime warfare, and the defence of the country, deem it advisable  to propose an addition to the Army, and increased naval and military  estimates, Sir Robert Peel will support the proposal, will do all that  he can to prevent it from being considered as indicative of hostile  or altered feeling towards France, and will assume for the increase in  question any degree of responsibility present or retrospective which  can fairly attach to him.    ROBERT PEEL.        [Footnote 32: That paragraph urged that, with a revision      of taxation to make the arrangement more equitable, and the      safeguards suggested by caution and scrupulous forbearance,      restrictions on the admission of the main articles of food and      clothing used by the mass of the people should be removed.]          [Pageheading: LORD STANLEY RESIGNS]      _Lord Stanley to Queen Victoria._    ST JAMES'S SQUARE, _11th December 1845._    ... Lord Stanley humbly hopes that he may be permitted to avail  himself of this opportunity to express to your Majesty the deep regret  and pain with which he has felt himself compelled to dissent from the  advice intended to have been tendered to your Majesty on the subject  of the Corn Laws. He begs to assure your Majesty that he would have  shrunk from making no personal sacrifice, short of that of principle,  for the purpose of avoiding the inconvenience to your Majesty and to  the country inseparable from any change of Administration; but being  unconvinced of the necessity of a change of policy involving an  abandonment of opinions formerly maintained, and expectations held  out to political supporters, he felt that the real interests of  your Majesty's service could not be promoted by the loss of personal  character which the sacrifice of his own convictions would necessarily  have involved; and that he might far more usefully serve your Majesty  and the country out of office, than as the official advocate of a  policy which he could not sincerely approve. Lord Stanley begs to  assure your Majesty that it will be his earnest endeavour to allay,  as far as may lie in his power, the excitement which he cannot but  foresee as the consequence of the contemplated change of policy; and  he ventures to indulge the hope that this long trespass upon your  Majesty's much occupied time may find a sufficient apology in the deep  anxiety which he feels that his regret at being compelled not only to  retire from your Majesty's service, but also to take a step which he  is aware may have had some influence on the course finally adopted  by Sir Robert Peel, may not be still farther increased by the  apprehension of having, in the performance of a most painful duty,  incurred your Majesty's displeasure. All which is humbly submitted by  your Majesty's most dutiful Servant and Subject,    STANLEY.          _Queen Victoria to Lord Stanley._    OSBORNE, _12th December 1845._    The Queen, of course, _much regrets_ that Lord Stanley could not agree  in the opinions of Sir Robert Peel upon a subject of such importance  to the country. However, Lord Stanley may rest assured that the Queen  gives full credit to the disinterested motives which guided Lord  Stanley's conduct.          [Pageheading: THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF]      _Queen Victoria to the Duke of Wellington._    OSBORNE, _12th December 1845._    The Queen has to inform the Duke of Wellington that, in consequence of  Sir Robert Peel's having declared to her his inability to carry on any  longer the Government, she has sent for Lord John Russell, who is not  able at present to state whether he can form an Administration, and is  gone to Town in order to consult his friends. Whatever the result of  his enquiries may be, the Queen has a _strong_ desire to see the Duke  of Wellington remain at the head of her Army. The Queen appeals to the  Duke's so often proved loyalty and attachment to her person, in asking  him to give her this assurance. The Duke will thereby render the  greatest service to the country and to her own person.          [Pageheading: THE DUKE'S ADVICE]      _The Duke of Wellington to Queen Victoria._    STRATHFIELDSAYE, _12th December 1845._    (_11 at night._)    Field-Marshal the Duke of Wellington presents his humble duty to your  Majesty; he has just now received your Majesty's commands from Osborne  of this day's date.    He humbly submits to your Majesty that the duties of the  Commander-in-Chief of your Majesty's Land Forces places him in  constant confidential relations with all your Majesty's Ministers,  and particularly with the one filling the office of First Lord of the  Treasury.    Under these circumstances he submits to your Majesty the counsel, that  your Majesty would be graciously pleased to consult the nobleman or  gentleman who should be your Majesty's first Minister, before any  other step should be taken upon the subject. He might think that he  had reason to complain if he should find that it was arranged that  the Duke of Wellington should continue to fill the office of  Commander-in-Chief, and such impression might have an influence upon  his future relations with that office.    Field-Marshal the Duke of Wellington believes that Lord John Russell  and all your Majesty's former Ministers were aware, that during  the whole period of the time during which Lord Hill was the General  Commanding-in-Chief your Majesty's Forces, the professional opinion  and services of Field-Marshal the Duke of Wellington were at all times  at the command and disposition of your Majesty's servants, and were  given whenever required.    He happened to be at that time in political opposition to the  Government in the House of Parliament, of which he was a member; but  that circumstance made no difference.    It is impossible for the Duke of Wellington to form a political  connection with Lord John Russell, or to have any relation with the  political course of the Government over which he should preside.    Such arrangement would not conciliate public confidence, be considered  creditable to either party, or be useful to the service of your  Majesty.    Nor, indeed, would the performance of the duties of the  Commander-in-Chief of the Army require that such should exist; on the  other hand, the performance of these duties would require that the  person filling the office should avoid to belong to, or to act in  concert with, a political party opposed to the Government.    Field-Marshal the Duke of Wellington has considered it his duty  to submit these considerations, in order that your Majesty may be  perfectly aware of the position in which he is about to place himself,  in case Lord John Russell should counsel your Majesty to command  Field-Marshal the Duke of Wellington to continue to hold the office of  Commander-in-Chief of your Majesty's Land Forces.    He at once submits to your Majesty the assurance that he will  cheerfully devote his service to your Majesty's command upon receiving  the official intimation thereof, and that he will as usual make every  effort in his power to promote your Majesty's service.    All of which is humbly submitted to your Majesty by your Majesty's  most dutiful Subject and devoted Servant,    WELLINGTON.
