How is our movable  property to be got hold of now? It consists of printed papers which  are locked up somewhere or other in the world, perhaps in the coffers  of Christians. It is, of course, possible to get at shares and  debentures in railways, banks and industrial undertakings of all  descriptions by taxation, and where the progressive income-tax is in  force all our movable property can eventually be laid hold of. But all  these efforts cannot be directed against Jews alone, and wherever they  might nevertheless be made, severe economic crises would be their  immediate consequences, which would be by no means confined to the  Jews who would be the first affected. The very impossibility of  getting at the Jews nourishes and embitters hatred of them.  Anti-Semitism increases day by day and hour by hour among the nations;  indeed, it is bound to increase, because the causes of its growth  continue to exist and cannot be removed. Its remote cause is our loss  of the power of assimilation during the Middle Ages; its immediate  cause is our excessive production of mediocre intellects, who cannot  find an outlet downwards or upwards--that is to say, no wholesome  outlet in either direction. When we sink, we become a revolutionary  proletariat, the subordinate officers of all revolutionary parties;  and at the same time, when we rise, there rises also our terrible  power of the purse.      EFFECTS OF ANTI-SEMITISM    The oppression we endure does not improve us, for we are not a whit  better than ordinary people. It is true that we do not love our  enemies; but he alone who can conquer himself dare reproach us with  that fault. Oppression naturally creates hostility against oppressors,  and our hostility aggravates the pressure. It is impossible to escape  from this eternal circle.    \"No!\" Some soft-hearted visionaries will say: \"No, it is possible!  Possible by means of the ultimate perfection of humanity.\"    Is it necessary to point to the sentimental folly of this view? He who  would found his hope for improved conditions on the ultimate  perfection of humanity would indeed be relying upon a Utopia!    I referred previously to our \"assimilation\". I do not for a moment  wish to imply that I desire such an end. Our national character is too  historically famous, and, in spite of every degradation, too fine to  make its annihilation desirable. We might perhaps be able to merge  ourselves entirely into surrounding races, if these were to leave us  in peace for a period of two generations. But they will not leave us  in peace. For a little period they manage to tolerate us, and then  their hostility breaks out again and again. The world is provoked  somehow by our prosperity, because it has for many centuries been  accustomed to consider us as the most contemptible among the  poverty-stricken. In its ignorance and narrowness of heart, it fails  to observe that prosperity weakens our Judaism and extinguishes our  peculiarities. It is only pressure that forces us back to the parent  stem; it is only hatred encompassing us that makes us strangers once  more.    Thus, whether we like it or not, we are now, and shall henceforth  remain, a historic group with unmistakable characteristics common to  us all.    We are one people--our enemies have made us one without our consent,  as repeatedly happens in history. Distress binds us together, and,  thus united, we suddenly discover our strength. Yes, we are strong  enough to form a State, and, indeed, a model State. We possess all  human and material resources necessary for the purpose.    This is therefore the appropriate place to give an account of what has  been somewhat roughly termed our \"human material.\" But it would not be  appreciated till the broad lines of the plan, on which everything  depends, has first been marked out.      THE PLAN    The whole plan is in its essence perfectly simple, as it must  necessarily be if it is to come within the comprehension of all.    Let the sovereignty be granted us over a portion of the globe large  enough to satisfy the rightful requirements of a nation; the rest we  shall manage for ourselves.    The creation of a new State is neither ridiculous nor impossible. We  have in our day witnessed the process in connection with nations which  were not largely members of the middle class, but poorer, less  educated, and consequently weaker than ourselves. The Governments of  all countries scourged by Anti-Semitism will be keenly interested in  assisting us to obtain the sovereignty we want.    The plan, simple in design, but complicated in execution, will be  carried out by two agencies: The Society of Jews and the Jewish  Company.    The Society of Jews will do the preparatory work in the domains of  science and politics, which the Jewish Company will afterwards apply  practically.    The Jewish Company will be the liquidating agent of the business  interests of departing Jews, and will organize commerce and trade in  the new country.    We must not imagine the departure of the Jews to be a sudden one. It  will be gradual, continuous, and will cover many decades. The poorest  will go first to cultivate the soil. In accordance with a preconceived  plan, they will construct roads, bridges, railways and telegraph  installations; regulate rivers; and build their own dwellings; their  labor will create trade, trade will create markets and markets will  attract new settlers, for every man will go voluntarily, at his own  expense and his own risk. The labor expended on the land will enhance  its value, and the Jews will soon perceive that a new and permanent  sphere of operation is opening here for that spirit of enterprise  which has heretofore met only with hatred and obloquy.    If we wish to found a State today, we shall not do it in the way which  would have been the only possible one a thousand years ago. It is  foolish to revert to old stages of civilization, as many Zionists  would like to do. Supposing, for example, we were obliged to clear a  country of wild beasts, we should not set about the task in the  fashion of Europeans of the fifth century. We should not take spear  and lance and go out singly in pursuit of bears; we would organize a  large and active hunting party, drive the animals together, and throw  a melinite bomb into their midst.    If we wish to conduct building operations, we shall not plant a mass  of stakes and piles on the shore of a lake, but we shall build as men  build now. Indeed, we shall build in a bolder and more stately style  than was ever adopted before, for we now possess means which men never  yet possessed.    The emigrants standing lowest in the economic scale will be slowly  followed by those of a higher grade. Those who at this moment are  living in despair will go first. They will be led by the mediocre  intellects which we produce so superabundantly and which are  persecuted everywhere.    This pamphlet will open a general discussion on the Jewish Question,  but that does not mean that there will be any voting on it. Such a  result would ruin the cause from the outset, and dissidents must  remember that allegiance or opposition is entirely voluntary. He who  will not come with us should remain behind.    Let all who are willing to join us, fall in behind our banner and  fight for our cause with voice and pen and deed.    Those Jews who agree with our idea of a State will attach themselves  to the Society, which will thereby be authorized to confer and treat  with Governments in the name of our people. The Society will thus be  acknowledged in its relations with Governments as a State-creating  power. This acknowledgment will practically create the State.    Should the Powers declare themselves willing to admit our sovereignty  over a neutral piece of land, then the Society will enter into  negotiations for the possession of this land. Here two territories  come under consideration, Palestine and Argentine. In both countries  important experiments in colonization have been made, though on the  mistaken principle of a gradual infiltration of Jews. An infiltration  is bound to end badly. It continues till the inevitable moment when  the native population feels itself threatened, and forces the  Government to stop a further influx of Jews. Immigration is  consequently futile unless we have the sovereign right to continue  such immigration.    The Society of Jews will treat with the present masters of the land,  putting itself under the protectorate of the European Powers, if they  prove friendly to the plan. We could offer the present possessors of  the land enormous advantages, assume part of the public debt, build  new roads for traffic, which our presence in the country would render  necessary, and do many other things. The creation of our State would  be beneficial to adjacent countries, because the cultivation of a  strip of land increases the value of its surrounding districts in  innumerable ways.      PALESTINE OR ARGENTINE?    Shall we choose Palestine or Argentine? We shall take what is given  us, and what is selected by Jewish public opinion. The Society will  determine both these points.    Argentine is one of the most fertile countries in the world, extends  over a vast area, has a sparse population and a mild climate. The  Argentine Republic would derive considerable profit from the cession  of a portion of its territory to us. The present infiltration of Jews  has certainly produced some discontent, and it would be necessary to  enlighten the Republic on the intrinsic difference of our new  movement.    Palestine is our ever-memorable historic home. The very name of  Palestine would attract our people with a force of marvellous potency.  If His Majesty the Sultan were to give us Palestine, we could in  return undertake to regulate the whole finances of Turkey.

I do not wish to  urge that this form of causation is ultimate, but that, in the present  state of our knowledge, it affords a simplification, and enables us  to state laws of behaviour in less hypothetical terms than we should  otherwise have to employ.    The clearest instance of what I mean is recollection of a past event.  What we observe is that certain present stimuli lead us to recollect  certain occurrences, but that at times when we are not recollecting  them, there is nothing discoverable in our minds that could be called  memory of them. Memories, as mental facts, arise from time to time,  but do not, so far as we can see, exist in any shape while they are  \"latent.\" In fact, when we say that they are \"latent,\" we mean merely  that they will exist under certain circumstances. If, then, there is  to be some standing difference between the person who can remember a  certain fact and the person who cannot, that standing difference must  be, not in anything mental, but in the brain. It is quite probable that  there is such a difference in the brain, but its nature is unknown and  it remains hypothetical. Everything that has, so far, been made matter  of observation as regards this question can be put together in the  statement: When a certain complex of sensations has occurred to a man,  the recurrence of part of the complex tends to arouse the recollection  of the whole. In like manner, we can collect all mnemic phenomena in  living organisms under a single law, which contains what is hitherto  verifiable in Semon's two laws. This single law is:    IF A COMPLEX STIMULUS A HAS CAUSED A COMPLEX REACTION B IN AN ORGANISM,  THE OCCURRENCE OF A PART OF A ON A FUTURE OCCASION TENDS TO CAUSE THE  WHOLE REACTION B.    This law would need to be supplemented by some account of the influence  of frequency, and so on; but it seems to contain the essential  characteristic of mnemic phenomena, without admixture of anything  hypothetical.    Whenever the effect resulting from a stimulus to an organism differs  according to the past history of the organism, without our being able  actually to detect any relevant difference in its present structure,  we will speak of \"mnemic causation,\" provided we can discover laws  embodying the influence of the past. In ordinary physical causation,  as it appears to common sense, we have approximate uniformities of  sequence, such as \"lightning is followed by thunder,\" \"drunkenness  is followed by headache,\" and so on. None of these sequences are  theoretically invariable, since something may intervene to disturb  them. In order to obtain invariable physical laws, we have to proceed to  differential equations, showing the direction of change at each moment,  not the integral change after a finite interval, however short. But  for the purposes of daily life many sequences are to all in tents and  purposes invariable. With the behaviour of human beings, however, this  is by no means the case. If you say to an Englishman, \"You have a smut  on your nose,\" he will proceed to remove it, but there will be no such  effect if you say the same thing to a Frenchman who knows no English.  The effect of words upon the hearer is a mnemic phenomena, since it  depends upon the past experience which gave him understanding of the  words. If there are to be purely psychological causal laws, taking no  account of the brain and the rest of the body, they will have to be of  the form, not \"X now causes Y now,\" but--    \"A, B, C,... in the past, together with X now, cause Y now.\" For it  cannot be successfully maintained that our understanding of a word, for  example, is an actual existent content of the mind at times when we  are not thinking of the word. It is merely what may be called a  \"disposition,\" i.e. it is capable of being aroused whenever we hear the  word or happen to think of it. A \"disposition\" is not something actual,  but merely the mnemic portion of a mnemic causal law.    In such a law as \"A, B, C,... in the past, together with X now, cause  Y now,\" we will call A, B, C,... the mnemic cause, X the occasion or  stimulus, and Y the reaction. All cases in which experience influences  behaviour are instances of mnemic causation.    Believers in psycho-physical parallelism hold that psychology can  theoretically be freed entirely from all dependence on physiology or  physics. That is to say, they believe that every psychical event has  a psychical cause and a physical concomitant. If there is to be  parallelism, it is easy to prove by mathematical logic that the  causation in physical and psychical matters must be of the same sort,  and it is impossible that mnemic causation should exist in psychology  but not in physics. But if psychology is to be independent of  physiology, and if physiology can be reduced to physics, it would seem  that mnemic causation is essential in psychology. Otherwise we shall be  compelled to believe that all our knowledge, all our store of images  and memories, all our mental habits, are at all times existing in some  latent mental form, and are not merely aroused by the stimuli which lead  to their display. This is a very difficult hypothesis. It seems to me  that if, as a matter of method rather than metaphysics, we desire to  obtain as much independence for psychology as is practically feasible,  we shall do better to accept mnemic causation in psychology protem,  and therefore reject parallelism, since there is no good ground for  admitting mnemic causation in physics.    It is perhaps worth while to observe that mnemic causation is what led  Bergson to deny that there is causation at all in the psychical sphere.  He points out, very truly, that the same stimulus, repeated, does not  have the same consequences, and he argues that this is contrary to the  maxim, \"same cause, same effect.\" It is only necessary, however, to take  account of past occurrences and include them with the cause, in order  to re-establish the maxim, and the possibility of psychological causal  laws. The metaphysical conception of a cause lingers in our manner of  viewing causal laws: we want to be able to FEEL a connection between  cause and effect, and to be able to imagine the cause as \"operating.\"  This makes us unwilling to regard causal laws as MERELY observed  uniformities of sequence; yet that is all that science has to offer.  To ask why such-and-such a kind of sequence occurs is either to ask a  meaningless question, or to demand some more general kind of sequence  which includes the one in question. The widest empirical laws of  sequence known at any time can only be \"explained\" in the sense of being  subsumed by later discoveries under wider laws; but these wider laws,  until they in turn are subsumed, will remain brute facts, resting solely  upon observation, not upon some supposed inherent rationality.    There is therefore no a priori objection to a causal law in which part  of the cause has ceased to exist. To argue against such a law on the  ground that what is past cannot operate now, is to introduce the old  metaphysical notion of cause, for which science can find no place. The  only reason that could be validly alleged against mnemic causation would  be that, in fact, all the phenomena can be explained without it. They  are explained without it by Semon's \"engram,\" or by any theory which  regards the results of experience as embodied in modifications of  the brain and nerves. But they are not explained, unless with extreme  artificiality, by any theory which regards the latent effects of  experience as psychical rather than physical. Those who desire to make  psychology as far as possible independent of physiology would do well,  it seems to me, if they adopted mnemic causation. For my part, however,  I have no such desire, and I shall therefore endeavour to state the  grounds which occur to me in favour of some such view as that of the  \"engram.\"    One of the first points to be urged is that mnemic phenomena are just  as much to be found in physiology as in psychology. They are even to  be found in plants, as Sir Francis Darwin pointed out (cf. Semon, \"Die  Mneme,\" 2nd edition, p. 28 n.). Habit is a characteristic of the body  at least as much as of the mind. We should, therefore, be compelled  to allow the intrusion of mnemic causation, if admitted at all, into  non-psychological regions, which ought, one feels, to be subject only to  causation of the ordinary physical sort. The fact is that a great deal  of what, at first sight, distinguishes psychology from physics is found,  on examination, to be common to psychology and physiology; this whole  question of the influence of experience is a case in point. Now it  is possible, of course, to take the view advocated by Professor J. S.  Haldane, who contends that physiology is not theoretically reducible to  physics and chemistry.* But the weight of opinion among physiologists  appears to be against him on this point; and we ought certainly to  require very strong evidence before admitting any such breach of  continuity as between living and dead matter. The argument from the  existence of mnemic phenomena in physiology must therefore be allowed a  certain weight against the hypothesis that mnemic causation is ultimate.         * See his \"The New Physiology and Other Addresses,\" Griffin,       1919, also the symposium, \"Are Physical, Biological and       Psychological Categories Irreducible?\" in \"Life and Finite       Individuality,\" edited for the Aristotelian Society, with an       Introduction. By H. Wildon Carr, Williams & Norgate, 1918.    The argument from the connection of brain-lesions with loss of memory is  not so strong as it looks, though it has also, some weight. What we  know"]]]
