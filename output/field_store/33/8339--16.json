Through these three main channels the stream of  devotion spread far and wide through the land. Like most currents of  what we call \"revivalism,\" it usually had an erotic side; and the  larger temples frequently have attached to them female staffs of  attendant votaries and _corps de ballet_ of very easy virtue. But this  aspect was far more marked in neo-Krishnaism, which often tends to  intense pruriency, than in the other two cults. The Alvars pay  little regard to the legends of Krishna, and concentrate their  energies upon the worship of Vishnu as he is represented in the great  temples of Srirangam, Conjevaram, Tirupati, and similar sanctuaries.    [Footnote 31: On this name see above, p. 86.]    About the beginning of the ninth century the peaceful course of  Vaishnava religion was rudely disturbed by the preaching of Samkara  Acharya. Samkara, one of the greatest intellects that India has ever  produced, was a Brahman of Malabar, and was born about the year 788.  Taking his stand upon the Upanishads, Brahma-sutra, and Bhagavad-gita,  upon which he wrote commentaries, he interpreted them as teaching the  doctrine of Advaita, thorough monistic idealism, teaching that the  universal Soul, Brahma, is absolutely identical with the individual  Soul, the _atma_ or Self, that all being is only one, that salvation  consists in the identification of these two, and is attained by  knowledge, the intuition of their identity, and that the phenomenal  universe or manifold of experience is simply an illusion (_maya_)  conjured up in Brahma by his congenital nature, but really alien to  him--in fact, a kind of disease in Brahma. This was not new: it had  been taught by some ancient schools of Aupanishadas, and was very like  the doctrine of some of the Buddhist idealists; but the vigour and  skill with which Samkara propagated his doctrines threatened ruin to  orthodox Vaishnava theologians, and roused them to counter-campaigns.  Among the Vaishnava Brahmans of the South who won laurels in this  field was Yamunacharya, who lived about 1050, and was the grandson of  Natha Muni, who collected the hymns of the Alvars in the  Nal-ayira-prabandham and founded the great school of Vaishnava  theology at Srirangam. In opposition to Samkara's monism, Yamunacharya  propounded the doctrine of his school, the so-called Visishtadvaita,  which was preached with still greater skill and success by his famous  successor Ramanuja, who died in 1137. Ramanuja's greatest works are  his commentaries on the Brahma-sutra and Bhagavad-gita. In them he  expounds with great ability the principles of his school, namely, that  God, sentient beings or souls, and insentient matter form three  essentially distinct classes of being; that God, who is the same as  Brahma, Vishnu, Narayana, or Krishna, is omnipotent, omnipresent, and  possessed of all good qualities; that matter forms the body of souls,  and souls form the body of God; that the soul attains salvation as a  result of devout and loving meditation upon God, worship of him, and  study of the scriptures; and that salvation consists in eternal union  of the soul with God, but not in identity with him, as Samkara taught.  The scriptures on which Ramanuja took his stand were mainly the  Upanishads, Brahma-sutra, and Bhagavad-gita; but he also acknowledged  as authoritative the Pancharatra Samhitas, in spite of their  divergences in details of doctrine, and it is from them that his  church has derived the worship of Sri or Lakshmi as consort of Vishnu,  which is a very marked feature of their community and has gained for  them the title of Sri-vaishnavas. But Ramanuja was much more than a  scholar and a writer of books; he was also a man of action, a  \"practical mystic.\" Like Samkara, he organised a body of _sannyasis_  or ascetic votaries, into which, however, he admitted only Brahmans,  whereas Samkara opened some of the sections of his devotees to  non-Brahmans; but on the other hand he was far more liberal than  Samkara in the choice of his congregations, for he endeavoured to  bring men of the lowest castes, Sudras and even Pariahs, within the  influence of his church, though he kept up the social barrier between  them and the higher castes, and he firmly upheld the principle of the  Bhagavad-gita that it is by the performance of religious and social  duties of caste, and not by knowledge alone, that salvation is most  surely to be won. He established schools and monasteries, reorganised  the worship of the temples, usually in accordance with the Pancharatra  rules, and thus placed his church in a position of such strength in  Southern India that its only serious rival is the church of Siva.    Nimbarka, who probably flourished about the first half of the twelfth  century, preached for the cult of Krishna a doctrine combining monism  with dualism, which is followed by a small sect in Northern India.  Ananda-tirtha or Madhva, in the first three quarters of the thirteenth  century, propounded for the same church a theory of thorough dualism,  which has found many admirers, chiefly in the Dekkan. Vallabhacharya,  born in 1479, founded a school of Krishna-worshippers which claims a  \"pure monism\" without the aid of the theory of _maya_, or illusion,  which is a characteristic of Samkara's monism. This community has  become very influential, chiefly in Bombay Presidency; but in recent  times it has been under a cloud owing to the scandals arising from a  tendency to practise immoral orgies and from the claims of its  priesthood, as representing the god, to enjoy the persons and property  of their congregations.    Besides these and other schools which were founded on a basis of  Sanskrit scholastic philosophy, there have been many popular religious  movements, which from the first appealed directly to the heart of the  people in their own tongues.    The first place in which we see this current in movement is the  Maratha country. Here, about 1290, Jnanesvara or Jnanadeva, popularly  known as Jnanoba, composed his Jnanesvari, a paraphrase of the  Bhagavad-gita in about 10,000 Marathi verses, as well as a number of  hymns to Krishna and a poem on the worship of Siva. To the same period  belonged Namadeva, who was born at Pandharpur, according to some in  1270 and according to others about a century later. Then came  Ekanatha, who is said to have died in 1608, and composed some hymns  and Marathi verse-translations from the Bhagavata. The greatest of all  was Tukaram, who was born about 1608.[32] In the verses of these  poets the worship of Krishna is raised to a level of high  spirituality. Ramananda, who apparently lived between 1400 and 1470  and was somehow connected with the school of Ramanuja, preached  salvation through Rama to all castes and classes of Northern India,  with immense and enduring success. To his spiritual lineage belongs  Tulsi Das (1532-1623), whose Rama-charita-manasa, a poem in Eastern  Hindi on the story of Valmiki's Ramayana, has become the Bible of the  North. The same influences are visible in the poems of Kabir, a Moslem  by birth, who combined Hindu and Muhammadan doctrines into an eclectic  monotheism, and is worshipped as an incarnation of God by his sect. He  died in 1518. A kindred spirit was Nanak, the founder of the Sikh  church (1469-1538).[33]    [Footnote 32: The student may refer to Sir R. G. Bhandarkar's  _Vaisnavas and Saivas_ (in Buehler's _Grundriss_, p. 74 ff.,) J. N.  Farquhar's _Outline of the Relig. Liter. of India_, p. 234 f., 298  ff., and my _Heart of India_, p. 60 ff., for some details on these  poets.]    [Footnote 33: See Farquhar, _ut supra_, p. 323 ff.; _Heart of India_,  p. 49 f., etc.]    By the side of these upward movements there have been many which have  remained on the older level of the Bhagavata. The most important is  that of Visvambhara Misra, who is better known by his titles of  Chaitanya and Gauranga (1485-1533); he carried on a \"revival\" of  volcanic intensity in Bengal and Orissa, and the church founded by  him is still powerful, and worships him as an incarnation of Krishna.      IV. BRAHMA AND THE TRIMURTI    _Brahma_, the Creator, a masculine noun, must be carefully  distinguished from the neuter _Brahma_, the abstract First Being. The  latter comes first in the scale of existence, while the former appears  at some distance further on as the creator of the material world (see  above, p. 60 f.). In modern days Brahma has been completely eclipsed  by Vishnu and Siva and even by some minor deities, and has now only  four temples dedicated to his exclusive worship.[34] But there was a  time when he was a great god. In the older parts of the Mahabharata  and Ramayana he figures as one of the greater deities, perhaps the  greatest. But in the later portions of the epic he has shrunk into  comparative insignificance as compared to Vishnu and Siva, and  especially to Vishnu. This change faithfully reflects historical  facts. During the last four or five centuries of the millennium which  ended with the Christian era the orthodox Vedic religion of the  Brahmans had steadily lost ground, and the sects worshipping Vishnu  and Siva had correspondingly grown in power and finally had come to  be recognised as themselves orthodox. Brahma, as his name implies, is  the ideal Brahman sage, and typifies Vedic orthodoxy. He is  represented as everlastingly chanting the four Vedas from his four  mouths (for he has four heads), and he bears the water-pot and rosary  of eleocarpus berries, the symbols of the Brahman ascetic. But Vedic  orthodoxy had to make way for more fascinating cults, and the Vedic  Brahman typified in the god Brahma sank into comparative unimportance  beside the sectarian ascetics. Still the old god, though shorn of much  of his glory, was by no means driven from the field. The new"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22886"],[0,"Cinderella in the South: Twenty-Five South African Tales (#15)"],[1,"seen better days at a tithe of the expense, oppressed him.    However, the tickets had been taken, and the splendidly null  organization of their party had him in its grip. He went back  from the Falls to Bulawayo, and was whisked out to Khami. Only an  hour was allowed him to see the river. At the grave of the  Matopos, he was allowed two hours. There a brooding Presence  grappled with the languors of his pilgrimage. The demoniac  discontent of that savage scene made great play with him, during  the two hours he was there, but two hours are not a very long  time. Soon they were scorching back again with an interval for  tea at a well (or ill) appointed hotel. Vine was disposed to give  up the dreary pilgrimage-game that very night, he told me. But  the born organizer, coming to him after dinner, persuaded him to  play it out. He offered to release him after the next lap the lap  of Great Zimbabwe. When that was once finished to time, he  proposed that the party should have a breather, a short spell of  civilized life at Salisbury, should it so seem good to them. Vine  could be spared for the space of that interlude. Afterwards he  would doubtless take boat with them for a cruise up the East  Coast. He would be sufficiently reinvigorated to rough it out  with them rigorously to the end. The East Coast route might not  entail quite so many hardships. Vine sighed, but he was a man of  his word. He went to Zimbabwe without a murmur. He had longed for  seventy-five miles of the dusty Umvuma post-cart, but alas, the  day was the third of the new month! The railway extension to  Victoria had been opened on the first. The organizer rubbed his  hands as he told them the glad news: 'We can have a dining-car  and sleeping berths now to within sixteen miles odd of the ruins.  We shan't need to fare so ruggedly after all. A lunch at the  \"Apes and Peacocks\" Hotel is about the worst of it. But we can  take out a Fortnum and Mason's hamper in the road-car that meets  us.'    So they went to the ruins. Vine, who, as a pioneer had seen the  'Temple's' torso shaggy in bush and long grass, hardly knew it  again. It had been shaven and shorn rather ruthlessly. Some of  the ruins, he noted ungratefully, were numbered to correspond  with a catalogue. There was, moreover, the glamorous sheen of a  wire fence about the whole place.    A curator participated as guide by special arrangement. A local  celebrity accompanied him; he stood for the faith of Ophir, and  smote the Egyptologist adversary not once nor twice alone. He  confessed to the ladies of the party his conviction that the  theory of an African origin was too inconceivably squalid. He  stood for the gorgeous East, he said, as against Kaffirdom. He  would not insult the culture that they brought with them by  bothering them with detailed arguments.    Meanwhile another local celebrity was employed in bossing up some  restoration work. Primitive walls were receiving trained modern  attention, and medical attendance, regardless of expense.    Vine came to me at Umvuma when the Zimbabwe visitation was over  and done. He was seeing his party off by the Salisbury train  when he caught sight of me on the platform. That night he smoked  and slept by an ox-wagon. Bread was to hand in rather frugal  measure, but there was great plenty of monkey-nuts. There was  also bush-tea, and Vine brought much tobacco. We smoked till long  after the moon set, and that was near midnight. He told me of  disappointments that had come to him through his pilgrimage being  over well-appointed.    'After all,' I said, 'you might try again next year.'    'But a year's a lot at my age. I was forty-five last month, and I  don't mean coming out again.    'So little done, so much to do, So many worlds, such things to  be.'    'Where shall we go to this week?' he went on. 'I've got a week  off from the Cook's combination. You'll give me the one week,  won't you Shall we go to Dhlo-Dhlo or Nanatali or Sinoia Caves?  It's the curse of our Cook's tour that it's mopped up the sacred  places I did want to see in a decent way the Grave, and the  Temple, and the Falls.'    'Yours is the very snobbery of pilgrimage,' I told him sternly.  'There are surely shrines on the veld that have never yet got  into a Chartered Company's guide-book.' I told him of a modest  set of ruins out our way. I couldn't well come with him in any  direction, north, south, or east or west, as he seemed to think I  could. I might get in five days between Sunday and Sunday, if he  chose our own neighborhood. He seemed glad enough to agree.    We cut food down and loads, and we started. We camped within the  precincts of the shrine, hard by a place where a fire-fused  chalice had been dug out. Ours was a fair camping-ground. A ring  of kopjes about it wore the sun's colors. To the east a spruit  was in sight, overhung in that autumn month by the mists of  morning. Within those precincts we dreamed some temple-dreams on  two golden afternoons, and slept temple-sleep on two very shiny  nights.    'My reformed pilgrimage has justified itself,' Vine told me on  the morning that we left, when we were making for my station.    'Wait a bit,' I said. 'We are arriving if all falls well, this  very night at another shrine. We have not done with our Pilgrims'  Way.'    That night we came to the farm-house where the Kents farmed and  missionized. I had expected Vine to like it and them, but I had  not guessed how much attracted he would be. The Kents were not  up-to-date, and they dressed as some people dressed in England  twenty-five years before in the period of their leaving home.    So Mrs. Kent wore on that night a chocolate-brown Liberty costume  of a Burne Jones pattern. Miss Kent was only twenty-two, and wore  rose-color, but the design of her dress was her mother's own.  Kent wore an eighties collar with old-oak plaid and a red tie, I  did not like his taste.    Vine sat and watched them with a reverential sort of gaze. He  asked Kent when they were going home, thoughtfully. But Kent told  him that they did not think of going home again, only up the  coast to Zanzibar, or down to Inhambane, when they wanted change  and holiday. 'That's splendid,' said Vine emphatically. 'Don't go  home. It's not what it used to be. I feel sure you would not like  it.'    After supper we had music, and Kent kept on singing, at Vine's  particular request. I did not take much notice of what he was  singing till Vine came and spoke to me. Then I saw how excited he  was, and I listened with attention.    'Do you remember that?' he said. 'It was the song that Oriel man  used to sing.' Then I recognized 'Our Last Waltz,' and afterwards  'In Sweet September.' I remembered both as the songs of a man  whose wedding we both had attended, in the very year that we went  down.    We shared a hut behind the mission homestead, and shared much  converse before we slept.    'It's purple and gold,' Vine said. 'I came out to find a beastly  ruin.'    'And you find the Victorian Sixth Decade mummified,' I said.    'Don't sneer!'    'Well, pressed in lavender,' I amended.    For early did'st thou leave the world, with powers  Fresh, undiverted to the world without,  Firm to their mark, not spent on other things;  Free from the sick fatigue, the languid doubt,  Which much to have tried, in much been baffled, brings.    'That describes Kent's Hegira, doesn't it? He's stopped where we  two were, when we went down, in ever so many ways.'    'Hurray!' cried Vine, tossing his boot up, 'I came out to find a  beastly ruin, and I've found my lost youth, nothing more nor  less! Bless you!'    But his ecstasy was to culminate on the following morning. Kent  had mounted him on one of his two mules, and piloted him on the  other to see some Bush paintings three miles away.    I grew a little uneasy, they were so long gone, for I knew well  what a lot of country lay between us and my own mission station.  I was due there by sunrise or soon after, on the morrow. Mrs.  Kent was strumming away on the piano old dance tunes that I  remembered barrel-organ melodies of now remote days, days when a  bi-weekly shave sufficed me. I stood in the doorway and beat  time. Whenever were we going to get started at this rate? At last  the mules came cantering up the wagon-road.    'Get a move on,' I shouted to Vine as he pulled up before the  door. But just at that moment Mrs. Kent began on 'The Reign of  the Roses.' Vine, who had kicked a foot out of its stirrup, did  not dismount. He sat drinking in the dance-measure. Louder and  louder she played the air, and, humming it over, he drove his  foot home. Shaking up the reins, he cantered his mule round and  round the sun-dial in front of the door. Round and round he went,  still humming, while those wiry and sun-burnt wrists pounded away  at the dance-music.    'How long is this going on?' I pleaded. I began to see the humor  of the thing when I watched our carriers. They were gaping as at  a new kind of circus. At last Mrs. Kent gave over, not very soon,  however; the melody was evidently a favorite of hers.    'Is there not a cause?' pleaded Vine, when he had dismounted  lingeringly, and was facing my reproaches for his wanton delay.  He muttered something about a merry-go-round. Afterwards he  explained, when we were making up for lost time along the big  vlei.    'It was that night when we got to Goring,' he reminded me, 'when  we went down to Henley in that double-sculler at the end of our  first summer term 1888, the first week in July. There was a  village fair on that night, and we rode round on the horses, ever  so many pennyworths. That was the tune I remembered best of all  the tunes that the steam-organ played. Don't you remember?' And  strange to say, I did.    He played the game with the organizer, rapt though he was by his  memory of the steam-organ, I will say that much for him. He took  the trouble to go all the way up to Salisbury, and"]]]
