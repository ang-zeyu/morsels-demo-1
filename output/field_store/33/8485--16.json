[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2872"],[0,"The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication â€” Volume 2 (#15)"],[1," several breeds of  poultry, descended from a single species, differences in the eggs and chickens  whilst covered with down, in the plumage at the first and subsequent moults,  as well as in the comb and wattles, are all inherited. With man peculiarities  in the milk and second teeth (of which I have received the details) are  inheritable, and longevity is often transmitted. So again with our improved  breeds of cattle and sheep, early maturity, including the early development of  the teeth, and with certain breeds of fowl the early appearance of secondary  sexual characters, all come under the same head of inheritance at  corresponding periods.    Numerous analogous facts could be given. The silk-moth, perhaps, offers the  best instance; for in the breeds which transmit their characters truly, the  eggs differ in size, colour, and shape: the caterpillars differ, in moulting  three or four times, in colour, even in having a dark-coloured mark like an  eyebrow, and in the loss of certain instincts;--the cocoons differ in size,  shape, and in the colour and quality of the silk; these several differences  being followed by slight or barely distinguishable differences in the mature  moth.    But it may be said that, if in the above cases a new peculiarity is inherited,  it must be at the corresponding stage of development; for an egg or seed can  resemble only an egg or seed, and the horn in a full-grown ox can resemble  only a horn. The following cases show inheritance at corresponding periods  more plainly, because they refer to peculiarities which might have supervened,  as far as we can see, earlier or later in life, yet are inherited at the same  period at which they first appeared.    [In the Lambert family the porcupine-like excrescences appeared in the father  and sons at the same age, namely, about nine weeks after birth. (14/30.  Prichard 'Phys. Hist. of Mankind' 1851 volume 1 page 349.) In the  extraordinary hairy family described by Mr. Crawfurd (14/31. 'Embassy to the  Court of Ava' volume 1 page 320. The third generation is described by Capt.  Yule in his 'Narrative of the Mission to the Court of Ava' 1855 page 94.),  children were produced during three generations with hairy ears; in the father  the hair began to grow over his body at six years old; in his daughter  somewhat earlier, namely, at one year; and in both generations the milk teeth  appeared late in life, the permanent teeth being afterwards singularly  deficient. Greyness of hair at an unusually early age has been transmitted in  some families. These cases border on diseases inherited at corresponding  periods of life, to which I shall immediately refer.    It is a well-known peculiarity with almond-tumbler pigeons, that the full  beauty and peculiar character of the plumage does not appear until the bird  has moulted two or three times. Neumeister describes and figures a brace of  pigeons in which the whole body is white except the breast, neck, and head;  but in their first plumage all the white feathers have coloured edges. Another  breed is more remarkable: its first plumage is black, with rusty-red wing-bars  and a crescent-shaped mark on the breast; these marks then become white, and  remain so during three or four moults; but after this period the white spreads  over the body, and the bird loses its beauty. (14/32. 'Das Ganze der  Taubenzucht' 1837 s. 24 tab. 4 figure 2 s. 21 tab. 1 figure 4.) Prize canary-  birds have their wings and tail black: \"this colour, however, is only retained  until the first moult, so that they must be exhibited ere the change takes  place. Once moulted, the peculiarity has ceased. Of course all the birds  emanating from this stock have black wings and tails the first year.\" (14/33.  Kidd 'Treatise on the Canary' page 18.) A curious and somewhat analogous  account has been given (14/34. Charlesworth 'Mag. of Nat. Hist.' volume 1 1837  page 167.) of a family of wild pied rooks which were first observed in 1798,  near Chalfont, and which every year from that date up to the period of the  published notice, viz., 1837 \"have several of their brood particoloured, black  and white. This variegation of the plumage, however, disappears with the first  moult; but among the next young families there are always a few pied ones.\"  These changes of plumage, which are inherited at various corresponding periods  of life in the pigeon, canary-bird, and rook, are remarkable, because the  parent-species passes through no such change.    Inherited diseases afford evidence in some respects of less value than the  foregoing cases, because diseases are not necessarily connected with any  change in structure; but in other respects of more value, because the periods  have been more carefully observed. Certain diseases are communicated to the  child apparently by a process like inoculation, and the child is from the  first affected; such cases may be here passed over. Large classes of diseases  usually appear at certain ages, such as St. Vitus's dance in youth,  consumption in early mid-life, gout later, and apoplexy still later; and these  are naturally inherited at the same period. But even in diseases of this  class, instances have been recorded, as with St. Vitus's dance, showing that  an unusually early or late tendency to the disease is inheritable. (14/35. Dr.  Prosper Lucas 'Hered. Nat.' tome 2 page 713.) In most cases the appearance of  any inherited disease is largely determined by certain critical periods in  each person's life, as well as by unfavourable conditions. There are many  other diseases, which are not attached to any particular period, but which  certainly tend to appear in the child at about the same age at which the  parent was first attacked. An array of high authorities, ancient and modern,  could be given in support of this proposition. The illustrious Hunter believed  in it; and Piorry (14/36. 'L'Hered. dans les Maladies' 1840 page 135. For  Hunter see Harlan 'Med. Researches' page 530.) cautions the physician to look  closely to the child at the period when any grave inheritable disease attacked  the parent. Dr. Prosper Lucas (14/37. 'L'Hered. Nat.' tome 2 page 850.), after  collecting facts from every source, asserts that affections of all kinds,  though not related to any particular period of life, tend to reappear in the  offspring at whatever period of life they first appeared in the progenitor.    As the subject is important, it may be well to give a few instances, simply as  illustrations, not as proof; for proof, recourse must be had to the  authorities above quoted. Some of the following cases have been selected for  the sake of showing that, when a slight departure from the rule occurs, the  child is affected somewhat earlier in life than the parent. In the family of  Le Compte blindness was inherited through three generations, and no less than  twenty-seven children and grandchildren were all affected at about the same  age; their blindness in general began to advance about the fifteenth or  sixteenth year, and ended in total deprivation of sight at the age of about  twenty-two. (14/38. Sedgwick 'Brit. and For. Med.-Chirurg. Review' April 1861  page 485. In some accounts the number of children and grandchildren is given  as 37; but this seems to be an error judging from the paper first published in  the 'Baltimore Med. and Phys. Reg.' 1809 of which Mr. Sedgwick has been so  kind as to send me a copy.) In another case a father and his four children all  became blind at twenty-one years old; in another, a grandmother grew blind at  thirty-five, her daughter at nineteen, and three grandchildren at the ages of  thirteen and eleven. (14/39. Prosper Lucas 'Hered. Nat.' tome 1 page 400.) So  with deafness, two brothers, their father and paternal grandfather, all became  deaf at the age of forty. (14/40. Sedgwick ibid July 1861 page 202.)    Esquirol gives several striking instances of insanity coming on at the same  age, as that of a grandfather, father, and son, who all committed suicide near  their fiftieth year. Many other cases could be given, as of a whole family who  became insane at the age of forty. (14/41. Piorry page 109; Prosper Lucas tome  2 page 759.) Other cerebral affections sometimes follow the same rule,--for  instance, epilepsy and apoplexy. A woman died of the latter disease when  sixty-three years old; one of her daughters at forty-three, and the other at  sixty-seven: the latter had twelve children, who all died from tubercular  meningitis. (14/42. Prosper Lucas tome 2 page 748.) I mention this latter case  because it illustrates a frequent occurrence, namely, a change in the precise  nature of an inherited disease, though still affecting the same organ.    Asthma has attacked several members of the same family when forty years old,  and other families during infancy. The most different diseases, such as angina  pectoris, stone in the bladder, and various affections of the skin, have  appeared in successive generations at nearly the same age. The little finger  of a man began from some unknown cause to grow inwards, and the same finger in  his two sons began at the same age to bend inwards in a similar manner.  Strange and inexplicable neuralgic affections have caused parents and children  to suffer agonies at about the same period of life. (14/43. Prosper Lucas tome  3 pages 678, 700, 702; Sedgwick ibid April 1863 page 449 and July 1863 page  162. Dr. J. Steinan 'Essay on Hereditary Disease' 1843 pages 27, 34.)    I will give only two other cases, which are interesting as illustrating the  disappearance as well as the appearance of disease at the same age. Two  brothers, their father, their paternal uncles, seven cousins, and their  paternal grandfather, were all similarly affected by a skin-disease, called  pityriasis versicolor; \"the disease, strictly limited to the males of the  family (though transmitted through the females), usually appeared at puberty,  and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28752"],[0,"Pleasures of the telescope (#15)"],[1,"white and faint blue or lilac.  One of the most beautiful of double stars is alpha Herculis. The  magnitudes are three and six, distance 4.7\", p. 118 deg., colors orange and  green, very distinct. Variability has been ascribed to each of the stars  in turn. It is not known that they constitute a binary system, because  no certain evidence of motion has been obtained. Another very beautiful  and easily separated double is delta, magnitudes three and eight,  distance 19\", p. 175 deg., colors pale green and purple.    Sweeping northwestward to zeta, we encounter a celebrated binary, to  separate which at present requires the higher powers of a six-inch  glass. The magnitudes are three and six and a half, distance in 1899,  0.6\", p. 264 deg.; in 1900, 0.8\", p. 239 deg.. The period of revolution is  thirty-five years, and two complete revolutions have been observed. The  apparent distance changes from 0.6\" to 1.6\". They were at their extreme  distance in 1884.    Two pleasing little doubles are Sigma 2101, magnitudes six and nine,  distance 4\", p. 57 deg., and Sigma 2104, magnitudes six and eight, distance  6\", p. 20 deg.. At the northern end of the constellation is 42, a double  that requires the light-grasping power of our largest glass. Its  magnitudes are six and twelve, distance 20\", p. 94 deg.. In rho we discover  another distinctly colored double, both stars being greenish or bluish,  with a difference of tone. The magnitudes are four and five and a half,  distance 3.7\", p. 309 deg.. But the double 95 is yet more remarkable for the  colors of its stars. Their magnitudes are five and five and a half,  distance 6\", p. 262 deg., colors, according to Webb, \"light apple-green and  cherry-red.\" But other observers have noted different hues, one calling  them both golden yellow. I think Webb's description is more nearly  correct. Sigma 2215 is a very close double, requiring larger telescopes  than those we are working with. Its magnitudes are six and a half and  eight, distance 0.7\", p. 300 deg.. It is probably a binary. Sigma 2289 is  also close, but our five-inch will separate it: magnitudes six and  seven, distance 1.2\", p. 230 deg..    Turning to , we have to deal with a triple, one of whose stars is at  present beyond the reach of our instruments. The magnitudes of the two  that we see are four and ten, distance 31\", p. 243 deg.. The tenth-magnitude  star is a binary of short period (probably less than fifty years), the  distance of whose components was 2\" in 1859, 1\" in 1880, 0.34\" in 1889,  and 0.54\" in 1891, when the position angle was 25 deg., and rapidly  increasing. The distance is still much less than 1\".    For a glance at a planetary nebula we may turn with the five-inch to No.  4234. It is very small and faint, only 8\" in diameter, and equal in  brightness to an eighth-magnitude star. Only close gazing shows that it  is not sharply defined like a star, and that it possesses a bluish tint.  Its spectrum is gaseous.    The chief attraction of Hercules we have left for the last, the famous  star cluster between eta and zeta, No. 4230, more commonly known as M  13. On a still evening in the early summer, when the moon is absent and  the quiet that the earth enjoys seems an influence descending from the  brooding stars, the spectacle of this sun cluster in Hercules, viewed  with a telescope of not less than five-inches aperture, captivates the  mind of the most uncontemplative observer. With the Lick telescope I  have watched it resolve into separate stars to its very center--a scene  of marvelous beauty and impressiveness. But smaller instruments reveal  only the in-running star streams and the sprinkling of stellar points  over the main aggregation, which cause it to sparkle like a cloud of  diamond dust transfused with sunbeams. The appearance of flocking  together that those uncountable thousands of stars present calls up at  once a picture of our lone sun separated from its nearest stellar  neighbor by a distance probably a hundred times as great as the entire  diameter of the spherical space within which that multitude is  congregated. It is true that unless we assume what would seem an  unreasonable remoteness for the Hercules cluster, its component stars  must be much smaller bodies than the sun; yet even that fact does not  diminish the wonder of their swarming. Here the imagination must bear  science on its wings, else science can make no progress whatever. It is  an easy step from Hercules to Draco. In the conspicuous diamond-shaped  figure that serves as a guide-board to the head of the latter, the  southernmost star belongs not to Draco but to Hercules. The brightest  star in this figure is gamma, of magnitude two and a half, with an  eleventh-magnitude companion, distant 125\", p. 116 deg.. Two stars of  magnitude five compose nu, their distance apart being 62\", p. 312 deg.. A  more interesting double is , magnitudes five and five, distance 2.4\", p.  158 deg.. Both stars are white, and they present a pretty appearance when  the air is steady. They form a binary system of unknown period. Sigma  2078 (also called 17 Draconis) is a triple, magnitudes six, six and a  half, and six, distances 3.8\", p. 116 deg., and 90\", p. 195 deg.. Sigma 1984 is  an easy double, magnitudes six and a half and eight and a half, distance  6.4\", p. 276 deg.. The star eta is a very difficult double for even our  largest aperture, on account of the faintness of one of its components.  The magnitudes are two and a half and ten, distance 4.7\", p. 140 deg.. Its  near neighbor, Sigma 2054, may be a binary. Its magnitudes are six and  seven, distance 1\", p. 0 deg.. In Sigma 2323 we have another triple,  magnitudes five, eight and a half, and seven, distances 3.6\", p. 360 deg.,  and 90\", p. 22 deg., colors white, blue, and reddish. A fine double is  epsilon, magnitudes five and eight, distance 3\", p. 5 deg..    The nebula No. 4373 is of a planetary character, and interesting as  occupying the pole of the ecliptic. A few years ago Dr. Holden, with the  Lick telescope, discovered that it is unique in its form. It consists of  a double spiral, drawn out nearly in the line of sight, like the thread  of a screw whose axis lies approximately endwise with respect to the  observer. There is a central star, and another fainter star is involved  in the outer spiral. The form of this object suggests strange ideas as  to its origin. But the details mentioned are far beyond the reach of  our instruments. We shall only see it as a hazy speck. No. 4415 is  another nebula worth glancing at. It is Tuttle's so-called variable  nebula.    [Illustration: MAP NO. 16.]    There are three constellations represented on map No. 16 to which we  shall pay brief visits. First Aquila demands attention. Its doubles may  be summarized as follows: 11, magnitudes five and nine, distance 17.4\",  p. 252 deg.; pi, magnitudes six and seven, distance 1.6\", p. 122 deg.; 23,  magnitudes six and ten, distance 3.4\", p. 12 deg.--requires the five-inch  and good seeing; 57, magnitudes five and six, distance 36\", p. 170 deg.;  Sigma 2654, magnitudes six and eight, distance 12\", p. 234 deg.; Sigma 2644,  magnitudes six and seven, distance 3.6\", p. 208 deg..    The star eta is an interesting variable between magnitudes three and a  half and 4.7; period, seven days, four hours, fourteen minutes. The  small red variable R changes from magnitude six to magnitude seven and a  half and back again in a period of three hundred and fifty-one days.    Star cluster No. 4440 is a striking object, its stars ranging from the  ninth down to the twelfth magnitude.    Just north of Aquila is the little constellation Sagitta, containing  several interesting doubles and many fine star fields, which may be  discovered by sweeping over it with a low-power eyepiece. The star zeta  is double, magnitudes five and nine, distance 8.6\", p. 312 deg.. The larger  star is itself double, but far too close to be split, except with very  large telescopes. In theta we find three components of magnitudes seven,  nine, and eight respectively, distances 11.4\", p. 327 deg., and 70\", p.  227 deg.. A wide double is epsilon, magnitudes six and eight, distance 92\",  p. 81 deg.. Nebula No. 4572 is planetary.    Turning to Delphinus, we find a very beautiful double in gamma,  magnitudes four and five, distance 11\", p. 273 deg., colors golden and  emerald. The leader alpha, which is not as bright as its neighbor beta,  and which is believed to be irregularly variable, is of magnitude four,  and has a companion of nine and a half magnitude at the distance 35\", p.  278 deg.. At a similar distance, 35\", p. 335 deg., beta has an  eleventh-magnitude companion, and the main star is also double, but  excessively close, and much beyond our reach. It is believed to be a  swiftly moving binary, whose stars are never separated widely enough to  be distinguished with common telescopes.          CHAPTER VI    FROM LYRA TO ERIDANUS    \"This Orpheus struck when with his wondrous song  He charmed the woods and drew the rocks along.\"--MANILIUS.      [Illustration: MAP NO. 17.]    We resume our celestial explorations with the little constellation Lyra,  whose chief star, Vega (alpha), has a very good claim to be regarded as  the most beautiful in the sky. The position of this remarkable star is  indicated in map No. 17. Every eye not insensitive to delicate shades of  color perceives at once that Vega is not white, but blue-white. When the  telescope is turned upon the star the color brightens splendidly.  Indeed, some glasses decidedly exaggerate the blueness of Vega, but the  effect is so beautiful that one can easily forgive the optical  imperfection which produces it. With our four-inch we look for the  well-known companion of Vega, a tenth-magnitude star, also of a blue  color deeper than the hue of its great neighbor. The distance is 50\", p.  158 deg.. Under the most favorable circumstances it might be glimpsed with  "]]]
