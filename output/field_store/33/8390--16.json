Many tombs also, besides  the remains of the renowned or wealthy dead, for whom they have been  erected at a cost as extravagant and with art as elaborate as the  abodes of the living, contain the full description of their inmate's  lineage, his life, his habits and pursuits, with prayers and invocations  to the divinities of his race and descriptions or portrayed  representations of religious ceremonies. Or, the walls of caves, either  natural, or cut in the rock for purposes of shelter or concealment,  yield to the explorer some more chapters out of the old, old story, in  which our interest never slackens. This story man has himself been  writing, patiently, laboriously, on every surface on which he could  trace words and lines, ever since he has been familiar with the art of  expressing his thoughts in visible signs,--and so each such surviving  memorial may truly be called a stray leaf, half miraculously preserved  to us, out of the great Book of the Past, which it has been the task of  scholars through ages, and especially during the last eighty years, to  decipher and teach others how to read.

Of this venerable book the walls of the Assyrian palaces, with their  endless rows of inscriptions, telling year for year through centuries  the history of the kings who built them, are so many invaluable pages,  while the sculptures which accompany these annals are the illustrations,  lending life and reality to what would otherwise be a string of dry and  unattractive records. But a greater wonder has been brought to light  from amidst the rubbish and dust of twenty-five centuries: a collection  of literary and scientific works, of religious treatises, of private and  public documents, deposited in rooms constructed on purpose to contain  them, arranged in admirable order, in short--a LIBRARY. Truly and  literally a library, in the sense in which we use the word. Not the only  one either, nor the first by many hundred years, although the volumes  are of singular make and little like those we are used to.    8. When Layard was at work for the second time amidst the ruins along  the Tigris, he devoted much of his labor to the great mound of Koyunjik,  in which the remains of two sumptuous palaces were distinctly discerned,  one of them the royal residence of Sennacherib, the other that of his  grandson Asshurbanipal, who lived some 650 years before Christ--two of  the mightiest conquerors and most magnificent sovereigns of the Eastern  world. In the latter palace he came upon two comparatively small  chambers, the floor of which was entirely littered with fragments--some  of considerable size, some very small--of bricks, or rather baked-clay  tablets, covered on both sides with cuneiform writing. It was a layer  more than a foot in height which must have been formed by the falling in  of the upper part of the edifice. The tablets, piled in good order along  the walls, perhaps in an upper story--if, as many think, there was  one--must have been precipitated promiscuously into the apartment and  shattered by the fall. Yet, incredible as it may appear, several were  found entire. Layard filled many cases with the fragments and sent them  off to the British Museum, fully aware of their probable historical  value.    9. There they lay for years, heaped up at random, a mine of treasures  which made the mouths of scholars water, but appalled them by the  amount of labor, nay, actual drudgery, needful only to sift and sort  them, even before any study of their contents could be begun. At length  a young and ambitious archaeologist, attached to the British Museum,  George Smith, undertook the long and wearisome task. He was not  originally a scholar, but an engraver, and was employed to engrave on  wood cuneiform texts for the magnificent atlas edited by the British  Museum under the title of \"Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia.\"  Being endowed with a quick and enquiring mind, Smith did not content  himself, like most of his colleagues, with a conscientious and artistic,  but merely technical reproduction; he wished to know _what_ he was doing  and he learned the language of the inscriptions. When he took on himself  the sorting of the fragments, it was in the hope of distinguishing  himself in this new field, and of rendering a substantial service to the  science which had fascinated him. Nor was he deceived in this hope. He  succeeded in finding and uniting a large quantity of fragments belonging  together, and thus restoring pages of writing, with here and there a  damaged line, a word effaced, a broken corner, often a larger portion  missing, but still enough left to form continuous and readable texts. In  some cases it was found that there was more than one copy of this or  that work or document, and then sometimes the parts which were  hopelessly injured in one copy, would be found whole or nearly so in  another.    10. The results accomplished by this patient mechanical process were  something astonishing. And when he at length restored in this manner a  series of twelve tablets containing an entire poem of the greatest  antiquity and highest interest, the occasion seemed important enough to  warrant the enterprising owners of the London _Daily Telegraph_ in  sending the young student to resume excavations and try to complete some  missing links. For of some of the tablets restored by him only portions  could be found among the fragments of the British Museum. Of course he  made his way straight to the Archive Chambers at Koyunjik, had them  opened again and cleared them of another large instalment of their  valuable contents, among which he had the inconceivable good fortune to  find some of the very pieces which were missing in his collection.  Joyfully he returned to England twice with his treasures, and hopefully  set out on a third expedition of the same kind. He had reason to feel  buoyant; he had already made his name famous by several works which  greatly enriched the science he loved, and had he not half a lifetime  before him to continue the work which few could do as well? Alas, he  little knew that his career was to be cut short suddenly by a loathsome  and brutal foe: he died of the plague in Syria, in 1876--just thirty-six  years old. He was faithful to the end. His diary, in which he made some  entries even within a very few days before his death, shows that at the  last, when he knew his danger and was fast losing hope, his mind was  equally divided between thoughts of his family and of his work. The  following lines, almost the last intelligible ones he wrote, are deeply  touching in their simple, single-minded earnestness:--\"Not so well. If  Doctor present, I should recover, but he has not come, very doubtful  case; if fatal farewell to ... _My work has been entirely for the  science I study...._ There is a large field of study in my collection. I  intended to work it out, but desire now that my antiquities and notes  may be thrown open to all students. I have done my duty thoroughly. I do  not fear the change but desire to live for my family. Perhaps all may be  well yet.\"--George Smith's death was a great loss, which his  brother-scholars of all countries have not ceased to deplore. But the  work now proceeds vigorously and skilfully. The precious texts are  sorted, pieced, and classified, and a collection of them, carefully  selected, is reproduced by the aid of the photographer and the engraver,  so that, should the originals ever be lost or destroyed, (not a very  probable event), the Museum indeed would lose one of its most precious  rarities, but science would lose nothing.    11. An eminent French scholar and assyriologist, Joachim Menant, has the  following picturesque lines in his charming little book \"_La  Bibliotheque du Palais de Ninive_\": \"When we reflect that these records  have been traced on a substance which neither fire nor water could  destroy, we can easily comprehend how those who wrote them thus thirty  or forty centuries ago, believed the monuments of their history to be  safe for all future times,--much safer than the frail sheets which  printing scatters with such prodigious fertility.... Of all the nations  who have bequeathed to us written records of their past life, we may  assert that none has left monuments more imperishable than Assyria and  Chaldea. Their number is already considerable; it is daily increased by  new discoveries. It is not possible to foresee what the future has in  store for us in this respect; but we can even now make a valuation of  the entire material which we possess.... The number of the tablets from  the Nineveh Library alone passes ten thousand.... If we compare these  texts with those left us by other nations, we can easily become  convinced that the history of the Assyro-Chaldean civilization will soon  be one of the best known of antiquity. It has a powerful attraction for  us, for we know that the life of the Jewish people is mixed up with the  history of Nineveh and Babylon....\"    [Illustration: 46.--CUNEIFORM INSCRIPTION.

It will be seen from this that throughout the following pages we  shall continually have to refer to the contents of Asshurbanipal's royal  library. We must therefore dispense in this place with any details  concerning the books, more than a general survey of the subjects they  treated. Of these, religion and science were the chief. Under \"science\"  we must understand principally mathematics and astronomy, two branches  in which the old Chaldeans reached great perfection and left us many of  our own most fundamental notions and practices, as we shall see later  on. Among the scientific works must also be counted those on astrology,  i.e., on the influence which the heavenly bodies were "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24676"],[0,"Peeps at Many Lands: Norway (#15)"],[1,"Norwegian test is something more  formidable--about fifteen miles of rough, mountainous country,  over hill and dale, through forests, and as often as not down rocky  precipices, all half buried in snow; in the runner's hand a staff, and  on his feet his ski, six or eight feet long. The course is carefully  marked out beforehand by tying pieces of coloured rag to branches and  rocks, and it is a point-to-point race throughout. Every district sends  its champion, and there are frequently as many as eighty competitors,  who are started one after another at intervals of a minute. Except,  however, for expert ski-runners who can follow the course, it is not  an interesting race to watch, as one only sees the start or the finish,  to learn subsequently who covered the distance in the shortest time.    The appearance of the men as they come in is sufficient proof of  the terrific nature of the test. So bathed in perspiration are they  that they might have been running a \"Marathon\" race in the height  of summer; and so parched are their tongues that they can scarcely  speak. Lucky the skier who, during his run, chances on an unfrozen  forest pool whereat he may quench his thirst by deep draughts of what  the Norwegian terms \"goosewine\"--our \"Adam's ale.\"    But the second day's sport is of a different kind; the whole thing  is visible to the spectators, who from first to last are subjected  to thrills of wild excitement. The ground selected for the contest  is the side of a somewhat steep hill, and the snow must be in proper  condition--deep, and not having a hard-frozen crust. The competitors  assemble on the summit, and at the bottom of the slope--perhaps a  hundred yards from the starting-point--is a large enclosed space,  around which stand the spectators. Half-way down the hillside, a  horizontal platform, well covered with hard snow, has been built out,  so as to form the \"taking-off\" point for the long jump; and close  by it is the box for the judges and committee. The soldiers on ski,  keeping the ground, give the signal that all is ready; in another  second a bugle-call resounds from the top of the hill; and the first  man has started.    Down the slope he comes at the top of his speed, his fists clenched,  and determination in his face. Gathering himself together as he nears  the \"take-off,\" he bends slightly on his ski, and, with a frantic  bound, flies forward into space. For an instant a breathless silence  falls on the crowd, and then, as the _ski-loeber_ lands at the bottom,  and struggles in vain to keep his feet, cheers mingled with laughter  fill the air. Number 2 is no more successful than his predecessor; but  Number 3 lands on both feet with much grace, continues his way on level  ground, and, wheeling round, receives the well-merited applause of the  onlookers. Others follow in quick succession, some making brilliant  leaps, some having awkward spills; yet one and all racing down to the  platform with almost abandoned recklessness. What with the delay caused  by accidents, and the time taken in measuring the successful jumps,  the contest occupies some hours. Then the judges declare the names of  the prize-winners, together with the length of each man's leap; and,  prodigious as it may seem, it is no unusual thing for the champion  to accomplish 100 feet, measured on the slope from the \"take-off\"  to the landing-point.    Such are some of the winter sports of Norway. Can anyone wonder  that the men who enter into them with so great a zest have earned  for themselves the name of \"Hardy Norsemen\"? Can anyone wonder that  Dr. Nansen, in his younger days the champion _ski-loeber_ at one of  these great meetings, should have defeated all others in the race  for the North Pole?
