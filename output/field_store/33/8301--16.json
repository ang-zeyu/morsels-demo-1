He laughed at the ghost-tales,--not as  much as he would have done a month before,--but ended by sitting still  and shuddering.    Tom Platt dealt with his interminable trip round the Horn on the old  Ohio in the flogging days, with a navy more extinct than the dodo--the  navy that passed away in the great war. He told them how red-hot shot  are dropped into a cannon, a wad of wet clay between them and the  cartridge; how they sizzle and reek when they strike wood, and how the  little ship-boys of the Miss Jim Buck hove water over them and shouted  to the fort to try again. And he told tales of blockade--long weeks of  swaying at anchor, varied only by the departure and return of steamers  that had used up their coal (there was no change for the  sailing-ships); of gales and cold--cold that kept two hundred men,  night and day, pounding and chopping at the ice on cable, blocks, and  rigging, when the galley was as red-hot as the fort's shot, and men  drank cocoa by the bucket. Tom Platt had no use for steam. His service  closed when that thing was comparatively new. He admitted that it was a  specious invention in time of peace, but looked hopefully for the day  when sails should come back again on ten-thousand-ton frigates with  hundred-and-ninety-foot booms.    Manuel's talk was slow and gentle--all about pretty girls in Madeira  washing clothes in the dry beds of streams, by moonlight, under waving  bananas; legends of saints, and tales of queer dances or fights away in  the cold Newfoundland baiting-ports. Salters was mainly agricultural;  for, though he read \"Josephus\" and expounded it, his mission in life  was to prove the value of green manures, and specially of clover,  against every form of phosphate whatsoever. He grew libellous about  phosphates; he dragged greasy \"Orange Judd\" books from his bunk and  intoned them, wagging his finger at Harvey, to whom it was all Greek.  Little Penn was so genuinely pained when Harvey made fun of Salters's  lectures that the boy gave it up, and suffered in polite silence. That  was very good for Harvey.    The cook naturally did not join in these conversations. As a rule, he  spoke only when it was absolutely necessary; but at times a queer gift  of speech descended on him, and he held forth, half in Gaelic, half in  broken English, an hour at a time. He was specially communicative with  the boys, and he never withdrew his prophecy that one day Harvey would  be Dan's master, and that he would see it. He told them of  mail-carrying in the winter up Cape Breton way, of the dog-train that  goes to Coudray, and of the ram-steamer Arctic, that breaks the ice  between the mainland and Prince Edward Island. Then he told them  stories that his mother had told him, of life far to the southward,  where water never froze; and he said that when he died his soul would  go to lie down on a warm white beach of sand with palm-trees waving  above. That seemed to the boys a very odd idea for a man who had never  seen a palm in his life. Then, too, regularly at each meal, he would  ask Harvey, and Harvey alone, whether the cooking was to his taste; and  this always made the \"second half\" laugh. Yet they had a great respect  for the cook's judgment, and in their hearts considered Harvey  something of a mascot by consequence.    And while Harvey was taking in knowledge of new things at each pore and  hard health with every gulp of the good air, the \"We're Here\" went her  ways and did her business on the Bank, and the silvery-grey kenches of  well-pressed fish mounted higher and higher in the hold. No one day's  work was out of the common, but the average days were many and close  together.    Naturally, a man of Disko's reputation was closely watched--\"scrowged  upon,\" Dan called it--by his neighbours, but he had a very pretty knack  of giving them the slip through the curdling, glidy fog-banks. Disko  avoided company for two reasons. He wished to make his own experiments,  in the first place; and in the second, he objected to the mixed  gatherings of a fleet of all nations. The bulk of them were mainly  Gloucester boats, with a scattering from Provincetown, Harwich,  Chatham, and some of the Maine ports, but the crews drew from goodness  knows where. Risk breeds recklessness, and when greed is added there  are fine chances for every kind of accident in the crowded fleet,  which, like a mob of sheep, is huddled round some unrecognised leader.  \"Let the two Jeraulds lead 'em,\" said Disko. \"We're baound to lay among  'em fer a spell on the Eastern Shoals; though ef luck holds, we won't  hev to lay long. Where we are naow, Harve, ain't considered noways good  graound.\"    \"Ain't it?\" said Harvey, who was drawing water (he had learned just how  to wiggle the bucket), after an unusually long dressing-down.  \"Shouldn't mind striking some poor ground for a change, then.\"    \"All the graound I want to see--don't want to strike her--is Eastern  Point,\" said Dan. \"Say, dad, it looks 's if we wouldn't hev to lay  more'n two weeks on the Shoals. You'll meet all the comp'ny you want  then, Harve. That's the time we begin to work. No reg'lar meals fer no  one then. 'Mug-up when ye're hungry, an' sleep when ye can't keep  awake. Good job you wasn't picked up a month later than you was, or  we'd never ha' had you dressed in shape fer the Old Virgin.\"    Harvey understood from the Eldridge chart that the Old Virgin and a  nest of curiously named shoals were the turning-point of the cruise,  and that with good luck they would wet the balance of their salt there.  But seeing the size of the Virgin (it was one tiny dot), he wondered  how even Disko with the hog-yoke and the lead could find her. He  learned later that Disko was entirely equal to that and any other  business, and could even help others. A big four-by-five blackboard  hung in the cabin, and Harvey never understood the need of it till,  after some blinding thick days, they heard the unmelodious tooting of a  foot-power fog-horn--a machine whose note is as that of a consumptive  elephant.    They were making a short berth, towing the anchor under their foot to  save trouble. \"Squarerigger bellowin' fer his latitude,\" said Long  Jack. The dripping red headsails of a bark glided out of the fog, and  the \"We're Here\" rang her bell thrice, using sea shorthand.    The larger boat backed her topsail with shrieks and shoutings.    \"Frenchman,\" said Uncle Salters, scornfully. \"Miquelon boat from St.  Malo.\" The farmer had a weatherly sea-eye. \"I'm most outer 'baccy, too,  Disko.\"    \"Same here,\" said Tom Platt. \"Hi! Backez vouz--backez vouz! Standez  awayez, you butt-ended mucho-bono! Where you from--St. Malo, eh?\"    Ah, ha! Mucho bono! Oui! oui! Clos Poulet--St. Malo! St. Pierre et  Miquelon,\" cried the other crowd, waving woollen caps and laughing.  Then all together, \"Bord! Bord!\"    \"Bring up the board, Danny. Beats me how them Frenchmen fetch  anywheres, exceptin' America's fairish broadly. Forty-six forty-nine's  good enough fer them; an' I guess it's abaout right, too.\"    Dan chalked the figures on the board, and they hung it in the  main-rigging to a chorus of mercis from the bark.    \"Seems kinder unneighbourly to let 'em swedge off like this,\" Salters  suggested, feeling in his pockets.    \"Hev ye learned French then sence last trip'?\" said Disko. \"I don't  want no more stone-ballast hove at us 'long o' your calm' Miquelon  boats 'footy cochins,' same's you did off Le Have.\"    \"Harmon Rush he said that was the way to rise 'em. Plain United States  is good enough fer me. We're all dretful short on terbakker. Young  feller, don't you speak French?\"    \"Oh, yes,\" said Harvey, valiantly; and he bawled: \"Hi! Say! Arretez  vous! Attendez! Nous sommes venant pour tabac.\"    \"Ah, tabac, tabac!\" they cried, and laughed again.    \"That hit 'em. Let's heave a dory over, anyway,\" said Tom Platt. \"I  don't exactly hold no certificates on French, but I know another lingo  that goes, I guess. Come on, Harve, an' interpret.\"    The raffle and confusion when he and Harvey were hauled up the bark's  black side was indescribable. Her cabin was all stuck round with  glaring coloured prints of the Virgin--the Virgin of Newfoundland, they  called her. Harvey found his French of no recognised Bank brand, and  his conversation was limited to nods and grins. But Tom Platt waved his  arms and got along swimmingly. The captain gave him a drink of  unspeakable gin, and the opera-comique crew, with their hairy throats,  red caps, and long knives, greeted him as a brother. Then the trade  began. They had tobacco, plenty of it--American, that had never paid  duty to France. They wanted chocolate and crackers. Harvey rowed back  to arrange with the cook and Disko, who owned the stores, and on his  return the cocoa-tins and cracker-bags were counted out by the  Frenchman's wheel. It looked like a piratical division of loot; but Tom  Platt came out of it roped with black pigtail and stuffed with cakes of  chewing and smoking tobacco. Then those jovial mariners swung off into  the mist, and the last Harvey heard was a gay chorus:              \"Par derriere chez ma tante,            Il y a un bois joli,            Et le rossignol y chante            Et le jour et la nuit...            Que donneriez vous, belle,            Qui l'amènerait ici?            Je donnerai Québec,            Sorel et Saint Denis.\"    \"How was it my French didn't go, and your sign-talk did?\" Harvey  demanded when the barter had been distributed among the \"We're Heres\".    \"Sign-talk!\" Platt guffawed. \"Well, yes, 'twas sign-talk, but a heap  older'n your French, Harve. Them French boats are chock-full o'  Freemasons, an' that's why.\"    \"Are you a Freemason, then?\"    \"Looks that way, don't"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22257"],[0,"Bulgaria (#15)"],[1,"into the  picturesque ways of the new school of correspondents. Actually you could  not have lost more than a regiment in the largest mud-puddle.)    Let the position be frankly faced, that if one is with an army in modern  warfare, common sense prohibits the authorities from allowing you to see  anything, and suggests the further precautions of a strict Censorship  and a general hold-up of wires until their military value (and therefore  their \"news\" value) has passed. If your paper wants picturesque stories  hot off the grill it is much better not to be with the army (which  means, in effect, in the rear of the army), but to write about its deeds  from outside the radius of the Censorship.    Perhaps, though, your paper has old-fashioned prejudices in favour of  veracity and will be annoyed if your imagination leads you too palpably  astray? In that case do not venture to be a war correspondent at all. If  you do not invent you will send nothing of value. If you invent you will  be reprimanded.    Let me give my personal record of \"getting to the front\" and the net  result of the trouble and the expense. I went down to Mustapha Pasha  with the great body of war correspondents, and soon recognised that  there was no hope of useful work there. The attacking army was at a  standstill and a long, wearisome siege--its operations strictly guarded  from inspection--was in prospect. I decided to get back to staff  headquarters (then at Stara Zagora), and just managed to catch the staff  before it moved on to Kirk Kilisse. By threatening to return to London  at once I got a promise of leave to join the Third Army and to \"see some  fighting.\"    The promise anticipated the actual granting of leave by two days. It  would be tedious to record all the little and big difficulties that were  then encountered through the reluctance of the military authorities to  allow one to get transport or help of any kind. But four days later I  was marching out of Mustapha Pasha on the way to Kirk Kilisse by way of  Adrianople, a bullock-wagon carrying my baggage, an interpreter  trundling my bicycle, I riding a small pony. The interpreter was gloomy  and disinclined to face the hardships and dangers (mostly fancied) of  the journey. Beside the driver (a Macedonian) marched a soldier with  fixed bayonet. Persuasion was necessary to force the driver to undertake  the journey, and a friendly transport officer had, with more or less  legality, put at my command this means of argument. A mile outside  Mustapha Pasha the soldier turned back, and I was left to coax my  unwilling helpers on a four days' journey across a war-stricken  countryside, swept of all supplies, infested with savage dogs  (fortunately well fed by the harvest of the battlefields), liable to  ravage by roving bands.    That night I gave the Macedonian driver some jam and some meat to eke  out his bread and cheese.    \"That is better than having a bayonet poked into your inside,\" I said,  by pantomime. He understood, grinned, and gave no great trouble  thereafter, though he was always in a state of pitiable funk when I  left the wagon to take a trip within the lines of the besieging forces.    [Illustration: GIPSIES]    So to Kirk Kilisse. There I got to General Savoff himself and won not  only leave, but a letter of aid to go down to the Third Army at the  lines of Chatalja. But by then what must be the final battle of the war  was imminent. Every hour of delay was dangerous. To go by cart meant a  journey of several days. A military train was available part of the way  if I were content to drop interpreter, horse, and baggage and travel  with a soldier's load.    That decision was easy enough at the moment--though I sometimes  regretted it afterwards when the only pair of riding-breeches I had with  me gave out at the knees, and I had to walk the earth ragged--and by  train I got to Tchorlu. There a friendly artillery officer helped me to  get a cart (springless) and two fast horses. He insisted also on giving  me as a patrol, a single Bulgarian soldier, with 200 rounds of  ammunition, as Bashi-Bazouks were ranging the country. I objected that I  had a revolver, and there was the driver, a Greek. \"He would run away,\"  said the officer pleasantly, and the patrol was taken.    It was an unnecessary precaution, though the presence of the soldier  was comforting as we entered Silivri at night, the outskirts of the town  deserted, the chattering of the driver's teeth audible over the clamour  of the cart, the gutted houses ideal refuges for prowling bands. From  Silivri to Chatalja there was again no appearance of Bashi-Bazouks. But  thought of another danger obtruded as we came near the lines and  encountered men from the Bulgarian army suffering from the choleraic  dysentery which had then begun its ravages. To one dying soldier by the  roadside I gave brandy; and then had to leave him with his mates, who  were trying to get him to a hospital. They were sorely puzzled by his  cries, his pitiful grimaces. Wounds they knew, and the pain of them they  despised. They could not comprehend this disease which took away all the  manhood of a stoic peasant, and made him weak in spirit as an ailing  child.    From Chatalja, the right flank of the Bulgarian position, I passed along  the front to Ermenikioi (\"the village of Armenians\"), passing the night  at Arjenli, near the centre and the headquarters of the ammunition park.  That night at Arjenli seemed to make a rough and sometimes perilous  journey, which had extended over seven days, worth while.    Arjenli is perched on a high hill, to the west of Ermenikioi. It gave a  view of all the Chatalja position--the range of hills stretching from  the Black Sea to the Sea of Marmora, along which the Bulgarians were  entrenched, and, beyond the invisible valley, the second range which  held the Turkish defence. Over the Turkish lines, like a standard, shone  in the clear sky a crescent moon, within its tip a bright star. It  seemed an omen, an omen of good to the Turks. My Australian eye  instinctively sought for the Southern Cross ranged against it in the sky  in sign that the Christian standard held the Heavens too. I sought in  vain in those northern latitudes, shivered a little and, as though  arguing against a superstitious thought, said to myself: \"But there is  the Great Bear.\"    For by this time I had come to sympathise thoroughly with the Bulgarian  army and its cause. The soldiers were such good fellows: their  steadiness, their sense of justice, their kindness were so remarkable.  Just an incident of the camp at Arjenli to illustrate this. It was on  the Friday night of November 15, and on the morrow we expected the  decisive battle of the war. At Arjenli (which was a little to the rear  of the Bulgarian lines) was the ammunition park of the artillery,  guarded by a small body of troops under Lieutenant-Colonel Tchobanoff.  Coming towards the front from Tchorlu, the fall of night and the  weariness of my horses had compelled me to halt at the village, and this  officer and Dr. Neytchef gave me a warm welcome to their little Mess.    There are six members, and for all, to sleep and to eat, one room. Three  are officers, three have no commissions. With this nation in arms that  is not an objection to a common table. Discipline is strict, but  officers and soldiers are men and brothers when out of the ranks. Social  position does not govern military position. I found sometimes the  University professor and the bank manager without commissions, the  peasant proprietor an officer. The whole nation had poured out its  manhood for the war, from farm, field, factory, shop, bank, university,  and consulting-room.    Here at Arjenli on the eve of the decisive battle, I think over early  incidents of the campaign. It is a curious fact that in all Bulgaria I  have met but one man who was young enough and well enough to fight and  who had not enlisted. He had become an American subject, I believe, and  so could not be compelled to serve. In America he had learned to be an  \"International Socialist,\" and so he did not volunteer. I believe he was  unique. With half the population of London, Bulgaria had put 350,000  trained men under arms.    We eat our simple meal of goat's flesh stewed with rice. Then, smoking  cigarettes made of the tobacco of the district, Colonel Tchobanoff and I  talk over the position as well as my bad French will allow. He is serene  and cheerful. His chief care is to impress upon me the fact that in  making war the Bulgarians had not been influenced by dynastic  considerations nor by military ambition. It was a war dictated not by a  Court circle or a military clique, but by the irresistible wish of the  people.    Whilst we were talking the sound of a rifle shot came up from the  village. A junior officer was sent out to make inquiries. Soon he  returned with two soldiers leading between them a Turkish prisoner.    I learn the facts. The Turk had tried to rush past a sentry standing  guard over the ammunition park. The sentry had fired, had not hit the  man, but had grappled with him afterwards and taken him prisoner.    I nerved myself to see the Turk shot out of hand. The rules of war  warranted it. He had tried to rush a sentry on guard over an important  military station. But the Bulgarian officers decided to hear his story,  and a kind of informal court-martial was constituted. The proceedings,  which were in Turkish, were translated to me, as I was acting in a way  as friend of the accused to \"see fair play.\"    The Turk's story was clear enough. He had lived in Arjenli all his life  and was not a soldier. When the Turkish army had evacuated the district  he had not left with them, but had stayed in his old village. That night  he had gone out of his hut to the village well. Returning, a sentry had  challenged him, and he had become frightened and tried to run away.    It was clear that the man was"]]]
