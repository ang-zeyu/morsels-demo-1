In the grain only is there a diminution, but this is  apparent and not real, and is due to the fact that the determination of  the quantity of ash, as made on the grain with its husk, and the former,  which contains only a small quantity of mineral matters, increases much  more rapidly in weight than the latter, when it approaches the period of  ripening, and it is accordingly during the last three weeks of its  growth that this diminution becomes apparent.    The nature of the soil has also a very important influence on the  proportion of mineral matters, and of this an interesting illustration  is given in the following table, which shows the quantities found in the  grain and straw of the same variety of the pea grown on fourteen  different soils:--    +----+-------+--------+  |    | Seed. | Straw. |  +----+-------+--------+  |  1 |  2.30 |        |  |  2 |  3.25 |  3.43  |  |  3 |  4.27 |  3.62  |  |  4 |  3.40 |  3.39  |  |  5 |  2.99 |  3.90  |  |  6 |  3.19 |  6.80  |  |  7 |  2.53 |  3.90  |  |  8 |  2.27 |  6.59  |  |  9 |  2.69 |  3.49  |  | 10 |  1.61 |  3.91  |  | 11 |  3.11 |  5.28  |  | 12 |  3.34 |  7.57  |  | 13 |  2.78 |  3.76  |  | 14 |  3.01 |  3.38  |  +----+-------+--------+    Although those differences are very large, especially in the straw, and  must be attributed to the soil, it has hitherto been found impossible to  ascertain the nature of the relation subsisting between it and the crops  it yields; indeed, it must obviously be dependent on very complicated  questions, which cannot at present be solved, for it may be observed  that the increase in the grain does not occur simultaneously with that  in the straw, and in several cases a large proportion of ash in the  former is associated with an unusually small amount in the latter. _A  priori_, it might be expected that those soils which are especially rich  in the more important constituents of the ash should yield a produce  containing more than the average quantity, but this is very far from  being an invariable occurrence, and not unfrequently the very reverse  is the case. In some instances the variations may be traced to the soil,  as in the following analyses of the fruit of the horse-chesnut, grown on  an ordinary forest soil, and on a rich soil, produced by the  disintegration of porphyritic rock, in which the latter yields a much  larger quantity of ash:--                      Kernel of seed.  Green husk.   Brown husk.  Forest soil        2.26             4.53          1.70  Porphyry soil      3.36             7.29          2.20    In the majority of instances we fail to establish any connection between  the nature of the soil and the plants it yields, chiefly because we are  still very deficient in analyses of those grown on uncultivated soils;  and on cultivated land it is impossible to draw conclusions, because the  nature of the manure exerts an influence quite as great, if not greater,  than that of the soil itself.    The relative proportion in which the different mineral matters enter  into the composition of the ash varies within very wide limits, as will  be apparent from the following table, containing a selection of the best  analyses of our common cultivated and a few uncultivated plants.      _Table of the Composition of the Ash of different Plants in 100 Parts._    _Note._--Alumina and oxide of manganese occur so rarely, that separate  columns have not been introduced for them, but their quantity is stated  in notes at the end of the table.

South Africa, Its Cause and Conduct (#15)"],[1,"Rose  Innes amongst the British, and de Villiers among those who had  Africander sympathies. Both the Transvaal and the British Governments  agreed that such a tribunal was competent, but they disagreed upon the  point that the British Government desired to reserve some subjects from  this arbitration.    The desire upon the part of Great Britain to exclude outsiders from the  arbitration tribunal was due to the fact that to admit them was to give  away the case before going into Court. The Transvaal claimed to be a  sovereign international state. Great Britain denied it. If the Transvaal  could appeal to arbitration as a peer among peers in a court of nations,  she became _ipso facto_ an international state. Therefore Great Britain  refused such a court.    But why not refer all subjects to such a South African court as was  finally accepted by both sides? The answer is that it is a monstrous  hypocrisy to carry cases into an arbitration court, when you know  beforehand that by their very nature they cannot possibly be settled by  such a court. To quote Milner's words, 'It is, of course, absurd to  suggest that the question whether the South African Republic does or  does not treat British residents in that country with justice, and the  British Government with the consideration and respect due to any  friendly, not to say suzerain power, is a question capable of being  referred to arbitration. You cannot arbitrate on broad questions of  policy any more than on questions of national honour.' On this point of  the limitation of arbitration the Transvaal leaders appear to have been  as unanimous as the British, so that it is untrue to lay the blame of  the restriction upon one side only. Mr. Reitz, in his scheme of  arbitration formulated upon June 9, has the express clause 'That each  side shall have the right to reserve and exclude points which appear to  it to be too important to be submitted to arbitration.' To this the  British Government agreed, making the further very great concession that  an Orange Free Stater should not be regarded as a foreigner. The matter  was in this state when the Transvaal sent its ultimatum. Up to the  firing of the first shot the British Government still offered the only  form of arbitration which was possible without giving away the question  at issue. It was the Transvaal which, after agreeing to such a Court,  turned suddenly to the arbitrament of the Mauser and the Creusot.    7. _That the war was to avenge Majuba._--There can be no doubt that our  defeat in this skirmish had left considerable heart-burnings which were  not allayed by the subsequent attitude of the Boers and their  assumption, testified to by Bryce and other friendly observers, that  what we did after the action was due not to a magnanimous desire to  repair a wrong but to craven fear. From the outset of the war there was  a strong desire on the part of the soldiers to avenge Majuba, which was  fully gratified when, upon the anniversary of that day, Cronje and his  4,000 brave companions had to raise the white flag. But that a desire to  avenge Majuba swayed the policy of the country cannot be upheld in view  of the fact that eighteen years had elapsed; that during that time the  Boers had again and again broken the conventions by extending their  boundaries; that three times matters were in such a position that war  might have resulted and yet that peace was successfully maintained. War  might very easily have been forced upon the Boers during the years  before they turned their country into an arsenal, when it would have  been absolutely impossible for them to have sustained a long campaign.  That it was not done and that the British Government remained patient  until it received the outrageous ultimatum, is a proof that Majuba may  have rankled in our memory but was not allowed to influence our policy.    8. _What proof is there that the Boers ever had any aggressive designs  upon the British?_--It would be a misuse of terms to call the general  Boer designs against the British a conspiracy, for it was openly  advocated in the press, preached from the pulpit, and preached upon the  platform, that the Dutch should predominate in South Africa, and that  the portion of it which remained under the British flag should be  absorbed by that which was outside it. So widespread and deep-seated was  this ambition, that it was evident that Great Britain must, sooner or  later, either yield to it or else sustain her position by force of arms.  She was prepared to give Dutch citizens within her borders the vote, the  power of making their own laws, complete religious and political  freedom, and everything which their British comrades could have, without  any distinction whatever; but when it came to hauling down the flag, it  was certainly time that a stand should be made.    How this came about cannot be expressed more clearly than in the words  of Paul Botha, who, as I have already said, was a voortrekker like  Kruger himself, and a Boer of the Boers, save that he seems to have been  a man with wider and more liberal views than his fellows. He was member  for Kroonstadt in the Free State Raad.    'I am convinced,' he says, 'that Kruger's influence completely changed  the character of the Afrikander Bond--an organisation which I believe  Hofmeyr started at the Cape with the legitimate purpose of securing  certain political privileges, but which, under Kruger's henchmen--Sauer,  Merriman, Te Water, and others--raised unrest in the Cape Colony.    'This successful anti-British policy of Kruger created a number of  imitators--Steyn, Fischer, Esselen, Smuts, and numerous other young  educated Africanders of the Transvaal, Orange Free State, and the Cape  Colony, who, misled by his successes, ambitiously hoped by the same  means to raise themselves to the same pinnacle.    'Krugerism under them developed into a reign of terror. If you were  anti-Kruger you were stigmatised as \"Engelschgezind,\" and a traitor to  your people, unworthy of a hearing. I have suffered bitterly from this  taunt, especially under Steyn's _regime_. The more hostile you were to  England the greater patriot you were accounted.    'This gang, which I wish to be clearly understood was spread over the  whole of South Africa, the Transvaal, the Orange Free State, and the  Cape Colony, used the Bond, the press, and the pulpit to further its  schemes.    'Reitz, whom I believe to have been an honest enthusiast, set himself up  as second sponsor to the Bond and voiced the doctrine of this gang:  \"Africa for the Africanders. Sweep the English into the sea.\" With an  alluring cry like this, it will be readily understood how easy it was to  inflame the imagination of the illiterate and uneducated Boer, and to  work upon his vanity and prejudices. That pernicious rag, Carl  Borckenhagen's \"Bloemfontein Express,\" enormously contributed to  spreading this doctrine in the Orange Free State. I myself firmly  believe that the \"Express\" was subsidised by Kruger. It was no mystery  to me from where Borckenhagen, a full-blooded German, got his ardent  Free State patriotism.    'In the Transvaal this was done by the \"Volksstem,\" written by a  Hollander and subsidised by Kruger; by the \"Rand Post,\" also written by  a Hollander, also subsidised by Paul Kruger; and in the Cape Colony by  the \"Patriot,\" which was started by intriguers and rebels to their own  Government, at the Paarl--a hot-bed of false Africanderism. \"Ons Land\"  may be an honest paper, but by fostering impossible ideas it has done us  incalculable harm. It grieves me to think that my poor people, through  want of education, had to swallow this poison undiluted.    'Is it possible to imagine that Steyn, Fischer, and the other educated  men of the Free State did not know that, following Kruger's hostile  policy of eliminating the preponderating Power in South Africa, meant  that that Power would be forced either to fight in self-preservation or  to disappear ignominiously? For I maintain that there were only two  courses open to England in answer to Kruger's challenging policy--to  fight or to retire from South Africa. It was only possible for men  suffering from tremendously swollen heads, such as our leaders were  suffering from, not to see the obvious or to doubt the issue.'    So much for a Boer's straightforward account of the forces at work, and  the influences which were at the back of those forces. It sums the  situation up tersely, but the situation itself was evident and dominated  Cape politics. The ambitions of Africanderdom were discussed in the  broad light of day in the editorial, in the sermon, in the speech,  though the details by which those ambitions were to be carried out were  only whispered on the Dutch stoeps.    Here are the opinions of Reitz, the man who more than all others, save  his master, has the blood of the fallen upon his conscience. It is taken  from the 'Reminiscences' of Mr. Theophilus Schreiner, the brother of the  ex-Prime Minister of the Cape:    'I met Mr. Reitz, then a judge of the Orange Free State, in Bloemfontein  between seventeen and eighteen years ago, shortly after the retrocession  of the Transvaal, and when he was busy establishing the Afrikander Bond.  It must be patent to everyone that at that time, at all events, England  and its Government had no intention of taking away the independence of  the Transvaal, for she had just \"magnanimously\" granted the same; no  intention of making war on the republics, for she had just made peace;  no intention to seize the Rand gold fields, for they were not yet  discovered. At that time, then, I met Mr. Reitz, and he did his best to  get me to become a member of his Afrikander Bond, but, after studying  its constitution and programme, I refused to do so, whereupon the  following colloquy in substance took place between us, which has been  indelibly imprinted on my mind ever since:    '_Reitz_: Why do you refuse?"]]]
