One player may have difficulty in playing trills, while to another  player of equal general musical ability trills may be perfectly easy. In  playing arpeggios, however, the difficulties which prove obstacles to  the players may be entirely reversed. The one who could play the trill  perfectly might not be able, under any circumstance, to play an arpeggio  with the requisite smoothness and true legato demanded, while the  student who found the trill impossible possesses the ability to run  arpeggios and cadenzas with the fluency of a forest rivulet.    \"All technical exercises must be given to the pupil with great  discretion and judgment just as poisonous medicines must be administered  to the patient with great care. The indiscriminate giving of technical  exercises may impede progress rather than advance the pupil. Simply  because an exercise happens to come in a certain position in a book of  technical exercises is no reason why the particular pupil being taught  needs that exercise at that particular time. Some exercises which are  not feasible and others which are inexpedient at a certain time, may  prove invaluable later in the pupil's progress.    \"Take the famous Tausig exercises, for instance. Tausig was a master of  technic who had few, if any, equals in his time. His exercises are for  the most part very ingenious and useful to advanced players, but when  some of them are transposed into other keys as their composer demands  they become practically impossible to play with the proper touch, etc.  Furthermore, one would be very unlikely to find a passage demanding such  a technical feat in the compositions of any of the great masters of the  piano. Consequently, such exercises are of no practical value and would  only be demanded by a teacher with more respect for tradition than  common sense.      DETAILS OF PHRASING AND ACCENTUATION    \"Some students look upon phrasing as a detail that can be postponed  until other supposedly more important things are accomplished. The very  musical meaning of any composition depends upon the correct  understanding and delivery of the phrases which make that composition.  To neglect the phrases would be about as sensible as it would be for the  great actor to neglect the proper thought division in the interpretation  of his lines. The greatest masterpiece of dramatic literature whether it  be _Romeo and Juliet_, _Antigone_, _La Malade Imaginaire_ or _The Doll's  House_ becomes nonsense if the thought divisions indicated by the  verbal phrases are not carefully determined and expressed.    \"Great actors spend hours and hours seeking for the best method of  expressing the author's meaning. No pianist of ability would think of  giving less careful attention to phrasing. How stupid it would be for  the actor to add a word that concluded one sentence to the beginning of  the next sentence. How erroneous then is it for the pupil to add the  last note of one phrase to the beginning of the next phrase. Phrasing is  anything but a detail.    \"Fine phrasing depends first upon a knowledge of music which enables one  to define the limitations of the phrase and then upon a knowledge of  pianoforte playing which enables one to execute it properly. Phrasing is  closely allied to the subject of accentuation and both subjects are  intimately connected with that of fingering. Without the proper fingers  it is often impossible to execute certain phrases correctly. Generally,  the accents are considered of importance because they are supposed to  fall in certain set parts of given measures, thus indicating the meter.    \"In instructing very young pupils it may be necessary to lead them to  believe that the time must be marked in a definite manner by such  accents, but as the pupil advances he must understand that the measure  divisions are inserted principally for the purpose of enabling him to  read easily. He should learn to look upon each piece of music as a  beautiful tapestry in which the main consideration is the principal  design of the work as a whole and not the invisible marking threads  which the manufacturer is obliged to put in the loom in order to have a  structure upon which the tapestry may be woven.      BACH, BACH, BACH    \"In the study of the subject of accentuation and phrasing it would not  be possible for anyone to recommend anything more instructive than the  works of Johann Sebastian Bach. The immortal Thueringian composer was the  master-weaver of all. His tapestries have never been equalled in  refinement, color, breadth and general beauty. Why is Bach so valuable  for the student? This is an easy question to answer. It is because his  works are so constructed that they compel one to study these details.  Even if the student has only mastered the intricacies of the _Two Voice  Inventions_, it is safe to say that he has become a better player. More  than this, Bach forces the student to think.    \"If the student has never thought before during his practice periods, he  will soon find that it is quite impossible for him to encompass the  difficulties of Bach without the closest mental application. In fact, he  may also discover that it is possible for him to work out some of his  musical problems while away from the keyboard. Many of the most  perplexing musical questions and difficulties that have ever confronted  me have been solved mentally while I have been walking upon the street  or lying in bed at night.    \"Sometimes the solution of difficult details comes in the twinkling of  an eye. I remember that when I was a very young man I was engaged to  play a concerto with a large symphony orchestra. One part of the  concerto had always troubled me, and I was somewhat apprehensive about  it. During one of the pauses, while the orchestra was playing, the  correct interpretation came to me like a flash. I waited until the  orchestra was playing very loud and made an opportunity to run over the  difficult passage. Of course, my playing could not be heard under the  _tutti_ of the orchestra, and when the time came for the proper delivery  of the passage it was vastly better than it would have been otherwise.    \"I never neglect an opportunity to improve, no matter how perfect a  previous interpretation may have seemed to me. In fact, I often go  directly home from the concert and practice for hours upon the very  pieces that I have been playing, because during the concert certain new  ideas have come to me. These ideas are very precious, and to neglect  them or to consider them details to be postponed for future development  would be ridiculous in the extreme.\"      QUESTIONS ON STYLE, INTERPRETATION, EXPRESSION  AND TECHNIC OF PIANO PLAYING    SERIES V    FERRUCCIO BENVENUTO BUSONI    1.

TERESA CARRENO    BIOGRAPHICAL      Teresa Carreno was born at Caracas, Venezuela, December 22, 1853. She  descended from one of the foremost families of Spanish America, which  boasted of Simon Bolivar \"the Washington of South America\" as one of its  members. Artists have been known among her ancestors as far back as the  fourteenth century when the famous painter Carreno lived in Spain.    Mme. Carreno's first teacher was her father. Later she studied with a  German teacher in her native country. At seven she played the _Rondo  Capriccio_ of Mendelssohn with great _eclat_. A revolution obliged the  Carreno family to move to New York. The death of a friend to whom funds  had been entrusted placed the party of eighteen refugees in dire straits  and a concert was arranged at which the tiny Teresa came to the front  and secured sufficient means for their existence.    Gottschalk, then in the height of his fame in New York, became the  child's next teacher. She remained with him for two years. Then she went  to Paris and became a pupil of Georges Mathias, the famous disciple of  Chopin. Her success as a virtuoso pianist in Europe excited the  attention of Rubinstein who devoted a great deal of time to giving her  invaluable advice and instruction in interpretation. Indeed Rubinstein  was so proud of her that he repeatedly introduced her as his daughter in  art and would jokingly say \"Are not our hands exactly alike?\"    Mme. Carreno's brilliance, force, breadth of thought and almost sensuous  love for the beautiful made her numerous tours through all of the  music-loving countries remarkably successful.    [Illustration: TERESA CARRENO]          VIII    DISTINCTIVE PIANO PLAYING    TERESA CARRENO      EARLY EVIDENCES OF INDIVIDUALITY    It is difficult for me to discuss the subject of individuality without  recollecting one of the most impressive and significant events of my  entire career. When I was taken to Europe as a child, for further study,  it was my good fortune to meet and play for the immortal Franz Liszt. He  seemed deeply interested in my playing, and with the kindliness for  which he was always noted he gave me his blessing, a kind of artistic  sacrament that has had a tremendous influence upon all my work as an  artist. He laid his hand upon my head and among other things said:  \"Little girl, with time you will be one of us. Don't imitate anyone.  Keep yourself true to yourself."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28039"],[0,"History of Woman Suffrage, Volume II (#15)"],[1,"under? why       did you not, with a stroke of the pen, determine--when you       acquired your own independence--that the principles which you       adopted in the Declaration of Independence should be a shield of       protection to every man, whether he be slave or whether he be       free?\" But, my friends, the experience of sixty years has shown       me that the fruit grows slowly. I look back and see that great       Sower of the world, as he traveled the streets of Jerusalem and       dropped the precious seed, \"Do unto others as ye would that       others should do unto you.\" I look at all the contests of       different nations, and see that, whether it were the Patricians       of Rome, England, France, or any part of Europe, every battle       fought gained something to freedom. Our fathers, driven out by       the oppression of England, came to this country and planted that       little seed of liberty upon the soil of New England. When our       Revolution took place, the seed was only in the process of       sprouting. You must recollect that our Declaration of       Independence was the very first National evidence of the great       doctrine of brotherhood and equality. I verily believe that those       who were the true lovers of liberty did all they could at that       time. In their debates in the Convention they denounced       slavery--they protested against the hypocrisy and inconsistency       of a nation declaring such glorious truths, and then trampling       them underfoot by enslaving the poor and oppressed, because he       had a skin not colored like their own; as though a man's skin       should make any difference in the recognition of his rights, any       more than the color of his hair or of his eyes. This little blade       sprouted as it were from the precious seeds that were planted by       Jesus of Nazareth. But, my friends, if it took eighteen hundred       years to bring forth the little blade which was seen in our       Declaration, are we not unreasonable to suppose that more could       have been done than has been done, looking at the imperfections       of human nature, looking at the selfishness of man, looking at       his desire for wealth and his greed for glory?         Had the South yielded at that time to the freemen of the North,       we should have had a free Government; but it was impossible to       overcome the long and strong prejudices of the South in favor of       slavery. I know what the South is. I lived there the best part of       my life. I never could talk against slavery without making my       friends angry--never. When they thought the day was far off, and       there was no danger of emancipation, they were willing to admit       it was an evil; but when God in His providence raised up in this       country an Anti-slavery Society, protesting against the       oppressions of the colored man, they began to feel that truth       which is more powerful than arms--that truth which is the only       banner under which we can successfully fight. They were       comparatively quiet till they found, in the election of Mr.       Lincoln, the scepter had actually departed from them. His       election took place on the ground that slavery was not to be       extended--that it must not pass into the Territories. This was       what alarmed them. They saw that if the National Government       should take one such step, it never would stop there; that this       principle had never before been acknowledged by those who had any       power in the nation.         God be praised. Abolitionists never sought place or power. All       they asked was freedom; all they wanted was that the white man       should take his foot off the negro's neck. The South determined       to resist the election of Mr. Lincoln. They determined if Fremont       was elected, they would rebel. And this rebellion is like their       own Republic, as they call it; it is founded upon slavery. As I       asked one of my friends one day, \"What are you rebelling for? The       North never made any laws for you that they have not cheerfully       obeyed themselves. What is the trouble between us?\" Slavery,       slavery is the trouble. Slavery is a \"divine institution.\" My       friends, it is a fact that the South has incorporated slavery       into her religion; that is the most fearful thing in this       rebellion. They are fighting, verily believing that they are       doing God service. Most of them have never seen the North. They       understand very little of the working of our institutions; but       their politicians are stung to the quick by the prosperity of the       North. They see that the institution which they have established       can not make them wealthy, can not make them happy, can not make       them respected in the world at large, and their motto is, \"Rule       or ruin.\"         Before I close, I would like, however strange it may seem, to       utter a protest against what Mrs. Stanton said of colonizing the       aristocrats in Liberia. I can not consent to such a thing. Do you       know that Liberia has never let a slave tread her soil?--that       when, from the interior of the country, the slaves came there to       seek shelter, and their heathen masters pursued them, she never       surrendered one? She stands firmly on the platform of freedom to       all. I am deeply interested in this colony of Liberia. I do not       want it to be cursed with the aristocracy of the South, or any       other aristocracy, and far less with the Copperheadism of the       North. (Laughter). If these Southern aristocrats are to be       colonized, Mrs. President, don't you think England is the best       place for them? England is the country which has sympathized most       deeply with them. She has allowed vessels to be built to prey       upon our commerce; she has sent them arms and ammunition, and       everything she could send through the West India Islands. Shall       we send men to Liberia who are ready to tread the black man under       their feet? No. God bless Liberia for what she has done, and what       she is destined to do. (Applause).         I am very glad to say here, that last summer I had the pleasure       of entertaining several times, in our house, a Liberian who was       well educated in England. He had graduated at Oxford College, and       had a high position there. His health broke down, and he went to       Liberia. \"When I went to Liberia,\" said he, \"I had a first-rate       education, and I supposed, of course, I would be a very superior       man there; but I soon found that, though I knew a great deal more       Greek and Latin and mathematics than most of the men there, I was       a child to them in the science of government and history. Why,\"       said he, \"you have no idea of the progress of Liberia. The men       who go there are freemen--citizens; the burdens of society are       upon them; and they feel that they must begin to educate       themselves, and they are self-educated men. The President of       Liberia, Mr. Benson, was a slave about seven years ago on a       plantation in this country. He went to Liberia. He was a man of       uncommon talents. He educated himself to the duties which he       found himself called upon to perform as a citizen. And when Mr.       Benson visited England a year ago, he had a perfect ovation. The       white ladies and gentlemen of England, those who were really       anti-slavery in their feelings--who love liberty--followed him       wherever he went. They opened their houses, they had their       _soirees_, and they welcomed him by every kind of demonstration       of their good wishes for Liberia.\"         Now, Mrs. President, the great object that I had in view in       rising, was to give you a representative from South Carolina.       (Applause). I mourn exceedingly that she has taken the position       she has. I once had a brother who, had he been there, would have       stood by Judge Pettigrew in his protest against the action of the       South. He, many years ago, during the time of nullification in       1832, was in the Senate of South Carolina, and delivered an able       address, in which he discussed these very points, and showed that       the South had no right of secession; that, in becoming an       integral part of the United States, they had themselves       voluntarily surrendered that right. And he remarked, \"If you       persist in this contest, you will be like a girdled tree, which       must perish and die. You can not stand.\" (Applause).         THE PRESIDENT (Lucy Stone): Mrs. Weld thinks it would be too bad       to send the Southern aristocrats and Northern copperheads to       Liberia: I do not know but it would. I am equally sure that it       would be too bad to send them among the laboring people of       England, who are thoroughly, heartily, and wholly on the side of       the loyal North. They ought not to be sent there. I would       suggest, when they are fairly subdued, that we should send them       to London to make a part of the staff of the London _Times_. I       think they would do better there than anywhere else. (Laughter).    The Hutchinson Family being present, varied the proceedings with their  inspiring songs. Lucy Stone, in introducing them, said Gen. McClellan  was not willing they should sing on the other side of the Potomac, but  we are glad to hear them everywhere. Susan B. Anthony presented a  series of resolutions,[43] and said:         There is great fear expressed on all sides lest this war shall be       made a war for the negro. I am willing that it shall be. It is a       war to found an empire on the negro in slavery, and shame on us       if we do not make it a war to establish the negro in       freedom--against whom the whole nation, North and South, East and       West, in one mighty conspiracy, has"]]]
