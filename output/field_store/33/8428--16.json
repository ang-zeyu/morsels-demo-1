He had put his trust in  a class of men who hated his office, his family, his person, with  implacable hatred. He had ruined himself in the vain attempt to  conciliate them. He had relieved them, in defiance of law and of the  unanimous sense of the old royalist party, from the pressure of the  penal code; had allowed them to worship God publicly after their own  mean and tasteless fashion; had admitted them to the bench of justice  and to the Privy Council; had gratified them with fur robes, gold  chains, salaries, and pensions. In return for his liberality, these  people, once so uncouth in demeanour, once so savage in opposition even  to legitimate authority, had become the most abject of flatterers. They  had continued to applaud and encourage him when the most devoted friends  of his family had retired in shame and sorrow from his palace. Who had  more foully sold the religion and liberty of his country than Titus? Who  had been more zealous for the dispensing power than Alsop? Who had urged  on the persecution of the seven Bishops more fiercely than Lobb? What  chaplain impatient for a deanery had ever, even when preaching in the  royal presence on the thirtieth of January or the twenty-ninth of  May, uttered adulation more gross than might easily be found in  those addresses by which dissenting congregations had testified their  gratitude for the illegal Declaration of Indulgence? Was it strange that  a prince who had never studied law books should have believed that  he was only exercising his rightful prerogative, when he was thus  encouraged by a faction which had always ostentatiously professed hatred  of arbitrary power? Misled by such guidance, he had gone further and  further in the wrong path: he had at length estranged from him hearts  which would once have poured forth their best blood in his defence: he  had left himself no supporters except his old foes; and, when the day  of peril came, he had found that the feeling of his old foes towards  him was still what it had been when they had attempted to rob him of his  inheritance, and when they had plotted against his life. Every man of  sense had long known that the sectaries bore no love to monarchy. It had  now been found that they bore as little love to freedom. To trust them  with power would be an error not less fatal to the nation than to the  throne. If, in order to redeem pledges somewhat rashly given, it should  be thought necessary to grant them relief, every concession ought to be  accompanied by limitations and precautions. Above all, no man who was  an enemy to the ecclesiastical constitution of the realm ought to be  permitted to bear any part in the civil government.    Between the nonconformists and the rigid conformists stood the Low  Church party. That party contained, as it still contains, two very  different elements, a Puritan element and a Latitudinarian element. On  almost every question, however, relating either to ecclesiastical polity  or to the ceremonial of public worship, the Puritan Low Churchman and  the Latitudinarian Low Churchman were perfectly agreed. They saw in the  existing polity and in the existing ceremonial no defect, no blemish,  which could make it their duty to become dissenters. Nevertheless they  held that both the polity and the ceremonial were means and not ends,  and that the essential spirit of Christianity might exist without  episcopal orders and without a Book of Common Prayer. They had, while  James was on the throne, been mainly instrumental in forming the great  Protestant coalition against Popery and tyranny; and they continued in  1689 to hold the same conciliatory language which they had held in  1688. They gently blamed the scruples of the nonconformists. It was  undoubtedly a great weakness to imagine that there could be any sin in  wearing a white robe, in tracing a cross, in kneeling at the rails of an  altar. But the highest authority had given the plainest directions as  to the manner in which such weakness was to be treated. The weak brother  was not to be judged: he was not to be despised: believers who had  stronger minds were commanded to soothe him by large compliances, and  carefully to remove out of his path every stumbling block which could  cause him to offend. An apostle had declared that, though he had himself  no misgivings about the use of animal food or of wine, he would eat  herbs and drink water rather than give scandal to the feeblest of his  flock. What would he have thought of ecclesiastical rulers who, for the  sake of a vestment, a gesture, a posture, had not only torn the Church  asunder, but had filled all the gaols of England with men of orthodox  faith and saintly life? The reflections thrown by the High Churchmen on  the recent conduct of the dissenting body the Low Churchmen pronounced  to be grossly unjust. The wonder was, not that a few nonconformists  should have accepted with thanks an indulgence which, illegal as it  was, had opened the doors of their prisons and given security to their  hearths, but that the nonconformists generally should have been true  to the cause of a constitution from the benefits of which they had been  long excluded. It was most unfair to impute to a great party the faults  of a few individuals. Even among the Bishops of the Established Church  James had found tools and sycophants. The conduct of Cartwright and  Parker had been much more inexcusable than that of Alsop and Lobb. Yet  those who held the dissenters answerable for the errors of Alsop and  Lobb would doubtless think it most unreasonable to hold the Church  answerable for the far deeper guilt of Cartwright and Parker.    The Low Church clergymen were a minority, and not a large minority, of  their profession: but their weight was much more than proportioned to  their numbers: for they mustered strong in the capital: they had great  influence there; and the average of intellect and knowledge was higher  among them than among their order generally. We should probably overrate  their numerical strength, if we were to estimate them at a tenth part  of the priesthood. Yet it will scarcely be denied that there were among  them as many men of distinguished eloquence and learning as could be  found in the other nine tenths. Among the laity who conformed to the  established religion the parties were not unevenly balanced. Indeed  the line which separated them deviated very little from the line which  separated the Whigs and the Tories. In the House of Commons, which  had been elected when the Whigs were triumphant, the Low Church party  greatly preponderated. In the Lords there was an almost exact equipoise;  and very slight circumstances sufficed to turn the scale.    The head of the Low Church party was the King. He had been bred a  Presbyterian: he was, from rational conviction, a Latitudinarian; and  personal ambition, as well as higher motives, prompted him to act as  mediator among Protestant sects. He was bent on effecting three great  reforms in the laws touching ecclesiastical matters. His first object  was to obtain for dissenters permission to celebrate their worship in  freedom and security. His second object was to make such changes in  the Anglican ritual and polity as, without offending those to whom  that ritual and polity were dear, might conciliate the moderate  nonconformists. His third object was to throw open civil offices to  Protestants without distinction of sect. All his three objects were  good; but the first only was at that time attainable. He came too late  for the second, and too early for the third.    A few days after his accession, he took a step which indicated, in a  manner not to be mistaken, his sentiments touching ecclesiastical polity  and public worship. He found only one see unprovided with a Bishop. Seth  Ward, who had during many years had charge of the diocese of Salisbury,  and who had been honourably distinguished as one of the founders of  the Royal Society, having long survived his faculties, died while  the country was agitated by the elections for the Convention, without  knowing that great events, of which not the least important had passed  under his own roof, had saved his Church and his country from ruin. The  choice of a successor was no light matter. That choice would inevitably  be considered by the country as a prognostic of the highest import.  The King too might well be perplexed by the number of divines whose  erudition, eloquence, courage, and uprightness had been conspicuously  displayed during the contentions of the last three years. The preference  was given to Burnet. His claims were doubtless great. Yet William might  have had a more tranquil reign if he had postponed for a time the well  earned promotion of his chaplain, and had bestowed the first great  spiritual preferment, which, after the Revolution, fell to the  disposal of the Crown, on some eminent theologian, attached to the new  settlement, yet not generally hated by the clergy. Unhappily the name  of Burnet was odious to the great majority of the Anglican priesthood.  Though, as respected doctrine, he by no means belonged to the extreme  section of the Latitudinarian party, he was popularly regarded as the  personification of the Latitudinarian spirit. This distinction he owed  to the prominent place which he held in literature and politics, to the  readiness of his tongue and of his pert, and above all to the frankness  and boldness of his nature, frankness which could keep no secret, and  boldness which flinched from no danger. He had formed but a low estimate  of the character of his clerical brethren considered as a body; and,  with his usual indiscretion, he frequently suffered his opinion to  escape him. They hated him in return with a hatred which has descended  to their successors, and which, after the lapse of a century and a half,  does not appear to languish.    As soon as the King's decision was known, the question"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2613"],[0,"The History of England, from the Accession of James II â€” Volume 4 (#15)"],[1,"of twelve  persons. The nominal command of the army he had confided to Berwick; but  Berwick, though, as was afterwards proved, a man of no common courage  and capacity, was young and inexperienced. His powers were unsuspected  by the world and by himself; [77] and he submitted without reluctance  to the tutelage of a Council of War nominated by the Lord Lieutenant.  Neither the Council of Regency nor the Council of War was popular at  Limerick. The Irish complained that men who were not Irish had been  entrusted with a large share in the administration. The cry was loudest  against an officer named Thomas Maxwell. For it was certain that he was  a Scotchman; it was doubtful whether he was a Roman Catholic; and he had  not concealed the dislike which he felt for that Celtic Parliament which  had repealed the Act of Settlement and passed the Act of Attainder.  [78] The discontent, fomented by the arts of intriguers, among whom  the cunning and unprincipled Henry Luttrell seems to have been the most  active, soon broke forth into open rebellion. A great meeting was held.  Many officers of the army, some peers, some lawyers of high note and  some prelates of the Roman Catholic Church were present. It was resolved  that the government set up by the Lord Lieutenant was unknown to the  constitution. Ireland, it was said, could be legally governed, in the  absence of the King, only by a Lord Lieutenant, by a Lord Deputy or by  Lords Justices. The King was absent. The Lord Lieutenant was absent.  There was no Lord Deputy. There were no Lords Justices. The Act by  which Tyrconnel had delegated his authority to a junto composed of his  creatures was a mere nullity. The nation was therefore left without any  legitimate chief, and might, without violating the allegiance due to  the Crown, make temporary provision for its own safety. A deputation was  sent to inform Berwick that he had assumed a power to which he had  no right, but that nevertheless the army and people of Ireland would  willingly acknowledge him as their head if he would consent to govern by  the advice of a council truly Irish. Berwick indignantly expressed his  wonder that military men should presume to meet and deliberate without  the permission of their general. They answered that there was no  general, and that, if His Grace did not choose to undertake the  administration on the terms proposed, another leader would easily be  found. Berwick very reluctantly yielded, and continued to be a puppet in  a new set of hands. [79]    Those who had effected this revolution thought it prudent to send a  deputation to France for the purpose of vindicating their proceedings.  Of the deputation the Roman Catholic Bishop of Cork and the two  Luttrells were members. In the ship which conveyed them from Limerick  to Brest they found a fellow passenger whose presence was by no means  agreeable to them, their enemy, Maxwell. They suspected, and not without  reason, that he was going, like them, to Saint Germains, but on a very  different errand. The truth was that Berwick had sent Maxwell to watch  their motions and to traverse their designs. Henry Luttrell, the least  scrupulous of men, proposed to settle the matter at once by tossing the  Scotchman into the sea. But the Bishop, who was a man of conscience,  and Simon Luttrell, who was a man of honour, objected to this expedient.  [80]    Meanwhile at Limerick the supreme power was in abeyance. Berwick,  finding that he had no real authority, altogether neglected business,  and gave himself up to such pleasures as that dreary place of banishment  afforded. There was among the Irish chiefs no man of sufficient weight  and ability to control the rest. Sarsfield for a time took the lead. But  Sarsfield, though eminently brave and active in the field, was little  skilled in the administration of war, and still less skilled in civil  business. Those who were most desirous to support his authority were  forced to own that his nature was too unsuspicious and indulgent for  a post in which it was hardly possible to be too distrustful or too  severe. He believed whatever was told him. He signed whatever was set  before him. The commissaries, encouraged by his lenity, robbed and  embezzled more shamelessly than ever. They sallied forth daily, guarded  by pikes and firelocks, to seize, nominally for the public service, but  really for themselves, wool, linen, leather, tallow, domestic utensils,  instruments of husbandry, searched every pantry, every wardrobe, every  cellar, and even laid sacrilegious hands on the property of priests and  prelates. [81]    Early in the spring the government, if it is to be so called, of  which Berwick was the ostensible head, was dissolved by the return of  Tyrconnel. The Luttrells had, in the name of their countrymen, implored  James not to subject so loyal a people to so odious and incapable a  viceroy. Tyrconnel, they said, was old; he was infirm; he needed much  sleep; he knew nothing of war; he was dilatory; he was partial; he was  rapacious; he was distrusted and hated by the whole nation. The Irish,  deserted by him, had made a gallant stand, and had compelled the  victorious army of the Prince of Orange to retreat. They hoped soon to  take the field again, thirty thousand strong; and they adjured their  King to send them some captain worthy to command such a force. Tyrconnel  and Maxwell, on the other hand, represented the delegates as mutineers,  demagogues, traitors, and pressed James to send Henry Luttrell to  keep Mountjoy company in the Bastille. James, bewildered by these  criminations and recriminations, hesitated long, and at last, with  characteristic wisdom, relieved himself from trouble by giving all the  quarrellers fair words and by sending them all back to have their fight  out in Ireland. Berwick was at the same time recalled to France. [82]    Tyrconnel was received at Limerick, even by his enemies, with decent  respect. Much as they hated him, they could not question the validity  of his commission; and, though they still maintained that they had  been perfectly justified in annulling, during his absence, the  unconstitutional arrangements which he had made, they acknowledged that,  when he was present, he was their lawful governor. He was not altogether  unprovided with the means of conciliating them. He brought many gracious  messages and promises, a patent of peerage for Sarsfield, some  money which was not of brass, and some clothing, which was even more  acceptable than money. The new garments were not indeed very fine. But  even the generals had long been out at elbows; and there were few of the  common men whose habiliments would have been thought sufficient to dress  a scarecrow in a more prosperous country. Now, at length, for the first  time in many months, every private soldier could boast of a pair of  breeches and a pair of brogues. The Lord Lieutenant had also been  authorised to announce that he should soon be followed by several ships,  laden with provisions and military stores. This announcement was most  welcome to the troops, who had long been without bread, and who had  nothing stronger than water to drink. [83]    During some weeks the supplies were impatiently expected. At last,  Tyrconnel was forced to shut himself up; for, whenever he appeared in  public, the soldiers ran after him clamouring for food. Even the beef  and mutton, which, half raw, half burned, without vegetables, without  salt, had hitherto supported the army, had become scarce; and the common  men were on rations of horseflesh when the promised sails were seen in  the mouth of the Shannon. [84]    A distinguished French general, named Saint Ruth, was on board with his  staff. He brought a commission which appointed him commander in chief of  the Irish army. The commission did not expressly declare that he was to  be independent of the viceregal authority; but he had been assured by  James that Tyrconnel should have secret instructions not to intermeddle  in the conduct of the war. Saint Ruth was assisted by another general  officer named D'Usson. The French ships brought some arms, some  ammunition, and a plentiful supply of corn and flour. The spirits of the  Irish rose; and the Te Deum was chaunted with fervent devotion in the  cathedral of Limerick. [85]    Tyrconnel had made no preparations for the approaching campaign. But  Saint Ruth, as soon as he had landed, exerted himself strenuously to  redeem the time which had been lost. He was a man of courage, activity  and resolution, but of a harsh and imperious nature. In his own country  he was celebrated as the most merciless persecutor that had ever  dragooned the Huguenots to mass. It was asserted by English Whigs that  he was known in France by the nickname of the Hangman; that, at Rome,  the very cardinals had shown their abhorrence of his cruelty; and  that even Queen Christina, who had little right to be squeamish about  bloodshed, had turned away from him with loathing. He had recently held  a command in Savoy. The Irish regiments in the French service had formed  part of his army, and had behaved extremely well. It was therefore  supposed that he had a peculiar talent for managing Irish troops. But  there was a wide difference between the well clad, well armed and well  drilled Irish, with whom he was familiar, and the ragged marauders whom  he found swarming in the alleys of Limerick. Accustomed to the splendour  and the discipline of French camps and garrisons, he was disgusted by  finding that, in the country to which he had been sent, a regiment of  infantry meant a mob of people as naked, as dirty and as disorderly  as the beggars, whom he had been accustomed to see on the Continent  besieging the door of a monastery or pursuing a diligence up him. With  ill concealed contempt, however, he addressed himself vigorously to the  task of disciplining these strange soldiers, and was day and night in  the saddle,"]]]
