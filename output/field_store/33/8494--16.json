[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29086"],[0,"The Mushroom, Edible and Otherwise (#15)"],[1,"Lake Shore line in  Wood County near Bowling Green, Ohio; and I have found it frequently  near Chillicothe. When cooked it has a pleasant flavor. It is always an  attractive specimen. I find it under beech trees in the woods, September  to November.      _Tricholoma unifactum. Pk._    UNITED TRICHOLOMA. EDIBLE.    Unifactum means united or made into one, referring to the stems united  in one base root or stem.    The pileus is fleshy but thin, convex; often irregular, sometimes  eccentric from its mode of growth; whitish, flesh whitish, taste mild.    The gills are thin, narrow, close, rounded behind, slightly adnexed,  sometimes forked near the base, white.    The stems are equal or thicker at the base, solid, fibrous, white,  united at the base in a large fleshy mass.    Spores are white, subglobose, .00016 to .0002 of an inch broad. _Peck._    I found a beautiful specimen in Poke Hollow, in a beech woods with some  oak and chestnut. There was but one cluster growing from a large whitish  fleshy mass. There were fifteen caps growing from this fleshy mass. I  could not identify species until too late to photograph.      _Tricholoma albellum. Fr._    THE WHITISH TRICHOLOMA. EDIBLE.    The pileus is two to three inches broad, becoming pale-white, passing  into gray when dry, fleshy, thick at the disk, thinner at the sides,  conical then convex, gibbous when expanded, when in vigor moist on the  surface, spotted as with scales, the thin margin naked, flesh soft,  floccose, white, unchangeable.    The gills are very much attenuated behind, not emarginate, becoming  broad in front; very crowded, quite entire, white.    The stem is one to two inches long, solid, fleshy-compact, ovate-bulbous  (conical to the middle, cylindrical above), fibrillose-striate, white.  Spores elliptical, 6-7x4u.      _Tricholoma personatum. Fr._    THE MASKED TRICHOLOMA. EDIBLE.    [Illustration: Figure 61.--Tricholoma personatum. One-third natural  size. Caps usually tinged with lilac or violet. Stems bulbous.]    [Illustration: Figure 62.--Tricholoma personatum. Two-thirds natural  size. The entire plant white.]    Personatum means wearing a mask; so called because of the variety of  colors it undergoes. This is a beautiful mushroom, and is excellently  flavored; it has a wide range and is frequently found, in great  abundance. I have often seen it growing in almost a straight line for  over twenty feet, the caps so thoroughly crowded that they had lost  their form. When young the cap is convex and quite firm, with the margin  minutely downy or adorned with mealy particles, and incurved. In the  mature plant it is softer, broadly convex, or nearly plane, with the  thin margin spreading and more or less turned upward and wavy. When  young it is pale lilac in color, but with advancing age it changes to a  tawny or rusty hue, especially in the center. Sometimes the cap is  white, whitish or gray, or of a pale violaceous color.    The gills are crowded, rounded next to the stem, and nearly free but  approaching close to the stem, more narrow toward the margin, with a  faint tinge of lilac or violet tint when young, but often white.    The stem is short, solid, adorned with very minute fibers, downy or  mealy particles when young and fresh, but becoming smooth with  advancing age. The color of the stem is much like the cap but perhaps a  shade lighter.    The cap is from one to five inches broad, and the stem from one to three  inches high. It grows singly or in groups. It is found in thin woods and  thickets. It delights to grow where an old saw mill has stood.    The finest specimens of this species that I ever saw grew on a pile of  compost of what had been green cobs from the canning factory. They had  lain in the pile for about three years and late in November the compost  was literally covered with this species, many of whose caps exceeded  five inches while the color and figuration of the plants were quite  typical.    In English books this plant is spoken of as Blewits and in France as  Blue-stems, but the stems in this country are inclined to be lilac or  violet, and then only in the younger plants.    The spores are nearly elliptical and dingy white, but in masses on white  paper they have a salmon tint. Its smooth, almost shining, unbroken  epidermis and its peculiar peach-blossom tint distinguish it from all  other species of the Tricholoma. There is a white variety, very  plentiful in our woods, which is illustrated in Figure 62. They are  found only in leaf-mould in the woods. September to freezing weather.      _Tricholoma nudum. Bull._    THE NAKED TRICHOLOMA. EDIBLE.    Nudum, naked, bare; from the character of the margin. The pileus is two  to three inches broad, fleshy, rather thin, convex, then expanded,  slightly depressed; smooth, moist, the whole plant violet at first,  changing color, margin involute, thin, naked, often wavy.    The gills are narrow, rounded behind, slightly decurrent when the plant  becomes depressed, crowded, violet at first, changing to a reddish-brown  without any tinge of violet.    The stem is two to three inches long, stuffed, elastic, equal, at first  violaceous, then becoming pale, more or less mealy. Spores 7x3.5u    I found some very fine specimens among the leaves in the woods in  Haynes' Hollow, near Chillicothe. October and November.      _Tricholoma gambosum. Fr._    ST. GEORGE'S MUSHROOM. EDIBLE.    Gambosum, with a swelling of the hoof, _gamba_. The pileus is three to  six inches broad, sometimes even larger; very thick, convex, expanded,  depressed, commonly cracked here and there; smooth, suggesting soft kid  leather; margin involute at first, pale ochre or yellowish white.    The gills are notched, with an adnexed tooth, densely crowded,  ventricose, moist, various lengths, yellowish white.    The stem is short, solid, flocculose at apex, substance creamy white;  swollen slightly at the base. The spores are white.    It is called St. George's mushroom in England because it appears about  the time of St. George's day, April 23d. It frequently grows in rings or  crescents. It has a very strong odor. Its season is May and June.      _Tricholoma portentosum. Fr._    THE STRANGE TRICHOLOMA. EDIBLE.    [Illustration: Figure 63.--Tricholoma portentosum.]    Portentosum means strange or monstrous.    The pileus is three to five inches broad, fleshy, convex, then expanded,  subumbonate, viscid, sooty, often with purple tinge, frequently unequal  and turned up, streaked with dark lines, the thin margin naked, flesh  not compact, white, fragile, and mild.    The gills are white, very broad, rounded, almost free, distant, often  becoming pale-gray or yellowish.    The stem is three to six inches long, solid, quite fibrous, sometimes  equal, often tapering toward the base, white, stout, striate, villous at  base. The spores are subglobose, 4-5x4u.    The plants grow in pine woods and along the margins of mixed woods,  frequently by roadsides. It is usually found in October and November.  The plants in Figure 63 were found near Waltham, Mass., and were sent to  me by Mrs. E. B. Blackford. This is said to even excel T. personatum in  edible qualities.      _Clitocybe. Fr._    Clitocybe is from two Greek words, a hillside, or declivity, and a head;  so called from the central depression of the pileus.    The genus Clitocybe differs from Tricholoma in the character of the  gills. They are attached to the stem by the whole width and usually are  prolonged down the stem or decurrent. This is the first genus with  decurrent gills. The genus has neither a volva nor a ring and the spores  are white. The stem is elastic, spongy within, frequently hollow and  extremely fibrous, continuous with the pileus.    The pileus is generally fleshy, growing thin toward the margin, plane or  depressed or funnel-shaped, and with margin incurved. The universal  veil, if present at all, is seen only on the margin of the pileus like  frost or silky dew.    These plants usually grow on the ground and frequently in groups, though  a few may be found on decayed wood.    The Collybia, Mycena, and Omphalia have cartilaginous stems, while the  stem of the Clitocybe is extremely fibrous, and the Tricholoma is  distinguished by its notched gills.    This genus, because of the variations in its species, will always be  puzzling to the beginner, as it is to experts. We may easily decide it  is a Clitocybe because of the gills squarely meeting the stem, or  decurrent upon it, and its external fibrous stem, but to locate the  species is quite a different matter.      _Clitocybe media. Pk._    THE INTERMEDIATE CLITOCYBE. EDIBLE.    [Illustration: Figure 64.--Clitocybe media. One-half natural size.]    Media is from _medius_, middle; it is so called because it is  intermediate between C. nebularis and C. clavipes. It is not as  plentiful as either of the others in our woods.    The pileus is grayish-brown or blackish-brown, always darker than C.  nebularis. The flesh is white and farinaceous in taste.    The gills are rather broad, not crowded, adnate and decurrent, white,  with few transverse ridges or veins in the spaces between the gills.    The stem is one to two inches long, usually tapering upward, paler  than the pileus, rather elastic, smooth. The spores are plainly  elliptical, 8x5u.    This resembles very closely the two species mentioned above and is hard  to separate. I found the specimens in Figure 64 along Ralston's Run  where the ground is mossy and damp. Found in September and October.      _Clitocybe infundibuliformis. Schaeff._    THE FUNNEL-FORMED CLITOCYBE. EDIBLE.    [Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._    Plate IX. Figure 65.--Clitocybe infundibuliformis.]    Infundibuliformis means funnel-shaped. This is a beautiful plant and  very abundant in woods after a heavy rain. It grows upon the leaves and  especially among pine needles.    The pileus is at first convex and umbonate and as the plant advances in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29233"],[0,"The 2008 CIA World Factbook (#15)"],[1,"to policymakers.  Information is raw data from any source, data that may be fragmentary,  contradictory, unreliable, ambiguous, deceptive, or wrong. Intelligence  is information that has been collected, integrated, evaluated,  analyzed, and interpreted. Finished intelligence is the final product  of the Intelligence Cycle ready to be delivered to the policymaker.    The three types of finished intelligence are: basic, current, and  estimative. Basic intelligence provides the fundamental and factual  reference material on a country or issue. Current intelligence reports  on new developments. Estimative intelligence judges probable outcomes.  The three are mutually supportive: basic intelligence is the foundation  on which the other two are constructed; current intelligence  continually updates the inventory of knowledge; and estimative  intelligence revises overall interpretations of country and issue  prospects for guidance of basic and current intelligence. The World  Factbook , The President's Daily Brief , and the National Intelligence  Estimates are examples of the three types of finished intelligence.    The United States has carried on foreign intelligence activities since  the days of George Washington but only since World War II have they  been coordinated on a government-wide basis. Three programs have  highlighted the development of coordinated basic intelligence since  that time: (1 ) the Joint Army Navy Intelligence Studies (JANIS), (2 )  the National Intelligence Survey ( NIS ), and (3) The World Factbook .    During World War II, intelligence consumers realized that the  production of basic intelligence by different components of the US  Government resulted in a great duplication of effort and conflicting  information. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 brought home  to leaders in Congress and the executive branch the need for  integrating departmental reports to national policymakers. Detailed and  coordinated information was needed not only on such major powers as  Germany and Japan , but also on places of little previous interest. In  the Pacific Theater, for example, the Navy and Marines had to launch  amphibious operations against many islands about which information was  unconfirmed or nonexistent. Intelligence authorities resolved that the  United States should never again be caught unprepared.    In 1943, Gen. George B. Strong (G-2), Adm. H. C. Train (Office of Naval  Intelligence--ONI), and Gen. William J. Donovan (Director of the Office  of Strategic Services--OSS ) decided that a joint effort should be  initiated. A steering committee was appointed on 27 April 1943 that  recommended the formation of a Joint Intelligence Study Publishing  Board to assemble, edit, coordinate, and publish the Joint Army Navy  Intelligence Studies (JANIS). JANIS was the first interdepartmental  basic intelligence program to fulfill the needs of the US Government  for an authoritative and coordinated appraisal of strategic basic  intelligence. Between April 1943 and July 1947, the board published 34  JANIS studies. JANIS performed well in the war effort, and numerous  letters of commendation were received, including a statement from Adm.  Forrest Sherman, Chief of Staff, Pacific Ocean Areas, which said,  \"JANIS has become the indispensable reference work for the shore-based  planners.\"    The need for more comprehensive basic intelligence in the postwar world  was well expressed in 1946 by George S. Pettee, a noted author on  national security. He wrote in The Future of American Secret  Intelligence (Infantry Journal Press, 1946, page 46) that world  leadership in peace requires even more elaborate intelligence than in  war. \"The conduct of peace involves all countries, all human  activities--not just the enemy and his war production.\"    The Central Intelligence Agency was established on 26 July 1947 and  officially began operating on 18 September 1947. Effective 1 October  1947, the Director of Central Intelligence assumed operational  responsibility for JANIS. On 13 January 1948, the National Security  Council issued Intelligence Directive (NSCID) No. 3, which authorized  the National Intelligence Survey ( NIS ) program as a peacetime  replacement for the wartime JANIS program. Before adequate NIS country  sections could be produced, government agencies had to develop more  comprehensive gazetteers and better maps. The US Board on Geographic  Names (BGN) compiled the names; the Department of the Interior produced  the gazetteers; and CIA produced the maps.    The Hoover Commission's Clark Committee, set up in 1954 to study the  structure and administration of the CIA, reported to Congress in 1955  that: \"The National Intelligence Survey is an invaluable publication  which provides the essential elements of basic intelligence on all  areas of the world. There will always be a continuing requirement for  keeping the Survey up-to-date.\" The Factbook was created as an annual  summary and update to the encyclopedic NIS studies. The first  classified Factbook was published in August 1962, and the first  unclassified version was published in June 1971. The NIS program was  terminated in 1973 except for the Factbook , map, and gazetteer  components. The 1975 Factbook was the first to be made available to the  public with sales through the US Government Printing Office (GPO). The  Factbook was first made available on the Internet in June 1997. The  year 2008 marks the 61st anniversary of the establishment of the  Central Intelligence Agency and the 65th year of continuous basic  intelligence support to the US Government by The World Factbook and its  two predecessor programs.
