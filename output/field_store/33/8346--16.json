No. 111, the Shield of SCROPE, is--_Az.,  a bend or_. A celebrated contest for the right to bear this simple  Shield took place, A.D. 1385-1390, between Sir RICHARD LE SCROPE and Sir  ROBERT GROSVENOR, which was decided in favour of the former. No. 112,  for RADCLYFFE, is--_Arg., a bend engrailed sa._ Two uncharged Bends may  appear in one composition: thus, for LE BOTELER--_Arg., two bends az._,  No. 113; and for FRERE--_Gu., two bends or_ (both H. 3). The Diminutives  of the Bend are the _Bendlet_ and the _Cotise_, the one containing  one-half and the other one-fourth of its area. A Cotise is sometimes  borne singly, when it is a _Riband_. A bendlet _couped_ is a baton.  A Bend between two Cotises is _cotised_: thus, No. 114, for DE  BOHUN,--_Az., a Bend arg., cotised or, between six lioncels rampt.  gold_; this Shield is engraved from the Seal of HUMPHREY DE BOHUN,  fourth Earl of HEREFORD (A.D. 1298-1322); in it the cotised Bend is very  narrow, evidently to give more space for the lioncels. Charges displayed  on a Bend _slope with it_--that is, they would be erect, were the Bend  to be set vertically and to become a Pale: thus, another DE BOHUN, Sir  Gilbert (H. 3), distinguishes his Shield by tincturing his Bend _or_,  and charging upon it _three escallops gules_, as in No. 115. In No. 88,  the eaglets also exemplify the disposition of charges upon a Bend.  Charges set diagonally on the field of a Shield, in the position in  which a bend would occupy, are said to be \"_in bend_\" and are arranged  in the same manner: but it would be quite possible to have three or more  charges each disposed bendwise; but yet, nevertheless, when taken  together occupying the position of a fesse and therefore described also  as in fesse. This distinction between charges bendwise (or bendways) and  charges in bend should be carefully noted. A field divided into an  _even_ number of parts by lines drawn _bendwise_, is \"_bendy_,\" the  number of the divisions to be specified: as a matter of course, a field  thus \"bendy\" becomes a \"varied field,\" in which all the divisions lie in  the same plane: thus, No. 116, for DE MONTFORD (H. 3 and E. 2)--_Bendy  of ten or and az._ Bendlets are in relief, as in No. 117, for DE  BRAY--_Vairée, three Bendlets gu._ If a field be divided by lines drawn  bendwise, and also by others drawn either vertically or horizontally, it  is \"_paly bendy_,\" as No. 118, or \"_barry bendy_,\" as No. 119. These two  forms, which, however, are very rarely met with, should be carefully  distinguished from a field lozengy. A Bend issuing from the sinister  chief is a _Bend Sinister_.      [Illustration: No. 116.--De Montford.]      [Illustration: No. 117.--De Bray.]      [Illustration: No. 118.--Paly Bendy.]      [Illustration: No. 119.--Barry Bendy.]      [Illustration: No. 120.--St. Andrew.]      [Illustration: No. 122.--De Neville.]      [Illustration: No. 121.--De Neville.]    The SALTIRE (H. 3), a combination of a Bend with a Bend Sinister, may  also be regarded as a _Diagonal Cross_. Thus, the Crosses of St. ANDREW  of SCOTLAND, and of St. PATRICK of IRELAND are Saltires--the former, No.  120--_Az., a Saltire arg._: the latter--_Arg., a Saltire gu._ The arms  of the great family of NEVILLE reverse those of St. PATRICK, and  are--_Gu., a Saltire arg._, No. 121: so Drayton has recorded that      \"Upon his surcoat valiant NEVILLE bore    A silver Saltire upon martial red.\"      _Barons' War_, i. 22.    Charges set on a Saltire _slope with its limbs_ (all, however, pointing  to the chief), _the central charge being erect_; and the disposition of  charges set \"_in saltire_\" is the same: a single charge set on a Saltire  is blazoned erect on the central point of the Ordinary, as in No. 122,  another Shield of NEVILLE, in which the \"Silver Saltire\" is charged with  a _rose gules_. A Saltire may be borne with a Chief, as in No. 73.      [Illustration: No. 123.--De Stafford.]      [Illustration: No. 124.--Shield of De Clare.]    The CHEVRON (H. 3), in form and proportions is rather more than the  lower half of a Saltire. The Diminutive is a _Chevronel_, containing  half a Chevron, or perhaps less: thus, for DE STAFFORD (E. 2),--_Or,  a Chevron gu._, No. 123: for the great family of DE CLARE, from whom so  many other families derived their Chevrons and Chevronels--_Or, three  Chevronels gules_, No. 124 (H. 3). Two Chevrons may be borne in one  composition: or they may appear with a Fesse, as in No. 79: or with a  Chief, as (H. 3), for DE CROMBE--_Erm., a Chevron gu., and on a Chief of  the last three escallops or_; for ST. QUINTIN (H. 3)--_Or, three  Chevronels gu., a Chief vair_. A field _Chevronée_ is of rare  occurrence: the three Chevronels of DE CLARE, however, No. 124, appear  to have been derived from a field _Chevronée_: certainly, on his seal,  \"Strongbow\" has the Chevronée Shield, No. 125, about A.D. 1175. Charges  set on a Chevron, or disposed \"_in Chevron_,\" are always placed erect.      [Illustration: No. 125.--Early shield of De Clare.]      [Illustration: No. 126.--De Chandos.]      [Illustration: No. 127.--De Brian.]      [Illustration: No. 128.--De Bassett.]    The PILE (H. 3), resembling a wedge in form, is borne both single and in  small groups. Unless some other disposition on the field be specified,  this Ordinary issues from the chief of the Shield. Examples: _Or, a Pile  gu., between six and charged with three estoiles_ (or _mullets_)  _counter-changed_,--for ROBERT DE CHANDOS, No. 126: _Or, three Piles  az._, No. 127,--for Sir GUY DE BRIAN; _Or, three Piles gu., a canton  erm._, No. 128,--for DE BASSETT (all H. 3): and (E. 2), _Arg., a Pile  engrailed sa._--for Sir ROB. DE FORNEUS. In early emblazonments three  piles appear almost uniformly to be depicted with the points converging.  But a distinction is now made, and when the piles are intended to  converge, as in No. 128, they are termed \"_in point_.\"    The probable structural origin of these Ordinaries is sufficiently  apparent to render any further comment on that interesting circumstance  superfluous.          CHAPTER VII    THE GRAMMAR OF HERALDRY    SECTION IV      _The Subordinaries:-- The Canton or Quarter: The Inescutcheon: The    Orle: The Tressure: The Bordure: Flanches: The Lozenge, Mascle, and    Rustre: The Fusil: The Billet: The Gyron: The Frette-- The Roundles._      \"The second in a line of stars.\"      --IDYLLS OF THE KING.      THE SUBORDINARIES. This title has been assigned, but without any  decisive authority, to another group of devices, second in rank to the  Ordinaries. Very few writers agree as to which are ordinaries and which  subordinaries; nor does there seem any reason why any distinction  between them should exist. Nor, indeed, save that all are exclusively  heraldic, why some of them should be regarded as anything more than  ordinary charges. These Subordinaries are the _Canton_, the _Quarter_,  the _Inescutcheon_, the _Orle_, the _Tressure_, the _Bordure_,  _Flanches_, the _Lozenge_, _Mascle_ and _Rustre_, the _Fusil_, the  _Billet_, the _Gyron_, and the _Frette_. The Canton, by the early  Heralds commonly styled the \"Quarter,\" sometimes has been grouped with  the Ordinaries. And it must here be observed that the Lozenge, Fusil,  Billet, Gyron, and Frette were not used as single charges by the early  Heralds; but by them the fields of Shields were divided _lozengy_ and  _gyronny_, or they were _semée of Billets_, or covered over with  _Frette_-work, from which the single charges evidently were afterwards  obtained.    The CANTON (H. 3), sometimes blazoned as a QUARTER, cut off by two  lines, the one drawn in pale and the other bar-wise, or in fesse, is  either the first quarter of the field of a Shield, or about  three-fourths of that quarter, but smaller if not charged. The confusion  between the canton and the quarter is due to the fact that ancient arms  in which the charge is now, and has been for centuries past, stereotyped  as a canton and drawn to occupy one-ninth of the Shield, were uniformly  drawn and blazoned in early times with the charge as a quarter. But  there is a marked distinction now made between the canton and the  quarter. A _Canton ermine_ is of frequent occurrence, as in No. 128; but  it is generally borne charged, and it always overlies the charges of the  field of the Shield, as No. 129, for DE KYRKEBY (R. 2)--_Arg., two bars  gu.; on a canton of the last a cross moline or_; and, for BLUNDELL  (H. 3)--_Az., billettée, on a canton or a raven ppr._, No. 130.      [Illustration: No. 129.--De Kyrkeby.]      [Illustration: No. 130.--Blundell.]    The INESCUTCHEON (H. 3) is a Shield borne as a charge, and superimposed  upon another Shield larger than itself. When one Inescutcheon is borne,  it is usually placed on the fesse-point; but several Inescutcheons may  appear in one composition. The well-known Shield of the MORTIMERS  supplies a good example, No. 131 (H. 3)--_Barry of six or and az., an  inescutcheon arg.; on a chief gold, gyroned of the second, two pallets  of the same_: for DARCY--_Arg., an inescutcheon sa., within an orle of  roses gu._, No. 132 (E. 2): _Arg., three inescutcheons gu._, for DE  WYLLERS (E. 2), No. 133. This is also the well-known Scottish coat of  Hay.      [Illustration: No. 132.--Darcy.]      [Illustration: No. 131.--De Mortimer.]      [Illustration: No. 133.--De Wyllers.]    The ORLE (H. 3), blazoned by early Heralds as a \"_false escutcheon_\"  (\"_faux escocheon_\"), or as an \"_inescutcheon voided_,\" is the border of  a Shield or Escutcheon--a Shield, that is, voided of the central area of  its field, and, like an Inescutcheon, charged on a Shield. The arms of  BALLIOL, No. 134, are--_Gu., an Orle arg._ (H. 3). These arms are  blazoned on many Scottish Seals of the greatest interest, and on the  Seals of Balliol College, Oxford. Small charges are frequently "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2323"],[0,"Recollections and Letters of General Robert E. Lee (#15)"],[1,"Louis looked wretched himself. I am sorry he is in  such bad company, but I suppose he could not help it.\"    As one of the Army of Northern Virginia, I occasionally saw the  commander-in-chief, on the march, or passed the headquarters close  enough to recognise him and members of his staff, but as a private  soldier in Jackson's corps did not have much time, during that campaign,  for visiting, and until the battle of Sharpsburg I had no opportunity of  speaking to him. On that occasion our battery had been severely handled,  losing many men and horses. Having three guns disabled, we were ordered  to withdraw, and while moving back we passed General Lee and several of  his staff, grouped on a little knoll near the road. Having no definite  orders where to go, our captain, seeing the commanding general, halted  us and rode over to get some instructions. Some others and myself went  along to see and hear. General Lee was dismounted with some of his staff  around him, a courier holding his horse. Captain Poague, commanding our  battery, the Rockbridge Artillery, saluted, reported our condition,  and asked for instructions. The General, listening patiently looked at  us--his eyes passing over me without any sign of recognition--and then  ordered Captain Poague to take the most serviceable horses and men, man  the uninjured gun, send the disabled part of his command back to refit,  and report to the front for duty. As Poague turned to go, I went up to  speak to my father. When he found out who I was, he congratulated me on  being well and unhurt. I then said:    \"General, are you going to send us in again?\"    \"Yes, my son,\" he replied, with a smile; \"you all must do what you can  to help drive these people back.\"    This meeting between General Lee and his son has been told very often  and in many different ways, but the above is what I remember of the  circumstances.    He was much on foot during this part of the campaign, and moved about  either in an ambulance or on horseback, with a courier leading his  horse. The accident which temporarily disabled him happened before he  left Virginia. He had dismounted, and was sitting on a fallen log, with  the bridle reins hung over his arm. Traveller, becoming frightened at  something, suddenly dashed away, threw him violently to the ground,  spraining both hands and breaking a small bone in one of them. A letter  written some weeks afterward to my mother alludes to this meeting with  his son, and to the condition of his hands:    \"...I have not laid eyes on Rob since I saw him in the battle of  Sharpsburg--going in with a single gun of his for the second time,  after his company had been withdrawn in consequence of three of its guns  having been disabled. Custis has seen him and says he is very well, and  apparently happy and content. My hands are improving slowly, and, with  my left hand, I am able to dress and undress myself, which is a great  comfort. My right is becoming of some assistance, too, thought it is  still swollen and sometimes painful. The bandages have been removed. I  am now able to sign my name. It has been six weeks to-day since I was  injured, and I have at last discarded the sling.\"    After the army recrossed the Potomac into Virginia, we were camped for  some time in the vicinity of Winchester. One beautiful afternoon in  October, a courier from headquarters rode up to our camp, found me  out, and handed me a note from my father. It told me of the death of my  sister Annie. As I have lost this letter to me, I quote from one to my  mother about the same time. It was dated October 26, 1862:    \"...I cannot express the anguish I feel at the death of our sweet Annie.  To know that I shall never see her again on earth, that her place in  our circle, which I always hoped one day to enjoy, is forever vacant, is  agonising in the extreme. But God in this, as in all things, has mingled  mercy with the blow, in selecting that one best prepared to leave us.  May you be able to join me in saying 'His will be done!' ...I know how  much you will grieve and how much she will be mourned. I wish I could  give you any comfort, but beyond our hope in the great mercy of God, and  the belief that he takes her at the time and place when it is best for  her to go, there is none. May that same mercy be extended to us all, and  may we be prepared for His summons.\"    In a letter to my sister Mary, one month later, from \"Camp near  Fredericksburg\":    \"...The death of my dear Annie was, indeed, to me a bitter pang, but  'the Lord gave and the Lord has taken away: blessed be the name of the  Lord.' In the quiet hours of the night, when there is nothing to lighten  the full weight of my grief, I feel as if I should be overwhelmed. I  have always counted, if God should spare me a few days after this Civil  War has ended, that I should have her with me, but year after year my  hopes go out, and I must be resigned....\"    To this daughter whose loss grieved him so he was specially devoted.  She died in North Carolina, at the Warren White Sulphur Springs. At the  close of the war, the citizens of the county erected over her grave  a handsome monument. General lee was invited to be present at the  ceremonies of the unveiling. In his reply, he says:    \"...I have always cherished the intention of visiting the tomb of her  who never gave me aught but pleasure;... Though absent in person, my  heart will be with you, and my sorrow and devotions will be mingled  with yours.... I inclose, according to your request, the date of my  daughter's birth and the inscription proposed for the monument over her  tomb. The latter are the last lines of the hymn which she asked for just  before her death.\"    A visitor to her grave, some years after the war, thus describes it:    \"In the beautiful and quiet graveyard near the Springs a plain shaft of  native granite marks the grave of this beloved daughter. On one side is  cut in the stone, 'Annie C. Lee, daughter of General R. E. Lee and Mary  C. Lee'--and on the opposite--'Born at Arlington, June 18, 1839, and  died at White Sulphur Springs, Warren County, North Carolina, Oct. 20,  1862.' On another side are the lines selected by her father,         \"'Perfect and true are all His ways       Whom heaven adores and earth obeys.'\"    That autumn I was offered the position of Lt. and A. D. C. on the staff  of my brother, W. H. F. Lee, just promoted from the colonelcy of the  9th Virginia Cavalry to the command of a brigade in the same arm of the  service. My father had told me when I joined the army to do my whole  duty faithfully, not to be rash about volunteering for any service out  of my regular line, and always to accept promotion. After consulting  him, it was decided that I should take the position offered, and  he presented me with a horse and one of his swords. My promotion  necessitated my having an honourable discharge as a private, from the  ranks, and this I obtained in the proper way from General \"Stonewall\"  Jackson, commanding the corps of which my company was a part, and was  thus introduced for the first time to that remarkable man. Having served  in his command since my enlistment, I had been seeing him daily. \"Old  Jack,\" at a distance, was as familiar to me as one of the battery guns,  but I had never met him, and felt much awe at being ushered into his  presence. This feeling, however, was groundless, for he was seemingly  so much embarrassed by the interview that I really felt sorry for him  before he dismissed me with my discharge papers, properly made out and  signed.    I had received a letter from my father telling me to come to him as soon  as I had gotten my discharge from my company, so I proceeded at once  to his headquarters, which were situated near Orange Court House, on a  wooded hill just east of the village. I found there the horse which he  gave me. She was a daughter of his mare, \"Grace Darling,\" and, though  not so handsome as her mother, she inherited many of her good qualities  and carried me well until the end of the war and for thirteen years  afterward. She was four years old, a solid bay, and never failed me a  single day during three years' hard work. The General was on the point  of moving his headquarters down to Fredericksburg, some of the army  having already gone forward to that city. I think the camp was struck  the day after I arrived, and as the General's hands were not yet  entirely well, he allowed me, as a great favour, to ride his horse  \"Traveller.\" Amongst the soldiers this horse was as well known as was  his master. He was a handsome iron-gray with black points--mane and tail  very dark--sixteen hands high, and five years old. He was born near the  White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, and attracted the notice of my  father when he was in that part of the State in 1861. He was never  known to tire, and, though quiet and sensible in general and afraid  of nothing, yet if not regularly exercised, he fretted a good deal  especially in a crowd of horses. But there can be no better description  of this famous horse than the one given by his master. It was dictated  to his daughter Agnes at Lexington, Virginia, after the war, in response  to some artist who had asked for a description, and was corrected in his  own handwriting:    \"If I were an artist like you I would draw a true picture of  Traveller--representing his fine proportions, muscular figure, deep  chest and short back, strong haunches, flat legs, small head, broad  forehead, delicate ears, quick eye, small feet, and black mane and tail.  Such a picture would inspire a poet, whose genius could then depict his  worth and describe his endurance of toil, hunger, thirst, heat, cold,  and the dangers and sufferings through which he passed. He could dilate  upon his sagacity and affection, and his invariable response to every  wish of his rider. He might even imagine his thoughts, through the long  night marches and days of battle"]]]
