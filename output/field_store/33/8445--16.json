The Golden Dog is--\"    \"Damn the Golden Dog!\" exclaimed Bigot, passionately. \"Why do you utter  his name, Varin, to sour our wine? I hope one day to pull down the Dog,  as well as the whole kennel of the insolent Bourgeois.\" Then, as was his  wont, concealing his feelings under a mocking gibe, \"Varin,\" said he,  \"they say that it is your marrow bone the Golden Dog is gnawing--ha! ha!  ha!\"    \"More people believe it is your Excellency's!\" Varin knew he was right,  but aware of Bigot's touchiness on that point, added, as is the wont of  panders to great men, \"It is either yours or the Cardinal's.\"    \"Let it be the Cardinal's, then! He is still in purgatory, and there  will wait the arrival of the Bourgeois, to balance accounts with him.\"    Bigot hated the Bourgeois Philibert as one hates the man he has injured.  Bigot had been instrumental in his banishment years ago from France,  when the bold Norman count defended the persecuted Jansenists in the  Parliament of Rouen. The Intendant hated him now for his wealth and  prosperity in New France. But his wrath turned to fury when he saw the  tablet of the Golden Dog, with its taunting inscription, glaring upon  the front of the magazine in the Rue Buade. Bigot felt the full meaning  and significance of the words that burned into his soul, and for which  he hoped one day to be revenged.    \"Confusion to the whole litter of the Golden Dog, and that is the party  of the Honnetes Gens!\" cried he. \"But for that canting savant who plays  the Governor here, I would pull down the sign and hang its master up in  its stead to-morrow!\"    The company now grew still more hilarious and noisy in their cups. Few  paid attention to what the Intendant was saying. But De Repentigny heard  him utter the words, \"Oh, for men who dare do men's deeds!\" He caught  the eye of De Repentigny, and added, \"But we are all cowards in the  Grand Company, and are afraid of the Bourgeois.\"    The wine was bubbling in the brain of Le Gardeur. He scarcely knew what  the Intendant said, but he caught the last words.    \"Whom do you call cowards, Chevalier? I have joined the Grand Company.  If the rest are cowards, I am not: I stand ready to pluck the peruke off  the head of any man in New France, and carry it on my sword to the Place  d' Armes, where I will challenge all the world to come and take it!\"    \"Pish! that is nothing! give me man's work. I want to see the partner in  the Grand Company who dare pull down the Golden Dog.\"    \"I dare! and I dare!\" exclaimed a dozen voices at once in response to  the appeal of the Intendant, who craftily meant his challenge to ensnare  only Le Gardeur.    \"And I dare; and I will, too, if you wish it, Chevalier!\" shouted Le  Gardeur, mad with wine, and quite oblivious of the thousand claims of  the father of his friend, Pierre Philibert, upon him.    \"I take you at your word, Le Gardeur! and bind your honor to it in the  presence of all these gentlemen,\" said Bigot with a look of intense  satisfaction.    \"When shall it be done--to-day?\" Le Gardeur seemed ready to pluck the  moon from the sky in his present state of ecstasy.    \"Why, no, not to-day; not before the pear is ripe will we pluck it! Your  word of honor will keep till then?\"    Bigot was in great glee over the success of his stratagem to entrap De  Repentigny.    \"It will keep a thousand years!\" replied Le Gardeur, amid a fresh  outburst of merriment round the board which culminated in a shameless  song, fit only for a revel of satyrs.    The Sieur Cadet lolled lazily in his chair, his eyes blinking with a  sleepy leer. \"We are getting stupidly drunk. Bigot,\" said he; \"we want  something new to rouse us all to fresh life. Will you let me offer a  toast?\"    \"Go on, Cadet! offer what toast you please. There is nothing in heaven,  hell, or upon earth that I won't drink to for your sake.\"    \"I want you to drink it on your knees, Bigot! pledge me that, and fill  your biggest cup.\"    \"We will drink it on all fours if you like! come, out with your toast,  Cadet; you are as long over it as Father Glapion's sermon in Lent! and  it will be as interesting, I dare say!\"    \"Well, Chevalier, the Grand Company, after toasting all the beauties of  Quebec, desire to drink the health of the fair mistress of Beaumanoir,  and in her presence too!\" said Cadet with owlish gravity.    Bigot started; drunk and reckless as he was, he did not like his secret  to be divulged. He was angry with Cadet for referring to it in the  presence of so many who knew not that a strange lady was residing at  Beaumanoir. He was too thoroughly a libertine of the period to feel any  moral compunction for any excess he committed. He was habitually more  ready to glory over his conquests, than to deny or extenuate them. But  in this case he had, to the surprise of Cadet, been very reticent, and  shy of speaking of this lady even to him.    \"They say she is a miracle of beauty, Bigot!\" continued Cadet, \"and that  you are so jealous of the charms of your belle Gabrielle that you are  afraid to show her to your best friends.\"    \"My belle Gabrielle is at liberty to go where she pleases, Cadet!\" Bigot  saw the absurdity of anger, but he felt it, nevertheless. \"She chooses  not to leave her bower, to look even on you, Cadet! I warrant you she  has not slept all night, listening to your infernal din.\"    \"Then, I hope you will allow us to go and beg pardon on our knees for  disturbing her rest. What say the good company?\"    \"Agreed, agreed!\" was the general response, and all pressed the  Intendant vociferously to allow them to see the fair mistress of  Beaumanoir.    Varin, however, proposed that she should be brought into the hall. \"Send  her to us, O King,\" cried he; \"we are nobles of Persia, and this is  Shushan the palace, where we carouse according to the law of the Medes,  seven days at a stretch. Let the King bring in Queen Vashti, to show her  beauty to the princes and nobles of his court!\"    Bigot, too full of wine to weigh scruples, yielded to the wish of his  boon companions. He rose from his chair, which in his absence was taken  by Cadet. \"Mind!\" said he, \"if I bring her in, you shall show her every  respect.\"    \"We will kiss the dust of her feet,\" answered Cadet, \"and consider you  the greatest king of a feast in New France or Old.\"    Bigot, without further parley, passed out of the hall, traversed a long  corridor and entered an anteroom, where he found Dame Tremblay, the old  housekeeper, dozing on her chair. He roused her up, and bade her go to  the inner chamber to summon her mistress.    The housekeeper rose in a moment at the voice of the Intendant. She was  a comely dame, with a ruddy cheek, and an eye in her head that looked  inquisitively at her master as she arranged her cap and threw back her  rather gay ribbons.    \"I want your mistress up in the great hall! Go summon her at once,\"  repeated the Intendant.    The housekeeper courtesied, but pressed her lips together as if to  prevent them from speaking in remonstrance. She went at once on her  ungracious errand.        CHAPTER VIII. CAROLINE DE ST. CASTIN.      Dame Tremblay entered the suite of apartments and returned in a few  moments, saying that her lady was not there, but had gone down to the  secret chamber, to be, she supposed, more out of hearing of the noise,  which had disturbed her so much.    \"I will go find her then,\" replied the Intendant; \"you may return to  your own room, dame.\"    He walked across the drawing-room to one of the gorgeous panels that  decorated the wall, and touched a hidden spring. A door flew open,  disclosing a stair heavily carpeted that led down to the huge vaulted  foundations of the Chateau.    He descended the stair with hasty though unsteady steps. It led to a  spacious room, lighted with a gorgeous lamp that hung pendant in silver  chains from the frescoed ceiling. The walls were richly tapestried with  products of the looms of the Gobelins, representing the plains of  Italy filled with sunshine, where groves, temples, and colonnades were  pictured in endless vistas of beauty. The furniture of the chamber was  of regal magnificence. Nothing that luxury could desire, or art furnish,  had been spared in its adornment. On a sofa lay a guitar, and beside it  a scarf and a dainty glove fit for the hand of the fairy queen.    The Intendant looked eagerly round, as he entered this bright chamber of  his fancy, but saw not its expected occupant. A recess in the deep wall  at the farthest side of the room contained an oratory with an altar and  a crucifix upon it. The recess was partly in the shade. But the eyes  of the Intendant discerned clearly enough the kneeling, or rather the  prostrate, figure of Caroline de St. Castin. Her hands were clasped  beneath her head, which was bowed to the ground. Her long, black hair  lay dishevelled over her back, as she lay in her white robe like the  Angel of Sorrow, weeping and crying from the depths of her broken heart,  \"Lamb of God, that taketh away the sins of the world, have mercy upon  me!\" She was so absorbed in her grief that she did not notice the  entrance of the Intendant.    Bigot stood still for a moment, stricken with awe at the spectacle of  this lovely woman weeping by herself in the secret chamber. A look of  something like pity stole into his eyes; he called her by name, ran to  her, assisted her to rise, which she did, slowly turning towards him  that weeping, Madonna-like face which haunts the ruins of Beaumanoir to  this day.    She was of medium stature, slender and lissome, looking taller than she  really was. Her features were chiselled with exquisite delicacy; her  hair of a raven blackness, and eyes of that dark lustre which reappears  for generations in the descendants of Europeans who have mingled their  blood with that of the aborigines of the forest.

A sudden squeal of unreasonable  anger rose amidst the bushes, the squeal of some creature bitterly  wronged. And crashing after them appeared a big, grey-blue shape. It was  Yaaa the big-horned rhinoceros, in one of those fits of fury of his,  charging full tilt, after the manner of his kind. He had been startled  at his feeding, and someone, it did not matter who, was to be ripped and  trampled therefore. He was bearing down on them from the left, with his  wicked little eye red, his great horn down and his tail like a  jury-mast behind him. For a minute Ugh-lomi was minded to slip off and  dodge, and then behold! the staccato of the hoofs grew swifter, and the  rhinoceros and his stumpy hurrying little legs seemed to slide out at  the back corner of Ugh-lomi's eye. In two minutes they were through the  bushes of May, and out in the open, going fast. For a space he could  hear the ponderous paces in pursuit receding behind him, and then it was  just as if Yaaa had not lost his temper, as if Yaaa had never existed.    The pace never faltered, on they rode and on.    Ugh-lomi was now all exultation. To exult in those days was to insult.  \"Ya-ha! big nose!\" he said, trying to crane back and see some remote  speck of a pursuer. \"Why don't you carry your smiting-stone in your  fist?\" he ended with a frantic whoop.    But that whoop was unfortunate, for coming close to the ear of the  horse, and being quite unexpected, it startled the stallion extremely.  He shied violently. Ugh-lomi suddenly found himself uncomfortable again.  He was hanging on to the horse, he found, by one arm and one knee.    The rest of the ride was honourable but unpleasant. The view was  chiefly of blue sky, and that was combined with the most unpleasant  physical sensations. Finally, a bush of thorn lashed him and he let go.    He hit the ground with his cheek and shoulder, and then, after a  complicated and extraordinarily rapid movement, hit it again with the  end of his backbone. He saw splashes and sparks of light and colour. The  ground seemed bouncing about just like the horse had done. Then he found  he was sitting on turf, six yards beyond the bush. In front of him was a  space of grass, growing greener and greener, and a number of human  beings in the distance, and the horse was going round at a smart gallop  quite a long way off to the right.    The human beings were on the opposite side of the river, some still in  the water, but they were all running away as hard as they could go. The  advent of a monster that took to pieces was not the sort of novelty they  cared for. For quite a minute Ugh-lomi sat regarding them in a purely  spectacular spirit. The bend of the river, the knoll among the reeds and  royal ferns, the thin streams of smoke going up to Heaven, were all  perfectly familiar to him. It was the squatting-place of the Sons of  Uya, of Uya from whom he had fled with Eudena, and whom he had waylaid  in the chestnut woods and killed with the First Axe.    He rose to his feet, still dazed from his fall, and as he did so the  scattering fugitives turned and regarded him. Some pointed to the  receding horse and chattered. He walked slowly towards them, staring. He  forgot the horse, he forgot his own bruises, in the growing interest of  this encounter. There were fewer of them than there had been--he  supposed the others must have hid--the heap of fern for the night fire  was not so high. By the flint heaps should have sat Wau--but then he  remembered he had killed Wau. Suddenly brought back to this familiar  scene, the gorge and the bears and Eudena seemed things remote, things  dreamt of.    He stopped at the bank and stood regarding the tribe. His mathematical  abilities were of the slightest, but it was certain there were fewer.  The men might be away, but there were fewer women and children. He gave  the shout of home-coming. His quarrel had been with Uya and Wau--not  with the others. \"Children of Uya!\" he cried. They answered with his  name, a little fearfully because of the strange way he had come.    For a space they spoke together. Then an old woman lifted a shrill  voice and answered him. \"Our Lord is a Lion.\"    Ugh-lomi did not understand that saying. They answered him again several  together, \"Uya comes again. He comes as a Lion. Our Lord is a Lion. He  comes at night. He slays whom he will. But none other may slay us,  Ugh-lomi, none other may slay us.\"    Still Ugh-lomi did not understand.    \"Our Lord is a Lion. He speaks no more to men.\"    Ugh-lomi stood regarding them. He had had dreams--he knew that though he  had killed Uya, Uya still existed. And now they told him Uya was a Lion.    The shrivelled old woman, the mistress of the fire-minders, suddenly  turned and spoke softly to those next to her. She was a very old woman  indeed, she had been the first of Uya's wives, and he had let her live  beyond the age to which it is seemly a woman should be permitted to  live. She had been cunning from the first, cunning to please Uya and to  get food. And now she was great in counsel. She spoke softly, and  Ugh-lomi watched her shrivelled form across the river with a curious  distaste. Then she called aloud, \"Come over to us, Ugh-lomi.\"    A girl suddenly lifted up her voice. \"Come over to us, Ugh-lomi,\" she  said. And they all began crying, \"Come over to us, Ugh-lomi.\"    It was strange how their manner changed after the old woman called.    He stood quite still watching them all. It was pleasant to be called,  and the girl who had called first was a pretty one. But she made him  think of Eudena.    \"Come over to us, Ugh-lomi,\" they cried, and the voice of the shrivelled  old woman rose above them all. At the sound of her voice his hesitation  returned.    He stood on the river bank, Ugh-lomi--Ugh the Thinker--with his thoughts  slowly taking shape. Presently one and then another paused to see what  he would do. He was minded to go back, he was minded not to. Suddenly  his fear or his caution got the upper hand. Without answering them he  turned, and walked back towards the distant thorn-trees, the way he had  come. Forthwith the whole tribe started crying to him again very  eagerly. He hesitated and turned, then he went on, then he turned again,  and then once again, regarding them with troubled eyes as they called.  The last time he took two paces back, before his fear stopped him. They  saw him stop once more, and suddenly shake his head and vanish among  the hawthorn-trees.    Then all the women and children lifted up their voices together, and  called to him in one last vain effort.    Far down the river the reeds were stirring in the breeze, where,  convenient for his new sort of feeding, the old lion, who had taken to  man-eating, had made his lair.    The old woman turned her face that way, and pointed to the hawthorn  thickets. \"Uya,\" she screamed, \"there goes thine enemy! There goes thine  enemy, Uya! Why do you devour us nightly? We have tried to snare him!  There goes thine enemy, Uya!\"    But the lion who preyed upon the tribe was taking his siesta. The cry  went unheard. That day he had dined on one of the plumper girls, and his  mood was a comfortable placidity. He really did not understand that he  was Uya or that Ugh-lomi was his enemy.    So it was that Ugh-lomi rode the horse, and heard first of Uya the lion,  who had taken the place of Uya the Master, and was eating up the tribe.  And as he hurried back to the gorge his mind was no longer full of the  horse, but of the thought that Uya was still alive, to slay or be slain.  Over and over again he saw the shrunken band of women and children  crying that Uya was a lion. Uya was a lion!    And presently, fearing the twilight might come upon him, Ugh-lomi began  running.      IV--UYA THE LION    The old lion was in luck. The tribe had a certain pride in their ruler,  but that was all the satisfaction they got out of it. He came the very  night that Ugh-lomi killed Uya the Cunning, and so it was they named him  Uya. It was the old woman, the fire-minder, who first named him Uya. A  shower had lowered the fires to a glow, and made the night dark. And as  they conversed together, and peered at one another in the darkness, and  wondered fearfully what Uya would do to them in their dreams now that he  was dead, they heard the mounting reverberations of the lion's roar  close at hand. Then everything was still.    They held their breath, so that almost the only sounds were the patter  of the rain and the hiss of the raindrops in the ashes. And then, after  an interminable time, a crash, and a shriek of fear, and a growling.  They sprang to their feet, shouting, screaming, running this way and  that, but brands would not burn, and in a minute the victim was being  dragged away through the ferns. It was Irk, the brother of Wau.    So the lion came.    The ferns were still wet from the rain the next night, and he came and  took Click with the red hair. That sufficed for two nights. And then in  the dark between the moons he came three nights, night after night, and  that though they had good fires. He was an old lion with stumpy teeth,  but very silent and very cool; he knew of fires before; these were not  the first of mankind that had ministered to his old age. The third night  he came between the outer fire and the inner, and he leapt the flint  heap, and pulled down Irm the son of Irk, who had seemed like to be the  leader. That was a dreadful night, because they lit great flares of fern  and ran screaming, and the lion missed his hold of Irm. By the glare of  the fire they saw Irm struggle up, and run a little way towards them,  and then the lion in two bounds had him down again. That was the last of  Irm.    So fear came, and all the delight of spring passed out of their lives.  Already there were five gone out of the tribe, and four nights added  three more to the number. Food-seeking became spiritless, none knew who  might go next,"]]]
