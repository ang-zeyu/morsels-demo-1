Several minutes later, when the storm had subsided, the woeful crowd  enthusiastically urged Hopalong to the bar, where he \"bought.\"    \"Of all th' ornery outfits I ever saw--\" began the man at the table,  grinning from ear to ear at the spectacle he had just witnessed.    \"Why, hullo, Frenchy! Glad to see yu, yu old son-of-a-gun! What's th'  news from th' Hills?\" Shouted Hopalong.    \"Rather locoed, an' there's a locoed gang that's headin' that way. Goin'  up?\" he asked.    \"Shore, after round-up. Seen any punchers trailin' around loose?\"    \"Ya-as,\" drawled Frenchy, delving into the possibilities suddenly opened  to him and determining to utilize to the fullest extent the opportunity  that had come to him unsought. \"There's nine over to Muddy Wells that yu  might git if yu wants them bad enough. They've got a sombrero of mine,\"  he added deprecatingly.    \"Nine! Twisted Jerusalem, Buck! Nine whole cow-punchers a-pinin' for  work,\" he shouted, but then added thoughtfully, \"Mebby they's engaged,\"  it being one of the courtesies of the land not to take another man's  help.    \"Nope. They've stampeded for th' Hills an' left their boss all alone,\"  replied Frenchy, well knowing that such desertion would not, in the  minds of the Bar-20 men, add any merits to the case of the distant  outfit.    \"Th' sons-of-guns,\" said Hopalong, \"let's go an' get 'em,\" he suggested,  turning to Buck, who nodded a smiling assent.    \"Oh, what's the hurry?\" Asked Frenchy, seeing his projected game  slipping away into the uncertain future and happy in the thought that he  would be avenged on the O-Bar-O outfit.    \"They'll be there till to-morrow noon--they's waitin' for their cookie,  who's goin' with them.\"    \"A cook! A cook! Oh, joy, a cook!\" exulted Johnny, not for one instant  doubting Buck's ability to capture the whole outfit and seeing a whirl  of excitement in the effort.    \"Anybody we knows?\" Inquired Skinny Thompson.    \"Shore. Tenspot Davis, Waffles, Salvation Carroll, Bigfoot Baker,  Charley Lane, Lefty Allen, Kid Morris, Curley Tate an' Tex Le Blanc,\"  responded Frenchy.    \"Umm-m. Might as well rope a blizzard,\" grumbled Billy. \"Might as well  try to git th' Seventh Cavalry. We'll have a pious time corralling that  bunch. Them's th' fellows that hit that bunch of inquirin' Crow braves  that time up in th' Bad Lands an' then said by-bye to th' Ninth.\"    \"Aw, shut up! They's only two that's very much, an' Buck an' Hopalong  can sing 'em to sleep,\" interposed Johnny, afraid that the expedition  would fall through.    \"How about Curley and Tex?\" Pugnaciously asked Billy.    \"Huh, jest because they buffaloed yu over to Las Vegas yu needn't think  they's dangerous. Salvation an' Tenspot are only ones who can shoot,\"  stoutly maintained Johnny.    \"Here yu, get mum,\" ordered Buck to the pair. \"When this outfit goes  after anything it generally gets it. All in favor of kidnappin' that  outfit signify di' same by kickin' Billy,\" whereupon Bill swore.    \"Do yu want yore hat?\" Asked Buck, turning to Frenchy.    \"I shore do,\" answered that individual.    \"If yu helps us at th' round-up we'll get it for yu. Fifty a month an'  grub,\" offered the foreman.    \"O.K.\" replied Frenchy, anxious to even matters.    Buck looked at his watch. \"Seven o'clock--we ought to get there by five  if we relays at th' Barred-Horseshoe. Come on.\"    \"How are we goin' to git them?\" Asked Billy.    \"Yu leave that to me, son. Hopalong an' Frenchy'll tend to that part of  it,\" replied Buck, making for his horse and swinging into the saddle, an  example which was followed by the others, including Frenchy.    As they swung off Buck noticed the condition of Frenchy's mount and  halted. \"Yu take that cayuse back an' get Cowan's,\" he ordered.    \"That cayuse is good for Cheyenne--she eats work, an' besides I wants my  own,\" laughed Frenchy.    \"Yu must had a reg'lar picnic from th' looks of that crease,\"  volunteered Hopalong, whose curiosity was mastering him. \"Shoo! I had  a little argument with some feather dusters--th' O-Bar-O crowd cleaned  them up.\"    \"That so?\" Asked Buck.    \"Yep! They sorter got into th' habit of chasin' me to Las Cruces an'  forgot to stop.\"    \"How many'd yu get?\" Asked Lanky Smith.    \"Twelve. Two got away. I got two before th' crowd showed up--that makes  fo'teen.\"    \"Now th' cavalry'll be huntin' yu,\" croaked Billy.    \"Hunt nothin'! They was in war-paint-think I was a target?--Think I was  goin' to call off their shots for 'em?\"    They relayed at the Barred-Horseshoe and went on their way at the same  pace. Shortly after leaving the last-named ranch Buck turned to Frenchy  and asked, \"Any of that outfit think they can play poker?\"    \"Shore. Waffles.\"    \"Does th' reverend Mr. Waffles think so very hard?\"    \"He shore does.\"    \"Do th' rest of them mavericks think so too?\"    \"They'd bet their shirts on him.\"    At this juncture all were startled by a sudden eruption from Billy.  \"Haw! Haw! Haw!\" he roared as the drift of Buck's intentions struck him.  \"Haw! Haw! Haw!\"    \"Here, yu long-winded coyote,\" yelled Red, banging him over the head  with his quirt, \"If yu don't 'Haw! Haw!' away from my ear I'll make it  a Wow! Wow! What d'yu mean? Think I am a echo cliff? Yu slabsided  doodle-bug, yu!\"    \"G'way, yu crimson topknot, think my head's a hunk of quartz? Fer a  plugged peso I'd strew yu all over th' scenery!\" shouted Billy, feigning  anger and rubbing his head.    \"There ain't no scenery around here,\" interposed Lanky. \"This here  be-utiful prospect is a sublime conception of th' devil.\"    \"Easy, boy! Them highfalutin' words'il give yu a cramp some day. Yu talk  like a newly-made sergeant,\" remarked Skinny.    \"He learned them words from the sky-pilot over at El Paso,\" volunteered  Hopalong, winking at Red. \"He used to amble down th' aisle afore the  lights was lit so's he could get a front seat. That was all hunky for  a while, but every time he'd go out to irrigate, that female  organ-wrastler would seem to call th' music off for his special benefit.  So in a month he'd sneak in an' freeze to a chair by th' door, an' after  a while he'd shy like blazes every time he got within eye range of th'  church.\"    \"Shore. But do yu know what made him get religion all of a sudden? He  used to hang around on di' outside after th' joint let out an' trail  along behind di' music-slinger, lookin' like he didn't know what to do  with his hands. Then when he got woozy one time she up an' told him that  she had got a nice long letter from her hubby. Then Mr. Lanky hit th'  trail for Santa Fe so hard that there wasn't hardly none of it left. I  didn't see him for a whole month,\" supplied Red innocently.    \"Yore shore funny, ain't yu?\" sarcastically grunted Lanky. \"Why, I can  tell things on yu that'd make yu stand treat for a year.\"    \"I wouldn't sneak off to Santa Fe an' cheat yu out of them. Yu ought to  be ashamed of yoreself.\"    \"Yah!\" snorted the aggrieved little man. \"I had business over to Santa  Fe!\"    \"Shore,\" endorsed Hopalong. \"We've all had business over to Santa Fe.  Why, about eight years ago I had business--\"    \"Choke up,\" interposed Red. \"About eight years ago yu was washin' pans  for cookie, an' askin' me for cartridges. Buck used to larrup yu about  four times a day eight years ago.\"    To their roars of laughter Hopalong dropped to the rear, where,  red-faced and quiet, he bent his thoughts on how to get square.    \"We'll have a pleasant time corralling that gang,\" began Billy for the  third time.    \"For heaven's sake get off that trail!\" replied Lanky. \"We aint goin' to  hold 'em up. De-plomacy's th' game.\"    Billy looked dubious and said nothing. If he hadn't proven that he was  as nervy as any man in the outfit they might have taken more stock in  his grumbling.    \"What's the latest from Abilene way?\" Asked Buck of Frenchy.    \"Nothin' much 'cept th' barb-wire ruction,\" replied the recruit.    \"What's that?\" Asked Red, glancing apprehensively back at Hopalong.    \"Why, th' settlers put up barb-wire fence so's the cattle wouldn't get  on their farms. That would a been all right, for there wasn't much of  it. But some Britishers who own a couple of big ranches out there got  smart all of a sudden an' strung wire all along their lines. Punchers  crossin' th' country would run plumb into a fence an' would have to ride  a day an' a half, mebbe, afore they found th' corner. Well, naturally,  when a man has been used to ridin' where he blame pleases an' as  straight as he pleases he ain't goin' to chase along a five-foot fence  to Trisco when he wants to get to Waco. So th' punchers got to totin'  wire-snips, an' when they runs up agin a fence they cuts down half a  mile or so. Sometimes they'd tie their ropes to a strand an' pull off a  couple of miles an' then go back after th' rest. Th' ranch bosses sent  out men to watch th' fences an' told 'em to shoot any festive puncher  that monkeyed with th' hardware. Well, yu know what happens when a  puncher gets shot at.\"    \"When fences grow in Texas there'll be th' devil to pay,\" said Buck. He  hated to think that some day the freedom of the range would be annulled,  for he knew that it would be the first blow against the cowboys'  occupation. When a man's cattle couldn't spread out all over the land he  wouldn't have to keep so many men. Farms would spring up and the sun of  the free-and-easy cowboy would slowly set.    \"I reckons th' cutters are classed th' same as rustlers,\" remarked Red  with a gleam of temper.    \"By th' owners, but not by th' punchers; an' it's th' punchers that  count,\" replied Frenchy.    \"Well, we'll give them a fight,\" interposed Hopalong, riding up. \"When  it gets so I can't go where I please I'll start on th' warpath. I won't  buck the cavalry, but I'll keep it busy huntin' for me an' I'll have  time to 'tend to th' wire-fence men, too. Why, we'll be told we can't  tote our guns!\"    \"They're sayin' that now,\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25502"],[0,"Hero-Myths & Legends of the British Race (#15)"],[1,"of  Christians raised hymns of prayer and praise until the ninth hour;  then came a mighty crowd bearing a young man lifeless on his bier. At  Judas's command they laid down the bier, and he, praying to God,  solemnly raised in turn each of the crosses and held it above the dead  man's head. Lifeless still he lay as Judas raised the first two, but  when he held above the corpse the third, the True Cross, the dead man  arose instantly, body and soul reunited, one in praising God, and the  whole multitude broke out into shouts of thanksgiving to the Lord  of Hosts, and the sacred relic was restored to the loving care of the  queen.      The Nails Sought for    Nevertheless Elene's longing was still unsatisfied. She called Judas  (whose new name in baptism was Cyriacus) and begged him to fulfil her  desires, and to pray to God that she might find the nails which had  pierced the Lord of Life, where they lay hidden from men in the ground  of Calvary. Leading her out of the town, Cyriacus again prayed on  Mount Calvary that God would send forth a token and reveal the secret.  As he prayed there came from heaven a leaping flame, brighter than the  sun, which touched the surface of the ground here and there, and  kindled in each place a tiny star. When they dug at the spots where  the stars shone they found each nail shining visibly and casting a  radiance of its own in the dark earth. So Elene had obtained her  heart's desire, and had now the True Cross and the Holy Nails.      Good News Brought to Constantine    Word of his mother's success was sent to the Emperor Constantine, and  he was asked what should be done with these glorious relics. He bade  Elene build in Jerusalem a glorious church, and make therein a  beautiful shrine of silver, where the Holy Cross should be guarded for  all generations by priests who should watch it day and night. This was  done, but the nails were still Elene's possession, and she was at a  loss how to preserve these holy relics, when the devout Cyriacus, now  ordained Bishop of Jerusalem, went to her and said: \"O lady and queen,  take these precious nails for thy son the emperor. Make with them  rings for his horse's bridle. Victory shall ever go with them; they  shall be called Holy to God, and he shall be called blessed whom that  horse bears.\" The advice pleased the queen, and she had wrought a  glorious bridle, adorned with the Holy Nails, and sent it to her son.  Constantine received it with all reverence, and ordained that April  24, the day of the miracle of revelation, should henceforth be kept in  honour as \"Holy Cross Day.\" Thus were the Emperor's zeal and the royal  mother's devotion rewarded, and Christendom was enriched by some of  its most precious treasures, the True Cross and the Holy Nails.          CHAPTER IV: THE COMPASSION OF CONSTANTINE      Youth of Constantine    Constantine the Great was the eldest son of the Roman Emperor  Constantius and the British Princess Helena, or Elena, and was brought  up as a devout worshipper of the many gods of Rome. The lad grew up  strong and handsome, of a tall and majestic figure, skilled in all  warlike exercises, and, as he fought in the civil wars between the  various Roman emperors, he showed himself a bold and prudent general  in battle, a friendly and popular leader in time of peace. The  popularity of the youthful Constantine was dangerous to him, and he  needed, and showed, great skill in evading the deadly jealousy of the  old Emperor Diocletian, and the hatred of his father's rival,  Galerius. At last, however, his position became so dangerous that  Constantius felt his son's life was no longer safe, and earnestly  begged him to visit his native land of Britain, where Constantius had  just been proclaimed emperor and had defeated the wild Caledonians.  The excuse given was that Constantius was in bad health and needed his  son; but not until the young man was actually in Britain would his  anxious father avow that he feared for his son's life.      Acclaimed Emperor    When the half-British Constantius died, Constantine, who was the  favourite of the Roman soldiery of the west, was at once acclaimed as  emperor by his devoted troops. He professed unwillingness to accept  the honour, and it is said that he even tried in vain to escape on  horseback from the affectionate solicitations of his soldiers. Seeing  the uselessness of further protest, Constantine accepted the imperial  title, and wrote to Galerius claiming the throne and justifying his  acceptance of the unsought dignity thrust upon him. Galerius  acquiesced in the inevitable, and granted Constantine the inferior  title of \"Caesar,\" with rule over Western Europe, and the wise prince  was content to wait until favouring circumstances should destroy his  rivals and give him that sole sway over the Roman Empire for which he  was so well fitted. He had now reached the age of thirty, had fought  valiantly in the wars in Egypt and Persia, and had risen by merit to  the rank of tribune. His marriage with Fausta, the daughter of the  Emperor Maximian, and his elevation to the rank of Augustus brought  him nearer to the attainment of his ambition; and at length the defeat  and death of his rivals placed him at the head of the world-wide  empire of Rome. It is to some period previous to Constantine's  elevation to the supreme authority that we must refer the following  story, told by Gower in his \"Confessio Amantis\" as an example of that  true charity which is the mother of pity, and makes a man's heart so  tender that,        \"Though he might himself relieve,      Yet he would not another grieve,\"    but in order to give pleasure to others would bear his own trouble  alone.      Becomes a Leper    The noble Constantine, Emperor of Rome, was in the full flower of his  age, goodly to look upon, strong and happy, when a great and sudden  affliction came upon him: leprosy attacked him. The horrible disease  showed itself first in his face, so that no concealment was possible,  and if he had not been the emperor he would have been driven out to  live in the forests and wilds. The leprosy spread from his face till  it entirely covered his body, and became so bad that he could no  longer ride out or show himself to his people. When all cures had been  tried and had failed, Constantine withdrew himself from his lords,  gave up all use of arms, abandoned his imperial duties, and shut  himself in his palace, where he lived such a secluded life in his own  apartments that Rome had, as it were, no lord, and all men throughout  the empire talked of his illness and prayed their gods to heal him.  When everything seemed to be in vain, Constantine yielded to the  prayer of his council, that he would summon all the doctors, learned  men, and physicians from every realm to Rome, that they might consider  his illness and try if any cure could be found for his malady.      Rewards Offered for his Cure    A proclamation went forth throughout the world and great rewards were  offered to any man who should heal the emperor. Tempted by the rewards  and the great fame to be won, there came leeches and physicians from  Persia and Arabia, and from every land that owned the sway of Rome,  philosophers from Greece and Egypt, and magicians and sorcerers from  the unexplored desert of the east. But, though Constantine tried all  the remedies suggested or recommended by the wise men, his leprosy  grew no better, but rather worse, and even magic could give him no  help.    Again the learned men assembled and consulted what they should advise,  for all were loath to abandon the emperor in his great distress, but  they were all at a loss. They sat in silence, till at last one very  old and very wise man, a great physician from Arabia, arose and said:      A Desperate Remedy    \"Now that all else has failed, and naught is of any avail, I will tell  of a remedy of which I have heard. It will, I believe, certainly cure  our beloved emperor, but it is very terrible, and therefore I was  loath to name it till every other means had been tried and failed, for  it is a cruel thing for any man to do. Let the Emperor dip himself in  a full bath of the blood of infants and children, seven years old or  under, and he shall be healed, and his leprosy shall fall from him;  for this malady is not natural to his body, and it demands an  unnatural cure.\"      Constantine Assents Regretfully    The proposal was a terrible one to the assembly, and many would not  agree to it at first, but when they considered that nothing else would  heal the emperor they at length gave way, and sent two from among  themselves to bring the news to Constantine, who was waiting for them  in his darkened room. He was horrified when he heard the counsel they  brought, and at first utterly refused to carry out so evil a plan; but  because his life was very dear to his people, and because he felt that  he had a great work to do in the world, he ultimately agreed, with  many tears, to try the terrible remedy.      A Cruel Proclamation    Thereupon the council drew up letters, under the emperor's hand and  seal, and sent them out to all the world, bidding all mothers with  children of seven years of age or under to bring them with speed to  Rome, that there the blood of the innocents might prove healing to the  emperor's malady. Alas! what weeping and wailing there was among the  mothers when they heard this cruel decree! How they cried, and clasped  their babes to their breasts, and how they called Constantine more  cruel than Herod, who killed the Holy Innocents! The eastern ruler,  they said, slew only the infants of one poor village, but their  emperor, more ruthless, claimed the lives of all the young children of  his whole empire.      Constantine is Conscience-stricken    But though the mothers lamented bitterly, they must needs bow to the  emperor's decree, whether they were lief or loath, and thus a great  multitude gathered in the "]]]
