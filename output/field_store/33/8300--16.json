Therefore  every now and then the power would give out and Mr. Baldwin and his men  would be forced to get out and run along beside the train, pushing it as  they went that it might keep up its momentum until a supply of steam  could again be acquired. Can you ask for anything more primitive than  that?\"    \"It certainly makes one realize the progress locomotive builders have  made,\" the boy replied, with gravity.    \"It certainly does,\" agreed his father. \"Think how Baldwin and his men  must have struggled first with one difficulty and then with another;  think how they must have experimented and worked to perfect the tiny  engine with which they began! It was the conquering of this multitude of  defects that gave to the world the intricate, exquisitely made machine  which at this very minute is pulling you and me into New York.\"    There was an interval of silence during which Stephen glanced out at the  flying panorama framed by the window.    \"Where was New England all this time?\" demanded he, with jealous  concern. \"Didn't Massachusetts do anything except build the old granite  road at Quincy?\"    \"Railroads, for various reasons, were not popular in Massachusetts,\"  returned his father. \"As usual New England was conservative and was  therefore slow in waking up to the importance of steam transportation.  Boston was on the coast, you see, and had its ships as well as the canal  boats that connected the city with the manufacturing districts of the  Merrimac. Therefore, although the question of building railroads was  agitated in 1819 nothing was done about the matter. As was natural the  canal company opposed the venture, and there was little enthusiasm  elsewhere concerning a project that demanded a great outlay of money  with only scant guarantee that any of it would ever come back to the  capitalists who advanced it. Moreover, the public in general was  sceptical about railroads or else totally uninterested in them. And even  had a railroad been built at this time it would not have been a steam  road for it was proposed to propel the cars by horse power just as those  at Quincy had been.\"    \"Oh!\" interjected Steve scornfully. \"They might at least have tried  steam.\"    \"People had little faith in it,\" explained Mr. Tolman. \"Those who had  the faith lacked the money to back the enterprise, and those who had the  money lacked the faith. If a company could have gone ahead and built a  steam railroad that was an unquestioned success many persons would  undoubtedly have been convinced of its value and been willing to put  capital into it; but as matters stood, there was so much antagonism  against the undertaking that nobody cared to launch the venture. There  were many business men who honestly regarded a steam railroad as a  menace to property and so strong was this feeling that in 1824 the town  of Dorchester, a village situated a short distance from Boston, actually  took legal measures to prevent any railroad from passing through its  territory.\"    \"They needn't have been so fussed,\" said Stephen, with a grin.  \"Railroads weren't plenty enough to worry them!\"    \"Oh, the Quincy road was not the only railroad in Massachusetts,\" his  father asserted quickly, \"for in spite of opposition a railroad to  Lowell, modeled to some extent after the old granite road, had been  built. This railroad was constructed on stone ties, as the one at Quincy  had been; for although such construction was much more costly it was  thought at the time to be far more durable. Several years afterward,  when experience had demonstrated that wood possessed more _give_, and  that a hard, unyielding roadbed only creates jar, the granite ties that  had cost so much were taken up and replaced by wooden ones.\"    \"What a shame!\"    \"Thus do we live and learn,\" said his father whimsically. \"Our blunders  are often very expensive. The only redeeming thing about them is that we  pass our experience on to others and save them from tumbling into the  same pit. Thus it was with the early railroad builders. When the Boston  and Providence Road was constructed this mistake was not repeated and a  flexible wooden roadbed was laid. In the meantime a short steam  railroad line had been built from Boston to Newton, a distance of seven  miles, and gradually the road to this suburb was lengthened until it  extended first to Natick and afterward to Worcester, a span of  forty-four miles. Over this road, during fine weather, three trains ran  daily; in winter there were but two. I presume nothing simpler or less  pretentious could have been found than this early railroad whose trains  were started at the ringing of a bell hung on a near-by tree. Although  it took three hours to make a trip now made in one, the journey was  considered very speedy, and unquestionably it was if travelers had to  cover the distance by stagecoach. When we consider that in 1834 it took  freight the best part of a week to get to Boston by wagons a three-hour  trip becomes a miracle.\"    \"I suppose there was not so much freight in those days anyway,\" Steve  speculated.    \"Fortunately not. People had less money and less leisure to travel, and  therefore there were not so many trunks to be carried; I am not sure,  too, but the frugal Americans of that day had fewer clothes to take with  them when they did go. Then, as each town or district was of necessity  more or less isolated, people knew fewer persons outside of their own  communities, did a less extensive business, and had less incentive to go  a-visiting. Therefore, although the Boston and Worcester Railroad could  boast only two baggage cars (or burthen cars, as they were called), the  supply was sufficient, which was fortunate, especially since the  freight house in Boston was only large enough to shelter these two.\"    \"And out of all this grew the Boston and Albany Railroad?\" questioned  the boy.    \"Yes, although it was not until 1841, about eight years later, that the  line was extended to New York State. By that time tracks had been laid  through the Berkshire hills, opening up the western part of  Massachusetts. The story of that first momentous fifteen-hour journey of  the Boston officials to the New York capital, where they were welcomed  and entertained by the Albany dignitaries, is picturesque reading  indeed. One of the party who set out from Boston on that memorable day  carried with him some spermaceti candles which on the delegates' arrival  were burned with great ceremony at the evening dinner.\"    \"I suppose it seemed a wonderful thing to reach Albany in fifteen  hours,\" remarked Steve.    \"It was like a fairy tale,\" his father answered. \"To estimate the marvel  to the full you must think how long it would have taken to drive the  distance, or make the journey by water. Therefore the Boston officials  burned their spermaceti candles in triumph; and the next day, when the  Albany hosts returned to Boston with their guests, they symbolized the  onrush of the world's progress by bringing with them a barrel of flour  which had been cut, threshed, and ground only two days before, and put  into a wooden barrel made from a tree which was cut down, sawed, and  put together while the flour was being ground. This does not seem to us  anything very astounding but it was a feat to stop the breath in those  days.\"    \"And what did they do with the flour?\"    \"Oh, that evening when they reached Boston the flour was made into some  sort of bread which was served at the dinner the Boston men gave to  their visitors.\"    \"I wonder what they would have said if somebody had told them then that  sometime people would be going from Boston to New York in five hours?\"  the lad observed.    \"I presume they would not have believed it,\" was the reply. \"Nor would  they have been able to credit tales of the great numbers of persons who  would constantly be traveling between these two great cities. At that  time so few people made the trip that it was very easy to keep track of  them; and that they might be identified in case of accident the company  retained a list of those who went on the trains. At first this rule  worked very well, the passengers being carefully tabulated, together  with their place of residence; but later, when traffic began to increase  and employees began to have more to do, those whose duty it was to make  out these lists became hurried and careless and in the old railroad  annals we read such entries as these:    \"'_Woman in green bonnet; boy; stranger; man with side whiskers,_'  etc.\"    A peal of laughter broke from Stephen.    \"Railroad officials would have some job to list passengers now, wouldn't  they?\" he said. \"We should all just have to wear identification tags as  the men did during the War.\"    His father acquiesced whimsically.    \"I have sometimes feared we might have to come to that, anyway,\" he  replied. \"With the sky populated with aeroplanes and the streets filled  with automobiles man stands little chance in these days of preserving  either his supremacy or his identity. When we get on Fifth Avenue to-day  you see if you do not agree with me,\" he added, as the train pulled into  the big station.          CHAPTER VIII    NEW YORK AND WHAT HAPPENED THERE      It took no very long interval to prove that there was some foundation  for Mr. Tolman's last assertion, for within a short time the travelers  were standing on Fifth Avenue amid the rush of traffic, and feeling of  as little importance as dwarfs in a giant's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22248"],[0,"The Indian Fairy Book: From the Original Legends (#15)"],[1,"st, and in the midst  of the ruddy silence a solitary lodge stood on the banks of a remote  lake. One sound only broke, in the least degree, the forest  stillness--the low breathing of the dying inmate, who was the head of a  poor family. His wife and children surrounded the buffalo robe on which  he lay. Of the children, two were almost grown up--a daughter and a son;  the other was a boy, and a mere child in years.    All the skill of the household in their simple medicines was exhausted,  and they stood looking on or moved about the lodge with whispered steps,  awaiting the departure of the spirit. As one of the last acts of  kindness, the skin door of the lodge had been thrown back to admit the  fresh air of the evening. The poor man felt a momentary return of  strength, and raising himself a little, he addressed his family.    \"I leave you,\" he said, \"in a world of care, in which it has required  all my strength and skill to supply you food, and to protect you from  the storms and cold of a harsh climate.\"    He cast his eyes upon his wife, and continued:    \"For you, my partner in life, I have less sorrow, because I am persuaded  you will not remain long behind me; but you, my children! my poor and  forsaken children, who have just begun the career of life, who will  shelter you from calamity? Listen to my words. Unkindness, ingratitude,  and every wickedness, are in the scene before you. It was for this that  years ago I withdrew from my kindred and my tribe to spend my days in  this lonely spot. I have contented myself with the company of your  mother and yourselves, during seasons of very frequent scarcity and  want, while your kindred, feasting in plenty, have caused the forests to  echo with the shouts of successful war. I gave up these things for the  enjoyment of peace. I wished to hide you away from the bad examples  which would have spoiled your innocence. I have seen you, thus far, grow  up in purity of heart. If we have sometimes suffered bodily want, we  have escaped pain of mind. We have not been compelled to look on or to  take a part with the red hand in scenes of rioting and bloodshed. My  path now stops. I have arrived at the brink of the world. I will shut my  eyes in peace if you, my children, will promise me to cherish each  other. Let not your mother suffer during the few days that are left to  her; and I charge you, on no account, to forsake your younger brother.  Of him I give you both my dying command to have a tender care.\"    He spoke no more, and as the sun fell out of view the light had gone  from his face. The family stood still, as if they expected to hear  something further; but when they came to his side and called him by  name, his spirit did not answer. It was in another world.    The mother and daughter lamented aloud, but the elder son clothed  himself in silence, as though it had been a mantle, and took his course  as though nothing had occurred. He exerted himself to supply, with his  bow and net, the wants of the little household, but he never made  mention of his father.    Five moons had filled and waned, and the sixth was near its full, when  the mother also died. In her last moments she pressed the fulfillment of  their father's wish.    The winter passed, and the spring, sparkling in the clear northern air,  cheered the spirits of the lonely little people in the lodge.    The girl, being the eldest, directed her brothers, and she seemed to  feel a tender and sisterly affection for the youngest, who was slight in  frame and of a delicate temper. The other boy soon began to break forth  with restless speeches, which showed that his spirit was not at ease.  One day he addressed his sister as follows:    \"My sister, are we always to live as if there were no other human beings  in the world? Must I deprive myself of the pleasure of mingling with my  own kind? I have determined this question for myself. I shall seek the  villages of men, and you can not prevent me.\"    The sister replied:    \"I do not say no, my brother, to what you desire; we are not forbidden  the society of our fellow-mortals, but we are told to cherish each  other, and to do nothing that shall not be agreeable to all our little  household. Neither pleasure nor pain ought, therefore, to separate us,  especially from our younger brother, who, being but a child, and weakly  withal, is entitled to a double share of our affection. If we follow our  separate fancies, it will surely make us neglect him, whom we are bound  by vows, both to our father and mother, to support.\"    The young man received this address in silence, and still took his  course as though nothing out of the ordinary way had occurred. After  awhile he seemed to recover his spirits; and as they lived in a large  country, where there were open fields, the two brothers, at his  invitation, often amused themselves in playing ball. One afternoon he  chose the ground near to a beautiful lake, and they played and laughed  with great spirit, and the ball was seldom allowed to touch the ground.    Now in this lake there happened to harbor a wicked old Manito, Mishosha  by name, who looked at the brothers as they played, and he was vastly  pleased with their nimbleness and beauty. He thought to himself, what  shall I do to get these lads to accompany me? One of them shall hit the  ball sideways, and it shall fall into my canoe.    It so happened, and it somehow seemed as if Owasso, the elder brother,  had purposely given it that direction. When Owasso saw the old man, he  professed to be greatly surprised, as was the other, Sheem by name, in  truth, for he had not noticed the old Manito before.    \"Bring the ball to us,\" they both cried out. \"Come to the shore.\"    \"No,\" answered the old magician. He, however, came near enough for  either of them to wade out to him. \"Come, come,\" he said. \"Come and get  your ball.\"    They insisted that he should come ashore, but he sturdily declined to  oblige them.    \"Very well,\" said Owasso, \"I will go and get it.\" And he ran into the  water. \"Hand it to me,\" he said, when he had approached near enough to  receive it.    \"Ha!\" answered the Manito, \"reach over and get it yourself.\"    Owasso was about to grasp the ball, when the old magician suddenly  seized him and pushed him into the boat.    \"My grandfather,\" said Owasso, \"pray take my little brother also. Alone  I can not go with you; he will starve if I leave him.\"    Mishosha only laughed at him; then uttering the charmed words, \"Chemaun  Poll!\" and giving his canoe a slap, it glided through the water, without  further help, with the swiftness of an arrow.    In a short time they reached the magician's lodge, which stood upon the  further shore, a little distance back from the lake. The two daughters  of Mishosha were seated within. \"My daughter,\" he said to his eldest, as  they entered the lodge, \"I have brought you a husband.\"    The young woman smiled; for Owasso was a comely youth to look upon. The  magician told him to take his seat near her, and by this act the  marriage ceremony was completed, and Owasso and the magician's daughter  were man and wife, and in the course of time they had born to them a  son.    But no sooner was Owasso in the family than the old Manito wished him  out of the way, and he went about in his own wicked fashion to compass  it.    One day he asked his son-in-law to go out a-fishing with him. They  started without delay; for the magician had only to speak, and off went  the canoe. They reached a solitary bay in an island, a very dark,  lonely, and out-of-the-way place. The Manito advised Owasso to spear a  large sturgeon which came alongside, and with its great glassy eye  turned up, seemed to recognize the magician. Owasso rose in the boat to  dart his spear, and by speaking that moment to his canoe, Mishosha shot  forward and hurled his son-in-law headlong into the water; where,  leaving him to struggle for himself, he was soon out of sight.    Owasso, being himself gifted with limited magical powers, spoke to the  fish, and bade him swim toward the lodge, while he carried him along,  which he did at great speed. Once he directed the sturgeon to rise near  the surface of the water, so that he might, if possible, get a view of  the magician. The fish obeyed, and Owasso saw the wicked old Manito busy  in another direction, fishing, as unconcerned as though he had not just  lost a member of his family.    On went the fish, and on went Owasso, till they reached the shore, near  the magician's lodge, in advance of him. He then spoke kindly to the  sturgeon, and told him he should not be angry with him for having  speared him, as he was created to be meat for man. The sturgeon made no  reply, or if he did, it has not been reported; and Owasso, drawing him  on shore, went up and told his wife to dress and cook it immediately. By  the time it was prepared the magician had come in sight.    \"Your grandfather has arrived,\" said the woman to her son; \"go and see  what he brings, and eat this as you go\"--handing a piece of the fish.    The boy went, and the magician no sooner saw him with the fish in his  hand, than he asked him, \"What are you eating? and who brought it?\"    He replied, \"My father brought it.\"    The magician began to feel uneasy, for he found that he had been  outwitted; he, however, put on a grave face, and entering the lodge,  acted as if nothing unusual had happened.    Some days after this, Mishosha again requested his son-in-law to  accompany him; and Owasso, without hesitation, said \"Yes!\"    They went out, and, in a rapid passage, they arrived at a solitary  island, which was no more than a heap of high and craggy rocks.    The magician said to Owasso, \"Go on shore, my son, and pick up all the  gulls' eggs you can find.\"    The rocks were strewn with eggs, and the air resounded with the cry of  the birds as they saw them gathered up by Owasso.    The old magician took the opportunity to speak to the"]]]
