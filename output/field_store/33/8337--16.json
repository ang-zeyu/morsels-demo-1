But for  some unknown reason, probably in order that the dead hero's bones might be  placed in the most sacred spot possible--he was laid to rest by the side  of the martyr, then in the zenith of his sanctity. One of the most  romantic figures in English history is that of Edward the Black Prince,  who \"fought the French\" as no Briton, except perhaps Nelson, has fought  them since; he was sixteen years old when he commanded the English army  in person at the battle of Cressy, and was wounded in the thickest of that  most sanguinary fray: ten years later, facing an army of 60,000 men with  a mere 8,000 behind him, he inflicted a still more severe defeat on the  French at Poitiers, and captured their king, whom he took with him to  Canterbury on his triumphant return to London. In all our list of national  heroes there is not one who upheld the prowess of the English arms more  gallantly than this mighty warrior who was cut off while still in the  flower of his years, leaving England to the miseries of sedition and civil  war. His tomb is one of the most impressive of such monuments. The gilding  and bright colours have almost entirely disappeared, but the striking  effect of the effigy is probably only enhanced by the solemn sombreness of  its present appearance. It is a figure clad in full armour, spurred and  helmeted, as the Prince had ordained by his will. The head rests on the  helmet and the hands are joined in the attitude of prayer. The face, which  is undoubtedly a portrait, is stern and masterful. \"There you can see  his fine face with the Plantagenet features, the flat cheeks, and the  well-chiselled nose, to be traced, perhaps, in the effigy of his father in  Westminster Abbey, and his grandfather in Gloucester Cathedral.\" The tomb  itself is worthy to support the figure and guard the ashes of the Black  Prince. Carved on its side clearly, that all might read it, is the  inscription which he had himself chosen; it is in Norman French, which was  still the language spoken by the English Court, and in the same spirit  which moved the designer of Archbishop Chichele's tomb to portray the  living man and the mouldering skeleton, this epitaph contrasts the glories  of the Prince's life--his wealth, beauty, and power--with the decay and  corruption of the grave. It is distinctly pagan in thought, and reminds  one strongly of the laments of the dead Homeric heroes as they wail for  the joys of life and strength and lordship. Stanley states that it is  \"borrowed, with a few variations, from the anonymous French translation of  the 'Clericalis Disciplina' of Petrus Alphonsus composed between the years  1106 and 1110.\" But it is strangely un-Christian in sentiment as a few  lines will show--        \"Tiel come tu es, je autiel fu, tu seras tiel come je su,      De la mort ne pensay je mie, tant come j'avoy la vie.      En terre avoy grand richesse, dont je y fys grand noblesse,      Terre, mesons, et grand tresor, draps, chivalx, argent et or.      Mesore su je povres et cheitifs, perfond en la terre gys,      Ma grand beaute est tout alee, ma char est tout gastee      Moult est estroite ma meson, en moy ne si verite non,      Et si ore me veissez, je ne quide pas que vous deeisez      Que j'eusse onges hom este, si su je ore de tout changee.\"    Below this inscription are ranged coats-of-arms, bearing the ostrich  feathers and the motto _Ich Diene_ (\"I serve\"), which, according to  time-honoured but unauthenticated tradition, the prince won from the blind  King of Bohemia, who was led into the thick of the fighting at Cressy, and  died on the field. Welsh archaeologists, however, maintain that these words  are Celtic, and mean \"behold the man;\" their theory suggests that this was  the phrase used by Edward I. when he presented his firstborn son to the  Welsh people as their prince, and that the words thus became the motto of  the princes of Wales. This is a rather far-fetched piece of reasoning, and  one would certainly prefer to accept the more picturesque tradition which  connects the phrase with the glories of Cressy. The other word found on  these escutcheons--_Houmont_--is still more puzzling. We know that the  Black Prince was wont to sign himself _Houmont, Ich Diene_. Stanley  explains the combination gracefully, but not very convincingly. \"If, as  seems most likely, they are German words, they exactly express what we  have seen so often in his life, the union of 'Hoch muth,' that is _high  spirit_, with 'Ich Dien,' _I serve_. They bring before us the very scene  itself after the battle of Poitiers, where, after having vanquished the  whole French nation, he stood behind the captive king, and served him like  an attendant.\"    [Illustration: THE BLACK PRINCE'S TOMB  (FROM A PHOTOGRAPH BY CARL NORMAN AND CO.).]    The tomb is surmounted by a canopy on which is painted an interesting  representation of the Trinity. The work is a good deal faded, but still  worthy of notice; the absence of the figure of the dove is curious, but is  not unparalleled in such designs. At the corners are symbols of the four  evangelists. The Holy Trinity--on whose feast-day he died--was held in  peculiar veneration by the Black Prince. The ordinance of the chantry  founded by him in the crypt contains the phrase, _Ad honorem Sancte  Trinitatis quam peculiari devocione semper colimus_. A curious metal  badge, preserved in the British Museum, is stamped with the figure of the  prince kneeling before the Almighty and our Saviour, whose representation  is almost identical with the design on the canopy over the tomb; here also  the figure of the dove is absent. Round the canopy and in the pillars we  can still see the hooks which upheld the black tapestry, bordered with  crimson and embroidered with _cygnes avec tetes de dames_, which was hung,  as ordained by his will, round the prince's tomb and Becket's shrine.    [Illustration: SHIELD, COAT, ETC., OF THE BLACK PRINCE.]    Lastly, above the canopy, on a cross-beam between two pillars, are  suspended the brazen gauntlets, the helmet, the wooden shield with its  moulded leather covering, the velvet coat emblazoned with the arms of  England and France, and the empty sheath. The gauntlets were once  embellished with little figures of lions on the knuckles; these have been  detached by \"collectors,\" vandals almost as ruthless as Blue Dick and his  troopers, and without their excuse of mistaken religious zeal. The helmet  still has its original lining of leather, showing that it was actually  worn. The sword which fitted the now empty sheath is said to have been  taken away by Oliver Cromwell; it appeared in Manchester at the beginning  of this century under circumstances so curious, that we may be excused for  quoting the following letter from Canon Wray, given in Stanley's Appendix  on the Black Prince's will. \"The sword, or supposed sword, of the Black  Prince, which Oliver Cromwell is said to have carried away, I have seen  and many times have had in my hands. There lived in Manchester, when I  first came here, a Mr. Thomas Barritt, a saddler by trade; he was a great  antiquarian, and had collected together helmets, coats of mail, horns,  etc., and many coins. But what he valued most of all was a sword: the  blade about two feet long, and on the blade was let in, in letters of  gold, 'EDWARDUS WALLIE PRINCEPS'.... He was in possession of this sword  A.D. 1794. He told me he purchased many of the ancient relics of a pedlar,  who travelled through the country selling earthenware, and I think he said  he got this sword from this pedlar. When Barritt died, in 1820, his  curiosities were sold by his widow at a raffle, but I believe this sword  was not amongst the articles so disposed of. It had probably been disposed  of beforehand, but to whom I never knew; yet I think it not unlikely that  it is still in the neighbourhood. The sword was a little curved,  scimitar-like, rather thick, broad blade, and had every appearance of  being the Black Prince's sword.\" Truly a most remarkable story. This  historic blade, which may have hewn down the French ranks at Poitiers, is  disposed of by an itinerant crockery vender to an antiquarian saddler; on  his death is, or is not, \"sold at a raffle\" and--vanishes!    [Illustration: WEST GATE.]    These arms that hang over the prince's tomb are all that are left of  two distinct suits, one for war, and one for use in the joust and the  ceremonials of peace, which were, according to directions given in the  will, carried in the funeral procession through the West Gate and along  the High Street to the cathedral. The pieces which remain all belong to  the suit worn in actual warfare.    The centre of the chapel looks curiously blank, being left so by the  thoroughness with which all trace of Becket's shrine was removed by the  reforming zeal and insatiable rapacity of Henry VIII. and his minions. The  effect of the bare stone pavement presents an impressive contrast to the  vanished glories of the shrine blazing with gold and jewels, as we read of  it. (For a description of the shrine and its history, see Chapter I.) The  exact place on which it stood is plainly shown by the marks worn in the  stones by the knees of generations of pilgrims as they knelt before it,  while the prior, with his white wand, pointed out the choicest of its  treasures. To the west, between the altar-screen--the unhappy effect of  which is painfully conspicuous from this point--and the site of the  shrine, there is some very interesting mosaic pavement, containing the  signs of the zodiac, and emblems of virtue and vice, an example of the  _Opus Alexandrinum_, which appears in the floors of most of the Roman  basilicas. A similar piece of mosaic work may be seen round the shrine of  Edward the Confessor at Westminster. Above the eastern"]]]
