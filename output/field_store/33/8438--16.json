Another form of knife suitable for paring the edges of  leather is shown at fig. 60, B.        [Illustration: FIG. 60.]    To test if the leather has been sufficiently pared, fold it over where  the edge of the board will come, and run the finger along the folded  leather. If the paring has been done properly it will feel quite even  the whole length of the fold; but if there are any irregularities,  they will be very apparent, and the paring must be gone over again  till they have disappeared. When even, the book must be again laid on  the leather with the boards open, and a pencil line drawn round as  before. If there are leather joints they will have been pared before  the book was sewn, and care must be taken in paring the turn-in of the  cover that it is of the same thickness as the leather joint, or it  will be impossible to make a neat mitre at the back corners.                                     COVERING    Before covering, the book must be looked at to see that the bands are  quite square and at equal distances apart. Any slight errors in this  respect can be corrected by holding the book in the lying press  between backing boards and gently tapping the bands from one side or  the other with a piece of wood struck with a hammer. This is best done  when the back is cleaned off, but by damping the bands slightly it may  be done just before covering. The squares must be looked to, and the  edges of the board well rubbed with a folder, or tapped with a hammer,  to remove any burr that may have been caused by the plough knife, or  any chance blow. The back is then moistened with paste, or, in the  case of a very large book, with thin glue, and left to soak. The cover  can then be well pasted with thickish paste, that has been previously  well beaten up. When the cover is pasted, it can be folded with the  pasted sides together and left to soak for a few minutes while the  back is again looked to, and any roughness smoothed down with the  folder. Before covering, the bands should be nipped up with band  nippers (see fig. 61) to make sure that they are sharp. The coverer  should have ready before covering a clean paring stone, one or two  folders, a pair of nickeled-band nippers, a clean sponge, a little  water in a saucer, a piece of thread, and a strip of smooth wood  (boxwood for preference), called a band stick, used for smoothing the  leather between the bands, a pair of scissors, and a small sharp  knife, a pair of waterproof sheets the size of the book, and, if the  book is a large one, a pair of tying up boards, with tying up string,  and two strips of wood covered in blotting-paper or leather. It is  best to have the band nippers for covering nickeled to prevent the  iron from staining the leather. The waterproof sheets recommended are  thin sheets of celluloid, such as are used by photographers.        [Illustration: FIG. 61.]    When these things are ready, the pasted cover should be examined and  repasted if it has dried in any place. The amount of paste to be used  for covering can only be learned by experience. A thick leather will  take more than a thin one, but, provided the cover sticks tight at  every point, the less paste used the better. If there is too much, it  will rub up and make very ugly, uneven places under the leather; and  if there is too little, the cover will not stick.        [Illustration: FIG. 62.]    Take the pasted cover and look to see which is the better side of the  leather. Lay the front of the book down on this exactly up to the  marks that show the beginning of the turn-in. Then draw the leather  over the back and on to the other side, pulling it slightly, but not  dragging it. Then stand the book on its fore-edge on a piece of waste  paper, with the leather turned out on either side, as shown at fig.  62, and nip up the bands with nickeled band nippers (see fig. 63).  After this is done there will probably be a good deal of loose leather  on the back. This can be got rid of by dragging the leather on to the  side; but by far the better plan, when the back is large enough to  allow it, is to work up the surplus leather on to the back between the  panels. This requires a good deal of practice, and is very seldom  done; but it can be done with most satisfactory results. The book  should now have the leather on the back stretched lengthways to make  it cover the bands, but not stretched the other way, and the leather  on the boards should lie perfectly flat and not be stretched at all.  The leather on the fore-edge of the board is then rubbed with the hand  on the outside, and then on to the edge, and then on the inside. The  edge and the inside are smoothed down with a folder, and any excessive  paste on the inside squeezed out and removed. When the fore-edge of  both boards has been turned in, the head and tail must also be turned  in. A little paste is put on to that part of the leather that will  turn in below the headband, and this portion is neatly tucked in  between the boards and the back. The turned-in edge must lie quite  evenly, or it will result in a ridge on the back. The leather is  turned in on the two boards in the same way as described for the  fore-edge, and the edge rubbed square with a folder. At fig. 64 is  shown a convenient form of folder for covering. At the corners the  leather must be pulled over as far as possible with two folders  meeting at the extreme point, the object being to avoid a cut in the  leather at the corner of the board. The folds so formed must be cut  off with the scissors (see fig. 65, A), then one edge tucked neatly  under the other, (B). Care must be taken throughout not to soil the  edges of the leaves.        [Illustration: FIG. 63.]        [Illustration: FIG. 64.]    At the headband the fold of leather, pared thin for the purpose, must  be squeezed together with a folder and pulled out a little to leave an  even projection that can be turned over to form a head-cap. When both  ends have been turned in, in this way, the boards must each be opened  and pressed against a straight-edge held in the joint (fig. 66) to  ensure that there is enough leather in the turn-in of the joint to  allow the cover to open freely; and the leather of the turn-in at the  head and tail must be carefully smoothed down with a folder.        [Illustration: FIG. 65.]        [Illustration: FIG. 66.]        [Illustration: FIG. 67.]    The book may now be shut up if a waterproof sheet is put at each end  to prevent the damp of the cover from cockling the paper. It must then  be stood on its fore-edge and the bands again nipped up with a pair of  nickeled band nippers, and the panels between the bands well pressed  down with the band stick to cause the leather to stick at every point.  A piece of thread is tied round the back from head to tail, squeezing  the leather in the gap caused by the corners of the board having been  cut off. The book is then turned up on end, resting the tail on a  folder or anything that will keep the projecting leather for the  head-cap from being prematurely flattened. The head-caps (fig. 67)  must now be set. To do this the first finger of the left hand is  placed behind it, and a sharp folder is pressed into the corners of  the head-cap between the headband and the thread. The leather is then  tapped over the headband, and the whole turned over on the stone and  rubbed at the back with a folder. This operation requires great  nicety. The shape of head-cap is shown at fig. 67. The nice adjustment  of head-caps and corners, although of no constructional value, are the  points by which the forwarding of a book is generally valued.        [Illustration: FIG. 68.]    If the book is a large one, it will be best to tie it up. The method  of tying up is shown in fig. 68. The tying up cords will make marks at  the side of the bands, that are not unpleasant on a large book. If  they are objected to, it is best to tie the book up for about  half-an-hour, and then to untie it, and smooth out the marks with the  band stick. Even with small books, if the leather seems inclined to  give trouble, it is well to tie them up for a short time, then to  untie them, to smooth out any marks or inequalities, and to tie them  up again.                          MITRING CORNERS AND FILLING IN    A book that has been covered should be left under a light weight until  the next day, with waterproof sheets between the damp cover and the  end paper to prevent the sheets of the book from cockling through the  damp. When the cover is thoroughly set the boards should be carefully  opened, pressing them slightly to the joint to ensure a square and  even joint. If, as is sometimes the case, the turn-in of the leather  over the joint seems to be inclined to bind, the cover should be  merely opened half-way, and the leather of the turns-in of the joint  damped with a sponge, and left to soak for a short time, and then the  cover can usually be opened without any dragging. A section of a good  joint is shown at fig. 69, A, and a bad one at B.        [Illustration: FIG. 69.]        [Illustration: FIG. 70.]    The next operation will be to fill in the board and mitre the corners.  To fill in the boards, a piece of paper as thick as the turn-in of the  leather (engineer's cartridge paper answers very well) should be cut a  little smaller than the board, with one edge cut straight; then with  the straight edge adjusted to the back of the board, and a weight  placed on the centre, the paper is marked round with dividers set to  the intended width of the turn-in of the leather. Then with a sharp  knife, paper and leather may be cut through together. The paper should  then be marked to show its position on the board, and the ragged edges  of the leather trimmed off. This will leave an even margin of leather  on three sides of the inside of the board, and a piece of paper that  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26679"],[0,"Wit and Mirth: or Pills to Purge Melancholy, Vol. 5 of 6 (#15)"],[1,"he bore still about him to cure those that die.          _A_ SONG.

Yet now I think on't, let it be,    To send it me is vain;  Thou hast a Thief in either Eye,    Will steal it back again.    Why should two Hearts in one Breast be,    And yet not be together;  Or Love, where is thy Sympathy,    If thou our Hearts do sever?    But Love is such a Mystery,    I cannot find it out;  For when I think I am best resolv'd,    Then I am most in Doubt.

[Music]    Hears not my _Phillis_ how the Birds,    Their feather'd Mates salute:  They tell their Passion in their Words,    Must I alone, must I alone be mute:  Phillis _without a frown or smile,_  _Sat & knotted, & knotted, & knotted, and knotted all the while._    The God of Love in thy bright Eyes,    Does like a Tyrant Reign;  But in thy Heart a Child he lies,    Without a Dart or Flame.  _Phillis_, &c.    So many Months in silence past,    And yet in raging Love;  Might well deserve one word at last,    My Passion should approve.  _Phillis_, &c.

[Music]    Old _Lewis le Grand_,    He raves like a Fury,    And calls for _Mercury_;  Quoth he, if I can,    I'll finish my Days;  For why should I live?  Since the Fates will not give    One affable smile:  Great _Marlborough_ Conquers,  Great _Marlborough_ Conquers,    I'm ruin'd the while.    The Flower of _France_,    And Troops of my Palace    Which march'd from _Versales_  Who vow'd to Advance,    With Conquering Sword,  Are cut, hack'd and hew'd,  I well may conclude,    They're most of them Slain:  Oh! what will become of,  Oh! what will become of,    My Grand-Son in _Spain_.    My fortify'd Throne,    Propt up by Oppression,    Must yield at Discretion,  For needs must I own,    My Glory decays:  Bold _Marlborough_ comes  With ratling Drums,    And thundering Shot,  He drives all before him,  He drives all before him,    Oh! Where am I got?    He pushes for Crowns,    And slays my Commanders,    And Forces in _Flanders_;  Great Capital Towns,    For _CHARLES_ has declar'd:  These things like a Dart,  Has pierced my Heart,    And threatens my Death;  Here do I lye sighing,  Here do I lye sighing,    And Panting for Breath.    This passionate Grief,    Draws on my Diseases,    Which fatally ceases  My Spirits in chief,    A fit of the Gout,  The Gravel and Stone,  I have 'tis well known,    At this horrid News,  Of _Marlborough's_ Triumph,  Of _Marlborough's_ Triumph,    All Battles I lose.    Wherever he comes,    He is bold and Victorious,    Successful and glorious,  My two Royal Thumbs    With anguish I bite:  To hear his Success;  Yet nevertheless,    My passion's in vain:  I pity my Darling,  I pity my Darling,    Young _Philip_ in _Spain_.    I am out of my Wits,    If e'er I had any;    My Foes they are many,  Which plagues me by fits,    In _Flanders_ and _Spain_:  I'm sick at my Heart,  To think we must part,    With what we enjoy'd,  Towns, Castles, are taken,  Towns, Castles, are taken,    My Troops are destroy'd.    I am I declare,    In a weak Condition,    Go call my Physician,  And let him prepare    Some comfort with speed,  Without all delay,  Assist me I pray,    And hear my Complaint,  A Dram of the Bottle,  A Dram of the Bottle,    Or else I shall faint.    Should I slip my Breath,    At this dreadful Season,    I think it but Reason,  I should lay my Death,    To the daring Foes,  Whose Fire and Smoak,  Has certainly broke,    The Heart in my Breast:  Oh! bring me a Cordial,  Oh! bring me a Cordial,    And lay me to Rest.          _A_ SONG. _Set by Captain_ PACK.      [Music]    Would you be a Man in Fashion?    Would you lead a Life Divine?  Take a little Dram of Passion, (a little dram of Passion)    In a lusty Dose of Wine  If the Nymph has no Compassion,    Vain it is to sigh and groan:  Love was but put in for Fashion,    Wine will do the Work alone.          _A_ SONG.    _Set by Mr._ THO. FARMER.      [Music]    Though the Pride of my Passion fair _Sylvia_ betrays,    And frowns at the Love I impart;  Though kindly her Eyes twist amorous Rays,    To tye a more fortunate Heart:  Yet her Charms are so great, I'll be bold in my Pain,      His Heart is too tender,  Too tender, that's struck with Disdain.    Still my Heart is so just to my Passionate Eyes,    It dissolves with Delight while I gaze:  And he that loves on, though _Sylvia_ denies,    His Love but his Duty obeys:  I no more can refrain her neglects to pursue,      Than the force, the force  Of her Beauty can cease to subdue.          _A_ SONG.      [Music]    When first I fair _Celinda_ knew,    Her Kindness then was great:  Her Eyes I cou'd with Pleasure view,    And friendly Rays did meet:  In all Delights we past the time,    That could Diversion move;  She oft would kindly hear me Rhime    Upon some others Love:  _She oft would kindly hear me Rhime,_    _Upon some others Love._    But ah! at last I grew too bold,    Prest by my growing Flame;  For when my Passion I had told,    She hated ev'n my Name:  Thus I that cou'd her Friendship boast,    And did her Love pursue;  And taught Contentment at the cost,    Of Love and Friendship too.          _A_ SONG.    _Set by Mr._ FISHBURNE.      [Music]    Long had _Damon_ been admir'd,    By the Beauties of the Plain;  Ev'ry Breast warm Love inspir'd,    For the proper handsome Swain:  The choicest Nymph _Sicilia_ bred,    Was won by his resistless Charms:  Soft Looks, and Verse as smooth, had led    And left the Captive in his Arms.    But our _Damon's_ Soul aspires,    To a Goddess of his Race;  Though he sues with chaster Fires,    This his Glories does deface:  The fatal News no sooner blown    In Whispers up the Chesnut Row;  The God _Sylvanus_ with a Frown,    Blasts all the Lawrels on his Brow.
