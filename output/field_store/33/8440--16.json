He paid a visit to  the library, where the secretary was engaged in making copies of Kara's  correspondence, answering letters appealing for charitable donations,  and in the hack words which fall to the secretaries of the great.    He replenished the fire, asked deferentially for any instructions and  returned again to his quest. This time he made the bedroom the scene of  his investigations. The safe he did not attempt to touch, but there  was a small bureau in which Kara would have placed his private  correspondence of the morning. This however yielded no result.    By the side of the bed on a small table was a telephone, the sight of  which apparently afforded the servant a little amusement. This was  the private 'phone which Kara had been instrumental in having fixed to  Scotland Yard--as he had explained to his servants.    \"Rum cove,\" said Fisher.    He paused for a moment before the closed door of the room and smilingly  surveyed the great steel latch which spanned the door and fitted into  an iron socket securely screwed to the framework. He lifted it  gingerly--there was a little knob for the purpose--and let it fall  gently into the socket which had been made to receive it on the door  itself.    \"Rum cove,\" he said again, and lifting the latch to the hook which held  it up, left the room, closing the door softly behind him. He walked down  the corridor, with a meditative frown, and began to descend the stairs  to the hall.    He was less than half-way down when the one maid of Kara's household  came up to meet him.    \"There's a gentleman who wants to see Mr. Kara,\" she said, \"here is his  card.\"    Fisher took the card from the salver and read, \"Mr. George Gathercole,  Junior Travellers' Club.\"    \"I'll see this gentleman,\" he said, with a sudden brisk interest.    He found the visitor standing in the hall.    He was a man who would have attracted attention, if only from the  somewhat eccentric nature of his dress and his unkempt appearance. He  was dressed in a well-worn overcoat of a somewhat pronounced check, he  had a top-hat, glossy and obviously new, at the back of his head, and  the lower part of his face was covered by a ragged beard. This he was  plucking with nervous jerks, talking to himself the while, and casting a  disparaging eye upon the portrait of Remington Kara which hung above the  marble fireplace. A pair of pince-nez sat crookedly on his nose and  two fat volumes under his arm completed the picture. Fisher, who was an  observer of some discernment, noticed under the overcoat a creased blue  suit, large black boots and a pair of pearl studs.    The newcomer glared round at the valet.    \"Take these!\" he ordered peremptorily, pointing to the books under his  arm.    Fisher hastened to obey and noted with some wonder that the visitor did  not attempt to assist him either by loosening his hold of the volumes  or raising his hand. Accidentally the valet's hand pressed against the  other's sleeve and he received a shock, for the forearm was clearly an  artificial one. It was against a wooden surface beneath the sleeve  that his knuckles struck, and this view of the stranger's infirmity was  confirmed when the other reached round with his right hand, took hold of  the gloved left hand and thrust it into the pocket of his overcoat.    \"Where is Kara?\" growled the stranger.    \"He will be back very shortly, sir,\" said the urbane Fisher.    \"Out, is he?\" boomed the visitor. \"Then I shan't wait. What the devil  does he mean by being out? He's had three years to be out!\"    \"Mr. Kara expects you, sir. He told me he would be in at six o'clock at  the latest.\"    \"Six o'clock, ye gods'.\" stormed the man impatiently. \"What dog am I  that I should wait till six?\"    He gave a savage little tug at his beard.    \"Six o'clock, eh? You will tell Mr. Kara that I called. Give me those  books.\"    \"But I assure you, sir,--\" stammered Fisher.    \"Give me those books!\" roared the other.    Deftly he lifted his left hand from the pocket, crooked the elbow by  some quick manipulation, and thrust the books, which the valet most  reluctantly handed to him, back to the place from whence he had taken  them.    \"Tell Mr. Kara I will call at my own time--do you understand, at my own  time. Good morning to you.\"    \"If you would only wait, sir,\" pleaded the agonized Fisher.    \"Wait be hanged,\" snarled the other. \"I've waited three years, I tell  you. Tell Mr. Kara to expect me when he sees me!\"    He went out and most unnecessarily banged the door behind him. Fisher  went back to the library. The girl was sealing up some letters as he  entered and looked up.    \"I am afraid, Miss Holland, I've got myself into very serious trouble.\"    \"What is that, Fisher!\" asked the girl.    \"There was a gentleman coming to see Mr. Kara, whom Mr. Kara  particularly wanted to see.\"    \"Mr. Gathercole,\" said the girl quickly.    Fisher nodded.    \"Yes, miss, I couldn't get him to stay though.\"    She pursed her lips thoughtfully.    \"Mr. Kara will be very cross, but I don't see how you can help it. I  wish you had called me.\"    \"He never gave a chance, miss,\" said Fisher, with a little smile, \"but  if he comes again I'll show him straight up to you.\"    She nodded.    \"Is there anything you want, miss?\" he asked as he stood at the door.    \"What time did Mr. Kara say he would be back?\"    \"At six o'clock, miss,\" the man replied.    \"There is rather an important letter here which has to be delivered.\"    \"Shall I ring up for a messenger?\"    \"No, I don't think that would be advisable. You had better take it  yourself.\"    Kara was in the habit of employing Fisher as a confidential messenger  when the occasion demanded such employment.    \"I will go with pleasure, miss,\" he said.    It was a heaven-sent opportunity for Fisher, who had been inventing  some excuse for leaving the house. She handed him the letter and he read  without a droop of eyelid the superscription:    \"T. X. Meredith, Esq., Special Service Dept., Scotland Yard, Whitehall.\"    He put it carefully in his pocket and went from the room to change.  Large as the house was Kara did not employ a regular staff of servants.  A maid and a valet comprised the whole of the indoor staff. His cook,  and the other domestics, necessary for conducting an establishment of  that size, were engaged by the day.    Kara had returned from the country earlier than had been anticipated,  and, save for Fisher, the only other person in the house beside the  girl, was the middle-aged domestic who was parlour-maid, serving-maid  and housekeeper in one.    Miss Holland sat at her desk to all appearance reading over the  letters she had typed that afternoon but her mind was very far from the  correspondence before her. She heard the soft thud of the front door  closing, and rising she crossed the room rapidly and looked down through  the window to the street. She watched Fisher until he was out of sight;  then she descended to the hall and to the kitchen.    It was not the first visit she had made to the big underground room with  its vaulted roof and its great ranges--which were seldom used nowadays,  for Kara gave no dinners.    The maid--who was also cook--arose up as the girl entered.    \"It's a sight for sore eyes to see you in my kitchen, miss,\" she smiled.    \"I'm afraid you're rather lonely, Mrs. Beale,\" said the girl  sympathetically.    \"Lonely, miss!\" cried the maid. \"I fairly get the creeps sitting here  hour after hour. It's that door that gives me the hump.\"    She pointed to the far end of the kitchen to a soiled looking door of  unpainted wood.    \"That's Mr. Kara's wine cellar--nobody's been in it but him. I know  he goes in sometimes because I tried a dodge that my brother--who's a  policeman--taught me. I stretched a bit of white cotton across it an' it  was broke the next morning.\"    \"Mr. Kara keeps some of his private papers in there,\" said the girl  quietly, \"he has told me so himself.\"    \"H'm,\" said the woman doubtfully, \"I wish he'd brick it up--the same  as he has the lower cellar--I get the horrors sittin' here at night  expectin' the door to open an' the ghost of the mad lord to come  out--him that was killed in Africa.\"    Miss Holland laughed.    \"I want you to go out now,\" she said, \"I have no stamps.\"    Mrs. Beale obeyed with alacrity and whilst she was assuming a hat--being  desirous of maintaining her prestige as housekeeper in the eyes of  Cadogan Square, the girl ascended to the upper floor.    Again she watched from the window the disappearing figure.    Once out of sight Miss Holland went to work with a remarkable  deliberation and thoroughness. From her bag she produced a small purse  and opened it. In that case was a new steel key. She passed swiftly down  the corridor to Kara's room and made straight for the safe.    In two seconds it was open and she was examining its contents. It was  a large safe of the usual type. There were four steel drawers fitted at  the back and at the bottom of the strong box. Two of these were unlocked  and contained nothing more interesting than accounts relating to Kara's  estate in Albania.    The top pair were locked. She was prepared for this contingency and a  second key was as efficacious as the first. An examination of the first  drawer did not produce all that she had expected. She returned the  papers to the drawer, pushed it to and locked it. She gave her attention  to the second drawer. Her hand shook a little as she pulled it open. It  was her last chance, her last hope.    There were a number of small jewel-boxes almost filling the drawer. She  took them out one by one and at the bottom she found what she had been  searching for and that which had filled her thoughts for the past three  months.    It was a square case covered in red morocco leather. She inserted her  shaking hand and took it out with a triumphant little cry.

This is simply evaporation. Thus the atmosphere is continually  carrying off moisture from the surface of the earth, until it is  saturated with it.    CAROLINE.    That is the case, no doubt, when we feel the atmosphere damp.    MRS. B.    On the contrary, when the moisture is well dissolved it occasions no  humidity: it is only when in a state of imperfect solution and floating  in the atmosphere, in the form of watery vapour, that it produces  dampness. This happens more frequently in winter than in summer; for the  lower the temperature of the atmosphere, the less water it can dissolve;  and in reality it never contains so much moisture as in a dry hot  summer's day.    CAROLINE.    You astonish me! But why, then, is the air so dry in frosty weather,  when its temperature is at the lowest?    EMILY.    This, I conjecture, proceeds not so much from the moisture being  dissolved, as from its being frozen; is not that the case?    MRS. B.    It is; and the freezing of the watery vapour which the atmospheric heat  could not dissolve, produces what is called a hoar frost; for the  particles descend in freezing, and attach themselves to whatever they  meet with on the surface of the earth.    The tendency of free caloric to an equilibrium, together with its  solvent power, are likewise connected with the phenomena of rain, of  dew, &c. When moist air of a certain temperature happens to pass through  a colder region of the atmosphere, it parts with a portion of its heat  to the surrounding air; the quantity of caloric, therefore, which served  to keep the water in a state of vapour, being diminished, the watery  particles approach each other, and form themselves into drops of water,  which being heavier than the atmosphere, descend to the earth. There are  also other circumstances, and particularly the variation in the weight  of the atmosphere, which may contribute to the formation of rain. This,  however, is an intricate subject, into which we cannot more fully enter  at present.    EMILY.    In what manner do you account for the formation of dew?    MRS. B.    Dew is a deposition of watery particles or minute drops from the  atmosphere, precipitated by the coolness of the evening.    CAROLINE.    This precipitation is owing, I suppose, to the cooling of the  atmosphere, which prevents its retaining so great a quantity of watery  vapour in solution as during the heat of the day.    MRS. B.    Such was, from time immemorial, the generally received opinion  respecting the cause of dew; but it has been very recently proved by a  course of ingenious experiments of Dr. Wells, that the deposition of dew  is produced by the cooling of the surface of the earth, which he has  shown to take place previously to the cooling of the atmosphere; for on  examining the temperature of a plot of grass just before the dew-fall,  he found that it was considerably colder than the air a few feet above  it, from which the dew was shortly after precipitated.    EMILY.    But why should the earth cool in the evening sooner than the atmosphere?    MRS. B.    Because it parts with its heat more readily than the air; the earth is  an excellent radiator of caloric, whilst the atmosphere does not possess  that property, at least in any sensible degree. Towards evening,  therefore, when the solar heat declines, and when after sunset it  entirely ceases, the earth rapidly cools by radiating heat towards the  skies; whilst the air has no means of parting with its heat but by  coming into contact with the cooled surface of the earth, to which it  communicates its caloric. Its solvent power being thus reduced, it is  unable to retain so large a portion of watery vapour, and deposits those  pearly drops which we call dew.    EMILY.    If this be the cause of dew, we need not be apprehensive of receiving  any injury from it; for it can be deposited only on surfaces that are  colder than the atmosphere, which is never the case with our bodies.    MRS. B.    Very true; yet I would not advise you for this reason to be too  confident of escaping all the ill effects which may arise from exposure  to the dew; for it may be deposited on your clothes, and chill you  afterwards by its evaporation from them. Besides, whenever the dew is  copious, there is a chill in the atmosphere which it is not always safe  to encounter.    CAROLINE.    Wind, then, must promote the deposition of dew, by bringing a more rapid  succession of particles of air in contact with the earth, just as it  promotes the cooling of the earth and warming of the atmosphere during  the heat of the day?    MRS. B.    Yes; provided the wind be unattended with clouds, for these  accumulations of moisture not only prevent the free radiation of the  earth towards the upper regions, but themselves radiate towards the  earth; under these circumstances much less dew is formed than on fine  clear nights, when the radiation of the earth passes without obstacle  through the atmosphere to the distant regions of space, whence it  receives no caloric in exchange. The dew continues to be deposited  during the night, and is generally most abundant towards morning, when  the contrast between the temperature of the earth and that of the air is  greatest. After sunrise the equilibrium of temperature between these two  bodies is gradually restored by the solar rays passing freely through  the atmosphere to the earth; and later in the morning the temperature of  the earth gains the ascendency, and gives out caloric to the air by  contact, in the same manner as it receives it from the air during the  night. --Can you tell me, now, why a bottle of wine taken fresh from the  cellar (in summer particularly), will soon be covered with dew; and even  the glasses into which the wine is poured will be moistened with a  similar vapour?    EMILY.    The bottle being colder than the surrounding air, must absorb caloric  from it; the moisture therefore which that air contained becomes  visible, and forms the dew which is deposited on the bottle.    MRS. B.    Very well, Emily. Now, Caroline, can you inform me why, in a warm room,  or close carriage, the contrary effect takes place; that is to say, that  the inside of the windows is covered with vapour?    CAROLINE.    I have heard that it proceeds from the breath of those within the room  or the carriage; and I suppose it is occasioned by the windows which,  being colder than the breath, deprive it of part of its caloric, and by  this means convert it into watery vapour.    MRS. B.    You have both explained it extremely well. Bodies attract dew in  proportion as they are good radiators of caloric, as it is this quality  which reduces their temperature below that of the atmosphere; hence we  find that little or no dew is deposited on rocks, sand, water; while  grass and living vegetables, to which it is so highly beneficial,  attract it in abundance--another remarkable instance of the wise and  bountiful dispensations of Providence.    EMILY.    And we may again observe it in the abundance of dew in summer, and in  hot climates, when its cooling effects are so much required; but I do  not understand what natural cause increases the dew in hot weather?    MRS. B.    The more caloric the earth receives during the day, the more it will  radiate afterwards, and consequently the more rapidly its temperature  will be reduced in the evening, in comparison to that of the atmosphere.  In the West-Indies especially, where the intense heat of the day is  strongly contrasted with the coolness of the evening, the dew is  prodigiously abundant. During a drought, the dew is less plentiful, as  the earth is not sufficiently supplied with moisture to be able to  saturate the atmosphere.    CAROLINE.    I have often observed, Mrs. B., that when I walk out in frosty weather,  with a veil over my face, my breath freezes upon it. Pray what is the  reason of that?    MRS. B.    It is because the cold air immediately seizes on the caloric of your  breath, and, by robbing it of its solvent, reduces it to a denser fluid,  which is the watery vapour that settles on your veil, and there it  continues parting with its caloric till it is brought down to the  temperature of the atmosphere, and assumes the form of ice.    You may, perhaps, have observed that the breath of animals, or rather  the moisture contained in it, is visible in damp weather, or during a  frost. In the former case, the atmosphere being over-saturated with  moisture, can dissolve no more. In the latter, the cold condenses it  into visible vapour; and for the same reason, the steam arising from  water that is warmer than the atmosphere, becomes visible. Have you  never taken notice of the vapour rising from your hands after having  dipped them into warm water?    CAROLINE.    Frequently, especially in frosty weather.    MRS. B.    We have already observed that pressure is an obstacle to evaporation:  there are liquids that contain so great a quantity of caloric, and whose  particles consequently adhere so slightly together, that they may be  rapidly converted into vapour without any elevation of temperature,  merely by taking off the weight of the atmosphere. In such liquids, you  perceive, it is the pressure of the atmosphere alone that connects their  particles, and keeps them in a liquid state.    CAROLINE.    I do not well understand why the particles of such fluids should be  disunited and converted into vapour, without any elevation of  temperature, in spite of the attraction of cohesion.    MRS. B.    It is because the degree of heat at which we usually observe these  fluids is sufficient to overcome their attraction of cohesion. Ether is  of this description; it will boil and be converted into vapour, at the  common temperature of the air, if the pressure of the atmosphere be"]]]
