New hay is difficult to digest, produces much  salivation (slobbering), and occasional purging and irritation of the  skin. If fed at all it should be mixed with old hay.    _Second crop, or aftermath._--This is not considered good hay for  horses, but it is prized by some farmers as good for milch cows, the  claim being made that it increases the flow of milk. The value of hay  depends upon the time of cutting, as well as care in the curing. Hay  should be cut when in full flower, but before the seeds fall; if left  longer it becomes dry, woody, and lacks in nutrition. An essential  point in making hay is that when the crop is cut it should remain in the  field as short a time as possible. If left too long in the sun it loses  color, flavor, and dries or wastes. Smith asserts that one hour more  than is necessary in the sun causes a loss of 15 to 20 per cent in the  feeding value of hay. It is impossible to state any fixed time that hay  must have to cure, this depending, of course, upon the weather,  thickness of the crop, and many other circumstances; but it is well  known that in order to preserve the color and aroma of hay it should be  turned or tedded frequently and cured as quickly as possible. On the  other hand, hay spoils in the mow if harvested too green or when not  sufficiently dried. Mow-burnt hay produces disorder of the kidneys and  bowels and causes the horse to fall off in condition.    The average horse on grain should be allowed from 10 to 12 pounds of  good hay a day. It is a mistake of many to think that horses at light  work can be kept entirely on hay. Such horses soon become potbellied,  fall off in flesh, and do not thrive. The same is true of colts; unless  the latter are fed with some grain they grow up to be long, lean, gawky  creatures, and never make so good horses as those accustomed to grain  with, or in addition to, their hay.    STRAW.--The straws are not extensively fed in this country, and when  used at all they should be cut and mixed with hay and ground or crushed  grain. Wheat, rye, and oat straw are the ones most used; of these, oat  straw is most easily digested and contains the most nourishment. Pea and  bean straw are occasionally fed to horses, the pea being preferable,  according to most writers.    CHAFF.--Wheat and rye chaff should never be used as a feed for horses.  The beards frequently become lodged in the mouth or throat and are  productive of more or less serious trouble. In the stomach and  intestines they often serve as the nucleus of the \"soft concretions,\"  which are to be described when treating of obstructions of the digestive  tract.    Oat chaff, if fed in small quantities and mixed with cut hay or corn  fodder, is very much relished by horses. It is not to be given in large  quantities, as I have repeatedly witnessed a troublesome and sometimes  fatal diarrhea following the practice of allowing horses or cattle free  access to a pile of oat chaff.    GRAINS.--Oats take precedence of all grains as a feed for horses, as the  ingredients necessary for the complete nutrition of the body exist in  them in the best proportions. Oats are, besides, more easily digested  and a larger proportion absorbed and converted into the various tissues  of the body. Care must be taken in selecting oats. According to Stewart,  the best oats are one year old, plump, short, hard, clean, bright, and  sweet. New oats are indigestible. Kiln-dried oats are to be refused, as  a rule, for even though originally good this drying process injures  them. Oats that have sprouted or fermented are injurious and should  never be fed. Oats are to be given either whole or crushed--whole in the  majority of instances; crushed to old horses and those having defective  teeth. Horses that bolt their feed are also best fed upon crushed oats  and out of a manger large enough to permit of spreading the grain in a  thin layer.    In addition to the allowance of hay above mentioned, the average horse  requires about 12 quarts of good oats daily. The best oats are those cut  about one week before they are fully ripe. Not only is the grain richer  in nutritive materials at this time, but there is also less waste from  \"scattering\" than if left to become dead ripe. Moldy oats, like hay and  straw, not only produce serious digestive disorders but have been the  undoubted cause of outbreaks of that dread disease in horses, already  referred to, characterized by inability to eat or drink, sudden  paralysis, and death.    WHEAT AND RYE.--These grains are not to be used for horses except in  small quantities, bruised or crushed, and fed mixed with other grains or  hay. If fed alone, in any considerable quantities, they are almost  certain to produce digestive disorders, laminitis (founder), and similar  troubles. They should never constitute more than one-fourth the grain  allowance, and should always be ground or crushed.    BRAN.--The bran of wheat is the one most used, and its value as a  feeding stuff is variously estimated. It is not to be depended upon if  given alone, but may be fed with other grains. It serves to keep the  bowels open. Sour bran is not to be given, for it disorders the stomach  and intestines and may even produce serious results.    MAIZE (CORN).--This grain is not suitable as an exclusive feed for young  horses, as it is deficient in salts. It is fed whole or ground. Corn on  the cob is commonly used for horses affected with \"lampas.\" If the corn  is old and is to be fed in this manner it should be soaked in pure,  clean water for 10 or 12 hours. Corn is better given ground, and fed in  quantities of from 1 to 2 quarts at a meal, mixed with crushed oats or  wheat bran. Great care should be taken in giving corn to a horse that is  not accustomed to its use. It must be commenced in small quantities and  very gradually increased. I know of no grain more liable to produce what  is called acute indigestion than corn if these directions are not  observed.    LINSEED.--Ground linseed is occasionally fed with other feeds to keep  the bowels open and to improve the condition of the skin. It is of  particular service during convalescence, when the bowels are sluggish in  their action. Linseed tea is very often given in irritable or inflamed  conditions of the digestive organs.    POTATOES.--These are used as an article of feed for the horse in many  sections. If fed raw and in large quantities they often produce  indigestion. Their digestibility is increased by steaming or boiling.  They possess, in common with other roots, slight laxative properties.    BEETS.--These are not much used as feed for horses.    CARROTS.--These make a most excellent feed, particularly during  sickness. They improve the appetite and slightly increase the action of  the bowels and kidneys. They possess also certain alterative properties,  making the coat smooth and glossy. Some veterinary writers assert that  chronic cough is cured by giving carrots for some time. The roots may be  considered, then, as an adjunct to the regular regimen, and if fed in  small quantities are highly beneficial.    GRASSES.--Grass is the natural food of horses. It is composed of a great  variety of plants, differing widely as to the amount of nourishment  contained, some being almost entirely without value and only eaten when  nothing else is obtainable, while others are positively injurious, or  even poisonous. None of the grasses are sufficient to keep the horse in  condition for work. Horses thus fed are \"soft,\" sweat easily, purge, and  soon tire on the road or when at hard work. Grass is indispensable to  growing stock, and there is little or no doubt that it acts as an  alterative when given to horses accustomed to grain and hay. It must be  given to such horses in small quantities at first. The stomach and  intestines undergo rest, and recuperate if the horse is turned to grass  for a time each year. It is also certain that during febrile diseases  grass acts almost as a medicine, lessening the fever and favoring  recovery. Wounds heal more rapidly than when the horse is on grain, and  some chronic disorders (chronic cough, for instance) disappear entirely  when at grass. In my experience, grass does more good when the horse  crops it himself. This may be due to the sense of freedom he enjoys at  pasture, to the rest to his feet and limbs, and for many other similar  reasons. When cut for him it should be fed fresh or when but slightly  wilted.    SILAGE.--Regarding silage as a feed for horses, Rommel in Farmers'  Bulletin 578 writes as follows:         Silage has not been generally fed to horses, partly on account       of a certain amount of danger which attends its use for this       purpose, but still more, perhaps, on account of prejudice. In       many cases horses have been killed by eating moldy silage, and       the careless person who fed it at once blamed the silage       itself, rather than his own carelessness and the mold which       really was the cause of the trouble. Horses are peculiarly       susceptible to the effects of molds, and under certain       conditions certain molds grow on silage which are deadly       poisons to both horses and mules. Molds must have air to grow,       and therefore silage which is packed air-tight and fed out       rapidly will not become moldy. If the feeder watches the silage       carefully as the weather warms up he can soon detect the       presence of mold. When mold appears, feeding to horses or mules       should stop immediately.         It is also unsafe to feed horses frozen silage on account of       the danger of colic. * * *         To summarize, silage is safe to feed to horses and mules only       when it is made from fairly mature corn, properly stored in the       silo. When it is properly stored and is not allowed to mold, no       feed exceeds it as a cheap"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23475"],[0,"The Works of Lord Byron.

But----                      [_He pauses_.        _Myr._                           What instead?        _Sar._ In thy own chair--thy own place in the banquet--      I sought thy sweet face in the circle--but      Instead--a grey-haired, withered, bloody-eyed,      And bloody-handed, ghastly, ghostly thing,      Female in garb, and crowned upon the brow,      Furrowed with years, yet sneering with the passion      Of vengeance, leering too with that of lust,      Sate:--my veins curdled.[24]        _Myr._                Is this all?        _Sar._                              Upon      Her right hand--her lank, bird-like, right hand--stood             110      A goblet, bubbling o'er with blood; and on      Her left, another, filled with--what I saw not,      But turned from it and her. But all along      The table sate a range of crowned wretches,      Of various aspects, but of one expression.        _Myr._ And felt you not this a mere vision?        _Sar._                                        No:      It was so palpable, I could have touched them.      I turned from one face to another, in      The hope to find at last one which I knew      Ere I saw theirs: but no--all turned upon me,                      120      And stared, but neither ate nor drank, but stared,      Till I grew stone, as they seemed half to be,      Yet breathing stone, for I felt life in them,      And life in me: there was a horrid kind      Of sympathy between us, as if they      Had lost a part of death to come to me,      And I the half of life to sit by them.      We were in an existence all apart      From heaven or earth----And rather let me see      Death all than such a being!        _Myr._                       And the end?                          130        _Sar._ At last I sate, marble, as they, when rose      The Hunter and the Crone; and smiling on me--      Yes, the enlarged but noble aspect of      The Hunter smiled upon me--I should say,      His lips, for his eyes moved not--and the woman's      Thin lips relaxed to something like a smile.      Both rose, and the crowned figures on each hand      Rose also, as if aping their chief shades--      Mere mimics even in death--but I sate still:      A desperate courage crept through every limb,                      140      And at the last I feared them not, but laughed      Full in their phantom faces. But then--then      The Hunter laid his hand on mine: I took it,      And grasped it--but it melted from my own;      While he too vanished, and left nothing but      The memory of a hero, for he looked so.        _Myr._ And was: the ancestor of heroes, too,      And thine no less.        _Sar._             Aye, Myrrha, but the woman,      The female who remained, she flew upon me,      And burnt my lips up with her noisome kisses;                      150      And, flinging down the goblets on each hand,      Methought their poisons flowed around us, till      Each formed a hideous river. Still she clung;      The other phantoms, like a row of statues,      Stood dull as in our temples, but she still      Embraced me, while I shrunk from her, as if,      In lieu of her remote descendant, I      Had been the son who slew her for her incest.[25]      Then--then--a chaos of all loathsome things      Thronged thick and shapeless: I was dead, yet feeling--            160      Buried, and raised again--consumed by worms,      Purged by the flames, and withered in the air!      I can fix nothing further of my thoughts,      Save that I longed for thee, and sought for thee,      In all these agonies,--and woke and found thee.        _Myr._ So shalt thou find me ever at thy side,      Here and hereafter, if the last may be.      But think not of these things--the mere creations      Of late events, acting upon a frame      Unused by toil, yet over-wrought by toil--                         170      Such as might try the sternest.        _Sar._                          I am better.      Now that I see thee once more, _what was seen_      Seems nothing.                                _Enter_ SALEMENES.        _Sal._             Is the king so soon awake?        _Sar._ Yes, brother, and I would I had not slept;      For all the predecessors of our line      Rose up, methought, to drag me down to them.      My father was amongst them, too; but he,      I know not why, kept from me, leaving me      Between the hunter-founder of our race,      And her, the homicide and husband-killer,                          180      Whom you call glorious.        _Sal._                  So I term you also,      Now you have shown a spirit like to hers.      By day-break I propose that we set forth,      And charge once more the rebel crew, who still      Keep gathering head, repulsed, but not quite quelled.        _Sar._ How wears the night?        _Sal._                     There yet remain some hours      Of darkness: use them for your further rest.        _Sar._ No, not to-night, if 'tis not gone: methought      I passed hours in that vision.        _Myr._                         Scarcely one;      I watched by you: it was a heavy hour,                             190      But an hour only.        _Sar._             Let us then hold council;      To-morrow we set forth.        _Sal._                 But ere that time,      I had a grace to seek.        _Sar._                'Tis granted.        _Sal._                             Hear it      Ere you reply too readily; and 'tis      For _your_ ear only.        _Myr._              Prince, I take my leave.
