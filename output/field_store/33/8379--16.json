This position, if I state it correctly, is  startling. Are we to impeach the President for what he may do in  the future? Do our fears constitute in the President high crimes and  misdemeanors? Are we to wander beyond the record of this case and found  our judgment on the possibilities of the future? This would lead us  beyond the conscience of this House.    Sir, we must be guided by some rule in this grave proceeding--something  more certain than an impossibility to arraign the President for a  specific crime--and when the gentleman from Massachusetts, in commenting  on one of the alleged offenses of the President, that we could not  arraign him for the specific crime, he disclosed the weakness of the  case we are now considering. If we cannot arraign the President for a  specific crime, for what are we to proceed against him? For a bundle of  generalities such as we have in the volume of testimony reported by the  committee to the House in this case? If we cannot state upon paper a  specific crime, how are we to carry this case to the Senate for trial?    At the close of his speech, Mr. Wilson moved to lay the subject of  impeachment on the table, and the yeas and nays were ordered.    Several motions were then made--to adjourn, to adjourn to a day certain,  etc.--which with roll calls practically consumed the day, and the motion  of Mr. Wilson went over.    The next day, Dec. 7th, the question again came up in its order, and  after several unsuccessful attempts to procure a vote on Mr. Wilson's  motion to lay the Impeachment Resolution on the table, Mr. Wilson, by  agreement, withdrew his motion, and called for the yeas and nays on the  adoption of the resolution:    That Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, be impeached for  high crimes and misdemeanors.    The yeas and nays were ordered, and the vote was yeas 57, nays 108.    So the resolution to impeach the President was rejected by the very  emphatic vote of 67 to 108--nearly two to one--and by a House two-thirds  Republican.    So ended the first effort to impeach the President--the first formal  action to that end having been taken on January 7, 1867, and the final  vote at the close, and its abandonment, December 7, 1867.    For eleven months the overwhelming Republican majority of the House had  been vigorously active in its search for evidence of criminality on the  part of the President that would warrant the basing of an impeachment.  No effort was left untried--no resource that promised a possible hope of  successful exploitation was neglected. Republican partisans were set to  the work of sleuth-hounds in the search for testimony in maintenance of  the charges preferred, and an ever ready partisan press teemed from the  beginning to the end of that time with animadversions upon Mr. Johnson's  administration and denunciation of his alleged desertion of Mr.  Lincoln's plan of restoration, of treachery to the party that had  elected him, and a demand for his impeachment.    To be lukewarm in that controversy, or even to fail to join in the  popular denunciation of Mr. Johnson was to put one's self at once under  suspicion with the great mass of the dominant party, and without the  pale of its consideration.    For eleven months the country was kept in the throes of partisan  turmoil--and for what? Simply to depose a President who had disappointed  the partisan and personal expectations and schemes of a rule or ruin  faction which was able, under the peculiar conditions of the time, to  subordinate to its purposes a large proportion of the dominant party of  that day.    The following are the material portions of the testimony taken by the  House Committee on the Judiciary under authority of the resolutions  passed by the House of Representatives on March 7, 1867, for the  impeachment of Andrew Johnson.    Eighty-nine witnesses were summoned before the committee. All of them  were rigidly examined, and several of them were called and examined the  second and third times. Their testimony fills more than twelve hundred  octavo pages of print.    The first witness was Gen. L. C. Baker, of the War Department. His  testimony related principally to a certain letter alleged to have been  written by Mr. Johnson, in 1864.    The first question propounded to him by Mr. Ashley, was as follows:    I wish you to state to the committee the contents, as nearly as you  can, of a letter which you have in your possession, written by Andrew  Johnson, some time in the early part of 1864, to a Southern man, giving  information as to the troops about the Capitol and elsewhere, and advice  to Jefferson Davis. State where that letter is, and give the contents as  nearly as you can, the history of it.    Mr. Baker answered that he knew there was a letter of that kind,  purporting to have been written by Andrew Johnson, when he was acting  Governor of Tennessee. That the letter was dated at Nashville and  directed to Jefferson Davis, and related to some declared policy that  had been adopted by the Confederacy--that the letter was being used to  secure an appointment--that reference was made to troops, but nothing  about localities where stationed, or numbers, and nothing about shipment  of armor, and that the letter was stolen from Andrew Johnson's table and  never sent.    The question was then asked of the witness by Mr. Ashley:    State whether the whole import of the letter written by Mr. Johnson,  was not to turn the whole power which he possessed in Tennessee, in a  certain contingency, over to the rebel cause?    Answer--No. I did not have that opinion of the letter exactly. From what  I recollect of it, the thing was that he was making a proposition making  suggestions as to what their policy should be.    Ques.--And if they accepted it?    Ans.--If they accepted it, my impression was that he was going with  them.    Ques.--With the rebels?    Ans.--Yes sir.    Question by the Chairman.--If there are any other letters that you have  seen of Mr. Johnson's written by him to any person connected with the  Confederate Government, or proposing to change the Administration of the  Government in their favor after he became President, or anything of a  public nature affecting the interests of the United States, please state  it and state all you know about such letters.    Ans.--I do not know of any letters of that character--or of any other  letters.    This constituted the substance of Gen. Baker's testimony. His  examination was very lengthy, embracing more of this character of  testimony, and about pardon brokerage, and other alleged corrupt  practices--all evidencing a determination and expectation to fix upon  Mr. Johnson a disposition to disloyalty and corruption, both before  and after his succession to the Presidency, but no such testimony was  obtained.    A considerable portion of the investigation was devoted to Mr. Johnson's  business and personal affairs, such as could have no possible connection  with or indicate implication in corrupt or disloyal practices of any  sort.    A strenuous effort appears to have been made by the Committee throughout  a long and searching examination of witnesses, and constitutes a  conspicuous feature of that investigation, to establish the charges  of corruption and disloyalty in the sale of public property, railways,  etc., that had been constructed and equipped, or seized and operated, by  the Government in connection with its military operations in the South.  Such an accusation had been made with great pertinacity by Mr. Johnson's  opponents, and was also then believed by a great many people to be true.    Among the parties examined by the committee, were Mr. James and Mr.  Burns, of Nashville, Tenn., and Senator Fowler, of that State, and  also the Secretary of war, Mr. Stanton. No facts whatever were elicited  showing a privity to corruption in these matters on the part of Mr.  Johnson.    The information obtained from Mr. Stanton, however, put an effectual  estoppel to further investigation of the charge of corrupt or disloyal  disposal of public property by the President. The following are extracts  from Mr. Stanton's testimony, as given on February 11, 1867:    Shortly after the surrender of the rebel armies, the attention of the  War Department was directed to the proper disposition to be made of the  railroads and railroad stock throughout the rebel States which came into  our possession, either by capture or construction. It was the subject of  a good deal of consultation and conference between the Secretary of War  and the Quartermaster General. It was the opinion of the Secretary  of War that it was wholly impracticable for the General Government to  operate these roads under any system, and that it would be greatly to  the advantage of the country to make such disposition as would allow  them, its speedily as possible, to become what they were designed for  channels of commerce and trade between the States, and that any terms on  which that could be done would be advantageous. This was especially the  case in regard to the Western and Southwestern roads, where it was said  there were large amounts of cotton that would be available to remove  North, in exchange for supplies to go South, of which it was said they  were greatly in want.    Ques.--In case of the construction of a railroad by the Government,  the Government furnishing the material and the labor, what has been the  custom of the Department in surrendering such roads to the companies  claiming them?    Ans.--In all instances, I think such roads have been surrendered in  the same manner as if they had been constructed by the companies. That  subject was talked of a good deal in conference between myself and the  Quartermaster General."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2443"],[0,"The Story of the Mormons, from the Date of Their Origin to the Year 1901 (#15)"],[1,"this list, the Lord made one of the greatest  mistakes into which he ever fell in using Joe as a mouthpiece. Mrs.  Harris's Quaker belief had led her from the start to protest against the  Bible scheme, and to warn her husband against the Smith family, and she  vigorously opposed his investment of any money in the publication of  the book. On the occasion of his first visit to Joe in Pennsylvania,  according to Mother Smith, Mrs. Harris was determined to accompany him,  and he had to depart without her knowledge; and when he went the second  time, she did accompany him, and she ransacked the house to find the  \"record\" (as the plates are often called in the Smiths' writings).    When Harris returned home with the translated pages which Joe intrusted  to him (in July, 1828), he showed them to his family and to others, who  tried in vain to convince him that he was a dupe. Mrs. Harris decided on  a more practical course. Getting possession of the papers, where Harris  had deposited them for safe keeping, she refused to restore them to him.  What eventually became of them is uncertain, one report being that she  afterward burned them.    This should have caused nothing more serious in the way of delay  than the time required to retranslate these pages; for certainly a  well-equipped Divinity, who was revealing a new Bible to mankind, and  supplying so powerful a means of translation as the Urim and Thummim,  could empower the translator to repeat the words first written. Indeed,  the descriptions of the method of translation given afterward by Smith's  confederates would seem to prove that there could have been but one  version of any translation of the plates, no matter how many times  repeated. Thus, Harris described the translating as follows:--    \"By aid of the seer stone [no mention of the magic spectacles] sentences  would appear and were read by the prophet and written by Martin, and,  when finished, he would say 'written'; and if correctly written, that  sentence would disappear, and another appear in its place; but if not  written correctly, it remained until corrected, so that the translation  was just as it was engraven on the plates, precisely in the language  then used.\"*         * Elder Edward Stevenson in the Deseret News (quoted in Reynold's  \"Mystery of the Manuscript Fund,\" p. 91).    David Whitmer, in an account of this process written in his later years,  said:--    \"Joseph would put the seer stone into a hat [more testimony against the  use of the spectacles] and put his face in the hat, drawing it closely  around his face to exclude the light; and in the darkness the spiritual  light would shine. A piece of something resembling parchment would  appear, and on that appeared the writing. One character at a time would  appear, and under it was the translation in English. Brother Joseph  would read off the English to O. Cowdery, who was his principal scribe,  and when it was written down and repeated to brother Joseph to see if  it were correct, then it would disappear and another character with the  interpretation would appear.\"*         * \"Address to Believers in the Book of Mormon.\"      But to Joseph the matter of reproducing the lost pages of the  translation did not seem simple. When Harris's return to Pennsylvania  was delayed, Joe became anxious and went to Palmyra to learn what  delayed him, and there he heard of Mrs. Harris's theft of the pages. His  mother reports him as saying in announcing it, \"my God, all is lost! all  is lost!\" Why the situation was as serious to a sham translator as it  would have been simple to an honest one is easily understood. Whenever  Smith offered a second translation of the missing pages which differed  from the first, a comparison of them with the latter would furnish proof  positive of the fraudulent character of his pretensions.    All the partners in the business had to share in the punishment for what  had occurred. The Smiths lost all faith in Harris. Joe says that Harris  broke his pledge about showing the translation only to five persons,  and Mother Smith says that because of this offence \"a dense fog spread  itself over his fields and blighted his wheat.\" When Joe returned to  Pennsylvania an angel appeared to him, his mother says, and ordered him  to give up the Urim and Thummim, promising, however, to restore them  if he was humble and penitent, and \"if so, it will be on the 22d of  September.\"* Here may be noted one of those failures of mother and son  to agree in their narratives which was excuse enough for Brigham Young  to try to suppress the mother's book. Joe mentions a \"revelation\" dated  July, 1828 (Sec. 3, \"Doctrine and Covenants\"), in which Harris was  called \"a wicked man,\" and which told Smith that he had lost his  privileges for a season, and he adds, \"After I had obtained the above  revelation, both the plates and the Urim and Thummim were taken from me  again, BUT IN A FEW DAYS they were returned to me.\"**         * \"Biographical Sketches,\" by Lucy Smith, p. 125.         ** Millennial Star, Vol. XIV, p. 8.      For some ten months after this the work of translation was discontinued,  although Mother Smith says that when she and his father visited the  prophet in Pennsylvania two months after his return, the first thing  they saw was \"a red morocco trunk lying on Emma's bureau which, Joseph  shortly informed me, contained the Urim and Thummim and the plates.\"  Mrs. Harris's act had evidently thrown the whole machinery of  translation out of gear, and Joe had to await instructions from his  human adviser before a plan of procedure could be announced. During this  period (in which Joe says he worked on his father's farm), says Tucker,  \"the stranger [supposed to be Rigdon] had again been at Smith's, and the  prophet had been away from home, maybe to repay the former's visits.\"*         * \"Origin, Rise, and Progress of Mormonism,\" p. 48.      Two matters were decided on in these consultations, viz., that no  attempt would be made to retranslate the lost pages, and that a second  copy of all the rest of the manuscript should be prepared, to guard  against a similar perplexity in case of the loss of later pages. The  proof of the latter statement I find in the fact that a second copy did  exist. Ebenezer Robinson, who was a leading man in the church from  the time of its establishment in Ohio until Smith's death, says in his  recollections that, when the people assembled on October 2, 1841, to lay  the corner-stone of Nauvoo House, Smith said he had a document to  put into the corner-stone, and Robinson went with him to his house to  procure it. Robinson's story proceeds as follows:--    \"He got a manuscript copy of the Book of Mormon, and brought it into the  room where we were standing, and said, 'I will examine to see if it is  all here'; and as he did so I stood near him, at his left side, and saw  distinctly the writing as he turned up the pages until he hastily went  through the book and satisfied himself that it was all there, when he  said, 'I have had trouble enough with this thing'; which remark struck  me with amazement, as I looked upon it as a sacred treasure.\"    Robinson says that the manuscript was written on foolscap paper and most  of it in Oliver Cowdery's handwriting. He explains that two copies were  necessary, \"as the printer who printed the first edition of the book had  to have a copy, as they would not put the original copy into his hands  for fear of its being altered. This accounts for David Whitmer having a  copy and Joseph Smith having one.\"*         * The Return, Vol. II, p. 314. Ebenezer Robinson, a printer,  joined the Mormons at Kirtland, followed Smith to Missouri, and went  with the flock to Nauvoo, where he and the prophet's brother, Don  Carlos, established the Times and Seasons. When the doctrine of polygamy  was announced to him and his wife, they rejected it, and he followed  Rigdon to Pennsylvania when Rigdon was turned out by Young. In later  years he was engaged in business enterprises in Iowa, and was a resident  of Davis City when David Whitmer announced the organization of  his church in Missouri, and, not accepting the view of the prophet  entertained by his descendants in the Reorganized Church, Robinson  accepted baptism from Whitmer. The Return was started by him in  January, 1889, and continued until his death, in its second year. His  reminiscences of early Mormon experiences, which were a feature of the  publication, are of value.    Major Bideman, who married the prophet's widow, partly completed and  occupied Nauvoo House after the departure of the Mormons for Utah, and  some years later he took out the cornerstone and opened it, but found  the manuscript so ruined by moisture that only a little was legible.    In regard to the missing pages, it was decided to announce a revelation,  which is dated May, 1829 (Sec. 10, \"Doctrine and Covenants\"), stating  that the lost pages had got into the hands of wicked men, that \"Satan  has put it into their hearts to alter the words which you have caused to  be written, or which you have translated,\" in accordance with a plan  of the devil to destroy Smith's work. He was directed therefore to  translate from the plates of Nephi, which contained a \"more particular  account\" than the Book of Lehi from which the original translation was  made.    When Smith began translating again, Harris was not reemployed, but Emma,  the prophet's wife, acted as his scribe until April 15, 1829, when a new  personage appeared upon the scene. This was Oliver Cowdery.    Cowdery was a blacksmith by trade, but gave up that occupation, and,  while Joe was translating in Pennsylvania, secured the place of teacher  in the district where the Smiths lived, and boarded with them. They told  him of the new Bible, and, according to Joe's later account, Cowdery  for himself received a revelation of its divine character, went to  Pennsylvania, and from that time was"]]]
