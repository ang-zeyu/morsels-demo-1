I tried to make up my mind to die calmly, to  resign myself to the inevitable; but my period of liberty and my new-  found strength had brought back the old love of life that had burned  strong in me before my captivity, and my whole being cried out  passionately against this awful end.    Still there was silence, silence for a seeming eternity of waiting for  the sharp sting of death . . . and then another voice lifted as though  in invocation. Solemn, loud, clear and sonorous, the measured accents  rang forth, from close beside me; a voice of unearthly beauty chanting  a rhythmic sentence or two, repeated again and again. No hoarse voice  of a man this, but of a woman . . . a priestess . . . calling down the  fires of Baal to consume the sacrifice.    And, as if in response, came now the peal of heavy thunder.    I had been in terror of the knife before, but had lain silent and with  closed eyes awaiting the end, but as the terrible significance of the  song of invocation reached me, a hoarse cry of horror broke from my  parched throat, and I again tried in vain to struggle free. For now my  staring eyes confirmed the terrible thought that had come to me. The  sun would soon be exactly overhead, and when it was, its rays would  strike exactly through the huge diamond that crowned the Snake, and the  intolerable rays, thus concentrated as though by a mighty burning  glass, would fall full upon my eyes, torturing and searing me to the  semblance of what I had seen on the dead priest.    Screaming and writhing in an agony of apprehension, I lay helpless,  whilst the sun sped on, until its rim had almost reached the diamond.  But now came peal after peal of terrific thunder, and vivid lightning  that made even the sun look pale, and speeding across my field of  vision came also a huge black cloud thick and ominous, but to me a most  blessed sight a messenger of mercy a miracle! Swiftly it sped, but  would it be in time?    The sun had reached the diamond now, and shrink as I would I already  felt the roasting heat that beat upon the stone but a few inches from  my head. Surely it would reach me, my brain would crack . . . but now,  thank God! . . . the cloud had swept across, and for the moment I was  safe, at least from this terror.    And now, with the almost incessant roar of thunder came the rain a few  huge, stinging drops at first then a downpour such as I had never seen.  In incessant sheets it fell like a huge cataract, beating upon my  helpless face till I gasped for breath, as one half drowned; and soon  the roar of water falling upon water almost drowned the pealing  thunder. The shouts of joy that had hailed the first few drops were  soon changed to wild cries of alarm, and as still the deluge continued  as though the very flood-gates of heaven were opened, the screams of  the vast multitude joined the roar of water and the pealing of thunder  in one stupendous chorus. I could not see, but I could hear and realize  that an awful struggle was going on below me: there in that vast hollow  the unseen people would be trapped beyond hope, for into it the water  from the plains above would rush in one vast cataract. And still the  torrent beat down and the thunder pealed; and I, half mad with my  sufferings, yelled and shouted, in mockery of the screams of those who  would have immolated me, and who were now themselves perishing all  around me. At length the groans and screams of the dying multitude died  down to choking gasps, then even these ceased, but still the thunder  pealed, and the rain beat down upon my unprotected body till my  overwrought senses rebelled, and I sank into a swoon.    A voice the voice that I had heard in invocation came to me in my  disordered dreams calling me back. Its insistence troubled me, for I  was unwilling to return. But again and again it called, and I at length  came back reluctantly to reality.    \"Fear not, thy life is thine own again,\" said the grave, vibrant  accents in my ear, and I opened my eyes to find myself still lying upon  the altar.    Gazing down upon me was a face that I shall never forget to my dying  day the face of a woman, whose skin of ivory whiteness accentuated the  unfathomable blackness of the most wonderful eyes I shall ever behold.    They seemed to pierce me through and through, and to search my very  soul, as I lay there and gazed back into them as a fascinated bird  gazes back into the eyes of the striking snake.    Power infinite there was in those commanding orbs, wisdom and knowledge  surpassing that of mere mankind infinite good or infinite evil I know  not which!    I shrank in mortal terror at their merciless scrutiny, but I could  neither close my eyes nor tear them away, until a hand was passed  across my brow, and the spell was broken.    Now a knife cut my bonds, and I was raised by a strong arm to a sitting  posture.    How is it possible to describe the horror of the appalling scene that  met my shrinking eyes, as for the first time since I had been a  prisoner I was able to look upon my surroundings.    The blood-red sun was setting in a stormy sky, from which in the  distance the lightning still flickered, close beside me stood the tall  form of the priestess, and below, on the lower tiers of the pyramid,  were grouped about twenty men priests I judged them to be all robed in  white garments, all white men, of fierce and sinister aspect.    But it was not upon these that my eyes rested, but upon the grim and  awful holocaust that stretched in all directions below and beyond.    For the pyramid stood as an island in a sea of dead men: from its base,  to the mighty walls that encircled the vast floor of the crater, it  stretched in an unbroken sheet unbroken, that is, except for the myriad  drowned bodies from which the rapidly receding flood was fast draining  away.    The glare from the crimson sunset turned it into a sea of blood, and  each moment the forms of the drowned multitude showed more and more  distinctly; clasping and clinging to each other in the awful  contortions of death, as they had struggled with each other in their  frantic fight against that awful cataclysm; heap upon heap, line after  line, thousands upon thousands of them a multitude a whole nation  overwhelmed and destroyed.    Not white men such as the priests, who alone had been saved upon the  pyramid, but brown men of Inyati's type, their bodies nude except for a  loincloth.    Stunned and dismayed at the fearful sight, I sat inert upon the altar,  and gazed upon the mighty hecatomb in utter forgetfulness of my own  awful position, till the priestess, who had awakened me, and who also  had stood in silent contemplation, turned and once more fixed her  glowing eyes upon me.    \"Look well, O stranger, look well upon these thy dead,\" she said in a  clear, ringing voice; \"upon these who would have sacrificed thee yet  who, dying, called upon thee, their bound sacrifice, to save them!  'Save us, Mighty One!' they supplicated, 'thou who art mightier than  the Snake save us!' . . . Poor fools they are dead all, all, are dead.  . . . And thou, thou helpless 'Mighty One'\" she mocked, \"art thou  content with this thy vengeance, or must we poor servants of the Snake  also die to appease thy wrath?\"    The look and tone of fierce mockery brought back to me all the fear of  hideous torture I had felt before, and I begged that they should  mercifully kill me and have done.    \"Nay,\" she replied, \"fear not that shall not be I have told thee thy  life is safe. Well do I know that thou art but a man, and no god, such  as these poor fools thought thee at the last but the Snake hath spared  thee, and thy life is sacred. Free shalt thou go, free and with an  abundance of the bright stones these dead people deemed sacred and the  lust of which brought thee, O stranger, unasked and unwelcome to this  our land. Life shall be thine and thou shalt be guided back to the land  from whence thou earnest; but thou shalt eat first of the fruit of  forgetfulness, and never shalt thou find again the path by which thou  earnest hither, or that other by which thou shalt return.\"    The solemn tone and promise allayed my fears somewhat; at least my life  was to be spared; but this talk of not finding the path again did it  mean that they would blind me?    Even as the thought entered my mind the mysterious being who held me in  her power answered it as though I had spoken it aloud.    \"Fear not, I say again,\" said she, \"neither thine eyes, nor a hair of  thy head shall be injured. Rather do I grant thee a precious boon, such  as many crave for in vain the boon of forgetfulness . . . yet not of  all! Stand upon thy feet, O stranger, and look well upon this lake of  the dead, then turn and look upon me these things thou shalt not  forget.\"    Weak and shaken by my awful experience, I tottered as I tried to stand  upright, and but for her supporting hand I should have fallen. \"Aye  thou art weak,\" said she again, \"but that which I will give will bring  back the strength to thy palsied limbs. . . . Look well, I say, and  forget not this!\"    Forget! How could I ever forget that awful scene the blood-red water,  the countless heaps of drowned men, the upturned faces of the pale  priests below me, their dark eyes fixed upon me with looks of hatred  and malevolence.    \"Aye, they would torture and sacrifice thee,\" said the strange being  who dominated them, and who held my life in her hands, and who again  answered my unspoken thought, \"but that may not be. . . . And now look  thou on me and forget not.\"    She stood proudly erect, her brow bound by a bronze snake the miniature  of the idol above, the diamond set in this strange coronet outdone in  splendor by the fires of her wondrous eyes.

There is a remarkable      tendency, in breeding, for both good qualities and bad to      disappear for one or two generations, and to reappear in the      second and third; thus an animal often resembles the grand dam      more than the dam. This peculiarity is itself an objection to      the practice of crossing, as it tends to prevent uniformity and      to encourage contrarieties; and thus we find in many flocks and      herds that the hopes of the breeders have been entirely baffled      and a race of mongrels established.        The first cross is generally successful--a tolerable degree of      uniformity is produced, resembling in external conformation the      sire, which is usually of a superior breed; and thus the      offspring are superior to the dams. These cross-bred animals are      now paired amongst each other, and what is the consequence?      Uniformity at once disappears; some of the offspring resemble      the grandsire, and others the grandams, and some possess the      disposition and constitution of the one and some of the other;      and consequently a race of mongrels is perpetuated. If, however,      the cross is really a good and desirable one, then, by means of      rigorous and continued selection, pursued for several      generations, that is, by casting aside, as regards breeding      purposes, every animal that does not exhibit uniformity, or      possess the qualifications we are desirous of perpetuating, a      valuable breed of animals may in the course of time be      established. By this system many varieties of sheep have been so      far improved as to become almost new breeds; as for instance the      New Oxford Downs which have frequently gained prizes at the      great Agricultural Meetings as being the best long wooled sheep.        To cross, however, merely for crossing sake--to do so without      that care and vigilance which we have deemed so essential--is a      practice which cannot be too much condemned. It is in fact a      national evil and a sin against society, that is, if carried      beyond the first cross, or if the cross-bred animals are used      for breeding. A useful breed of animals may thus be lost, and a      generation of mongrels established in their place, a result      which has followed in numerous instances amongst every breed of      animals.        The principal use of crossing, however, is to raise animals for      the butcher. In this respect it has not (with sheep) been      adopted to the extent which it might to advantage. The male      being generally an animal of a superior breed and of a vigorous      nature, almost invariably stamps his external form, size and      muscular development on the offspring, which thus bear a strong      resemblance to him, whilst their internal nature derived from      the dam, well adapts them to the locality, as well as to the      treatment to which their dams have been accustomed.        With regard to cattle, the system cannot be so advantageously      pursued (except for the purpose of improving the size and      qualities of the calf, where veal is the object) in as much as      every required qualification for breeding purposes can be      obtained by using animals of the pure breeds. But with sheep,      where the peculiarities of the soil as regards the goodness of      feed, and exposure to the severities of the weather, often      prevent the introduction of an improved breed, the value of      using a new and superior ram is often very considerable, and the      weight of mutton is materially increased, without its quality      being impaired, while earlier maturity is at the same time      obtained. It involves, however, more systematic attention than      farmers usually like to bestow, for it is necessary to employ a      different ram for each purpose; that is, a native ram for a      portion of the ewes to keep up the purity of the breed, and a      foreign ram to raise the improved cross-bred animals for fatting      either as lambs or sheep. This plan is adopted by many breeders      of Leicester sheep, who thus employ South Down rams to improve      the quality of the mutton. One inconvenience attending this      plan, is the necessity of fatting the maiden ewes as well as the      wethers; they may however be disposed of as fat lambs, or the      practice of spaying might be adopted, so as to increase the      fatting disposition of the animal. Crossing, therefore, should      be adopted with the greatest caution and skill where the object      is to improve the breed of animals; it should never be practiced      carelessly or capriciously, but it may be advantageously pursued      with a view to raising superior and profitable animals for the      butcher.\"    In another paper on this subject, after presenting many interesting  details regarding British breeds of sheep and the results of crossing,  Mr. Spooner says:        \"We cannot do better, in concluding our paper, than gather up      and arrange in a collected form, the various points of our      subject, which appear to be of sufficient importance to be again      presented to the attention of our readers. We think, therefore,      we are justified in coming to the conclusions:        1st. That there is a direct pecuniary advantage in judicious      cross-breeding; that increased size, disposition to fatten, and      early maturity, are thereby induced.        2d. That while this may be caused for the most part, by the very      fact of crossing, yet it is principally due to the superior      influence of the male over the size and external appearance of      the offspring; so that it is desirable, for the purpose of the      butcher, that the male should be of a larger frame than the      female, and should excel in those peculiarities we are desirous      of reproducing. Let it be here however, repeated, as an      exceptional truth, that though as a rule the male parent      influences mostly the size and external form, and the female      parent the constitution, general health and vital powers, yet      that the opposite result sometimes takes place.        3d. Certain peculiarities may be imparted to a breed by a single      cross. Thus, the ponies of the New Forest exhibit      characteristics of blood, although it is many years since that a      thorough-bred horse was turned into the forest for the purpose.      So, likewise, we observe in the Hampshire sheep the Roman nose      and large heads, which formed so strong a feature in their      maternal ancestors, although successive crosses of the South      Down were employed to change the character of the breed. * * *        4th. Although in the crossing of sheep for the purpose of the      butcher, it is generally advisable to use males of a larger      breed, provided they possess a disposition to fatten; yet, in      such cases, it is of importance that the _pelvis_ of the female      should be wide and capacious, so that no injury should arise in      lambing, in consequence of the increased size of the heads of      the lambs. The shape of the ram's head should be studied for the      same reason. In crossing, however, for the purpose of      establishing a new breed, the size of the male must give way to      other more important considerations; although it will still be      desirable to use a large female of the breed which we seek to      improve. Thus the South Downs have vastly improved the larger      Hampshires, and the Leicester the huge Lincolns and the      Cotswolds.        5th. Although the benefits are most evident in the first cross,      after which, from pairing the cross-bred animals, the defects of      one breed or the other, or the incongruities of both, are      perpetually breaking out--yet, unless the characteristics and      conformation of the two breeds are altogether averse to each      other, nature opposes no barrier to their successful admixture;      so that in the course of time, by the aid of selection and      careful weeding, it is practicable to establish a new breed      altogether. This, in fact, has been the history of our principal      breeds. * * *        We confess that we cannot entirely admit either of the      antagonistic doctrines held by the rival advocates of crossing      and pure breeding. The public have reason to be grateful to the      exertions of either party; and still more have they respectively      reason to be grateful to each other. * * * *        Let us conclude by repeating the advice that, when equal      advantages can be attained by keeping a pure breed of sheep,      such pure breed should unquestionably be preferred; and that,      although crossing for the purpose of the butcher may be      practiced with impunity, and even with advantage, yet no one      should do so for the purpose of establishing a new breed, unless      he has clear and well defined views of the object he seeks to      accomplish, and has duly studied the principles on which it can      be carried out, and is determined to bestow for the space of      half a life-time his constant and unremitting attention to the      discovery and removal of defects.\"    The term crossing is sometimes used in a much more restricted sense,  as in the remark of Mr. Boswell in his essay quoted on page 69 where  he says, \"When I praise the advantage of crossing I would have it  clearly understood that it is only to bring together animals _not  nearly related_ but always of _the same breed_.\" It is evident that  such crossing as this is wholly unobjectionable; no one but an avowed  and ultra advocate of close breeding could possibly find any fault  with it.    There is yet another style of crossing which"]]]
