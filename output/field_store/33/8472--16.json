But the extreme good sense which  he concealed under a surface suggesting that of a careful owner's \"best  set\" came to his assistance. \"I don't see that I'm bound to consider Mr.  Osmond so very much!\" he exclaimed. \"No, but you should consider HER.  You say you're an old friend. Would you make her suffer?\"    \"Not for the world.\"    \"Then be very careful, and let the matter alone till I've taken a few  soundings.\"    \"Let the matter alone, dear Madame Merle? Remember that I'm in love.\"    \"Oh, you won't burn up! Why did you come to me, if you're not to heed  what I say?\"    \"You're very kind; I'll be very good,\" the young man promised. \"But I'm  afraid Mr. Osmond's pretty hard,\" he added in his mild voice as he went  to the door.    Madame Merle gave a short laugh. \"It has been said before. But his wife  isn't easy either.\"    \"Ah, she's a splendid woman!\" Ned Rosier repeated, for departure.  He resolved that his conduct should be worthy of an aspirant who was  already a model of discretion; but he saw nothing in any pledge he  had given Madame Merle that made it improper he should keep himself  in spirits by an occasional visit to Miss Osmond's home. He reflected  constantly on what his adviser had said to him, and turned over in his  mind the impression of her rather circumspect tone. He had gone to her  de confiance, as they put it in Paris; but it was possible he had been  precipitate. He found difficulty in thinking of himself as rash--he had  incurred this reproach so rarely; but it certainly was true that he had  known Madame Merle only for the last month, and that his thinking her  a delightful woman was not, when one came to look into it, a reason for  assuming that she would be eager to push Pansy Osmond into his arms,  gracefully arranged as these members might be to receive her. She had  indeed shown him benevolence, and she was a person of consideration  among the girl's people, where she had a rather striking appearance  (Rosier had more than once wondered how she managed it) of being  intimate without being familiar. But possibly he had exaggerated these  advantages. There was no particular reason why she should take trouble  for him; a charming woman was charming to every one, and Rosier felt  rather a fool when he thought of his having appealed to her on the  ground that she had distinguished him. Very likely--though she had  appeared to say it in joke--she was really only thinking of his  bibelots. Had it come into her head that he might offer her two or three  of the gems of his collection? If she would only help him to marry Miss  Osmond he would present her with his whole museum. He could hardly say  so to her outright; it would seem too gross a bribe. But he should like  her to believe it.    It was with these thoughts that he went again to Mrs. Osmond's,  Mrs. Osmond having an \"evening\"--she had taken the Thursday of each  week--when his presence could be accounted for on general principles of  civility. The object of Mr. Rosier's well-regulated affection dwelt in  a high house in the very heart of Rome; a dark and massive structure  overlooking a sunny piazzetta in the neighbourhood of the Farnese  Palace. In a palace, too, little Pansy lived--a palace by Roman measure,  but a dungeon to poor Rosier's apprehensive mind. It seemed to him of  evil omen that the young lady he wished to marry, and whose fastidious  father he doubted of his ability to conciliate, should be immured in  a kind of domestic fortress, a pile which bore a stern old Roman name,  which smelt of historic deeds, of crime and craft and violence, which  was mentioned in \"Murray\" and visited by tourists who looked, on a vague  survey, disappointed and depressed, and which had frescoes by Caravaggio  in the piano nobile and a row of mutilated statues and dusty urns in the  wide, nobly-arched loggia overhanging the damp court where a fountain  gushed out of a mossy niche. In a less preoccupied frame of mind he  could have done justice to the Palazzo Roccanera; he could have entered  into the sentiment of Mrs. Osmond, who had once told him that on  settling themselves in Rome she and her husband had chosen this  habitation for the love of local colour. It had local colour enough,  and though he knew less about architecture than about Limoges enamels  he could see that the proportions of the windows and even the details  of the cornice had quite the grand air. But Rosier was haunted by the  conviction that at picturesque periods young girls had been shut up  there to keep them from their true loves, and then, under the threat of  being thrown into convents, had been forced into unholy marriages. There  was one point, however, to which he always did justice when once he  found himself in Mrs. Osmond's warm, rich-looking reception-rooms, which  were on the second floor. He acknowledged that these people were very  strong in \"good things.\" It was a taste of Osmond's own--not at all of  hers; this she had told him the first time he came to the house, when,  after asking himself for a quarter of an hour whether they had even  better \"French\" than he in Paris, he was obliged on the spot to admit  that they had, very much, and vanquished his envy, as a gentleman  should, to the point of expressing to his hostess his pure admiration of  her treasures. He learned from Mrs. Osmond that her husband had made a  large collection before their marriage and that, though he had annexed  a number of fine pieces within the last three years, he had achieved his  greatest finds at a time when he had not the advantage of her advice.  Rosier interpreted this information according to principles of his own.  For \"advice\" read \"cash,\" he said to himself; and the fact that Gilbert  Osmond had landed his highest prizes during his impecunious season  confirmed his most cherished doctrine--the doctrine that a collector may  freely be poor if he be only patient. In general, when Rosier presented  himself on a Thursday evening, his first recognition was for the walls  of the saloon; there were three or four objects his eyes really  yearned for. But after his talk with Madame Merle he felt the extreme  seriousness of his position; and now, when he came in, he looked about  for the daughter of the house with such eagerness as might be permitted  a gentleman whose smile, as he crossed a threshold, always took  everything comfortable for granted.        CHAPTER XXXVII    Pansy was not in the first of the rooms, a large apartment with a  concave ceiling and walls covered with old red damask; it was here  Mrs. Osmond usually sat--though she was not in her most customary place  to-night--and that a circle of more especial intimates gathered about  the fire. The room was flushed with subdued, diffused brightness; it  contained the larger things and--almost always--an odour of flowers.  Pansy on this occasion was presumably in the next of the series, the  resort of younger visitors, where tea was served. Osmond stood before  the chimney, leaning back with his hands behind him; he had one foot up  and was warming the sole. Half a dozen persons, scattered near him, were  talking together; but he was not in the conversation; his eyes had an  expression, frequent with them, that seemed to represent them as engaged  with objects more worth their while than the appearances actually  thrust upon them. Rosier, coming in unannounced, failed to attract his  attention; but the young man, who was very punctilious, though he was  even exceptionally conscious that it was the wife, not the husband, he  had come to see, went up to shake hands with him. Osmond put out his  left hand, without changing his attitude.    \"How d'ye do? My wife's somewhere about.\"    \"Never fear; I shall find her,\" said Rosier cheerfully.    Osmond, however, took him in; he had never in his life felt himself so  efficiently looked at. \"Madame Merle has told him, and he doesn't like  it,\" he privately reasoned. He had hoped Madame Merle would be there,  but she was not in sight; perhaps she was in one of the other rooms or  would come later. He had never especially delighted in Gilbert Osmond,  having a fancy he gave himself airs. But Rosier was not quickly  resentful, and where politeness was concerned had ever a strong need of  being quite in the right. He looked round him and smiled, all without  help, and then in a moment, \"I saw a jolly good piece of Capo di Monte  to-day,\" he said.    Osmond answered nothing at first; but presently, while he warmed his  boot-sole, \"I don't care a fig for Capo di Monte!\" he returned.    \"I hope you're not losing your interest?\"    \"In old pots and plates? Yes, I'm losing my interest.\"    Rosier for an instant forgot the delicacy of his position. \"You're not  thinking of parting with a--a piece or two?\"    \"No, I'm not thinking of parting with anything at all, Mr. Rosier,\" said  Osmond, with his eyes still on the eyes of his visitor.    \"Ah, you want to keep, but not to add,\" Rosier remarked brightly.    \"Exactly. I've nothing I wish to match.\"    Poor Rosier was aware he had blushed; he was distressed at his want of  assurance. \"Ah, well, I have!\" was all he could murmur; and he knew  his murmur was partly lost as he turned away. He took his course to the  adjoining room and met Mrs. Osmond coming out of the deep doorway. She  was dressed in black velvet; she looked high and splendid, as he had  said, and yet oh so radiantly gentle! We know what Mr. Rosier thought  of her and the terms in which, to Madame Merle, he had expressed his  admiration. Like his appreciation of her dear little stepdaughter it  was based partly on his eye for decorative character, his instinct for  authenticity; but also on a sense for uncatalogued values, for that  secret of a \"lustre\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28346"],[0,"Deathworld (#15)"],[1,"the arch. After all, hadn't the wounded man  taken his place? He finished the meal without realizing that he ate.    Ever since that morning, when he had recovered consciousness, it had  been like this. He knew that he should have died out there in that  battle-torn street. _His_ life should have been snuffed out, for making  the mistake of thinking that he could actually help the battling  Pyrrans. Instead of being underfoot and in the way. If it hadn't been  for Jason, the man with the wounded arm would have been brought here to  the safety of the reorientation buildings. He knew he was lying in the  bed that belonged to that man.    The man who had given his life for Jason's.    The man whose name he didn't even know.    There were drugs in the food and they made him sleep. The medicated pads  soaked the pain and rawness out of the burns where the tentacles had  seared his face. When he awoke the second time, his touch with reality  had been restored.    A man had died so he could live. Jason faced the fact. He couldn't  restore that life, no matter how much he wanted to. What he could do was  make the man's death worth while. If it can be said that any death was  worth while ... He forced his thoughts from that track.    Jason knew what he had to do. His work was even more important now. If  he could solve the riddle of this deadly world, he could repay in part  the debt he owed.    Sitting up made his head spin and he held to the edge of the bed until  it slowed down. The others in the room ignored him as he slowly and  painfully dragged on his clothes. Brucco came in, saw what he was doing,  and left again without a word.    Dressing took a long time, but it was finally done. When Jason finally  left the room he found Kerk waiting for him.    \"Kerk ... I want to tell you ...\"    \"Tell me _nothing_!\" The thunder of Kerk's voice bounced back from the  ceiling and walls. \"I'm telling _you_. I'll tell you once and that will  be the end of it. You're not wanted on Pyrrus, Jason dinAlt, neither you  nor your precious off-world schemes are wanted here. I let you convince  me once with your twisted tongue. Helped you at the expense of more  important work. I should have known what the result of your 'logic'  would be. Now I've seen. Welf died so you could live. He was twice the  man you will ever be.\"    \"Welf? Was that his name?\" Jason asked stumblingly. \"I didn't know--\"    \"You didn't even know.\" Kerk's lips pulled back from his teeth in a  grimace of disgust. \"You didn't even know his name--yet he died that  you might continue your miserable existence.\" Kerk spat, as if the words  gave a vile flavor to his speech, and stamped towards the exit lock.  Almost as an afterthought he turned back to Jason.    \"You'll stay here in the sealed buildings until the ship returns in two  weeks. Then you will leave this planet and never come back. If you do,  I'll kill you instantly. With pleasure.\" He started through the lock.    \"Wait,\" Jason shouted. \"You can't decide like that. You haven't even  seen the evidence I've uncovered. Ask Meta--\" The lock thumped shut and  Kerk was gone.           *       *       *       *       *    The whole thing was just too stupid. Anger began to replace the futile  despair of a moment before. He was being treated like an irresponsible  child, the importance of his discovery of the log completely ignored.    Jason turned and saw for the first time that Brucco was standing there.  \"Did you hear that?\" Jason asked him.    \"Yes. And I quite agree. You can consider yourself lucky.\"    \"Lucky!\" Jason was the angry one now. \"Lucky to be treated like a  moronic child, with contempt for everything I do--\"    \"I said lucky,\" Brucco snapped. \"Welf was Kerk's only surviving son.  Kerk had high hopes for him, was training him to take his place  eventually.\" He turned to leave but Jason called after him.    \"Wait. I'm sorry about Welf. I can't be any sorrier knowing that he was  Kerk's son. But at least it explains why Kerk is so quick to throw me  out--as well as the evidence I have uncovered. The log of the ship--\"    \"I know, I've seen it,\" Brucco said. \"Meta brought it in. Very  interesting historical document.\"    \"That's all you can see it as--an historical document? The significance  of the planetary change escapes you?\"    \"It doesn't escape me,\" Brucco answered briefly, \"but I cannot see that  it has any relevancy today. The past is unchangeable and we must fight  in the present. That is enough to occupy all our energies.\"    Jason felt too exhausted to argue the point any more. He ran into the  same stone wall with all the Pyrrans. Theirs was a logic of the moment.  The past and the future unchangeable, unknowable--and uninteresting.  \"How is the perimeter battle going?\" he asked, wanting to change the  subject.    \"Finished. Or in the last stages at least,\" Brucco was almost  enthusiastic as he showed Jason some stereos of the attackers. He did  not notice Jason's repressed shudder.    \"This was one of the most serious breakthroughs in years, but we caught  it in time. I hate to think what would have happened if they hadn't been  detected for a few weeks more.\"    \"What are those things?\" Jason asked. \"Giant snakes of some kind?\"    \"Don't be absurd,\" Brucco snorted. He tapped the stereo with his  thumbnail. \"Roots. That's all. Greatly modified, but still roots. They  came in under the perimeter barrier, much deeper than anything we've had  before. Not a real threat in themselves as they have very little  mobility. Die soon after being cut. The danger came from their being  used as access tunnels. They're bored through and through with animal  runs, and two or three species of beasts live in a sort of symbiosis  inside.    \"Now we know what they are we can watch for them. The danger was they  could have completely undermined the perimeter and come in from all  sides at once. Not much we could have done then.\"    [Illustration]    The edge of destruction. Living on the lip of a volcano. The Pyrrans  took satisfaction from any day that passed without total annihilation.  There seemed no way to change their attitude. Jason let the conversation  die there. He picked up the log of the _Pollux Victory_ from Brucco's  quarters and carried it back to his room. The wounded Pyrrans there  ignored him as he dropped onto the bed and opened the book to the first  page.    For two days he did not leave his quarters. The wounded men were soon  gone and he had the room to himself. Page by page he went through the  log, until he knew every detail of the settlement of Pyrrus. His notes  and cross-references piled up. He made an accurate map of the original  settlement, superimposed over a modern one. They didn't match at all.    It was a dead end. With one map held over the other, what he had  suspected was painfully clear. The descriptions of terrain and physical  features in the log were accurate enough. The city had obviously been  moved since the first landing. Whatever records had been kept would be  in the library--and he had exhausted that source. Anything else would  have been left behind and long since destroyed.    Rain lashed against the thick window above his head, lit suddenly by a  flare of lightning. The unseen volcanoes were active again, vibrating  the floor with their rumblings deep in the earth.    The shadow of defeat pressed heavily down on Jason. Rounding his  shoulders and darkening, even more, the overcast day.          XIV.      Jason spent one depressed day lying on his bunk counting rivets, forcing  himself to accept defeat. Kerk's order that he was not to leave the  sealed building tied his hands completely. He felt himself close to the  answer--but he was never going to get it.    One day of defeat was all he could take. Kerk's attitude was completely  emotional, untempered by the slightest touch of logic. This fact kept  driving home until Jason could no longer ignore it. Emotional reasoning  was something he had learned to mistrust early in life. He couldn't  agree with Kerk in the slightest--which meant he had to utilize the ten  remaining days to solve the problem. If it meant disobeying Kerk, it  would still have to be done.    He grabbed up his noteplate with a new enthusiasm. His first sources of  information had been used up, but there must be others. Chewing the  scriber and needling his brain, he slowly built up a list of other  possibilities. Any idea, no matter how wild, was put down. When the  plate was filled he wiped the long shots and impossibles--such as  consulting off-world historical records. This was a Pyrran problem, and  had to be settled on this planet or not at all.    The list worked down to two probables. Either old records, notebooks or  diaries that individual Pyrrans might have in their possession, or  verbal histories that had been passed down the generations by word of  mouth. The first choice seemed to be the most probable and he acted on  it at once. After a careful check of his medikit and gun he went to see  Brucco.    \"What's new and deadly in the world since I left?\" he asked.    Brucco glared at him. \"You can't go out, Kerk has forbidden it.\"    \"Did he put you in charge of guarding me to see if I obeyed?\" Jason's  voice was quiet and cold.    Brucco rubbed his jaw and frowned in thought. Finally he just shrugged.  \"No, I'm not guarding you--nor do I want the job. As far as I know this  is between you and Kerk and it can stay that way. Leave whenever you  want. And get yourself killed quietly some place so there will be an end  to the trouble you cause once and for all.\"    \"I love you, too,\" Jason said. \"Now brief me on the wildlife.\"    The only new mutation that routine precautions wouldn't take care of was  a slate-colored lizard that spit a fast nerve poison with deadly  accuracy. Death took place in seconds if the saliva touched any bare  skin. The lizards had to be looked out for, and shot before they came  within range. An"]]]
