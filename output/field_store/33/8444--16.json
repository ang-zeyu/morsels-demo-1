Our expanded Cross-Reference List of Geographic Names,  however, includes many of the world's major geographic features as  well as historic (former) names of countries and cities mentioned in  The World Factbook.    Why are Taiwan and the European Union listed out of alphabetical  order at the end of the Factbook entries?    Taiwan is listed after the regular entries because even though the  mainland People's Republic of China claims Taiwan, elected Taiwanese  authorities de facto administer the island and reject mainland  sovereignty claims. With the establishment of diplomatic relations  with China on January 1, 1979, the US Government recognized the  People's Republic of China as the sole legal government of China,  acknowledging the Chinese position that there is only one China and  that Taiwan is part of China.    The European Union (EU) is not a country, but it has taken on many  nation-like attributes and these are likely to be expanded in the  future. A more complete explanation on the inclusion of the EU into  the Factbook may be found in the Preliminary statement.    Since we have an ambassador who represents the US at the Vatican,  why is this entity not listed in the Factbook?    Vatican City is found under Holy See. The term \"Holy See\" refers to  the authority, jurisdiction, and sovereignty vested in the Pope and  his advisors to direct the worldwide Catholic Church. The Holy See  has a legal personality that allows it to enter into treaties as the  juridical equal of a state and to send and receive diplomatic  representatives. Vatican City, created in 1929 to administer  properties belonging to the Holy See in Rome, is recognized under  international law as a sovereign state, but it does not send or  receive diplomatic representatives. Consequently, Holy See is  included as a Factbook entry, with Vatican City cross-referenced in  the Geographic Names appendix.    Why is Palestine not listed in The World Factbook?    The areas that could potentially form a future Palestinian state --  the West Bank and Gaza Strip -- do appear in the Factbook. These  areas are presently Israeli-occupied with current status subject to  the Israeli-Palestinian 1995 Interim Agreement; their permanent  status is to be determined through further negotiation.    Why are the Golan Heights not shown as part of Israel or Northern  Cyprus with Turkey?    Territorial occupations/annexations not recognized by the United  States Government are not shown on US Government maps.    Why don't you include information on entities such as Tibet,  Kashmir, or Kosovo?    The World Factbook provides information on the administrative  divisions of a country as recommended by the United States Board on  Geographic Names (BGN). The BGN is a component of the US Government  that develops policies, principles, and procedures governing the  spelling, use, and application of geographic names--domestic,  foreign, Antarctic, and undersea. Its decisions enable all  departments and agencies of the US Government to have access to  uniform names of geographic features.    Also included in the Factbook are entries on parts of the world  whose status has not yet been resolved (e.g., West Bank, Spratly  Islands). Specific regions within a country or areas in dispute  among countries are not covered.    What do you mean when you say that a country is \"doubly landlocked\"?  A doubly landlocked country is one that is separated from an ocean  or an ocean-accessible sea by two intervening countries. Uzbekistan  and Liechtenstein are the only countries that fit this definition.    Why is the area of the United States described as \"slightly larger  than China\" in the Factbook, while other sources list China as  larger in area than the United States?    It all depends on whether one is looking at total area (land and  water) when making the comparison (which is the criterion used by  the Factbook) or just land area (which excludes inland water  features such as rivers or lakes).    Total area (combining land and water)    United States = 9,631,418 sq km  China = 9,596,960 sq km    Land only (without any water features)    United States = 9,161,923 sq km  China = 9,326,410 sq km    Why has The World Factbook dropped the four French departments of  Guadeloupe, Martinique, Reunion, and French Guiana?    The reason the four entities are no longer in The World Factbook is  because their status has changed. While they are overseas  departments of France, they are also now recognized as French  regions, having equal status to the 22 metropolitan regions that  make up European France. In other words, they are now recognized as  being part of France proper. Their status is somewhat analogous to  Alaska and Hawaii vis-a-vis the contiguous United States. Although  separated from the larger geographic entity, they are still  considered to be an integral part of it.      Spelling and Pronunciation    Why is the spelling of proper names such as rulers, presidents, and  prime ministers in The World Factbook different than their spelling  in my country?    The Factbook staff applies the names and spellings from the Chiefs  of State link on the CIA Web site. The World Factbook is prepared  using the standard American English computer keyboard and does not  use any special characters, symbols, or most diacritical markings in  its spellings. Surnames are always spelled with capital letters;  they may appear first in some cultures.    The spelling of geographic names, features, cities, administrative  divisions, etc. in the Factbook differs from those used in my  country. Why is this?    The United States Board on Geographic Names (BGN) recommends and  approves names and spellings. The BGN is the component of the United  States Government that develops policies, principles, and procedures  governing the spelling, use, and application of geographic  names--domestic, foreign, Antarctic, and undersea. Its decisions  enable all departments and agencies of the US Government to use  uniform names of geographic features. (A note is usually included  where changes may have occurred but have not yet been approved by  the BGN). The World Factbook is prepared using the standard American  English computer keyboard and does not use any special characters,  symbols, or most diacritical markings in its spellings.    Why doesn't The World Factbook include pronunciations of country or  leader names?    There are too many variations in pronunciation among  English-speaking countries, not to mention English renditions of  non-English names, for pronunciations to be included. American  English pronunciations are included for some countries like Qatar  and Kiribati.    Why is the name of the Labour party misspelled?    When American and British spellings of common English words differ,  The World Factbook always uses the American spelling, even when  these common words form part of a proper name in British English.      Policies and Procedures    What is The World Factbook's source for a specific subject field?    The Factbook staff uses many different sources to publish what we  judge are the most reliable and consistent data for any particular  category. Space considerations preclude a listing of these various  sources.    The names of some geographic features provided in the Factbook  differ from those used in other publications. For example, in Asia  the Factbook has Burma as the country name, but in other  publications Myanmar is used; also, the Factbook uses Sea of Japan  whereas other publications label it East Sea. What is your policy on  naming geographic features?    The Factbook staff follows the guidance of the United States Board  on Geographic Names (BGN). The BGN is the component of the United  States Government that develops policies, principles, and procedures  governing the spelling, use, and application of geographic  names--domestic, foreign, Antarctic, and undersea. Its decisions  enable all departments and agencies of the US Government to have  access to uniform names of geographic features. The position of the  BGN is that the names Burma and Sea of Japan be used in official US  Government maps and publications.    Why is most of the statistical information in the Factbook given in  metric units, rather than the units standard to US measure?    US Federal agencies are required by the Metric Conversion Act of  1975 (Public Law 94-168) and by Executive Order 12770 of July 1991  to use the International System of Units, commonly referred to as  the metric system or SI. In addition, the metric system is used by  over 95 percent of the world's population.    Why don't you include information on minimum and maximum temperature  extremes?    The Factbook staff judges that this information would only be useful  for some (generally smaller) countries. Larger countries can have  large temperature extremes that do not represent the landmass as a  whole. In the future, such a category may be adopted listing the  extremes, but also adding a normal temperature range found  throughout most of a country's territory.    What information sources are used for the country flags?    Flag designs used in The World Factbook are those recognized by the  protocol office of the US Department of State.    Why do your GDP (Gross Domestic Product) statistics differ from  other sources?    We have two sets of GDP dollar estimates in The World Factbook, one  derived from purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations and the  other derived using official exchange rates (OER). Other sources  probably use one of the two. See the Notes and Definitions section  on GDP and GDP methodology for more information.    On the CIA Web site, Chiefs of State is updated weekly, but the last  update for the Factbook was an"]]]
