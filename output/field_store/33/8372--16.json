Mohair brilliantine is used for dress goods.    =Montagnac= is heavy overcoating. The French _montagne_, for mountain,  is the origin of the name, being for mountain wear.    =Orleans.= Cloth of cotton warp and bright wool fulling, made in  Orleans, France. Many of the so-called alpacas and mohairs of to-day  are Orleans. These fabrics are mostly cross-dyed, that is, fabrics  with warp and filling of different shades. After weaving they are  cross-dyed or redyed to give solid colors and glace effects.    =Panama Cloth= is a plain weave worsted fabric of no uniform  construction or finish. Fabrics sold under this name vary  considerably. They are of solid colors, usually piece dyed, and are  used for suitings.    =Prunella.= From the French _prunelle_, which means plum, a stout  worsted material named from its color, which is a purplish shade  similar to that of a ripe plum. The name was originally applied to a  kind of lasting of which clergymen's gowns were made. It is now used  to denote a variety of rich, satin-faced worsted cloth employed for  women's dresses. The fibers are worsted. Prunella is dyed either in  piece or yarn state and is hand finished.    =Sacking.= Plain solid color flannel in special shades for women's  dressing sacks, also applied to a fabric made of hemp for grain sacks.    =Sanglier.= A plain fabric of wiry worsted or mohair yarn, closely  woven, with a rough finished surface. Sanglier is French for wild  boar, the hairy, wiry cloth resembling the coat of the animal.    =Sebastopol.= A twill-faced cloth named from Sebastopol, the Russian  fortified town captured by the English and French in 1855.    =Serge.= Under this name are classed a large number of fabrics of  twill construction. In weight and texture a modern serge resembles  flannel, except that it is twill woven and composed of fine yarn  finished with a smoother surface. Serge comes from the Italian word  _sergea_, meaning cloth of wool mixed with silk. Serges are woven of  worsted, of silk, or of cotton yarn, and variously dyed, finished, and  ornamented, as silk serge, serge suiting, storm serge, mohair serge,  etc. Worsted serges of various kinds and degrees have been known since  the twelfth century. Worsted serge appears to have come into general  use as a material for men's wear in the sixteenth century. Modern  serges vary but little from those made two centuries ago. They are  dyed in a great variety of colors. On leaving the loom the cloth is  washed and scoured with soap and water to remove the dirt and oil (if  these remain the cloth will not take the dye properly). After dyeing,  it is passed through a pair of metal rollers under pressure, which  renders the surface more regular and even and of a better luster. This  process accomplishes more than is required, for it produces a bloom on  the surface which will show rain specks when in the garment, if it is  allowed to remain. This is ordinary serge. In order to make storm  serge it is necessary to remove part of the bloom, and to accomplish  this the cloth is steamed sufficiently to neutralize the effect of  pressing. Steaming deadens the bloom and prevents the effects of rain  showing on the cloth. The wearing qualities of serge are good, but it  gets a shine easily. It is used for dress goods and suitings. Serge  suiting used for men's clothing is a variety of light, wiry, worsted  yarn woven with a flat twill, and dyed black or in shades of blue,  fifty-four inches in width. Mohair serge is woven with a cotton warp  and a mohair filling, thirty-two inches in width. This is dyed in a  variety of colors and largely used as lining material for women's  clothes, men's coats, and overcoats. Storm serge, designed to  withstand exposure to stormy weather, is a coarse variety of worsted  dress goods produced in a wide range of colors and qualities. The  twill is wider, the texture stouter, and the surface rougher and  cleaner than that of ordinary serge. Iridescent serge is a variety of  worsted dress goods woven with warp and filling of different colors,  causing a shimmering or iridescent effect. Cravenette serge is a fine  twilled variety having a firm, closely woven texture, dyed black and  in colors, and is used for women's gowns, men's summer suits, etc.  Serge de Barry is a high-grade dress goods of fine texture, with fine  twill, and wiry feel.    =Shoddy= is made from old woolen stockings or rags, shredded or picked  by hand or machine, to render the yarn suitable for spinning a second  time, or to give a fiber that can be woven or felted with a wool or  cotton warp. The name has come to mean cheap, make-believe.    =Sicilian.= Heavy weight cotton warp, mohair filled cloth. Sicilienne,  the proper name, was made in the Island of Sicily as a heavy ribbed,  all silk fabric.    =Sultane.= Twilled cloth of silk and wool; finished in the rough, not  singed or sheared. The name is from Sultana, the first wife of the  Sultan.    =Tamise.= Similar to etamine, with a very close mesh, made first of  silk and wool. _Tamis_ is French for sieve.    =Tartans.= Plaids of the Scottish clans worn by men in the Highlands  of Scotland as a diagonal scarf, fastened on one shoulder and crossing  the body. Each clan had a distinctive tartan or plaid. The name was  adapted from the French _tiretaine_, a thin woolen checked cloth.    =Thibet.= Heavy, coarse weave of goat's hair, made by the Thibetans in  Asia for men's wear.    =Tricot.= A heavy, compound fabric characterized by a line effect  running warp way or filling way of the piece, usually produced with  either woolen or worsted yarn. Tricot was originally a name given to  fabrics made of woolen yarn or thread by hand knitting, and is the  French word meaning knitting. The term was later applied to materials  made on a knitting frame and now known as jersey cloth. Since 1840 the  name tricot has been applied to finely woven woolen cloth, the weave  of which is intended to imitate the face effect of a knitted fabric.  The fabric is composed of woolen and worsted fibers, sometimes with  cotton warp woven so as to hide the cotton in finishing. The tricot  line is similar to the rib line in a ribbed cloth except that it is  not so pronounced. All tricots are constructed with two sets of warp  thread and are characterized by a texture which, while dense, is  singularly elastic, in this respect being somewhat similar to heavy  jersey cloth. Tricots are commonly dyed in plain colors, and are  finished clear so as to show the filling. When intended for trousers  they are ornamented with small, neat patterns.    =Tweed.= A rough unfinished fabric of soft, open, and flexible  texture, of wool or cotton and wool, usually of yarn of two or more  shades; originally the product of the weavers on the bank of the river  Tweed in Scotland. The face of the cloth presents an unfinished  appearance rather than a sharp and clearly defined pattern.    =Veiling= includes light weight, usually plain weave fabrics of  various constructions; generally made with singed or polished yarns.  They are in solid colors. The use is designated by the name.    =Venetian.= Venetian cloth has a worsted or cotton warp and worsted  filling; named from Venetia, a country around Venice. The warp yarns  are firmly twisted, the twist being in the opposite direction to the  twist in the filling yarn. Venetian is a trade term of wide  application, in use since early times as a descriptive title for  various fabrics, textures, and garments. One of the many varieties is  a species of twill weaving in which the lines or twills are of a  rounded form and arranged in a more or less upright position, hence a  closely woven worsted cloth. The name is also applied to other  fabrics, as a twilled lining fabric woven with a cotton warp and a  worsted filling known as Italian cloth. It is dyed in plain colors and  is piece or yarn dyed for men. For women's wear it has light weight  and plain colors with mixed effects and closely sheared nap. It is  finished smooth so as to show the yarns prominently. Venetian cloth  has not so much felting as broadcloth; it shows the weave more, but  has the same lustrous finish.    =Vigogne= or =Vicuna=. A soft wool cloth of the cheviot order, with  teasled face, made from the wool of the vicuna, a South American  animal. Vigogne is the French name for the animal.    =Vigoureux.= A name applied to a plain or twill mixture, woven of  undyed natural wool yarns. The French spinners found that the  strongest yarns were those of the undyed wool. Sometimes two or more  shades or tones are spun into one thread. The name is French for  strong.    =Voiles.= Voiles are plain weave worsted fabrics made with hard  twisted yarns. As clear a face as possible is secured in finishing,  the cloth being singed or sheared closely if the yarns are not made  comparatively free from loose fibers before being woven. Voiles are  dyed in solid colors, and are used principally for dress goods.    =Whipcord.= Hard twisted worsted twills, either solid or mixed colors.  The name is from the hard twisted lash of a whip.    =Worsted Diagonals= are characterized by prominent weave effects  running diagonally across the cloth. The goods are usually of a solid  color, and are given a finish which brings the weave into prominence.  Diagonals are used for suitings.    =Unfinished worsted= is a fabric woven with yarn with very little  twist in it, and finished so as to make it appear covered with loose  fibers, concealing the twill effect. After leaving the loom the cloth  is placed in a fulling machine which condenses the fibers, thus  increasing the density. It is then passed over hot presses after a  slight shearing.    =Finished Worsted= is woven with yarn with a considerable twist, and  finished in such a way as to show the construction of the cloth  clearly. The finishing consists simply of scouring the cloth and not  fulling it and then passing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24107"],[0,"The New World of Islam (#15)"],[1,"they are to Pan-Islamism's chauvinistic, reactionary tendencies,  Europe's intransigeance is forcing them to make at least a temporary  alliance with the Pan-Islamic and Nationalist groups, even though the  liberals know that anything like a holy war would dig a gulf between  East and West, stop the influx of Western stimuli, favour reactionary  fanaticism, and perhaps postpone for generations a modernist reformation  of Islam.    Perhaps it is symptomatic of a more bellicose temper in Islam that the  last few years have witnessed the rapid spread of two new puritan,  fanatic movements--the Ikhwan and the Salafiya. The Ikhwan movement  began obscurely about ten years ago in inner Arabia--the Nejd. It is a  direct outgrowth of Wahabism, from which it differs in no essential  respect. So rapid has been Ikhwanism's progress that it to-day  absolutely dominates the entire Nejd, and it is headed by desert  Arabia's most powerful chieftain, Bin Saud, a descendant of the Saud who  headed the Wahabi movement a hundred years ago. The fanaticism of the  Ikhwans is said to be extraordinary, while their programme is the old  Wahabi dream of a puritan conversion of the whole Islamic world.[69] As  for the Salafi movement, it started in India even more obscurely than  Ikhwanism did in Arabia, but during the past few years it has spread  widely through Islam. Like Ikhwanism, it is puritanical and fanatical in  spirit, its adherents being found especially among dervish  organizations.[70] Such phenomena, taken with everything else, do not  augur well for the peace of the East.    So much for Pan-Islamism's religious and political sides. Now let us  glance at its commercial and industrial aspects--at what may be called  economic Pan-Islamism.    Economic Pan-Islamism is the direct result of the permeation of Western  ideas. Half a century ago the Moslem world was economically still in the  Middle Ages. The provisions of the sheriat, or Moslem canon law, such as  the prohibition of interest rendered economic life in the modern sense  impossible. What little trade and industry did exist was largely in the  hands of native Christians or Jews. Furthermore, the whole economic life  of the East was being disorganized by the aggressive competition of the  West. Europe's political conquest of the Moslem world was, in fact,  paralleled by an economic conquest even more complete. Everywhere  percolated the flood of cheap, abundant European machine-made goods,  while close behind came European capital, temptingly offering itself in  return for loans and concessions which, once granted, paved the way for  European political domination.    Yet in economics as in politics the very completeness of Europe's  triumph provoked resistance. Angered and alarmed by Western  exploitation, Islam frankly recognized its economic inferiority and  sought to escape from its subjection. Far-sighted Moslems began casting  about for a _modus vivendi_ with modern life that would put Islam  economically abreast of the times. Western methods were studied and  copied. The prohibitions of the sheriat were evaded or quietly ignored.    The upshot has been a marked evolution toward Western economic  standards. This evolution is of course still in its early stages, and is  most noticeable in lands most exposed to Western influences like India,  Egypt, and Algeria. Yet everywhere in the Moslem world the trend is the  same. The details of this economic transformation will be discussed in  the chapter devoted to economic change. What we are here concerned with  is its Pan-Islamic aspect. And that aspect is very strong. Nowhere does  Islam's innate solidarity come out better than in the economic field.  The religious, cultural, and customary ties which bind Moslem to Moslem  enable Mohammedans to feel more or less at home in every part of the  Islamic world, while Western methods of transit and communication enable  Mohammedans to travel and keep in touch as they never could before. New  types of Moslems--wholesale merchants, steamship owners, business men,  bankers, even factory industrialists and brokers--are rapidly evolving;  types which would have been simply unthinkable a century, or even half a  century, ago.    And these new men understand each other perfectly. Bound together both  by the ties of Islamic fraternity and by the pressure of Western  competition, they co-ordinate their efforts much more easily than  politicals have succeeded in doing. Here liberals, Pan-Islamists, and  nationalists can meet on common ground. Here is no question of political  conspiracies, revolts, or holy wars, challenging the armed might of  Europe and risking bloody repression or blind reaction. On the contrary,  here is merely a working together of fellow Moslems for economic ends  by business methods which the West cannot declare unlawful and dare not  repress.    What, then, is the specific programme of economic Pan-Islamism? It is  easily stated: the wealth of Islam for Moslems. The profits of trade and  industry for Moslem instead of Christian hands. The eviction of Western  capital by Moslem capital. Above all, the breaking of Europe's grip on  Islam's natural resources by the termination of concessions in lands,  mines, forests, railways, custom-houses, by which the wealth of Islamic  lands is to-day drained away to foreign shores.    Such are the aspirations of economic Pan-Islamism. They are wholly  modern concepts, the outgrowth of those Western ideas whose influence  upon the Moslem world I shall now discuss.[71]    FOOTNOTES:    [25] Islam has not only won much ground in India, Brahmanism's homeland,  but has also converted virtually the entire populations of the  great islands of Java and Sumatra, where Brahmanism was formerly  ascendant.
