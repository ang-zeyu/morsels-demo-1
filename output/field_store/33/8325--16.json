Without a moment's hesitation, Edward set off for Tully-Veolan, and  after one or two adventures he arrived there, only to find the white  tents of a military encampment whitening the moor above the village. The  house itself had been sacked. Part of the stables had been burned, while  the only living being left about the mansion of Tully-Veolan was no  other than poor Davie Gellatley, who, chanting his foolish songs as  usual, greeted Edward with the cheering intelligence that \"_A' were dead  and gane--Baron--Bailie--Saunders Saunderson--and Lady Rose that sang  sae sweet!_\"    However, it was not long before he set off at full speed, motioning  Waverley to follow him. The innocent took a difficult and dangerous path  along the sides of a deep glen, holding on to bushes, rounding perilous  corners of rock, till at last the barking of dogs directed them to the  entrance of a wretched hovel. Here Davie's mother received Edward with a  sullen fierceness which the young man could not understand--till, from  behind the door, holding a pistol in his hand, unwashed, gaunt, and  with a three weeks' beard fringing his hollow cheeks, he saw come  forth--the Baron of Bradwardine himself.    After the first gladsome greetings were over, the old man had many a  tale to tell his young English friend. But his chief grievance was not  his danger of the gallows, nor the discomfort of his hiding-place, but  the evil-doing of his cousin, to whom, as it now appeared, the Barony of  Bradwardine now belonged. Malcolm of Inch-Grabbit had, it appeared, come  to uplift the rents of the Barony. But the country people, being  naturally indignant that he should have so readily taken advantage of  the misfortune of his kinsman, received him but ill. Indeed, a shot was  fired at the new proprietor by some unknown marksman in the gloaming,  which so frightened the heir that he fled at once to Stirling and had  the estate promptly advertised for sale.    \"In addition to which,\" continued the old man, \"though I bred him up  from a boy, he hath spoken much against me to the great folk of the  time, so that they have sent a company of soldiers down here to destroy  all that belongs to me, and to hunt his own blood-kin like a partridge  upon the mountains.\"    \"Aye,\" cried Janet Gellatley, \"and if it had not been for my poor Davie  there, they would have catched the partridge, too!\"    Then with a true mother's pride Janet told the story of how the poor  innocent had saved his master. The Baron was compelled by the strictness  of the watch to hide, all day and most of the nights, in a cave high up  in a wooded glen.    \"A comfortable place enough,\" the old woman explained; \"for the goodman  of Corse-Cleugh has filled it with straw. But his Honour tires of it,  and he comes down here whiles for a warm at the fire, or at times a  sleep between the blankets. But once, when he was going back in the  dawn, two of the English soldiers got a glimpse of him as he was  slipping into the wood and banged off a gun at him. I was out on them  like a hawk, crying if they wanted to murder a poor woman's innocent  bairn! Whereupon they swore down my throat that they had seen 'the auld  rebel himself,' as they called the Baron. But my Davie, that some folk  take for a simpleton, being in the wood, caught up the old grey cloak  that his Honour had dropped to run the quicker, and came out from among  the trees as we were speaking, majoring and play-acting so like his  Honour that the soldier-men were clean beguiled, and even gave me  sixpence to say nothing about their having let off their gun at 'poor  crack-brained Sawney,' as they named my Davie!\"    It was not till this long tale was ended that Waverley heard what he had  come so far to find out--that Rose was safe in the house of a Whig  Laird, an old friend of her father's, and that the Bailie, who had early  left the army of the Prince, was trying his best to save something out  of the wreck for her.    The next morning Edward went off to call on Bailie Macwheeble. At first  the man of law was not very pleased to see him, but when he learned that  Waverley meant to ask Rose to be his wife, he flung his best wig out of  the window and danced the Highland fling for very joy. This rejoicing  was a little marred by the fact that Waverley was still under  proscription. But when a messenger of the Bailie's had returned from the  nearest post-town with a letter from Colonel Talbot, all fear on this  account was at an end. Colonel Talbot had, though with the greatest  difficulty, obtained royal Protections for both the Baron of Bradwardine  and for Edward himself. There was no doubt that full pardons would  follow in due course.    Right thankfully the Baron descended from his cave, as soon as Edward  carried him the good news, and with Davie Gellatley and his mother, all  went down to the house of Bailie Macwheeble, where supper was  immediately served.    It was from old Janet Gellatley, Davie's mother, that Waverley learned  whom he had to thank for rescuing him from the hands of Captain Gifted  Gilfillan, and to whom the gentle voice belonged which had cheered him  during his illness. It was none other than Rose Bradwardine herself. To  her, Edward owed all. She had even given up her jewels to Donald Bean  Lean, that he might go scatheless. She it was who had provided a nurse  for him in the person of old Janet Gellatley herself, and lastly she had  seen him safely on his way to Holyrood under the escort of the sulky  Laird of Balmawhapple.    So great kindness certainly required very special thanks. And Edward was  not backward in asking the Baron for permission to accompany him to the  house of Duchran, where Rose was at present residing. So well did Edward  express his gratitude to Rose, that she consented to give all her life  into his hands, that he might go on showing how thankful he was.    Of course the marriage could not take place for some time, because the  full pardons of the Baron and Edward took some time to obtain. For  Fergus Mac-Ivor, alas, no pardon was possible. He and Evan Dhu were  condemned to be executed for high treason at Carlisle, and all that  Edward could do was only to promise the condemned Chieftain that he  would be kind to the poor clansmen of Vich Ian Vohr, for the sake of his  friend.    As for Evan Dhu, he might have escaped. The Judge went the length of  offering to show mercy, if Evan would only ask it. But when Evan Dhu was  called upon to plead before the Court, his only request was that he  might be permitted to go down to Glennaquoich and bring up six men to be  hanged in the place of Vich Ian Vohr.    \"And,\" he said, \"ye may begin with me the first man!\"    At this there was a laugh in the Court. But Evan, looking about him  sternly, added: \"If the Saxon gentlemen are laughing because a poor man  such as me thinks my life, or the life of any six of my degree, is worth  that of Vich Ian Vohr, they may be very right. But if they laugh because  they think I would not keep my word, and come back to redeem him, I can  tell them they ken neither the heart of a Hielandman nor the honour of a  gentleman!\"    After these words, there was no more laughing in that Court.    Nothing now could save Fergus Mac-Ivor. The government were resolved on  his death as an example, and both he and Evan were accordingly executed,  along with many others of the unhappy garrison of Carlisle.           *       *       *       *       *    Edward and Rose were married from the house of Duchran, and some days  after they started, according to the custom of the time, to spend some  time upon an estate which Colonel Talbot had bought, as was reported, a  very great bargain. The Baron had been persuaded to accompany them,  taking a place of honour in their splendid coach and six, the gift of  Sir Everard. The coach of Mr. Rubrick of Duchran came next, full of  ladies, and many gentlemen on horseback rode with them as an escort to  see them well on their way.    At the turning of the road which led to Tully-Veolan, the Bailie met  them. He requested the party to turn aside and accept of his hospitality  at his house of Little Veolan. The Baron, somewhat put out, replied that  he and his son-in-law would ride that way, but that they would not bring  upon him the whole matrimonial procession. It was clear, however, that  the Baron rather dreaded visiting the ancient home of his ancestors,  which had been so lately sold by the unworthy Malcolm of Inch-Grabbit  into the hands of a stranger. But as the Bailie insisted, and as the  party evidently wished to accept, he could not hold out.    When the Baron arrived at the avenue, he fell into a melancholy  meditation, thinking doubtless of the days when he had taken such pride  in the ancient Barony which had passed for ever away from the line of  the Bradwardines. From these bitter thoughts he was awakened by the  sight of the two huge stone bears which had been replaced over the  gate-posts.    Then down the avenue came the two great deer-hounds, Ban and Buscar,  which had so long kept their master company in his solitude, with Daft  Davie Gellatley dancing behind them.    The Baron was then informed that the present owner of the Barony was no  other than Colonel Talbot himself. But that if he did not care to visit  the new owner of Bradwardine, the party would proceed to Little Veolan,  the house of Bailie Macwheeble.    Then, indeed, the Baron had need of all his greatness of mind. But he  drew a long breath, took snuff abundantly, and remarked that as they had  brought him so far, he would not pass the Colonel's gate, and that he  would be happy to see the new master of his tenants. When he alighted in  front of the Castle, the Baron was astonished to find how swiftly the  marks of spoliation"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22675"],[0,"Home Life in Colonial Days (#15)"],[1,"began to plant their corne, in       which service Squanto stood them in great stead, showing them both       ye manner how to set it, and after, how to dress and tend it.\"    From this planting sprang not only the most useful food, but the first  and most pregnant industry of the colonists.    The first fields and crops were communal, and the result was disastrous.  The third year, at the sight of the paralyzed settlement, Governor  Bradford wisely decided, as did Governor Dale of Virginia, that \"they  should set corne every man for his owne particuler, furnishing a portion  for public officers, fishermen, etc., who could not work, and in that  regard trust to themselves.\" Thus personal energy succeeded to communal  inertia; Bradford wrote that women and children cheerfully worked in the  fields to raise corn which should be their very own.    A field of corn on the coast of Massachusetts or Narragansett or by the  rivers of Virginia, growing long before any white man had ever been seen  on these shores, was precisely like the same field planted three hundred  years later by our American farmers. There was the same planting in  hills, the same number of stalks in the hill, with pumpkin-vines running  among the hills, and beans climbing the stalks. The hills of the Indians  were a trifle nearer together than those of our own day are usually set,  for the native soil was more fertile.    The Indians taught the colonists much more than the planting and raising  of corn; they showed also how to grind the corn and cook it in many  palatable ways. The various foods which we use to-day made from Indian  corn are all cooked just as the Indians cooked them at the time of the  settlement of the country; and they are still called with Indian names,  such as hominy, pone, suppawn, samp, succotash.    The Indian method of preparing maize or corn was to steep or parboil it  in hot water for twelve hours, then to pound the grain in a mortar or a  hollowed stone in the field, till it was a coarse meal. It was then  sifted in a rather closely woven basket, and the large grains which did  not pass through the sieve were again pounded and sifted.    Samp was often pounded in olden times in a primitive and picturesque  Indian mortar made of a hollowed block of wood or a stump of a tree,  which had been cut off about three feet from the ground. The pestle was  a heavy block of wood shaped like the inside of the mortar, and fitted  with a handle attached to one side. This block was fastened to the top  of a young and slender tree, a growing sapling, which was bent over and  thus gave a sort of spring which pulled the pestle up after being  pounded down on the corn. This was called a sweep and mortar mill.    They could be heard at a long distance. Two New Hampshire pioneers made  clearings about a quarter of a mile apart and built houses. There was an  impenetrable gully and thick woods between the cabins; and the blazed  path was a long distance around, so the wives of the settlers seldom saw  each other or any other woman. It was a source of great comfort and  companionship to them both that they could signal to each other every  day by pounding on their mortars. And they had an ingenious system of  communication which one spring morning summoned one to the home of the  other, where she arrived in time to be the first to welcome fine twin  babies.    After these simple stump and sapling mortars were abandoned elsewhere  they were used on Long Island, and it was jestingly told that sailors  in a fog could always know on what shore they were, when they could hear  the pounding of the samp-mortars on Long Island.    Rude hand-mills next were used, which were called quernes, or quarnes.  Some are still in existence and known as samp-mills. Windmills followed,  of which the Indians were much afraid, dreading \"their long arms and  great teeth biting the corn in pieces\"; and thinking some evil spirit  turned the arms. As soon as maize was plentiful, English mills for  grinding meal were started in many towns. There was a windmill at  Watertown, Massachusetts, in 1631. In 1633 the first water-mill, at  Dorchester, was built, and in Ipswich a grist-mill was built in 1635.  The mill built by Governor John Winthrop in New London is still  standing.    The first windmill erected in America was one built and set up by  Governor Yeardley in Virginia in 1621. By 1649 there were five  water-mills, four windmills, and a great number of horse and hand mills  in Virginia. Millers had one-sixth of the meal they ground for toll.    Suppawn was another favorite of the settlers, and was an Indian dish  made from Indian corn; it was a thick corn-meal and milk porridge. It  was soon seen on every Dutch table, for the Dutch were very fond of all  foods made from all kinds of grain; and it is spoken of by all  travellers in early New York, and in the Southern colonies.    Samp and samp porridge were soon abundant dishes. Samp is Indian corn  pounded to a coarsely ground powder. Roger Williams wrote of it:--         \"Nawsamp is a kind of meal pottage unparched. From this the English       call their samp, which is the Indian corn beaten and boiled and       eaten hot or cold with milk and butter, and is a diet exceedingly       wholesome for English bodies.\"    The Swedish scientist, Professor Kalm, told that the Indians gave him  \"fresh maize-bread, baked in an oblong shape, mixed with dried  huckleberries, which lay as close in it as raisins in a plum pudding.\"    Roger Williams said that sukquttahhash was \"corn seethed like beans.\"  Our word \"succotash\" we now apply to corn cooked with beans. Pones were  the red men's appones.    The love of the Indians for \"roasting ears\" was quickly shared by the  white man. In Virginia a series of plantings of corn were made from the  first of April to the last of June, to afford a three months' succession  of roasting ears.    The traveller, Strachey, writing of the Indians in 1618, said: \"They  lap their corn in rowles within the leaves of the come and so boyle yt  for a dayntie.\" This method of cooking we have also retained to the  present day.    It seemed to me very curious to read in Governor Winthrop's journal,  written in Boston about 1630, that when corn was \"parched,\" as he called  it, it turned inside out and was \"white and floury within\"; and to think  that then little English children were at that time learning what  pop-corn was, and how it looked when it was parched, or popped.    Hasty pudding had been made in England of wheat-flour or oatmeal and  milk, and the name was given to boiled puddings of corn-meal and water.  It was not a very suitable name, for corn-meal should never be cooked  hastily, but requires long boiling or baking. The hard Indian pudding  slightly sweetened and boiled in a bag was everywhere made. It was told  that many New England families had three hundred and sixty-five such  puddings in a year.    The virtues of \"jonny-cake\" have been loudly sung in the interesting  pages of _Shepherd Tom_. The way the corn should be carried to the mill,  the manner in which it should be ground, the way in which the stones  should revolve, and the kind of stones, receive minute description, as  does the mixing and the baking, to the latter of which the middle board  of red oak from the head of a flour-barrel is indispensable as a  bakeboard, while the fire to bake with must be of walnut logs. Hasty  pudding, corn dumplings, and corn-meal porridge, so eminently good that  it was ever mentioned with respect in the plural, as \"them porridge,\"  all are described with the exuberant joyousness of a happy, healthful  old age in remembrance of a happy, high-spirited, and healthful youth.    The harvesting of the corn afforded one of the few scenes of gayety in  the lives of the colonists. A diary of one Ames, of Dedham,  Massachusetts, in the year 1767, thus describes a corn-husking, and most  ungallantly says naught of the red ear and attendant osculation:--         \"Made a husking Entertainm't. Possibly this leafe may last a       Century and fall into the hands of some inquisitive Person for       whose Entertainm't I will inform him that now there is a Custom       amongst us of making an Entertainm't at husking of Indian Corn       whereto all the neighboring Swains are invited and after the Corn       is finished they like the Hottentots give three Cheers or huzza's       but cannot carry in the husks without a Rhum bottle; they feign       great Exertion but do nothing till Rhum enlivens them, when all is       done in a trice, then after a hearty Meal about 10 at Night they go       to their pastimes.\"    There was one way of eating corn which was spoken of by all the early  writers and travellers which we should not be very well satisfied with  now, but it shows us how useful and necessary corn was at that time, and  how much all depended on it. This preparation of corn was called nocake  or nookick. An old writer named Wood thus defined it:--         \"It is Indian corn parched in the hot ashes, the ashes being sifted       from it; it is afterwards beaten to powder and put into a long       leatherne bag trussed at the Indian's backe like a knapsacke, out       of which they take three spoonsful a day.\"    It was held to be the most nourishing food known, and in the smallest  and most condensed form. Both Indians and white men usually carried it  in a pouch when they went on long journeys, and mixed it with snow in  the winter and water in summer. Gookin says it was sweet, toothsome, and  hearty. With only this nourishment the Indians could carry loads \"fitter  for elephants than men.\" Roger Williams says a spoonful of this meal and  water made him many a good meal. When we read this we are not surprised  that the Pilgrims could keep alive on what is said was at one time of  famine their food for a day,--five kernels of corn apiece.
