He was a fine-looking man, above seventy years of age,  with iron-grey hair, turning in some places to pure white.  The hunter's  spare though still upright figure showed that he must have been a  powerful man in his youth, and the deeply-marked wrinkles about his  mouth and eyes told eloquently that he was a kind one.  Round his  shoulders were twined the cords of the heavy \"bolas,\" or balls, with  which he sometimes felled, at other times entangled, his prey.  These  balls were covered with clotted blood.  He carried a short gun in his  hand, and a large knife was stuck in his belt.    The dogs that leaped around him were a strange pack--some being very  large, some very small, and all of different breeds.  A few of them had  been lamed, and all were more or less marked by the wounds received from  jaguars and pumas.    \"You expected me, Ignacio?\" said Pedro, after the first greetings were  over.    \"No--not quite so soon, but I chanced to be wandering about in the  mountains, and came down to take a look at the old place, to see that  all was right.  You know I am fond of our old haunts, and never stay  long away from them, but I did not expect to find you here.\"    The hunter spoke in Spanish, and Lawrence found to his satisfaction  that, although he by no means understood all that was said, he had  already improved so much in that tongue through his frequent efforts to  converse with Manuela, that he could follow the drift at least of the  hunter's remarks.    \"I have come back sooner than I intended,\" returned Pedro, \"for war is a  wonderful hastener, as well as dictator, of events; but I have to thank  war for having given me a new friend.  Let me introduce Senhor Lawrence  Armstrong to you; Senhor, my old comrade Ignacio, who, as I have told  you, nursed me back to life many years ago.\"    The old man held out a hard bony hand, and gave Lawrence a hearty  squeeze of friendship that had something vice-like in its vigour.  He  then turned to Pedro, and began to make anxious inquiries about the war.  As the two men spoke in undertones, Lawrence drew back a few paces, and  followed them towards the cottage.  He observed that Ignacio shook his  head very often, and also that he laughed once or twice silently, but  with apparent heartiness.  As he overheard the name of Manuela just  before one of these laughs, he experienced some disagreeable feelings,  which it was not easy to understand or get rid of, so he took to  fondling the hunter's dogs by way of diversion to his mind.    The animals testified indirectly to the character of their master by  receiving his advances with effusive demonstrations of joy.    At the cottage they found Ignacio's horse--a very fine one--with a lasso  hanging from the saddle.  Beside it stood a loose horse with the carcass  of a guanaco flung over it, and a Gaucho lad who was the hunter's only  attendant.  Quashy was engaged in animated conversation with this youth,  and Manuela stood beside him listening.    \"I cannot understand,\" said Lawrence to Pedro, as they approached, \"how  men ever acquire dexterity in the use of these bolas.\"    \"Practice makes perfect, you know,\" said the guide, \"and it doesn't  matter much what sort of weapons you use, if you only learn to use them  well.  Of course it's not easy to a beginner.  When Ignacio's dogs turn  out a jaguar or a puma, they follow him hotly till he stops to defend  himself.  If the dogs fly upon the brute, the hunter usually jumps off  his horse, whirls the three balls about till they get up tremendous  momentum, and then brings them down on the jaguar's skull with a whack  that generally drops him.  But if the dogs are afraid to go at him,  Ignacio throws the lasso over him, gallops away, and drags him over the  ground, while the dogs rush in and tear him.  What between bumping and  hounds, the jaguar's career is soon finished.\"    \"I'm glad I've met you,\" said Pedro to Ignacio, as they turned aside  into the bushes together, \"for I've got news to tell, and I'll want your  help.  There's mischief brewing in the air, and I am commissioned--\"    Thus much did Lawrence and Quashy overhear before the voice died away in  the distance.  It was a tantalising point to stop at!  Lawrence looked  at Quashy and at Manuela, who stood near.    \"Does Manuela know anything of the mischief that is brewing?\" asked  Lawrence in amazing Spanish.    \"Not'ing,\" replied the girl in English, \"but she _trust_ Pedro.\"    \"So do I, with all my heart,\" returned Lawrence; \"my question was  prompted by curiosity, not by doubt.\"    \"I's not so sure,\" said Quashy, with a frown, and a tone of  self-assertion which was rare in him.  \"Nice-lookin' men like him's not  allers as nice as dey looks.\"    \"Fie, Quashy!  I thought you were of a more trustful spirit.\"    \"So I is, massa--awrful trus'ful!  Kin trus' _you_ wid a'most anyt'ing.  Trus' dis yer Injin gal wid untol' gol'.  Trus' Sooz'n wid de whole  world, an' eberyt'ing else besides, but I's not quite so sure about dis  yer Pedro.  Di'n't he say dar's noos to tell, an' he wants help, an'  der's mischif a-brewin'?  An' ain't I sure 'nuff dat he's got suffin to  do wid de mischif, or he wouldn't be so secret?\"    \"Well, Quashy, you'd better not tell Pedro your doubts of him,\" said  Lawrence; \"for if he knocks you down, I won't feel bound to stand up for  you--seeing that I have perfect confidence in him.\"    Further conversation on this point was cut abruptly short by a  tremendous hissing inside the cottage, followed by clouds of steam.  It  was caused by one of Quashy's pots having boiled over.  The negro sprang  to the rescue.  Soon afterwards, the host and the old hunter returning,  they all entered the place together, and sat down to supper.    It was but a simple cottage, suitable to the simple tastes of a  mountaineer in such a region, with only two rooms and a kitchen, besides  a small attic divided into two chambers, which could be reached only by  a ladder through a trap-door.  Little furniture graced it, yet what  little there was bore evidence of having felt the touch of a tasteful  female hand.  Numerous nails and pegs were stuck in the walls for the  purpose of supporting fire-arms, etcetera, but the weapons had been  secreted in a place of safety, for, during the owner's frequent and long  absences from home, the cottage was locked up and left pretty much to  take care of itself, being deemed safe enough, owing to its remote and  lonely position.    The key was always left in charge of old Ignacio who was understood to  have his eye on the place, and privileged to inhabit it whenever he  chose.    All this, and a great deal more, Pedro told to Lawrence as they sat  round the table at supper in what used to be the parlour of the  establishment.  \"But I'm going to lock it up, and hide the key this  time,\" he continued; \"because I have to send Ignacio on urgent matters  into the eastern parts of Bolivia, to--\"    \"To git help, an' tell de noos about de mischif what's a-brewin',\" said  the negro abruptly, with a pointed stare at the guide, and an arrested  potato on the end of his fork.    \"You've learnt your lesson well, Quashy,\" returned Pedro, with a  good-humoured smile, as he helped himself to a fresh supply of meat;  \"these are the very words--to obtain help and spread the news about the  mischief that's brewing.  Pass the salt, like a good fellow, and help  Manuela to some more maize.  You're forgetting your manners, boy.\"    The negro heaved a sigh of discomfiture, and did as he was bid.    Next morning at daybreak they left the cottage, and descended the  intricate valley which led to it.  Pedro seemed to have quite subdued  his feelings--at least all outward manifestation of them--for he was  sterner and more silent than usual as they resumed their journey.  For  some distance their route and that of Ignacio lay in the same direction,  but towards the afternoon of the same day on which they left Mariquita  Cottage the old hunter bade the party adieu, and, accompanied by his  Gaucho lad and his dogs, entered a north-easterly defile of the hills,  and disappeared.    \"We shall soon get to more cultivated lands, Manuela,\" said Pedro, in  the Indian tongue, glancing back at Lawrence, who rode a few paces  behind.  \"I doubt not you will be glad to see female faces again.\"    To the surprise of the guide, Manuela said that she did not care!    \"Indeed!\" he rejoined; \"I thought you would be getting tired by this  time of such rough travelling, and frequent hard lodging and fare, as  well as of the conversation of us men.\"    \"No, I am not tired.  I delight in this wild, free life.\"    \"Surely not because it is _new_ to you,\" said Pedro, with a glance of  amusement; \"when you dwell with your kindred, your life must be wild  enough--unless indeed the great chief, your father, deems it beneath the  dignity of his daughter to join in the sports of her fellows.\"    Manuela made no reply, but for a moment or two gave vent to that clear,  short, merry laugh in which she sometimes indulged.  Lawrence Armstrong,  irresistibly charmed by the sound, rode up alongside.    \"Manuela is merry,\" he said to the guide; \"will you not translate, that  I may enjoy the joke?\"    \"It is not easy to translate,\" replied Pedro.  \"In fact, I doubt if you  will see the joke at all.  It requires a little knowledge of Manuela's  past career to make understanding possible.  She only said that she  delighted in this wild, free life.\"    \"Not much jest in that, truly,\" returned Lawrence, \"being, I fear, dull  of comprehension; nevertheless, I see an unintentional compliment to  _us_ in the remark, for it implies that we have not made Manuela's  journey tedious to her.\"    \"It may be so,\" said Pedro, simply.  \"I was just telling her that we  shall soon get to more inhabited parts of the land, where she"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21721"],[0,"The Coral Island (#15)"],[1,"walking along the beach towards us with a little pig  transfixed on the end of his long spear!    \"Well done, my boy!\" exclaimed Jack, slapping him on the shoulder when  he came up.  \"You're the best shot amongst us.\"    \"Look here, Jack!\" cried Peterkin as he disengaged the animal from his  spear.  \"Do you recognise that hole?\" said he, pointing to the pig's  ear; \"and are you familiar with this arrow, eh?\"    \"Well, I declare!\" said Jack.    \"Of course you do,\" interrupted Peterkin; \"but, pray, restrain your  declarations at this time, and let's have supper--for I'm uncommonly  hungry, I can tell you.  And it's no joke to charge a whole herd of  swine with their great-grandmother bristling like a giant porcupine, at  the head of them!\"    We now set about preparing supper; and, truly, a good display of viands  we made when all was laid out on a flat rock in the light of the blazing  fire.  There was, first of all, the little pig; then there were the  taro-root, and the yam, and the potato, and six plums; and lastly, the  wood-pigeon.  To these Peterkin added a bit of sugar-cane, which he had  cut from a little patch of that plant which he had found not long after  separating from us; \"and,\" said he, \"the patch was somewhat in a square  form, which convinces me it must have been planted by man.\"    \"Very likely,\" replied Jack.  \"From all we have seen, I'm inclined to  think that some of the savages must have dwelt here long ago.\"    We found no small difficulty in making up our minds how we were to cook  the pig.  None of us had ever cut up one before, and we did not know  exactly how to begin; besides, we had nothing but the axe to do it with,  our knife having been forgotten.  At last Jack started up and said:    \"Don't let us waste more time talking about it, boys.--Hold it up,  Peterkin.  There, lay the hind leg on this block of wood--so;\" and he  cut it off; with a large portion of the haunch, at a single blow of the  axe.  \"Now the other--that's it.\"  And having thus cut off the two hind  legs, he made several deep gashes in them, thrust a sharp-pointed stick  through each, and stuck them up before the blaze to roast.  The  wood-pigeon was then split open, quite flat, washed clean in salt water,  and treated in a similar manner.  While these were cooking we scraped a  hole in the sand and ashes under the fire, into which we put our  vegetables and covered them up.    The taro-root was of an oval shape, about ten inches long and four or  five thick.  It was of a mottled-grey colour, and had a thick rind.  We  found it somewhat like an Irish potato, and exceedingly good.  The yam  was roundish, and had a rough brown skin.  It was very sweet and well  flavoured.  The potato, we were surprised to find, was quite sweet and  exceedingly palatable, as also were the plums--and, indeed, the pork and  pigeon too--when we came to taste them.  Altogether, this was decidedly  the most luxurious supper we had enjoyed for many a day.  Jack said it  was out-of-sight better than we ever got on board ship; and Peterkin  said he feared that if we should remain long on the island he would  infallibly become a glutton or an epicure, whereat Jack remarked that he  need not fear that, for he was both already!  And so, having eaten our  fill, not forgetting to finish off with a plum, we laid ourselves  comfortably down to sleep, upon a couch of branches, under the  overhanging ledge of a coral rock.        CHAPTER ELEVEN.    EFFECTS OF OVEREATING, AND REFLECTIONS THEREON--HUMBLE ADVICE REGARDING  COLD WATER--THE \"HORRIBLE CRY\" ACCOUNTED FOR--THE CURIOUS BIRDS CALLED  PENGUINS--PECULIARITY OF THE COCOA-NUT PALM--QUESTIONS ON THE FORMATION  OF CORAL ISLANDS--MYSTERIOUS FOOTSTEPS--STRANGE DISCOVERIES AND SAD  SIGHTS.    When we awoke on the following morning we found that the sun was already  a good way above the horizon, so I came to the conclusion that a heavy  supper is not conducive to early rising.  Never-the-less, we felt  remarkably strong and well, and much disposed to have our breakfast.  First, however, we had our customary morning bathe, which refreshed us  greatly.    I have often wondered very much in after years that the inhabitants of  my own dear land did not make more frequent use of this most charming  element, water--I mean in the way of cold bathing.  Of course, I have  perceived that it is not convenient for them to go into the sea or the  rivers in winter, as we used to do on the Coral Island; but then I knew  from experience that a large washing-tub and a sponge do form a most  pleasant substitute.  The feelings of freshness, of cleanliness, of  vigour, and extreme hilarity that always followed my bathes in the sea--  and even, when in England, my ablutions in the wash-tub--were so  delightful that I would sooner have gone without my breakfast than  without my bathe in cold water.  My readers will forgive me for asking  whether they are in the habit of bathing thus every morning; and if they  answer \"No\", they will pardon me for recommending them to begin at once.  Of late years, since retiring from the stirring life of adventure which  I have led so long in foreign climes, I have heard of a system called  the cold-water cure.  Now, I do not know much about that system; so I do  not mean to uphold it, neither do I intend to run it down.  Perhaps, in  reference to it, I may just hint that there may be too much of a good  thing--I know not.  But of this I am quite certain, that there may also  be too little of a good thing; and the great delight I have had in cold  bathing during the course of my adventurous career inclines me to think  that it is better to risk taking too much than to content one's self  with too little.  Such is my opinion, derived from much experience; but  I put it before my readers with the utmost diffidence and with profound  modesty, knowing that it may possibly jar with their feelings of  confidence in their own ability to know and judge as to what is best and  fittest in reference to their own affairs.  But to return from this  digression, for which I humbly crave forgiveness.    We had not advanced on our journey much above a mile or so, and were  just beginning to feel the pleasant glow that usually accompanies  vigorous exercise, when, on turning a point that revealed to us a new  and beautiful cluster of islands, we were suddenly arrested by the  appalling cry which had so alarmed us a few nights before.  But this  time we were by no means so much alarmed as on the previous occasion,  because, whereas at that time it was night, now it was day; and I have  always found, though I am unable to account for it, that daylight  banishes many of the fears that are apt to assail us in the dark.    On hearing the sound, Peterkin instantly threw forward his spear.    \"Now, what can it be?\" said he, looking round at Jack.  \"I tell you what  it is: if we are to go on being pulled up in a constant state of horror  and astonishment, as we have been for the last week, the sooner we're  out o' this island the better, notwithstanding the yams and lemonade,  and pork and plums!\"    Peterkin's remark was followed by a repetition of the cry, louder than  before.    \"It comes from one of these islands,\" said Jack.    \"It must be the ghost of a jackass, then,\" said Peterkin, \"for I never  heard anything so like.\"    We all turned our eyes towards the cluster of islands, where, on the  largest, we observed curious objects moving on the shore.    \"Soldiers they are--that's flat!\" cried Peterkin, gazing at them in the  utmost amazement.    And, in truth, Peterkin's remark seemed to me to be correct; for at the  distance from which we saw them, they appeared to be an army of  soldiers.  There they stood, rank and file, in lines and in squares,  marching and counter-marching, with blue coats and white trousers.  While we were looking at them the dreadful cry came again over the  water, and Peterkin suggested that it must be a regiment sent out to  massacre the natives in cold blood.  At this remark Jack laughed and  said:    \"Why, Peterkin, they are penguins!\"    \"Penguins?\" repeated Peterkin.    \"Ay, penguins, Peterkin, penguins--nothing more or less than big  sea-birds, as you shall see one of these days when we pay them a visit  in our boat, which I mean to set about building the moment we return to  our bower.\"    \"So, then, our dreadful yelling ghosts and our murdering army of  soldiers,\" remarked Peterkin, \"have dwindled down to penguins--big  sea-birds!  Very good.  Then I propose that we continue our journey as  fast as possible, lest our island should be converted into a dream  before we get completely round it.\"    Now, as we continued on our way, I pondered much over this new discovery  and the singular appearance of these birds, of which Jack could only  give us a very slight and vague account; and I began to long to commence  our boat, in order that we might go and inspect them more narrowly.  But  by degrees these thoughts left me, and I began to be much taken up again  with the interesting peculiarities of the country which we were passing  through.    The second night we passed in a manner somewhat similar to the first--at  about two-thirds of the way round the island, as we calculated--and we  hoped to sleep on the night following at our bower.  I will not here  note so particularly all that we said and saw during the course of this  second day, as we did not make any further discoveries of great  importance.  The shore along which we travelled, and the various parts  of the woods through which we passed, were similar to those which have  been already treated of.  There were one or two observations that we  made, however, and these were as follows:    We saw that, while many of the large fruit-bearing trees grew only in  the valleys, and some of them only near the banks of the streams, where  the soil was peculiarly rich, the cocoa-nut palm grew in every place  whatsoever--not only"]]]
