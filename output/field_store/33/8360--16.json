That  was not the course which we pursued, and it is one which I trust no  British Government ever will pursue. We had but one object in view, and  that was to take care that at this most critical period the affairs of  her Majesty in South Africa should be directed by one not only qualified  to direct them, but who was superior to any other individual whom we  could have selected for that purpose. The sole question that we really  have to decide to-night is, Was it the duty of her Majesty's Government  to recall Sir Bartle Frere in consequence of his having declared war  without our consent? We did not think it our duty to take that course,  and we do not think it our duty to take that course now. Whether we are  right in the determination at which we have arrived is the sole question  which the House has to determine upon the motion before it.    \"The noble duke opposite (the Duke of Somerset) has told us that he  should not be contented without being made acquainted with the whole  policy which her Majesty's Government are prepared to pursue in  South Africa. If the noble duke will introduce that subject we shall  be happy to discuss it with him. No one could introduce it in a more  interesting, and, indeed, in a more entertaining manner than the  noble duke, who possesses that sarcastic faculty that so well  qualifies him to express his opinion on such a matter. I think,  however, that we ought to have had rather longer notice before we  were called upon to discuss so large a theme, which has now been  brought suddenly before us. If the noble marquis who introduced this  subject had given us notice of a motion of this character, we should  not have hesitated for a moment to meet it. I have, however, no  desire to avoid discussing the subject of our future policy in South  Africa, even on so general a notice as we have in reference to it  from the noble duke. Sir Bartle Frere was selected by the noble lord  (Lord Carnarvon), who formerly occupied the position of Secretary to  the Colonies, chiefly to secure one great end--namely, to carry out  that policy of confederation in South Africa which the noble lord  had successfully carried out on a previous occasion with regard to  the North American Colonies.    \"If there is any policy which, in my mind, is opposed to the policy  of annexation, it is that of confederation. By pursuing the policy  of confederation we bind States together, we consolidate their  resources, and we enable them to establish a strong frontier; and  where we have a strong frontier, that is the best security against  annexation. I myself regard a policy of annexation with great  distrust. I believe that the reasons of State which induced us to  annex the Transvaal were not, on the whole, perfectly sound. But  what were the circumstances under which that annexation was  effected? The Transvaal was a territory which was no longer defended  by its occupiers. The noble lord opposite (Lord Kimberley), who  formerly had the Colonies under his management, spoke of the conduct  of Sir Theophilus Shepstone as though he had not taken due  precautions to effect the annexation of that province, and said that  he was not justified in concealing that he had not successfully  consummated his object. The noble lord said he had not assembled  troops enough in the province to carry out properly the policy of  annexation. But Sir Theophilus Shepstone particularly refers to the  very fact to show, that so unanimous and so united was the sentiment  in the province in favour of annexation, that it was unnecessary to  send any large force there to bring it about. _The annexation of  that province was a necessity--a geographical necessity._\"    [Illustration: Sir HENRY BARTLE FRERE, Bart.

London.]      TOWARDS ULUNDI    It may be remembered that Lord Chelmsford's original idea had been  for Colonel Pearson's column to march from Eshowe to the chief's  kraal at Ulundi. In consequence of the disaster, however, Colonel  Pearson decided to remain where he was. He constructed a fort for  the protection of the garrison against an army of some 20,000 Zulus  lying in wait between Eshowe and Tugela. On the 30th of January all  the troops came within this embryo fort, and as tents were  forbidden, officers and men had to make the best of what shelter the  waggons afforded. The troops spent the time in completing the fort  and cutting roads, and early in February excellent defences were  completed. Though in hourly expectation of attack they seem to have  kept up their spirits, for an officer in Eshowe wrote:--    \"The troops inside consisted of three companies of the 99th  Regiment, five companies of the second battalion of the 3rd Buffs,  one company of Royal Engineers, one company of the Pioneers, the  Naval Brigade, a body of Artillery, and nineteen of the Native  Contingent, amongst them being several non-commissioned officers,  whom we found exceedingly useful, two of them being at once selected  as butchers, whilst two were 'promoted' to the rank of 'bakers to  the troops.' Others attended to the sanitary arrangements of the  garrison, and altogether they were found to be also exceedingly  useful. As a portion of the column, the company of Pioneers under  the command of Captain Beddoes did a great deal of very important  work. This company was composed of ninety-eight natives, one  captain, and three lieutenants, and their proceedings in connection  with the making of the new road were watched with much interest.  They worked with the Naval Brigade, about three companies of  soldiers, and several men of the Royal Artillery. This road was  found useless, in consequence of the numerous swampy places at the  foot of each of the numerous hills which occurred along the route.  Very thick bush had to be cut through, and at first but slow  progress was made. The road, as is generally known, took a direction  towards the Inyezane. Whilst out on one occasion, the road party saw  a torpedo explosion which took place about three miles from where  the party was working. It had been accidentally fired by Kaffirs,  who were unaware of the clangers connected with the implement, and  it is believed that several of them were killed. The road was  altogether a bad one. The relief column used it on their way up, but  only the Pioneers and the mounted men went by that route on the way  back. In fact, it would have been useless to have attempted to use  it for the passage of waggons. Whenever the road party went out they  were fired on by Kaffirs, but of course shots were returned, and  many a Zulu warrior was knocked over whilst the work was being  proceeded with. Everything in camp was conducted in a most orderly  manner. We were roused at half-past five sharp, and at eight  o'clock, sharp, lights were out. For one month we existed very  comfortably on full rations, but at the end of that time we were put  on short rations, made up as follows:--One pound and a quarter of  trek-oxen beef, six ounces of meal, one ounce and a quarter of  sugar, third of an ounce of coffee, one sixth of an ounce of tea,  one ninth of an ounce of pepper, and a quarter of an ounce of salt.    \"Life of course was very monotonous. The bands of the two regiments  played on alternate afternoons, and every morning they were to be  heard practising outside the entrenchment. The most pleasant part of  the day was just after six o'clock, when we used to be enlivened in  the cool of the evening by the fife and drum band playing the  'Retreat.' The water with which we were supplied was indeed  excellent, and the bathing places, I need not say, were very  extensively patronised. The grazing was not nearly sufficient for  the cattle, and from the first they must have suffered very much  from want of nourishment. You will have heard of the fate of the  eleven hundred head of oxen and the span of donkeys which we sent  away from the camp in expectation of their reaching the Lower  Tugela. They left us in charge of nineteen Kaffirs, but at the  Inyezane they were attacked by a large body of Kaffirs. The natives  in charge of the cattle decamped and reached the fort in safety, and  the enemy got possession of the whole of the cattle, which they  drove off. The donkeys were all killed with the exception of one,  and this sagacious animal surprised everybody in camp by returning  soon after the Kaffirs had come back.\"    The prices of food at this time were scarcely in keeping with those  of the London market. A bottle of pickles fetched 25s., and a ham  L7, 10s.! Milk was purchasable for 23s. a tin, and sardines for 12s.    As may be imagined, the arrival of Lord Chelmsford at Eshowe was a  matter for general thanksgiving. One who was present records in  _Blackwood's Magazine_ the joy on the arrival of the first  outsiders: \"On the afternoon of the 3rd of April, the column  detailed on the 31st of March (about 500 whites and 50 blacks, and  the mounted infantry, with one gun) left the fort under General  Pearson, to meet the relief column.... A solitary horseman was seen  towards 5 P.M. galloping up the new road to the fort. He had an  officer's coat on, and we could see a sword dangling from his side.  Who is he?... He proved to be the correspondent of the _Standard_.  'First in Eshowe,' he said, 'proud to shake hands with an Eshowian.'  A second horseman appeared approaching the fort, his horse  apparently much blown, Who is he?... The correspondent of the  _Argus_ (Cape Town). They had a race who would be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23748"],[0,"History of the United States, Volume 3 (#15)"],[1,", law, and, to an extent, even in justice. Both  sides could rightly appeal to the Constitution, the deep, irrepressible  antagonism of freedom against bondage having there its seat. The very  existence of the Constitution presupposed that each section should  respect the institutions of the other. What right, then, had the North  to allow publications confessedly intended to destroy a legal southern  institution, deeply rooted and cherished? From a merely constitutional  point of view this question was no less proper than the other: What  right had the South, among much else, to enact laws putting in prison  northern citizens of color absolutely without indictment, when, as  sailors, they touched at southern ports, and keeping them there till  their ships sailed?   This outrage had occurred repeatedly. What was  worse, when Messrs. Hoar and Hubbard visited Charleston and New Orleans,  respectively, to bring amicable suits that should go to the Supreme  Court and there decide the legality of such detention, they were obliged  to withdraw to escape personal violence.    It was said that the North must bear these incidents of slavery, so  obnoxious to it, in deference to our complex political system. Yes, but  it was equally the South's duty to bear the, to it, obnoxious incidents  of freedom. Southern men seem never to have thought of this. Doubtless,  as emancipation in any style would have afflicted it, the South could  not but account all incitements thereto as hardships; but the North must  have suffered hardships, if less gross and tangible, yet more real and  galling, had it acceded to southern wishes touching liberty of person,  speech, and the press. That at the North which offended the South was of  the very soul and essence of free government; that at the South which  aggrieved the North was, however important, certainly somewhat less  essential. Manifestly, considerations other than legal or constitutional  needed to be invoked in order to a decision of the case upon its merits,  and these, had they been judicially weighed, must, it would seem, all  have told powerfully against slavery. Not to raise the question whether  the black was a man, with the inalienable rights mentioned in the  Declaration of Independence, the South's own economic and moral weal,  and further--what one would suppose should alone have determined the  question--its social peace and political stability loudly demanded  every possible effort and device for the extirpation of slavery. That  this would have been difficult all must admit; that it was intrinsically  possible the examples of Cuba and Brazil since sufficiently prove.      [Illustration: Map of the United Staes and Territories.]        CHAPTER III.    THE MEXICAN WAR    [1836]    Attracted by fertility of soil and advantages for cattle-raising, large  numbers of Americans had long been emigrating to Texas. By 1830 they  probably comprised a majority of its inhabitants. March 2, 1836, Texas  declared its independence of Mexico, and on April 10th of that year  fought in defence of the same the decisive battle of San Jacinto. Here  Houston gained a complete victory over Santa Anna, the Mexican  President, captured him, and extorted his signature to a treaty  acknowledging Texan independence. This, however, as having been forced,  the Mexican Government would not ratify.    [1845]    Not only did the Texans almost to a man wish annexation to our Union,  but, as we have seen, the dominant wing of the democratic party in the  Union itself was bent upon the same, forcing a demand for this into  their national platform in 1840. Van Buren did not favor it, which was  the sole reason why he forfeited to Polk the democratic nomination in  1844. Polk was elected by free-soil votes cast for Birney, which, had  Clay received them, would have carried New York and Michigan for him and  thus elected him; but the result was hailed as indorsing annexation.  Calhoun, Tyler's Secretary of State, more influential than any other one  man in bringing it about, therefore now advocated it more zealously than  ever. Calhoun's purpose in this was to balance the immense growth of the  North by adding to southern territory Texas, which would of course  become a slave State, and perhaps in time make several States. As the  war progressed he grew moderate, out of fear that the South's show of  territorial greed would give the North just excuse for sectional  measures.      [Illustration: Portrait.]  General Sam. Houston.      Henry Clay, with nearly the entire Whig Party, from the first opposed  the Tyler-Calhoun programme. Clay's own reason for this, as his  memorable Lexington speech in 1847 disclosed, was that the United States  would be looked upon \"as actuated by a spirit of rapacity and an  inordinate desire for territorial aggrandizement.\" His party as a whole  dreaded more the increment which would come to the slave power. After  much discussion in Congress, Texas was annexed to the Union on January  25, 1845, just previous to Polk's accession. June 18th, the Texan  Congress unanimously assented, its act being ratified July 4th by a  popular convention. Thus were added to the United States 376,133 square  miles of territory.      [Illustration: Portrait.]  General Santa Anna.      The all-absorbing question now was where Texas ended: at the Nueces, as  Mexico declared, or at the Rio Grande, as Texas itself had maintained,  insisting upon that stream as of old the bourne between Spanish America  and the French Louisiana. Mexico, proud, had recognized neither the  independence of Texas nor its annexation by the United States, yet would  probably have agreed to both as preferable to war, had the alternative  been allowed. To be sure, she was dilatory in settling admitted claims  for certain depredations upon our commerce, threatened to take the  annexation as a casus belli, withdrew her envoy and declined to accept  Slidell as ours, and precipitated the first actual bloodshed. Yet war  might have been averted, and our Government, not Mexico's, was to blame  for the contrary result. Slidell played the bully, the navy threatened  the coast, our wholly deficient title, through Texas, to the  Nueces-Rio-Grande tract was assumed without the slightest ado to be  good, and when General Arista, having crossed the river in Taylor's  vicinity, repelled the latter's attack upon him, the President, followed  by Congress, falsely alleged war to exist \"by act of the Republic of  Mexico.\"    [1846]    During most of 1845, General Zachary Taylor was at Corpus Christi on the  west bank of the Nueces, in command of 3,600 men. The first aggressive  movement occurred in March of the following year, when Taylor, invading  the disputed territory by command from Washington, advanced to the Rio  Grande, opposite Matamoras. April 26th, a Mexican force crossed the  river and captured a party of American dragoons which attacked them.  Taylor drew back to establish communication with Point Isabel, and on  advancing again toward the Rio Grande, May 8th, found before him a  Mexican force of nearly twice his numbers, commanded by Arista. The  battle of Palo Alto ensued, and next day that of Resaca de la Palma,  Taylor completely victorious in both. May 13th, before knowledge of  these actions had reached Washington, warranted merely by news of the  cavalry skirmish on April 26th, Congress declared war, and the President  immediately called for 50,000 volunteers. In July Taylor was re-enforced  by Worth, and proceeded to organize a campaign against Monterey, a  strongly fortified town some ninety miles toward the City of Mexico.  This place was reached September 19th, and captured on the 22d, after  hard fighting and severe losses on both sides. An armistice of eight  weeks followed.      [Illustration: Portrait.]  James K. Polk, after a photograph by Brady.      [Illustration: Map.]  PLAN OF THE BATTLE OF BUENA VISTA MORNING 23 OF FEB 1847.      [1847]    Meantime a revolution had occurred in Mexico. The banished Santa Anna  was recalled, and as President of the Republic assumed command of the  Mexican armies. On February 23, 1847, occurred one of the most  sanguinary but brilliant battles of the war, that of Buena Vista.  Taylor, learning that a Mexican force was advancing under Santa Anna, at  least double the 5,200 left him after the requisition upon him which  General Scott had just made, drew back to the strong position of Buena  Vista, south of Saltillo. Here Santa Anna, having through an intercepted  despatch learned of Taylor's weakness, ferociously fell upon him with a  force 12,000 strong. On right and centre, by dint of good tactics and  bull-dog fighting, Taylor held his own and more, but the foe succeeded  at first in partly turning and pushing back his left. The Mexican  commander bade Taylor surrender, but was refused, whence the saying that  \"Old Rough and Ready,\" as they called Taylor, \"was whipped but didn't  know it.\"    To check the flanking movement he sent forward two regiments of  infantry, well supported by dragoons and artillery, who charged the  advancing mass, broke the Mexicans' column, and sent them fleeing in  confusion. This saved the day. The American loss was 746, including  several officers, among them Lieutenant-Colonel Clay, son of the  Kentucky statesman. Colonel Jefferson Davis, one day to be President of  the Southern Confederacy, caused during this conflict great havoc in the  enemy's ranks with his Mississippi riflemen. Santa Anna's loss was  2,000.      [Illustration: Portrait.]  General Winfield Scott.      General Winfield Scott had meantime been ordered to Mexico as chief in  command. Taylor was a Whig, and the Whigs whispered that his martial  deeds were making the democratic cabinet dread him as a presidential  candidate.
