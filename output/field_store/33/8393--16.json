Those who were suspected of  taking part in the siege, or of belonging to Clarke's command, were  seized and hanged out of hand. Old men, no longer able to bear arms,  were imprisoned for welcoming the return of members of their families  who had fought on the American side. One instance out of many that  might be cited was the arrest of the father of Captains Samuel and  James Alexander. In the seventy-eighth year of his age, this old man  was arrested at his home, tied to the tail of a cart, and dragged forty  miles in two days. When caught leaning against the cart to rest his  feeble limbs, he was whipped by the driver. It was at this time that  in the region round about Augusta the hopes of the patriots grew very  faint. The women and children assembled, and begged Elijah Clarke to  take them out of the country; and in response to the appeals of these  defenseless ones, he undertook the movement that culminated in the  glorious victory of Kings Mountain.    [Illustration: Old man whipped at the tail of a cart 111]    The winter of 1780 was the darkest hour of the Revolution in Upper  Georgia. There was no trade. Farming was at a low ebb. The schoolhouses  were closed. Many of the patriots had carried off their families.  Many had gone with Elijah Clarke to Kentucky. The patriots had betaken  themselves to South Carolina, though the services they rendered there  have been slurred over by the historians of that State.    When General Greene began his Southern campaign, and gradually rid South  Carolina of the British and the Tory element, the patriots of Upper  Georgia ventured to return to their homes. Captain McCall, who was among  them, says, in his history, that they returned in parties of ten and  twelve, so as to attract as little attention as possible. They appointed  Dennis's Mill, on Little River, as a place of meeting. \"When these small  parties entered the settlements where they had formerly lived,\" says  Captain McCall, \"general devastation was presented to view; their aged  fathers and their youthful brothers had been murdered; their decrepit  grandfathers were incarcerated in prisons where most of them had been  suffered to perish in filth, famine, or disease; and their mothers,  wives, sisters, and young children had been robbed, insulted, and  abused, and were found by them in temporary huts more resembling a  savage camp than a civilized habitation.\" Though Captain McCall was  an eyewitness of some of the scenes he describes, the picture he draws  might seem to be too highly colored were it not supplemented by a great  mass of evidence. One more instance out of many may be given. In a  skirmish with the Americans under Colonel Harden, Brown captured several  prisoners. Among them was a youth only seventeen years old named Rannal  McKay, the son of a widow who was a refugee from Darien. Being told that  her son was a prisoner in the hands of Brown, Widow McKay, providing  herself with some refreshments that she thought might suit the taste of  the British commander, went to Brown's headquarters, and begged that  her son might be set free. The cruel wretch accepted the present she  had brought him, but refused even to let her see her son, and caused the  sentinels to put her out of the camp by force. Next day young McKay and  four other prisoners were taken out of the rail pen in which they had  been confined. By Brown's order they were hanged upon a gallows until  they were nearly strangled. They were then cut down and turned over to  the tender mercies of the Indians, by whom they were mutilated, scalped,  and finally murdered in the most savage manner.    The cruelty of Colonel Brown and the Tories acting under him was so  unbearable that the patriots of that region felt that their existence  depended on the capture of Augusta. They decided on an aggressive  movement when they met again at Dennis's Mill, on Little River.    Colonel Clarke, who was suffering from the results of smallpox, was  too feeble to lead them. His place was taken for the time by Lieutenant  Colonel Micajah Williamson; and on the 16th of April, 1781, the  Americans moved to the vicinity of Augusta. They were there reenforced  by a detachment from southern Georgia under Colonel Baker, and by a  number of recruits from Burke County. A few days afterwards they were  joined by some Carolina militiamen under Colonel Hammond and Major  Jackson.    With this force, Colonel Williamson took up a position twelve hundred  yards from the British works, and fortified his camp. The Americans were  compelled to wait nearly a month for the aid they expected from General  Greene. The militia, worn out with waiting for the reenforcements, were  about to withdraw from the camp in despair, when Jackson, that truly  great Georgian, made them an address full of the most passionate and  patriotic eloquence, and this appeal changed their purpose. Jackson's  voice was afterwards heard in the halls of Congress; but we may be sure  that he was never more in earnest or more truly eloquent than when he  pleaded with the faint-hearted Americans to stand to their cause and  their arms. Jackson's address revived their courage; and when, on  the 15th of May, Elijah Clarke rode into camp, restored to health  and accompanied by one hundred fresh recruits, the confidence of the  militiamen was fully renewed.    It was at this time that General Pickens and \"Light Horse Harry\" Lee  (the father of General Robert E. Lee) were ordered by General Greene to  march on Augusta and capture that post When Lee reached the neighborhood  of Augusta, he learned, from a party of light horse which he had sent on  ahead to collect prisoners and gain information, that the annual royal  present intended for the Indians had arrived at Fort Galphin, some  distance below Augusta. The present comprised blankets, liquor, salt,  small arms, powder, and ball. There was a great lack of these articles  in the American camp, and Lee resolved to capture them. The supplies  were so valuable, that Brown, the British commander, had sent two  companies from Augusta to garrison Fort Galphin. This was the situation  when \"Light Horse Harry\" arrived on the ground. The British in Augusta  had not yet discovered his approach, and promptness was necessary.  Leaving Eaton's battalion, the artillery, and the footsore men of the  legion, to follow more slowly, Lee mounted a detachment of infantry  behind his dragoons, and made a forced march to Fort Galphin.    This point he reached on the 21st of May, 1781. The weather was  extremely hot, and for miles the troopers and their horses had been  unable to find a drop of water: consequently neither the men nor the  animals were in a condition to make the attack when the command was  brought to a halt under the pines that skirted the field surrounding  the fort. The British within the fort were resting quietly, and were  not aware that an enemy was at hand. A prompt and decisive movement was  necessary; and when his men and horses had rested a little while, Lee  dismounted the militiamen he had brought with him, and ordered them to  make a demonstration against the fort on the side opposite the position  he had taken. This famous commander reasoned, that, as soon as the  militiamen appeared before the fort, the garrison would sally from the  stockade. The militia would retreat, the garrison pursuing, and he would  seize upon that moment to assault and capture the post left defenseless.  To carry out this plan, Captain Rudolph (who was supposed to be some  great general in disguise), with a detachment of picked infantry, was  held in readiness to rush upon the fort; while the rest of the troops,  supported by the dragoons, were placed where they could shield the  militia from the pursuit of the British.    The affair took place just as Lee had foreseen. The garrison sallied out  to the attack. The militia, before making a show of resistance, began  a retreat. The garrison gave pursuit. Captain Rudolph dashed across the  field, and captured the fort without any trouble, The end came, when the  militia rallied, and the foot soldiers and dragoons closed around the  soldiers of the garrison. During the engagement the Americans lost one  man from sunstroke. The enemy lost only three or four men. The rest,  together with the valuable stores in the stockade, fell into the hands  of the patriots.    Following this successful affair, which was of more importance than it  seems now to be, Lee formed a junction with General Pickens; and these  two then joined their forces with those of Clarke, who commanded the  Georgia militia, and the siege of Augusta began. The first movement  was the capture of Fort Grierson, so called in honor of the man who  commanded its garrison. Grierson, hard pressed, threw open the gates of  the fort, and endeavored to escape. Thirty of his men were killed, and  forty-five wounded and captured. Grierson was made a prisoner, but was  killed by a Georgia rifleman. He was as cruel and vindictive as Brown  himself. He was a monster who had made himself odious to the followers  of Clarke. In his history, Captain McCall strongly hints that Grierson  was shot by one of the sons of the aged Mr. Alexander, who had been made  prisoner and dragged to Augusta tied to the tail of a cart. A reward  was offered for information that would lead to the arrest of the man who  shot Grierson, but the reward was never claimed. The whole army probably  knew who had fired the fatal shot, and no doubt the commanders knew,  but their knowledge was not official. No further notice was taken of the  matter.    The capture of Fort Grierson cheered the hearts of the besiegers, and  gave them renewed courage. Fort Cornwallis was next invested. This  stronghold was commanded by Colonel Brown himself, who was as bold as  he was cruel.

The chamber where each one slept was shaken by the  noise. Neither Thor nor Loki nor the lad Thialfi slept that night.    In the morning they left the five-chambered house and turned their faces  toward the mountain. It was not a mountain at all, but a Giant. He was  lying on the ground when they saw him, but just then he rolled over and  sat up. \"Little men, little men,\" he shouted to them, \"have you passed  by a glove of mine on your way?\" He stood up and looked all around him.  \"Ho, I see my glove now,\" he said. Thor and Loki and the lad Thialfi  stood still as the Giant came toward them. He leaned over and picked up  the five-roomed shelter they had slept in. He put it on his hand. It was  really his glove!    Thor gripped his hammer, and Loki and the lad Thialfi stood behind him.  But the Giant seemed good-humored enough. \"Where might ye be bound for,  little men?\" said he.    \"To Utgard in Joetunheim,\" Thor replied boldly.    \"Oh, to that place,\" said the Giant. \"Come, then, I shall be with ye so  far. You can call me Skyrmir.\"    \"Can you give us breakfast?\" said Thor. He spoke crossly, for he did not  want it to appear that there was any reason to be afraid of the Giant.    \"I can give you breakfast,\" said Skyrmir, \"but I don't want to stop to  eat now. We'll sit down as soon as I have an appetite. Come along now.  Here is my wallet to carry. It has my provisions in it.\"    He gave Thor his wallet. Thor put it on his back and put Thialfi sitting  upon it. On and on the Giant strode and Thor and Loki were barely able  to keep up with him. It was midday before he showed any signs of halting  to take breakfast.    They came to an enormous tree. Under it Skyrmir sat down. \"I'll sleep  before I eat,\" he said, \"but you can open my wallet, my little men, and  make your meal out of it.\" Saying this, he stretched himself out, and in  a few minutes Thor and Loki and the lad Thialfi heard the same sounds as  kept them awake the night before, sounds that were like forests moaning  and cataracts falling. It was Skyrmir's snoring.    Thor and Loki and the lad Thialfi were too hungry now to be disturbed by  these tremendous noises. Thor tried to open the wallet, but he found it  was not easy to undo the knots. Then Loki tried to open it. In spite of  all Loki's cunning he could not undo the knots. Then Thor took the  wallet from him and tried to break the knots by main strength. Not even  Thor's strength could break them. He threw the wallet down in his rage.    The snoring of Skyrmir became louder and louder. Thor stood up in his  rage. He grasped Mioelnir and flung it at the head of the sleeping Giant.    The hammer struck him on the head. But Skyrmir only stirred in his  sleep. \"Did a leaf fall on my head?\" he said.    He turned round on the other side and went to sleep again. The hammer  came back to Thor's hand. As soon as Skyrmir snored he flung it again,  aiming at the Giant's forehead. It struck there. The Giant opened his  eyes. \"Has an acorn fallen on my forehead?\" he said.    Again he went to sleep. But now Thor, terribly roused, stood over his  head with the hammer held in his hands. He struck him on the forehead.  It was the greatest blow that Thor had ever dealt.    \"A bird is pecking at my forehead--there is no chance to sleep here,\"  said Skyrmir, sitting up. \"And you, little men, did you have breakfast  yet? Toss over my wallet to me and I shall give you some provision.\" The  lad Thialfi brought him the wallet. Skyrmir opened it, took out his  provisions, and gave a share to Thor and Loki and the lad Thialfi. Thor  would not take provision from him, but Loki and the lad Thialfi took it  and ate. When the meal was finished Skyrmir rose up and said, \"Time for  us to be going toward Utgard.\"    As they went on their way Skyrmir talked to Loki. \"I always feel very  small when I go into Utgard,\" he said. \"You see, I'm such a small and a  weak fellow and the folk who live there are so big and powerful. But you  and your friends will be welcomed in Utgard. They will be sure to make  little pets of you.\"    And then he left them and they went into Utgard, the City of the Giants.  Giants were going up and down in the streets. They were not so huge as  Skyrmir would have them believe, Loki noticed.    Utgard was the Asgard of the Giants. But in its buildings there was not  a line of the beauty that there was in the palaces of the Gods,  Gladsheim and Breidablik or Fensalir. Huge but shapeless the buildings  arose, like mountains or icebergs. O beautiful Asgard with the dome  above it of the deepest blue! Asgard with the clouds around it heaped up  like mountains of diamonds! Asgard with its Rainbow Bridge and its  glittering gates! O beautiful Asgard, could it be indeed that these  Giants would one day overthrow you?    Thor and Loki with the lad Thialfi went to the palace of the King. The  hammer that Thor gripped would, they knew, make them safe even there.  They passed between rows of Giant guards and came to the King's seat.  \"We know you, Thor and Loki,\" said the Giant King, \"and we know that  Thor has come to Utgard to try his strength against the Giants. We shall  have a contest tomorrow. Today there are sports for our boys. If your  young servant should like to try his swiftness against our youths, let  him enter the race today.\"    Now Thialfi was the best runner in Midgard and all the time he had been  with them Loki and Thor had trained him in quickness. And so Thialfi was  not fearful of racing against the Giants' youths.    The King called on one named Hugi and placed him against Thialfi. The  pair started together. Thialfi sped off. Loki and Thor watched the race  anxiously, for they thought it would be well for them if they had a  triumph over the dwellers in Utgard in the first contest. But they saw  Hugi leave Thialfi behind. They saw the Giant youth reach the winning  post, circle round it, and come back to the starting place before  Thialfi had reached the end of the course.    Thialfi, who did not know how it was that he had been beaten, asked that  he be let run the race with Hugi again. The pair started off once more,  and this time it did not seem to Thor and Loki that Hugi had left the  starting place at all--he was back there almost as soon as the race had  started.    They came back from the racing ground to the palace. The Giant King and  his friends with Thor and Loki sat down to the supper table. \"Tomorrow,\"  said the King, \"we shall have our great contest when Asa Thor will show  us his power. Have you of Asgard ever heard of one who would enter a  contest in eating? We might have a contest in eating at this supper  board if we could get one who would match himself with Logi here. He can  eat more than anyone in Joetunheim.\"    \"And I,\" said Loki, \"can eat more than any two in Joetunheim. I will  match myself against your Logi.\"    \"Good!\" said the Giant King. And all the Giants present said, \"Good!  This will be a sight worth seeing.\"    Then they put scores of plates along one side of the table, each plate  filled with meat. Loki began at one end and Logi began at the other.  They started to eat, moving toward each other as each cleared a plate.  Plate after plate was emptied, and Thor standing by with the Giants was  amazed to see how much Loki ate. But Logi on the other side was leaving  plate after plate emptied. At last the two stood together with scores of  plates on each side of them. \"He has not defeated me,\" cried Loki. \"I  have cleared as many plates as your champion, O King of the Giants.\"    \"But you have not cleared them so well,\" said the King.    \"Loki has eaten all the meat that was upon them,\" said Thor.    \"But Logi has eaten the bones with the meat,\" said the Giant King. \"Look  and see if it be not so.\"    Thor went to the plates. Where Loki had eaten, the bones were left on  the plates. Where Logi had eaten, nothing was left: bones as well as  meat were consumed, and all the plates were left bare.    \"We are beaten,\" said Thor to Loki.    \"Tomorrow, Thor,\" said Loki, \"you must show all your strength or the  Giants will cease to dread the might of the Dwellers in Asgard.\"    \"Be not afraid,\" said Thor. \"No one in Joetunheim will triumph over me.\"    The next day Thor and Loki came into the great hall of Utgard. The Giant  King was there with a throng of his friends. Thor marched into the hall  with Mioelnir, his great hammer, in his hands. \"Our young men have been  drinking out of this horn,\" said the King, \"and they want to know if  you, Asa Thor, would drink out of it a morning draught. But I must tell  you that they think that no one of the AEsir could empty the horn at one  draught.\"    \"Give it to me,\" said Thor. \"There is no horn you can hand me that I  cannot empty at a draught.\"    A great horn, brimmed and flowing, was brought over to him. Handing  Mioelnir to Loki and bidding him stand so that he might keep the hammer  in sight, Thor raised the horn to his mouth. He drank and drank. He felt  sure there was not a drop left in the horn as he laid it on the ground.  \"There,\" he gasped, \"your Giant horn is drained.\"    The Giants looked within the horn and laughed. \"Drained, Asa Thor!\" said  the Giant King. \"Look into the horn again. You have hardly drunk below  the brim.\"    And Thor looked into it and saw that the horn was not half emptied. In a  mighty rage he lifted it to his lips again. He drank and drank and  drank. Then, satisfied that he had emptied it to the bottom, he left the  horn on the ground and walked over to the other side of the hall.    \"Thor thinks he has drained the horn,\" said one of the Giants, lifting  it up. \"But see, friends, what remains in it.\"    Thor strode back and looked again into the horn. It was still half  filled. He turned round to see that all the Giants were laughing at him.    \"Asa Thor, Asa Thor,\" said the Giant King, \"we know not how you "]]]
