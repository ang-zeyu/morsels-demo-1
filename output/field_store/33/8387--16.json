Moreover, he hoped to gain him over, for the  pope had sent Cardinal Campeggio to London, to hold, with his legate  Wolsey, a court to hear the case. But it was the farthest from his  intention to grant the divorce, for the pope was more afraid of  Charles V. than he was of Henry VIII.    [Sidenote: Disgrace and Death of Wolsey.]    The court settled nothing, and the king's wrath now turned towards  Wolsey, whom he suspected of secretly thwarting his measures. The  accomplished courtier, so long accustomed to the smiles and favors of  royalty, could not bear his disgrace with dignity. The proudest man in  England became, all at once, the meanest. He wept, he cringed, he lost  his spirits; he surrendered his palace, his treasures, his honors, and  his offices, into the hands of him who gave them to him, without a  single expostulation: wrote most abject letters to \"his most gracious,  most merciful, and most pious sovereign lord;\" and died of a broken  heart on his way to a prison and the scaffold. \"Had I but served my  God as diligently as I have served the king, he would not have given  me over in my gray hairs\"--these were the words of the dying cardinal;  his sad confessions on experiencing the vanity of human life. But the  vindictive prince suffered no word of sorrow or regret to escape him,  when he heard of the death of his prime minister, and his intimate  friend for twenty years.    [Sidenote: More--Cranmer--Cromwell.]    Shortly after the disgrace of Wolsey, which happened nearly a year  before his death, (1529,) three remarkable men began to figure in  English politics and history. These were Sir Thomas More, Thomas  Cranmer, and Thomas Cromwell. More was the most accomplished, most  learned, and most enlightened of the three. He was a Catholic, but  very exemplary in his life, and charitable in his views. In moral  elevation of character, and beautiful serenity of soul, the annals of  the great men of his country furnish no superior. His extensive  erudition and moral integrity alone secured him the official station  which Wolsey held as lord chancellor. He was always the intimate  friend of the king, and his conversation, so enlivened by wit, and so  rich and varied in matter, caused his society to be universally  sought. He discharged his duties with singular conscientiousness and  ability; and no one ever had cause to complain that justice was not  rendered him.    Cranmer's elevation was owing to a fortunate circumstance,  notwithstanding his exalted merit. He happened to say, while tutor to  a gentleman of the name of Cressy, in the hearing of Dr. Gardiner,  then secretary to Henry, that the proper way to settle the difficulty  about the divorce was, to appeal to learned men, who would settle the  matter on the sole authority of the Bible, without reference to the  pope. This remark was reported to the king, and Cranmer was sent to  reside with the father of Anne Boleyn, and was employed in writing a  treatise to support his opinion. His ability led to further honors,  until, on the death of Warham, archbishop of Canterbury, he was  appointed to the vacant see, the first office in dignity and  importance in the kingdom, and from which no king, however absolute,  could eject him, except by the loss of life. We shall see that, in all  matters of religion, Cranmer was the ruling spirit in England until  the accession of Mary.    Cromwell's origin was even more obscure than that of Wolsey's; but he  received his education at one of the universities. We first hear of  him as a clerk in an English factory at Antwerp, then as a soldier in  the army of the Constable Bourbon when it sacked Rome, then as a clerk  in a mercantile house in Venice, and then again as a lawyer in  England, where he attracted the attention of Wolsey, who made him his  solicitor, and employed him in the dissolution of monasteries. He then  became a member of the house of commons, where his address and  business talents were conspicuous. He was well received at court, and  confirmed in the stewardship of the monasteries, after the disgrace of  his master. His office brought him often into personal conference with  the king; and, at one of these, he recommended him to deny the  authority of the pope altogether, and declare himself supreme head of  the church. The boldness of this advice was congenial to the temper of  the king, worried by the opposition of Rome to his intended divorce,  and Cromwell became a member of the privy council. His fortune was  thus made by his seasonable advice. All who opposed the king were sure  to fall, and all who favored him were sure to rise, as must ever be  the case in an absolute monarchy, where the king is the centre and the  fountain of all honor and dignity.    With such ministers as Cranmer and Cromwell, the measures of Henry  were now prompt and bold. Queen Catharine was soon disposed of; she  was divorced and disgraced, and Anne Boleyn was elevated to her  throne, (1533.) The anathemas of the pope and the outcry of all Europe  followed. Sir Thomas More resigned the seals, and retired to poverty  and solitude. But he was not permitted to enjoy his retirement long.  Refusing to take the oath of supremacy to Henry, as head of the church  as well as of the state, he was executed, with other illustrious  Catholics. The execution of More was the most cruel and uncalled-for  act of the whole reign, and entailed on its author the execrations of  all the learned and virtuous men in Europe, most of whom appreciated  the transcendent excellences of the murdered chancellor, the author of  the Utopia, and the Boethius of his age.    [Sidenote: Quarrel with the Pope.]    The fulminations of the pope only excited Henry to more decided  opposition. The parliament, controlled by Cromwell, acknowledged him  as the supreme head of the Church of England, and the separation from  Rome was final and irrevocable. The tenths were annexed to the crown,  and the bishops took a new oath of supremacy.    The independence of the Church of England, effected in 1535, was  followed by important consequences, and was the first step to the  reformation, afterwards perfected by Edward VI. But as the first acts  of the reformation were prompted by political considerations, the  reformers in England, during the reign of Henry VIII., should be  considered chiefly in a political point of view. The separation from  Rome, during the reign of this prince, was not followed by the  abolition of the Roman Catholic worship, nor any of the rites and  ceremonies of that church. Nor was religious toleration secured. Every  thing was subservient to the royal conscience, and a secular, instead  of an ecclesiastical pope, still reigned in England.    [Sidenote: Abolition of Monasteries.]    Henry soon found that his new position, as head of the English Church,  imposed new duties and cares: he therefore established a separate  department for the conduct of ecclesiastical affairs, over which he  placed the unscrupulous, but energetic Cromwell--a fit minister to  such a monarch. A layman, who hated the clergy, and who looked solely  to the pecuniary interests of his master, was thus placed over the  highest prelates of the church. But Cromwell, in consulting the  pecuniary interests of the king, also had an eye to the political  interests of the kingdom. He was a sagacious and practical man of the  world, and was disgusted with the vices of the clergy, and especially  with the custom of sending money to Rome, in the shape of annates and  taxes. This evil he remedied, which tended greatly to enrich the  country, for the popes at this time were peculiarly extortionate. He  then turned his attention to the reform of the whole monastic  institution, but with an eye also to its entire destruction. Cromwell  hated the monks. They were lazy, ignorant, and debauched. They were a  great burden on the people, and were as insolent and proud as they  were idle and profligate. The country swarmed with them. The roads,  taverns, and the houses of the credulous were infested with them.  Cranmer, who sympathized with the German reformers, hated them on  religious grounds, and readily cooeperated with Cromwell; while the  king, whose extortion and rapacity knew no bounds, listened, with  glistening eye, to the suggestions of his two favorite ministers. The  nation was suddenly astounded with the intelligence that parliament  had passed a bill, giving to the king and his heirs all the monastic  establishments in the kingdom, which did not exceed two hundred pounds  a year. Three hundred and eighty thus fell at a blow, whereby the king  was enriched by thirty-two thousand pounds a year, and one hundred  thousand pounds ready money--an immense sum in that age. By this  spoliation, perhaps called for, but exceedingly unjust and harsh, and  in violation of all the rights of property, thousands were reduced to  beggary and misery, while there was scarcely an eminent man in the  kingdom who did not come in for a share of the plunder. Vast grants of  lands were bestowed by the king on his favorites and courtiers, in  order to appease the nation; and thus the foundations of many of the  great estates of the English nobility were laid. The spoliations,  however, led to many serious riots and insurrections, especially in  Lincolnshire. At one place there were forty thousand rebels under  arms; but they were easily suppressed.    [Sidenote: Suppression of Monasteries.]    The rapacious king was not satisfied with the plunder he had secured,  and, in 1539, the final suppression of all the monasteries in England  was decreed.

He accordingly did so. Dame  Berchta came again, and taking pity on him, commanded one of her  children to restore his sight. The child went and blew once more through  the chink, and the boy saw. Berchta, however, and her weird troop he saw  not; but the food set out for them had disappeared.[42]    The tradition of the goddess Hertha lingered until recently, and  perchance lingers still, in the island of Ruegen. She had her dwelling,  it is believed, in the Herthaburg; and often yet, in the clear  moonlight, out of the forest which enfolds that hill, a fair lady comes  surrounded by her maids to bathe in the lake at its foot. After awhile  they emerge from the waters, and, wrapt again in their long white veils,  they vanish flickering among the trees. But to the belated wanderer, if  any such there be, who looks upon this scene, it is a vision of dread;  for he is drawn by irresistible might to the lake wherein the white lady  is bathing, to be swallowed up in its depths. And it is said that every  year the lady must lure one unhappy mortal into the flood. So in the  classic mythology, if Ovid report aright, Actaeon met the fearful fate of  transformation into a stag by \"gazing on divinity disrobed,\" and was  torn in pieces by his own hounds. Hertha was, indeed, according to  Tacitus, more terrible than Diana, since death was the penalty even when  duty called her slaves to the awful sight.[43]    These traditions have led us away from the Magical Ointment, which thus  appears to be only one aspect of the larger theme of the objection on  the part of supernatural beings to human prying. Nor need we regret  having strayed; for we are brought naturally to one of the most  interesting of our national legends, namely, that of Lady Godiva; and it  will well repay a little consideration. As generally told to-day it  bears an unmistakable resemblance to the foregoing stories; but there  seems some difficulty in classing it with them, because Peeping Tom is  wanting in the most ancient version known to us.    Godiva, properly Godgifu, was an undoubted historical personage, the  wife of Leofric, Earl of the Mercians, and mother of the Earls Morcar  and Edwin, and of Edith, wife first of Gruffydd, Prince of North Wales,  and afterwards of King Harold the Second. The earliest mention of her  famous ride through Coventry is by Roger of Wendover, who wrote in the  beginning of the thirteenth century, or a hundred and fifty years or  thereabout after her death. His account of the matter is as follows:  \"The countess Godiva, who was a great lover of God's mother, longing to  free the town of Coventry from the oppression of a heavy toll, often  with urgent prayers besought her husband, that from regard to Jesus  Christ and His mother, he would free the town from that service, and  from all other heavy burdens; and when the earl sharply rebuked her for  foolishly asking what was so much to his damage, and always forbade her  evermore to speak to him on the subject; and while she, on the other  hand, with a woman's pertinacity, never ceased to exasperate her husband  on that matter, he at last made her this answer: 'Mount your horse, and  ride naked before all the people, through the market of the town from  one end to the other, and on your return you shall have your request.'  On which Godiva replied: 'But will you give me permission if I am  willing to do it?' 'I will,' said he. Whereupon the countess, beloved of  God, loosed her hair and let down her tresses, which covered the whole  of her body like a veil, and then mounting her horse and attended by two  knights, she rode through the market place without being seen, except  her fair legs; and having completed the journey, she returned with  gladness to her astonished husband, and obtained of him what she had  asked, for Earl Leofric freed the town of Coventry and its inhabitants  from the aforesaid service, and confirmed what he had done by a  charter.\"[44] According to the more modern version, the inhabitants  were enjoined to remain within doors, and, in the Laureate's words:            \"one low churl, compact of thankless earth,      The fatal byword of all years to come,      Boring a little auger-hole in fear,      Peep'd--but his eyes, before they had their will,      Were shrivell'd into darkness in his head,      And dropt before him. So the powers who wait      On noble deeds, cancell'd a sense misus'd.\"    It is not my business now to prove that the legend is untrue in fact, or  I should insist, first, that its omission by previous writers, who refer  both to Leofric and Godgifu and their various good deeds, is strong  negative testimony against it; and I should show, from a calculation  made by the late Mr. M. H. Bloxam, and founded on the record of Domesday  Book, that the population of Coventry in Leofric's time could scarcely  have exceeded three hundred and fifty souls, all in a greater or less  degree of servitude, and dwelling probably in wooden hovels each of a  single story, with a door, but no window.[45] There was, therefore, no  market on the scale contemplated by Roger of Wendover,--hardly, indeed,  a town through which Godgifu could have ridden; and a mere toll would  have been a matter of small moment when the people were all serfs. The  tale, in short, in the form given by the chronicler, could not have been  told until after Coventry had risen to wealth and importance by means of  its monastery, whereof Godgifu and her husband were the founders.  Nobody, however, now asserts that Roger of Wendover's narrative is to be  taken seriously. What therefore I want to point out in it is that  Godgifu's bargain was that she should ride naked _before all the  people_. And this is what the historian understands her to have done;  for he states that she rode through the market-place without being  seen, _except her fair legs_, all the rest of her body being covered by  her hair like a veil. He tells us nothing about a proclamation to the  inhabitants to keep within doors; and of course Peeping Tom is an  impossibility in this version of the tale.    Coventry has for generations honoured its benefactress by a periodical  procession, wherein she is represented by a girl dressed as nearly like  the countess on her ride as the manners of the day have permitted. When  this procession was first instituted, is unknown. The earliest mention  of it seems to be in the year 1678. Its object then was to proclaim the  Great Fair, and Lady Godiva was merely an incident in it. The Lansdowne  MSS. in the British Museum contain an account of a visit to Coventry by  the \"captain, lieutenant, and ancient\" of the military company of  Norwich, who travelled in the Midland Counties in August 1634. These  tourists describe St. Mary's Hall as adorned at the upper end \"with rich  hangings, and all about with fayre pictures, one more especially of a  noble lady (the Lady Godiva) whose memory they have cause not to forget,  for that shee purchas'd and redeem'd their lost infringed liberties and  ffreedomes, and obtained remission of heavy tributes impos'd upon them,  by undertaking a hard and unseemly task, w'ch was to ride naked openly  at high noone day through the city on a milk-white steed, w'ch she  willingly performed, according to her lord's strict injunction. It may  be very well discussed heere whether his hatred or her love exceeded.  Her fayre long hayre did much offend the wanton's glancing eye.\" In this  record we have no additional fact except the mention of \"high noone day\"  as the time of the journey; for the allusion to \"the wanton's glancing  eye\" is too vague to be interpreted of Peeping Tom, and the writer does  not refer to any commemorative procession. It has been supposed,  therefore, that the carnival times of Charles the Second both begot the  procession and tacked Peeping Tom to the legend. But it is more likely  that the procession is as old as the fair, which was held under a  charter of Henry the Third, granted in 1217. Such pageants were not  uncommon in municipal life, and were everywhere to the taste of the  people. Whether Lady Godiva was a primitive part of it is another  question. The mention of the procession in 1678 occurs in a manuscript  volume of annals of the city, in a handwriting of the period. The entry  in question is as follows: \"31 May 1678 being the great Fair at Coventry  there was an extraordinary\" [Here the bottom of the page is reached; and  in turning over the chronicler has omitted a word, for on the top of the  next page we read:] \"Divers of the Companies\" [_i.e._, the City Guilds]  \"set out each a follower, The Mayor Two, and the Sheriffs each one and 2  at the publick charge, there were divers Streamers with the Companies  arms and Ja. Swinnertons Son represented Lady Godiva.\"[46]    This brief entry is by no means free from ambiguity. Perhaps all that we  are warranted in inferring from it is that the annual procession was,  that year, of unusual splendour. Whether, as has been conjectured, it  was the first time Lady Godiva had ever made her appearance, there  seems more doubt. Apart from any evidence, there is no improbability in  supposing that she may have formed part of earlier processions; though  it may be that during the period of Puritan ascendency the show had been  neglected and the lady in particular had been discountenanced. If this  be so, however, it is difficult to account for the manner in which her  figure is referred to by the writer, unless there were some personal  reason connected with James Swinnerton, or his son, undiscoverable by us  at this distance of time.    But whatever doubt may exist as to Godiva's share in the early  processions, there appears no less as to the episode of Peeping Tom.
