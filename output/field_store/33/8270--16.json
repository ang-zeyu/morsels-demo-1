Everybody acknowledged Buck a magnificent  animal, but twenty fifty-pound sacks of flour bulked too large in their  eyes for them to loosen their pouch-strings.    Thornton knelt down by Buck's side. He took his head in his two hands  and rested cheek on cheek. He did not playfully shake him, as was his  wont, or murmur soft love curses; but he whispered in his ear. \"As you  love me, Buck. As you love me,\" was what he whispered. Buck whined with  suppressed eagerness.    The crowd was watching curiously. The affair was growing mysterious. It  seemed like a conjuration. As Thornton got to his feet, Buck seized his  mittened hand between his jaws, pressing in with his teeth and releasing  slowly, half-reluctantly. It was the answer, in terms, not of speech,  but of love. Thornton stepped well back.    \"Now, Buck,\" he said.    Buck tightened the traces, then slacked them for a matter of several  inches. It was the way he had learned.    \"Gee!\" Thornton's voice rang out, sharp in the tense silence.    Buck swung to the right, ending the movement in a plunge that took up  the slack and with a sudden jerk arrested his one hundred and fifty  pounds. The load quivered, and from under the runners arose a crisp  crackling.    \"Haw!\" Thornton commanded.    Buck duplicated the manoeuvre, this time to the left. The crackling  turned into a snapping, the sled pivoting and the runners slipping and  grating several inches to the side. The sled was broken out. Men were  holding their breaths, intensely unconscious of the fact.    \"Now, MUSH!\"    Thornton's command cracked out like a pistol-shot. Buck threw himself  forward, tightening the traces with a jarring lunge. His whole body  was gathered compactly together in the tremendous effort, the muscles  writhing and knotting like live things under the silky fur. His great  chest was low to the ground, his head forward and down, while his  feet were flying like mad, the claws scarring the hard-packed snow in  parallel grooves. The sled swayed and trembled, half-started forward.  One of his feet slipped, and one man groaned aloud. Then the sled  lurched ahead in what appeared a rapid succession of jerks, though it  never really came to a dead stop again...half an inch...an inch... two  inches... The jerks perceptibly diminished; as the sled gained momentum,  he caught them up, till it was moving steadily along.    Men gasped and began to breathe again, unaware that for a moment they  had ceased to breathe. Thornton was running behind, encouraging Buck  with short, cheery words. The distance had been measured off, and as he  neared the pile of firewood which marked the end of the hundred yards,  a cheer began to grow and grow, which burst into a roar as he passed  the firewood and halted at command. Every man was tearing himself loose,  even Matthewson. Hats and mittens were flying in the air. Men were  shaking hands, it did not matter with whom, and bubbling over in a  general incoherent babel.    But Thornton fell on his knees beside Buck. Head was against head,  and he was shaking him back and forth. Those who hurried up heard him  cursing Buck, and he cursed him long and fervently, and softly and  lovingly.    \"Gad, sir! Gad, sir!\" spluttered the Skookum Bench king. \"I'll give you  a thousand for him, sir, a thousand, sir--twelve hundred, sir.\"    Thornton rose to his feet. His eyes were wet. The tears were streaming  frankly down his cheeks. \"Sir,\" he said to the Skookum Bench king, \"no,  sir. You can go to hell, sir. It's the best I can do for you, sir.\"    Buck seized Thornton's hand in his teeth. Thornton shook him back and  forth. As though animated by a common impulse, the onlookers drew back  to a respectful distance; nor were they again indiscreet enough to  interrupt.          Chapter VII. The Sounding of the Call      When Buck earned sixteen hundred dollars in five minutes for John  Thornton, he made it possible for his master to pay off certain debts  and to journey with his partners into the East after a fabled lost mine,  the history of which was as old as the history of the country. Many men  had sought it; few had found it; and more than a few there were who had  never returned from the quest. This lost mine was steeped in tragedy and  shrouded in mystery. No one knew of the first man. The oldest tradition  stopped before it got back to him. From the beginning there had been an  ancient and ramshackle cabin. Dying men had sworn to it, and to the mine  the site of which it marked, clinching their testimony with nuggets that  were unlike any known grade of gold in the Northland.    But no living man had looted this treasure house, and the dead were  dead; wherefore John Thornton and Pete and Hans, with Buck and half a  dozen other dogs, faced into the East on an unknown trail to achieve  where men and dogs as good as themselves had failed. They sledded  seventy miles up the Yukon, swung to the left into the Stewart River,  passed the Mayo and the McQuestion, and held on until the Stewart itself  became a streamlet, threading the upstanding peaks which marked the  backbone of the continent.    John Thornton asked little of man or nature. He was unafraid of the  wild. With a handful of salt and a rifle he could plunge into the  wilderness and fare wherever he pleased and as long as he pleased. Being  in no haste, Indian fashion, he hunted his dinner in the course of the  day's travel; and if he failed to find it, like the Indian, he kept on  travelling, secure in the knowledge that sooner or later he would come  to it. So, on this great journey into the East, straight meat was the  bill of fare, ammunition and tools principally made up the load on the  sled, and the time-card was drawn upon the limitless future.    To Buck it was boundless delight, this hunting, fishing, and indefinite  wandering through strange places. For weeks at a time they would hold  on steadily, day after day; and for weeks upon end they would camp, here  and there, the dogs loafing and the men burning holes through frozen  muck and gravel and washing countless pans of dirt by the heat of the  fire. Sometimes they went hungry, sometimes they feasted riotously, all  according to the abundance of game and the fortune of hunting. Summer  arrived, and dogs and men packed on their backs, rafted across blue  mountain lakes, and descended or ascended unknown rivers in slender  boats whipsawed from the standing forest.    The months came and went, and back and forth they twisted through the  uncharted vastness, where no men were and yet where men had been if  the Lost Cabin were true. They went across divides in summer blizzards,  shivered under the midnight sun on naked mountains between the timber  line and the eternal snows, dropped into summer valleys amid swarming  gnats and flies, and in the shadows of glaciers picked strawberries and  flowers as ripe and fair as any the Southland could boast. In the fall  of the year they penetrated a weird lake country, sad and silent,  where wildfowl had been, but where then there was no life nor sign of  life--only the blowing of chill winds, the forming of ice in sheltered  places, and the melancholy rippling of waves on lonely beaches.    And through another winter they wandered on the obliterated trails of  men who had gone before. Once, they came upon a path blazed through the  forest, an ancient path, and the Lost Cabin seemed very near. But the  path began nowhere and ended nowhere, and it remained mystery, as the  man who made it and the reason he made it remained mystery. Another time  they chanced upon the time-graven wreckage of a hunting lodge, and  amid the shreds of rotted blankets John Thornton found a long-barrelled  flint-lock. He knew it for a Hudson Bay Company gun of the young days  in the Northwest, when such a gun was worth its height in beaver skins  packed flat, And that was all--no hint as to the man who in an early day  had reared the lodge and left the gun among the blankets.    Spring came on once more, and at the end of all their wandering they  found, not the Lost Cabin, but a shallow placer in a broad valley where  the gold showed like yellow butter across the bottom of the washing-pan.  They sought no farther. Each day they worked earned them thousands of  dollars in clean dust and nuggets, and they worked every day. The gold  was sacked in moose-hide bags, fifty pounds to the bag, and piled  like so much firewood outside the spruce-bough lodge. Like giants they  toiled, days flashing on the heels of days like dreams as they heaped  the treasure up.    There was nothing for the dogs to do, save the hauling in of meat now  and again that Thornton killed, and Buck spent long hours musing by  the fire. The vision of the short-legged hairy man came to him more  frequently, now that there was little work to be done; and often,  blinking by the fire, Buck wandered with him in that other world which  he remembered.    The salient thing of this other world seemed fear. When he watched the  hairy man sleeping by the fire, head between his knees and hands  clasped above, Buck saw that he slept restlessly, with many starts and  awakenings, at which times he would peer fearfully into the darkness  and fling more wood upon the fire. Did they walk by the beach of a sea,  where the hairy man gathered shellfish and ate them as he gathered,  it was with eyes that roved everywhere for hidden danger and with legs  prepared to run like the wind at its first appearance. Through the  forest they crept noiselessly, Buck at the hairy man's heels; and they  were alert and vigilant, the pair of them, ears twitching and moving and  nostrils quivering, for the man heard and smelled as keenly as Buck. The  hairy man could spring up into the trees and travel ahead as fast as on  the ground, swinging by the arms from limb to limb, sometimes a dozen  feet apart, letting go and catching, never falling, never missing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21511"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Priory Church of St. Bartholomew-the-Great, Smithfield (#15)"],[1,"apel.

A volume such as that on Canterbury is exactly  what we want, and on our next visit we hope to have it with us. It is  thoroughly helpful, and the views of the fair city and its noble  cathedral are beautiful. Both volumes, moreover, will serve more than a  temporary purpose, and are trustworthy as well as delightful.\"--_Notes  and Queries._    \"We have so frequently in these columns urged the want of cheap,  well-illustrated, and well-written handbooks to our cathedrals, to take  the place of the out-of-date publications of local booksellers, that we  are glad to hear that they have been taken in hand by Messrs. George  Bell & Sons.\"--_St. James's Gazette._    \"The volumes are handy in size, moderate in price, well illustrated, and  written in a scholarly spirit. The history of cathedral and city is  intelligently set forth and accompanied by a descriptive survey of the  building in all its detail. The illustrations are copious and well  selected, and the series bids fair to become an indispensable companion  to the cathedral tourist in England.\"--_Times._    \"They are nicely produced in good type, on good paper, and contain  numerous illustrations, are well written, and very cheap. We should  imagine architects and students of architecture will be sure to buy the  series as they appear, for they contain in brief much valuable  information.\"--_British Architect._    \"Bell's 'Cathedral Series,' so admirably edited, is more than a  description of the various English cathedrals. It will be a valuable  historical record, and a work of much service also to the architect. The  illustrations are well selected, and in many cases not mere bald  architectural drawings but reproductions of exquisite stone fancies,  touched in their treatment by fancy and guided by art.\"--_Star._    \"Each of them contains exactly that amount of information which the  intelligent visitor, who is not a specialist, will wish to have. The  disposition of the various parts is judiciously proportioned, and the  style is very readable. The illustrations supply a further important  feature; they are both numerous and good. A series which cannot fail to  be welcomed by all who are interested in the ecclesiastical buildings of  England.\"--_Glasgow Herald._    \"Those who, either for purposes of professional study or for a cultured  recreation, find it expedient to 'do' the English cathedrals will  welcome the beginning of Bell's 'Cathedral Series.' This set of books is  an attempt to consult, more closely, and in greater detail than the  usual guide-books do, the needs of visitors to the cathedral towns. The  series cannot but prove markedly successful. In each book a  business-like description is given of the fabric of the church to which  the volume relates, and an interesting history of the relative diocese.  The books are plentifully illustrated, and are thus made attractive as  well as instructive. They cannot but prove welcome to all classes of  readers interested either in English Church history or in ecclesiastical  architecture.\"--_Scotsman._    \"They have nothing in common with the almost invariably wretched local  guides save portability, and their only competitors in the quality and  quantity of their contents are very expensive and mostly rare works,  each of a size that suggests a packing-case rather than a coat-pocket.  The 'Cathedral Series' are important compilations concerning history,  architecture, and biography, and quite popular enough for such as take  any sincere interest in their subjects.\"--_Sketch._             LONDON: GEORGE BELL AND SONS           *       *       *       *       *      Transcriber's Notes:    1.
