Set eye upon that fellow;    Follow him to mass; may be Antonio,    Although he do account religion    But a school-name, for fashion of the world    May accompany him; or else go inquire out    Delio's confessor, and see if you can bribe    Him to reveal it.  There are a thousand ways    A man might find to trace him; as to know    What fellows haunt the Jews for taking up    Great sums of money, for sure he 's in want;    Or else to go to the picture-makers, and learn    Who bought[130] her picture lately:  some of these    Happily may take.      BOSOLA.            Well, I 'll not freeze i' th' business:    I would see that wretched thing, Antonio,    Above all sights i' th' world.      CARDINAL.                       Do, and be happy.         Exit.      BOSOLA.  This fellow doth breed basilisks in 's eyes,    He 's nothing else but murder; yet he seems    Not to have notice of the duchess' death.    'Tis his cunning:  I must follow his example;    There cannot be a surer way to trace    Than that of an old fox.           [Re-enter JULIA, with a pistol]      JULIA.  So, sir, you are well met.      BOSOLA.                             How Now!      JULIA.  Nay, the doors are fast enough:    Now, sir, I will make you confess your treachery.      BOSOLA.  Treachery!      JULIA.               Yes, confess to me    Which of my women 'twas you hir'd to put    Love-powder into my drink?      BOSOLA.  Love-powder!      JULIA.                 Yes, when I was at Malfi.    Why should I fall in love with such a face else?    I have already suffer'd for thee so much pain,    The only remedy to do me good    Is to kill my longing.      BOSOLA.                 Sure, your pistol holds    Nothing but perfumes or kissing-comfits.[131]    Excellent lady!    You have a pretty way on 't to discover    Your longing.  Come, come, I 'll disarm you,    And arm you thus:  yet this is wondrous strange.      JULIA.  Compare thy form and my eyes together,    You 'll find my love no such great miracle.    Now you 'll say    I am wanton:  this nice modesty in ladies    Is but a troublesome familiar    That haunts them.      BOSOLA.  Know you me, I am a blunt soldier.      JULIA.                                       The better:    Sure, there wants fire where there are no lively sparks    Of roughness.      BOSOLA.  And I want compliment.      JULIA.                           Why, ignorance    In courtship cannot make you do amiss,    If you have a heart to do well.      BOSOLA.                          You are very fair.      JULIA.  Nay, if you lay beauty to my charge,    I must plead unguilty.      BOSOLA.                 Your bright eyes    Carry a quiver of darts in them sharper    Than sun-beams.      JULIA.           You will mar me with commendation,    Put yourself to the charge of courting me,    Whereas now I woo you.      BOSOLA.  [Aside.] I have it, I will work upon this creature.--    Let us grow most amorously familiar:    If the great cardinal now should see me thus,    Would he not count me a villain?      JULIA.  No; he might count me a wanton,    Not lay a scruple of offence on you;    For if I see and steal a diamond,    The fault is not i' th' stone, but in me the thief    That purloins it.  I am sudden with you.    We that are great women of pleasure use to cut off    These uncertain wishes and unquiet longings,    And in an instant join the sweet delight    And the pretty excuse together.  Had you been i' th' street,    Under my chamber-window, even there    I should have courted you.      BOSOLA.  O, you are an excellent lady!      JULIA.  Bid me do somewhat for you presently    To express I love you.      BOSOLA.                 I will; and if you love me,    Fail not to effect it.    The cardinal is grown wondrous melancholy;    Demand the cause, let him not put you off    With feign'd excuse; discover the main ground on 't.      JULIA.  Why would you know this?      BOSOLA.                           I have depended on him,    And I hear that he is fall'n in some disgrace    With the emperor:  if he be, like the mice    That forsake falling houses, I would shift    To other dependance.      JULIA.                You shall not need    Follow the wars:  I 'll be your maintenance.      BOSOLA.  And I your loyal servant:  but I cannot    Leave my calling.      JULIA.             Not leave an ungrateful    General for the love of a sweet lady!    You are like some cannot sleep in feather-beds,    But must have blocks for their pillows.      BOSOLA.                                  Will you do this?      JULIA.  Cunningly.      BOSOLA.  To-morrow I 'll expect th' intelligence.      JULIA.  To-morrow! get you into my cabinet;    You shall have it with you.  Do not delay me,    No more than I do you:  I am like one    That is condemn'd; I have my pardon promis'd,    But I would see it seal'd.  Go, get you in:    You shall see my wind my tongue about his heart    Like a skein of silk.         [Exit BOSOLA.]           [Re-enter CARDINAL]      CARDINAL.              Where are you?           [Enter Servants.]      SERVANTS.                              Here.      CARDINAL.  Let none, upon your lives, have conference    With the Prince Ferdinand, unless I know it.--    [Aside] In this distraction he may reveal    The murder.         [Exeunt Servants.]                 Yond 's my lingering consumption:    I am weary of her, and by any means    Would be quit of.      JULIA.             How now, my lord! what ails you?      CARDINAL.  Nothing.      JULIA.               O, you are much alter'd:    Come, I must be your secretary, and remove    This lead from off your bosom:  what 's the matter?      CARDINAL.  I may not tell you.      JULIA.  Are you so far in love with sorrow    You cannot part with part of it?  Or think you    I cannot love your grace when you are sad    As well as merry?  Or do you suspect    I, that have been a secret to your heart    These many winters, cannot be the same    Unto your tongue?      CARDINAL.          Satisfy thy longing,--    The only way to make thee keep my counsel    Is, not to tell thee.      JULIA.                 Tell your echo this,    Or flatterers, that like echoes still report    What they hear though most imperfect, and not me;    For if that you be true unto yourself,    I 'll know.      CARDINAL.     Will you rack me?      JULIA.                           No, judgment shall    Draw it from you:  it is an equal fault,    To tell one's secrets unto all or none.      CARDINAL.  The first argues folly.      JULIA.  But the last tyranny.      CARDINAL.  Very well:  why, imagine I have committed    Some secret deed which I desire the world    May never hear of.      JULIA.              Therefore may not I know it?    You have conceal'd for me as great a sin    As adultery.  Sir, never was occasion    For perfect trial of my constancy    Till now:  sir, I beseech you----      CARDINAL.                           You 'll repent it.      JULIA.  Never.      CARDINAL.  It hurries thee to ruin:  I 'll not tell thee.    Be well advis'd, and think what danger 'tis    To receive a prince's secrets.  They that do,    Had need have their breasts hoop'd with adamant    To contain them.  I pray thee, yet be satisfi'd;    Examine thine own frailty; 'tis more easy    To tie knots than unloose them.  'Tis a secret    That, like a ling'ring poison, may chance lie    Spread in thy veins, and kill thee seven year hence.      JULIA.  Now you dally with me.      CARDINAL.                       No more; thou shalt know it.    By my appointment the great Duchess of Malfi    And two of her young children, four nights since,    Were strangl'd.      JULIA.           O heaven! sir, what have you done!      CARDINAL.  How now?  How settles this?  Think you your bosom    Will be a grave dark and obscure enough    For such a secret?      JULIA.              You have undone yourself, sir.      CARDINAL.  Why?      JULIA.           It lies not in me to conceal it.      CARDINAL.                                          No?    Come, I will swear you to 't upon this book.      JULIA.  Most religiously.      CARDINAL.                  Kiss it.         [She kisses the book.]    Now you shall never utter it; thy curiosity    Hath undone thee; thou 'rt poison'd with that book.    Because I knew thou couldst not keep my counsel,    I have bound thee to 't by death.           [Re-enter BOSOLA]      BOSOLA.  For pity-sake, hold!      CARDINAL.                      Ha, Bosola!      JULIA.                                      I forgive you    This equal piece of justice you have done;    For I betray'd your counsel to that fellow.    He over-heard it; that was the cause I said    It lay not in me to conceal it.      BOSOLA.  O foolish woman,    Couldst not thou have poison'd him?      JULIA.                               'Tis weakness,    Too much to think what should have been done.  I go,    I know not whither.         [Dies.]      CARDINAL.            Wherefore com'st thou hither?      BOSOLA.  That I might find a great man like yourself,    Not out of his wits, as the Lord Ferdinand,    To remember my service.      CARDINAL.  I 'll have thee hew'd in pieces.      BOSOLA.  Make not yourself such a promise of that life    Which is not yours to dispose of.      CARDINAL.                          Who plac'd thee here?      BOSOLA.  Her lust, as she intended.      CARDINAL.                            Very well:    Now you know me for your fellow-murderer.      BOSOLA.  And wherefore should you lay fair marble colours    Upon your rotten purposes to me?    Unless you imitate some that do plot great treasons,    And when they have done, go hide themselves i' th' grave    Of those were actors in 't?      CARDINAL.                    No more; there is    A fortune attends thee.      BOSOLA.  Shall I go sue to Fortune any longer?    'Tis the fool's pilgrimage. "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22323"],[0,"Impressions of South Africa (#15)"],[1," of the _wistaria_. The third is an arboraceous St.  John's wort (_Hypericum Schimperi_[4]), which I found growing in a  valley of Manicaland, at a height of nearly 4000 feet above the sea. All  three would be great ornaments to a south European shrubbery could they  be induced to bear the climate, which, in the case of the two latter  (for I hardly think the Kafir-boom would suit a colder air), seems not  impossible. In Manicaland, among the mountains which form the eastern  edge of the plateau, the trees are taller, handsomer, and more tropical  in their character, and palms, though of no great height, are sometimes  seen. But not even in the most humid of the valleys and on the lower  spurs of the range, where it sinks into the coast plain, nor along the  swampy banks of the Pungwe River, did I see any tree more than sixty  feet high, and few more than thirty. Neither was there any of that  luxuriant undergrowth which makes some tropical forests, like those at  the foot of the Nilghiri Hills in India or in some of the isles of the  Pacific, so impressive as evidences of the power and ceaseless activity  of nature.    The poverty of the woods in Bechuanaland and Matabililand seems to be  due not merely to the dryness of the soil and to the thin and sandy  character which so often marks it, but also to the constant grass-fires.  The grass is generally short, so that these fires do not kill the trees;  nor does one hear of such great forest conflagrations as are frequent  and ruinous in Western America and by no means unknown in the south of  Cape Colony. But these fires doubtless injure the younger trees  sufficiently to stunt their growth, and this mischief is, of course, all  the greater when an exceptionally dry year occurs. In such years the  grass-fires, then most frequent, may destroy the promise of the wood  over a vast area.    The want of forests in South Africa is one of the greatest misfortunes  of the country, for it makes timber costly; it helps to reduce the  rainfall, and it aggravates the tendency of the rain, when it comes, to  run off rapidly in a sudden freshet. Forests have a powerful influence  upon climate in holding moisture,[5] and not only moisture, but soil  also. In South Africa the violent rain-storms sweep away the surface of  the ground, and prevent the deposition of vegetable mould. Nothing  retains that mould or the soil formed by decomposed rock as well as a  covering of wood and the herbage which the neighbourhood of  comparatively moist woodlands helps to support. It is much to be desired  that in all parts of the country where trees will grow trees should be  planted, and that those which remain should be protected. Unfortunately,  most of the South African trees grow slowly, so where planting has been  attempted it is chiefly foreign sorts that are tried. Among these the  first place belongs to the Australian gums, because they shoot up faster  than any others. One finds them now everywhere, mostly in rows or groups  round a house or a hamlet, but sometimes also in regular plantations.  They have become a conspicuous feature in the landscape of the veldt  plateau, especially in those places where there was no wood, or the  little that existed has been destroyed. Kimberley, for instance, and  Pretoria are beginning to be embowered in groves of eucalyptus; Buluwayo  is following suit; and all over Matabililand and Mashonaland one  discovers in the distance the site of a farm-steading or a store by the  waving tops of the gum-trees. If this goes on these Australian  immigrants will sensibly affect the aspect of the country, just as  already they have affected that of the Riviera in south-eastern France,  of the Campagna of Rome, of the rolling tops of the Nilghiri Hills in  Southern India, from which, unhappily, the far more beautiful ancient  groves (\"sholas\") have now almost disappeared. Besides those gums,  another Australasian tree, the thin-foliaged and unlovely, but  quick-growing \"beefwood,\" has been largely planted at Kimberley and some  other places. The stone-pine of Southern Europe, the cluster-pine  (_Pinus Pinaster_), and the Aleppo or Jerusalem pine (_Pinus  Halepensis_), have all been introduced and seem to do well. The  Australian wattles have been found very useful in helping to fix the  soil on sandy flats, such as those near Cape Town, and the bark of one  species is an important article of commerce in Natal, where (near  Maritzburg, for instance) it grows profusely. But of all the immigrant  trees none is so beautiful as the oak. The Dutch began to plant it round  Cape Town early in the eighteenth century, and it is now one of the  elements which most contribute to the charm of the scenery in this  eminently picturesque south-west corner of the country. Nothing can be  more charming than the long oak avenues which line the streets of  Stellenbosch, for instance; and they help, with the old-fashioned Dutch  houses of that quaint little town, to give a sort of Hobbema flavour to  the foregrounds.    The changes which man has produced in the aspect of countries, by the  trees he plants and the crops he sows, are a curious subject for inquiry  to the geographer and the historian. These changes sometimes take place  very rapidly. In the Hawaiian Islands, for instance, discovered by  Captain Cook little more than a century ago, many of the shrubs which  most abound and give its tone to the landscape have come (and that  mostly not by planting, but spontaneously) from the shores of Asia and  America within the last eighty years. In Egypt most of the trees which  fill the eye in the drive from Cairo to the pyramids were introduced by  Mehemet Ali, so that the banks of the Nile, as we see them, are  different not only from those which Herodotus saw, but even from those  which Napoleon saw. In North Africa the Central American prickly-pear  and the Australian gum make the landscape quite different from that of  Carthaginian or even of Roman times. So South Africa is  changing--changing all the more because many of the immigrant trees  thrive better than the indigenous ones, and are fit for spots where the  latter make but little progress; and in another century the country may  wear an aspect quite unlike that which it now presents.    [Footnote 4: I owe these names to the kindness of the authorities at the  Royal Gardens at Kew, who have been good enough to look through  fifty-four dried specimens which I collected and preserved as well as I  could while travelling through Mashonaland and Basutoland. Eleven of  these fifty-four were pronounced to be species new to science, a fact  which shows how much remains to be done in the way of botanical  exploration.]    [Footnote 5: It has been plausibly suggested that one reason why many  English rivers which were navigable in the tenth century (because we  know that the Northmen traversed them in vessels which had crossed the  German Ocean) but are now too shallow to let a row-boat pass, is to be  found in the destruction of the forests and the draining of the marshes  which the forests sheltered.]          CHAPTER V    PHYSICAL ASPECTS OF THE VARIOUS POLITICAL DIVISIONS      Hitherto I have spoken of South Africa as a natural whole, ignoring its  artificial division into Colonies and States. It may be well to complete  the account of the physical characteristics of the country by giving the  reader some notion of the aspects of each of the political divisions,  and thereby a notion also of their relative importance and resources as  wealth-producing regions.      CAPE COLONY    Cape Colony is a huge territory more than twice as large as the United  Kingdom. But very little of it is available for tillage, and much of it  is too arid even for stock-keeping. The population, including natives,  is only seven to the square mile. Nearly the whole of it is high  country. All along its westerly coast and its southerly coast there is a  strip of low ground bordering the ocean, which in some places is but a  mile or two wide, and in others, where a broad valley opens spreads  backward, giving thirty or forty square miles of tolerably level or  undulating ground. The rich wine and corn district round Stellenbosch  and Paarl and northward towards Malmesbury is such a tract. Behind this  low strip the country rises, sometimes in steep acclivities, up which a  road or railway has to be carried in curves and zigzags, sometimes in  successive terraces, the steps, so to speak, by which the lofty interior  breaks down towards the sea.    Behind these terraces and slopes lies the great tableland described in a  preceding chapter. Though I call it a tableland, it is by no means flat,  for several long, though not lofty, ranges of hills, mostly running east  and west, intersect it. Some tracts are only 2000 feet, others as much  as 5000 feet, above the sea, while the highest hilltops approach 8000  feet. The part of this high country which lies between longitude 20 deg. and  25 deg. E., with the Nieuweld and Sneeuwberg mountains to the north of it,  and the Zwarte Berg to the south, is called the Great Karroo. (The word  is Hottentot, and means a dry or bare place.) It is tolerably level,  excessively dry, with no such thing as a running stream over its huge  expanse of three hundred miles long and half as much wide, nor, indeed,  any moisture, save in a few places shallow pools which almost disappear  in the dry season. The rainfall ranges from five to fifteen inches in  the year. It is therefore virtually a desert, bearing no herbage (except  for a week or two after a rainstorm), and no trees, though there are  plenty of prickly shrubs and small bushes, some of these succulent  enough, when they sprout after the few showers that fall in the summer,  to give good browsing to sheep and goats. The brilliancy of the air, the  warmth of the days, and the coldness of the nights remind one who  traverses the Karroo of the deserts of Western"]]]
