There was a cross standing  here in the year 1256--very likely it was already ancient. In the year  1387 it was ruinous and had to be repaired. It was again repaired or  rebuilt in 1480. Paul's Cross played a very important part in the  Reformation. Here the 'Rood' of Bexley, which was a crucifix where the  eyes and lips were made to move and the people were taught that it was  miraculous, was exposed and broken to pieces: here the famous images of  Walsingham and Ipswich, the object of so many pilgrimages, were brought  to be broken to pieces before the eyes of the people. Here Latimer  preached, a man of the people who could speak to them in a way to make  them understand. Had it not been for the preaching of Latimer and others  like him in plain language, the Reformation would have been an attempt,  and probably a failure, to enforce upon the people the opinions of  certain scholars. Paul's Cross did not perish in the Fire: it was taken  down in the year 1643, or thereabouts, in order to be rebuilt; but this  was not done, and when the Fire destroyed the Cathedral Paul's Cross was  forgotten. Its site may be seen in the churchyard at the N.E. corner of  the choir, marked by a flat stone, but it must be remembered that the  old church was wider but farther south.    On the south side of Paul's Churchyard we pass in succession the  beautiful Chapter House: the Church of St. Gregory and the Deanery.  Close to the western gate are residences for the Canons, south of the  enclosure are the Cathedral Brewhouse and Bakehouse.    Such are some of the buildings in Paul's Churchyard. The Cathedral  establishment supported a great army of priests and people. For many of  them, perhaps for most, there were residences of some kind either within  the enclosure or close beside it. Thus the priests, including Bishop,  Dean, Archdeacons and Canons, a hundred and thirty in number: then there  were the inferior officers: yet persons of consideration and authority,  such as Sacrist, Almoner, Bookbinder, Chief Brewer, Chief Baker, with  all their servants: scribes, messengers, bookbinders, illuminators and  copyists: singing-men and choir boys, and women to keep the church  clean. When we add that the Brewer had to provide 200 gallons of beer a  day, it is obvious that there must have been a good many people  belonging to the Cathedral who lived in the enclosure called the  Churchyard.          26. THE RELIGIOUS HOUSES.      If we take a map of London in the fourteenth century and lay down upon  it all the monasteries and religious Houses that then existed we shall  find twenty, all rich and splendid Foundations, without counting those  of Westminster and the villages within a few miles of London Stone.  These were built for the most part either just within or just without  the City wall. The reason was that the City was less densely populated  near the wall than lower down along the river-side. Every one of these  Societies was possessed of estates in the country and streets and houses  in the City. Every one then retained, besides the monks or friars and  nuns, a whole army of officers and servants. A great monastery provided  employment for a very large number of people. In every separate estate  which belonged to it, the monastery wanted tenant farmers, foresters and  hunters, labourers, stewards and bailiffs, a curate or vicar in charge  of the church and all the officers who are required for the management  of an estate. For the House itself there were wanted first, the service  of the chapel, apart from the singing which was done by the brethren:  the school: the library: lawyers and clerks to administer the estates  and guard the rights and privileges of the House: the brewhouse,  bakehouse, kitchen, cellar, stables, with all the officers and servants  required in a place where everything was made in the house; the  architects, surveyors, carpenters and people wanted to maintain the  buildings. It is not too much to reckon that a fourth part of the  population of London belonged in some way or other to the monasteries,  while these Houses were certainly the best customers for the wines,  silks and spices which were brought to the quays of Queenhithe and  Billingsgate.    [Illustration: BERMONDSEY ABBEY.]    It is generally believed that the monasteries, besides relieving the  sick and poor and teaching the boys and girls, threw open their doors  readily to any poor lad who desired to take the vows of the Order.    [Illustration: RUINS OF GATEWAY OF BERMONDSEY ABBEY.]    All this is a misconception: there were the same difficulties about  relieving the poor as there are with us at the present moment. That is  to say, indiscriminate charity then, as now, turned honest working men  into paupers. This the monks and friars understood very well. They were  therefore careful about their charities. Also in many Houses the school  was allowed to drop into disuse. And as regards the admission of poor  boys it was done only in cases where a boy showed himself quick and  studious. It has been the glory of the Church in all ages that she has  refused to recognise any barrier of birth: but she has also been careful  to preserve her distinctions for those who deserve them. Most of the  brethren in a rich Foundation were of gentle birth and good family. If a  poor boy asked to join a monastery he was lucky if he was allowed to  become one of its servants and to wear its livery. Then his livelihood  was assured. There is every reason to believe that the rule of the  brethren, strict for themselves, was light and easy for their servants.  You may find out for yourselves where the London monasteries were, by  the names of streets now standing on their sites. Thus, following the  line of the wall from the Tower north and west you find St. Katharine's  Dock where stood St. Katharine's Hospital: the Minories marks the House  of the Minorites or Sisters of St. Clare; Great St. Helens is on the  site of St. Helen's Nunnery: Spital Square stands where St. Mary's  Spital formerly received the sick: Blackfriars, Charter House and  Bartholomew's still keep their name: Austin Friars is the name of a  court and the Friars' Church still stands: Whitefriars is still the name  of a street: Grey Friars is Christ's Hospital: the Temple is now the  lawyer's home; part of the Church of the Knights Hospitallers is still  to be seen. Three great Houses, it is true, have left no trace or memory  behind. Eastminster or the Cistercian Abbey of St. Mary of Grace, which  stood north of St. Katharine's, and was a very great and stately place  indeed: the Priory of the Holy Trinity, which stood where is now Duke's  Place, north of the church of St. Catharine Cree: and St. Mary of  Bethlehem, which stood just outside Bishopsgate. The memory of  Bermondsey Abbey and St. Mary Overy on the south side of the river has  also departed, but the church of the latter still stands, the most  beautiful church in London next to Westminster Abbey.    [Illustration: Christ's Hospital]    But besides all these religious Houses employing thousands of people,  there were in the City of London no fewer than 126 parish churches. Many  of the parishes were extremely small--a single street--or half a street:  many of the churches were insignificant: but many were rich and costly  structures, adorned and beautified by the piety of many generations: all  were endowed with funds for the saying of masses for the dead, so that  there were many priests to every parish. Consider these things and you  will understand that the City was filled with ecclesiastics--priests,  friars, servants of the Church: at every corner rose a church: to one  standing on the other bank of the river the City presented a forest of  spires and towers. The church then occupied a far larger part of the  daily life than is now the case even with Catholic countries. All were  expected to attend a daily service: the trade companies went to church  in state: young men belonged to a guild: the ringing of the bells was  never silent: no one could escape, if he desired, from the Church. No  one did desire to escape, because every one belonged to the Church. You  must understand, not only that the Church was so great and rich that it  owned and ruled a very large part of the country, but also that the  people all belonged to the Church: it was part of their life as much as  their daily work, their daily food, their daily rest.          27. MONKS, FRIARS, AND NUNS.      We must not speak of monks indiscriminately as if they were all the  same. There were as many varieties among the Orders as there are sects  among Protestants and as much rivalry and even hatred of one with the  other. Let us learn some of the distinctions among them.    Monks were first introduced into Western Europe in the year 529. There  had long been brotherhoods, hermits, and solitaries in the East, where  they existed before the Christian age. St. Benedict founded at Monte  Casino in Campania a monastery for twelve brethren in that year. The  Benedictines are the most ancient Order: they have also been always the  most learned. The Priory of the Holy Trinity in London was Benedictine.  Several branches sprang out of this Order, mostly founded with the view  of practising greater austerities. Among them were the Carthusians, a  very strict Order--in London they had the Charter House, a name which is  a corruption of Chartreuse, their original House: and the Cistercians,  founded at Citeaux in France--they had Eastminster, or the Abbey of St.  Mary of Grace. All these were monks.    The Augustine, or Austin Friars, pretended to have been founded by  Augustine, but were not constituted until the year 1256. They had the  monastery of Austin Friars in London. There were several branches of  this Order.    There were next the three great Mendicant Orders, Franciscans,  Dominicans, and Carmelites."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2800"],[0,"The Koran (Al-Qur'an) (#15)"],[1,"it up, and given it its expanse;    And the Earth-we have stretched it out like a carpet; and how    smoothly have we spread it forth!    And of everything have we created pairs: that haply ye may reflect.    Fly then to God: I come to you from him a plain warner.    And set not up another god with God: I come to you from him a plain warner.    Even thus came there no apostle to those who flourished before them, but they  exclaimed, \"Sorcerer, or Possessed.\"    Have they made a legacy to one another of this scoff? Yes, they are a rebel  people.    Turn away, then, from them, and thou shalt not incur reproach:    Yet warn them, for, in truth, warning will profit the believers.    I have not created Djinn and men, but that they should worship me:    I require not sustenance from them, neither require I that they feed me:    Verily, God is the sole sustainer: possessed of might: the unshaken!    Therefore to those who injure thee shall be a fate like the fate of    their fellows of old. Let them not challenge me to hasten it.    Woe then to the infidels, because of their threatened day.      _______________________    1 Lit.

Reeling on that day the Heaven shall reel,    And stirring shall the mountains stir.2    And woe, on that day, to those who called the apostles liars,    Who plunged for pastime into vain disputes-    On that day shall they be thrust with thrusting to the fire of Hell:-    \"This is the fire which ye treated as a lie.    What! is this magic, then? or, do ye not see it?    Burn ye therein: bear it patiently or impatiently 'twill be the same to you:  for ye shall assuredly receive the reward of your doings.\"    But mid gardens and delights shall they dwell who have feared God,    Rejoicing in what their Lord hath given them; and that from the pain of hell-  fire hath their Lord preserved them.    \"Eat and drink with healthy enjoyment, in recompense for your deeds.\"    On couches ranged in rows shall they recline; and to the damsels with large  dark eyes will we wed them.    And to those who have believed, whose offspring have followed them in the  faith, will we again unite their offspring; nor of the meed of their works  will we in the least defraud them. Pledged to God is every man for his  actions and their desert.3    And fruits in abundance will we give them, and flesh as they shall desire:    Therein shall they pass to one another the cup which shall engender no light  discourse, no motive to sin:    And youths shall go round among them beautiful as imbedded pearls:    And shall accost one another and ask mutual questions.    \"A time indeed there was,\" will they say, \"when we were full of care as to  the future lot of our families;    But kind hath God been to us, and from the pestilential torment hath he  preserved us;    For, heretofore we called upon Him-and He is the Beneficent, the Merciful.\"    Warn thou, then. For thou by the favour of thy Lord art neither soothsayer  nor possessed.    Will they say, \"A poet! let us await some adverse turn of his fortune?\"    SAY, wait ye, and in sooth I too will wait with you.    Is it their dreams which inspire them with this? or is it that they are a  perverse people?    Will they say, \"He hath forged it (the Koran) himself?\" Nay, rather it is  that they believed not.    Let them then produce a discourse like it, if they speak the Truth.    Were they created by nothing? or were they the creators of themselves?    Created they the Heavens and Earth? Nay, rather, they have no faith.    Hold they thy Lord's treasures? Bear they the rule supreme?    Have they a ladder for hearing the angels? Let any one who hath heard them  bring a clear proof of it.    Hath God daughters and ye sons?    Asketh thou pay of them? they are themselves weighed down with debts.    Have they such a knowledge of the secret things that they can write them  down?    Desire they to lay snares for thee? But the snared ones shall be they who do  not believe.    Have they any God beside God? Glory be to God above what they join with Him.    And should they see a fragment of the heaven falling down, they would say,  \"It is only a dense cloud.\"    Leave them then until they come face to face with the day when they shall  swoon away:    A day in which their snares shall not at all avail them, neither shall they  be helped.    And verily, beside this is there a punishment for the evildoers: but most of  them know it not.    Wait thou patiently the judgment of thy Lord, for thou art in our eye; and  celebrate the praise of thy Lord when thou risest up,    And in the night-season: Praise him when the stars are setting.      _______________________    1 Of the Caaba.    2 Comp.

SURA LVI.-THE INEVITABLE [XLV.]    MECCA.-96 Verses    In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful    WHEN the day that must come shall have come suddenly,1    None shall treat that sudden coming as a lie:    Day that shall abase! Day that shall exalt!    When the earth shall be shaken with a shock,    And the mountains shall be crumbled with a crumbling,    And shall become scattered dust,    And into three bands shall ye be divided:2    Then the people of the right hand3-Oh! how happy shall be the people of the  right hand!    And the people of the left hand-Oh! how wretched shall be the people of the  left hand!    And they who were foremost on earth-the foremost still.4    These are they who shall be brought nigh to God,    In gardens of delight;    A crowd of the former    And few of the latter generations;    On inwrought couches    Reclining on them face to face:    Aye-blooming youths go round about to them    With goblets and ewers and a cup of flowing wine;    Their brows ache not from it, nor fails the sense:    And with such fruits as shall please them best,    And with flesh of such birds, as they shall long for:    And theirs shall be the Houris, with large dark eyes, like pearls  hidden in  their shells,    In recompense of their labours past.    No vain discourse shall they hear therein, nor charge of sin,    But only the cry, \"Peace! Peace!\"    And the people of the right hand-oh! how happy shall be the people of the  right hand!    Amid thornless sidrahs5    And talh6 trees clad with fruit,    And in extended shade,    And by flowing waters,    And with abundant fruits,7    Unfailing, unforbidden,    And on lofty couches.    Of a rare creation have we created the Houris,    And we have made them ever virgins,    Dear to their spouses, of equal age with them,8    For the people of the right hand,    A crowd of the former,    And a crowd of the latter generations.9    But the people of the left hand-oh! how wretched shall be the people of the  left hand!    Amid pestilential10 winds and in scalding water,    And in the shadow of a black smoke,    Not cool, and horrid to behold.11    For they truly, ere this, were blessed with worldly goods,    But persisted in heinous sin,    And were wont to say,    \"What! after we have died, and become dust and bones, shall we be raised?    And our fathers, the men of yore?\"    SAY: Aye, the former and the latter:    Gathered shall they all be for the time of a known day.    Then ye, O ye the erring, the gainsaying,    Shall surely eat of the tree Ez-zakkoum,    And fill your bellies with it,    And thereupon shall ye drink boiling water,    And ye shall drink as the thirsty camel drinketh.    This shall be their repast in the day of reckoning!    We created you, will ye not credit us?12    What think ye? The germs of life13-    Is it ye who create them? or are we their creator?    It is we who have decreed that death should be among you;    Yet are we not thereby hindered14 from replacing you with others, your likes,  or from producing you again in a form which ye know not!    Ye have known the first creation: will ye not then reflect?    What think ye? That which ye sow-    Is it ye who cause its upgrowth, or do we cause it to spring forth?    If we pleased we could so make your harvest dry and brittle that ye would  ever marvel and say,    \"Truly we have been at cost,15 yet are we forbidden harvest.\"    What think ye of the water ye drink?    Is it ye who send it down from the clouds, or send we it down?    Brackish could we make it, if we pleased: will ye not then be thankful?    What think ye?
