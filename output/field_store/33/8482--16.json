Nathan, 8vo. 1763, p. 241.    The cook and the butcher as often lose their credit by meat being  dressed too fresh, as the fishmonger does by fish that has been kept too  long.    Dr. Franklin in his philosophical experiments tells us, that if game or  poultry be killed by ELECTRICITY it will become tender in the twinkling  of an eye, and if it be dressed immediately, will be delicately tender.    During the _sultry_ SUMMER MONTHS, it is almost impossible to procure  meat that is not either tough, or tainted. The former is as improper as  the latter for the unbraced stomachs of relaxed valetudinarians, for  whom, at this season, poultry, stews, &c., and vegetable soups, are the  most suitable food, when the digestive organs are debilitated by the  extreme heat, and profuse perspiration requires an increase of liquid to  restore equilibrium in the constitution.    I have taken much more pains than any of my predecessors, to teach the  young cook how to perform, in the best manner, the common business of  her profession. Being well grounded in the RUDIMENTS of COOKERY, she  will be able to execute the orders that are given her, with ease to  herself, and satisfaction to her employers, and send up a delicious  dinner, with half the usual expense and trouble.    I have endeavoured to lessen the labour of those who wish to be  thoroughly acquainted with their profession; and an attentive perusal of  the following pages will save them much of the irksome drudgery  attending an apprenticeship at the stove: an ordeal so severe, that few  pass it without irreparable injury to their health;[58-*] and many lose  their lives before they learn their business.    To encourage the best performance of the machinery of mastication, the  cook must take care that her dinner is not only well cooked, but that  each dish be sent to table with its proper accompaniments, in the  neatest and most elegant manner.    Remember, to excite the good opinion of the _eye_ is the first step  towards awakening the _appetite_.    Decoration is much more rationally employed in rendering a wholesome,  nutritious dish inviting, than in the elaborate embellishments which are  crowded about trifles and custards.    Endeavour to avoid _over_-dressing roasts and boils, &c. and  _over_-seasoning soups and sauces with salt, pepper, &c.; it is a fault  which cannot be mended.    If your roasts, &c. are a little _under_-done, with the assistance of  the stewpan, the gridiron, or the Dutch oven, you may soon rectify the  mistake made with the spit or the pot.    If _over_-done, the best juices of the meat are evaporated; it will  serve merely to distend the stomach, and if the sensation of hunger be  removed, it is at the price of an indigestion.    The chief business of cookery is to render food easy of digestion, and  to facilitate nutrition. This is most completely accomplished by plain  cookery in perfection; i. e. neither _over_ nor _under_-done.    With all your care, you will not get much credit by cooking to  perfection, if more than _one dish goes to table at a time_.    To be eaten in perfection, the interval between meat being taken out of  the stewpan and its being put into the mouth, must be as short as  possible; but ceremony, that most formidable enemy to good cheer, too  often decrees it otherwise, and the guests seldom get a bit of an  \"_entremets_\" till it is half cold. (See No. 485.)    So much time is often lost in placing every thing in apple-pie order,  that long before dinner is announced, all becomes lukewarm; and to  complete the mortification of the _grand gourmand_, his meat is put on a  sheet of ice in the shape of a plate, which instantly converts the gravy  into jelly, and the fat into a something which puzzles his teeth and the  roof of his mouth as much as if he had birdlime to masticate. A complete  _meat-screen_ will answer the purpose of a _hot closet_, _plate-warmer_,  &c.--See Index.    It will save you infinite trouble and anxiety, if you can prevail on  your employers to use the \"SAUCE-BOX,\" No. 462, hereinafter described in  the chapter of Sauces. With the help of this \"MAGAZINE OF TASTE,\" every  one in company may flavour their soup and sauce, and adjust the  vibrations of their palate, exactly to their own fancy; but if the cook  give a decidedly predominant and _piquante gout_ to a dish, to tickle  the tongues of two or three visiters, whose taste she knows, she may  thereby make the dinner disgusting to all the other guests.    Never undertake more work than you are quite certain you can do well. If  you are ordered to prepare a larger dinner than you think you can send  up with ease and neatness, or to dress any dish that you are not  acquainted with, rather than run any risk in spoiling any thing (by one  fault you may perhaps lose all your credit), request your employers to  let you have some help. They may acquit you for pleading guilty of  inability; but if you make an attempt, and fail, will vote it a capital  offence.    If your mistress professes to understand cookery, your best way will be  to follow her directions. If you wish to please her, let her have the  praise of all that is right, and cheerfully bear the blame of any thing  that is wrong; only advise that all NEW DISHES may be first tried when  the family dine alone. When there is company, never attempt to dress any  thing which you have not ascertained that you can do perfectly well.    Do not trust any part of your work to others without carefully  overlooking them: whatever faults they commit, you will be censured for.  If you have forgotten any article which is indispensable for the day's  dinner, request your employers to send one of the other servants for it.  The cook must never quit her post till her work is entirely finished.    It requires the utmost skill and contrivance to have all things done as  they should be, and all done together, at that critical moment when the  dinner-bell sounds \"to the banquet.\"        \"A feast must be without a fault;      And if 't is not all right, 't is naught.\"    But        \"Good nature will some failings overlook,      Forgive mischance, not errors of the cook;      As, if no salt is thrown about the dish,      Or nice crisp'd parsley scatter'd on the fish,      Shall we in passion from our dinner fly,      And hopes of pardon to the cook deny,      For things which Mrs. GLASSE herself might oversee,      And all mankind commit as well as she?\"        Vide KING'S _Art of Cookery_.    Such is the endless variety of culinary preparations, that it would be  as vain and fruitless a search as that for the philosopher's stone, to  expect to find a cook who is quite perfect in all the operations of the  spit, the stewpan, and the rolling-pin: you will as soon find a  watchmaker who can make, put together, and regulate every part of a  watch.    \"The universe cannot produce a cook who knows how to do every branch of  cookery well, be his genius as great as possible.\"--Vide the _Cook's  Cookery_, 8vo. page 40.    THE BEST RULE FOR MARKETING is to _pay_ READY MONEY for every thing, and  to deal with the most respectable tradesmen in your neighbourhood.    If you leave it to their integrity to supply you with a good article, at  the fair market price, you will be supplied with better provisions, and  at as reasonable a rate as those bargain-hunters, who trot \"around,  around, around about\" a market, till they are trapped to buy some  _unchewable_ old poultry, _tough_ tup-mutton, _stringy_ cow beef, or  _stale_ fish, at a very little less than the price of prime and proper  food. With _savings_ like these they toddle home in triumph, cackling  all the way, like a goose that has got ankle-deep into good luck.    All the skill of the most accomplished cook will avail nothing, unless  she is furnished with PRIME PROVISIONS. The best way to procure these is  to deal with shops of established character: you may appear to pay,  perhaps, ten _per cent._ more than you would, were you to deal with  those who pretend to sell cheap, but you would be much more than in that  proportion better served.    Every trade has its tricks and deceptions: those who follow them can  deceive you if they please; and they are too apt to do so, if you  provoke the exercise of their over-reaching talent.[61-*]    Challenge them to a game at \"_Catch who can_,\" by entirely relying on  your own judgment; and you will soon find that nothing but very long  experience can make you equal to the combat of marketing to the utmost  advantage.    Before you go to market, look over your larder, and consider well what  things are wanting, especially on a Saturday. No well-regulated family  can suffer a disorderly caterer to be jumping in and out to the  chandler's shop on a Sunday morning.    Give your directions to your assistants, and begin your business early  in the morning, or it will be impossible to have the dinner ready at the  time it is ordered.    To be half an hour after the time is such a frequent fault, that there  is the more merit in being ready at the appointed hour. This is a  difficult task, and in the best-regulated family you can only be sure of  your time by proper arrangements.    With all our love of punctuality, we must not forget that the first  consideration must still be, that the dinner \"be well done when 't is  done.\"    If any accident occurs to any part of the dinner, or if you are likely  to be prevented sending the soup, &c. to the table at the moment it is  expected, send up a message to your employers, stating the circumstance,  and bespeak their patience for as many minutes as you think it will take  to be ready.

This I permitted him to do till I had worked to  windward, when I bore down upon him. As I drew close, he feinted at  coming about. This led me to shoot into the wind to forestall him. But  it was only a feint, cleverly executed, and he held back to his course  while I hurried to make up lost ground.    He was undeniably smarter than I when it came to manoeuvring. Time  after time I all but had him, and each time he tricked me and escaped.  Besides, the wind was freshening constantly, and each of us had his  hands full to avoid capsizing. As for my boat, it could not have been  kept afloat but for the extra ballast. I sat cocked over the weather  gunwale, tiller in one hand and sheet in the other; and the sheet,  with a single turn around a pin, I was very often forced to let go in  the severer puffs. This allowed the sail to spill the wind, which was  equivalent to taking off so much driving power, and of course I lost  ground. My consolation was that Demetrios was as often compelled to do  the same thing.    The strong ebb-tide, racing down the Straits in the teeth of the wind,  caused an unusually heavy and spiteful sea, which dashed aboard  continually. I was dripping wet, and even the sail was wet half-way up  the after leech. Once I did succeed in outmanoeuvring Demetrios, so  that my bow bumped into him amidships. Here was where I should have  had another man. Before I could run forward and leap aboard, he shoved  the boats apart with an oar, laughing mockingly in my face as he did  so.    We were now at the mouth of the Straits, in a bad stretch of water.  Here the Vallejo Straits and the Carquinez Straits rushed directly at  each other. Through the first flowed all the water of Napa River and  the great tide-lands; through the second flowed all the water of  Suisun Bay and the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers. And where such  immense bodies of water, flowing swiftly, clashed together, a terrible  tide-rip was produced. To make it worse, the wind howled up San Pablo  Bay for fifteen miles and drove in a tremendous sea upon the tide-rip.    Conflicting currents tore about in all directions, colliding, forming  whirlpools, sucks, and boils, and shooting up spitefully into hollow  waves which fell aboard as often from leeward as from windward. And  through it all, confused, driven into a madness of motion, thundered  the great smoking seas from San Pablo Bay.    I was as wildly excited as the water. The boat was behaving  splendidly, leaping and lurching through the welter like a race-horse.  I could hardly contain myself with the joy of it. The huge sail, the  howling wind, the driving seas, the plunging boat--I, a pygmy, a mere  speck in the midst of it, was mastering the elemental strife, flying  through it and over it, triumphant and victorious.    And just then, as I roared along like a conquering hero, the boat  received a frightful smash and came instantly to a dead stop. I was  flung forward and into the bottom. As I sprang up I caught a fleeting  glimpse of a greenish, barnacle-covered object, and knew it at once  for what it was, that terror of navigation, a sunken pile. No man may  guard against such a thing. Water-logged and floating just beneath the  surface, it was impossible to sight it in the troubled water in time  to escape.    The whole bow of the boat must have been crushed in, for in a few  seconds the boat was half full. Then a couple of seas filled it, and  it sank straight down, dragged to bottom by the heavy ballast. So  quickly did it all happen that I was entangled in the sail and drawn  under. When I fought my way to the surface, suffocating, my lungs  almost bursting, I could see nothing of the oars. They must have been  swept away by the chaotic currents. I saw Demetrios Contos looking  back from his boat, and heard the vindictive and mocking tones of his  voice as he shouted exultantly. He held steadily on his course,  leaving me to perish.    There was nothing to do but to swim for it, which, in that wild  confusion, was at the best a matter of but a few moments. Holding my  breath and working with my hands, I managed to get off my heavy  sea-boots and my jacket. Yet there was very little breath I could  catch to hold, and I swiftly discovered that it was not so much a  matter of swimming as of breathing.    I was beaten and buffeted, smashed under by the great San Pablo  whitecaps, and strangled by the hollow tide-rip waves which flung  themselves into my eyes, nose, and mouth. Then the strange sucks would  grip my legs and drag me under, to spout me up in some fierce boiling,  where, even as I tried to catch my breath, a great whitecap would  crash down upon my head.    It was impossible to survive any length of time. I was breathing more  water than air, and drowning all the time. My senses began to leave  me, my head to whirl around. I struggled on, spasmodically,  instinctively, and was barely half conscious when I felt myself caught  by the shoulders and hauled over the gunwale of a boat.    For some time I lay across a seat where I had been flung, face  downward, and with the water running out of my mouth. After a while,  still weak and faint, I turned around to see who was my rescuer. And  there, in the stern, sheet in one hand and tiller in the other,  grinning and nodding good-naturedly, sat Demetrios Contos. He had  intended to leave me to drown,--he said so afterward,--but his better  self had fought the battle, conquered, and sent him back to me.    \"You all-a right?\" he asked.    I managed to shape a \"yes\" on my lips, though I could not yet speak.    \"You sail-a de boat verr-a good-a,\" he said. \"So good-a as a man.\"    A compliment from Demetrios Contos was a compliment indeed, and I  keenly appreciated it, though I could only nod my head in  acknowledgment.    We held no more conversation, for I was busy recovering and he was  busy with the boat. He ran in to the wharf at Vallejo, made the boat  fast, and helped me out. Then it was, as we both stood on the wharf,  that Charley stepped out from behind a net-rack and put his hand on  Demetrios Contos's arm.    \"He saved my life, Charley,\" I protested; \"and I don't think he ought  to be arrested.\"    A puzzled expression came into Charley's face, which cleared  immediately after, in a way it had when he made up his mind.    \"I can't help it, lad,\" he said kindly. \"I can't go back on my duty,  and it's plain duty to arrest him. To-day is Sunday; there are two  salmon in his boat which he caught to-day. What else can I do?\"    \"But he saved my life,\" I persisted, unable to make any other  argument.    [Illustration: \"There, in the stern, sat Demetrios Contos.\"]    Demetrios Contos's face went black with rage when he learned Charley's  judgment. He had a sense of being unfairly treated. The better part of  his nature had triumphed, he had performed a generous act and saved a  helpless enemy, and in return the enemy was taking him to jail.    Charley and I were out of sorts with each other when we went back to  Benicia. I stood for the spirit of the law and not the letter; but by  the letter Charley made his stand. As far as he could see, there was  nothing else for him to do. The law said distinctly that no salmon  should be caught on Sunday. He was a patrolman, and it was his duty to  enforce that law. That was all there was to it. He had done his duty,  and his conscience was clear. Nevertheless, the whole thing seemed  unjust to me, and I felt very sorry for Demetrios Contos.    Two days later we went down to Vallejo to the trial. I had to go along  as a witness, and it was the most hateful task that I ever performed  in my life when I testified on the witness stand to seeing Demetrios  catch the two salmon Charley had captured him with.    Demetrios had engaged a lawyer, but his case was hopeless. The jury  was out only fifteen minutes, and returned a verdict of guilty. The  judge sentenced Demetrios to pay a fine of one hundred dollars or go  to jail for fifty days.    Charley stepped up to the clerk of the court. \"I want to pay that  fine,\" he said, at the same time placing five twenty-dollar gold  pieces on the desk. \"It--it was the only way out of it, lad,\" he  stammered, turning to me.    The moisture rushed into my eyes as I seized his hand. \"I want to  pay--\" I began.    \"To pay your half?\" he interrupted. \"I certainly shall expect you to  pay it.\"    In the meantime Demetrios had been informed by his lawyer that his fee  likewise had been paid by Charley.    Demetrios came over to shake Charley's hand, and all his warm Southern  blood flamed in his face. Then, not to be outdone in generosity, he  insisted on paying his fine and lawyer's fee himself, and flew  half-way into a passion because Charley refused to let him.    More than anything else we ever did, I think, this action of Charley's  impressed upon the fishermen the deeper significance of the law. Also  Charley was raised high in their esteem, while I came in for a little  share of praise as a boy who knew how to sail a boat. Demetrios Contos  not only never broke the law again, but he became a very good friend  of ours, and on more than one occasion he ran up to Benicia to have a  gossip with us.          VII    YELLOW HANDKERCHIEF      \"I'm not wanting to dictate to you, lad,\" Charley said; \"but I'm very  much against your making a last raid. You've gone safely through rough  times with rough men, and it would be a shame to have something happen  to you at the very end.\"    \"But how can I get out of making a last raid?\" I demanded, with the  cocksureness of youth. \"There always has to be a last, you know, to  anything.\"    Charley crossed his legs, leaned back, and considered the problem.  \"Very true. But why not call the capture of Demetrios Contos the last?  You're back from it safe and sound and hearty, for all your good  wetting, and--and--\""]]]
