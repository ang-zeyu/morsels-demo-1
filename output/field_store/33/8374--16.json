[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24222"],[0,"The Story of Eclipses (#15)"],[1,"when this eclipse  certainly occurred, also be a month suitable for the exhibition of such  a phenomenon?\"    It is ascertainable by calculation that the time occupied by the Moon in  passing over the Sun, in the way it did during this eclipse, was about  21/2 hours. But from the time of central conjunction, when the  obscuration was the greatest and the point of light depressed the most,  to the time when the uppermost portion of the Sun's disc was released by  the eastward motion of the Moon, and the light from that uppermost  portion was again manifest, was about 20 minutes, and this, therefore,  was the time during which the phenomenon of retrogression on the \"steps\"  would have been exhibited to the King's eyes. Assuming then that the  time when the ascending shadow had travelled upwards to the tenth step  coincided, or nearly so, with the time when the Sun had reached its  highest altitude for the day, at noon, we infer that the time of central  conjunction during this eclipse was not later than from 20 to 15  minutes before noon. It could not have been much earlier, because the  phenomenon of the resting of the shadow for a time at its _apparently_  highest point for the day (which preceded the promise that it should  rise ten steps) has also to be accounted for, and this cessation of its  motion upwards could not have taken place till about 25 minutes before  noon, when the decreasing motion of the Sun in altitude (or its  slackening motion upwards as it approached mid-day) would have become  counteracted by the coming on of the eclipse. Now at 11.35 A.M. the  sun's disc would have risen to the altitude of 35 deg. 8'; and the highest  visible point of light would, owing to the eclipse, then have been about  35 deg. 4'; and at 11.40 A.M., being the time of greatest obscuration, the  extreme cusps of light produced by the intervention of the Moon would  still have stood at about 35 deg. 4', just 23' below the highest point of  light at noon (Fig. 12). _The whole disc of the sun had now risen above  the gnomon, yet no motion of the shadow on the steps had been observed  for fully five minutes. The time shown by the dial was seemingly  mid-day._    [Illustration: FIG. 12.--ECLIPSE OF THE SUN, JANUARY 11, 689 B.C., AT  JERUSALEM.]    Sun's apparent semi-diameter 16' 13\"  Moon's  \"       \"            15' 13\"  Moon's relative hourly motion in declination 5' 44\" northward.

[Illustration: Phase at 20 minutes before noon.]    [Illustration: Phase at noon.]    We have now to consider \"to what extent would a staircase rising at an  angle of 31 deg. 47' towards the Sun, with a gnomon so placed at the top as  to cast a shadow to the foot of the lower step on the shortest day of  the year be affected by a movement in a perpendicular direction of the  point of light to the extent of 23', or 1/3 of a degree\"? The effect would  be widely different at different times of the year, being greatest at  mid-winter when the shadows are longest, and least at mid-summer when  the shadows are shortest. It follows from this that January 13 being a  day but three weeks removed from mid-winter day the normal shadow would  be not far from its longest possible length, and the effect of a  displacement of 23' would be neither more nor less than 1/12th of the  whole range of the steps whatever that range might have been. This  extent of motion, then, is fully sufficient to satisfy the condition  prescribed by the Biblical narrative of there being such a deflection of  the Sun's light as would affect the shadow to the extent implied by the  words \"ten steps\" or \"ten degrees,\" which is virtually the same idea.  The same extent of motion could not have been produced under the same  conditions either a few days earlier or a few days later; that may  certainly be taken for granted. And the only point in which we are  necessarily in doubt arises from the fact that we are ignorant of the  actual number and nature of the graduations of Ahaz's so-called \"Dial.\"  If it were permissible to assume that there were 120 graduations on the  instrument, be they steps properly so-called on a structure erected in  the open air or be they lines on a flat surface on some instrument  standing in a room, or what not, then the problem is solved, for 1/12  (as above) of 120 is ten--the \"ten degrees\" stated in the history.    As to whether the \"dial\" of Ahaz was a device built up of masonry in the  open air or was an instrument for indoor use we know absolutely nothing,  and speculation is useless. There is something to be said on both sides.  Bosanquet, on abstract grounds, leans to the latter view; on the other  hand he calls attention to the present existence in India, at Delhi and  Benares, of ruined Hindoo observatories in the form of huge masonry  sun-dials many yards in length and breadth and height.[33]    Finally it may be pointed out that there is some incidental confirmation  to be found for this Hezekiah incident having happened in winter. That  the season of the year was winter seems to be suggested by the word used  in the original Hebrew in connection with the return of the shadow.    \"Backward\" in Isaiah xxxviii. 8 might also be translated, \"From the  end.\" It would be very natural to hold that this implied that the motion  of the shadow was upwards from the _lower_ end of the group of steps  towards which the shadow had gone down. Now the lower end of the steps  could only have been the place of the shadow in December or January at  or near the time of the winter solstice. Moreover the mention of the  \"lump of figs\" seems to suggest the winter season. A cake of figs means  dried figs, not newly gathered summer figs.    Putting all the facts together we may fairly conclude that the  astronomical event which happened in connection with Hezekiah's illness  was an eclipse of the Sun, and that its date was January 11, 689 B.C.    A few other Scripture passages need a passing mention. In Isaiah xiii.  10 we read:--    \"The Sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the Moon shall not  cause her light to shine.\" It has been thought by Johnson that this  passage is an allusion to an eclipse of the Sun, and so it might be; but  on the other hand, it may be no more than one of those highly figurative  phrases which abound in holy Scripture, and of which the well-known  passage, \"The stars in their courses fought against Sisera\" (Judges v.  20), is a familiar example.    In Jeremiah x. 2 we read:--    \"Be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at  them.\" This is cited as an eclipse allusion by Johnson, who points out  that the utterance of this caution preceded by about fifteen years the  celebrated eclipse of Thales (585 B.C.). But surely this is far-fetched.  I shall be inclined to attach the same criticism to his next citation.  Ezekiel employs these expressions:--\"When I shall put thee out, I will  cover the heaven, and make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the Sun  with a cloud, and the Moon shall not give her light\" (xxxii. 7). This  language resembles, in no small degree, Isaiah's, already quoted, and,  like that, _might_ apply to the phenomenon of a solar eclipse, but  whether that was actually the prophet's intention is another matter. He  may have witnessed the eclipse of 585 B.C. on the banks of the river  Chebar, and that spectacle may have put this imagery into his head.  Further than this it seems hardly safe to go.    This seems an appropriate place to mention a very interesting matter, to  which attention has been called by Oriental scholars in recent times,  who have investigated Assyrian and Egyptian monuments, and other  monuments of the same type. The story would be a long and interesting  one if presented in detail, and would far exceed my limits of space. I  must, therefore, be content with such a summary as that which has been  worked out by Mr. E. W. Maunder. Briefly the facts are these. There are  to be found in many places carvings in stone, symbolic of the Sun-god  once worshipped in the East. The general design, with of course  variations, is a circle with striated wings extending right and left to  two diameters of the wing, more or less, with a lesser extension in a  downward direction. Allowing for the roughness of the art, and for the  fact that the material was stone, it does not require any very great  stretch of imagination to see in these carvings the disc of a  totally-eclipsed Sun with, right and left and below it, that form of  corona which we have come to associate with total eclipses occurring at  periods of Sun-spot minima.[34] This idea should not seem far-fetched if  we bear in mind the fact that the ancient Orientals worshipped the Sun,  Moon, and Planets; and one of the natural outcomes of this is submitted  for our consideration by Maunder in the words following[35]:--    \"There can be little doubt that the Sun was regarded partly as a symbol,  partly as a manifestation of the unseen, unapproachable Divinity. Its  light and heat, its power of calling into active exercise the  mysterious forces of germination and ripening, the universality of its  influence, all seemed the fit expressions of the yet greater powers  which belonged to the Invisible. What happened in a total solar eclipse?  For a short time that which seemed so perfect a divine symbol was  completely hidden. The light and heat, the two great forms of solar  energy, were withdrawn, but something took their place. A mysterious  light of mysterious form, unlike any other light, unlike any other  single form, was seen in its place. Could they fail to see in this a  closer, a more intimate revelation, a more exalted symbolism of the  Divine Nature and Presence? Just as in the various Greek 'mysteries' the  student was gradually advanced from one set of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24236"],[0,"Time and Tide: A Romance of the Moon (#15)"],[1,"be told  that the moon contains no water on its surface, and how then, it will  be said, can tides ebb and flow where there is no sea to be disturbed?  There are two answers to this difficulty; it is no doubt true that the  moon seems at present entirely devoid of water in so far as its  surface is exposed to us, but it is by no means certain that the moon  was always in this destitute condition. There are very large features  marked on its map as \"seas\"; these regions are of a darker hue than  the rest of the moon's surface, they are large objects often many  hundreds of miles in diameter, and they form, in fact, those dark  patches on the brilliant surface which are conspicuous to the unaided  eye, and are represented in Fig. 3. Viewed in a telescope these  so-called seas, while clearly possessing no water at the present time,  are yet widely different from the general aspect of the moon's  surface. It has often been supposed that great oceans once filled  these basins, and a plausible explanation has even been offered as to  how the waters they once contained could have vanished. It has been  thought that as the mineral substances deep in the interior of our  satellite assumed the crystalline form during the progress of cooling,  the demand for water of crystallization required for incorporation  with the minerals was so great that the oceans of the moon became  entirely absorbed. It is, however, unnecessary for our present  argument that this theory should be correct. Even if there never was a  drop of water found on our satellite, the tides in its molten  materials would be quite sufficient for our purpose; anything that  tides could accomplish would be done more speedily by vast tides of  flowing lava than by merely oceanic tides.    There can be no doubt that tides raised on the moon by the earth would  be greater than the tides raised on the earth by the moon. The  question is, however, not a very simple one, for it depends on the  masses of both bodies as well as on their relative dimensions. In so  far as the masses are concerned, the earth being more than eighty  times as heavy as the moon, the tides would on this account be vastly  larger on the moon than on the earth. On the other hand, the moon's  diameter being much less than that of the earth, the efficiency of a  tide-producing body in its action on the moon would be less than that  of the same body at the same distance in its action on the earth; but  the diminution of the tides from this cause would be not so great as  their increase from the former cause, and therefore the net result  would be to exhibit much greater tides on the moon than on the earth.    Suppose that the moon had been originally endowed with a rapid  movement of rotation around its axis, the effect of the tides on that  rotation would tend to check its velocity just in the same way as the  tides on the earth have effected a continual elongation of the day.  Only as the tides on the moon were so enormously great, their capacity  to check the moon's speed would have corresponding efficacy. In  addition to this, the mass of the moon being so small, it could only  offer feeble resistance to the unceasing action of the tide, and  therefore our satellite must succumb to whatever the tides desired  ages before our earth would have been affected to a like extent. It  must be noticed that the influence of the tidal friction is not  directed to the total annihilation of the rotation of the two bodies  affected by it; the velocity is only checked down until it attains  such a point that the speed in which each body rotates upon its axis  has become equal to that in which it revolves around the  tide-producer. The practical effect of such an adjustment is to make  the tide-agitated body turn a constant face towards its tormentor.    I may here note a point about which people sometimes find a little  difficulty. The moon constantly turns the same face towards the earth,  and therefore people are sometimes apt to think that the moon performs  no rotation whatever around its own axis. But this is indeed not the  case. The true inference to be drawn from the constant face of the  moon is, that the velocity of rotation about its own axis is equal to  that of its rotation around the earth; in fact, the moon revolves  around the earth in twenty-seven days, and its rotation about its axis  is performed in twenty-seven days also. You may illustrate the  movement of the moon around the earth by walking around a table in a  room, keeping all the time your face turned towards the table; in such  a case as this you not only perform a motion of revolution, but you  also perform a rotation in an equal period. The proof that you do  rotate is to be found in the fact that during the movement your face  is being directed successively to all the points of the compass. There  is no more singular fact in the solar system than the constancy of the  moon's face to the earth. The periods of rotation and revolution are  both alike; if one of these periods exceeded the other by an amount so  small as the hundredth part of a second, the moon would in the lapse  of ages permit us to see that other side which is now so jealously  concealed. The marvellous coincidence between these two periods would  be absolutely inexplicable, unless we were able to assign it to some  physical cause. It must be remembered that in this matter the moon  occupies a unique position among the heavenly host. The sun revolves  around on its axis in a period of twenty-five or twenty-six days--thus  we see one side of the sun as frequently as we see the other. The side  of the sun which is turned towards us to-day is almost entirely  different from that we saw a fortnight ago. Nor is the period of the  sun's rotation to be identified with any other remarkable period in  our system. If it were equal to the length of the year, for instance,  or if it were equal to the period of any of the other planets, then it  could hardly be contended that the phenomenon as presented by the moon  was unique; but the sun's period is not simply related, or indeed  related at all, to any of the other periodic times in the system. Nor  do we find anything like the moon's constancy of face in the behaviour  of the other planets. Jupiter turns now one face to us and then  another. Nor is his rotation related to the sun or related to any  other body, as our moon's motion is related to us. It has indeed been  thought that in the movements of the satellites of Jupiter a somewhat  similar phenomenon may be observed to that in the motion of our own  satellite. If this be so, the causes whereby this phenomenon is  produced are doubtless identical in the two cases.    So remarkable a coincidence as that which the moon's motion shows  could not reasonably be explained as a mere fortuitous circumstance;  nor need we hesitate to admit that a physical explanation is required  when we find a most satisfactory one ready for our acceptance, as was  originally pointed out by Helmholtz.    There can be no doubt whatever that the constancy of the moon's face  is the work of ancient tides, which have long since ceased to act. We  have shown that if the moon's rotation had once been too rapid to  permit of the same face being always directed towards us, the tides  would operate as a check by which the velocity of that rotation would  be abated. On the other hand, if the moon rotated so slowly that its  other face would be exposed to us in the course of the revolution, the  tides would then be dragged violently over its surface in the  direction of its rotation; their tendency would thus be to accelerate  the speed until the angular velocity of rotation was equal to that of  revolution. Thus the tides would act as a controlling agent of the  utmost stringency to hurry the moon round when it was not turning fast  enough, and to arrest the motion when going too fast. Peace there  would be none for the moon until it yielded absolute compliance to the  tyranny of the tides, and adjusted its period of rotation with exact  identity to its period of revolution. Doubtless this adjustment was  made countless ages ago, and since that period the tides have acted so  as to preserve the adjustment, as long as any part of the moon was in  a state sufficiently soft or fluid to respond to tidal impression. The  present state of the moon is a monument to which we may confidently  appeal in support of our contention as to the great power of the tides  during the ages which have passed; it will serve as an illustration of  the future which is reserved for our earth in ages yet to come, when  our globe shall have also succumbed to tidal influence.    It is owing to the smallness of the moon relatively to the earth that  the tidal process has reached a much more advanced stage in the moon  than it has on the earth; but the moon is incessant in its efforts to  bring the earth into the same condition which it has itself been  forced to assume. Thus again we look forward to an epoch in the  inconceivably remote future when tidal thraldom shall be supreme, and  when the earth shall turn the same face to the moon, as the moon now  turns the same face to the earth.    In the critical state of things thus looming in the dim future, the  earth and the moon will continue to perform this adjusted revolution  in a period of about fourteen hundred hours, the two bodies being  held, as it were, by invisible bands. Such an arrangement might be  eternal if there were no intrusion of tidal influence from any other  body; but of course in our system as we actually find it the sun  produces tides as well as the moon; and the solar tides being at  present much less than those originated by the moon, we have neglected  them in the general outlines of the theory. The solar tides, however,  must necessarily have an increasing significance. I do not mean that  they will intrinsically increase, for there seems no"]]]
