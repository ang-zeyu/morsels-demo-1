Then I hit on a stratagem. My kinswoman was fond of _pan_,[31] and I  hastened to place some before her. This entailed her rising later on to  get rid of the chewed _pan_, and, as she did so, her keys fell off her  lap and were replaced over her shoulder. This time they got stolen, the  culprit got off, and the book got read! Its owner tried to scold me,  but the attempt was not a success, we both laughed so.    Dr. Rajendralal Mitra used to edit an illustrated monthly miscellany. My  third brother had a bound annual volume of it in his bookcase. This I  managed to secure and the delight of reading it through, over and over  again, still comes back to me. Many a holiday noontide has passed with  me stretched on my back on my bed, that square volume on my breast,  reading about the Narwhal whale, or the curiosities of justice as  administered by the Kazis of old, or the romantic story of  Krishna-kumari.    Why do we not have such magazines now-a-days? We have philosophical and  scientific articles on the one hand, and insipid stories and travels on  the other, but no such unpretentious miscellanies which the ordinary  person can read in comfort--such as Chambers's or Cassell's or the  Strand in England--which supply the general reader with a simple, but  satisfying fare and are of the greatest use to the greatest number.    I came across another little periodical in my young days called the  _Abodhabandhu_ (ignorant man's friend). I found a collection of its  monthly numbers in my eldest brother's library and devoured them day  after day, seated on the doorsill of his study, facing a bit of terrace  to the South. It was in the pages of this magazine that I made my first  acquaintance with the poetry of Viharilal Chakravarti. His poems  appealed to me the most of all that I read at the time. The artless  flute-strains of his lyrics awoke within me the music of fields and  forest-glades.    Into these same pages I have wept many a tear over a pathetic  translation of Paul and Virginie. That wonderful sea, the breeze-stirred  cocoanut forests on its shore, and the slopes beyond lively with the  gambols of mountain goats,--a delightfully refreshing mirage they  conjured up on that terraced roof in Calcutta. And oh! the romantic  courting that went on in the forest paths of that secluded island,  between the Bengali boy reader and little Virginie with the  many-coloured kerchief round her head!    Then came Bankim's _Bangadarsan_, taking the Bengali heart by storm. It  was bad enough to have to wait till the next monthly number was out, but  to be kept waiting further till my elders had done with it was simply  intolerable! Now he who will may swallow at a mouthful the whole of  _Chandrashekhar_ or _Bishabriksha_ but the process of longing and  anticipating, month after month; of spreading over the long intervals  the concentrated joy of each short reading, revolving every instalment  over and over in the mind while watching and waiting for the next; the  combination of satisfaction with unsatisfied craving, of burning  curiosity with its appeasement; these long drawn out delights of going  through the original serial none will ever taste again.    The compilations from the old poets by Sarada Mitter and Akshay Sarkar  were also of great interest to me. Our elders were subscribers, but not  very regular readers, of these series, so that it was not difficult for  me to get at them. Vidyapati's quaint and corrupt Maithili language  attracted me all the more because of its unintelligibility. I tried to  make out his sense without the help of the compiler's notes, jotting  down in my own note book all the more obscure words with their context  as many times as they occurred. I also noted grammatical peculiarities  according to my lights.          (18) _My Home Environment_      One great advantage which I enjoyed in my younger days was the literary  and artistic atmosphere which pervaded our house. I remember how, when I  was quite a child, I would be leaning against the verandah railings  which overlooked the detached building comprising the reception rooms.  These rooms would be lighted up every evening. Splendid carriages would  draw up under the portico, and visitors would be constantly coming and  going. What was happening I could not very well make out, but would keep  staring at the rows of lighted casements from my place in the darkness.  The intervening space was not great but the gulf between my infant world  and these lights was immense.    My elder cousin Ganendra had just got a drama written by Pandit  Tarkaratna and was having it staged in the house. His enthusiasm for  literature and the fine arts knew no bounds. He was the centre of the  group who seem to have been almost consciously striving to bring about  from every side the renascence which we see to-day. A pronounced  nationalism in dress, literature, music, art and the drama had awakened  in and around him. He was a keen student of the history of different  countries and had begun but could not complete a historical work in  Bengali. He had translated and published the Sanskrit drama,  Vikramorvasi, and many a well-known hymn is his composition. He may be  said to have given us the lead in writing patriotic poems and songs.  This was in the days when the Hindu Mela was an annual institution and  there his song \"Ashamed am I to sing of India's glories\" used to be  sung.    I was still a child when my cousin Ganendra died in the prime of his  youth, but for those who have once beheld him it is impossible to forget  his handsome, tall and stately figure. He had an irresistible social  influence. He could draw men round him and keep them bound to him; while  his powerful attraction was there, disruption was out of the question.  He was one of those--a type peculiar to our country--who, by their  personal magnetism, easily establish themselves in the centre of their  family or village. In any other country, where large political, social  or commercial groups are being formed, such would as naturally become  national leaders. The power of organising a large number of men into a  corporate group depends on a special kind of genius. Such genius in our  country runs to waste, a waste, as pitiful, it seems to me, as that of  pulling down a star from the firmament for use as a lucifer match.    I remember still better his younger brother, my cousin Gunendra.[32] He  likewise kept the house filled with his personality. His large, gracious  heart embraced alike relatives, friends, guests and dependants. Whether  in his broad south verandah, or on the lawn by the fountain, or at the  tank-edge on the fishing platform, he presided over self-invited  gatherings, like hospitality incarnate. His wide appreciation of art and  talent kept him constantly radiant with enthusiasm. New ideas of  festivity or frolic, theatricals or other entertainments, found in him a  ready patron, and with his help would flourish and find fruition.    We were too young then to take any part in these doings, but the waves  of merriment and life to which they gave rise came and beat at the doors  of our curiosity. I remember how a burlesque composed by my eldest  brother was once being rehearsed in my cousin's big drawing room. From  our place against the verandah railings of our house we could hear,  through the open windows opposite, roars of laughter mixed with the  strains of a comic song, and would also occasionally catch glimpses of  Akshay Mazumdar's extraordinary antics. We could not gather exactly what  the song was about, but lived in hopes of being able to find that out  sometime.    I recall how a trifling circumstance earned for me the special regard of  cousin Gunendra. Never had I got a prize at school except once for good  conduct. Of the three of us my nephew Satya was the best at his lessons.  He once did well at some examination and was awarded a prize. As we  came home I jumped off the carriage to give the great news to my cousin  who was in the garden. \"Satya has got a prize\" I shouted as I ran to  him. He drew me to his knees with a smile. \"And have _you_ not got a  prize?\" he asked. \"No,\" said I, \"not I, it's Satya.\" My genuine pleasure  at Satya's success seemed to touch my cousin particularly. He turned to  his friends and remarked on it as a very creditable trait. I well  remember how mystified I felt at this, for I had not thought of my  feeling in that light. This prize that I got for not getting a prize did  not do me good. There is no harm in making gifts to children, but they  should not be rewards. It is not healthy for youngsters to be made  self-conscious.    After the mid-day meal cousin Gunendra would attend the estate offices  in our part of the house. The office room of our elders was a sort of  club where laughter and conversation were freely mixed with matters of  business. My cousin would recline on a couch, and I would seize some  opportunity of edging up to him.    [Illustration: My Eldest Brother]    He usually told me stories from Indian History. I still remember the  surprise with which I heard how Clive, after establishing British rule  in India, went back home and cut his own throat. On the one hand new  history being made, on the other a tragic chapter hidden away in the  mysterious darkness of a human heart. How could there be such dismal  failure within and such brilliant success outside? This weighed heavily  on my mind the whole day.    Some days cousin Gunendra would not be allowed to remain in any doubt as  to the contents of my pocket. At the least encouragement out would come  my manuscript book, unabashed. I need hardly state that my cousin was  not a severe critic; in point of fact the opinions he expressed would  have done splendidly as advertisements. None the less, when in any of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22224"],[0,"At Aboukir and Acre: A Story of Napoleon's Invasion of Egypt (#15)"],[1," disposed to go with you; there, from his knowledge of the language of  the Franks, he would be able to gain much information as to their  designs.    \"He bids you regard him as your leader, and to act as he may advise. Two  of us are to go with you to look after your horses. He begs that one of  you will come to the base of the Great Pyramid on the twelfth day after  I left him, that is in ten days from now, to tell him what news you  have gathered and to consult with him. He is convinced that the news you  sent him will call all the Arabs to arms again.\"    \"That is just what I should wish,\" Edgar said. \"I have been thinking for  the last four days that I should like to be at Cairo. That is the place  of interest now.\"    He and his friend talked the matter over. \"It will be better,\" Edgar  said, \"that we should go as simple Arabs, and that we should take two  horses of less value than those which we now ride. You could send them  up by the party that will rejoin your father. As two young Arabs on  ordinary horses, we should attract no attention. We could encamp with  our two men just outside the town, and go in and out as we pleased; no  one would be likely to notice or question us. Or we might even wear the  dress of the fellaheen, which would be safer still, for if the Arabs  begin to make attacks upon French parties, as they are likely to do, any  of them wandering in the streets of Cairo might be regarded with  suspicion by the soldiers.\"    \"I will do just as you advise, Edgar. I suppose that we had better start  at once.\"    \"Certainly, as soon as we have eaten a meal. Will the man who brought  the news in be fresh enough to start again at once?\"    \"Certainly he would,\" Sidi said in a tone of surprise; \"an Arab never  feels fatigue on horseback. Of course he must have a fresh horse. I will  pick out another man to accompany us, and two horses for ourselves.  There are two that would suit us well, for they are both sound and fast,  though but poor animals to look at, and no one will cast an eye of envy  upon them.\"    \"That is just what we want, Sidi.\"    In less than an hour they were galloping across the plain. The journey  of 110 miles was accomplished in two days, and the party, without  entering the town, encamped on some waste ground outside the walls. Here  were many small huts belonging to the poorest class of the population,  together with many small shelter tents of black cloth erected by parties  of wandering Arabs like themselves. They had, on the previous night,  changed their attire, and had nothing to distinguish them from the  poorer classes of Arabs, who, having given up the desert life, earned a  precarious existence in the towns. The two men with them looked with  disdain at their surroundings, and Edgar felt obliged to warn them.    \"You must remember,\" he said, \"that the lion couches before he springs,  and crawls and conceals himself until he is within reach of his prey, so  is it needful also for us to bear ourselves humbly. We are come to see  what the French are doing; how they comport themselves, and what is the  feeling among the population. We are as spies who come to examine a  country before it is attacked, and to carry out our object we must bear  ourselves so that suspicion may not fall upon us. If you are questioned,  remember that we are four men ready to act as guards to a caravan or on  any such service that may present itself.\"    Leaving the two men to look after the horses, Edgar and Sidi entered the  city. The scene was intensely interesting, Cairo being vastly more  oriental in its appearance than Alexandria. The narrow streets were  crowded; strict orders had been issued against plundering, Napoleon  being anxious to win the good-will of the population, and merchandise of  all sorts was displayed in the shops. Each trade had its special bazaar,  the gold and silversmiths, the dealers in silks, in carpets, richly  embroidered garments, tobacco, long pipes with jewelled mouthpieces,  narghiles with their long twisted stems; workers in iron, vendors of the  yellow shoes used by the women in walking, the dainty gold-embroidered  velvet slippers for indoors, or the pointed upturned shoes of the men,  had each its own bazaars scattered throughout the streets.    Women, in their long dark blue garments, and the hideous white linen  yakmash covering the whole face below the eyes, and falling to the  breast, moved through the crowd, others of higher rank, seated on  donkeys and attended by eunuchs, made their way back from the baths, or  from visits to their friends. Stout Turkish merchants or functionaries  rode along perched on high saddles, looking as if they would bear to the  ground the little donkeys, that nevertheless went lightly along with  their burden. French soldiers abounded, gazing into the shops, and  occasionally making small purchases, chattering and laughing, the  fatigues and sufferings of the march being now forgotten.    There were comparatively few of the richer class in the streets, many of  these having left the city at the approach of the French, while on the  night before the latter entered there had been serious tumults in the  city, and the houses of many of the beys had been broken into and  sacked. Through all this crowd Edgar and Sidi wandered unnoticed.    \"It does not look as if there were any strong feeling against the  Franks,\" Sidi remarked, as they issued into a large square which was  comparatively deserted, and seated themselves on a bench in the shade of  the trees near a fountain.    \"No; but it is not here that one would expect to find any signs of  disaffection. No doubt the traders are doing a good business, for every  officer and soldier will be sure to spend all his pay in presents for  those at home, or in mementoes of his stay here, and I am sure the  things are pretty enough to tempt anyone. It is in the poorer quarters  that trouble will be brewing.\"    Presently a group of French officers came along and seated themselves at  a short distance from the two young Arabs. Having not the slightest idea  that these could understand what they said, they talked loudly and  unrestrainedly.    \"The thing is serious, gentlemen,\" one of them, who was clearly of  superior rank to the rest, said. \"Since the news of this most  unfortunate affair arrived, there has been a great change in the  situation. For the last two days there has not been a single horse  brought into the horse-market, and the number of bullocks has fallen off  so greatly that the commissariat had difficulty this morning in buying  sufficient for the day's rations for the army, but the worst of it is,  that assassinations are becoming terribly common, and in the last three  days fifty-two men have been killed. There will be a general order out  to-morrow that men are not to go beyond certain limits, unless at least  four are together, and that they are not, under any pretext whatever, to  enter a native house.    \"Besides those known to have been killed, there are twenty-three  missing, and there is no doubt they too have been murdered, and their  bodies buried. The Egyptian head of the police has warned us that there  are gatherings in the lower quarters, and that he believes that some of  Mourad's emissaries are stirring the people up to revolt. A good many  parties of Arabs are reported as having been seen near the city.  Altogether I fear that we are going to have serious trouble; not that  there is any fear of revolt, we can put that down without difficulty,  but this system of assassination is alarming, and if it goes on, the men  will never be safe outside their barracks, except in the main  thoroughfares. One does not see how to put it down. An open enemy one  can fight, but there is no discovering who these fellows are in a large  population like this, and it would be of no use inflicting a fine on the  city for every French soldier killed; that would affect only the richer  class and the traders. There is no doubt, too, that the news that our  fleet has been completely destroyed has dispirited the soldiers, who  feel that for the present, an any rate, they are completely cut off from  France.\"    \"That is certainly serious, general,\" one of the officers said, \"and  there seems only the project of the invasion of India or a march to  Constantinople. After our march here, though it was but little over a  hundred miles, and the greater portion of the way along the bank of the  river, with our flotilla with stores abreast of us, neither of these  alternatives look as easy as they seemed to us before we set foot in  this country.\"    \"No, indeed, colonel; our campaign at home gave us no idea of what the  march of our army would be across these deserts, and it certainly seems  to me that the idea of twenty thousand men marching from here to India  is altogether out of the question. If our fleet had beaten the English,  gone back and brought us twenty thousand more men, and had then sailed  round the Cape, and come up to Suez to fetch us and land us in India,  the thing would have been feasible enough, and in alliance with the  Sultan of Mysore we might have cleared the English out altogether, but  the land march seems to be impossible; a small body of men could never  fight their way there, a large body could not find subsistence.\"    \"No; I fancy that Constantinople will be the place at which we shall  emerge. A march to Palestine will, of course, be hard, but it is only  three or four days from the Egyptian frontier. I don't fancy that there  will be any difficulty on the way up through Syria and Asia Minor, and  that almost everywhere we shall find cultivated land, and an abundant  supply of provisions for the army. As for the Turks, I have no doubt  that we shall thrash them, if they venture to interfere with us, as  easily as we did the Egyptians. I have no fear for the safety of the  army, and if the Egyptians venture on a rising here, before we start,"]]]
