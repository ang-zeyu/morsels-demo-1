Never was a fabric  more completely reduced into its original elements than were large  sections of that shawl. It was a masterly piece of analysis. The work of  the wheel and the loom was exactly reversed, and what was once shawl was  now the finest and softest of wool.    The white-footed mouse is much more common along the fences and in the  woods than one would suspect. One winter day I set a mouse-trap--the  kind known as the delusion trap--beneath some ledges in the edge of the  woods, to determine what species of mouse was most active at this  season. The snow fell so deeply that I did not visit my trap for two or  three weeks. When I did so, it was literally packed full of white-footed  mice. There were seven in all, and not room for another. Our woods are  full of these little creatures, and they appear to have a happy, social  time of it, even in the severest winters. Their little tunnels under the  snow and their hurried leaps upon its surface may be noted everywhere.  They link tree and stump, or rock and tree, by their pretty trails. They  evidently travel for adventure and to hear the news, as well as for  food. They know that foxes and owls are about, and they keep pretty  close to cover. When they cross an exposed place, they do it hurriedly.    The field or meadow mice doubtless welcome the snow. They can now come  out of their dens in the ground or beneath the flat stones and lead a  more free and active life. The snow is their friend. It keeps off the  cold, and it shields their movements from the eyes of their enemies, the  owls, hawks, and foxes. Now they can venture abroad from their retreats  without fear. They make little tunnels and roadways everywhere over the  surface of the ground. They build winter houses under the great drifts.  They found little mouse colonies in places where they have never been in  summer. The conditions of life with them are entirely changed. They can  get at the roots of the grasses, or the various herbs and seeds they  feed upon, as well as in the snowless seasons, and without exposure to  their enemies.    I fancy they have great times there beneath the drifts. Maybe they have  their picnics and holidays then as we have ours in summer. When the  drifts disappear in spring, you may often see where they have had their  little encampments: a few square yards of the pasture or meadow bottom  will look as if a map had been traced upon it; tunnels and highways  running and winding in every direction and connecting the nests of dry  grass, which might stand for the cities and towns on the map. These  runways are smooth and round like pipes, and only a little larger than  the bodies of the mice. I think it is only the meadow field-mouse that  lives in this way beneath the snow.    I met one of these mice in my travels one day under peculiar conditions.  He was on his travels also, and we met in the middle of a mountain lake.  I was casting my fly there, when I saw, just sketched or etched upon the  glassy surface, a delicate V-shaped figure, the point of which reached  about to the middle of the lake, while the two sides, as they diverged,  faded out toward the shore. I saw the point of this V was being slowly  pushed across the lake. I drew near in my boat, and beheld a little  mouse swimming vigorously for the opposite shore. His little legs  appeared like swiftly revolving wheels beneath him. As I came near, he  dived under the water to escape me, but came up again like a cork and  just as quickly. It was laughable to see him repeatedly duck beneath the  surface and pop back again in a twinkling. He could not keep under water  more than a second or two. Presently I reached him my oar, when he ran  up it and into the palm of my hand, where he sat for some time and  arranged his fur and warmed himself. He did not show the slightest fear.  It was probably the first time he had ever shaken hands with a human  being. He had doubtless lived all his life in the woods, and was  strangely unsophisticated. How his little round eyes did shine, and how  he sniffed me to find out if I was more dangerous than I appeared to his  sight!    After a while I put him down in the bottom of the boat and resumed my  fishing. But it was not long before he became very restless, and  evidently wanted to go about his business. He would climb up to the edge  of the boat and peer down into the water. Finally he could brook the  delay no longer and plunged boldly overboard; but he had either changed  his mind or lost his reckoning, for he started back in the direction  from which he had come, and the last I saw of him he was a mere speck  vanishing in the shadows near the shore.    Later on I saw another mouse, while we were at work in the fields, that  interested me also. This one was our native white-footed mouse. We  disturbed the mother with her young in her nest, and she rushed out with  her little ones clinging to her teats. A curious spectacle she  presented as she rushed along, as if slit and torn into rags. Her pace  was so hurried that two of the young could not keep their hold and were  left in the weeds. We remained quiet, and presently the mother came back  looking for them. When she had found one, she seized it as a cat seizes  her kitten and made off with it. In a moment or two she came back and  found the other one and carried it away. I was curious to see if the  young would take hold of her teats again as at first, and be dragged  away in that manner, but they did not. It would be interesting to know  if they seize hold of their mother by instinct when danger threatens, or  if they simply retain the hold which they already have. I believe the  flight of the family always takes place in this manner with this species  of mouse.    I suspect that our white-footed mouse is capable of lending a hand to a  fellow in distress; at least, the following incident looks like it. One  season they overran my cabin in the woods, and gave me a good deal of  annoyance; so much so that I tried trapping them, using the ordinary  circular trap with four or five holes and wire springs. One night I  heard the trap spring in the attic over my head, followed by the kicking  and straggling of the mouse. This continued for a few moments, when all  was still. \"There,\" I said, \"that mouse is dead.\" Presently the rattling  of the trap recommenced, and continued so long at short intervals that  going to sleep was out of the question. I fancied the mouse was too  strong for the trap, so I went upstairs to investigate. The captive was  dead, sure enough, and I was more puzzled than ever. On examining him  closely, I found the fur on his back was wet and much rumpled. I  concluded, therefore, that his companions had seized him there, and had  been tugging away at him to drag him out of the trap, causing the  rattling I had heard. No other explanation seems probable.      The least mammal in our woods is the little mouse-like shrew, scarcely  more than three inches long, tail and all. And it is the shyest and  least known. One gets a glimpse of it only at rare intervals, while  sitting or standing motionless in the woods. There is a slight rustle  under the leaves, and you may see a tiny form dart across a little  opening in the leafy carpet. Its one dread seems to be exposure to the  light. If it were watched and waited for by a hundred enemies, it could  hardly be more hurried and cautious in its movements. And when once  captured and fairly exposed to the light, it soon dies, probably of  fright. One night in midsummer, when I was camping in the woods, one of  them got into an empty tin pail and was dead in the morning. A teacher  caught one in a delusion trap, and attempted to take it to her school,  to show her children, but it was dead when she got there. In winter it  makes little tunnels under the snow in the woods, now and then coming to  the surface, and, after a few jumps, diving under the snow again. Its  tracks are like the most delicate stitching. I have never found its nest  or seen its young. Like all the shrews, it lives mainly upon worms and  insects.      The track of one of our native mice we do not see upon the snow,--that  of the jumping mouse. So far as I know, it is the only one of our mice  that hibernates. It is much more rare than its cousin the deer mouse, or  white-footed mouse, and I have never known it to be found in barns or  dwellings. I think I have heard it called the kangaroo mouse, because of  its form and its manner of running, which is in long leaps. Its fore  legs are small and short, and its hind legs long and strong. It bounds  along, leaping two or more feet at a time. I used to see it when a boy,  but have not met with one for many years.    [Illustration: JUMPING MOUSE]    One summer, a boy who lives in Dutchess County, across the Hudson from  my house, caught four of these mice in a wire trap, two males and two  females. The boy said that when he picked up the trap the two males fell  dead, from fright he thought. One of the females died in October, but  the other lived and began hibernating early in November. He took it to  his teacher in New York, who kept it through the winter. She made a  pocket for it in a woolen sock, but it was not suited with it, for in  January it woke up and made itself a neat little blanket from the wool  which it nibbled from the sock. In this it rolled itself and went to  sleep again. A week or two later I was at the school, and the teacher  showed me her sleeping mouse. It was rolled up in a ball, with its tail  wrapped about its head. I held it in the palm of my hand. It seemed  almost as cold as a dead mouse, and I could not see it breathe. It was  carefully put back in its blanket.    Not long after this, a small house-mouse was put in the box with it. \"It  was the tiniest little mouse,\" says Miss Burt, \"you ever saw. It cuddled  in with the hibernator, who got up at once and took care of this baby.  The baby struck out"]]]
