One morning the feud came to a crisis. When Honor opened her desk she  found inside a neat little collection of new potatoes, and on the top,  pinned to the biggest, a paper in Flossie's handwriting, bearing these  lines:        HONOR'S WISH        Oh, Erin, moist Erin, how damp are thy showers!        I would I were back 'mid thy pigs and thy rills!      The \"tater\" to me is more dear than thy flowers,        And I relish the rain on thy ever-wet hills.    Honor could not help laughing at this, in spite of the aspersion on the  climate of her country. Such a quip, however, could not go unrequited,  and she sought for means of retaliation. She decided that Flossie  deserved a \"booby trap\", and fled back early to the classroom after  lunch, to set it for her. It was a rather difficult and delicate  operation, for she did not wish to catch anybody else by mistake. She  balanced a big dictionary so that it rested on the top of the door and  the lintel of the doorway; then, stationing herself inside the room,  she held the handle firmly, lest someone should disturb her arrangement  by flinging back the door, which was just sufficiently wide open to  allow a single person to enter. She peeped every now and then into the  passage, on the look-out for Flossie, and admitted each returning girl  with caution and due warning.    \"Here she is at last!\" whispered Lettice, who was naughty enough to  enjoy practical jokes, and, after admiring the preparations, had  offered to act scout.    \"Is she really coming in next?\"    \"Yes; she's walking in front of May Thurston and Dorothea Chambers.\"    \"Are you certain?\"    \"Absolutely.\"    \"Then tell me when!\"    \"Now!\"    Honor pulled open the door, and down crashed the dictionary, tumbling  full on the head, not of Flossie Taylor, but (oh! horrible miscarriage  of justice!) of Miss Farrar herself. At exactly the wrong moment the  teacher had popped out of the next classroom, and, as Flossie had stood  politely aside to give her precedence, she had walked straight into the  trap destined for her pupil.    The dictionary was heavy, and in its fall its sharp corner caught Miss  Farrar on the cheek. She stopped, almost dazed by the sudden blow, and,  pressing her handkerchief to her face, drew it back marked with a red  stain. At the sight of the blood Honor uttered a shriek, and, rushing  from the room, fled down the passage, as if to escape from the horror  of what she had done. In almost a state of panic she ran across the  quadrangle, and, turning into the garden, sought refuge inside the  tool-shed. Here she was found some time afterwards by Janie, who had  been sent to look for her, and had vainly searched St. Chad's and every  other likely spot of which she could think.    Honor never did things by halves; if she wept, she wept, and at present  she was a perfect Niobe, almost drowned in tears. When she saw Janie  she gave her streaming eyes a hasty mop with a very wet  pocket-handkerchief.    \"Have I killed her?\" she asked, in a tragic whisper.    \"Of course not!\" replied Janie. \"It was only a small cut on the cheek.  It's all right now it has been bathed with cold water.\"    \"I was afraid they'd bring it in murder,\" groaned Honor. \"Oh, the ill  luck of it, that it should have been Miss Farrar! And the dictionary  came down with such a frightful bang! I can never look her in the face  again.\"    \"You'll have to!\" said Janie. \"I was sent to fetch you back at once.  You needn't be afraid, Miss Farrar has taken it so nicely.\"    Poor Honor's apologies and the depths of her genuine remorse would have  melted the hardest of hearts, much more that of her teacher.    \"We'll say no more about it,\" declared Miss Farrar. \"All the same,  remember that I cannot allow such things to happen in the classroom.  You might have hurt Flossie very seriously. No, my scratch is nothing!  It will be healed directly. But if you are really sorry, Honor, you  must give me your most solemn promise that you will never play such a  dangerous practical joke again.\"          CHAPTER VII    St. Chad's Celebrates an Occasion      During her first few days at Chessington, Honor had considered the  College as little better than a prison; but as time went on and she  grew more accustomed to the routine, she began to reverse her opinion.  After all, it was pleasant to have companionship. The various fresh  interests, the many jokes, amusements, and constant small excitements  inseparable from a large community of girls seemed to open out a new  phase of existence for her.    \"I'd no idea what school was like before I came,\" she confided to  Janie. \"Of course, the boys were always talking of the things they did,  and of the fagging and bullying and ragging that went on, but I was  sure they were piling on the horror for my benefit, and that it wasn't  really as bad as they pretended.\"    \"Why, no one bullies at girls' schools,\" said Janie.    \"I know they don't; but Derrick and Dermot stuffed me with all kinds of  ridiculous tales, just for the sake of teasing. They said that  Chessington was exactly on the model of a boys' college, and that if  girls learnt Latin and mathematics, and played cricket and hockey, and  had a gymnasium and a debating society, it put such a masculine element  into them that they couldn't refrain from using brute force, instead of  any other means of persuasion. They declared it was a natural sequence,  and I must make up my mind to it. Derrick even offered to teach me to  box before I came, as a useful accomplishment!\"    \"Did you accept?\"    \"No, thank you!--not after the way I'd seen him knock Brian about. I  suppose brothers are always teases.\"    \"I've no experience, because I haven't any brothers. I've nobody except  Mother; but she's as good as a whole family combined.\" When Janie  mentioned her mother her eyes always shone, and her face would light  up. It was evident the two were everything to one another, and that the  separation during term-time was a hardship.    \"I didn't want to go to school at all,\" continued Honor; \"not, of  course, because I believed Derrick's absurd stories, but simply because  I was so fond of home that I hated to leave.\"    \"That's just how I felt. Mother and I had such a delightful time  together, I was sure Chessington couldn't be half so nice.\"    \"What used you to do? You've scarcely told me anything about your home,  though I often talk about Kilmore.\"    \"We live in quite a quiet place,\" began Janie, \"though it's not so  out-of-the-world as Kerry. Our house is at Redcliffe, a village a few  miles from Tewkesminster. It's a beautiful country. There are lovely  farms, with red-tiled roofs and big orchards and picturesque barns; and  there's a splendid old castle overlooking the river. And then the  trees! You ought to see our trees! These about Chessington look the  most wretched, stunted things, after our grand oaks and elms. It's a  great fruit-growing neighbourhood; we have heaps and heaps of apples  and pears and plums and apricots in our garden. They're simply  delicious when they're ripe. Then Tewkesminster is so quaint! There are  all kinds of funny little side streets, with cottages built at odd  angles; and there's a market cross and several old churches, as well as  the Minster. Mother is extremely fond of painting, and sometimes she  takes me out sketching with her. I can't draw very well yet--most of my  attempts are horrid daubs! but Mother is such a good teacher, she  always makes one want to try.\"    \"Hadn't you a governess?\" asked Honor.    \"Yes. Miss Hall used to come every day from Tewkesminster; but I had a  few lessons from Mother as well, in drawing, and Greek history, and  English literature. We used to read books aloud in the evenings--Shakespeare,  or Dickens, or sometimes Tennyson or Wordsworth. We got through a  tremendous amount of poetry in the winter, when it was dark early, and  we had nothing else to do, except sit by the fire. We read all _Marmion_  and the _Idylls of the King_ and _Lalla Rookh_, as well as shorter  pieces. Mother reads aloud most beautifully; it's delightful to listen  to her. Then in summer-time we used to go country walks, and find wild  flowers, and bring them back and hunt out their names in the botany  book. I kept a Nature Calendar, and put down everything I noted--when  the first violets were out, and when I heard the cuckoo, or saw a  swallow for the first time in the year; and what birds' nests I found,  or butterflies, or moths, or caterpillars. Sometimes I drew pictures of  them as well. I had a whole row of specimen sheets pinned round the  school-room at home. Then one day a wretched doctor told Mother that  Tewkesminster was too relaxing a place for me, and recommended  Chessington. I begged and implored not to be sent away, but Mother said  the doctor was quite right, and that I was far too grown-up for my age,  and an only child ought to have young companions, so I must certainly go  to school at once. I was absolutely miserable my first term. I'm a  little more used to it now, but I begin to count the days to the  holidays directly I get back to St. Chad's. There are still eight weeks  before we break up!\"    Janie spoke of home with the intense longing of a girl who is not  naturally fond of the social side of life. She was out of her element  at Chessington, and the strenuous bustle and stimulating whirl of the  place, which began to mean so much to Honor, were repugnant to her  quiet, reserved disposition. In every big school there are Janies,  isolated characters not quite able to run the pace required by the  inexorable code of public opinion, interesting to the one or two who  may happen to discover their good points, but to the mass of their  companions merely names and faces in class.

In theory and  practice, however, he really was anti-democratic. Masses of men seemed  to him incapable alike of judgment and of action, and he thought no  enduring authority could be based upon the instincts of the \"great  beast,\" as he called the mob. He looked for such authority and what  seemed to him the example of history, and especially to the example of  England. He knew how powerful both at home and abroad was the governing  machine which the English aristocracy had established after the  revolution of 1689; and he realized more fully than most men of that  age, or indeed of this, that its strength lay in a small but very  national governing class wielding the people as an instrument. Such a  class he wished to create in America, to connect closely, as the English  oligarchy had connected itself closely, with the great moneyed  interests, and to entrust with the large powers which in his judgment  the central government of the Federation needed.    Jefferson came back from France in the winter of 1789, and was at once  offered by Washington the Secretaryship of State. The offer was not a  very welcome one, for he was hot with the enthusiasm of the great French  struggle, and would gladly have returned to Paris and watched its  progress. He felt, however, that the President's insistence laid upon  him the duty of giving the Government the support of his abilities and  popularity. He had accepted the Constitution which he had no share in  framing, not perhaps as exactly what he would have desired, but  certainly in full good faith and without reserve. It probably satisfied  him at least as well as it satisfied Hamilton, who had actually at one  time withdrawn from the Convention in protest against its refusal to  accept his views. Jefferson's criticisms, such as they were, related  mostly to matters of detail: some of them were just and some were  subsequently incorporated in amendments. But there is ample evidence  that for none of them was he prepared to go the length of opposing or  even delaying the settlement. It is also worth noting that none of them  related to the balance of power between the Federal and State  Governments, upon which Jefferson is often loosely accused of holding  extreme particularist views. As a fact he never held such views. His  formula that \"the States are independent as to everything within  themselves and united as to everything respecting foreign nations\" is  really a very good summary of the principles upon which the  Constitution is based, and states substantially the policy which all the  truest friends of the Union have upheld. But he was committed out and  out to the principle of popular government, and when it became obvious  that the Federalists under Hamilton's leadership were trying to make the  central government oligarchical, and that they were very near success,  Jefferson quite legitimately invoked and sought to confirm the large  powers secured by the Constitution itself to the States for the purpose  of obstructing their programme.    It was some time, however, before the antagonism between the two  Secretaries became acute, and meanwhile the financial genius of Hamilton  was reducing the economic chaos bequeathed by the war to order and  solvency. All of his measures showed fertility of invention and a  thorough grasp of his subject; some of them were unquestionably  beneficial to the country. But a careful examination will show how  closely and deliberately he was imitating the English model which we  know to have been present to his mind. He established a true National  Debt similar to that which Montague had created for the benefit of  William of Orange. In this debt he proposed to merge the debts of the  individual States contracted during the War of Independence. Jefferson  saw no objection to this at the time, and indeed it was largely through  his favour that a settlement was made which overcame the opposition of  certain States.    This settlement had another interest as being one of the perennial  geographical compromises by means of which the Union was for so long  preserved. The support of Hamilton's policy came mainly from the North;  the opposition to it from the South. It so happened that coincidentally  North and South were divided on another question, the position of the  projected Capital of the Federation. The Southerners wanted it to be on  the Potomac between Virginia and Maryland; the Northerners would have  preferred it further north. At Jefferson's house Hamilton met some of  the leading Southern politicians, and a bargain was struck. The  Secretary's proposal as to the State debts was accepted, and the South  had its way in regard to the Capital. Hamilton probably felt that he  had bought a solid advantage in return for a purely sentimental  concession. Neither he nor anyone else could foresee the day of peril  when the position of Washington between the two Southern States would  become one of the gravest of the strategic embarrassments of the Federal  Government.    Later, when Hamilton's policy and personality had become odious to him,  Jefferson expressed remorse for his conduct of the occasion, and blamed  his colleague for taking advantage of his ignorance of the question. His  sincerity cannot be doubted, but it will appear to the impartial  observer that his earlier judgment was the wiser of the two. The  assumption of State debts had really nothing \"monocratic\" or  anti-popular about it--nothing even tending to infringe the rights and  liberties of the several States--while it was clearly a statesmanlike  measure from the national standpoint, tending at once to restore the  public credit and cement the Union. But Jefferson read backwards into  this innocuous and beneficent stroke of policy the spirit which he  justly perceived to inform the later and more dubious measures which  proceeded from the same author.    Of these the most important was the creation of the first United States  Bank. Here Hamilton was quite certainly inspired by the example of the  English Whigs. He knew how much the stability of the settlement made in  1689 had owed to the skill and foresight with which Montague, through  the creation of the Bank of England, had attached to it the great  moneyed interests of the City. He wished, through the United States  Bank, to attach the powerful moneyed interests of the Eastern and Middle  States in the same fashion to the Federal Government. This is how he and  his supporters would have expressed it. Jefferson said that he wished to  fill Congress with a crowd of mercenaries bound by pecuniary ties to the  Treasury and obliged to lend it, through good and evil repute, a  perennial and corrupt support. The two versions are really only  different ways of stating the same thing. To a democrat such a standing  alliance between the Government and the rich will always seem a corrupt  thing--nay, the worst and least remediable form of corruption. To a man  of Hamilton's temper it seemed merely the necessary foundation of a  stable political equilibrium. Thus the question of the Bank really  brought the two parties which were growing up in the Cabinet and in the  nation to an issue which revealed the irreconcilable antagonism of their  principles.    The majority in Congress was with Hamilton; but his opponents appealed  to the Constitution. They denied the competency of Congress under that  instrument to establish a National Bank. When the Bill was in due course  sent to Washington for signature he asked the opinions of his Cabinet on  the constitutional question, and both Hamilton and Jefferson wrote very  able State Papers in defence of their respective views. After some  hesitation Washington decided to sign the Bill and to leave the question  of constitutional law to the Supreme Court. In due course it was  challenged there, but Marshal, the Chief Justice, was a decided  Federalist, and gave judgment in favour of the legality of the Bank.    The Federalists had won the first round. Meanwhile the party which  looked to Jefferson as leader was organizing itself. It took the name of  \"Republican,\" as signifying its opposition to the alleged monarchical  designs of Hamilton and his supporters. Later, when it appeared that  such a title was really too universal to be descriptive, the  Jeffersonians began to call themselves by the more genuinely  characteristic title of \"Democratic Republicans,\" subsequently  abbreviated into \"Democrats.\" That name the party which, alone among  American parties, can boast an unbroken historic continuity of more than  a century, retains to this day.    At the end of his original term of four years, Washington was prevailed  upon to give way to the universal feeling of the nation and to accept a  second term. No party thought of opposing him, but a significant  division appeared over the Vice-Presidency. The Democrats ran Clinton  against John Adams of Massachusetts, and though they failed there  appeared in the voting a significant alliance, which was to determine  the politics of a generation. New York State, breaking away from her  Northern neighbours, voted with the Democratic South for Clinton. And  the same year saw the foundation in New York City of that dubious but  very potent product of democracy, which has perhaps become the best  abused institution in the civilized world, yet has somehow or other  contrived to keep in that highly democratic society a power which it  could never retain for a day without a genuine popular backing--Tammany  Hall.    Meanwhile the destinies of every nation of European origin, and of none  perhaps more, in spite of their geographical remoteness, than of the  United States, were being profoundly influenced by the astonishing  events that were shaping themselves in Western Europe.
