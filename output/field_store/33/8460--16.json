The cruel jaws of the jag-toothed trap had  seized him by both paws, so he was held helpless. The trap was champed  and wet with blood and froth when Grogan came in the morning. Of what  use are courage and strength when one cannot reach the foe? The Badger  craved only a fair fight, but Grogan stood out of reach and used a club  till the light was gone from the brave eyes and the fighting snarl was  still.    The trap was reset in the sand and Grogan went. He carried the dead  Badger to the Service house to show his prize and get help to skin it,  after which he set off for the town and bartered the skin for what evil  indulgence it might command, and thought no more of the trap for three  days. Meanwhile the mother Badger, coming home at dawn, was caught by  one foot. Strain as she might, that deadly grip still held her; all that  night and all the next day she struggled. She had little ones to care  for. Their hungry cries from down the burrow were driving her almost  mad; but the trap was of strong steel, beyond her strength, and at last  the crying of the little ones in the den grew still. On the second day  of her torture the mother, in desperation, chewed off one of her toes  and dragged her bleeding foot from the trap.    [Illustration]    Down the burrow she went first, but it was too late; her babies were  dead. She buried them where they lay and hastened from that evil spot.    Water was her first need, next food, and then at evening she made for an  old den she had used the fall before.      THE BADGER THAT RESCUED THE BOY    And little Harry, meanwhile, where was he? That sunny afternoon in June  he had wandered away from the house, and losing sight of the familiar  building behind the long fringe of trees by the river, he had lost his  bearings. Then came the thunder shower which made him seek for shelter.  There was nothing about him but level prairie, and the only shelter he  could find was a Badger hole, none too wide even for his small form.  Into this he had backed and stayed with some comfort during the  thunderstorm, which continued till night. Then in the evening the child  heard a sniffing sound, and a great, gray animal loomed up against the  sky, sniffed at the tracks and at the open door of the den. Next it put  its head in, and Harry saw by the black marks on its face that it was a  Badger. He had seen one just three days before. A neighbour had brought  it to his father's house to skin it. There it stood sniffing, and Harry,  gazing with less fear than most children, noticed that the visitor had  five claws on one foot and four on the other, with recent wounds, proof  of some sad experience in a trap. Doubtless this was the Badger's den,  for she--it proved a mother--came in, but Harry had no mind to  surrender. The Badger snarled and came on, and Harry shrieked, \"Get  out!\" and struck with his tiny fists, and then, to use his own words, \"I  scratched the Badger's face and she scratched mine.\" Surely this Badger  was in a generous mood, for she did him no serious harm, and though the  rightful owner of the den, she went away and doubtless slept elsewhere.    [Illustration]    Night came down. Harry was very thirsty. Close by the door was a pool of  rainwater. He crawled out, slaked his thirst, and backed into the warm  den as far as he could. Then remembering his prayers, he begged God to  \"send mamma,\" and cried himself to sleep. During the night he was  awakened by the Badger coming again, but it went away when the child  scolded it. Next morning Harry went to the pool again and drank. Now he  was so hungry; a few old rose hips hung on the bushes near the den. He  gathered and ate these, but was even hungrier. Then he saw something  moving out on the plain. It might be the Badger, so he backed into the  den, but he watched the moving thing. It was a horseman galloping. As it  came near, Harry saw that it was Grogan, the neighbour for whom he had  such a dislike, so he got down out of sight. Twice that morning men came  riding by, but having once yielded to his shy impulse, he hid again each  time. The Badger came back at noon. In her mouth she held the body of a  Prairie Chicken, pretty well plucked and partly devoured. She came into  the den sniffing as before. Harry shouted, \"Get out! Go away.\" The  Badger dropped the meat and raised her head. Harry reached and grasped  the food and devoured it with the appetite of one starving. There must  have been another doorway, for later the Badger was behind the child in  the den, and still later when he had fallen asleep she came and slept  beside him. He awoke to find the warm furry body filling the space  between him and the wall, and knew now why it was he had slept so  comfortably.    [Illustration]    That evening the Badger brought the egg of a Prairie Chicken and set it  down unbroken before the child. He devoured it eagerly, and again drank  from the drying mud puddle to quench his thirst. During the night it  rained again, and he would have been cold, but the Badger came and  cuddled around him. Once or twice it licked his face. The child could  not know, but the parents discovered later that this was a mother Badger  which had lost her brood and her heart was yearning for something to  love.    Now there were two habits that grew on the boy. One was to shun the  men that daily passed by in their search, the other was to look to  the Badger for food and protection, and live the Badger's life.  She brought him food often not at all to his taste--dead Mice or  Ground-squirrels--but several times she brought in the comb of a bee's  nest or eggs of game birds, and once a piece of bread almost certainly  dropped on the trail from some traveller's lunch bag. His chief trouble  was water. The prairie pool was down to mere ooze and with this he  moistened his lips and tongue. Possibly the mother Badger wondered why  he did not accept her motherly offerings. But rain came often enough to  keep him from serious suffering.    Their daily life was together now, and with the imitative power strong  in all children and dominant in him, he copied the Badger's growls,  snarls, and purrs. Sometimes they played tag on the prairie, but both  were ready to rush below at the slightest sign of a stranger.    Two weeks went by. Galloping men no longer passed each day. Harry and  the Badger had fitted their lives into each other's, and strange as it  may seem, the memory of his home was already blurred and weakened in the  boy. Once or twice during the second week men had passed near by, but  the habit of eluding them was now in full possession of him.      FINDING THE LOST ONE    [Illustration]    One morning he wandered a little farther in search of water and was  alarmed by a horseman appearing. He made for home on all fours--he ran  much on all fours now--and backed into the den. In the prairie grass he  was concealed, but the den was on a bare mound, and the horseman caught  a glimpse of a whitish thing disappearing down the hole. Badgers were  familiar to him, but the peculiar yellow of this and the absence of  black marks gave it a strange appearance. He rode up quietly within  twenty yards and waited.    After a few minutes the gray-yellow ball slowly reappeared and resolved  itself into the head of a tow-topped child. The young man leaped to the  ground and rushed forward, but the child retreated far back into the  den, beyond reach of the man, and refused to come out. Nevertheless,  there was no doubt that this was the missing Harry Service. \"Harry!  Harry! don't you know me? I'm your Cousin Jack,\" the young man said in  soothing, coaxing tones. \"Harry, won't you come out and let me take you  back to mamma? Come Harry! Look! here are some cookies!\" but all in  vain. The child hissed and snarled at him like a wild thing, and  retreated as far as he could till checked by a turn in the burrow.    [Illustration]    Now Jack got out his knife and began to dig until the burrow was large  enough for him to crawl in a little way. At once he succeeded in  getting hold of the little one's arm and drew him out struggling and  crying. But now there rushed also from the hole a Badger, snarling and  angry; it charged at the man, uttering its fighting snort. He fought it  off with his whip, then swung to the saddle with his precious burden and  rode away as for his very life, while the Badger pursued for a time, but  it was easily left behind, and its snorts were lost and forgotten.      HOME AGAIN    The father was coming in from another direction as he saw this strange  sight: a horse galloping madly over the prairie, on its back a young man  shouting loudly, and in his arms a small dirty child, alternately  snarling at his captor, trying to scratch his face, or struggling to be  free.    The father was used to changing intensity of feeling at these times, but  he turned pale and held his breath till the words reached him: \"I have  got him, thank God! He's all right,\" and he rushed forward shouting, \"My  boy! my boy!\"    [Illustration]    But he got a rude rebuff. The child glared like a hunted cat, hissed at  him, and menaced with hands held claw fashion. Fear and hate were all he  seemed to express. The door of the house was flung open and the  distracted mother, now suddenly overjoyed, rushed to join the group. \"My  darling! my darling!\" she sobbed, but little Harry was not as when he  left them. He hung back, he hid his face in the coat of his captor, he  scratched and snarled like a beast, he displayed his claws and  threatened fight, till strong arms gathered him up and placed him on his  mother's knees in the old, familiar room with the pictures, and the  clock ticking as of old, and the smell of frying bacon, his sister's  voice, and his father's form, and, above all, his mother's arms about  him, her magic touch on his brow, and her voice, \"My darling! my  darling! Oh!"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27901"],[0,"Jewish Literature and Other Essays (#15)"],[1,"foreign literatures, did not neglect the traditions of the Jews  themselves, and embraced even folk-songs, some of which have perpetuated  themselves until the modern era.    Mention of the well-known fact that the Hebrew studies prosecuted by  Christians in the eighteenth century were carried on under Jewish  influence brings us to the threshold of the modern era, the period of  the Jewish Renaissance. Here we are on well-worn ground. Since Jews have  been permitted to enter at will upon the multifarious pursuits growing  out of modern culture, their importance as factors of civilization is  universally acknowledged, and it would be wearisome, and would far  transgress the limits of a lecture, to enumerate their achievements.    In trying to show what share the Jew has had in the world's  civilization, I have naturally concerned myself chiefly with literature,  for literature is the mirror of culture. It would be a mistake, however,  to suppose that the Jew has been inactive in other spheres. His  contributions, for instance, to the modern development of international  commerce, cannot be overlooked. Commerce in its modern extension was the  creation of the mercantile republics of mediaeval Italy-Venice, Florence,  Genoa, and Pisa--and in them Jews determined and regulated its course.  When Ravenna contemplated a union with Venice, and formulated the  conditions for the alliance, one of them was the demand that rich Jews  be sent thither to open a bank for the relief of distress. Jews were the  first to obtain the privilege of establishing banks in the Italian  cities, and the first to discover the advantages of a system of checks  and bills of exchange, of unique value in the development of modern  commerce.    Even in art, a sphere from which their rigorous laws might seem to have  the effect of banishing them, they were not wholly inactive. They always  numbered among themselves handicraftsmen. In Venice, in the sixteenth  century, we find celebrated Jewish wood engravers. Jacob Weil's rules  for slaughtering were published with vignettes by Hans Holbein, and one  of Manasseh ben Israel's works was adorned with a frontispiece by  Rembrandt. In our own generation Jews have won fame as painters and  sculptors, while music has been their staunch companion, deserting them  not even in the darkest days of the Ghetto.    These certainly are abundant proofs that the Jew has a share in all the  phases and stages of culture, from its first germs unto its latest  complex development--a consoling, elevating reflection. A learned  historian of literature, a Christian, in discussing this subject, was  prompted to say: \"Our first knowledge of philosophy, botany, astronomy,  and cosmography, as well as the grammar of the holy language and the  results of biblical study, we owe primarily to Jews.\" Another historian,  also a Christian, closes a review of Jewish national traits with the  words: \"Looking back over the course of history, we find that in the  gloom, bareness, and intellectual sloth of the middle ages, Jews  maintained a rational system of agriculture, and built up international  commerce, upon which rests the well-being of the nations.\"    Truly, there are reasons for pride on our part, but no less do great  obligations devolve upon us. I cannot refrain from exhortation. In  justice we should confess that Jews drew their love of learning and  ability to advance the work of civilization from Jewish writings.  Furthermore, it is a fact that these Jewish writings no longer excite  the interest, or claim the devotion of Jews. I maintain that it is the  duty of the members of our Order to take this neglected, lightly  esteemed literature under their protection, and secure for it the  appreciation and encouragement that are the offspring of knowledge.    Modern Judaism presents a curious spectacle. The tiniest of national  groups in Eastern Europe, conceiving the idea of establishing its  independence, proceeds forthwith to create a literature, if need be,  inventing and forging. Judaism possesses countless treasures of  inestimable worth, amassed by research and experience in the course of  thousands of years, and her latter-day children brush them aside with  indifference, even with scorn, leaving it to the sons of the stranger,  yea, their adversaries, to gather and cherish them.    When Goethe in his old age conceived and outlined a scheme of universal  literature, the first place was assigned to Jewish literature. In his  pantheon of the world's poetry, the first tone uttered was to be that  of \"David's royal song and harp.\" But, in general, Jewish literature is  still looked upon as the Cinderella of the world's literatures. Surely,  the day will come when justice will be done, Cinderella's claim be  acknowledged equal to that of her royal sisters, and together they will  enter the spacious halls of the magnificent palace of literature.    Among the prayers prescribed for the Day of Atonement is one of  subordinate importance which affects me most solemnly. When the shadows  of evening lengthen, and the light of the sun wanes, the Jew reads the  _Neilah_ service with fervor, as though he would \"burst open the portals  of heaven with his tears,\" and the inmost depths of my nature are  stirred with melancholy pride by the prayer of the pious Jew. He  supplicates not for his house and his family, not for Zion dismantled,  not for the restoration of the Temple, not for the advent of the  Messiah, not for respite from suffering. All his sighs and hopes, all  his yearning and aspiration, are concentrated in the one thought: \"Our  splendor and our glory have departed, our treasures have been snatched  from us; there remains nothing to us but this Law alone.\" If this is  true; if naught else is left of our former state; if this Law, this  science, this literature, are our sole treasure and best inheritance,  then let us cherish and cultivate them so as to have a legacy to  bequeath to our children to stand them in good stead against the coming  of the _Neilah_ of humanity, the day when brethren will \"dwell together  in unity.\"    Perhaps that day is not far distant. Methinks I hear the rustling of a  new spring-tide of humanity; methinks I discern the morning flush of new  world-stirring ideas, and before my mind's eye rises a bridge, over  which pass all the nations of the earth, Israel in their midst, holding  aloft his ensign with the inscription, \"The Lord is my banner!\"--the one  which he bore on every battlefield of thought, and which was never  suffered to fall into the enemy's hand. It is a mighty procession moving  onward and upward to a glorious goal: \"Humanity, Liberty, Love!\"          WOMEN IN JEWISH LITERATURE      Among the songs of the Bible there are two, belonging to the oldest  monuments of poetry, which have preserved the power to inspire and  elevate as when they were first uttered: the hymn of praise and  thanksgiving sung by Moses and his sister Miriam, and the impassioned  song of Deborah, the heroine in Israel.    Miriam and Deborah are the first Israelitish women whose melody thrilled  and even now thrills us--Miriam, the inspired prophetess, pouring forth  her people's joy and sorrow, and Deborah, _Esheth Lapidoth_, the Bible  calls her, \"the woman of the flaming heart,\" an old writer ingeniously  interprets the Scriptural name. They are the chosen exemplars of all  women who, stepping across the narrow confines of home, have lifted up a  voice, or wielded a pen, for Israel. The time is not yet when woman in  literature can be discussed without an introductory justification. The  prejudice is still deep-rooted which insists that domestic activity is  woman's only legitimate career, that to enter the literary arena is  unwomanly, that inspired songs may drop only from male lips. Woman's  heart should, indeed, be the abode of the angels of gentleness, modesty,  kindness, and patience. But no contradiction is involved in the belief  that her mind is endowed with force and ability on occasion to grasp the  spokes of fortune's wheel, or produce works which need not shrink from  public criticism. Deborah herself felt that it would have better become  a man to fulfil the mission with which she was charged--that a cozy home  had been a more seemly place for her than the camp upon Mount Tabor. She  says: \"Desolate were the open towns in Israel, they were desolate....  Was there a shield seen or a spear among forty thousand in Israel?...  I--unto the Lord will I sing.\" Not until the fields of Israel were  desert, forsaken of able-bodied men, did the woman Deborah arise for the  glory of God. She refused to pose as a heroine, rejected the crown of  victory, nor coveted the poet's laurel, meet recognition of her  triumphal song. Modestly she chose the simplest yet most beautiful of  names. She summoned the warriors to battle; the word of God was  proclaimed by her lips; she pronounced judgment, and right prevailed;  her courage sustained her on the battlefield, and victory followed in  her footsteps--yet neither judge, nor poetess, nor singer, nor  prophetess will she call herself, but only _Em beyisrael_, \"a mother in  Israel.\"    This heroine, this \"mother in Israel,\" in all the wanderings and  vicissitudes of the Jewish people, was the exemplar of its women and  maidens, the especial model of Israelitish poetesses and writers.    The student of Jewish literature is like an astronomer. While the casual  observer faintly discerns single stars dotted in the expanse of blue  overhead, he takes in the whole sweep of the heavens, readily following  the movements of the stars of every magnitude. The history of the Jewish  race, its mere preservation during the long drawn out period of  suffering--sad days of national dissolution and sombre middle age  centuries--is a perplexing puzzle, unless regarded with the eye of  faith. But that this race, cuffed, crushed, pursued, hounded from spot  to spot,"]]]
