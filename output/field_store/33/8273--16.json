This is a point of such importance with him, that he  always takes upon himself the charge of catering; and a man admitted  to his mess, is always sure of eating delicate victuals, and drinking  excellent wine--He owns himself addicted to the delights of the stomach,  and often jokes upon his own sensuality; but there is nothing selfish in  this appetite--He finds that good chear unites good company, exhilerates  the spirits, opens the heart, banishes all restraint from conversation,  and promotes the happiest purposes of social life. But Mr James Quin  is not a subject to be discussed in the compass of one letter; I shall  therefore, at present, leave him to his repose, and call another of a  very different complexion.    You desire to have further acquaintance with the person of our aunt,  and promise yourself much entertainment from her connexion with Sir Ulic  Mackilligut: but in this hope you are baulked already; that connexion is  dissolved. The Irish baronet is an old hound, that, finding her carrion,  has quitted the scent--I have already told you, that Mrs Tabitha Bramble  is a maiden of forty-five. In her person, she is tall, raw-boned,  aukward, flat-chested, and stooping; her complexion is sallow and  freckled; her eyes are not grey, but greenish, like those of a cat, and  generally inflamed; her hair is of a sandy, or rather dusty hue; her  forehead low; her nose long, sharp, and, towards the extremity, always  red in cool weather; her lips skinny, her mouth extensive, her teeth  straggling and loose, of various colours and conformation; and her long  neck shrivelled into a thousand wrinkles--In her temper, she is proud,  stiff, vain, imperious, prying, malicious, greedy, and uncharitable. In  all likelihood, her natural austerity has been soured by disappointment  in love; for her long celibacy is by no means owing to her dislike of  matrimony: on the contrary, she has left no stone unturned to avoid the  reproachful epithet of old maid.    Before I was born, she had gone such lengths in the way of flirting  with a recruiting officer, that her reputation was a little singed. She  afterwards made advances to the curate of the parish, who dropped some  distant hints about the next presentation to the living, which was in  her brother's gift; but finding that was already promised to another, he  flew off at a tangent; and Mrs Tabby, in revenge, found means to deprive  him of his cure. Her next lover was lieutenant of a man of war, a  relation of the family, who did not understand the refinements of the  passion, and expressed no aversion to grapple with cousin Tabby in the  way of marriage; but before matters could be properly adjusted, he went  out on a cruise, and was killed in an engagement with a French frigate.  Our aunt, though baffled so often, did not yet despair. She layed all  her snares for Dr Lewis, who is the fidus Achates of my uncle. She even  fell sick upon the occasion, and prevailed with Matt to interpose in her  behalf with his friend; but the Doctor, being a shy cock, would not be  caught with chaff, and flatly rejected the proposal: so that Mrs Tabitha  was content to exert her patience once more, after having endeavoured  in vain to effect a rupture betwixt the two friends; and now she thinks  proper to be very civil to Lewis, who is become necessary to her in the  way of his profession.    These, however, are not the only efforts she has made towards a nearer  conjunction with our sex. Her fortune was originally no more than a  thousand pounds; but she gained an accession of five hundred by the  death of a sister, and the lieutenant left her three hundred in his  will. These sums she has more than doubled, by living free of all  expence, in her brother's house; and dealing in cheese and Welsh  flannel, the produce of his flocks and dairy. At present her capital is  increased to about four thousand pounds; and her avarice seems to grow  every day more and more rapacious: but even this is not so intolerable  as the perverseness of her nature, which keeps the whole family  in disquiet and uproar. She is one of those geniuses who find  some diabolical enjoyment in being dreaded and detested by their  fellow-creatures.    I once told my uncle, I was surprised that a man of his disposition  could bear such a domestic plague, when it could be so easily removed.  The remark made him sore, because it seemed to tax him with want of  resolution--Wrinkling up his nose, and drawing down his eye-brows, 'A  young fellow (said he) when he first thrusts his snout into the world,  is apt to be surprised at many things which a man of experience knows  to be ordinary and unavoidable--This precious aunt of yours is become  insensibly a part of my constitution--Damn her! She's a noli me tangere  in my flesh, which I cannot bear to be touched or tampered with.' I made  no reply; but shifted the conversation. He really has an affection for  this original; which maintains its ground in defiance of common sense,  and in despite of that contempt which he must certainly feel for her  character and understanding. Nay, I am convinced, that she has likewise  a most virulent attachment to his person; though her love never shews  itself but in the shape of discontent; and she persists in tormenting  him out of pure tenderness--The only object within doors upon which she  bestows any marks of affection, in the usual stile, is her dog Chowder;  a filthy cur from Newfoundland, which she had in a present from the wife  of a skipper in Swansey. One would imagine she had distinguished this  beast with her favour on account of his ugliness and ill-nature, if it  was not, indeed, an instinctive sympathy, between his disposition and  her own. Certain it is, she caresses him without ceasing; and even  harasses the family in the service of this cursed animal, which, indeed,  has proved the proximate cause of her breach with Sir Ulic Mackilligut.    You must know, she yesterday wanted to steal a march of poor Liddy, and  went to breakfast in the Room without any other companion than her dog,  in expectation of meeting with the Baronet, who had agreed to dance with  her in the evening--Chowder no sooner made his appearance in the Room,  than the Master of the Ceremonies, incensed at his presumption, ran  up to drive him away, and threatened him with his foot; but the other  seemed to despise his authority, and displaying a formidable case of  long, white, sharp teeth, kept the puny monarch at bay--While he stood  under some trepidation, fronting his antagonist, and bawling to the  waiter, Sir Ulic Mackilligut came to his assistance; and seeming  ignorant of the connexion between this intruder and his mistress, gave  the former such a kick in the jaws, as sent him howling to the door--Mrs  Tabitha, incensed at this outrage, ran after him, squalling in a tone  equally disagreeable; while the Baronet followed her on one side,  making apologies for his mistake; and Derrick on the other, making  remonstrances upon the rules and regulations of the place.    Far from being satisfied with the Knight's excuses, she said she was  sure he was no gentleman; and when the Master of the Ceremonies offered  to hand her into the chair, she rapped him over the knuckles with her  fan. My uncle's footman being still at the door, she and Chowder got  into the same vehicle, and were carried off amidst the jokes of the  chairmen and other populace--I had been riding out on Clerkendown, and  happened to enter just as the fracas was over--The Baronet, coming up to  me with an affected air of chagrin, recounted the adventure; at which  I laughed heartily, and then his countenance cleared up. 'My dear soul  (said he) when I saw a sort of a wild baist, snarling with open mouth  at the Master of the Ceremonies, like the red cow going to devour Tom  Thumb, I could do no less than go to the assistance of the little man;  but I never dreamt the baist was one of Mrs Bramble's attendants--O! if  I had, he might have made his breakfast upon Derrick and welcome--But  you know, my dear friend, how natural it is for us Irishmen to blunder,  and to take the wrong sow by the ear--However, I will confess judgment,  and cry her mercy; and it is to be hoped, a penitent sinner may be  forgiven.' I told him, that as the offence was not voluntary of his  side, it was to be hoped he would not find her implacable.    But, in truth, all this concern was dissembled. In his approaches of  gallantry to Mrs Tabitha, he had been misled by a mistake of at least  six thousand pounds, in the calculation of her fortune; and in this  particular he was just undeceived. He, therefore, seized the first  opportunity of incurring her displeasure decently, in such a manner as  would certainly annihilate the correspondence; and he could not have  taken a more effectual method, than that of beating her dog. When he  presented himself at our door, to pay his respects to the offended fair,  he was refused admittance, and given to understand that he should never  find her at home for the future. She was not so inaccessible to Derrick,  who came to demand satisfaction for the insult she had offered to him,  even in the verge of his own court. She knew it was convenient to be  well with the Master of the Ceremonies, while she continued to frequent  the Rooms; and, having heard he was a poet, began to be afraid of making  her appearance in a ballad or lampoon.--She therefore made excuses  for what she had done, imputing it to the flutter of her spirits; and  subscribed handsomely for his poems: so that he was perfectly appeased,  and overwhelmed her with a profusion of compliment. He even solicited a  reconciliation with Chowder; which, however, the latter declined; and he  declared, that if he could find a precedent in the annals of the Bath,  which he would carefully examine for that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21614"],[0,"For the Temple: A Tale of the Fall of Jerusalem (#15)"],[1," rock for a  fortnight.    Death, then, certain and inevitable, awaited them; and yet, an  occasional wail from some woman, as she pressed her children to her  breast, alone told of the despair which reigned in every heart. The  greater portion looked out, silent, and as if stupefied. They had  relied, absolutely, on the mountains and forests to block the  progress of the invader. They had thought that, at the worst, they  would have had to deal with a few companies of infantry, only.  Thus, the sight of the sixty thousand Roman troops--swelled to nigh  a hundred thousand, by the camp followers and artificers--with its  cavalry and machines of war, seemed like some terrible nightmare.    After making the circuit of the rock, and wandering for some time  among the impromptu camps in the streets, John returned to a group  of boys whom he had noticed, leaning against the low wall with a  carelessness, as to the danger of a fall over the precipice, which  proved that they must be natives of the place.    \"If there be any possible way of descending these precipices,\" he  said to himself, \"it will be the boys who will know of it. Where a  goat could climb, these boys, born among the mountains, would try  to follow; if only to excel each other in daring, and to risk  breaking their necks.\"    Thus thinking, he walked up to the group, who were from twelve to  fifteen years old.    \"I suppose you belong to the town?\" he began.    There was a general assent from the five boys, who looked with  considerable respect at John--who, although but two years the  senior of the eldest among them, wore a man's garb, and carried  sword and buckler.    \"I am one of the bodyguard of the governor,\" John went on, \"and I  dare say you can tell me all sorts of things, about this country,  that may be useful for him to know. Is it quite certain that no one  could climb up these rocks from below; and that there is no fear of  the Romans making a surprise, in that way?\"    The boys looked at each other, but no one volunteered to give  information.    \"Come!\" John went on, \"I have only just left off being a boy,  myself, and I was always climbing into all sorts of places, when I  got a chance; and I have no doubt it's the same, with you. When you  have been down below, there, you have tried how far you can get up.    \"Did you ever get up far, or did you ever hear of anyone getting up  far?\"    \"I expect I have been up as far as anyone,\" the eldest of the boys  said. \"I went up after a young kid that had strayed away from its  mother. I got up a long way--half way up, I should say--but I  couldn't get any further. I was barefooted, too.    \"I am sure no one with armor on could have got up anything like so  far. I don't believe he could get up fifty feet.\"    \"And have any of you ever tried to get down from above?\"    They shook their heads.    \"Jonas the son of James did, once,\" one of the smaller boys said.  \"He had a pet hawk he had tamed, and it flew away and perched, a  good way down; and he clambered down to fetch it. He had a rope  tied round him, and some of the others held it, in case he should  slip. I know he went down a good way, and he got the hawk; and his  father beat him for doing it, I know.\"    \"Is he here, now?\" John asked.    \"Yes, he is here,\" the boy said. \"That's his father's house, the  one close to the edge of the rock. I don't know whether you will  find him there, now. He ain't indoors more than he can help. His  own mother's dead, and his father's got another wife, and they  don't get on well together.\"    \"Well, I will have a chat with him, one of these days. And you are  all quite sure that there is no possible path up, from below?\"    \"I won't say there isn't any possible path,\" the eldest boy said;  \"but I feel quite sure there is not. I have looked, hundreds of  times, when I have been down below; and I feel pretty sure that, if  there had been any place where a goat could have got up, I should  have noticed it. But you see, the rock goes down almost straight,  in most places. Anyhow, I have never heard of anyone who ever got  up and, if anyone had done it, it would have been talked about, for  years and years.\"    \"No doubt it would,\" John agreed. \"So I shall tell the governor  that he need not be in the least uneasy about an attack, except in  front.\"    So saying, he nodded to the boys, and walked away again.    In the evening, the whole of the Roman army had arrived; and  Vespasian drew up his troops on a hill, less than a mile to the  north of the city, and there encamped them. The next morning, a  triple line of embankments was thrown up, by the Romans, around the  foot of the hill where, alone, escape or issue was possible; and  this entirely cut off those within the town from any possibility of  flight.    The Jews looked on at these preparations as wild animals might  regard a line of hunters surrounding them. But the dull despair of  the previous day had now been succeeded by a fierce rage. Hope  there was none. They must die, doubtless; but they would die  fighting fiercely, till the last. Disdaining to be pent up within  the walls, many of the fighting men encamped outside, and boldly  went forward to meet the enemy.    Vespasian called up his slingers and archers, and these poured  their missiles upon the Jews; while he himself, with his heavy  infantry, began to mount the slope towards the part of the wall  which appeared the weakest. Josephus at once summoned the fighting  men in the town and, sallying at their head through the gate,  rushed down and flung himself upon the Romans. Both sides fought  bravely; the Romans strong in their discipline, their skill with  their weapons, and their defensive armor; the Jews fighting with  the valor of despair, heightened by the thought of their wives and  children in the town, above.    The Romans were pushed down the hill, and the fight continued at  its foot until darkness came on, when both parties drew off. The  number of killed on either side was small, for the bucklers and  helmets defended the vital points. The Romans had thirteen killed  and very many wounded, the Jews seventeen killed and six hundred  wounded.    John had fought bravely by the side of Josephus. Joab and two  others of the little band were killed. All the others were wounded,  more or less severely; for Josephus was always in the front, and  his chosen followers kept close to him. In the heat of the fight,  John felt his spirits rise higher than they had done since the  troubles had begun. He had fought, at first, so recklessly that  Josephus had checked him, with the words:    \"Steady, my brave lad. He fights best who fights most coolly. The  more you guard yourself, the more you will kill.\"    More than once, when Josephus--whose commanding figure, and evident  leadership, attracted the attention of the Roman soldiers--was  surrounded and cut off, John, with three or four others, made their  way through to him, and brought him off.    When it became dark, both parties drew off; the Romans sullenly,  for they felt it a disgrace to have been thus driven back, by foes  they despised; the Jews with shouts of triumph, for they had proved  themselves a match for the first soldiers in the world, and the  dread with which the glittering column had inspired them had passed  away.    The following day, the Jews again sallied out and attacked the  Romans as they advanced and, for five days in succession, the  combat raged--the Jews fighting with desperate valor, the Romans  with steady resolution. At the end of that time, the Jews had been  forced back behind their wall, and the Romans established  themselves in front of it.    Vespasian, seeing that the wall could not be carried by assault, as  he had expected, called a council of war; and it was determined to  proceed by the regular process of a siege, and to erect a bank  against that part of the wall which offered the greatest facility  for attack. Accordingly the whole army, with the exception of the  troops who guarded the banks of circumvallation, went into the  mountains to get materials. Stone and timber, in vast quantities,  were brought down and, when these were in readiness, the work  commenced.    A sort of penthouse roofing, constructed of wattles covered with  earth, was first raised, to protect the workers from the missiles  of the enemy upon the wall; and here the working parties labored  securely, while the rest of the troops brought up earth, stone, and  wood for their use. The Jews did their best to interfere with the  work, hurling down huge stones upon the penthouse; sometimes  breaking down the supports of the roof and causing gaps, through  which they poured a storm of arrows and javelins, until the damage  had been repaired.    To protect his workmen, Vespasian brought up his siege engines--of  which he had a hundred and sixty--and, from these, vast quantities  of missiles were discharged at the Jews upon the walls. The  catapults threw javelins, balls of fire, and blazing arrows; while  the ballistae hurled huge stones, which swept lanes through the  ranks of the defenders. At the same time the light-armed troops,  the Arab archers, and those of Agrippa and Antiochus kept up a rain  of arrows, so that it became impossible for the Jews to remain on  the walls.    But they were not inactive. Sallying out in small parties, they  fell with fury upon the working parties who, having stripped off  their heavy armor, were unable to resist their sudden onslaughts.  Driving out and slaying all before them, the Jews so often applied  fire to the wattles and timbers of the bank that Vespasian was  obliged to make his work continuous, along the whole extent of the  wall, to keep out the assailants.    But, in spite of all the efforts of the Jews, the embankment rose  steadily, until it almost equaled the height of the wall; and the  struggle now went on between the combatants on even terms, they  being separated only by the"]]]
