[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22965"],[0,"Ten Thousand Miles with a Dog Sled (#15)"],[1,"we crossed two headwater forks of the Kokochatna, as the  Kobuks call it, or the Hogatzitna as the Koyukuks call it, or the Hog  River, as the white men call it, a tributary of the Koyukuk that comes  in about one hundred and fifty miles below the Alatna. As we came down a  steep descent to the little east fork, it showed so picturesque and  attractive, with clumps of fine open timber on an island, that it  remains in my mind one of the many places from the Grand Canon of the  Colorado almost to the Grand Canon of the Noatak, where I should like to  have a lodge in the vast wilderness.    We had but crossed the west fork when we knew that we were close to the  watershed between the Kobuk and the Koyukuk, between the streams that  fall into Kotzebue Sound and those that fall by the Koyukuk and the  Yukon Rivers into Bering Sea; and because it seemed a capital geographic  feature, it was disappointing that it was so inconspicuous. Indeed, we  were not sure which of two ridges was the actual divide. Beyond those  ridges there was no question, for the ground sloped down to Lake  Noyutak, a body of water some three and a half miles in length and of  varying breadth that drains into the Kobuk. Here in a cabin we found  three more young Kobuks, and spent the night, getting our first view of  the Kobuk River next day, not from an eminence, as I had hoped, but only  as we came down a bank through thick timber and opened suddenly upon it.  By the pedometer I made the portage forty-six miles.    [Sidenote: THE KOBUK RIVER]    The upper Kobuk is a picturesque river, the timber being especially  large and handsome for interior Alaska. We reached it just above the  mouth of the Reed River, tributary from the north. The weather was  warm--too warm for good travelling--the thermometer standing at 15--- deg.,  20 deg., and one day even 30 deg. above zero all day long, so that we were all  bareheaded and in our shirt-sleeves. From time to time, as the course of  the river varied, we had distant views of the rocky mountains of the  Endicott Range, or, as it might be written, the Endicott Range of the  Rocky Mountains, for such, in fact, it is--the western and final  extension of the great American cordillera. On the other side of those  mountains was the Noatak River, flowing roughly parallel with the Kobuk,  and discharging into the same arm of the sea.    The division of the labour of camping amongst four gave us all some  leisure at night, and I found time to read through again _The Cloister  and the Hearth_ and _Westward Ho!_ with much pleasure, quite agreeing  with Sir Walter Besant's judgment that the former is one of the best  historical novels ever written. There are few more attractive roysterers  in literature to me than Denys of Burgundy, with his \"_Courage,  camarades, le diable est mort!_\" This matter of winter reading is a  difficult one, because it is impossible to carry many books. My plan is  to take two or three India-paper volumes of classics that have been read  before, and renew my acquaintance with them. But reading by the light of  one candle, though it sufficed our forefathers, is hard on our  degenerate eyes.    The days were much lengthened now, and the worst of the winter was  done. There would still be cold and storm, but hardly again of the same  intensity and duration. When the traveller gets well into February he  feels that the back of the winter is broken, for nothing can take from  him the advantage of the ever-lengthening days, the ever-climbing sun.    On the afternoon of the third day on the Kobuk we reached a cabin  occupied by two white men, the first we had seen since we left Bettles,  and we were the first white men they had seen all the winter. They were  waiting for the spring, having a prospecting trip in view; simply  spending the winter eating up their grub. There was nothing whatever to  read in the cabin, and they had been there since the freeze-up! They  welcomed us, and we stayed overnight with them, and that night there was  a total eclipse of the moon, of which we had a fine view. We had an  almanac which gave the time of totality at Sitka, and we knew the  approximate longitude of our position, so we were able to set our  watches by it.    The next two days are noted in my diary as two of the pleasantest days  of the whole journey--two of the pleasantest days I ever spent anywhere,  I think. A clear, cloudless sky, brilliant sunshine, white mountain  peaks all about us, gave picture after picture, and the warm, balmy air  made travelling a delight. There are few greater pleasures than that of  penetrating into a new country, with continually changing views of  beauty, under kindly conditions of weather and trail. In the yellow rays  of the early sun, the spruce on the river bank looked like a screen of  carved bronze, while the slender stems of birches in front of the  spruce looked like an inlaying of old ivory upon the bronze, the whole  set upon its pedestal of marble-like snow. The second day we took a  portage of nine or ten miles across a barren flat and struck the river  again just below a remarkable stretch of bank a mile or so in length,  with never a tree or a bush or so much as the smallest shrub growing on  it. Thick timber above suddenly ceased, thick timber below suddenly  began again, and this bare bank reached back through open, barren flat  to a low pass in the mountains. It was a bank of solid ice, so we were  told later, and I remembered to have heard of ice bluffs on the Kobuk,  and wished that the portage had struck the river above this spot instead  of below it, that there might have been opportunity to examine it.    [Sidenote: THE MISSION]    [Sidenote: ENGLISH AND ESQUIMAU]    A little farther down the river and we were at the new mission of the  Society of Friends, where a cordial reception awaited us and, luxury of  luxuries, a warm bath! Again and again the wash-tub was emptied and  fresh water was heated until we all had wallowed to our heart's content.  The rude log buildings of the mission had been begun the previous fall,  and were not yet complete, but they were advanced enough for occupation,  and the work of the mission went actively on. It was in charge of rather  an extraordinary man. He gave us a sketch of his life, which was full of  interest and matter for thought. For many years he was a police officer  and jailer in the West. Then he sailed on a whaler and thus became  acquainted with the Esquimaux. He was converted from a life of  drunkenness and debauchery--though one fancied his character was not  really ever so bad as he painted it--at a \"Peniel\" mission in a  Californian town. He went in out of mere idle curiosity, just recovered  from a spree, and was so wrought upon that when he came out he was a  different creature, a new man, the old life with its appetite for  vicious indulgence sloughed off and left behind him, and he now  possessed with a burning desire to do some such active service for God  as aforetime he had done for the devil. After three or four months of  some sort of training in an institution maintained by the California  Society of Friends--a body more like the Salvation Army, one judges,  than the old Quakers--he volunteered for service at a branch which the  old-established mission of the Society at the mouth of the Kobuk desired  to plant two hundred miles or so up the river, and had come out and had  plunged at once into his task. So here he was, some six or seven months  installed, teacher, preacher, trader in a small way, and indefatigable  worker in general. Pedagogical training or knowledge of \"methods\" he had  none at all, but the root of the matter was in him, and surely never was  such an insatiable school-teacher. Morning, noon, and night he was  teaching. While he was cooking he was hearing lessons; while he was  washing the dishes and cleaning the house he was correcting exercises in  simple addition. In the schoolroom he was full of a genial enthusiasm  that seemed to impart instruction by sheer dynamic force. \"Boot,\" the  lesson book said. There was no boot in the schoolroom, all were shod in  mukluks. He dives into his dwelling-house attachment and comes back  holding up a boot. \"Boot,\" he says, and \"boot\" they all repeat.  Presently the word \"tooth\" was introduced in the lesson. Withdrawing a  loose artificial tooth of the \"pivot\" variety from his upper jaw, he  holds it aloft and \"tooth!\" he cries out, and \"toot!\" they all cry, and  he claps it back into his head again.    We were present on Sunday at the services. There was hearty singing of  \"Pentecostal\" hymns with catchy refrains, but we were compelled to  notice again what we had noticed amongst the little bands of these  people on the Koyukuk when we set them to singing, that the English was  unintelligible; and since it conveyed no meaning to us could have had  little for them. This is the inevitable result of ignoring the native  tongue and adopting the easy expedient of teaching the singing of hymns  and the recitation of formulas like the commandments in English. For a  generation or two, at least, the English learned, save by children at a  boarding-school, where nothing but English is spoken, is fragmentary and  of doubtful import in all except the commonest matters of speech. And at  such boarding-schools there is danger of the real misfortune and  drawback of natives growing up to live their lives amongst natives,  ignorant of the native tongue. There is no quick and easy way of  stamping out a language, thank God; there is no quick and easy way of  imparting instruction in a foreign language. By and by all the Alaskan  natives will be more or less bilingual, but the intimate speech and the  most clearly understood speech will still be the mother tongue. The  singing done, there was preaching through an interpreter, and then each  individual present \"gave testimony,\" which consisted for the most part  in the recitation of a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22976"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#15)"],[1,"  on an' owned a plantation in Northampton County. The plantation wus near  woodland. The nearest river to the place wus the Roanoke. My ole missus'  name wus Nancy. When ole marster died I stayed around wid fust one then  another of the chilluns, cause marster tole me jes' fore he died fer me  to stay wid any of 'em I wanted to stay with. All dem ole people done  dead an' gone on.    Niggers had to go through thick an' thin in slavery time, with rough  rations most of de time, wid jes' enough clothin' to make out wid. Our  houses were built of logs an' covered wid slabs. Dey wus rived out of  blocks of trees about 3-6 and 8ft in length. De chimleys wus built of  sticks and mud, den a coat of clay mud daubed over 'em. De cracks in de  slave houses wus daubed wid mud too.    We wurked from sun to sun. If we had a fire in cold weather where we  wus wurkin' marster or de overseer would come an' put it out. We et  frozen meat an' bread many times in cold weather. After de day's wurk in  de fields wus over we had a task of pickin' de seed from cotton till we  had two ounces of lint or spin two ounces of cotton on a spinnin' wheel.  I spun cotton on a spinnin' wheel. Dats de way people got clothes in  slavery time.    I can't read an' write but dey learned us to count. Dey learned us to  count dis way. 'Ought is an' ought, an' a figger is a figger, all for de  white man an' nothin' fer de nigger'. Hain't you heard people count dat  way?    Dey sold slaves jes' like people sell hosses now. I saw a lot of slaves  sold on de auction block. Dey would strip 'em stark naked. A nigger  scarred up or whaled an' welted up wus considered a bad nigger an' did  not bring much. If his body wus not scarred, he brought a good price. I  saw a lot of slaves whupped an' I was whupped myself. Dey whupped me wid  de cat o' nine tails. It had nine lashes on it. Some of de slaves wus  whupped wid a cabbin paddle. Dey had forty holes in' em an' when you wus  buckled to a barrel dey hit your naked flesh wid de paddle an' every  whur dere wus a hole in de paddle it drawed a blister. When de whuppin'  wid de paddle wus over, dey took de cat o' nine tails an' busted de  blisters. By dis time de blood sometimes would be runnin' down dere  heels. Den de next thing wus a wash in salt water strong enough to hold  up an egg. Slaves wus punished dat way fer runnin' away an' sich.    If you wus out widout a pass dey would shore git you. De paterollers  shore looked after you. Dey would come to de house at night to see who  wus there. If you wus out of place, dey would wear you out.    Sam Joyner, a slave, belonged to marster. He wus runnin' from de  paterollers an' he fell in a ole well. De pateroller went after marster.  Marster tole' em to git ole Sam out an' whup him jes' as much as dey  wanted to. Dey got him out of de well an' he wus all wet an' muddy. Sam  began takin' off his shoes, den he took off his pants an' got in his  shirt tail. Marster, he say, 'What you takin' off you clothes fer Sam?'  Sam, he say, 'Marster, you know you all can't whup dis nigger right over  all dese wet clothes.' Den Sam lit out. He run so fas' he nearly flew.  De paterollers got on dere hosses an' run him but dey could not ketch  him. He got away. Marster got Sam's clothes an' carried 'em to de house.  Sam slipped up next morning put his clothes on an' marster said no more  about it.    I wus a great big boy when de Yankees come through. I wus drivin' a two  mule team an' doin' other wurk on de farm. I drove a two hoss wagon when  dey carried slaves to market. I went to a lot of different places.    My marster wus a preacher, Billy Boone. He sold an' bought niggers. He  had fifty or more. He wurked the grown niggers in two squads. My father  wus named Isham Boone and my mother wus Sarah Boone. Marster Boone  whupped wid de cobbin paddle an' de cat o' nine tails an' used the salt  bath an' dat wus 'nough. Plenty besides him whupped dat way.    Marster had one son, named Solomon, an' two girls, Elsie an' Alice. My  mother had four children, three boys an' one girl. The boys were named  Sam, Walter and Andrew, dats me, an' de girl wus Cherry.    My father had several children cause he had several women besides  mother. Mollie and Lila Lassiter, two sisters, were also his women.  Dese women wus given to him an' no udder man wus allowed to have  anything to do wid 'em. Mollie an' Lila both had chilluns by him. Dere  names wus Jim, Mollie, Liza, Rosa, Pete an' I can't remember no more of  'em.    De Yankees took jes' what dey wanted an' nothin' stopped 'em, cause de  surrender had come. Before de surrender de slave owners begun to scatter  de slaves 'bout from place to place to keep de Yankees from gittin' 'em.  If de Yankees took a place de slaves nearby wus moved to a place further  off.    All I done wus fer de Rebels. I wus wid 'em an' I jes' done what I wus  tole. I wus afraid of de Yankees 'cause de Rebels had told us dat de  Yankees would kill us. Dey tole us dat de Yankees would bore holes in  our shoulders an' wurk us to carts. Dey tole us we would be treated a  lot worser den dey wus treating us. Well, de Yankees got here but they  treated us fine. Den a story went round an' round dat de marster would  have to give de slaves a mule an' a year's provisions an' some lan',  about forty acres, but dat was not so. Dey nebber did give us anything.  When de war ended an' we wus tole we wus free, we stayed on wid marster  cause we had nothin' an' nowhere to go.    We moved about from farm to farm. Mother died an' father married Maria  Edwards after de surrender. He did not live wid any of his other slave  wives dat I knows of.    I have wurked as a han' on de farm most of de time since de surrender  and daddy worked most of de time as a han', but he had gardens an'  patches most everywhere he wurked. I wurked in New York City for fifteen  years with Crawford and Banhay in de show business. I advertised for  'em. I dressed in a white suit, white shirt, an' white straw hat, and  wore tan shoes. I had to be a purty boy. I had to have my shoes shined  twice a day. I lived at 18 Manilla Lane, New York City. It is between  McDougall Street and 6th Avenue. I married Clara Taylor in New York  City. We had two children. The oldest one lives in New York. The other  died an' is buried in Raleigh.    In slavery time they kept you down an' you had to wurk, now I can't  wurk, an' I am still down. Not allowed to wurk an' still down. It's all  hard, slavery and freedom, both bad when you can't eat. The ole bees  makes de honey comb, the young bee makes de honey, niggers makes de  cotton an' corn an' de white folks gets de money. Dis wus de case in  Slavery time an' its de case now. De nigger do mos' de hard wurk on de  farms now, and de white folks still git de money dat de nigger's labor  makes.    LE          STATE EDITORIAL IDENTIFICATION FORM     [320002]    STATE:         North Carolina  RECEIVED FROM: (State office) Asheville  MS:            Interview with W. L. Bost, Ex-Slave.  WORDS:         2,000  DATE:          Sept. 27, 1937    Interview with W. L. Bost, Ex-slave [HW: 88 years]  63 Curve Street,  Asheville, N. C.    By--Marjorie Jones      My Massa's name was Jonas Bost. He had a hotel in Newton, North  Carolina. My mother and grandmother both belonged to the Bost family. My  ole Massa had two large plantations one about three miles from Newton  and another four miles away. It took a lot of niggers to keep the work a  goin' on them both. The women folks had to work in the hotel and in the  big house in town. Ole Missus she was a good woman. She never allowed  the Massa to buy or sell any slaves. There never was an overseer on the  whole plantation. The oldest colored man always looked after the  niggers. We niggers lived better than the niggers on the other  plantations.    Lord child, I remember when I was a little boy, 'bout ten years, the  speculators come through Newton with droves of slaves. They always stay  at our place. The poor critters nearly froze to death. They always come  'long on the last of December so that the niggers would be ready for  sale on the first day of January. Many the time I see four or five of  them chained together. They never had enough clothes on to keep a cat  warm. The women never wore anything but a thin dress and a petticoat and  one underwear. I've seen the ice balls hangin' on to the bottom of their  dresses as they ran along, jes like sheep in a pasture 'fore they are  sheared. They never wore any shoes. Jes run along on the ground, all  spewed up with ice. The speculators always rode on horses and drove the  pore niggers. When they get cold, they make 'em run 'til they are warm  again.    The speculators stayed in the hotel and put the niggers in the quarters  jes like droves of hogs. All through the night I could hear them  mournin' and prayin'. I didn't know the Lord would let people live who  were so cruel. The gates were always locked and they was a guard on the  outside to shoot anyone who tried to run away. Lord miss, them slaves  look jes like droves of turkeys runnin' along in front of them horses.    I remember when they put 'em on the block to sell 'em. The ones 'tween  18 and 30 always bring the most money. The auctioneer he stand off at a  distance and cry 'em off as they stand on the block. I can hear his  voice as long as I live.    If the one they going to sell was a young Negro man this is what he say:  \"Now gentlemen and fellow-citizens here is a big black buck Negro. He's  stout as a mule. Good for any kin' o' work an' he never gives any  trouble. How much am I offered for him?\" And then the sale would  commence, and the nigger would be sold to the highest bidder.    If they put up a young nigger woman the auctioneer cry out: \"Here's a  young nigger wench, how much am I offered for her?\" The pore thing  stand on the block a shiverin' an' a shakin' nearly froze to death. When  they sold many of the pore mothers"]]]
