To this we replied that we were quite aware of the dangers we should  have to encounter in our travels, but added that we had come there for  the very purpose of encountering such dangers, and especially to pay a  visit to the giant monkeys in their native land, so that it was in vain  his attempting to dissuade us, as we were resolved to go.    Seeing that we were immovable, the king eventually gave in, and ordered  some of his best men to hold themselves in readiness to start with us on  the following morning.  We then proceeded to his majesty's house, where  we had supper, and afterwards retired to our own hut to rest.    But we were destined to have little or no rest that night.  The doctor  or fetishman of the tribe had stirred up the passions of the people in a  manner that was quite incomprehensible to us.  King Jambai, it seems,  had been for some weeks suffering from illness--possibly from  indigestion, for he was fond of gorging himself--and the medicine-man  had stated that his majesty was bewitched by some of the members of his  own tribe, and that unless these sorcerers were slain there was no  possibility of his getting well.    We never could ascertain why the fetishman should fix upon certain  persons to be slain, unless it was that he had a personal enmity against  them; but this seemed unlikely, for two of the persons selected were old  female slaves, who could never, of course, have injured the doctor in  any way.  But the doings of Africans, especially in regard to religious  superstitions, I afterwards found were so mysterious that no one could  or would explain the meaning of them to us.  And I am inclined to  believe that in reference to the meaning of many things they were  themselves utterly ignorant.    Towards midnight the people had wrought themselves up to a frenzied  condition, and made so much noise that we could not sleep.  In the midst  of the uproar Makarooroo, who we observed had been very restless all the  evening, rushed into our hut, exclaiming, \"Massa! massa! come, save my  Okandaga! come quick!\"    The poor fellow was trembling with anxiety, and was actually pale in the  face; for a distinctly discernible pallor overspreads the countenance of  the negro when under the influence of excessive terror.    Okandaga we had previously heard of and seen.  She was, according to  African notions, an exceedingly pretty young girl, with whom our worthy  guide had fallen desperately in love.  Makarooroo's education had done  much for him, and especially in regard to females.  Having observed the  kind, respectful consideration with which the missionaries treated their  wives, and the happiness that seemed to be the result of that course of  conduct, he resolved in his own mind to try the experiment with one of  the girls of his own tribe, and soon after rejoining it paid his  attentions to Okandaga, who seemed to him the most modest and lovable  girl in the village.    Poor Okandaga was first amazed and then terrified at the strangely  gentle conduct of her lover, and thought that he meant to bewitch her;  for having never before been accustomed to other than harsh and  contemptuous treatment from men, she could not believe that Makarooroo  meant her any good.  Gradually, however, she began to like this  respectful wooer, and finally she agreed to elope with him to the  sea-coast and live near the missionaries.  It was necessary, however, to  arrange their plans with great caution.  There was no difficulty in  their getting married.  A handsome present to the girl's father was all  that was necessary to effect that end, and a good hunter like Makarooroo  knew he could speedily obtain possession of his bride, but to get her  removed from her tribe and carried to the coast was quite a different  affair.  While the perplexed negro was pondering this subject and  racking his brains to discover a way of getting over the difficulty, our  arrival at the village occurred.  At once he jumped to the conclusion  that somehow or other he should accomplish his object through our  assistance; and holding this in view, he the more willingly agreed to  accompany us to the gorilla country, intending first to make our  acquaintance, and afterwards to turn us to account in furthering his  plans.  All this we learned long afterwards.  At the period of which I  am now writing, we were profoundly ignorant of everything save the fact  that Okandaga was his affianced bride, and that the poor fellow was now  almost beside himself with horror because the fetishman had condemned  her, among others, to drink the poisoned cup.    This drinking of the poisoned cup is an ordeal through which the unhappy  victims to whom suspicion has been attached are compelled to pass.  Each  one drinks the poison, and several executioners stand by, with heavy  knives, to watch the result.  If the poison acts so as to cause the  supposed criminal to fall down, he is hacked in pieces instantly; but  if, through unusual strength or peculiarity of constitution, he is  enabled to resist the effects of the poison, his life is spared, and he  is declared innocent.    Jack and Peterkin and I seized our weapons, and hurrying out, followed  our guide to the spot where this terrible tragedy was enacting.    \"Don't fear, Mak,\" said Peterkin, as we ran along; \"we'll save her  somehow.  I'm certain of that.\"    The negro made no reply, but I observed a more hopeful expression on his  countenance after the remark.  He evidently had immense faith in  Peterkin; which I must say was more than I had, for when I considered  our small numbers, my hope of influencing savages was very slight.    The scene that met our eyes was indescribably horrible.  In the centre  of a dense circle of negroes, who had wrought themselves up to a pitch  of ferocity that caused them to look more like wild beasts than men,  stood the king, and beside him the doctor or fetishman.  This latter was  ornamented with a towering headdress of feathers.  His face was painted  white, which had the effect of imparting to him an infinitely more  hideous and ghastly aspect than is produced in the white man when he is  painted black.  A stripe of red passed round his head, and another down  his forehead and nose.  His naked body was decked with sundry fantastic  ornaments, and altogether he looked more like a fiend than I had  believed it possible for man to appear.    The ground all round him was saturated with blood and strewn with arms,  fingers, cleft skulls, and masses of flesh that had been hewn from the  victims who had already fallen, one of whom, we afterwards learned, had  belonged to the royal family.  Two still remained--a young female and an  old man.  The emaciated frame and white woolly head of the latter showed  that in the course of nature his earthly career must soon terminate.  It  is probable that the poor old man had become a burden to his relations,  and the doctor took this opportunity of ridding the tribe of him.  The  girl was Okandaga, who stood weeping and trembling as she gazed upon the  butchery that had already taken place.    The old man had swallowed the poison shortly before we arrived, and he  was now struggling to maintain an erect position.  But he failed, his  quivering limbs sank beneath him, and before we could interfere the  bloody executioners had cut off his head, and then, in a transport of  passion, they literally hacked his body to pieces.    We rushed hastily forward to the king, and Jack, in an earnest voice,  implored him to spare the last victim.    \"Surely,\" said he, \"enough have been sacrificed already.--Tell him,  Makarooroo, that I will quit his village and never see him more if he  does not spare the life of that young girl.\"    The king appeared much perplexed by this unlooked-for interference on  our part.    \"I cannot check the spirits of my people now,\" he replied.  \"They are  roused.  The girl has bewitched me and many others.  She must die.  It  is our custom.  Let not my white men be offended.  Let them go to their  hut and sleep.\"    \"We cannot sleep while injustice is done in the village,\" answered Jack,  in a lofty tone.  \"Let not King Jambai do that which will make his  visitors ashamed of him.  Let the girl live till to-morrow at midnight.  Let the case be investigated, and if she be proved guilty then let her  die.\"    The king commenced a long reply in the same dignified manner and tone  which Jack had assumed.  While he was thus engaged Peterkin touched our  guide on the shoulder and whispered--    \"I say, Mak, tell the doctor to back up Jack's request, and I'll give  him a gun.\"    The negro slipped at once to the side of the doctor, who had begun to  frown fiercely on Jack, and whispered a few words in his ear.  Instantly  his face assumed a calmer aspect, and presently he stepped up to the  king, and a whispering conversation ensued, in which the doctor,  carefully refraining from making any mention of the gun, commended the  wise advice of the white man, and suggested that the proposal should be  agreed to, adding, however, that he knew for certain that the girl was a  witch, but that the investigation would do good in the way of proving  that he, the doctor, was correct, and thus the girl should perish on the  following night, and the white men would be satisfied.    Having announced this to the multitude, the king ordered Okandaga to be  conducted back to her prison and carefully guarded; and we returned to  our hut--not, however, to sleep, but to consult as to what was to be  done next.    \"I knew that you wanted a respite for her,\" said Peterkin, as we sat  round our fire, \"that you might have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2176"],[0,"Seven Discourses on Art (#15)"],[1,"saying, bestow sometimes  upon others, and sometimes on themselves; and their imaginary dignity is  naturally heightened by a supercilious censure of the low, the barren,  the grovelling, the servile imitator.  It would be no wonder if a  student, frightened by these terrors and disgraceful epithets, with which  the poor imitators are so often loaded, should let fall his pencil in  mere despair, conscious how much he has been indebted to the labours of  others, how little, how very little of his art was born with him; and,  considering it as hopeless, to set about acquiring by the imitation of  any human master what he is taught to suppose is matter of inspiration  from heaven.    Some allowance must be made for what is said in the gaiety or ambition of  rhetoric.  We cannot suppose that any one can really mean to exclude all  imitation of others.  A position so wild would scarce deserve a serious  answer, for it is apparent, if we were forbid to make use of the  advantages which our predecessors afford us, the art would be always to  begin, and consequently remain always in its infant state; and it is a  common observation that no art was ever invented and carried to  perfection at the same time.    But to bring us entirely to reason and sobriety, let it be observed, that  a painter must not only be of necessity an imitator of the works of  nature, which alone is sufficient to dispel this phantom of inspiration,  but he must be as necessarily an imitator of the works of other painters.  This appears more humiliating, but it is equally true; and no man can be  an artist, whatever he may suppose, upon any other terms.    However, those who appear more moderate and reasonable allow that study  is to begin by imitation, but that we should no longer use the thoughts  of our predecessors when we are become able to think for ourselves.  They  hold that imitation is as hurtful to the more advanced student as it was  advantageous to the beginner.    For my own part, I confess I am not only very much disposed to lay down  the absolute necessity of imitation in the first stages of the art, but  am of opinion that the study of other masters, which I here call  imitation, may be extended throughout our whole life without any danger  of the inconveniences with which it is charged, of enfeebling the mind,  or preventing us from giving that original air which every work  undoubtedly ought always to have.    I am, on the contrary, persuaded that by imitation only, variety, and  even originality of invention is produced.    I will go further; even genius, at least what generally is so called, is  the child of imitation.  But as this appears to be contrary to the  general opinion, I must explain my position before I enforce it.    Genius is supposed to be a power of producing excellences which are out  of the reach of the rules of art--a power which no precepts can teach,  and which no industry can acquire.    This opinion of the impossibility of acquiring those beauties which stamp  the work with the character of genius, supposes that it is something more  fixed than in reality it is, and that we always do, and ever did agree,  about what should be considered as a characteristic of genius.    But the truth is that the degree of excellence which proclaims genius is  different in different times and different places; and what shows it to  be so is that mankind have often changed their opinion upon this matter.    When the arts were in their infancy, the power of merely drawing the  likeness of any object was considered as one of its greatest efforts.    The common people, ignorant of the principles of art, talk the same  language even to this day.  But when it was found that every man could be  taught to do this, and a great deal more, merely by the observance of  certain precepts, the name of genius then shifted its application, and  was given only to those who added the peculiar character of the object  they represented; to those who had invention, expression, grace, or  dignity; or, in short, such qualities or excellences the producing of  which could not then be taught by any known and promulgated rules.    We are very sure that the beauty of form, the expression of the passions,  the art of composition, even the power of giving a general air of  grandeur to your work, is at present very much under the dominion of  rules.  These excellences were, heretofore, considered merely as the  effects of genius; and justly, if genius is not taken for inspiration,  but as the effect of close observation and experience.    He who first made any of these observations and digested them, so as to  form an invariable principle for himself to work by, had that merit; but  probably no one went very far at once; and generally the first who gave  the hint did not know how to pursue it steadily and methodically, at  least not in the beginning.  He himself worked on it, and improved it;  others worked more, and improved farther, until the secret was  discovered, and the practice made as general as refined practice can be  made.  How many more principles may be fixed and ascertained we cannot  tell; but as criticism is likely to go hand in hand with the art which is  its subject, we may venture to say that as that art shall advance, its  powers will be still more and more fixed by rules.    But by whatever strides criticism may gain ground, we need be under no  apprehension that invention will ever be annihilated or subdued, or  intellectual energy be brought entirely within the restraint of written  law.  Genius will still have room enough to expatiate, and keep always  the same distance from narrow comprehension and mechanical performance.    What we now call genius begins, not where rules, abstractedly taken, end,  but where known vulgar and trite rules have no longer any place.  It must  of necessity be that even works of genius, as well as every other effect,  as it must have its cause, must likewise have its rules; it cannot be by  chance that excellences are produced with any constancy, or any  certainty, for this is not the nature of chance, but the rules by which  men of extraordinary parts, and such as are called men of genius work,  are either such as they discover by their own peculiar observation, or of  such a nice texture as not easily to admit handling or expressing in  words, especially as artists are not very frequently skilful in that mode  of communicating ideas.    Unsubstantial, however, as these rules may seem, and difficult as it may  be to convey them in writing, they are still seen and felt in the mind of  the artist, and he works from them with as much certainty as if they were  embodied, as I may say, upon paper.  It is true these refined principles  cannot be always made palpable, like the more gross rules of art; yet it  does not follow but that the mind may be put in such a train that it  shall perceive, by a kind of scientific sense, that propriety which  words, particularly words of unpractised writers such as we are, can but  very feebly suggest.    Invention is one of the great marks of genius, but if we consult  experience, we shall find that it is by being conversant with the  inventions of others that we learn to invent, as by reading the thoughts  of others we learn to think.    Whoever has so far formed his taste as to be able to relish and feel the  beauties of the great masters has gone a great way in his study; for,  merely from a consciousness of this relish of the right, the mind swells  with an inward pride, and is almost as powerfully affected as if it had  itself produced what it admires.  Our hearts frequently warmed in this  manner by the contact of those whom we wish to resemble, will undoubtedly  catch something of their way of thinking, and we shall receive in our own  bosoms some radiation at least of their fire and splendour.  That  disposition, which is so strong in children, still continues with us, of  catching involuntarily the general air and manner of those with whom we  are most conversant; with this difference only, that a young mind is  naturally pliable and imitative, but in a more advanced state it grows  rigid, and must be warmed and softened before it will receive a deep  impression.    From these considerations, which a little of your reflection will carry a  great way further, it appears of what great consequence it is that our  minds should be habituated to the contemplation of excellence, and that,  far from being contented to make such habits the discipline of our youth  only, we should, to the last moment of our lives, continue a settled  intercourse with all the true examples of grandeur.  Their inventions are  not only the food of our infancy, but the substance which supplies the  fullest maturity of our vigour.    The mind is but a barren soil; is a soil soon exhausted, and will produce  no crop, or only one, unless it be continually fertilised and enriched  with foreign matter.    When we have had continually before us the great works of art to  impregnate our minds with kindred ideas, we are then, and not till then,  fit to produce something, of the same species.  We behold all about us  with the eyes of these penetrating observers, and our minds, accustomed  to think the thoughts of the noblest and brightest intellects, are  prepared for the discovery and selection of all that is great and noble  in nature.  The greatest natural genius cannot subsist on its own stock:  he who resolves never to ransack any mind but his own will be soon  reduced, from mere barrenness, to the poorest of all imitations; he will  be obliged to imitate himself, and to repeat what he has before often  repeated.  When we know the subject designed by such men, it will never  be difficult to guess what kind of work is to be produced.    It is vain for painters or poets to endeavour to invent without materials  on which the mind may work, and from which invention must originate.  Nothing can "]]]
