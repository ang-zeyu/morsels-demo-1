Altogether it is one of the most beautiful Cathedrals I have ever seen,  more particularly in its external architecture.    Opposite, and but a few yards distant, is the Baptistery, but,  unfortunately, we were too late to obtain admittance. It is a beautiful,  circular structure some 160 feet in diameter, surrounded by columns  below, and a gallery of smaller detached columns above, covered with a  conical dome 190 feet high. The building was commenced in 1153, but was  not finally completed until 1278. It is famous for its wonderful echo.    The Campanile, or, as it is usually styled, the \"Leaning Tower,\" is on  the other side of the Cathedral. It is 188 feet high, 53 feet round the  base, and about 14 feet out of the perpendicular. It is now, I believe,  generally understood that this obliquity was occasioned by the imperfect  state of the foundations and the sinking of the soil, which is light and  sandy, and which caused it to settle down on one side while the building  was still uncompleted; and this defect was afterwards provided for by  its architect. This is evident from the staircase, of some 294 steps,  being also at an angle. There are some very heavy bells on the topmost  towers, to counterbalance the deviation. It is supposed to have been  constructed about 1174, by William of Innsprueck, and afterwards finished  by Italians, but it was not finally completed until 1350. It rises in  storeys, which, like the Baptistery, are surrounded by half columns and  six colonnades.    It is said that Galileo, who was born at Pisa, took advantage of the  peculiarity of the leaning tower to make his experiments regarding the  laws of gravitation; and there is in the Cathedral a great silver  chandelier suspended after his design--by a simple rod--from the great  height of the roof. This was so mathematically correct that the  celebrated astronomer took his idea of the pendulum from it. There is a  very fine view from the top of the tower, well repaying the trouble of  ascending. We were very pleased with the old \"leaning tower of Pisa,\" so  familiar in our childhood as \"one of the eight wonders of the world,\"  and were not in the least degree disappointed, but rather wondered at  its height and circumference. It seems perilous to have erected other  buildings in its proximity, yet there are several handsome houses in its  immediate vicinity, affording, perhaps, additional grounds for the  theory of its accidental settlement.    The Campo Santo, or burial-ground, was the next place we visited,  accompanied by the custodian. It is not so beautiful in statuary as that  of Genoa, but from its great antiquity is even more interesting. It is a  long parallelogram 430 feet in length, with a covered cloister running  all round; the central part supported by beautiful pilasters adorned  with painting and frescoes, chiefly by Giotto, Orgagna, and Memmi, some  of them almost obliterated. There is a very ancient and interesting  collection of Roman, Etruscan, and Mediaeval sculpture and sarcophagi,  important links in the history of early Italian sculpture. The pavement  is formed by the tombstones of those who have been interred here.  Through the round and beautifully traced arched windows you look out on  the original burial-ground in the centre, which is open to the sky, and,  tradition says, is filled in with some fifty-three ship-loads of earth  brought from Mount Calvary in the twelfth century (after the loss of the  Holy Land), by the Archbishop of that time, so that the dead might  repose in holy ground. I have heard that this Campo Santo is very  impressive when viewed by moonlight, which can be done by arranging with  the custodian at suitable times.    One other memento of past naval glory that we saw, was the great chain  across the more ancient part of Pisa. This was carried away by the  Genoese as a trophy, after their conquest of the city, but was  afterwards generously returned.    One of the pleasures of travelling not to be overlooked is that of  retrospection: picture after picture and memory after memory rises to  the mind, and one could go on for ever rebuilding in fancy all that has  pleased and interested. With all my heart I can echo Dickens' words--\"I  find it difficult to separate my own delight in recalling, from your  weariness in having them recalled.\"           *       *       *       *       *    We took train to Leghorn, to procure our letters from the post-restante  there. The weather was so unpleasantly wet that, under the  circumstances, we did not find the place very interesting. Leigh Hunt  sums up _his_ impressions in a few exceedingly apt, albeit somewhat  unkind, words: \"Leghorn is a polite Wapping, with a square and a  theatre.\" The grave of Smollett, who lived here for some time, is one of  the objects of interest to visitors from the British Isles. There is  always a degree of melancholy pleasure in coming across the last  resting-place of a distinguished countryman in a foreign land.    While at the post-restante, we experienced a singular example of the  persistency and malevolence of the typical Italian beggar. This time it  was a woman and her child, both extremely dirty, the latter evidently  alive with vermin. The woman, on my wife's refusing to give her  anything, deliberately told her poor neglected child to rub up against  her--in order, no doubt, to communicate some of her infirmity. To  relieve only a portion of the beggars of all kinds who pursue you  wherever you go in Italy, although this pest has been greatly reduced of  late years, would leave you with very little time or money.    On returning, we had a fine view of Pisa. In the distance it appears  like a city of white marble, with its tower leaning at one end, and the  blue mountains far away in the background, looking, however, much nearer  than is actually the case. Distance is almost annihilated in this clear,  dry, Italian atmosphere, which also to a great extent prevents decay,  the most ancient buildings looking often singularly fresh. \"Antiquity  refuses to look ancient in Italy; it insists on retaining its youthful  aspect.\"    The _Torre del Fame_, or \"Tower of Famine,\" where Ugolino and his sons  were starved to death, stood \"a littel out\" of Pisa, as old Chaucer has  it, but the very site of this monument of cruel tyranny and vengeance is  now lost, or at any rate apocryphal.    We were really glad to reach the Hotel Victoria once more, our journey  having been performed in the presently falling rain. There is much of  interest in this old city, but our time was limited, and we were  compelled to press on towards the south, and therefore left on the  evening of the second day for Rome, the weather clearing up just about  the time of our departure.    The Pisans have a significant motto:        \"Pisa pensa a chi posa.\"      (Pisa sits ill      On those who sit still.)    We did not, however, stay long enough in the town to experience the  truth of the aphorism.                                       CHAPTER IX.    Arrival in Rome--Hotel de la Ville--The Corso--The Strangers' Quarter--  Roman Guides--View from the Capitol--\"How are the Mighty fallen!\"--The  sculpture-gallery of the Capitol--The Dying Gladiator--The Venus--  Hawthorne's Marble Faun--Bambino Santissimo--The Mamertine Prison--The  Forum--Palaces--The Coliseum--Longfellow's \"Michael Angelo.\"      Travelling by the slow second-class train, we did not arrive at Rome  until nearly 11 p.m.; yet the journey proved interesting, especially as  we approached our destination. The stillness of night increased the  impressive awe that inspired us as we neared the \"Eternal City.\" It was  not only cold and dark, but foggy; and we could see very little;  conjecture, however, was busy as we caught, through an occasional gleam  of light, the shadows of outlying monuments and ruins. As we crossed the  silent-rolling Tiber, and the reverberations of the railway bridge smote  on our ears with a hollow, sepulchral sound, we felt, almost with a  shiver, that we were entering a city of the dead.    The fog was extremely cold and penetrating, striking one almost like the  malaria, and we were glad to get to the well-lighted station, and mingle  with the cheerful animated crowd on the platform, and did not even feel  the intrusive hotel omnibus-conductors a nuisance, but gladly consigned  ourselves to the guidance of one, and drove away. However, we soon found  that Rome was _Imperial_ in her charges. The first hotel wanted from ten  to twelve francs for a bedroom per night, the second likewise.  Ultimately we were safely housed about midnight in the Hotel de la  Ville, in the Piazza del Popolo, at the head of the Corso. Though  perhaps a little out of the way, and less conveniently situated than the  more central hotels in the Piazza di Spagna, it has many advantages in  comfort, is quiet and moderate in charge, and close to the English  church.    This Hotel de la Ville was once the palace and museum of the Marquis  Campana. It is surrounded by so-called \"English gardens,\" beautifully  decorated with columns, statues, fountains, and orange trees full of  golden fruit.    The next morning, on rising, we felt the dream of many years was at last  realized!    \"Thou art truly a world, O Rome!\" says Goethe; and we indeed felt it so,  as, having breakfasted, we sallied forth, eager to begin our  explorations. Our first visit was naturally to the English bookseller's,  where we purchased a guide-book. A plan of Rome may always be obtained  at one's hotel, and it is well to study the streets, etc., and arrange  one's campaign of sight-seeing. A good way is to begin by visiting the  nearest objects of interest, which can be accomplished on foot; then to  make use of the omnibus; and finally, of the carriages, for more distant  places outside the walls.

The wind rose instantly, blew out  The fire of the nocturnal lights;  A trouble fell upon the sprites;  Oneguine lightning glances shot;  Furious he from the table rose;  All arise. To the door he goes.    XIX    Terror assails her. Hastily  Tattiana would attempt to fly,  She cannot--then impatiently  She strains her throat to force a cry--  She cannot--Eugene oped the door  And the young girl appeared before  Those hellish phantoms. Peals arise  Of frantic laughter, and all eyes  And hoofs and crooked snouts and paws,  Tails which a bushy tuft adorns,  Whiskers and bloody tongues and horns,  Sharp rows of tushes, bony claws,  Are turned upon her. All combine  In one great shout: she's mine! she's mine!    XX    \"Mine!\" cried Eugene with savage tone.  The troop of apparitions fled,  And in the frosty night alone  Remained with him the youthful maid.  With tranquil air Oneguine leads  Tattiana to a corner, bids  Her on a shaky bench sit down;  His head sinks slowly, rests upon  Her shoulder--Olga swiftly came--  And Lenski followed--a light broke--  His fist Oneguine fiercely shook  And gazed around with eyes of flame;  The unbidden guests he roughly chides--  Tattiana motionless abides.    XXI    The strife grew furious and Eugene  Grasped a long knife and instantly  Struck Lenski dead--across the scene  Dark shadows thicken--a dread cry  Was uttered, and the cabin shook--  Tattiana terrified awoke.  She gazed around her--it was day.  Lo! through the frozen windows play  Aurora's ruddy rays of light--  The door flew open--Olga came,  More blooming than the Boreal flame  And swifter than the swallow's flight.  \"Come,\" she cried, \"sister, tell me e'en  Whom you in slumber may have seen.\"    XXII    But she, her sister never heeding,  With book in hand reclined in bed,  Page after page continued reading,  But no reply unto her made.  Although her book did not contain  The bard's enthusiastic strain,  Nor precepts sage nor pictures e'en,  Yet neither Virgil nor Racine  Nor Byron, Walter Scott, nor Seneca,  Nor the _Journal des Modes_, I vouch,  Ever absorbed a maid so much:  Its name, my friends, was Martin Zadeka,  The chief of the Chaldean wise,  Who dreams expound and prophecies.    XXIII    Brought by a pedlar vagabond  Unto their solitude one day,  This monument of thought profound  Tattiana purchased with a stray  Tome of \"Malvina,\" and but three(56)  And a half rubles down gave she;  Also, to equalise the scales,  She got a book of nursery tales,  A grammar, likewise Petriads two,  Marmontel also, tome the third;  Tattiana every day conferred  With Martin Zadeka. In woe  She consolation thence obtained--  Inseparable they remained.    [Note 56: \"Malvina,\" a romance by Madame Cottin.]    XXIV    The dream left terror in its train.  Not knowing its interpretation,  Tania the meaning would obtain  Of such a dread hallucination.  Tattiana to the index flies  And alphabetically tries  The words _bear, bridge, fir, darkness, bog,  Raven, snowstorm, tempest, fog,  Et cetera_; but nothing showed  Her Martin Zadeka in aid,  Though the foul vision promise made  Of a most mournful episode,  And many a day thereafter laid  A load of care upon the maid.    XXV    \"But lo! forth from the valleys dun  With purple hand Aurora leads,  Swift following in her wake, the sun,\"(57)  And a grand festival proceeds.  The Larinas were since sunrise  O'erwhelmed with guests; by families  The neighbours come, in sledge approach,  Britzka, kibitka, or in coach.  Crush and confusion in the hall,  Latest arrivals' salutations,  Barking, young ladies' osculations,  Shouts, laughter, jamming 'gainst the wall,  Bows and the scrape of many feet,  Nurses who scream and babes who bleat.    [Note 57: The above three lines are a parody on the turgid  style of Lomonossoff, a literary man of the second Catherine's  era.]    XXVI    Bringing his partner corpulent  Fat Poustiakoff drove to the door;  Gvozdine, a landlord excellent,  Oppressor of the wretched poor;  And the Skatenines, aged pair,  With all their progeny were there,  Who from two years to thirty tell;  Petoushkoff, the provincial swell;  Bouyanoff too, my cousin, wore(58)  His wadded coat and cap with peak  (Surely you know him as I speak);  And Flianoff, pensioned councillor,  Rogue and extortioner of yore,  Now buffoon, glutton, and a bore.    [Note 58: Pushkin calls Bouyanoff his cousin because he is a  character in the \"Dangerous Neighbour,\" a poem by Vassili  Pushkin, the poet's uncle.]    XXVII    The family of Kharlikoff,  Came with Monsieur Triquet, a prig,  Who arrived lately from Tamboff,  In spectacles and chestnut wig.  Like a true Frenchman, couplets wrought  In Tania's praise in pouch he brought,  Known unto children perfectly:  _Reveillez-vouz, belle endormie_.  Among some ancient ballads thrust,  He found them in an almanac,  And the sagacious Triquet back  To light had brought them from their dust,  Whilst he \"belle Nina\" had the face  By \"belle Tattiana\" to replace.    XXVIII    Lo! from the nearest barrack came,  Of old maids the divinity,  And comfort of each country dame,  The captain of a company.  He enters. Ah! good news to-day!  The military band will play.  The colonel sent it. Oh! delight!  So there will be a dance to-night.  Girls in anticipation skip!  But dinner-time comes. Two and two  They hand in hand to table go.  The maids beside Tattiana keep--  Men opposite. The cross they sign  And chattering loud sit down to dine.    XXIX    Ceased for a space all chattering.  Jaws are at work. On every side  Plates, knives and forks are clattering  And ringing wine-glasses are plied.  But by degrees the crowd begin  To raise a clamour and a din:  They laugh, they argue, and they bawl,  They shout and no one lists at all.  The doors swing open: Lenski makes  His entrance with Oneguine. \"Ah!  At last the author!\" cries Mamma.  The guests make room; aside each takes  His chair, plate, knife and fork in haste;  The friends are called and quickly placed.    XXX    Right opposite Tattiana placed,  She, than the morning moon more pale,  More timid than a doe long chased,  Lifts not her eyes which swimming fail.  Anew the flames of passion start  Within her; she is sick at heart;  The two friends' compliments she hears  Not, and a flood of bitter tears  With effort she restrains. Well nigh  The poor girl fell into a faint,  But strength of mind and self-restraint  Prevailed at last. She in reply  Said something in an undertone  And at the table sat her down.    XXXI    To tragedy, the fainting fit,  And female tears hysterical,  Oneguine could not now submit,  For long he had endured them all.  Our misanthrope was full of ire,  At a great feast against desire,  And marking Tania's agitation,  Cast down his eyes in trepidation  And sulked in silent indignation;  Swearing how Lenski he would rile,  Avenge himself in proper style.  Triumphant by anticipation,  Caricatures he now designed  Of all the guests within his mind.    XXXII    Certainly not Eugene alone  Tattiana's trouble might have spied,  But that the eyes of every one  By a rich pie were occupied--  Unhappily too salt by far;  And that a bottle sealed with tar  Appeared, Don's effervescing boast,(59)  Between the blanc-mange and the roast;  Behind, of glasses an array,  Tall, slender, like thy form designed,  Zizi, thou mirror of my mind,  Fair object of my guileless lay,  Seductive cup of love, whose flow  Made me so tipsy long ago!    [Note 59: The _Donskoe Champanskoe_ is a species of sparkling wine  manufactured in the vicinity of the river Don.]    XXXIII    From the moist cork the bottle freed  With loud explosion, the bright wine  Hissed forth. With serious air indeed,  Long tortured by his lay divine,  Triquet arose, and for the bard  The company deep silence guard.  Tania well nigh expired when he  Turned to her and discordantly  Intoned it, manuscript in hand.  Voices and hands applaud, and she  Must bow in common courtesy;  The poet, modest though so grand,  Drank to her health in the first place,  Then handed her the song with grace.    XXXIV    Congratulations, toasts resound,  Tattiana thanks to all returned,  But, when Oneguine's turn came round,  The maiden's weary eye which yearned,  Her agitation and distress  Aroused in him some tenderness.  He bowed to her nor silence broke,  But somehow there shone in his look  The witching light of sympathy;  I know not if his heart felt pain  Or if he meant to flirt again,  From habit or maliciously,  But kindness from his eye had beamed  And to revive Tattiana seemed.    XXXV    The chairs are thrust back with a roar,  The crowd unto the drawing-room speeds,  As bees who leave their dainty store  And seek in buzzing swarms the meads.  Contented and with victuals stored,  Neighbour by neighbour sat and snored,  Matrons unto the fireplace go,  Maids in the corner whisper low;  Behold! green tables are brought forth,  And testy gamesters do engage  In boston and the game of age,  Ombre, and whist all others worth:  A strong resemblance these possess--  All sons of mental weariness.    XXXVI    Eight rubbers were already played,  Eight times the heroes of the fight  Change of position had essayed,  When tea was brought. 'Tis my delight  Time to denote by dinner, tea,  And supper. In the country we  Can count the time without much fuss--  The stomach doth admonish us.  And, by the way, I here assert  That for that matter in my verse  As many dinners I rehearse,  As oft to meat and drink advert,  As thou, great Homer, didst of yore,  Whom thirty centuries adore.    XXXVII    I will with thy divinity  Contend with knife and fork and platter,  But grant with magnanimity  I'm beaten in another matter;  Thy heroes, sanguinary wights,  Also thy rough-and-tumble fights,  Thy Venus and thy Jupiter,  More advantageously appear  Than cold Oneguine's oddities,  The aspect of a landscape drear.
