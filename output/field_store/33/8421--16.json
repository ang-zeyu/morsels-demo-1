Accordingly during cold  weather the shutters in the old factories had to be closed and the  newly tanned hides piled on the floor and covered with heavy canvas. Of  course the leather rolled badly, but since it was possible to dampen and  stretch it into shape this difficulty could be overcome.    In the finishing department where the two lads were next sent many more  new features swelled their increasing fund of information. Wherever they  went they left a train of friends behind them. Peter seemed to be the  general property of the tanneries. The men quarreled good-naturedly over  which factory could really claim the Little Giant. To all this chaff  Peter returned modest replies and the odd little chuckle that had  so endeared him to his schoolmates. Nobody could imitate that  chuckle--nobody--although many of them tried. It was a part of Peter  himself, a part of the good will he felt toward the world and everybody  in it.    \"You can't hear it without your heart warming toward the lad,\" remarked  Carmachel one day.    Armed with this simple weapon Peter went on his way. He met the men  about him with a frank expectation that they would like him, and they  did. Nat also made friends, but as he was a much quieter boy most of  those who sought him out did so because he shone with a glory reflected  from Peter. Was he not Strong's chum? He must somehow be worth knowing  if he had that honor.    This rough kindliness of the workmen robbed labor of much of its  hardship. The two lads pushed eagerly ahead and were delighted when,  toward spring, they were again promoted--this time to the department  which turned out the tooled and embossed leathers.    This was one of the most fascinating phases of leather making and for a  long time it had interested both Peter and Nat. It seemed too good to be  true that they should now win positions in that factory.    \"It's like the stories of the Arabian Nights, the way we've gone on and  all the time kept together, Peter,\" Nat said one day. \"Think of it! We  have been given more money and better jobs all the time. I do not just  see why, either. Lots of the men who started long ago in the beamhouse  of Factory 1 are still there and haven't had a cent added to their pay  envelope; and look at us! It's just luck--that's what it is.\"    \"Not entirely luck, Nat,\" objected Peter, shaking his head. \"Some of it,  to be sure, is sheer good fortune; but some of it is hard work. If we  had not made good every step of the way I doubt if we should have been  sent on up the ladder.\"    \"I wonder!\" was Nat's thoughtful answer. \"Do you know, Pete, I've  sometimes thought that perhaps Mr. Coddington was keeping an eye on us  and giving orders that we be shoved along. He could do it, I suppose, if  he wanted to.\"    \"I suppose he could,\" agreed Peter, uneasily, \"but he is pretty busy,  and is it likely----\"    \"No, of course it isn't. He did a lot for me when I was sick and it  isn't reasonable to think he would do anything more. He wouldn't be  called upon to. It is just that we are under a lucky star.\"    \"I wish the star was a lucky enough one to send you a motorcycle then,  Nat,\" laughed Peter. \"You know this going off riding by myself is no  sort of a stunt. I don't have any fun at all. Why, I would rather tramp  the country on my two feet with you than to ride all over it without  you. Somehow you've got to get a motorcycle, Nat--you've simply got to.\"    \"And just how do you expect me to carry out such a crazy scheme?\" was  the derisive retort. \"Maybe you've a plan to suggest whereby, entirely  without a cent, I am to purchase a toy like that. It can't be done  without Aladdin's lamp--at least I can't do it any other way. A  motorcycle indeed! Why, I have not a cent to spend for such a thing. I  couldn't even buy one of the pedals, let alone anything more. Forget it,  Peter, and let's talk sense.\"    \"I shan't forget it,\" Peter answered earnestly. \"You are going to have a  motorcycle if I have to--to--pawn my rubber boots to get you one.\"    They both laughed.    Peter was in great spirits.    This was their first day in the new factory and as the boys took up the  novel task of learning how to make embossed leathers he made the inward  resolve that every penny he earned there should be put into the bank  toward a motorcycle for Nat.    The embossing department was indeed a wonderful place. Such magic as was  wrought here! Pieces of dyed leather of every imaginable hue were put  into great machines where heavy squares of copper, set in powerful  presses, stamped upon them various patterns or impressions. The designs  engraved on the dies were imitations of the texture of every known sort  of fancy leather. There was alligator, lizard skin, pigskin, snakeskin  and sealskin; even grained leather was copied. So perfect was the  likeness that it seemed impossible to tell the embossed and artificially  made material from the real.    \"How is any one to know whether his card-case is real seal or not?\"  queried Peter, aghast at the perfection of the dies.    The foreman shrugged his shoulders.    \"I guess you'd have some trouble,\" said he. \"Comfort yourself, though,  that you are not the only one. Just this fall Mr. Coddington himself  came in here to compare our leather with some pieces of seal he had had  sent him. He put his samples down on the table and later on when he went  to get them he could not tell for the life of him which they were. We  had a great laugh about it, I can tell you. Yes, we do pretty good work  here, and we have about all the orders for pocketbook and bag leather  that we can fill. At present we are so busy that we are running all the  dies, and that is why we need extra men.\"    Peter and Nat found that the department was indeed busy. All day they  were upon their feet feeding pieces of leather into the presses, and it  was their fatigue--a fact unimportant in itself--which led to a  remarkable chain of events in the Coddington tanneries.    It happened that one morning Peter was sent up to the shipping room on  the sixth floor of the factory with a bale of finished leather, and when  he was ready to return he found that the elevator which he had used in  coming up was out of order, and that he must now walk down the many  flights of stairs. Accordingly he started, whistling as he went. When he  reached the fifth floor he was much surprised to discover that it was  vacant. A great expanse it was, flooded with sunshine. Peter paused to  look about. Some unused packing-cases littered one corner of the room  and instantly the thought flashed into his mind--what a warm, quiet,  secluded spot for him and Nat to eat their lunch! Why, they could even  bring a book and curl up in the shelter of the boxes and read. As it was  still too chilly to go out there was no way, during the winter months,  but to huddle somewhere under the machinery of the factory and eat one's  lunch. Peter detested the arrangement, unavoidable as it was, and always  rejoiced when the noon hour was over.    But here was an escape from such disagreeable conditions. Here was an  unused room! Why should it not become a refuge from the noise, the dirt,  and the turmoil of the factory? The plan seemed innocent enough, and  when Peter confided it to Nat neither of them could see the slightest  objection to it. In consequence, at noon time they crept up-stairs, and  arranged a cozy little corner for themselves behind the packing-cases.  It was almost as good as playing Robinson Crusoe, this building a  fortress and hiding inside it. Then, too, the constant chance of being  discovered provided just the necessary tremor of excitement to make it  interesting. What fun it was! They called their stronghold Sterling  Castle, and many a joke and jibe they made concerning it--jokes at which  they laughed heartily when they were by themselves.    The vast empty space, they learned by cautious questioning, had  originally been intended as a supply room; it was found, however, that  it was not needed for this purpose and therefore it had been left in its  present unoccupied condition.    There seemed not an iota of possibility that the place would ever be  used and Peter and Nat exulted in the fact that they might lunch there  undisturbed for the rest of their days if they so desired. For weeks  they spent every noon hour in the sunshine behind their barricade  talking softly together, eating their luncheon, and sometimes reading  aloud.    Then came calamity.    It was on a sharp April day when the shelter of their sunny corner was  especially welcome. Peter had just been rolling out one of the most  stirring chapters of \"Ivanhoe\" when suddenly he paused, listening  intently.    \"It's the elevator!\" he whispered. \"It is stopping at this floor.  Somebody is getting out, Nat.\"    \"Who can it be?\"    \"Hush!\"    The two boys kept very still.    Steps and voices came nearer.    \"Yes, every floor is protected by fire-escapes, as you see,\" declared a  voice.    \"It is some insurance man,\" breathed Peter. \"Don't move, Nat.\"    \"Have you hand extinguishers here also?\"    \"Yes, at each corner of the room and on the walls.\"    \"This floor is not in use, I take it.\"    \"No,\" broke in another voice--the voice of Mr. Coddington himself. \"We  never have had occasion to use this floor, although we probably shall do  so when we require more room for supplies. What are those packing-cases  doing here, Tyler? They look as though they were empty.\"    \"I hardly think empty cases would be left on this floor, sir. They  shouldn't be.\"    Mr. Tyler was evidently annoyed.    \"Empty or full, they've no business in this room,\" said Mr. Coddington,  sharply. \"They might cause fire.\"    Simultaneously the three men stepped forward to investigate.    Mr. Tyler kicked the back of the nearest case with his foot, but Mr.  Coddington, who never stopped until he had got at the bottom of things,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25828"],[0,"History of Australia and New Zealand (#15)"],[1,"danger. Batman's party clothed  him and treated him well, and for a time he acted as interpreter,  smoothing over many of the difficulties that arose with the natives, and  rendering the formation of the settlement much less difficult than it  might have been.      #9. Excitement in Tasmania.#--The news taken over by Batman caused a  commotion in Tasmania. Many settlers crossed in search of the new  country, and, before a year had passed, nearly two hundred persons, with  more than 15,000 sheep, had landed on the shores of Port Phillip. But  they soon spread over a great extent of country--from Geelong to  Sunbury. They were in the midst of numerous black tribes, who now, too  late, began to perceive the nature of Batman's visit, and commenced to  seek revenge. Frequent attacks were made, in one of which a squatter and  his servant were killed beside the Werribee. Their bodies lie buried in  the Flagstaff Gardens.      #10. Governor Bourke.#--These were not the only troubles of the settlers;  for the Sydney Government declared that all purchases of land from  ignorant natives were invalid, and Governor Bourke issued a  proclamation, warning the people at Port Phillip against fixing their  homes there, as the land did not legally belong to them.    Still new settlers flocked over, and a township began to be formed on  the banks of the Yarra. Batman's association found that their claims to  the land granted them by the natives would not be allowed; and, after  some correspondence on the subject with the Home Government, they had  to be content with 28,000 acres, as compensation for the money they had  expended.      #11. Lonsdale.#--Towards the close of 1836 Governor Bourke found himself  compelled to recognise the new settlement, and sent Captain Lonsdale to  act as a magistrate; thirty soldiers accompanied him to maintain order  and protect the settlers. Next year (1837) the Governor himself arrived  at Port Phillip, where he found the settlers now numbering 500. He  planned out the little town, giving names to its streets, and finally  settling that it should be called Melbourne, after Lord Melbourne, who  was then the Prime Minister of England.      #12. Latrobe.#--in 1838 Geelong began to grow into a township, and the  settlers spread west as far as Colac. Next year Mr. Latrobe was sent to  take charge of the whole district of Port Phillip, under the title of  Superintendent, but with almost all the powers of a Governor. The  settlers held a public meeting, in an auction-room at Market Square, for  the purpose of according a hearty welcome to their new Governor, whose  kindliness and upright conduct soon made him a great favourite.    [Illustration: GOVERNOR LATROBE.]    A wattle-and-daub building was put up as a police-office, on the site of  the Western Markets, where it did duty for some time, until one night it  fell; some say because it was undermined by a party of imprisoned  natives; but others, because a bull belonging to Mr. Batman had rushed  against it. A court-house was erected, and four policemen appointed. A  post-office next followed, and, one by one, the various institutions of  a civilised community arose in miniature form. Numerous ships began to  enter the bay, and a lucrative trade sprang up with Tasmania. In 1838  the first newspaper appeared. It was due to the enterprise of Fawkner.  Every Monday morning sheets containing four pages of writing were  distributed to the subscribers, under the title of the _Advertiser_.  After nine issues of this kind had been published, a parcel of old  refuse type was sent over from Tasmania; and a young man being found in  the town who had, in his boyhood, spent a few months in a printing  office, he was pressed into the service, and thenceforward the  _Advertiser_ appeared in a printed form--the pioneer of the press of  Victoria. Mr. Batman had fixed his residence not far from the place now  occupied by the Spencer Street Railway Station. Here, in the year 1839,  he was seized with a violent cold; and, after being carefully nursed by  one of his daughters, died without seeing more than the beginning of  that settlement he had laboured so hard to found. Mr. Fawkner lived to  an advanced age, and saw the city--whose first house he had  built--become a vast metropolis.    [Illustration: COLLINS STREET, MELBOURNE, IN 1840.                 (Compare with page 177.)]    The year 1839 brought further increase to the population; and before the  beginning of 1840 there were 3,000 persons, with 500 houses and 70  shops, in Melbourne. In 1841, within five years of its foundation, it  contained 11,000 persons and 1,500 houses.          CHAPTER IX.    SOUTH AUSTRALIA, 1836-1841.      #1. Edward Gibbon Wakefield.#--In 1829 a small book was published in  London which attracted a great deal of attention, not only by reason of  its charming style and the liveliness of its manner, but also on account  of the complete originality of the ideas it contained. It purported to  be a letter written from Sydney, and described the annoyances to be  endured by a man of taste and fortune if he emigrated to Australia. He  could have no intellectual society; he could not enjoy the pleasures of  his library or of his picture gallery; he could hope for none of the  delights of easy retirement, seeing that he had to go forth on his land,  and with his own hands labour for his daily food. For, said Mr.  Wakefield, the author of this little book, you cannot long have free  servants in this country; if a free man arrives in the colony, though he  may for a short time work for you as a servant, yet he is sure to save a  little money, and as land is here so excessively cheap, he soon becomes  a landed proprietor. He settles down on his farm, and, though he may  have a year or two of heavy toil, yet he is almost certain to become  both happy and prosperous. Thus, the colony is an excellent place for a  poor man, but it is a wretched abode for a man of means and of culture.  Wakefield therefore proposed to found in Australia another colony, which  should be better adapted to those who had fortunes sufficient to  maintain them and yet desired to emigrate to a new country. His scheme  for effecting this purpose was to charge a high price for the land, and  so to prevent the poorer people from purchasing it; the money received  from the sale of land he proposed to employ in bringing out young men  and women, as servants and farm labourers, for the service of the  wealthier colonists. Now, said Wakefield, on account of the immense  natural resources of these colonies, their splendid soil, their  magnificent pasture lands, their vast wealth in minerals, and their  widespread forests of valuable timber, which stand ready for the axe, a  gentleman possessed of only L20,000 will obtain as large an income from  it as could be procured from L100,000 in England; yet he will be able to  enjoy his learned and cultured leisure, just as he does at home, because  all the work will be done for him by the servants he employs. For three  or four years this agreeable fallacy made quite a stir in England:  famous authors, distinguished soldiers, learned bishops were deceived by  it; noblemen, members of Parliament, bankers and merchants, all combined  to applaud this novel and excellent idea of Mr. Wakefield.      #2. South Australian Association.#--in 1831 the first effort was made to  give a practical turn to these theories, and the southern shores of  Australia were selected as a suitable locality for the proposed colony.  A company was formed; but when it applied to the British Government for  a charter, which would have conceded the complete sovereignty of the  whole southern region of Australia, Lord Goderich, the Secretary of  State, replied that it was asking a great deal too much, and abruptly  closed the negotiation. Two years later the South Australian Association  was formed, and as this company asked for nothing beyond the power to  sell waste lands and apply the proceeds to assist immigration, the  British Government gave its consent, and an Act was passed by the  Imperial Parliament to give the association full power to found a  colony. This Act directed that commissioners should be appointed to  frame laws for the colony, to establish courts, and to nominate its  officers; land was to be thrown open for sale at not less than twelve  shillings an acre, and even this comparatively high price was to be  raised, after a short time, to L1 per acre, in order to keep the land in  the hands of the wealthy. It was expressly stated that no convict would  be allowed to land in the new settlement, which, it was hoped, would  become in every respect a model community. The British Government  declined to incur any expense in establishing or in maintaining the  colony, which was to be purely self-supporting. Eleven commissioners  were appointed, of whom Colonel Torrens was chairman in England, and Mr.  Fisher the representative in Australia, where he was to take charge of  the sale of lands and supervise the affairs of the colony. At the same  time, Captain Hindmarsh was appointed Governor, and Colonel Light was  sent out to survey the waste lands preparatory to their being offered  for sale.    [Illustration: THE FIRST SETTLEMENT AT ADELAIDE, 1836.                 (Compare with page 167.)]    In May, 1835, during the very month in which Batman was wandering for  the first time on the banks of the Yarra, these appointments for the  foundation of a fourth Australian colony were being published in the  English _Government Gazette_. Thus Victoria and South Australia took  their widely different origins at almost the same time; but while the  first actual settlers landed at Port Phillip towards the end of 1835,  the pioneers of South Australia did not reach that colony until the  middle of 1836.      #3.
