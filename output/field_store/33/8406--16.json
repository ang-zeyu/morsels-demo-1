Thanks to an excellent raw material endowment, a  technically skilled labor force, and strong links to West German  industrial firms, Austria has successfully occupied specialized niches  in European industry and services (tourism, banking) and produces almost  enough food to feed itself with only 8% of the labor force in  agriculture. Improved export prospects from German unification  and the opening of Eastern Europe will also boost the economy during  the next few years. Living standards are roughly comparable with the  large industrial countries of Western Europe. Problems for the l990s  include an aging population, the high level of subsidies, and the  struggle to keep welfare benefits within budget capabilities. Austria,  which has applied for EC membership, is currently involved in EC and  European Free Trade Association negotiations for a European Economic  Area and will have to adapt its economy to achieve freer movement of  goods, services, capital, and labor with the EC.      _#_GDP: $111.0 billion, per capita $14,500; real growth rate 4.5%  (1990)      _#_Inflation rate (consumer prices): 3.3% (1990)      _#_Unemployment: 5.4% (1990)      _#_Budget: revenues $44.1 billion; expenditures $49.6 billion,  including capital expenditures of $NA (1990)      _#_Exports: $40.9 billion (f.o.b., 1990);    commodities--machinery and equipment, iron and steel, lumber,  textiles, paper products, chemicals;    partners--EC 64.8%, EFTA 10.3%, CEMA 7.7%, US 3.2%, Japan 1.5%      _#_Imports: $46.6 billion (c.i.f., 1990);    commodities--petroleum, foodstuffs, machinery and equipment,  vehicles, chemicals, textiles and clothing, pharmaceuticals;    partners--EC 68.4%, EFTA 7%, CEMA 5.7%, Japan 4.6%, US 3.6%      _#_External debt: $11.8 billion (1990 est.)      _#_Industrial production: real growth rate 8.5% (1990); accounts  for 34% of GDP      _#_Electricity: 17,562,000 kW capacity; 49,290 million kWh produced,  6,500 kWh per capita (1989)      _#_Industries: foods, iron and steel, machines, textiles, chemicals,  electrical, paper and pulp, tourism, mining      _#_Agriculture: accounts for 3.2% of GDP (including forestry);  principal crops and animals--grains, fruit, potatoes, sugar beets,  sawn wood, cattle, pigs poultry; 80-90% self-sufficient in food      _#_Economic aid: donor--ODA and OOF commitments (1970-89), $2.4  billion      _#_Currency: Austrian schilling (plural--schillings); 1 Austrian  schilling (S) = 100 groschen      _#_Exchange rates: Austrian schillings (S) per US$1--10.627 (January  1991), 11.370 (1990), 13.231 (1989), 12.348 (1988), 12.643 (1987), 15.267  (1986), 20.690 (1985)      _#_Fiscal year: calendar year      _*_Communications  _#_Railroads: 6,028 km total; 5,388 km government owned and 640 km  privately owned (1.435- and 1.000-meter gauge); 5,403 km 1.435-meter  standard gauge of which 3,051 km is electrified and 1,520 km is double  tracked; 363 km 0.760-meter narrow gauge of which 91 km is electrified      _#_Highways: 95,412 km total; 34,612 are the primary network  (including 1,012 km of autobahn, 10,400 km of federal, and 23,200 km of  provincial roads); of this number, 21,812 km are paved and 12,800 km are  unpaved; in addition, there are 60,800 km of communal roads (mostly  gravel, crushed stone, earth)      _#_Inland waterways: 446 km      _#_Ports: Vienna, Linz (river ports)      _#_Merchant marine: 32 ships (1,000 GRT or over) totaling  150,735 GRT/252,237 DWT; includes 26 cargo, 1 container, 1 chemical  tanker, 4 bulk      _#_Pipelines: 554 km crude oil; 2,611 km natural gas; 171 km refined  products      _#_Civil air: 25 major transport aircraft      _#_Airports: 55 total, 54 usable; 20 with permanent-surface runways;  none with runways over 3,659 m; 5 with runways 2,440-3,659 m; "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25012"],[0,"The Case of Wagner, Nietzsche Contra Wagner, and Selected Aphorisms.

The intellectual loathing and haughtiness of every man who has suffered  deeply--the extent to which a man can suffer, almost determines the order  of rank--the chilling uncertainty with which he is thoroughly imbued and  coloured, that by virtue of his suffering he _knows more_ than the  shrewdest and wisest can ever know, that he has been familiar with, and  \"at home\" in many distant terrible worlds of which \"_you_ know  nothing!\"--this silent intellectual haughtiness, this pride of the elect of  knowledge, of the \"initiated,\" of the almost sacrificed, finds all forms  of disguise necessary to protect itself from contact with gushing and  sympathising hands, and in general from all that is not its equal in  suffering. Profound suffering makes noble; it separates.--One of the most  refined forms of disguise is Epicurism, along with a certain ostentatious  boldness of taste which takes suffering lightly, and puts itself on the  defensive against all that is sorrowful and profound. There are \"cheerful  men\" who make use of good spirits, because they are misunderstood on  account of them--they _wish_ to be misunderstood. There are \"scientific  minds\" who make use of science, because it gives a cheerful appearance,  and because love of science leads people to conclude that a person is  shallow--they _wish_ to mislead to a false conclusion. There are free  insolent spirits which would fain conceal and deny that they are at bottom  broken, incurable hearts--this is Hamlet's case: and then folly itself can  be the mask of an unfortunate and alas! all too dead-certain knowledge.        Epilogue.      1.      I have often asked myself whether I am not much more deeply indebted to  the hardest years of my life than to any others. According to the voice of  my innermost nature, everything necessary, seen from above and in the  light of a _superior_ economy, is also useful in itself--not only should  one bear it, one should _love_ it.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} _Amor fati_: this is the very core of  my being--And as to my prolonged illness, do I not owe much more to it than  I owe to my health? To it I owe a _higher_ kind of health, a sort of  health which grows stronger under everything that does not actually kill  it!--_To it, I owe even my philosophy_.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} Only great suffering is the  ultimate emancipator of spirit, for it teaches one that _vast  suspiciousness_ which makes an X out of every U, a genuine and proper X,  _i.e._, the antepenultimate letter. Only great suffering; that great  suffering, under which we seem to be over a fire of greenwood, the  suffering that takes its time--forces us philosophers to descend into our  nethermost depths, and to let go of all trustfulness, all good-nature, all  whittling-down, all mildness, all mediocrity,--on which things we had  formerly staked our humanity. I doubt whether such suffering improves a  man; but I know that it makes him _deeper_.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} Supposing we learn to set our  pride, our scorn, our strength of will against it, and thus resemble the  Indian who, however cruelly he may be tortured, considers himself revenged  on his tormentor by the bitterness of his own tongue. Supposing we  withdraw from pain into nonentity, into the deaf, dumb, and rigid sphere  of self-surrender, self-forgetfulness, self-effacement: one is another  person when one leaves these protracted and dangerous exercises in the art  of self-mastery, one has one note of interrogation the more, and above all  one has the will henceforward to ask more, deeper, sterner, harder, more  wicked, and more silent questions, than anyone has ever asked on earth  before.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} Trust in life has vanished; life itself has become a  _problem_.--But let no one think that one has therefore become a spirit of  gloom or a blind owl! Even love of life is still possible,--but it is a  _different kind_ of love.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} It is the love for a woman whom we doubt.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~}      2.      The rarest of all things is this: to have after all another taste--a  _second_ taste. Out of such abysses, out of the abyss of _great suspicion_  as well, a man returns as though born again, he has a new skin, he is more  susceptible, more full of wickedness; he has a finer taste for joyfulness;  he has a more sensitive tongue for all good things; his senses are more  cheerful; he has acquired a second, more dangerous, innocence in gladness;  he is more childish too, and a hundred times more cunning than ever he had  been before.    Oh, how much more repulsive pleasure now is to him, that coarse, heavy,  buff-coloured pleasure, which is understood by our pleasure-seekers, our  \"cultured people,\" our wealthy folk and our rulers! With how much more  irony we now listen to the hubbub as of a country fair, with which the  \"cultured\" man and the man about town allow themselves to be forced  through art, literature, music, and with the help of intoxicating liquor,  to \"intellectual enjoyments.\" How the stage-cry of passion now stings our  ears; how strange to our taste the whole romantic riot and sensuous  bustle, which the cultured mob are so fond of, together with its  aspirations to the sublime, to the exalted and the distorted, have become.  No: if we convalescents require an art at all, it is _another_ art---a  mocking, nimble, volatile, divinely undisturbed, divinely artificial art,  which blazes up like pure flame into a cloudless sky! But above all, an  art for artists, _only for artists_! We are, after all, more conversant  with that which is in the highest degree necessary--cheerfulness, _every  kind_ of cheerfulness, my friends!{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} We men of knowledge, now know  something only too well: oh how well we have learnt by this time, to  forget, _not_ to know, as artists!{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} As to our future: we shall scarcely be  found on the track of those Egyptian youths who break into temples at  night, who embrace statues, and would fain unveil, strip, and set in broad  daylight, everything which there are excellent reasons to keep  concealed.(15) No, we are disgusted with this bad taste, this will to  truth, this search after truth \"at all costs;\" this madness of  adolescence, \"the love of truth;\" we are now too experienced, too serious,  too joyful, too scorched, _too profound_ for that.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} We no longer believe  that truth remains truth when it is _unveiled_,--we have lived enough to  understand this.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} To-day it seems to us good form not to strip everything  naked, not to be present at all things, not to desire to \"know\" all.  \"_Tout comprendre c'est tout mepriser._\"{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} \"Is it true,\" a little girl once  asked her mother, \"that the beloved Father is everywhere?--I think it quite  improper,\"--a hint to philosophers.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} The shame with which Nature has  concealed herself behind riddles and enigmas should be held in higher  esteem. Perhaps truth is a woman who has reasons for _not revealing her  reasons?_{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} Perhaps her name, to use a Greek word is _Baubo_?--Oh these  Greeks, they understood the art of _living!_ For this it is needful to  halt bravely at the surface, at the fold, at the skin, to worship  appearance, and to believe in forms, tones, words, and the whole _Olympus  of appearance_! These Greeks were superficial--from _profundity_.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} And are  we not returning to precisely the same thing, we dare-devils of intellect  who have scaled the highest and most dangerous pinnacles of present  thought, in order to look around us from that height, in order to _look  down_ from that height? Are we not precisely in this respect--_Greeks_?  Worshippers of form, of tones, of words? Precisely on that  account--_artists_?            SELECTED APHORISMS FROM NIETZSCHE'S RETROSPECT OF HIS YEARS OF FRIENDSHIP  WITH WAGNER.          (_Summer 1878._)        1.      My blunder was this, I travelled to Bayreuth with an ideal in my breast,  and was thus doomed to experience the bitterest disappointment. The  preponderance of ugliness, grotesqueness and strong pepper thoroughly  repelled me.        2.      I utterly disagree with those who were dissatisfied with the decorations,  the scenery and the mechanical contrivances at Bayreuth. Far too much  industry and ingenuity was applied to the task of chaining the imagination  to matters which did not belie their _epic_ origin. But as to the  naturalism of the attitudes, of the singing, compared with the orchestra!!  What affected, artificial and depraved tones, what a distortion of nature,  were we made to hear!        3.      We are witnessing the death agony of the _last Art_: Bayreuth has  convinced me of this.        4.      My picture of Wagner, completely surpassed him; I had depicted an _ideal  monster_--one, however, which is perhaps quite capable of kindling the  enthusiasm of artists. The real Wagner, Bayreuth as it actually is, was  only like a bad, final proof, pulled on inferior paper from the engraving  which was my creation. My longing to see real men and their motives,  received an extraordinary impetus from this humiliating experience.        5.      This, to my sorrow, is what I realised; a good deal even struck me with  sudden fear. At last I felt, however, that if only I could be strong  enough to take sides against myself and what I most loved I would find the  road to truth and get solace and encouragement from it--and in this way I  became filled with a sensation of joy far greater than that upon which I  was now voluntarily turning my back.        6.      I was in love with art, passionately in love, and in the whole of  existence saw nothing else than art--and this at an age when, reasonably  enough, quite different passions usually possess the soul.        7.      _Goethe_ said: \"The yearning spirit within me, which in"]]]
