Parson Drew Thro' Pudsey (1st Ed)       or       T' First o' t' Sooart (2nd Ed)         John Hartley         From pp 135, 136, 75, 76 and 77 of second edition.         I heeard a funny tale last neet,       I couldn't howd frae laughin' ;       'Twere at t' Bull's Head we chonced to meet,       An' spent an haar i' chaffin'.       Some sang a song, some cracked a joke,       An' all seemed full o' larkin' ;       An' t' raam were blue wi' bacca smoke,       An' ivery ee 'd a spark in.         Long Joe at comes thro' t' Jumples Clough       Were gettin' rayther mazy,       An' Warkus Ned had supped enough       To turn their Betty crazy,       An' Bob at lives at t' Bogeggs farm,       Wi' Nan thro' t' Buttress Bottom,       Were treatin' her to summat warm-       It's just his way. Odd drot 'em!         An' Jack o' t' Slade were theer as weel,       An' Joe o' Abe's thro' Waerley,       An' Lijah off o' t' Lavver Hill       Were passin' th' ale raand rarely.       Thro' raand an' square they seemed to meet       To hear or tell a story,       But t' gem o' all I heeard last neet       Were one by Doad o' t' Glory.         He bet his booits at it were true,       An' all seemed to believe him;       Though if he lost he needn't rue,       But 't wodn't done to grieve him.       His uncle lived it Pudsey taan,       An' practised local praichin';       An' if he 're lucky, he were baan       To start a schooil for taichin'.         But he were takken vary ill,       He felt his time were comin';       They say he browt it on hissel       Wi' studyin' his summin.       He called his wife an' neighbours in       To hear his deein' sarmon,       An' telled 'em if they lived i' sin       Their lot 'd be a warm 'un.         Then, turnin' raand unto his wife,       Said, \"Mal, tha knaws, owd craytur,       If I'd been blest wi' longer life       I might hae left things straighter.       Joe Sooithill owes me eighteen pence;       I lent it him last love-feast.\"       Says Mall, \"He hasn't lost his sense,       Thank God for that at least.\"         \"An' Ben o' t' top o' t' bank, tha knows,       We owe him one paand ten.\"       \"Just hark,\" says Mally, \"theer he goes,       He's ramellin' agean.\"       \"Don't tak a bit o' notice, folk;       You see, poor thing, he's ravin'.       It cuts me up to hear sich talk;       He's spent his life i' savin'.\"         \"An', Mally lass,\" he said agean,       \"Tak heed o' my direction,       T' schooil owes me hauf a craan, I mean       My share o' t' last collection.       Tha'll see to that an' have what's fair,       When my poor life is past.\"       Says Mally, \"Listen, I declare,       He's sensible at last.\"         He shut his een and sank to rest,       Death seldom claimed a better;       They put him by, bud what were t' best,       He sent 'em back a letter,       To tell' em all haa he'd goan on,       An' haa he gate to enter,       An' gav 'em rules to act upon       If iver they sud ventur.         Saint Peter stood wi' keys i' hand,       Says he, \"What do ye want, sir,       If to go in, you understand,       Unknown to me, you can't, sir.       Pray what's your name? Where are ye thro'(3)?       Just make your business clear?\",       Says he, \"They call me 'Parson Drew,'       I've come thro' Pudsey here.\"         \"Ye've come thro' Pudsey, do ye say?       Don't try sich jokes on me, sir;       I've kept these doors too long a day,       I can't be fooled by thee, sir.\"       Says Drew; \"I wodn't tell a lie       For t' sake o' all there's in it,       If ye've a map o' England by,       I'll show you in a minute.\"         So Peter gate a time-table,       They gloor'd(4) ower t' map together,       An' Drew did all at he were able,       But couldn't find it either.       At last says he, \"There's Leeds Taan Hall,       An' there stands Bradford's Mission;       It's just between them two--that's all,       Your map's an old edition.         \"Bud theer it is--I'll lay a craan;--       An' if ye've niver knawn it,       Ye've miss'd a bonny Yorkshire taan,       Though monny be at scorn it.\"       He oppen'd t' gate; says he, \"It's time       Somebody coom--I'll trust thee;--       Tha'll find inside no friends o' thine,       Tha'rt first at's coom thro' Pudsey.\"         1.

From these several facts it must be admitted that certain characters,  capacities, and instincts may lie latent in an individual, and even in a  succession of individuals, without our being able to detect the least signs  of their presence. We have {55} already seen that the transmission of a  character from the grandparent to the grandchild, with its apparent  omission in the intermediate parent of the opposite sex, becomes simple on  this view. When fowls, pigeons, or cattle of different colours are crossed,  and their offspring change colour as they grow old, or when the crossed  turbit acquired the characteristic frill after its third moult, or when  purely-bred bantams partially assume the red plumage of their prototype, we  cannot doubt that these qualities were from the first present, though  latent, in the individual animal, like the characters of a moth in the  caterpillar. Now, if these animals had produced offspring before they had  acquired with advancing age their new characters, nothing is more probable  than that they would have transmitted them to some of their offspring,  which in this case would in appearance have received such characters from  their grandparents or more distant progenitors. We should then have had a  case of reversion, that is, of the reappearance in the child of an  ancestral character, actually present, though during youth completely  latent, in the parent; and this we may safely conclude is what occurs with  reversions of all kinds to progenitors however remote.    This view of the latency in each generation of all the characters which  appear through reversion, is also supported by their actual presence in  some cases during early youth alone, or by their more frequent appearance  and greater distinctness at this age than during maturity. We have seen  that this is often the case with the stripes on the legs and faces of the  several species of the horse-genus. The Himalayan rabbit, when crossed,  sometimes produces offspring which revert to the parent silver-grey breed,  and we have seen that in purely bred animals pale-grey fur occasionally  reappears during early youth. Black cats, we may feel assured, would  occasionally produce by reversion tabbies; and on young black kittens, with  a pedigree[128] known to have been long pure, faint traces of stripes may  almost always be seen which afterwards disappear. Hornless Suffolk cattle  occasionally produce by reversion horned animals; and Youatt[129] asserts  that even in hornless individuals {56} \"the rudiment of a horn may be often  felt at an early age.\"    No doubt it appears at first sight in the highest degree improbable that in  every horse of every generation there should be a latent capacity and  tendency to produce stripes, though these may not appear once in a thousand  generations; that in every white, black, or other coloured pigeon, which  may have transmitted its proper colour during centuries, there should be a  latent capacity in the plumage to become blue and to be marked with certain  characteristic bars; that in every child in a six-fingered family there  should be the capacity for the production of an additional digit; and so in  other cases. Nevertheless there is no more inherent improbability in this  being the case than in a useless and rudimentary organ, or even in only a  tendency to the production of a rudimentary organ, being inherited during  millions of generations, as is well known to occur with a multitude of  organic beings. There is no more inherent improbability in each domestic  pig, during a thousand generations, retaining the capacity and tendency to  develop great tusks under fitting conditions, than in the young calf having  retained for an indefinite number of generations rudimentary incisor teeth,  which never protrude through the gums.    I shall give at the end of the next chapter a summary of the three  preceding chapters; but as isolated and striking cases of reversion have  here been chiefly insisted on, I wish to guard the reader against supposing  that reversion is due to some rare or accidental combination of  circumstances. When a character, lost during hundreds of generations,  suddenly reappears, no doubt some such combination must occur; but  reversions may be constantly observed, at least to the immediately  preceding generations, in the offspring of most unions. This has been  universally recognised in the case of hybrids and mongrels, but it has been  recognised simply from the difference between the united forms rendering  the resemblance of the offspring to their grandparents or more remote  progenitors of easy detection. Reversion is likewise almost invariably the  rule, as Mr. Sedgwick has shown, with certain diseases. Hence we must  conclude that a tendency to this peculiar form of transmission is an  integral part of the general law of inheritance. {57}           *       *       *       *       *    _Monstrosities._--A large number of monstrous growths and of lesser  anomalies are admitted by every one to be due to an arrest of development,  that is to the persistence of an embryonic condition. If every horse or ass  had striped legs whilst young, the stripes which occasionally appear on  these animals when adult would have to be considered as due to the  anomalous retention of an early character, and not as due to reversion.  Now, the leg-stripes in the horse-genus, and some other characters in  analogous cases, are apt to occur during early youth and then to disappear;  thus the persistence of early characters and reversion are brought into  close connexion.    But many monstrosities can hardly be considered as the result of an arrest  of development; for parts of which no trace can be detected in the embryo,  but which occur in other members of the same class of animals or plants,  occasionally appear, and these may probably with truth be attributed to  reversion. For instance: supernumerary mammae, capable of secreting milk,  are not extremely rare in women; and as many as five have been observed.  When four are developed, they are generally arranged symmetrically on each  side of the chest; and in one instance a woman (the daughter of another  with supernumerary mammae) had one mamma, which yielded milk, developed in  the inguinal region. This latter case, when we remember the position of the  mammae in some of the lower animals on both the chest and inguinal region,  is highly remarkable, and leads to the belief that in all cases the  additional mammae in woman are due to reversion. The facts given in the  last chapter on the tendency in supernumerary digits to regrowth after  amputation, indicate their relation to the digits of the lower vertebrate  animals, and lead to the suspicion that their appearance may in some manner  be connected with reversion. But I shall have to recur, in the chapter on  pangenesis, to the abnormal multiplication of organs, and likewise to their  occasional transposition. The occasional development in man of the  coccygeal vertebrae into a short and free tail, though it thus becomes in  one sense more perfectly developed, may at the same time be considered as  an arrest of development, and as a case of reversion. The greater frequency  of a monstrous kind of proboscis in the pig than in any other mammal,  considering the position of the pig {58} in the mammalian series, has  likewise been attributed, perhaps truly, to reversion.[130]        When flowers which are properly irregular in structure become regular      or peloric, the change is generally looked at by botanists as a return      to the primitive state. But Dr. Maxwell Masters,[131] who has ably      discussed this subject, remarks that when, for instance, all the sepals      of a Tropaeolum become green and of the same shape, instead of being      coloured with one alone prolonged into a spur, or when all the petals      of a Linaria become simple and regular, such cases may be due merely to      an arrest of development; for in these flowers all the organs during      their earliest condition are symmetrical, and, if arrested at this      stage of growth, they would not become irregular. If, moreover, the      arrest were to take place at a still earlier period of development, the      result would be a simple tuft of green leaves; and no one probably      would call this a case of reversion. Dr. Masters designates the cases      first alluded to as regular peloria; and others, in which all the      corresponding parts assume a similar form of irregularity, as when all      the petals in a Linaria become spurred, as irregular peloria. We have      no right to attribute these latter cases to reversion, until it can be      shown to be probable that the parent-form, for instance, of the genus      Linaria had had all its petals spurred; for a change of this nature      might result from the spreading of an anomalous structure, in"]]]
