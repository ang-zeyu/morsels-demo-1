Styles 2-3, divergent; small papillary  stigmas. Drupe pulpy, globose, resembling a crab-apple in size and  taste, enclosing a hard, 2-celled seed.    Habitat.--Common in all parts of the islands.        _Rhamnus Wightii_, W. & Arn. (_Ceanothus Wightiana_, Wall.;  _R. Carolianus_, Blanco.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Kabatiti_, Tag.    Uses.--The dried trunk bark is the part employed in medicine. Hooper  analyzed it in 1888 and found a crystalline principle (0.47%), a  brown resin (0.85), a red resin (1.15), a bitter principle (1.23),  sugar, starch, calcium, oxalate, etc.    As the active principles exist in the resins, an alcoholic tincture  of the latter is the best preparation for administration. In India  it is used as a tonic and an astringent.    Botanical Description.--A small tree that grows near the sea  coast. Trunk 9-12° high, straight, many-branched, devoid of  thorns. Leaves alternate, ovate, acutely serrate, glabrous,  short-petioled. Flowers greenish-white, axillary, perfect. Calyx  5-toothed, inversely conical. Corolla, 5 petals, smaller than the  teeth of the calyx, oval, without claws, notched at the apex. Disc  fleshy, smooth, slightly concave. Stamens 5, hidden within  the petals. Filaments flattened. Anthers rounded. Ovary fleshy,  inserted at the bottom of the calyx tube. Style short. Stigmas 3,  divergent. Fruit oval, its base adherent to the calyx, 3 seeds.    Habitat.--Batangas. Blooms in July and October.          ANACARDIACEÆ.    Cashew Family.        _Mangifera Indica_, L.    Nom. Vulg.--_Manga._    Uses.--The dried and pulverized kernel of the seed is used as an  anthelmintic in doses of 1 1/2-2 grams both in India and Brazil. The  same preparation is used in the Philippines in the treatment of  dysentery and diarrhoea and its effect is doubtless due to the large  quantity of tannin it contains. It is administered as follows: The  pounded kernels of 20-25 seeds are brought to a boil in 2 bottles  (sic) of water. When the liquid has evaporated a third, it is  removed from the fire, cooled, decanted, and again placed on the  fire after adding three to four hundred grams of sugar. This time  it is allowed to boil till reduced to one bottle. The dose is 50-60  grams 2-3 times a day. Incisions in the trunk exude a brownish resin  which solidifies in the air, is slightly acrid, bitter, dissolves in  alcohol and partially in water. In Malabar it is given internally  in the treatment of diarrhoea and dysentery, mixing it with white  of egg and opium. But the curative value of the combination is more  likely due to the albumen and opium than to the resin. Dissolved in  lemon juice it is a useful application in the itch. The trunk bark  is astringent and is employed in decoction as a wash for ulcers and  eczema and as an injection in leucorrhoea.    The fruit is one of the most highly prized in the Philippines, and  resident Europeans are able to eat large quantities of it without ill  effects unless the fruit is over-ripe, in which case it often causes  transient diarrhoea, which should be treated with a mild purge.    In Mauritius the following compound powder is used in dysentery:              Dried slices of manga fruit             30 grams.          Dried manga kernels                     60 grams.          Plantain seeds                          15 grams.          Dried ginger                             8 grams.          Gum arabic                              15 grams.          Pulverize each ingredient separately;          add powdered candy sugar                30 grams.      Mix.    Dose.--For an adult one dessert-spoonful every 4 hours; may be given  in cauge or arrowroot.    The flowers, testa and bark are, in Hindoo therapeutics, considered  \"cold,\" and \"astringent,\" and are used especially in diarrhoea. In  certain throat affections the Hindoos employ the burning leaves for  inhalation. They also use the gum made by evaporating the juice of  the ripe fruit, as a confection and an antiscorbutic. Dr. Linguist  recommends the bark as a local astringent in uterine, intestinal and  pulmonary hemorrhage and employs the following:    _Fluid Extract_.--              Fluid extract of manga bark         10 grams.          Water                              120 grams.      Mix. Dose, 1 teaspoonful every 1 or 2 hours.      Botanical Description.--A noble tree, 30° to 40° high, dome-like  or rotund in outline. Leaves dark green, lustrous, alternate,  lanceolate, entire; short petioles. Flowers racemose, in verticillate  panicles. Calyx, 4, 5 or 6 sepals. Corolla white, fragrant, 4, 5 or  6 petals. Stamens 5, of which perhaps 1, 2 or 3 are fertile. Style on  one side of the ovary. Stigma simple. Fruit large, reniform, fleshy,  yellow when ripe; contains a large, flattened, reniform pit. Blooms  from January even till June. The natives force the fruit by building  fires under the trees when but little air is stirring.    Habitat.--Common throughout the islands.        _Anacardium occidentale_, L. (_Cassuvium reniforme_, Blanco.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Kasuy_, Tag.; _Caskew Nut_, Eng.    Uses.--The pericarp of the nut contains an essential oil which is very  irritant and used by the Hindoos as a vesicant; it severely blisters  the lips and tongues of imprudent persons who break the nut without  taking the precaution of cleansing it of the oil before opening it. In  addition to the oil called _cardol_, the pericarp contains an especial  acid _anacardic_, a little tannin and ammonia. Cardol (C_21_H_31_O_2_)  is an oleaginous, yellow liquid very unstable, neutral, soluble  in alcohol and ether, insoluble in water, volatile, and vesicant if  applied to the skin. \"Anacardic\" acid is white, crystalline, odorless,  with a burning, aromatic taste. It melts at 26° and decomposes at 200°  forming a colorless oil; it is not vesicant, burns with a dark flame,  and has the odor of rancid oil. A tincture of the pericarp has been  made (1 part to 10 of alcohol) and given internally as a vermifuge  in doses of 2-10 drops. Cardol, according to some authors, does not  exercise a vesicant action in the gastro-intestinal canal, because it  is not dissolved by the gastro-intestinal juices; I am sure, however,  that I have seen a choleraic diarrhoea brought on by swallowing,  in fun, the pericarp of one nut and a half. Cardol is eliminated by  the urine.    The kernel is edible and has a very agreeable taste when roasted. By  expression it yields a sweet, yellowish oil, density 0.916.    The trunk exudes a gum resin in masses varying in color from red  to yellow.    The fleshy part, called the fruit, is edible but contains a certain  quantity of cardol not only evidenced by the odor but by the  smarting of the mouth and throat after eating. It is very juicy and  the expressed liquid is fermented in Bombay and distilled to make a  very weak alcohol which sells for the very low price of 4 annas (5  cents gold) a gallon. This alcohol is again distilled and a stronger  obtained which sells for 1 1/2 rupees a gallon. The Portuguese of  India make a sort of wine from the fermented juice of the fruit,  which, like the weak alcohol we have mentioned, is a well-known  diuretic and is used as a liniment.    The gum resin of the trunk contains 90% of anacardic acid and 10%  cardol. Wood soaked in it is preserved from the ravages of insects,  especially of white ants, for which purpose it is used by bookbinders  also. Therapeutically it is used externally in leprosy, old ulcers  and to destroy corns, but on account of its rubefacient and vesicant  qualities it is necessary to use it cautiously.    Botanical Description.--A tree, 18° high, with leaves cuneiform,  glabrous, stiff, short-petioled. Flowers polygamous in terminal  panicles. Calyx with 5 erect segments, imbricated, caducous. Corolla,  5 linear, lanceolate petals, curved and imbricated. Stamens 8-10,  all fertile. Filaments united to one another and to the disc. Ovary  heart-shaped. Style filiform and eccentric. Stigma defective. Ovule  solitary. Fruit a reniform nut enclosed in a pulpy pyriform body,  formed by the matured disc and extremity of the peduncle. Seed  reniform, testa membranous.    Habitat.--Common throughout the Archipelago. Blooms in February.        _Odina Wodier_, Roxb.    Nom. Vulg.--_Amugis_, Tag. and Vis.    Uses.--The bark is very astringent and in decoction is used for  chronic ulcers. In India Dr. Kirkpatrick has used it as a lotion in  impetigo. It has also given good results as a gargle in affections  of the pharynx and buccal cavity.    The trunk exudes a gum called in India \"kanni ki gond,\" an article  of commerce. It is almost odorless and has a disagreeable taste. It  is only partially soluble in water, forming a viscid mucilage. It is  used in the treatment of contusions and sprains and is edible when  mixed with cocoanut milk.    Botanical Description.--A tree, with leaves bunched at the extremities  of the branches, oblong, oval, acuminate, odd-pinnate, 3-4 pairs of  opposite leaflets. Flowers greenish-white, polygamous, in terminal  panicles. Calyx gamosepalous, 4 rounded lobules. Corolla, 4 imbricated  petals. Stamens 8, free. Ovary 4-parted. Pistillate flowers; ovary  sessile, oblong, unilocular. Style 4-parted, thick. Drupe oblong,  compressed, unicellular. Testa hard, with 1 non-albuminous kernel.    Habitat.--San Mateo.

Vulg.--_Malungay_, _Kamalungay_, _Kalungay_, Tag.; _Dool_,  _Malungit_, Vis. and Pam.; _Horse Radish Tree_, Indo-Eng.    Uses.--The root is vesicant and the Filipinos bruise it and use it for  sinapisms. I have often observed, however, that it is quite painful  used in this way. Dr. Waitz states that it is a good plan to add a few  drops of the root juice to mustard sinapisms, a proceeding which seems  to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2641"],[0,"A Room with a View (#15)"],[1,"k's pension.\"    \"I expect she will. However, we shall be much more comfortable at the  Vyses' hotel. Isn't afternoon tea given there for nothing?\"    \"Yes, but they pay extra for wine.\" After this remark she remained  motionless and silent. To her tired eyes Charlotte throbbed and swelled  like a ghostly figure in a dream.    They began to sort their clothes for packing, for there was no time to  lose, if they were to catch the train to Rome. Lucy, when admonished,  began to move to and fro between the rooms, more conscious of the  discomforts of packing by candlelight than of a subtler ill. Charlotte,  who was practical without ability, knelt by the side of an empty trunk,  vainly endeavouring to pave it with books of varying thickness and size.  She gave two or three sighs, for the stooping posture hurt her back,  and, for all her diplomacy, she felt that she was growing old. The girl  heard her as she entered the room, and was seized with one of those  emotional impulses to which she could never attribute a cause. She only  felt that the candle would burn better, the packing go easier, the world  be happier, if she could give and receive some human love. The impulse  had come before to-day, but never so strongly. She knelt down by her  cousin's side and took her in her arms.    Miss Bartlett returned the embrace with tenderness and warmth. But she  was not a stupid woman, and she knew perfectly well that Lucy did not  love her, but needed her to love. For it was in ominous tones that she  said, after a long pause:    \"Dearest Lucy, how will you ever forgive me?\"    Lucy was on her guard at once, knowing by bitter experience what  forgiving Miss Bartlett meant. Her emotion relaxed, she modified her  embrace a little, and she said:    \"Charlotte dear, what do you mean? As if I have anything to forgive!\"    \"You have a great deal, and I have a very great deal to forgive myself,  too. I know well how much I vex you at every turn.\"    \"But no--\"    Miss Bartlett assumed her favourite role, that of the prematurely aged  martyr.    \"Ah, but yes! I feel that our tour together is hardly the success I had  hoped. I might have known it would not do. You want someone younger  and stronger and more in sympathy with you. I am too uninteresting and  old-fashioned--only fit to pack and unpack your things.\"    \"Please--\"    \"My only consolation was that you found people more to your taste, and  were often able to leave me at home. I had my own poor ideas of what a  lady ought to do, but I hope I did not inflict them on you more than was  necessary. You had your own way about these rooms, at all events.\"    \"You mustn't say these things,\" said Lucy softly.    She still clung to the hope that she and Charlotte loved each other,  heart and soul. They continued to pack in silence.    \"I have been a failure,\" said Miss Bartlett, as she struggled with the  straps of Lucy's trunk instead of strapping her own. \"Failed to make you  happy; failed in my duty to your mother. She has been so generous to me;  I shall never face her again after this disaster.\"    \"But mother will understand. It is not your fault, this trouble, and it  isn't a disaster either.\"    \"It is my fault, it is a disaster. She will never forgive me, and  rightly. For instance, what right had I to make friends with Miss  Lavish?\"    \"Every right.\"    \"When I was here for your sake? If I have vexed you it is equally true  that I have neglected you. Your mother will see this as clearly as I do,  when you tell her.\"    Lucy, from a cowardly wish to improve the situation, said:    \"Why need mother hear of it?\"    \"But you tell her everything?\"    \"I suppose I do generally.\"    \"I dare not break your confidence. There is something sacred in it.  Unless you feel that it is a thing you could not tell her.\"    The girl would not be degraded to this.    \"Naturally I should have told her. But in case she should blame you in  any way, I promise I will not, I am very willing not to. I will never  speak of it either to her or to any one.\"    Her promise brought the long-drawn interview to a sudden close. Miss  Bartlett pecked her smartly on both cheeks, wished her good-night, and  sent her to her own room.    For a moment the original trouble was in the background. George would  seem to have behaved like a cad throughout; perhaps that was the view  which one would take eventually. At present she neither acquitted nor  condemned him; she did not pass judgement. At the moment when she was  about to judge him her cousin's voice had intervened, and, ever since,  it was Miss Bartlett who had dominated; Miss Bartlett who, even  now, could be heard sighing into a crack in the partition wall;  Miss Bartlett, who had really been neither pliable nor humble nor  inconsistent. She had worked like a great artist; for a time--indeed,  for years--she had been meaningless, but at the end there was presented  to the girl the complete picture of a cheerless, loveless world in which  the young rush to destruction until they learn better--a shamefaced  world of precautions and barriers which may avert evil, but which do not  seem to bring good, if we may judge from those who have used them most.    Lucy was suffering from the most grievous wrong which this world has yet  discovered: diplomatic advantage had been taken of her sincerity, of  her craving for sympathy and love. Such a wrong is not easily forgotten.  Never again did she expose herself without due consideration and  precaution against rebuff. And such a wrong may react disastrously upon  the soul.    The door-bell rang, and she started to the shutters. Before she reached  them she hesitated, turned, and blew out the candle. Thus it was that,  though she saw someone standing in the wet below, he, though he looked  up, did not see her.    To reach his room he had to go by hers. She was still dressed. It struck  her that she might slip into the passage and just say that she would  be gone before he was up, and that their extraordinary intercourse was  over.    Whether she would have dared to do this was never proved. At the  critical moment Miss Bartlett opened her own door, and her voice said:    \"I wish one word with you in the drawing-room, Mr. Emerson, please.\"    Soon their footsteps returned, and Miss Bartlett said: \"Good-night, Mr.  Emerson.\"    His heavy, tired breathing was the only reply; the chaperon had done her  work.    Lucy cried aloud: \"It isn't true. It can't all be true. I want not to be  muddled. I want to grow older quickly.\"    Miss Bartlett tapped on the wall.    \"Go to bed at once, dear. You need all the rest you can get.\"    In the morning they left for Rome.          Part Two      Chapter VIII: Medieval    The drawing-room curtains at Windy Corner had been pulled to meet, for  the carpet was new and deserved protection from the August sun. They  were heavy curtains, reaching almost to the ground, and the light  that filtered through them was subdued and varied. A poet--none was  present--might have quoted, \"Life like a dome of many coloured glass,\"  or might have compared the curtains to sluice-gates, lowered against  the intolerable tides of heaven. Without was poured a sea of radiance;  within, the glory, though visible, was tempered to the capacities of  man.    Two pleasant people sat in the room. One--a boy of nineteen--was  studying a small manual of anatomy, and peering occasionally at a bone  which lay upon the piano. From time to time he bounced in his chair and  puffed and groaned, for the day was hot and the print small, and the  human frame fearfully made; and his mother, who was writing a letter,  did continually read out to him what she had written. And continually  did she rise from her seat and part the curtains so that a rivulet of  light fell across the carpet, and make the remark that they were still  there.    \"Where aren't they?\" said the boy, who was Freddy, Lucy's brother. \"I  tell you I'm getting fairly sick.\"    \"For goodness' sake go out of my drawing-room, then?\" cried Mrs.  Honeychurch, who hoped to cure her children of slang by taking it  literally.    Freddy did not move or reply.    \"I think things are coming to a head,\" she observed, rather wanting  her son's opinion on the situation if she could obtain it without undue  supplication.    \"Time they did.\"    \"I am glad that Cecil is asking her this once more.\"    \"It's his third go, isn't it?\"    \"Freddy I do call the way you talk unkind.\"    \"I didn't mean to be unkind.\" Then he added: \"But I do think Lucy might  have got this off her chest in Italy. I don't know how girls manage  things, but she can't have said 'No' properly before, or she wouldn't  have to say it again now. Over the whole thing--I can't explain--I do  feel so uncomfortable.\"    \"Do you indeed, dear? How interesting!\"    \"I feel--never mind.\"    He returned to his work.    \"Just listen to what I have written to Mrs. Vyse. I said: 'Dear Mrs.  Vyse.'\"    \"Yes, mother, you told me. A jolly good letter.\"    \"I said: 'Dear Mrs. Vyse, Cecil has just asked my permission about  it, and I should be delighted, if Lucy wishes it. But--'\" She stopped  reading, \"I was rather amused at Cecil asking my permission at all. He  has always gone in for unconventionality, and parents nowhere, and so  forth. When it comes to the point, he can't get on without me.\"    \"Nor me.\"    \"You?\"    Freddy nodded.    \"What do you mean?\"    \"He asked me for my permission also.\"    She exclaimed: \"How very odd of him!\"    \"Why so?\" asked the son and heir. \"Why shouldn't my permission be  asked?\"    \"What do you know about Lucy or girls or anything? What ever did you  say?\"    \"I said to Cecil, 'Take her or leave her; it's no business of mine!'\"    \"What a helpful answer!\" But her own answer, though more normal in its  wording, had been to the same effect.    \"The bother is this,\" began Freddy.    Then he took up his work again, too shy to say what the bother was. Mrs.  Honeychurch went back to"]]]
