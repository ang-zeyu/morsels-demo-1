Let him watch as long as he please,  he will hardly see the prize awarded.    Nevertheless he need not grudge the time thus employed; not, at any  rate, if he be sensitive to music. For it will be found that birds have  at least one attribute of genius: they can do their best only on great  occasions. Our brown thrush, for instance, is a magnificent singer,  albeit he is not of the best school, being too \"sensational\" to suit the  most exacting taste. His song is a grand improvisation: a good deal  jumbled, to be sure, and without any recognizable form or theme; and  yet, like a Liszt rhapsody, it perfectly answers its purpose,--that is,  it gives the performer full scope to show what he can do with his  instrument. You may laugh a little, if you like, at an occasional  grotesque or overwrought passage, but unless you are well used to it you  will surely be astonished. Such power and range of voice; such startling  transitions; such endless variety! And withal such boundless enthusiasm  and almost incredible endurance! Regarded as pure music, one strain of  the hermit thrush is to my mind worth the whole of it; just as a single  movement of Beethoven's is better than a world of Liszt transcriptions.  But in its own way it is unsurpassable.    Still, though this is a meagre and quite unexaggerated account of the  ordinary song of the brown thrush, I have discovered that even he can be  outdone--by himself. One morning in early May I came upon three birds of  this species, all singing at once, in a kind of jealous frenzy. As they  sang they continually shifted from tree to tree, and one in particular  (the one nearest to where I stood) could hardly be quiet a moment. Once  he sang with full power while on the ground (or close to it, for he was  just then behind a low bush), after which he mounted to the very tip of  a tall pine, which bent beneath his weight. In the midst of the  hurly-burly one of the trio suddenly sounded the whip-poor-will's call  twice,--an absolutely perfect reproduction.[17]    The significance of all this sound and fury,--what the prize was, if  any, and who obtained it,--this another can conjecture as well as  myself. I know no more than old Kaspar:----        \"'Why, that I cannot tell,' said he,      But 'twas a famous victory.'\"    As I turned to come away, the contest all at once ceased, and the  silence of the woods, or what seemed like silence, was really  impressive. The chewinks and field sparrows were singing, but it was  like the music of a village singer after Patti; or, to make the  comparison less unjust, like the Pastoral Symphony of Handel after a  Wagner tempest.    It is curious how deeply we are sometimes affected by a very trifling  occurrence. I have remembered many times a slight scene in which three  purple finches were the actors. Of the two males, one was in full adult  plumage of bright crimson, while the other still wore his youthful suit  of brown. First, the older bird suspended himself in mid air, and sang  most beautifully; dropping, as he concluded, to a perch beside the  female. Then the younger candidate, who was already sitting near by,  took his turn, singing nearly or quite as well as his rival, but without  quitting the branch, though his wings quivered. I saw no more. Yet, as I  say, I have often since thought of the three birds, and wondered whether  the bright feathers and the flying song carried the day against the  younger suitor. I fear they did. Sometimes, too, I have queried whether  young birds (who none the less are of age to marry) can be so very meek  or so very dull as never to rebel against the fashion that only the old  fellows shall dress handsomely; and I have tried in vain to imagine the  mutterings, deep and loud, which such a law would excite in certain  other quarters. It pains me to say it, but I suspect that taxation  without representation would seem a small injustice, in comparison.    Like these linnets in the exceptional interest they excited were two  large seabirds, who suddenly appeared circling about over the woods, as  I was taking a solitary walk on a Sunday morning in April. One of them  was closely pursuing the other; not as though he were trying to overtake  her, but rather as though he were determined to keep her company. They  swept now this way, now that,--now lost to sight, and now reappearing;  and once they passed straight over my head, so that I heard the  whistling of their wings. Then they were off, and I saw them no more.  They came from far, and by night they were perhaps a hundred leagues  away. But I followed them with my blessing, and to this day I feel  toward them a little as I suppose we all do toward a certain few  strangers whom we have met here and there in our journeyings, and  chatted with for an hour or two. We had never seen them before; if we  learned their names we have long ago forgotten them; but somehow the  persons themselves keep a place in our memory, and even in our  affection.        \"I crossed a moor, with a name of its own      And a certain use in the world, no doubt;      Yet a hand's breadth of it shines alone      'Mid the blank miles round about:        \"For there I picked up on the heather,      And there I put inside my breast,      A moulted feather, an eagle-feather!      Well, I forget the rest.\"    Since we cannot ask birds for an explanation of their conduct, we have  nothing for it but to steal their secrets, as far as possible, by  patient and stealthy watching. In this way I hope, sooner or later, to  find out what the golden-winged woodpecker means by the shout with which  he makes the fields reecho in the spring, especially in the latter half  of April. I have no doubt it has something to do with the process of  mating, but it puzzles me to guess just what the message can be which  requires to be published so loudly. Such a stentorian, long-winded cry!  You wonder where the bird finds breath for such an effort, and think he  must be a very ungentle lover, surely. But withhold your judgment for a  few days, till you see him and his mate gamboling about the branches of  some old tree, calling in soft, affectionate tones, _Wick-a-wick,  wick-a-wick_; then you will confess that, whatever failings the  golden-wing may have, he is not to be charged with insensibility. The  fact is that our \"yellow-hammer\" has a genius for noise. When he is  _very_ happy he drums. Sometimes, indeed, he marvels how birds who  haven't this resource are able to get through the world at all. Nor  ought we to think it strange if in his love-making he finds great use  for this his crowning accomplishment. True, we have nowhere read of a  human lover's serenading his mistress with a drum; but we must remember  what creatures of convention men are, and that there is no inherent  reason why a drum should not serve as well as a flute for such a  purpose.        \"All thoughts, all passions, all delights,      Whatever stirs this mortal frame,      _All_ are but ministers of Love,        And feed his sacred flame.\"    I saw two of these flickers clinging to the trunk of a shell-bark tree;  which, by the way, is a tree after the woodpecker's own heart. One was  perhaps fifteen feet above the other, and before each was a strip of  loose bark, a sort of natural drum-head. First, the lower one \"beat his  music out,\" rather softly. Then, as he ceased, and held his head back  to listen, the other answered him; and so the dialogue went on.  Evidently, they were already mated, and were now renewing their mutual  vows; for birds, to their praise be it spoken, believe in courtship  after marriage. The day happened to be Sunday, and it did occur to me  that possibly this was the woodpeckers' ritual,--a kind of High Church  service, with antiphonal choirs. But I dismissed the thought; for, on  the whole, the shouting seems more likely to be diagnostic, and in spite  of his gold-lined wings, I have set the flicker down as almost certainly  an old-fashioned Methodist.    Speaking of courtship after marriage, I am reminded of a spotted  sandpiper, whose capers I amused myself with watching, one day last  June, on the shore of Saco Lake. As I caught sight of him, he was  straightening himself up, with a pretty, self-conscious air, at the same  time spreading his white-edged tail, and calling, _Tweet, tweet,  tweet_.[18] Afterwards he got upon a log, where, with head erect and  wings thrown forward and downward, he ran for a yard or two, calling as  before. This trick seemed especially to please him, and was several  times repeated. He ran rapidly, and with a comical prancing movement;  but nothing he did was half so laughable as the behavior of his mate,  who all this while dressed her feathers without once deigning to look at  her spouse's performance. Undoubtedly they had been married for several  weeks, and she was, by this time, well used to his nonsense. It must be  a devoted husband, I fancy, who continues to offer attentions when they  are received in such a spirit.    Walking a log is a somewhat common practice with birds. I once detected  our little golden-crowned thrush showing off in this way to his mate,  who stood on the ground close at hand. In his case the head was lowered  instead of raised, and the general effect was heightened by his  curiously precise gait, which even on ordinary occasions is enough to  provoke a smile.    Not improbably every species of birds has its own code of etiquette;  unwritten, of course, but carefully handed down from father to son, and  faithfully observed. Nor is it cause for wonder if, in our ignorant  eyes, some of these \"society manners\" look a little ridiculous. Even the  usages of fashionable human circles have not always escaped the laughter  of the profane.    I was standing on the edge of a small thicket, observing a pair of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28020"],[0,"History of Woman Suffrage, Volume I (#15)"],[1,"you       are putting forward.         The Rev. A. Harvey, of Glasgow: It was stated by a brother from       America, that with him it is a matter of conscience, and it is a       question of conscience with me too. I have certain views in       relation to the teaching of the Word of God, and of the       particular sphere in which woman is to act. I must say, whether I       am right in my interpretations of the Word of God or not, that my       own decided convictions are, if I were to give a vote in favor of       females, sitting and deliberating in such an assembly as this,       that I should be acting in opposition to the plain teaching of       the Word of God. I may be wrong, but I have a conscience on the       subject, and I am sure there are a number present of the same       mind.         Captain Wanchope, R. N., delegate from Carlisle: I entreat the       ladies not to push this question too far. I wish to know whether       our friends from America are to cast off England altogether. Have       we not given L20,000,000 of our money for the purpose of doing       away with the abominations of slavery? Is not that proof that we       are in earnest about it?         James C. Fuller: One friend said that this question should have       been settled on the other side of the Atlantic. Why, it was there       decided in favor of woman a year ago.         James Gillespie Birney: It has been stated that the right of       women to sit and act in all respects as men in our anti-slavery       associations, was decided in the affirmative at the annual       meeting of the American Anti-Slavery Society in May, 1839. It is       true the claim was so decided on that occasion, but not by a       large majority; whilst it is also true that the majority was       swelled by the votes of the women themselves. I have just       received a letter from a gentleman in New York (Louis Tappan),       communicating the fact, that the persistence of the friends of       promiscuous female representation in pressing that practice on       the American Anti-Slavery Society, at its annual meeting on the       twelfth of last month, had caused such disagreement among the       members present, that he and others who viewed the subject as he       did, were then deliberating on measures for seceding from the old       organization.         Rev. C. Stout: My vote is that we confirm the list of delegates,       that we take votes on that as an amendment, and that we       henceforth entertain this question no more. Are we not met here       pledged to sacrifice all but everything, in order that we may do       something against slavery, and shall we be divided on this       _paltry question_ and suffer the whole tide of benevolence to be       stopped by a _straw_? No! You talk of being men, then be men!       Consider what is worthy of your attention.         Rev. Dr. Morrison: I feel, I believe, as our brethren from       America and many English friends do at this moment, that we are       treading on the brink of a precipice; and that precipice is the       awaking in our bosoms by this discussion, feelings that will not       only be averse to the great object for which we have assembled,       but inconsistent, perhaps, in some degree, with the Christian       spirit which, I trust, will pervade all meetings connected with       the Anti-Slavery cause. We have been unanimous against the common       foe, but we are this day in danger of creating division among       heartfelt friends. Will our American brethren put us in this       position? Will they keep up a discussion in which the delicacy,       the honor, the respectability of those excellent females who have       come from the Western world are concerned? I tremble at the       thought of discussing the question in the presence of these       ladies--for whom I entertain the most profound respect--and I am       bold to say, that but for the introduction of the question of       woman's rights, it would be impossible for the shrinking nature       of woman to subject itself to the infliction of such a discussion       as this.    As the hour was late, and as the paltry arguments of the opposition  were unworthy much consideration--as the reader will see from the  specimens given--Mr. Phillips' reply was brief, consisting of the  correction of a few mistakes made by different speakers. The vote was  taken, and the women excluded as delegates of the Convention, by an  overwhelming majority.         George Thompson: I hope, as the question is now decided, that Mr.       Phillips will give us the assurance that we shall proceed with       one heart and one mind.         Mr. Phillips replied: I have no doubt of it. There is no       unpleasant feeling in our minds. I have no doubt the women will       sit with as much interest behind the bar[6] as though the       original proposition had been carried in the affirmative. All we       asked was an expression of opinion, and, having obtained it, we       shall now act with the utmost cordiality.    Would there have been no unpleasant feelings in Wendell Phillips'  mind, had Frederick Douglass and Robert Purvis been refused their  seats in a convention of reformers under similar circumstances? and,  had _they_ listened one entire day to debates on their peculiar  fitness for plantation life, and unfitness for the forum and public  assemblies, and been rejected as delegates on the ground of color,  could Wendell Phillips have so far mistaken their real feelings, and  been so insensible to the insults offered them, as to have told a  Convention of men who had just trampled on their most sacred rights,  that \"they would no doubt sit with as much interest behind the bar, as  in the Convention\"? To stand in that august assembly and maintain the  unpopular heresy of woman's equality was a severe ordeal for a young  man to pass through, and Wendell Phillips, who accepted the odium of  presenting this question to the Convention, and thus earned the  sincere gratitude of all womankind, might be considered as above  criticism, though he may have failed at one point to understand the  feelings of woman. The fact is important to mention, however, to show  that it is almost impossible for the most liberal of men to  understand what liberty means for woman. This sacrifice of human  rights, by men who had assembled from all quarters of the globe to  proclaim universal emancipation, was offered up in the presence of  such women as Lady Byron, Anna Jameson, Amelia Opie, Mary Howitt,  Elizabeth Fry, and our own Lucretia Mott. The clergy with few  exceptions were bitter in their opposition. Although, as  Abolitionists, they had been compelled to fight both Church and Bible  to prove the black man's right to liberty, conscience forbade them to  stretch those sacred limits far enough to give equal liberty to woman.    The leading men who championed the cause of the measure in the  Convention and voted in the affirmative, were Wendell Phillips, George  Thompson, George Bradburn, Mr. Ashurst, Dr. Bowring, and Henry B.  Stanton. Though Daniel O'Connell was not present during the  discussion, having passed out with the President, yet in his first  speech, he referred to the rejected delegates, paying a beautiful  tribute to woman's influence, and saying he should have been happy to  have added the right word in the right place and to have recorded his  vote in favor of human equality..    William Lloyd Garrison, having been delayed at sea, arrived too late  to take part in the debates. Learning on his arrival that the women  had been rejected as delegates, he declined to take his seat in the  Convention; and, through all those interesting discussions on a  subject so near his heart, lasting ten days, he remained a silent  spectator in the gallery. What a sacrifice for a principle so dimly  seen by the few, and so ignorantly ridiculed by the many! Brave, noble  Garrison! May this one act keep his memory fresh forever in the hearts  of his countrywomen!    The one Abolitionist who sustained Mr. Garrison's position, and sat  with him in the gallery, was Nathaniel P. Rogers, editor of the  _Herald of Freedom_, in Concord, New Hampshire, who died in the midst  of the Anti-Slavery struggle. However, the debates in the Convention  had the effect of rousing English minds to thought on the tyranny of  sex, and American minds to the importance of some definite action  toward woman's emancipation.    As Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton wended their way arm in  arm down Great Queen Street that night, reviewing the exciting scenes  of the day, they agreed to hold a woman's rights convention on their  return to America, as the men to whom they had just listened had  manifested their great need of some education on that question. Thus a  missionary work for the emancipation of woman in \"the land of the  free and the home of the brave\" was then and there inaugurated. As the  ladies were not allowed to speak in the Convention, they kept up a  brisk fire morning, noon, and night at their hotel on the unfortunate  gentlemen who were domiciled at the same house. Mr. Birney, with his  luggage, promptly withdrew after the first encounter, to some more  congenial haven of rest, while the Rev. Nathaniel Colver, from Boston,  who always fortified himself with six eggs well beaten in a large bowl  at breakfast, to the horror of his host and a circle of aesthetic  friends, stood his ground to the last--his physical proportions being  his shield and buckler, and his Bible (with Colver's commentaries) his  weapon of defence.[7]    The movement for woman's suffrage, both in England and America, may be  dated from this World's Anti-Slavery Convention.
