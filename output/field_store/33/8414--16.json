I don't recollect much about it, but I suppose  it must be there.\"    \"That's another thing to see to, then,\" said Roy.  \"Because, if it does  exist, and the enemy heard of it, he might come in and surprise us.  I  know; we'll find it, and block it up.\"    \"Nay, I wouldn't do that, sir.  It might be that we should have to go  away, and it isn't a bad thing to have a way out in case of danger.\"    \"Not likely to do that, Ben,\" said Roy, haughtily.  \"We are going to  hold the place.\"    \"Yes, sir, as long as we can; but we can't do impossibilities.  Now,  sir, will you go and have your bit o' dinner, while I have mine?\"    \"Oh, I don't feel as if I could eat, Ben; I'm too full of excitement.\"    \"More reason why you should go and have your dinner, sir.  Man can't  fight without he eats and drinks.\"    \"Nor a boy, neither--eh, Ben?\"    \"That's so, sir; only I wouldn't be talking before the men about being  only a boy.  You leave them to say it if they like.  But they won't;  they'll judge you by what you do, sir; and if you act like a man,  they'll look at you as being the one in command of them, and behave like  it.\"    \"Very well, I'll go to dinner, and in an hour meet you here.\"    \"Fifty minutes, sir.  It's a good ten minutes since the men went in.\"    Roy joined his mother, feeling, as he said, too full of excitement to  eat; but he found the meal ready, with one of the maids in attendance,  and everything so calm and quiet, that, as they sat chatting, it seemed  as if all this excitement were as unsubstantial as the distant rumours  of war; while, when the meal was at an end, his mother's words tended to  lend some of her calm to his excited brain.    \"I have been hearing of all that you have done, Roy,\" she said.  \"It is  excellent; but do not hurry.  I cannot afford to have you ill.\"    That was a fresh idea, and the consequences of such a trouble too  horrible to be contemplated; but it made Roy determine to take things  more coolly, and in this spirit he went to where the servants were  assembled in the gate-way, and joined his trusty lieutenant, who had  just drawn them up in line.        CHAPTER TEN.    ROY VISITS THE POWDER-MAGAZINE.    \"Now, Ben, what next?\"    \"The thing I've been thinking, sir, is that, little as it be, we must  make the most of our garrison.  It's war time now, and if you'll give  the order I'll march the men to the armoury and serve out the weepuns  and clothes.\"    Roy nodded, gave the word for the men to march, counter-ordered it, at a  hint from Ben, and then, telling them to face right, put himself at  their head, and marched them to the long, low room at once.    Ben began to serve out the buff jerkins and steel caps.    \"Can't stop for no trying on now,\" he said; \"you must do as we used in  the army,--change about till you get them as fits you.\"    This done, the firelocks and bandoleers followed, and, lastly, to each  man a belt and sword.    And all the time the old soldier handed every article to the recipient  with a grave dignity and a solemnity of manner which seemed to say, \"I  am giving treasures to you that I part from with the greatest regret,\"  and he finished with--    \"Now, my lads, look here: it's a great honour to bear arms in the  service of your king, and if you're carrying Sir Granby Royland's arms  you're carrying the king's, so take care of 'em.  A good soldier  wouldn't have a speck of rust on his helmet or his sword; they're as  bright as I can make 'em now, and as sharp, so mind they're always so.  Now go to your new quarters and put 'em on--proper, mind; and your  master, the captain here, will have a parade in an hour's time.\"    The men went off, leaving Roy wondering at the calmness with which he  stood by listening while old Ben talked to the men and kept on referring  to him as \"your master.\"    Ben now turned to him.  \"What do you say, sir?\" he said.  \"Don't you  think we had better go down and see if all's right in the  powder-magazine?\"    \"But it's in the cellar, Ben, and you'd want a light.\"    \"Hardly fair, sir, to call it the cellar.  I believe it's one of the old  dungeons where they used to shut people up in the good old times.\"    \"That would be darker still, Ben.  How are we to see?\"    \"Have to feel, sir; for I don't fancy taking down a lantern.  Once we  get there and the place open, we can go round and tell with our hands  how many kegs there are on the shelves, and then if we bring one out and  try it, and it turns out all right, we shall know we're safe.\"    \"Very well: it isn't a nice job; but, if it has to be done, we'd better  get it over.\"    \"As you say, sir, it aren't a nice job; but, if we're very careful, I  don't see as we can come to much harm; so, if you'll get the keys, sir,  we'll go at once.\"    Roy nodded, and went in without a word, to find his mother seated in the  library writing.    \"What is it, my boy?\" she said.  \"What do you want?\"    Roy hesitated for a moment, and then said, rather huskily, \"The keys.  Ben and I are going down into the magazine.\"    Lady Royland looked at him in a wondering way.    \"The magazine?  Do you mean the store-room?\"    \"No; the powder-magazine.\"    She started now, and looked anxious.    \"I had almost forgotten its existence, Roy.  But is it necessary?  It  may be dangerous to go into such a place.\"    \"We shall take care, mother, and have no light.  It is necessary, Ben  says, for we must be provided with gunpowder, and he wants to try  whether it is good, because it must be very old.\"    \"Very old, my boy.  Probably older than your grandfather's day.  I  hardly like you to go upon such an errand.\"    \"But if I'm to be captain, mother, and look after the place, I can't go  back and tell Ben that.  It would look so weak.\"    \"Yes, yes, of course,\" said Lady Royland, making an effort to be calm  and firm.  \"But you will be very careful, Roy.\"    \"You may trust me, mother,\" he said; and she drew the keys, with a sigh,  from the drawer in the old table, and handed them to her son, who took  them and returned to his lieutenant.    \"Here they are, Ben,\" said Roy, quietly.  \"Ready?\"    \"Yes, sir, I'm ready.  I want to be satisfied about that powder, because  it means so much to us, for I'm sure I don't know how we could get any  more in times like these.  You might send an order to London or one of  the places in Kent where they make it, but I should never expect to see  it come down here.  Well, we won't waste time; so come along.\"    Taking off his sword, and signing to Roy to do the same, he led the way  to the flight of spiral steps in the base of the south-east tower, but,  instead of going up, followed it down to where there was a low arched  door on their left and an opening on their right.    \"Long time since any one's been in that old dungeon, Master Roy.  Hundred years, I dare say.  Maybe we shall be putting some one in, one  of these days!\"    \"In there?  Whom?  What for?\"    \"Prisoners, sir, for fighting against the king.\"  The old fellow  laughed, and went along through the opening on their right, which proved  to be an arched passage very dimly lit by a series of little pipe-like  holes sloping inward through the outer wall of the castle and opening  about a foot above the moat.  On their aft were doors of a row of  cellars built beneath the old court-yard; and as Ben walked onward he  said--    \"Who'd think as there were green grass and flower-beds up above them,  Master Roy?  But we do see changes in this life.  Halt! here we are.\"    He stopped at the end of the passage, where there was a massive oak  door-way facing them beneath a curious old Norman arch, and, after  trying hard with three different keys, the rusty wards of the old lock  allowed one to turn, and the door was pushed wide open, creaking back  against the wall.    \"Rather dark, sir,\" said Ben.  \"Get on a deal better with a candle; but  it wouldn't do.\"    Roy peered in, and, as his eyes grew more accustomed to the obscurity,  he made out that he was gazing into a small stone chamber; but there was  no sign of chest or keg, or door leading onward.    \"Why, the place is empty, Ben,\" said the boy, with a sigh of relief.    \"We don't know that yet, sir, because we haven't seen it,\" said Ben,  quietly.  \"This is only the way to the magazine.  People in the old days  knew what dangerous tackle it was, and took care of it according.  But  it's going to be a dark job, and no mistake.\"    The old soldier stepped in, and, stooping down in the middle of the  blank stone chamber, took hold of a large copper ring and drew up one  side of a heavy flagstone, which turned silently upon copper pivots, and  this flag he laid back till it was supported by the ring.    \"Looks darker down there, sir,\" said Ben, as Roy stood beside him and  they tried to pierce the gloom, but only for the latter to make out the  dim outline of a stone step or two.    \"You've been down here before, of course?\" whispered Roy, as if the  place impressed him.    \"Yes, sir; once.  There's a door at the bottom, and that's the magazine.  It will be all feeling, sir.  Will you go back while I try and get a  keg?\"    \"No,\" said Roy, firmly, but with an intense desire to say yes.  \"I shall  stay while you go down.  There can be no danger if you have no light.\"    \"Unless the rusty key strikes a light, sir.\"    \"Oh, that's impossible,\" whispered Roy.    \"I suppose I'd better pull off my boots before I go down; it'll perhaps  be safer.\"    He seated himself on the floor and pulled them off, Roy standing up,  leaning against the wall, and doing the same.    \"What's that for?\" said Ben.    \"Coming with you.  I want to know what the place is like.\"    \"Oh, there's no need for two of us to go, sir.  One's enough.\"    Roy said nothing, but followed the old fellow down eight stone steps,  and then they stood together against a door, which felt to the touch to  be very strongly made of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25452"],[0,"The Kangaroo Marines (#15)"],[1,"take him back to the Turkish lines.  His cords  cut into his hands and legs; his tongue was parched; his heart beating  at the coming of the dawn.    Still, the light of day brought a certain physical and mental relief.  He was given a drink; his cords were cut, and he was pushed out into  the open and marched off to the Turkish lines.  He stumbled along, in  pain and confused.  But deliverance was at hand.    True to their trust, his faithful Maoris were on the watch.  One lay on  top of the cliffs as a guard for the boat hidden away in the cove  below; the other was a thousand yards ahead, directly in front of the  line of march which two out of the three Turkish soldiers were taking  him.  This Maori's eyes were alert.  A glance made him understand it  all.  Filling his magazine, he lay low.  They were then six hundred  yards away.  Too far for a sure aim.  He waited.  Five hundred.  Four  hundred.  Three hundred.  Yes; that would do.  He settled down and  aimed.    Bang!  The bullet told.  The man on Tony's right dropped dead.  The  subaltern realised the cause.  He let drive with his fist at the other  man.  The Turk stumbled back, recovered, then fled.  But the Maori  nipped him like a farmer does a running hare.  He, too, fell dead.  This was the one with the map which Tony had made.  It was wrenched  from his haversack.    \"Near shave, boss,\" said the Maori corporal, running up.    \"Yes; but come on.\"  They ran towards the cliff.    Bang! went a rifle.   The faithful Maori corporal dropped dead at his  officer's feet.  Tony looked to his front, and there was the third man  of the Turkish patrol coolly aiming at him too.  He ducked just as a  rifle banged.  For a minute he lay flat, and then a strange thing  happened.  The second Maori, on the top of the cliff, unable to sight  his rifle at this assassin of his friend, was charging wildly down on  the Turk with his bayonet fixed.    \"Allah!  Allah!\" shouted the Turk as he turned about and threw up his  arms.  A moment later he was bayoneted to death.    Tony jumped up and ran on, for in the distance he saw other patrols  running towards the scene.  The surviving Maori followed him to the  beach.  The boat was launched, and they pulled out from the shore.  Danger, however, was not passed.  Turkish patrols had found them.  Volley after volley rattled through the air.  They splashed all round;  some hit the boat, one struck Tony in the arm, two more pierced the  oars.  But out and out pulled the plucky pair till, at last, they were  clear of the fire.    \"Hot shop, boss,\" said the Maori.    \"Yes, a bit too hot!\" muttered Tony as he bandaged his bleeding arm.    That night the Chief of Staff received the information desired.  And a  few days later Lieut. Tony Brown added the letters \"D.S.O.\" to his  name.  Everybody said, \"Why?\"  But the Chief of Staff simply smiled and  passed on.          CHAPTER X    VICTORY    Night was falling fast over the Australasian lines.  The darkness was  welcome, for it brought a certain rest and coolness to the thousands of  sun-baked and weary men.  For two days they had slaved like  navvies--digging, sand-bagging, reorganising trenches, improving  communications, and bringing up supplies, Maxims, and ammunition.  It  was not the usual thing.  Indeed, it was most unusual.  Only the Staff  knew why, for this war has taught us that we must not advertise our  coming events.  Of course the Tommies groused.  They always do.  It is  the privilege of the soldier.  And Bill Buster was not behind in this  land of moaning.    \"Thinks I'm an old mule.  Me feet's skinned, me back's skinned, me  heart's skinned carryin' them blessed boxes of crackers.  Oh, why did I  leave me little happy home?\" he exclaimed, wiping the sweat off his  sunburnt brow.    \"Had to--ye frizzly-faced bushwhacker,\" said Paddy.    \"All this means that there's something doing,\" remarked Claud, cleaning  his monocle with a piece of rag.    \"Ay, there's gaun tae be an attack.  Say yer prayers the nicht, boys,\"  added Sandy.    \"Thank God!\" uttered Claud.  \"I'm sick of inaction.  I don't mind  death; but it's a beastly bore waiting to be killed.  One can't quite  regulate supplies.  Now, if to-morrow was the day for our dispatch, we  might have a beano out of our spare biscuits and Woodbines to-night.\"    \"It ain't all beer and skittles, as you say,\" Bill said.  \"Next war I'm  goin' to be a general or a Navy bloke.  Them's the safe jobs.  These  ole Turks have a spite at me.  Think I'm a sort o' runnin' man.\"    \"Let them come!\" Paddy exclaimed.  \"We'd bate the life out of thim.  Teach thim manners, the dirty blaggards!\"    \"Don't be too cocky about that.  We're only hanging on the edge of this  cliff by the skin of our teeth.  The German Staff say they'll push us  into the sea, and you bet they'll have a good try.\"    \"It's a soft snap, if they come.  They can't beat us,\" interjected  Bill, who had all the self-assurance of the Australian born.    \"That's where our boys always err,\" answered Claud.  \"They  underestimate the power of the enemy.  That isn't the thing in war.  It's all very well to be confident, but it's equally important to be  prepared to the last cartridge and bomb.  Pluck's a very good thing,  but pluck without brains is as useless as an engine without coal.  If  these Turks make a big show, they'll give us a run for our money.  Now  I'm going to sleep.\"    Claud wrapped himself in his coat for a snooze.  The others followed  suit, little dreaming what the dawn would bring.  While they slept,  secure in their innocence of things, the General and Chief of Staff sat  keen and anxious in their dug-outs; for the dawn was the time stated  for the attack.  Everything was prepared; still, they had all that  mental worry which only an officer knows.  They smoked and talked--and  talked.  While they passed these anxious hours their subordinate  commanders were quietly filling up the reserve trenches with supporting  troops.  The gunners, too, were busy checking ranges and noting down  the approximate position of the magazines and other stores as supplied  by the map of Tony Brown.  The doctors were also alive.  They were  clearing out the field hospitals preparatory to the gruesome slaughter  ahead.  Out at sea a flotilla of gunboats and destroyers had quietly  arrived and were circling round, waiting for the coming fray.  Everything had been thought of; everything was ready.    \"It's getting light, sir,\" said the chief, looking out of his dug-out  about 3.30 A.M.    \"Very well; 'phone the brigadiers.  Tell them to be prepared for the  bombardment in accordance with our pow-wow of yesterday.\"    \"Very good, sir.\"  The 'phone transmitted the order and the chief sat  down again.    Boom! echoed a gun in the Turkish line.  A shell crashed right over the  General's dug-out.  Tony Brown's information was right.  The battle had  commenced.  A sense of relief spread over the General's face.  His  suspense was at an end.    Boom!  Boom!  Boom! went the other guns.  More shells, more splinters,  and here and there the moan of a dying or wounded man.  But this was  only the preliminary business.  In ten minutes every Turkish gun, from  the giant howitzers to the more simple field pieces, were pounding  shrapnel, common shell, and high explosives into the Australasian  lines.  There was no excitement; the men were used to the game.  They  crouched in holes or hard against the stony sides of the trenches.  Still, the noise was deafening, and the gunners' aim was often good.  Shells burst on the parapets and destroyed them, frequently killing or  burying the men behind.  Others burst above and sent their balls of  death into the heads or backs of the crouching men.  High explosives  crashed with an unnerving boom in and around the trenches, pounding,  killing, and maiming.  Maxims rattled out a hail of lead, rifles  squirted bullets into every corner where a living soul was likely to be  found.  There was no romance in this sort of business.  It was  butchery, blood, anguish, and death.  Hell is the only word that fits  such a bombardment.  Those who read such things sit at home in tears  and terror.  Yet the men who live through them sit calm, even cool, and  often in smiles.    \"Bit hot,\" said Claud, looking at his hat, which had been pierced by a  shrapnel bullet.    Bill ejaculated something unprintable and dropped a hot piece of shell  he had intended to collar as a curio.    \"I weesht I had a hauf o' whisky; this is a dry job,\" said Sandy, as he  cuddled closer against the side of the trench.    \"May ould Allah have mercy on yis when I get yis wid me can-opener!\"  muttered Paddy as he fingered his bayonet.    Boom!  Boom!  Boom! crashed three more shrapnels above them, scattering  lead and iron in all directions.  Old keys, brass fittings, nails, iron  knobs and other things tumbled in, too.    \"Queer shrapnel--eh?\" said Claud, picking up one of these curios--and a  sign that the Turks were surely scarce of the real stuff.    \"Don't mind bullets,\" growled Bill; \"but I objects to them chuckin' an  ironmonger's shop at my ole head.  It ain't nice----\"    Boom!  Boom! came two more.    \"A miss!\" said Sandy, signalling a \"wash-out\" with a shovel.    Boom! crashed another almost overhead.  It was a narrow shave.  Sandy,  with that caution of his clan, resigned the post of marker.  The gods  were favouring this genial quartette, but in many parts of the line men  lay dead, dying, and maimed.  They bore their wounds with a wonderful  patience, and few complained.  Comrades ripped out their field  dressings and staunched the blood.  Doctors, regardless of whizzing  shells and bullets, crept from patient to patient.  Stretcher-bearers  manfully did their job.  Over shell-swept zones they carried and pulled  the wounded to succour and safety.  Despite the danger, men even found  time to note and praise the deeds of these Red Cross heroes.
