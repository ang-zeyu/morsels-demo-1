Under the fingers of Athene grew up  pictures so real and so perfect that the watchers knew not whether the  goddess was indeed creating life. And each picture was one that told  of the omnipotence of the gods and of the doom that came upon those  mortals who had dared in their blasphemous presumption to struggle as  equals with the immortal dwellers in Olympus. Arachne glanced up from  her web and looked with eyes that glowed with the love of beautiful  things at the creations of Athene. Yet, undaunted, her fingers still  sped on, and the goddess saw, with brow that grew yet more clouded,  how the daughter of Idmon the dyer had chosen for subjects the tales  that showed the weaknesses of the gods. One after another the living  pictures grew beneath her hand, and the nymphs held their breath in  mingled fear and ecstasy at Arachne's godlike skill and most arrogant  daring. Between goddess and mortal none could have chosen, for the  colour and form and exquisite fancy of the pictures of the daughter of  Zeus were equalled, though not excelled, by those of the daughter of  the dyer of Colophon.    Darker and yet more dark grew the eyes of Athene as they looked on  the magical beauty of the pictures, each one of which was an insult to  the gods. What picture had skilful hand ever drawn to compare with  that of Europa who,        \"riding on the back of the divine bull, with one hand      clasped the beast's great horn, and with the other      caught up her garment's purple fold, lest it might trail      and be drenched in the hoar sea's infinite spray. And      her deep robe was blown out in the wind, like the sail      of a ship, and lightly ever it wafted the maiden      onward.\"            Moschus.    Then at last did the storm break, and with her shuttle the enraged  goddess smote the web of Arachne, and the fair pictures were rent into  motley rags and ribbons. Furiously, too, with her shuttle of boxwood  she smote Arachne. Before her rage, the nymphs fled back to their  golden river and to the vineyards of Tymolus, and the women of  Colophon in blind terror rushed away. And Arachne, shamed to the dust,  knew that life for her was no longer worth possessing. She had  aspired, in the pride of her splendid genius, to a contest with a god,  and knew now that such a contest must ever be vain. A cord hung from  the weaver's beam, and swiftly she seized it, knotted it round her  white neck, and would have hanged herself. But ere the life had passed  out of her, Athene grasped the cord, loosened it, and spoke Arachne's  doom:    \"Live!\" she said, \"O guilty and shameless one! For evermore shalt thou  live and hang as now, thou and thy descendants, that men may never  forget the punishment of the blasphemous one who dared to rival a  god.\"    Even as she spoke, Arachne's fair form dried up and withered. Her  straight limbs grew grey and crooked and wiry, and her white arms were  no more. And from the beam where the beautiful weaver of Lydia had  been suspended, there hung from a fine grey thread the creature from  which, to this day, there are but few who do not turn with loathing.  Yet still Arachne spins, and still is without a compeer.        \"Not anie damzell, which her vaunteth most      In skilfull knitting of soft silken twyne,      Nor anie weaver, which his worke doth boast      In dieper, in damaske, or in lyne,      Nor anie skil'd in workmanship embost,      Nor anie skil'd in loupes of fingring fine,      Might in their divers cunning ever dare      With this so curious networke to compare.\"            Spenser.    Thus, perhaps, does Arachne have her compensations, and in days that  followed long after the twilight of the gods, did she not gain eternal  honour in the heart of every Scot by the tale of how she saved a  national hero? Kindly, too, are her labours for men as she slays their  mortal enemies, the household flies, and when the peasant--practical,  if not favoured by AEsculapius and Hygeia--runs to raid the loom of  Arachne in order to staunch the quick-flowing blood from the cut hand  of her little child, much more dear to her heart is Arachne the spider  than the unknown Athene.        \"Also in spinners be tokens of divination, and of      knowing what weather shall fall--for oft by weathers      that shall fall, some spin or weave higher or lower.      Also multitude of spinners is token of much      rain.\"            Bartholomew.    The sun has not long enough shown his face to dry up the dew in the  garden, and behold on the little clipped tree of boxwood, a great  marvel! For in and out, and all over its twigs and leaves, Arachne has  woven her web, and on the web the dew has dropped a million diamond  drops. And, suddenly, all the colours in the sky are mirrored  dazzlingly on the grey tapestry of her making. Arachne has come to her  own again.          IDAS AND MARPESSA      By day, while the sun-god drove his chariot in the high heavens and  turned the blue-green AEgean Sea into the semblance of a blazing shield  of brass, Idas and Marpessa sat together in the trees' soft shades, or  walked in shadowy valleys where violets and wild parsley grew, and  where Apollo rarely deigned to come. At eventide, when, in royal  splendour of purple and crimson and gold, Apollo sought his rest in  the western sky, Idas and Marpessa wandered by the seashore watching  the little wavelets softly kissing the pebbles on the beach, or  climbed to the mountain side from whence they could see the first  glimpse of Diana's silver crescent and the twinkling lights of the  Pleiades breaking through the blue canopy of the sky. While Apollo  sought in heaven and on earth the best means to gratify his imperial  whims, Idas, for whom all joys had come to mean but one, sought ever  to be by the side of Marpessa. Shadowy valley, murmuring sea, lonely  mountain side, or garden where grew the purple amaranth and where  roses of pink and amber-yellow and deepest crimson dropped their  radiant petals on the snowy marble paths, all were the same to  Idas--Paradise for him, were Marpessa by his side; without her, dreary  desert.    More beautiful than any flower that grew in the garden was Marpessa.  No music that Apollo's lute could make was as sweet in the ears of  Idas as her dear voice. Its music was ever new to him--a melody to  make his heart more quickly throb. New, too, ever was her beauty. For  him it was always the first time that they met, always the same fresh  ravishment to look in her eyes. And when to Idas came the knowledge  that Marpessa gave him love for love, he had indeed won happiness so  great as to draw upon him the envy of the gods.    \"The course of true love never did run smooth,\" and, like many and  many another father since his day, Evenos, the father of Marpessa, was  bitterly opposed to a match where the bridegroom was rich only in  youth, in health, and in love. His beautiful daughter naturally seemed  to him worthy of something much more high. Thus it was an unhappy day  for Marpessa when, as she sat alone by the fountain which dripped  slowly down on the marble basin, and dreamed of her lover, Idas,  Apollo himself, led by caprice, noiselessly walked through the rose  bushes, whose warm petals dropped at his feet as he passed, and beheld  a maiden more fair than the fairest flower that grew. The hum of bees,  the drip, drip of the fountain, these lulled her mind and heart and  soothed her day-dreams, and Marpessa's red lips, curved like the bow  of Eros, smiled as she thought of Idas, the man she loved. Silently  Apollo watched her. This queen of all the roses was not fit to be the  bride of mortal man--Marpessa must be his.    To Evenos Apollo quickly imparted his desire. He was not used to  having his imperial wishes denied, nor was Evenos anxious to do so.  Here, indeed, was a match for his daughter. No insignificant mortal,  but the radiant sun-god himself! And to Marpessa he told what Apollo  wished, and Marpessa shyly looked at her reflection in the pool of the  fountain, and wondered if she were indeed beautiful enough to win the  love of a god.    \"Am I in truth so wondrous fair?\" she asked her father.    \"Fair enough to mate with Apollo himself!\" proudly answered Evenos.    And joyously Marpessa replied, \"Ah, then am I happy indeed! I would be  beautiful for my Idas' sake!\"    An angry man was her father. There was to be no more pleasant dallying  with Idas in the shadowy wood or by the seashore. In the rose garden  Apollo took his place and charmed Marpessa's ears with his music,  while her eyes could not but be charmed by his beauty. The god had no  doubts or fears. Only a little time he would give her, for a very  little only would he wait, and then undoubtedly this mortal maiden  would be his, her heart conquered as assuredly as the rays from his  chariot conquered the roses, whose warm crimson petals they strewed at  his feet. Yet as Marpessa looked and listened, her thoughts were often  far away and always her heart was with Idas. When Apollo played most  exquisitely to her it seemed that he put her love for Idas into music.  When he spoke to her of his love she thought, \"Thus, and thus did Idas  speak,\" and a sudden memory of the human lad's halting words brought  to her heart a little gush of tenderness, and made her eyes sparkle  so that Apollo gladly thought, \"Soon she will be mine.\"    [Illustration: MARPESSA SAT ALONE BY THE FOUNTAIN]    And all this while Idas schemed and plotted and planned a way in which  he could save his dear one from her obdurate father, and from the  passion of a god. He went to Neptune, told his tale, and begged him to  lend him a winged chariot in which he could fly away with Marpessa.  Neptune good-naturedly consented, and when Idas flew up from the  seashore one day, like a great bird that the tempests have blown  inland, Marpessa joyously sprang up beside her lover, and swiftly they  took flight for a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22694"],[0,"The International Magazine, Volume 2, No. 2, January, 1851 (#15)"],[1,"of  all beholders. Besides the grand beadle, there are several minor ones,  dressed in black, but wearing heavy silver chains; _gens d'armes_ also  are always present, and often soldiers, who mount guard, musket in hand,  at all the doorways, and on the steps of the chancel.    When these sapient guardians of the peace perceive that as many have  been admitted as can possibly be squeezed into the building, they shut  the doors; and the process of distribution goes on until the mass is  equalized throughout the edifice; a task of no small difficulty, as the  portions of the building contiguous to the doors are always densely  packed at an early period, so that the greater number have to pass  through these crowded centres to gain the remoter parts of the church.  Meantime people chat, and look about them, amusing themselves as they  best can; and the sonorous edifice echoes with the footsteps of the  moving mass. But at length the noise subsides; the \"organ utters its  voices,\" and a hush, intense, unbroken, falls on the vast assembly. The  glorious music peals through the vaulted aisles, and swells upward to  the arching roof, pervading every nook and corner of the fane; and so  perfect is the stillness that one would think the winged notes the only  living things within its precincts.    On Friday last this annual solemnity was celebrated as usual at St.  Eustache; the mass, composed by Adam, a very noble and beautiful  composition, was admirably executed by a choir of two hundred and fifty  singers, and a band of one hundred musicians, including the whole  orchestra of the _Opera Comique_, and the best performers from the  Italian opera. The solos were sung by Mesdames Grimm and Couraud, and by  Bassine and Chapuis, the latter being one of the best tenors in the  city. Some of the quartettes, with accompaniments of harps and wind  instruments, were indescribably beautiful.    The Archbishop of Paris made an elegant little address, in which he  spoke of art in Pagan and in Christian days, and of its mission in the  present; and winding up with an appeal to the liberality of his hearers  on behalf of the charitable idea which had prompted this performance.  The Archbishop is a man of mild and grave countenance, but his dress was  very inharmonious. He wore a surplice of very rich lace, a cape of  violet silk, and a scarf richly embroidered in gold, which was all very  pretty, but his arms and hands were encased in sleeves, finished with  gloves, of scarlet cloth, which showed through the lace sleeves of the  surplice, and gave the hands a very frightful appearance. He wore a  little round cap on the top of his head, a golden crucifix on his bosom,  and an enormous gold ring on his right hand. He spoke very slowly,  screaming rather than speaking, in order to make himself heard in the  distant parts of the building. The service lasted two hours, and yielded  several thousand francs.    The Duchess of Narbonne, famed for her benevolence, was so desirous to  aid on this occasion, that though unable, on account of her great age,  to go among the crowd _making the guest_, as it is termed, she held a  bag at one of the great doors, adding to the sum she thus received, a  thousand francs as her own contribution, and a hundred francs for her  chair, for which the ordinary price is two sous.    The musicians are not alone in their preparations for winter. The  shopkeepers are just beginning the periodic display which betokens the  coming on of the holidays: and conspicuous among the novelties whose  appearance thus indicate the approach of Christmas, is a new style of  porcelain, of English invention, which imitates with great success the  antique marble vases, pitchers, &c., of classic days. Many of these  objects are of great beauty; the creamy hue of the ware itself, slightly  translucent, the graceful simplicity of their forms, and the delicate  mouldings of classical designs in bass-relief with which they are  adorned, producing an admirable effect, highly creditable to English  taste.    While modern art is thus successfully emulating the symmetrical  achievements of ancient times, a relic of great interest, recalling the  romantic age of Spanish history, has just been unexpectedly brought to  light. Some workmen, employed in making repairs in the Guildhall of  Burgos, in Spain, have recently discovered the tomb of the Cid, so  renowned in ancient story; a tomb whose very existence was unknown. An  old chest, long considered as mere rubbish, and on which stood the  antique chair from which, in other days, the Counts of Castille gave  judgment, having been opened through the curiosity of these workmen, was  found to contain the remains of Don Rodrigo Campeador, and his wife  Chimena, immortalized in ancient legend, in the verses of Guilhen de  Castro, of Corneille, and in our own days, in the graceful writings of  Mrs. Hemans. The remains of the renowned hero and his beautiful spouse  are to be removed to the church of San Gadeo, where a suitable monument  will be erected to their memory.    The following incident, connected with the two prevailing manias of the  day, lapdogs and balloon-ascensions, is just now amusing the gay circles  of this gossiping capital.    It seems that Madame de N., the accomplished and beautiful wife of a  triple millionaire of the quartier St. Honore, equally renowned for the  charms of her wit, and for the intensity of her passion for the barking  pets so dear to Parisian hearts, had taken a violent fancy (shared by  half Paris) to a certain tiny gray spaniel, the property of one of the  most admired of the innumerable representatives of Albion at this time  here congregated, the beautiful and distinguished Lady R., whose  intimacy was assiduously cultivated by Madame de N., all for the love of  the little gray spaniel.    Sylphide, the spaniel in question, was in sooth well calculated to make  havoc in hearts susceptible to canine charms. Her glossy fur, combed,  bathed, and perfumed every day with the utmost care, was of the most  delicate mouse-color, and softer than silk; her lustrous eyes sparkled  like jewels, and her expressive face, with the delicate drooping ears  that adorned her graceful head, were the realization of the most ideal  dream of little-doggish beauty; her tail was perfection; her slender  legs, in their light electric movements, hardly touched the ground; and  the dainty way in which she raised her charming little paws from the  sidewalk, when, by some rare chance (attired in her newest paletot of  the finest merino, lined with wadded silk, and trimmed with a rich  braid, her neck encircled with a silver collar, whose burnished chain  was attached to her mistress's waist), she honored the sidewalk with  their pressure, was so irresistibly bewitching, that all the fair round  arms of Paris opened spontaneously at the sight, as though to offer a  nestling-place to the little beauty, and raise her from a contact  unworthy of so peerless a creature.    Any price, no matter how exorbitant, that could have been asked for this  little paragon, Madame de N. would very gladly have paid; but,  unhappily, Sylphide was not to be sold: Lady R. was very fond of her,  and never seemed to understand the various hints thrown out from time to  time, with the utmost tact and delicacy, but still quite intelligibly,  by Madame de N.; and all that the latter could do was to bring her  utmost power of petting to bear on the subject of her adoration,  trusting to some unlooked-for stroke of good fortune to aid her in the  accomplishment of her heart's desire.    Sylphide was excessively fond of sugar-plums (in which she was a great  connoisseur), and also of fresh _brioche_, crumbs of which she would  eat, in the most charming manner, from the snowy hand of her admiring  friend; and as the _bonbonniere_ of Madame de N. was always well  supplied with her favorite dainties, Sylphide, who, on her side, was not  ungrateful, soon contracted a lively affection for Madame de N. and her  bonbonniere.    Such was the position of affairs, when an incident occurred which  produced a total estrangement between the two ladies. M. de S., a  gentleman well known in the diplomatic circles, whom Madame de N. had  long numbered among her conquests, fascinated by the charms of the fair  islander, deserted his brilliant countrywoman, and ranged himself among  the satellites of her rival. And by a curious coincidence, at the very  time that M. de S. quitted thus abruptly the orbit of Madame de N., the  Prince of ----, who had hitherto been one of the brightest luminaries in  the train of Lady R., left her ladyship to lay his homage at the feet of  the charming Parisian. But the acquisition of the Prince seems to have  failed to console the latter for the loss of a knight who had so long  worn her colors; and the defection of M. de S. drew from her an  expression of resentment towards her rival, which the mutual friend to  whom these angry feelings had been confided, lost no time in repeating  to the object of her displeasure. But Lady R., so far from being  affected by the indignation of Madame de N., merely replied, with a  careless shrug of her handsome shoulders, \"_Mais, ma chere_, she has  really nothing to complain of; all the world knows that '_exchange is no  robbery_!'\"    At this time a magnificent bracelet, the latest achievement of the  wonder-working _ateliers_ of Froment & Meurice, had been the object of  Lady R.'s most violent desire; but her lord, who was subject to  occasional attacks of a malady not uncommon to the husbands of beautiful  and fashionable ladies, was just then suffering from an attack of  jealousy so acute, that, to the despair of Lady R., he utterly refused  to gratify her desire to become the possessor of this costly ornament;  and the lady, after having vainly called to her aid all the force of her  address, and all the charms of her eloquence, found herself obliged,"]]]
