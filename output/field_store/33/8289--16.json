She gave this priest money to  purchase a cow, to be presented to the priests in the name of her  deceased son, and to distribute in charity to the poor and to holy  men. She got from us for these purposes eighty rupees over and above  her son's share of the booty, while his widow and children continued  to receive their usual share of the takings of the gang so long as  they remained with us.\"        12. Taking the omens.      Before setting out on an expedition it was their regular custom  to take the omens, and the following account may be quoted of the  preliminaries to an expedition of the great leader, Meherban Singh,  who has already been mentioned: \"In the latter end of that year,  Meherban and his brother set out and assembled their friends on the  bank of the Bisori river, where the rate at which each member of the  party should share in the spoil was determined in order to secure to  the dependants of any one who should fall in the enterprise their due  share, as well as to prevent inconvenient disputes during and after  the expedition. The party assembled on this occasion, including women  and children, amounted to two hundred, and when the shares had been  determined the goats were sacrificed for the feast. Each leader and  member of the gang dipped his finger in the blood and swore fidelity  to his engagements and his associates under all circumstances. The  whole feasted together and drank freely till the next evening, when  Meherban advanced with about twenty of the principal persons to a spot  chosen a little way from the camp on the road they proposed to take in  the expedition, and lifting up his hands in supplication said aloud,  'If it be thy will, O God, and thine, Kali, to prosper our undertaking  for the sake of the blind and the lame, _the widow and the orphan_,  who depend upon our exertions for subsistence, vouchsafe, we pray thee,  the call of the female jackal.' All his followers held up their hands  in the same manner and repeated these words after him. All then sat  down and waited in silence for the reply or spoke only in whispers. At  last the cry of the female jackal was heard three times on the left,  and believing her to have been inspired by the deity for their guidance  they were all much rejoiced.\" The following was another more elaborate  method of taking omens described by Ajit Singh: \"When we speak of  seeking omens from our gods or Devi Deota, we mean the spirits of those  of our ancestors who performed great exploits in dacoity in their day,  gained a great name and established lasting reputations. For instance,  Mahajit, my grandfather, and Sahiba, his father, are called gods  and admitted to be so by us all. We have all of us some such gods  to be proud of among our ancestors; we propitiate them and ask for  favourable omens from them before we enter upon any enterprise. We  sometimes propitiate the Suraj Deota (sun god) and seek good omens  from him. We get two or three goats or rams, and sometimes even ten  or eleven, at the place where we determine to take the auspices, and  having assembled the principal men of the gang we put water into the  mouth of one of them and pray to the sun and to our ancestors thus:  'O thou Sun God! And O all ye other Gods! If we are to succeed in  the enterprise we are about to undertake we pray you to cause these  goats to shake their bodies.' If they do not shake them after the  gods have been thus duly invoked, the enterprise must not be entered  upon and the goats are not sacrificed. We then try the auspices with  wheat. We burn frankincense and scented wood and blow a shell; and  taking out a pinch of wheat grains, put them on the cloth and count  them. If they come up odd the omen is favourable, and if even it is  bad. After this, which we call the auspices of the Akut, we take that  of the Siarni or female jackal. If it calls on the left it is good,  but if on the right bad. If the omens turn out favourable in all three  trials then we have no fear whatever, but if they are favourable in  only one trial out of the three the enterprise must be given up.\"        13. Suppression of dacoity.      Between 1837 and 1849 the suppression of the regular practice of  armed dacoity was practically achieved by Colonel Sleeman. A number  of officers were placed under his orders, and with small bodies of  military and police were set to hunt down different bands of dacoits,  following them all over India when necessary. And special Acts were  passed to enable the offence of dacoity, wherever committed, to be  tried by a competent magistrate in any part of India as had been done  in the case of the Thugs. Many of the Badhaks received conditional  pardons, and were drafted into the police in different stations, and  an agricultural labour colony was also formed, but does not seem to  have been altogether successful. During these twelve years more than  1200 dacoits in all were brought to trial, while some were killed  during the operations, and no doubt many others escaped and took to  other avocations, or became ordinary criminals when their armed gangs  were broken up. In 1825 it had been estimated that the Oudh forests  alone contained from 4000 to 6000 dacoits, while the property stolen  in 1811 from known dacoities was valued at ten lakhs of rupees.        14. The Badhaks or Baoris at the present time.      The Badhaks still exist, and are well known as one of the worst classes  of criminals, practising ordinary house-breaking and theft. The name  Badhak is now less commonly used than those of Bagri and Baori or  Bawaria, both of which were borne by the original Badhaks. The word  Bagri is derived from a tract of country in Malwa which is known  as the Bagar or 'hedge of thorns,' because it is surrounded on all  sides by wooded hills. [64] There are Bagri Jats and Bagri Rajputs,  many of whom are now highly respectable landholders. Bawaria or  Baori is derived from _banwar_, a creeper, or the tendril of a vine,  and hence a noose made originally from some fibrous plant and used  for trapping animals, this being one of the primary occupations of  the tribe. [65] The term Badhak signifies a hunter or fowler, hence  a robber or murderer (Platts). The Bagris and Bawarias are sometimes  considered to be separate communities, but it is doubtful whether there  is any real distinction between them. In Bombay the Bagris are known  as Vaghris by the common change of _b_ into _v_. A good description  of them is contained in Appendix C to Mr. Bhimbhai Kirparam's volume  _Hindus of Gujarat_ in the _Bombay Gazetteer_. He divides them into the  Chunaria or lime-burners, the Datonia or sellers of twig tooth-brushes,  and two other groups, and states that, \"They also keep fowls and sell  eggs, catch birds and go as _shikaris_ or hunters. They traffic in  green parrots, which they buy from Bhils and sell for a profit.\"        15. Lizard-hunting.      Their strength and powers of endurance are great, the same writer  states, and they consider that these qualities are obtained by the  eating of the _goh_ and _sandha_ or iguana lizards, which a Vaghri  prizes very highly. This is also the case with the Bawarias of the  Punjab, who go out hunting lizards in the rains and may be seen  returning with baskets full of live lizards, which exist for days  without food and are killed and eaten fresh by degrees. Their method  of hunting the lizard is described by Mr. Wilson as follows: [66]  \"The lizard lives on grass, cannot bite severely, and is sluggish  in his movements, so that he is easily caught. He digs a hole for  himself of no great depth, and the easiest way to take him is to  look out for the scarcely perceptible airhole and dig him out; but  there are various ways of saving oneself this trouble. One, which I  have seen, takes advantage of a habit the lizard has in cold weather  (when he never comes out of his hole) of coming to the mouth for  air and warmth. The Chuhra or other sportsman puts off his shoes and  steals along the prairie till he sees signs of a lizard's hole. This  he approaches on tiptoe, raising over his head with both hands a  mallet with a round sharp point, and fixing his eyes intently upon  the hole. When close enough he brings down his mallet with all his  might on the ground just behind the mouth of the hole, and is often  successful in breaking the lizard's back before he awakes to a sense  of his danger. Another plan, which I have not seen, is to tie a wisp  of grass to a long stick and move it over the hole so as to make a  rustling noise. The lizard within thinks, 'Oh here's a snake! I may  as well give in,' and comes to the mouth of the hole, putting out  his tail first so that he may not see his executioner. The sportsman  seizes his tail and snatches him out before he has time to learn his  mistake.\" This common fondness for lizards is a point in favour of  a connection between the Gujarat Vaghris and the Punjab Bawarias.        16. Social observances.      In Sirsa the great mass of the Bawarias are not given to crime,  and in Gujarat also they do not appear to have special criminal  tendencies. It is a curious point, however, that Mr. Bhimbhai Kirparam  emphasises the chastity of the women of the Gujarat Vaghris. [67]  \"When a family returns home after a money-making tour to Bombay  or some other city, the women are taken before Vihat (Devi), and  with the women is brought a buffalo or a sheep that is tethered in  front of Vihat's shrine. They must confess all, even their slightest  shortcomings, such as the following: 'Two weeks ago, when begging in  Parsi Bazar-street, a drunken sailor caught me by the hand. Another  day a Miyan or Musalman ogled me, and forgive me, Devi, my looks  encouraged him.' If Devi is satisfied the sheep or buffalo shivers,  and is then sacrificed and provides a feast for the caste.\" [68]  On the other hand, Mr. Crooke states ["]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22042"],[0,"Christmas: Its Origin and Associations (#15)"],[1,"influence  on the rising liberties of the people, and has endured to our own  times. It is not surprising, therefore, that the adoption of this  measure by the great Earl of Leicester invested his memory with a  lustre which has not been dimmed by the lapse of centuries. The  paltering of the king called forth the patriotism of the people. \"So  may a glory from defect arise.\" The sevenfold lustre of the rainbow is  only seen when there is rain as well as sun.     \"Only the prism's obstruction shows aright    The secret of a sunbeam, breaks its light    Into the jewelled bow from blankest white;      So may a glory from defect arise.\"[19]    [Illustration]      THE DEATH OF ROBIN HOOD ON CHRISTMAS EVE.    The famous freebooter, Robin Hood, who, according to tradition,  flourished in Sherwood Forest in the distracted reign of Henry the  Third, is said to have died on Christmas Eve, in the year 1247. The  career of this hero of many popular ballads is not part of our  subject, though Hone[20] records his death as a Christmas event; and  Stowe, writing in 1590, evidently believes in Robin Hood as an  historical personage, for he says, \"he suffered no woman to be  oppressed ... poor men's goods he spared, abundantly relieving them  with that which by theft he got from the abbeys, and the houses of  rich old earles.\"    From the doubtful doings of the romantic chief and his band of  freebooters, we now pass on to the      REIGN OF EDWARD THE FIRST.    [Illustration]    Edward the First was in the truest sense a national king. He was  English to the core, and he won the love of his people by his bravery,  justice, and good government. He joined freely in the national sports  and pastimes, and kept the Christmas festival with great splendour.  There was much of the chivalric in his character, and he shared to the  full his people's love of hard fighting. He was invested with the  honour of knighthood and went to foreign courts to display his  prowess. Matthew of Westminster states that while Edward was  travelling in France, he heard that a lord of Burgundy was continually  committing outrages on the persons and property of his neighbours. In  the true spirit of chivalry Edward attacked the castle of the  uncourteous baron. His prowess asserted the cause of justice, and he  bestowed the domains which he had won upon a nobler lord. For the sake  of acquiring military fame he exposed himself to great dangers in the  Holy Land, and, during his journey homeward, saved his life by sheer  fighting in a tournament at Challon. At his \"Round Table of  Kenilworth\" a hundred lords and ladies \"clad all in silk\" renewed the  faded glories of Arthur's Court, and kept Christmas with great  magnificence. In 1277, Llewellyn, Prince of Wales, bidden from his  mountain fastnesses \"with a kiss of peace,\" sat a guest at the  Christmas feast of Edward, but he was soon to fall the last defender  of his weeping country's independence in unequal battle with the  English King. In 1281-2, Edward kept his feast of Christmas at  Worcester, and there was \"such a frost and snow as no man living could  remember the like.\" Rivers were frozen over, even including the Thames  and Severn; fish in ponds, and birds in woods died for want of food;  and on the breaking up of the ice five of the arches of old London  bridge were carried away by the stream, and the like happened to many  other bridges. In 1286 Edward kept his Christmas at Oxford, but the  honour was accompanied by an unpleasant episode in the hanging of the  Mayor by the King's command. In 1290, 1292, and 1303, Edward the  First kept Royal Christmases in the great hall at Westminster. On  his way to Scotland, in the year 1299, the King witnessed the  Christmas ceremonial of the Boy Bishop. He permitted one of the  boy bishops to say vespers before him in his chapel at Heton, near  Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and made a present to the performers of forty  shillings, no inconsiderable sum in those days. During his Scotch  wars, in 1301, Edward, on the approach of winter, took up his quarters  in Linlithgow, where he built a castle and kept his Christmas; and  during his reign he celebrated the festival at other places not  usually so honoured--namely, Bury, Ipswich, Bristol, Berwick,  Carlisle, and Lincoln.      EDWARD THE SECOND    succeeded his father in 1307, being the fourth son of Edward I. and  Eleanor of Castile. He took great delight in the Christmas revels and  expended large sums of money in the entertainment of his court  favourites. In 1311 he kept his Christmas at York, rejoicing in the  presence of Piers Gaveston, whom he had recalled from banishment in  utter disregard of advice given to him by his father (Edward I.) on  his death-bed. Edward II. kept his Christmas in the great hall at  Westminster in 1317, when, however, few nobles were present, \"because  of discord betwixt them and the King;\" but in 1320 the Royal Christmas  was kept at Westminster \"with great honour and glorie.\" In 1324-5 the  King's Christmas was sumptuously observed at Nottingham, but the  following year found Edward a prisoner at Kenilworth, while his wife,  who had successfully intrigued with Roger Mortimer, leader of the  Barons, observed the Christmas festivities with her son at  Wallingford, glad at the downfall of her husband. Edward was an  irresolute and weak-minded king. He displayed singular incapacity for  government, wasting almost all his time in frivolous amusements. The  chief characteristics of his reign were defeat and disgrace abroad,  and misrule ending in misery at home. Instead of following the example  of his noble father, Edward I., who has been deservedly styled \"the  greatest of the Plantagenets,\" he proved himself the weakest of that  line of kings, spending his time in such trifling diversions as \"cross  and pile,\" a game of chance with coins. He was so utterly devoid of  self-respect that he even borrowed money of his barber to carry on  this frivolous pastime, such items as the following being found in his  wardrobe rolls:--\"Item, paid to Henry, the king's barber, for money  which he lent the king to play at cross and pile, five shillings.  Item, paid to Pires Barnard, usher of the king's chamber, money which  he lent the king, and which he lost at cross and pile; to Monsieur  Robert Wattewille eightpence.\" At length the barons, tired of  Edward's misgovernment, revolted, and made the king a prisoner. During  the Christmas festival of 1326, Edward was imprisoned in Kenilworth  Castle. While there he was informed that in a Parliament held at  Westminster, during Christmas 1326-7, he was deposed, and his son  Edward, then only fourteen years of age, elected in his stead. On the  21st of September in the same year Edward II. ended his miserable  career in Berkeley Castle, being, it is supposed, cruelly murdered by  his keepers.      EDWARD THE THIRD'S CORONATION    festivities were a sumptuous enlargement of the Christmas celebration,  which usually extended over Twelfth Night. It is said that the  banqueting cost the equivalent of forty thousand pounds of our money;  and before the young king there appeared quite a multitude of  minstrels, mimics, and gleemen. Professor Henry Morley[21] gives a  specimen of the metrical romances which were translated from the  French for recitation at the royal and noble banquets of this period.  They were \"busy with action, and told with a lively freedom;\" and, in  the one quoted, \"The Fabliau of Sir Cleges,\" we catch some interesting  references to the celebration of Christmas:--     \"Every year Sir Cleges would    At Christmas a great feast hold      In worship of that day,    As royal in alle thing    As he hadde been a king      For sooth as I you say.    Rich and poor in the country about    Should be there withouten doubt;      There would no man say nay.    Minstrels would not be behind,    For there they might most mirthes find      There would they be aye.     \"Minstrels when the feast was done    Withouten giftes should not gon,      And that both rich and good:    Horse, robes and riche ring,    Gold, silver, and other thing,      To mend with their mood.    Ten yeare such feast be held,    In the worship of Mary mild      And for Him that died on the rood.    By that his good began to slake    For the great feasts that he did make.      The knight gentil of blood.\"      \"KEPE OPEN COURT\" AT CHRISTMAS.    Froissart, in Cap. XIIII. of his \"Chronicles,\"[22] gives the  following account of the Christmas Celebration at which Edward the  Third was crowned:--    \"After that the most part of the company of Heynaulte were departed,  and syr John Heynaulte lorde of Beamonde taryed, the Quene gave leve  to her people to departe, savynge a certayne noble knightis the whiche  she kept styl about her and her s[=o]ne, to counsell them, and  commaunded all them that departed, to be at London the next Christmas,  for as than she was determyned to kepe open court, and all they  promysed her so to do.
