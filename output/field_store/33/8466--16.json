She advanced calmly to       the front of the platform, and courtesied very gracefully to       the audience. There was a moment of pause, and the assembly       anxiously listened for the first notes. They were quite       sufficient. The amazing power of the voice, the flexibility,       and the ease of execution, took the hearers by surprise; and       the singer was hardly allowed to finish the verse, ere she       was greeted with the most enthusiastic plaudits, which       continued for some time. The higher passages of the air were       given with clearness and fulness, indicating a soprano voice       of great power. The song was encored; and Miss Greenfield       came back, took her seat at the piano, and began, to the       astonishment of the audience, a different air in a deep and       very clear bass or baritone voice, which she maintained       throughout, without any very great appearance of effort, or       without any breaking. She can, in fact, go as low as       Lablache, and as high as Jenny Lind,--a power of voice       perfectly astonishing. It is said she can strike thirty-one       full, clear notes; and we could readily believe it.\"    From a Brattleborough (Vt.) paper, June 23, 1852:--         \"The 'Black Swan,' or Miss Elizabeth Greenfield, sang in Mr.       Fisk's beautiful new hall on Wednesday evening last to a       large and intelligent audience.         \"We had seen frequent notices in our exchanges, and were       already prepossessed in favor of the abilities and life       purposes of our sable sister; but, after all, we must say       that our expectations of her success are greater than before       we had heard her sing, and conversed with her in her own       private room. She is not pretty, but plain: ... still she is       gifted with a beauty of soul which makes her countenance       agreeable in conversation; and in singing, especially when       her social nature is called into activity, there is a grace       and beauty in her manner which soon make those unaccustomed       to her race forget all but the melody....         \"Nature has done more for Miss Greenfield than any musical       prodigy we have met, and art has marred her execution less.\"    But the limits of this book are such as to preclude my giving all or  even a hundredth part of the testimonials and criticisms touching the  singing of this remarkable performer, that filled the public journals  during her career in the United States. I believe, however, that I  have given quite enough to show that her noble gifts of voice, and  beauty of execution, were of the rarest excellence, while in some  notable respects they had never been equalled. Let it suffice to say  also, in regard to the excerpts given, that they are but fair samples  and reflections of the opinions entertained and expressed by the  press, and by music-loving, cultured people, everywhere Miss  Greenfield appeared.    After singing in nearly all the free States, she resolved to carry out  her long-entertained purpose of visiting Europe, in order to perfect  herself in the _technique_ of her art. Learning of her intentions, the  citizens of Buffalo, N.Y., united in tendering her a grand testimonial  and benefit concert. The invitation was couched in terms most  flattering, and signed by many of the most distinguished residents.    The concert took place on March 7, 1853, and was in all respects a  grand success.    Leaving Buffalo, she went to New York, where, after singing before an  audience of four thousand persons, she received the following  complimentary note:--         NEW YORK, April 2, 1853.         MISS ELIZABETH T. GREENFIELD.         _Madam_,--By the suggestion of many enthusiastic admirers of       your talents, I have been induced to address you on the       subject of another and second concert, prior to your       departure for Europe.         Your advent musical in \"Gotham\" has not been idly heralded       among the true lovers of song, and admirers of exalted       genius, of which your unprecedented success on Wednesday       evening must have sufficiently convinced you; while all are       eloquent in the commendation of your superior powers and       engaging method.         Confiding, madam, in your reported magnanimity and       generosity to oblige, I will divest myself of tedious       circumlocution, and fervently exhort you to make a second       exhibition of your skill; which, there can be no doubt, will       be highly successful to you, and as interesting to your       admirers.         THE PUBLIC.                *       *       *       *       *         \"Miss Greenfield embarked from New York in a British steamer       for England, April 6, 1853; and arrived in Liverpool the       16th of April, 1853; rested over the sabbath, and proceeded       Monday morning to London, in which metropolis she became       safely domiciled on the evening of the same day.         \"But painful trials awaited her from a quarter the most       unexpected. The individual with whom she had drawn up the       contract for this musical tour was unfaithful to his       promises; and she found herself abandoned, without money and       without friends, in a strange country.         \"She had been told Lord Shaftesbury was one of the great       good men of England; and she resolved to call upon him in       person, and entreat an interview. His lordship immediately       granted her request, listened patiently to her history, and       directly gave her a letter of introduction to his lawyer.         \"It may perhaps be considered a providential concurrence       that Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe was in London this same time       with Miss Greenfield. We notice in her 'Sunny Memories,'       under the date of May 6, the following remarks: 'A good many       calls this morning. Among others came Miss Greenfield, the       (so-called) \"Black Swan.\" She appears to be a gentle,       amiable, and interesting young person. She has a most       astonishing voice. C. sat down to the piano, and played       while she sang. Her voice runs through a compass of three       octaves and a fourth. This is four notes more than       Malibran's. She sings a most magnificent tenor, with such a       breadth and volume of sound, that, with your back turned,       you could not imagine it to be a woman. While she was there,       Mrs. S.C. Hall, of the \"Irish Sketches,\" was announced. I       told her of Miss Greenfield; and she took great interest in       her, and requested her to sing something for her. C. played       the accompaniment, and she sang \"Old Folks at Home,\" first       in a soprano voice, and then in a tenor, or baritone. Mrs.       Hall was amazed and delighted, and entered at once into her       cause. She said she would call with me, and present her to       Sir George Smart, who is at the head of the Queen's musical       establishment, and, of course, the acknowledged leader of       London musical judgment.         \"'In the course of the day I had a note from Mrs. Hall,       saying, that, as Sir George Smart was about leaving town,       she had not waited for me, but had taken Miss Greenfield to       him herself. She writes that he was really astonished and       charmed at the wonderful weight, compass, and power of her       voice. He was also as well pleased with the mind in her       singing, and her quickness in doing and catching all that he       told her. Should she have a public opportunity to perform,       he offered to hear her rehearse beforehand. Mrs. Hall says,       \"This is a great deal for him, whose hours are all marked       with gold.\"'         \"Again Mrs. Stowe says, 'To-day the Duchess of Sutherland       called with the Duchess of Argyle. Miss Greenfield happened       to be present; and I begged leave to present her, giving a       slight sketch of her history. I was pleased with the kind       and easy affability with which the Duchess of Sutherland       conversed with her, betraying by no inflection of voice, and       nothing in her air or manner, the great lady talking with       the poor girl. She asked all her questions with as much       delicacy, and made her request to hear her sing with as much       consideration and politeness, as if she had been addressing       any one in her own circle. She seemed much pleased with her       singing, and remarked that she should be happy to give her       an opportunity of performing in Stafford House, as soon as       she should be a little relieved of a heavy cold which seemed       to oppress her at present. This, of course, will be decisive       of her favor in London. The duchess is to let us know when       the arrangement is completed.         \"'I never so fully realized,' continues Mrs. Stowe, 'that       there really is no natural prejudice against color in the       human mind. Miss Greenfield is a dark mulattress, of a       pleasing and gentle face, though by no means handsome. She       is short and thick-set, with a chest of great amplitude, as       one would think on hearing her tenor. I have never seen, in       any of the persons to whom I have presented her, the least       indications of suppressed surprise or disgust, any more than       we should exhibit on the reception of a dark-complexioned       Spaniard or Portuguese.         \"'Miss Greenfield bears her success with much quietness and       good sense.'         \"Her Grace the Duchess of Sutherland afterward"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28057"],[0,"Highways and Byways in Surrey (#15)"],[1,"ars. The battles over Farnham Castle we have seen.  Guildford Castle was not thought worth holding. Surrey gentlemen and  Surrey towns had been as backward as the rest of England in supplying  Charles with his ship-money; but during the whole of the war not a shot  was fired within hearing of the county capital. There was a question of  safeguarding the powdermills at Chilworth, and these were secured for  the Parliamentary Army. Otherwise, Guildford heard nothing more of the  war than the rattle of accoutrements; there were a few levies stationed  in the town, and a troop or two of horse rode through it. Perhaps  Guildford's unhappiest memory of war is an echo of Sedgmoor, forty years  later. The Duke of Monmouth, leaving his colliers and ploughmen to do  their best against the King's cannon, had ridden off the field into  Hampshire, turned his horse loose at Cranbourne Chase, and tried to hide  himself in some rough ground near Ringwood. Lord Lumley and Sir William  Portman were after him with the Militia; there was a reward of five  thousand pounds on his head, and for a day and a night he was hunted  through undergrowth and standing crops. Dogs were run through the high  oats and peas, and except oats and peas he had nothing to eat. He was  caught in the morning, shivering and grey-bearded, in a ditch; two days  later, he was on his way from Ringwood to London, his coach guarded by  strong bodies of troops, and sitting opposite him in the coach an  officer whose orders were to stab him if there was an attempt at rescue.  So they rode into Guildford on a Saturday afternoon, and that night the  terrified prisoner lay under the roof of Abbot's Hospital. Perhaps he  slept; perhaps he could only stride about the room feverishly scribbling  letters of abject entreaty to the King and the great courtiers; staring  wild-eyed at the early July sunlight beyond the hospital chimneys, and  wondering whether he should see another Sunday dawn. It was his last; on  the Wednesday morning his head was hacked from his shoulders.    Abbot's Hospital has pleasanter memories. Foremost must be the memory of  its founder, Guildford's greatest citizen, the stern, kindly old  Archbishop Abbot, son of a poor clothworker of the town, scholar of  Balliol College, Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University, and predecessor  to Laud in the See of Canterbury. It was a great career, and, according  to an old family story, it had a curious beginning. Aubrey gives this  version:--        \"His mother, when she was with child of him, dreamt, that if she      should eat a _Jack_ or _Pike_, her son in her womb would be a great      man, upon this she was indefatigable to satisfy her longing, as well      as her dream: she first enquired out for the fish; but accidentally      taking up some of the river water (that runs close by the house) in      a pail, she took up the much desired banquet, dress'd it, and      devour'd it almost all: This odd affair made no small noise in the      neighbourhood, and the curiosity of it made several people of      quality offer themselves to be sponsors at the baptismal fount when      she was delivered; this their poverty accepted joyfully, and three      were chosen, who maintained him at school, and at the university      afterwards.\"    [Illustration: _Abbot's Hospital, Guildford._]    The great archbishop's days ended in gloom. He was shooting deer in Lord  Zouch's park at Bramshill, and by an unlucky accident killed a keeper,  one Peter Hawkins. Kingsley has pictured the scene:--        \"I went the other day\" (he writes in a letter from Eversley) \"to      Bramshill Park, the home of the _seigneur de pays_ here, Sir John      Cope. And there I saw the very tree where an ancestor of mine,      Archbishop Abbot, in James the First's time, shot the keeper by      accident! I sat under the tree, and it all seemed to me like a      present reality. I could fancy the noble old man, very different      then from his picture as it hangs in our dining room at Chelsea. I      could fancy the deer sweeping by, and the rattle of the cross-bow,      and the white splinters sparkling off the fated tree as the bolt      glanced and turned--and then the death shriek, and the stagger, and      the heavy fall of the sturdy forester--and the bow dropping from the      old man's hands, and the blood sinking to his heart in one chilling      rush, and his glorious features collapsing into that look of      changeless and rigid sorrow, which haunted me in the portrait upon      the wall in childhood. He never smiled again!\"    In those jealous days, an archbishop was not forgiven an accident.  Bishops refused to be consecrated by a prelate with blood upon his  hands. A free pardon was granted him; but he never recovered his spirit,  and fasted once a month on Tuesday for the rest of his life. Peter  Hawkins's widow was by no means so disconsolate. The Archbishop settled  an annuity of L20 upon her, and she got another husband at once.    The Archbishop's great legacy is the Hospital. Unlike Whitgift's  Hospital at Croydon, it has charming surroundings; like it, it is quiet  and old and solid, of good dark red brick, with mullioned windows and  latticed panes, four turrets over the entrance gate, and the most  graceful chimneys that ever carried up smoke from pensioners'  fireplaces. There are many delightful groups of chimneys in Surrey  villages and on Surrey mansions, but Guildford's chimneys are best of  all.    In summer, the quadrangle is bright with geraniums, and through a  passage opposite the entrance is a glimpse of a simple kitchen garden.  In it, as one of the pensioners, a white-haired, blue-eyed old man, told  me, vegetables are grown for the inmates of the hospital. I gathered  that they were not allowed to manage the garden themselves, but that the  garden produce was divided. But they cook for themselves. The pride of  the hospital, however, is not the garden, but the old oak of the  staircases and dining hall and board room, the settle and table, the  copper caldron and the windows with their punning legend \"Clamamus Abba  Pater.\" I am not sure if my old pensioner could read it, but he pointed  it out to me, and when I read it, approved. In the chapel, where there  are a number of Latin verses telling the story of the painted windows,  it was easier for him; he handed me a written explanation. But the  explanation matters very little; the real thing is the superb colour.  The story, which is of Jacob, Esau and Laban, is told on two windows,  with nine lights. There are purples and greens in those windows at which  you might gaze through a dozen sermons; but there is one robe of  burning, translucent orange that would light a cathedral.    The history of these windows would be worth knowing. They were evidently  not wholly made for the tracery, though parts of them may have been.  According to one account, they were purchased by Archbishop Abbot from  the Dominican Friary which used to stand at the end of Guildford North  Street, and which was converted into a Manor House after the dissolution  of the monasteries. But the glass belongs to more than one period, and  some of it was evidently added by the Archbishop, for among the heraldic  devices above the Jacob and Esau lights are the Abbot arms impaling the  Canterbury arms. Also--a point which the antiquarians have no doubt  noticed, but I can find no reference to it in any book--the initials  S.R., which appear in the centre top opening of the north window under  the date 1621, are evidently part of another inscription. On the left  side of the S is part of a V or U, as if the end of a Latin word ending  in \"us\" had had its tail chopped off. The letters must have been  selected from the original inscription for some definite reason; what  can it have been?    Archbishop Abbot's bones lie opposite his hospital, in the church of  Holy Trinity. Of the three churches which stand on the High Street,  Trinity Church is the highest up the hill, and was called the Upper  Church in the days when Puritanism preferred not to mention dedications.  It is, comparatively speaking, a modern building, red-brick and heavy;  it was built after the old church fell down in 1740. An admirable calm  must have pervaded the citizens of Guildford on that occasion. Russell,  one of Guildford's historians, observes that the inhabitants, \"desirous  of improving\" the church, had recently repaired it at a cost of L750. He  then adds, reflectively, that \"As the arches and pillars which supported  the steeple were then taken away, it was soon after supposed to be in a  very ruinous condition.\" On April 18, 1740, an order was given for the  church to be inspected. On the 19th it was inspected, and the steeple  was reported to be very unsafe. On the 20th, therefore, which was  Sunday, service was performed for the last time. On the 23rd the steeple  fell in and took the roof with it; the workmen had left the church a few  minutes before. Even then there was at least one untroubled soul in  Guildford. The verger was told that the steeple had fallen. \"That cannot  be,\" he replied, \"I have the key in my pocket.\"    The vault in which the archbishop lies was accidentally opened in 1888,  when the church was being repaired, and some brickwork fell away.  Through the gap, it is said, the coffin could be seen on the floor; the  form of the body was distinct, and the beard was still there. The vault  was sealed again; it had been unopened for more than two hundred and  fifty years. It was during these alterations that the cenotaph standing  over the vault was removed further east to where it now stands. It is a  typical piece of Renaissance work, florid, intricate, insistent on the  ghastliness of death. The effigy of the archbishop, stern and noble,  lies on its marble bed supported by stacks of gilt-clasped books;  underneath, a grating reveals a medley of human bones, carved with the  minutest"]]]
