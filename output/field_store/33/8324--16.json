[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22631"],[0,"An Account of Timbuctoo and Housa Territories in the Interior of Africa (#15)"],[1,"d; so that       what would have cost in England thousands of pounds, was here       completed for a few hundred dollars.         The natives of this long-neglected territory were too acute not to       perceive the field of wealth that was thus opened to their  63   industry; they were convinced, from the traditions of their       fathers, of the incalculable benefits that would arise from a       commercial reciprocity; and they were determined to cultivate the       opportunity that was now offered to put them in possession of those       commercial advantages which their fathers had enjoyed before: the       benefits of which they had often related to their children, when       they talked of the prosperity and riches of the country during the       reign of Muley Ismael, when this port was before open to foreign       commerce. Agreeably to these well-founded anticipations, the genial       influence of commerce began, soon after my arrival, to manifest       itself throughout all ranks and denominations of men; _the whole       population visibly improved in their apparel and appearance; new       garments were now becoming common, and were every where substituted       for the rags and wretchedness before witnessed on landing here._         About four miles east of Santa Cruz, in a very romantic valley       surrounded by mountains, are found the ruins of a Portuguese tower.       _Tildie_, which is the name of this place, abounds in plantations       of the most delicious figs, grapes of an enormous size and       exquisite flavour, citrons, oranges, water-melons, walnuts,       apricots in great abundance, and peaches, &c. &c.         I invited a party of Arabs to accompany me to this delightful       retreat, where we dined: the Arabs killed two sheep; one they       roasted whole on a wooden spit, made on the spot; the other they  64   baked whole in an oven made for the purpose, in the following       manner: A large hole was dug in the ground; the inside was       plaistered with clay; after which they put fire in the hole till       the sides were dry; they then put the sheep in, and the top was       covered by clay in the form of an arch, fashioned and constructed       by the hand only; they afterwards made a large trough round this       temporary oven, and filled it with wood, to which they set fire.       The sheep was about three hours preparing in this manner, and it       was of exquisite flavour; the roasted mutton also was equally well       flavoured. No vegetables were served with this repast; for I had       desired that the fare should be precisely according to their own       custom; I therefore declined interfering with the arrangement of       the food. This mode of cooking is in high estimation with       travellers. These people never eat vegetables with their meat. When       they see Europeans eat a mouthful of meat, and then another of       vegetables, they express their surprise, observing that the taste       of the vegetables destroys the taste of the meat; and _vice versa_,       that the taste of the meat destroys the flavour of the vegetables!         The town of Santa Cruz, built on the summit of a branch of the       Atlas, by the Portuguese, is enclosed by a strong wall, fortified       with bastions mounting cannon; it is about a mile in circumference.       Half way down the mountain, on the western declivity, opposite the       sea, stands a battery, which defends the town, towards the north,  65   south, and west, at the foot of the mountain. Westward, on the       shore of the sea, stands a town, called by the Shelluhs, (the       natives of this country,) Agurem. There is a copious spring of       excellent water at Agurem, built and ornamented by the Portuguese,       when they had possession of this country, and called by them       _Fonte_, which name the town still retains, and is so called by       Europeans. The royal arms of Portugal are seen, carved in stone,       over the tank. Santa Cruz is supplied with spring-water from here,       having none but rain-water in the town, which is collected in the       rainy season, and preserved in subterraneous apartments, called       mitferes[96], one of which is attached to every respectable house,       and contains sufficient for the consumption of the family during       the year. The natural position of Santa Cruz is extremely strong,       perhaps not less so than Gibraltar, though not on a peninsula; and       it might, in the hands of an European power, be made impregnable       with very little expense; it might also be made a very convenient       and most advantageous depot for the establishment of an extensive  66   commerce with the whole of the interior of North Africa. An attempt       of this kind was made about forty or fifty years since, by the       Danes, who anchored with several ships, and landed a mile south of       Agurem; and with stones, all ready cut, and numbered, erected on an       eminence[97], by the dawn of the following day, a battery of twelve       guns. But by a stratagem of the bashaw El Hayanie, who at that time       was bashaw of Suse, they were rendered unable to retain possession       of their fort; their plans were accordingly disconcerted, and the       adventurers retreated, and returned to their ships.             [Footnote 96: The mitfere under my house at Santa Cruz,           contained, when full, four hundred pipes of water. At the           termination of the rainy season in March, it was generally           about two-thirds full, supplied from the flat roof or terras           during the rainy season. There was always much more than we           could consume, accordingly great quantities were distributed           among the poor, about the close of the season, or the autumn           previous to the next rainy season.]             [Footnote 97: Called Agadeer Arba.]         At the south-east extremity of the wall of Santa Cruz there is a       round battery, which protects the town from west to east; and might       be made to protect the valley to the east of the mountain. This       battery, with a little military skill, might be made to protect       every access to the town, not protected by the battery before       mentioned, which is situated about half way up the western       declivity of the mountain, and which commands or secures the fonte,       or spring, against an attack from any hostile force.  67         LETTER IV.         _Command of the Commerce of Sudan._         TO THE SAME.         Santa Cruz, May 5, 1792.         If Great Britain were to purchase the port of Santa Cruz of the       emperor, for a certain annual stipend, we should be enabled to       command the whole commerce of Sudan, at the expense of Tunis,       Tripoli, Algiers, and Egypt; not at the expense of Marocco, because       an equivalent, or what the emperor would consider as such, would be       given in exchange for it; and we should then supply all those       regions with merchandise, at the first and second hand, which they       now receive through four, five, and six. We should thus be enabled       to undersell our Moorish competitors, and thus draw to our       commercial depot, all the gold-dust, gold-bars, and wrought-gold,       gum-sudan, (commonly called in England, Turkey gum-arabic), ostrich       feathers, and other articles the produce of Sudan; besides the       produce of Suse, viz. gum-barbary, sandrac, euphorbium, and       ammoniac, almonds, olive oil, wine, &c., together with the richest       fruits of every kind. These we should take in barter for our       manufactures.  68       The road of Santa Cruz is very safe, and the best in the empire of       Marocco; it is defended from the fury of the tremendous gales that       visit this coast in December and January, and which invariably blow       from the south, by a projection of land that extends gradually from       the river Suse to cape Noon, very far westward into the ocean.       During my residence of several years at this summit of Atlas, not       one ship was wrecked or lost; there is plenty of water, and good       anchorage for ships of the line.         A thousand European troops, directed by a vigilant and experienced       captain, might take the place by a _coup de main_; and the natives,       (after a proper explanation and assurance that trade was the object       of the capture,) would probably become allies of the captors, and       would supply in abundance all kind of provisions. They esteem the       English, and denominate them their brothers.[98] They sorely regret       the loss of trade occasioned by the emperor's restrictions, and       would gladly promote the cultivation of commerce if they had an       opportunity. They have been from time immemorial a trading       generation.             [Footnote 98: _N'henna u l'Ingleez Khowan_, they say, \"we and           the English are brothers.\"]  69         LETTER V.         FROM MR. WILLIS TO MR. JACKSON.         My dear sir,         I have this moment received your favour, dated yesterday, and am       extremely sorry I had not the pleasure of seeing you before your       departure. We might have taken a farewell dinner together.

If you could send me       too, any of its products or manufactures, which may appear to you       curious or interesting, or may serve to shew the state of knowledge       and civilisation in the country, and the progress they may have       made in the arts, in manufactures or commerce, you will confer upon       me a singular favour; the expense of which I will readily repay,       and which I shall be happy to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22636"],[0,"A Middle High German Primer (#15)"],[1,"), _to praise_, pret.  {lobete}, p.p. {gelobet}; {l[e:]ben} (OHG. {l[e:]b[e]n}), _to live_, pret.  {l[e:]bete}, p.p. {gel[e:]bet} (see Sec. 88).

It is  sometimes used, however, where the dat. or a preposition would be  required in NHG.:--{[e:]r vuor wa[zz]er unde w[e:]ge}, _he went by water and  land_. The acc. is used after {wol}, _well_, when used as an  interjection, as {wol mich}. A double accusative is required not only  after {l[e]ren}, _to teach_, but also after {h[e:]ln}, {verh[e:]ln}, _to  conceal_, {verdagen}, {versw[i]gen}, _to keep secret_.      Sec. 101.    {Dative.} {ruofen}, _to call_, and {schirmen}, _to protect_, take the  dative. The dative is often used adverbially: {allenthalben}, _on all  sides_, {w[i]len(t)}, _formerly_, &c.      Sec. 102.    {Genitive.} The genitives {hande}, {slahte}, {leie} = _manner_ are used  adverbially: {maneger hande}, {slahte}, _or_ {leie}, _in many ways_,  _manifoldly_.    The gen. is used in combination with the comparative of adjectives, as  {dicker eines d[u]mes}, _thicker by the breadth of a thumb_. Indefinite  and interrogative pronouns, used substantively, take the genitive:  {iemen armer liute}, _any poor people_; {niht sch[oe]neres}, _nothing more  beautiful_; {d[e:]s enmac niht s[i]n}, _that cannot be_; {wa[z] mannes [e:]r  w[ae]re}, _what kind of man he was_. In the same manner the rel. {swa[z]} may  take the genitive: {swa[z] man vant d[e:]r armen}, _whatever poor people one  found_.    The genitive may be used predicatively:--{s[i]t s[i] d[e:]s gotesh[u]ses sint},  _since they belong to the house of God_; {diu sorge ist m[i]n eines niht},  _I am not the only one who has sorrow_.    Impersonal verbs often take the genitive: {mich gen[u:]eget d[e:]s}, _that is  enough for me_; {mich gezimt d[e:]s}, _that pleases me_.    The genitives {d[e:]s} and {w[e:]s} may be used adverbially in the sense of  _therefore_, _wherefore_; and likewise many nouns: {tages}, _by day_;  {d[e:]s s[e:]lben tages}, _the same day_; {nahtes}, _by night_.    Interjections usually take the genitive: {ow[e] mir m[i]nes leides!} _alas!  for my grief_. {vil}, _much_, _many_; {m[e](re)}, _more_; {w[e]nic},  {l[u:]tzel}, _little_; {minner}, {minre}, _less_; and {genuoc}, _enough_,  used as indeclinable substantives, are followed by the genitive.  Cardinal numerals, used substantively, are also followed by the  genitive: {zweinzec starker man}, _twenty strong men_.      ADJECTIVES.    Sec. 103.    The weak and strong forms are used in the same manner as in Mod. HG.  {dirre}, _this_, is followed by the weak or strong form; {aller}, _all_,  usually by the strong. The strong or weak form can be used after  pronouns, as {ich armer} or {ich arme}, _I poor ..._ In the vocative the  weak form without the article is used, as {guoten liute}, _(ye) good  people_. When the same adjective refers to nouns of different gender, it  is put in the neuter plural.    {ein} and the possessive pronouns are followed by the strong form in the  Nom. and Acc. singular; by the strong or weak form in the pl. and Gen.  and Dative singular.    The possessive pronouns are declined strong.    The uninflected form of the adjective is used side by side with the  inflected in the Nom. singular, all genders, and Acc. singular neuter,  when the adjective comes before the noun: {ein guot man}, _a good man_.  When the adjective stands after the noun the uninflected form may be  used without reference to number, gender, or case, {ein}, {dehein}, and  the possessive pronouns have the uninflected form in the Nom. for all  genders, and Acc. neuter. The uninflected form of {al}, _all_, can be  used before all forms of the definite article: {in al d[e:]r w[e:]rlte}, _in  all the"]]]
