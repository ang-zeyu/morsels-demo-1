The drive of four or five miles takes over an hour, and looking south we  see the lights shining across the bay from where we started. We climb  slowly up Malabar Hill in the dusky shade of the heavy foliage and come  to a stop amongst crowds of other carriages opposite Government House.    I'd like to stop and paint this scene, it would suit the stage--the  marquee on the right, pale moonlight on its ridge, and warm light and  colour showing through its entrance as ladies go in to put off their  cloaks; its guy ropes are fast to branches and air roots of a banyan  tree; and to the left there is another graceful tree, with wandering  branches, hung with many red and yellow paper lamps, the branches like  copper in the light and in shadow black against the dark blue sky. In  front is part of Government House, dim white with trellis work and  creepers round a classic verandah, and lamplight coming through the open  jalousies. Leading up to the verandah are wide steps in shadow; and on  these, a light catching now and then on a jewel or scabbard, are groups  of Indian Princes. Beside us on the lawn are people in all kinds of  dresses, soldiers in uniform and the gold dull in the shadows, ladies in  fairy-coloured ball dresses, and Parsi men in frock-coats and shiny  black hats, their women in most delicate veils over European dresses.  The figures move quietly and speak softly, and the air is full of the  rattle of crickets or cicadas and a pleasant scent of night flowers, and  cheroot smoke, with a whiff of old ocean.    We wait and chat outside with acquaintances, and some ladies practise  curtseys whilst the natives are being received--the coloured man first,  the white man and his womenfolk when they may! Then we all go up the  steps and into the brilliant interior, which is Georgian in style, and  light and prettily coloured. It is distinctly a sensation, to come from  semi-darkness into full light and such an extraordinary variety of  people and colour and costumes. The figures in the half light outside  were interesting, in the full blaze of hundreds of candles from many  chandeliers the effect is just as brilliant as anything one could  imagine. The strong colours of the natives' turbans, silk coats, sashes,  and jewels enrich the scene, and their copper colour helps to set off  the splendid beauty of our women with their dazzling skins and  delicately coloured dresses. Positively these princes were inches deep  in emeralds, diamonds, and pearls.    [Illustration]    Then comes the tableau of the evening, the Prince and Princess walking  with aides-de-camp through their Eastern and Western subjects, with an  introduction made here and there. The Prince walks in front and the  Princess a few steps behind. She seems very pleased and interested, and  still, I think, looks under her eye lest she should fail to recognise  some one she would wish to notice, and the Prince's expression is so  pleasant, quiet, and possessed in repose, and with a very ingratiating  smile. He stops and speaks to right and left, to one of our officers, or  a native prince. One, a tall grizzled old fellow with gorgeous turban  and the eye and air of a hunter, bends very low over the offered  hand, and talks a moment, possibly tells how he shot with the King when  he was Prince, and how there are tigers and devoted subjects waiting in  the north in his state all at the service of the son of the Great White  Raj, and as the Prince goes past, the old man follows him with a very  kindly expression. I must say that these people's jewels interest me  more than their expressions; but this one man's face was exceptional,  and he was lean! You see the thing above these people, that is the  punkah; when it waggles about it makes a cold draught and you get hot  with annoyance.    [Illustration: Waiting for Carriages after Reception at Government House,    Bombay]    Immediately the Prince passed, the crowd pressed towards a side room for  champagne and iced drinks, the native Princes gallantly leading the  charge. At the start we were all pretty level, but we Britons made a bad  finish, and the native waiters and champagne were somewhat exhausted  when we came in, but for what we did receive we are truly thankful, for  it was sorely needed.    How we got home again now seems like a dream. I have just a vague  recollection of hours and hours in the warm dusk, and crowds of people  in evening dress waiting till their carriages came up. Perhaps the  arrangements could not have been better? Some of us dozed, some smoked  Government House cheroots, which were good, and the time passed. All  conversation gradually stopped, and you only heard the number of the  gharry or carriage shouted out with a rich brogue and sometimes a little  stifled joke and a \"Chelo!\" which seems to stand for \"All right,\" \"Go  ahead,\" \"Look sharp,\" or \"Go on and be damned to you,\" according to  intonation and person addressed. I do not quite understand how it took  such hours to get everyone away, and I do not understand how we ever  managed to get up that vast square staircase up the enormous central  tower of the Taj Hotel, for G. was deadly tired, so of course the lift  wasn't working--it looked so big and grey, and silent in the cold light  of morning.    Then to sleep, and tired dreams of the whole day and evening; I dreamt I  was in a Government House and the guests had gone and I met a dream  Prince and a dream of an A.D.C. in exquisite uniform who said, \"quai  hai,\" and in an instant there were dream drinks, and cheroots such as  one used to be able to get long ago, and we planned ways to remedy  abuses, and the greatest was the abuse of the Royal Academical  privileges; and at such length we went into this, that this morning I  wrote out the whole indictment and it covered six of these pages, and so  it is too long to insert here. And our remedy as it was in a dream was  at once effective--sculpture and painting became as free and as strong  an influence in our national life in Britain as literature is at this  moment--then came a frightful explosion! and I awoke, and the sun was  blazing out of a blue sky through the open windows--then it came again,  a terrific bang! and the jalousies rattled and the whole of the Taj  Hotel shook for the war ships were saluting The Prince of Wales, and he  and his aides-de-camp and all the officials in his train had been up for  hours, \"doing their best to serve their country and their King,\" whilst  we private people slumbered.    But whither have I strayed in this discourse? Am I not rather wandering  from the point, as the cook remarked to the eel, telling dreams instead  of making notes on a cold weather tour as I proposed; so I will stop  here, and tell what, by travel and conference, I have observed about  Royal functions.    The day has passed to the accompaniment of \"God bless the Prince of  Wales,\" and gun firing, and \"God save the King,\" on brass bands, and  more gun firing. Somehow or other \"God save the King\" in India, where  you are surrounded by millions of black people, sounds a good deal more  impressive than it does at home--perhaps there's more of the feeling of  God save us all out here.    I find it impossible to remember nearly all I have seen and heard in  one of these bustling days; I should think that even a resident, long  familiar with all these everyday common sights that are so new and  interesting to us, could barely remember the ceremonies of one day in  connection with the Royal Visit.    [Illustration]    I remember a dock was opened to-day, and we were favoured with tickets  which gave us an admirable view. Again there were shears, at the bottom  of a place like a Greek theatre, very large shears this time, and a  stone suspended from them. The Prince and Princess came down a wide  flight of steps to a platform with two thrones on it. Behind them at the  top of the steps were splendid Ionic pillars and a pediment swagged with  great wreaths of green. The Prince was followed by officers and ladies  and leading Bombay citizens mixed with only a few Indian princes. Sir  Walter Hughes of the Harbour Trust presented a magnificent piece of  silver in the shape of a barque of the time of Charles II., with high  stem and forecastle and billowy sails, guns, ports, standing rigging,  and running gear complete, including waves and mermaids, and all made in  the School of Art here to Mr Burns' instructions. We sat opposite, in  half circles of white uniforms and gay parasols and dresses and dreams  of hats. Behind us and all around and outside the enclosure were  thousands of natives in thousands of colours. There were speeches, of  course, and the Prince touched a button and the stone descended into the  bowels of the earth and made the beginning of the new dock.    Then everyone got their carriages, gharries, bicycles, pony carts, dog  carts or whatever they came in, as best they could, and we all went  trotting, cantering, jambing, galloping, go-as-you-please down the  central thoroughfare between high houses of semi-European design, with  verandahs and balconies full of natives. The crowds on the pavement  stood four or five deep all the way, and hung in bunches on the trees,  some in gay dresses, others naked, brown and glistening against the  dusty fig trees, stems, and branches. You saw all types and colours, one  or two seedy Europeans amongst them, and Eurasians of all degrees of  colour, one, a beautiful girl of about twelve I saw for a second as we  passed; she had curling yellow hair and white skin, might have sat for  one of Millais pictures, and she looked out from the black people with  very wide blue eyes, at the passing life of her fathers. Most of us made  for the Yacht Club for tea on the lawn; for the Prince, it had been  said, was to visit it informally, so all the seats and tables on the  lawn were booked days before!    It was rather pretty there; I"]]]
