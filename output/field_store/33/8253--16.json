Others  say that the bread is really the body of Christ, who is seated at the  right hand of God. We reject both these views; they were not taught  by Christ Himself. And if anyone asks us to say in what way Christ is  present in the sacrament, we reply that we have nothing to say on the  subject. We simply believe what He Himself said, and enjoy what He has  given.\"[32]  But this attitude could not last for ever. As the storms of persecution  raged against them, the Brethren grew more and more radical in their  views. They denied the doctrine of Transubstantiation; they denied also  the Lutheran doctrine of Consubstantiation; they denied that the words  in St. John's Gospel about eating the flesh and drinking the blood  of Christ had any reference to the Lord's Supper. They took the whole  passage in a purely spiritual sense. If those words, said Bishop Luke,  referred to the Sacrament, then all Catholics, except the priests, would  be lost; for Catholics only ate the flesh and did not drink the blood,  and could, therefore, not possess eternal life. They denied, in a  word, that the Holy Communion had any value apart from the faith of the  believer; they denounced the adoration of the host as idolatry; and thus  they adopted much the same position as Wycliffe in England nearly two  hundred years before. The Lord Christ, they said, had three modes  of existence. He was present bodily at the right hand of God; He was  present spiritually in the heart of every believer; He was present  sacramentally, but not personally, in the bread and wine; and,  therefore, when the believer knelt in prayer, he must kneel, not to the  bread and wine, but only to the exalted Lord in Heaven.    Again, the Brethren differed from Luther in their doctrine of Infant  Baptism. If a child, said Luther, was prayed for by the Church, he was  thereby cleansed from his unbelief, delivered from the power of the  devil, and endowed with faith; and therefore the child was baptised as a  believer.[33] The Brethren rejected this teaching. They called it Romish.  They held that no child could be a believer until he had been instructed  in the faith. They had no belief in baptismal regeneration. With them  Infant Baptism had quite a different meaning. It was simply the outward  and visible sign of admission to the Church. As soon as the child had  been baptised, he belonged to the class of the Beginners, and then, when  he was twelve years old, he was taken by his godfather to the minister,  examined in his \"Questions,\" and asked if he would hold true to the  faith he had been taught. If he said \"Yes!\" the minister struck him  in the face, to teach him that he would have to suffer for Christ;  and then, after further instruction, he was confirmed by the minister,  admitted to the communion, and entered the ranks of the Proficient.    Such, then, was the life, and such were the views, of the Bohemian  Brethren. What sort of picture does all this bring before us? It is the  picture of a body of earnest men, united, not by a common creed, but  rather by a common devotion to Christ, a common reverence for Holy  Scripture, and a common desire to revive the customs of the early  Christian Church.[34] In some of their views they were narrow, in others  remarkably broad. In some points they had still much to learn; in others  they were far in advance of their times, and anticipated the charitable  teaching of the present day.          CHAPTER VIII. -- JOHN AUGUSTA AND HIS POLICY, 1531-1548.    As the great Bishop Luke lay dying at Jungbunzlau, there was rising to  fame among the Brethren the most brilliant and powerful leader they had  ever known. Again we turn to the old Thein Church; again the preacher is  denouncing the priests; and again in the pew is an eager listener with  soul aflame with zeal. His name was John Augusta. He was born, in 1500,  at Prague. His father was a hatter, and in all probability he learned  the trade himself. He was brought up in the Utraquist Faith; he took  the sacrament every Sunday in the famous old Thein Church; and there he  heard the preacher declare that the priests in Prague cared for nothing  but comfort, and that the average Christians of the day were no better  than crack-brained heathen sprinkled with holy water. The young man was  staggered; he consulted other priests, and the others told him the same  dismal tale. One lent him a pamphlet, entitled \"The Antichrist\"; another  lent him a treatise by Hus; and a third said solemnly: \"My son, I see  that God has more in store for you than I can understand.\" But the  strangest event of all was still to come. As he rode one day in a  covered waggon with two priests of high rank, it so happened that one of  them turned to Augusta and urged him to leave the Utraquist Church and  join the ranks of the Brethren at Jungbunzlau. Augusta was horrified.    Again he consulted the learned priest; again he received the same  strange counsel; and one day the priest ran after him, called him back,  and said: \"Listen, dear brother! I beseech you, leave us. You will get  no good among us. Go to the Brethren at Bunzlau, and there your soul  will find rest.\" Augusta was shocked beyond measure. He hated the  Brethren, regarded them as beasts, and had often warned others against  them. But now he went to see them himself, and found to his joy that  they followed the Scriptures, obeyed the Gospel and enforced their  rules without respect of persons. For a while he was in a quandary.  His conscience drew him to the Brethren, his honour held him to the  Utraquists, and finally his own father confessor settled the question  for him.    \"Dear friend,\" said the holy man, \"entrust your soul to the Brethren.  Never mind if some of them are hypocrites, who do not obey their own  rules. It is your business to obey the rules yourself. What more do you  want? If you return to us in Prague, you will meet with none but sinners  and sodomites.\"    And so, by the advice of Utraquist priests, this ardent young man joined  the ranks of the Brethren, was probably trained in the Brethren's House  at Jungbunzlau, and was soon ordained as a minister. Forthwith he rose  to fame and power in the pulpit. His manner was dignified and noble.  His brow was lofty, his eye flashing, his bearing the bearing of a  commanding king. He was a splendid speaker, a ready debater, a ruler  of men, an inspirer of action; he was known ere long as the Bohemian  Luther; and he spread the fame of the Brethren's Church throughout the  Protestant world. Full soon, in truth, he began his great campaign. As  he entered on his work as a preacher of the Gospel, he found that among  the younger Brethren there were quite a number who did not feel at all  disposed to be bound by the warning words of Luke of Prague. They had  been to the great Wittenberg University; they had mingled with Luther's  students; they had listened to the talk of Michael Weiss, who had been  a monk at Breslau, and had brought Lutheran opinions with him; they  admired both Luther and Melancthon; and they now resolved, with one  consent, that if the candlestick of the Brethren's Church was not to  be moved from out its place, they must step shoulder to shoulder with  Luther, become a regiment in the conquering Protestant army, and march  with him to the goodly land where the flower of the glad free Gospel  bloomed in purity and sweet perfume. At the first opportunity  Augusta, their leader, brought forward their views. At a Synod held  at Brandeis-on-the-Adler, summoned by Augusta's friend, John Horn,  the senior Bishop of the Church, for the purpose of electing some new  Bishops, Augusta rose to address the assembly. He spoke in the name of  the younger clergy, and immediately commenced an attack upon the old  Executive Council. He accused them of listlessness and sloth; he said  that they could not understand the spirit of the age, and he ended his  speech by proposing himself and four other broad-minded men as members  of the Council. The old men were shocked; the young were entranced; and  Augusta was elected and consecrated a Bishop, and thus, at the age of  thirty-two, became the leader of the Brethren's Church. He had three  great schemes in view; first, friendly relations with Protestants in  other countries; second, legal recognition of the Brethren in Bohemia;  third, the union of all Bohemian Protestants.    First, then, with Augusta to lead them on, the Brethren enlisted in the  Protestant army, and held the banner of their faith aloft that all the  world might see. As the Protestants in Germany had issued the Confession  of Augsburg, and had it read in solemn style before the face of  the Emperor, Charles V., so now the Brethren issued a new and full  \"Confession of Faith,\" to be sent first to George, Margrave of  Brandenburg, and then laid in due time before Ferdinand, King of  Bohemia. It was a characteristic Brethren's production.[35] It is  perfectly clear from this Confession that the Brethren had separated  from Rome for practical rather than dogmatic reasons. It is true  the Brethren realised the value of faith; it is true the Confession  contained the sentence, \"He is the Lamb that taketh away the sins of the  world; and whosoever believeth in Him and calleth on His name shall be  saved\"; but even now the Brethren did not, like Luther, lay stress on  the doctrine of justification by faith alone. And yet Luther had no  fault to find with this Confession. It was addressed to him, was printed  at Wittenberg, was issued with his consent and approval, and was praised  by him in a preface. It was read and approved by John Calvin, by  Martin Bucer, by Philip Melancthon, by pious old George, Margrave of  Brandenburg, and by John Frederick, Elector of Saxony.

Special attention may be given to some points in the sculpture of these  corbels, every one of which is worthy of careful study. In (1) notice  the figure of Ovin, previously named as the steward, bearing an official  staff, or perhaps a sword. In (2) the surrender of royal dignity is  signified by the crown placed on the altar. In (3) the leaf-bearing  staff has an abundance of conventional foliage. In (5) Wilfrid bears a  simple pastoral staff, and not an archbishop's cross, as in previous  scenes--a point to which Dean Stubbs calls attention as indicating the  historical accuracy of the designer, because in former scenes the  archbishop is represented in his own diocese, while here he is a simple  bishop in banishment. In (6) there is a dignified figure--probably S.  Sexburga--standing behind the priest who is ministering to the dying  abbess. In (7) the kneeling figure is S. Benedict handling the fetters.    Until the plain colour-wash with which the vault had been covered was  removed in 1850 there was no knowledge of what had been the character of  the original decoration. Traces of colouring were then discovered, and  in some places geometrical designs, but there was no evidence of  anything very elaborate. The whole of the present decoration forms  accordingly an entirely new design; it is by Mr. Gambier Parry, who  himself painted the principal figures. The central boss of the lantern  is carved in oak, and is original; only its painting is new. All the  remaining figures are wholly new. Groups of seraphim, bands of heavenly  minstrels bearing all kinds of ancient musical instruments, monograms,  and sacred emblems, all combine to give a rich variety.    [Illustration: THE SOUTH TRANSEPT.                _Photochrom Co. Ltd. Photo._]    #The Transepts.#--The architectural student will find the transepts  of the greatest interest; as in them is to be seen the earliest work in  the cathedral. They are similar in general character to those at  Winchester, which were built by Abbot Simeon's brother. The transepts at  Winchester were ready for consecration in 1093, and this was seven years  before Simeon came to Ely. The triforium is probably only in part  Simeon's work; and the clerestory was almost certainly added by his  successor. Both transepts have aisles, but in the south transept the  western aisle is walled off. Along the western wall in the north  transept is a stone bench. The square capitals of the piers here have  indentations at the corners, and this is an early example of such  indentation. Some slight ornamentation may be noticed in the cushions of  the capitals, especially in the south transept, where there are traces  of ancient colouring. The three chapels to the east of the north  transept are divided by walls, and two have wooden screens. One of these  has been restored by Professor Stanton for use as a chapel for early  celebrations and for private devotion. Some early paintings on the  vaulted roof, representing the martyrdom of S. Edmund, are sufficient  to justify this being called S. Edmund's chapel. It is probable that  this was the Chantry on the Green (so called from the place of residence  of the four chaplains) founded by Bishop Northwold. The screen in front  of this chapel is exceedingly light and graceful; it dates from about  1350. At one time it is said to have been in the south transept, and  afterwards where it now stands; it was removed in 1865, but is now  replaced. In the south transept the whole of the eastern aisle is walled  off for the library. In the plan in Bentham's History, 1770, only the  single bay to the south is marked as the library. The walls of partition  between the chapels were taken down in 1814. The western aisle has  always been separated by a low wall of Norman date, possibly a little  later than the adjacent piers; this wall has an intersecting arcade of  round arches, with a string of chevrons above. This aisle is used as a  vestry. Within is the ancient Norman vaulting; and there are some good  original windows, which cannot be seen from without except from the  Deanery gardens. From the devices on the late Perpendicular door it is  clear that it belonged to some church erected by Bishop Alcock; it was  only brought here from Landbeach about fifty years ago.    [Illustration: THE NORTH TRANSEPT.                _Photochrom Co. Ltd. Photo._]    The triforium and clerestory ranges are almost identical with those in  the nave. In the south transept the western windows of the triforium  have been altered into three-light Perpendicular windows. The roofs of  both transepts have been raised, but it is not known at what time. At  the north end are two large windows of good Perpendicular character; at  the south is a single window of seven lights, of very singular design.  At the ends of the transepts are two original galleries, level with the  triforium, supported on round-headed arches. On the north are five  arches, not of equal height, the two most lofty of which reach nearly to  the triforium level. On the south are six much lower arches, and above  them is a blank arcade of intersecting arches. In the floor of the south  transept are laid some very remarkable ancient tiles.    [Illustration: THE CHOIR SCREEN.                _Photochrom Co. Ltd. Photo._]    #The Choir# and #Presbytery#--A beautiful screen of oak, with brass  gates, designed by Scott, divides the choir from the octagon. It is of  early geometric character; and if there had been an original screen of  this design it would have been intermediate in date between the  presbytery and the choir. The tracery is very graceful. A rich cresting  runs along the top, cut through by the gable over the gates, which bears  a terminal cross. On both sides the small niches have statuettes.    [Illustration: ELEVATION OF THE BAYS OF THE PRESBYTERY.                (_for exterior see p. 55._)]    The choir, of three bays, is the work of Bishop Hotham. The last six  bays are the work of Bishop Northwold, and form the presbytery. In the  present arrangement seven of these nine bays form the ritual choir, and  two form the retro-choir. The difference in date between the presbytery  and choir may be roughly taken as very nearly a hundred years. The  former had been begun in 1240; the latter was nearly finished in 1340.  In the juxtaposition of these two magnificent specimens of the Early  English and Decorated periods of architecture there is an opportunity of  comparison which on such a scale occurs nowhere else. It is to be  remembered that in neither case is the treatment of the upper part quite  in accordance with the usual practice of the period. When the presbytery  was being built there were still standing east of the central tower the  four original bays of the Norman choir. These, it may be assumed, were  very similar in character to those in the nave. There would, beyond  question, have been in each bay large triforium arches, each with a  couple of subordinate arches; and a single window in the clerestory with  a blank arch on each side. Bishop Northwold's work was purposely made to  correspond with these bays as far as Early English work could do so; and  when after the fall of the tower it became necessary to rebuild the  choir, Bishop Hotham in like manner made his Decorated work correspond  with the Early English presbytery. The choir is, as would be expected,  richer in detail as well as more elaborate in design; and it would be  difficult to find in England anything to surpass the tracery of the  clerestory windows and triforium arches, the beautiful cusped inner  arches of the clerestory range, the open parapets at the base of the two  stages, or the long corbels, covered with foliage, that support the  vaulting shafts. In the choir the clerestory windows have four lights  each; in the presbytery are triplets. The old colouring has been renewed  throughout. On the north side of the choir the three bays are precisely  alike; but on the south there is a variation in the tracery of the  western triforium arch. There are also shields of arms (of the See of  Ely and of Bishop Hotham) in the spandrels of the triforium and arch  below; and the shaft between this arch and the next is enlarged at the  top into a base for a statue (probably of S. Etheldreda); while level  with the string above is a very fine large canopy (called by the  work-men \"the table\"), which is like nothing else in the cathedral. The  clerestory windows also on the south have different tracery.    [Illustration: THE CHOIR, LOOKING WEST.                _Photochrom Co. Ltd. Photo._]    The difference between the two styles of architecture is well marked in  the groining of the roof, the Decorated portion being much more  elaborate. Some of the bosses are very remarkable: one has S. Etheldreda  with pastoral staff; one has the coronation of the Virgin Mary; one has  the foundress bearing the model of a church, in which (as Dean Stubbs  has pointed out) both arms of the western transept are represented, so  that it is a fair inference that at the time this roof was constructed  the whole of the western transept was standing.    [Illustration: THE TRIFORIUM OF THE CHOIR AND PRESBYTERY.                _Photochrom Co. Ltd. Photo._]    Between the choir and presbytery there rise the massive Norman piers  built as the entrance to the apse; and these are the only remains of the  Norman church east of the octagon. Since the careful examination of the  foundations here, made by Professor Willis in 1850, it is not thought  certain that the apse was actually built. The foundations of the apse  were very manifest, and the design did not include a passage round "]]]
