CHAPTER VII           The comtesse and the duc d'Aiguillon--M. de Soubise--Louis       XV and the duc d'Aiguillon--Letter from the comtesse to the       king--Answer of the king-The \"_Nouvelles a la Main_\"--The       comtesse and Louis XV--The supper--The court ladies       mystified--The comtesse and M. de Sartines    I was still triumphing at the skill which I had displayed in my  conference with the prince de Soubise when the duc d'Aiguillon entered.    \"Good heaven,\" said he, kissing my hand very tenderly, \"into what  inquietude did you throw me by your dear and cruel letter. The ambiguity  of your style has caused me inexpressible sorrow; and you have added to  it by not allowing me to come to you at the first moment.\"    \"I could not: I thought it would be dangerous for you to appear before  the king previously to having seen me.\"    \"Would the king have thought my visit strange?\" asked the duke, not  without some emotion.    \"That is not the point. The black spite of my enemies has not yet  deprived me of the counsels of a friend. But as it is necessary to speak  to the king in my favor, I wish that he should not know that you do so  at my request.\"    After this I related to the duke my conversation with the king.    \"Your situation is delicate,\" said he to me, \"but it should not trouble  you. The king is weak, we must give him courage. It is his pliancy of  disposition rather than his resistance that we must contend with, and I  go to act upon it.\"    I then instructed the duke with what had passed between me and the  prince de Soubise. When I had done, the duke replied:    \"Expect nothing from the prince de Soubise: he will speak, no doubt; but  how? In a jesting, laughing way. If, however, you think he can at all  serve you, give him all your confidence.\"    \"No, no, never,\" I replied with quickness; \"it is not a thing to be done  lightly; we do not select a confidant, counsellor, or friend, at random.  Do you not know this, M. le duc? It is requisite that the heart of  the one who speaks should repose itself on the heart of the friend who  listens. I repeat to you that I have no feeling of confidence towards  M. de Soubise. In fact,\" I added with visible and troubled emotion, \"my  choice is made, and you have too much heroism to wish to combat it.\"    At these flattering words the duke precipitated himself at my feet, and  swore to support my cause with all his power and interest. I replied  that I fully relied on his devotion and prudence. Comte Jean entered,  and it was agreed between us three that I should say no more to the king  of my presentation before the duc d'Aiguillon had spoken to him of it;  that I should content myself with complaining without peevishness, and  that we should leave the opening measure to the prince de Soubise, and  let him break the ice to his majesty.    The prince de Soubise behaved exactly as the duke had told me: he came  to me the next morning with a mysterious air, which already informed  me of all he had to say. He said that he had vainly tormented the king;  that his majesty wished things to remain just as they were, and desired  that until a new order of things nothing should be altered.    \"I am sorry for it, monsieur le marechal,\" I replied. \"Whilst I am in  this precarious situation, whilst I remain in a corner of the stage as a  confidante of tragedy, I can do nothing for my friends, particularly for  you, monsieur le marechal.\"    \"On the contrary, madame,\" he replied, \"the king will be more disposed  to listen to you whilst he will suppose that your influence is unknown.\"    \"Oh,\" cried I with a feeling of anger, \"you gentlemen courtiers think  of nothing but politics. As for me, who am a woman, I have other matters  for consideration: I must have honors, title, rank. My self-love suffers  cruelly when I see myself immolated by the fear which the ladies de  Grammont and three or four other intriguers of their party are able to  excite.\"    The prince was somewhat startled at the freedom of language which I  used towards ladies in such credit at court: he begged me to moderate my  feelings, and be less moved and excited. By this the prince de Soubise  lost the esteem which I might have accorded him, and the second place in  my counsels, which I might have given him.    I told the duke, who came to see me the moment afterwards, of the  failure of the prince's attempt. He told me that he had not hoped for  a better result. He went to the king, flattering himself with hopes of  better success, but did not find him.    The daughters of Louis XV had united against me with a fury which  nothing could justify. They were incessantly talking scandal of my past  life, as if there were only saints at court, as if they had no pranks  of their own to reproach themselves with. All the chateau knew of their  lovers, and there was _living_ evidence of the tenderness of madame  Adelaide: as for madame Louise she was an angel upon earth, and was the  only one who did not join in the cry against me. On the other hand, the  king, whilst he had but little love for his dear daughters, preserved  towards them a complaisance and external appearance of kindness which  was a substitute for parental love. When _mesdames royales_ cried out,  he stopped his ears with his two hands, and seemed, whilst looking  proudly at France, to say, \"Am not I a good father, and are not my  daughters very happy, for I let them cry out with all their might?\"    The next day the duc d'Aiguillon went again to the king, and found him  bewildered with family scenes and the murmurings of the Choiseuls. When  my ambassador had delivered his message, the king asked him if he, as  well as the prince de Soubise, had been set upon his haunches by me.    The duke, nothing intimidated at this, told the king that far from  having wished that he should be my interpreter, I had requested him not  to allude to the matter.    \"Why, then,\" said Louis XV laughing, \"do you not follow the advice of  the comtesse?\"    \"Because I entertain a sincere attachment for her, and that I am vexed  to hear it said that there are persons who lead your majesty.\"    \"Who are the insolents that hold such language?\"    \"They surround you, sire. There is not a female here but affirms that  you dare not decide on the presentation of the comtesse.\"    \"I alone am master, and will let them know it when the opportunity  arrives; but the present moment is not fitting. The comtesse knows how  well I love her; and if she will prove her friendship towards me, she  will remain quiet for some time.\"    The duke thought it best to be silent, and came to me. After relating  the conversation, he added, \"Do not appear at all dejected; the king  would not then visit you lest he should find you out of temper. Were I  you I should write to him; a word of peace would set him at ease.\"    I approved this advice, and instantly penned the following letter:--    \"Sire--They tell me that your majesty has been tormented on my account.  It is a treason of which I alone could believe myself capable. But why  should I complain? You have done so much for me that I ought to  esteem myself happy: your august friendship consoles me thro' all my  annoyances. Be assured that henceforth I shall pout no more; I will be  the best sheep in the world, relying on my shepherd for not having my  fleece cut too closely; for after all I think I am the petted ewe, etc.\"    A short time afterwards a page brought me a splendid box of _bonbons_  with a pair of ruby ear-rings surrounded with diamonds, and this short  billet:--    \"Yes, assuredly you are my pet ewe, and always shall be. The shepherd  has a strong crook with which he will drive away those who would injure  you. Rely on your shepherd for the care of your tranquillity, and the  peace of your future life.\"    In the evening the king visited me. He was embarrassed, but I set him at  ease by showing him a laughing countenance, talking only of his present,  which I had in my ears, and shaking my head about to keep the drops in  motion, which sparkled with great brilliancy. He was pleased at this,  and did not leave me all the evening. In the morning we were the best  friends in the world.    Some days elapsed, when comte Jean came to me, bringing two infamous  articles which had appeared in the \"_Nouvelles a la Main_,\" and were  directed against me. They were atrocious and deeply chagrined me: I  placed them on the mantel-piece, where all who came in could see them.  The duc de Duras read them, and said, \"Conceal these atrocities from the  king.\"    \"No,\" was my reply, \"I wish him to read them, that he may know how his  affections are respected, and how the police of Paris are employed in  doing their duty to the throne.\"    These last words annoyed M. de Duras, between whom and M. de Sartines  there was a connection: the duke was indebted to the lieutenant-general  of police for the special surveillance which he kept over a young girl  of whom he, the duc de Duras, was foolishly enamoured. Trembling for  his _dear friend_ M. de Sartines, he wrote to him in haste, but had not  courage or talent enough to undertake the defence of the guilty person.    The king came as usual; his general station was at the chimney-piece,  where he amused himself with looking at the baubles that ornamented it.  The \"_Nouvelles a la Main_\" fell in his way. He read them once, then  again; then, without uttering a word, threw them into the fire. I  observed him, and saw that he was full of emotion which he sought to  conceal, but the anger burst forth soon. The prince de Soubise, who  supped with us that evening, asked the duc de Duras if he had read the  \"_Gazette de France._\"    \"No,\" was the reply; \"I seldom read such nonsense.\"    \"And you are quite right,\" said the king. \"There is at present a most  inconceivable mania for writing.

This  combined suggestion of the rabbit and the tiger was peculiarly  daunting in its effect. The strange beast's head was round and  cat-like, but with high, tufted ears, and a curious, back-brushed  muffle of whiskers under the throat. Its eyes, wide and pale, shone  with a cold ferocity and unconquerable wildness. Its legs, singularly  large for the bulk of its body, and ending in broad, razor-clawed,  furry pads of feet, would have seemed clumsy, but for the impression  of tense steel springs and limitless power which they gave in every  movement. In weight, this stealthy and terrifying figure would have  gone perhaps forty pounds--but forty pounds of destroying energy and  tireless swiftness.    As he crept through a spruce thicket, his savage eyes turning from  side to side, the lynx came upon a strange trail, and stopped short,  crouching. His stub of a tail twitched, his ears flattened back  angrily, his long, white fangs bared themselves in a soundless snarl.  A green flame seemed to flicker in his eyes, as he subjected every  bush, every stone, every stump within his view to the most piercing  scrutiny. Detecting no hostile presence, he bent his attention to the  strange trail, sniffing at it with minute consideration.    The scent of the trail was that of a wildcat; but its size was too  great for that of any wildcat this big lynx had ever known. Wildcats  he viewed with utter scorn. For three years he had ruled all Ringwaak  Hill; and no wildcat, in those three years, had dared to hunt upon his  range. But this newcomer, with the wildcat smell, seemed about as big  as three wildcats. The impression of its foot on a patch of moist  mould was almost as large as that of the lynx himself--and the lynx  well knew that the wildcats were a small-footed tribe. Like most of  the hunting beasts, he was well-schooled in the lore of the trails,  and all the signs were to him a clear speech. From the depth and  definiteness of that footprint, he felt that both weight and strength  had stamped it. His long claws protruded from their hidden sheaths, as  he pondered the significance of this message from the unknown. Was the  stranger a deliberate invader of his range, or a mere ignorant  trespasser? And would he fight, or would he run? The angry lynx was  determined to put these questions to the test with the least possible  delay.    The trail was comparatively fresh, and the lynx began to follow it,  forgetful of his hunger and of the hunt on which he had set out. He  moved now more warily than ever, crouching flat, gliding smoothly as a  snake, and hoping to score the first point against his rival by  catching him unawares. So noiselessly did he go, indeed, that a  weasel, running hard upon the trail of a rabbit, actually brushed  against him, to bound away in a paroxysm of fear and rush off in  another direction, wondering how he had escaped those lightning claws.  In fact the lynx, intent only upon the hunting of his unknown foe, was  almost as astonished as the weasel, and quite unprepared to seize the  sudden opportunity for a meal. He eyed the vanishing weasel malignly  for a moment, then resumed his stealthy advance. A white-footed mouse,  sitting up daintily at the door of her burrow, fell over backwards,  and nearly died of fright, as the ghost-gray shape of doom sped up and  passed. But the lynx had just then no mind for mice, and never saw  her.    The strange trail, for some hundreds of yards, kept carefully to the  thickets and the shadows. In one place the marks of a scuffle, with a  heap of speckled feathers and a pair of slim claws, showed that the  intruder had captured and devoured an unwary partridge mothering her  brood. At this evidence of poaching on his preserves, the big lynx's  anger swelled hotly. He paused to sniff at the remnants, and then  stole on with added caution. The blood of the victim was not yet dry,  or even clotted, on the leaves.    A little further on, the trail touched the foot of a clean-stemmed  young maple. Here the trespasser had paused to stretch himself,  setting his claws deep into the bark. These claw-marks the lynx  appeared to take as a challenge or a defiance. Rearing himself against  the tree, he stretched himself to his utmost. But his highest scratch  was two inches below the mark of the stranger. This still further  enraged him. Possibly, it might also have daunted him a little but for  the fact that his own claw-marks were both deeper and wider apart  than those of his rival.    From the clawed tree, the trail now led to the very edge of the open  and thence to the top of an overhanging rock, white and sharply  chiseled in the moonlight. The lynx was just about to climb the rock,  when there beneath it, in the revealing radiance, he saw a sight which  flattened him in his tracks. The torn carcass of a young doe lay a few  feet from the base of the rock; and on top of the prey, glaring savage  challenge, crouched such a wildcat as the lynx had never even dreamed  of.      II.    A few days before this night of the white full moon, a gigantic  wildcat living some fifteen miles from Ringwaak had decided to change  his hunting-grounds. His range, over which he had ruled for years, was  a dark, thick-wooded slope overlooking the brown pools and loud chutes  of the Guimic stream. Here he had prospered hunting with continual  success, and enjoying life as only the few overlords among the wild  kindreds can hope to enjoy it. He had nothing to fear, as long as he  avoided quarrel with a bear or a bull moose. And a narrow escape when  young had taught him to shun trap and snare, and everything that  savoured of the hated works of man.    Now, the lumbermen had found their way to his shadowy domain. Loud  axe-strokes, the crash of falling trees, the hard clank of ox-chains,  jarred the solemn stillness. But far more intolerable to the great  cat's ears was the noise of laughter and shouting, the masterful  insolence of the human voice unabashed in the face of the solitude.  The men had built a camp near each end of his range. No retreat was  safe from their incursions. And they had cut down the great pine-tree  whose base shielded the entrance of his favourite lair. All through  the winter the angry cat had spent the greater portion of his time  slinking aside from these boisterous invaders or glaring fierce hate  upon them from his densest coverts. Thus occupied, he had too little  time for his hunting, and, moreover, the troubled game had become shy.  His temper grew worse and worse as his ribs grew more and more obvious  under his brownish, speckled fur. Nevertheless, for all his swelling  indignation, he had as yet no thought of forsaking his range. He kept  expecting that the men would go away.    When spring came, and the Guimic roared white between its tortuous  shores, some of the loud-mouthed men did go away. Nevertheless, the  big cat's rage waxed hotter than ever. Far worse than the men who went  were three portable steam sawmills which came in their place. At three  separate points these mills were set up--and straightway the long,  intolerable shriek of the circulars was ripping the air. In spite of  himself, the amazed cat screeched in unison when that sound first  smote his ears. He slunk away and hid for hours in his remotest lair,  wondering if it would follow him. When, in the course of weeks, he  grew so far accustomed to the fiendish sound that he could go about  his hunting within half a mile of it, he found that the saws had  worked him an unspeakable injury. They had fouled his beloved  fishing-pools with sawdust.    [Illustration: \"HIS ROUND FACE BENT CLOSE DOWN TO THE GLASSY  SURFACE.\"]    It was the big cat's favoured custom to spend hours at a time crouched  over one or another of these pools, waiting for a chance to catch a  trout. Where an overhanging rock or a jutting root came out into deep  water, he would lie as motionless as the rock or log itself, his round  face bent close down to the glassy surface, his bright eyes intently  following the movements of the big, lazy trout in their safe deeps.  Once in a long while, often enough to keep his interest keen, a  May-fly or a fat worm would drop close past his nose and lie kicking  on top of the water. Up would sail a big trout, open-jawed to engulf  the morsel. At that instant the clutching paw of the watcher would  strike down and around more swiftly than eye could follow--and the  next instant the fish would be flopping violently among the underbrush  up the bank, with leaves and twigs clinging to its fat, silvery,  dappled sides. The sport was one which gave the big wildcat  never-failing delight; and, moreover, there was no other food in all  the wilderness quite so exquisite to his palate as a plump trout from  the ice-cool waters of the Guimic. When, therefore, he found his pools  covered, all day long, with the whitey-yellow grains of sawdust, which  prevented the trout feeding at the surface or drove them in disgust  from their wonted haunts, he realized that his range was ruined. The  men and the mills were the conquerors, and he must let himself be  driven from his well-beloved Guimic slopes. But first he would have  revenge. His caution somewhat undermined by his rage, he crept much  nearer to the main camp than he had hitherto dared to go, and hid  himself in a low tree to see what opportunity fate might fling to  him.    Belonging to the camp was a brindle dog, a sturdy and noisy mongrel  whose barking was particularly obnoxious to the wildcat. Of a surly  yet restless temper, the mongrel was in reality by no means popular in  the camp, and would not"]]]
