Father will  bring one or two of them down.\"    For answer Jack wheeled to the right, and if the manoeuvre had been kept  up it would have answered; but, as it happened, Mr Rogers had gone away  from the waggon in search of some beautifully plumaged birds which had  settled in the trees above the camp, and then gone on to a grove a mile  or so away.    The General and his boys were of course far away out on the plain, where  they had been driving the buffalo, and therefore Dinny was the principal  man in camp.    He was busy with the frying-pan frizzling himself a venison steak, when,  hearing the thunder of hoofs, he dropped the pan in the wood ashes, and  stood staring with horror.    \"What'll I do now?\" he cried.    Then a bright idea seized him, and pulling his knife from his belt, he  dashed at the place where his enemies the dogs were tied up by stout  thongs to the waggon-wheels, and divided them one by one.    \"There, ye bastes,\" he cried, \"be off and get tossed.\"  And as the dogs  rushed off, delighted with their freedom, Dinny chose what he thought  was the safest place in the camp, namely, the space between the four  wheels beneath the waggon, and there lay down and wished himself back  safely in his mother's cabin.    The dogs had been for some moments past tearing at their thongs to get  away, so that no sooner were they freed than, barking and baying  fiercely, they raced down after the buffaloes, and Dinny never did a  better act in his life.  Certainly it was prompted by cowardice; but it  had its good fruits, for it was the saving of poor Dick's life.    The boys had galloped on as had been suggested, gradually inclining to  the right, so that they drew the little herd of bulls into following  them in a circle; and in this way they had nearly gone round the waggon  at about a couple of hundred yards' distance, wondering why their father  did not shoot, when, all at once, just as the baying of the dogs reached  their ears, Dick turned a piteous look at his brother.    \"I'm--I'm not strong, yet, Jack,\" he faltered.  \"Ride on fast.\"    To Jack's horror he saw his brother's eyes close, and that he fell  forward upon his horse's neck; the next moment he had glided as it were  out of his saddle, and fallen--his horse, from its good training,  stopping short by his side.    The buffaloes were only about thirty yards behind, and as Jack reined  in, and turned to help his brother, the bulls lowered, their horns, and  in another moment or two they would have been trampled and gored,  perhaps killed; but just as the great shaggy animals were upon them, the  dogs made their attack, Pompey, Caesar, and Crassus each seizing a bull  by the lip, while Rough'un kept up a furious barking as he tore at the  various animals' heels.    The effect was magical upon the buffaloes, which tossed their heads  furiously in the air, and dislodging their assailants, turned and rushed  off, with the dogs now biting their heels or leaping viciously at their  flanks, all attack now being changed to flight.        CHAPTER THIRTEEN.    \"OOMPH!  OOMPH!  OOMPH!\"    \"Are you much hurt, Dick?\" cried Jack anxiously, as he knelt on one knee  by his brother.    \"No, I think not,\" panted Dick, opening his eyes.  \"I came over all  giddy, and couldn't sit my horse.  Did he throw me?\"    \"No: you fell.\"    \"But where are the buffaloes?\"    \"Yonder they go,\" replied Jack.  \"Don't you hear the dogs?  There, lean  on me, and let's walk in to the camp.\"    \"Oh, no,\" cried Dick.  \"I'm better now.\"    \"No, no; don't try to mount.\"    \"Yes, I shall,\" was the reply.  \"I was overdone from being weak; but I'm  better now, and I'm going with you to bring in the buffalo we shot.\"    \"Oh no, Dick, don't try,\" cried his brother anxiously.    But Dick would not be persuaded, and, mounting his horse, he rode with  his brother up to the waggon, gave the necessary instructions to Peter  and Dirk, and in a few moments those sable gentlemen were leading a  small ox-team over the plain to where the General and his boys were  busily dressing the fallen bull; and by the time Mr Rogers reached the  waggon, the choicest parts of the buffalo were there, the remainder  having been left for the vultures and wild creatures of the plain.    They trekked on for some miles that evening, and soon after sundown  halted by the side of a wood, whose edges were composed of dense thorns,  and here, at the General's suggestion, all set to work, after the waggon  had been drawn up in a suitable position, to cut down the bushes so as  to make a square patch, with the dense thorns on three sides and the  waggon on the fourth, the lower part of the waggon being fortified with  the bushes that were cut down.    The object was to form a sound enclosure, which was duly strengthened,  so as to protect the horses and bullocks from the wild beasts that  haunted the neighbourhood.    It was very hard work, and Dinny grumbled terribly, till Dick said  quietly to his brother, in Dinny's hearing,--    \"I wonder that Dinny don't work harder.  The General says this part  swarms with lions; and they'll be down upon us before we've done if he  don't make haste.\"    Dinny seemed to be turned for the moment into stone, at the bare mention  of the word lion; but directly after he was toiling away with feverish  haste, and in quite a state of excitement, bullying Coffee and Chicory  for not bringing in more dead wood for the fire.    By dint of all working hard, however, a satisfactory place was  contrived, into which, after a good long feed, and a hearty drink of  fresh water from a bubbling stream, the bullocks and horses were shut,  the horses having a division of their own, where they would be safe from  the horns of their friends as well as the teeth and claws of their  enemies.  Then the blazing fire in front of the waggon was utilised for  cooking purposes, and buffalo steaks and thick rich soup from Dinny's  big pot soon restored the losses felt by the little party in their  arduous evening toil.    The waggon was on the very edge of the forest, and a couple of trees  stood out on either side, spreading their branches over it as shelter,  while the ruddy fire that was being steadily fed to get it into a good  glow, with a bright blaze free from the blinding smoke emitted by  burning wood, seemed to turn the waggon and trees into gold.    \"I'll take the first watch, my boys,\" said Mr Rogers, who, after their  hearty supper, had read his sons a lecture about the necessity for care  in hunting, \"for,\" said he, \"but for the dogs your lives would certainly  have been sacrificed.\"    \"Yes, father, we'll be more careful; but how is it the dogs have not  come back?\"    \"They overtook and pulled down one of the buffaloes,\" said Mr Rogers.  \"They will glut themselves, and, after a long sleep, take up our trail  and follow us.  I dare say they'll be here to-morrow.\"    The boys, who were fagged out, gladly crept into the waggon, the last  thing they saw being Dinny putting some pieces of buffalo flesh and half  a pail of water in the big pot, so as to let it stew by the fire all  night.  Then they drew up the canvas curtains of their tent-bed as they  called it, leaving Mr Rogers and Peter to keep up the fire, and to call  them in four hours' time, the boys having begged that they might keep  one of the watches together.    They were fast asleep directly, and in five minutes' time--so Jack  declared--Mr Rogers aroused them to relieve guard.    \"Come, boys,\" he said, \"be quick.  Do you know how long you've been  asleep?\"    \"Five minutes,\" said Jack, sleepily.    \"Nearly five hours, sir.\"    \"Then they weren't good measure,\" grumbled Jack.    \"There's plenty of wood, Dick,\" said Mr Rogers, \"and I'd keep up a good  blazing fire.  I have not heard a sound; but if you are alarmed, a piece  of blazing wood thrown in the direction is better than firing at random;  but keep your rifles ready.\"    These words drove drowsy sleep from the boys' eyelids, and clambering  out of the waggon, the fresh cold night air finished the task.    They saw Mr Rogers climb into the waggon and their black followers  crawl under it; then taking the rifles, they saw to there being a ball  cartridge in each, and big slugs in the shot barrel; and after throwing  on a few sticks to make the fire blaze, they walked slowly up and down.    \"How dark and strange the forest looks, Jack,\" said Dick, \"I say, I'm  not ashamed to say that it does make one feel timid.\"    \"It makes two feel timid,\" said Jack, sturdily.  \"Look at the dark  shadows the fire throws.  Why it almost looks as if there were all sorts  of horrible creatures watching us.  If I didn't feel that father had  been sitting here watching, and wasn't afraid I'd give it up.\"    \"Perhaps he did feel afraid,\" said Dick.    \"Not he,\" said Jack sturdily.  \"If he had felt afraid, he wouldn't have  let us watch here.\"    \"Oh, yes, he would,\" said Dick thoughtfully.  \"Father wants us to grow  up manly and strong, and ready to laugh at what would alarm some lads.  Hark! what's that?\"    He caught his brother's arm, for just then, apparently from beneath  their feet, they heard a peculiar noise.    \"Oomph! oomph! oomph!\" a peculiar, vibrating, shuddering, deep-toned  cry, which seemed to make the air, and the very earth beneath them,  vibrate.    There was no mistaking it.  Over and over again they had heard Coffee  and Chicory imitate the cry;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21381"],[0,"Stories Of Ohio (#15)"],[1,"it  awhile for her. When he gave it back, she threw it away in the snow, to  save her own life, and the Indians found it, and took it to Sandusky,  where they brought it up as their own.    Two years after, when a detachment of Wayne's army camped upon the scene  of the carnage, they had to scrape away the heaps of bones and carry  them out of their tents before they could make their beds, and they  buried six hundred skulls on the field. Such is war, and we cannot look  too closely on its hideous face, which is often so alluringly painted  that we forget it is the face of a pitiless demon.          XII. THE INDIAN WARS AND WAYNE'S VICTORY.    The Indians who had been so well generaled and had fought so ably,  failed as usual to follow up their victory by moving on the American  settlements in force. They kept on harassing the pioneers in small war  parties, but gave the country time to send an army, thoroughly equipped  and thoroughly disciplined, against them. They made a second attack on  the Americans on the old battle ground where General Wayne had built  his Fort Recovery, but they were beaten off with severe loss, though in  their attack they had the aid of many white Canadians and even of some  British officers, or at least of men wearing the uniform of British  officers.    By the treaty of 1783 Great Britain agreed to give us the whole West  below a certain line, but when the time came for the surrender, she  refused to yield the forts south of this line. With the bad faith  of wanton power she kept her posts at Oswego, Niagara, Detroit, and  Mackinaw, because we were weak and she was strong; and from these points  her agents abetted the savages in their war upon the American frontiers.  Just before the battle of Fallen Timbers, where Wayne won his victory,  the Lieutenant Governor of Canada marched a force of Canadian militia  and British regulars into the Ohio country, and built a fort on the  Maumee, near the battle ground, which he held until 1796, when Great  Britain at last gave up all the places she had unrightfully kept. The  Indians expected this fort to open its gates to them, when they fled  before Wayne's men, and were astonished and indignant at the behavior of  then-British friends in denying them refuge. This was not from want of  ill will toward the Americans, who taunted them as they passed, and  whom the garrison wished to fire upon for approaching the post in  force. Sharp letters passed between the American general and the British  commandant, but it ended in nothing worse, and our jealous army,  which remained in the neighborhood laying waste the Indian fields and  villages, could not perceive that the British gave any aid or comfort to  the savages.    The battle of Fallen Timbers was fought on the 20th of August, 1794, on  the banks of the Maumee, near a rising ground called Presque Isle, about  two miles south of the present Maumee City, and four miles from the  British Fort Miami. The place was called Fallen Timbers because it was  covered with trees blown down long before in a tornado. These formed a  natural stronghold for the savages, but Wayne had every other advantage,  especially in numbers; he had almost twice as many men, well drilled,  armed, and clothed, while the miserable and disorderly army of St. Clair  had fallen a prey to a far greater force of Indians.    On the morning of the battle, Wayne sent a flag of truce to the united  tribes, offering peace, but he did not wait for its return. He met his  envoy coming back with an evasive answer, and he pushed on to Fallen  Timbers without stopping. As soon as he reached the battlefield, he  ordered his infantry to beat up the covert of the enemy, who were hidden  among the logs, brush, and grass, with the bayonet, and as they rose to  deliver their fire. His order was carried out so thoroughly and promptly  that this charge of nine hundred men began and ended the fight. Two  thousand; Indians, Canadian militia and volunteers fled before them, and  the rout was complete.    [Illustration: St. Clair's Defeat 114]    The affair was so quickly over that there was no time for the incidents  of heroism and suffering which heightened the tragedy of St. Clair's  defeat. At the beginning of the action, General William Henry Harrison,  afterwards President of the United States, but then one of Wayne's aids,  said to him, \"General Wayne, I'm afraid you will get into the battle  yourself, and forget to give us the necessary field orders.\" \"Perhaps I  may,\" said Wayne, \"and if I do, recollect the standing order for the day  is, Charge the rascals with the bayonets!\" Wayne had got his nickname  of Mad Anthony in the Revolution from his habit of swearing furiously  in battle, and now he called the Indians something more than simply  rascals. We have seen how his men carried out the spirit of his  instructions, and it is told of one of them who got astray from the rest  that he met an Indian alone and gave him the bayonet. At the same time  the Indian gave the American the tomahawk, and they were found dead  together, one with the blade in his breast, the other with the hatchet  in his skull.    A runaway negro who had followed the Kentucky horsemen to the battle,  saw three Indians swimming the river from the shore where the cavalry  were posted, and shot one of them. The other two tried to swim on with  the body. The negro fired again with deadly aim, and the only Indian  left was now in water so shallow that he was dragging the bodies to land  when once more the negro fired and killed his man. Then he ran up to  look at the dead men and found them so like one another that he knew  they must be brothers.    A strange and romantic incident of the campaign, before the battle,  occurred while three American scouts, Wells, McClellan, and Miller, were  ranging the woods to bring in some Indians for Wayne to question. They  came upon a party of three Indians; Wells shot one, and Miller another,  while McClellan, who was very swift of foot, ran down the third. Pursuer  and pursued both stuck in the oozy bottom of a stream, and when Wells  and Miller came up, they were threatening each other with knife and  tomahawk. Miller had been taken captive when a child with one of  his brothers; he had escaped, but this brother had remained with the  savages, and somehow Miller felt that the Indian confronting Mc-Clellan  was his brother. They seized him and washed off his paint; he was white;  he was Miller's brother. They persuaded him, with much trouble at first,  to join Wayne's army, and he fought through the rest of the war on the  American side.    [Illustration: A White Indian 116]    At another time as Wells and a party of his scouts came to the banks of  a stream, they saw on the opposite shore a family of savages who began  to cross the river towards them in a canoe. The scouts, taking them for  Indians, were about to fire on them when Wells suddenly called out that  the first who fired should have a bullet through his own head. He had  recognized the Indians, and he said that when he was a captive in their  tribe, this family had fed and clothed him, and nursed him in sickness,  and treated him as tenderly as one of themselves. The backwoodsmen  joined Wells in talk with his friends, urging them to do what they could  for peace among their people, and left them to paddle away in their  canoe unharmed.    Wells had been the adoptive son of Little Turtle, who led the Indians at  St. Clair's defeat, and he had fought on the side of the savages in that  battle. But after it was over he foresaw that the war must end in favor  of the white men, and he decided to abandon his wild brethren. He spoke  first with Little Turtle as they were walking in the woods together and  warned him in words that a real Indian might have used. \"When the sun  reaches the meridian, I leave you for the whites; and whenever you meet  me in battle you must try to kill me, as I shall try to kill you.\"    But the real Indians had not Wells's forecast, and they continued the  war till they were beaten by Wayne, in whose army Little Turtle might  have found his adoptive son. Little Turtle was himself one of the last  chiefs to yield, but he came in with the rest at Greenville, and one  year after the battle of Fallen Timbers signed the treaty by which  ninety chiefs and the deputies of twelve tribes gave up the Ohio River  as the Indian border, and ceded half the Ohio lands to the United  States.    Little Turtle, or Moshokonoghua, as he was called in the tongue of his  nation, the Miamis, lived for thirty years after signing the treaty, and  then died of gout at Fort Wayne. He traveled through the Eastern States  in the first years of the peace, and gave people there a different  impression from that received by those who knew him before the defeat of  St. Clair, and saw him leading the victors in that battle. He struck all  who met him as a man of intelligence and wit; he got the habit of high  living and bore himself like the gentlemen whose company he loved to  frequent. At Philadelphia the famous Polish exile and patriot Kosciusko  gave him his pistols and bade him shoot dead with them any man who  attempted to rob him of his country.    His business in the East was to interest people in the civilization  of his tribe, but he had no purpose of living among the whites. In  Philadelphia, he said, \"When I walk through the streets I see every  person in his shop employed about something: one makes shoes, another  pots, a third sells cloth. I say to myself, which of these things can  you do? Not one. I can make a bow or an arrow, catch fish, kill game,  and go to war; but none of these things is of any use here. To learn  what is done here would require a long time. Old age comes on. I should  be a useless piece of furniture, useless to my nation, useless to  myself. I must go back to my own country.\"    This was what he did, and as long as he lived he was steadfast "]]]
