Ah! he was an unsympathetic duffer, and knew nothing of the raptures of  winning a three-legged race.    Well, the day was a splendid one after all--a little hot, perhaps, but  the ground was in grand order, and hosts of people would be sure to turn  up.  My race yoke-fellow and I went out quite early for a final spin  over the course, and found one or two of the more diligent of our  schoolfellows taking a similar advantage of the \"lie-abeds.\"  Of course,  as _we_ were of opinion that the three-legged race was the most  important and attractive of all the day's contests, we paid very little  heed to what others were doing, but sought out a retired corner for  ourselves, where, after tying our inside legs together, and putting our  arms round one another's necks in the most approved fashion, we set to  and tore along as fast as we could, and practised starts and falls, and  pick-ups and spurts, and I don't know what else, till we felt that if,  after all, we were to be beaten, it would not be our faults.  With which  comfortable reflection we loosed our bonds and strolled back to  breakfast.    Here, of course, the usual excitement prevailed, and one topic engrossed  all the conversation.  I sat between a fellow who was in for the Junior  100 yards, and another who was down for the \"hurdles.\"  Opposite me was  a hero whom every one expected to win in throwing the cricket-ball, and  next to him a new boy who had astonished every one by calmly putting his  name down for the mile race before he had been two hours at Parkhurst.  In such company you may fancy our meal was a lively one, and, as most of  us were in training, a very careful one.    The first race was to be run at twelve, and we thought it a great  hardship that the lower school was ordered to attend classes on this of  all days from nine to eleven.  Now I am older, it dawns on me that this  was a most wholesome regulation; for had we small chaps been allowed to  run riot all the morning, we should have been completely done up, and  fit for nothing when the races really began.  We did not do much work, I  am afraid, at our desks that morning, and the masters were not  particularly strict, for a wonder.  The one thing we had to do was to  keep our seats and restrain our ardour, and that was no easy task.    Eleven came at last, and off we rushed to the mysteries of the toilet.  What would athletic sports be like without flannel shirts and trousers,  or ribbons and canvas shoes?  At any rate, we believed in the importance  of these accessories, and were not long in arraying ourselves  accordingly.  I could not help noticing, however, as we sallied forth  into the field, that fine feathers do not always make fine birds.  There  was Tom Sampson, for instance, the biggest duffer that ever thought he  could run a step, got up in the top of the fashion, in bran-new togs,  and a silk belt, and the most gorgeous of scarlet sashes across his  shoulders; while Hooker, who was as certain as Greenwich time to win the  quarter-mile, had on nothing but his old (and not very white) cricket  clothes, and no sash at all.  And there was another thing I noticed  about these old hands: they behaved in the laziest of manners.  They  sprawled on the grass or sat on the benches, appearing disinclined for  the slightest exertion; while others, less experienced, took preliminary  canters along the tracks, or showed off over the hurdles.  Fine fellows,  no doubt, they thought themselves; but they had reason to be sorry for  this waste of energy before the day was out.    Programmes!  With what excitement I seized mine and glanced down it!  There it was!  \"Number 12.  Three-legged Race, 100 yards, for boys under  15. 1, Trotter and Walker (pink); 2, White and Benson (green); 3, Adams  and Slipshaw (blue).\"  Reader, have you ever seen your name in print for  the first time?  Then you may imagine my sensations!    Things now begin to look like business.  The doctor has turned up, and a  party of ladies.  The visitors' enclosure is fast filling up, and there  is a fair show of carriages behind.  Those big fellows in the tall hats  are old Parkhurstians, come to see the young generation go through its  paces, and that little knot of men talking together in the middle of the  ground consists of the starter, judge, and umpire.  Not a few of us,  too, turn our eyes wistfully to that tent over yonder, where we know are  concealed the rewards of this day's combats; and in my secret heart I  find myself wondering more than once how it will sound to hear the names  \"Adams and Slipshaw\" called upon to receive the first prize for the  three-legged race.    Hark!  There goes a bell, and we are really about to begin.  \"Number 1,  Junior 100 yards, for boys under 12,\" and 24 names entered!  Slipshaw  and 1, both over 12, go off to have a look at \"the kids,\" and a queer  sight it is.  Of course, they can't all, 24 of them, run abreast, and so  they are being started in heats, six at a time.  The first lot is just  starting.  How eagerly they toe the line and look up at the starter!    \"Are--\" he begins, and two of them start, and have to be called back.  \"Are you ready?\" he says.  Three of them are off now, and can't  understand that they are to wait for the word \"Off!\"  But at last the  starter gets to the end of his speech and has them fairly off.  The  little fellows go at it as if their lives depended on it.  Their mothers  and big brothers are looking on, their \"chums\" are shouting to them  along the course, and the winning-post is not very far ahead.  On they  go, but not in a level row.  One has taken the lead, and the others  straggle behind him in a queer procession.  It doesn't last long.  Even  a Junior 100 yards must come to an end at last, and the winner runs,  puffing, into the judge's arms, half a dozen yards ahead of the next  boy, and 50 yards ahead of the last.  The other three heats follow, and  then, amid great excitement, the final heat is run off, and the best man  wins.    For the Senior 100 yards which followed only three were entered, and  each of these had his band of confident admirers.  Slipshaw and I were  very \"sweet\" on Jackson, who was monitor of our dormitory, and often  gave us the leavings of his muffins, but Ranger was a lighter-built  fellow, and seemed very active, while Bruce's long legs looked not at  all pleasant for his opponents.  The starter had no trouble with them,  but it was no wonder they all three looked anxious as they turned their  faces to him; for in a 100 yards' race the start is everything, as poor  long-legged Bruce found out, for he slipped on the first spring, and  never recovered his lost ground.  Between Ranger and Jackson the race  was a fine one to within twenty yards of home, when our favourite's  \"fat\" began to tell on him, and though he stuck gallantly to work he  could not prevail over the nimble Ranger, who slipped past him and won  easily by a yard.    This was a damper for Slipshaw and me, who, as in duty bound, attended  our champion back to where he had left his coat, and so missed the  throwing of the cricket-ball, which was easily won by the favourite.    But though we missed that event, we had no notion of missing the high  jump, which promised to be the best thing (next to the three-legged  race) that day.  Four fellows were in for it, and of these Shute and  Catherall were two of the best jumpers Parkhurst had ever had; and it  was well known all over the school that in practice each had jumped  exactly 5 foot 4 inches.  Who would win now?  The two outsiders were  soon got rid of, one at 4 foot 10 inches, and the other at 5 foot; and  the real interest of the event began when Shute and Catherall were left  alone face to face with the bar.  Shute was a tall fellow, of slight  make and excellent spring.  Catherall was short, but with the bounce of  an india-rubber ball in him, and a wonderful knack of tucking his feet  up under him in jumping.  It was a pretty sight to watch them advance  half-inch by half-inch, from 5 foot to 5 foot 3 inches.  There seemed  absolutely nothing to choose between them, they both appeared to clear  the bar so easily.  At 5 foot 31/2 inches.  Shute missed his first jump,  greatly to the dismay of his adherents, who saw Catherall clear it with  complete ease.  If he were to miss the second time, he would be out of  it, and that would be a positive tragedy.  So we all watched his next  jump with breathless anxiety.  He stood looking at the bar for a second  or two, as if doubting his own chance.  Then his face cleared up, and he  sprang towards it.  To our delight he rose beautifully and cleared it  easily.  At 5 foot 4 inches both missed the first jump, but both cleared  it at the second trial.  And now for the tug of war.  Both had  accomplished the utmost he had ever hitherto achieved, and it remained  to be seen whether the excitement of the occasion would assist either or  each to excel himself.  Shute came to grief altogether at 5 foot 41/2  inches, and again, to our dismay, Catherall bounded over the bar at his  first effort.  Shute's friends were in despair, and if that hero had  been a nervous fellow he might have been the same.  But he was a very  cool fish, and instead of losing his nerve, sat down on the grass and  tightened the lace of his shoe.  Then he slowly rose to his feet and  faced his task.  At that moment I forgot all about the three-legged  race, and gave my whole heart up to the issue of this jump.  He started  to run at last, slow at first, but gathering pace for his final leap.  Amid breathless silence he sprang forward and reached the bar, and  then--then he coolly pulled up and walked back again.  This looked bad;  but better to pull up in time than spoil his chance.  He kept us waiting  an age before he was ready to start again, but at last he turned for his  last effort.  We could tell long before he got to the bar that this  time, at any rate, he was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21138"],[0,"Love's Meinie: Three Lectures on Greek and English Birds (#15)"],[1,"first laid.  Yarrell says only that it is a large flat nest made of aquatic plants;  while Morris finally complicates the whole business by telling us that  the nest is placed often as much as twenty or thirty yards from the  water, that it is composed of short pieces of roots, reeds, rushes, and  flags, and that when dry the whole naturally becomes very brittle.[23]          [23] I hear, from a friend in whose statements I have absolute        confidence, that he has found the eggs of the water-hen laid on a        dead sycamore leaf by the side of a shallow stream, one of the        many brooks near Uxbridge.    105. While, out of my fifteen volumes of ornithology, I can obtain only  this very vague account of the prettiest bird, next to the kingfisher,  that haunts our English rivers, I have no doubt the most precise and  accurate accounts are obtainable of the shapes of her bones and the  sinuosities of her larynx; but about these I am low-minded enough not  to feel the slightest curiosity. I return to Mr. Gould, therefore, to  gather some pleasanter particulars; first, namely, that she has a  winter and summer dress,--in winter olive gray and white, but in  summer, (changing at marriage time) deep olive black, with dark  chestnut chemisette. Infant dabchicks have \"delicate rose-colored  bills, harlequin-like markings, and rosy-white aprons.\" The  harlequin-like markings I should call, rather, agate-like, especially  on the head, where they are black and white, like an onyx. The bodies  look more like a little walnut-shell, or nutmeg with wings to it, or  things that are to be wings, some day.    106. Even when full-grown, the birds never fly much,--never more, says  Morris, \"than six or ten feet above the water, and for the most part  trailing their legs in it; but either on the water or under it, every  movement is characterized by the most consummate dexterity, and facile  agility. The most expert waterman that sculls his skiff on the Thames  or Isis, is but an humble and unskillful imitator of the dabchick. In  moving straightforward (under water?), the wings are used to aid its  progress, as if in the air, and in turning it has an easy gliding  motion, feet and wings being used, as occasion requires, sometimes on  one side and sometimes on the other. It walks but indifferently, as may  readily be imagined from the position of the legs, so very far back. It  is pleasant to watch the parent bird feeding her young: down she dives  with a quick turn, and presently rises again with, five times out of  six, a minnow, or other little fish, glittering like silver in her  bill. The young rush towards the spot where the mother has come up, but  she does not drop the fish into the water for them to receive until she  has well shaken it about and killed it, so that it may not escape, when  for the last time in its own element. I have seen a young one which had  just seized, out of its turn I have no doubt, the captured prey, chased  away by her, and pursued in apparent anger, as if for punishment, the  following one being willingly given the next fish without any demur.\"    107. Mr. Gould seems to think that the dabchick likes insects and fish  spawn better than fish, or at least more prudently dines upon them.  \"That fish are taken we have positive evidence from examples having  been repeatedly picked up dead by the fishermen of the Thames, with a  bull-head or miller's thumb in their throats, and by which they had  evidently been choked in the act of swallowing them. That it is  especially fond of insects is shown by the great activity it displays,  when in captivity, in capturing house-flies and other diptera. Those  who have visited Paris will probably have seen the grebes in the window  of the restaurateur in the Rue de Rivoli. For years have a pair of  these birds been living, apparently in the greatest enjoyment, within  the glass window, attracting the admiration of all the passers-by. The  extreme agility with which they sailed round their little prison, or  scrambled over the half-submerged piece of rock for a fly, was very  remarkable. That no bird can be more easily kept in a state of  confinement is certain.\"    108. This question about its food is closely connected with that of  its diving. So far as I understand Mr. Morris, it dives only when  disturbed, and to escape,--remaining under water, however, if need  be, an almost incredible time, and swimming underneath it to great  distances. Here we have, if we would only think of it, the same  question as that about the water-ouzel, how it _keeps down_; and  we must now note a few general points about diving birds altogether.    It is easy to understand how the properly so-called divers can plunge  with impetus to great depths, or keep themselves at the bottom by  continued strokes of the webbed feet; but neither how the ouzel walks  at the bottom, if it be specifically lighter than the water, nor how a  bird can swim horizontally under the surface; at least it is not enough  explained that the action must be always that of oblique diving, the  bird regulating the stroke according to the upward pressure of the  water at different depths.    109. But there are many other points needing elucidation. It is said  (and beautifully insisted on, by Michelet,) that great spaces in the  bones of birds that pass most of their lives in flight are filled with  air: presumably the bones of the divers are made comparatively solid,  or it is even conceivable--if conceptions or suppositions were of any  use,--that the deep divers may take in water, to help themselves to  sink. The enormous depths at which they have been caught, according to  report, cannot be reached by any mere effort of strength, if the body  remained as buoyant as it evidently is on the surface. The strength of  the wing must, however, be enormous, for the great northern diver is  described as swimming under water \"as it were with the velocity of an  arrow in the air\" (Yarrell, vol. iii., page 431); or to keep to more  measured fact, Sir William Jardine says, \"I have pursued this bird in a  Newhaven fishing-boat with four sturdy rowers, and notwithstanding it  was kept almost constantly under water by firing as soon as it  appeared, the boat could not succeed in making one yard upon it\"  (_ibid._, p. 432).    110. But this is followed by the amazing statement of Mr. Robert Dunn,  p. 433, that in the act of diving it does not appear to make the least  exertion, but sinks gradually under the surface, without throwing  itself forward, the head being the last part that disappears. I am not  fond of the word 'impossible,' but I think I am safe in saying that  according to the laws of nature no buoyant body can sink merely by an  act of volition; and that it must pull itself down by some hitherto  unconceived action of the feet, which in this bird are immensely broad  and strong, and so flat that it cannot walk with them, any more than we  could with two flat boards a yard square tied to our feet; but, when it  is caught on land, shoves its body along upon the ground, like a seal,  by jerks. All these diving motions are executed in a more delicate but  quite as wonderful way by the dabchick,--more wonderful indeed it may  be said, because it has only the divided or chestnut-leaf-like foot, to  strike with. We shall understand it perhaps a little better after  tracing, in a future talk, the history of its relations among the  smaller sea-gulls; meantime, in quitting the little dainty creature, I  must plead for a daintier Latin name than it has now--'Podiceps.' No  one seems to have the least idea what that means; and 'Colymbus,'  diver, must be kept for the great Northern Diver and his deep-sea  relatives, far removed from our little living ripple-line of the pools.  I can't think of any one pretty enough; but for the present 'Trepida'  may serve; and perhaps be applied, not improperly, to all the Grebes,  with reference to their subtle and instant escape from any sudden  danger. (See Stanley, p. 419.) \"It requires all the address of a keen  sportsman to get within shot,\" and when he does, the bird may still be  too shrewd for him. \"I fired at the distance of thirty yards; my gun  went quick as lightning, but the grebe went quicker, and scrambling  over, out of sight, came up again in a few seconds perfectly unhurt.\"    I think, therefore, that unless I receive some better suggestion,  'Trepida Stagnarum' may be the sufficiently intelligible Latin renaming  of our easily startled favorite.      IV.    TITANIA ARCTICA.    ARCTIC FAIRY.    111. I must first get quit of the confusion of names for this bird.  Linnaeus, in the Fauna Suecica, p. 64, calls it 'Tringa Lobata,' but  afterwards 'Northern Tringa'; and his editor, Gmelin, 'Dark Tringa.'  Other people agree to call it a 'phalarope,' but some of them  'northern' phalarope, some, the 'dark' phalarope; some, the 'ashy'  phalarope, some, the 'disposed to be ashy' phalarope; some, the  'red-necked' phalarope; and some, 'Mr. Williams's' phalarope; finally,  Cuvier calls it a 'Lobipes,' and Mr. Gould, in English, 'red-necked  phalarope.' Few people are likely to know what 'Phalarope' means,[24]  and I believe nobody knows what 'Tringa' means; and as, also, nobody  ever sees it, the little bird being obliged to live in Orkney,  Greenland, Norway, and Lapland, out of human creatures' way, I shall  myself call it the Arctic Fairy. It would come south if we would let  it, but of course Mr. Bond says, \"The first specimen I ever had was  shot by a friend of mine in September, 1842, near Southend, Essex,  where he saw the phalarope swimming on the water, like a little duck,  about a mile from land; not knowing what it was, he shot it, and kindly  brought it to me.\" Another was shot while running between the metals of  the Great Eastern Railway, near the Stratford station, early in June,  1852; and on the Norfolk coast, four others have been killed during the "]]]
