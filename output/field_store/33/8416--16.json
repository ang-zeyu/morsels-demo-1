Travis copied his silence in what was close to a duel of wills. There  was that in the shaman's narrowed green eyes which suggested that if  Hulagur did in fact lead these fighting men, he had an advisor of  determination and intelligence behind him.    \"This is Menlik.\" Kaydessa did not push past the men to the fireside,  but her voice carried.    Hulagur growled at his sister, but his admonition made no impression on  her, and she replied in as hot a tone. The shaman's hand went up,  silencing both of them.    \"You are--who?\" Like Kaydessa, Menlik spoke a heavily accented English.    \"I am Travis Fox, of the Apaches.\"    \"The Apaches,\" the shaman repeated. \"You are of the West, the American  West, then.\"    \"You know much, man of spirit talk.\"    \"One remembers. At times one remembers,\" Menlik answered almost  absently. \"How does an Apache find his way across the stars?\"    \"The same way Menlik and his people did,\" Travis returned. \"You were  sent to settle this planet, and so were we.\"    \"There are many more of you?\" countered Menlik swiftly.    \"Are there not many of the Horde? Would one man, or three, or four, be  sent to hold a world?\" Travis fenced. \"You hold the north, we the south  of this land.\"    \"But _they_ are not governed by a machine!\" Kaydessa cut in. \"They are  free!\"    Menlik frowned at the girl. \"Woman, this is a matter for warriors. Keep  your tongue silent between your jaws!\"    She stamped one foot, standing with her fists on her hips.    \"I am a Daughter of the Blue Wolf. And we are all warriors--men and  women alike--so shall we be as long as the Horde is not free to ride  where we wish! These men have won their freedom; it is well that we  learn how.\"    Menlik's expression did not change, but his lids drooped over his eyes  as a murmur of what might be agreement came from the group. More than  one of them must have understood enough English to translate for the  others. Travis wondered about that. Had these men and women who had  outwardly reverted to the life of their nomad ancestors once been well  educated in the modern sense, educated enough to learn the basic  language of the nation their rulers had set up as their principal enemy?    \"So you ride the land south of the mountains?\" the shaman continued.    \"That is true.\"    \"Then why did you come hither?\"    Travis shrugged. \"Why does anyone ride or travel into new lands? There  is a desire to see what may lie beyond----\"    \"Or to scout before the march of warriors!\" Menlik snapped. \"There is no  peace between your rulers and mine. Do you ride now to take the herds  and pastures of the Horde--or to try to do so?\"    Travis turned his head deliberately from side to side, allowing them all  to witness his slow and openly contemptuous appraisal of their camp.    \"_This_ is your Horde, Shaman? Fifteen warriors? Much has changed since  the days of Temujin, has it not?\"    \"What do you know of Temujin--you, who are a man of no ancestors, out of  the West?\"    \"What do I know of Temujin? That he was a leader of warriors and became  Genghis Khan, the great lord of the East. But the Apaches had their  warlords also, rider of barren lands. And I am of those who raided over  two nations when Victorio and Cochise scattered their enemies as a man  scatters a handful of dust in the wind.\"    \"You talk bold, Apache....\" There was a hint of threat in that.    \"I speak as any warrior, Shaman. Or are you so used to talking with  spirits instead of men that you do not realize that?\"    He might have been alienating the shaman by such a sharp reply, but  Travis thought he judged the temper of these people. To face them boldly  was the only way to impress them. They would not treat with an inferior,  and he was already at a disadvantage coming on foot, without any backing  in force, into a territory held by horsemen who were suspicious and  jealous of their recently acquired freedom. His only chance was to  establish himself as an equal and then try to convince them that Apache  and Tatar-Mongol had a common cause against the Reds who controlled the  settlement on the northern plains.    Menlik's right hand went to his sash-girdle and plucked out a carved  stick which he waved between them, muttering phrases Travis could not  understand. Had the shaman retreated so far along the road to his past  that he now believed in his own supernatural powers? Or was this to  impress his watching followers?    \"You call upon your spirits for aid, Menlik? But the Apache has the  companionship of the _ga-n_. Ask of Kaydessa: Who hunts with the Fox in  the wilds?\" Travis' sharp challenge stopped that wand in mid-air.  Menlik's head swung to the girl.    \"He hunts with wolves who think like men.\" She supplied the information  the shaman would not openly ask for. \"I have seen them act as his  scouts. This is no spirit thing, but real and of this world!\"    \"Any man may train a dog to his bidding!\" Menlik spat.    \"Does a dog obey orders which are not said aloud? These brown wolves  come and sit before him, look into his eyes. And then he knows what lies  within their heads, and they know what he would have them do. This is  not the way of a master of hounds with his pack!\"    Again the murmur ran about the camp as one or two translated. Menlik  frowned. Then he rammed his sorcerer's wand back into his sash.    \"If you are a man of power--such powers,\" he said slowly, \"then you may  walk alone where those who talk with spirits go--into the mountains.\" He  then spoke over his shoulder in his native tongue, and one of the women  reached behind her into a hut, brought out a skin bag and a horn cup.  Kaydessa took the cup from her and held it while the other woman poured  a white liquid from the bag to fill it.    Kaydessa passed the cup to Menlik. He pivoted with it in his hand,  dribbling expertly over its brim a few drops at each point of the  compass, chanting as he moved. Then he sucked in a mouthful of the  contents before presenting the vessel to Travis.    The Apache smelled the same sour scent that had clung to the emptied bag  in the foothills. And another part of memory supplied him with the  nature of the drink. This was kumiss, a fermented mare's milk which was  the wine and water of the steppes.    He forced himself to swallow a draft, though it was alien to his taste,  and passed the cup back to Menlik. The shaman emptied the horn and,  with that, set aside ceremony. With an upraised hand he beckoned Travis  to the fire again, indicating a pot set on the coals.    \"Rest ... eat!\" he bade abruptly.    Night was gathering in. Travis tried to calculate how far Tsoay must  have backtracked to the rancheria. He thought that he could have already  made the pass and be within a day and a half from the Apache camp if he  pushed on, as he would. As to where the coyotes were, Travis had no  idea. But it was plain that he himself must remain in this encampment  for the night or risk rousing the Mongols' suspicion once more.    He ate of the stew, spearing chunks out of the pot with the point of his  knife. And it was not until he sat back, his hunger appeased, that the  shaman dropped down beside him.    \"The Khatun Kaydessa says that when she was slave to the caller, you did  not feel its chains,\" he began.    \"Those who rule you are not my overlords. The bonds they set upon your  minds do not touch me.\" Travis hoped that that was the truth and his  escape that morning had not been just a fluke.    \"This could be, for you and I are not of one blood,\" Menlik agreed.  \"Tell me--how did you escape your bonds?\"    \"The machine which held us so was broken,\" Travis replied with a portion  of the truth, and Menlik sucked in his breath.    \"The machines, always the machines!\" he cried hoarsely. \"A thing which  can sit in a man's head and make him do what it will against his will;  it is demon sent! There are other machines to be broken, Apache.\"    \"Words will not break them,\" Travis pointed out.    \"Only a fool rides to his death without hope of striking a single blow  before he chokes on the blood in his throat,\" Menlik retorted. \"We  cannot use bow or tulwar against weapons which flame and kill quicker  than any storm lightning! And always the mind machines can make a man  drop his knife and stand helplessly waiting for the slave collar to be  set on his neck!\"    Travis asked a question of his own. \"I know that they can bring a caller  part way into this mountain, for this very day I saw its effect upon the  maiden. But there are many places in the hills well set for ambushes,  and those unaffected by the machine could be waiting there. Would there  be many machines so that they could send out again and again?\"    Menlik's bony hand played with his wand. Then a slow smile curved his  lips into the guise of a hunting cat's noiseless snarl.    \"There is meat in that pot, Apache, rich meat, good for the filling of a  lean belly! So men whose minds the machine could not trouble--such men  to be waiting in ambush for the taking of the men who use such a  machine--yes. But here would have to be bait, very good bait for such a  trap, Lord of Wiles. Never do those others come far into the mountains.  Their flyer does not lift well here, and they do not trust traveling on  horseback. They were greatly angered to come so far in to reach  Kaydessa, though they could not have been too close, or you would not  have escaped at all. Yes, strong bait.\"    \"Such bait as perhaps the knowledge that there were strangers across the  mountains?\"    Menlik turned his wand about in his hands. He was no longer smiling, and  his glance at Travis was sharp and swift.    \"Do you sit as Khan in your tribe, Lord?\"    \"I sit as one they will listen to.\" Travis hoped that was so.

For she was perfectly beautiful; eye had never seen  nor ear heard of such loveliness. With a low bow full of pride and an  ironical smile he was saying to her: \"Beauteous princess, you have  sworn a most solemn oath to marry none but that man who can solve your  six riddles. It is in vain that I strive to guess them. Now there are  only two courses open to you: either to release yourself from your  vow, putting the riddles aside and consenting to be my wife; or to  persist in your vow and thus deliver yourself up to my anger, which  you will bitterly regret. I give you three minutes to decide.\"    [Illustration]    Upon hearing these threats the fisherman trembled with rage, and in a  low voice whispered the magic words to his club.    This good weapon did not wait for the order to be repeated, but with  one bound came down full upon Kostey's forehead. Stunned for a moment  by the violence of the blow, the terrible creature rolled upon the  ground. Sparks like fireworks sprang from his eyes, and the noise as  of a hundred mills seemed to go through his head. Any ordinary mortal  would never have opened his eyes again, but Kostey was immortal.    Getting on his feet he pulled himself together, and tried to find out  who had thus attacked him. Then the club began to hit him again, and  the sound thereof was like unto blows on an empty vault. It seemed to  the magician as if showers of boiling water were being poured upon  him. He twisted himself about in awful convulsions, and would have  liked to bury himself in his palace walls and be turned to stone.    At last, crippled with wounds, he began to hiss like a serpent, and  springing forwards breathed upon the princess, filling the air with  the poisonous blast.    The maiden tottered and fell, as if dead. Kostey changed himself into  a wreath of smoke, and floating out of the window, disappeared in a  hurricane.    The fisherman, still invisible, carried the princess into the  courtyard of the castle, hoping that the fresh air might restore her  to consciousness. He laid her upon the grass, his heart throbbing with  hope and fear, and waited anxiously. Suddenly a raven and his  nestlings, attracted by the sight of a dead body, and not being able  to see the fisherman, came by croaking. The parent bird said to his  young ones:      \"Come, children, sharpen claws and beak, krak, krak,    For here's a feast not far to seek, krak, krak,    This young girl's corse so white and sleek, krak, krak.\"    One small bird at once settled down on the princess, but the fisherman  seized it and took off his cap, so that he could be seen.    \"Fisherman,\" said the father raven, \"let go my dear birdling and I  will give you anything you want.\"    \"Then bring me some of the Life-Giving Water.\"    The raven flew away and returned in about an hour, carrying in his  beak a tiny bottle of the water. Then he again begged to have his  nestling back.    \"You shall have it as soon as I have proved that the water is of the  right sort.\"    So saying, he sprinkled the pale face of the princess. She sighed,  opened her eyes, and blushing at the sight of a stranger, got up and  said, \"Where am I? Why, how soundly I have slept!\"    \"Lovely princess, your sleep might have lasted for ever.\"    Then he told her his story, how he had been thrown into the river,  abandoned in the Valley of Diamonds, and so on, relating at full  length all the marvellous events that had taken place.    She listened attentively, then, thanking him for all he had done for  her, placed her hand in his and said, \"In the garden behind the palace  is an apple-tree that bears golden fruit. A guzla that plays of its  own accord hangs on its branches, and is guarded day and night by four  negroes. Now the music from this guzla has the wonderful power of  restoring health to invalids who listen to it, and happiness to those  who are sad. That which is ugly becomes beautiful, and charms and  enchantments of all kinds are broken and destroyed for ever.\"    The fisherman put on his invisible cap and went into the garden in  search of the negroes. Before going up to them he addressed the magic  words to his golden ring, and after a short thunderstorm a shower of  gold covered the ground. The negroes, greedy of wealth, threw  themselves upon it, snatching from each other handfuls of the golden  rain. While thus engaged the fisherman unhooked the guzla from the  branches and hurried off into the courtyard with it. There he unfolded  his carpet, and sitting down upon it with the princess at his side,  flew high up into the air. He had not forgotten to bring with him the  cap, the club, and the ring; the princess took care of the guzla.    They floated across the blue sky, above the rustling forests and under  the clouds, and in a few days arrived at the palace. There they  descended, but the people still lay wrapped in the enchanted sleep,  from which they seemed to have no power of awakening.    The silence of the tomb reigned around. Some of the officers were  sitting, others standing, all motionless and rigid, and each one in  the position he occupied when last awake. The king held a goblet  filled with wine, for he had been giving a toast. The chamberlain had  his throat half filled with a lying tale, which there had been no time  to finish. One had the end of a joke upon his lips, another a dainty  morsel between his teeth, or a tale ready cooked upon his tongue.    And it was the same in all the villages throughout the length and  breadth of the land. All the inhabitants lay under the enchanted  spell. The labourer held his whip in the air, for he had been about to  strike his oxen. The harvesters with their sickles had stopped short  in their work. The shepherds slept by their sheep in the middle of the  road. The huntsman stood with the powder still alight on the pan of  his gun. The birds, arrested in their flight, hung in mid-air. The  animals in the woods were motionless. The water in the streams was  still. Even the wind slept. Everywhere men had been overtaken in their  occupations or amusements. It was a soundless land, without voice or  movement; on all sides calm, death, sleep.    The fisherman stood with the princess at his side in the  banqueting-hall where slept the king and his guests. Taking the magic  guzla from the maid, he pronounced these words:      \"O guzla, play, and let thy sweetest harmonies resound    Through hall and cot, o'er hill and dale, and all the country round;    That by the power and beauty of thy heavenly tones and song    Awakened may these sleepers be who sleep too well, too long.\"    When the first tones of music burst forth everything began to move and  live again. The king finished proposing his toast. The chamberlain  ended his tale. The guests continued to feast and enjoy themselves.  The servants waited at their posts. In short, everything went on just  as before, and as if nothing had happened to interrupt it.    And it was just the same in all the country round. Everything suddenly  awoke to life. The labourer finished ploughing his furrow. The  haymakers built up the hay in ricks. The reapers cut down the golden  grain. The hunter's gun went off and shot the duck. The trees rustled.  The gardener went on with his work and his song. The rich, who thought  only of enjoyment, entertained one another in luxury and splendour.    Now when the king caught sight of his daughter leaning on the  fisherman's arm he could hardly believe his own eyes, and it made him  very angry. But the princess ran to him, and throwing herself in his  arms, related all that he had accomplished. The monarch's heart was  softened, and he felt ashamed. With tears in his eyes he drew the  fisherman towards him, and before the assembled company thanked him  for having the third time saved his life.    \"God has punished me for my ill-treatment of you,\" said he. \"Yet He is  generous and forgives; I will fulfil all your wishes.\"    He then added that the wedding feast should be held that very day, and  that his only daughter would be married to the fisherman.    The princess was filled with gladness, and standing with her father's  arms round her, said, \"I cannot, however, break my word. When in  Kostey's palace I made a vow to bestow my hand only on that man who  should guess the six riddles I put to him. I am sure the heroic man,  who has done so much, will not refuse to submit to this last trial for  my sake.\"    To this the fisherman bowed a willing assent.    The first riddle was: \"Without legs it walks. Without arms it strikes.  Without life it moves continually.\"    \"A clock,\" he answered promptly, and to the great satisfaction of the  princess, to whom this good beginning seemed to presage a happy  ending.    The second riddle ran thus: \"Without being either bird, reptile,  insect, or any animal whatsoever, it ensures the safety of the whole  house.\"    \"A bolt,\" said her lover.    \"Good! Now this is the third: 'Who is that pedestrian who walks fully  armed, seasons dishes, and in his sides has two darts? He swims across  the water without the help of a boatman.'\"    \"A lobster.\"    The princess clapped her hands and begged him to guess the fourth.    \"It runs, it moves along on two sides, it has but one eye, an overcoat  of polished steel, and a tail of thread.\"    \"A needle.\"    \"Well guessed. Now listen to the fifth: 'It walks without feet,  beckons without hands, and moves without a body.'\"    \"It must be a shadow.\"    \"Exactly,\" said she, well pleased. \"Now you have succeeded so well  with these five you will soon guess the sixth: 'It has four feet, but  is not an animal. It is provided with feathers and down, but is no  bird. It has a body, and gives warmth, but is not alive.'\"    \"It is certainly a bed,\" exclaimed the fisherman.    The princess gave him her hand. They both knelt at the king's feet and  received his fatherly blessing, after which he with a large wedding "]]]
