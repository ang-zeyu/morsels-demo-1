[36] It is a curious fact that Morin had about this time proposed       to determine the longitude by the moon's distance from a fixed       star, and that the commissioners assembled in Paris to examine it       requested Galileo's opinion of its value and practicability.       Galileo's opinion was highly unfavourable. He saw clearly, and       explained distinctly, the objection to Morin's method, arising from       the imperfection of the lunar tables, and the inadequacy of       astronomical instruments; but he seemed not to be conscious that       the very same objections applied with even greater force to his own       method, which has since been supplanted by that of the French       savant. See Life of Galileo, Library of Useful Knowledge, p. 94.    It was at this time that Galileo was struck with blindness. His friend  and pupil, Renieri, undertook in this emergency to arrange and complete  his observations and calculations; but before he had made much progress  in the arduous task, each of the four commissioners died in succession,  and it was with great difficulty that Constantine Huygens succeeded in  renewing the scheme. It was again obstructed, however, by the death of  Galileo; and when Renieri was about to publish, by the order of the  Grand Duke, the \"Ephemeris,\" and \"Tables of the Jovian Planets,\" he was  attacked with a mortal disease, and the manuscripts of Galileo, which he  was on the eve of publishing, were never more heard of. By such a series  of misfortunes were the plans of Galileo and of the States-General  completely overthrown. It is some consolation, however, to know that  neither science nor navigation suffered any severe loss. Notwithstanding  the perfection of our present tables of Jupiter's satellites, and of the  astronomical instruments by which their eclipses may be observed, the  method of Galileo is still impracticable at sea.    In consequence of the strict seclusion to which Galileo had been  subjected, he was in the practice of dating his letters from his prison  at Arcetri; but after he had lost the use of his eyes, the Inquisition  seems to have relaxed its severity, and to have allowed him the freest  intercourse with his friends. The Grand Duke of Tuscany paid him  frequent visits; and among the celebrated strangers who came from  distant lands to see the ornament of Italy, were Gassendi, Deodati, and  our illustrious countryman Milton. During the last three years of his  life, his eminent pupil Viviani formed one of his family; and in October  1641, the celebrated Torricelli, another of his pupils, was admitted to  the same distinction.    Though the powerful mind of Galileo still retained its vigour, yet his  debilitated frame was exhausted with mental labour. He often complained  that his head was too busy for his body; and the continuity of his  studies was frequently broken with attacks of hypochondria, want of  sleep, and acute rheumatic pains. Along with these calamities, he was  afflicted with another still more severe--with deafness almost total;  but though he was now excluded from all communication with the external  world, yet his mind still grappled with the material universe, and while  he was studying the force of percussion, and preparing for a  continuation of his \"Dialogues on Motion,\" he was attacked with fever  and palpitation of the heart, which, after continuing two months,  terminated fatally on the 8th of January 1642, in the 78th year of his  age.    Having died in the character of a prisoner of the Inquisition, this  odious tribunal disputed his right of making a will, and of being buried  in consecrated ground. These objections, however, were withdrawn; but  though a large sum was subscribed for erecting a monument to him in the  church of Santa Croce, in Florence, the Pope would not permit the design  to be carried into execution. His sacred remains were, therefore,  deposited in an obscure corner of the church, and remained for more than  thirty years unmarked with any monumental tablet. The following epitaph,  given without any remark in the Leyden edition of his Dialogues, is, we  presume, the one which was inscribed on a tablet in the church of Santa  Croce:--                       GALILAEO GALILAEI Florentino,               Philosopho et Geometrae vere lynceo,                          Naturae Oedipo,            Mirabilium semper inventorum machinatori,              Qui inconcessa adhuc mortalibus gloria                     Caelorum provincias auxit                  Et universo dedit incrementum:                 Non enim vitreos spherarum orbes                  Fragilesque stellas conflavit:                     Sed aeterna mundi corpore                 Mediceae beneficentiae dedicavit,                Cujus inextincta gloriae cupiditas                        Ut oculos nationum                       Saeculorumque omnium                         Videre doceret,                    Proprios impendit oculos.                Cum jam nil amplius haberet natura                        Quod ipse videret.        Cujus inventa vix intra rerum limites comprehensa              Firmamentum ipsum non solum continet,                        Sed etiam recipit.             Qui relictis tot scientiarum monumentis                Plura secum tulit, quam reliquit.                            Gravi enim                  Sed nondum affecta senectute,                     Novis contemplationibus                    Majorem gloriam affectans                  Inexplebilem sapientiae animam                       Immaturo nobis obitu                            Exhalavit                           Anno Domini                             MCXLII.                            AEtatis suae                             LXXVIII.        At his death, in 1703, Viviani purchased his property, with the charge  of erecting a monument over Galileo's remains and his own. This design  was not carried into effect till 1737, at the expense of the family of  Nelli, when both their bodies were disinterred, and removed to the site  of the splendid monument which now covers them. This monument contains  the bust of Galileo, with figures of Geometry and Astronomy. It was  designed by Giulio Foggini. Galileo's bust was executed by Giovanni  Battista Foggini; the figure of Astronomy by Vincenzio Foggini, his son;  and that of Geometry by Girolamo Ticciati.    Galileo's house at Arcetri still remains. In 1821 it belonged to one  Signor Alimari, having been preserved in the state in which it was left  by Galileo; it stands very near the convent of St Matthew, and about a  mile to the S. E. of Florence. An inscription by Nelli, over the door of  the house, still remains.    The character of Galileo, whether we view him as a member of the social  circle, or as a man of science, presents many interesting and  instructive points of contemplation. Unfortunate, and to a certain  extent immoral, in his domestic relations, he did not derive from that  hallowed source all the enjoyments which it generally yields; and it was  owing to this cause, perhaps, that he was more fond of society than  might have been expected from his studious habits. His habitual  cheerfulness and gaiety, and his affability and frankness of manner,  rendered him an universal favourite among his friends. Without any of  the pedantry of exclusive talent, and without any of that ostentation  which often marks the man of limited though profound acquirements,  Galileo never conversed upon scientific or philosophical subjects except  among those who were capable of understanding them. The extent of his  general information, indeed, his great literary knowledge, but, above  all, his retentive memory, stored with the legends and the poetry of  ancient times, saved him from the necessity of drawing upon his own  peculiar studies for the topics of his conversation.    Galileo was not less distinguished for his hospitality and benevolence;  he was liberal to the poor, and generous in the aid which he  administered to men of genius and talent, who often found a comfortable  asylum under his roof. In his domestic economy he was frugal without  being parsimonious. His hospitable board was ever ready for the  reception of his friends; and, though he was himself abstemious in his  diet, he seems to have been a lover of good wines, of which he received  always the choicest varieties out of the Grand Duke's cellar. This  peculiar taste, together with his attachment to a country life, rendered  him fond of agricultural pursuits, and induced him to devote his leisure  hours to the cultivation of his vineyards.    In his personal appearance Galileo was about the middle size, and of a  square-built, but well-proportioned, frame. His complexion was fair, his  eyes penetrating, and his hair of a reddish hue. His expression was  cheerful and animated, and though his temper was easily ruffled, yet the  excitement was transient, and the cause of it speedily forgotten.    One of the most prominent traits in the character of Galileo was his  invincible love of truth, and his abhorrence of that spiritual despotism  which had so long brooded over Europe. His views, however, were too  liberal, and too far in advance of the age which he adorned; and however  much we may admire the noble spirit which he evinced, and the personal  sacrifices which he made, in his struggle for truth, we must yet lament  the hotness of his zeal and the temerity of his onset. In his contest  with the Church of Rome, he fell under her victorious banner; and though  his cause was that of truth, and hers that of superstition, yet the  sympathy of Europe was not roused by his misfortunes. Under the  sagacious and peaceful sway of Copernicus, astronomy had effected a  glorious triumph over the dogmas of the Church; but under the bold and  uncompromising sceptre of Galileo all her conquests were irrecoverably  lost.    The scientific character of Galileo, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26014"],[0,"Practical Taxidermy (#15)"],[1,"use camphor in museums under the  idea that it drives away moths?    Perhaps it will be as well to point out secundum artem the pros and  cons for the use of arsenic.    ARSENICAL PASTE.    Advantages claimed.                          Disadvantages.    A perfect dryer of              Will often \"sweat\" skins, especially    animal tissue.              those of mammals, for which it is useless.    Keeps all things free             Is not of the slightest use for  from attack of insects.                    this purpose.    Easier to make and use                        Denied.  than any other preparation.    Gives off poisonous fumes  when hot.    Deposits metallic  arsenic when drying.    Gives off poisonous dust  when thoroughly dry.    Causes colds, coughs, etc,  which turn to bronchitis,  paralysis, etc.    Having now summed up in the case of Common Sense versus Arsenic, I  challenge contradiction to any of my statements, and ask, Why use a  dangerous and inefficient preservative agent, when a harmless  preservative, and that quite as good worker and dryer as arsenic, will  suffice? I have invented a soap for which I claim those advantages,  and as to its deterrent principle re insects, I am convinced that it  is quite as good as the other, for is there any one thing  known--compatible with clean-looking work--that will prevent the  ravages of the maggots in birds' skins? I answer, No!--if we except  one thing, too dangerous to handle--bichloride of mercury, of which  anon. Let me whisper a little fact, and blow the poison theory to the  winds: The real secret of success is to case your specimens up as soon  as practicable, or to keep them always in full light, not poking them  away in obscure corners, which the Tineidae and other pests  love--hating light as the Father of Evil is said to hate holy water.    My Preservative formula is as follows:    No. 4.--Brown's (Non poisonous) Preservative Soap.    Whiting or chalk,         2.5 lb.    Chloride of lime,         2 oz.    Soft soap,                1 lb.    Tincture of musk,         1 oz.    Boil together the whiting and the soap with about a pint of water;  then stir in the chloride of lime (previously finely pounded) while  the mixture is hot; if this point is not attended to, the mixture will  not work smoothly; when nearly cool, stir in the tincture of musk.  This will about fill a 6 lb. Australian meat tin. Caution: It is not  necessary to hold the mouth over the mixture while hot, as chlorine is  then rapidly evolved. This mixture has stood the test of work and  time, and I therefore confidently bring it to the notice of the public  as completely superseding the arsenical paste or soap for small  mammals and all birds; indeed, numbers of persons, totally unknown to  me, have written to me about its advantages.    One says: \"I have followed the bird-stuffing now for several years in  connection with another trade, but I have never seen anything to touch  it before. I have quite given up arsenic, and can get on fine without  it, and only wish that I had known the grand secret before.\"    Another: \"Your recipe for preservative unction (non-poisonous) is  simply invaluable to taxidermists. I have been trying for a long time  to make a non-poisonous unction, but never fairly succeeded; always  had a doubt as to their efficacy, prejudice had something to do with  it.\"    A third says: \"I have tried your recipe, and am well satisfied of its  qualities for preserving skins, having tried Swainson's, and  Becoeur's, and yours, and after a twelvemonth have relaxed the skins,  and give my favour to yours as a toughener of the skin.\"    None of the above correspondents are known tome, and their opinion was  sent unasked. Those people I do know who are using it are perfectly  satisfied, as I myself am after a constant use of it for the past  seven years. I find that skins dressed by it are not \"burned,\" as some  people may think, but relax most perfectly after a lapse of years by  any method, even by the water process spoken of hereafter. I do not  think it any better or worse than the arsenical preparations for  preventing the attacks of insects, but the addition of tincture of  musk (a lasting perfume) has seemed to me to be a great gain. One  person wrote to me stating his opinion that the lime unduly corroded  the wires used in setting up. I believe this might happen in cases  where the mixture was used in a more fluid state than directed,  namely, as a paste of a creamy consistence. I know of no evil effects  produced.    Of course the mixture, if kept exposed, dries up in time, and is then  best wetted with a little warm water, into which a few drops of  tincture of musk have been stirred. Where there is more fat or flesh  than usual, say, on the inside of the wings, or on the leg bones, or  inside the mouth, a small quantity of carbolic acid wash (Formula No.  16) will be found useful to dilute the preservative paste. Carbolic  acid, however weak, must not be used on the thin parts of the skin of  small mammals or birds, as it dries and shrivels them up so quickly as  to seriously interfere with subsequent modelling.    Though many insects eat the skin itself, yet how is it possible to  guard against insects which attack the feathers only of birds (as the  most minute species of the little pests do) by an agent which  professedly cures the skin only? I remember once seeing the most  comical sight possible, a stuffed cock and hen entirely denuded of  feathers by thousands of a minute tines, their dry skins only left;  they were as parchment effigies of their former selves. Difficult as  the matter is, I yet hope to show both amateurs and professionals how  to considerably increase the chances of preservation. It is this:  After using the soap, and having the mammal arranged or bird stuffed  ready for \"cottoning,\" brush over the whole of the feathers, legs,  toes, and beak, with the following preparation:    No. 5.--Waterton's Solution of Corrosive Sublimate.    To a wine-bottleful of spirits of wine add a large teaspoonful of  corrosive sublimate; in twelve hours draw it off into a clean bottle,  dip a black feather into the solution, and if, on drying, a whiteness  is left on the feather, add a little more alcohol.    Care must be taken not to handle the bird more than absolutely  necessary after this operation, for reasons which I will give below  when speaking of the following recipe, which I have extracted from a  little book professedly written by a well-known taxidermist, though I  believe he knew nothing at all about it until it was published.    The preparation referred to, which should be labelled \"Dangerous! Not  to be used!\" is as follows:    No. 6.--Gardner's Preservative.    Arsenic, 6 oz.    Camphor, 1 oz.    Corrosive sublimate, 3 oz.    Spirits of wine, 0.5 pint.    Yellow soap, 2 oz.    \"Put all these ingredients in a pipkin, which place over a slow fire,  stirring the mixture briskly till the several parts are dissolved and  form one homogeneous mass. This may then be poured into a wide-mouthed  bottle and allowed to stand till quite cold, when it will be ready for  use. Of course, these quantities may be increased or decreased  according to the size of the animal to be operated on; but the  proportions here given must be preserved.\"    Did it ever occur to the gifted author of this that stirring camphor  and spirits of wine briskly over a slow fire would be as quick a way  as could be invented of summoning the fire brigade; also, that nine  ounces of poison to eleven ounces of other ingredients, well worked  into the hands at different times, as it must be, when handling, or  returning skins painted with it, would not tend to lengthen the life  of the learner? Corrosive sublimate being a mercurial preparation--i.e,  bichloride of mercury--I ask any chemist amongst my readers what  effect three ounces of that dangerous preparation, six ounces of  arsenic, yellow soap, and spirits of wine would have upon the  constitution? Would it not be readily absorbed through the hands  into the system? and next comes salivation, and then--the last scene  of all!    Yet another little treat for the amateur desirous of committing  suicide under the transparent pretence of studying taxidermy. This,  which I have culled from the pages of \"Maunders' Treasury of Natural  History,\" is, by a fine irony, entitled Bullock's \"Preservative\"  Powder:    No. 7.--Bullock's Preservative Powder.    Arsenic,             1 lb.    Camphor,             0.5 lb.    Burnt alum,          1 lb.    Tincture of musk,     12 oz.    Tanners' bark         2 lb.    \"Mix the whole thoroughly, and after reducing it to a powder pass it  through a sieve. Keep in close tin canisters. This powder is more  particularly adapted to fill up incisions made in the naked parts of  quadrupeds and the skulls of large birds. It has been strongly  recommended to us, but, being perfectly satisfied with our own, we  have never tried it.\"    With regard to the foregoing composition I have a few words to say,  which are these, that the reason I have copied it is that I have met  with it in more books than one, and I wish therefore to call special  attention to it, that it may be labelled \"Dangerous,\" and that anyone  using it will do so at his peril. Fancy shaking arsenic up in a sieve,  and afterwards dusting it in con amore! Really, if people will use  poisons, and others put themselves to considerable pains to invent the  most deadly compounds for them, is it not criminal carelessness that  such things should be published without a word of warning as to their  character or effects?    Powders, as a rule, being made of astringents, dry the skin too  quickly (especially if a bird is being operated on) to perfectly shape  the specimen. As they are useful, however, to fill up and quickly dry  cavities in the wings, and such like, of large birds, etc, and in some  cases even to prepare a skin for future"]]]
