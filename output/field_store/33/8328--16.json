Haec ait, et partis animum versabat in omnis,    invisam quaerens quam primum abrumpere lucem.    Tum breviter Barcen nutricem adfata Sychaei;    namque suam patria antiqua cinis ater habebat:    'Annam cara mihi nutrix huc siste sororem;    dic corpus properet fluviali spargere lympha,    et pecudes secum et monstrata piacula ducat:    sic veniat; tuque ipsa pia tege tempora vitta.    Sacra Iovi Stygio, quae rite incepta paravi,    perficere est animus, finemque imponere curis,    Dardaniique rogum capitis permittere flammae.'    Sic ait:  illa gradum studio celerabat anili.    At trepida, et coeptis immanibus effera Dido,    sanguineam volvens aciem, maculisque trementis    interfusa genas, et pallida morte futura,    interiora domus inrumpit limina, et altos    conscendit furibunda rogos, ensemque recludit    Dardanium, non hos quaesitum munus in usus.    Hic, postquam Iliacas vestes notumque cubile    conspexit, paulum lacrimis et mente morata,    incubuitque toro, dixitque novissima verba:    'Dulces exuviae, dum fata deusque sinebant,    accipite hanc animam, meque his exsolvite curis.    Vixi, et, quem dederat cursum fortuna, peregi,    et nunc magna mei sub terras ibit imago.    Urbem praeclaram statui; mea moenia vidi;    ulta virum, poenas inimico a fratre recepi;    felix, heu nimium felix, si litora tantum    numquam Dardaniae tetigissent nostra carinae!'    Dixit, et, os impressa toro, 'Moriemur inultae,    sed moriamur' ait.  'Sic, sic iuvat ire sub umbras:    Hauriat hunc oculis ignem crudelis ab alto    Dardanus, et nostrae secum ferat omina mortis.'    Dixerat; atque illam media inter talia ferro    conlapsam aspiciunt comites, ensemque cruore    spumantem, sparsasque manus.  It clamor ad alta    atria; concussam bacchatur Fama per urbem.    Lamentis gemituque et femineo ululatu    tecta fremunt; resonat magnis plangoribus aether,    non aliter, quam si immissis ruat hostibus omnis    Karthago aut antiqua Tyros, flammaeque furentes    culmina perque hominum volvantur perque deorum.    Audiit exanimis, trepidoque exterrita cursu    unguibus ora soror foedans et pectora pugnis    per medios ruit, ac morientem nomine clamat:    'Hoc illud, germana, fuit?  Me fraude petebas?    Hoc rogus iste mihi, hoc ignes araeque parabant?    Quid primum deserta querar?  Comitemne sororem    sprevisti moriens?  Eadem me ad fata vocasses:    idem ambas ferro dolor, atque eadem hora tulisset.    His etiam struxi manibus, patriosque vocavi    voce deos, sic te ut posita crudelis abessem?    Exstinxti te meque, soror, populumque patresque    Sidonios urbemque tuam.  Date volnera lymphis    abluam, et, extremus si quis super halitus errat,    ore legam.'  Sic fata, gradus evaserat altos,    semianimemque sinu germanam amplexa fovebat    cum gemitu, atque atros siccabat veste cruores.    Illa, graves oculos conata attollere, rursus    deficit; infixum stridit sub pectore vulnus.    Ter sese attollens cubitoque adnixa levavit;    ter revoluta toro est, oculisque errantibus alto    quaesivit caelo lucem, ingemuitque reperta.      Tum Iuno omnipotens, longum miserata dolorem    difficilisque obitus, Irim demisit Olympo,    quae luctantem animam nexosque resolveret artus.    Nam quia nec fato, merita nec morte peribat,    sed misera ante diem, subitoque accensa furore,    nondum illi flavum Proserpina vertice crinem    abstulerat, Stygioque caput damnaverat Orco.    Ergo Iris croceis per caelum roscida pennis,    mille trahens varios adverso sole colores,    devolat, et supra caput adstitit:  'Hunc ego Diti    sacrum iussa fero, teque isto corpore solvo.'    Sic ait, et dextra crinem secat:  omnis et una    dilapsus calor, atque in ventos vita recessit.            PUBLI VERGILI MARONIS      AENEIDOS      LIBER V      INTEREA medium Aeneas iam classe tenebat    certus iter, fluctusque atros Aquilone secabat,    moenia respiciens, quae iam infelicis Elissae    conlucent flammis.  Quae tantum accenderit ignem,    causa latet; duri magno sed amore dolores    polluto, notumque, furens quid femina possit,    triste per augurium Teucrorum pectora ducunt.    Ut pelagus tenuere rates, nec iam amplius ulla    occurrit tellus, maria undique et undique caelum,    olli caeruleus supra caput adstitit imber,    noctem hiememque ferens, et inhorruit unda tenebris.    Ipse gubernator puppi Palinurus ab alta:    'Heu! quianam tanti cinxerunt aethera nimbi?    Quidve, pater Neptune, paras?' Sic deinde locutus    colligere arma iubet validisque incumbere remis,    obliquatque sinus in ventum, ac talia fatur:    'Magnanime Aenea, non, si mihi Iuppiter auctor    spondeat, hoc sperem Italiam contingere caelo.    Mutati transversa fremunt et vespere ab atro    consurgunt venti, atque in nubem cogitur aer.    Nec nos obniti contra, nec tendere tantum    sufficimus.  Superat quoniam Fortuna, sequamur,    quoque vocat, vertamus iter.  Nec litora longe    fida reor fraterna Erycis portusque Sicanos,    si modo rite memor servata remetior astra.'    Tum pius Aeneas:  'Equidem sic poscere ventos    iamdudum et frustra cerno te tendere contra:    Flecte viam velis.  An sit mihi gratior ulla,    quove magis fessas optem demittere naves,    quam quae Dardanium tellus mihi servat Acesten,    et patris Anchisae gremio complectitur ossa?'    Haec ubi dicta, petunt portus, et vela secundi    intendunt Zephyri; fertur cita gurgite classis,    et tandem laeti notae advertuntur harenae.

Postera cum primo stellas Oriente fugarat    clara dies, socios in coetum litore ab omni    advocat Aeneas, tumulique ex aggere fatur:    'Dardanidae magni, genus alto a sanguine divom,    annuus exactis completur mensibus orbis,    ex quo reliquias divinique ossa parentis    Condidimus terra maestasque sacravimus aras.

Non licuit fines Italos fataliaque arva,    nec tecum Ausonium (quicumque est) quaerere Thybrim.'    Dixerat haec, adytis cum lubricus anguis ab imis    septem ingens gyros, septena volumina traxit,    amplexus placide tumulum lapsusque per aras,    caeruleae cui terga notae, maculosus et auro    squamam incendebat fulgor, ceu nubibus arcus    mille iacit varios adverso sole colores.

It appears he had repeatedly asked the king to give  him this bell for his new church, but had always been refused. When one  day some fishermen brought him a large fish taken off the island of Batz,  and in its mouth was the coveted bell. It is certainly very ancient in  form, a kind of square pyramid about four inches wide and nine high, of  beaten red copper mixed, we were told, with a considerable quantity of  silver. It is now rung over the heads of the faithful on pardons, as a  specific against headache and earache--a singular remedy! The cathedral has  a fine marble tomb of Bishop Visdelou, preacher to Queen Anne of Austria;  he is represented in a half reclining posture, in his pontifical garments.  In every part of the cathedral are the little boxes of skulls.    Adjacent is the Ursuline convent, where is preserved a small figure of the  Virgin in jet; brought from a church in the Iles Sainte Marguerite, taken  from the Spaniards in the seventeenth century. It is supposed to possess  miraculous powers, and is sent round to the sick as a specific.    We breakfasted at the little inn (Hotel de France), commanding a pretty  view of the coast from its windows and garden. The Leon country was  governed by Viscounts, who boasted, among several manorial rights, the  \"droit de motte,\" which empowered them, if a vassal (they were \"serfs de  motte\") attempted to live out of his demesne, or to enter the service of  another lord, to bring him back to his \"motte,\" a cord round his neck, and  inflict upon him corporal punishment. By virtue of the same right, if the  demesne of a lord was so placed that it had no natural height from which  to survey its extent, his vassals were made to bring sufficient cart-loads  of earth to raise a mound or \"motte\" of the requisite elevation. The other  privilege was the droit de \"bris,\" equivalent to our flotsum and jetsum,  so lucrative that a Leon Viscount is recorded to have said, when a noble  was exhibiting his casket of gems, that he possessed a jewel more precious  than all they were admiring--alluding to a rock famous for its shipwrecks.  Duke John the Red, taking advantage of the misdeeds of one of these lords  of Leon, seized his rich possessions and united them (1276) to the crown.  The viscounty of Leon fell by alliance, in the fourteenth century, to the  house of Rohan, in whose favour is was raised in the sixteenth to a  principality.    We continued our drive to Roscoff, three miles distant, a little sea-port  town, formerly one of the three great dens of corsairs and smugglers, all  under the protection of St. Barbe,--the other two being Camaret and Le  Conquet. Roscoff was the emporium of considerable contraband trade with  England. Tea, wine, and brandy were brought over in small casks, which the  smugglers tied together and threw into the sea, when near the coast, and  landed at night. The whole country round is now one extent of  kitchen-garden, the light sandy soil, dressed with the goemon, produces an  incredible quantity of vegetables, onions, cabbages, parsnips, asparagus,  artichokes, cauliflowers, &c. Of onions, 2,000,000 lbs. are said to be  sent every year to England alone. The people here wear black caps, those  of the men are stocking-knit. The gardeners of Roscoff will carry their  produce above a hundred miles for sale. The chief vegetable consumed by  the Bretons themselves is the cabbage, of which the quantity raised is  enormous. The kind grown is mostly the Jersey or cow-cabbage, which grows  with stalks from five to six feet high, and has large leaves at every  joint. They use them for their cattle, as well as for their own eating.  Avenues of cabbages, stacked five or six feet high, are to be seen in most  Breton markets. Bread or porridge of buckwheat (ble noir) with  cabbage-soup is the customary diet of the country. The recipe is simple,  consisting of a cabbage-leaf, over which a little hot water is thrown, and  a \"soupcon\" of butter added to give it a flavour. These ingredients  compose the national soup which always appears at the table d'hote, with  the inevitable \"ragout,\" _i. e._ harricoed mutton. The little town of  Roscoff has some historic importance. It was here that John de Montfort  sailed to England to do homage to King Edward III. for the duchy of  Brittany, and returned by the same port. Here also the child-princess Mary  Stuart landed in 1548 to marry the young Dauphin, afterwards Francis II.  In commemoration of the event, she afterwards caused the little chapel of  St. Ninian to be built close on the water's edge. It is not more than  fifty feet long, and has an eastern flamboyant window, with others in the  side walls. The arches are fast going to decay, the stone altar is also  sculptured. When we saw it, the interior was filled with bundles of  broom-branches and poultry. It is strange this little chapel, built by the  Queen of two Kingdoms, should be suffered to fall to ruin for the lack of  a trifling outlay.    Here, two hundred years later, Prince Charles Stuart landed after  Culloden, in the French frigate the 'Heureux,' sent by the French  Government to facilitate his escape, having eluded, through the chances of  a fog, the pursuit of the English cruisers; and here he knelt, in the  chapel of his ancestress, to return thanks for his deliverance.    The church of Roscoff has a curious pierced steeple, like many of those in  Finistere, and some alabaster bas-reliefs of the fourteenth century, with  numerous boxes of skulls. A ship rudely sculptured by the porch, and  another by the east window, show that the fishermen and ship-owners  contributed to the building of the church. By the shore is a rock of  grotesque form, and opposite, about three miles from Roscoff, is the  pretty island of Batz, which derives its name--Breton \"batz,\" a stick--from  the rod used by St. Pol de Leon to work his miracle.    People were busily employed in boats collecting the goemon, which they  pile in heaps along the shore. The great curiosity of Roscoff is its  enormous fig-tree, in the garden of the Capucine convent, said to be two  centuries old. It is supported by stone pillars, and is, we were informed,  above 300 feet in circumference.    We returned that evening to Morlaix: the viaduct by moonlight had a most  picturesque appearance. Next morning we proceeded by rail to the station  of St. Thegonnec, where nothing in the shape of a vehicle was to be had to  convey us to the town--nearly a mile and a half distant--but the ricketty  two-wheeled mail cart. At the little cabaret, which bears the important  name of Hotel de la Grande Maison, we procured breakfast. The church has  been restored. It is rich in carvings, spoiled by gilding, the altars and  canopied pulpit especially. Opposite to the last are two coloured  \"retables.\" The high altar, with two side altars and two smaller ones  behind, are gorgeously carved, coloured and gilt, and extend to the roof.  The painted-glass windows are the gifts of various persons. At the  entrance of the churchyard is a Renaissance porch, or triumphal arch,  dated 1581, with a sculpture representing St. Thegonnec, a bullock and car  by his side. Adjoining, is the ossuary, or reliquary, bearing the date  1676, also in the same elaborate style, destitute of bones, but having  below a crypt containing a group of life-sized figures representing the  Entombment, with this inscription:--          \"Tu le vois mort, pecheur, ce Dieu qui t'a fait naitre:      Sa mort est ton ouvrage, et devient ton appui.      A ce trait de bonte, tu dois au moins vivre pour lui.\"      In the churchyard is also a calvary; the name given to those monumental  sculptures peculiar to Brittany, consisting of the crucifix, surrounded by  the chief witnesses of the crucifixion, together with minor groups  representing passages in the life of our Saviour. This calvary, executed  in Kersanton stone, is dated 1610; the numerous figures are all in the  grotesque costume of the period, with ruffs, toquets, trained gowns, and  scalloped jackets.    [Illustration: 23. Calvary, Guimiliau.]    We took a carriage for Guimiliau, passing on our road to the left, a  grotto. The church of Guimiliau partly dates from the Renaissance; it has  a finely sculptured porch, and contains within carvings of great beauty;  the pulpit, supported on a column, is dated 1677; the organ-loft is  enriched with splendid bas-reliefs in oak panels,--one represents a  triumphal march, after Le Brun, the others, King David and St. Cecilia.  But the grand monumental carving is the magnificent baptistery or  baptismal font, surmounted by a baldachin or canopy, supported by eight  twisted columns interlaced with vines, grapes and flowers, with graceful  little birds pecking the fruit. On the top of the canopy is a dolphin, and  above, two figures of Fame, trumpet-mouthed, surmounted by a royal crown  and the letters S. V. This baptistery and the organ-loft are both in the  style of Louis XIV., and are said to have cost 30,000 francs. In the  churchyard are a triumphal arch and a reliquary, both inferior to those of  St. Thegonnec, but the calvary of Guimiliau is one of the most extensive  in Brittany. It is of the sixteenth century. It consists of a solid  platform, ascended by a staircase, and raised upon arches; upon it,  sculptured in Kersanton stone, are the three crosses, the centre one  beautifully carved with St. John and the Virgin Mary by the side. The four  Evangelists are placed at each corner, and all the passages in the life of  Christ are represented by groups of little figures in the costume of the  sixteenth century. This singular monument bears two different dates, those  of 1581 and 1588.    Guimiliau is close to the railway, but there is no station there. We  returned to St. Thegonnec. The peasants along the road were threshing  their buckwheat on the open ground; women as well as men were at work.  They threshed in a circle, keeping good "]]]
