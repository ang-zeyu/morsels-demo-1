When the larva is floating on the liquid honey, it is  as it were steadied by the excessive development of the ventral  surface immersed in the honey, which enables it to acquire an  equilibrium that is of the greatest importance to its welfare. In  fact, the breathing-holes, arranged without means of protection on  either edge of the almost flat back, are level with the viscous liquid  and would be choked by that sticky glue at the least false movement,  if a suitably ballasted hold did not prevent the larva from heeling  over. Never was corpulent abdomen of greater use: thanks to this  plumpness of the belly the larva is protected from asphyxia.    Its segments number thirteen, including the head. This head is pale,  soft, like the rest of the body, and very small compared with the rest  of the creature. The antennae are excessively short and consist of two  cylindrical joints. I have vainly looked for the eyes with a powerful  magnifying-glass. In its former state, the larva, subject to strange  migrations, obviously needs the sense of sight and is provided with  four ocelli. In its present state, of what use would eyes be to it at  the bottom of a clay cell, where the most absolute darkness prevails?    The labrum is prominent, is not distinctly divided from the head, is  curved in front and edged with pale and very fine bristles. The  mandibles are small, reddish toward the tips, blunt and hollowed out  spoonwise on the inner side. Below the mandibles is a fleshy part  crowned with two very tiny nipples. This is the lower lip with its two  palpi. It is flanked right and left by two other parts, likewise  fleshy, adhering closely to the lip and bearing at the tip a  rudimentary palp consisting of two or three very tiny joints. These  two parts are the future jaws. All this apparatus of lips and jaws is  completely immobile and in a rudimentary condition which is difficult  to describe. They are budding organs, still faint and embryonic. The  labrum and the complicated lamina formed by the lip and the jaws leave  between them a narrow slit in which the mandibles work.    The legs are merely vestiges, for, though they consist of three tiny  cylindrical joints, they are barely a fiftieth of an inch in length.  The creature is unable to make use of them, not only in the liquid  honey upon which it lives, but even on a solid surface. If we take the  larva from the cell and place it on a hard substance, to observe it  more readily, we see that the inordinate protuberance of the abdomen,  by lifting the thorax from the ground, prevents the legs from finding  a support. Lying on its side, the only possible position because of  its conformation, the larva remains motionless or only makes a few  lazy, wriggling movements of the abdomen, without ever stirring its  feeble limbs, which for that matter could not assist it in any way. In  short, the tiny creature of the first stage, so active and alert, is  succeeded by a ventripotent grub, deprived of movement by its very  obesity. Who would recognize in this clumsy, flabby, blind, hideously  pot-bellied creature, with nothing but a sort of stumps for legs, the  elegant pigmy of but a little while back, armour-clad, slender and  provided with highly perfected organs for performing its perilous  journeys?    Lastly, we count nine pairs of stigmata: one pair on the mesothorax  and the rest on the first eight segments of the abdomen. The last  pair, that on the eighth abdominal segment, consists of stigmata so  small that to detect them we have to gather their position by that in  the succeeding states of the larva and to pass a very patient  magnifying-glass along the direction of the other pairs. These are as  yet but vestigial stigmata. The others are fairly large, with pale,  round, flat edges.    If in its first form the Sitaris-larva is organized for action, to  obtain possession of the coveted cell, in its second form it is  organized solely to digest the provisions acquired. Let us take a  glance at its internal structure and in particular at its digestive  apparatus. Here is a strange thing: this apparatus, in which the hoard  of honey amassed by the Anthophora is to be engulfed, is similar in  every respect to that of the adult Sitaris, who possibly never takes  food. We find in both the same very short oesophagus, the same  chylific ventricle, empty in the perfect insect, distended in the  larva with an abundant orange-coloured pulp; in both the same  gall-bladders, four in number, connected with the rectum by one of  their extremities. Like the perfect insect, the larva is devoid of  salivary glands or any other similar apparatus. Its nervous system  comprises eleven ganglia, not counting the oesophageal collar, whereas  in the perfect insect there are only seven: three for the thorax, of  which the last two are contiguous, and four for the abdomen.    When its rations are finished the larva remains a few days in a  motionless condition, ejecting from time to time a few reddish  droppings until the digestive canal is completely cleared of its  orange-coloured pulp. Then the creature contracts itself, huddles  itself together; and before long we see coming detached from its body  a transparent, slightly crumpled and extremely fine pellicle, forming  a closed bag, in which the successive transformations will take place  henceforth. On this epidermal bag, this sort of transparent leather  bottle, formed by the larva's skin detached all of a piece, without a  slit of any kind, we can distinguish the several well-preserved  external organs: the head, with its antennae, mandibles, paws and  palpi; the thoracic segments, with their vestiges of legs; the  abdomen, with its chain of breathing-holes still connected one to  another by tracheal threads.    Then beneath this pellicle, which is so delicate that it can hardly  bear the most cautious touch, we see a soft, white mass taking shape,  a mass which in a few hours acquires a firm, horny consistency and a  vivid yellow hue. The transformation is now complete. Let us tear the  fine gauze bag enclosing the organism which has just come into being  and direct our investigation to this third form of the Sitaris-larva.    It is an inert, segmented body, with an oval outline, a horny  consistency, just like that of pupae and chrysalids, and a  bright-yellow colour, which we can best describe by likening it to  that of a lemon-drop. Its upper surface forms a double inclined plane  with a very blunt ridge; its lower surface is at first flat, but, as  the result of evaporation, becomes more concave daily, leaving a  projecting rim all around its oval outline. Lastly, its two  extremities or poles are slightly flattened. The major axis of the  lower surface averages half an inch in length and the minor axis a  quarter of an inch.    At the cephalic pole of this body is a sort of mask, modelled roughly  on the head of the larva, and at the opposite pole a small circular  disk deeply wrinkled at the centre. The three segments that come after  the head bear each a pair of very minute knobs, hardly visible without  the lens: these are, to the legs of the larva in its previous form,  what the cephalic mask is to the head of the same larva. They are not  organs, but indications, landmarks placed at the points where these  organs will appear later. On either side we count nine stigmata, set  as before on the mesothorax and the first eight abdominal segments.  The first eight breathing-holes are dark brown and stand out plainly  against the yellow colour of the body. They consist of small, shiny,  conical knobs, perforated at the top with a round hole. The ninth  stigma, though fashioned like the others, is ever so much smaller; it  cannot be distinguished without the lens.    The anomaly, already so manifest in the change from the first form to  the second, becomes even more so here; and we do not know what name to  give to an organism without a standard of comparison, not only in the  order of Beetles, but in the whole class of insects. While, on the one  hand, this organism offers many points of resemblance to the pupae of  the Flies in its horny consistency, in the complete immobility of its  various segments, in the all but absolute absence of relief which  would enable one to distinguish the parts of the perfect insect;  while, on the other hand, it approximates to the chrysalids, because  the creature, to attain this condition, has to shed its skin, as the  caterpillars do, it differs from the pupa because it has for covering  not the surface skin, which has become horny, but rather one of the  inner skins of the larva; and it differs from the chrysalids by the  absence of mouldings which in the latter betray the appendages of the  perfect insect. Lastly, it differs yet more profoundly from the pupa  and the chrysalis because from both these organisms the perfect insect  springs straightway, whereas that which follows what we are  considering is simply a larva like that which went before. I shall  suggest, to denote this curious organism, the term _pseudochrysalis_;  and I shall reserve the names _primary larva_, _secondary larva_ and  _tertiary larva_ to denote, in a couple of words, each of the three  forms under which the Sitares possess all the characteristics of  larvae.    Although the Sitaris, on assuming the form of the pseudochrysalis, is  transfigured outwardly to the point of baffling the science of  entomological phases, this is not so inwardly. I have at every season  of the year examined the viscera of the pseudochrysalids, which  generally remain stationary for a whole year, and I have never  observed other forms among their organs than those which we find in  the secondary larva. The nervous system has undergone no change. The  digestive apparatus is absolutely void and, because of its emptiness,  appears only as a thin cord, sunk, lost amid the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2788"],[0,"Little Men: Life at Plumfield With Jo's Boys (#15)"],[1,"ep, rather taken aback  by the proposition.    \"Fighting isn't allowed!\" cried the others, much excited.    \"You're a nice lot,\" sneered Dan.    \"Come, if you don't behave, you shan't stay,\" said Nat, firing up at  that insult to his friends.    \"I'd like to see him do better than I did, that's all,\" observed Tommy,  with a swagger.    \"Clear the way, then,\" and without the slightest preparation Dan turned  three somersaults one after the other and came up on his feet.    \"You can't beat that, Tom; you always hit your head and tumble flat,\"  said Nat, pleased at his friend's success.    Before he could say any more the audience were electrified by three more  somersaults backwards, and a short promenade on the hands, head down,  feet up. This brought down the house, and Tommy joined in the admiring  cries which greeted the accomplished gymnast as he righted himself, and  looked at them with an air of calm superiority.    \"Do you think I could learn to do it without its hurting me very much?\"  Tom meekly asked, as he rubbed the elbows which still smarted after the  last attempt.    \"What will you give me if I'll teach you?\" said Dan.    \"My new jack-knife; it's got five blades, and only one is broken.\"    \"Give it here, then.\"    Tommy handed it over with an affectionate look at its smooth handle.  Dan examined it carefully, then putting it into his pocket, walked off,  saying with a wink,    \"Keep it up till you learn, that's all.\"    A howl of wrath from Tommy was followed by a general uproar, which did  not subside till Dan, finding himself in a minority, proposed that they  should play stick-knife, and whichever won should have the treasure.  Tommy agreed, and the game was played in a circle of excited faces,  which all wore an expression of satisfaction, when Tommy won and secured  the knife in the depth of his safest pocket.    \"You come off with me, and I'll show you round,\" said Nat, feeling that  he must have a little serious conversation with his friend in private.    What passed between them no one knew, but when they appeared again, Dan  was more respectful to every one, though still gruff in his speech, and  rough in his manner; and what else could be expected of the poor lad  who had been knocking about the world all his short life with no one to  teach him any better?    The boys had decided that they did not like him, and so they left him  to Nat, who soon felt rather oppressed by the responsibility, but too  kind-hearted to desert him.    Tommy, however, felt that in spite of the jack-knife transaction,  there was a bond of sympathy between them, and longed to return to the  interesting subject of somersaults. He soon found an opportunity, for  Dan, seeing how much he admired him, grew more amiable, and by the end  of the first week was quite intimate with the lively Tom.    Mr. Bhaer, when he heard the story and saw Dan, shook his head, but only  said quietly,    \"The experiment may cost us something, but we will try it.\"    If Dan felt any gratitude for his protection, he did not show it, and  took without thanks all that was give him. He was ignorant, but very  quick to learn when he chose; had sharp eyes to watch what went on about  him; a saucy tongue, rough manners, and a temper that was fierce and  sullen by turns. He played with all his might, and played well at almost  all the games. He was silent and gruff before grown people, and only  now and then was thoroughly sociable among the lads. Few of them really  liked him, but few could help admiring his courage and strength, for  nothing daunted him, and he knocked tall Franz flat on one occasion with  an ease that caused all the others to keep at a respectful distance from  his fists. Mr. Bhaer watched him silently, and did his best to tame the  \"Wild Boy,\" as they called him, but in private the worthy man shook his  head, and said soberly, \"I hope the experiment will turn out well, but I  am a little afraid it may cost too much.\"    Mrs. Bhaer lost her patience with him half a dozen times a day, yet  never gave him up, and always insisted that there was something good  in the lad, after all; for he was kinder to animals than to people, he  liked to rove about in the woods, and, best of all, little Ted was fond  of him. What the secret was no one could discover, but Baby took to him  at once gabbled and crowed whenever he saw him preferred his strong back  to ride on to any of the others and called him \"My Danny\" out of his  own little head. Teddy was the only creature to whom Dan showed an  affection, and this was only manifested when he thought no one  else would see it; but mothers' eyes are quick, and motherly hearts  instinctively divine who love their babies. So Mrs. Jo soon saw and felt  that there was a soft spot in rough Dan, and bided her time to touch and  win him.    But an unexpected and decidedly alarming event upset all their plans,  and banished Dan from Plumfield.    Tommy, Nat, and Demi began by patronizing Dan, because the other  lads rather slighted him; but soon they each felt there was a certain  fascination about the bad boy, and from looking down upon him they came  to looking up, each for a different reason. Tommy admired his skill and  courage; Nat was grateful for past kindness; and Demi regarded him as  a sort of animated story book, for when he chose Dan could tell his  adventures in a most interesting way. It pleased Dan to have the three  favorites like him, and he exerted himself to be agreeable, which was  the secret of his success.    The Bhaers were surprised, but hoped the lads would have a good  influence over Dan, and waited with some anxiety, trusting that no harm  would come of it.    Dan felt they did not quite trust him, and never showed them his best  side, but took a wilful pleasure in trying their patience and thwarting  their hopes as far as he dared.    Mr. Bhaer did not approve of fighting, and did not think it a proof of  either manliness or courage for two lads to pommel one another for  the amusement of the rest. All sorts of hardy games and exercises were  encouraged, and the boys were expected to take hard knocks and tumbles  without whining; but black eyes and bloody noses given for the fun of it  were forbidden as a foolish and a brutal play.    Dan laughed at this rule, and told such exciting tales of his own valor,  and the many frays that he had been in, that some of the lads were fired  with a desire to have a regular good \"mill.\"    \"Don't tell, and I'll show you how,\" said Dan; and, getting half a dozen  of the lads together behind the barn, he gave them a lesson in boxing,  which quite satisfied the ardor of most of them. Emil, however, could  not submit to be beaten by a fellow younger than himself, for Emil was  past fourteen and a plucky fellow, so he challenged Dan to a fight. Dan  accepted at once, and the others looked on with intense interest.    What little bird carried the news to head-quarters no one ever knew,  but, in the very hottest of the fray, when Dan and Emil were fighting  like a pair of young bulldogs, and the others with fierce, excited  faces were cheering them on, Mr. Bhaer walked into the ring, plucked the  combatants apart with a strong hand, and said, in the voice they seldom  heard,    \"I can't allow this, boys! Stop it at once; and never let me see it  again. I keep a school for boys, not for wild beasts. Look at each other  and be ashamed of yourselves.\"    \"You let me go, and I'll knock him down again,\" shouted Dan, sparring  away in spite of the grip on his collar.    \"Come on, come on, I ain't thrashed yet!\" cried Emil, who had been down  five times, but did not know when he was beaten.    \"They are playing be gladdy what-you-call-'ems, like the Romans, Uncle  Fritz,\" called out Demi, whose eyes were bigger than ever with the  excitement of this new pastime.    \"They were a fine set of brutes; but we have learned something since  then, I hope, and I cannot have you make my barn a Colosseum. Who  proposed this?\" asked Mr. Bhaer.    \"Dan,\" answered several voices.    \"Don't you know that it is forbidden?\"    \"Yes,\" growled Dan, sullenly.    \"Then why break the rule?\"    \"They'll all be molly-coddles, if they don't know how to fight.\"    \"Have you found Emil a molly-coddle? He doesn't look much like one,\"  and Mr. Bhaer brought the two face to face. Dan had a black eye, and his  jacket was torn to rags, but Emil's face was covered with blood from a  cut lip and a bruised nose, while a bump on his forehead was already as  purple as a plum. In spite of his wounds however, he still glared upon  his foe, and evidently panted to renew the fight.    \"He'd make a first-rater if he was taught,\" said Dan, unable to withhold  the praise from the boy who made it necessary for him to do his best.    \"He'll be taught to fence and box by and by, and till then I think  he will do very well without any lessons in mauling. Go and wash your  faces; and remember, Dan, if you break any more of the rules again, you  will be sent away. That was the bargain; do your part and we will do  ours.\"    The lads went off, and after a few more words to the spectators, Mr.  Bhaer followed to bind up the wounds of the young gladiators. Emil went  to bed sick, and Dan was an unpleasant spectacle for a week.    But the lawless lad had no thought of obeying, and soon transgressed  again.    One Saturday afternoon as a party of the boys went out to play, Tommy  said,    \"Let's go down to the river, and cut a lot of new fish-poles.\"    \"Take Toby to drag them back, and one of us can ride him down,\" proposed  Stuffy, who hated to walk.    \"That means you, I suppose; well, hurry up, lazy-bones,\" said Dan.    Away they went, and having got the poles were about to go home, when  Demi unluckily said to Tommy, who was on Toby with a long rod in his  hand,    \"You look like the picture of the man in the bull-fight, only you  haven't got a red cloth, or pretty clothes on.\"    \"I'd like to"]]]
