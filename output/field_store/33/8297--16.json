There was then no  hesitation in determining the nature of the discoveries made in the  Corso Vittorio Emanuele; an altar had been found there, and this altar  must have been the one sacred to Dis and Proserpina, as no other is  mentioned in history in the northwest section of the Campus Martius.    The drawings which illustrate my account of the discovery[45] prove  that the altar rose from a platform twelve feet square, approached on  all sides by three or four marble steps, that platform and altar were  enclosed by three lines of wall at an interval of thirty-six feet from  one another, and that on the east side of the square ran a _euripus_,  or channel, eleven feet wide, and four feet deep, lined with stone  blocks, the incline of which towards the Tiber is about 1:100. This  last detail proves that when the rough altar of Volesus Sabinus was  succeeded by the later noble structure, the pool was drained, and its  feeding springs were led into the _euripus_, so that the patients  seeking a cure for their ailments could bathe in or drink the  miracle-working waters with greater ease. No attention whatever was  paid to the discovery at the time it took place. Instead of reaching  the ancient level, the excavation for the main sewer of the Corso  Vittorio Emanuele was stopped at the wrong place, within three feet of  the pavement; consequently whatever fragments of the altar, of  inscriptions, or of works of art, were lying on the marble floor will  lie there forever, as the building of the palaces on either side of  the Corso, and the construction of the Corso itself, with its costly  sewers, sidewalks, etc., have made further research impossible, at  least with our present means.    Concerning the celebration which took place around this altar in the  year 17 B. C., we already possessed ample information from such  materials as the oracle of the Sibyl, referred to by Zosimus, the  _Carmen Saeculare_ of Horace, and the legends and designs on the medals  struck for the occasion; but the official report, discovered September  20, 1890, produces an altogether different impression; it enables us  actually to take part in the pageant, to follow with rapture Horace as  he leads a chorus of fifty-four young men and girls of patrician  birth, singing the hymn which he composed for the occasion.[46]    There is such a tone of simplicity and common-sense, such a display of  method and mutual respect between Augustus, the Senate, and the  Quindecemviri, in the official transactions which preceded, attended  and followed the celebration, in the resolutions passed by the several  bodies, in the proclamations addressed to the people, and in the  arrangements for the festivities, which a mass of a million or more  spectators was expected to attend, that a lesson in civic dignity  could be learned from this report by modern governments and  corporations.    The official report begins, or rather began (the first lines are  missing), with the request presented by the Quindecemviri to the  Senate to take their proposal into consideration, and grant the  necessary funds, followed by a decree of the Senate accepting the  proposal and inviting Augustus to take the direction of the  festivities. The request was addressed to the Senate on February 17,  by Marcus Agrippa, president of the Quindecemviri, standing before the  seat of the consuls. What a scene to witness! We can picture to  ourselves the two consuls, Gaius Furnius and Junius Silanus, clad in  their official robes, listening to the speech of the great statesman,  who is supported by twenty colleagues, all ex-consuls, and chosen  among the noblest, richest, and most gallant patricians of the age.  The Senate agrees that the preparations for the festival, the building  of the temporary stages, hippodromes, tribunes, and scaffoldings shall  be executed by the contractors (_redemptores_), and that the treasury  officials shall provide the funds.    Lines 1-23 contain a letter from Augustus to the Quindecemviri  detailing the programme of the ceremonies, the number and quality of  persons who shall take part in it, the dates and hours, and the number  and character of the victims. Two clauses of the imperial manifesto  are especially noteworthy. First, that during the three days, June  1-3, the courthouses shall be closed, and justice shall not be  administered. Second, that ladies who are wearing mourning shall lay  aside that sign of grief for this occasion. The date of the manifesto  is March 24.    Upon the receipt of this document the Quindecemviri meet and pass  several resolutions: that the rules regarding the ceremonies shall be  made known to the public by advertisement (_albo propositae_); that the  mornings of May 26, 27, and 28, shall be set apart for the  _distributio suffimentorum_, in which the Quindecemviri were wont to  distribute among the citizens torches, sulphur and bitumen, for  purification; and the mornings of May 29, 30, and 31, for the _frugum  acceptio_, or distribution of wheat, barley, and beans. To avoid  overcrowding, four centres of distribution are named, and each of them  is placed under the supervision of four members of the college, making  a total of sixteen delegates. The places indicated in the programme  are the platform of the Capitolium, the area in front of the Temple of  Jupiter Tonans, the Portico of the Danaids on the Palatine, and the  Temple of Diana on the Aventine.    On May 23 the Senate meets in the Septa Julia--the ruins of which  still exist, under the Palazzo Doria and the church of S. Maria in Via  Lata--and passes two resolutions. Horace's hymn, vv. 17-20, alludes to  the first: \"O Goddess, whether you choose the title of Lucina or of  Genitalis, multiply our offspring, and prosper the decree of the  Senate in relation to the giving of women in wedlock, and the  matrimonial laws.\" Among the penalties imposed on men and women who  remained single between the ages of twenty and fifty years, was the  prohibition against attending public festivities and ceremonies of  state. The Senate, considering the extraordinary case of the _Ludi  Saeculares_, which none among the living had seen or would ever see  again, removes this prohibition. The second resolution provides for  the erection of two commemorative pillars, one of bronze, the other of  marble, upon which the official report of the celebration shall be  engraved. The bronze pillar is probably lost forever, but the marble  one is that recovered on the banks of the Tiber, September 20, 1890,  the inscription on which I am endeavoring to explain.    The celebration in the strict sense of the word began at the second  hour of the night of May 31. Sacrifices were offered to the Fates, on  altars erected between the Tarentum and the banks of the Tiber, where  S. Giovanni dei Fiorentini now stands; and the other ceremonies were  performed on a wooden stage which was illuminated by lights and fires.  This temporary theatre was not provided with seats, and the report  calls it \"a stage without a theatre.\" In the performances of the next  day and in those of June 2 and 3, which took place on the Capitol and  the Palatine, the following order was observed in the ceremonial  pageant; first came Augustus as Emperor and Pontifex Maximus, next the  Consuls, the Senate, the Quindecemviri and other colleges of priests,  then followed the Vestal Virgins, and a group of one hundred and ten  matrons (as many as there were years in the _saeculum_) selected from  among the most exemplary _matres familiae_ above twenty-five years of  age.    Twenty-seven boys and twenty-seven girls of patrician descent whose  parents were both living (_patrimi et matrimi_) were enlisted on June  3, to sing the hymn composed expressly by Horace. \"Carmen composuit Q.  Horatius Flaccus,\" so the report says (line 149). The first stanzas of  the beautiful canticle were sung when the procession was marching from  the Temple of Apollo to that of Jupiter Capitolinus, the middle  portion on the Capitol, and the last on the way back to the Palatine.  The accompaniments were played by the orchestra and the trumpeters of  the official choir (_tibicines et fidicines qui sacris publicis praesto  sunt_). The wealth of magnificence and beauty which the Romans beheld  on the morning of June 3, 17 B. C., we can see as in a dream, but it  baffles description. Imagine the group of fifty-four young patricians  clad in snow-white tunics, crowned with flowers, and waving branches  of laurel, led by Horace down the Vicus Apollinis (the street which  led from the Summa Sacra Via to the house of Augustus on the  Palatine), and the Sacra Via, singing the praises of the immortal  gods:--        \"Quibus septem placuere colles!\"    During those days and nights Augustus gave evidence of a truly  remarkable strength of mind and body, never missing a ceremony, and  himself performing the sacrifices. Agrippa showed less power of  endurance than his friend and master. He appeared only in the daytime,  helping the emperor in addressing supplications to the gods, and in  immolating the victims.      ARA PACIS AUGUSTAE. Among the honors voted to Augustus by the Senate  in the year 13 B. C., on the occasion of his triumphal return from the  campaigns of Germany and Gaul, was the erection of a votive altar in  the Curia itself. Augustus refused it, but consented that an altar  should be raised in the Campus Martius and dedicated to Peace. Judging  from the fragments which have come down to us, this _ara_ was one of  the most exquisite artistic productions of the golden age of Augustus.  It stood in the centre of a triple square enclosure, on the west side  of the Via Flaminia, the site of the present Palazzo Fiano. Twice its  remains have been brought to light; once in 1554, when they were drawn  by Giovanni Colonna,[47] and again in 1859, when "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22163"],[0,"The Rover Boys on the Farm; or, Last Days at Putnam Hall (#15)"],[1," in the dormitory over there. I heard a noise and went to see  what was the matter and the snake came out of the room and made off in  that direction,\" and George Strong pointed with his hand.    \"Humph!\" muttered Captain Putnam. \"This must be looked into. What kind  of a snake was it?\"    \"I don't know, sir, but it was fully three feet long, and it hissed  loudly as it went past me.\"    \"Some more of the boys' tricks, I suppose. But this is going too far,  especially if the reptile is poisonous.\"    Lights were lit and turned up as high as possible, and a search of all  the hallways followed. When the cadets learned that a snake was really  at large in the school many of the timid ones were badly frightened.    \"He might poison a fellow and kill him,\" said one lad.    \"Oh, I can't bear snakes,\" said another. \"If he came for me I'd have a  fit sure.\"    The search for the snake was kept up the best part of an hour, but  without success. Peleg Snuggers was forced to join in the hunt and  nearly collapsed when he saw something under a stand in a far corner.    \"The snake! The snake!\" he yelled and started to run away. But what he  had seen proved to be nothing but a piece of old window cord, and the  general utility man was laughed at so heartily he was glad to sneak out  of sight.    \"He must have gone downstairs,\" said Dick, and then a hunt was made  below. Here some windows had been left open for ventilation, and Captain  Putnam said it was possible the reptile had made its escape in that  manner. He did not quite believe this, but he thought the snake must be  harmless, and he wanted to say something to quiet those pupils who were  timid.    \"How did the snake get in your room?\" he asked later on of the Rovers  and their dormitory fellows.    \"It came in this box,\" answered Dick, and brought forth the pasteboard  box in question. \"Somebody knocked on the door and when we opened it the  box was on the floor.\"    Captain Putnam looked at the box and the inscription.    \"Your lady friends must have peculiar tastes,\" he said, smiling.    \"Of course that was a trick--just to get us to take the box and open  it,\" answered Tom.    \"Do you suspect anybody, Thomas?\"    \"Well--not exactly,\" said the fun-loving Rover, slowly.    \"What have you to say, Samuel?\"    \"I'm sure I can't imagine who could send that box.\"    \"Richard, what can you tell of this?\"    Dick paused and took a long breath.    \"I can't tell you anything, just now, Captain Putnam,\" he answered  slowly. \"But I've got something of an idea of how that box got here. But  I'd hate to accuse anybody unless I was sure of it.\"    \"Mr. Strong said the snake was at least three feet long.\"    \"It was certainly all of that.\"    \"Was it a poisonous snake, do you think?\"    \"It was not a rattlesnake, nor was it any kind of a snake such as are  usually found in this part of our country, of that I am sure.\"    \"You got a good look at it then?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"I certainly had no idea snakes of such size could be found close to the  school.\"    \"I am pretty sure that snake was never found around here. During my  travels I have studied snakes a little, and that variety was a stranger  to me.\"    \"I see.\" The master of Putnam Hall mused for a moment. \"Well, it is very  queer. But, as the snake has disappeared, I think we may as well retire  once more. I do not imagine we have anything to fear.\"    It was a good hour before the school was quiet. Many of the boys were  afraid to go to bed, and the teachers could not blame them. The Rovers  and their chums got together to discuss the situation in whispers and at  the same time remove all traces of the feast which had been so curiously  interrupted.    \"Dick, what do you make of this?\" asked Tom.    \"I think Tad Sobber is guilty, Tom--but I didn't want to tell Captain  Putnam so.\"    \"You think he got the snake out of that museum?\"    \"I do.\"    \"I think that myself,\" put in Sam. \"Don't you remember how he was  talking to that barker, just as if they were friends? It was surely  Sobber who played that trick.\"    \"If it was Sobber we ought to pay him back,\" came from Songbird, grimly.  \"A snake! Ugh, it makes me creep to think of it.\"    \"Don't you want to compose an ode in its honor?\" questioned Tom, dryly.  \"Might go like this:        \"A hissing, gliding snake      Kept all the school awake;      Each boy in awful fright      Was looking for a bite!\"    \"You can make fun if you want to, but I think it is no laughing matter,\"  observed Fred. \"Supposing a fellow goes to sleep and wakes up to find  that snake crawling over him! Phew! talk about nightmares!\"    \"It certainly would make a fellow feel queer,\" answered Sam. \"But I say,  Dick, if you are sure Sobber did it, why can't we pay him back in his  own coin?\"    \"I'm willing, but how can it be done?\"    \"Wait until to-morrow night and I'll show you,\" answered the youngest  Rover. \"That is, unless the snake is caught in the meantime.\"    \"Have you a plan to get square?\" asked Larry.    \"Yes.\"    \"Den go ahead sure,\" came from Hans. \"Of dot Sobber fellow peen guilty  he ought to be hung up on der pottom of der sea alretty quick!\"    \"Just wait, and we'll fix Mr. Tad Sobber,\" answered Dick. \"He'll wish he  never saw a snake.\" He had an inkling of what was in his brother Sam's  mind to do.          CHAPTER XVII    A STIRRING SCENE IN THE SCHOOLROOM      The hunt for the snake was continued all of the next day, but without  success. By that time the excitement had died down and a good many of  the cadets forgot all about the incident. A few said it must be a joke  and they laughed behind George Strong's back.    \"It's one of Tom Rover's tricks,\" said one pupil. \"I'll wager he is  laughing in his sleeves at Mr. Strong and Captain Putnam.\"    \"Do you think it was a live snake?\" asked another.    \"No, it was probably a toy affair on a string.\"    In the secrecy of their room Tad Sobber and Nick Pell laughed heartily  over the excitement created--that is, Pell laughed and the bully laughed  with him. But Sobber, behind it all, was worried.    The truth of the matter was, he had hoped that the snake would be  killed. The man who had sold him the reptile had said it was from  Central America and poisonous, but had added that the snake was sick and  not liable to do any harm. Sobber would not have cared had Dick or his  brothers been bitten by the snake, but that the reptile was at large was  another story.    \"Do you think he'd be poisonous enough to kill anybody?\" asked Pell,  suddenly, and he sobered down as he spoke.    \"Oh, no, of course not,\" answered the bully, but he turned his face away  as he spoke. He had given five dollars for the snake and now he was  willing to give a like sum to make certain of its death.    In the afternoon Sam led the way to a little case of reptiles which hung  on the wall of the school laboratory. In this was a stuffed snake almost  the size of that which had disappeared.    \"I guess we can frighten Sobber and Pell with that,\" he said to his  brothers.    \"Anyway, we can try,\" answered Tom, falling in with the plan at once.    \"We want to be careful of what we do,\" added Dick. \"Otherwise, the pair  will smell a mouse.\"    They talked the matter over, and managed to get the snake upstairs  without anybody seeing them. Then they paid a visit to the dormitory  occupied by the bully and his cronies and passed some strong black  threads across the floor and elsewhere. After that they told Songbird  and their other chums of what had been done.    That night Sobber, Pell and their friends went to bed as usual. But  hardly had they turned out the lights when they heard a curious rustling  sound on the floor near the door.    \"What is that?\" asked Pell, who was inclined to be nervous.    \"I don't know, I'm sure,\" answered Sobber.    The rustling continued, and something seemed to move across the floor.  Wondering what it could be, the bully got up and lit a light. Then he  gave a yell and leaped back.    \"The snake!\"    \"Where is it?\" screamed Pell, sitting bolt upright and his hair raising  on ends.    \"There it is, over in the corner.\"    \"The snake! The snake!\" called out the other boys in the room, and some  were so scared that they dove under the bed clothing.    The light was not strong enough to see clearly, and nobody had the  courage to make more of an illumination. Sobber stood in the center of  the room and as he did this the snake suddenly seemed to fly through the  air right at him.    \"Oh!\" he screamed. \"Go away!\" and he flopped on his bed and threw a  blanket over him. He felt the reptile cross the bed and lay there  quaking in mortal terror. Then he heard something moving across the  floor.    \"That snake is bound to bite me!\" he muttered to himself. \"Oh, why did I  bring it to the school!\"    \"Call Captain Putnam, somebody!\" came from Nick Pell. He was so  frightened he could scarcely speak.    There was an emergency bell near the door, to be used in case of fire,  and this one of the boys touched. At once the alarm sounded out, and in  a few minutes the hallways were filled with pupils as on the previous  night, while some of the teachers and Peleg Snuggers appeared with  chemical fire extinguishers in their hands.    \"Where is the fire?\"    \"Shall I telephone for the Cedarville fire department?\"    \"Has anybody been burnt?\"    \"What room is it in?\"    Such were some of the questions asked. Then Captain Putnam rushed on the  scene.    \"It's the snake again!\" wailed one of the cadets, who now stood bolt  upright on his bed, his eyes bulging from his head.    \"Are you sure?\"    \"Yes, the snake is in here,\" answered Tad Sobber. \"Why, it fairly jumped  over my bed!\"    \"He tried to bite me in the face!\" came from Nick Pell, who was so  excited he scarcely knew what he was saying.    More lights were lit, and Captain Putnam went off to get a shotgun.    \"If I catch sight of it, I'll blow it to pieces,\" he said to George  Strong.    A long search "]]]
