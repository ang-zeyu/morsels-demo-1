John Frederick William Herschel was born at  Slough, March 17, 1792, graduated with the highest honours from St.  John's College, Cambridge, in 1813, and entered upon legal studies with  a view to being called to the Bar. But his share in an early compact  with Peacock and Babbage, \"to do their best to leave the world wiser  than they found it,\" was not thus to be fulfilled. The acquaintance of  Dr. Wollaston decided his scientific vocation. Already, in 1816, we find  him reviewing some of his father's double stars; and he completed in  1820 the 18-inch speculum which was to be the chief instrument of his  investigations. Soon afterwards, he undertook, in conjunction with Mr.  (later Sir James) South, a series of observations, issuing in the  presentation to the Royal Society of a paper[111] containing  micrometrical measurements of 380 binary stars, by which the elder  Herschel's inferences of orbital motion were, in many cases, strikingly  confirmed. A star in the Northern Crown, for instance (Eta Coronae),  had completed more than one entire circuit since its first discovery;  another, Tau Ophiuchi, had _closed up_ into apparent singleness; while  the motion of a third, Xi Ursae Majoris, in an obviously eccentric orbit,  was so rapid as to admit of being traced and measured from month to month.    It was from the first confidently believed that the force retaining  double stars in curvilinear paths was identical with that governing the  planetary revolutions. But that identity was not ascertained until  Savary of Paris showed, in 1827,[112] that the movements of the  above-named binary in the Great Bear could be represented with all  attainable accuracy by an ellipse calculated on orthodox gravitational  principles with a period of 58-1/4 years. Encke followed at Berlin with  a still more elegant method; and Sir John Herschel, pointing out the  uselessness of analytical refinements where the data were necessarily so  imperfect, described in 1832 a graphical process by which \"the aid of  the eye and hand\" was brought in \"to guide the judgment in a case where  judgment only, and not calculation, could be of any avail.\"[113]  Improved methods of the same kind were published by Dr. See in  1893,[114] and by Mr. Burnham in 1894;[115] and our acquaintance with  stellar orbits is steadily gaining precision, certainty, and extent.    In 1825 Herschel undertook, and executed with great assiduity during the  ensuing eight years, a general survey of the northern heavens, directed  chiefly towards the verification of his father's nebular discoveries.  The outcome was a catalogue of 2,306 nebulae and clusters, of which 525  were observed for the first time, besides 3,347 double stars discovered  almost incidentally.[116] \"Strongly invited,\" as he tells us himself,  \"by the peculiar interest of the subject, and the wonderful nature of  the objects which presented themselves,\" he resolved to attempt the  completion of the survey in the southern hemisphere. With this noble  object in view, he embarked his family and instruments on board the  _Mount Stewart Elphinstone_, and, after a prosperous voyage, landed at  Cape Town on the 16th of January, 1834. Choosing as the scene of his  observations a rural spot under the shelter of Table Mountain, he began  regular \"sweeping\" on the 5th of March. The site of his great reflector  is now marked with an obelisk, and the name of Feldhausen has become  memorable in the history of science; for the four years' work done there  may truly be said to open the chapter of our knowledge as regards the  southern skies.    The full results of Herschel's journey to the Cape were not made public  until 1847, when a splendid volume[117] embodying them was brought out  at the expense of the Duke of Northumberland. They form a sequel to his  father's labours such as the investigations of one man have rarely  received from those of another. What the elder observer did for the  northern heavens, the younger did for the southern, and with generally  concordant results. Reviving the paternal method of \"star-gauging,\" he  showed, from a count of 2,299 fields, that the Milky Way surrounds the  solar system as a complete annulus of minute stars; not, however, quite  symmetrically, since the sun was thought to lie somewhat nearer to those  portions visible in the southern hemisphere, which display a brighter  lustre and a more complicated structure than the northern branches. The  singular cosmical agglomerations known as the \"Magellanic Clouds\" were  now, for the first time, submitted to a detailed, though admittedly  incomplete, examination, the almost inconceivable richness and variety  of their contents being such that a lifetime might with great profit be  devoted to their study. In the Greater Nubecula, within a compass of  forty-two square degrees, Herschel reckoned 278 distinct nebulae and  clusters, besides fifty or sixty outliers, and a large number of stars  intermixed with diffused nebulosity--in all, 919 catalogued objects,  and, for the Lesser Cloud, 244. Yet this was only the most conspicuous  part of what his twenty-foot revealed. Such an extraordinary  concentration of bodies so various led him to the inevitable conclusion  that \"the Nubeculae are to be regarded as systems _sui generis_, and  which have no analogues in our hemisphere.\"[118] He noted also the  blankness of surrounding space, especially in the case of Nubecula  Minor, \"the access to which on all sides,\" he remarked, \"is through a  desert;\" as if the cosmical material in the neighbourhood had been swept  up and garnered in these mighty groups.[119]    Of southern double stars, he discovered and gave careful measurements of  2,102, and described 1,708 nebulae, of which at least 300 were new. The  list was illustrated with a number of drawings, some of them extremely  beautiful and elaborate.    Sir John Herschel's views as to the nature of nebulae were considerably  modified by Lord Rosse's success in \"resolving\" with his great  reflectors a crowd of these objects into stars. His former somewhat  hesitating belief in the existence of phosphorescent matter,  \"disseminated through extensive regions of space in the manner of a  cloud or fog,\"[120] was changed into a conviction that no valid  distinction could be established between the faintest wisp of cosmical  vapour just discernible in a powerful telescope, and the most brilliant  and obvious cluster. He admitted, however, an immense range of possible  variety in the size and mode of aggregation of the stellar constituents  of various nebulae. Some might appear nebulous from the closeness of  their parts; some from their smallness. Others, he suggested, might be  formed of \"discrete luminous bodies floating in a non-luminous  medium;\"[121] while the annular kind probably consisted of \"hollow  shells of stars.\"[122] That a physical, and not merely an optical,  connection unites nebulae with the _embroidery_ (so to speak) of small  stars with which they are in many instances profusely decorated, was  evident to him, as it must be to all who look as closely and see as  clearly as he did. His description of No. 2,093 in his northern  catalogue as \"a network or tracery of nebula following the lines of a  similar network of stars,\"[123] would alone suffice to dispel the idea  of accidental scattering; and many other examples of a like import might  be quoted. The remarkably frequent occurrence of one or more minute  stars in the close vicinity of \"planetary\" nebulae led him to infer their  dependent condition; and he advised the maintenance of a strict watch  for evidences of circulatory movements, not only over these supposed  stellar satellites, but also over the numerous \"double nebulae,\" in  which, as he pointed out, \"all the varieties of double stars as to  distance, position, and relative brightness, have their counterparts.\"  He, moreover, investigated the subject of nebular distribution by the  simple and effectual method of graphic delineation or \"charting,\" and  succeeded in showing that while a much greater uniformity of scattering  prevails in the southern than in the northern heavens, a condensation is  nevertheless perceptible about the constellations Pisces and Cetus,  roughly corresponding to the \"nebular region\" in Virgo by its vicinity  (within 20 deg. or 30 deg.) to the opposite pole of the Milky Way. He  concluded \"that the nebulous system is distinct from the sidereal, though  involving, and perhaps to a certain extent intermixed with, the  latter.\"[124]    Towards the close of his residence at Feldhausen, Herschel was fortunate  enough to witness one of those singular changes in the aspect of the  firmament which occasionally challenge the attention even of the  incurious, and excite the deepest wonder of the philosophical observer.  Immersed apparently in the Argo nebula is a star denominated Eta  Carinae. When Halley visited St. Helena in 1677, it seemed of the fourth  magnitude; but Lacaille in the middle of the following century, and  others after him, classed it as of the second. In 1827 the traveller  Burchell, being then at St. Paul, near Rio Janeiro, remarked that it had  unexpectedly assumed the first rank--a circumstance the more surprising  to him because he had frequently, when in Africa during the years 1811  to 1815, noted it as of only fourth magnitude. This observation,  however, did not become generally known until later.

No form of death could be more pitiless or helpless for  the soldier than this. He becomes a target on a spit, as it were.    Granted that the barbed wire is swept away perfectly, no charge can  succeed if many machine guns or rifles from the trenches are playing  upon it. Then men simply rush into a spray of bullets. Therefore,  all the teeth must be drawn from the trench itself. This is done by  the concentration of high-explosive shells from guns of larger  caliber, mostly howitzers, which burst in the earth, tossing up  great fountains of dust, burying and smashing the machine guns and  driving all the operators into their dugouts, where they are  sometimes buried alive.    Back of the trench, the guns of smaller caliber which destroy the  barbed wire place a \"curtain of fire,\" as it is called, which does  not permit the enemy to escape from a trench, or any reserves to  come to his assistance. This process is kept up for such a length of  time as is deemed sufficient. At a given moment, the invader  charges, often protected by a screen of smoke which is sent out from  his own trenches.    As the burrowers in the earth crawl from the parapets and take to  their legs, they know that their fate is almost altogether dependent  upon the preparation by the guns rather than any effort of their  own. Ahead of them is this wall of smoke and dust from the  explosions, in which they are lost to the observer. Keeping units  together and protecting them is as difficult as maneuvering ships in  a fog. The delicate problem of the gunner is to protect the invader  just as far forward as possible, without putting shells into his own  men. A few from defective fuses must fall short. This is expected  and is a part of the cost of a charge; but none with correct fuses  and dependable powder should. The gunners time their part to that of  the invader, by lifting their fire from the first to the second line  trench, as their own men are entering the first.    Granted that the barbed wire is cleared and the men enter the  enemy's trench, they may find themselves struggling over heaps of  dust mixed with the rags of sandbags, splintered timbers and the  flesh and uniforms of their enemy--at first see not a single  adversary. They will be instantly due for heavy shell fire; and also  for heavy machine gun and rifle fire from the second line enemy  trench. They begin to dig at once in order to establish protection.  Out of this wreckage they have to reverse the enemy's trench, so  that it shall face toward him. This becomes a matter of desperate  effort and usually it is in the course of this that the severest  casualties are suffered. But should the artillery destruction of the  trench be imperfect, upon entering it they may still take the enemy  by surprise in his dugouts. In that case, bombs in hand, at the  doorways of these cellars they demand surrender. In case it is not  given, they throw the bombs into the dugout; for, to enter, means  that they will be shot down.    Or, upon entering the trench, they may meet the enemy's soldiers  running out of their dugouts for hand-to-hand battle. The traverses  are so narrow that the length of the rifle makes it a clumsy weapon,  and the adversaries in modern war, whose guns carry twenty miles,  engage hand to hand, using knives, bombs and even their fists. With  discarded rifles and bombs lying about a trench, it is difficult to  give quarter. For a prisoner who is down may pick up a rifle or a  bomb and turn on his captor. It is not human savagery so much as  conditions that has made the fighting so grim. Having established  themselves in a certain section or sections of the trench, naturally  the new occupants have the enemy on their right and left. That is,  on one side of one of the winding traverses will be a German, and  say on the other side a Frenchman. Neither sees the other's head,  for both are hidden behind these walls of earth. If one starts  around the corner, it means a bayonet or a bullet for him.    To gain ground in a trench requires a superior supply of bombs. Any  small package that will contain a high explosive would serve the  purpose. Early in the war, bombs were made out of jam tins and bottles  or any other receptacle which could be filled with an explosive and  set off by a fuse. Later on, different varieties of manufactured bombs  in great quantities appeared. There have been instances of five  thousand being used in a single day over two hundred yards of trench.  After throwing a bomb from the traverse, the offensive follows up the  explosion by rushing along the traverse and catching the defender with  a bayonet while he is _hors de combat_ from the effect of the  explosion. While this orgy--characteristic of cave dwellers battling  on a precipice in its ferocity--is proceeding, all is precision at the  rear. As the caissons bring up the supplies of ammunition, the  green-curtained motor ambulances speed on to the hospital with the  wounded and the military police direct the congested traffic and keep  watch for spies.      VITAL LESSONS    War is force, violence, killing. Whoever tries to disguise its character  is a poor soldier and a poorer citizen. If you would avoid it, and if  you would prepare for it, you must look at it as a fact, squarely in  the face. Never has war been so savage as it is in this most progressive  age in history. We had popular education, aseptic surgery, the wireless,  and antitoxin, but war came nevertheless, and in the wake of Hague  conferences and much preaching of internationalism. It came when the  nations were supposed on account of the press and the telegraph to have  been farther removed from parochialism than ever before, when more  people in every nation in Europe knew the language of their neighbors  than ever in history.    In the cave dweller's time, combatants used a stone hatchet which  was the best weapon that science could produce. To-day by land and  sea they have used all the powers of destruction known to modern  man; all the scientific brains of Europe have been at the disposal  of commanders. Yet no single revolutionary invention has appeared in  the course of the war. The idea of the gas was old. Man already had  learned to fly. Guns have been larger and shells more powerful, but  the principle is the same. Weapons have been further developed, but  the types have not changed.    All the essential lessons which the Germans applied they learned in  the Russo-Japanese War. The line of trenches throughout the winter  of 1904-05 before Mukden were much the same type as those along the  Aisne. There were trenches in the Civil War and in the Crimea, and  in the American Revolution and in many wars before that. So far as  one can learn, there has not been a single invention by a civilian  which would have been of any use to the British navy in fighting  submarines. All have been devised and applied by naval experts who  knew conditions. No profession is more expert than soldiering and  none is older, because it began when Cain killed Abel.    War being the ultimate resort of force, then the poet, the dreamer,  the scholar, the doctor and the organizer of the arts of peace may  succumb to the bully with the square jaw, the low brow and  flesh-tearing incisors, unless the civilized man uses his resources  and talents to make weapons which are stronger than the bully's  fist. This is precisely what civilization does in order to protect  itself.    The two forces which were really prepared for this war were the  British navy and the German army. The British navy has kept command  of the seas and the German army has planted its trenches on foreign  soil. For any nation which is separated from other nations by the  sea, the military lesson of this war is that the sea is the first  line of defense. You will escape bloody trenches at home if you  never allow an enemy to land. He cannot land until he has driven  your navy off the seas.    The other lesson is that a nation should know its method of defense  and have it as complete, practicable and ready as the German army  and British navies were. For three or four years, the Belgians saw  the Germans constructing railroad sidings at Aix and making their  preparations for the blow they struck. Yet the Belgians did not  modernize their forts, or adequately strengthen their army for  defense. If to the staffs of England and France war seemed  inevitable, their governments refused to be convinced.    Any nation which is considering preparedness for national defense  must have a national policy. It must know what it is going to defend  and how it is going to defend it. The British navy was built for the  specific problem of either defeating the German navy in battle or  keeping it fast in its lair. The German army was organized for the  purpose of the invasion of France and then of Russia; the French  army for defense from Germany.    Their efficiency was not the result of the expenditure of money, for  money will not buy defense. It requires training, organization, and  patriotism, and courage, which are not for sale in the market places  of mankind.    Until this war the opinion among English-speaking peoples was  universal that the volunteer system was the best method of  recruiting. This on the principle that the man who offers himself to  fight, fights better than the one who is called to arms by  government order. Thus England raised 3,000,000 men. But to a man  who has lived much with armies, it seems an immoral method; it means  hiring men to fight for you. One man's life is just as valuable to  him as another's. It is the final sacrifice which he makes for the  defense of his country or his home. He should make it himself and  not ask others to make it for him. Those who should be the first  into battle are the men of wealth, of position, the favored ones.  They owe their country more than the"]]]
