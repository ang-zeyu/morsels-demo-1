His ploughs were much in demand, and his need  for steel led him to have larger and larger quantities produced for  him, and the establishment which still bears his name grew to large  proportions.    Another skilled blacksmith, William Parlin, at Canton, Illinois, began  making ploughs about 1842, which he loaded upon a wagon and peddled  through the country. Later his establishment grew large. Another John  Lane, a son of the first, patented in 1868 a \"soft-center\" steel plough.  The hard but brittle surface was backed by softer and more tenacious  metal, to reduce the breakage. The same year James Oliver, a Scotch  immigrant who had settled at South Bend, Indiana, received a patent for  the \"chilled plough.\" By an ingenious method the wearing surfaces of the  casting were cooled more quickly than the back. The surfaces which came  in contact with the soil had a hard, glassy surface, while the body  of the plough was of tough iron. From small beginnings Oliver's  establishment grew great, and the Oliver Chilled Plow Works at South  Bend is today one of the largest and most favorably known privately  owned industries in the United States.    From the single plough it was only a step to two or more ploughs  fastened together, doing more work with approximately the same man  power. The sulky plough, on which the ploughman rode, made his work  easier, and gave him great control. Such ploughs were certainly in  use as early as 1844, perhaps earlier. The next step forward was to  substitute for horses a traction engine. Today one may see on thousands  of farms a tractor pulling six, eight, ten, or more ploughs, doing the  work better than it could be done by an individual ploughman. On the  \"Bonanza\" farms of the West a fifty horsepower engine draws sixteen  ploughs, followed by harrows and a grain drill, and performs the three  operations of ploughing, harrowing, and planting at the same time and  covers fifty acres or more in a day.    The basic ideas in drills for small grains were successfully developed  in Great Britain, and many British drills were sold in the United States  before one was manufactured here. American manufacture of these drills  began about 1840. Planters for corn came somewhat later. Machines to  plant wheat successfully were unsuited to corn, which must be planted  less profusely than wheat.    The American pioneers had only a sickle or a scythe with which to cut  their grain. The addition to the scythe of wooden fingers, against which  the grain might lie until the end of the swing, was a natural step, and  seems to have been taken quite independently in several places, perhaps  as early as 1803. Grain cradles are still used in hilly regions and in  those parts of the country where little grain is grown.    The first attempts to build a machine to cut grain were made in England  and Scotland, several of them in the eighteenth century; and in 1822  Henry Ogle, a schoolmaster in Rennington, made a mechanical reaper,  but the opposition of the laborers of the vicinity, who feared loss  of employment, prevented further development. In 1826, Patrick Bell, a  young Scotch student, afterward a Presbyterian minister, who had  been moved by the fatigue of the harvesters upon his father's farm in  Argyllshire, made an attempt to lighten their labor. His reaper was  pushed by horses; a reel brought the grain against blades which opened  and closed like scissors, and a traveling canvas apron deposited the  grain at one side. The inventor received a prize from the Highland and  Agricultural Society of Edinburgh, and pictures and full descriptions of  his invention were published. Several models of this reaper were built  in Great Britain, and it is said that four came to the United States;  however this may be, Bell's machine was never generally adopted.    Soon afterward three men patented reapers in the United States: William  Manning, Plainfield, New Jersey, 1831; Obed Hussey, Cincinnati, Ohio,  1833; and Cyrus Hall McCormick, Staunton, Virginia, 1834. Just how much  they owed to Patrick Bell cannot be known, but it is probable that all  had heard of his design if they had not seen his drawings or the machine  itself. The first of these inventors, Manning of New Jersey, drops out  of the story, for it is not known whether he ever made a machine other  than his model. More persistent was Obed Hussey of Cincinnati, who soon  moved to Baltimore to fight out the issue with McCormick. Hussey was an  excellent mechanic. He patented several improvements to his machine and  received high praise for the efficiency of the work. But he was soon  outstripped in the race because he was weak in the essential qualities  which made McCormick the greatest figure in the world of agricultural  machinery. McCormick was more than a mechanic; he was a man of vision;  and he had the enthusiasm of a crusader and superb genius for business  organization and advertisement. His story has been told in another  volume of this series.*         * \"The Age of Big Business\", by Burton J. Hendrick.      Though McCormick offered reapers for sale in 1834, he seems to have  sold none in that year, nor any for six years afterwards. He sold two in  1840, seven in 1842, fifty in 1844. The machine was not really adapted  to the hills of the Valley of Virginia, and farmers hesitated to buy a  contrivance which needed the attention of a skilled mechanic. McCormick  made a trip through the Middle West. In the rolling prairies, mile after  mile of rich soil without a tree or a stone, he saw his future dominion.  Hussey had moved East. McCormick did the opposite; he moved West, to  Chicago, in 1847.    Chicago was then a town of hardly ten thousand, but McCormick foresaw  its future, built a factory there, and manufactured five hundred  machines for the harvest of 1848. From this time he went on from triumph  to triumph. He formulated an elaborate business system. His machines  were to be sold at a fixed price, payable in installments if desired,  with a guarantee of satisfaction. He set up a system of agencies to  give instruction or to supply spare parts. Advertising, chiefly by  exhibitions and contests at fairs and other public gatherings, was  another item of his programme. All would have failed, of course, if he  had not built good machines, but he did build good machines, and was  not daunted by the Government's refusal in 1848 to renew his original  patent. He decided to make profits as a manufacturer rather than accept  royalties as an inventor.    McCormick had many competitors, and some of them were in the field with  improved devices ahead of him, but he always held his own, either by  buying up the patent for a real improvement, or else by requiring his  staff to invent something to do the same work. Numerous new devices  to improve the harvester were patented, but the most important was an  automatic attachment to bind the sheaves with wire. This was patented in  1872, and McCormick soon made it his own. The harvester seemed complete.  One man drove the team, and the machine cut the grain, bound it in  sheaves, and deposited them upon the ground.    Presently, however, complaints were heard of the wire tie. When the  wheat was threshed, bits of wire got into the straw, and were swallowed  by the cattle; or else the bits of metal got among the wheat itself and  gave out sparks in grinding, setting some mills on fire. Two inventors,  almost simultaneously, produced the remedy. Marquis L. Gorham, working  for McCormick, and John F. Appleby, whose invention was purchased by  William Deering, one of McCormick's chief competitors, invented binders  which used twine. By 1880 the self-binding harvester was complete. No  distinctive improvement has been made since, except to add strength and  simplification. The machine now needed the services of only two men, one  to drive and the other to shock the bundles, and could reap twenty acres  or more a day, tie the grain into bundles of uniform size, and dump them  in piles of five ready to be shocked.    Grain must be separated from the straw and chaff. The Biblical threshing  floor, on which oxen or horses trampled out the grain, was still common  in Washington's time, though it had been largely succeeded by the  flail. In Great Britain several threshing machines were devised in the  eighteenth century, but none was particularly successful. They were  stationary, and it was necessary to bring the sheaves to them. The  seventh patent issued by the United States, to Samuel Mulliken of  Philadelphia, was for a threshing machine. The portable horse-power  treadmill, invented in 1830 by Hiram A. and John A. Pitts of Winthrop,  Maine, was presently coupled with a thresher, or \"separator,\" and this  outfit, with its men and horses, moving from farm to farm, soon became  an autumn feature of every neighborhood. The treadmill was later on  succeeded--by the traction engine, and the apparatus now in common use  is an engine which draws the greatly improved threshing machine from  farm to farm, and when the destination is reached, furnishes the power  to drive the thresher. Many of these engines are adapted to the use of  straw as fuel.    Another development was the combination harvester and thresher used on  the larger farms of the West. This machine does not cut the wheat close  to the ground, but the cutter-bar, over twenty-five feet in length,  takes off the heads. The wheat is separated from the chaff and  automatically weighed into sacks, which are dumped as fast as two expert  sewers can work. The motive power is a traction engine or else twenty to  thirty horses, and seventy-five acres a day can be reaped and threshed.  Often another tractor pulling a dozen wagons follows and the sacks are  picked up and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29031"],[0,"Sir William Herschel: His Life and Works (#15)"],[1,"as if I had been      conversing with a supernatural intelligence. 'Nay, more,' said he,      'if those distant bodies had ceased to exist two millions of years      ago, we should still see them, as the light would travel after the      body was gone. . . .' These were HERSCHEL'S words; and if you had      heard him speak them, you would not think he was apt to tell more      than the truth.        \"After leaving HERSCHEL I felt elevated and overcome; and have in      writing to you made only this memorandum of some of the most      interesting moments of my life.\"    CAMPBELL'S conscientious biographer appears to have felt that the value  of this charming account of his interview with HERSCHEL was in its  report of astronomical facts and opinions, and he adds a foot-note to  explain that \"HERSCHEL'S opinion never amounted to more than  _hypothesis_ having some degree of probability. Sir JOHN HERSCHEL  remembers his father saying, 'If that hypothesis were true, and _if_ the  planet destroyed were as large as the earth, there must have been at  least thirty-thousand such fragments,' but always as an hypothesis--he  was never heard to declare any degree of conviction that it was so.\"    For us, the value of this sympathetic account of a day in HERSCHEL'S  life is in its conception of the simplicity, the modesty, the \"boyish  earnestness,\" the elevation of thought and speech of the old  philosopher; and in the impression made on the feelings, not the mind,  of the poet, then thirty-five years old.    In a letter to ALISON, CAMPBELL reverts with great pleasure to the day  spent with HERSCHEL:                                             \"SYDENHAM, _December 12, 1813_.    \"MY DEAREST ALISON:--           *       *       *       *       *        \"I spent three weeks with my family at Brighton, in charming      weather, and was much pleased with, as well as benefited by, the      place. There I met a man with whom you will stare at the idea of my      being congenial, or having the vanity to think myself so--the great      HERSCHEL. He is a simple, great being. . . . I once in my life      looked at NEWTON'S _Principia_, and attended an astronomical class      at Glasgow; wonderful it seemed to myself, that the great man      condescended to understand my questions; to become apparently      earnest in communicating to me as much information as my limited      capacity and preparation for such knowledge would admit. He invited      me to see him at his own abode, and so kindly that I could not      believe that it was mere good breeding; but a sincere wish to see me      again. I had a full day with him; he described to me his whole      interview with BUONAPARTE; said it was not true, as reported, that      BUONAPARTE understood astronomical subjects deeply, but affected      more than he knew.        \"In speaking of his great and chief telescope, he said with an air,      not of the least pride, but with a greatness and simplicity of      expression that struck me with wonder, 'I have looked further into      space than ever human being did before me. I have observed stars, of      which the light takes _two millions_ of years to travel to this      globe.' I mean to pay him a reverential visit at Slough, as soon as      my book is out, this winter.\"           *       *       *       *       *    In 1807 CAROLINA HERSCHEL has this entry in her diary:        \"_October_ 4.--My brother came from Brighton. The same night two      parties from the Castle came to see the comet, and during the whole      month my brother had not an evening to himself. As he was then in      the midst of polishing the forty-foot mirror, rest became absolutely      necessary after a day spent in that most laborious work; and it has      ever been my opinion that on the 14th of October his nerves received      a shock of which he never got the better afterwards.\"    In the spring of 1808 he was quite seriously ill; but in May the  observing went on again. In 1809 and 1810 his principal investigations  were upon physical subjects (NEWTON'S rings), and in 1811 the only long  series of observations was upon the comet of that year. After 1811 the  state of HERSCHEL'S health required that his observations should be  much less frequent. Much of the time after 1811 he was absent, and his  work at home consisted largely in arranging the results of his previous  labors, and in computations connected with them. All through the years  1814 to 1822, HERSCHEL'S health was very feeble. The severe winter of  1813-14 had told materially upon him. In 1814, however, he undertook to  repolish the forty-foot mirror, but was obliged to give it over.    He now found it necessary to make frequent little excursions for change  of air and scene. His faithful sister remained at home, bringing order  into the masses of manuscript, and copying the papers for the Royal  Society.    She was sick at heart, fearing that each time she saw her brother it  would be the last. In 1818 she says:        \"Feb. 11, I went to my brother and remained with him till the 23d.      We spent our time, though not in idleness, in sorrow and sadness.      He is not only unwell, but low in spirits.\"    In 1818 (December 16), HERSCHEL went to London to have his portrait  painted by ARTAUD. While he was in London his will was made.[28]    In 1819 there is a glimmer of the old-time light. In a note HERSCHEL  says:        \"LINA:--There is a great comet. I want you to assist me. Come to      dine and spend the day here. If you can come soon after one o'clock,      we shall have time to prepare maps and telescopes. I saw its      situation last night. It has a long tail.        \"_July 4, 1819._\"    This note has been carefully kept by his sister, and on it she has  written: \"I keep this as a relic. Every line _now_ traced by the hand of  my dear brother becomes a treasure to me.\"    So the next three years passed away. Sir WILLIAM[29] was daily more and  more feeble. He spent his time in putting his works in order, but could  devote only a few moments each day to this. His sister says:        \"_Aug. 11th_, _12th_, _13th_, and _14th_ [1822], I went as usual to      spend some hours of the forenoon with my brother.        \"_Aug. 15th._--I hastened to the spot where I was wont to find him,      with the newspaper which I was to read to him. But instead I found      Mrs. MONSON, Miss BALDWIN, and Mr. BULMAN, from Leeds, the grandson      of my brother's earliest acquaintance in this country. I was      informed my brother had been obliged to return to his room, whither      I flew immediately. Lady H. and the housekeeper were with him,      administering everything which could be thought of for supporting      him. I found him much irritated at not being able to grant Mr.      BULMAN'S request for some token of remembrance for his father. As      soon as he saw me, I was sent to the library to fetch one of his      last papers and a plate of the forty-foot telescope. But for the      universe I could not have looked twice at what I had snatched from      the shelf, and when he faintly asked if the breaking up of the Milky      Way was in it, I said 'Yes,' and he looked content. I cannot help      remembering this circumstance; it was the last time I was sent to      the library on such an occasion. That the anxious care for his      papers and workrooms never ended but with his life, was proved by      his frequent whispered inquiries if they were locked and the key      safe, of which I took care to assure him that they were, and the key      in Lady HERSCHEL'S hands.        \"After half an hour's vain attempt to support himself, my brother      was obliged to consent to be put to bed, leaving no hope ever to see      him rise again.\"    On the 25th of August, 1822, HERSCHEL died peacefully at the age of  eighty-four years.    His remains lie in the little church at Upton, near Windsor, where a  memorial tablet has been erected by his son. The epitaph is as  follows:[30]                                 H. S.
