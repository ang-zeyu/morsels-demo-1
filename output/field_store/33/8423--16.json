A strikingly pretty, well-clad, and pleasingly coloured North American  quadruped, of which many zoological anecdotes might be given. Linnaeus  named it _Ursu lotor_, or the Washer, from its curious habit of putting  any food offered to it, at least when in confinement, into water, before  attempting to eat it.      \"A GONE COON.\"    An American phrase for \"the last extremity,\" or, \"it's all up.\" They say  that a Major, or Colonel, or General Scott \"down South\" was notorious as  a dead shot. Once on a time, when out with his gun, he espied a raccoon  on a lofty tree. The poor raccoon, noticing the gun pointed at him,  cried to the dead shot, \"Air _you_ General Scott?\"--\"I air.\"--\"Then  wait, I air a comin' down, for I air _a gone coon_.\"          BADGER.      The badger, or brock, as it is called in Scotland, is yearly becoming  more and more rare. In a few years, this curious and powerful member of  the _ferae_, will figure, like the bear and beaver, as among the extinct  quadrupeds of these islands. Naturalists will be recording that in the  days of Robert Burns it must have been not at all uncommon, and not rare  in those of Hugh Miller, since low dram-shops kept them for the  entertainment of their guests. The Ayrshire bard makes the Newfoundland  dog, Caesar, say to his comrade Luath, the collie, when, speaking of most  of the gentry of his day--       \"They gang as saucy by poor folk     As I wad by a stinking brock.\"[42]    The author of \"Old Red Sandstone\" and \"My Schools and Schoolmasters,\"  has recorded in the latter work the history of his employment as a hewer  of great stones under the branching foliage of the elm and chestnut  trees of Niddry Park, near Edinburgh, and how, in the course of a strike  among the masons, he marched into town with several of them to a meeting  on the Links, where, conspicuous from the deep red hue of their clothes  and aprons, they were cheered as a reinforcement from a distance. On  adjourning, Hugh Miller, in his racy style, gives the following account  of a badger-baiting more than forty years ago:--      HUGH MILLER AND THE BADGER-BAITING IN THE CANONGATE.    \"My comrades proposed that we should pass the time until the hour of  meeting in a public-house, and, desirous of securing a glimpse of the  sort of enjoyment for which they sacrificed so much, I accompanied them.  Passing not a few more inviting-looking places, we entered a low tavern  in the upper part of the Canongate, kept in an old half-ruinous  building, which has since disappeared. We passed on through a narrow  passage to a low-roofed room in the centre of the erection, into which  the light of day never penetrated, and in which the gas was burning  dimly in a close, sluggish atmosphere, rendered still more stifling by  tobacco-smoke, and a strong smell of ardent spirits. In the middle of  the crazy floor there was a trap-door, which lay open at the time; and a  wild combination of sounds, in which the yelping of a dog, and a few  gruff voices that seemed cheering him on, were most noticeable, rose  from the apartment below. It was customary at this time for dram-shops  to keep badgers housed in long narrow boxes, and for working men to keep  dogs; and it was part of the ordinary sport of such places to set the  dogs to unhouse the badgers. The wild sport which Scott describes in his  'Guy Mannering,' as pursued by Dandy Dinmont and his associates among  the Cheviots, was extensively practised twenty-nine years ago amid the  dingier haunts of the High Street and Canongate. Our party, like most  others, had its dog,--a repulsive-looking brute, with an earth-directed  eye; as if he carried about with him an evil conscience; and my  companions were desirous of getting his earthing ability tested upon the  badger of the establishment; but on summoning the tavern-keeper, we were  told that the party below had got the start of us. Their dog was, as we  might hear, 'just drawing the badger; and before our dog could be  permitted to draw him, the poor brute would require to get an hour's  rest.' I need scarce say, that the hour was spent in hard drinking in  that stagnant atmosphere; and we then all descended through the  trap-door, by means of a ladder, into a bare-walled dungeon, dark and  damp, and where the pestiferous air smelt like that of a burial vault.  The scene which followed was exceedingly repulsive and brutal,--nearly  as much so as some of the scenes furnished by those otter-hunts in which  the aristocracy of the country delight occasionally to indulge. Amid  shouts and yells the badger, with the blood of his recent conflict still  fresh upon him, was again drawn to the box-mouth; and the party  returning satisfied to the apartment above, again betook themselves to  hard drinking. In a short time the liquor began to tell, not first, as  might be supposed, on our younger men, who were mostly tall, vigorous  fellows, in the first flush of their full strength, but on a few of the  middle-aged workmen, whose constitutions seemed undermined by a previous  course of dissipation and debauchery. The conversation became very loud,  very involved, and though highly seasoned with emphatic oaths, very  insipid; and leaving with Cha--who seemed somewhat uneasy that my eye  should be upon their meeting in its hour of weakness--money enough to  clear off my share of the reckoning, I stole out to the King's Park, and  passed an hour to better purpose among the trap rocks than I could  possibly have spent it beside the trap-door of that tavern party. I am  not aware that a single individual, save the writer, is now living; its  very dog did not live out half his days. His owner was alarmed one  morning, shortly after this time, by the intelligence that a dozen of  sheep had been worried during the night on a neighbouring farm, and that  a dog very like his had been seen prowling about the fold; but in order  to determine the point, he would be visited, it was added, in the course  of the day, by the shepherd and a law-officer. The dog meanwhile,  however, conscious of guilt,--for dogs do seem to have consciences in  such matters,--was nowhere to be found, though, after the lapse of  nearly a week, he again appeared at the work; and his master, slipping a  rope round his neck, brought him to a deserted coal-pit half-filled with  water, that opened in an adjacent field, and flinging him in, left the  authorities no clue by which to establish his identity with the robber  and assassin of the fold.\"[43]      THE LAIRD OF BALNAMOON AND THE BROCK.    The laird, so Dean Ramsay had the story sent him, once riding past a  high steep bank, stopped opposite a hole in it, and said, \"John, I saw a  brock gang in there.\"--\"Did ye?\" said John; \"wull ye haud my horse,  sir?\"--\"Certainly,\" said the laird, and away rushed John for a spade.  After digging for half an hour, he came back, nigh speechless to the  laird, who had regarded him musingly. \"I canna find him, sir,\" said  John.--\"'Deed,\" said the laird, very coolly, \"I wad ha' wondered if ye  had, for it's ten years sin' I saw him gang in there.\"[44]    FOOTNOTES:    [42] Poems, chiefly in the Scottish Dialect, 1787, p. 14, \"The Twa  Dogs.\"          FERRET.      A truly blood-thirsty member of that slim-bodied but active race, the  weasel tribe. He is certainly an inhabitant of a warmer climate than  this, being very sensitive to cold. He is used in killing rats and  _ferreting out_ rabbits, a verb indeed derived from his name. He has  been known to attack sleeping infants.      COLLINS AND THE RAT-CATCHERS _grip_ OF HIS FERRETS.    That delightful painter of cottage life, says his son,[45] often found  cottagers who gloried in being painted, and who sat like professional  models, under an erroneous impression that it was for their personal  beauties and perfections that their likenesses were portrayed. The  remarks of these and other good people, who sat to the painter in  perfect ignorance of the use or object of his labours, were often  exquisitely original. He used to quote the criticism of a celebrated  country rat-catcher, on the study he had made from him, with hearty  triumph and delight. When asked whether he thought his portrait like,  the rat-catcher, who--perhaps in virtue of his calling--was a gruff and  unhesitating man, immediately declared that the face was \"not a morsel  like,\" but vowed with a great oath, that nothing could ever be equal to  the correctness of the _dirt shine on his old leather breeches_, and the  _grip_ that he had of _the necks of his ferrets_!

To this day I  regret that my calculations went \"agley\"; but I was told that  accommodation was not to be secured at Malta \"for love or money,\" and so  I shook the dust from my feet, and boarded an evening train for my next  stopping-place, which was Buena Vista.    The elevation of this beautiful mountain town is seven thousand nine  hundred and sixty-seven feet. It nestles amid cottonwood trees and green  meadows in a wide valley or park, and is flanked on the east by the  rolling and roaring Arkansas River, while to the west the plain slopes  up gradually to the foothills of the three towering college  peaks,--Harvard, Yale, and Princeton,--crowned all the year with snow.  And here were birds in plenty. Before daybreak the avian concert began  with the shrieking of the western wood-pewees--a vocal performance that  they, in their innocence, seriously mistake for melody--and continued  until night had again settled on the vale. In this place I spent three  or four days, giving myself up to my favorite study and pastime, and a  list of all the birds that I saw in the neighborhood would surprise the  reader. However, a mere catalogue would be of slight interest, I  apprehend, and therefore mention will be made only of those species  which I had not seen elsewhere, passing by such familiar feathered folk  as the Arkansas goldfinches, catbirds, western meadow-larks, Brewer's  blackbirds, house-finches, green-tailed towhees, magpies, long-crested  jays, summer warblers, and many others, begging their pardon, of course,  for paying them such scant courtesy.    Early on a bright morning I was following one of the streets of the  village, when, on reaching the suburbs, I was greeted by a blithe,  dulcet trill which could come from no other vocalist than the  song-sparrow. His tones and vocalization were precisely like those of  _Melospiza fasciata_, to which I have so often listened in my native  State of Ohio. It was a dulcet strain, and stirred memories half sad,  half glad, of many a charming ramble about my eastern home when the  song-sparrows were the chief choralists in the outdoor opera festival.  Peering into the bushes that fringed the gurgling mountain brook, I soon  caught sight of the little triller, and found that, so far as I could  distinguish them with my field-glass, his markings were just like those  of his eastern relative--the same mottled breast, with the large dusky  blotch in the centre.    Delighted as I was with the bird's aria, I could not decide whether this  was the common song-sparrow or the mountain song-sparrow. Something  over a week earlier I had seen what I took to be the mountain  song-sparrow in a green nook below the summit of Pike's Peak, and had  noted his trill as a rather shabby performance in comparison with the  tinkling chansons of the song-sparrow of the East. Had I mistaken some  other bird for the mountain song-sparrow? Or was the Buena Vista bird  the common song-sparrow which had gone entirely beyond its Colorado  range? Consulting Professor W. W. Cooke's list of Colorado birds, I  found that _Melospiza fasciata_ is marked \"migratory, rare,\" and has  been known thus far only in the extreme eastern part of the State;  whereas _Melospiza fasciata montana_ is a summer resident, \"common  throughout the State in migration, and not uncommon as a breeder from  the plains to eight thousand feet.\"    But Professor Cooke fails to give a clue to the song of either variety,  and therefore my little problem remains unsolved, as I could not think  of taking the life of a dulcet-voiced bird merely to discover whether it  should have \"_montana_\" affixed to its scientific name or not. All I can  say is, if this soloist was a mountain song-sparrow, he reproduced  exactly the trills of his half-brothers of the East.[7] On the morning  of my departure from Buena Vista another song-sparrow sang his matins,  in loud, clear tones among the bushes of a stream that flowed through  the town, ringing quite a number of changes in his tune, all of them  familiar to my ear from long acquaintance with the eastern forms of the  _Melospiza_ subfamily.        [7] The problem has since been solved, through the aid of Mr. Aiken.      The Buena Vista bird was _montana_, while the bird in the Pike's      Peak hollow was Lincoln's sparrow.    How well I recall a rainy afternoon during my stay at Buena Vista! The  rain was not so much of a downpour as to drive me indoors, although it  made rambling in the bushes somewhat unpleasant. What was this haunting  song that rose from a thick copse fringing one of the babbling mountain  brooks? It mingled sweetly with the patter of the rain upon the leaves.  Surely it was the song of the veery thrush! The same rich, melodious  strain, sounding as if it were blown through a wind-harp, setting all  the strings a-tune at the same time. Too long and closely had I studied  the veery's minstrelsy in his summer haunts in northern Minnesota to be  deceived now--unless, indeed, this fertile avian region produced another  thrush which whistled precisely the same tune. The bird's alarm-call was  also like that of the veery. The few glimpses he permitted of his  flitting, shadowy form convinced me that he must be a veery, and so I  entered him in my note-book.    But on looking up the matter--for the bird student must aim at  accuracy--what was my surprise to find that the Colorado ornithologists  have decided that the veery thrush is not a resident of the State, nor  even an occasional visitor! Of course I could not set up my judgment  against that of those scientific gentlemen. But what could this minstrel  be? I wrote to my friend, Mr. Charles E. Aiken, of Colorado Springs, who  replied that the bird was undoubtedly the willow thrush, which is the  western representative of the veery. I am willing to abide by this  decision, especially as Ridgway indicates in his Manual that there is  very little difference in the coloration of the two varieties. One more  mile-post had been passed in my never-ending ornithological journey--I  had learned for myself and others that the willow thrush of the Rockies  and the veery of our Eastern and Middle States have practically the same  musical repertory, and nowhere in the East or the West is sweeter and  more haunting avian minstrelsy to be heard, if only it did not give one  that sad feeling which Heine calls _Heimweh_!    [Illustration: _Willow Thrush_]          A ROCKY MOUNTAIN LAKE    [Illustration: PLATE IV    LARK BUNTING--_Calamospiza melanocorys_  (Upper figure, male; lower, female)]      \"You will find a small lake just about a mile from town. Follow the road  leading out this way\"--indicating the direction--\"until you come to a  red gate. The lake is private property, but you can go right in, as you  don't shoot. No one will drive you out. I think you will find it an  interesting place for bird study.\"    [Illustration: _Brewer's Blackbirds_    \"_An interesting place for bird study_\"]    The foregoing is what my landlord told me one morning at Buena Vista.  Nor did I waste time in finding the way to the lake, a small sheet of  water, as clear as crystal, embowered in the lovely park lying between  towering, snow-clad mountains. One might almost call the spot a bird's  Arcadia. In no place, in all my tramping among the Rockies, did I find  so many birds in an equal area.    In the green, irrigated meadow bordering one side of the sheet of water,  I was pleased to find a number of Brewer's blackbirds busily gathering  food in the wet grass for their young. And who or what are Brewer's  blackbirds? In the East, the purple and bronzed grackles, or crow  blackbirds, are found in great abundance; but in Colorado these birds  are replaced by Brewer's blackbirds, which closely resemble their  eastern kinsfolk, although not quite so large. The iridescence of the  plumage is somewhat different in the two species, but in both the golden  eye-balls show white at a distance. When I first saw a couple of  Brewer's blackbirds stalking featly about on a lawn at Manitou, digging  worms and grubs out of the sod, I simply put them down in my note-book  as bronzed or purple grackles--an error that had to be corrected  afterwards, on more careful examination. The mistake shows how close is  the resemblance between the two species.    The Brewer division of the family breed on the plains and in the  mountains, to an altitude of ten thousand feet, always selecting marshy  places for their early summer home; then in August and September, the  breeding season over, large flocks of old and young ascend to the  regions above the timber-line, about thirteen thousand feet above  sea-level, where they swarm over the grassy but treeless mountain sides  in search of food. In October they retire to the plains, in advance of  the austere weather of the great altitudes, and soon the majority of  them hie to a blander climate than Colorado affords in winter.    Still more interesting to me was the large colony of yellow-headed  blackbirds that had taken up their residence in the rushes and flags of  the upper end of the lake. These birds are not such exclusive westerners  as their ebon-hued cousins just described; for I found them breeding at  Lake Minnetonka, near Minneapolis, Minnesota, a few years ago, and they  sometimes straggle, I believe, as far east as Ohio. A most beautiful  bird is this member of the _Icteridae_ family, a kind of Beau Brummel  among his fellows, with his glossy black coat and rich yellow--and even  orange, in highest feather--mantle covering the whole head, neck, and  breast, and a large white, decorative spot on the wings, showing plainly  in flight. He is the handsomest blackbird with which I am acquainted.    At the time of my visit to the lake, the latter part of June, the  yellow-heads were busy feeding their young, many of which had already  left the nest. From the shore, I could see"]]]
