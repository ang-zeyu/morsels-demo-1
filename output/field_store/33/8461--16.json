The hours passed slowly and wearily.  They  began to have serious doubts of ever seeing day again; but it came at  length.    Just as the first faint gleams of the aurora appeared in the east, they  were startled by a sudden crashing among the branches of the tree, and  the next moment, they saw the bridge by which they had reached the rock,  in the act of being carried away by the current!    \"Look out!\" shouted Arend; \"the tree is off.  Keep clear of the  branches, or we shall be swept along with it.\"    All rushed together to the summit of the rock, reaching it just in time  to avoid the danger thus indicated; and, in another moment, their  communication with the main land was entirely cut off.    The dawn of day found them on an islet of stone, of such limited extent  that there was barely standing-room for the three.  The river, swollen  by the flood, lipped close up to their feet, and was threatening to rise  still higher.  There was the prospect--not a very pleasant one--that  they themselves might be carried off after their treacherous bridge.    The elephant was no longer a cause of the slightest anxiety.  The means  by which they might have placed themselves within the reach of that  danger had been removed; and, like Prometheus, they were bound to a  rock.    The banks on both sides were too high for them to effect a landing, even  should they be able to stem the rapid current.  All three could swim,  and it might be possible for them to reach the shore by swimming down  stream to some place where the banks were on a level with the water.    But to this method of getting out of their difficulty, there were  several objections.  Their guns would have to be left behind, and could  not be recovered.  A distant view of them lying upon the rock might be  all they would ever have.  To abandon their arms was a thing not to be  thought of.  Their hunting would be over for that expedition.    Besides, they were in a part of the river where the current was swift,  turbulent, and strong.  It would carry them down with irresistible  force.  The rapids were full of rough jagged rocks, against which their  bodies might be crushed or lacerated; and the chances were that some of  them might never succeed in reaching the shore in safety.    \"And there is another reason why I don't like taking this water trip,\"  said Hendrik.  \"I noticed yesterday, just as we came forward here, a  couple of enormous alligators.  In all likelihood, there are scores of  them.\"    \"Then I say, stop where we are for the present,\" said Arend.  \"Alligators are always hungry, and I don't relish to be eaten by them.\"    \"I am not yet so hungry as to leave my roer behind me; therefore, I  second your proposal,\" said Groot Willem.    It was carried _nemini dissentiente_.  They did stay where they were,  but not very patiently.  The sun ascended high into the heavens.  Its  beams seemed to have their focus on the spot where they were standing.  They never remembered having experienced a day so hot, or one on which  all felt so hungry.  Hendrik and Arend became nearly frantic with the  heat and the hunger, though Groot Willem still preserved a remnant of  calmness.    \"I wonder if that elephant is watching for us yet?\" said he.  \"If so, he  is what Swartboy calls Congo,--an 'ole fool!  I'm sorry we can't oblige  him by paying him a visit, and rewarding him for his prolonged vigil.\"    Willem's attempt at being witty was intended to cheer his disconsolate  companions.  But it was a sad failure.  Neither could reply to it even  by a smile.        CHAPTER TWENTY TWO.    A SEPARATION.    All day long did they stay on the islet of stone.  They were no longer  apprehensive of being swept away by the flood.  They saw that it had  reached its highest, but its subsidence had not yet commenced.    The sun was already in the zenith, hotter than ever, literally roasting  them upon the rock.  The situation was intolerable.    \"Shall we have to stay here another night?\" impatiently asked Hendrik.    \"It looks deuced like it,\" answered Willem.    \"And to-morrow, what shall we do then?\" inquired Arend.  \"There may be  no better chance of getting off than there is now.\"    \"That is true,\" said Willem.  \"We must think of some way of getting out  of this disagreeable prison.  Can any of you think of a plan?\"    \"I have a proposal to make,\" said Hendrik.  \"Let one of us take to the  water and look down stream for a landing-place.  If he succeeds in  reaching the bank in safety, he could come up again, and by swinging out  one of those long climbing plants we see hanging to the trees, there  would be some chance of the other two catching it.  By that means we may  get off.\"    \"That's not a bad idea,\" rejoined Arend; \"but which of us is to run the  risk of the swim.  For my part, I'm quite willing to incur it.\"    \"There is certainly great danger,\" said Hendrik; \"but there is also  danger of starvation if we stay here.\"    \"Quite true,\" rejoined Arend.  \"But for my part, I would rather feed a  crocodile than die of hunger myself.  So I'm willing to risk the swim.  If you don't see me on the bank in three or four hours you may conclude  that either the crocodiles have eaten me, or that I've been shattered  among the rocks.\"    The others would not listen to Arend's self-sacrificing proposal; and  for a time, it was debated among them, as to who should run the risk,  each protesting what under other circumstances he would scarce have  done,--that he was a better swimmer than either of the other two.    As each insisted on taking the peril upon himself,--and none of them  would yield the point, a proposal was made to cast lots.    This was done; and Hendrik, the suggester of the plan, was the one  chosen by fate to carry it into execution.    \"I am glad of it,\" said he, after the thing had been decided.  \"It is  but just that I should be permitted to carry out my own proposal.  So  here goes!\"    Hastily undressing himself, he shook hands with Arend and Willem,  dropped into the flood, and was away with the rapidity of an arrow.    Anxiously the others gazed after him; but in less than three minutes, he  was no longer under their eyes, the rough rapid current having carried  him clean out of sight.    Two hours passed, which were spent by Arend and Groot Willem in, a state  of anxious suspense.  Two hours more and it became terrible.    \"Night is fast approaching,\" remarked Arend.  \"If Hendrik does not  return before night, I shall swim after him.\"    \"Yes, we may as well, while we have the strength to do it,\" answered  Willem.  \"If you go, so will I.  We shall start together.  How long do  you think we should wait?\"    \"Not much longer.  Certainly within a mile, he ought to have found a  place where he could land.  That distance he must soon have made, at the  rate he was travelling when he left us.  He should return soon now, or  never.\"    Another hour passed and still no signs of Hendrik.    \"Remain you, Willem,\" proposed Arend, \"and let me go alone.\"    \"No,\" replied the great hunter; \"we go together.  I once thought that I  should never abandon my gun as long as I lived; but it must be.  We must  not stay here any longer.  I grow weaker every hour.\"    The two were taking off their boots and preparing to enter the water,  when their ears were saluted by the sound of a familiar voice.    Congo was seen upon horseback on the bank of the river, just opposite  the rock.    \"Nebber fear, baas Willem,\" shouted he.  \"I come back by-'m-by.\"    As he said this, he galloped away.  The loud roar of an elephant  proclaiming the cause of his sudden departure.    \"O heavens!\" exclaimed Arend.  \"How much longer must we stay here?\"    \"Until to-morrow, I expect,\" answered Willem.  \"Congo cannot return to  the camp and be back before to-morrow.\"    \"But do you think he will go off without trying to assist us?\"    \"Yes.  What can he do alone?  Nothing.  He knows that, and has gone for  help.  Of himself, he could not kill the elephant; and even if it was  not there, he could do nothing to get us off the rock.\"    \"The distance to the bank must be about twenty yards.  Of course there  is a way by which we may be got ashore; but it will require a rope.  The  climbing plants would do, but Congo has not noticed them.  I believe  that he understood at a glance the difficulties to be overcome, and has  gone to the camp for assistance.\"    \"I hope so,\" replied Arend, \"and, if such be the case, we need not fear  for ourselves.  We have now only to endure the annoyance of waiting.  My  only anxiety is for Hendrik.\"    Willem made no reply, but by his silence Arend could perceive that he  had but little hope of ever seeing Hendrik gain.    Slowly the sun went down and the night once more descended over the  rolling river.  Their anxiety would not allow them to sleep, even had  they not been hindered by hunger.  Of water they had a plentiful  supply,--too much of it,--although this was not obtained without some  difficulty, as they had to dip it up in one of their powder-flasks,  emptied for the purpose.    Another morning dawned, and the sun made his appearance,--again red and  fiery,--his beams becoming fiercer as he ascended the cloudless sky.    They had but a few hours more to wait until they might expect the return  of the Kaffir; but would he surely come?  They knew that travelling in  Africa was a very uncertain business.  Their present position was proof  that some accident might occur to hinder him from reaching the camp.    By this time they were almost certain that some serious misfortune,  perhaps death itself, had befallen Hendrik.    As if to confirm them in this belief, just then three large crocodiles  were seen swimming around the rock, lingering there, as though they  expected ere long to get their sharp teeth into the flesh of those who  stood upon it.    The great hunter became angered at"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27933"],[0,"Forest Neighbors: Life Stories of Wild Animals (#15)"],[1," lessons stood him in good stead, and he was exceedingly well  armed for the chase. It would have been hard to find in all the woods  any teeth better adapted than his to the work of pulling a  fellow-creature to pieces. In front, on both the upper and lower jaws,  were the chisel-shaped incisors. Flanking them were the canines, very  long and slender, and very sharply pointed, thrusting themselves into  the meat like the tines of a carving-fork, and tearing it away in great  shreds. And back of the canines were other teeth that were still larger,  but shorter and broader, and shaped more like notched knife-blades.  Those of the lower jaw worked inside those of the upper, like shears,  and they were very handy for cutting the large chunks into pieces small  enough to go down his throat. By the time he got through with a  partridge there was not much left of it but a puddle of brown feathers.  His claws, too, were very long and white, and very wickedly curved; and  before starting out on a hunt he would often get up on his hind legs  and sharpen those of his forefeet on a tree-trunk, just as your  house-cat sharpens hers on the leg of the kitchen-table. When he wasn't  using them he kept them hidden between his toes, so that they would not  be constantly catching and breaking on roots and things; but all he had  to do when he wanted them was to pull certain muscles, and out they  came, ready to scratch and tear to his heart's content. They were not by  any means full grown as yet, but they bade fair to equal his father's  some day. He was warmly and comfortably clothed, of course, and along  his sides and flanks the hair hung especially thick and long, to protect  his body when he was obliged to wade through light, fluffy snow. When  there was a crust he didn't need it, for his paws were so big and broad  and hairy that at such times they bore him up almost as well as if they  had been two pairs of snow-shoes.    But, well armed, well clad, and well shod though he was, it was  fortunate for the Kitten that his first winter was a mild one--mild,  that is, for the Glimmerglass country. Otherwise things might have gone  very hard with him, and they were none too easy as it was. There were  days when he was even hungrier than his mother had been the night she  serenaded the land-looker, and it was on one of these occasions that he  found a porcupine in a tree and tried to make a meal of him. That was a  memorable experience. The porky was sitting in a crotch, doing nothing  in particular, and when the Kitten approached he simply put his nose  down and his quills up. The Kitten spat at him contemptuously, but  without any apparent effect. Then he put out a big forepaw and tapped  him lightly on the forehead. The porcupine flipped his tail, and the  Kitten jumped back, and spat and hissed harder than ever. He didn't  quite know what to make of this singular-looking creature, but he was  young and rash, besides being awfully, awfully hungry, and in another  minute he pitched in.    The next thing they knew, the porcupine had dropped to the ground, where  he lit in a snow-bank, and presently picked himself up and waddled off  to another tree, while the Kitten--well, the Kitten just sat in the  crotch and cried as hard as ever he could cry. There were quills in his  nose, and quills in his side, and quills in both his forepaws; and every  motion was agony. He himself never knew exactly how he got rid of them  all, so of course I can't tell you. A few of those that were caught only  by their very tips may possibly have dropped out, but it is probable  that most of them broke off and left their points to work deeper and  deeper into the flesh until the skin finally closed over them and they  disappeared. I have no doubt that pieces of those quills are still  wandering about in various parts of his anatomy, like the quart of lead  that \"Little Bobs\" carries around with him, according to Mr. Kipling. It  was weeks before he ceased to feel the pain of them.    For several days after this mishap it was impossible for him to hunt,  and he would certainly have starved to death if it had not been for a  cougar who providentially came to the Glimmerglass on a short visit. The  Kitten found his tracks in the snow the very next day, and cautiously  followed them up, limping as he went, to see what the big fellow had  been doing. For a mile or more the large, round, shapeless  footprints--very much like his own, but on a bigger scale--were spaced  so regularly that it was evident the cougar had been simply walking  along at a very leisurely gait, with nothing to disturb his frame of  mind. But after a while the record showed a remarkable change. The  footprints were only a few inches apart, and his cougarship had carried  himself so low that his body had dragged in the snow and left a deep  furrow behind. The Kitten knew what that meant. He had been there  himself, though not after the same kind of prey. And then the trail  stopped entirely, and for a space the snow lay fresh and virgin and  untrodden. But twenty feet away was the spot where the cougar had come  down on all-fours, only to leap forward again like a ricochetting  cannon-ball; and twenty-five feet farther lay the greater part of the  carcass of a deer.    The Kitten stuffed himself as full as he could hold, and then climbed a  tree and watched. About midnight the cougar appeared, and after he had  eaten his fill and gone away again the Kitten slipped down and ate some  more. He was making up for lost time. For four successive nights the  cougar came and feasted on venison, but after that the Kitten never saw  him or heard of him again. There was still a goodly quantity of meat  left, and it seems somewhat curious that he did not return for it, but  he was a stranger in those parts, and it is probable that he went back  to his old haunts, up toward Whitefish Point, perhaps, or the Grand  Sable. Anyhow, it was very nice for the Kitten, for that deer kept him  in provisions until he was able to take up hunting once more.    He had one rather exciting experience during this period. One day, just  as he was finishing a very enjoyable meal of venison tenderloin, he  heard the tramp of snow-shoes on the crust, and in a moment more that  same land-looker came pacing down a section line and halted squarely in  front of him. Now there are trappers who say that a Canada lynx is a  fool and a coward, that he will run from a small dog, and that he makes  his living entirely by preying on animals that are weaker and more  poorly armed than he. I admit, of course, that the majority of lynxes do  not go ramming around the woods with chips on their shoulders, looking  for hunters armed with bowie-knives and repeating rifles. You wouldn't,  either--not as long as there were rabbits to be had for the stalking.  But on this occasion the Kitten's conduct certainly savored of  recklessness, if not of real bravery. Being entirely unacquainted with  the land-looking profession, he naturally supposed that the man had come  for his deer. And he didn't propose to let him have it. He considered  that that venison belonged to him, and he took his stand on the carcass,  laid his ears back, showed his white teeth, made his eyes blaze, and  spit and growled and snarled defiantly. The land-looker didn't quite  know what to do. His section line lay straight across the deer's body,  and he did not want to leave it for fear of confusing his reckoning, but  the Kitten, though only half grown, looked uncommonly business-like. He  had no gun, nor even a revolver, for he was hunting for pine, not fresh  meat. He had left his half-axe in camp, and when he felt in his pocket  for his jack-knife it was not there. Then he looked about for a club. He  had been told that lynxes always had very thin skulls, and that a light  blow on the back of the head was enough to kill the biggest and fiercest  of them, let alone a kitten. But he couldn't even find a stick that  would answer his purpose.    \"Well,\" he said, when they had stared at each other a minute or two  longer without coming to any understanding, \"I suppose if you won't turn  out for me, I'll have to turn out for you\"; and he made a careful  circuit at a respectful distance, picked up his line again, and went on  his way.    The winter dragged on very slowly, with many ups and downs, but it was  gone at last. Summer was easier, if only because he was not obliged to  use up any of his vitality in keeping warm. Sometimes, indeed, he was  really too warm for comfort, so he presently changed his coat and put  on a thinner one. People like to talk about the coolness of the deep  woods, but the truth is that there isn't any place much hotter and  stuffier than a dense growth of timber, where the wind never comes, and  where the air is heavy and still. And then there are the windfalls and  the old burnings, where the sun beats fiercely down among the fallen  trees till the blackened soil is hot as a city pavement, and where dead  trunks and half-burned logs lie thrown together in the wildest  confusion--places which are almost impassable for men, and which even  the land-lookers avoid whenever they can, but which a cat will thread as  readily as the locomotive follows the rails. These were the localities  which the Kitten was most fond of frequenting, and here his youth  slipped rapidly away. He was fast becoming an adult lynx.    The summer passed, and half the autumn; the first snow came and went,  and again the Kitten put on his winter coat of gray, with the white  underneath, and the dark trimmings up and down his legs and along his  back. What with his mustachios, and his whiskers, and the tassels on his  ears, he was a very presentable young lynx. It would be many years  before he could hope to be as large and powerful as his father, but,  nevertheless, he was making remarkably good progress. And the time was  at hand when he would need both his good looks "]]]
