In  such a cow, while there is danger of inflammation from the sudden rush  of new milk into a bag already occupied, there is almost always  considerable danger of indurations and tumors in the teats from the  habit of secretion being too long suspended. The emaciated and  over-milked beast, however, must rest a while before she can again  advantageously discharge the duties of a mother.    If the period of pregnancy were of equal length at all times and in all  cows, the one that has been well fed might be milked until within a  fortnight or three weeks of parturition, while a holiday of two months  should be granted to the poorer beast; but as there is much  irregularity about the time of gestation, it may be prudent to take a  month or five Weeks, as the average period.    The process of parturition is necessarily one that is accompanied with a  great deal of febrile excitement; and, therefore, when it nearly  approaches, not only should a little care be taken to lessen the  quantity of food, and to remove that which is of a stimulating action,  but a mild dose of physic, and a bleeding regulated by the condition of  the animal, will be very proper precautionary measures.    A moderately open state of the bowels is necessary at the period of  parturition in the cow. During the whole time of pregnancy her enormous  stomach sufficiently presses upon and confines the womb; and that  pressure may be productive of injurious and fatal consequences, if at  this period the rumen is suffered to be distended by innutritious food,  or the manyplus takes on that hardened state to which it is occasionally  subject. Breeders have been sadly negligent in this respect.    The springing of the udder, or the rapid enlargement of it from the  renewed secretion of milk--the enlargement of the external parts of the  bearing (the former, as has been said by some, in old cows, and the  latter in young ones)--the appearance of a glaring discharge from the  bearing--the evident dropping of the belly, with the appearance of  leanness and narrowness between the shape and the udder--a degree of  uneasiness and fidgetiness--moaning occasionally--accelerated  respiration--all these symptoms will announce that the time of calving  is not far off. The cow should be brought near home, and put in some  quiet, sheltered place. In cold or stormy weather she should be housed.  Her uneasiness will rapidly increase--she will be continually getting up  and lying down--her tail will begin to be elevated and the commencement  of the labor-pains will soon be evident.    In most cases the parturition will be natural and easy, and the less the  cow is disturbed or meddled with, the better. She will do better without  help than with it; but she should be watched, in order to see that no  difficulty occurs which may require aid and attention. In cases of  difficult parturition the aid of a skillful veterinary surgeon may be  required.          [Illustration]    Feeding and Management      No branch of dairy farming can compare in importance with the management  of cows. The highest success will depend upon it, whatever breed be  selected, and whatever amount of care and attention be given to the  points of the animals; for experience will show that very little milk  comes out of the bag, that is not first put into the throat. It is poor  economy, therefore, to attempt to keep too many cows for the amount of  feed one has; for it will generally be found that one good cow well-bred  and well fed will yield as much as two ordinary cows kept in the  ordinary way; while a saving is effected both in labor and room  required, and in the risks on the capital invested. If an argument for  the larger number on poorer feed is urged on the ground of the  additional manure--which is the only basis upon which it can be put--it  is enough to say that it is a very expensive way of making manure. It is  not too strong an assertion, that a proper regard to profit and economy  would require many an American farmer to sell off nearly half of his  cows, and to feed the whole of his hay and roots hitherto used into the  remainder.    An animal, to be fully fed and satisfied, requires a quantity of food in  proportion to its live weight. No feed is complete that does not contain  a sufficient amount of nutritive elements; hay, for example, being more  nutritive than straw, and grains than roots. The food, too, must possess  a bulk sufficient to fill up to a certain degree the organs of digestion  of the stomach; and, to receive the full benefit of its food, the animal  must be wholly satisfied--since, if the stomach is not sufficiently  distended, the food cannot be properly digested, and of course many of  the nutritive principles which it contains cannot be perfectly  assimilated. An animal regularly fed eats till it is satisfied, and no  more than is requisite. A part of the nutritive elements in hay and  other forage plants is needed to keep an animal on its feet--that is, to  keep up its condition--and if the nutrition of its food is insufficient  for this, the weight decreases, and if it is more than sufficient the  weight increases, or else this excess is consumed in the production of  milk or in labor. About one sixtieth of their live weight in hay, or its  equivalent, will keep horned cattle on their feet; but, in order to be  completely nourished, they require about one thirtieth in dry  substances, and four thirtieths in water, or other liquid contained in  their food. The excess of nutritive food over and above what is  necessary to sustain life will go, in milch cows, generally to the  production of milk, or to the growth of the foetus, but not in all  cows to an equal extent; the tendency to the secretion of milk being  much more developed in some than in others.    With regard, however, to the consumption of food in proportion to the  live weight of the animal, it must be taken, in common with all general  principles, with some qualifications. The proportion is probably not  uniform as applied to all breeds indiscriminately, though it may be more  so as applied to animals of the same breed. The idea of some celebrated  stock-raisers has been that the quantity of food required depends much  upon the shape of the barrel; and it is well known that an animal of a  close, compact, well-rounded barrel, will consume less than one of an  opposite make.    The variations in the yield of milch cows are caused more by the  variations in the nutritive elements of their food than by a change of  the form in which it is given. A cow, kept through the winter on mere  straw, will cease to give milk; and, when fed in spring on green forage,  will give a fair quantity of milk. But she owes the cessation and  restoration of the secretion, respectively, to the diminution and  increase of her nourishment, and not at all to the change of form, or of  outward substance in which the nutriment is administered. Let cows  receive through winter nearly as large a proportion of nutritive matter  as is contained in the clover, lucerne, and fresh grass which they eat  in summer, and, no matter in what precise substance or mixture that  matter be contained, they will yield a winter's produce of milk quite as  rich in caseine and butyraceous ingredients as the summer's produce, and  far more ample in quantity than almost any dairyman with old-fashioned  notions would imagine to be possible. The great practical error on this  subject consists, not in giving wrong kinds of food, but in not so  proportioning and preparing it as to render an average ration of it  equally rich in the elements of nutrition, and especially in nitrogenous  elements, as an average ration of the green and succulent food of  summer.    We keep too much stock for the quantity of good and nutritious food  which we have for it; and the consequence is, that cows are, in nine  cases out of ten, poorly wintered, and come out in the spring weakened,  if not, indeed, positively diseased, and a long time is required to  bring them into a condition to yield a generous quantity of milk.    It is a hard struggle for a cow reduced in flesh and in blood to fill up  the wasted system with the food which would otherwise have gone to the  secretion of milk; but, if she is well fed, well housed, well littered,  and well supplied with pure, fresh water, and with roots, or other  _moist_ food, and properly treated to the luxury of a frequent carding,  and constant kindness, she comes out ready to commence the manufacture  of milk under favorable circumstances.    _Keep the cows constantly in good condition_, ought, therefore, to be  the motto of every dairy farmer, posted up over the barn, and on and  over the stalls, and over the milk-room, and repeated to the boys  whenever there is danger of forgetting it. It is the great secret of  success; and the difference between success and failure turns upon it.  Cows in milk require more food in proportion to their size and weight  than either oxen or young cattle.    In order to keep cows in milk well and economically, regularity is next  in importance to a full supply of wholesome and nutritious food. The  animal stomach is a very nice chronometer, and it is of the utmost  importance to observe regular hours in feeding, cleaning, and milking.  This is a point, also, in which very many farmers are at fault--feeding  whenever it happens to be convenient. The cattle are thus kept in a  restless condition, constantly expecting food when the keeper enters the  barn; while, if regular hours are strictly adhered to, they know exactly  when they are to be fed, and they rest quietly till the time arrives. If  one goes into any well-regulated dairy establishment an hour before  feeding, scarcely an animal will rise to its feet; while; if it happens  to be the hour of feeding, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22775"],[0,"Psychotherapy (#15)"],[1,", we might say at first, an idea which has a power in our  mind to suppress the opposite idea. A suggestion is an idea which in  itself is not different from other ideas, but the way in which it takes  possession of the mind reduces the chances of any opposite ideas; it  inhibits them. It is indeed the best result of any successful education,  that the teachings have taken hold of the mind of the young in such a  way that all the opposite tendencies and impulses and wishes do not come  to development. The well-educated person does not need to participate in  a struggle between good and bad motives, for that which has been  impressed upon his mind does not allow the other side to come up at all.  Our life would be crowded with inner conflicts if education had not  secured for us from the start preponderance for the suggestions of our  educators.    The love of family and friends, of our country and our party are in the  same way such suggestions. We may hear arguments for the other side,  arguments which easily convince the man of the other party, but they do  not appeal to us: they are emasculated before they enter our minds; they  have no chance to overcome the resistance because suggestions stand in  their way. No argument will overwhelm the suggestion which religion has  settled in our inner life, and from this strongest suggestion which can  stand against any temptation of life small psychological steps lead down  to the little bits of suggestion with which our daily chance life is  over-flooded. Every advertisement in the newspaper, every display in the  shop-window, every warm intonation in the voice of our neighbor has its  suggestive power, that is, it brings its content in such a way to our  minds that the desire to do the opposite is weakened. We do buy the  object that we do not need, and we do follow the advice which we ought  to have reconsidered. And what would remain of art if it had not this  power of suggestion by which it comes to us and wins the victory over  every opposing idea? We believe the painter and we believe the novelist,  if their technique is good. We do not remember that the inventions of  their genius are contrary to our life experience; we feel sympathy with  the hero and do not care in the least that he has no real life. The  suggestion of art has inhibited in us every contrary idea.    Such daily experience shows us that suggestive power may belong to  different men in different degree. There are lawyers whose arguments and  whose presentation open our mind, it seems, to any suggestion: while  others leave us indifferent; we understand their idea, we follow their  thoughts, and yet we remain accessible to opposite influences. There are  teachers whose authority gives to every word such an impressiveness and  dignity that every opposite thought disappears, while others throw out  words which are forgotten. On the other hand, the readiness to accept  suggestions is evidently also quite different with different  individuals. From the most credulous to the stubborn, we have every  degree of suggestibility, the one impressed by the suggestive power of  any idea which is brought to his mind, the other always inclined to  distrust and to look over to the opposite argument. Such a stubborn mind  is indeed not only without inclination for suggestions, but it may  develop even a negative suggestibility; whatever it receives awakens an  instinctive impulse towards the opposite. Moreover we are all in  different degrees suggestible at different times and under various  conditions. Emotions reenforce our readiness to accept suggestions. Hope  and fear, love and jealousy give to the impression and the idea a power  to overwhelm the opposite idea, which otherwise might have influenced  our deliberation. Fatigue and intoxicants increase suggestibility very  strongly. To look out on a wider perspective, we may add at once that an  artificial increase of suggestibility is all which constitutes the state  of hypnotism.    At first, however, we want to understand the ordinary process of  suggestion in that normal form in which it enters into every hour of our  life and into every relation of our social intercourse. But if we begin  to examine the structure of the process, we can no longer be satisfied  with the vague reference to ideas and their opposites. What does it mean  after all if we speak of opposite ideas? Can we not entertain any ideas  peacefully together in our consciousness? From a logical standpoint,  ideas may contradict each other, but that refers to their meaning. As  mere bits of psychological experience, I may have any ideas together in  my consciousness. I can think summer and winter or day and night or  right and left or black and white or love and hate in one embracing  thought. As mere mental stuff, the one idea does not interfere with the  other. On the other hand, this is evident: I cannot will to turn to the  right and to turn to the left at the same time. There may be a wrangling  between those two impulses, but as soon as my will stands for the one,  the other is really excluded. Any action which I am starting to do thus  crowds out the impulse to the opposed action.    In the sphere of psychological facts, we have here indeed the only  relation between two happenings which necessarily involves an  opposition. We could never understand why one brain cell might not work  together with any other brain cell, but we do understand that nature  must provide for an apparatus by which the impulse to one action makes  the impulse to the opposite action ineffective. There is no action which  has not its definite opposite. The carrying out of any impulse involves  the suppression of the contrary impulse, and the impulse not to do an  action involves the suppression of the impulse to do it. When we spoke  of the relations of mind and brain, we mentioned that such a corelation  of mental centers indeed exists. Physiological experiments have  demonstrated that the activity of those centers which stimulate a  certain action reduce the excitability of those brain parts which awaken  the antagonistic action. As far as the world of actions is concerned,  the mechanism of the process of suggestion thus seems not inaccessible  to a physiological understanding.    Various ideas of movements to be carried out are struggling for control  in the cortex of the brain. That is the normal status which precedes any  decision. The channels of motor discharge are open for both  possibilities; we may turn to the right or to the left. Then the play of  associations begins. A larger and larger circle of ideas surrounds the  idea of the one and of the other goal. Those ideas awaken emotions. On  the one side may call our duty and on the other side our pleasure.  Larger and larger parts of the central content of our consciousness, of  our own personality, become involved; our principles and maxims, our  memories, our hopes and fears, enter into the battle until deeper strata  of the idea of ourselves enter into a firm association with the one  side, reenforcing, perhaps, the idea of the goal at the right. This  opens wide the channels of discharge for the movement to the right and  inhibits thereby the excitability of the center which leads to the  opposite action. The channel of discharge to the movement towards the  left becomes closed, the idea of that movement fades away and becomes  inhibited: we are moving towards the right. The outcome was the product  of our total personality.    But this result would have been different, if from the start the  channels of discharge had not been equally open for both possible  movements, and if thus the relative resistance to the impulse had not  been equal on both sides. If, for instance, we had gone from the given  point frequently to the left, as a result of the habit and training, the  impulse to the left would have found less nervous resistance. The  channels would have become widened by the repetition and the opposite  channels would have been somewhat closed by the lack of use. Or if  instead of such previous habit, we should see at the decisive moment  others turning to the left, the impression would have become the  starting point for a reaction of mere instinctive imitation. While we  might not have followed that imitative impulse at once, yet the channels  would have been widened, the discharge in the direction would have been  prepared by it, the resistance would have been lowered and the chances  for the opposite movement would have been decreased. Those people who  moved to the left gave us by their action the same kind of an impulse  which they would have furnished if they had begged us with words, or if  they had ordered us to follow them with authoritative firmness. In each  of these cases, the influence would have amounted to a suggestion.  Whether we watched the movements of other people or whether their words  made an impression on us, in either case the way became prepared for a  certain line of action and therefore the way for the opposite action  became blocked. The final outcome was thus no longer an entirely free  play of motor ideas, but there was a little inequality in play. The one  had from the start a better chance, the other was from the start  laboring under difficulties. The suggestion of actions is thus nothing  but making use of the antagonistic character in the nervous paths which  start from the motor centers. That all such phrases as the opening and  the closing, the widening and blocking, of channels of discharge are  only metaphors hardly needs special emphasis. Instead of such  comparisons, we ought rather to think of chemical processes which offer  various degrees of resistance to the propagation of the nervous  excitement.    We see from here the direction in which many psychotherapeutic efforts  must lie, efforts which are entirely within the limits of the daily  normal experience, and belong to the medical practice"]]]
