She  will have her breakfast in bed, and she told me she would often go up to  her room in the evening directly after dinner. I thought that very nice  and considerate. She quite understands that we shouldn't like to have a  third person always with us. Don't you think, Edward, that, considering  everything, we ought to say we will have her?'    'Oh, I suppose so,' he groaned. 'As you say, it's a very good offer,  financially, and I am afraid it would be very imprudent to refuse. But I  don't like the notion, I confess.'    'I am so glad you agree with me, dear. Depend upon it, it won't be half  so bad as you think. And putting our own advantage on one side, we shall  really be doing poor aunt a very great kindness. Poor old dear, she  cried bitterly after you were gone; she said she had made up her mind  not to stay any longer in Uncle Robert's house, and she didn't know  where to go, or what would become of her, if we refused to take her in.  She quite broke down.'    'Well, well; we will try it for a year, anyhow. It may be as you say; we  shan't find it quite so bad as it seems now. Shall we go in?'    He stooped for his pipe, which lay as it had fallen, on the grass. He  could not find it, and lit a wax match which showed him the pipe, and  close beside it, under the seat, something that looked like a page torn  from a book. He wondered what it could be, and picked it up.    The gas was lit in the drawing-room, and Mrs. Darnell, who was arranging  some notepaper, wished to write at once to Mrs. Nixon, cordially  accepting her proposal, when she was startled by an exclamation from her  husband.    'What is the matter?' she said, startled by the tone of his voice. 'You  haven't hurt yourself?'    'Look at this,' he replied, handing her a small leaflet; 'I found it  under the garden seat just now.'    Mary glanced with bewilderment at her husband and read as follows:--        THE NEW AND CHOSEN SEED OF ABRAHAM        PROPHECIES TO BE FULFILLED IN THE PRESENT YEAR        1. The Sailing of a Fleet of One hundred and Forty and Four Vessels      for Tarshish and the Isles.        2. Destruction of the Power of the Dog, including all the      instruments of anti-Abrahamic legislation.        3. Return of the Fleet from Tarshish, bearing with it the gold of      Arabia, destined to be the Foundation of the New City of Abraham.        4. The Search for the Bride, and the bestowing of the Seals on the      Seventy and Seven.        5. The Countenance of FATHER to become luminous, but with a greater      glory than the face of Moses.        6. The Pope of Rome to be stoned with stones in the valley called      Berek-Zittor.        7. FATHER to be acknowledged by Three Great Rulers. Two Great Rulers      will deny FATHER, and will immediately perish in the Effluvia of      FATHER'S Indignation.        8. Binding of the Beast with the Little Horn, and all Judges cast      down.        9. Finding of the Bride in the Land of Egypt, which has been      revealed to FATHER as now existing in the western part of London.        10. Bestowal of the New Tongue on the Seventy and Seven, and on the      One Hundred and Forty and Four. FATHER proceeds to the Bridal      Chamber.        11. Destruction of London and rebuilding of the City called No,      which is the New City of Abraham.        12. FATHER united to the Bride, and the present Earth removed to the      Sun for the space of half an hour.    Mrs. Darnell's brow cleared as she read matter which seemed to her  harmless if incoherent. From her husband's voice she had been led to  fear something more tangibly unpleasant than a vague catena of  prophecies.    'Well,' she said, 'what about it?'    'What about it? Don't you see that your aunt dropped it, and that she  must be a raging lunatic?'    'Oh, Edward! don't say that. In the first place, how do you know that  aunt dropped it at all? It might easily have blown over from any of the  other gardens. And, if it were hers, I don't think you should call her a  lunatic. I don't believe, myself, that there are any real prophets now;  but there are many good people who think quite differently. I knew an  old lady once who, I am sure, was very good, and she took in a paper  every week that was full of prophecies and things very like this. Nobody  called her mad, and I have heard father say that she had one of the  sharpest heads for business he had ever come across.'    'Very good; have it as you like. But I believe we shall both be sorry.'    They sat in silence for some time. Alice came in after her 'evening  out,' and they sat on, till Mrs. Darnell said she was tired and wanted  to go to bed.    Her husband kissed her. 'I don't think I will come up just yet,' he  said; 'you go to sleep, dearest. I want to think things over. No, no; I  am not going to change my mind: your aunt shall come, as I said. But  there are one or two things I should like to get settled in my mind.'    He meditated for a long while, pacing up and down the room. Light after  light was extinguished in Edna Road, and the people of the suburb slept  all around him, but still the gas was alight in Darnell's drawing-room,  and he walked softly up and down the floor. He was thinking that about  the life of Mary and himself, which had been so quiet, there seemed to  be gathering on all sides grotesque and fantastic shapes, omens of  confusion and disorder, threats of madness; a strange company from  another world. It was as if into the quiet, sleeping streets of some  little ancient town among the hills there had come from afar the sound  of drum and pipe, snatches of wild song, and there had burst into the  market-place the mad company of the players, strangely bedizened,  dancing a furious measure to their hurrying music, drawing forth the  citizens from their sheltered homes and peaceful lives, and alluring  them to mingle in the significant figures of their dance.    Yet afar and near (for it was hidden in his heart) he beheld the glimmer  of a sure and constant star. Beneath, darkness came on, and mists and  shadows closed about the town. The red, flickering flame of torches was  kindled in the midst of it. The song grew louder, with more insistent,  magical tones, surging and falling in unearthly modulations, the very  speech of incantation; and the drum beat madly, and the pipe shrilled to  a scream, summoning all to issue forth, to leave their peaceful hearths;  for a strange rite was preconized in their midst. The streets that were  wont to be so still, so hushed with the cool and tranquil veils of  darkness, asleep beneath the patronage of the evening star, now danced  with glimmering lanterns, resounded with the cries of those who hurried  forth, drawn as by a magistral spell; and the songs swelled and  triumphed, the reverberant beating of the drum grew louder, and in the  midst of the awakened town the players, fantastically arrayed, performed  their interlude under the red blaze of torches. He knew not whether they  were players, men that would vanish suddenly as they came, disappearing  by the track that climbed the hill; or whether they were indeed  magicians, workers of great and efficacious spells, who knew the secret  word by which the earth may be transformed into the hall of Gehenna, so  that they that gazed and listened, as at a passing spectacle, should be  entrapped by the sound and the sight presented to them, should be drawn  into the elaborated figures of that mystic dance, and so should be  whirled away into those unending mazes on the wild hills that were  abhorred, there to wander for evermore.    But Darnell was not afraid, because of the Daystar that had risen in his  heart. It had dwelt there all his life, and had slowly shone forth with  clearer and clearer light, and he began to see that though his earthly  steps might be in the ways of the ancient town that was beset by the  Enchanters, and resounded with their songs and their processions, yet he  dwelt also in that serene and secure world of brightness, and from a  great and unutterable height looked on the confusion of the mortal  pageant, beholding mysteries in which he was no true actor, hearing  magic songs that could by no means draw him down from the battlements of  the high and holy city.    His heart was filled with a great joy and a great peace as he lay down  beside his wife and fell asleep, and in the morning, when he woke up, he  was glad.      IV    In a haze as of a dream Darnell's thoughts seemed to move through the  opening days of the next week. Perhaps nature had not intended that he  should be practical or much given to that which is usually called 'sound  common sense,' but his training had made him desirous of good, plain  qualities of the mind, and he uneasily strove to account to himself for  his strange mood of the Sunday night, as he had often endeavoured to  interpret the fancies of his boyhood and early manhood. At first he was  annoyed by his want of success; the morning paper, which he always  secured as the 'bus delayed at Uxbridge Road Station, fell from his  hands unread, while he vainly reasoned, assuring himself that the  threatened incursion of a whimsical old woman, though tiresome enough,  was no rational excuse for those curious hours of meditation in which  his thoughts seemed to have dressed themselves in unfamiliar, fantastic  habits, and to parley with him in a strange speech, and yet a speech  that he had understood.    With such arguments he perplexed his mind on the long, accustomed ride  up the steep ascent of Holland Park, past the incongruous hustle of  Notting Hill Gate, where in one direction a road shows the way to the  snug, somewhat faded bowers and retreats of Bayswater, and in another  one sees the portal of the murky region of the slums. The customary  companions of his morning's journey were in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2503"],[0,"Myths and Legends of California and the Old Southwest (#15)"],[1,"four gods stood one on each side of him, each with a rattle. They  traced with their rattles in the sand the figure of a man, drawing lines  at his head and feet. Then the youth recovered and the gods again became  sheep. They said, \"Why did you try to shoot us? You see you are one of  us.\" For the youth had become a sheep.    The gods said, \"There is to be a dance, far off to the north beyond the  Ute Mountain. We want you to go with us. We will dress you like  ourselves and teach you to dance. Then we will wander over the world.\"    Now the brothers watched from the top of the mesa but they could not see  what the trouble was. They saw the youth lying on the ground, but when  they reached the place, all the sheep were gone. They began crying,  saying, \"For a long time we would not believe him, and now he has gone  off with the sheep.\"    They tried to head off the sheep, but failed. They said, \"If we had  believed him, he would not have gone off with the sheep. But perhaps  some day we will see him again.\"    At the dance, the five sheep found seven others. This made their number  twelve. They journeyed all around the world. All people let them see  their dances and learn their songs. Then the eleven talked together and  said,    \"There is no use keeping this youth with us longer. He has learned  everything. He may as well go back to his people and teach them to do as  we do.\"    So the youth was taught to have twelve in the dance, six gods and six  goddesses, with Hasjelti to lead them. He was told to have his people  make masks to represent the gods.    So the youth returned to his brothers, carrying with him all songs, all  medicines, and clothing.          Origin of Clear Lake  Patwin (Sacramento Valley, Cal.)    Before anything was created at all, Old Frog and Old Badger lived alone  together. Old Badger wanted to drink, so Old Frog gnawed into a tree,  drew out all the sap and put it in a hollow place. Then he created  Little Frogs to help him, and working together they dug out the lake.    Then Old Frog made the little flat whitefish. Some of them lived in the  lake, but others swam down Cache Creek, and turned into the salmon,  pike, and sturgeon which swim in the Sacramento.          The Great Fire  Patwin (Sacramento Valley, Cal.)    Long ago a man loved two women and wished to marry both of them. But the  women were magpies and they laughed at him. Therefore the man went to  the north, and made for himself a tule boat. Then he set the world on  fire, and himself escaped to sea in his boat.    But the fire burned with terrible speed. It ate its way into the south.  It licked up all things on earth, men, trees, rocks, animals, water, and  even the ground itself.    Now Old Coyote saw the burning and the smoke from his place far in the  south, and he ran with all his might to put it out. He put two little  boys in a sack and ran north like the wind. He took honey-dew into his  mouth, chewed it up, spat on the fire, and so put it out. Now the fire  was out, but there was no water and Coyote was thirsty. So he took  Indian sugar again, chewed it up, dug a hole in the bottom of the creek,  covered up the sugar in it, and it turned to water and filled the creek.  So the earth had water again.    But the two little boys cried because they were lonesome, for there was  nobody left on earth. Then Coyote made a sweat house, and split a number  of sticks, and laid them in the sweat house over night. In the morning  they had all turned into men and women.          Origin of the Raven and the Macaw  (Totems of summer and winter)  Zuni (New Mexico)    The priest who was named Yanauluha carried ever in his hand a staff  which now in the daylight was plumed and covered with feathers--yellow,  blue-green, red, white, black, and varied. Attached to it were shells,  which made a song-like tinkle. The people when they saw it stretched out  their hands and asked many questions.    Then the priest balanced it in his hand, and struck with it a hard  place, and blew upon it. Amid the plumes appeared four round things-mere  eggs they were. Two were blue like the sky and two dun-red like the  flesh of the Earth-mother.    Then the people asked many questions.    \"These,\" said the priests, \"are the seed of living beings. Choose which  ye will follow. From two eggs shall come beings of beautiful plumage,  colored like the grass and fruits of summer. Where they fly and ye  follow, shall always be summer. Without toil, fields of food shall  flourish. And from the other two eggs shall come evil beings, piebald,  with white, without colors. And where these two shall fly and ye shall  follow, winter strives with summer. Only by labor shall the fields yield  fruit, and your children and theirs shall strive for the fruits. Which  do ye choose?\"    \"The blue! The blue!\" cried the people, and those who were strongest  carried off the blue eggs, leaving the red eggs to those who waited.  They laid the blue eggs with much gentleness in soft sand on the sunny  side of a hill, watching day by day. They were precious of color; surely  they would be the precious birds of the Summer-land. Then the eggs  cracked and the birds came out, with open eyes and pin feathers under  their skins.    \"We chose wisely,\" said the people. \"Yellow and blue, red and green, are  their dresses, even seen through their skins.\" So they fed them freely  of all the foods which men favor. Thus they taught them to eat all  desirable food. But when the feathers appeared, they were black with  white bandings. They were ravens. And they flew away croaking hoarse  laughs and mocking our fathers.    But the other eggs became beautiful macaws, and were wafted by a toss of  the priest's wand to the faraway Summer-land.    So those who had chosen the raven, became the Raven People. They were  the Winter People and they were many and strong. But those who had  chosen the macaw, became the Macaw People. They were the Summer People,  and few in number, and less strong, but they were wiser because they  were more deliberate. The priest Yanauluha, being wise, became their  father, even as the Sun-father is among the little moons of the sky. He  and his sisters were the ancestors of the priest-keepers of things.          Coyote and the Hare  Sia (New Mexico)    One day Coyote was passing about when he saw Hare sitting before his  house. Coyote thought, \"In a minute I will catch you,\" and he sprang and  caught Hare.    Hare cried, \"Man Coyote, do not eat me. Wait just a minute; I have  something to tell you--something you will be glad to hear--something  you must hear.\"    \"Well,\" said Coyote, \"I will wait.\"    \"Let me sit at the entrance of my house,\" said Hare. \"Then I can talk to  you.\"    Coyote allowed Hare to take his seat at the entrance.    Hare said, What are you thinking of, Coyote?    \"Nothing,\" said Coyote.    \"Listen, then,\" said Hare. \"I am a hare and I am very much afraid of  people. When they come carrying arrows, I am afraid of them. When they  see me they aim their arrows at me and I am afraid, and oh! how I  tremble!\"    Hare began trembling violently until he saw Coyote a little off his  guard, then he began to run. It took Coyote a minute to think and then  he ran after Hare, but always a little behind. Hare raced away and soon  entered a house, just in time to escape Coyote. Coyote tried to enter  the house but found it was hard stone. He became very angry.    Coyote cried, \"I was very stupid! Why did I allow this Hare to fool me?  I must have him. But this house is so strong, how can I open it?\"    Coyote began to work, but after a while he said to himself, \"The stone  is so strong I cannot open it.\"    Presently Hare called, \"Man Coyote, how are you going to kill me?\"    \"I know how,\" said Coyote. \"I will kill you with fire.\"    \"Where is the wood?\" asked Hare, for he knew there was no wood at his  house.    \"I will bring grass,\" said Coyote, \"and set fire to it. The fire will  enter your house and kill you.\"    \"Oh,\" said Hare, \"but the grass is mine. It is my food; it will not kill  me. It is my friend. The grass will not kill me.\"    \"Then,\" said Coyote, \"I will bring all the trees of the wood and set  fire to them.\"    \"All the trees know me,\" said Hare. \"They are my friends. They will not  kill me. They are my food.\" Coyote thought a minute. Then he said, \"I  will bring the gum of the pinon and set fire to that.\"    Hare said, \"Now I am afraid. I do not eat that. It is not my friend.\"    Coyote rejoiced that he had thought of a plan for getting the hare. He  hurried and brought all the gum he could carry and placed it at the door  of Hare's house and set fire to it. In a short time the gum boiled like  hot grease, and Hare cried,    \"Now I know I shall die! What shall I do?\" Yet all the time he knew what  he would do.    But Coyote was glad Hare was afraid. After a while Hare called, \"The  fire is entering my house,\" and Coyote answered, \"'Blow it out!\"    But Coyote drew nearer and blew with all his might to blow the flame  into Hare's house    Hare cried, \"You are so close you are blowing the fire on me and I will  soon be burned.\"    Coyote was so happy that he drew closer and blew harder, and drew still  closer so that his face was very close to Hare's face. Then Hare  suddenly threw the boiling gum into Coyote's face and escaped from his  house.    It took Coyote a long time to remove the gum from his face, and he felt  very sorrowful. He said, \"I am very, very stupid.\"          Coyote and the Quails  Pima (Arizona)    Once upon a time, long ago, Coyote was sleeping so soundly that a covey  of quails came along and cut pieces of fat meat out of his flesh without  arousing him. Then they went on. After they had camped for the  evening, and were cooking the meat, Coyote came up the trail.    Coyote said, \"Where did you get that nice, fat meat? Give me some.\"    Quails gave him all he wanted. Then he went farther up the trail. After  he had gone"]]]
