He would hardly reply to my questions, and busied  himself all evening in an abstruse chemical analysis which involved  much heating of retorts and distilling of vapors, ending at last in a  smell which fairly drove me out of the apartment. Up to the small hours  of the morning I could hear the clinking of his test-tubes which told  me that he was still engaged in his malodorous experiment.    In the early dawn I woke with a start, and was surprised to find him  standing by my bedside, clad in a rude sailor dress with a pea-jacket,  and a coarse red scarf round his neck.    \"I am off down the river, Watson,\" said he.  \"I have been turning it  over in my mind, and I can see only one way out of it.  It is worth  trying, at all events.\"    \"Surely I can come with you, then?\" said I.    \"No; you can be much more useful if you will remain here as my  representative.  I am loath to go, for it is quite on the cards that  some message may come during the day, though Wiggins was despondent  about it last night. I want you to open all notes and telegrams, and to  act on your own judgment if any news should come.  Can I rely upon you?\"    \"Most certainly.\"    \"I am afraid that you will not be able to wire to me, for I can hardly  tell yet where I may find myself.  If I am in luck, however, I may not  be gone so very long.  I shall have news of some sort or other before I  get back.\"    I had heard nothing of him by breakfast-time.  On opening the Standard,  however, I found that there was a fresh allusion to the business.  \"With reference to the Upper Norwood tragedy,\" it remarked, \"we have  reason to believe that the matter promises to be even more complex and  mysterious than was originally supposed. Fresh evidence has shown that  it is quite impossible that Mr. Thaddeus Sholto could have been in any  way concerned in the matter.  He and the housekeeper, Mrs. Bernstone,  were both released yesterday evening.  It is believed, however, that  the police have a clue as to the real culprits, and that it is being  prosecuted by Mr. Athelney Jones, of Scotland Yard, with all his  well-known energy and sagacity.  Further arrests may be expected at any  moment.\"    \"That is satisfactory so far as it goes,\" thought I.  \"Friend Sholto is  safe, at any rate.  I wonder what the fresh clue may be; though it  seems to be a stereotyped form whenever the police have made a blunder.\"    I tossed the paper down upon the table, but at that moment my eye  caught an advertisement in the agony column.  It ran in this way:    \"Lost.--Whereas Mordecai Smith, boatman, and his son, Jim, left Smith's  Wharf at or about three o'clock last Tuesday morning in the steam  launch Aurora, black with two red stripes, funnel black with a white  band, the sum of five pounds will be paid to any one who can give  information to Mrs. Smith, at Smith's Wharf, or at 221b Baker Street,  as to the whereabouts of the said Mordecai Smith and the launch Aurora.\"    This was clearly Holmes's doing.  The Baker Street address was enough  to prove that.  It struck me as rather ingenious, because it might be  read by the fugitives without their seeing in it more than the natural  anxiety of a wife for her missing husband.    It was a long day.  Every time that a knock came to the door, or a  sharp step passed in the street, I imagined that it was either Holmes  returning or an answer to his advertisement.  I tried to read, but my  thoughts would wander off to our strange quest and to the ill-assorted  and villainous pair whom we were pursuing. Could there be, I wondered,  some radical flaw in my companion's reasoning.  Might he be suffering  from some huge self-deception? Was it not possible that his nimble and  speculative mind had built up this wild theory upon faulty premises?  I  had never known him to be wrong; and yet the keenest reasoner may  occasionally be deceived.  He was likely, I thought, to fall into error  through the over-refinement of his logic,--his preference for a subtle  and bizarre explanation when a plainer and more commonplace one lay  ready to his hand.  Yet, on the other hand, I had myself seen the  evidence, and I had heard the reasons for his deductions.  When I  looked back on the long chain of curious circumstances, many of them  trivial in themselves, but all tending in the same direction, I could  not disguise from myself that even if Holmes's explanation were  incorrect the true theory must be equally outre and startling.    At three o'clock in the afternoon there was a loud peal at the bell, an  authoritative voice in the hall, and, to my surprise, no less a person  than Mr. Athelney Jones was shown up to me.  Very different was he,  however, from the brusque and masterful professor of common sense who  had taken over the case so confidently at Upper Norwood.  His  expression was downcast, and his bearing meek and even apologetic.    \"Good-day, sir; good-day,\" said he.  \"Mr. Sherlock Holmes is out, I  understand.\"    \"Yes, and I cannot be sure when he will be back.  But perhaps you would  care to wait.  Take that chair and try one of these cigars.\"    \"Thank you; I don't mind if I do,\" said he, mopping his face with a red  bandanna handkerchief.    \"And a whiskey-and-soda?\"    \"Well, half a glass.  It is very hot for the time of year; and I have  had a good deal to worry and try me.  You know my theory about this  Norwood case?\"    \"I remember that you expressed one.\"    \"Well, I have been obliged to reconsider it.  I had my net drawn  tightly round Mr. Sholto, sir, when pop he went through a hole in the  middle of it.  He was able to prove an alibi which could not be shaken.  From the time that he left his brother's room he was never out of sight  of some one or other.  So it could not be he who climbed over roofs and  through trap-doors.  It's a very dark case, and my professional credit  is at stake.  I should be very glad of a little assistance.\"    \"We all need help sometimes,\" said I.    \"Your friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes is a wonderful man, sir,\" said he, in  a husky and confidential voice.  \"He's a man who is not to be beat.  I  have known that young man go into a good many cases, but I never saw  the case yet that he could not throw a light upon.  He is irregular in  his methods, and a little quick perhaps in jumping at theories, but, on  the whole, I think he would have made a most promising officer, and I  don't care who knows it.  I have had a wire from him this morning, by  which I understand that he has got some clue to this Sholto business.  Here is the message.\"    He took the telegram out of his pocket, and handed it to me.  It was  dated from Poplar at twelve o'clock.  \"Go to Baker Street at once,\" it  said.  \"If I have not returned, wait for me.  I am close on the track  of the Sholto gang.  You can come with us to-night if you want to be in  at the finish.\"    \"This sounds well.  He has evidently picked up the scent again,\" said I.    \"Ah, then he has been at fault too,\" exclaimed Jones, with evident  satisfaction.  \"Even the best of us are thrown off sometimes.  Of  course this may prove to be a false alarm; but it is my duty as an  officer of the law to allow no chance to slip. But there is some one at  the door.  Perhaps this is he.\"    A heavy step was heard ascending the stair, with a great wheezing and  rattling as from a man who was sorely put to it for breath. Once or  twice he stopped, as though the climb were too much for him, but at  last he made his way to our door and entered.  His appearance  corresponded to the sounds which we had heard.  He was an aged man,  clad in seafaring garb, with an old pea-jacket buttoned up to his  throat.  His back was bowed, his knees were shaky, and his breathing  was painfully asthmatic.  As he leaned upon a thick oaken cudgel his  shoulders heaved in the effort to draw the air into his lungs.  He had  a colored scarf round his chin, and I could see little of his face save  a pair of keen dark eyes, overhung by bushy white brows, and long gray  side-whiskers. Altogether he gave me the impression of a respectable  master mariner who had fallen into years and poverty.    \"What is it, my man?\" I asked.    He looked about him in the slow methodical fashion of old age.    \"Is Mr. Sherlock Holmes here?\" said he.    \"No; but I am acting for him.  You can tell me any message you have for  him.\"    \"It was to him himself I was to tell it,\" said he.    \"But I tell you that I am acting for him.  Was it about Mordecai  Smith's boat?\"    \"Yes.  I knows well where it is.  An' I knows where the men he is after  are.  An' I knows where the treasure is.  I knows all about it.\"    \"Then tell me, and I shall let him know.\"    \"It was to him I was to tell it,\" he repeated, with the petulant  obstinacy of a very old man.    \"Well, you must wait for him.\"    \"No, no; I ain't goin' to lose a whole day to please no one.  If Mr.  Holmes ain't here, then Mr. Holmes must find it all out for himself.  I  don't care about the look of either of you, and I won't tell a word.\"    He shuffled towards the door, but Athelney Jones got in front of him.    \"Wait a bit, my friend,\" said he.  \"You have important information, and  you must not walk off.  We shall keep you, whether you like or not,  until our friend returns.\"    The old man made a little run towards the door, but, as Athelney Jones  put his broad back up against it, he recognized the uselessness of  resistance.    \"Pretty sort o' treatment this!\" he cried, stamping his stick. \"I come  here to see a gentleman, and you two, who I never saw in my life, seize  me and treat me in this fashion!\"    \"You will be none the worse,\" I said.  \"We shall recompense you for the  loss of your time.  Sit over here on the sofa, and you will not have  long to wait.\"    He came across sullenly enough, and seated himself with his face  resting on his hands."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20987"],[0,"Story of the War in South Africa, 1899-1900 (#15)"],[1,"pounds; but within forty-eight hours a battery and a  half--nine guns--had arrived from England, to be followed by another  half battery from the Orange River.\"[11]                       [Footnote 11: Ralph's \"Toward Pretoria,\" p. 97.]    The position of De Aar indicated it absolutely as a point which the  British must hold, fortify, and use as a depot and base. Camps and  buildings began to be laid out and put up about October 25, and stores  to accumulate; ten days later came the batteries and also  reinforcements; but these--400 in number--imperatively demanded by the  superior importance and exposure of De Aar, which required  concentration upon it, were obtained by evacuating Colesberg and  Naauwport, the latter a most regrettable necessity. But what were the  Boers doing while these fragments were drawing together into a single  body, while batteries were arriving, and works, not yet existent, were  being thrown up? They were besieging Kimberley and Mafeking, 150  {p.126} and 300 miles away, and pottering about just within Cape  Colony, occupying undefended towns and making proclamations of  annexation. \"Fancy,\" says the writer just quoted,--\"fancy the Orange  River sixty miles away, with 2,500 men (British) holding the  (railroad) bridge over it, and a battalion of 1,000 men broken into  five bodies of troops isolated at as many points--all, excepting the  force at Orange River, inviting certain destruction.\"[12]                       [Footnote 12: Ralph's \"Toward Pretoria,\" p. 104.]    The concentration ordered by Buller, just mentioned, drew the British,  on the left flank of their line in Cape Colony, into two principal  bodies--2,500 at Orange River Station, where the railroad to Kimberley  crosses the river, and some 1,500 at De Aar. Stormberg Junction on the  right of the line was evacuated at the same time as Naauwport, the  troops falling back upon Queenstown, fifty miles distant by rail. This  abandonment of the two junctions severed from each other the right and  left flanks of the general front, which extended from Stormberg to De  Aar, depriving them of mutual support; a condition of disadvantage  {p.127} that was not wholly removed until after the occupation of  Bloemfontein. This gain to the Boers, however, was due to no  well-combined active operations on their side, but to the mere fact  that their opponents were everywhere so hopelessly weaker in numbers  that it was insanity any longer to risk these small detachments in  places where they ought to have been captured days before.    From these withdrawals it resulted that the British movements in  either quarter were of no assistance to those in the other by direct  co-operation, but only by diversion--by occupying in front of either  flank a certain proportion of the enemy. The latter attempted no  serious movement of attack, but simply waited. Their plan, alike in  the strategy of the campaign and in the tactics of the battlefield,  was to abide attack, with the advantages, usual to the defensive, of a  carefully chosen position diligently improved. So placed and secured,  they hoped to repel and to hold fast; but at the worst to inflict loss  greater than they received and then to slip away successfully,  avoiding capture, to another similar position in the rear of the  first, {p.128} there to repeat again the same tactic. For such  retreat provision of horse mounts was always carefully made, and to  its success their superiority in horseflesh, their habit of isolated  movement, their knowledge of the country, and the friendliness of the  inhabitants, greatly contributed. The student of naval history will  easily recognise in these methods an analogy to the battle tactics  plausibly ascribed to the French by Clerk in his celebrated treatise.  It was often successful on the ground, but it did not win campaigns.  The mastery of the sea remained with the British, whose blindly  headlong attacks with their ships resembled in much the free and often  foolish exposure of their troops in the beginning of the present war.  Nevertheless, the temper is one which wins, nor is there any necessary  incompatibility between a vigorous initiative and reasonable caution.    There is much to be said for such a plan as suited to the force  numerically inferior, and especially when, as with the Boers, it is  composed of men untutored in the military formations and manoeuvres  essential to successful movement in battle. Defence of the character  {p.129} indicated requires little change after the primary  dispositions have been made; the men for the most part stand fast when  placed, and do not incur the risk of confusion from which the  well-practised only can extricate themselves.    The mistake of the Boers was in failing to recognise that a nation  compelled to such a mode of action by its conditions of inferiority,  in numbers and in drill, is doomed to ultimate defeat, unless at the  very beginning, while the enemy has not yet developed or concentrated  his powers, such an advantage is gained by a vigorous initiative as  shall either prevent his obtaining the necessary initial positions, or  shall at least postpone his doing so long enough to affect materially  the course of the war, and give room for the chapter of accidents--for  the intervention of the unforeseen. The Boers, having surprised their  enemy at unawares, had the opportunity so to act. It may be that, had  they done so, ultimate success would not certainly have followed--the  odds were very great; but it is safe to say that only so, by rushing  the campaign at the beginning, had they any chance of final {p.130}  victory. \"Desperate conditions,\" said Nelson, \"require desperate  remedies.\" The Boers' position was desperate from the first, to be  saved only by the most vigorous handling of numbers which for a brief  and critical period were largely superior.    Thus it was that these opening weeks decided the character and issue  of the war, beyond chance of subsequent reversal. By the Boers' own  choice, interest was fixed not upon one or two, but upon several  quarters, and these--save Ladysmith--determined not by their inherent,  and therefore lasting and decisive, strategic importance, but by  questions of commercial value and of the somewhat accidental presence  in them of very small bodies of regular troops. At two places,  Mafeking and Kimberley, the assailants were, as an English journal  justly put it, \"foiled by colonial forces hastily organised, and  stiffened by small regular detachments which have shown far more  enterprise on the offensive than their besiegers have done.\"    Such a situation, under the existing conditions of the general  campaign, should have been met, not by protracted investment in  force, {p.131} but by assault; or, if that were inexpedient, a  sufficient detachment should have been left to hold the garrison in  check, while considerations of more decisive military importance  elsewhere received concentrated attention.    Immediately after the arrival of Sir Redvers Buller he found the  investment of the three garrisons--Ladysmith, Kimberley, and  Mafeking--already accomplished. The question before him was  complicated by the introduction of these new factors. As has before  been said, it is generally understood that the expectation of the  British authorities had been to proceed at once to an invasion of the  Orange Free State, presumably by the line to Bloemfontein, with  flanking movements on either side of it, while the forces in Natal  were to stand simply on the defensive, until, by the advance of the  army of invasion within supporting distance, the time for co-operation  with it should arrive. In Natal, now, the tables were turned, the  defence had broken down, and the army charged with it was shut up by a  force so far superior as to enable it, not only to carry on the siege,  but {p.132} to make at least serious inroads upon the colony, if not  to advance permanently to positions of more extensive control, to  dislodge it from which greater effort would be needed. The question  now to be decided was whether relief would be best effected by  adhering to the original plan of moving in force upon Bloemfontein,  leaving Ladysmith to look out for itself, and only strengthening the  forces in Natal outside of the place sufficiently to check any further  advance of the enemy; or whether to attempt speedier succour by a  direct advance along the roads leading to one or both of the besieged  places.    The first, if successfully carried out, would eventually take in the  rear the assailants both of Kimberley and Ladysmith, threatening them  with the severance of their communications--concerning which the Boers  are exceptionally sensitive--and thus would raise the siege by  compelling the retreat of the besiegers. This plan, moreover, would be  faithful to general military principle, by keeping the great mass of  the British Army concentrated upon a single object, and under a single  hand.    The {p.133} alternative possessed the drawback of dividing the army  into two bodies virtually independent in their several movements, out  of mutual supporting distance, and each distinctly weaker than the  single mass intended for the great central operation of the former  plan. The second also laboured under the other disadvantages that a  direct advance naturally has as compared to a turning movement. The  enemy would be met always in front--thus covering his communications  and with retreat open--in positions assumed tactically with a view to  prevent flank attacks and to compel assault in front, the most  dangerous to make.    In choosing their ground for their objects, the Boers have shown  remarkable aptitude. If overpowered and dislodged, unless routed and  dispersed, the defender falls back continually upon the bases in his  rear, recuperating his losses by reinforcements from them, while the  victorious assailant must either press on with"]]]
