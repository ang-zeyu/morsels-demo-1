Think of getting up  in the morning and picking out your shoes and stockings from among  seventeen pairs of them!    Imagine yourself a child, gentle reader, in a family where you would be  called upon every morning to select your own cud of spruce gum from a  collection of seventeen similar cuds stuck on a window-sill! And yet  Benjamin Franklin never murmured or repined. He desired to go to sea,  and to avoid this he was apprenticed to his brother James, who was a  printer.    It is said that Franklin at once took hold of the great Archimedean  lever, and jerked it early and late in the interests of freedom.    [Illustration: THE PRINTER'S TOWEL.]    It is claimed that Franklin, at this time, invented the deadly weapon  known as the printer's towel. He found that a common crash towel could  be saturated with glue, molasses, antimony, concentrated lye, and  roller-composition, and that after a few years of time and perspiration  it would harden so that \"A Constant Reader\" or \"Veritas\" could be  stabbed with it and die soon.    Many believe that Franklin's other scientific experiments were  productive of more lasting benefit to mankind than this, but I do not  agree with them.    His paper was called the _New England Courant_. It was edited jointly by  James and Benjamin Franklin, and was started to supply a long-felt want.    Benjamin edited it a part of the time, and James a part of the time. The  idea of having two editors was not for the purpose of giving volume to  the editorial page, but it was necessary for one to run the paper while  the other was in jail.    In those days you could not sass the king, and then, when the king came  in the office the next day and stopped his paper and took out his ad.,  put it off on \"our informant\" and go right along with the paper. You had  to go to jail, while your subscribers wondered why their paper did not  come, and the paste soured in the tin dippers in the sanctum, and the  circus passed by on the other side.    How many of us to-day, fellow-journalists, would be willing to stay in  jail while the lawn festival and the kangaroo came and went? Who of all  our company would go to a prison-cell for the cause of freedom while a  double-column ad. of sixteen aggregated circuses, and eleven congresses  of ferocious beasts, fierce and fragrant from their native lair, went by  us?    At the age of seventeen Ben got disgusted with his brother, and went to  Philadelphia and New York, where he got a chance to \"sub\" for a few  weeks and then got a regular \"sit.\"    Franklin was a good printer, and finally got to be a foreman. He made an  excellent foreman, sitting by the hour in the composing-room and  spitting on the stove, while he cussed the make-up and press-work of the  other papers. Then he would go into the editorial rooms and scare the  editors to death with a wild shriek for more copy.    He knew just how to conduct himself as a foreman so that strangers would  think he owned the paper.    [Illustration: FRANKLIN AS FOREMAN.]    In 1730, at the age of twenty-four, Franklin married, and established  the _Pennsylvania Gazette_. He was then regarded as a great man, and  almost every one took his paper.    Franklin grew to be a great journalist, and spelled hard words with  great fluency. He never tried to be a humorist in any of his newspaper  work, and everybody respected him.    Along about 1746 he began to study the habits and construction of  lightning, and inserted a local in his paper in which he said that he  would be obliged to any of his readers who might notice any new or odd  specimens of lightning, if they would send them in to the _Gazette_  office for examination.    Every time there was a thunderstorm Franklin would tell the foreman to  edit the paper, and, armed with a string and an old door-key, he would  go out on the hills and get enough lightning for a mess.    [Illustration: FRANKLIN EXPERIMENTING WITH LIGHTNING.]    [Illustration: FRANKLIN VISITING GEORGE III.]    In 1753 Franklin was made postmaster of the Colonies. He made a good  Postmaster-General, and people say there were fewer mistakes in  distributing their mail then than there have ever been since. If a man  mailed a letter in those days, old Ben Franklin saw that it went to  where it was addressed.    Franklin frequently went over to England in those days, partly on  business and partly to shock the king. He liked to go to the castle with  his breeches tucked in his boots, figuratively speaking, and attract a  great deal of attention.    It looked odd to the English, of course, to see him come into the royal  presence, and, leaning his wet umbrella up against the throne, ask the  king, \"How's trade?\"    Franklin never put on any frills, but he was not afraid of a crowned  head. He used to say, frequently, that a king to him was no more than a  seven-spot.    He did his best to prevent the Revolutionary War, but he couldn't do it.  Patrick Henry had said that the war was inevitable, and had given it  permission to come, and it came.    He also went to Paris, and got acquainted with a few crowned heads  there. They thought a good deal of him in Paris, and offered him a  corner lot if he would build there and start a paper. They also promised  him the county printing; but he said, No, he would have to go back to  America or his wife might get uneasy about him. Franklin wrote \"Poor  Richard's Almanac\" in 1732 to 1757, and it was republished in England.    Franklin little thought, when he went to the throne-room in his leather  riding-clothes and hung his hat on the throne, that he was inaugurating  a custom of wearing groom clothes which would in these days be so  popular among the English.    Dr. Franklin entered Philadelphia eating a loaf of bread and carrying a  loaf under each arm, passing beneath the window of the girl to whom he  afterwards gave his hand in marriage.    [Illustration: FRANKLIN ENTERING PHILADELPHIA.]    Nearly everybody in America, except Dr. Mary Walker, was once a poor  boy.          CHAPTER XVI.    THE CRITICAL PERIOD.      Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold on the 10th of May led two small  companies to Ticonderoga, a strong fortress tremendously fortified, and  with its name also across the front door. Ethan Allen, a brave Vermonter  born in Connecticut, entered the sally-port, and was shot at by a guard  whose musket failed to report. Allen entered and demanded the surrender  of the fortress.    \"By whose authority?\" asked the commandant.    \"By the authority of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress,\"  said Allen, brandishing his naked sword at a great rate.    \"Very well,\" said the officer: \"if you put it on those grounds, all  right, if you will excuse the appearance of things. We were just  cleaning up, and everything is by the heels here.\"    \"Never mind,\" said Allen, who was the soul of politeness. \"We put on no  frills at home, and so we are ready to take things as we find them.\"    The Americans therefore got a large amount of munitions of war, both  here and at Crown Point.    General Washington was now appointed commander-in-chief of all the  troops at the second session of the Continental Congress. On his arrival  at Boston there were only fourteen thousand men. He took command under  the historic elm at Cambridge. He was dressed in a blue broadcloth coat  with flaps and revers of same, trimmed with large beautiful buttons. He  also wore buff small-clothes, with openings at the sides where pockets  are now put in, but at that time given up to space. They were made in  such a way as to prevent the naked eye from discovering at once whether  he was in advance or retreat. He also wore silk stockings and a cocked  hat.    The lines of Dryden starting off \"Mark his majestic fabric\" were  suggested by his appearance and general style. He always dressed well  and rode a good horse, but at Valley Forge frosted his feet severely,  and could have drawn a pension, \"but no,\" said he, \"I can still work at  light employment, like being President, and so I will not ask for a  pension.\"    Each soldier had less than nine cartridges, but Washington managed to  keep General Gage penned up in Boston, and, as Gage knew very few people  there, it was a dull winter for him.    The boys of Boston had built snow hills on the Common, and used to slide  down them to the ice below, but the British soldiers tore down their  coasting-places and broke up the ice on the pond.    They stood it a long time, rebuilding their playground as often as it  was torn down, until the spirit of American freedom could endure it no  longer. They then organized a committee consisting of eight boys who  were noted for their great philosophical research, and with Charles  Sumner Muzzy, the eloquent savant from Milk Street, as chairman, the  committee started for General Gage's head-quarters, to confer with him  regarding the matter.    [Illustration: INTELLECTUAL TRIUMPH OF THE YOUTH OF BOSTON OVER GENERAL  GAGE.]    In the picture Mr. Muzzy is seen addressing General Gage. The boy in the  centre with the colored glasses is Marco Bozzaris Cobb, who discovered  and first brought into use the idea of putting New Orleans molasses into  Boston brown bread. To the left of Mr. Cobb is Mr. Jehoab Nye, who  afterwards became the Rev. Jehoab Nye and worked with heart and voice  for over eight of the best years of his life against the immorality of  the codfish-ball, before he learned of its true relations towards  society.

You excite me no less.  Is there another King of the Jews?\"    The Egyptian did not blanch.    \"There is one newly born.\"    An expression of pain knit the dark face of the monarch, as if  his mind were swept by a harrowing recollection.    \"Not to me, not to me!\" he exclaimed.    Possibly the accusing images of his murdered children flitted  before him; recovering from the emotion, whatever it was,  he asked, steadily, \"Where is the new king?\"    \"That, O king, is what we would ask.\"    \"You bring me a wonder--a riddle surpassing any of Solomon's,\"  the inquisitor said next. \"As you see, I am in the time of life when  curiosity is as ungovernable as it was in childhood, when to trifle  with it is cruelty. Tell me further, and I will honor you as kings  honor each other. Give me all you know about the newly born, and I  will join you in the search for him; and when we have found him,  I will do what you wish; I will bring him to Jerusalem, and train  him in kingcraft; I will use my grace with Caesar for his promotion  and glory. Jealousy shall not come between us, so I swear. But tell  me first how, so widely separated by seas and deserts, you all came  to hear of him.\"    \"I will tell you truly, O king.\"    \"Speak on,\" said Herod.    Balthasar raised himself erect, and said, solemnly,    \"There is an Almighty God.\"    Herod was visibly startled.    \"He bade us come hither, promising that we should find the Redeemer  of the World; that we should see and worship him, and bear witness  that he was come; and, as a sign, we were each given to see a star.  His Spirit stayed with us. O king, his Spirit is with us now!\"    An overpowering feeling seized the three. The Greek with difficulty  restrained an outcry. Herod's gaze darted quickly from one to the other;  he was more suspicious and dissatisfied than before.    \"You are mocking me,\" he said. \"If not, tell me more. What is to  follow the coming of the new king?\"    \"The salvation of men.\"    \"From what?\"    \"Their wickedness.\"    \"How?\"    \"By the divine agencies--Faith, Love, and Good Works.\"    \"Then\"--Herod paused, and from his look no man could have said  with what feeling he continued--\"you are the heralds of the Christ.  Is that all?\"    Balthasar bowed low.    \"We are your servants, O king.\"    The monarch touched a bell, and the attendant appeared.    \"Bring the gifts,\" the master said.    The attendant went out, but in a little while returned, and,  kneeling before the guests, gave to each one an outer robe or  mantle of scarlet and blue, and a girdle of gold. They acknowledged  the honors with Eastern prostrations.    \"A word further,\" said Herod, when the ceremony was ended. \"To the  officer of the gate, and but now to me, you spoke of seeing a star  in the east.\"    \"Yes,\" said Balthasar, \"his star, the star of the newly born.\"    \"What time did it appear?\"    \"When we were bidden come hither.\"    Herod arose, signifying the audience was over. Stepping from the  throne towards them, he said, with all graciousness,    \"If, as I believe, O illustrious men, you are indeed the heralds  of the Christ just born, know that I have this night consulted  those wisest in things Jewish, and they say with one voice he  should be born in Bethlehem of Judea. I say to you, go thither;  go and search diligently for the young child; and when you have  found him bring me word again, that I may come and worship him.  To your going there shall be no let or hindrance. Peace be with  you!\"    And, folding his robe about him, he left the chamber.    Directly the guide came, and led them back to the street, and thence  to the khan, at the portal of which the Greek said, impulsively, \"Let us  to Bethlehem, O brethren, as the king has advised.\"    \"Yes,\" cried the Hindoo. \"The Spirit burns within me.\"    \"Be it so,\" said Balthasar, with equal warmth. \"The camels are  ready.\"    They gave gifts to the steward, mounted into their saddles,  received directions to the Joppa Gate, and departed. At their  approach the great valves were unbarred, and they passed out  into the open country, taking the road so lately travelled by  Joseph and Mary. As they came up out of Hinnom, on the plain  of Rephaim, a light appeared, at first wide-spread and faint.  Their pulses fluttered fast. The light intensified rapidly; they  closed their eyes against its burning brilliance: when they dared  look again, lo! the star, perfect as any in the heavens, but low  down and moving slowly before them. And they folded their hands,  and shouted, and rejoiced with exceeding great joy.    \"God is with us! God is with us!\" they repeated, in frequent cheer,  all the way, until the star, rising out of the valley beyond Mar  Elias, stood still over a house up on the slope of the hill near  the town.          CHAPTER XIV      It was now the beginning of the third watch, and at Bethlehem  the morning was breaking over the mountains in the east, but so  feebly that it was yet night in the valley. The watchman on the  roof of the old khan, shivering in the chilly air, was listening  for the first distinguishable sounds with which life, awakening,  greets the dawn, when a light came moving up the hill towards  the house. He thought it a torch in some one's hand; next moment  he thought it a meteor; the brilliance grew, however, until it  became a star. Sore afraid, he cried out, and brought everybody  within the walls to the roof. The phenomenon, in eccentric motion,  continued to approach; the rocks, trees, and roadway under it shone  as in a glare of lightning; directly its brightness became blinding.  The more timid of the beholders fell upon their knees, and prayed,  with their faces hidden; the boldest, covering their eyes, crouched,  and now and then snatched glances fearfully. Afterwhile the khan and  everything thereabout lay under the intolerable radiance. Such as  dared look beheld the star standing still directly over the house  in front of the cave where the Child had been born.    In the height of this scene, the wise men came up, and at the gate  dismounted from their camels, and shouted for admission. When the  steward so far mastered his terror as to give them heed, he drew  the bars and opened to them. The camels looked spectral in the  unnatural light, and, besides their outlandishness, there were  in the faces and manner of the three visitors an eagerness and  exaltation which still further excited the keeper's fears and  fancy; he fell back, and for a time could not answer the question  they put to him.    \"Is not this Bethlehem of Judea?\"    But others came, and by their presence gave him assurance.    \"No, this is but the khan; the town lies farther on.\"    \"Is there not here a child newly born?\"    The bystanders turned to each other marvelling, though some of  them answered, \"Yes, yes.\"    \"Show us to him!\" said the Greek, impatiently.    \"Show us to him!\" cried Balthasar, breaking through his gravity;  \"for we have seen his star, even that which ye behold over the  house, and are come to worship him.\"    The Hindoo clasped his hands, exclaiming, \"God indeed lives! Make  haste, make haste! The Savior is found. Blessed, blessed are we  above men!\"    The people from the roof came down and followed the strangers as  they were taken through the court and out into the enclosure;  at sight of the star yet above the cave, though less candescent  than before, some turned back afraid; the greater part went on.  As the strangers neared the house, the orb arose; when they were  at the door, it was high up overhead vanishing; when they entered,  it went out lost to sight. And to the witnesses of what then took  place came a conviction that there was a divine relation between  the star and the strangers, which extended also to at least some of  the occupants of the cave. When the door was opened, they crowded in.    The apartment was lighted by a lantern enough to enable the strangers  to find the mother, and the child awake in her lap.    \"Is the child thine?\" asked Balthasar of Mary.    And she who had kept all the things in the least affecting the  little one, and pondered them in her heart, held it up in the  light, saying,    \"He is my son!\"    And they fell down and worshipped him.    They saw the child was as other children: about its head was neither  nimbus nor material crown; its lips opened not in speech; if it heard  their expressions of joy, their invocations, their prayers, it made  no sign whatever, but, baby-like, looked longer at the flame in the  lantern than at them.    In a little while they arose, and, returning to the camels,  brought gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh, and laid them  before the child, abating nothing of their worshipful speeches;  of which no part is given, for the thoughtful know that the pure  worship of the pure heart was then what it is now, and has always  been, an inspired song.    And this was the Savior they had come so far to find!    Yet they worshipped without a doubt.    Why?    Their faith rested upon the signs sent them by him whom we have  since come to know as the Father; and they were of the kind to  whom his promises were so all-sufficient that they asked nothing  about his ways. Few there were who had seen the signs and heard the  promises--the Mother and Joseph, the shepherds, and the Three--yet  they all believed alike; that is to say, in this period of the plan  of salvation, God was all and the Child nothing. But look forward,  O reader! A time will come when the signs will all proceed from  the Son. Happy they who then believe in him!    Let us wait that period.
