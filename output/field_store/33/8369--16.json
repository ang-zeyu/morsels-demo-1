In their revolt from the  outworn academic rules, they have gone the length of the most advanced  Cubists, and do not realize that no amount of splendid visualization  compensates for a lack of knowledge of the art of making melodies. It is  unfortunate, too, that the imitators of Amy Lowell, many of whom have  neither her feeling for colour, her great power of concentration, nor  her naturally good ear, should imagine that _vers libre_ means the  throwing together of words in chaos. Even Strauss's \"Electra\" is founded  on carefully considered rules; his discords are not accidents.    It seems to me that the study of Sidney Lanier's \"Science of English  Verse\" would suppress the art of expression, even in a genius. By the  time he learned how to write verse he would be too old to write verse at  all! There are less intricate books. I learned from the theories and the  odes of Coventry Patmore and the \"Observations in the Art of English  Poesy\" of Thomas Campion and his practice that the best _vers libre_ has  freedom, unexpectedness, lyrical lightness, and an apparently unstudied  charm, because the poet had striven, not to sing as a bird sings,  without art, but to sing in a civilized world as a great tenor in the  opera sings, because he had acquired his method of almost perfect  expression through science and art. And, if one wants an example of the  intangible \"something,\" expressed artistically, why not take Benet's  \"Immoral Ballad\"? A little thing, sir; but a poet's own and so,  incapable of being analyzed by any rules known to the pundits. But it is  not _vers libre_. If it were, its intangible appeal would not exist.    Nearly every versifier who disregards those models of form in verse  which include rime, or whose cadences are informal, is set down as an  imitator of Walt Whitman. When I was young, Walt Whitman seemed to have  been established as a strange, erratic, and godless person, whose  indecencies were his principal stock in trade. Emerson's practical  repudiation of him had had its effect, and the very respectable--that  is, gentlemen of the class of the vestrymen of Grace Church in New York  of his time--looked on him with horror. He had, it seems, attacked  established religion when he made his onslaught in the Brooklyn _Eagle_  on that eminently important body.    The shock of the arrival of Walt Whitman had been broken by the time  that I had begun to read poetry wherever I found it; and I accepted the  curious mixture of prose and poetry in Walt Whitman just as I accepted  the musical Wagner. At that time we had not yet learned to know that  Wagner's music was melodious; we had not yet discovered that  \"Lohengrin,\" for instance, was woven of many melodies, for they were not  detached and made into arias. What could be expected of young persons  brought up on \"The Bohemian Girl\" and \"Maritana\"?    And yet we soon found out without any help from the critics that Walt  Whitman was essentially a poet, and we suspected that his roughness had  been deliberately adopted as the best possible form in which to clothe  ideas which were not conventional, and to attract attention. Most of the  young at that time thought that he had as much right to do this as  Browning had to be wilfully inarticulate. The critics did not concern us  much. There was always a little coterie of students at the University of  Pennsylvania or at Jefferson College, or young men under the influence  of Mr. Edward Roth or Mr. Henry Peterson. Among these was a brilliant  Mexican, David Cerna; Charles Arthur Henry, who died young; Daniel  Dawson, whose \"Seeker in the Marshes\" ought still to live. He was a  devout Whitmanite. Much younger was Harrison Morris, whose opinions,  carrying great weight, occasionally floated to us. As I have said,  Whitman neither startled nor shocked us nor did he cause us to imitate  him. At this time, I was deep in Heinrich Heine, whose prose was not  easy to read, but whose lyrics, with a very slight help from the  dictionary, were entrancing! I could never understand, being enraptured  with Heine's lyrics at that time, why Whitman should have chosen such a  poor medium for lyrical expression or such a rude utterance for some  noble ideas. That he chose at times to put into speech sensual dreams or  passing shadows of evil thoughts astonished us no more than the  existence of the photographic reproductions, then the fashion, of the  gargoyles from the Cathedral of Notre Dame, or the strange and very  improper representations of the Seven Deadly Sins which were sometimes  carved on the backs and the undersides of the stalls in old cathedrals.  We Philadelphians thought that it was not a gentlemanly performance.  There were persons who wallowed in pools of de-civilization, and, though  they might whisper of their mental wallowings in intimate circles, there  was no point whatever in putting them into print. But the great  passages--there are very many--and the noble complete poems--there are a  few--of Whitman were chosen and recited and enjoyed.    Besides, Whitman lived just across the Delaware River, and one could  meet him almost at any time in a street car or lounging about his haunts  in Camden. As he was part of our everyday life he did not for us  represent anything essentially new. When Swinburne and Rossetti and the  Preraphaelites, however, came into our possession, it was quite another  thing! There was no Whitman movement among our young. There was a  marked, but not concentrated, reflection of the Preraphaelites.    Swinburne's music took us by storm! It did not mean that a young man had  a depraved mind because he spouted \"Faustine\" or quoted verse after  verse of the roses and raptures of Swinburne. It simply meant that a  breath of rich, sensuous odours from an exotic island had swept across  the conventional lamp-posts and well-trimmed gardens of his life. I  wonder if any young man feels to-day, in reading Masefield's poems, or  Walter de la Mare's, or Seeger's, or Amy Lowell's, or Robert Frost's, or  even Alfred Noyes's, the thrill that stirred us when we heard the  choruses in \"Atalanta in Calydon\" or Rossetti's \"Blessed Damozel\"? And  there was William Morris and \"The Earthly Paradise!\"    The first appearance of Kipling's poems recalled the old thrills of  \"new\" poets, but of late, though the prospects of poetry are beginning  to revive, no very modern poet seems to have become a part of the daily  lives of the young, who declare that the world is changed, and that the  Old hold no torches for them by which they can discover what they really  want! The more things change, the more they remain the same! And the  young woman who read Swinburne surreptitiously and smoked a cigarette in  private now reads Havelock Ellis on summer porches, and puffs at a  cigarette in public whenever she feels like it. She is really no more  advanced than the girl of the period of the eighties, and not any more  astonishing. It's the same old girl! And the young men who discovered  Swinburne and Rossetti, and who were rather bored by the thinness of  their aftermath, the aesthetic poets, really got more colour and  amazement and delight out of the flashing of the meteors than the youth  of to-day seem to get. It was the fashion then to be blas['e] and cynical  and bored with life; but nobody was really bored because there were too  many amusing and delightful things in the world--as there are now.    Joaquin Miller, with his gorgeous parrots and burning Southern lights  and his intensities and his simulated passion, did not last long. In  England he was looked on as a typical American poet, more decent than  Walt Whitman, less vulgar, but with the charm Whitman had for the  English--that no Englishman could ever be like him! In England they  wanted the Americans raw and fresh and with a savage flavour about them.    I read the poems of Richard Watson Gilder, of Edith Thomas, of Robert  Underwood Johnson--whose \"Italian Rhapsody\" and \"The Winter Hour\" can  never be forgotten--and certain verses of Edmund Clarence Stedman. But  _les jeunes_ prefer the new verse makers. There is even a kind of cult  for the Imagists. A spokesman for the Imagists tells us briefly that  \"free verse\" is a term that may be attached to all that increasing  amount of writing whose cadence is more marked, more definite, and  closer knit than that of prose, but which is not so violently or so  obviously accented as the so-called \"regular verse.\" Richard Aldington's  \"Childhood\" is a very typical example of _vers libre_. It is also an  Imagist poem. It will be remarked that it is so free that there is no  cadence that any musician could find. It is a pretty little joyful  trifle!        There was nothing to see,      Nothing to do,      Nothing to play with,      Except that in an empty room upstairs      There was a large tin box      Containing reproductions of the Magna Charta,      Of the Declaration of Independence,      And of a letter from Raleigh after the Armada;      There were also several packets of stamps,      Yellow and blue Guatemala parrots,      Blue stags and red baboons and birds from Sarawak,      Indians and Men-of-war      From the United States,      And the green and red portraits      Of King Francobollo      Of Italy.        I don't believe in God      I do believe in avenging gods      Who plague us for sins we never sinned      But who avenge us.      That's why I'll never have a child,      Never shut up in a chrysalis in a match-box      For the moth to spoil and crush its bright colours,      Beating its wings against the dingy prison-wall.    Alfred Kreymborg is also very free, and only sometimes musical, but he  hammers in his images with a vengeance. But of all the new Americans,  Vachel Lindsay's jolly fantasies, with a slightly heard banjo  accompaniment, are the most fascinating and least tiresome"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24022"],[0,"A Christmas Carol (#15)"],[1,"do you call wasting of it?' asked old Joe.    'Putting it on him to be buried in, to be sure,' replied the woman, with  a laugh. 'Somebody was fool enough to do it, but I took it off again. If  calico an't good enough for such a purpose, it isn't good enough for  anything. It's quite as becoming to the body. He can't look uglier than  he did in that one.'    Scrooge listened to this dialogue in horror. As they sat grouped about  their spoil, in the scanty light afforded by the old man's lamp, he  viewed them with a detestation and disgust which could hardly have been  greater, though they had been obscene demons marketing the corpse  itself.    'Ha, ha!' laughed the same woman when old Joe producing a flannel bag  with money in it, told out their several gains upon the ground. 'This  is the end of it, you see! He frightened every one away from him when he  was alive, to profit us when he was dead! Ha, ha, ha!'    'Spirit!' said Scrooge, shuddering from head to foot. 'I see, I see. The  case of this unhappy man might be my own. My life tends that way now.  Merciful heaven, what is this?'    He recoiled in terror, for the scene had changed, and now he almost  touched a bed--a bare, uncurtained bed--on which, beneath a ragged  sheet, there lay a something covered up, which, though it was dumb,  announced itself in awful language.    The room was very dark, too dark to be observed with any accuracy,  though Scrooge glanced round it in obedience to a secret impulse,  anxious to know what kind of room it was. A pale light, rising in the  outer air, fell straight upon the bed; and on it, plundered and bereft,  unwatched, unwept, uncared for, was the body of this man.    Scrooge glanced towards the Phantom. Its steady hand was pointed to the  head. The cover was so carelessly adjusted that the slightest raising of  it, the motion of a finger upon Scrooge's part, would have disclosed the  face. He thought of it, felt how easy it would be to do, and longed to  do it; but he had no more power to withdraw the veil than to dismiss the  spectre at his side.    Oh, cold, cold, rigid, dreadful Death, set up thine altar here, and  dress it with such terrors as thou hast at thy command; for this is thy  dominion! But of the loved, revered, and honoured head thou canst not  turn one hair to thy dread purposes, or make one feature odious. It is  not that the hand is heavy, and will fall down when released; it is not  that the heart and pulse are still; but that the hand was open,  generous, and true; the heart brave, warm, and tender, and the pulse a  man's. Strike, Shadow, strike! And see his good deeds springing from the  wound, to sow the world with life immortal!    No voice pronounced these words in Scrooge's ears, and yet he heard them  when he looked upon the bed. He thought, if this man could be raised up  now, what would be his foremost thoughts? Avarice, hard dealing, griping  cares? They have brought him to a rich end, truly!    He lay in the dark, empty house, with not a man, a woman, or a child to  say he was kind to me in this or that, and for the memory of one kind  word I will be kind to him. A cat was tearing at the door, and there was  a sound of gnawing rats beneath the hearthstone. What _they_ wanted in  the room of death, and why they were so restless and disturbed, Scrooge  did not dare to think.    'Spirit!' he said, 'this is a fearful place. In leaving it, I shall not  leave its lesson, trust me. Let us go!'    Still the Ghost pointed with an unmoved finger to the head.    'I understand you,' Scrooge returned, 'and I would do it if I could. But  I have not the power, Spirit. I have not the power.'    Again it seemed to look upon him.    'If there is any person in the town who feels emotion caused by this  man's death,' said Scrooge, quite agonised, 'show that person to me,  Spirit, I beseech you!'    The Phantom spread its dark robe before him for a moment, like a wing;  and, withdrawing it, revealed a room by daylight, where a mother and her  children were.    She was expecting some one, and with anxious eagerness; for she walked  up and down the room, started at every sound, looked out from the  window, glanced at the clock, tried, but in vain, to work with her  needle, and could hardly bear the voices of her children in their play.    At length the long-expected knock was heard. She hurried to the door,  and met her husband; a man whose face was careworn and depressed, though  he was young. There was a remarkable expression in it now, a kind of  serious delight of which he felt ashamed, and which he struggled to  repress.    He sat down to the dinner that had been hoarding for him by the fire,  and when she asked him faintly what news (which was not until after a  long silence), he appeared embarrassed how to answer.    'Is it good,' she said, 'or bad?' to help him.    'Bad,' he answered.    'We are quite ruined?'    'No. There is hope yet, Caroline.'    'If _he_ relents,' she said, amazed, 'there is! Nothing is past hope, if  such a miracle has happened.'    'He is past relenting,' said her husband. 'He is dead.'    She was a mild and patient creature, if her face spoke truth; but she  was thankful in her soul to hear it, and she said so with clasped hands.  She prayed forgiveness the next moment, and was sorry; but the first was  the emotion of her heart.    'What the half-drunken woman, whom I told you of last night, said to me  when I tried to see him and obtain a week's delay--and what I thought  was a mere excuse to avoid me--turns out to have been quite true. He was  not only very ill, but dying, then.'    'To whom will our debt be transferred?'    'I don't know. But, before that time, we shall be ready with the money;  and even though we were not, it would be bad fortune indeed to find so  merciless a creditor in his successor. We may sleep to-night with light  hearts, Caroline!'    Yes. Soften it as they would, their hearts were lighter. The children's  faces, hushed and clustered round to hear what they so little  understood, were brighter; and it was a happier house for this man's  death! The only emotion that the Ghost could show him, caused by the  event, was one of pleasure.    'Let me see some tenderness connected with a death,' said Scrooge; 'or  that dark chamber, Spirit, which we left just now, will be for ever  present to me.'    The Ghost conducted him through several streets familiar to his feet;  and as they went along, Scrooge looked here and there to find himself,  but nowhere was he to be seen. They entered poor Bob Cratchit's house;  the dwelling he had visited before; and found the mother and the  children seated round the fire.    Quiet. Very quiet. The noisy little Cratchits were as still as statues  in one corner, and sat looking up at Peter, who had a book before him.  The mother and her daughters were engaged in sewing. But surely they  were very quiet!    '\"And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them.\"'    Where had Scrooge heard those words? He had not dreamed them. The boy  must have read them out as he and the Spirit crossed the threshold. Why  did he not go on?    The mother laid her work upon the table, and put her hand up to her  face.    'The colour hurts my eyes,' she said.    The colour? Ah, poor Tiny Tim!    'They're better now again,' said Cratchit's wife. 'It makes them weak by  candle-light; and I wouldn't show weak eyes to your father when he comes  home for the world. It must be near his time.'    'Past it rather,' Peter answered, shutting up his book. 'But I think he  has walked a little slower than he used, these few last evenings,  mother.'    They were very quiet again. At last she said, and in a steady, cheerful  voice, that only faltered once:    'I have known him walk with--I have known him walk with Tiny Tim upon  his shoulder very fast indeed.'    'And so have I,' cried Peter. 'Often.'    'And so have I,' exclaimed another. So had all.    'But he was very light to carry,' she resumed, intent upon her work,  'and his father loved him so, that it was no trouble, no trouble. And  there is your father at the door!'    She hurried out to meet him; and little Bob in his comforter--he had  need of it, poor fellow--came in. His tea was ready for him on the hob,  and they all tried who should help him to it most. Then the two young  Cratchits got upon his knees, and laid, each child, a little cheek  against his face, as if they said, 'Don't mind it, father. Don't be  grieved!'    Bob was very cheerful with them, and spoke pleasantly to all the family.  He looked at the work upon the table, and praised the industry and speed  of Mrs. Cratchit and the girls. They would be done long before Sunday,  he said.    'Sunday! You went to-day, then, Robert?' said his wife.    'Yes, my dear,' returned Bob. 'I wish you could have gone. It would have  done you good to see how green a place it is. But you'll see it often. I  promised him that I would walk there on a Sunday. My little, little  child!' cried Bob. 'My little child!'    He broke down all at once. He couldn't help it. If he could have helped  it, he and his child would have been farther apart, perhaps, than they  were.    He left the room, and went upstairs into the room above, which was  lighted cheerfully, and hung with Christmas. There was a chair set close  beside the child, and there were signs of some one having been there  lately. Poor Bob sat down in it, and when he had thought a little and  composed himself, he kissed the little face. He was reconciled to what  had happened, and went down again quite happy.    They drew about the fire, and talked, the girls and mother working  still. Bob told them of the extraordinary kindness of Mr. Scrooge's  nephew, whom he had scarcely seen but once, and who, meeting him in the  street that day, and seeing that he looked a little--'just a little  down, you know,' said Bob, inquired what had happened to distress him.  'On which,' said Bob, 'for he "]]]
