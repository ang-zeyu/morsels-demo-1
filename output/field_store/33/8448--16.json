Alas! that evil living should  have caused his early death!\"    When he had finished laying out the body, he threw some little packets  into the fire which he professed to have found in the youth's pockets,  telling Martin, in order to support this assertion, that they contained  drugs suitable to this disgraceful malady.    He spent the night in the room with the corpse, as he had done in the  case of Madame de Lamotte, and the next day, Sunday, he sent Martin to  the parish church of St. Louis, to arrange for a funeral of the simplest  kind; telling him to fill up the certificate in the name of Beaupre,  born at Commercy, in Lorraine. He declined himself either to go to the  church or to appear at the funeral, saying that his grief was too great.  Martin, returning from the funeral, found him engaged in prayer. Derues  gave him the dead youth's clothes and departed, leaving some money to be  given to the poor of the parish, and for masses to be said for the  repose of the soul of the dead.    He arrived at home in the evening, found his wife entertaining some  friends; and told them he had just come from Chartres, where he had been  summoned on business. Everyone noticed his unusual air of satisfaction,  and he sang several songs during supper.    Having accomplished these two crimes, Derues did not remain idle. When  the murderer's part of his nature was at rest, the thief reappeared. His  extreme avarice now made him regret the expense' caused by the deaths of  Madame de Lamotte and her son, and he wished to recoup himself. Two days  after his return from Versailles, he ventured to present himself at  Edouard's school. He told the master that he had received a letter from  Madame de Lamotte, saying that she wished to keep her son, and asking  him to obtain Edouard's belongings. The schoolmaster's wife, who was  present, replied that that could not be; that Monsieur de Lamotte would  have known of his wife's intention; that she would not have taken such a  step without consulting him; and that only the evening before, they had  received a present of game from Buisson-Souef, with a letter in which  Monsieur de Lamotte entreated them to take great, care of his son.    \"If what you say is true,\" she continued, \"Madame de Lamotte is no doubt  acting on your advice in taking away her son. But I will write to  Buisson.\"    \"You had better not do anything in the matter;\" said Derues, turning to  the schoolmaster. \"It is quite possible that Monsieur de Lamotte does  not know. I am aware that his wife does not always consult him. She is  at Versailles, where I took Edouard to her, and I will inform her of  your objection.\"    To insure impunity for these murders, Derues had resolved on the death  of Monsieur de Lamotte; but before executing this last crime, he wished  for some proof of the recent pretended agreements between himself and  Madame de Lamotte. He would not wait for the disappearance of the whole  family before presenting himself as the lawful proprietor, of  Buisson-Souef. Prudence required him to shelter himself behind a deed  which should have been executed by that lady. On February 27th he  appeared at the office of Madame de Lamotte's lawyer in the rue du Paon,  and, with all the persuasion of an artful tongue, demanded the power of  attorney on that lady's behalf, saying that he had, by private contract,  just paid a hundred thousand livres on the total amount of purchase,  which money was now deposited with a notary. The lawyer, much astonished  that an affair of such importance should have been arranged without any  reference to himself, refused to give up the deed to anyone but Monsieur  or Madame de Lamotte, and inquired why the latter did not appear  herself. Derues replied that she was at Versailles, and that he was to  send the deed to her there. He repeated his request and the lawyer his  refusal, until Derues retired, saying he would find means to compel him  to give up the deed. He actually did, the same day, present a petition  to the civil authority, in which Cyrano Derues de Bury sets forth  arrangements, made with Madame de Lamotte, founded on the deed given by  her husband, and requires permission to seize and withdraw said deed  from the custody in which it remains at present. The petition is  granted. The lawyer objects that he can only give up the deed to either  Monsieur or Madame de Lamotte, unless he be otherwise ordered. Derues  has the effrontery to again appeal to the civil authority, but, for the  reasons given by that public officer, the affair is adjourned.    These two futile efforts might have compromised Derues had they been  heard of at Buisson-Souef; but everything seemed to conspire in the  criminal's favour: neither the schoolmaster's wife nor the lawyer  thought of writing to Monsieur de Lamotte. The latter, as yet  unsuspecting, was tormented by other anxieties, and kept at home by  illness.    In these days, distance is shortened, and one can travel from  Villeneuve-le-Roi-les-Sens to Paris in a few hours. This was not the  case in 1777, when private industry and activity, stifled by routine and  privilege, had not yet experienced the need of providing the means for  rapid communication. Half a day was required to go from the capital to  Versailles; a journey of twenty leagues required at least two days and a  night, and bristled with obstacles ind delays of all kinds. These  difficulties of transport, still greater during bad weather, and a long  and serious attack of gout, explain why Monsieur ale Lamotte, who was so  ready to take alarm, had remained separated from his wife from the  middle of December to the end of February. He had received reassuring  letters from her, written at first with freedom and simplicity; but he  thought he noticed a gradual change in the later ones, which appeared to  proceed more from the mind than the heart. A style which aimed at being  natural was interspersed with unnecessary expressions of affection,  unusual between married people well assured of their mutual love.  Monsieur de Lamotte observed and exaggerated these peculiarities, and  though endeavouring to persuade himself that he was mistaken, he could  not forget them, or regain his usual tranquility. Being somewhat ashamed  of his anxiety, he kept his fears to himself.    One morning, as he was sunk in a large armchair by the fire, his  sitting-room door opened, and the cure entered, who was surprised by his  despondent, sad, and pale appearance. \"What is the matter?\" he inquired,  \"Have you had an extra bad night?\"    \"Yes,\" answered Monsieur de Lamotte.    \"Well, have you any news from Paris?\"    \"Nothing for a whole week: it is odd, is it not?\"    \"I am always hoping that this sale may fall through; it drags on for so  very long; and I believe that Monsieur Derues, in spite of what your  wife wrote a month ago, has not as much money as he pretends to have. Do  you know that it is said that Monsieur Despeignes-Duplessis, Madame  Derues' relative, whose money they inherited, was assassinated?\"    \"Where did you hear that?\"    \"It is a common report in the country, and was brought here by a man who  came recently from Beauvais.\"    \"Have the murderers been discovered?\"    \"Apparently not; justice seems unable to discover anything at all.\"    Monsieur de Lamotte hung his head, and his countenance assumed an  expression of painful thought, as though this news affected him  personally.    \"Frankly,\" resumed the cure, \"I believe you will remain Seigneur du  Buisson-Souef, and that I shall be spared the pain of writing another  name over your seat in the church of Villeneuve.\"    \"The affair must be settled in a few days, for I can wait no longer; if  the purchaser be not Monsieur Derues, it will have to be someone else.  What makes you think he is short of money?\"    \"Oh! oh!\" said the cure, \"a man who has money either pays his debts, or  is a cheat. Now Heaven preserve me from suspecting Monsieur Derues'  honesty!\"    \"What do you know about him?\"    \"Do you remember Brother Marchois of the Camaldulians, who came to see  me last spring, and who was here the day Monsieur Derues arrived, with  your wife and Edouard?\"    \"Perfectly. Well?\"    \"Well, I happened to tell him in one of my letters that Monsieur Derues  had become the purchaser of Buisson-Souef, and that I believed the  arrangements were concluded. Thereupon Brother Marchois wrote asking me  to remind him that he owes them a sum of eight hundred livres, and that,  so far, they have not seen a penny of it.\"    \"Ah!\" said Monsieur de Lamotte, \"perhaps I should have done better not  to let myself be deluded by his fine promises. He certainly has money on  his tongue, and when once one begins to listen to him, one can't help  doing what he wants. All the same, I had rather have had to deal with  someone else.\"    \"And is it this which worries you, and makes you seem so anxious?\"    \"This and other things.\"    \"What, then?\"    \"I am really ashamed to own it, but I am a credulous and timid as any  old woman. Now do not laugh at me too much. Do you believe in dreams?\"    \"Monsieur,\" said the cure, smiling, \"you should never ask a coward  whether he is afraid, you only risk his telling a lie. He will say 'No,'  but he means 'Yes.'\"    \"And are you a coward, my father?\"    \"A little. I don't precisely believe all the nursery, tales, or in the  favourable or unfavourable meaning of some object seen during our sleep,  but--\"    A sound of steps interrupted them, a servant entered, announcing  Monsieur Derues.    On hearing the name, Monsieur de Lamotte felt troubled in spite of  himself, but, overcoming the impression, he rose to meet the visitor.    \"You had better stay,\" he said to the cure, who was also rising to take  leave. \"Stay; we"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2749"],[0,"La Constantin (#15)"],[1,"discovery he had made, a stroke of luck had brought the  pretended chevalier to La Constantin. As Quennebert had kept an eye on  de Jars and was acquainted with all his movements, he was aware of  everything that happened at Perregaud's, and as Charlotte's death  preceded his second marriage by one day, he knew that no serious  consequences would ensue from the legal proceedings taken against him.  He produced the declarations made by Mademoiselle de Guerchi and the  commander, and had the body exhumed. Extraordinary and improbable as his  defence appeared at first to be, the exhumation proved the truth of his  assertions. These revelations, however, drew the eye of justice again on  Perregaud and his partner in crime, and this time their guilt was  brought home to them. They were condemned by parliamentary decree to \"be  hanged by the neck till they were dead, on a gallows erected for that  purpose at the cross roads of the Croix-du-Trahoir; their bodies to  remain there for twenty-four hours, then to be cut down and brought back  to Paris, where they were to be exposed an a gibbet,\" etc., etc.    It was proved that they had amassed immense fortunes in the exercise of  their infamous calling. The entries in the books seized at their house,  though sparse, would have led, if made public, to scandals, involving  many in high places; it was therefore judged best to limit the  accusation to the two deaths by blood-poisoning of Angelique de Querchi  and Charlotte Boullenois.                                            ----"]]]
