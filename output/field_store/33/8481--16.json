No person shall be admitted to rooms or corridors unless      accompanied by an employee.        3. A watchman shall be on the premises from 7 P.M. until 6 A.M.      He shall make the round of the corridors every hour during that      interval, at a quarter past the hour.        4. Rooms are located by their numbers: the first figure in the      room number indicating its floor location.    I could read no further. The match in my fingers burned to a black  thread and dropped. Then, with the burnt stump still in my hand, I  groped through the darkness to the bottom of the second ramp.    Room 4167, then, was on the fourth floor--the topmost floor of the  structure. I must confess that the knowledge did not bring any renewed  burst of courage! The top floor! Three black stair-pits would lie  between me and the safety of escape. There would be no escape! No human  being in the throes of fear could hope to discover that tortured outlet,  could hope to grope his way through Stygian gloom down a triple ramp of  black stairs. And even though he succeeded in reaching the lower  corridors, there was still a blind alley-way, sealed at the outer end by  a high grating of iron bars....           *       *       *       *       *    Escape! The mockery of it caused me to stop suddenly in my ascent and  stand rigid, my whole body trembling violently.    But outside, in the gloom of the street, M. S. was waiting, waiting with  that fiendish glare of triumph that would brand me a man without  courage. I could not return to face him, not though all the horrors of  hell inhabited this gruesome place of mystery. And horrors must surely  inhabit it, else how could one account for that fearful thing on the  grating below? But I had been through horror before. I had seen a man,  supposedly dead on the operating table, jerk suddenly to his feet and  scream. I had seen a young girl, not long before, awake in the midst of  an operation, with the knife already in her frail body. Surely, after  those definite horrors, no _unknown_ danger would send me cringing back  to the man who was waiting so bitterly for me to return.    Those were the thoughts pregnant in my mind as I groped slowly,  cautiously along the corridor of the upper floor, searching each closed  door for the indistinct number 4167. The place was like the center of a  huge labyrinth, a spider-web of black, repelling passages, leading into  some central chamber of utter silence and blackness. I went forward with  dragging steps, fighting back the dread that gripped me as I went  farther and farther from the outlet of escape. And then, after losing  myself completely in the gloom, I threw aside all thoughts of return and  pushed on with a careless, surface bravado, and laughed aloud.           *       *       *       *       *    So, at length, I reached that room of horror, secreted high in the  deeper recesses of the deserted warehouse. The number--God grant I never  see it again!--was scrawled in black chalk on the door--4167. I pushed  the half-open barrier wide, and entered.    It was a small room, even as M. S. had forewarned me--or as the dead  mind of that thing on the grate had forewarned M. S. The glow of my  out-thrust match revealed a great stack of dusty boxes and crates, piled  against the farther wall. Revealed, too, the black corridor beyond the  entrance, and a small, upright table before me.    It was the table, and the stool beside it, that drew my attention and  brought a muffled exclamation from my lips. The thing had been thrust  out of its usual place, pushed aside as if some frenzied shape had  lunged against it. I could make out its former position by the marks on  the dusty floor at my feet. Now it was nearer to the center of the room,  and had been wrenched sidewise from its holdings. A shudder took hold of  me as I looked at it. A living person, sitting on the stool before me,  staring at the door, would have wrenched the table in just this manner  in his frenzy to escape from the room!           *       *       *       *       *    The light of the match died, plunging me into a pit of gloom. I struck  another and stepped closer to the table. And there, on the floor, I  found two more things that brought fear to my soul. One of them was a  heavy flash-lamp--a watchman's lamp--where it had evidently been  dropped. Been dropped in flight! But what awful terror must have gripped  the fellow to make him forsake his only means of escape through those  black passages? And the second thing--a worn copy of a leather-bound  book, flung open on the boards below the stool!    The flash-lamp, thank God! had not been shattered. I switched it on,  directing its white circle of light over the room. This time, in the  vivid glare, the room became even more unreal. Black walls, clumsy,  distorted shadows on the wall, thrown by those huge piles of wooden  boxes. Shadows that were like crouching men, groping toward me. And  beyond, where the single door opened into a passage of Stygian darkness,  that yawning entrance was thrown into hideous detail. Had any upright  figure been standing there, the light would have made an unholy  phosphorescent specter out of it.    I summoned enough courage to cross the room and pull the door shut.  There was no way of locking it. Had I been able to fasten it, I should  surely have done so; but the room was evidently an unused chamber,  filled with empty refuse. This was the reason, probably, why the  watchman had made use of it as a retreat during the intervals between  his rounds.    But I had no desire to ponder over the sordidness of my surroundings. I  returned to my stool in silence, and stooping, picked up the fallen book  from the floor. Carefully I placed the lamp on the table, where its  light would shine on the open page. Then, turning the cover, I began to  glance through the thing which the man before me had evidently been  studying.    And before I had read two lines, the explanation of the whole horrible  thing struck me. I stared dumbly down at the little book and laughed.  Laughed harshly, so that the sound of my mad cackle echoed in a thousand  ghastly reverberations through the dead corridors of the building.           *       *       *       *       *    It was a book of horror, of fantasy. A collection of weird, terrifying,  supernatural tales with grotesque illustrations in funereal black and  white. And the very line I had turned to, the line which had probably  struck terror to that unlucky devil's soul, explained M. S.'s \"decayed  human form, standing in the doorway with arms extended and a frightful  face of passion!\" The description--the same description--lay before me,  almost in my friend's words. Little wonder that the fellow on the  grating below, after reading this orgy of horror, had suddenly gone mad  with fright. Little wonder that the picture engraved on his dead mind  was a picture of a corpse standing in the doorway of room 4167!    I glanced at that doorway and laughed. No doubt of it, it was that awful  description in M. S.'s untempered language that had made me dread my  surroundings, not the loneliness and silence of the corridors about me.  Now, as I stared at the room, the closed door, the shadows on the wall,  I could not repress a grin.    But the grin was not long in duration. A six-hour siege awaited me  before I could hear the sound of human voice again--six hours of  silence and gloom. I did not relish it. Thank God the fellow before me  had had foresight enough to leave his book of fantasy for my amusement!           *       *       *       *       *    I turned to the beginning of the story. A lovely beginning it was,  outlining in some detail how a certain Jack Fulton, English adventurer,  had suddenly found himself imprisoned (by a mysterious black gang of  monks, or something of the sort) in a forgotten cell at the monastery of  El Toro. The cell, according to the pages before me, was located in the  \"empty, haunted pits below the stone floors of the structure....\" Lovely  setting! And the brave Fulton had been secured firmly to a huge metal  ring set in the farther wall, opposite the entrance.    I read the description twice. At the end of it I could not help but lift  my head to stare at my own surroundings. Except for the location of the  cell, I might have been in they same setting. The same darkness, same  silence, same loneliness. Peculiar similarity!    And then: \"Fulton lay quietly, without attempt to struggle. In the dark,  the stillness of the vaults became unbearable, terrifying. Not a  suggestion of sound, except the scraping of unseen rats--\"    I dropped the book with a start. From the opposite end of the room in  which I sat came a half inaudible scuffling noise--the sound of hidden  rodents scrambling through the great pile of boxes. Imagination? I am  not sure. At the moment, I would have sworn that the sound was a  definite one, that I had heard it distinctly. Now, as I recount this  tale of horror, I am not sure.    But I am sure of this: There was no smile on my lips as I picked up the  book again with trembling fingers and continued.    \"The sound died into silence. For an eternity, the prisoner lay rigid,  staring at the open door of his cell. The opening was black, deserted,  like the mouth of a deep tunnel, leading to hell. And then, suddenly,  from the gloom beyond that opening, came an almost noiseless, padded  footfall!\"           *       *       *       *       *    This time there was no doubt of it. The book fell from my fingers,  dropped to the floor with a clatter. Yet even through the sound of its  falling, I heard that fearful sound--the shuffle of a living foot! I sat  motionless, staring with bloodless face at the door of room 4167. And as  I stared, the sound came again, and again--_the slow tread of dragging  footsteps, approaching along the black corridor without_!    I got to my feet like an automaton, swaying heavily.

Then those who stood looking on saw a wondrous thing happen: the wounded  man rose suddenly to his feet, and before his enemy could strike he  leaped, with a great and bitter cry of agony and despair, upon him as he  sat in the saddle above.    Henry of Trutz-Drachen grasped at his horse's mane, but the attack  was so fierce, so sudden, and so unexpected that before he could save  himself he was dragged to one side and fell crashing in his armor upon  the stone roadway of the bridge.    \"The dragon! the dragon!\" roared Baron Conrad, in a voice of thunder,  and with the energy of despair he dragged his prostrate foe toward the  open side of the bridge.    \"Forward!\" cried the chief of the Trutz-Drachen men, and down they rode  upon the struggling knights to the rescue of their master in this new  danger. But they were too late.    There was a pause at the edge of the bridge, for Baron Henry had gained  his feet and, stunned and bewildered as he was by the suddenness of his  fall, he was now struggling fiercely, desperately. For a moment they  stood swaying backward and forward, clasped in one another's arms, the  blood from the wounded man's breast staining the armor of both. The  moment passed and then, with a shower of stones and mortar from beneath  their iron-shod heels, they toppled and fell; there was a thunderous  splash in the water below, and as the men-at-arms came hurrying up and  peered with awe-struck faces over the parapet of the bridge, they saw  the whirling eddies sweep down with the current of the stream, a few  bubbles rise to the surface of the water, and then--nothing; for the  smooth river flowed onward as silently as ever.    Presently a loud voice burst through the awed hush that followed. It  came from William of Roderburg, Baron Henry's kinsman.    \"Forward!\" he cried. A murmur of voices from the others was all the  answer that he received. \"Forward!\" cried the young man again, \"the boy  and those with him are not so far away but that we might yet catch up  with them.\"    Then one of the men spoke up in answer--a man with a seamed,  weather-beaten face and crisp grizzled hair. \"Nay,\" said he, \"our Lord  Baron is gone, and this is no quarrel of ours; here be four of us that  are wounded and three I misdoubt that are dead; why should we follow  further only to suffer more blows for no gain?\" A growl of assent rose  from those that stood around, and William of Roderburg saw that nothing  more was to be done by the Trutz-Dragons that day.          XIV. How Otto Saw the Great Emperor.    Through weakness and sickness and faintness, Otto had lain in a half  swoon through all that long journey under the hot May sun. It was as in  a dreadful nightmare that he had heard on and on and on that monotonous  throbbing of galloping hoofs upon the ground; had felt that last kiss  that his father had given him upon his cheek. Then the onward ride  again, until all faded away into a dull mist and he knew no more. When  next he woke it was with the pungent smell of burned vinegar in his  nostrils and with the feeling of a cool napkin bathing his brow. He  opened his eyes and then closed them again, thinking he must have been  in a dream, for he lay in his old room at the peaceful monastery of the  White Cross on the hill; the good Father Abbot sat near by, gazing upon  his face with the old absent student look, Brother John sat in the deep  window seat also gazing at him, and Brother Theodore, the leech of the  monastery, sat beside him bathing his head. Beside these old familiar  faces were the faces of those who had been with him in that long flight;  the One-eyed Hans, old Master Nicholas his kinsman, and the others.  So he closed his eyes, thinking that maybe it was all a dream. But the  sharp throbbing of the poor stump at his wrist soon taught him that he  was still awake.    \"Am I then really home in St. Michaelsburg again?\" he murmured, without  unclosing his eyes.    Brother Theodore began snuffling through his nose; there was a pause.  \"Yes,\" said the old Abbot at last, and his gentle voice trembled as  he spoke; \"yes, my dear little child, thou art back again in thine own  home; thou hast not been long out in the great world, but truly thou  hast had a sharp and bitter trial of it.\"    \"But they will not take me away again, will they?\" said Otto quickly,  unclosing his blue eyes.    \"Nay,\" said the Abbot, gently; \"not until thou art healed in body and  art ready and willing to go.\"    Three months and more had passed, and Otto was well again; and now,  escorted by One-eyed Hans and those faithful few who had clung to the  Baron Conrad through his last few bitter days, he was riding into the  quaint old town of Nurnburg; for the Emperor Rudolph was there at that  time, waiting for King Ottocar of Bohemia to come thither and answer  the imperial summons before the Council, and Otto was travelling to the  court.    As they rode in through the gates of the town, Otto looked up at the  high-peaked houses with their overhanging gables, the like of which he  had never seen before, and he stared with his round blue eyes at seeing  them so crowded together along the length of the street. But most of  all he wondered at the number of people that passed hither and thither,  jostling each other in their hurry, and at the tradesmen's booths  opening upon the street with the wonderful wares hanging within; armor  at the smiths, glittering ornaments at the goldsmiths, and rich fabrics  of silks and satins at the mercers. He had never seen anything so rich  and grand in all of his life, for little Otto had never been in a town  before.    \"Oh! look,\" he cried, \"at that wonderful lady; see, holy father! sure  the Emperor's wife can be no finer than that lady.\"    The Abbot smiled. \"Nay, Otto,\" said he, \"that is but a burgher's wife or  daughter; the ladies at the Emperor's court are far grander than such as  she.\"    \"So!\" said Otto, and then fell silent with wonder.    And now, at last the great moment had come when little Otto with his own  eyes was to behold the mighty Emperor who ruled over all the powerful  kingdoms of Germany and Austria, and Italy and Bohemia, and other  kingdoms and principalities and states. His heart beat so that he could  hardly speak as, for a moment, the good Abbot who held him by the hand  stopped outside of the arrased doorway to whisper some last instructions  into his ear. Then they entered the apartment.    It was a long, stone-paved room. The floor was covered with rich rugs  and the walls were hung with woven tapestry wherein were depicted  knights and ladies in leafy gardens and kings and warriors at battle.  A long row of high glazed windows extended along the length of the  apartment, flooding it with the mellow light of the autumn day. At  the further end of the room, far away, and standing by a great carved  chimney place wherein smouldered the remains of a fire, stood a group of  nobles in gorgeous dress of velvet and silks, and with glittering golden  chains hung about their necks.    One figure stood alone in front of the great yawning fireplace. His  hands were clasped behind him, and his look bent thoughtfully upon the  floor. He was dressed only in a simple gray robe without ornament or  adornment, a plain leathern belt girded his waist, and from it hung a  sword with a bone hilt encased in a brown leathern scabbard. A noble  stag-hound lay close behind him, curled up upon the floor, basking in  the grateful warmth of the fire.    As the Father Abbot and Otto drew near he raised his head and looked  at them. It was a plain, homely face that Otto saw, with a wrinkled  forehead and a long mouth drawn down at the corners. It was the face of  a good, honest burgher burdened with the cares of a prosperous trade.  \"Who can he be,\" thought Otto, \"and why does the poor man stand there  among all the great nobles?\"    But the Abbot walked straight up to him and kneeled upon the floor,  and little Otto, full of wonder, did the same. It was the great Emperor  Rudolph.    \"Who have we here,\" said the Emperor, and he bent his brow upon the  Abbot and the boy.    \"Sire,\" said Abbot Otto, \"we have humbly besought you by petition, in  the name of your late vassal, Baron Conrad of Vuelph of Drachenhausen,  for justice to this his son, the Baron Otto, whom, sire, as you may see,  hath been cruelly mutilated at the hands of Baron Henry of Roderburg of  Trutz-Drachen. He hath moreover been despoiled of his lands, his castle  burnt, and his household made prisoner.\"    The Emperor frowned until the shaggy eyebrows nearly hid the keen gray  twinkle of the eyes beneath. \"Yes,\" said he, \"I do remember me of  that petition, and have given it consideration both in private and in  council.\" He turned to the group of listening nobles. \"Look,\" said he,  \"at this little child marred by the inhumanity and the cruelty of those  robber villains. By heavens! I will put down their lawless rapine, if I  have to give every castle from the north to the south to the flames and  to the sword.\" Then turning to Otto again, \"Poor little child,\" said he,  \"thy wrongs shall be righted, and so far as they are able, those cruel  Roderburgs shall pay thee penny for penny, and grain for grain, for what  thou hast lost; and until such indemnity hath been paid the family of  the man who wrought this deed shall be held as surety.\"    Little Otto looked up in the kind, rugged face above him. \"Nay, Lord  Emperor,\" said he, in his quaint, quiet way, \"there are but two in the  family--the mother and the daughter--and I have promised to marry the  little girl when she and I are old enough; so, if you please, I would  not have harm happen to her.\"    The Emperor continued to look down at the kneeling boy, and at last he  gave a short, dry laugh. \"So be it,\" said he, \"thy plan is not without  its wisdom. Mayhap it is all for the best that the affair should be  ended thus peacefully."]]]
