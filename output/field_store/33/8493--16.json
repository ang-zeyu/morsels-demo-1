[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29070"],[0,"Brighter Britain! (Volume 1 of 2) (#15)"],[1," at Te Otamatea a  race-course has been made, where the annual races of the Kaipara  districts are held.    Altogether, we like Te Otamatea, with its beautiful situation and lovely  views, better than Port Albert. This is a sort of bloated Manchester or  Birmingham of the district. No less than six or seven houses are  visible close together. If you count barns and byres, and such more  distant houses as are visible from the steamer's deck, there must be  over a dozen. It is horridly populous. Moreover, one sees here, so  strongly marked, that uncouth rawness that attends incipient  civilization. Nature has been cleared away to make room for the art of  man, and art has not yet got beyond the inchoate unloveliness of bare  utilitarianism. The beautiful woods have given place to a charred,  stumpy, muddy waste, on which stand the gaunt, new frame-houses.  Gardens, orchards, cornfields, and meadows are things to come; until  they do the natural beauty of the place is killed and insulted. But what  have we to do with sentimental rubbish? This is Progress! Bless it!    Of course we did not expect to get to our destination all in a minute,  for Te Pahi is more than forty miles from Helensville, in a straight  line. We started about five o'clock in the morning, but it is late in  the day before we get into the Arapaoa. By taking advantage of the  tides, the _Lily_ manages to accomplish ten knots an hour. But the going  in and out of different rivers, though we do not go far up any of them,  and the various stoppages, short though they be, make it late in the  afternoon before we sight Te Pahi.    We are coming up the broad Arapaoa, and before us we suddenly see Te  Pahi, a vision of loveliness, \"our\" township, as we are already calling  it. A high, wooded bluff, the termination of a hill-range behind, rushes  out into the tranquil, gleaming water. Round the base of the bluff, on a  little flat between it and the white shingly beach, are the houses of  the settlement. Four families live here at this time; and besides their  abodes, there are a row of three cottages, called immigrant barracks, a  boatbuilder's workshop, and an assembly hall. The neatest, fairest,  best, and to-be-the-most-progressive of all the Kaipara townships. We  say this \"as shouldn't;\" but it is so.    The broad, lake-like expanse of water over which we are moving--four  miles across from shore to shore--parts before Te Pahi. It stretches  away to the left in a wide reach, to form the Matakohe, out of which  opens the Paparoa, hidden from sight at this point. Before us, bearing  to the right, is the Pahi river. It is a vista of woodland scenery,  glorious in the rays of the declining sun. Its shores are steep, and  broken into numberless little bays and promontories, all clothed with  bush to the water's edge. Far up, the towering ranges close down and  terminate the view.    On the left of our position the shore is not so high, and we can see a  good deal of grass, with the white homestead of a settler's station.  Beyond is what appears to be a chain of distant mountains. Looking to  the right an exclamation bursts from our lips, for there is the  loveliest view we have yet seen.    A deep, semi-circular bay falls back from the river, bordered with a  belt of dazzling shingle. Beyond and round it rises a perfect  amphitheatre, filled with bush more sumptuous and varied than any we  have gazed upon all day. The range seems to rise in terraces, and just  one abrupt gap about the centre discloses the peak of a conical hill  behind. The whole is a perfect idyllic picture, not to be described in a  breath; for this is the showplace of the Kaipara. It is Te Puke Tapu,  famous in Maori history as the scene of a great battle.    Beautiful as this place is, it would doubtless soon have been marred by  the pitiless axe and fire of the settler, but that it is sacred soil.  The Maoris will not enter it, and they prohibit Europeans from  transgressing within its boundaries. Nor will they sell the land,  although its superb fertility has induced some settlers to offer almost  fabulous prices. For, under those rich greenwoods, caressed and buried  in ferns, lie scattered the bony relics of the flower of Ngatewhatua  chivalry.    So much and more a fellow-passenger tells us, while we gaze at the view,  inwardly wondering whether wandering artist will ever present this  glorious landscape now before us to people at home. But the story must  be reserved for another time, until we are able to do justice to it.    At last the _Lily_ is lying right off the beach of Te Pahi township, and  her whistle is echoing among the woods on the ranges above, scaring the  shags, kingfishers, and rock-snipe on the oyster-beds and beaches. Very  speedily, two or three people appear at the township, and one of them  puts off in a boat to board us.    To him we are shortly introduced by the Pirate, and handed over to his  care, as candidates for a berth in the immigrant barracks. We discuss a  nobbler, which is at once a farewell one with Pirate Tom, \"The Crew,\"  and the rest of our fellow-passengers, and an introductory ceremony with  our new acquaintance, \"The Mayor.\"    A merry, athletic, thoroughly healthy and hearty Englishman is our  friend, the Mayor, always in a hurry and bustle of business, for his  avocations are startlingly numerous. He is the oldest inhabitant of the  township, and was called the Mayor when he dwelt there solitary, a few  years ago. Now he is postmaster, storekeeper, justiciary,  acting-parson, constabulary, board of works, tax-gatherer, customs  officer, farmer, dealer in everything, town clerk, lawyer, doctor, and,  perhaps, a score of things beside, as they reckon such in Te Pahi.    The Mayor hurries us and our traps ashore in his boat, and deposits us  on the beach. Then he hastens back to the steamer, bidding us wait  there, as \"he'll be back to fix us before we can have time to wink.\"  Half a dozen men and boys--the entire population--stand at a little  distance, regarding us shyly, but inquisitively, with pocketed hands.  Some young children are also apparent.    As we stand gazing about us, and wondering how to make acquaintance with  the group, a little girl comes running up to us. It is always the  superior sex, you see, even in the bush, that make the first advances.  She offers us peaches, the little bright-eyed, sunny-faced thing; and  readily submits to be kissed; indeed, appears to expect it. Then she  prattles away to us in right merry fashion.    The little incident breaks the ice. The group of men come forward and  enter into conversation. Perhaps a trifle constrained at first--for  dwellers in the bush necessarily lose the readiness of people more  accustomed to society--they show themselves anxious enough to be  hospitable and welcoming. They are eager to know who we are, naturally,  what we are going to do, and so forth. When it comes out that we have  advented to join Old Colonial, we are admitted as chums at once, and  formally accepted as free citizens of the soon-to-be prosperous and  thriving town of Te Pahi.    By-and-by the Mayor gets back; and the _Lily_ steams off again on her  way to Matakohe, where she will anchor for the night, returning to  Helensville next day. Old Colonial, it seems, is away up the river  somewhere, but is expected at the township that night, as he knows that  the steamer is due, and that we were likely to come by it.    And now what are we to do? Go to the immigrant barracks, we suppose,  since they are expressly designed for the accommodation of such  new-chums as ourselves. Barracks be hanged! Is it likely that we are to  be allowed to go there while the Mayor has a comfortable house in which  to receive guests? Not likely! Why, others of the citizens are intent on  hospitality as well, and any of the four homes of the place may be ours  for the present, if we will.    But the Mayor is not going to be choused out of his guests; don't you  believe it! What is he Mayor and boss of the township for, he would like  to know, if not to look after new-chums? Besides, on his own sole  responsibility, he has turned the immigrant barracks into a warehouse  for produce, since no immigrants ever seemed to be coming to occupy  them. So, he is in a measure bound to take possession of us, don't you  see? and, by Jove, he means to, what's more!    Then we walk along to the Mayor's residence, and a comfortable,  well-furnished house it is, quite a surprise to us, who hardly expected  home-comforts in the bush. But then the Mayor is a thriving man, and has  a wife to look after him.    A cheerful, amiable lady bids us welcome, with a heartiness as though  she were only too glad to see us, although it would appear as if her  hands were full enough of housework already, without the additional care  of looking after a couple of helpless, unready new-chums. But strangers  are so rare up here, that much must be made of them when they do come;  therefore, the fatted calf is killed, so to speak, and we are regaled in  handsome fashion.    Later, after supper, there is a sudden arrival in the darkness of the  night. We hear a stamping on the verandah outside, and a loud, lusty,  half-remembered voice addressing the Mayor.    \"Have they come, I say? Where are they, then?\"    The door of the room we are sitting in bursts open, and a burly, bearded  man, rough and savage enough in outward appearance, sooth to say,  rushes in upon us. He seizes our hands in a grip that brings the tears  to our eyes, he shakes them up and down with vehemence, and while we are  trying to make out whether this Old Colonial can really and truly be our  sometime schoolfellow, he exclaims--    \"Well, this _is_ good! I _am_ glad to see you! _Now_ we'll have a  splendid time! Now we'll _make_ this old place hum round! Oh, but this  is glorious!\"    Thus, and much more; and so, with the true, hearty good-fellowship of  the bush, are we welcomed to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29084"],[0,"The Cook and Housekeeper's Complete and Universal Dictionary; Including a System (#15)"],[1," keep out the cold. The bees remaining in a torpid state during the  winter, they require but little food; but as every sunny day revives and  prompts them to exercise, a small supply is necessary on these  occasions. Many hives of bees which are supposed to have died of cold,  have in reality perished by famine, especially when a rainy summer  prevented them from collecting a sufficient store of provision. Hence  the hives should be carefully examined in autumn, and ought then to  weigh at least eighteen pounds each. When bees require to be fed, the  honey should be diluted with water, and put into an empty comb, split  reeds, or upon clear wood, which the bees will suck perfectly dry. But  it is a much better way to replenish the weak hives in September, with  such a portion of combs filled with honey taken from other hives as may  be deemed a sufficient supply. This is done by turning up the weak hive,  cutting out the empty combs, and placing full ones in their stead, so  secure as not to fall down when the hive is replaced. If this be too  troublesome, a plate of honey may be set under the hive, and straws laid  across the plate, covered with paper perforated with small holes,  through which the bees will suck the honey without difficulty.--These  valuable insects are liable to various disorders, both from the food  they eat, from foreign enemies, and from one another. If they have fed  greedily on the blossoms of the milk thistle or the elm, it will render  them incapable of working, and the hive will be stained with filth. The  best cure in this case is pounded pomegranate seed, moistened with sweet  wine; or raisins mixed with wine or mead, and the infusion of rosemary.  When they are infested with vermin, the hive must be cleansed, and  perfumed with a branch of pomegranate or the wild fig-tree, which will  effectually destroy them. Butterflies sometimes conceal themselves in  the hives, and annoy the bees; but these intruders may easily be  exterminated by placing lighted candles in deep tin pots between the  hives, as they will be attracted by the flame, and so perish. In order  to extirpate wasps and hornets preying upon the honey, it is only  necessary to expose shallow vessels near the hive with a little water,  to which those depredators eagerly repair to quench their thirst, and  thus easily drown themselves. To prevent bees of one society from  attacking or destroying those of another, which is frequently the case,  the following method may be tried. Let a board about an inch thick be  laid on the bee bench, and set the hive upon it with its mouth exactly  on the edge. The mouth of the hive should also be contracted to about an  inch in length, and a semicircular hole made in the board immediately  under the mouth of the hive. By this simple method, the bees which come  to make the attack will be foiled, and constrained to act with great  disadvantage. If this do not succeed, remove the hive to a distant part  of the garden, and to a more easterly or colder aspect, which will  frequently end the contest.--When bees are to be taken up for the  purpose of obtaining the wax and honey, great care should be taken not  to destroy the insects; and for this end the following method is  recommended. The upper box on the hive, which principally contains the  honey, is first to be taken off. The joint should be loosened, the  cement scraped off, and then a piece of iron wire to be drawn through  the comb so as to divide it. When the upper box is thus separated, its  cover is to be taken off and immediately placed on the second box, which  is now the highest. Having taken out the contents of the box which has  been separated, it is to be placed again on the stand, under the lower  box, and its door only is to be left open. If any bees remain in the box  when taken away, a little smoke will drive them out, and they will  quickly return to their own hive. In this manner a second or a third box  of honey may be removed in succession, when the lower part of the hive  appears to be full; but care must be taken not to deprive the bees  entirely of the stock which they have collected for the winter. In  taking up a common straw hive of bees, the best way is to remove it  into a darkened room, that it may appear to the bees as if it were late  in the evening. Then gently turning the hive bottom upwards, and  supporting it in that position, cover it with an empty hive a little  raised towards the window, to give the bees sufficient light to guide  their ascent. Keep the empty hive steadily supported on the edge of the  full hive, and strike the hand round the full hive to frighten the bees,  till they have nearly all ascended into the other. The new hive  containing the bees must be placed on the stand of the apiary, to  receive the absent bees as they return from the fields.      BEET ROOT. This cooling and wholesome vegetable is good boiled, and  sliced with a small quantity of onion, or stewed with whole onions in  the following manner. Boil the beet tender with the skin on, slice it  into a stewpan with a little broth and a spoonful of vinegar. Simmer it  till the gravy is tinged with the colour; then put it into a small dish,  and make a round of button onions, first boiled tender. Take off the  skin just before serving, and let them be quite hot and clear. Or roast  three large onions, and peel off the outer skins till they look clear;  and serve round them the stewed beet root. The root must not be broken  before it is dressed, or it will lose its colour, and look ill.--To  preserve beet-root for winter use, they should not be cleared from the  earth, but kept in layers of dry sand.      BEETLES. When these insects become troublesome in the house, put some  small lumps of quick lime into the chinks or holes of the wall from  whence they issue, or scatter it on the ground. Or at night, lay a  spoonful of treacle on a piece of wood, and float it in a pan of water:  beetles are so fond of syrup, that they will be drowned in attempting to  get at it. The common black beetle may also be extirpated by placing a  hedgehog in the room, during the summer nights; or by laying a bundle of  pea straw near their holes, and afterwards burning it when the beetles  have crept into it.      BENTON CAKES. Mix a paste of flour, a little bit of butter, and milk.  Roll it as thin as possible, and bake on a backstone over the fire, or  on a hot hearth. Another sort of Benton tea-cakes are made like  biscuits, by rubbing into a pound of flour six ounces of butter, and  three large spoonfuls of yeast. Work up the paste with a sufficient  quantity of new milk, make it into biscuits, and prick them with a clean  fork. Or melt six or seven ounces of butter, with a sufficient quantity  of new milk warmed to make seven pounds of flour into a stiff paste.  Roll it thin, and make it into biscuits.      BENTON SAUCE. Grate some horse-radish, or scrape it very fine. Add to it  a little made mustard, some pounded white sugar, and four large  spoonfuls of vinegar. Serve it up in a saucer: this is good with hot or  cold roast beef.      BILLS OF FARE, or list of various articles in season in different  months.
