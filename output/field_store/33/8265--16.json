Of this  oppression there passed ten years while the causeway was made by which  they drew the stones, which causeway they built, and it is a work not  much less, as it appears to me, than the pyramid; for the length of it  is five furlongs and the breadth ten fathoms and the height, where it  is highest, eight fathoms, and it is made of stone smoothed and with  figures carved upon it. For this they said, the ten years were spent,  and for the underground he caused to be made as sepulchral chambers for  himself in an island, having conducted thither a channel from the Nile.  For the making of the pyramid itself there passed a period of twenty  years; and the pyramid is square, each side measuring eight hundred  feet, and the height of it is the same. It is built of stone smoothed  and fitted together in the most perfect manner, not one of the stones  being less than thirty feet in length. This pyramid was made after the  manner of steps which some called \"rows\" and others \"bases\": and when  they had first made it thus, they raised the remaining stones with  machines made of short pieces of timber, raising them first from the  ground to the first stage of the steps, and when the stone got up to  this it was placed upon another machine standing on the first stage,  and so from this it was drawn to the second upon another machine; for as  many as were the courses of the steps, so many machines there were also,  or perhaps they transferred one and the same machine, made so as easily  to be carried, to each stage successively, in order that they might  take up the stones; for let it be told in both ways, according as it  is reported. However that may be the highest parts of it were finished  first, and afterwards they proceeded to finish that which came next to  them, and lastly they finished the parts of it near the ground and the  lowest ranges. On the pyramid it is declared in Egyptian writing how  much was spent on radishes and onions and leeks for the workmen, and if  I rightly remember that which the interpreter said in reading to me this  inscription, a sum of one thousand six hundred talents of silver was  spent; and if this is so, how much besides is likely to have been  expended upon the iron with which they worked, and upon bread and  clothing for the workmen, seeing that they were building the works for  the time which has been mentioned and were occupied for no small time  besides, as I suppose, in the cutting and bringing of the stones and in  working at the excavation under the ground? Cheops moreover came, they  said, to such a pitch of wickedness, that being in want of money he  caused his own daughter to sit in the stews, and ordered her to obtain  from those who came a certain amount of money (how much it was they did  not tell me): and she not only obtained the sum appointed by her father,  but also she formed a design for herself privately to leave behind her  a memorial, and she requested each man who came in to give her one stone  upon her building: and of these stones, they told me, the pyramid was  built which stands in front of the great pyramid in the middle of the  three, each side being one hundred and fifty feet in length.    This Cheops, the Egyptians said, reigned fifty years; and after he was  dead his brother Chephren succeeded to the kingdom. This king followed  the same manner of dealing as the other, both in all the rest and also  in that he made a pyramid, not indeed attaining to the measurements  of that which was built by the former (this I know, having myself also  measured it), and moreover there are no underground chambers beneath nor  does a channel come from the Nile flowing to this one as to the other,  in which the water coming through a conduit built for it flows round  an island within, where they say that Cheops himself is laid: but for a  basement he built the first course of Ethiopian stone of divers colours;  and this pyramid he made forty feet lower than the other as regards  size, building it close to the great pyramid. These stand both upon the  same hill, which is about a hundred feet high. And Chephren they said  reigned fifty and six years. Here then they reckon one hundred and six  years, during which they say that there was nothing but evil for the  Egyptians, and the temples were kept closed and not opened during all  that time. These kings the Egyptians by reason of their hatred of them  are not very willing to name; nay, they even call the pyramids after the  name of Philitis the shepherd, who at that time pastured flocks in those  regions. After him, they said, Mykerinos became king over Egypt, who was  the son of Cheops; and to him his father's deeds were displeasing, and  he both opened the temples and gave liberty to the people, who were  ground down to the last extremity of evil, to return to their own  business and to their sacrifices: also he gave decisions of their causes  juster than those of all the other kings besides. In regard to this then  they commend this king more than all the other kings who had arisen in  Egypt before him; for he not only gave good decisions, but also when  a man complained of the decision, he gave him recompense from his own  goods and thus satisfied his desire. But while Mykerinos was acting  mercifully to his subjects and practising this conduct which has been  said, calamities befell him, of which the first was this, namely that  his daughter died, the only child whom he had in his house: and being  above measure grieved by that which had befallen him, and desiring to  bury his daughter in a manner more remarkable than others, he made a cow  of wood, which he covered over with gold, and then within it he buried  this daughter who as I said, had died. This cow was not covered up in  the ground, but it might be seen even down to my own time in the city  of Sais, placed within the royal palace in a chamber which was greatly  adorned; and they offer incense of all kinds before it every day, and  each night a lamp burns beside it all through the night. Near this cow  in another chamber stand images of the concubines of Mykerinos, as the  priests at Sais told me; for there are in fact colossal wooden statues,  in number about twenty, made with naked bodies; but who they are I am  not able to say, except only that which is reported. Some however tell  about this cow and the colossal statues the following tale, namely that  Mykerinos was enamoured of his own daughter and afterwards ravished her;  and upon this they say that the girl strangled herself for grief, and  he buried her in this cow; and her mother cut off the hands of the maids  who had betrayed the daughter to her father; wherefore now the images of  them have suffered that which the maids suffered in their life. In thus  saying they speak idly, as it seems to me, especially in what they say  about the hands of the statues; for as to this, even we ourselves saw  that their hands had dropped off from lapse of time, and they were to be  seen still lying at their feet even down to my time. The cow is covered  up with a crimson robe, except only the head and the neck, which are  seen, overlaid with gold very thickly; and between the horns there is  the disc of the sun figured in gold. The cow is not standing up but  kneeling, and in size is equal to a large living cow. Every year it is  carried forth from the chamber, at those times, I say, the Egyptians  beat themselves for that god whom I will not name upon occasion of such  a matter; at these times, I say, they also carry forth the cow to the  light of day, for they say that she asked of her father Mykerinos, when  she was dying, that she might look upon the sun once in the year.    After the misfortune of his daughter it happened, they said, secondly  to this king as follows:--An oracle came to him from the city of Buto,  saying that he was destined to live but six years more, in the seventh  year to end his life: and he being indignant at it sent to the Oracle  a reproach against the god, making complaint in reply that whereas  his father and uncle, who had shut up the temples and had not only not  remembered the gods, but also had been destroyers of men, had lived for  a long time, he himself, who practised piety, was destined to end his  life so soon: and from the Oracle came a second message, which said  that it was for this very cause that he was bringing his life to a swift  close; for he had not done that which it was appointed for him to do,  since it was destined that Egypt should suffer evils for a hundred and  fifty years, and the two kings who had arisen before him had perceived  this, but he had not. Mykerinos having heard this, and considering that  this sentence had passed upon him beyond recall, procured many lamps,  and whenever night came on he lighted these and began to drink and take  his pleasure, ceasing neither by day nor by night; and he went about to  the fen-country and to the woods and wherever he heard there were the  most suitable places of enjoyment. This he devised (having a mind to  prove that the Oracle spoke falsely) in order that he might have twelve  years of life instead of six, the nights being turned into days.    This king also left behind him a pyramid, much smaller than that of his  father, of a square shape and measuring on each side three hundred feet  lacking twenty, built moreover of Ethiopian stone up to half the  height. This pyramid some of the Hellenes say was built by the courtesan  Rhodopis, not therein speaking rightly: and besides this it is evident  to me that they who speak thus do not even know who Rhodopis was,  for otherwise they would not have attributed to her the building of a  pyramid like this, on which have been spent (so to speak) innumerable  thousands of talents:"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21312"],[0,"Glyn Severn's Schooldays (#15)"],[1,"of the masters and give the alarm.  The  consequence was that the latter were getting close up and able to make  out that a fierce fight was going on between Slegge and Glyn Severn, the  former seconded by Burney, the latter by the young Prince.    There was no shouting, no sound of egging on by the juvenile spectators,  only an intense silence, punctuated by a hoarse panting sound, the  trampling of feet, and the _pat, pat_, of blows.    The last of these was a heavy one, delivered right from the shoulder  with all his remaining force--for the boy was pretty well exhausted--by  Glyn Severn; and it was just as the Doctor was filling his capacious  chest with the breath necessary after his hurried advance to deliver a  stern command to cease fighting.  But before he uttered a word his  biggest pupil came staggering back towards the ring of boys on the  Doctor's side, and as they hurriedly gave way down came Slegge flat upon  his back at the fresh-comer's feet.    After delivering his final blow, Glyn Severn nearly followed his  impulse, and had hard work to check himself from falling flat upon his  adversary.  As it was, he dropped only upon one knee, rose again  painfully, and stood with bruised and bleeding face gazing blankly at  his stern preceptor, who now thundered out in his deepest tones, \"What  is the meaning of this?\"    At the sight of the Doctor a thrill ran through the little throng; and,  moved as by one impulse, there was the suggestion of a rush for safety.  But the thunderous tones of the Doctor's voice seemed to freeze every  young abettor in his steps.    \"Do you hear me, sirs?\" cried the Doctor again.  \"What is the meaning of  this?\"    It was the smallest boy of the school who replied, in a shrill voice  full of excitement, conveying the very plain truth:    \"Fight, sir.  Tom Slegge and one of the new boys.\"    \"Silence!\" thundered the Doctor.  \"You know my rules, and that I have  forbidden fighting.  Here, somebody, one of the high form boys--you,  Burney, let me hear what you have to say.  Speak out, sir.  Ah, you have  been seconder, I suppose?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" faltered the lad, whose hands showed unpleasant traces of  what he had been doing.    \"Ah,\" continued the Doctor.--\"Mr Rampson, see that not a boy dares to  move.--Now, Burney, let me hear the whole truth of this from beginning  to end.  No suppression, sir, from favour or fear.  I want the  straightforward truth.  Who began this disgraceful business?--Stop!  Mr  Rampson, here.  Is that boy Slegge much hurt?\"    \"A bit stunned, sir, and stupid with his injuries, but he's all right,  sir; he's coming round,\" and in proof thereof Slegge, with the  assistance of the master's hands, struggled to his feet, and stood  shaking his head as if he felt a wasp in his ear, and then promptly sat  down again.    \"Now, Burney,\" cried the Doctor, \"speak out.  Who began this?\"    The boy addressed glanced at the Doctor and then at Slegge, while his  lips parted; but he uttered no sound.    \"Do you hear me, sir?\" roared the Doctor.    \"Big Tom Slegge, sir,\" came from the shrill little fellow who had before  spoken.    The Doctor frowningly held up one big white finger at the little  speaker, who shrank back amongst his fellows.    \"I saw that look of yours, Burney,\" said the Doctor sternly, \"and I read  its meaning, sir.  It seemed to appeal to your older schoolfellow, one  of the principals in this disgraceful encounter, asking him if you might  speak out.  I'll answer for him.  Yes, sir; and beware lest you, as a  gentleman's son, lower your position in my eyes by making any  suppression.  What was the cause of the quarrel?\"    Burney's face was working, for after the excitement of the fight and its  sudden ending he felt hysterically emotional, and in a broken voice the  truth came pouring forth.    \"I can't help it, sir, and if he bullies me afterwards for speaking I  must tell all.  Slegge's been jealous of both the new boys ever since  they came.  He's been as disagreeable and spiteful as could be, and  forced us all to take his side.\"    \"Yes, yes; go on,\" cried the Doctor, for the boy stopped with a gasp;  but he spoke more calmly afterwards.  \"He's been working it up, sir, for  a fight for days, out of jealousy because he thought more was made of  Singh and Severn than of him.\"    \"Indeed!\" said the Doctor, nodding his head.    \"And when it came, sir, to them having such a fuss made over them about  their riding the elephant, and you asking them afterwards to dinner, it  was bound to come.\"    The boy stopped, and the Doctor turned to the classical master.    \"Do you hear this, Mr Rampson?\" he said, in his most sarcastic manner,  the one he adopted towards the most stupidly ignorant boys.  \"I presume  then that I ought to ask Mr Thomas Slegge's permission before asking  the two new pupils to my board.\"    \"Yes, sir,\" burst out Burney, who had gathered breath and had now got  into the swing of speaking.  \"It was bound to come, sir.  Slegge said he  should do it, and I can't help it if I do seem like a sneak for telling  all.\"    \"Go on, Burney,\" said the Doctor.  \"I'll be the judge of that.\"    \"Well, sir, he told all us seniors to be ready for the first chance  there was.  He said--\"    \"Who said?\" interrupted the Doctor.  \"Let us be perfectly correct.\"    \"Slegge, sir.  He said we were to be ready, for he was going to begin by  giving the nigger fits.\"    \"By giving the nigger fits?\" said the Doctor slowly.  \"And, pray, what  did he mean by that?\"    \"Licking Singh, sir; the new boy from India, sir.\"    \"Oh,\" said the Doctor sarcastically.  \"But he has not been giving the  nigger fits.\"    \"No, sir; next day he changed his mind, and said he'd let Severn have it  first.\"    \"Have it first?\" said the Doctor slowly.  \"Your language is not very  correct, Burney.  But go on.\"    \"Yes, sir.  He sent word round this morning to all the boys except those  two that we were to meet down here by the elms; and when we did come,  just as he thought, Severn and Singh fancied there was some new game on,  and came to see.  Then, sir, Slegge began at Severn, insulting him,  sir--yes, that he did.  I'm not going to say everything he called him;  but he told him to stand up like a man and take his punishment.\"    \"Yes; and what did Severn say?\"    \"He said, sir, he was not going to degrade himself by fighting like a  street blackguard; and then Slegge jeered and mocked at him and set us  all at him to call him coward and cur; and he ended, sir, by walking  straight up to him, and he asked him three times if he'd fight, and  Severn, sir, said he wouldn't, and then Slegge gave him a coward's  blow--one in the nose, sir, and made it bleed.\"    \"Ah!\" said the Doctor.  \"And what did Severn do?\"    \"Took out his pocket-handkerchief, sir, and wiped it.\"    \"Exactly,\" said the Doctor, with grim seriousness, \"and a very correct  thing too; that is,\" he continued hastily, as if he had some slight idea  of the suggestiveness of his remark, \"I mean, that Severn behaved very  well in refusing to fight.  But he turned upon Slegge, of course, after  such an incitement as that.\"    \"No, sir, he didn't; he only stood there looking very red and with his  lips quivering, and looking quite wild and reproachful at Singh.\"    \"Oh!\" said the Doctor.  \"Then Singh has been in it too?\"    \"Yes, sir; Singh came at him like a lion, and said he was a coward and a  cur, and that they'd never be friends again.  But Severn did not speak a  word, and before we knew what was going to happen next, Slegge took hold  of Singh's ear and asked him what it had to do with him, and he called  him a nigger and an impudent foreign brat; and almost before we knew  where we were, Singh hit Slegge quick as lightning, one-two right in the  face, and then stepped back and began to take off his jacket; but before  he could pull it off, Slegge got at him; and the boys hissed, sir, for  while Singh's hands were all in a tangle like in the sleeves, Slegge hit  him three or four times in the face; but it only made him fierce, and  getting rid of his jacket, he went at big Slegge.\"    \"Ah!\" ejaculated the Doctor.  \"Go on, Mr Burney.\"    \"Slegge made a dash at him, sir; but Singh was too quick, and stepped on  one side; and when Slegge turned upon him again Severn sprang in between  them, snatched off his jacket, and crammed it into Singh's hands.  And  then all the boys began to hooray.\"    \"What for?\" said the Doctor.    \"Because Severn said, sir, out loud, `Not such a coward as you think,  Singhy.  I must fight now.'\"    \"Bad--very bad,\" said the Doctor; \"cowardly too--two boys to one.\"    \"Oh no, sir; Singh didn't do any more.  He only laughed, threw down the  jacket, and began slapping Severn on the back; and he seconded him, sir,  quite fair and square all through, just as if he knew all about  fighting, though he is a nig--Indian, sir.  And there was a tremendous  fight, till, after being a good deal knocked about, Severn was getting  it all his own way, and finished off Slegge just as you came up, sir.  And that's the whole truth.--Isn't it, boys?\"    There was a chorus of the word \"Yes,\" and the Doctor drew a deep breath  as it came to an end.  Then he uttered the interjection \"Hah!\" looked  very searchingly at Slegge, scanning the injuries he had received, and  afterwards made the same keen examination of Severn.    \"Disgraceful!\" he said at last, shaking his head and frowning.  \"Young  gentlemen, you will resume your studies at once.--Mr Rampson, will you  see that these two injured lads go to their dormitory directly.  Mrs  Hamton will attend to their injuries and report to me whether it is  necessary for the surgeon to be called in.--You hear me, boys?\" shouted  the Doctor.  \"Disperse at once.  There will be a lecture in the theatre  in ten minutes' time.--Mr Rampson, there is to be no communication  between these two principals and the rest.--You, Burney, and you, Singh,  go on to my library.\"  "]]]
