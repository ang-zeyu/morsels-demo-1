Wherefore what I shall now advance in favour of what I have  lately Deliver'd shall be Deduc'd from Experiments made Divers Years  since. The first of which would have been much more considerable, but  that by some intervening Accidents I was Necessitated to lose the best  time of the year, for a trial of the Nature of that I design'd; it  being about he [Transcriber's Note: the] middle of _May_ before I was  able to begin an Experiment which should have then been two moneths  old; but such as it was, it will not perhaps be impertinent to Give  You this Narrative of it. At the time newly Mention'd, I caus'd My  Gardiner (being by Urgent Occasions Hinder'd from being present  myself) to dig out a convenient quantity of good Earth, and dry it  well in an Oven, to weigh it, to put it in an Earthen pot almost level  with the Surface of the ground, and to set in it a selected seed he  had before received from me, for that purpose, of Squash, which is an  Indian kind of Pompion, that Growes apace; this seed I Ordered Him to  Water only with Rain or Spring Water. I did not (when my Occasions  permitted me to visit it) without delight behold how fast it Grew,  though unseasonably sown; but the Hastning Winter Hinder'd it from  attaining any thing neer its due and Wonted magnitude; (for I found  the same Autumn, in my Garden, some of those plants, by Measure, as  big about as my Middle) and made me order the having it taken Up;  Which about the Middle of _October_ was carefully Done by the same  Gardiner, who a while after sent me this account of it; _I have  Weighed the Pompion with the Stalk and Leaves, all which Weighed three  pound wanting a quarter; Then I took the Earth, baked it as formerly,  and found it just as much as I did at First, which made me think I had  not dry'd it Sufficiently: then I put it into the Oven twice More,  after the Bread was Drawn, and Weighed it the Second time, but found  it Shrink little or nothing._    But to deal Candidly with You, _Eleutherius_, I must not conceal from  You the Event of another Experiment of this Kind made this present  Summer, wherein the Earth seems to have been much more Wasted; as may  appear by the following account, Lately sent me by the same Gardiner,  in these Words. _To give You an Account of your Cucumbers, I have  Gain'd two Indifferent Fair Ones, the Weight of them is ten Pound and  a Halfe, the Branches with the Roots Weighed four Pounds wanting two  Ounces; and when I had weighed them I took the Earth, and bak'd it in  several small Earthen Dishes in an Oven; and when I had so done, I  found the Earth wanted a Pound and a halfe of what it was formerly;  yet I was not satisfi'd, doubting the Earth was not dry: I put it into  an Oven the Second Time, (after the Bread was drawn) and after I had  taken it out and weighed it, I found it to be the Same Weight: So I  Suppose there was no Moisture left in the Earth. Neither do I think  that the Pound and Halfe that was wanting was Drawn away by the  Cucumber but a great Part of it in the Ordering was in Dust (and the  like) wasted: (the Cucumbers are kept by themselves, lest You should  send for them.)_ But yet in this Tryal, _Eleutherius_, it appears that  though some of the Earth, or rather the dissoluble Salt harbour'd in  it, were wasted, the main Body of the Plant consisted of Transmuted  Water. And I might add, that a year after I caus'd the formerly  mentioned Experiment, touching large Pompions, to be reiterated, with  so good success, that if my memory does not much mis-inform me, it did  not only much surpass any that I made before, but seem'd strangely to  conclude what I am pleading for; though (by reason I have unhappily  lost the particular Account my Gardiner writ me up of the  Circumstances) I dare not insist upon them. The like Experiment may be  as conveniently try'd with the seeds of any Plant, whose growth is  hasty, and its size Bulky. If Tobacco will in These Cold Climates Grow  well in Earth undung'd, it would not be amiss to make a Tryal with it;  for 'tis an annual Plant, that arises where it prospers, sometimes as  high as a Tall Man; and I have had leaves of it in my Garden neer a  Foot and a Halfe broad. But the next time I Try this Experiment, it  shall be with several seeds of the same sort, in the same pot of  Earth, that so the event may be the more Conspicuous. But because  every Body has not Conveniency of time and place for this Experiment  neither, I made in my Chamber, some shorter and more Expeditions  [Transcriber's Note: Expeditious] Tryals. I took a Top of Spearmint,  about an Inch Long, and put it into a good Vial full of Spring water,  so as the upper part of the Mint was above the neck of the Glass, and  the lower part Immers'd in the Water; within a few Dayes this Mint  began to shoot forth Roots into the Water, and to display its Leaves,  and aspire upwards; and in a short time it had numerous Roots and  Leaves, and these very strong and fragrant of the Odour of the Mint:  but the Heat of my Chamber, as I suppose, kill'd the Plant when it was  grown to have a pretty thick Stalk, which with the various and  ramified Roots, which it shot into the Water as if it had been Earth,  presented in its Transparent Flower-pot a Spectacle not unpleasant to  behold. The like I try'd with sweet Marjoram, and I found the  Experiment succeed also, though somewhat more slowly, with Balme and  Peniroyal, to name now no other Plants. And one of these Vegetables,  cherish'd only by Water, having obtain'd a competent Growth, I did,  for Tryals sake, cause to be Distill'd in a small Retort, and thereby  obtain'd some Phlegme, a little Empyreumaticall Spirit, a small  Quantity of adust Oyl, and a _Caput mortuum_; which appearing to be a  Coal concluded it to consist of Salt and Earth: but the Quantity of  it was so small that I forbore to Calcine it. The Water I us'd to  nourish this Plant was not shifted nor renewed; and I chose  Spring-water rather than Rain-water, because the latter is more  discernably a kinde of [Greek: panspermia], which, though it be  granted to be freed from grosser Mixtures, seems yet to Contain in it,  besides the Steams of several Bodies wandering in the Air, which may  be suppos'd to impregnate it, a certain Spirituous Substance, which  may be Extracted out of it, and is by some mistaken for the Spirit of  the World Corporify'd, upon what Grounds, and with what Probability, I  may elsewhere perchance, but must not now, Discourse to you.    But perhaps I might have sav'd a great part of my Labour. For I finde  that _Helmont_ (an Author more considerable for his Experiments than  many Learned men are pleas'd to think him) having had an Opportunity  to prosecute an Experiment much of the same nature with those I have  been now speaking of, for five Years together, obtain'd at the end of  that time so notable a Quantity of Transmuted Water, that I should  scarce Think it fit to have his Experiment, and Mine Mention'd  together, were it not that the Length of Time Requisite to this may  deterr the Curiosity of some, and exceed the leasure of Others; and  partly, that so Paradoxical a Truth as that which these Experiments  seem to hold forth, needs to be Confirm'd by more Witnesses then one,  especially since the Extravagancies and Untruths to be met with in  _Helmonts_ Treatise of the Magnetick Cure of Wounds, have made his  Testimonies suspected in his other Writings, though as to some of the  Unlikely matters of Fact he delivers in them, I might safely undertake  to be his Compurgator. But that Experiment of his which I was  mentioning to You, he sayes, was this. He took 200 pound of Earth  dry'd in an Oven, and having put it into an Earthen Vessel and  moisten'd it with Raine water he planted in it the Trunk of a Willow  tree of five pound Weight; this he Water'd, as need required, with  Rain or with Distill'd Water; and to keep the Neighbouring Earth from  getting into the Vessell, he employ'd a plate of Iron tinn'd over and  perforated with many holes. Five years being efflux'd, he took out  the Tree and weighed it, and (with computing the leaves that fell  during four Autumnes) he found it to weigh 169 pound, and about three  Ounces. And Having again Dry'd the Earth it grew in, he found it want  of its Former Weight of 200 Pound, about a couple only of Ounces; so  that 164 pound of the Roots, Wood, and Bark, which Constituted the  Tree, seem to have Sprung from the Water. And though it appears not  that _Helmont_ had the Curiosity to make any _Analysis_ of this Plant,  yet what I lately told You I did to One of the Vegetables I nourish'd  with Water only, will I suppose keep You from Doubting that if he had  Distill'd this Tree, it would have afforded him the like Distinct  Substances as another Vegetable of the same kind. I need not Subjoyne  that I had it also in my thoughts to try how Experiments to the same  purpose with those I related to You would succeed in other Bodies then  Vegetables, because importunate Avocations having hitherto hinder'd me  from putting my Design in Practise, I can yet speak but Confecturally  [Transcriber's Note: Conjecturally] of the Success: but the best is,  that the Experiments already made and mention'd to you need not the  Assistance of new Ones, to Verifie as much as my present task makes it  concern me to prove by Experiments of this Nature.    One would suspect (sayes _Eleutherius_ after his long silence) by what  You have been discoursing, that You are not far from _Helmonts_  Opinion about the Origination of Compound Bodies, and perhaps too  dislike not the Arguments which he imployes to prove it.

He said:    \"I could not, for the life of me, remember the word for getting the  company _endwise_ so that it could go through the gate; so, as we came  near the gate, I shouted, 'This company is dismissed for two minutes,  when it will fall in again on the other side of the fence.'\"      A HISTORIC MYSTERY EXPLAINED    Captain Lincoln had his sword taken from him for shooting within limits.  Many have wondered that a man of Lincoln's intelligence should have been  guilty of this stupid infraction of ordinary army regulations.  Biographers of Lincoln puzzled over this until the secret was explained  by William Turley Baker, of Bolivia, Ill., at the Lincoln Centenary in  Springfield. All unconscious of solving a historic mystery, \"Uncle  Billy\" Baker related the following story which explains that the  shooting was purely accidental:    \"My father was roadmaster general in the Black Hawk War. Lincoln used to  come often to our house and talk it all over with father, when I was a  boy, and I've heard them laugh over their experiences in that war. The  best joke of all was this: Father received orders one day to throw log  bridges over a certain stream the army had to cross. He felled some  tall, slim black walnuts--the only ones he could find there--and the  logs were so smooth and round that they were hard to walk on any time.  This day it rained and made them very slippery. Half of the soldiers  fell into the stream and got a good ducking. Captain Lincoln was one of  those that tumbled in. He just laughed and scrambled out as quick as he  could. He always made the best of everything like that.    \"Well, that evening when the company came to camp, some of them had dog  tents--just a big canvas sheet--and the boys laughed to see Lincoln  crawl under one of them little tents. He was so long that his head and  hands and feet stuck out on all sides. The boys said he looked just like  a big terrapin. After he had got himself stowed away for the night, he  remembered that he hadn't cleaned his pistol, after he fell into the  creek.    \"So he backed out from under his canvas shell and started to clean it  out. It was what was called a bulldog pistol, because it had a blunt,  short muzzle. Abe's forefinger was long enough to use as a ramrod for  it. But before he began operations he snapped the trigger and, to his  astonishment, the thing went off!    \"Pretty soon an orderly came along in great haste, yellin', 'Who did  that?--Who fired that shot?' Some of the men tried to send the orderly  along about his business, making believe the report was heard further  on, but Lincoln he wouldn't stand for no such deception, spoken or  unspoken. 'I did it,' says he, beginning to explain how it happened.    \"You see, his legs was so blamed long, and he must have landed on his  feet, in the creek, and got out of the water without his pistol getting  wet, 'way up there in his weskit!    \"But he had to pay the penalty just the same, for they took his sword  away from him for several days. You see, he was a captain and ought to  'a' set a good example in military discipline.\"      HOW CAPTAIN LINCOLN SAVED AN INDIAN'S LIFE    One day an old \"friendly Indian\" came into camp with a \"talking paper\"  or pass from the \"big white war chief.\" The men, with the pioneer idea  that \"the only good Indian is a dead Indian,\" were for stringing him up.  The poor old red man protested and held the general's letter before  their eyes.    \"Me good Injun,\" he kept saying, \"white war chief say me good Injun.  Look--talking paper--see!\"    \"Get out! It's a forgery! Shoot him! String him up!\" shouted the  soldiers angrily.    This noise brought Captain Lincoln out of his tent. At a glance he saw  what they were about to do. He jumped in among them, shouting  indignantly:    \"Stand back, all of you! For shame! I'll fight you all, one after the  other, just as you come. Take it out on me if you can, but you shan't  hurt this poor old Indian. When a man comes to me for help, he's going  to get it, if I have to lick all Sangamon County to give it to him.\"    The three months for which the men were enlisted soon expired, and  Lincoln's captaincy also ended. But he re-enlisted as a private, and  remained in the ranks until the end of the war, which found him in  Wisconsin, hundreds of miles from New Salem. He and a few companions  walked home, as there were not many horses to be had. Lincoln enlivened  the long tramp with his fund of stories and jokes.    It is sometimes asserted that Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis met at  this early day, as officers in the Black Hawk War, but this statement  is not founded on fact, for young Lieutenant Davis was absent on a  furlough and could not have encountered the tall captain from the  Sangamon then, as many would like to believe.    Lincoln always referred to the Black Hawk War as a humorous adventure.  He made a funny speech in Congress describing some of his experiences in  this campaign in which he did not take part in a battle, nor did he even  catch sight of a hostile Indian.      AGAIN A RIVER PILOT    Abe was still out of work. Just before he enlisted he piloted the  _Talisman_, a steamboat which had come up the Sangamon on a trial trip,  in which the speed of the boat averaged four miles an hour. At that time  the wildest excitement prevailed. The coming of the _Talisman_ up their  little river was hailed with grand demonstrations and much  speech-making. Every one expected the Government to spend millions of  dollars to make the Sangamon navigable, and even New Salem (which is not  now to be found on the map) was to become a flourishing city, in the  hopeful imaginings of its few inhabitants. Lincoln, being a candidate,  naturally \"took the fever,\" and shared the delirium that prevailed. He  could hardly have done otherwise, even if he had been so disposed. This  was before the days of railroads, and the commerce and prosperity of the  country depended on making the smaller streams navigable. Lincoln  received forty dollars, however, for his services as pilot. The  _Talisman_, instead of establishing a river connection with the  Mississippi River cities, never came back. She was burned at the wharf  in St. Louis, and the navigation of the poor little Sangamon, which was  only a shallow creek, was soon forgotten.      LINCOLN'S ONLY DEFEAT BY A DIRECT VOTE    When Abe returned from the war he had no steady employment. On this  account, especially, he must have been deeply disappointed to be  defeated in the election which took place within two weeks after his  arrival. His patriotism had been stronger than his political sagacity.  If he had stayed at home to help himself to the Legislature he might  have been elected, though he was then a comparative stranger in the  county. One of the four representatives chosen was Peter Cartwright, the  backwoods preacher.    Lincoln afterward mentioned that this was the only time he was ever  defeated by a direct vote of the people.          CHAPTER XII    BUYING AND KEEPING A STORE      After making what he considered a bad beginning politically, young  Lincoln was on the lookout for a \"business chance.\" One came to him in a  peculiar way. A man named Radford had opened a store in New Salem.  Possessing neither the strength nor the sagacity and tact of Abe  Lincoln, he was driven out of business by the Clary's Grove Boys, who  broke his store fixtures and drank his liquors. In his fright Radford  was willing to sell out at almost any price and take most of his pay in  promissory notes. He was quickly accommodated. Through William G. Greene  a transfer was made at once from Reuben Radford to William Berry and  Abraham Lincoln. Berry had $250 in cash and made the first payment. In a  few hours after a violent visit from those ruffians from Clary's Grove  Berry and Lincoln had formed a partnership and were the nominal owners  of a country store.    The new firm soon absorbed the stock and business of another firm, James  and Rowan Herndon, who had previously acquired the stock and debts of  the predecessors in their business, and all these obligations were  passed on with the goods of both the Radford and Herndon stores to  \"Honest Abe.\"    The senior partner of the firm of Berry & Lincoln was devoted to the  whisky which was found in the inventory of the Radford stock, and the  junior partner was given over to the study of a set of \"Blackstone's  Commentaries,\" text-books which all lawyers have to study, that came  into his possession in a peculiar way, as Candidate Lincoln told an  artist who was painting his portrait in 1860:    \"One day a man who was migrating to the West drove up in front of my  store with a wagon which contained his family and household plunder. He  asked me if I would buy an old barrel for which he had no room in his  wagon, and which contained nothing of special value. I did not want it,  but to oblige him I bought it, and paid him, I think, half a dollar for  it. Without further examination I put it away in the store and forgot  all about it.    \"Some time after, in overhauling things, I came upon the barrel, and  emptying it on the floor to see what it contained, I found at the bottom  of the rubbish a complete set of 'Blackstone's Commentaries.' I began to  read those famous works. I had plenty of time; for during the long  summer days, when the farmers were busy with their crops, my customers  were few and far between. The more I read the more intensely interested  I became. Never in my whole life was my mind so thoroughly absorbed. I  read until I devoured them.\"    With one partner drinking whisky and the other devouring \"Blackstone,\"  it was not surprising that the business \"winked out,\" as Lincoln  whimsically expressed it, leaving the conscientious junior partner  saddled with the obligations of the former owners of two country stores,  and owing an amount so large that Lincoln often referred to it as \"the  national debt.\""]]]
