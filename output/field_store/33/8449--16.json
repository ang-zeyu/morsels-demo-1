A roar as of a wounded tiger escaped from Robert's breast: all but blind  with rage, he nearly trampled his mother under the feet of his horse,  which seemed to feel his master's anger, and plunging violently,  breathed blood from his nostrils. When the prince had poured every  possible execration on his brother's head, he turned and galloped away  from the accursed castle, flying to the Duke of Durazzo, whom he had  only just left, to tell him of this outrage and stir him to revenge.  Charles was talking carelessly with his young wife, who was but little  used to such tranquil conversation and expansiveness, when the Prince of  Tarentum, exhausted, out of breath, bathed in perspiration, came up with  his incredible tale. Charles made him say it twice over, so impossible  did Louis's audacious enterprise appear to him. Then quickly changing  from doubt to fury, he struck his brow with his iron glove, saying that  as the queen defied him he would make her tremble even in her castle and  in her lover's arms. He threw one withering look on Marie, who  interceded tearfully for her sister, and pressing Robert's hand with  warmth, vowed that so long as he lived Louis should never be Joan's  husband.    That same evening he shut himself up in his study, and wrote letters  whose effect soon appeared. A bull, dated June 2, 1346, was addressed to  Bertram de Baux, chief-justice of the kingdom of Sicily and Count of  Monte Scaglioso, with orders to make the most strict inquiries  concerning Andre's murderers, whom the pope likewise laid under his  anathema, and to punish them with the utmost rigour of the law. But a  secret note was appended to the bull which was quite at variance with  the designs of Charles: the sovereign pontiff expressly bade the  chief-justice not to implicate the queen in the proceedings or the  princes of the blood, so as to avoid worse disturbances, reserving, as  supreme head of the Church and lord of the kingdom, the right of judging  them later on, as his wisdom might dictate.    For this imposing trial Bertram de Baux made great preparations. A  platform was erected in the great hall of tribunal, and all the officers  of the crown and great state dignitaries, and all the chief barons, had  a place behind the enclosure where the magistrates sat. Three days after  Clement VI's bull had been published in the capital, the chief-justice  was ready for a public examination of two accused persons. The two  culprits who had first fallen into the hands of justice were, as one may  easily suppose, those whose condition was least exalted, whose lives  were least valuable, Tommaso Pace and Nicholas of Melazzo. They were led  before the tribunal to be first of all tortured, as the custom was. As  they approached the judges, the notary passing by Charles in the street  had time to say in a low voice--    \"My lord, the time has come to give my life for you: I will do my duty;  I commend my wife and children to you.\"    Encouraged by a nod from his patron, he walked on firmly and  deliberately. The chief-justice, after establishing the identity of the  accused, gave them over to the executioner and his men to be tortured in  the public square, so that their sufferings might serve as a show and an  example to the crowd. But no sooner was Tommaso Pace tied to the rope,  when to the great disappointment of all he declared that he would  confess everything, and asked accordingly to be taken back before his  judges. At these words, the Count of Terlizzi, who was following every  movement of the two men with mortal anxiety, thought it was all over now  with him and his accomplices; and so, when Tommaso Pace was turning his  steps towards the great hall, led by two guards, his hands tied behind  his back, and followed by the notary, he contrived to take him into a  secluded house, and squeezing his throat with great force, made him thus  put his tongue out, whereupon he cut it off with a sharp razor.    The yells of the poor wretch so cruelly mutilated fell on the ears of  the Duke of Durazzo: he found his way into the room where the barbarous  act had been committed just as the Count of Terlizzi was coming out, and  approached the notary, who had been present at the dreadful spectacle  and had not given the least sign of fear or emotion. Master Nicholas,  thinking the same fate was in store for him, turned calmly to the duke,  saying with a sad smile--    \"My lord, the precaution is useless; there is no need for you to cut out  my tongue, as the noble count has done to my poor companion. The last  scrap of my flesh may be torn off without one word being dragged from my  mouth. I have promised, my lord, and you have the life of my wife and  the future of my children as guarantee for my word.\"    \"I do not ask for silence,\" said the duke solemnly; \"you can free me  from all my enemies at once, and I order you to denounce them at the  tribunal.\"    The notary bowed his head with mournful resignation; then raising it in  affright, made one step up to the duke and murmured in a choking voice--    \"And the queen?\"    \"No one would believe you if you ventured to denounce her; but when the  Catanese and her son, the Count of Terlizzi and his wife and her most  intimate friends, have been accused by you, when they fail to endure the  torture, and when they denounce her unanimously--\"    \"I see, my lord. You do not only want my life; you would have my soul  too. Very well; once more I commend to you my children.\"    With a deep sigh he walked up to the tribunal. The chief-justice asked  Tommaso Pace the usual questions, and a shudder of horror passed through  the assembly when they saw the poor wretch in desperation opening his  mouth, which streamed with blood. But surprise and terror reached their  height when Nicholas of Melazzo slowly and firmly gave a list of Andre's  murderers, all except the queen and the princes of the blood, and went  on to give all details of the assassination.    Proceedings were at once taken for the arrest of the grand seneschal,  Robert of Cabane, and the Counts of Terlizzi and Morcone, who were  present and had not ventured to make any movement in self-defence. An  hour later, Philippa, her two daughters, and Dona Cancha joined them in  prison, after vainly imploring the queen's protection. Charles and  Bertrand of Artois, shut up in their fortress of Saint Agatha, bade  defiance to justice, and several others, among them the Counts of Meleto  and Catanzaro, escaped by flight.    As soon as Master Nicholas said he had nothing further to confess, and  that he had spoken the whole truth and nothing but the truth, the  chief-justice pronounced sentence amid a profound silence; and without  delay Tommaso Pace and the notary were tied to the tails of two horses,  dragged through the chief streets of the town, and hanged in the market  place.    The other prisoners were thrown into a subterranean vault, to be  questioned and put to the torture on the following day. In the evening,  finding themselves in the same dungeon, they reproached one another,  each pretending he had been dragged into the crime by someone else. Then  Dona Cancha, whose strange character knew no inconsistencies, even face  to face with death and torture, drowned with a great burst of laughter  the lamentations of her companions, and joyously exclaimed--    \"Look here, friends, why these bitter recriminations--this ill-mannered  raving? We have no excuses to make, and we are all equally guilty. I am  the youngest of all, and not the ugliest, by your leave, ladies, but if  I am condemned, at least I will die cheerfully. For I have never denied  myself any pleasure I could get in this world, and I can boast that much  will be forgiven me, for I have loved much: of that you, gentlemen, know  something. You, bad old man,\" she continued to the Count of Terlizzi,  \"do you not remember lying by my side in the queen's ante-chamber? Come,  no blushes before your noble family; confess, my lord, that I am with  child by your Excellency; and you know how we managed to make up the  story of poor Agnes of Durazzo and her pregnancy--God rest her soul! For  my part, I never supposed the joke would take such a serious turn all at  once. You know all this and much more; spare your lamentations, for, by  my word, they are getting very tiresome: let us prepare to die joyously,  as we have lived.\"    With these words she yawned slightly, and, lying down on the straw, fell  into a deep sleep, and dreamed as happy dreams as she had ever dreamed  in her life.    On the morrow from break of day there was an immense crowd on the sea  front. During the night an enormous palisade had been put up to keep the  people away far enough for them to see the accused without hearing  anything. Charles of Durazzo, at the head of a brilliant cortege of  knights and pages, mounted on a magnificent horse, all in black, as a  sign of mourning, waited near the enclosure. Ferocious joy shone in his  eyes as the accused made their way through the crowd, two by two, their  wrists tied with ropes; for the duke every minute expected to hear the  queen's name spoken. But the chief-justice, a man of experience, had  prevented indiscretion of any kind by fixing a hook in the tongue of  each one. The poor creatures were tortured on a ship, so that nobody  should hear the terrible confessions their sufferings dragged from them.    But Joan, in spite of the wrongs that most of the conspirators had done  her, felt a renewal of pity for the woman she had once respected as a  mother, for her childish companions and her friends, and possibly also  some remains of love for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27509"],[0,"The 2006 CIA World Factbook (#15)"],[1,"information in the Factbook given in  metric units, rather than the units standard to US measure?    US Federal agencies are required by the Metric Conversion Act of  1975 (Public Law 94-168) and by Executive Order 12770 of July 1991  to use the International System of Units, commonly referred to as  the metric system or SI. In addition, the metric system is used by  over 95 percent of the world's population.    Why don't you include information on minimum and maximum temperature  extremes?    The Factbook staff judges that this information would only be useful  for some (generally smaller) countries. Larger countries can have  large temperature extremes that do not represent the landmass as a  whole. In the future, such a category may be adopted listing the  extremes, but also adding a normal temperature range found  throughout most of a country's territory.    What information sources are used for the country flags?    Flag designs used in The World Factbook are those recognized by the  protocol office of the US Department of State.    Why do your GDP (Gross Domestic Product) statistics differ from  other sources?    We have two sets of GDP dollar estimates in The World Factbook , one  derived from purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations and the  other derived using official exchange rates (OER). Other sources  probably use one of the two. See the Notes and Definitions section  on GDP and GDP methodology for more information.    On the CIA Web site, Chiefs of State is updated weekly, but the last  update for the Factbook was an earlier date. Why the discrepancy?    Although Chiefs of State and The World Factbook both appear on the  CIA Web site, they are produced and updated by separate staffs.  Chiefs of State includes fewer countries but more leaders, and is  updated more frequently than The World Factbook, which has a much  larger database, and includes all countries.    Some percentage distributions do not add to 100. Why not?    Because of rounding, percentage distributions do not always add  precisely to 100%. Rounding of numbers always results in a loss of  precision--i.e., error. This error becomes apparent when percentage  data are totaled, as the following two examples show:                       Original Data     Rounded to whole integer      Example 1               43.2                           43                            30.4                           30                            26.4                           26                            ----                           --                           100.0                           99      Example 2               42.8                           43                            31.6                           32                            25.6                           26                            ----                           --                           100.0                          101    When this occurs, we do not force the numbers to add exactly to 100,  because doing so would introduce additional error into the  distribution.    What rounding convention does The World Factbook use?    In deciding on the number of digits to present, the Factbook staff  assesses the accuracy of the original data and the needs of US  Government officials. All of the economic data are processed by  computer--either at the source or by the Factbook staff. The economic  data presented in The Factbook, therefore, follow the rounding  convention used by virtually all numerical software applications,  namely, any digit followed by a \"5\" is rounded up to the next higher  digit, no matter whether the original digit is even or odd. Thus,  for example, when rounded to the nearest integer, 2.5 becomes 3,  rather than 2, as occurred in some pre-computer rounding systems.    Why do you list \"Independence\" dates for countries like France,  Germany, and the United Kingdom?    For most countries, this entry presents the date that sovereignty  was achieved and from which nation, empire, or trusteeship. For  other countries, the date may be some other significant nationhood  event such as the traditional founding date or the date of  unification, federation, confederation, establishment, or state  succession and so may not strictly be an \"Independence\" date.  Dependent entities have the nature of their dependency status noted  in this same entry.      Technical    Does The World Factbook comply with Section 508 of the  Rehabilitation Act regarding accessibility of Web pages?    The World Factbook home page has a link entitled \"Text/Low Bandwidth  Version.\" The country data in the text version is fully accessible.  We believe The World Factbook is compliant with the Section 508 law  in both fact and spirit. If you are experiencing difficulty, please  use our comment form to provide us details of the specific problem  you are experiencing and the assistive software and/or hardware that  you are using so that we can work with our technical support staff  to find and implement a solution. We welcome visitors' suggestions  to improve accessibility of The World Factbook and the CIA Web site.    I am using the Factbook online and it is not working. What is wrong?    Hundreds of \"Factbook\" look-alikes exist on the Internet. The  Factbook site at: www.cia.gov is the only official site.    When I attempt to download a PDF (Portable Document Format) map file  (or some other map) the file has no image. Can you fix this?    Some of the files on The World Factbook Web site are large and could  take several minutes to download on a dial-up connection. The screen  might be blank during the download process.    When I open a map on The World Factbook site, it is fuzzy or  granular, or too big or too small. Why?    Adjusting the resolution setting on your monitor should correct this  problem.    Is The World Factbook country data available in machine-readable  format? All I can find is HTML, but I'm looking for simple tabular  data.    The Factbook Web site now features \"Rank Order\" pages for selected  Factbook entries. \"Rank Order\" pages are available for those data  fields identified with a small bar chart icon located next to the  title of the data entry. In addition, all of the \"Rank Order\" pages  can be downloaded as tab-delimited data files that can be opened in  other applications such as spreadsheets and databases.

The country served as a buffer between the    British and Russian empires until it won independence from notional    British control in 1919. A brief experiment in democracy ended in a    1973 coup and a 1978 Communist counter-coup. The Soviet Union    invaded in 1979 to support the tottering Afghan Communist regime,    but withdrew 10 years later under relentless pressure by    internationally supported anti-Communist mujahedin rebels. A civil    war between mujahedin factions erupted following the 1992 fall of    the Communist regime. The Taliban, a hardline Pakistani-sponsored    movement that emerged in 1994 to end the country's civil war and    anarchy, seized Kabul in 1996 and most of the country outside of    opposition Northern Alliance strongholds by 1998. Following the 11    September 2001 terrorist attacks, a US, Allied, and Northern    Alliance military action toppled the Taliban for sheltering Osama    BIN LADIN. In late 2001, a conference in Bonn, Germany, established    a process for political reconstruction that included the adoption of    a new constitution and a presidential election in 2004, and National    Assembly elections in 2005. On 7 December 2004, Hamid KARZAI became    the first democratically elected president of Afghanistan. The    National Assembly was inaugurated on 19 December 2005.
