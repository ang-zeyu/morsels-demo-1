One of  his friends asked him why he was publishing nothing. 'Hannibal's  elephants,' he replied, 'never could learn the goose-step.'    Newman was now an old man--he was sixty-three years of age. What had he  to look forward to? A few last years of insignificance and silence. What  had he to look back upon? A long chronicle of wasted efforts,  disappointed hopes, neglected possibilities, unappreciated powers. And  now all his labours had ended by his being accused at Rome of lack of  orthodoxy. He could no longer restrain his indignation, and in a letter  to one of his lady penitents, he gave vent to the bitterness of his  soul. When his Rambler article had been complained of, he said, there  had been some talk of calling him to Rome.    'Call me to Rome,' he burst out--'what does that mean? It means to sever  an old man from his home, to subject him to intercourse with persons  whose languages are strange to him--to food and to fashions which are  almost starvation on the one hand, and involve restless days and nights  on the other--it means to oblige him to dance attendance on Propaganda  week after week and month after month--it means his death. (It was the  punishment on Dr. Baines, 1840-1, to keep him at the door of Propaganda  for a year.)    'This is the prospect which I cannot but feel probable, did I say  anything which one Bishop in England chose to speak against and report.  Others have been killed before me. Lucas went of his own accord  indeed--but when he got there, oh!' How much did he, as loyal a son of  the Church and the Holy See as ever was, what did he suffer because Dr.  Cullen was against him? He wandered (as Dr. Cullen said in a letter he  published in a sort of triumph), he wandered from Church to Church  without a friend, and hardly got an audience from the Pope. 'And I too  should go from St. Philip to Our Lady, and to St. Peter and St. Paul,  and to St. Laurence and to St. Cecilia, and, if it happened to me as to  Lucas, should come back to die.'    Yet, in spite of all, in spite of these exasperations of the flesh,  these agitations of the spirit, what was there to regret? Had he not a  mysterious consolation which outweighed every grief? Surely, surely, he  had.        'Unveil, O Lord, and on us shine,          In glory and in grace,'    he exclaims in a poem written at this time, called 'The Two Worlds':        'This gaudy world grows pale before         The beauty of Thy face.        'Till Thou art seen it seems to he         A sort of fairy ground,      Where suns unsetting light the sky,         And flowers and fruit abound.        'But when Thy keener, purer beam         Is poured upon our sight,      It loses all its power to charm,         And what was day is night ...        'And thus, when we renounce for Thee         Its restless aims and fears,      The tender memories of the past,         The hopes of coming years,        'Poor is our sacrifice, whose eyes         Are lighted from above;      We offer what we cannot keep,         What we have ceased to love.'    Such were Newman's thoughts when an unexpected event occurred which  produced a profound effect upon his life: Charles Kingsley attacked his  good faith, and the good faith of Catholics in general, in a magazine  article. Newman protested, and Kingsley rejoined in an irate pamphlet.  Newman's reply was the Apologia pro Vita Sua, which he wrote in seven  weeks, sometimes working twenty-two hours at a stretch, 'constantly in  tears, and constantly crying out with distress'. The success of the  book, with its transparent candour, its controversial brilliance, the  sweep and passion of its rhetoric, the depth of its personal feeling,  was immediate and overwhelming; it was recognised at once as a classic,  not only by Catholics, but by the whole English world. From every side  expressions of admiration, gratitude, and devotion poured in. It was  impossible for one so sensitive as Newman to the opinions of other  people to resist the happy influence of such an unlooked-for, such an  enormous triumph. The cloud of his dejection began to lift; et l'espoir  malgre lui s'est glisse dans son coeur.    It was only natural that at such a moment his thoughts should return to  Oxford. For some years past proposals had been on foot for establishing  there a Hall, under Newman's leadership, for Catholic undergraduates.  The scheme had been looked upon with disfavour in Rome, and it had been  abandoned; but now a new opportunity presented itself--some land in a  suitable position came into the market. Newman, with his reviving  spirits, felt that he could not let this chance go by, and bought the  land. It was his intention to build there not a Hall, but a Church, and  to set on foot a 'House of the Oratory'. What possible objection could  there be to such a scheme? He approached the Bishop of Birmingham, who  gave his approval; in Rome itself there was no hostile sign. The laity  were enthusiastic and subscriptions began to flow in. Was it possible  that all was well at last? Was it conceivable that the strange and weary  pilgrimage of so many years should end at length in quietude, if not in  happiness, where it had begun?    It so happened that it was at this very time that Manning was appointed  to the See of Westminster. The destinies of the two men, which had run  parallel to one another in so strange a fashion and for so many years,  were now for a moment suddenly to converge. Newly clothed with all the  attributes of ecclesiastical supremacy, Manning found himself face to  face with Newman, upon whose brows were glittering the fresh laurels of  spiritual victory--the crown of an apostolical life. It was the meeting  of the eagle and the dove. What followed showed, more clearly perhaps  than any other incident in his career, the stuff that Manning was made  of. Power had come to him at last; and he seized it with all the avidity  of a born autocrat, whose appetite for supreme dominion had been whetted  by long years of enforced abstinence and the hated simulations of  submission. He was the ruler of Roman Catholic England, and he would  rule. The nature of Newman's influence it was impossible for him to  understand, but he saw that it existed; for twenty years he had been  unable to escape the unwelcome iterations of that singular, that alien,  that rival renown; and now it stood in his path, alone and inexplicable,  like a defiant ghost. 'It is remarkably interesting,' he observed  coldly, when somebody asked him what he thought of the Apologia: 'it is  like listening to the voice of one from the dead.' And such voices, with  their sepulchral echoes, are apt to be more dangerous than living ones;  they attract too much attention; they must be silenced at all costs. It  was the meeting of the eagle and the dove; there was a hovering, a  swoop, and then the quick beak and the relentless talons did their work.    Even before his accession to the Archbishopric, Manning had scented a  peculiar peril in Newman's Oxford scheme, and so soon as he came into  power, he privately determined that the author of the Apologia should  never be allowed to return to his old University. Nor was there any lack  of excellent reasons for such a decision. Oxford was by this time a nest  of liberalism; it was no fit place for Catholic youths, and they would  inevitably be attracted there by the presence of Father Newman. And  then, had not Father Newman's orthodoxy been impugned? Had he not been  heard to express opinions of most doubtful propriety upon the question  of the Temporal Power? Was it not known that he might almost be said to  have an independent mind? An influence? Yes, he had an influence no  doubt; but what a fatal kind of influence to which to subject the rising  generation of Catholic Englishmen!    Such were the reflections which Manning was careful to pour into the  receptive car of Monsignor Talbot. That useful priest, at his post of  vantage in the Vatican, was more than ever the devoted servant of the  new Archbishop. A league, offensive and defensive, had been established  between the two friends.    'I daresay I shall have many opportunities to serve you in Rome,' wrote  Monsignor Talbot modestly, 'and I do not think any support will be  useless to you, especially on account of the peculiar character of the  Pope, and the spirit which pervades Propaganda; therefore, I wish you to  understand that a compact exists between us; if you help me, I shall  help you.' And a little later he added, 'I am glad you accept the  league. As I have already done for years, I shall support you, and I  have a hundred ways of doing so. A word dropped at the proper occasion  works wonders.'    Perhaps it was hardly necessary to remind his correspondent of that.    So far as Newman was concerned, it so fell out that Monsignor Talbot  needed no prompting. During the sensation caused by the appearance of  the Apologia, it had occurred to him that it would be an excellent plan  to secure Newman as a preacher during Lent for the fashionable  congregation which attended his church in the Piazza del Popolo; and, he  had accordingly written to invite him to Rome. His letter was  unfortunately not a tactful one. He assured Newman that he would find in  the Piazza del Popolo 'an audience of Protestants more educated than  could ever be the case in England', and 'I think myself,' he had added  by way of extra inducement, 'that you will derive great benefit from  visiting Rome, and showing yourself to the Ecclesiastical Authorities.'  Newman smiled grimly at this; he declared to a friend that the letter  was 'insolent'; and he could not resist the temptation of using his  sharp pen.    'Dear Monsignor Talbot,' he wrote in reply, 'I have received your  letter, inviting me to preach in your Church at Rome to an audience of  Protestants more educated than could ever be the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2449"],[0,"The Common Law (#15)"],[1,"trees off, which is not reason, for perhaps he has corn or other  crops growing, &c., and no more here, for the law is all one in  great things and small.... Choke, C. J. to the same intent, for  when the principal thing was not lawful, that which depends upon  it was not lawful; for when he cut the thorns and they fell on my  land, [87] this falling was not lawful, and therefore his coming  to take them out was not lawful. As to what was said about their  falling in ipso invito, that is no plea, but he ought to show  that he could not do it in any other way, or that he did all that  was in his power to keep them out.\"    Forty years later, /1/ the Year Books report Rede, J. as adopting  the argument of Fairfax in the last case. In trespass, he says,  \"the intent cannot be construed; but in felony it shall be. As  when a man shoots at butts and kills a man, it is not felony et  il ser come n'avoit l'entent de luy tuer; and so of a tiler on a  house who with a stone kills a man unwittingly, it is not felony.  /2/ But when a man shoots at the butts and wounds a man, though  it is against his will, he shall be called a trespasser against  his intent.\"    There is a series of later shooting cases, Weaver v. Ward, /3/  Dickenson v. Watson, /4/ and Underwood v. Hewson, /5/ followed by  the Court of Appeals of New York in Castle v. Duryee, /6/ in  which defences to the effect that the damage was done  accidentally and by misfortune, and against the will of the  defendant, were held insufficient.    In the reign of Queen Elizabeth it was held that where a man with  a gun at the door of his house shot at a fowl, and thereby set  fire to his own house and to the house of his neighbor, he was  liable in an action on the case generally, the declaration not  being on the custom of the realm, [88] \"viz. for negligently  keeping his fire.\" \"For the injury is the same, although this  mischance was not by a common negligence, but by misadventure.\"  /1/    The above-mentioned instances of the stick and shooting at butts  became standard illustrations; they are repeated by Sir Thomas  Raymond, in Bessey v. Olliot, /2/ by Sir William Blackstone, in  the famous squib case, /3/ and by other judges, and have become  familiar through the textbooks. Sir T. Raymond, in the above  case, also repeats the thought and almost the words of Littleton,  J., which have been quoted, and says further: \"In all civil acts  the law doth not so much regard the intent of the actor, as the  loss and damage of the party suffering.\" Sir William Blackstone  also adopts a phrase from Dickenson v. Watson, just cited:  \"Nothing but inevitable necessity\" is a justification. So Lord  Ellenborough, in Leame v. Bray: /4/ \"If the injury were received  from the personal act of another, it was deemed sufficient to  make it trespass\"; or, according to the more frequently quoted  language of Grose, J., in the same case: \"Looking into all the  cases from the Year Book in the 21 H. VII. down to the latest  decision on the subject, I find the principle to be, that if the  injury be done by the act of the party himself at the time, or he  be the immediate cause of it, though it happen accidentally or by  misfortune, yet he is answerable in trespass.\" Further citations  are deemed unnecessary.    In spite, however, of all the arguments which may be [89] urged  for the rule that a man acts at his peril, it has been rejected  by very eminent courts, even under the old forms of action. In  view of this fact, and of the further circumstance that, since  the old forms have been abolished, the allegation of negligence  has spread from the action on the case to all ordinary  declarations in tort which do not allege intent, probably many  lawyers would be surprised that any one should think it worth  while to go into the present discussion. Such is the natural  impression to be derived from daily practice. But even if the  doctrine under consideration had no longer any followers, which  is not the case, it would be well to have something more than  daily practice to sustain our views upon so fundamental a  question; as it seems to me at least, the true principle is far  from being articulately grasped by all who are interested in it,  and can only be arrived at after a careful analysis of what has  been thought hitherto. It might be thought enough to cite the  decisions opposed to the rule of absolute responsibility, and to  show that such a rule is inconsistent with admitted doctrines and  sound policy. But we may go further with profit, and inquire  whether there are not strong grounds for thinking that the common  law has never known such a rule, unless in that period of dry  precedent which is so often to be found midway between a creative  epoch and a period of solvent philosophical reaction.  Conciliating the attention of those who, contrary to most modern  practitioners, still adhere to the strict doctrine, by reminding  them once more that there are weighty decisions to be cited  adverse to it, and that, if they have involved an innovation, the  fact that it has been made by such magistrates as Chief Justice  Shaw goes far to prove that the change was politic, I [90] think  I may assert that a little reflection will show that it was  required not only by policy, but by consistency. I will begin  with the latter.    The same reasoning which would make a man answerable in trespass  for all damage to another by force directly resulting from his  own act, irrespective of negligence or intent, would make him  answerable in case for the like damage similarly resulting from  the act of his servant, in the course of the latter's employment.  The discussions of the company's negligence in many railway cases  would therefore be wholly out of place, for although, to be sure,  there is a contract which would make the company liable for  negligence, that contract cannot be taken to diminish any  liability which would otherwise exist for a trespass on the part  of its employees.    More than this, the same reasoning would make a defendant  responsible for all damage, however remote, of which his act  could be called the cause. So long, at least, as only physical or  irresponsible agencies, however unforeseen, co-operated with the  act complained of to produce the result, the argument which would  resolve the case of accidentally striking the plaintiff, when  lifting a stick in necessary self-defence, adversely to the  defendant, would require a decision against him in every case  where his act was a factor in the result complained of. The  distinction between a direct application of force, and causing  damage indirectly, or as a more remote consequence of one's act,  although it may determine whether the form of action should be  trespass or case, does not touch the theory of responsibility, if  that theory be that a man acts at his peril.    [91] As was said at the outset, if the strict liability is to be  maintained at all, it must be maintained throughout. A principle  cannot be stated which would retain the strict liability in  trespass while abandoning it in case. It cannot be said that  trespass is for acts alone, and case for consequences of those  acts. All actions of trespass are for consequences of acts, not  for the acts themselves. And some actions of trespass are for  consequences more remote from the defendant's act than in other  instances where the remedy would be case.    An act is always a voluntary muscular contraction, and nothing  else. The chain of physical sequences which it sets in motion or  directs to the plaintiff's harm is no part of it, and very  generally a long train of such sequences intervenes. An example  or two will make this extremely clear.    When a man commits an assault and battery with a pistol, his only  act is to contract the muscles of his arm and forefinger in a  certain way, but it is the delight of elementary writers to point  out what a vast series of physical changes must take place before  the harm is done. Suppose that, instead of firing a pistol, he  takes up a hose which is discharging water on the sidewalk, and  directs it at the plaintiff, he does not even set in motion the  physical causes which must co-operate with his act to make a  battery. Not only natural causes, but a living being, may  intervene between the act and its effect. Gibbons v. Pepper, /1/  which decided that there was no battery when a man's horse was  frightened by accident or a third person and ran away with him,  and ran over the plaintiff, takes the distinction that, if the  rider by spurring is the cause of [92] the accident, then he is  guilty. In Scott v. Shepherd, /1/ already mentioned, trespass was  maintained against one who had thrown a squib into a crowd, where  it was tossed from hand to hand in self-defence until it burst  and injured the plaintiff. Here even human agencies were a part  of the chain between the defendant's act and the result, although  they were treated as more or less nearly automatic, in order to  arrive at the decision.    Now I repeat, that, if principle requires us to charge a man in  trespass when his act has brought force to bear on another  through a comparatively short train of intervening causes, in  spite of his having used all possible care, it requires the same  liability, however numerous and unexpected the events between the  act and the result. If running a man down is a trespass when the  accident can be referred to the rider's act of spurring, why is  it not a tort in every case, as was argued in Vincent v.  Stinehour, /2/ seeing that it can always be referred more  remotely to his act of mounting and taking the horse out?    Why is a man not responsible for the consequences of an act  innocent in its direct and obvious effects, when those  consequences would not have followed but for the intervention of  a series of extraordinary, although natural, events? The reason  is, that, if the intervening events are "]]]
