Despite its    abundant natural resources, output per capita is among the world's    lowest. Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for 85%    of the population. Oil production and the supporting activities are    vital to the economy, contributing about 45% to GDP. Notwithstanding    the signing of a peace accord in November 1994, sporadic violence    continues, millions of land mines remain, and many farmers are    reluctant to return to their fields. As a result, much of the    country's food must still be imported. To take advantage of its rich    resources--gold, diamonds, extensive forests, Atlantic fisheries,    arable land, and large oil deposits--Angola will need to implement    the peace agreement and reform government policies. The increase in    the pace of civil warfare in late 1998 dims economic prospects for    1999 especially if the oil sector were to be damaged.
