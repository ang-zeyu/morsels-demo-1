[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2848"],[0,"Antiquities of the Jews (#15)"],[1,"Jacob the younger was  best beloved by his mother.    2. When there was a famine in the land, Isaac resolved to go into Egypt,  the land there being good; but he went to Gerar, as God commanded him.  Here Abimelech the king received him, because Abraham had formerly lived  with him, and had been his friend. And as in the beginning he treated  him exceeding kindly, so he was hindered from continuing in the same  disposition to the end, by his envy at him; for when he saw that God was  with Isaac, and took such great care of him, he drove him away from him.  But Isaac, when he saw how envy had changed the temper of Abimelech  retired to a place called the Valley, not far from Gerar: and as he was  digging a well, the shepherds fell upon him, and began to fight, in  order to hinder the work; and because he did not desire to contend, the  shepherds seemed to get the him, so he still retired, and dug another  and when certain other shepherds of Abimelech began to offer him  violence, he left that also, still retired, thus purchasing security to  himself a rational and prudent conduct. At length they gave him leave to  dig a well without disturbance. He named this well Rehoboth, which  denotes a large space; but of the former wells, one was called Escon,  which denotes strife, the other Sitenna, name signifies enmity.    3. It was now that Isaac's affairs increased, and in a flourishing  condition; and this his great riches. But Abimelech, thinking in  opposition to him, while their living made them suspicious of each  other, and retiring showing a secret enmity also, he afraid that his  former friendship with Isaac would not secure him, if Isaac should  endeavor the injuries he had formerly offered him; he therefore renewed  his friendship with him, Philoc, one of his generals. And when he had  obtained every thing he desired, by reason of Isaac's good nature, who  preferred the earlier friendship Abimelech had shown to himself and his  father to his later wrath against him, he returned home.    4. Now when Esau, one of the sons of Isaac, whom the father principally  loved, was now come to the age of forty years, he married Adah, the  daughter of Helon, and Aholibamah, the daughter of Esebeon; which Helon  and Esebeon were great lords among the Canaanites: thereby taking upon  himself the authority, and pretending to have dominion over his own  marriages, without so much as asking the advice of his father; for had  Isaac been the arbitrator, he had not given him leave to marry thus, for  he was not pleased with contracting any alliance with the people of that  country; but not caring to be uneasy to his son by commanding him to put  away these wives, he resolved to be silent.    5. But when he was old, and could not see at all, he called Esau to him,  and told him, that besides his blindness, and the disorder of his eyes,  his very old age hindered him from his worship of God [by sacrifice]; he  bid him therefore to go out a hunting, and when he had caught as much  venison as he could, to prepare him a supper 32 that after this he might  make supplication to God, to be to him a supporter and an assister  during the whole time of his life; saying, that it was uncertain when he  should die, and that he was desirous, by prayers for him, to procure,  beforehand, God to be merciful to him.    6. Accordingly, Esau went out a hunting. But Rebeka 33 thinking it  proper to have the supplication made for obtaining the favor of God to  Jacob, and that without the consent of Isaac, bid him kill kids of the  goats, and prepare a supper. So Jacob obeyed his mother, according to  all her instructions. Now when the supper was got ready, he took a  goat's skin, and put it about his arm, that by reason of its hairy  roughness, he might by his father be believed to be Esau; for they being  twins, and in all things else alike, differed only in this thing. This  was done out of his fear, that before his father had made his  supplications, he should be caught in his evil practice, and lest he  should, on the contrary, provoke his father to curse him. So he brought  in the supper to his father. Isaac perceivest to be Esau. So suspecting  no deceit, he ate the supper, and betook himself to his prayers and  intercessions with God; and said, \"O Lord of all ages, and Creator of  all substance; for it was thou that didst propose to my father great  plenty of good things, and hast vouchsafed to bestow on me what I have;  and hast promised to my posterity to be their kind supporter, and to  bestow on them still greater blessings; do thou therefore confirm these  thy promises, and do not overlook me, because of my present weak  condition, on account of which I most earnestly pray to thee. Be  gracious to this my son; and preserve him and keep him from every thing  that is evil. Give him a happy life, and the possession of as many good  things as thy power is able to bestow. Make him terrible to his enemies,  and honorable and beloved among his friends.\"    7. Thus did Isaac pray to God, thinking his prayers had been made for  Esau. He had but just finished them, when Esau came in from hunting. And  when Isaac perceived his mistake, he was silent: but Esau required that  he might be made partaker of the like blessing from his father that his  brother had partook of; but his father refused it, because all his  prayers had been spent upon Jacob: so Esau lamented the mistake.  However, his father being grieved at his weeping, said, that \"he should  excel in hunting and strength of body, in arms, and all such sorts of  work; and should obtain glory for ever on those accounts, he and his  posterity after him; but still should serve his brother.\"    8. Now the mother delivered Jacob, when she was afraid that his brother  would inflict some punishment upon him because of the mistake about the  prayers of Isaac; for she persuaded her husband to take a wife for Jacob  out of Mesopotamia, of her own kindred, Esau having married already  Basemmath, the daughter of Ismael, without his father's consent; for  Isaac did not like the Canaanites, so that he disapproved of Esau's  former marriages, which made him take Basemmath to wife, in order to  please him; and indeed he had a great affection for her.              CHAPTER 19. Concerning Jacob's Flight Into Mesopotamia, By Reason Of The  Fear He Was In Of His Brother.    1. Now Jacob was sent by his mother to Mesopotamia, in order to marry  Laban her brother's daughter [which marriage was permitted by Isaac, on  account of his obsequiousness to the desires of his wife]; and he  accordingly journeyed through the land of Canaan; and because he hated  the people of that country, he would not lodge with any of them, but  took up his lodging in the open air, and laid his head on a heap of  stones that he had gathered together. At which time he saw in his sleep  such a vision standing by him:he seemed to see a ladder that reached  from the earth unto heaven, and persons descending upon the ladder that  seemed more excellent than human; and at last God himself stood above  it, and was plainly visible to him, who, calling him by his name, spake  to him in these words:    2. \"O Jacob, it is not fit for thee, who art the son of a good father,  and grandson of one who had obtained a great reputation for his eminent  virtue, to be dejected at thy present circumstances, but to hope for  better times, for thou shalt have great abundance of all good things, by  my assistance: for I brought Abraham hither, out of Mesopotamia, when he  was driven away by his kinsmen, and I made thy father a happy man, nor  will I bestow a lesser degree of happiness on thyself: be of good  courage, therefore, and under my conduct proceed on this thy journey,  for the marriage thou goest so zealously about shall be consummated. And  thou shalt have children of good characters, but their multitude shall  be innumerable; and they shall leave what they have to a still more  numerous posterity, to whom, and to whose posterity, I give the dominion  of all the land, and their posterity shall fill the entire earth and  sea, so far as the sun beholds them: but do not thou fear any danger,  nor be afraid of the many labors thou must undergo, for by my providence  I will direct thee what thou art to do in the time present, and still  much more in the time to come.\"    3. Such were the predictions which God made to Jacob; whereupon he  became very joyful at what he had seen and heard; and he poured oil on  the stones, because on them the prediction of such great benefits was  made. He also vowed a vow, that he would offer sacrifices upon them, if  he lived and returned safe; and if he came again in such a condition, he  would give the tithe of what he had gotten to God. He also judged the  place to be honorable and gave it the name of Bethel, which, in the  Greek, is interpreted, The House of God.    4. So he proceeded on his journey to Mesopotamia, and at length came to  Haran; and meeting with shepherds in the suburbs, with boys grown up,  and maidens sitting about a certain well, he staid with them, as wanting  water to drink; and beginning to discourse with them, he asked them  whether they knew such a one as Laban, and whether he was still alive.  Now they all said they knew him, for he was not so inconsiderable a  person as to be unknown to any of them; and that his daughter fed her  father's flock together with them; and that indeed they wondered that  she was not yet come, for by her means thou mightest learn more exactly  whatever thou desirest to know about that family. While they were saying  this the damsel came, and the other shepherds that came down along with  her. Then they showed her Jacob, and told her that he was a stranger,  who came to inquire about her father's affairs. But she, as pleased,  after the custom of children, with Jacob's coming, asked him who he was,  and whence he came to them, and what it was he lacked that he came "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2849"],[0,"Against Apion (#15)"],[1," to her nearest relations and husbands who had loved her, and, indeed, in  general with regard to all the Romans, and those emperors that were her  benefactors; who also had her sister Arsinoe slain in a temple, when  she had done her no harm: moreover, she had her brother slain by private  treachery, and she destroyed the gods of her country and the sepulchers  of her progenitors; and while she had received her kingdom from the  first Caesar, she had the impudence to rebel against his son: [7] and  successor; nay, she corrupted Antony with her love-tricks, and rendered  him an enemy to his country, and made him treacherous to his friends,  and [by his means] despoiled some of their royal authority, and forced  others in her madness to act wickedly. But what need I enlarge upon this  head any further, when she left Antony in his fight at sea, though he  were her husband, and the father of their common children, and compelled  him to resign up his government, with the army, and to follow her [into  Egypt]? nay, when last of all Caesar had taken Alexandria, she came to  that pitch of cruelty, that she declared she had some hope of preserving  her affairs still, in case she could kill the Jews, though it were with  her own hand; to such a degree of barbarity and perfidiousness had she  arrived. And doth any one think that we cannot boast ourselves of  any thing, if, as Apion says, this queen did not at a time of famine  distribute wheat among us? However, she at length met with the  punishment she deserved. As for us Jews, we appeal to the great Caesar  what assistance we brought him, and what fidelity we showed to him  against the Egyptians; as also to the senate and its decrees, and the  epistles of Augustus Caesar, whereby our merits [to the Romans] are  justified. Apion ought to have looked upon those epistles, and in  particular to have examined the testimonies given on our behalf, under  Alexander and all the Ptolemies, and the decrees of the senate and of  the greatest Roman emperors. And if Germanicus was not able to make a  distribution of corn to all the inhabitants of Alexandria, that only  shows what a barren time it was, and how great a want there was then of  corn, but tends nothing to the accusation of the Jews; for what all the  emperors have thought of the Alexandrian Jews is well known, for this  distribution of wheat was no otherwise omitted with regard to the Jews,  than it was with regard to the other inhabitants of Alexandria. But they  still were desirous to preserve what the kings had formerly intrusted to  their care, I mean the custody of the river; nor did those kings think  them unworthy of having the entire custody thereof, upon all occasions.    6. But besides this, Apion objects to us thus: \"If the Jews [says he] be  citizens of Alexandria, why do they not worship the same gods with the  Alexandrians?\" To which I give this answer: Since you are yourselves  Egyptians, why do you fight it out one against another, and have  implacable wars about your religion? At this rate we must not call you  all Egyptians, nor indeed in general men, because you breed up with  great care beasts of a nature quite contrary to that of men, although  the nature of all men seems to be one and the same. Now if there be such  differences in opinion among you Egyptians, why are you surprised that  those who came to Alexandria from another country, and had original laws  of their own before, should persevere in the observance of those laws?  But still he charges us with being the authors of sedition; which  accusation, if it be a just one, why is it not laid against us all,  since we are known to be all of one mind. Moreover, those that search  into such matters will soon discover that the authors of sedition have  been such citizens of Alexandria as Apion is; for while they were the  Grecians and Macedonians who were ill possession of this city, there  was no sedition raised against us, and we were permitted to observe our  ancient solemnities; but when the number of the Egyptians therein came  to be considerable, the times grew confused, and then these seditions  brake out still more and more, while our people continued uncorrupted.  These Egyptians, therefore, were the authors of these troubles, who  having not the constancy of Macedonians, nor the prudence of Grecians,  indulged all of them the evil manners of the Egyptians, and continued  their ancient hatred against us; for what is here so presumptuously  charged upon us, is owing to the differences that are amongst  themselves; while many of them have not obtained the privileges of  citizens in proper times, but style those who are well known to have  had that privilege extended to them all no other than foreigners: for it  does not appear that any of the kings have ever formerly bestowed those  privileges of citizens upon Egyptians, no more than have the emperors  done it more lately; while it was Alexander who introduced us into  this city at first, the kings augmented our privileges therein, and the  Romans have been pleased to preserve them always inviolable. Moreover,  Apion would lay a blot upon us, because we do not erect images for our  emperors; as if those emperors did not know this before, or stood in  need of Apion as their defender; whereas he ought rather to have admired  the magnanimity and modesty of the Romans, whereby they do not  compel those that are subject to them to transgress the laws of their  countries, but are willing to receive the honors due to them after such  a manner as those who are to pay them esteem consistent with piety and  with their own laws; for they do not thank people for conferring honors  upon them, When they are compelled by violence so to do. Accordingly,  since the Grecians and some other nations think it a right thing to make  images, nay, when they have painted the pictures of their parents, and  wives, and children, they exult for joy; and some there are who take  pictures for themselves of such persons as were no way related to them;  nay, some take the pictures of such servants as they were fond of;  what wonder is it then if such as these appear willing to pay the  same respect to their princes and lords? But then our legislator hath  forbidden us to make images, not by way of denunciation beforehand, that  the Roman authority was not to be honored, but as despising a thing that  was neither necessary nor useful for either God or man; and he forbade  them, as we shall prove hereafter, to make these images for any part of  the animal creation, and much less for God himself, who is no part of  such animal creation. Yet hath our legislator no where forbidden us to  pay honors to worthy men, provided they be of another kind, and inferior  to those we pay to God; with which honors we willingly testify our  respect to our emperors, and to the people of Rome; we also offer  perpetual sacrifices for them; nor do we only offer them every day at  the common expenses of all the Jews, but although we offer no other such  sacrifices out of our common expenses, no, not for our own children, yet  do we this as a peculiar honor to the emperors, and to them alone, while  we do the same to no other person whomsoever. And let this suffice for  an answer in general to Apion, as to what he says with relation to the  Alexandrian Jews.    7. However, I cannot but admire those other authors who furnished this  man with such his materials; I mean Possidonius and Apollonius [the son  of] Molo, [8] who, while they accuse us for not worshipping the same  gods whom others worship, they think themselves not guilty of impiety  when they tell lies of us, and frame absurd and reproachful stories  about our temple; whereas it is a most shameful thing for freemen to  forge lies on any occasion, and much more so to forge them about our  temple, which was so famous over all the world, and was preserved so  sacred by us; for Apion hath the impudence to pretend that, \"the Jews  placed an ass's head in their holy place;\" and he affirms that this was  discovered when Antiochus Epiphanes spoiled our temple, and found that  ass's head there made of gold, and worth a great deal of money. To this  my first answer shall be this, that had there been any such thing among  us, an Egyptian ought by no means to have thrown it in our teeth, since  an ass is not a more contemptible animal than [9] and goats, and other  such creatures, which among them are gods. But besides this answer, I  say further, how comes it about that Apion does not understand this to  be no other than a palpable lie, and to be confuted by the thing itself  as utterly incredible? For we Jews are always governed by the same laws,  in which we constantly persevere; and although many misfortunes have  befallen our city, as the like have befallen others, and although Theos  [Epiphanes], and Pompey the Great, and Licinius Crassus, and last of  all Titus Caesar, have conquered us in war, and gotten possession of  our temple; yet have they none of them found any such thing there, nor  indeed any thing but what was agreeable to the strictest piety; although  what they found we are not at liberty to reveal to other nations. But  for Antiochus [Epiphanes], he had no just cause for that ravage in our  temple that he made; he only came to it when he wanted money, without  declaring himself our enemy, and attacked us while we were his  associates and his friends; nor did he find any thing there that  was ridiculous. This is attested by many worthy writers; Polybius of  Megalopolis, Strabo of Cappadocia, Nicolaus of Damascus, Timagenes,  Castor the chronotoger, and Apollodorus; [10] who all say that it was  out of Antiochus's want of money that he broke his league with the Jews,  and despoiled their temple when it was full of gold and silver. Apion  ought to have had a regard to these facts, unless he had himself had  either an ass's heart or a dog's impudence; of such a dog I mean as they  "]]]
