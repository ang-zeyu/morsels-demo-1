If the moon were suddenly struck out of existence, we should be  immediately apprised of the fact by a wail from every seaport in the  kingdom. From London and from Liverpool we should hear the same  story--the rise and fall of the tide had almost ceased. The ships in  dock could not get out; the ships outside could not get in; and the  maritime commerce of the world would be thrown into dire confusion.    The moon is the principal agent in causing the daily ebb and flow of the  tide, and this is the most important work which our satellite has to do.  The fleets of fishing boats around the coasts time their daily movements  by the tide, and are largely indebted to the moon for bringing them in  and out of harbour. Experienced sailors assure us that the tides are of  the utmost service to navigation. The question as to how the moon causes  the tides is postponed to a future chapter, in which we shall also  sketch the marvellous part which the tides seem to have played in the  early history of our earth.    Who is there that has not watched, with admiration, the beautiful series  of changes through which the moon passes every month? We first see her  as an exquisite crescent of pale light in the western sky after sunset.  If the night is fine, the rest of the moon is visible inside the  crescent, being faintly illumined by light reflected from our own earth.  Night after night she moves further and further to the east, until she  becomes full, and rises about the same time that the sun sets. From the  time of the full the disc of light begins to diminish until the last  quarter is reached. Then it is that the moon is seen high in the heavens  in the morning. As the days pass by, the crescent shape is again  assumed. The crescent wanes thinner and thinner as the satellite draws  closer to the sun. Finally she becomes lost in the overpowering light of  the sun, again to emerge as the new moon, and again to go through the  same cycle of changes.    The brilliance of the moon arises solely from the light of the sun,  which falls on the not self-luminous substance of the moon. Out of the  vast flood of light which the sun pours forth with such prodigality into  space the dark body of the moon intercepts a little, and of that little  it reflects a small fraction to illuminate the earth. The moon sheds so  much light, and seems so bright, that it is often difficult at night to  remember that the moon has no light except what falls on it from the  sun. Nevertheless, the actual surface of the brightest full moon is  perhaps not much brighter than the streets of London on a clear sunshiny  day. A very simple observation will suffice to show that the moon's  light is only sunlight. Look some morning at the moon in daylight, and  compare the moon with the clouds. The brightness of the moon and of the  clouds are directly comparable, and then it can be readily comprehended  how the sun which illuminates the clouds has also illumined the moon. An  attempt has been made to form a comparative estimate of the brightness  of the sun and the full moon. If 600,000 full moons were shining at  once, their collective brilliancy would equal that of the sun.    The beautiful crescent moon has furnished a theme for many a poet.  Indeed, if we may venture to say so, it would seem that some poets have  forgotten that the moon is not to be seen every night. A poetical  description of evening is almost certain to be associated with the  appearance of the moon in some phase or other. We may cite one notable  instance in which a poet, describing an historical event, has enshrined  in exquisite verse a statement which cannot be correct. Every child who  speaks our language has been taught that the burial of Sir John Moore  took place      \"By the struggling moonbeams' misty light.\"    There is an appearance of detail in this statement which wears the garb  of truth. We are not inclined to doubt that the night was misty, nor as  to whether the moonbeams had to struggle into visibility; the question  at issue is a much more fundamental one. We do not know who was the  first to raise the point as to whether any moon shone on that memorable  event at all or not; but the question having been raised, the Nautical  Almanac immediately supplies an answer. From it we learn in language,  whose truthfulness constitutes its only claim to be poetry, that the  moon was new at one o'clock in the morning of the day of the battle of  Corunna (16th January, 1809). The ballad evidently implies that the  funeral took place on the night following the battle. We are therefore  assured that the moon can hardly have been a day old when the hero was  consigned to his grave. But the moon in such a case is practically  invisible, and yields no appreciable moonbeams at all, misty or  otherwise. Indeed, if the funeral took place at the \"dead of night,\" as  the poet asserts, then the moon must have been far below the horizon at  the time.[6]    In alluding to this and similar instances, Mr. Nasmyth gives a word of  advice to authors or to artists who desire to bring the moon on a scene  without knowing as a matter of fact that our satellite was actually  present. He recommends them to follow the example of Bottom in _A  Midsummer's Night's Dream_, and consult \"a calendar, a calendar! Look in  the almanac; find out moonshine, find out moonshine!\"    [Illustration: Fig. 23.--Comparative Sizes of the Earth and the Moon.]    Among the countless host of celestial bodies--the sun, the moon, the  planets, and the stars--our satellite enjoys one special claim on our  attention. The moon is our nearest permanent neighbour. It is just  possible that a comet may occasionally approach the earth more closely  than the moon but with this exception the other celestial bodies are all  many hundreds or thousands, or even many millions, of times further from  us than the moon.    It is also to be observed that the moon is one of the smallest visible  objects which the heavens contain. Every one of the thousands of stars  that can be seen with the unaided eye is enormously larger than our  satellite. The brilliance and apparent vast proportions of the moon  arise from the fact that it is only 240,000 miles away, which is a  distance almost immeasurably small when compared with the distances  between the earth and the stars.    Fig. 23 exhibits the relative sizes of the earth and its attendant. The  small globe shows the moon, while the larger globe represents the earth.  When we measure the actual diameters of the two globes, we find that of  the earth to be 7,918 miles and of the moon 2,160 miles, so that the  diameter of the earth is nearly four times greater than the diameter of  the moon. If the earth were cut into fifty pieces, all equally large,  then one of these pieces rolled into a globe would equal the size of the  moon. The superficial extent of the moon is equal to about one  thirteenth part of the surface of the earth. The hemisphere our  neighbour turns towards us exhibits an area equal to about one  twenty-seventh part of the area of the earth. This, to speak  approximately, is about double the actual extent of the continent of  Europe. The average materials of the earth are, however, much heavier  than those contained in the moon. It would take more than eighty globes,  each as ponderous as the moon, to weigh down the earth.    Amid the changes which the moon presents to us, one obvious fact stands  prominently forth. Whether our satellite be new or full, at first  quarter or at last, whether it be high in the heavens or low near the  horizon, whether it be in process of eclipse by the sun, or whether the  sun himself is being eclipsed by the moon, the apparent size of the  latter is nearly constant. We can express the matter numerically. A  globe one foot in diameter, at a distance of 111 feet from the observer,  would under ordinary circumstances be just sufficient to hide the disc  of the moon; occasionally, however, the globe would have to be brought  in to a distance of only 103 feet, or occasionally it might have to be  moved out to so much as 118 feet, if the moon is to be exactly hidden.  It is unusual for the moon to approach either of its extreme limits of  position, so that the distance from the eye at which the globe must be  situated so as to exactly cover the moon is usually more than 105 feet,  and less than 117 feet. These fluctuations in the apparent size of our  satellite are contained within such narrow limits that in the first  glance at the subject they may be overlooked. It will be easily seen  that the apparent size of the moon must be connected with its real  distance from the earth. Suppose, for the sake of illustration, that the  moon were to recede into space, its size would seem to dwindle, and long  ere it had reached the distance of even the very nearest of the other  celestial bodies it would have shrunk into insignificance. On the other  hand, if the moon were to come nearer to the earth, its apparent size  would gradually increase until, when close to our globe, it would seem  like a mighty continent stretching over the sky. We find that the  apparent size of the moon is nearly constant, and hence we infer that  the average distance of the same body is also nearly constant. The  average value of that distance is 239,000 miles. In rare circumstances  it may approach to a distance but little more than 221,000 miles, or  recede to a distance hardly less than 253,000 miles, but the ordinary  fluctuations do not exceed more than about 13,000 miles on either side  of its mean value.    From the moon's incessant changes we perceive that she is in constant  motion, and we now further see that whatever these movements may be, the  earth and the moon must at present remain at _nearly_ the same distance  apart. If we further add that the path pursued by the moon around the  heavens lies nearly in a plane, then we are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2743"],[0,"Massacres of the South (1551-1815) (#15)"],[1,"crime:    The daughter of Baron Meyrargues, who was not long married to a  gentleman named M. de Miraman, had set out on the 29th November for  Ambroix to join her husband, who was waiting for her there. She was  encouraged to do this by her coachman, who had often met with Camisards  in the neighbourhood, and although a Catholic, had never received any  harm from them. She occupied her own carriage, and was accompanied by a  maid, a nurse, a footman, and the coachman who had persuaded her to  undertake the journey. Two-thirds of the way already lay safely behind  them, when between Lussan and Vaudras she was stopped by four, men, who  made her get out of her carriage and accompany them into the  neighbouring forest. The account of what then happened is taken from the  deposition of the maid. We copy it word for word:    \"These wretches having forced us,\" says she, \"to walk into the forest  till we were at some distance from the high road, my poor mistress grew  so tired that she begged the man who walked beside her to allow her to  lean on his shoulder. He looking round and seeing that they had reached  a lonely spot, replied, 'We need hardly go any farther,' and made us sit  dawn on a plot of grass which was to be the scene of our martyrdom. My  poor mistress began to plead with the barbarians in the most touching  manner, and so sweetly that she would have softened the heart of a  demon. She offered them her purse, her gold waistband, and a fine  diamond which she drew from her finger; but nothing could move these  tigers, and one of them said, 'I am going to kill all the Catholics at  once, and shall be gin with you.' 'What will you gain by my death?'  asked my mistress. 'Spare my life.'--'No; shut up!' replied he. 'You  shall die by my hand. Say your prayers.' My good mistress threw herself  at once on her knees and prayed aloud that God would show mercy to her  and to her murderers, and while she was thus praying she received a  pistol-shot in her left breast, and fell; a second assassin cut her  across the face with his sword, and a third dropped a large stone on her  head, while the fourth killed the nurse with a shot from his pistol.  Whether it was that they had no more loaded firearms, or that they  wished to save their ammunition, they were satisfied with only giving me  several bayonet wounds. I pretended to be dead: they thought it was  really the case, and went away. Some time after, seeing that everything  had become quiet, and hearing no sound, I dragged myself, dying as I  was, to where my dear mistress lay, and called her. As it happened, she  was not quite dead, and she said in a faint voice, 'Stay with me, Suzon,  till I die.' She added, after a short pause, for she was hardly able to  speak, 'I die for my religion, and I hope that God will have pity on me.  Tell my husband that I confide our little one to his care.' Having said  this, she turned her thoughts from the world, praying to God in broken  and tender words, and drew her last breath as the night fell.\"    In obedience to Cavalier's orders, the four criminals were taken and  brought before him. He was then with his troops near Saint-Maurice de  Casevielle; he called a council of war, and having had the prisoners  tried for their atrocious deed, he summed up the evidence in as clear a  manner as any lawyer could have done, and called upon the judges to  pronounce sentence. All the judges agreed that the prisoners should be  put to death, but just as the sentence was made known one of the  assassins pushed aside the two men who guarded him, and jumping down a  rock, disappeared in the forest before any attempt could be made to stop  him. The three others were shot.    The Catholics also condemned many to be executed, but the trials  conducted by then were far from being as remarkable for honour and  justice as was that which we have just described. We may instance the  trial of a poor boy of fourteen, the son of a miller of Saint-Christol  who had been broken the wheel just a month before. For a moment the  judges hesitated to condemn so young a boy to death, but a witness  presented himself who testified that the little fellow was employed by  the fanatics to strangle Catholic children. Although no one believed the  evidence, yet it was seized-on as a pretext: the unfortunate boy was  condemned to death, and hanged without mercy an hour later.    A great many people from the parishes devastated by M. de Julien had  taken refuge in Aussilargues, in the parish of St. Andre. Driven by  hunger and misery, they went beyond the prescribed limits in search of  means of subsistence. Planque hearing of this, in his burning zeal for  the Catholic faith resolved not to leave such a crime unpunished. He  despatched a detachment of soldiers to arrest the culprits: the task was  easy, for they were all once more inside the barrier and in their beds.  They were seized, brought to St. Andre's Church and shut in; then,  without trial of any kind,--they were taken, five at a time, and  massacred: some were shot and some cut down with sword or axe; all were  killed without exception--old and young women and children. One of the  latter, who had received three shots was still able to raise his head  and cry, \"Where is father? Why doesn't he come and take me away.\"    Four men and a young girl who had taken refuge in the town of Lasalle,  one of the places granted to the houseless villagers as an asylum, asked  and received formal permission from the captain of the Soissonais  regiment, by name Laplace, to go home on important private business, on  condition that they returned the same night. They promised, and in the  intention of keeping this promise they all met on their way back at a  small farmhouse. Just as they reached it a terrible storm came on. The  men were for continuing their way in spite of the weather, but the young  girl besought them to wait till daylight, as she did not dare to venture  out in the dark during such a storm, and would die of fright if left  alone at the farm. The men, ashamed to desert their companion, who was  related to one of them, yielded to her entreaties and remained, hoping  that the storm would be a sufficient excuse for the delay. As soon as it  was light, the five resumed their journey. But the news of their crime  had reached the ears of Laplace before they got back. They were  arrested, and all their excuses were of no avail. Laplace ordered the  men to be taken outside the town and shot. The young girl was condemned  to be hanged; and the sentence was to be carried out that very day, but  some nuns who had been sent for to prepare her for death, having vainly  begged Laplace to show mercy, entreated the girl to declare that she  would soon become a mother. She indignantly refused to save her life at  the cost of her good name, so the nuns took the lie on themselves and  made the necessary declaration before the captain, begging him if he had  no pity for the mother to spare the child at least, by granting a  reprieve till it should be born. The captain was not for a moment  deceived, but he sent for a midwife and ordered her to examine the young  girl. At the end of half an hour she declared that the assertion of the  nuns was true.    \"Very well,\" said the captain: \"let them both be kept in prison for  three months; if by the end of that time the truth of this assertion is  not self-evident, both shall be hanged.\" When this decision was made  known to the poor woman, she was overcome by fear, and asked to see the,  captain again, to whom she confessed that, led away by the entreaties of  the nuns, she had told a lie.    Upon this, the woman was sentenced to be publicly whipped, and the young  girl hanged on a gibbet round which were placed the corpses of the four  men of whose death she was the cause.    As may easily be supposed, the \"Cadets of the Cross\" vied with both  Catholics and Protestants in the work of destruction. One of their bands  devoted itself to destroying everything belonging to the new converts  from Beaucaire to Nimes. They killed a woman and two children at  Campuget, an old man of eighty at a farm near Bouillargues, several  persons at Cicure, a young girl at Caissargues, a gardener at Nimes, and  many other persons, besides carrying off all the flocks, furniture, and  other property they could lay hands on, and burning down the farmhouses  of Clairan, Loubes, Marine, Carlot, Campoget Miraman, La Bergerie, and  Larnac--all near St. Gilies and Manduel. \"They stopped travellers on the  highways,\" says Louvreloeil, \"and by way of finding out whether they  were Catholic or not, made them say in Latin the Lord's Prayer, the Ave  Maria, the Symbol of the Faith, and the General Confession, and those  who were unable to do this were put to the sword. In Dions nine corpses  were found supposed to have been killed by their hands, and when the  body of a shepherd who had been in the service of the Sieur de  Roussiere, a former minister, was found hanging to a tree, no one  doubted who were the murderers. At last they went so far that one of  their bands meeting the Abbe de Saint Gilles on the road, ordered him to  deliver up to them one of his servants, a new convert, in order to put  him to death. It was in vain that the abbe remonstrated with them,  telling them it was a shame to put such an affront on a man of his birth  and rank; they persisted none the less in their determination, till at  last the abbe threw his arms round his servant and presented his own  body to the blows directed at the other.\"    The author of The Troubles in the Cevennes relates something surpassing  all this which took place at Montelus on the 22nd February \"There were a  few Protestants in the place,\" he says, \"but they were far outnumbered  by the Catholics; these being roused by a Capuchin from Bergerac, formed  themselves into a body of 'Cadets of the Cross,' and hastened to serve  their apprenticeship to the"]]]
