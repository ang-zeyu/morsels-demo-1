Be assured, Sir, I would not fear ten of the best of your name, at  each other's backs: all that I want is to have friends with us to see  fair play, for, if you close with me, you are a dead man.'    \"The other stormed at these words. 'You are a braggart, Sir,' cried he,  'a wretch--a blot on the cheek of nature--a blight on the Christian  world--a reprobate--I'll have your soul, Sir. You must play at tennis,  and put down elect brethren in another world to-morrow.' As he said  this, he brandished his rapier, exciting Dalcastle to offence. He  gained his point. The latter, who had previously drawn, advanced upon  his vapouring and licentious antagonist, and a fierce combat ensued. My  companion was delighted beyond measure, and I could not keep him from  exclaiming, loud enough to have been heard, 'That's grand! That's  excellent!' For me, my heart quaked like an aspen. Young Dalcastle  either had a decided advantage over his adversary, or else the other  thought proper to let him have it; for he shifted, and swore, and  flitted from Dalcastle's thrusts like a shadow, uttering ofttimes a  sarcastic laugh, that seemed to provoke the other beyond all bearing.  At one time, he would spring away to a great distance, then advance  again on young Dalcastle with the swiftness of lightning. But that  young hero always stood his ground, and repelled the attack: he never  gave way, although they fought nearly twice round the bleaching green,  which you know is not a very small one. At length they fought close up  to the mouth of the dark entry, where the fellow in black stood all  this while concealed, and then the combatant in tartans closed with his  antagonist, or pretended to do so; but, the moment they began to  grapple, he wheeled about, turning Colwan's back towards the entry, and  then cried out, 'Ah, hell has it! My friend, my friend!'    \"That moment the fellow in black rushed from his cover with his drawn  rapier, and gave the brave young Dalcastle two deadly wounds in the  back, as quick as arm could thrust, both of which I thought pierced  through his body. He fell, and, rolling himself on his back, he  perceived who it was that had slain him thus foully, and said, with a  dying emphasis, which I never heard equalled, 'oh, dog of hell, it is  you who has done this!'    \"He articulated some more, which I could not hear for other sounds;  for, the moment that the man in black inflicted the deadly wound, my  companion called out, 'That's unfair, you rip! That's damnable! to  strike a brave fellow behind! One at a time, you cowards!' etc., to all  which the unnatural fiend in the tartans answered with a loud exulting  laugh; and then, taking the poor paralysed murderer by the bow of the  arm, he hurried him in the dark entry once more, where I lost sight of  them for ever.\"    Before this time Mrs. Logan had risen up; and, when the narrator had  finished, she was standing with her arms stretched upwards at their  full length, and her visage turned down, on which were portrayed the  lines of the most absolute horror. \"The dark suspicions of my late  benefactor have been just, and his last prediction is fulfilled,\" cried  she. \"The murderer of the accomplished George Colwan has been his own  brother, set on, there is little doubt, by her who bare them both, and  her directing angel, the self-justified bigot. Aye, and yonder they  sit, enjoying the luxuries so dearly purchased, with perfect impunity!  If the Almighty do not hurl them down, blasted with shame and  confusion, there is no hope of retribution in this life. And, by His  might, I will be the agent to accomplish it! Why did the man not pursue  the foul murderers? Why did he not raise the alarm, and call the watch?\"    \"He? The wretch! He durst not move from the shelter he had obtained.  No, not for the soul of him. He was pursued for his life, at the moment  when he first flew into my arms. But I did not know it;  no, I did not  then know him. May the curse of heaven, and the blight of hell, settle  on the detestable wretch! He pursue for the sake of justice! No; his  efforts have all been for evil, but never for good. But I raised the  alarm; miserable and degraded as I was, I pursued and raised the watch  myself Have you not heard the name of Bell Calvert coupled with that  hideous and mysterious affair?\"    \"Yes, I have. In secret often I have heard it. But how came it that you  could never be found? How came it that you never appeared in defence of  the Honourable Thomas Drummond; you, the only person who could have  justified him?\"    \"I could not, for I then fell under the power and guidance of a wretch  who durst not for the soul of him be brought forward in the affair.  And, what was worse, his evidence would have overborne mine, for he  would have sworn that the man who called out and fought Colwan was the  same he met leaving my apartment, and there was an end of it. And,  moreover, it is well known that this same man--this wretch of whom I  speak, never mistook one man for another in his life, which makes the  mystery of the likeness between this incendiary and Drummond the more  extraordinary.\"    \"If it was Drummond, after all that you have asserted, then are my  surmises still wrong.\"    \"There is nothing of which I can be more certain than that it was not  Drummond. We have nothing on earth but our senses to depend upon. If  these deceive us, what are we to do? I own I cannot account for it; nor  ever shall be able to account for it as long as I live.\"    \"Could you know the man in black, if you saw him again?\"    \"I think I could, if I saw him walk or run: his gait was very  particular. He walked as if he had been flat-soled, and his legs made  of steel, without any joints in his feet or ankles.\"    \"The very same! The very same! The very same! Pray will you take a few  days' journey into the country with me, to look at such a man?\"    \"You have preserved my life, and for you I will do anything. I will  accompany you with pleasure: and I think I can say that I will know  him, for his form left an impression on my heart not soon to be  effaced. But of this I am sure that my unworthy companion will  recognize him, and that he will be able to swear to his identity every  day as long as he lives.\"    \"Where is he? Where is he? Oh! Mrs. Calvert, where is he?\"    \"Where is he? He is the wretch whom you heard giving me up to the  death; who, after experiencing every mark of affection that a poor  ruined being could confer, and after committing a thousand atrocities  of which she was ignorant, became an informer to save his diabolical  life, and attempted to offer up mine as a sacrifice for all. We will go  by ourselves first, and I will tell you if it is necessary to send any  farther.\"    The two dames, the very next morning, dressed themselves like country  goodwives, and, hiring two stout ponies furnished with pillions, they  took their journey westward, and the second evening after leaving  Edinburgh they arrived at the village about two miles below Dalcastle,  where they alighted. But Mrs. Logan, being anxious to have Mrs.  Calvert's judgment, without either hint or preparation, took care not  to mention that they were so near to the end of their journey. In  conformity with this plan, she said, after they had sat a while:  \"Heigh-ho, but I am weary! What, suppose we should rest a day here  before we proceed farther on our journey?\"    Mrs. Calvert was leaning on the casement and looking out when her  companion addressed these words to her, and by far too much engaged to  return any answer, for her eyes were riveted on two young men who  approached from the farther end of the village; and at length, turning  round her head, she said, with the most intense interest, \"Proceed  farther on our journey, did you say? That we need not do; for, as I  live, here comes the very man!\"    Mrs. Logan ran to the window, and, behold, there was indeed Robert  Wringhim Colwan (now the Laird of Dalcastle) coming forward almost  below their window, walking arm in arm with another young man; and, as  the two passed, the latter looked up and made a sly signal to the two  dames, biting his lip, winking with his left eye, and nodding his head.  Mrs. Calvert was astonished at this recognizance, the young man's  former companion having made exactly such another signal on the night  of the duel, by the light of the moon; and it struck her, moreover,  that she had somewhere seen this young man's face before. She looked  after him, and he winked over his shoulder to her; but she was  prevented from returning his salute by her companion, who uttered a  loud cry, between a groan and shriek, and fell down on the floor with a  rumble like a wall that had suddenly been undermined. She had fainted  quite away, and required all her companion's attention during the  remainder of the evening, for she had scarcely ever well recovered out  of one fit before she fell into another, and in the short intervals she  raved like one distracted or in a dream. After falling into a sound  sleep by night, she recovered her equanimity, and the two began to  converse seriously on what they had seen. Mrs. Calvert averred that the  young man who passed next to the window was the very man who stabbed  George Colwan in the back, and she said she was willing to take her  oath on it at any time when required, and was certain, if the wretch  Ridsley saw him, that he would make oath to the same purport, for that  his walk was so peculiar no one of common discernment could mistake it.    Mrs. Logan was in great agitation, and said: \"It is what I have  suspected all along, and what I am sure my late master and benefactor  was persuaded of, and the horror of such an idea cut short his days.  That wretch, Mrs. Calvert, is the born brother of him he murdered, sons  of the same mother they were, whether or not of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22766"],[0,"Electricity for Boys (#15)"],[1,"are required. The sheets of copper, containing all of its impurities,  are placed within a tank, parallel with a thin copper sheet. The impure  sheet is connected with the positive pole of an electroplating dynamo,  and the thin sheet of copper is connected with the negative pole. The  electrolyte in the tank is a solution of sulphate of copper. The action  of the current will cause the pure copper in the impure sheet to  disintegrate and it is then carried over and deposited upon the thin  sheet, this action continuing until the impure sheet is entirely eaten  away. All the impurities which were in the sheet fall to the bottom of  the tank.    Other metals are treated in the same way, and this treatment has a very  wide range of usefulness.    ELECTROPLATING.--The next feature to be considered in electrolysis is a  most interesting and useful one, because a cheap or inferior metal may  be coated by a more expensive metal. Silver and nickel plating are  brought about by this action of a current passing through metals, which  are immersed in an electrolyte.    PLATING IRON WITH COPPER.--We have room in this chapter for only one  concrete example of this work, which, with suitable modifications, is an  example of the art as practiced commercially. Iron, to a considerable  extent, is now being coated with copper to preserve it from rust. To  carry out this work, however, an electroplating dynamo, of large  amperage, is required, the amperage, of course, depending upon the  surface to be treated at one time. The pressure should not exceed 5  volts.    The iron surface to be treated should first be thoroughly cleansed, and  then immediately put into a tank containing a cyanide of copper  solution. Two forms of copper solution are used, namely, the cyanide,  which is a salt solution of copper, and the sulphate, which is an acid  solution of copper. Cyanide is first used because it does not attack the  iron, as would be the case if the sulphate solution should first come  into contact with the iron.    A sheet of copper, termed the anode, is then placed within the tank,  parallel with the surface to be plated, known as the cathode, and so  mounted that it may be adjusted to or from the iron surface, or cathode.  A direct current of electricity is then caused to flow through the  copper plate and into the iron plate or surface, and the plating  proceeded with until the iron surface has a thin film of copper  deposited thereon. This is a slow process with the cyanide solution, so  it is discontinued as soon as possible, after the iron surface has been  completely covered with copper. This copper surface is thoroughly  cleaned off to remove therefrom the saline or alkaline solution, and it  is then immersed within a bath, containing a solution of sulphate of  copper. The current is then thrown on and allowed so to remain until it  has deposited the proper thickness of copper.    DIRECTION OF CURRENT.--If a copper and an iron plate are put into a  copper solution and connected up in circuit with each other, a primary  battery is thereby formed, which will generate electricity. In this  case, the iron will be positive and the copper negative, so that the  current within such a cell would flow from the iron (in this instance,  the anode) to the negative, or cathode.    The action of electroplating reverses this process and causes the  current to flow from the copper to the iron (in this instance, the  cathode).          CHAPTER XIV    ELECTRIC HEATING, THERMO ELECTRICITY      GENERATING HEAT IN A WIRE.--When a current of electricity passes through  a conductor, like a wire, more or less heat is developed in the  conductor. This heat may be so small that it cannot be measured, but it  is, nevertheless, present in a greater or less degree. Conductors offer  a resistance to the passage of a current, just the same as water finds a  resistance in pipes through which it passes. This resistance is measured  in ohms, as explained in a preceding chapter, and it is this resistance  which is utilized for electric heating.    RESISTANCE OF SUBSTANCES.--Silver offers less resistance to the passage  of a current than any other metal, the next in order is copper, while  iron is, comparatively, a poor conductor.    The following is a partial list of metals, showing their relative  conductivity:    Silver              1.  Copper              1.04 to 1.09  Gold                1.38 to 1.41  Aluminum            1.64  Zinc                3.79  Nickel              4.69  Iron                6.56  Tin                 8.9  Lead               13.2  German Silver      12.2 to 15    From this table it will be seen that, for instance, iron offers six and  a half times the resistance of silver, and that German silver has  fifteen times the resistance of silver.    This table is made up of strands of the different metals of the same  diameters and lengths, so as to obtain their relative values.    SIZES OF CONDUCTORS.--Another thing, however, must be understood. If two  conductors of the same metal, having different diameters, receive the  same current of electricity, the small conductor will offer a greater  resistance than the large conductor, hence will generate more heat. This  can be offset by increasing the diameter of the conductor. The metal  used is, therefore, of importance, on account of the cost involved.    COMPARISON OF METALS.--A conductor of aluminum, say, 10 feet long and of  the same weight as copper, has a diameter two and a quarter times  greater than copper; but as the resistance of aluminum is 50 per cent.  more than that of silver, it will be seen that, weight for weight,  copper is the cheaper, particularly as aluminum costs fully three times  as much as copper.    [Illustration: _Fig. 96._ SIMPLE ELECTRIC HEATER]    The table shows that German silver has the highest resistance. Of  course, there are other metals, like antimony, platinum and the like,  which have still higher resistance. German silver, however, is most  commonly used, although there are various alloys of metal made which  have high resistance and are cheaper.    The principle of all electric heaters is the same, namely, the  resistance of a conductor to the passage of a current, and an  illustration of a water heater will show the elementary principles in  all of these devices.    A SIMPLE ELECTRIC HEATER.--In Fig. 96 the illustration shows a cup or  holder (A) for the wire, made of hard rubber. This may be of such  diameter as to fit upon and form the cover for a glass (B). The rubber  should be 1/2 inch thick. Two holes are bored through the rubber cup,  and through them are screwed two round-headed screws (C, D), each screw  being 1-1/2 inches long, so they will project an inch below the cap.  Each screw should have a small hole in its lower end to receive a pin  (E) which will prevent the resistance wire from slipping off.    The resistance wire (F) is coiled for a suitable length, dependent upon  the current used, one end being fastened by wrapping it around the screw  (C). The other end of the wire is then brought upwardly through the  interior of the coil and secured in like manner to the other screw (D).    Caution must be used to prevent the different coils or turns from  touching each other. When completed, the coil may be immersed in water,  the current turned on, and left so until the water is sufficiently  heated.    [Illustration: _Figs. 97-98._ RESISTANCE DEVICE]    HOW TO ARRANGE FOR QUANTITY OF CURRENT USED.--It is difficult to  determine just the proper length the coil should be, or the sizes of the  wire, unless you know what kind of current you have. You may, however,  rig up your own apparatus for the purpose of making it fit your heater,  by preparing a base of wood (A) 8 inches long, 3 inches wide and 1 inch  thick. On this mount four electric lamp sockets (B). Then connect the  inlet wire (C) by means of short pieces of wire (D) with all the sockets  on one side. The outlet wire (E) should then be connected up with the  other sides of the sockets by the short wires (F). If, now, we have one  16-candlepower lamp in one of the sockets, there is a half ampere going  through the wires (C, F). If there are two lamps on the board you will  have 1 ampere, and so on. By this means you may readily determine how  much current you are using and it will also afford you a means of  finding out whether you have too much or too little wire in your coil to  do the work.    [Illustration: _Fig. 99._ PLAN VIEW OF ELECTRIC IRON]    AN ELECTRIC IRON.--An electric iron is made in the same way. The upper  side of a flatiron has a circular or oval depression (A) cast therein,  and a spool of slate (B) is made so it will fit into the depression and  the high resistance wire (C) is wound around this spool, and insulating  material, such as asbestos, must be used to pack around it. Centrally,  the slate spool has an upwardly projecting circular extension (D) which  passes through the cap or cover (E) of the iron. The wires of the  resistance coil are then brought through this circular extension and  are connected up with the source of electrical supply. Wires are now  sold for this purpose, which are adapted to withstand an intense heat.    [Illustration: _Fig. 100._ SECTION OF ELECTRIC IRON]    The foregoing example of the use of the current, through resistance  wires, has a very wide application, and any boy, with these examples  before him, can readily make these devices.    THERMO ELECTRICITY.--It has long been the dream of scientists to convert  heat directly into electricity. The present practice is to use a boiler  to generate steam, an engine to provide the motion, and a dynamo to  convert that motion into electricity. The result is that there is loss  in the process of converting the fuel heat into steam; loss to change  the steam into motion, and loss to make electricity out of the motion  of the engine. By using water-power there is less actual"]]]
