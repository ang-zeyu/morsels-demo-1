The number of friars and monks at the Universities before the  Reformation, and especially at Oxford, must have been large. Tanner  says,      In our universities ... were taught divinity and canon law (then,    t. Hen. III., much in vogue), and the friers resorting thither in    great numbers and applying themselves closely to their studies,    outdid the monks in all fashionable knowledge. But the monks    quickly perceived it, and went also to the universities and    studied hard, that they might not be run down by the friers.[49]    And as the friers got houses in the universities, the monks also    got colleges founded and endowed there[50] for the education of    their novices, where they were for some years instructed in    grammar, philosophy, and school divinity, and then returning home,    improved their knowledge by their private studies, to the service    of God and the credit of their respective societies. So that a    little before the Reformation, the greatest part of the proceeders    in divinity at Oxford were monks and Regular canons.        [Headnote: FAVOURITISM OF THE RICH IN THE UNIVERSITIES.]    By Harrison's time, A.D. 1577[51], rich men's sons had not only pressed  into the Universities, but were scrooging poor men's sons out of the  endowments meant only for the poor, learning the lessons that Mr Whiston  so well shows our Cathedral dignitaries have carried out with the  stipends of their choristers, boys and men. \"_Les gros poissons mangent  les menus._ Pro. Poore men are (easily) supplanted by the rich, the  weake by the strong, the meane by the mighty.\"[52] (Cotgrave, u.  _manger_.) The law of \"natural selection\" prevails. Who shall say nay in  a Christian land professing the principles of the great \"Inventor of  Philanthropy\"? Whitgift for one, see his Life of Strype, Bk. I. chap.  xiii. p. 148-50, ed. 1822. In 1589 an act 31 Eliz. c. 6, was passed to  endeavour to prevent the abuse, but, like modern Election-bribery Acts  with their abuse, did not do it.        [Headnote: BAD EXAMPLE OF RICH MEN AT COLLEGE.]      \"at this present, of one sort & other, there are about three    thousand students nourished in them both (as by a late serveie it    manifestlie appeared). They [the Colleges at our Universities]    were created by their founders at the first, onelie for pore men's    sons, whose parents were not able to bring them up unto learning:    but now they have the least benefit of them, by reason the rich do    so incroch upon them. And so farre hath this inconvenence spread    itself, that it is in my time an hard matter for a pore man's    child to come by a fellowship (though he be neuer so good a    scholer & worthie of that roome.) Such packing also is used at    elections, that not he which best deserveth, but he that hath most    friends, though he be the worst scholer, is alwaies surest to    speed; which will turne in the end to the overthrow of learning.    That some gentlemen also, whose friends have been in times past    benefactors to certeine of those houses, doe intrude into the    disposition of their estates, without all respect of order or    statutes devised by the founders, onelie thereby to place whome    they think good (and not without some hope of gaine) the case is    too too evident, and their attempt would soone take place, if    their superiors did not provide to bridle their indevors. In some    grammar schooles likewise, which send scholers to these    universities, it is lamentable to see what briberie is used; for    yer the scholer can be preferred, such briberye is made, that pore    men's children are commonly shut out, and the richer sort received    (who in times past thought it dishonour to live as it were upon    almes) and yet being placed, most of them studie little other than    histories, tables, dice & trifles, as men that make not the living    by their studie the end of their purposes; which is a lamentable    bearing. Besides this, being for the most part either gentlemen,    or rich men's sonnes, they oft bring the universities into much    slander.[53] For standing upon their reputation and libertie, they    ruffle and roist it out, exceeding in apparell, and hanting    riotous companie (which draweth them from their bookes into an    other trade). And for excuse, when they are charged with breach of    all good order, thinke it sufficient to saie, that they be    gentlemen, which grieveth manie not a little. But to proceed with    the rest.      \"Everie one of these colleges haue in like manner their professors    or readers of the tongs and severall sciences, as they call them,    which dailie trade up the youth there abiding privatlie in their    halles, to the end they may be able afterwards (when their turne    commeth about, which is after twelve termes) to show themselves    abroad, by going from thence into the common schooles and publike    disputations (as it were _In aream_) there to trie their skilles,    and declare how they have profited since their coming thither.      \"Moreover in the publike schooles of both the universities, there    are found at the prince's charge (and that verie largelie) five    professors & readers, that is to saie, of divinitie, of the civill    law, physicke, the Hebrew and the Greek tongues. And for the other    lectures, as of philosophie, logike, rhetorike and the    quadriuials, although the latter (I mean, arithmetike, musike,    geometrie and astronomie, and with them all skill in the    perspectives are now smallie regarded in either of them) the    universities themselves do allowe competent stipends to such as    reade the same, whereby they are sufficiently provided for,    touching the maintenance of their estates, and no less encouraged    to be diligent in their functions.\"    On the introduction of the study of Greek into the Universities,  Dr S. Knight says in his _Life of Colet_:      \"As for _Oxford_, its own _History_ and _Antiquities_ sufficiently    confess, that nothing was known there but _Latin_, and that in the    most depraved Style of the _School-men_. _Cornelius Vitellius_, an    _Italian_, was the first who taught _Greek_ in that    University[54]; and from him the famous _Grocyne_ learned the    first Elements thereof.      \"In _Cambridge_, _Erasmus_ was the first who taught the _Greek    Grammar_. And so very low was the State of Learning in that    University, that (as he tells a Friend) about the Year 1485, the    Beginning of _Hen._ VII. Reign, there was nothing taught in that    publick Seminary besides _Alexander's Parva Logicalia_, (as they    called them) the old _Axioms_ of _Aristotle_, and the _Questions_    of John Scotus, till in Process of time _good Letters_ were    brought in, and some Knowledge of the _Mathematicks_; as also    _Aristotle_ in a new Dress, and some Skill in the _Greek_ Tongue;    and, by Degrees, a Multitude of _Authors_, whose _Names_ before    had not been heard of.[55]      \"It is certain that even _Erasmus_ himself did little understand    _Greek_, when he came first into _England_, in 1497 (13 _Hen._    VII.), and that our Countryman _Linacer_ taught it him, being just    returned from _Italy_ with great Skill in that Language: Which    _Linacer_ and _William Grocyne_ were the two only Tutors that were    able to teach it.\" Saml. Knight, Life of Dr John Colet, pp.    17, 18.    The age at which boys went up to the University seems to have varied  greatly. When Oxford students were forbidden to play marbles they could  not have been very old. But in \"The Mirror of the Periods of Man's Life\"  (? ab. 1430 A.D.), in the Society's _Hymns to the Virgin and Christ_ of  this year, we find the going-up age put at twenty:      Quod resou{n}, in age of .XX. [gh]eer,      Goo to oxenford, or lerne lawe[56].    This is confirmed by young Paston's being at Eton at nineteen (see  below, p. lvi). In 1612, Brinsley (_Grammar Schoole_, p. 307) puts the  age at fifteen, and says,      \"such onely should be sent to the Vniuersities, who proue most    ingenuous and towardly, and who, in a loue of learning, will begin    to take paines of themselues, hauing attained in some sort the    former parts of learning; being good Grammarians at least, able to    vnderstand, write and speake Latine in good sort.      \"Such as haue good discretion how to gouerne themselues there, and    to moderate their expenses; which is seldome times before 15    yeeres of age; which is also the youngest age admitted by the    statutes of the Vniuersity, as I take it.\"        [Headnote: FOREIGN UNIVERSITY EDUCATION.]    4. _Foreign University Education._ That some of our nobles sent their  sons to be educated in the French universities (whence they sometimes  imported foreign vices into England[57]) is witnessed by some verses in  a Latin Poem \"in MS. Digby, No. 4 (Bodleian Library) of the end of the  13th or beginning of the 14th century,\" printed by Mr Thomas Wright in  his _Anecdota Literaria_, p. 38.

Thorfinn walked to the  house with Eric and Gudrid, while the other men sailed to the ship-sheds  and pulled their boats under them.    Then Thorfinn saw to the unloading and storing of his goods.    \"Is this Gudrid your daughter?\" he asked of Eric one day.    \"She is the widow of my son Thorstein,\" Eric said. \"He died the same  winter that they were married. Her father, too, died not long ago. So  Gudrid lives with me.\"    Now all that winter until Yule-time Eric spread a good feast every  night. There was laughter through his house all the time. Often at the  feasts the men cast lots to see whether they might sit on the  cross-bench with the women. Sometimes it was Thorfinn's luck to sit by  Gudrid. Then they talked gaily and drank together.    At last Yule was coming near. Eric went about the house gloomy then. One  day Thorfinn put his hand on Eric's shoulder and said:    \"Something is troubling you, Eric. We have all noticed that you are not  gay as you used to be. Tell me what is the matter.\"    \"You have carried yourselves like noble men in my house,\" Eric answered.  \"I am proud to have you for guests. Now I am ashamed that you should not  find a house worthy of you. I am ashamed that when you leave me you will  have to say that you never spent a worse Yule than you did with Eric the  Red in Greenland. For my cupboards are empty.\"    \"Oh, that is easily mended,\" Thorfinn said. \"No house could feed eighty  men so long and not feel it. I never knew so generous a host before.  But I have flour and grain and mead in my boat. You are welcome to all  of it. You have only to open the doors of your own storehouses. It is a  little gift.\"    So Eric used those things, and there was never a merrier Yule feast than  in his house that winter.    When Yule was over, Thorfinn said to Eric:    \"Gudrid is a beautiful and wise woman. I wish to have her for my wife.\"    \"You seem to be a man worthy of her,\" Eric said.    So that winter Gudrid and Thorfinn were married and lived at Eric's  house.    One day Thorfinn said to Eric:    \"I have heard much of this wonderful Wineland since I have been here. It  seems to me that it is worth while to go and see more of it.\"    \"My son Thorstein and I tried it once,\" said Eric. \"It was the year  after Leif came back. We set out with a fair ship and with glad hearts,  but we tossed about all summer on the sea and got nowhere. We were wet  with storm, lean with hunger and illness, and heartsick at our bad  luck.\"    \"And yet,\" Thorfinn said, \"another time we might have better weather. I  have never seen so fair a land as this seems to be.\"    Then he went to Leif and talked long with him. Leif told him in what  direction he had sailed to come home, and how the shores looked that he  had passed.    \"I think I could find my way,\" Thorfinn said. \"My heart moves me to try  this frolic.\"    He spoke to Gudrid about it.    \"Oh, yes!\" she cried. \"Let us go. It is long since I felt a boat leaping  under me. I am tired of sitting still. I want to feel the warm days and  see the soft grass and the high trees and taste the grapes of this  Wineland the Good.\"    Then he talked with his men and with Biarni.    \"We are ready,\" they all said. \"We are only waiting for a leader.\"    \"Then let us go!\" cried Thorfinn.    So in the spring they fitted up their two ships and put into them  provisions and a few cattle. Some of Eric's men also got ready a boat,  so that three ships set sail from Eric's harbor carrying one hundred and  sixty men to Wineland. As they started, Gudrid stood on the deck and  sang:        \"I will feast my eyes on new things--      On mighty trees and purple grapes,      On beds of flowers and soft grass.      I will sun myself in a warm land.\"    They sailed on and past those shores that Leif had spoken of. Whenever  they saw any interesting place they sailed in and looked about and  rested there.    They had gone far south, past many fair shores with woods on them, when  Gudrid said one day:    \"This is a beautiful bay with a smooth, green field by it, and the great  mountains far back. I should like to stay there for a little while.\"    So they sailed in and drew their ships up on shore. They put up the  awnings in them.    \"These shall be our houses,\" Thorfinn said.    They were strange-looking houses--shining dragons with gay backs lying  on the yellow sand. Near them the Norsemen lighted fires and cooked  their supper. That night they slept in the ships. In the morning Gudrid  said:    \"I long to see what is back of that mountain.\"    So they all climbed it. When they stood on the top they could see far  over the country.    \"There is a lake that we must see,\" Thorfinn said.    \"I should like to sail around that bay,\" said Biarni, pointing.    \"I am going to walk up that valley yonder,\" one of the men said.    And everyone saw some place where he would like to go. So for all that  summer they camped in that spot and went about the country seeing new  things. They hunted in the woods and caught rabbits and birds and  sometimes bears and deer. Every day some men rowed out to sea and  fished. There was an island in the bay where thousands of birds had  their nests. The men gathered eggs here.    \"We have more to eat than we had in Greenland or Iceland,\" Thorfinn  said, \"and need not work at all. It is all play.\"    Near the end of summer Thorfinn spoke to his comrades.    \"Have we not seen everything here? Let us go to a new place. We have not  yet found grapes.\"    Thorfinn and Biarni and all their men sailed south again. But some of  Eric's men went off in their boat another way. Years afterward the  Greenlanders heard that they were shipwrecked and made slaves in  Ireland.    After Thorfinn and Biarni had sailed for many days they landed on a low,  green place. There were hills around it. A little lake was there.    \"What is growing on those hillsides?\" Thorfinn said, shading his eyes  with his hand.    He and some others ran up there. The people on shore heard them shout.  Soon they came running back with their hands full of something.    \"Grapes! Grapes!\" they were shouting.    All those people sat down and ate the grapes and then went to the  hillside and picked more.    \"Now we are indeed in Wineland,\" they said. \"It is as wonderful as  Leif's stories. Surely we must stay here for a long time.\"    The very next day they went into the woods and began to cut out lumber.  The huts that they built were little things. They had no windows, and in  the doorways the men hung their cloaks instead of doors.    \"We can be out in the air so much in this warm country,\" said Gudrid,  \"that we do not need fine houses.\"    The huts were scattered all about, some on the side of the lake, some at  the shore of the harbor, some on the hillside. Gudrid had said:    \"I want to live by the lake where I can look into the green woods and  hear sweet bird-noises.\"    So Thorfinn built his hut there.    As they sat about the campfire one night, Biarni said:    \"It is strange that so good a land should be empty. I suppose that  these are the first houses that were ever built in Wineland. It is  wonderful to think that we are alone here in this great land.\"    All that winter no snow fell. The cattle pastured on the grass.    \"To think of the cold, frozen winters in Greenland!\" Gudrid said. \"Oh!  this is the sun's own land.\"    In the beginning of that winter a little son was born to Gudrid and  Thorfinn.    \"A health to the first Winelander!\" the men shouted and drank down their  wine; for they had made some from Wineland grapes.    \"Will he be the father of a great country, as Ingolf was?\" Biarni mused.    Gudrid looked at her baby and smiled.    \"You will be as sunny as this good land, I hope,\" she said.    They named him Snorri. He grew fast and soon crept along the yellow  sand, and toddled among the grapevines, and climbed into the boats and  learned to talk. The men called him the \"Wineland king.\"    \"I never knew a baby before,\" one of the men said.    \"No,\" said another. \"Swords are jealous. But when they are in their  scabbards, we can do other things, even play with babies.\"    \"I wonder whether I have forgotten how to swing my sword in this quiet  land,\" another man said.    One spring morning when the men got up and went out from their huts to  the fires to cook they saw a great many canoes in the harbor. Men were  in them paddling toward shore.    \"What is this?\" cried the Norsemen to one another. \"Where did they come  from? Are they foes? Who ever saw such boats before? The men's faces are  brown.\"    \"Let every man have his sword ready,\" cried Thorfinn. \"But do not draw  until I command. Let us go to meet them.\"    So they went and stood on the shore. Soon the men from the canoes landed  and stood looking at the Norsemen. The strangers' skin was brown. Their  faces were broad. Their hair was black. Their bodies were short. They  wore leather clothes. One man among them seemed to be chief. He spread  out his open hands to the Norsemen.    \"He is showing us that he has no weapons,\" Biarni said. \"He comes in  peace.\"    Then Thorfinn showed his empty hands and asked:    \"What do you want?\"    The stranger said something, but the Norsemen could not understand. It  was some new language. Then the chief pointed to one of the huts and  walked toward it. He and his men walked all around it and felt of the  timber and went into it and looked at all the things there--spades and  cloaks and drinking-horns. As they looked they talked together. They  went to all the other huts and looked at everything there. One of them  found a red cloak. He spread it out and showed it to the others. They  all stood about it and looked at it and felt of it and talked fast.    \"They seem to like my cloak,\" Biarni said.    One of the strangers went down"]]]
