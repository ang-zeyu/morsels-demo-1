The Bureau courts were frequently conducted in an \"illegal and  oppressive manner,\" with \"decided partiality for the colored people,  without regard to justice.\" For this reason they were suspended for a  time in Louisiana and Georgia by General Steedman and General Fullerton,  and cases were then sent before military courts. Men of the highest  character were dragged before the Bureau tribunals upon frivolous  complaints, were lectured, abused, ridiculed, and arbitrarily fined or  otherwise punished. The jurisdiction of the Bureau courts weakened the  civil courts and their frequent interference in trivial matters was not  conducive to a return to normal conditions.    The inferior agents, not sufficiently under the control of their  superiors, were responsible for a great deal of this bad feeling. Many  of them held radical opinions as to the relations of the races, and  inculcated these views in their courts, in the schools, and in the new  Negro churches. Some were charged with even causing strikes and other  difficulties in order to be bought off by the whites. The tendency of  their work was to create in the Negroes a pervasive distrust of the  whites.    The prevalent delusion in regard to an impending division of the  lands among the blacks had its origin in the operation of the war-time  confiscation laws, in some of the Bureau legislation, and in General  Sherman's Sea Island order, but it was further fostered by the agents  until most blacks firmly believed that each head of a family was to get  \"40 acres and a mule.\" This belief seriously interfered with industry  and resulted also in widespread swindling by rascals who for years made  a practice of selling fraudulent deeds to land with red, white, and blue  sticks to mark off the bounds of a chosen spot on the former master's  plantation. The assistant commissioners labored hard to disabuse the  minds of the Negroes, but their efforts were often neutralized by the  unscrupulous attitude of the agents.    As the contest over reconstruction developed in Washington, the  officials of the Bureau soon recognized the political possibilities of  their institution. After midyear of 1866, the Bureau became a political  machine for the purpose of organizing the blacks into the Union League,  where the rank and file were taught that reenslavement would follow  Democratic victories. Nearly all of the Bureau agents aided in  the administration of the reconstruction acts in 1867 and in the  organization of the new state and local governments and became officials  under the new regime. They were the chief agents in capturing the solid  Negro vote for the Republican party.    Neither of the two plans for guiding the freedmen into a place in  the social order--the \"Black Laws\" and the Freedmen's Bureau--was  successful. The former contained a program which was better suited to  actual conditions and which might have succeeded if it had been given a  fair trial. These laws were a measure of the extent to which the average  white would then go in \"accepting the situation\" so far as the blacks  were concerned. And on the whole the recognition of Negro rights made in  these laws, and made at a time when the whites believed that they were  free to handle the situation, was remarkably fair. The Negroes lately  released from slavery were admitted to the enjoyment of the same rights  as the whites as to legal protection of life, liberty, and property, as  to education and as to the family relation, limited only by the clear  recognition of the principles of political inferiority and social  separation. Unhappily this legislation was not put to the test  of practical experience because of the Freedmen's Bureau; it was  nevertheless skillfully used to arouse the dominant Northern party to a  course of action which made impossible any further effort to treat the  race problem with due consideration to actual local conditions.    Much of the work of the Freedmen's Bureau was of only temporary benefit  to both races. The results of its more permanent work were not generally  good. The institution was based upon the assumption that the Negro  race must be protected from the white race. In its organization and  administration it was an impossible combination of the practical and  the theoretical, of opportunism and humanitarianism, of common sense and  idealism. It failed to exert a permanently wholesome influence because  its lesser agents were not held to strict accountability by their  superiors. Under these agents the alienation of the two races began, and  the ill feelings then aroused were destined to persist into a long and  troubled future.        CHAPTER V. THE VICTORY OF THE RADICALS    The soldiers who fought through the war to victory or to defeat had  been at home nearly two years before the radicals developed sufficient  strength to carry through their plans for a revolutionary reconstruction  of the Southern states. At the end of the war, a majority of the  Northern people would have supported a settlement in accordance with  Lincoln's policy. Eight months later a majority, but a smaller one,  would have supported Johnson's work had it been possible to secure a  popular decision on it. How then did the radicals gain the victory over  the conservatives? The answer to this question is given by James Ford  Rhodes in terms of personalities: \"Three men are responsible for the  Congressional policy of Reconstruction: Andrew Johnson, by his  obstinacy and bad behavior; Thaddeus Stevens, by his vindictiveness and  parliamentary tyranny; Charles Sumner, by his pertinacity in a misguided  humanitarianism.\" The President stood alone in his responsibility,  but his chief opponents were the ablest leaders of a resolute band of  radicals.    Radicalism did not begin in the Administration of Andrew Johnson.  Lincoln had felt its covert opposition throughout the war, but he  possessed the faculty of weakening his opponents, while Johnson's  conduct usually multiplied the number and the strength of his enemies.  At first the radicals criticized Lincoln's policy in regard to slavery,  and after the Emancipation Proclamation they shifted their attack to his  \"ten percent\" plan for organizing the state governments as outlined in  the Proclamation of December 1863. Lincoln's course was distasteful to  them because he did not admit the right of Congress to dictate terms,  because of his liberal attitude towards former Confederates, and because  he was conservative on the Negro question. A schism among the Republican  supporters of the war was with difficulty averted in 1864, when Fremont  threatened to lead the radicals in opposition to the \"Union\" party of  the President and his conservative policy.    The breach was widened by the refusal of Congress to admit  representatives from Arkansas and Louisiana in 1864 and to count the  electoral vote of Louisiana and Tennessee in 1865. The passage of the  Wade-Davis reconstruction bill in July 1864, and the protests of its  authors after Lincoln's pocket veto called attention to the growing  opposition. Severe criticism caused Lincoln to withdraw the propositions  which he had made in April 1865, with regard to the restoration of  Virginia. In his last public speech, he referred with regret to  the growing spirit of vindictiveness toward the South. Much of the  opposition to Lincoln's Southern policy was based not on radicalism,  that is, not on any desire for a revolutionary change in the South, but  upon a belief that Congress and not the executive should be entrusted  with the work of reorganizing the Union. Many congressional leaders were  willing to have Congress itself carry through the very policies which  Lincoln had advocated, and a majority of the Northern people would have  endorsed them without much caring who was to execute them.    The murder of Lincoln, the failure of the radicals to shape Johnson's  policy as they had hoped, and the continuing reaction against the  excessive expansion of the executive power added strength to the  opposition. But it was a long fight before the radical leaders won.  Their victory was due to adroit tactics on their own part and to  mistakes, bad judgment, and bad manners on the part of the President.  When all hope of controlling Johnson had been given up, Thaddeus Stevens  and other leaders of similar views began to contrive means to circumvent  him. On December 1, 1865, before Congress met, a caucus of radicals held  in Washington agreed that a joint committee of the two Houses should be  selected to which should be referred matters relating to reconstruction.  This plan would thwart the more conservative Senate and gain a desirable  delay in which the radicals might develop their campaign. The next day  at a caucus of the Union party the plan went through without arousing  the suspicion of the supporters of the Administration. Next, through the  influence of Stevens, Edward McPherson, the clerk of the House, omitted  from the roll call of the House the names of the members from the  South. The radical program was then adopted and a week later the Senate  concurred in the action of the House as to the appointment of a Joint  Committee on Reconstruction.    On the issues before Congress both Houses were split into rather clearly  defined factions: the extreme radicals with such leaders as Stevens,  Sumner, Wade, and Boutwell; the moderate Republicans, chief among whom  were Fessenden and Trumbull; the administration Republicans led by  Raymond, Doolittle, Cowan, and Dixon; and the Democrats, of whom the  ablest"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2898"],[0,"Pioneers of the Old South: A Chronicle of English Colonial Beginnings (#15)"],[1,"and a Lord Proprietor with kingly powers. Virginians  seated on the James promptly petitioned King Charles not to do them  wrong by so dividing their portion of the earth. But King and Privy  Council answered only that Virginia and Maryland must \"assist each  other on all occasions as becometh fellow-subjects.\" William Claiborne,  indeed, continued with a determined voice to cry out that lands given  to Baltimore were not, as had been claimed, unsettled, seeing that he  himself had under patent a town on Kent Island and another at the mouth  of the Susquehanna.    Baltimore was a reflective man, a dreamer in the good sense of the term,  and religiously minded. At the height of seeming good fortune he could  write:    \"All things, my lord, in this world pass away.... They are but lent  us till God please to call for them back again, that we may not esteem  anything our own, or set our hearts upon anything but Him alone, who  only remains forever.\" Like his King, Baltimore could carry far his  prerogative and privilege, maintaining the while not a few degrees of  inner freedom. Like all men, here he was bound, and here he was free.    Baltimore's desire was for \"enlarging his Majesty's Empire,\" and at  the same time to provide in Maryland a refuge for his fellow Catholics.  These were now in England so disabled and limited that their status  might fairly be called that of a persecuted people. The mounting  Puritanism promised no improvement. The King himself had no fierce  antagonism to the old religion, but it was beginning to be seen that  Charles and Charles's realm were two different things. A haven should be  provided before the storm blackened further. Baltimore thus saw put into  his hands a high and holy opportunity, and made no doubt that it was  God-given. His charter, indeed, seemed to contemplate an established  church, for it gave to Baltimore the patronage of all churches and  chapels which were to be \"consecrated according to the ecclesiastical  laws of our kingdom of England\"; nevertheless, no interpretation of the  charter was to be made prejudicial to \"God's holy and true Christian  religion.\" What was Christian and what was prejudicial was, fortunately  for him, left undefined. No obstacles were placed before a Catholic  emigration.    Baltimore had this idea and perhaps a still wider one: a land--Mary's  land--where all Christians might foregather, brothers and sisters in  one home! Religious tolerance--practical separation of Church and  State--that was a broad idea for his age, a generous idea for a Roman  Catholic of a time not so far removed from the mediaeval. True, wherever  he went and whatever might be his own thought and feeling, he would  still have for overlord a Protestant sovereign, and the words of his  charter forbade him to make laws repugnant to the laws of England. But  Maryland was distant, and wise management might do much. Catholics,  Anglicans, Puritans, Dissidents, and Nonconformists of almost any  physiognomy, might come and be at home, unpunished for variations in  belief.    Only the personal friendship of England's King and the tact and suave  sagacity of the Proprietary himself could have procured the signing of  this charter, since it was known--as it was to all who cared to busy  themselves with the matter--that here was a Catholic meaning to take  other Catholics, together with other scarcely less abominable sectaries,  out of the reach of Recusancy Acts and religious pains and penalties, to  set them free in England-in-America; and, raising there a state on the  novel basis of free religion, perhaps to convert the heathen to all  manner of errors, and embark on mischiefs far too large for definition.  Taking things as they were in the world, remembering acts of the  Catholic Church in the not distant past, the ill-disposed might find  some color for the agitation which presently did arise. Baltimore was  known to be in correspondence with English Jesuits, and it soon appeared  that Jesuit priests were to accompany the first colonists. At that time  the Society of Jesus loomed large both politically and educationally.  Many may have thought that there threatened a Rome in America. But,  however that may have been, there was small chance for any successful  opposition to the charter, since Parliament had been dissolved by the  King, not to be summoned again for eleven years. The Privy Council was  subservient, and, as the Sovereign was his friend, Baltimore saw the  signing of the charter assured and began to gather together his first  colonists. Then, somewhat suddenly, in April, 1632, he sickened, and  died at the age of fifty-three.    His son, Cecil Calvert, second Lord Baltimore, took up his father's  work. This young man, likewise able and sagacious, and at every step in  his father's confidence, could and did proceed even in detail according  to what had been planned. All his father's rights had descended to  him; in Maryland he was Proprietary with as ample power as ever a Count  Palatine had enjoyed. He took up the advantage and the burden.    The father's idea had been to go with his colonists to Maryland, and  this it seems that the son also meant to do. But now, in London, there  deepened a clamor against such Catholic enterprise. Once he were away,  lips would be at the King's ear. And with England so restless, in a  turmoil of new thought, it might even arise that King and Privy Council  would find trouble in acting after their will, good though that might  be. The second Baltimore therefore remained in England to safeguard his  charter and his interests.    The family of Baltimore was an able one. Cecil Calvert had two brothers,  Leonard and George, and these would go to Maryland in his place. Leonard  he made Governor and Lieutenant-general, and appointed him councilor.  Ships were made ready--the Ark of three hundred tons and the Dove of  fifty. The colonists went aboard at Gravesend, where these ships rode at  anchor. Of the company a great number were Protestants, willing to take  land, if their condition were bettered so, with Catholics. Difficulties  of many kinds kept them all long at the mouth of the Thames, but at  last, late in November, 1633, the Ark and the Dove set sail. Touching at  the Isle of Wight, they took aboard two Jesuit priests, Father White and  Father Altham, and a number of other colonists. Baltimore reported that  the expedition consisted of \"two of my brothers with very near twenty  other gentlemen of very good fashion, and three hundred labouring men  well provided in all things.\"    These ships, with the first Marylanders, went by the old West Indies sea  route. We find them resting at Barbados; then they swung to the north  and, in February, 1634, came to Point Comfort in Virginia. Here they  took supplies, being treated by Sir John Harvey (who had received  a letter from the King) with \"courtesy and humanity.\" Without long  tarrying, for they were sick now for land of their own, they sailed on  up the great bay, the Chesapeake.    Soon they reached the mouth of the Potomac--a river much greater than  any of them, save shipmasters and mariners, had ever seen--and into this  turned the Ark and the Dove. After a few leagues of sailing up the wide  stream, they came upon an islet covered with trees, leafless, for spring  had hardly broken. The ships dropped anchor; the boats were lowered; the  people went ashore. Here the Calverts claimed Maryland \"for our Savior  and for our Sovereign Lord the King of England,\" and here they heard  Mass. St. Clement's they called the island.    But it was too small for a home. The Ark was left at anchor, while  Leonard Calvert went exploring with the Dove. Up the Potomac some  distance he went, but at the last he wisely determined to choose for  their first town a site nearer the sea. The Dove turned and came back  to the Ark, and both sailed on down the stream from St. Clement's Isle.  Before long they came to the mouth of a tributary stream flowing in  from the north. The Dove, going forth again, entered this river, which  presently the party named the River St. George. Soon they came to a high  bank with trees tinged with the foliage of advancing spring. Here upon  this bank the English found an Indian village and a small Algonquin  group, in the course of extinction by their formidable Iroquois  neighbors, the giant Susquehannocks. The white men landed, bearing a  store of hatchets, gewgaws, and colored cloth. The first Lord Baltimore,  having had opportunity enough for observing savages, had probably handed  on to his sagacious sons his conclusions as to ways of dealing with the  natives of the forest. And the undeniable logic of events was at last  teaching the English how to colonize. Englishmen on Roanoke Island,  Englishmen on the banks of the James, Englishmen in that first New  England colony, had borne the weight of early inexperience and all the  catalogue of woes that follow ignorance. All these early colonists alike  had been quickly entangled in strife with the people whom they found in  the land.         First they fell on their knees,       And then on the Aborigines.    But by now much water had passed the mill. The thinking kind, the wiser  sort, might perceive more things than one, and among these the fact that  savages had a sense of justice and would even fight against injustice,  real or fancied.    The Calverts, through their interpreter, conferred with the inhabitants  of this Indian village. Would they sell lands where the white men might  peaceably settle, under their given word to deal in friendly wise with  the red men? Many hatchets and axes and much cloth would be given in  return.    To a sylvan people store of hatchets and axes had a value beyond many  fields of the boundless earth. The Dove appeared before them, too, at  the psychological moment. They had just discussed removing, bag and  baggage, from the proximity of the Iroquois. In the end,"]]]
