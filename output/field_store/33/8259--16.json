[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21102"],[0,"Tom and Some Other Girls: A Public School Story (#15)"],[1,"_was_ good to be coddled once more, to lie  snugly in bed and have a tray brought up with a teapot for one's very  own self, and egg, and fish, and toast--actually toast! instead of thick  slices of bread-and-scrape.  The luxury of it took away one's breath.  It was pleasant, also, to have Nurse fussing around in motherly fashion,  and hear her reminiscences of other young ladies whom she had nursed, in  days gone by, and brought back from the jaws of death.  From her manner,  it is true, she did not appear to suffer any keen anxiety about her  present patient: but, as Rhoda looked at the empty dishes before her,  she blushingly acknowledged that, after all, she could not have been so  ill as she had imagined.    After breakfast came Miss Everett, sweet as ever, and looking  refreshingly pretty in her pale blue blouse and natty collar and cuffs.  If one did not know to the contrary, she would certainly have been  mistaken for one of the elder girls, and her manner was delightfully  unprofessional.    \"Well, my poor dear, this is bad news!  I _was_ sorry when Tom told me.  What is it?--headache--back-ache--pain in your throat?\"    Rhoda stretched herself lazily and considered the question.    \"A kind of general all-overishness, if you know what that means.  I feel  played out.  I tried to get up, but it was no use, I simply couldn't  stand.  I feel as if I had no back left--as weak as a kitten.\"    Miss Everett looked at her quietly, then her eye roved round the room  and rested meaningly on half-a-dozen pieces of paper fastened up in  conspicuous positions.  One sheet was tacked into the frame of the  looking-glass, another into a picture, a third pinned against the  curtain, and each was covered with Rhoda's large writing, easily legible  across the few yards of space: Rules of Latin Grammar, List of  Substantives, Tenses of Verbs--they stared one in the face at every  turn, and refused to be avoided.  Miss Everett laid her hand upon the  bed, and something rustled beneath her touch.  Yet another sheet had  been concealed beneath her pillow.    \"Oh, Rhoda!\" she cried, reproachfully; \"oh, Rhoda!\"    The girl put on an air of protest.    \"What?  There's no harm in it, is there?  I can't catch the others up  unless I work hard.  I have not enough time in preparation, so I put  these up and learn them while I dress and undress, and every time I come  in to prepare for a meal.  You have no idea what a lot I get through.  And I keep a list in my pocket too, and take it out at odd moments.  Miss Murray is surprised at the way I am getting on.\"    \"I have been surprised too, to see you look so ill, with such white  cheeks and heavy eyes.  I understand it now.\"    \"But, Miss Everett, I _must_ work.  I _must_ get on!  If I am behind I  _must_ catch up.  Even if I am tired I must get on in my class.\"    \"Why?\"    Why?  Why must she get on?  It was such an extraordinary question to  come from a teacher, that Rhoda could only gasp in bewilderment--\"Why?  You ask _why_?\"    \"Yes, I do.  One has always some object in work.  I wondered what yours  might be.  Why are you so terribly anxious to come to the front?\"    A dozen answers rose to Rhoda's lips.  To impress Thomasina; to show her  that if I do think a good deal of myself, it's not without a cause...  To take the conceit out of the girls who patronise me.  To be able to  patronise in my turn, and not remain always insignificant and  powerless...  To show Harold how clever I am, and to have my name put on  the Record Wall when I leave! ...  They were one and all excellent  reasons, yet somehow she did not care to confide them to Miss Everett.  Instead, she hesitated, and answered by another question.    \"I suppose you think there is a wrong and a right motive?  I suppose you  think mine is the wrong one.  What is the right, then?  I'm ill, and  reduced in my mind, so it's a good time to preach; I'll listen meekly!\"    \"And disagree with every word I say,\" cried Miss Everett laughing.  \"No,  no, Rhoda, I never preach.  I know girls well enough to understand that  that doesn't pay.  There are some secrets that we have to find out for  ourselves, and it is waste of time telling the answers before the hearer  is ready to receive them; only, when one has oneself suffered from  ignorance, and sees another poor dear running her head against the wall,  one is sorry, that's all, and one longs to point out the danger signals.  Find out, dear, what your motive is, and be satisfied that it's a good  one.  Meantime, I'm going to take away these papers.  Do you see?  Every--single--one!\"  She walked round the room, confiscating the lists,  and putting them in her pocket with an air of good-natured  determination.  \"Let that tired head rest, and believe me, my dear, that  your elders understand almost as much about girls as you do yourself.  We are never blamed for under-working at Hurst, and you may take for  granted that the hours for work are as long as you can stand.  The short  time spent in your cubicle is not intended for work, but for rest--of  all kinds!\"    Rhoda blushed guiltily.  During the first days at school the morning  hymn had been both a delight and stimulus.  She had listened to the  words with a beating heart, and whispered them to herself in devout  echo; they had seemed to strike a keynote for the day, and send her to  work full of courage; but, alas! for weeks past the strains had fallen  on deaf ears, and the lips had been too busy conning Latin substantives  to have leisure for other repetition.  Her sense of guilt made her meek  under the confiscation of her lists, and pathetically grateful for the  kiss of farewell.    \"Thank you for coming.  I know you are busy, but I wanted you so!  It's  nice to see you; you look so sweet and pretty!\"    \"Oh, you flatterer!  I'm surprised at you.  As if it matters what a  staid old teacher looked like; I'm above such silly vanities, my dear.\"    She looked, however, extremely pleased, quite brisked up in fact, and so  delightfully like a girl that Rhoda took heart of grace, and enquired:--    \"I wish you would tell me _your_ object!  That wouldn't be preaching,  and you are so young to be working so hard!  I have often wondered--\"    \"Ah!\" cried Miss Everett, and a curious look passed over her face--half  glad, half sad, wholly proud.  \"I'll tell you my object, Rhoda--it's my  brother, Lionel!  I have an only brother, and he is a genius.  You  remember his name, and when you are an old lady in a cap and mittens you  can amuse other old ladies by telling how you once knew his sister, and  she prophesied his greatness.  At school he carried all before him, and  he is as good as he is clever, and as merry as he is good.  He won a  scholarship at Oxford, but that was not enough.  My father is the vicar  of Stourley, in D--shire, and has such a small stipend that he could not  afford to help him as much as was needed.  Then I wrote to Miss Bruce,  and asked her if she could give me an opening.  She is an old family  friend, and knew that I had done well in examinations and was good at  games (the younger teachers here must be able to play with the girls--  it's one of the rules), so she gave me my present position, and I am  able to help the boy.  He went up last year and did famously, but I have  had sad news this week.  He had been obliged to go home and convalesce  after an attack of influenza, and is so weak still that the doctor says  he will want any amount of rest and feeding up before he can go back.  So you see I am more thankful than ever to be able to help!\"    \"I don't see it at all,\" said Rhoda bluntly.  \"I should be mad.  What's  the good of your slaving here if, after all, he can't get on with his  work?  You might as well be comfortably at home.\"    \"Rhoda!  Rhoda! be quiet this moment.  It's bad enough to fight against  my own rebellious feelings without hearing them put into words.  I won't  stay another moment to listen to you!\"    She gave a playful shake to the girl's shoulder, and ran out of the  room, while Rhoda \"snoddled\" down to think over the conversation.    \"Well, then, I suppose her motive is love--love for her brother, and--  er--thinking of him before herself.  She comes here and slaves so that  he may have his chance.  She is an angel, of course, an unselfish angel,  and I'm a wretch.\"  She lay still for a few moments, frowning fiercely,  then suddenly the bedclothes went up with a wrench--\"I don't care--she's  ambitious too!  She thinks he is clever, and wants him to be great!  Well, so do I want to be great!  If it isn't wrong for one person, it  can't be for another.  My motive is _success_, and I'll work for it till  I drop!\"        CHAPTER ELEVEN.    TOM'S EXAMINATION.    A day in bed renewed Rhoda's energy, and she took up her work with  unabated fervour.  The \"lists\" were, perhaps, less conspicuously  displayed than before, but were none the less in readiness when needed,  and if Miss Everett disapproved, the Latin mistress was all praise and  congratulation.    \"I certainly have a gift for languages, and with lessons during the  holidays I shall soon be steaming ahead,\" Rhoda told herself proudly.  \"I'll ask mother to let Mr Mason coach me.  He is a splendid teacher,  and if I have an hour a day I shall learn a lot.  Won't the girls stare  when I come back, and go soaring up the class!  I shouldn't wonder if I  got a remove.  It will be impossible to work up to Thomasina and her  set, but at any rate I'll be past the baby stages, and not disgrace  myself in the examinations.\"    All the world seemed bounded by examinations at present.  Thomasina and  the elder girls working steadily towards the goal of the \"Matric\";  Kathleen and her friends dreaming night and day of the \"Oxford\"; while  nearer at hand loomed the school examinations, which ended the term.  Rhoda was in a fever of anxiety to acquit herself well in the eyes of  her companions on this occasion, and could think, speak, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21111"],[0,"Wild Nature Won By Kindness (#15)"],[1,"Edwards, in her very  interesting book, \"A Thousand Miles up the Nile,\" thus speaks of it:  \"Every one knows how this scarab was adopted by the Egyptians as an  emblem of creative power and the immortality of the soul; it is to be  seen in the wall-sculptures, on the tombs, cut out in precious stones  and worn as an ornament, buried in the mummy-cases, and a figure of the  beetle forms a hieroglyph, and represents a word signifying 'To be and  to transform.' If actual worship was not paid to _Scaraboeus Sacer_,[1]  it was, at any rate, regarded with the greatest reverence and a vast  amount of symbolism drawn from its various characteristics.\"    [Footnote 1: Or _Ateuchus Sacer_.]    I had often wished to see this insect alive, and one day my wish was  very unexpectedly gratified by the arrival of a small tin box in which I  found a specimen of the sacred beetle swathed in wet linen like a  veritable mummy, only, instead of being an Egyptian specimen, this had  come from a kind friend at the Riviera, who knew that the same species  existed there, and had sent me this one by post. The scarab was at once  named \"Cheops,\" and treated with all the respect due to his ancient  family traditions.    His wants were easily supplied: a deep tin box, with earth and moss  slightly damped, gave him space for exercise; and then for food--alas!  that his tastes should be so degraded--he had to be supplied with  cow-dung! This could be done in secret, and judiciously hidden by fair,  green moss; but when exhibiting my cherished pet to admiring friends  the first question was sure to be, \"What does he feed upon?\" and one had  to take refuge in vague generalities about organic substances, &c.,  which might mean anything, and then, by diverting attention to some  point of interest apart from the food question, the difficulty was  generally overcome.    I kept a close watch to see if the beetle would be led by instinct to  form its round pellets of mud as is its custom on the banks of the Nile,  and having placed its egg in the centre, it begins to roll it from the  margin of the river until it is above high-water mark. There it digs a  hole and buries the pellet, leaving the sun to hatch the eggs in due  time. Travellers who have watched the process describe the untiring way  in which both the male and female beetle roll these pellets, often  falling down with their burden into holes and ridges in the rough  ground; but then their comrades will give them help, and, picking up the  ball, they patiently labour on. Walking backwards, having the pellet  between their broad hind legs, they push it up and up until it is  placed in safety. The persevering energy of this insect led the  Egyptians to adopt it as an emblem of the labours of their great deity,  Osiris, or the sun; they also traced a resemblance in the spiny  projections on its head to the rays of the sun.    Great was my delight to find at length that Cheops--even in  captivity--was true to his native instincts, that he had formed a pellet  about the size of a marble and was gravely rolling it with his hind legs  backwards and forwards in his box. Poor captive! he was evidently  puzzled what to do with the precious thing. He had no Nile bank to  surmount, and the sun was hardly warm enough to encourage any hope for  his future family; but he did the only thing that was possible--he set  to work to scoop out a hole of sufficient size, then rolled the pellet  in and covered it over with loose earth. Three such pellets were made at  intervals of a few days; one of them I unearthed and kept as a curio.  The beetle never seemed to miss it, and having done his duty under  difficult circumstances, his mind seemed to be at rest.    I often placed Cheops in my hand to show him to visitors, and there he  would lie feigning to be dead until he was gently stroked over the  elytra, when he would stretch out his antennae, then his legs by slow  degrees appeared (for he tucked them close to his body out of sight when  frightened), and at last he would begin to walk in a jerky manner, as if  moved by machinery, often stopping to look and listen to be sure that it  was safe to move, and even if busily at work in the earth, if he saw any  one coming near he would stop, draw in his antennae and limbs and remain  motionless.    He had a strong and peculiar odour at times, which became more apparent  if he was annoyed. He was infested with a small mite, and though these  were frequently cleared away with water and a camel's-hair brush, they  always reappeared in a day or two, clustering under the thorax between  the first pair of legs, and at times they might be seen racing over his  body with great rapidity. Once Cheops nearly escaped, for I had placed  his box in the sun, and the warmth so excited and waked him up that he  opened his wing-cases, used his gauze-like inner wings, and with a  mighty hum was all but gone in search of his native land, but  fortunately I was near enough to intercept his flight and place him in  safe quarters. After keeping this curious creature in perfect health for  sixteen months, I was much vexed to find him one morning lying in a  shallow pan of water in his box, quite dead. He had overbalanced on to  his back, and, being unable to turn over, had been drowned, though the  water was scarcely half an inch deep. Poor Cheops is enshrined in a  pyramid-shaped box, in which he is often shown and his life-history told  to interested visitors.    [Illustration]          [Illustration: TRAP-DOOR SPIDERS.]    SPIDERS.      Of all the varieties of \"creeping things\" spiders seem to be the most  universally disliked. I knew well the kind of expression I should see on  the faces of my friends when I produced the box which contained my pet  Tegenaria, a large black spider, long-legged and very swift, a  well-known kind of house-spider.    Happily the box had a glass lid, so the inmate could be seen in comfort;  and when the spider's history was told there was always an interest  created in even this poor despised creature.    When first placed in its new home the Tegenaria began spinning tunnels  of white silky web in various directions across the box. They were  almost as close in texture as fine gauze, and had openings here and  there, so that they formed a kind of labyrinth.    The spider always lived in one corner, curled up, watching for prey, and  when a blue-bottle was put in, and began buzzing, she then rushed up one  tunnel and down another until she could pounce upon her prey.    The fly was quickly killed by her poison fangs, and then carried to the  corner to be consumed at leisure. Unlike the habit of the garden or  diadem spider, no cobweb was rolled round the victim; only the wings  were cut off and the body carried away. After some months I noticed the  corner seemed filled up with web and fragments of insects, and when I  examined it more closely there appeared a large round ball of eggs, over  which the spider had spun some web, and then had collected all the legs  and wings of her prey and stuck them carelessly here and there in the  web so as to conceal her nest, and make it look like the remains of an  old cobweb. Over this nest she kept careful watch. One could not drive  her from it; she only left it for a moment to spring upon a fly, and  would return with her food immediately and resume her watchful life in  the corner. At length the young spiders were hatched in countless  numbers; they crept about the tunnels, and though so minute as to be  mere specks, they were perfect in form, active in seeking for prey, and  appeared perfectly able to take care of themselves and begin life on  their own account.    I had kept the Tegenaria more than a year in confinement, and having  shown such admirable motherly instincts, I thought she had earned the  reward of liberty. No doubt she welcomed \"the order of release\"! At any  rate, she scampered away under some tree-roots, and possibly resides  there with her numerous family to this day.    Spiders hunt their prey in a variety of ways--some by spinning their  beautiful web, with which we are all familiar; others, as the Zebra  spiders, catch flies by leaping suddenly upon them, and these may often  be seen on window-sills watching some coveted insect, drawing slowly  nearer to the victim, till, by a well-directed spring, it can be  secured. There are nearly three hundred species of spiders in this  country, and nearly all spin and weave their silken threads in some way,  but each in different fashions, according to their mode of life. The  female spider is the spinner, and her supply is about 150 yards. When  she has used that amount a few days' rest will enable her to secrete a  similar quantity.    With great pains the spider's silk has been obtained and woven into a  delicate kind of material; but as each spider only yields one grain of  silk, and 450 were required to produce one yard, the process was found  to be impracticable. The insect possesses silk of two colours,  silver-grey and yellow; one is used for the foundation-lines of the web,  and the other for the interlacing threads. The silk is drawn by the  spider from its four spinnerets, and issues from them in a soft, viscid  state, but it hardens by exposure to the air. If a web is examined with  a magnifying-glass, it will be seen that its threads are closely  studded with minute globules of gum, which is so sticky that flies  caught in the web are held in this kind of birdlime until the spider is  able to spring upon them.    Astronomers and microscopists make use of the strongest lines of the  spider's web to form some of their delicate instruments. The thread is  drawn in parallel lines at right angles across the field of the  eye-piece at equal distances, so as to make a multitude of fine  divisions, scarcely visible to the naked eye, and so thin as to be no  obstacle to the view of the object. One means of classifying spiders is  by the"]]]
