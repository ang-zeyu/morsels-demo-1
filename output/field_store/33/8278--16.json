[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21688"],[0,"Scottish Cathedrals and Abbeys (#15)"],[1," death of Abbot Duncan, the  last of the old abbots. Under the bishopric of Man and the Isles, the  monastery became subject to the Bishop of Drontheim till 1156, when  Somerled won it, and once more restored the connection between Iona and  Ireland by placing the monastery under the care of the Abbot of Derry.  In 1164 the community was represented by the priest, the lector, the  head of the Culdees, and the Disertach or the head of the disert for the  reception of pilgrims.[195] Somerled appears to have rebuilt the ruined  monastery on a larger scale, and about 1203 the Lord of the Isles  (Reginald) adopted the policy of the Scottish kings, and founded at Iona  a monastery of Benedictine monks (Tyronenses), and at the same time a  nunnery for Benedictine nuns, of which Beatrice, sister of Reginald, was  first prioress. It is of this Benedictine monastery and nunnery that the  present ruins are the remains, and they were formerly connected by a  causeway which extended from the nunnery to the monastery. After a  struggle, the Culdees seem to have conformed to the new order of  Benedictines, and the head of the Culdees was represented by the Prior  of Iona, whom we afterwards find in the monastery. Iona was suffragan to  the Bishop of Man and the Isles till 1431, when the Abbot of Iona made  obedience to the Bishop of Dunkeld. In 1498, the Isles were made  suffragan to St. Andrews; in 1506 they passed back to the care of the  Bishop of the Isles; and from that date till the Reformation the abbey  church became the cathedral church of the diocese. In 1648 Charles I.  granted the island to Archibald, Marquis of Argyll,[196] and it still  belongs to his descendant, the Duke of Argyll. The diocese contained  forty-four parishes.    Surrounding the Chapel of St. Oran is a very ancient churchyard,  containing beautiful specimens of Highland carved tombstones, and near  which reposes the dust of Scotch, Irish, and Norwegian kings and  ecclesiastics. The late Duke of Argyll both preserved and restored, and  the foundations of the chapels and cloisters have been plainly marked  out, and give a clear idea of the original plan of the abbey. The abbey  or cathedral, although begun in the twelfth century, took a long time in  building, was altered and added to, and is classed with the buildings of  the Third Pointed period, as the greater part of the work connected with  it belongs to a late date.[197] It is cruciform in shape, consisting of  nave, transepts, and choir, with sacristy on the north side of the  choir, and aisle on the south. Near the west entrance was a small  chamber called St. Columba's tomb. Over the crossing is a square tower,  70 feet high, and supported by arches resting on four pillars. It is  lighted on one side by a window formed by a slab with quatrefoil  openings, and on the other by a marigold or Catherine-wheel window with  spiral mullions. The capitals of the pillars are carved with beautiful  ornamentation and grotesque figures, which are still sharp and well  defined.[198] There are three sedilia, and the high altar seems to have  been of marble. North of the nave is the cloister-garth; to the north  and east of the cloisters are the refectory and chapter-house; the  building over the chapter-house was the library, which was large and  valuable. There were said to be many crosses in Iona; the entire ones  are St. Martin's Cross, opposite the west door of the abbey church, and  Maclean's Cross, on the wayside between the nunnery and the cathedral.  There are the ruins of a small detached chapel to the north-east of the  chapter-house, and of another to the west of the cloister: to the  north-east of the cloister lie the total ruins of what is called the  abbot's house.[199] A short distance north-east of the abbey church, at  Cladh-an-diseart, there was found in 1872 a heart-shaped stone, with an  incised cross on it, which Dr. Skene is disposed to think was the stone  used by St. Columba as a pillow.[200]    The ruins of the nunnery, of which Beatrice, sister of Reginald, was the  first abbess, and which was apparently erected soon after 1203, consist  of a quadrangle about 68 feet square, having the church on the north  side, foundations of the chapter-house and other apartments on the east  side, and the refectory on the south side. There may have been other  buildings on the west side, as the walls are broken at the ends; but if  so, they are now removed.[201] The church was an oblong structure,  divided into nave and choir, and had a northern aisle extending along  both. At a distance of about 30 feet north of the convent church stand  the ruins of another building, said to have been the parish church. It  was a simple oblong chamber, and was dedicated to St. Ronan.[202] Lovely  carved work has been found around the buildings, and these are carefully  preserved and have been reproduced in illustration.[203] These designs  were probably carved on stone from the beautiful illuminated tracery  which the Celtic monks executed in their scriptorium.    No ruthless destruction about the Reformation period could deprive Iona  of its three great voices of the mountain, the sky, and the sea. That  St. Columba's poetic nature and susceptible heart were impressed by them  is beyond doubt, for they survive in his poem--        Delightful would it be to me to be in Uchd Ailiun        On the pinnacle of a rock,      That I might often see        The face of the ocean:      That I might see its heaving waves        Over the wide ocean,      When they chant music to their Father        Upon the world's course:        That I might see its level sparkling strand,        It would be no cause of sorrow:      That I might hear the song of the wonderful birds,        Source of happiness:      That I might hear the thunder of the crowding waves        Upon the rocks:      That I might hear the roar by the side of the church        Of the surrounding sea:        . . . . .        That I might bless the Lord        Who conserves all,      Heaven with its countless bright orders,        Land, strand, and flood:        . . . . .        At times kneeling to beloved heaven:        At times at psalm singing:      At times contemplating the King of Heaven,        Holy the chief:      At times at work without compulsion;        This would be delightful.[204]    Thus Iona, the isle of the saints, the lamp lit amid the darkness of the  western sea, impressed the founder as he heard its voices. May there  soon be added another, the voice of the restored cathedral, connecting  the present with a glorious past, carrying us away in thought by its  architecture to earlier days, and by its situation to the hour when the  great apostle of the Picts first landed on its shores. This may at no  distant future be realised, since the late Duke of Argyll gifted the  ruined cathedral to the Church of Scotland, which hopes to do for it  what has already been done for Dunblane.      13. DIOCESE OF ORKNEY    Christianity reached the Orkneys through the labours of the Columban  clergy, and there are many traces in the islands that speak of their  work. Under the rule of the Norse, in the ninth and tenth centuries any  Christian influence that survived from the labours of such early  pioneers of the Christian faith must have died out. The first actual  Bishop of Orkney was William the Old, who was consecrated in 1102, held  the bishopric for sixty-six years, and died in 1168. His see was first  at Birsay, and was removed to Kirkwall on the erection of the cathedral  in 1137-1152. The Bishop of Orkney was one of the suffragans of the  metropolitan see at Throndhjeim, erected in 1154. In 1472 the see of  Orkney was placed under the metropolitan Bishop of St. Andrews.    The story of the foundation at Kirkwall is as follows. The possession of  the Orkneys was divided between two relatives, and about the beginning  of the twelfth century two cousins, Hacon and Magnus, shared the  government. In 1115 Magnus was treacherously slain at Egilsay by Hacon,  who thus obtained the whole earldom. Rognvald, son of Magnus' sister,  became a claimant for Magnus' share of the earldom, and vowed that if he  succeeded he would erect a \"stone minster\" in honour of his predecessor  St. Magnus, who had been canonised. Rognvald was successful, and  fulfilled his vow by founding at Kirkwall a cathedral dedicated to St.  Magnus. The building was designed and superintended by the Norwegian  Kol, the father of Rognvald; the relics of St. Magnus were brought from  Christ's Kirk in Birsay, to be deposited in the cathedral as soon as it  was prepared to receive them, and until the work was finished they  rested in the Church of St. Olaf, an older edifice which then existed in  Kirkwall.[205]    \"The Cathedral of St. Magnus was thus designed and erected by a  Norwegian earl, while the bishopric was under the authority of the  Norwegian Metropolitan of Throndhjeim. It is thus practically a  Norwegian edifice, and is by far the grandest monument of the rule of  the Norsemen in Orkney. In these circumstances, it is not to be expected  that the architecture should in every detail follow the contemporary  styles which prevailed in Britain, but it is astonishing to find how  closely the earlier parts correspond with the architecture of Normandy,  which was developed by a kindred race,--the successors of Rollo and his  rovers, who settled in that country at an earlier date. There can be  little doubt that the Romanesque architecture which prevailed in the  north of Europe found its way at a comparatively late date into  Scandinavia. The Norman form of that style would naturally follow the  same course amongst the kindred races in Norway and Denmark, just as it  did in England and Scotland, and from Norway it would be transplanted  into Scotland.\"[206] Kirkwall Cathedral, begun in 1137, was carried on  with great expedition, unlike Glasgow Cathedral, which took so long in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21692"],[0,"The Pirate City: An Algerine Tale (#15)"],[1,"devils in their cruelty.  They saw that I cared not for my  life, but they also saw that I suffered through my father, and at last  when _I_ became rebellious they beat _him_.  _That_ tamed me, and taught  me submission.  The old one who lies there was a friend and comrade in  sorrow of the dear father who was set free a year ago.  I lay thinking  of them both to-night, and when I saw you two taking the first steps on  the weary path which I have trod so long--and have now, methinks,  well-nigh finished--I could not restrain myself.  But go--get all the  rest you can.  We cannot afford to waste the hours in talk.  Only be  sure, lad, that you take the Jew's advice--submit.\"    Without replying, the father and son crept back to their hard couch.  Had they been in more comfortable circumstances their thoughts might  have caused them to toss in feverish restlessness, but sheer muscular  exhaustion, acting on healthy frames, caused them to fall at once into a  deep slumber, from which they were rudely aroused next morning at four  o'clock to proceed to the Marina, where they were to be engaged that day  on certain repairs connected with the bulwarks of the harbour.    On the way down they were joined by an old man in a semi-clerical  costume, whose gentle demeanour appeared to modify even the cruel nature  of their savage guards, for they ceased to crack their whips at his  approach, and treated him with marked respect.    Some of the slaves appeared to brighten into new creatures on beholding  him, and spoke to him in earnest tones, addressing him as Padre  Giovanni.    The padre had a consoling word for all, and appeared to be well  acquainted with the various languages in which they spoke.    Approaching Francisco and his son he walked beside them.    \"Thou hast arrived but recently, methinks?\" he said in a tone of  commiseration, \"and hast suffered much already.\"    \"Ay, we have suffered somewhat,\" replied Francisco in an off-hand tone,  not feeling much inclined to be communicative just then.    In a few minutes, however, Giovanni had ingratiated himself with the  Sicilians to such an extent that they had related all their sad history  to him, and already began to feel as if he were an old friend, before  they had traversed the half-mile that lay between their nightly prison  and the harbour.    Arrived at their place of toil--the artificial neck connecting the  little light-house island with the mainland,--Mariano was ordered to  convey large masses of stone for the supply of a gang of slaves who were  building a new face to the breakwater, while his father was harnessed,  with another gang, to the cart that conveyed the stones to their  destination along a temporary tramway.    The severity of the labour consisted chiefly in the intense heat under  which it was performed, and in the unremitting nature of it.  It must  not be imagined, however, that there was not a single touch of humanity  in the breasts of the cruel slave-drivers.  Hard task-masters though  they undoubtedly were, some of them were wont to turn aside and look  another way when any of the poor slaves sat down for a few minutes,  overcome with exhaustion.    There was little opportunity allowed, however, for intercourse among the  unfortunates.  One or two who, judging from their faces, showed  sympathetic leanings towards each other, were immediately observed and  separated.  This had the effect of hardening some, while it drove others  to despair.    One of those whose spirit seemed to vacillate between despair and  ferocity was the young man already referred to as being an inhabitant of  Francisco's part of the Bagnio.  He was a Portuguese, named Castello.  In carrying the stones to and fro, he and Mariano had to pass each other  regularly every three or four minutes.  The latter observed, after a  time, that Castello glanced at him with peculiar intelligence.  At first  he was puzzled, but on next passing him he determined to give him a  similar look.  He did so.  Next time that Castello passed he said, in a  low tone, without looking up, and without in the least checking his  pace--    \"Better to die than this!\"    Mariano was taken by surprise, and at first made no reply, for he  recalled the man's advice of the previous night, but, on passing the  Portuguese again, he said, in the same low tone--    \"Yes, much better!\"    Curious to know what was meant by this--for the tones and glances of  Castello were emphatic--Mariano kept on the alert as he repassed his  comrade, expecting more.  He was not disappointed, though the nature of  the communication tended to increase his surprise.    \"Fall and hurt yourself,\" whispered Castello, and passed on.    Much perplexed, Mariano tried to conceive some reason for such a strange  order, but failed.  He was, however, one of those rare spirits who have  the capacity, in certain circumstances, to sink themselves--not blindly,  but intelligently--and place implicit confidence in others.  Hastily  reviewing the _pros_ and _cons_ while laying his stone on the  breakwater, and feeling assured that no great harm could possibly come  of compliance, he gave a nod to his comrade in passing.    \"I want to speak to you,\" muttered Castello briefly.    At once the reason flashed on Mariano's mind.  The delay consequent on  the fall would afford opportunity for a few more sentences than it was  possible to utter in passing.    On returning, therefore, with a huge stone on his shoulder, just as he  passed his friend he fell with an admirable crash, and lay stunned on  the ground.    Castello instantly kneeled by his side and raised his head.    \"Ten of us,\" he said quickly, \"intend to make a dash for the Bab-el-Oued  gate on the way back to-night: join us.  It's neck or nothing.\"    \"I will, if my father agrees,\" said Mariano, still lying with closed  eyes--unconscious!    \"If he does, pull your hat on one side of your head as you--\" A  tremendous lash from a whip cut short the sentence, and caused Castello  to spring up.  \"Rise, you dog!\" cried the Turk who had bestowed it; \"are  Christians so delicate that they need to be nursed for every fall?\"    Castello hurried back to his work without a word of reply, and Mariano,  opportunely recovering, with a view to avoid a similar cut, staggered on  with his stone; but the Turk quickened his movements by a sharp flip on  the shoulder, which cut a hole in his shirt, and left a bright mark on  his skin.    For one moment the gush of the old fierce spirit almost overcame the  poor youth, but sudden reflection and certain tender sensations about  the soles of his feet came to his aid, in time to prevent a catastrophe.    When the slaves were collecting together that evening on the breakwater,  Mariano managed to get alongside of his father, who at first was very  unwilling to run the risk proposed.    \"It's not that I'm afraid o' my neck, lad,\" said the bluff merchant,  \"but I fear there is no chance for us, and they might visit their wrath  on poor Lucien.\"    \"No fear, father; I am convinced that the Dey has already found out his  value.  Besides, if we escape we shall be able to raise funds to ransom  him.\"    Francisco shook his head.    \"And what,\" said he, \"are we to do when we get clear out of the  Bab-el-Oued gate, supposing we are so far lucky?\"    \"Scatter, and make for the head of Frais Vallon,\" whispered Castello as  he passed.  \"A boat waits at Barbarossa's Tower.  Our signal is--\"    Here the Portuguese gave a peculiar whistle, which was too low to be  heard by the guards, who were busy marshalling the gang.    \"You'll agree, father?\" urged Mariano, entreatingly.    The merchant replied by a stern \"Yes\" as the gang was ordered to move  on.    Mariano instantly gave his straw hat a tremendous pull to one side, and  walked along with a glow of enthusiasm in his countenance.  One of the  guards, noting this, stepped forward and walked beside him.    \"So much the better,\" thought Mariano; \"there will be no time lost when  we grapple.\"    Traversing the passages of the mole, the gang passed into the town, and  commenced to thread those narrow streets which, to the present day,  spread in a labyrinth between the port and Bab-el-Oued.    As they passed through one of those streets which, being less frequented  than most of the others, was unusually quiet, a low hiss was heard.    At the moment Mariano chanced to be passing an open doorway which led,  by a flight of stairs, into a dark cellar.  Without an instant's  hesitation he tripped up his guard and hurled him headlong into the  cellar, where, to judge from the sounds, he fell among crockery and tin  pans.  At the same moment, Francisco hit a guard beside him such a blow  on the chest with his fist, as laid him quite helpless on the ground.    The other ten, who had been selected and let into the intended plot by  Castello on account of their superior physical powers, succeeded in  knocking down the guards in their immediate neighbourhood, and then all  of them dashed with headlong speed along the winding street.    There were one or two passengers and a few small shops in the street,  but the thing had been done so suddenly and with so little noise, that  the passengers and owners of the shops were not aware of what had  occurred until they beheld the twelve captives rush past them like a  torrent--each seizing, as he passed, a broom-handle, or any piece of  timber that might form a handy weapon.    Of course the other guards, and such of the maltreated ones as retained  consciousness, shouted loudly, but they did not dare to give chase, lest  the other slaves should take it into their heads to follow their  comrades.  Poor creatures! most of them were incapable of making such an  effort, and the few who might have joined had they known of the plot,  saw that it was too late, and remained still.    Thus it happened that the fugitives reached the northern gate of the  city before the alarm had been"]]]
