By their cheerful  twitterings and their vigilance in driving from the neighbourhood every  Hawk and Crow that ventures near, they not only repay the slight effort  made in their behalf, but endear themselves to the thrifty  chicken-raising farm-wives of the country.    If gourds or boxes cannot be found Martins will sometimes build about  the eaves of buildings or similar places.  They have learned that it is  wise to nest near human habitations.  At Plant City, Florida, one may  find their nests in the large electric arc-lights swinging in the  streets, and at Clearwater, Florida, and in Bismarck, North Dakota,  colonies nest under the projecting roofs of store buildings.    I have always been interested in finding nests of {138} birds, but I  think no success in this line ever pleased me quite so much as the  discovery of two pairs of Purple Martins making their nests one day in  May, down on the edge of the Everglade country in south Florida.  There  were no bird boxes or gourds for at least twenty or thirty miles  around, so the birds had appropriated some old Flicker nesting cavities  in dead trees, that is, one pair of the birds had appropriated a  disused hole, and the second pair was busy trying to carry nesting  material into a Flicker's nest from which the young birds had not yet  departed.  Here then were Martins preparing to carry on their domestic  duties just as they did back in the old primeval days.    The discussion of this subject could not well be closed without  mentioning the Chimney Swift that now almost universally glues to the  inner side of a chimney, or more rarely the inner wall of some  building, the few little twigs that constitute its nest.  It is only in  the remotest parts of the country that these birds still resort to  hollow trees for nesting purposes.  {139} There is--or was a few years  ago--a hollow cypress tree standing on the edge of Big Lake in North  Carolina which was used by a pair of Chimney Swifts, and it made one  feel as if he were living in primitive times to see these little dark  birds dart downward into a hollow tree, miles and miles away from any  friendly chimney.  Some day I hope to revisit the region and find this  natural nesting hollow still occupied by a pair of unmodernized Swifts.          {140}    CHAPTER VIII    THE TRAFFIC IN FEATHERS    The traffic in the feathers of American birds for the millinery trade  began to develop strongly about 1880 and assumed its greatest  proportions during the next ten years.  The wholesale milliners whose  business and pleasure it was to supply these ornaments for women's hats  naturally turned for their supply first to those species of birds most  easily procured.  Agents were soon going about the country looking for  men to kill birds for their feathers, and circulars and hand bills  offering attractive prices for feathers of various kinds were mailed  broadcast.  The first great onslaughts were made on the breeding  colonies of sea birds along the Atlantic Coast.  On Long Island there  were some very large communities of Terns and these were {141} quickly  raided.  The old birds were shot down and the unattended young  necessarily were left to starve.  Along the coast of Massachusetts the  sea birds suffered a like fate.  Maine with its innumerable out-lying  rocky islands was, as it is to-day, the chief nursery of the Herring  Gulls and Common Terns of the North Atlantic.  This fact was soon  discovered and thousands were slaughtered every summer, their wings cut  off, and their bodies left to rot among the nests on the rookeries.    _War on the Sea Swallows._--During a period of seven years more than  500,000 Terns', or Sea Swallows', skins were collected in spring and  summer in the sounds of North and South Carolina.  These figures I  compiled from the records and accounts given me by men who did the  killing.  Their method was to fit out small sailing vessels on which  they could live comfortably and cruise for several weeks; in fact, they  were usually out during the entire three months of the nesting period.  That was the time of year that offered best rewards for such work, for  then the birds' {142} feathers bore their brightest lustre, and the  birds being assembled on their nesting grounds they could easily be  shot in great numbers.  After the birds were killed the custom was to  skin them, wash off the blood stains with benzine, and dry the feathers  with plaster of Paris.  Arsenic was used for curing and preserving the  skins.  Men in this business became very skilful and rapid in their  work, some being able to prepare as many as one hundred skins in a day.    Millinery agents from New York would sometimes take skinners with them  and going to a favourable locality would employ local gunners to shoot  the birds which they in turn would skin.  In this way one New York  woman with some assistants collected and brought back from Cobbs'  Island, Virginia, 10,000 skins of the Least Tern in a single season.    In the swamps of Florida word was carried that the great millinery  trade of the North was bidding high for the feathers of those plume  birds which gave life and beauty even to its wildest regions.  It was  not long before the cypress fastnesses were echoing {143} to the roar  of breech-loaders, and cries of agony and piles of torn feathers became  common sounds and sights even in the remotest depths of the Everglades.  What mattered it if the semi-tropical birds of exquisite plumage were  swept from existence, if only the millinery trade might prosper!    The milliners were not content to collect their prey only in obscure  and little-known regions, for a chance was seen to commercialize the  small birds of the forests and fields.  Warblers, Thrushes, Wrens, in  fact all those small forms of dainty bird life which come about the  home to cheer the hearts of men and women and gladden the eyes of  little children, commanded a price if done to death and their pitiful  remains shipped to New York.    [Illustration: Terns, Formerly Sought by the Feather Trade]    Taxidermists, who made a business of securing birds and preparing their  skins, found abundant opportunity to ply their trade.  Never had the  business of taxidermy been so profitable as in those days.  For  example, in the spring of 1882 some of the feather agents established  themselves at points {144} on the New Jersey coast, and sent out word  to residents of the region that they would buy the bodies of freshly  killed birds of all kinds procurable.  The various species of Terns,  which were then abundant on the Jersey coast, offered the best  opportunity {145} for profit, for not only were they found in vast  numbers, but they were comparatively easy to shoot.  Ten cents apiece  was the price paid, and so lucrative a business did the shooting of  these birds become that many baymen gave up their usual occupation of  sailing pleasure parties and became gunners.  These men often earned as  much as one hundred dollars a week for their skill with the shotgun.    [Illustration: A Christmas dinner for the birds.  Note the Song Sparrow  on a Sunflower head and a Chickadee weighing himself.  Photographed by  Mrs. Granville Pike]    It is not surprising that at the end of the season a local observer  reported: \"One cannot help noticing now the scarcity of Terns on the  New Jersey coast, and it is all owing to their merciless destruction.\"  One might go further and give the sickening details of how the birds  were swept from the mud flats about the mouth of the Mississippi and  the innumerable shell lumps of the Chandeleurs and the Breton Island  region; how the Great Lakes were bereft of their feathered life, and  the swamps of the Kankakee were invaded; how the White Pelicans,  Western Grebes, Caspian Terns, and California Gulls of the West were  butchered and their skinned {146} bodies left in pyramids to fester in  the sun.  One might recount stories of Bluebirds and Robins shot on the  very lawns of peaceful, bird-loving citizens of our Eastern States in  order that the feathers might be spirited away to feed the insatiable  appetite of the wholesale milliner dealers.  Never have birds been worn  in this country in such numbers as in those days.  Ten or fifteen small  song birds' skins were often sewed on a single hat!    _What the Ladies Wore._--In 1886 Dr. Frank M. Chapman walked through  the shopping district of New York City on his way home, two afternoons  in succession, and carefully observed the feather decorations on the  hats of the women he chanced to meet.  The result of his observation,  as reported to _Forest and Stream_, shows that he found in common use  as millinery trimming many highly esteemed birds as the following list  which he wrote down at the time will serve to show:    Robins, Thrushes, Bluebirds, Tanagers, Swallows, {147} Warblers,  Waxwings, Bobolinks, Larks, Orioles, Doves, and Woodpeckers.    In all, the feathers of at least forty species were discernible.    In commenting on his trips of inspection, Doctor Chapman wrote: \"It is  evident that in proportion to the number of hats seen, the list of  birds given is very small, for in most cases mutilation rendered  identification impossible.  Thus, while one afternoon seven hundred  hats were counted and on them but twenty birds recognized, five hundred  and forty-two were decorated with feathers of some kind.  Of the one  hundred and fifty-eight remaining, seventy-two were worn by young or  middle-aged ladies, and eighty-six by ladies in mourning or elderly  ladies.\"    This was a period when people seemed to go mad on the subject of  wearing birds and feathers.  They were used for feminine adornment in  almost every conceivable fashion.  Here are two quotations from New  York daily papers of that time, only the names {148} of the ladies are  changed: \"Miss Jones looked "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21012"],[0,"The Loyalists of America and Their Times, Vol. 1 of 2. (#15)"],[1,"and  proscribing the worship of the Church of England in New England; for Mr.  White himself, the projector and animating spirit of the whole  enterprise, was a conformist clergyman.[24] It was professedly a  religio-commercial undertaking, and combined for its support and  advancement the motives of religion and commerce, together with the  enlargement of the Empire.    For greater security and more imposing dignity, the \"adventurers\"  determined to apply for a Royal Charter of incorporation. Their  application was seconded by Lord Dorchester and others near the Throne;  and Charles the First, impressed with the novel idea of at once  extending religion, commerce, and his Empire, granted a Royal Patent  incorporating the Company under the name of \"The Governor and Company of  Massachusetts Bay, in New England.\" But several months before the Royal  Charter was obtained, or even application for it made, Endicot, one of  the stockholders, was sent out with a ship of one hundred emigrants,  and, in consequence of his favourable report, application was made for a  Royal Charter.[25]    It was the conduct of Endicot, a few months after his arrival at  Massachusetts Bay--first condemned and afterwards sustained and  justified by the Directors of the Corporation in London--that laid the  foundation of the future Church history of New England, and of its  disputes with the mother country. Endicot and his one hundred emigrant  adventurers arrived in the summer of 1628, and selected Naumkeag, which  they called Salem, as their place of settlement, the 6th of September.  Endicot was sent, with his company, by the Council for New England, \"to  supersede Roger Conant at Naumkeag as local manager.\"[26] \"The colony,  made up of two sources, consisted of not much above fifty or sixty  persons, none of whom were of special importance except Endicot, who was  destined to act for nearly forty years a conspicuous part in New England  history.\"[27] The Royal Charter passed the seals the 4th of March, 1629,  with Mr. Cradock as the first Governor of the Company. \"The first step  of the new Corporation was to organize a government for its colony. It  determined to place the local administration in the hands of thirteen  councillors, to retain their office for one year. Of these, seven,  besides the Governor (in which office Endicot was continued), were to be  appointed by the Company at home; these eight were to choose three  others; and the whole number was to be made up by the addition of such  as should be designated by the persons on the spot at the time of  Endicot's arrival, described as \"old planters.\"[28] A second embarkation  of planters and servants was ordered by the Company at a meeting, April  30, 1629, shortly after its incorporation by Royal Charter. Five ships  were provided for this embarkation; and four ministers were  provided--Francis Higginson, Samuel Skelton, Francis Bright, and Ralph  Smith.[29] Mr. Higginson says in his journal that he sailed from the  Isle of Wight the 11th of May, and arrived at Cape Ann the 27th of June,  and at Naumkeag (Salem) the 29th. They found at Naumkeag about one  hundred planters and houses, besides a fair house built for Mr. Endicot.  The old and new planters together were about three hundred, of whom one  hundred removed to Charlestown, where there was a house built; the rest  remained at Salem.    \"Mr. Endicot had corresponded with the settlers at Plymouth, who  satisfied him that they were right in their judgments of the outward  form of worship, being much like that of the Reformed Churches of  France, &c. On the 20th of July, Mr. Higginson and Mr. Skelton, after  fasting and prayer, were first elected by the Company for their  ministers--the first, teacher; the other, pastor. Each of them, together  with three or four grave members, lay their hands on each and either,  with solemn prayer. Nothing is said of any Church being formed; but on  the 6th of August, the day appointed for the choice and ordination of  elders and deacons, thirty persons entered into a covenant in writing,  which is said to be the beginning of the Church, and that the ministers  were ordained or instituted anew. The repetition of this form they  probably thought necessary, because the people were not in a Church  state before. It is difficult to assign any other reason. Messengers or  delegates from the Church of Plymouth were expected to join with them,  but contrary winds hindered them, so that they did not arrive until the  afternoon, but time enough to give the right hand of fellowship.    \"Two of the company, John and Samuel Brown, one a lawyer, the other a  merchant, both men of good estates, and of the first patentees of the  Council, were dissatisfied. They did not like that the Common Prayer and  service of the Church of England should be wholly laid aside, and  therefore drew off, with as many as were of their sentiments, from the  rest, and set up a separate society. This offended the Governor, who  caused the two members of his Council to be brought before him; and  judging that this practice, together with some speeches they had  uttered, tended to sedition, he sent them back to England. The heads of  the party being removed, the opposition ceased.\"[30]      PART II.    THE QUESTION INVOLVING THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION, THE  SETTING UP OF A NEW FORM OF WORSHIP, AND ABOLISHING AND PROSCRIBING THAT  OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND; THE FACTS ANALYZED AND DISCUSSED; INSTRUCTIONS  AND OATHS OF ALLEGIANCE ORDERED BY THE LONDON COMPANY AND DISREGARDED BY  THE GOVERNOR AND COUNCIL AT MASSACHUSETTS BAY.      As the whole question of the future Church-state in Massachusetts, and  the future relations of the colony to England, is involved in and  resulted from this proceeding, it is necessary to examine it thoroughly  in relation both to the state of things in the mother country and in the  colony, as well as the provisions of the Royal Charter. To do this,  several things are to be considered: 1. With what views was the Royal  Charter granted, and with what professed views did the first Governor  and his associates leave England under the provisions of the Charter,  and carrying it with them to Massachusetts Bay? 2. What were the  provisions of the Charter itself on the subject of religion? 3. What  were the powers claimed and exercised under it by the Massachusetts  Puritans? 4. How far the proceedings of the Massachusetts Puritans were  consistent with their original professions, with good faith towards the  Mother Country, and with the principles of civil and religious liberty  in the colony?    A careful recollection of the collateral events in England and those of  the colony, at the time and after granting the Royal Charter, is  requisite to a correct understanding of the question, and for the  refutation of those statements by which it was misrepresented and  misunderstood.    1. The first question is, with what views was the Royal Charter granted,  and with what professed views did the Governor and his associates leave  England under the provisions of the Charter, and carrying it with them  to Massachusetts Bay?    The theory of some New England historians is, that Puritanism in England  was opposed to the Church of England, and especially to its Episcopal  government--a theory true as respects the Puritanism of the Long  Parliament after the second year of its existence, and of the  Commonwealth and Cromwell, but which is entirely at variance with facts  in respect to the Puritanism professed in England at the time of  granting the Royal Charter to the Massachusetts Company in 1620, and for  twelve years afterwards. In the Millenary Petition presented by the  Puritan party in the Church to James the First, on his coming to the  throne, presbytery was expressly disclaimed; and in the first three  Parliaments of Charles the First, during which all the grievances  complained of by the Puritans were stated and discussed in the Commons,  not the slightest objection was made to Episcopacy, but, on the  contrary, reverence and fidelity in regard to it was professed without  exception; and when the Long Parliament first met, eleven years after  the granting of the Royal Charter to the Massachusetts Bay Company,  every member but one professed to be an Episcopalian, and the Holy  Communion, according to the order of the Church, was, by an unanimous  vote of the Commons, ordered to be partaken by each member. In all the  Church, as well as judicial and political, reforms of this Parliament  during its first session, Episcopacy was regarded and treated as  inviolate; and it was not until the following year, under the promptings  of the Scotch Commissioners, that the \"root and branch\" petition was  presented to Parliament against Episcopacy and the Prayer Book, and the  subject was discussed in the Commons. The theory, therefore, that  Puritanism in England was hostile to the Church at the period in  question is contradicted by all the \"collateral\" facts of English  history, as it is at variance with the professions of the first  Massachusetts Puritans themselves at the time of their leaving England.    This is true in respect to Endicot himself, who was appointed manager of  the New England Company, to succeed Roger Conant, and in charge of one  hundred \"adventurers\" who reached Naumkeag (which they called Salem) in  September, 1628--seven months before the Royal Charter granted by  Charles the First passed the seals. Within two months after the Royal  Charter was granted, another more numerous party of \"adventurers\"  embarked for New England, and among these two gentlemen, original  patentees and members of the Council--John and Samuel Brown, and four  ministers--Higginson, Skelton, Bright, and Smith. During the winter of  1628-9 much sickness prevailed among the emigrants who accompanied  Endicot, who sent for a physician to the Plymouth settlement of the  Pilgrim Fathers. A Doctor"]]]
