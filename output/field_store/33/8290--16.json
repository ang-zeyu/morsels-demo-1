Thus from this monster the present race  of bears derives its origin.    Having overcome their pursuer the brothers returned to the lodge, and  the girl gathered together the articles she had used, and placed the  head in the sack again. The head remained silent, probably from its  being fatigued with its exertion in overcoming the bear.    Having spent so much time, and having traversed so vast a country in  their flight, the young men gave up the idea of ever returning to  their own country, and game being plentiful about the lodge, they  determined to remain where they were. One day they moved off some  distance from the lodge for the purpose of hunting, and left the belt  with the girl. They were very successful, and amused themselves with  talking and jesting. One of them said--    \"We have all this sport to ourselves. Let us go and ask our sister if  she will not let us bring the head to this place, for it is still  alive.\"    So they went and asked for the head. The girl told them to take it,  and they carried it to their hunting-grounds and tried to amuse it,  but only at times did they see its eyes beam with pleasure. One day,  while they were busy in their encampment, they were unexpectedly  attacked by unknown enemies. The fight was long and fierce. Many of  the foes were slain, but there were thirty of them to each warrior.  The young men fought desperately till they were all killed, and then  the attacking party retreated to a high place to muster their men and  count the missing and the slain. One of the men had strayed away, and  happened to come to where the head was hung up. Seeing that it was  alive he eyed it for some time with fear and surprise. Then he took it  down, and having opened the sack he was much pleased to see the  beautiful feathers, one of which he placed on his head.    It waved gracefully over him as he walked to his companions' camp,  and when he came there he threw down the head and sack and told his  friends how he had found them, and how the sack was full of paints and  feathers. The men all took the head and made sport of it. Many of the  young men took the paint and painted themselves with it; and one of  the band, taking the head by the hair, said--    \"Look, you ugly thing, and see your paints on the faces of warriors.\"    The feathers were so beautiful that many of the young men placed them  on their heads, and they again subjected the head to all kinds of  indignity. They were, however, soon punished for their insulting  conduct, for all who had worn the feathers became sick and died. Then  the chief commanded the men to throw all the paints and feathers away.    \"As for the head,\" he said, \"we will keep that and take it home with  us; we will there see what we can do with it. We will try to make it  shut its eyes.\"    Meanwhile for several days the sister had been waiting for the  brothers to bring back the head; till at last, getting impatient, she  went in search of them. She found them lying within short distances of  one another, dead, and covered with wounds. Other bodies lay scattered  around. She searched for the head and sack, but they were nowhere to  be found, so she raised her voice and wept, and blackened her face.  Then she walked in different directions till she came to the place  whence the head had been taken, and there she found the bow and  arrows, which had been left behind. She searched further, hoping to  find her brother's head, and, when she came to a piece of rising  ground she found some of his paints and feathers. These she carefully  put by, hanging them to the branch of a tree.    At dusk she came to the first lodge of a large village. Here she used  a charm employed by Indians when they wish to meet with a kind  reception, and on applying to the old man and the woman who occupied  the lodge she was made welcome by them. She told them her errand, and  the old man, promising to help her, told her that the head was hung up  before the council fire, and that the chiefs and young men of the  village kept watch over it continually. The girl said she only desired  to see the head, and would be satisfied if she could only get to the  door of the lodge in which it was hung, for she knew she could not  take it by force.    \"Come with me,\" said the old man, \"I will take you there.\"    So they went and took their seats in the lodge near to the door. The  council lodge was filled with warriors amusing themselves with games,  and constantly keeping up the fire to smoke the head to dry it. As the  girl entered the lodge the men saw the features of the head move, and,  not knowing what to make of it, one spoke and said--    \"Ha! ha! it is beginning to feel the effects of the smoke.\"    The sister looked up from the seat by the door; her eyes met those of  her brother, and tears began to roll down the cheeks of the head.    \"Well,\" said the chief, \"I thought we would make you do something at  last. Look! look at it shedding tears,\" said he to those around him,  and they all laughed and made jokes upon it. The chief, looking  around, observed the strange girl, and after some time said to the old  man who brought her in--    \"Who have you got there? I have never seen that woman before in our  village.\"    \"Yes,\" replied the old man, \"you have seen her. She is a relation of  mine, and seldom goes out. She stays in my lodge, and she asked me to  bring her here.\"    In the centre of the lodge sat one of those young men who are always  forward, and fond of boasting and displaying themselves before others.    \"Why,\" said he, \"I have seen her often, and it is to his lodge I go  almost every night to court her.\"    All the others laughed and continued their games. The young man did  not know he was telling a lie to the girl's advantage, who by means of  it escaped.    She returned to the old man's lodge, and immediately set out for her  own country. Coming to the spot where the bodies of her adopted  brothers lay, she placed them together with their feet towards the  east. Then taking an axe she had she cast it up into the air, crying  out--    \"Brothers, get up from under it or it will fall on you!\"    This she repeated three times, and the third time all the brothers  rose and stood on their feet. Mudjikewis commenced rubbing his eyes  and stretching himself.    \"Why,\" said he, \"I have overslept myself.\"    \"No, indeed,\" said one of the others. \"Do you not know we were all  killed, and that it is our sister who has brought us to life?\"    The brothers then took the bodies of their enemies and burned them.  Soon after the girl went to a far country, they knew not where, to  procure wives for them, and she returned with the women, whom she gave  to the young men, beginning with the eldest. Mudjikewis stepped to and  fro, uneasy lest he should not get the one he liked, but he was not  disappointed, for she fell to his lot; and the two were well matched,  for she was a female magician.    The young men and their wives all moved into a very large lodge, and  their sister told them that one of the women must go in turns every  night to try and recover the head of her brother, untying the knots by  which it was hung up in the council lodge. The women all said they  would go with pleasure. The eldest made the first attempt. With a  rushing noise she disappeared through the air.    Towards daylight she returned. She had failed, having only succeeded  in untying one of the knots. All the women save the youngest went in  turn, and each one succeeded in untying only one knot each time. At  length the youngest went. As soon as she arrived at the lodge she went  to work. The smoke from the fire in the lodge had not ascended for ten  nights. It now filled the place and drove all the men out. The girl  was alone, and she carried off the head.    The brothers and Iamo's sister heard the young woman coming high  through the air, and they heard her say--    \"Prepare the body of our brother.\"    As soon as they heard that they went to where Iamo's body lay, and,  having got it ready, as soon as the young woman arrived with the head  they placed it to the body, and Iamo was restored in all his former  manliness and beauty. All rejoiced in the happy termination of their  troubles, and when they had spent some time joyfully together, Iamo  said--    \"Now I will divide the treasure,\" and taking the bear's belt he  commenced dividing what it contained amongst the brothers, beginning  with the eldest. The youngest brother, however, got the most splendid  part of the spoil, for the bottom of the belt held what was richest  and rarest.    Then Iamo told them that, since they had all died and been restored to  life again, they were no longer mortals but spirits, and he assigned  to each of them a station in the invisible world. Only Mudjikewis'  place was, however, named. He was to direct the west wind. The  brothers were commanded, as they had it in their power, to do good to  the inhabitants of the earth, and to give all things with a liberal  hand.    The spirits then, amid songs and shouts, took their flight to their  respective places, while Iamo and his sister, Iamoqua, descended into  the depths below.          THE OLD CHIPPEWAY.      The old man Chippeway, the first of men, when he first landed on the  earth, near where the present Dogribs have their hunting-grounds,  found the world a beautiful world, well stocked with food, and  abounding with pleasant things. He found no man, woman, or child upon  it; but in time, being lonely, he created children, to whom he gave  two kinds of fruit, the black and the white, but he forbade them to  eat the black. Having given his commands for the government and  guidance of his family, he took leave of them for a time, to go into a  far country where the sun dwelt, for the purpose of bringing it to the  earth.    After a very long journey, and a long absence, he returned, bringing  with him the sun, and he was delighted to find that"]]]
