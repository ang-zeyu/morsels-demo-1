[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22728"],[0,"The Foundations of the Origin of Species (#15)"],[1," see it clearly in cases of cattle, which differ obviously in  shape and length of horns. If man were during 10,000 years to be able to  select, far more diverse animals from horse or cow, I should expect  there would be far less differences in the very young and foetal state:  and this, I think, throws light on above marvellous fact. In larvae,  which have long life selection, perhaps, does much,--in the pupa not so  much{164} There is no object gained in varying form &c. of foetus  (beyond certain adaptations to mother's womb) and therefore selection  will not further act on it, than in giving to its changing tissues a  tendency to certain parts afterwards to assume certain forms.         {160} The following: \"Deaths of brothers <when> old by same peculiar       disease\" which is written between the lines seems to have been a       memorandum which is expanded a few lines lower. I believe the case       of the brothers came from Dr R. W. Darwin.         {161} See the discussion to this effect in the _Origin_, Ed. i. pp.       443-4, vi. p. 610. The author there makes the distinction between a       cause affecting the germ-cell and the reaction occurring at a late       period of life.         {162} Possibly the sentence was meant to end \"is not visible till       then.\"         {163} See _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 444-5, vi. p. 611. The query       appended to _much less_ is justified, since measurement was       necessary to prove that the greyhound and bulldog puppies had not       nearly acquired \"their full amount of proportional difference.\"         {164} <The following discussion, from the back of the page, is in       large measure the same as the text.> I think light can be thrown on       these facts. From the following peculiarities being hereditary, [we       know that some change in the germinal vesicle is effected, which       will only betray itself years after] diseases--man, goitre, gout,       baldness, fatness, size, [longevity <illegible> time of reproduction,       shape of horns, case of old brothers dying of same disease]. And we       know that the germinal vesicle must have been affected, though no       effect is apparent or can be apparent till years afterwards,--no       more apparent than when these peculiarities appear by the exposure       of the full-grown individual. <That is, \"the young individual is as       apparently free from the hereditary changes which will appear       later, as the young is actually free from the changes produced by       exposure to certain conditions in adult life.\"> So that when we see       a variety in cattle, even if the variety be due to act of       reproduction, we cannot feel sure at what period this change became       apparent. It may have been effected during early age of free life       <or> foetal existence, as monsters show. From arguments before used,       and crossing, we may generally suspect in germ; but I repeat it       does not follow, that the change should be apparent till life fully       developed; any more than fatness depending on heredity should be       apparent during early childhood, still less during foetal       existence. In case of horns of cattle, which when inherited must       depend on germinal vesicle, obviously no effect till cattle       full-grown. Practically it would appear that the [hereditary]       peculiarities characterising our domestic races, therefore       resulting from vesicle, do not appear with their full characters       in very early states; thus though two breeds of cows have calves       different, they are not so different,--grey-hound and bull-dog.       And this is what is <to> be expected, for man is indifferent to       characters of young animals and hence would select those full-grown       animals which possessed the desirable characteristics. So that from       mere chance we might expect that some of the characters would be       such only as became fully apparent in mature life. Furthermore we       may suspect it to be a law, that at whatever time a new character       appears, whether from vesicle, or effects of external conditions,       it would appear at corresponding time <see _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 444>.       Thus diseases appearing in old age produce children with d^o.,--early       maturity,--longevity,--old men, brothers, of same disease--young       children of d^o. I said men do not select for quality of       young,--calf with big bullocks. Silk-worms, peculiarities which,       appear in caterpillar state or cocoon state, are transmitted to       corresponding states. The effect of this would be that if some       peculiarity was born in a young animal, but never exercised, it       might be inherited in young animal; but if exercised that part of       structure would be increased and would be inherited in       corresponding time of life after such training.         I have said that man selects in full-life, so would it be in       Nature. In struggle of existence, it matters nothing to a feline       animal, whether kitten eminently feline, as long as it sucks.       Therefore natural selection would act equally well on character       which was fully <developed> only in full age. Selection could tend       to alter no character in foetus, (except relation to mother) it would       alter less in young state (putting on one side larva condition) but       alter every part in full-grown condition. Look to a foetus and its       parent, and again after ages foetus and its <i. e. the above       mentioned parents> descendant; the parent more variable <?> than       foetus, which explains all.]    Thus there is no power to change the course of the arteries, as long as  they nourish the foetus; it is the selection of slight changes which  supervene at any time during <illegible> of life.    The less differences of foetus,--this has obvious meaning on this view:  otherwise how strange that a [monkey] horse, a man, a bat should at one  time of life have arteries, running in a manner, which is only  intelligibly useful in a fish! The natural system being on theory  genealogical, we can at once see, why foetus, retaining traces of the  ancestral form, is of the highest value in classification.      Sec. IX. <ABORTIVE ORGANS.>    There is another grand class of facts relating to what are called  abortive organs. These consist of organs which the same reasoning power  that shows us how beautifully these organs in some cases are adapted to  certain end, declares in other cases are absolutely useless. Thus teeth  in Rhinoceros{165}, whale, narwhal,--bone on tibia, muscles which do not  move,--little bone of wing of Apteryx,--bone representing extremities in  some snake,--little wings within <?> soldered cover of beetles,--men and  bulls, mammae: filaments without anthers in plants, mere scales  representing petals in others, in feather-hyacinth whole flower. Almost  infinitely numerous. No one can reflect on these without astonishment,  can anything be clearer than that wings are to fly and teeth <to bite>,  and yet we find these organs perfect in every detail in situations where  they cannot possibly be of their normal use{166}.         {165} Some of these examples occur in _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 450-51,       vi. pp. 619-20.         {166} The two following sentences are written, one down the margin,       the other across the page. \"Abortive organs eminently useful in       classification. Embryonic state of organs. Rudiments of organs.\"    The term abortive organ has been thus applied to above structure (as  _invariable_ as all other parts{167}) from their absolute similarity to  monstrous cases, where from _accident_, certain organs are not  developed; as infant without arms or fingers with mere stump  representing them: teeth represented by mere points of ossification:  headless children with mere button,--viscera represented by small  amorphous masses, &c.,--the tail by mere stump,--a solid horn by minute  hanging one{168}. There is a tendency in all these cases, when life is  preserved, for such structures to become hereditary. We see it in  tailless dogs and cats. In plants we see this strikingly,--in Thyme, in  _Linum flavum_,--stamen in _Geranium pyrenaicum_{169}. Nectaries abort  into petals in Columbine <_Aquilegia_>, produced from some accident and  then become hereditary, in some cases only when propagated by buds, in  other cases by seed. These cases have been produced suddenly by accident  in early growth, but it is part of law of growth that when any organ is  not used it tends to diminish (duck's wing{170}?) muscles of dog's ears,  <and of> rabbits, muscles wither, arteries grow up. When eye born  defective, optic nerve (Tuco Tuco) is atrophied. As every part whether  useful or not (diseases, double flowers) tends to be transmitted to  offspring, the origin of abortive organs whether produced at the birth  or slowly acquired is easily understood in domestic races of organisms:  [a struggle between the atrophy and hereditariness. Abortive organs in  domestic races.] There will always be a struggle between atrophy of an  organ rendered useless, and hereditariness{171}. Because we can  understand the origin of abortive organs in certain cases, it would be  wrong to conclude absolutely that all must have had same origin, but the  strongest analogy is in favour of it. And we can by our theory, for  during infinite changes some organ, we might have anticipated, would  have become useless. <We can> readily explain the fact, so astounding  on any other view, namely that organs possibly useless have been formed  often with the same exquisite care as when of vital importance.         {167} I imagine the meaning to be that abortive organs are specific       characters in contrast to monstrosities.         {168} Minute hanging horns are mentioned in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p.       454, vi. p. 625, as occurring in hornless breeds of cattle.         {169} _Linum flavum_ is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2273"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Motor-Boat; Or, The Rivals of Lake Carlopa (#15)"],[1,"some friends were going on a little cruise and might not be back  to-night.\"    \"Did he say where he was going?\" asked our hero, who did not tell  Andy's mother why he wanted to see her son.    \"No, and I'm worried about him.  Sometimes I think Andy is too--well,  too impetuous, and I'm afraid he will get into trouble.\"    Tom, in spite of his trouble, could hardly forbear smiling.  Andy's  mother was totally unaware of the mean traits of her son and thought  him a very fine chap.  Tom was not going to undeceive her.    \"I'm afraid something will happen to him,\" she went on.  \"Do you think  there is any danger being out on the lake in a motor-boat, Mr. Swift?  I understand you have one.\"    \"Yes, I have one,\" answered Tom.  He was going to say he had once had  one, but thought better of it.  \"No, there is very little danger this  time of year,\" he added.    \"I am very glad to hear you say so,\" went on Mrs. Foger with a sigh.  \"I shall feel more at ease when Andy is away now.  When he returns  home, I shall tell him you called upon him and he will return your  visit.  I am glad to see that the custom of paying calls has not died  out among the present generation.  It is a pleasant habit, and I am  glad to have my son conform to it.  He shall return your kind visit.\"    \"Oh, no, it's of no consequence,\" replied Tom quickly, thinking grimly  that his visit was far from a friendly one.  \"There is no need to tell  your son I was here.  I will probably see him in a day or two.    \"Oh, but I shall tell him,\" insisted Mrs. Foger with a kind smile.  \"I'm sure he will appreciate your call.\"    There was much doubt concerning this in the mind of the young inventor,  but he did not express it and soon took his leave.  Up and down the  lake for the rest of the day he cruised, looking in vain for a sight of  Andy Foger in the RED STREAK, but the racing boat appeared to be well  hidden.    \"If I only could find where they've taken mine,\" mused Tom.  \"Hang it  all, this is rotten luck!\" and for the first time he began to feel  discouraged.    \"Maybe you'd better notify the police,\" suggested Mr. Jackson when Tom  returned to the Swift house that night.  \"They might help locate it.\"    \"I think I can do as well as the police,\" answered the youth.  \"If the  boat is anywhere it's on the lake, and the police have no craft in  which to make a search.\"    \"That's so,\" agreed the engineer.  \"I wish I could help you, but I  don't believe it would be wise for me to leave the house, especially  since those men have been about lately.\"    \"No, you must stay here,\" was Tom's opinion.  \"I'll take another day or  two to search.  By this time Andy and his gang will return, I'm sure,  and I can tackle them.\"    \"Suppose they don't?\"    \"Well, then I'll make a tour of the lake in my sailboat and I'll run up  to Sandport and tell dad, for he will wonder what's keeping me.  I'll  know better next time than to leave my boat at the dock without taking  out the connection at the spark coil, so no one can start the motor.  I  should have done that at first, but you always think of those things  afterward.\"    The lad began his search again the next morning and cruised about in  little bays and gulfs looking for a sight of the RED STREAK or the  ARROW, but he saw neither, and a call at Andy's house showed that the  red-haired youth had not returned.  Mrs. Foger was quite nervous over  her son's continued absence, but Mr. Foger thought it was all right.    Another day passed without any results and the young inventor was  getting so nervous, partly with worrying over the loss of his boat and  partly on his father's account, that he did not know what to do.    \"I can't stand it any longer,\" he announced to Mrs. Baggert the night  of the third day, after a telephone message had been received from Mr.  Swift.  The inventor wanted to know why his son did not return to the  hotel to join him and Ned.  \"Well, what will you do?\" asked the  housekeeper.    \"If I don't find my boat to-morrow, I'll sail to Sandport, bring home  dad and Ned and we three will go all over the lake.  My boat must be on  it somewhere, but Lake Carlopa is so cut up that it could easily be  hidden.\"    \"It's queer that the Foger boy doesn't come home.  That makes it look  as if he was guilty.\"    \"Oh, I'm sure he took it all right,\" returned Tom.  \"All I want is to  see him.  It certainly is queer that he stays away as long as he does.  Sam Snedecker and Pete Bailey are with him, too.  But they'll have to  return some time.\"    Tom dreamed that night of finding his boat and that it was a wreck.  He  awoke, glad to find that the latter part was not true, but wishing that  some of his night vision might come to pass during the day.    He started out right after breakfast, and, as usual, headed for the  Foger home.  He almost disliked to ask Mrs. Foger if her son had yet  returned, for Andy's mother was so polite and so anxious to know  whether any danger threatened that Tom hardly knew how to answer her.  But he was saved that embarrassment on this occasion, for as he was  going up the walk from the lake to the residence he met the gardener  and from him learned that Andy had not yet come back.    \"But his mother had a message from him, I did hear,\" went on the man.  \"He's on his way.  It seems he had some trouble.\"    \"Trouble.  What kind of trouble?\" asked Tom.    \"I don't rightly know, sir, but,\" and here the gardener winked his eye,  \"Master Andy isn't particular what kind of trouble he gets into.\"    \"That's right,\" agreed our hero, and as he went down again to where he  had left his boat he thought: \"Nor what kind of trouble he gets other  people into.  I wish I had hold of him for about five minutes!\"    The sailboat swung slowly from the dock and heeled over to the gentle  breeze.  Hardly knowing what to do, Tom headed for the middle of the  lake.  He was discouraged and tired of making plans only to have them  fail.    As he looked across the stretch of water he saw a boat coming toward  him.  He shaded his eyes with his hand to see better, and then, with a  pair of marine glasses, took an observation.  He uttered an exclamation.    \"That's the RED STREAK as sure as I'm alive!\" he cried.  \"But what's  the matter with her?  They're rowing!\"    The lad headed his boat toward the approaching one.  There was no doubt  about it.  It was Andy Foger's craft, but it was not speeding forward  under the power of the motor.  Slowly and laborious the occupants were  pulling it along, and as it was not meant to be rowed, progress was  very slow.    \"They've had a breakdown,\" thought Tom. \"Serves 'em right!  Now wait  till I tackle 'em and find out where my boat is.  I've a good notion to  have Andy Foger arrested!\"    The sailing craft swiftly approached the motor-boat.  Tom could see the  three occupants looking at him, apprehensively as well as curiously, he  thought.    \"Guess they didn't think I'd keep after 'em,\" mused the young inventor,  and a little later he was beside the RED STREAK.    \"Well,\" cried Tom angrily, \"it's about time you came back!\"    \"We've had a breakdown,\" remarked Andy, and he seemed quite humiliated.  He was beginning to find out that he didn't know as much about a  motor-boat as he thought he did.    \"I've been waiting for you,\" went on Tom.    \"Waiting for us?  What for?\" asked Sam Snedecker.    \"What for?  As if you didn't know!\" blurted out the owner of the ARROW.  \"I want my boat, Andy Foger, the one you stole from me and hid!  Tell  me where it is at once or I'll have you arrested!\"    \"Your boat!\" repeated the bully, and there was no mistaking the  surprise in his tones.    \"Yes, my boat!  Don't try to bluff me like that.\"    \"I'm not trying to bluff you.  We've been away, three days and just got  back.\"    \"Yes, I know you have.  You took my boat with you, too.\"    \"Are you crazy?\" demanded Pete Bailey.    \"No, but you fellows must have been to think you could take my boat and  me not know it,\" and Tom, filled with wrath, grasped the gunwale of the  RED STREAK as if he feared it would suddenly shoot away.    \"Look here!\" burst out Andy, and he spoke sincerely, \"we didn't touch  your boat.  Did we, fellows?\"    \"No!\" exclaimed Sam and Pete at once, and they were very much in  earnest.    \"We didn't even know it was stolen, did we?\" went on Andy.    \"No,\" agreed his chums.  Tom looked unconvinced.    \"We haven't taken your boat and we can prove it,\" continued the bully.  \"I know you and I have had quarrels, but I'm telling you the truth, Tom  Swift.  I never touched your boat.\"    There was no mistaking the sincerity of Andy.  He was not a skilful  deceiver, and Tom, looking into his squint-eyes, which were opened  unusually wide, could not but help believing the fellow.    \"We haven't seen it since the day we had the collision,\" added Andy,  and his chums confirmed this statement.    \"We went off on a little cruise,\" continued the red-haired bully, \"and  broke down several times.  We had bad luck.  Just as we were nearing  home something went wrong with the engine again.  I never saw such a  poor motor.  But we never took your boat, Tom Swift, and we can prove  it.\"    Tom was in despair.  He had been so sure that Andy was the thief, that  to believe otherwise was difficult.  Yet he felt that he must.  He  looked at the disabled motor of the RED STREAK and viewed it with the  interested and expert eye of a machinist, no matter if the owner of it  was his enemy.  Then suddenly a brilliant idea came into Tom's head.          CHAPTER XVI    STILL ON THE SEARCH      \"You seem to have lots of trouble with your boat, Andy,\" said Tom after  a few moments of rather embarrassed silence.    \"I do,\" admitted the owner of the RED STREAK.  \"I've had bad luck ever  since I got it, but usually I've been able to fix it by looking in the  book.  This time I can't find out what the trouble is, nor can any of  the fellows.  It stopped when we were out in the middle"]]]
