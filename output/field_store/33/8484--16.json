'The Veterinary' London volume  5 page 543.) asserts that not unfrequently there are nineteen, the  additional one being always the posterior rib. It is a remarkable fact that  the ancient Indian horse is said in the Rig-Veda to have only seventeen  ribs; and M. Pietrement (2/6. 'Memoire sur les chevaux a trente-quatre  cotes' 1871.), who has called attention to this subject, gives various  reasons for placing full trust in this statement, more especially as during  former times the Hindoos carefully counted the bones of animals. I have  seen several notices of variations in the bones of the leg; thus Mr. Price  (2/7. 'Proc. Veterinary Assoc.' in 'The Veterinary' volume 13 page 42.)  speaks of an additional bone in the hock, and of certain abnormal  appearances between the tibia and astragalus, as quite common in Irish  horses, and not due to disease. Horses have often been observed, according  to M. Gaudry (2/8. 'Bulletin de la Soc. Geolog.' tome 22 1866 page 22.), to  possess a trapezium and a rudiment of a fifth metacarpal bone, so that \"one  sees appearing by monstrosity, in the foot of the horse, structures which  normally exist in the foot of the Hipparion,\"--an allied and extinct  animal. In various countries horn-like projections have been observed on  the frontal bones of the horse: in one case described by Mr. Percival they  arose about two inches above the orbital processes, and were \"very like  those in a calf from five to six months old,\" being from half to three-  quarters of an inch in length. (2/9. Mr. Percival of the Enniskillen  Dragoons in 'The Veterinary' volume 1 page 224: see Azara, 'Des Quadrupedes  du Paraguay' tome 2 page 313. The French translator of Azara refers to  other cases mentioned by Huzard as having occurred in Spain.) Azara has  described two cases in South America in which the projections were between  three and four inches in length: other instances have occurred in Spain.    That there has been much inherited variation in the horse cannot be  doubted, when we reflect on the number of the breeds existing throughout  the world or even within the same country, and when we know that they have  largely increased in number since the earliest known records. (2/10.  Godron, 'De l'Espece' tome 1 page 378.) Even in so fleeting a character as  colour, Hofacker (2/11. 'Ueber die Eigenschaften' etc. 1828 s. 10.) found  that, out of 216 cases in which horses of the same colour were paired, only  eleven pairs produced foals of a quite different colour. As Professor Low  (2/12. 'Domesticated Animals of the British Islands' pages 527, 532. In all  the veterinary treatises and papers which I have read, the writers insist  in the strongest terms on the inheritance by the horse of all good and bad  tendencies and qualities. Perhaps the principle of inheritance is not  really stronger in the horse than in any other animal; but, from its value,  the tendency has been more carefully observed.) has remarked, the English  race-horse offers the best possible evidence of inheritance. The pedigree  of a race-horse is of more value in judging of its probable success than  its appearance: \"King Herod\" gained in prizes 201,505 pounds sterling, and  begot 497 winners; \"Eclipse\" begot 334 winners.    Whether the whole amount of difference between the various breeds has  arisen under domestication is doubtful. From the fertility of the most  distinct breeds (2/13. Andrew Knight crossed breeds so different in size as  a dray-horse and Norwegian pony: see A. Walker on 'Intermarriage' 1838 page  205.) when crossed, naturalists have generally looked at all the breeds as  having descended from a single species. Few will agree with Colonel H.  Smith, who believes that they have descended from no less than five  primitive and differently coloured stocks. (2/14. 'Nat. Library, Horses'  volume 12 page 208.) But as several species and varieties of the horse  existed (2/15. Gervais 'Hist. Nat. Mamm.' tome 2 page 143. Owen 'British  Fossil Mammals' page 383.) during the later tertiary periods, and as  Rutimeyer found differences in the size and form of the skull in the  earliest known domesticated horses (2/16. 'Kenntniss der fossilen Pferde'  1863 s. 131.), we ought not to feel sure that all our breeds are descended  from a single species. The savages of North and South America easily  reclaim the feral horses, so that there is no improbability in savages in  various quarters of the world having domesticated more than one native  species or natural race. M. Sanson (2/17. 'Comptes rendus' 1866 page 485  and 'Journal de l'Anat. et de la Phys.' Mai 1868.) thinks that he has  proved that two distinct species have been domesticated, one in the East,  and one in North Africa; and that these differed in the number of their  lumbar vertebra and in various other parts; but M. Sanson seems to believe  that osteological characters are subject to very little variation, which is  certainly a mistake. At present no aboriginal or truly wild horse is  positively known to exist; for it is commonly believed that the wild horses  of the East are escaped domestic animals. (2/18. Mr. W.C.L. Martin, 'The  Horse' 1845 page 34, in arguing against the belief that the wild Eastern  horses are merely feral, has remarked on the improbability of man in  ancient times having extirpated a species in a region where it can now  exist in numbers.) If therefore our domestic breeds are descended from  several species or natural races, all have become extinct in the wild  state.    With respect to the causes of the modifications which horses have  undergone, the conditions of life seem to produce a considerable direct  effect. Mr. D. Forbes, who has had excellent opportunities of comparing the  horses of Spain with those of South America, informs me that the horses of  Chile, which have lived under nearly the same conditions as their  progenitors in Andalusia, remain unaltered, whilst the Pampas horses and  the Puno horses are considerably modified. There can be no doubt that  horses become greatly reduced in size and altered in appearance by living  on mountains and islands; and this apparently is due to want of nutritious  or varied food. Every one knows how small and rugged the ponies are on the  Northern islands and on the mountains of Europe. Corsica and Sardinia have  their native ponies; and there were (2/19. 'Transact. Maryland Academy'  volume 1 part 1 page 28.), or still are, on some islands on the coast of  Virginia, ponies like those of the Shetland Islands, which are believed to  have originated through exposure to unfavourable conditions. The Puno  ponies, which inhabit the lofty regions of the Cordillera, are, as I hear  from Mr. D. Forbes, strange little creatures, very unlike their Spanish  progenitors. Further south, in the Falkland Islands, the offspring of the  horses imported in 1764 have already so much deteriorated in size (2/20.  Mr. Mackinnon 'The Falkland Islands' page 25. The average height of the  Falkland horses is said to be 14 hands 2 inches. See also my 'Journal of  Researches.') and strength that they are unfitted for catching wild cattle  with the lasso; so that fresh horses have to be brought for this purpose  from La Plata at a great expense. The reduced size of the horses bred on  both southern and northern islands, and on several mountain-chains, can  hardly have been caused by the cold, as a similar reduction has occurred on  the Virginian and Mediterranean islands. The horse can withstand intense  cold, for wild troops live on the plains of Siberia under lat. 56 deg,  (2/21. Pallas 'Act. Acad. St. Petersburgh' 1777 part 2 page 265. With  respect to the tarpans scraping away the snow see Col. Hamilton Smith in  'Nat. Lib.' volume 12 page 165.) and aboriginally the horses must have  inhabited countries annually covered with snow, for he long retains the  instinct of scraping it away to get at the herbage beneath. The wild  tarpans in the East have this instinct; and so it is, as I am informed by  Admiral Sulivan, with the horses recently and formerly introduced into the  Falkland Islands from La Plata, some of which have run wild; this latter  fact is remarkable, as the progenitors of these horses could not have  followed this instinct during many generations in La Plata. On the other  hand, the wild cattle of the Falklands never scrape away the snow, and  perish when the ground is long covered. In the northern parts of America  the horses descended from those introduced by the Spanish conquerors of  Mexico, have the same habit, as have the native bisons, but not so the  cattle introduced from Europe. (2/22. Franklin 'Narrative' volume 1 page 87  note by Sir J. Richardson.)    The horse can flourish under intense heat as well as under intense cold,  for he is known to come to the highest perfection, though not attaining a  large size, in Arabia and northern Africa. Much humidity is apparently more  injurious to the horse than heat or cold. In the Falkland Islands, horses  suffer much from the dampness; and this circumstance may perhaps partly  account for the singular fact that to the eastward of the Bay of Bengal  (2/23. Mr. J.H. Moor 'Notices of the Indian Archipelago' Singapore 1837  page 189. A pony from Java was sent ('Athenaeum' 1842 page 718) to the  Queen only 28 inches in height. For the Loo Choo Islands, see Beechey  'Voyage' 4th. edition volume 1 page 499.), over an enormous and humid area,  in Ava, Pegu, Siam, the Malayan archipelago, the Loo Choo Islands, and a  large part of China, no full-sized horse is found. When we advance as far  eastward as Japan, the horse reacquires his full size. (2/24. J. Crawfurd,  'History of the Horse' 'Journal of Royal United Service Institution' volume  4.)    With most of our domesticated animals, some breeds are kept on account of  their curiosity or beauty; but the horse is valued almost solely for its  utility."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28711"],[0,"Operas Every Child Should Know (#15)"],[1,"the middle  with a piece of rope which did duty for several things besides tying  this gown. He was a droll, jolly little bad man and he began the  auction with mock piety:         As an honest auctioneer,       I'm prepared to sell you here         Some goods in an assortment that is various;       Here's a late lamented deer       (That was once a King's, I fear)         Killing him was certainly precarious.         Here I have for sale       Casks of brown October ale,         Brewed to make humanity hilarious;       Here's a suit of homespun brave       Fit for honest man or knave;         Here's a stock in fact that's multifarious.    And so it was!    His stock consisted of the most curious assortment of plunder one ever  saw even at a Nottingham fair in the outlaw days of Robin Hood.    While all that tow-wow was going on, people were coming in droves to  the fair; and among them came Robert of Huntingdon. The name is very  thrilling, since the first part gives one an inkling that he beholds  for the first time the future Robin Hood. However, on that May morning  he was not yet an outlaw. He was a simple Knight of the Shire.    The Sheriff, who was a great personage in Nottingham, had a ward whom  he had foisted upon the good folks of Nottinghamshire as an Earl, but  as a fact he was simply a country lout, and all the teachings of the  Sheriff would not make him appear anything different. Robert of  Huntingdon was the Earl, in fact, and the Sheriff was going to try to  keep him out of his title and estates. The merry men of Sherwood  forest were great favourites with Robert and they were his friends.  During the fair a fine cavalier, very dainty for a man, fascinating,  was caught by Friar Tuck kissing a girl, and was brought in with a  great to-do. She declared that she had a right to kiss a pretty girl,  since her business was that of cavalier. Robin Hood discovered her  sex, underneath her disguise, and began to make love to her.    Among other reasons for Robin Hood being at the fair was that of  making the Sheriff confer upon him his title to the Earldom. When he  boldly made his demand, the foxy Sheriff declared that he had a  half-brother brought up by him, and that the half-brother, and not  Robert, was the Earl.    \"You are a vain, presumptuous youth,\" the Sheriff declared. \"You are  no Earl, instead it is this lovely youth whom I have brought up so  carefully.\" And he put forth Guy, the bumpkin. This created an awful  stir, and all the outlaws who were fond of Robin Hood took up the case  for him.    \"A nice sort of Earl, that,\" Little John cried.    \"You think we will acknowledge him as heir to the estates of  Huntingdon? Never!\" Scarlet declared.    \"Traitor!\" Robin Hood cried to the Sheriff. \"In the absence of the  King I know that your word is law; but wait till the King returns from  his Crusade! I'll show you then whose word is to prevail.\"    \"My friend!\" Little John then cried, stepping into the middle of the  row, \"take thou this good stout bow of yew. You are going to join us  and make one of Sherwood's merry men till his Majesty returns and  reinstates you as the rightful Earl of Huntingdon. Come! Say you will  be one of us.\" All the outlaws crowded affectionately about Robert and  urged him.    \"You shall become King of Outlaws, if you will,\" Scarlet cried. \"Come!  accept our friendship. Become our outlaw king!\"    After thinking a moment, Robert turned and looked at the gay cavalier  whom he knew to be his cousin Marian, in masquerade, and whom he  loved. Then he decided he would go and live a gay and roving life in  the forest till he could return and marry his cousin as the Earl of  Huntingdon should.    \"Farewell,\" he sang to her. \"Farewell, till we meet again,\" and he was  carried off amid the uproarious welcome of the outlaws of Sherwood  forest, to become their leader till the King returned from the  Crusades to make him Earl.      ACT II    Away in Sherwood forest the outlaws were encamped--which meant merely  the building of a fire and the assembling of the merry men. Robin Hood  had become their leader.         Oh, cheerily soundeth the hunter's horn,         Its clarion blast so fine;       Through depths of old Sherwood so clearly borne,       We hear it at eve and at break of morn,         Of Robin Hood's band the sign.           A hunting we will go,             Tra-ra-ra-tra-ra!           We'll chase for the roe,             Tra-ra-ra-tra-ra!       Oh where is band so jolly         As Robin's band in their Lincoln green?       Their life is naught but folly,         A rollicking life I ween!    Now the merry men gathered about their fire, and while the old monk  was broiling the meat, they all lounged about in comfortable ways and  Little John sang to them:         And it's will ye quaff with me, my lads,         And it's will ye quaff with me?       It is a draught of nut-brown ale         I offer unto ye.       All humming in the tankard, lads,         It cheers the heart forlorn;       Oh! here's a friend to everyone,         'Tis stout John Barley-corn.         So laugh, lads, and quaff, lads!         'Twill make you stout and hale,       Through all my days I'll sing the praise         Of brown October ale!    While the outlaws were lounging thus, in came the Sheriff, Sir Guy,  the spurious Earl, and a lot of journeymen tinkers. Immediately they  began a gay chorus, telling how they were men of such metal that no  can or kettle can withstand their attack, and as they hammered upon  their tin pans, one believed them. Of all the merriment and nonsense  that ever was, the most infectious took place there in the forest,  while the tinkers sang and hammered, and Friar Tuck made jokes, and  the other outlaws drank their brown October ale: but soon Maid Marian,  the dainty cavalier, wandered that way, looking for Robin Hood--Robert  of Huntingdon. She had missed him dreadfully, and finally could not  refrain from going in search of him. She was certain she should find  him thinking of her and as true to her as she was to him.    Robin Hood found that she had come to the forest, and sang to her a  serenade which was overheard by the other outlaws. Alan-a-Dale, who  was in love, became jealous, and the Sheriff came on to the scene, and  the outlaws, finding him on their ground, took him prisoner, and Dame  Durden, who secretly had been married to the Sheriff, and from whose  shrewish tongue the Sheriff had fled, came to free him. She declared  that if the Sheriff of Nottingham would acknowledge her, she would get  him free from the stocks, into which the outlaws had put him, and  would take him home. But the prospect of having to stand Dame Durden's  tongue was so much worse than the stocks, that the Sheriff begged the  outlaws to take him anywhere so long as it was away from his wife.         Woman, get thee gone,       I'd rather live alone!         If Guy should come with the King's men,         I'd turn the tables on them,    the Sheriff cried, trying to plan a way to get free.    At that all the outlaws danced gaily about him, gibing at him and  making the pompous Sheriff miserable. They were trying to pay him for  his mistreatment of Robin Hood, their beloved leader.    In the height of their gaiety in rushed Sir Guy with the King's men.    \"We're lost,\" all cried.    \"You are,\" Sir Guy recklessly shouts, \"because we're brave as lions,  all of us, and shall make short work of you.\"         We're brave as lions, every one,       We're brave as lions--for we're two to one,    all cried, and immediately they marched the gay outlaws off to prison  and set the Sheriff free.    As it turned out, Maid Marian, the cousin and beloved of Robin Hood,  had been commanded by the King himself to become Robin's wife, or  rather the wife of the Earl of Huntingdon. As the false Earl, Guy had  tried to make love to the maid, and to win her, but the cousins loved  each other, and all Guy's efforts were quite hopeless. But now that  the outlaws, and Robin Hood with them, were all in the power of the  Sheriff again, the case looked serious. As outlaws, the Sheriff could  hang them, every one. Little John and the leading outlaws pleaded for  their friend, reminding the Sheriff and Sir Guy that, since Robin  must, by the King's command, marry Marian, the Sheriff dare not kill  him.    \"Don't count upon that,\" the wily Sheriff cried \"The King's command  was to the Earl of Huntingdon--and he is my ward, Sir Guy; not your  outlaw friend! Robin Hood shall go to the gallows and Guy shall marry  the Maid Marian.\" At that everybody sighed very sadly. It really began  to look as if the wicked Sheriff was going to get the best of them.      ACT III    Among the outlaws, the strongest and also the cleverest, perhaps, was  Will Scarlet. He had not been captured with the others of the band,  and so he had come into Nottingham, whence the prisoners had been  taken, to spy out the ground and to see if he could not help to free  his comrades. He had set up a blacksmith's shop and had set about  forging a sword. All the while he was watching what took place about  him, and hoping to get news of his friends.    Friar Tuck was finally discovered locked up in a tower, and with his  dirty face at the window. It would have been a shame for so dirty and  merry a gentleman as the Friar to have his life cut short, and of  course he was freed, but before this happened he had plenty of chance  to get scared half to death.    At the very moment when Maid Marian was distracted because she feared  that her lover, Robin Hood, was to be led to the gallows, a message  came from the King, pardoning all of the outlaws. Some one had  revealed to his Majesty the doings of the Sheriff, and the King had  hastened to look into matters. When everybody's life seemed to be in  danger, the King rushed back from the Crusades and saved them all, and  put the temporary outlaw into his rightful place, and forgave all the"]]]
