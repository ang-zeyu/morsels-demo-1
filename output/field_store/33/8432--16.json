If the use of the submarine justifies such a change in the law of  blockade as will permit the cordon to be withdrawn far enough from the  shore to avoid the danger of submarine attack, may it not be found  possible to secure an international agreement by which passengers  will be excluded from ships carrying contraband, or, at least, from  those carrying ammunition?    It would require but a slight change in the shipping laws to make this  separation, and belligerent nations might be restrained from  unnecessarily increasing the contraband list if they were compelled to  carry contraband on transports as they now carry troops.    Personally, I would like to see the use of submarines abandoned  entirely, just as I would like to see an abandonment of the use of  aeroplanes and Zeppelins for the carrying of explosives, but I am not  sanguine enough to believe that any effective instrument of warfare  will be abandoned as long as war continues.    The very arguments which the advocates of peace advance against the  submarine, the aeroplane, and the Zeppelin are advanced for them by  those who conduct war. The more fatal a weapon is the more it is in  demand, and it is not an unusual thing to see a new instrument of  destruction denounced as inhuman by those against whom it is employed,  only to be employed later by those who only a little while before  denounced it.    The above suggestions are respectfully submitted to those of German  birth or descent, and they are submitted in the same spirit to  naturalized citizens from other countries. To the naturalized citizen  this is the land of adoption, but in one sense it may be nearer to him  than it is to us who are native born, for those who come here are  citizens by voluntary choice, while we are here by accident of birth.  They may be said to have paid a higher compliment to the United States  than we who first saw the light under the Stars and Stripes. But, more  than that, it is the land of their children and their children's  children, no matter for what reason they crossed the ocean. They not  only share with us the shaping of our nation's destiny, but their  descendants have a part with ours in all the blessings which the  present generation can, by wise and patriotic action, bequeath to the  generations that are to follow.    W.J. BRYAN.      SEES CHANGE IN TONE OF PRESS.    _On the same day with this outgiving Mr. Bryan issued a statement  expressing his gratification over what he termed a change in the tone  of the press regarding the note. The statement follows:_    I am glad to note the change in the tone of the press in regard to the  note to Germany. From the time the papers began to publish forecasts  down to yesterday the jingo editors have been predicting that the  matter would be dealt with with \"great firmness\"; that Germany would  be told that there must be no more delay in the acceptance of this  country's demands, &c.    Instead of waiting until the note was issued they put their own  construction upon it in advance, and colored it to suit their own  purposes. It is a relief to find the papers now emphasizing the  friendly tone of the note, and pointing out that it does not  necessarily mean war.    Something has been gained if the warrior journalists at last realize  that the country does not want war, but that, on the contrary, it will  support the President in his efforts to find a peaceful solution of  the difficult problem raised by the use of the submarine against  merchantmen.    _In giving out his statement Mr. Bryan supplemented it with the  following anecdote:_    A Congressman replying to a jingo speech recently said:    \"While I am personally against war, I am in favor of the country  having what it wants. If the country wants war, let it have war, but  let it first find out if the country does want war. If it becomes  necessary to ascertain the sentiment of the country, I suggest that a  ballot be taken; let those who want war vote for war and those opposed  to war vote against it, and let the vote be taken with the  understanding that those who vote for war will enlist for war and that  those who vote against war will not be called upon until after those  who want war have exhausted their efforts.\"    _\"I still believe,\" added Mr. Bryan, \"in the right of the people to  rule, and think the Congressman's suggestion might insure deliberate  action on the part of the voters.\"_    _Mr. Bryan was reminded of the suggestion of some of his friends that  in case of war he would be one of the first to enlist. He replied:_    I do not want to talk about war, but on one occasion I enlisted to  defend my country on the first day war was declared.      GERMAN-AMERICAN OPINION.    _Commenting on Mr. Bryan's appeal, the evening edition of the New  Yorker Herold on June 12 said:_    The arguments which Mr. Bryan dishes up will not be agreed to by most  citizens of German descent, but the open discussion of the various  points can only be useful.    So far as influencing the German Government is concerned, we are  convinced that in Berlin they will not forget for an instant how  terrible a warlike conflict between the two countries would be,  particularly for the Germans in America. In view of the many bonds of  blood that link the German population of our country with the old  Fatherland, a war with the United States would be regarded practically  as fratricidal, as a calamity which, if in any way possible, must be  avoided. Mr. Bryan may rest assured of this.    The influence of the German-Americans is required less in Germany than  here, at this point and place, in the United States. Here the jingo  press is raging and seeking to fire minds to war, not in Germany.    _From the Detroiter Abendpost._    Mr. Bryan's proclamation will disappoint only those who hailed him  when he published his reasons for leaving the Cabinet; but we find in  his last document the confirmation of what we have always thought of  the man and the politician Bryan, namely, that he considers all means  right if they suit his political intentions.    _From Charles Neumeyer, Editor Louisville Anzeiger._    Mr. Bryan's appeal directed chiefly to American citizens of German  birth exhibits an astonishing lack of tact as well as lack of  judgment. The former Secretary of State seems to be going on the  presumption, like many other native Americans not actuated by a  feeling of prejudice or race hatred, that German-Americans have left  their hearts behind them in the old country and are, therefore, unable  to feel as true American citizens should feel toward their country and  everything involving its destiny.    Mr. Bryan's appeal, especially the one directed to German-Americans,  will not, can not, and should not meet with the slightest response.    _From the Colorado Herold of Denver._    Bryan's appeal to the Germans, while it may be classed as patriotic,  was unnecessary, and Dr. Dernburg, Germany's special envoy,  practically voiced the same sentiments in his farewell address in New  York Friday night. Bryan's well-known prohibition tendencies, however,  preclude the idea that he was bidding for German-American votes.    _From the Waechter und Anzeiger of Cleveland, Ohio._    Mr. Bryan might well have abstained from issuing his statement to the  German-Americans. To make any impression he should have explained why  he now thinks it the duty of neutrality to furnish contraband to  England, when in 1914 he stated in his Commoner that the President had  blazed a new way when he, without conference with other nations,  committed this nation to the policy that furnishing the \"contraband of  money\" was inconsistent with the spirit of neutrality. What are the  influences that have now changed his views? Mr. Bryan is neither frank  nor consistent, hence not impressive.      A \"SOFTENED\" NOTE.    [The First and Second German Notes.]    Washington, June 12, 1915.    My attention has been called to a number of newspaper editorials and  articles which, in varying language, asks the question, \"Why did Mr.  Bryan sign the first note to Germany, and then refuse to sign the  second?\" The argument presented in the question is based on the  supposition that the two notes were substantially the same and that  the second note simply reiterates the demands contained in the first.  They then declare it inconsistent to sign one and refuse to sign the  other. The difference between the two cases would seem obvious enough  to make an answer unnecessary, but, lest silence on the subject be  taken as an admission of inconsistency, the following explanation is  given:    The notes must be considered in connection with the conditions under  which they were sent. The first note presented the case of this  Government upon such evidence as we then had. It was like the  plaintiff's statement in a case, his claim being based on the facts as  he presents them. I did not agree entirely with the language of the  first note, but the difference was not so material as to justify a  refusal to sign it. Then, too, I was at that time hoping that certain  things would be done which would make it easier for Germany to  acquiesce in our demands.    The three things which I had in mind which, in my judgment, would have  helped the situation were: First, an announcement of a willingness  upon our part to employ the principle of investigation, embodied in  our thirty peace treaties; second, action which would prevent American  citizens from traveling on belligerent ships or on American ships  carrying contraband, especially if that contraband consisted of  ammunition; and, third, further insistence upon our protest against  interference of our trade with neutrals. I thought that these three  things were within the range of possibilities, and that two, or at  least one was probable.

Over His Head [Greek: Alpha], [Greek: Omega]; in His    Hand an open book: Ego sum [Greek: Alpha] et [Greek: Omega]; principium    et finis. At His Feet: Iesus Christus summus magister, caelestis doctrinae    auctor.      On Christ's right hand is a POPE, standing, with triple cross and tiara.      Christi Domini vicarius.      On Christ's left hand is an EMPEROR, also standing, with crown, sword,    blue mantle.      Ecclesiae defensor.    I will now pass to the decoration of the walls. On the south wall, between  the windows, are representations of famous libraries; on the north wall,  of the eight general Councils of the Church. Each space is ornamented with  a broad border, like a picture-frame. In the centre above is the general  title of the subject or subjects below: e.g. _Bibliotheca Romanorum_; and  beneath each picture is an inscription describing the special subject.  Above each window, on the vault, is a large picture, to commemorate the  benefits conferred by Sixtus V. on Rome and on the world. I will describe  the libraries first, beginning as before at the east end of the room.      I. SIXTUS V. AND THE ARCHITECT FONTANA.    (Right of Entrance.)        Sixtus V. Pont. M. Bibliothecae Vaticanae aedificationem      prescribit.    The Pope is seated. Fontana, a pair of compasses in his right hand, is on  one knee, exhibiting the plan of the intended library.      II. MOSES ENTRUSTS THE TABLES OF THE LAW TO THE LEVITES.    (Left of Entrance.)        Moyses librum legis Levitis in tabernaculo reponendum      tradit.    Moses hands a large folio to a Levite, behind whom more Levites are  standing. Soldiers, etc., stand behind Moses. Tents in background.      III. BIBLIOTHECA HEBRAEA.    (On first wall-space south side.)        Esdras sacerdos et scriba Bibliothecam sacram restituit.    Ezra, attired in a costume that is almost Roman, stands in the centre of  the picture, his back half turned to the spectator. An official is  pointing to a press full of books. Porters are bringing in others.      IV. BIBLIOTHECA BABYLONICA.    (Two pictures.)    (_a_) _The education of Daniel in Babylon._        Daniel et socii linguam scientiamque Chaldaeorum      ediscunt.    Daniel and other young men are writing and reading at a table on the right  of the picture. A group of elderly men in front of them to the left.  Behind these is a lofty chair and desk, beneath which is a table at which  a group of boys are reading and writing. In the background a set of  book-shelves with a desk, quite modern in style.    (_b_) _The search for the decree of Cyrus._        Cyri decretum de templi restauratione Darii iussu      perquiritur.    Darius, crowned, his back half turned to the spectator, is giving orders  to several young men, who are taking books out of an _armarium_--evidently  copied from one of the Vatican book-cupboards.      V. BIBLIOTHECA ATHENIENSIS.    (Two pictures.)    (_a_) _Pisistratus arranges a library at Athens._        Pisistratus primus apud Graecos publicam bibliothecam      instituit.    Pisistratus, in armour, over which is a blue mantle, is giving orders to  an old man who kneels before him, holding an open book. Behind the old man  attendants are placing books on desks--others are reading. Behind  Pisistratus is a group of officers, and behind them again a book-press  without doors, and a row of open books on the top.    (_b_) _Restoration of the library by Seleucus._        Seleucus bibliothecam a Xerxe asportatam referendam      curat.    Servants are bringing in books which are being hastily packed into cases.  In the background is seen the sea, with a ship; and the door of the  palace. A picture full of life and movement.      VI. BIBLIOTHECA ALEXANDRINA.    (Two pictures.)    (_a_) _Ptolemy organises the library at Alexandria._        Ptolemaeus ingenti bibliotheca instructa Hebreorum libros      concupiscit.    Ptolemy, a dignified figure in a royal habit, stands in the centre. He is  addressing an elderly man who stands on his right. Behind him are three  porches, within which are seen desks and readers. In the central porch are  closed presses, with rows of folios on the top. Below are desks, at which  readers are seated, their backs turned to the presses.    (_b_) _The Seventy Translators bring their work to Ptolemy._        LXXII interpretes ab Eleazaro missi sacros libros      Ptolemaeo reddunt.    Ptolemy is seated on a throne to right of spectator with courtiers on his  right and left. The messengers kneel before him, and hand him volumes.      VII. BIBLIOTHECA ROMANORUM.    (_a_) _Tarquin receives the Sibylline Books._        Tarquinius Superbus libros Sibyllinos tres aliis a      muliere incensis tantidem emit.    Tarquin, seated in the centre of the picture, receives three volumes from  an aged and dignified woman. In front a lighted brazier in which the other  books are burning.      (_b_) _Augustus opens the Palatine library._        Augustus Caes. Palatina Bibliotheca magnifice ornata      viros litteratos fovet.    Augustus, in armour, with imperial mantle, crown and sceptre, stands left  of centre. An old man seated at his feet is writing from his dictation.  Left of the Emperor are five desks; with five closed books lying on the  top of each. These desks are very probably intended to represent those of  the Vatican Library as arranged by Sixtus IV. Two men, crowned with  laurel, are standing behind the last desk, conversing. Behind them again  is a book-case of three shelves between a pair of columns. Books are lying  on their sides on these shelves. Beneath the shelves is a desk, with books  open upon it, and others on their sides beneath it.      VIII. BIBLIOTHECA HIEROSOLIMITANA.    _Alexander, Bishop and Martyr, collects a library at Jerusalem._        S. Alexander Episc. et Mart. Decio Imp. in magna      temporum acerbitate sacrorum scriptorum libros      Hierosolymis congregat.    A picture full of movement, occupying the whole space between two windows.  The saint is in the centre of the picture, seated. Young men are bringing  in the books, and placing them on shelves.      IX. BIBLIOTHECA CAESARIENSIS.    _Pamphilus, Priest and Martyr, collects a library at Caesarea._        S. Pamphilus Presb. et Mart. admirandae sanctitatis et      doctrinae Caesareae sacram bibliothecam conficit multos      libros sua manu describit.    Pamphilus, in centre of picture, is giving orders to porters who are  bringing in a basket of books. On his left a large table at which a scribe  is writing. S. Jerome, seated in right corner of picture, is apparently  dictating to the scribe. Behind them is a large book-case on the shelves  of which books lie on their sides; others are being laid on the top by a  man standing on a ladder. In the left of the picture is a table covered  with a green cloth, on which book-binders are at work. In front of this  table a carpenter is preparing boards. In background, seen through a large  window, is a view of Caesarea.      X. BIBLIOTHECA APOSTOLORUM.    _S. Peter orders the safe-keeping of books._        S. Petrus sacrorum librorum thesaurum in Romana ecclesia      perpetuo asservari jubet.    S. Peter is standing before an altar on which are books and a cross. In  front doctors are writing at a low table.    [A small picture between window and west wall.]      XI. BIBLIOTHECA PONTIFICUM.    _The successors of S. Peter carry on the library-tradition._        Romani pontifices "]]]
