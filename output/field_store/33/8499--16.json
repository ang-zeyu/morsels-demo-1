These numbers are fixed into a frame in such a  way that the figures 1 to 9 can be slipped in covering the zero. If  the zero of 10 is covered by 1 the result is 11, if with 2 it becomes  12, and so on, until the last 9. Then we pass to the twenties (the  second ten), and so on, from ten to ten. (Fig. 42.)    For the beginning of this exercise with the cards marking the tens we  can use the rods. As we begin with the first ten (10) in the frame, we  take the rod 10. We then place the small rod 1 next to rod 10, and at  the same time slip in the number 1, covering the zero of the 10. Then  we take rod 1 and figure 1 away from the frame, and put in their place  rod 2 next to rod 10, and figure 2 over the zero in the frame, and so  on, up to 9. To advance farther we should need to use two rods of 10  to make 20.    The children show much enthusiasm when learning these exercises, which  demand from them two sets of activities, and give them in their work  clearness of idea.                      *       *       *       *       *    In writing and arithmetic we have gathered the fruits of a laborious  education which consisted in coordinating the movements and gaining a  first knowledge of the world. This culture comes as a natural  consequence of man's first efforts to put himself into intelligent  communication with the world.    All those early acquisitions which have brought order into the child's  mind, would be wasted were they not firmly established by means of  written language and of figures. Thus established, however, these  experiences open up an unlimited field for future education. What we  have done, therefore, is to introduce the child to a higher level--the  level of culture--and he will now be able to pass on to a _school_,  but not the school we know to-day, where, irrationally, we try to give  culture to minds not yet prepared or _educated to receive it_.    To preserve the health of their minds, which have been _exercised_ and  not _fatigued_ by the order of the work, our children must have a new  kind of school for the acquisition of culture. My experiments in the  continuation of this method for older children are already far  advanced.          MORAL FACTORS      A brief description such as this, of the _means_ which are used in the  \"Children's House,\" may perhaps give the reader the impression of a  logical and convincing system of education. But the importance of my  method does not lie in the organization itself, but _in the effects  which it produces on the child_. It is the _child_ who proves the  value of this method by his spontaneous manifestations, which seem to  reveal the laws of man's inner development.[B] Psychology will perhaps  find in the \"Children's Houses\" a laboratory which will bring more  truths to light than thus hitherto recognized; for the essential  factor in psychological research, especially in the field of  psychogenesis, the origin and development of the mind, must be the  establishment of normal conditions for the free development of  thought.    -----      [B] See the chapters on Discipline in my larger works.    -----    As is well known, we leave the children _free_ in their work, and in  all actions which are not of a disturbing kind. That is, we  _eliminate_ disorder, which is \"bad,\" but allow to that which is  orderly and \"good\" the most complete liberty of manifestation.    The results obtained are surprising, for the children have shown a  love of work which no one suspected to be in them, and a calm and an  orderliness in their movements which, surpassing the limits of  correctness have entered into those of \"grace.\" The spontaneous  discipline, and the obedience which is seen in the whole class,  constitute the most striking result of our method.    The ancient philosophical discussion as to whether man is born good or  evil is often brought forward in connection with my method, and many  who have supported it have done so on the ground that it provides a  demonstration of man's natural goodness. Very many others, on the  contrary, have opposed it, considering that to leave children free is  a dangerous mistake, since they have in them innate tendencies to  evil.    I should like to put the question upon a more positive plane.    In the words \"good\" and \"evil\" we include the most varying ideas, and  we confuse them especially _in our practical dealings with little  children_.    The tendencies which we stigmatize as _evil_ in little children of  three to six years of age are often merely those which cause  _annoyance_ to us adults when, not understanding their needs, we try  to prevent their _every movement_, their every _attempt to gain  experience for themselves in the world_ (by touching everything,  etc.). The child, however, through this _natural tendency_, is led to  _coordinate his movements_ and to collect impressions, especially  sensations of touch, so that when prevented he _rebels_, and this  rebellion forms almost the whole of his \"naughtiness.\"    What wonder is it that the evil disappears when, if we give the right  _means_ for development and leave full liberty to use them, rebellion  has no more reason for existence?    Further, by the substitution of a series of outbursts of _joy_ for the  old series of outbursts of _rage_, the moral physiognomy of the child  comes to assume a calm and gentleness which make him appear a  different being.    It is we who provoked the children to the violent manifestations of a  real _struggle for existence_. In order to exist _according to the  needs of their psychic development_ they were often obliged to snatch  from us the things which seemed necessary to them for the purpose.  They had to move contrary to our laws, or sometimes to struggle with  other children to wrest from them the objects of their desire.    On the other hand, if we give children the _means of existence_, the  struggle for it disappears, and a vigorous expansion of life takes its  place. This question involves a hygienic principle connected with the  nervous system during the difficult period when the brain is still  rapidly growing, and should be of great interest to specialists in  children's diseases and nervous derangements. The inner life of man  and the beginnings of his intellect are controlled by special laws and  vital necessities which cannot be forgotten if we are aiming at health  for mankind.    For this reason, an educational method, which cultivates and protects  the inner activities of the child, is not a question which concerns  merely the school or the teachers; it is a universal question which  concerns the family, and is of vital interest to mothers.    To go more deeply into a question is often the only means of answering  it rightly. If, for instance, we were to see men fighting over a piece  of bread, we might say: \"How bad men are!\" If, on the other hand, we  entered a well-warmed eating-house, and saw them quietly finding a  place and choosing their meal without any envy of one another, we  might say: \"How good men are!\" Evidently, the question of absolute  good and evil, intuitive ideas of which guide us in our superficial  judgment, goes beyond such limitations as these. We can, for instance,  provide excellent eating-houses for an entire people without directly  affecting the question of their morals. One might say, indeed, that to  judge by appearances, a well-fed people are _better, quieter, and  commit less crime_ than a nation that is ill-nourished; but whoever  draws from that the conclusion that to make men good it is _enough_ to  feed them, will be making an obvious mistake.    It cannot be denied, however, that _nourishment_ will be an essential  factor in obtaining goodness, in the sense that it will _eliminate_  all the _evil acts, and the bitterness_ caused by lack of bread.    Now, in our case, we are dealing with a far deeper need--the  nourishment of man's inner life, and of his higher functions. The  bread that we are dealing with is the bread of the spirit, and we are  entering into the difficult subject of the satisfaction of man's  psychic needs.    We have already obtained a most interesting result, in that we have  found it possible to present _new means_ of enabling children to reach  a higher level of calm and goodness, and we have been able to  establish these means by experience. The whole foundation of our  results rests upon these means which we have discovered, and which may  be divided under two heads--the _organization of work_, and liberty.    It is the perfect organization of work, permitting the possibility of  self-development and giving outlet for the energies, which procures  for each child the beneficial and calming _satisfaction_. And it is  under such conditions of work that liberty leads to a perfecting of  the activities, and to the attainment of a fine discipline which is in  itself the result of that new quality of _calmness_ that has been  developed in the child.    Freedom without organization of work would be useless. The child left  _free_ without means of work would go to waste, just as a new-born  baby, if _left free_ without nourishment, would die of starvation.  _The organization of the work_, therefore, is the corner-stone of this  new structure of goodness; but even that organization would be in vain  without the _liberty_ to make use of it, and without freedom for the  expansion of all those energies which spring from the satisfaction of  the child's highest activities.    Has not a similar phenomenon occurred also in the history of man? The  history of civilization is a history of successful attempts to  organize work and to obtain liberty. On the whole, man's goodness has  also increased, as is shown by his progress from barbarism to  civilization, and it may be said that crime, the various forms of  wickedness, cruelty and violence have been gradually decreasing during  this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29728"],[0,"Cookery and Dining in Imperial Rome (#15)"],[1,"with suspicion, accentuated by the hallowed traditions  surrounding it which has rewarded us for the time and expense devoted  to the subject. Ever since we have often dined in the classical  fashion of the ancients who, after all, were but \"folks\" like  ourselves.    If you care not for the carnal pleasures in Apician gastronomy--for  _gulam_,--if you don't give a fig for philology, there still is something  healthy, something infinitely soothing and comforting--\"educational\"--in  the perusal of the old book and in similar records.    When we see Apicius, the famous \"epicure\" descending to the very level  of a common food \"fakir,\" giving directions for making Liburnian oil  that has never seen that country....    When we note, with a gentle shudder, that the grafters of Naples,  defying even the mighty Augustus, leveled the \"White Earth Hill\" near  Puteoli because an admixture of plaster paris is exceedingly  profitable to the milling profession....    When Apicius--celebrated glutton--resorts to the comparatively  harmless \"stunt\" of keeping fresh vegetables green by boiling them in  a copper kettle with soda....    When we behold hordes of ancient legislators, posing as dervishes of  moderation, secretly and openly breaking the prohibition laws of their  own making....    When we turn away from such familiar sights and, in a more jovial  mood, heartily laugh at the jokes of that former mill slave, Plautus  (who could not pay his bills) and when we wonder why his wise cracks  sound so familiar we remember that we have heard their modern versions  only yesterday at the Tivoli on State Street....    When, finally, in the company of our respected Horatius we hear him  say in the slang of his day: _Ab ovo usque ad mala_, and compare this  bright saying with our own dear \"From Soup to Nuts.\"...    Then we arrive at the comforting conclusion that we moderns are either  very ancient and backward or that indeed the ancients are very modern  and progressive; and it is our only regret that we cannot decide this  perplexing situation to our lasting satisfaction.    Very true, there may be nothing new under the sun, yet nature goes on  eternally fashioning new things from old materials. Eternally  demolishing old models in a manner of an economical sculptor, nature  uses the same old clay to create new specimens. Sometimes nature  slightly alters the patterns, discarding what is unfit for her  momentary enigmatic purposes, retaining and favoring that which  pleases her whimsical fancy for the time being.    Cookery deals exclusively with nature's works. Books on cookery are  essentially books on nature's actions and reactions.    In the perpetual search for perfection, life has accomplished one  remarkable thing: the development of man, the animal which cooks.  Gradually nature has revealed herself to man principally through the  food he takes, cooks and prepares for the enjoyment of himself and his  fellow men.      THE COOKING ANIMAL    The gastronomer is the highest development of the cooking animal.    He--artist, philosopher, metaphysician, religionist--stands with his  head bared before nature: overawed, contemplating her gifts, feasting  his eyes on beauteous forms and colors, inhaling intoxicating  fragrances, aromas, odors, matching them all artistically, partaking  only of what he needs for his own subsistence--eternally marveling at  nature's inexhaustible resources and inventiveness, at her everlasting  bounty born of everlasting fierce struggles.    The gastronomer is grateful for the privilege of holding the  custodianship of such precious things, and he guards it like an office  of a sacred rite--ever gratefully, reverently adoring, cherishing the  things before him ... ever marveling ... ever alone, alone with  nature.    As for the overwhelming majority of the cooking animals, they behave  much more \"naturally.\" They are a merry crowd, ever anticipating a  good time, ever jolly, eager, greedy. Or, they are cranky, hungry,  starved, miserable, and they turn savage now and then. Some are  gluttonous. Many contract indigestion--nature's most subtle  punishment.    If they were told that they must kill before they may cook--that might  spoil the appetite and dinner joy of many a tender-hearted devourer of  fellow-creatures.    Heaven forbid! Being real children of nature, and behaving naturally,  nature likes them, and we, too, certainly are well pleased with the  majority.    The only fly in the ointment of life is that we don't know what it is  all about, and probably never will know.

INTO  A COPPER BOWL PUT 6 SEXTARII [1] OF HONEY AND 2 SEXTARII OF WINE; HEAT  ON A SLOW FIRE, CONSTANTLY STIRRING THE MIXTURE WITH A WHIP. AT THE  BOILING POINT ADD A DASH OF COLD WINE, RETIRE FROM STOVE AND SKIM.  REPEAT THIS TWICE OR THREE TIMES, LET IT REST TILL THE NEXT DAY, AND  SKIM AGAIN. THEN ADD 4 OZS. OF CRUSHED PEPPER [2], 3 SCRUPLES OF  MASTICH, A DRACHM EACH OF [nard or laurel] LEAVES AND SAFFRON, 5  DRACHMS OF ROASTED DATE STONES CRUSHED AND PREVIOUSLY SOAKED IN WINE  TO SOFTEN THEM. WHEN THIS IS PROPERLY DONE ADD 18 SEXTARII OF LIGHT  WINE. TO CLARIFY IT PERFECTLY, ADD [crushed] CHARCOAL [3] TWICE OR AS  OFTEN AS NECESSARY WHICH WILL DRAW [the residue] TOGETHER [and  carefully strain or filter through the charcoal].        [1] _Sextarii._ Tor. _partes XV_; G.-V. _pondo XV_;      List. _partes XV ... pondo lib.... qui continent      sextarios sex_. One sextarius (a \"sixth\") equals about      1-1/2 pint English.        [2] Pepper. _Piperis uncias IV_--ordinarily our black or      white pepper grains, but in connection with honey,      sweets, and so forth, the term \"pepper\" may just as well      stand for our allspice, or even for any spicing in      general.        [3] Charcoal. Still a favorite filterer for liquors.        List. Apicius is correct in starting his book with this      formula, as all meals were started with this sort of      mixed drink.        Tor. deviates from the other texts in that he elaborates      on the cooking process.

IN THE MOMENT OF SERVING PUT HONEY IN A CUP, AS MUCH AS IS  DESIRED TO OBTAIN THE RIGHT DEGREE OF SWEETNESS, AND MIX SPICED WINE  NOT MORE THAN A NEEDED QUANTITY; ALSO ADD SOME WINE TO THE SPICED  HONEY TO FACILITATE ITS FLOW AND THE MIXING.        [1] Tor. _Melirhomum_; _non extat_. G.-V. M.      _perpetuum_, i.e., having good keeping qualities.        [2] Tor. reads thus whereas others apply \"endurance\" to      the honey itself. The honey could not be preserved      (_perpetuum_) by the addition of pepper. Any addition,      as a matter of fact, would hasten its deterioration      unless the honey were boiled and sealed tight, which the      original takes for"]]]
