I,  therefore, waited for fresh material. In my second interview with Mr.  Hilton Cubitt he was able to give me two other short sentences and one  message, which appeared--since there was no flag--to be a single word.  Here are the symbols. Now, in the single word I have already got the  two E's coming second and fourth in a word of five letters. It might  be 'sever,' or 'lever,' or 'never.' There can be no question that  the latter as a reply to an appeal is far the most probable, and  the circumstances pointed to its being a reply written by the lady.  Accepting it as correct, we are now able to say that the symbols XXX  stand respectively for N, V, and R.    \"Even now I was in considerable difficulty, but a happy thought put me  in possession of several other letters. It occurred to me that if these  appeals came, as I expected, from someone who had been intimate with the  lady in her early life, a combination which contained two E's with  three letters between might very well stand for the name 'ELSIE.' On  examination I found that such a combination formed the termination of  the message which was three times repeated. It was certainly some appeal  to 'Elsie.' In this way I had got my L, S, and I. But what appeal could  it be? There were only four letters in the word which preceded 'Elsie,'  and it ended in E. Surely the word must be 'COME.' I tried all other  four letters ending in E, but could find none to fit the case. So now I  was in possession of C, O, and M, and I was in a position to attack the  first message once more, dividing it into words and putting dots for  each symbol which was still unknown. So treated it worked out in this  fashion:--           .M .ERE ..E  SL.NE.    \"Now the first letter CAN only be A, which is a most useful discovery,  since it occurs no fewer than three times in this short sentence, and  the H is also apparent in the second word. Now it becomes:--            AM  HERE  A.E  SLANE.    Or, filling in the obvious vacancies in the name:--            AM  HERE  ABE  SLANEY.    I had so many letters now that I could proceed with considerable  confidence to the second message, which worked out in this fashion:--            A.  ELRI.ES.    Here I could only make sense by putting T and G for the missing letters,  and supposing that the name was that of some house or inn at which the  writer was staying.\"    Inspector Martin and I had listened with the utmost interest to the full  and clear account of how my friend had produced results which had led to  so complete a command over our difficulties.    \"What did you do then, sir?\" asked the inspector.    \"I had every reason to suppose that this Abe Slaney was an American,  since Abe is an American contraction, and since a letter from America  had been the starting-point of all the trouble. I had also every cause  to think that there was some criminal secret in the matter. The lady's  allusions to her past and her refusal to take her husband into her  confidence both pointed in that direction. I therefore cabled to my  friend, Wilson Hargreave, of the New York Police Bureau, who has more  than once made use of my knowledge of London crime. I asked him whether  the name of Abe Slaney was known to him. Here is his reply: 'The most  dangerous crook in Chicago.' On the very evening upon which I had his  answer Hilton Cubitt sent me the last message from Slaney. Working with  known letters it took this form:--             ELSIE .RE.ARE  TO  MEET  THY  GO.    The addition of a P and a D completed a message which showed me that the  rascal was proceeding from persuasion to threats, and my knowledge of  the crooks of Chicago prepared me to find that he might very rapidly  put his words into action. I at once came to Norfolk with my friend and  colleague, Dr. Watson, but, unhappily, only in time to find that the  worst had already occurred.\"    \"It is a privilege to be associated with you in the handling of a case,\"  said the inspector, warmly. \"You will excuse me, however, if I speak  frankly to you. You are only answerable to yourself, but I have to  answer to my superiors. If this Abe Slaney, living at Elrige's, is  indeed the murderer, and if he has made his escape while I am seated  here, I should certainly get into serious trouble.\"    \"You need not be uneasy. He will not try to escape.\"    \"How do you know?\"    \"To fly would be a confession of guilt.\"    \"Then let us go to arrest him.\"    \"I expect him here every instant.\"    \"But why should he come?\"    \"Because I have written and asked him.\"    \"But this is incredible, Mr. Holmes! Why should he come because you  have asked him? Would not such a request rather rouse his suspicions and  cause him to fly?\"    \"I think I have known how to frame the letter,\" said Sherlock Holmes.  \"In fact, if I am not very much mistaken, here is the gentleman himself  coming up the drive.\"    A man was striding up the path which led to the door. He was a tall,  handsome, swarthy fellow, clad in a suit of grey flannel, with a Panama  hat, a bristling black beard, and a great, aggressive hooked nose, and  flourishing a cane as he walked. He swaggered up the path as if the  place belonged to him, and we heard his loud, confident peal at the  bell.    \"I think, gentlemen,\" said Holmes, quietly, \"that we had best take up  our position behind the door. Every precaution is necessary when dealing  with such a fellow. You will need your handcuffs, inspector. You can  leave the talking to me.\"    We waited in silence for a minute--one of those minutes which one can  never forget. Then the door opened and the man stepped in. In an instant  Holmes clapped a pistol to his head and Martin slipped the handcuffs  over his wrists. It was all done so swiftly and deftly that the fellow  was helpless before he knew that he was attacked. He glared from one to  the other of us with a pair of blazing black eyes. Then he burst into a  bitter laugh.    \"Well, gentlemen, you have the drop on me this time. I seem to have  knocked up against something hard. But I came here in answer to a letter  from Mrs. Hilton Cubitt. Don't tell me that she is in this? Don't tell  me that she helped to set a trap for me?\"    \"Mrs. Hilton Cubitt was seriously injured and is at death's door.\"    The man gave a hoarse cry of grief which rang through the house.    \"You're crazy!\" he cried, fiercely. \"It was he that was hurt, not she.  Who would have hurt little Elsie? I may have threatened her, God forgive  me, but I would not have touched a hair of her pretty head. Take it  back--you! Say that she is not hurt!\"    \"She was found badly wounded by the side of her dead husband.\"    He sank with a deep groan on to the settee and buried his face in his  manacled hands. For five minutes he was silent. Then he raised his face  once more, and spoke with the cold composure of despair.    \"I have nothing to hide from you, gentlemen,\" said he. \"If I shot the  man he had his shot at me, and there's no murder in that. But if you  think I could have hurt that woman, then you don't know either me or  her. I tell you there was never a man in this world loved a woman more  than I loved her. I had a right to her. She was pledged to me years ago.  Who was this Englishman that he should come between us? I tell you that  I had the first right to her, and that I was only claiming my own.\"    \"She broke away from your influence when she found the man that you  are,\" said Holmes, sternly. \"She fled from America to avoid you, and she  married an honourable gentleman in England. You dogged her and followed  her and made her life a misery to her in order to induce her to abandon  the husband whom she loved and respected in order to fly with you, whom  she feared and hated. You have ended by bringing about the death of a  noble man and driving his wife to suicide. That is your record in this  business, Mr. Abe Slaney, and you will answer for it to the law.\"    \"If Elsie dies I care nothing what becomes of me,\" said the American.  He opened one of his hands and looked at a note crumpled up in his palm.  \"See here, mister,\" he cried, with a gleam of suspicion in his eyes,  \"you're not trying to scare me over this, are you? If the lady is  hurt as bad as you say, who was it that wrote this note?\" He tossed it  forwards on to the table.    \"I wrote it to bring you here.\"    \"You wrote it? There was no one on earth outside the Joint who knew the  secret of the dancing men. How came you to write it?\"    \"What one man can invent another can discover,\" said Holmes. There is  a cab coming to convey you to Norwich, Mr. Slaney. But, meanwhile, you  have time to make some small reparation for the injury you have wrought.  Are you aware that Mrs. Hilton Cubitt has herself lain under grave  suspicion of the murder of her husband, and that it was only my presence  here and the knowledge which I happened to possess which has saved her  from the accusation? The least that you owe her is to make it clear  to the whole world that she was in no way, directly or indirectly,  responsible for his tragic end.\"    \"I ask nothing better,\" said the American. \"I guess the very best case I  can make for myself is the absolute naked truth.\"    \"It is my duty to warn you that it will be used against you,\" cried the  inspector, with the magnificent fair-play of the British criminal law.    Slaney shrugged his shoulders.    \"I'll chance that,\" said he. \"First of all, I want you gentlemen to  understand that I have known this lady since she was a child. There were  seven of us in a gang in Chicago, and Elsie's father was the boss of the  Joint. He was a clever man, was old Patrick. It was he who invented that  writing, which would pass as a child's scrawl unless you just happened  to have the key to it. Well, Elsie learned some of our ways; but she  couldn't stand"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22101"],[0,"Wood Folk at School (#15)"],[1," grass, driving him from water to bush and back again, jabbing  him at every turn; till a rustle of leaves invited him, and he dashed  blindly into thick underbrush, where her broad wings could not follow.  Then with marvelous watchfulness she saw me standing near in my canoe;  and without a thought, apparently, for the young heron lying so still in  the grass close beside her, she spread her torn wings and flapped away  heavily in the path of her more fortunate younglings.    I followed the fisher's trail into the woods and found him curled up in  a hollow stump. He made slight resistance as I pulled him out. All his  ferocity was already lulled to sleep in the vague, dreamy numbness which  Nature always sends to her stricken creatures. He suffered nothing,  apparently, though he was fearfully wounded; he just wanted to be let  alone. Both eyes were gone, and there was nothing left for me except to  finish mercifully what little Quoskh had left undone.    [Illustration]    When September came, and family cares were over, the colony beyond the  beaver pond scattered widely, returning each one to the shy, wild,  solitary life that Quoskh likes best. Almost anywhere, in the loneliest  places, I might come upon a solitary heron stalking frogs, or chumming  little fish, or treading the soft mud expectantly, like a clam digger,  to find where the mussels were hidden by means of his long toes; or  just standing still to enjoy the sleepy sunshine till the late afternoon  came, when he likes best to go abroad.    They slept no more on the big nest, standing like sentinels against the  twilight glow and the setting moon; but each one picked out a good spot  on the shore and slept as best he could on one leg, waiting for the  early fishing. It was astonishing how carefully even the young birds  picked out a safe position. By day they would stand like statues in the  shade of a bank or among the tall grasses, where they were almost  invisible by reason of their soft colors, and wait for hours for fish  and frogs to come to them. By night each one picked out a spot on the  clean open shore, off a point, generally, where he could see up and  down, where there was no grass to hide an enemy, and where the bushes on  the bank were far enough away so that he could hear the slight rustle of  leaves before the creature that made it was within springing distance.  And there he would sleep safe through the long night, unless disturbed  by my canoe or by some other prowler. Herons see almost as well by night  as by day, and their ears are keen as a weasel's; so I could never get  near enough to surprise them, however silently I paddled. I would hear  only a startled rush of wings, and then a questioning call as they  sailed over me before winging away to quieter beaches.    If I were jacking, with a light blazing brightly before me in my canoe,  to see what night folk I might surprise on the shore, Quoskh was the  only one for whom my jack had no fascination. Deer and moose, foxes and  wild ducks, frogs and fish,--all seemed equally charmed by the great  wonder of a light shining silently out of the vast darkness. I saw them  all, at different times, and glided almost up to them before timidity  drove them away from the strange bright marvel. But Quoskh was not to be  watched in that way, nor to be caught by any such trick. I would see a  vague form on the far edge of the light's pathway; catch the bright  flash of either eye as he swung his weather-vane head; then the vague  form would slide into the upper darkness. A moment's waiting; then,  above me and behind, where the light did not dazzle his eyes, I would  hear his night cry--with more of anger than of questioning in it--and as  I turned the jack upward I would catch a single glimpse of his broad  wings sailing over the lake. Nor would he ever come back, like the fox  on the bank, for a second look to be quite sure what I was.    When the bright, moonlit nights came, there was uneasiness in Quoskh's  wild breast. The solitary life that he loves best claimed him by day;  but at night the old gregarious instinct drew him again to his fellows.  Once, when drifting over the beaver pond through the delicate witchery  of the moonlight, I heard five or six of the great birds croaking  excitedly at the heronry, which they had deserted weeks before. The  lake, and especially the lonely little pond at the end of the trail, was  lovelier than ever before; but something in the south was calling him  away. I think that Quoskh was also moonstruck, as so many wild creatures  are; for, instead of sleeping quietly on the shore, he spent his time  circling aimlessly over the lake and woods, crying his name aloud, or  calling wildly to his fellows.    At midnight of the day before I broke camp, I was out on the lake for a  last paddle in the moonlight. The night was perfect,--clear, cool,  intensely still. Not a ripple broke the great burnished surface of the  lake; a silver pathway stretched away and away over the bow of my  gliding canoe, leading me on to where the great forest stood, silent,  awake, expectant, and flooded through all its dim, mysterious arches  with marvelous light. The wilderness never sleeps. If it grow silent, it  is to listen. To-night the woods were tense as a waiting fox, watching  to see what new thing would come out of the lake, or what strange  mystery would be born under their own soft shadows.    Quoskh was abroad too, bewitched by the moonlight. I heard him calling  and paddled down. He knew me long before he was anything more to me than  a voice of the night, and swept up to meet me. For the first time after  darkness fell I saw him--just a vague, gray shadow with edges touched  softly with silver light, which whirled once over my canoe and looked  down into it. Then he vanished; and from far over on the edge of the  waiting woods, where the mystery was deepest, came a cry, a challenge, a  riddle, the night's wild question which no man has ever yet  answered--_Quoskh? quoskh?_    [Illustration]          UNK WUNK THE PORCUPINE    [Illustration]      A rustling in the brakes just outside my little tent roused me from a  light slumber. There it was again! the push of some heavy animal trying  to move noiselessly through the tangle close at hand; while from the old  lumber camp in the midst of the clearing a low gnawing sound floated up  through the still night. I sat up quickly to listen; but at the slight  movement all was quiet again. The night prowlers had heard me and were  on their guard.    One need have no fear of things that come round in the night. They are  much shyer than you are, and can see you better; so that, if you blunder  towards them, they mistake your blindness for courage, and take to their  heels promptly. As I stepped out there was a double rush in some bushes  behind my tent, and by the light of a half-moon I caught one glimpse of  a bear and her cub jumping away for the shelter of the woods.    The gnawing still went on behind the old shanty by the river. \"Another  cub!\" I thought--for I was new to the big woods--and stole down to peek  by the corner of the camp, in whose yard I had pitched my tent the first  night out in the wilderness.    There was an old molasses hogshead lying just beyond the log camp, its  mouth looking black as ink in the moonlight, and the scratching-gnawing  sounds went on steadily within its shadow. \"He's inside,\" I thought with  elation, \"scraping off the crusted sugar. Now to catch him!\"    I stole round the camp, so as to bring the closed end of the hogshead  between me and the prize, crept up breathlessly, and with a quick jerk  hove the old tub up on end, trapping the creature inside. There was a  thump, a startled scratching and rustling, a violent rocking of the  hogshead, which I tried to hold down; then all was silent in the trap.  \"I've got him!\" I thought, forgetting all about the old she-bear, and  shouted for Simmo to wake up and bring the ax.    We drove a ring of stakes close about the hogshead, weighted it down  with heavy logs, and turned in to sleep. In the morning, with cooler  judgment, we decided that a bear cub was too troublesome a pet to keep  in a tent; so I stood by with a rifle while Simmo hove off the logs and  cut the stakes, keeping a wary eye on me, meanwhile, to see how far he  might trust his life to my nerve in case the cub should be big and  troublesome; for an Indian takes no chances. A stake fell; the hogshead  toppled over by a push from within; Simmo sprang away with a yell; and  out wobbled a big porcupine, the biggest I ever saw, and tumbled away  straight towards my tent. After him went the Indian, making sweeping  cuts at the stupid thing with his ax, and grunting his derision at my  bear cub.    Halfway to the tent Unk Wunk stumbled across a bit of pork rind, and  stopped to nose it daintily. I caught Simmo's arm and stayed the blow  that would have made an end of my catch. Then, between us, Unk Wunk sat  up on his haunches, took the pork in his fore paws and sucked the salt  out of it, as if he had never a concern and never an enemy in the wide  world. A half hour later he loafed into my tent, where I sat repairing a  favorite salmon fly that some hungry sea-trout had torn to tatters, and  drove me unceremoniously out of my own bailiwick in his search for more  salt.    Such a philosopher, whom no prison can dispossess of his peace of mind,  and whom no danger can deprive of his simple pleasures, deserves more  consideration than the naturalists have ever given him. I resolved on  the spot to study him more carefully. As if to discourage all such  attempts and make himself a target for my rifle, he nearly spoiled my  canoe the next night by gnawing a hole through the bark and ribs for  some suggestion of salt that only his greedy nose could possibly have  found.    Once I found him on the trail, some distance from camp, and, having  nothing better to do, I attempted"]]]
