He wrote to his mistress entreating her  to quit the apartments which she occupied at Whitehall, and to go to a  house in Saint James's Square which had been splendidly furnished for  her at his expense. He at the same time promised to allow her a large  pension from his privy purse. Catharine, clever, strongminded, intrepid,  and conscious of her power, refused to stir. In a few months it began  to be whispered that the services of Chiffinch were again employed, and  that the mistress frequently passed and repassed through that private  door through which Father Huddleston had borne the host to the bedside  of Charles. The King's Protestant ministers had, it seems, conceived a  hope that their master's infatuation for this woman might cure him  of the more pernicious infatuation which impelled him to attack their  religion. She had all the talents which could qualify her to play on his  feelings, to make game of his scruples, to set before him in a strong  light the difficulties and dangers into which he was running headlong.  Rochester, the champion of the Church, exerted himself to strengthen her  influence. Ormond, who is popularly regarded as the personification of  all that is pure and highminded in the English Cavalier, encouraged the  design. Even Lady Rochester was not ashamed to cooperate, and that in  the very worst way. Her office was to direct the jealousy of the injured  wife towards a young lady who was perfectly innocent. The whole court  took notice of the coldness and rudeness with which the Queen treated  the poor girl on whom suspicion had been thrown: but the cause of Her  Majesty's ill humour was a mystery. For a time the intrigue went on  prosperously and secretly. Catharine often told the King plainly what  the Protestant Lords of the Council only dared to hint in the most  delicate phrases. His crown, she said, was at stake: the old dotard  Arundell and the blustering Tyrconnel would lead him to his ruin. It is  possible that her caresses might have done what the united exhortations  of the Lords and the Commons, of the House of Austria and the Holy See,  had failed to do, but for a strange mishap which changed the whole face  of affairs. James, in a fit of fondness, determined to make his mistress  Countess of Dorchester in her own right. Catharine saw all the peril of  such a step, and declined the invidious honour. Her lover was obstinate,  and himself forced the patent into her hands. She at last accepted it  on one condition, which shows her confidence in her own power and in  his weakness. She made him give her a solemn promise, not that he would  never quit her, but that, if he did so, he would himself announce his  resolution to her, and grant her one parting interview.    As soon as the news of her elevation got abroad, the whole palace was  in an uproar. The warm blood of Italy boiled in the veins of the Queen.  Proud of her youth and of her charms, of her high rank and of her  stainless chastity, she could not without agonies of grief and rage  see herself deserted and insulted for such a rival. Rochester, perhaps  remembering how patiently, after a short struggle, Catharine of Braganza  had consented to treat the mistresses of Charles with politeness, had  expected that, after a little complaining and pouting, Mary of Modena  would be equally submissive. It was not so. She did not even attempt  to conceal from the eyes of the world the violence of her emotions.  Day after day the courtiers who came to see her dine observed that the  dishes were removed untasted from the table. She suffered the tears to  stream down her cheeks unconcealed in the presence of the whole circle  of ministers and envoys. To the King she spoke with wild vehemence.  \"Let me go,\" she cried. \"You have made your woman a Countess: make her  a Queen. Put my crown on her head. Only let me hide myself in some  convent, where I may never see her more.\" Then, more soberly, she asked  him how he reconciled his conduct to his religious professions. \"You are  ready,\" she said, \"to put your kingdom to hazard for the sake of your  soul; and yet you are throwing away your soul for the sake of that  creature.\" Father Petre, on bended knees, seconded these remonstrances.  It was his duty to do so; and his duty was not the less strenuously  performed because it coincided with his interest. The King went on for  a time sinning and repenting. In his hours of remorse his penances  were severe. Mary treasured up to the end of her life, and at her death  bequeathed to the convent of Chaillot, the scourge with which he had  vigorously avenged her wrongs upon his own shoulders. Nothing but  Catharine's absence could put an end to this struggle between an ignoble  love and an ignoble superstition. James wrote, imploring and commanding  her to depart. He owned that he had promised to bid her farewell in  person. \"But I know too well,\" he added, \"the power which you have over  me. I have not strength of mind enough to keep my resolution if I see  you.\" He offered her a yacht to convey her with all dignity and comfort  to Flanders, and threatened that if she did not go quietly she should be  sent away by force. She at one time worked on his feelings by pretending  to be ill. Then she assumed the airs of a martyr, and impudently  proclaimed herself a sufferer for the Protestant religion. Then again  she adopted the style of John Hampden. She defied the King to remove  her. She would try the right with him. While the Great Charter and the  Habeas Corpus Act were the law of the land, she would live where she  pleased. \"And Flanders,\" she cried; \"never! I have learned one thing  from my friend the Duchess of Mazarin; and that is never to trust myself  in a country where there are convents.\" At length she selected Ireland  as the place of her exile, probably because the brother of her patron  Rochester was viceroy there. After many delays she departed, leaving the  victory to the Queen. [68]    The history of this extraordinary intrigue would be imperfect, if  it were not added that there is still extant a religious meditation,  written by the Treasurer, with his own hand, on the very same day on  which the intelligence of his attempt to govern his master by means of  a concubine was despatched by Bonrepaux to Versailles. No composition of  Ken or Leighton breathes a spirit of more fervent and exalted piety  than this effusion. Hypocrisy cannot be suspected: for the paper was  evidently meant only for the writer's own eye, and was not published  till he had been more than a century in his grave. So much is history  stranger than fiction; and so true is it that nature has caprices which  art dares not imitate. A dramatist would scarcely venture to bring on  the stage a grave prince, in the decline of life, ready to sacrifice his  crown in order to serve the interests of his religion, indefatigable in  making proselytes, and yet deserting and insulting a wife who had youth  and beauty for the sake of a profligate paramour who had neither. Still  less, if possible, would a dramatist venture to introduce a statesman  stooping to the wicked and shameful part of a procurer, and calling in  his wife to aid him in that dishonourable office, yet, in his moments of  leisure, retiring to his closet, and there secretly pouring out his soul  to his God in penitent tears and devout ejaculations. [69]    The Treasurer soon found that, in using scandalous means for the purpose  of obtaining a laudable end, he had committed, not only a crime, but a  folly. The Queen was now his enemy. She affected, indeed, to listen with  civility while the Hydes excused their recent conduct as well as they  could; and she occasionally pretended to use her influence in their  favour: but she must have been more or less than woman if she had really  forgiven the conspiracy which had been formed against her dignity and  her domestic happiness by the family of her husband's first wife. The  Jesuits strongly represented to the King the danger which he had so  narrowly escaped. His reputation, they said, his peace, his soul, had  been put in peril by the machinations of his prime minister. The Nuncio,  who would gladly have counteracted the influence of the violent party,  and cooperated with the moderate members of the cabinet, could not  honestly or decently separate himself on this occasion from Father  Petre. James himself, when parted by the sea from the charms which had  so strongly fascinated him, could not but regard with resentment and  contempt those who had sought to govern him by means of his vices. What  had passed must have had the effect of raising his own Church in his  esteem, and of lowering the Church of England. The Jesuits, whom it  was the fashion to represent as the most unsafe of spiritual guides, as  sophists who refined away the whole system of evangelical morality, as  sycophants who owed their influence chiefly to the indulgence with which  they treated the sins of the great, had reclaimed him from a life of  guilt by rebukes as sharp and bold as those which David had heard  from Nathan and Herod from the Baptist. On the other hand, zealous  Protestants, whose favourite theme was the laxity of Popish casuists  and the wickedness of doing evil that good might come, had attempted  to obtain advantages for their own Church in a way which all Christians  regarded as highly criminal. The victory of the cabal of evil  counsellors was therefore complete. The King looked coldly on Rochester.  The courtiers and foreign ministers soon perceived that the Lord  Treasurer was prime minister only in name. He continued to offer his  advice daily, and had the mortification to find it daily rejected. Yet  he could not prevail on himself to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/244"],[0,"A Study in Scarlet (#15)"],[1,"within, and a playful smile played over her infantile  features. Her plump little white legs terminating in white socks and  neat shoes with shining buckles, offered a strange contrast to the long  shrivelled members of her companion. On the ledge of rock above this  strange couple there stood three solemn buzzards, who, at the sight of  the new comers uttered raucous screams of disappointment and flapped  sullenly away.    The cries of the foul birds awoke the two sleepers who stared about [20]  them in bewilderment. The man staggered to his feet and looked down upon  the plain which had been so desolate when sleep had overtaken him, and  which was now traversed by this enormous body of men and of beasts. His  face assumed an expression of incredulity as he gazed, and he passed his  boney hand over his eyes. \"This is what they call delirium, I guess,\"  he muttered. The child stood beside him, holding on to the skirt of  his coat, and said nothing but looked all round her with the wondering  questioning gaze of childhood.    The rescuing party were speedily able to convince the two castaways that  their appearance was no delusion. One of them seized the little girl,  and hoisted her upon his shoulder, while two others supported her gaunt  companion, and assisted him towards the waggons.    \"My name is John Ferrier,\" the wanderer explained; \"me and that little  un are all that's left o' twenty-one people. The rest is all dead o'  thirst and hunger away down in the south.\"    \"Is she your child?\" asked someone.    \"I guess she is now,\" the other cried, defiantly; \"she's mine 'cause I  saved her. No man will take her from me. She's Lucy Ferrier from this  day on. Who are you, though?\" he continued, glancing with curiosity at  his stalwart, sunburned rescuers; \"there seems to be a powerful lot of  ye.\"    \"Nigh upon ten thousand,\" said one of the young men; \"we are the  persecuted children of God--the chosen of the Angel Merona.\"    \"I never heard tell on him,\" said the wanderer. \"He appears to have  chosen a fair crowd of ye.\"    \"Do not jest at that which is sacred,\" said the other sternly. \"We are  of those who believe in those sacred writings, drawn in Egyptian letters  on plates of beaten gold, which were handed unto the holy Joseph Smith  at Palmyra. We have come from Nauvoo, in the State of Illinois, where we  had founded our temple. We have come to seek a refuge from the violent  man and from the godless, even though it be the heart of the desert.\"    The name of Nauvoo evidently recalled recollections to John Ferrier. \"I  see,\" he said, \"you are the Mormons.\"    \"We are the Mormons,\" answered his companions with one voice.    \"And where are you going?\"    \"We do not know. The hand of God is leading us under the person of our  Prophet. You must come before him. He shall say what is to be done with  you.\"    They had reached the base of the hill by this time, and were surrounded  by crowds of the pilgrims--pale-faced meek-looking women, strong  laughing children, and anxious earnest-eyed men. Many were the cries  of astonishment and of commiseration which arose from them when they  perceived the youth of one of the strangers and the destitution of the  other. Their escort did not halt, however, but pushed on, followed by  a great crowd of Mormons, until they reached a waggon, which was  conspicuous for its great size and for the gaudiness and smartness of  its appearance. Six horses were yoked to it, whereas the others were  furnished with two, or, at most, four a-piece. Beside the driver there  sat a man who could not have been more than thirty years of age, but  whose massive head and resolute expression marked him as a leader. He  was reading a brown-backed volume, but as the crowd approached he laid  it aside, and listened attentively to an account of the episode. Then he  turned to the two castaways.    \"If we take you with us,\" he said, in solemn words, \"it can only be as  believers in our own creed. We shall have no wolves in our fold. Better  far that your bones should bleach in this wilderness than that you  should prove to be that little speck of decay which in time corrupts the  whole fruit. Will you come with us on these terms?\"    \"Guess I'll come with you on any terms,\" said Ferrier, with such  emphasis that the grave Elders could not restrain a smile. The leader  alone retained his stern, impressive expression.    \"Take him, Brother Stangerson,\" he said, \"give him food and drink,  and the child likewise. Let it be your task also to teach him our holy  creed. We have delayed long enough. Forward! On, on to Zion!\"    \"On, on to Zion!\" cried the crowd of Mormons, and the words rippled down  the long caravan, passing from mouth to mouth until they died away in a  dull murmur in the far distance. With a cracking of whips and a creaking  of wheels the great waggons got into motion, and soon the whole caravan  was winding along once more. The Elder to whose care the two waifs  had been committed, led them to his waggon, where a meal was already  awaiting them.    \"You shall remain here,\" he said. \"In a few days you will have recovered  from your fatigues. In the meantime, remember that now and for ever you  are of our religion. Brigham Young has said it, and he has spoken with  the voice of Joseph Smith, which is the voice of God.\"          CHAPTER II. THE FLOWER OF UTAH.      THIS is not the place to commemorate the trials and privations endured  by the immigrant Mormons before they came to their final haven. From the  shores of the Mississippi to the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains  they had struggled on with a constancy almost unparalleled in history.  The savage man, and the savage beast, hunger, thirst, fatigue, and  disease--every impediment which Nature could place in the way, had all  been overcome with Anglo-Saxon tenacity. Yet the long journey and the  accumulated terrors had shaken the hearts of the stoutest among them.  There was not one who did not sink upon his knees in heartfelt prayer  when they saw the broad valley of Utah bathed in the sunlight beneath  them, and learned from the lips of their leader that this was the  promised land, and that these virgin acres were to be theirs for  evermore.    Young speedily proved himself to be a skilful administrator as well as a  resolute chief. Maps were drawn and charts prepared, in which the future  city was sketched out. All around farms were apportioned and allotted in  proportion to the standing of each individual. The tradesman was put  to his trade and the artisan to his calling. In the town streets and  squares sprang up, as if by magic. In the country there was draining  and hedging, planting and clearing, until the next summer saw the whole  country golden with the wheat crop. Everything prospered in the strange  settlement. Above all, the great temple which they had erected in the  centre of the city grew ever taller and larger. From the first blush of  dawn until the closing of the twilight, the clatter of the hammer  and the rasp of the saw was never absent from the monument which the  immigrants erected to Him who had led them safe through many dangers.    The two castaways, John Ferrier and the little girl who had shared his  fortunes and had been adopted as his daughter, accompanied the Mormons  to the end of their great pilgrimage. Little Lucy Ferrier was borne  along pleasantly enough in Elder Stangerson's waggon, a retreat which  she shared with the Mormon's three wives and with his son, a headstrong  forward boy of twelve. Having rallied, with the elasticity of childhood,  from the shock caused by her mother's death, she soon became a pet  with the women, and reconciled herself to this new life in her moving  canvas-covered home. In the meantime Ferrier having recovered from his  privations, distinguished himself as a useful guide and an indefatigable  hunter. So rapidly did he gain the esteem of his new companions, that  when they reached the end of their wanderings, it was unanimously agreed  that he should be provided with as large and as fertile a tract of land  as any of the settlers, with the exception of Young himself, and of  Stangerson, Kemball, Johnston, and Drebber, who were the four principal  Elders.    On the farm thus acquired John Ferrier built himself a substantial  log-house, which received so many additions in succeeding years that it  grew into a roomy villa. He was a man of a practical turn of mind,  keen in his dealings and skilful with his hands. His iron constitution  enabled him to work morning and evening at improving and tilling his  lands. Hence it came about that his farm and all that belonged to  him prospered exceedingly. In three years he was better off than his  neighbours, in six he was well-to-do, in nine he was rich, and in twelve  there were not half a dozen men in the whole of Salt Lake City who could  compare with him. From the great inland sea to the distant Wahsatch  Mountains there was no name better known than that of John Ferrier.    There was one way and only one in which he offended the susceptibilities  of his co-religionists. No argument or persuasion could ever induce him  to set up a female establishment after the manner of his companions. He  never gave reasons for this persistent refusal, but contented himself by  resolutely and inflexibly adhering to his determination. There were some  who accused him of lukewarmness in his adopted religion, and others who  put it down to greed of wealth and reluctance to incur expense. Others,  again, spoke of some early love affair, and of a fair-haired girl who  had pined away on the shores of the Atlantic. Whatever the reason,  Ferrier remained strictly celibate. In every other respect he conformed  to the religion of the young settlement, and gained the name of being an  orthodox and straight-walking man.    Lucy Ferrier grew up within the log-house, and assisted her adopted  father in all his undertakings. The keen"]]]
