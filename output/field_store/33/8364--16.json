I had ridden hard in order  to catch them up as I had been in the early morning with the Ninth  Division, which did not arrive until four o'clock, and when I came up I  was just in time to see the Buffs, leading the 13th Brigade, preparing  to clear some kopjes near the main ridge which were held by the Boers.  Things were very hot here, and as I had never been in a big fight before  I found it very difficult to realise what was going on, or where the  enemy was, or where the fire was coming from, or at what point it was  being directed. All I knew for some time was that there were shells  dropping rather closer than was pleasant, and that with a rashness born  of ignorance I had got into a place where everyone had to lie down for  cover.    When your face is in the sand you do not see much. What you hear is not  encouraging--the distant boom of a gun, a few seconds' silence, then a  long quavering whistle in the air, like the cry of a banshee, growing  every moment nearer and louder, and finally the deafening report  somewhere near you. You never know where a shell is going to burst,  although you hear it long before it arrives; you can only sit tight and  hope that it will go where the other fellows are, or better still where  no one is. To say truth, shells generally go where no one is; I saw only  one man killed by a shell. I had raised my head from the ground and was  listening for the burst of a coming shell, when I saw a man among the  advance ranks of the 13th Brigade on my right stop suddenly in the midst  of a blinding flash. An arm and hand flew through the air in a horrible  curve; the smoke belched, the air was rent by the explosion, the smoke  blew and drifted away, and there on the hillside lay what was left of  the man, folded in the deep quietness of death.    A little to the left the Welsh Regiment was advancing up the steep side  of Alexander's kopje, which was doubly enfiladed by the Boer guns; two  Elswicks firing from the east and a Vickers-Maxim from the south-west.  There was also a nasty rain of bullets. In the long semi-circular  skirmishing line, strung like a girdle round the hillside, a man  suddenly turned and ran backwards for half a dozen paces, and then  tumbled, rolling over and over like a shot rabbit. I saw him five  minutes later when his body was brought to the dressing-station; he had  been shot through the heart. Poor fellow! He ran not of his own  conscious volition; he was killed while bravely advancing; he died while  retreating. The Welsh Regiment was losing badly all this time, and the  ground was becoming dotted with writhing and motionless bodies; it was a  horrible sight and came near to turning me sick, so I resolved to go and  see what was happening on the south side.    I made a long detour round by the headquarter farmhouse towards which  the black mass of the Ninth Division was advancing across the plain--too  late, as it turned out, to join in the action. Seeing a kopje on our  extreme right from which our artillery seemed to be firing, I rode in  that direction. There was not a soul in sight; and when I was within a  thousand yards of the place the instinct which so often interferes to  keep our heads from betraying us made me pull up. There was not a sound  except the far-away bang of guns and rifles. Near to the kopje there was  a garden surrounded by low trees and a hedge of prickly pear. The sun  setting behind us slanted into it and made it appear as a charming,  peaceful shelter from the dust and noise of the battle. I was still  debating with myself as to whether I should go on a little farther when  I heard behind me the sound of a horse galloping. I turned round and  saw, perhaps two miles behind me, three mounted men. The one who now  rode up had evidently just left them. He was a trooper in Rimington's  Guides.    \"Beg pardon, sir,\" he said, \"but I wouldn't stay here if I was you.\"    \"Why not?\" said the Green One; \"no one in front, is there?\"    The man spat on the ground.    \"Don't know that there is, sir,\" he said, \"but then I don't know that  there isn't, and that's good enough for me. If there _is_ anyone in  that garden\"--and he pointed to the patch of trees--\"you bet they won't  send out a flag of truce asking you to get out of the way before they  shoot. We've been sent to round up cattle out of that there garden, but  I believe the cattle are all a blind. Anyway, I'm not going near it till  I'm sure of it. I believe it's a trap.\"    They must have been watching us from the garden with their eyes on the  sights of their rifles, for no sooner had we turned our horses' heads  than _bang, bang, bang, bang--phtt, phtt, phtt, phtt_! We doubled  ourselves on our saddles and our horses stretched along the road, while  for perhaps thirty seconds our ears twitched to a hail of bullets that  lasted until we were out of range. While we were still racing my pony,  which was last, suddenly jumped into the air and shot past the big  cavalry horse, laying herself flat on the ground like a hare; and it was  not until she had carried me far out of range that I found the warm  blood from a bullet wound running down her leg. I had no further  interest that day but to have her attended to. At any rate, I think the  shot which was fired at her was one of the last fired in the battle of  Dreifontein.    The battle was fought on Saturday, March 10th. On Sunday morning we  found that the Boers had melted away from before us, and the army  marched on twelve miles to Aasvoegel's Kop. On Monday the main body was  at Venters Vlei; and at four o'clock that afternoon General French,  after an artillery engagement, occupied a few hills commanding  Bloemfontein, and sent in an ultimatum requiring the surrender of the  town within twenty-four hours.    Early on Tuesday morning Mr. Gwynne (Reuter's correspondent), Mr.  Oppenheim, of the _Daily News_, and another correspondent, rode into  Bloemfontein and found that President Steyn had departed during the  night, that the Boer forces had retired from the immediate neighbourhood  of the town, and that the people were willing to surrender. They rode  back to Lord Roberts (who was by this time well under weigh with his  column), escorting the Landdrost in his Cape cart. The Field Marshal  was, I believe, sitting on a low hill having breakfast with his staff  when the keys were delivered up to him. This formality was conducted  with the utmost courtesy and good-humour, and when it was over the march  was resumed. Lord Roberts rode on and joined the cavalry, and a  procession was formed about three miles out of the town, Lord Roberts at  the head of the cavalry brigade which preceded the army. I shall never  forget that ride down the sloping country into Bloemfontein; the little  white-haired man sitting his horse like a rock, leading; then the  personal staff; then the general staff; then the foreign attaches; then  the correspondents; then the cavalry staff; then the cavalry; then the  main body of the army--artillery, infantry, engineers, commissariat, and  baggage.    As we came into the first street of the town it was apparent that the  day was regarded as a festival. One could hardly imagine a stranger  reception of an invader. Flags flew at every window, and the people were  all decked out as though for a holiday. Half-way towards the Presidency  there was a little diversion. Some Kaffirs, thinking that this was a  good opportunity of paying off old scores, had begun to loot and pillage  a large building like a school-house, which belonged to the Free State  Government. As we swung round the corner of the street they were in the  act of bundling out mattresses, bedsteads, linen, chairs, desks, and  tables, and carrying them off. A few dozen Lancers were let loose  amongst them; they dropped their booty and fled, only to be driven back  at the point of a lance and made to replace the stolen property. Then  the march was resumed until the procession drew up in front of the  Presidency. The Federal flag had been struck some time before, and the  flagstaff now stood gaunt and undecorated. There was a pause of about  ten minutes while Lord Roberts went in and transacted some necessary  formalities; then the little silk Union Jack, made by Lady Roberts, was  run up to the truck amid a great sound of cheering. The singing of the  National Anthem ended the ceremony. The town seemed altogether  English--English shops, English manners, the English language, and  English faces. All that day enthusiasm bubbled in the town like water  boiling in a pot; all day the troops continued to march in; shabby and  dusty and dirty and tired, they were nevertheless all stamped with some  nameless quality which they had not when they left England. All day the  population of Bloemfontein eddied through the streets like a crowd at a  fair; all day the sounds of rejoicing continued, and far into the night  the streets resounded to the cries of people who made merry.          XII    RETRACING THE STEPS OF THE ARMY      With its independence, handed over amid the imposing circumstance of  arms, Bloemfontein lost something of its charm. The noise and dust and  commotion of the army did violence to its pastoral quietness, and the  pretty shops put up their shutters at midday as though in maidenly  horror at the eagerness of crowds of soldiers running amuck like  children with their Saturday pennies. I entered the town early enough to  see what its normal condition must be, and there was something rude and  unkind in the din of the multitude breaking on this quiet place where  the bees sang loud in the streets, and the midday idler slumbered upon  the doorstep.    To be sure, one had opportunity for studying the soldier in a new  setting, but the study is one that requires time; the average Tommy is  an oyster to strangers. He varies to the tune and colour of his  surroundings; on the veldt, where"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2391"],[0,"Bruce (#15)"],[1,"circle, touched something fast-moving  and furry.    \"Bruce!\" he whispered fiercely, tightening his precarious grip on the  wisp of fur his fingers had touched. \"Bruce! Stand still, boy! It's YOU  who's got to get us clear of this! Nobody else, short of the good Lord,  can do it!\"    Bruce had had a pleasantly lazy day with his friends in the first-line  trenches. There had been much good food and more petting. And at last,  comfortably tired of it all, he had gone to sleep. He had awakened in a  most friendly mood, and a little hungry. Wherefore he had sallied forth  in search of human companionship. He found plenty of soldiers who were  more than willing to talk to him and make much of him. But, a little  farther ahead, he saw his good friend, Sergeant Mahan, and others of  his acquaintances, starting over the parapet on what promised to be a  jolly evening stroll.    All dogs find it hard to resist the mysterious lure of a walk in human  companionship. True, the night was not an ideal one for a ramble, and  the fog had a way of congealing wetly on Bruce's shaggy coat. Still, a  damp coat was not enough of a discomfort to offset the joy of a stroll  with his friends. So Bruce had followed the twelve men quietly into No  Man's Land, falling decorously into step behind Mahan.    It had not been much of a walk, for speed or for fun. For the humans  went ridiculously slowly, and had an eccentric way of bunching  together, every now and again, and then of stringing out into a  shambling line. Still, it was a walk, and therefore better than loafing  behind in the trenches. And Bruce had kept his noiseless place at the  Sergeant's heels.    Then--long before Mahan heard the approaching tramp of feet--Bruce  caught not only the sound but the scent of the German platoon. The  scent at once told him that the strangers were not of his own army. A  German soldier and an American soldier--because of their difference in  diet as well as for certain other and more cogent reasons--have by no  means the same odor, to a collie's trained scent, nor to that of other  breeds of war-dogs. Official records of dog-sentinels prove that.    Aliens were nearing Bruce's friends. And the dog's ruff began to stand  up. But Mahan and the rest seemed in no way concerned in spirit  thereby--though, to the dog's understanding, they must surely be aware  of the approach. So Bruce gave no further sign of displeasure. He was  out for a walk, as a guest. He was not on sentry-duty.    But when the nearest German was almost upon them, and all twelve  Americans dropped to the ground, the collie became interested once  more. A German stepped on the hand of one of his newest friends. And  the friend yelled in pain. Whereat the German made as if to strike the  stepped-on man.    This was quite enough for loyal Bruce. Without so much as a growl of  warning, he jumped at the offender.    Dog and man tumbled earthward together. Then after an instant of flurry  and noise, Bruce felt Mahan's fingers on his shoulder and heard the  stark appeal of Mahan's whispered voice. Instantly the dog was a  professional soldier once more--alertly obedient and resourceful.    \"Catch hold my left arm, Lieutenant!\" Mahan was exhorting. \"Close up,  there, boys--every man's hand grabbing tight to the shoulder of the man  on his left! Pass the word. And you, Missouri, hang onto the  Lieutenant! Quick, there! And tread soft and tread fast, and don't let  go, whatever happens! Not a sound out of any one! I'm leading the way.  And Bruce is going to lead me.\"    There was a scurrying scramble as the men groped for one another. Mahan  tightened his hold on Bruce's mane.    \"Bruce!\" he said, very low, but with a strength of appeal that was not  lost on the listening dog. \"Bruce! Camp! Back to CAMP! And keep QUIET!  Back to camp, boy! CAMP!\"    He had no need to repeat his command so often and so strenuously. Bruce  was a trained courier. The one word \"Camp!\" was quite enough to tell  him what he was to do.    Turning, he faced the American lines and tried to break into a gallop.  His scent and his knowledge of direction were all the guides he needed.  A dog always relies on his nose first and his eyes last. The fog was no  obstacle at all to the collie. He understood the Sergeant's order, and  he set out at once to obey it.    But at the very first step, he was checked. Mahan did not release that  feverishly tight hold on his mane, but merely shifted to his collar.    Bruce glanced back, impatient at the delay. But Mahan did not let go.  Instead he said once more:    \"CAMP, boy!\"    And Bruce understood he was expected to make his way to camp, with  Mahan hanging on to his collar.    Bruce did not enjoy this mode of locomotion. It was inconvenient, and  there seemed no sense in it; but there were many things about this  strenuous war-trade that Bruce neither enjoyed nor comprehended, yet  which he performed at command.    So again he turned campward, Mahan at his collar and an annoyingly  hindering tail of men stumbling silently on behind them. All around  were the Germans--butting drunkenly through the blanket-dense fog,  swinging their rifles like flails, shouting confused orders,  occasionally firing. Now and then two or more of them would collide and  would wrestle in blind fury, thinking they had encountered an American.    Impeded by their own sightlessly swarming numbers, as much as by the  impenetrable darkness, they sought the foe. And but for Bruce they must  quickly have found what they sought. Even in compact form, the  Americans could not have had the sheer luck to dodge every scattered  contingent of Huns which starred the German end of No Man's Land--most  of them between the fugitives and the American lines.    But Bruce was on dispatch duty. It was his work to obey commands and to  get back to camp at once. It was bad enough to be handicapped by  Mahan's grasp on his collar. He was not minded to suffer further delay  by running into any of the clumps of gesticulating and cabbage-reeking  Germans between him and his goal. So he steered clear of such groups,  making several wide detours in order to do so. Once or twice he stopped  short to let some of the Germans grope past him, not six feet away.  Again he veered sharply to the left--increasing his pace and forcing  Mahan and the rest to increase theirs--to avoid a squad of thirty men  who were quartering the field in close formation, and who all but  jostled the dog as they strode sightlessly by. An occasional rifle-shot  spat forth its challenge. From both trench-lines men were firing at a  venture. A few of the bullets sang nastily close to the twelve huddled  men and their canine leader. Once a German, not three yards away,  screamed aloud and fell sprawling and kicking, as one such chance  bullet found him. Above and behind, sounded the plop of star-shells  sent up by the enemy in futile hope of penetrating the viscid fog. And  everywhere was heard the shuffle and stumbling of innumerable boots.    At last the noise of feet began to die away, and the uneven groping  tread of the twelve Americans to sound more distinctly for the  lessening of the surrounding turmoil. And in another few seconds Bruce  came to a halt--not to an abrupt stop, as when he had allowed an enemy  squad to pass in front of him, but a leisurely checking of speed, to  denote that he could go no farther with the load he was helping to haul.    Mahan put out his free hand. It encountered the American wires. Bruce  had stopped at the spot where the party had cut a narrow path through  the entanglement on the outward journey. Alone, the dog could easily  have passed through the gap, but he could not be certain of pulling  Mahan with him. Wherefore the halt.          *      *      *      *      *    The last of the twelve men scrambled down to safety, in the American  first-line trench, Bruce among them. The lieutenant went straight to  his commanding officer, to make his report. Sergeant Mahan went  straight to his company cook, whom he woke from a snoreful sleep.  Presently Mahan ran back to where the soldiers were gathered admiringly  around Bruce.    The Sergeant carried a chunk of fried beef, for which he had just given  the cook his entire remaining stock of cigarettes.    \"Here you are, Bruce!\" he exclaimed. \"The best in the shop is none too  good for the dog that got us safe out of that filthy mess. Eat hearty!\"    Bruce did not so much as sniff at the (more or less) tempting bit of  meat. Coldly he looked up at Mahan. Then, with sensitive ears laid flat  against his silken head, in token of strong contempt, he turned his  back on the Sergeant and walked away.    Which was Bruce's method of showing what he thought of a human fool who  would give him a command and who would then hold so tightly to him that  the dog could hardly carry out the order.        CHAPTER V. The Double Cross    In the background lay a landscape that had once been beautiful. In the  middle distance rotted a village that had once been alive. In the  foreground stood an edifice that had once been a church. The  once-beautiful landscape had the look of a gigantic pockmarked face, so  scored was it by shell-scar and crater. Its vegetation was swept away.  Its trees were shattered stumps. Its farmsteads were charred piles of  rubble.    The village was unlike the general landscape, in that it had never been  beautiful. In spite of globe-trotters' sentimental gush, not all  villages of northern France were beautiful. Many were built for thrift  and for comfort and for expediency; not for architectural or natural  loveliness.    But this village of Meran-en-Laye was not merely deprived of what  beauty it once might or might not have possessed. Except by courtesy it  was no longer a village at all. It was a double row of squalid ruins,  zig-zagging along the two sides of what was left of its main street.  Here and there a cottage or tiny shop or shed was still"]]]
