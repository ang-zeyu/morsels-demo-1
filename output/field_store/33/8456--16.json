Birds, whom nature has deprived of teeth, have a  strong muscular stomach, called the gizzard, which serves the  purposes of teeth, and they even take into the stomach small pieces  of grit, to assist in grinding to a powder the grain that they have  swallowed.    Among those parts of the mouth which contribute to the preparation of  the food, we must reckon the numerous glands which secrete saliva,  and which have therefore been called salivary glands. The saliva is a  saponaceous liquor, destitute of taste or smell, which is squeezed  out from these glands, and mixed with the food during mastication. In  the mouth, therefore, the food becomes first broken down by the  teeth, impregnated with saliva, and reduced to a soft pasty  substance, capable of passing with these, through the oesophagus,  into the stomach. It is here that it undergoes the change, which is  particularly termed digestion.    Digestion comprehends two classes of phenomena, distinct from each  other: 1st. Physical and chemical: 2nd. Organic and vital. The object  of the first, is to bring the alimentary substances to such a state  as is necessary, that they may be capable of the new combinations  into which they are to enter, to obtain the animal character. The  object of the second is, to produce those combinations which some  have thought to be very different from those produced by simple  chemical attractions.    The physical and chemical phenomena of digestion, relate chiefly,  1st. To the action of heat; 2ndly. To the dissolution of the  alimentary substances. The heat of the animal is such, as is well  fitted to promote solution.    That digestion is performed by solution, is evident, from several  experiments, particularly those made by Dr. Stevens, who enclosed  different alimentary substances in hollow spheres of silver, pierced  with small holes. These were swallowed, and after remaining some time  in the stomach, the contents were found dissolved. The great agent of  solution is the gastric juice, which possesses a very strong solvent  power. This juice is secreted by the arteries of the stomach; it may  be collected in considerable quantity, by causing an animal that has  been fasting for some time, to swallow small hollow spheres, or tubes  of metal filled with sponge.    This liquid does not act indiscriminately upon all substances; for if  grains of corn be put into a perforated tube, and a granivorous bird  be made to swallow it, the corn will remain the usual time in the  stomach without alteration; whereas if the husk of the grain be  previously taken off, the whole of it will be dissolved. There are  many substances likewise which pass unaltered through the intestines  of animals, and consequently are not acted upon by the gastric juice.  This is the case frequently with grains of oats, when they have been  swallowed by horses entire, with their husks on. This is the case  likewise with the seeds of apples and other fruits, when swallowed  entire by man; yet if these substances have been previously ground by  the teeth, they will be digested. It would appear therefore, that it  is chiefly the husk or outside of these substances which resists the  action of the gastric juice.    This juice is not the same in all animals; for many animals cannot  digest the food on which others live. Thus sheep live wholly on  vegetables, and if they are made to feed on animals, their stomachs  will not digest them: others again, as the eagle, feed wholly on  animal substances, and cannot digest vegetables.    The accounts of the experiments made on gastric juice are very  various: sometimes it has been found of an acid nature, at other  times not. The experiments of Spallanzani show, however, that this  acidity is not owing to the gastric juice, but to the food. The  result of his experiments, which have been very numerous, prove, that  the gastric juice is naturally neither acid nor alkaline. No  conclusion, however, can be drawn from these experiments made out of  the stomach, with respect to the nature of the gastric juice; nor do  the analyses which have been made of it throw any light on its mode  of action. But, from the experiments which have been made on  digestion, in the stomach, particularly by Spallanzani, the following  facts have been established.    The gastric juice attacks the surfaces of bodies, and combines  chemically with their particles. It operates with more energy and  rapidity, the more the food is divided, and its action increased by a  warm temperature. By the action of digestion, the food is not merely  reduced to very minute parts, but its chemical properties become  changed; its sensible properties are destroyed, and it acquires new  and very different ones. This juice does not act as a ferment; so far  from it, it is a powerful antiseptic, and even restores flesh which  is already putrid.    When the alimentary substances have continued a sufficient time in  the stomach, they are pushed into the intestines, where they become  mixed with the bile and pancreatic juice, as was before observed.  What changes are caused by these substances, we have yet to learn;  but there is no doubt, that they serve some important purposes. By  the peristaltic motion of the bowels, the alimentary matters thus  changed are carried along, and applied to the mouths of the lacteal  vessels, which open into the intestines, like a sponge, and by some  power, not well understood, absorb that part which is fitted for  assimilation, while the remainder is rejected as an excrement.    The lacteal vessels are furnished with valves, which allow a free  passage to the chyle from the intestines, but prevent its return. The  most inexplicable thing in this operation, is the power which these  vessels possess of selecting from the intestinal mass, those  substances which are proper for nutrition, and rejecting those which  are not.    These lacteal vessels, as was before observed, pass through the  mesentery, and their contents seem to undergo some important change  in the mesenteric glands. The chyle which passes through vessels,  appears to be an oily liquor, less animalised than milk, and its  particles seem to be held in solution by the intermedium of a  mucilaginous principle. It is conveyed along the thoracic duct in the  manner already described, and enters the blood slowly, and, as it  were, drop by drop, by the subclavian vein; in this way it becomes  intimately mixed with the blood, and combining with oxygen in the  lungs, it acquires a fibrous character, and becomes fit to nourish  the body.    We have now seen how the process of digestion is performed, at least,  so far as we are acquainted with it, and how its products are  conveyed into the blood. But to what purposes the blood is employed,  which is formed with so much care, we have yet to discover. It seems  to answer two purposes. The parts of which the body is composed,  namely, bones, muscles, ligaments, membranes, &c. are continually  changing: in youth they are increasing in size and strength, and in  mature age they are continually acting, and, consequently,  continually liable to waste and decay. They are often exposed to  accidents, which render them unfit for performing their various  functions; and even when no such accidents happen, it seems necessary  for the health of the system that they should be perpetually renewed.  Materials must therefore be provided for repairing, increasing, or  renewing all the various organs of the body. The bones require  phosphate of lime, and gelatine, the muscles fibrine, and the  cartilages and membranes albumen; and accordingly we find all these  substances contained in the blood, from whence they are drawn, as  from a storehouse, whenever they are wanted. The process by which  these different parts of the blood become various parts of the body  is called assimilation.    Over the nature of assimilation the thickest darkness still hangs;  all that we know for certain is, that there are some conditions  necessary to its action, without which it cannot take place. These  are, 1. A sound and uninterrupted state of the nerves. 2. A sound  state of the blood vessels. 3. A certain degree of tone or vigour in  the vessels of the part.    There remains yet to be noticed another set of vessels, connected  with the circulating and nutritive systems, called lymphatics. These  vessels are very minute, and filled with a transparent fluid: they  rise by open mouths in every cavity of the body, as well as from  every part of the surface, and the course of those from the lower  extremities, and indeed from most of the lower parts of the body, is  towards the thoracic duct, which they enter at the same time with the  lacteal vessels already described. They are furnished, like the  lacteals, with numerous valves, which prevent their contents from  returning towards their extremities.    The minute arteries in every part of the body exhale a colourless  fluid, for lubricating the different parts, and other important  purposes: and the lymphatic vessels absorb the superfluous quantity  of this fluid, and convey it back to the blood.    It must be evident therefore, that, if the lymphatics in any cavity  become debilitated, or by any other means be prevented from absorbing  this exhaled fluid, an accumulation of it will take place: the same  will happen, if the exhaling arteries be debilitated, so as to allow  a greater quantity of fluid to escape than the absorbents can take  up. When the balance between exhalation and absorption is destroyed,  by either or both of these means, a dropsy will be the consequence.    Before we finish the subject of digestion, I shall take a short view  of some of the morbid affections, attending this important function  of the animal economy.    A deficiency of appetite may arise, either from an affection of the  stomach, or a morbid state of the body: for there"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27778"],[0,"Outlines of Dairy Bacteriology, 8th edition (#15)"],[1,"indirectly serves as an agent in the dissemination of  disease, by giving conditions favorable to the growth of the disease  germ.    By far the most important of diseases that may be transmitted directly  from animal to man through a diseased milk supply is tuberculosis, but  in addition to this, foot and mouth disease (aphthous fever in  children), anthrax and acute enteric troubles have also been traced to a  similar source of infection.    The most important specific diseases that have been disseminated through  subsequent pollution of the milk are typhoid fever, diphtheria, scarlet  fever and cholera, but, of course, the possibility exists that any  disease germ capable of living and thriving in milk may be spread in  this way. In addition to these diseases that are caused by the  introduction of specific organisms (the causal organism of scarlet fever  has not yet been definitely determined), there are a large number of  more or less illy-defined troubles of an intestinal character that occur  especially in infants and young children that are undoubtedly  attributable to the activity of microorganisms that gain access to milk  during and subsequent to the milking, and which produce changes in milk  before or after its ingestion that result in the formation of toxic  products.      DISEASES TRANSMISSIBLE FROM ANIMAL TO MAN THROUGH DISEASED MILK.    ~Tuberculosis.~ In view of the wide-spread distribution of this disease in  both the human and the bovine race, the relation of the same to milk  supplies is a question of great importance. It is now generally admitted  that the different types of tubercular disease found in different kinds  of animals and man are attributable to the development of the same  organism, _Bacillus tuberculosis_, although there are varieties of this  organism found in different species of animals that are sufficiently  distinct to permit of recognition.    The question of prime importance is, whether the bovine type is  transmissible to the human or not. Artificial inoculation of cattle with  tuberculous human sputum as well as pure cultures of this variety show  that the human type is able to make but slight headway in cattle. This  would indicate that the danger of cattle acquiring the infection from  man would in all probability be very slight, but these experiments offer  no answer as to the possibility of transmission from the bovine to the  human. Manifestly it is impossible to solve this problem by direct  experiment upon man except by artificial inoculation, but comparative  experiments upon animals throw some light on the question.    Theo. Smith[81] and others[82] have made parallel experiments with  animals such as guinea pigs, rabbits and pigeons, inoculated with both  bovine and human cultures of this organism. The results obtained in the  case of all animals tested show that the virulence of the two types was  much different, but that the bovine cultures were much more severe.  While of course this does not prove that transmission from bovine to  human is possible, still the importance of the fact must not be  overlooked.    In a number of cases record of accidental infection from cattle to man  has been noted.[83] These have occurred with persons engaged in making  post-mortem examinations on tuberculous animals, and the tubercular  nature of the wound was proven in some cases by excision and  inoculation.    In addition to data of this sort that is practically experimental in  character, there are also strong clinical reasons for considering that  infection of human beings may occur through the medium of milk.  Naturally such infection should produce intestinal tuberculosis, and it  is noteworthy that this phase of the disease is quite common in  children especially between the ages of two and five.[84] It is  difficult to determine, though, whether primary infection occurred  through the intestine, for, usually, other organs also become involved.  In a considerable number of cases in which tubercular infection by the  most common channel, inhalation, seems to be excluded, the evidence is  strong that the disease was contracted through the medium of the milk,  but it is always very difficult to exclude the possibility of pulmonary  infection.    Tuberculosis as a bovine disease has increased rapidly during recent  decades throughout many portions of the world. This has been most marked  in dairy regions. Its extremely insidious nature does not permit of an  early recognition by physical means, and it was not until the  introduction of the tuberculin test[85] in 1892, as a diagnostic aid  that accurate knowledge of its distribution was possible. The quite  general introduction of this test in many regions has revealed an  alarmingly large percentage of animals as affected. In Denmark in 1894  over forty per cent were diagnosed as tubercular. In some parts of  Germany almost as bad a condition has been revealed. Slaughter-house  statistics also show that the disease has increased rapidly since 1890.  In this country the disease on the average is much less than in Europe  and is also very irregularly distributed. In herds where it gained a  foothold some years ago, often the majority of animals are frequently  infected; many herds, in fact the great majority, are wholly free from  all taint. The disease has undoubtedly been most frequently introduced  through the purchase of apparently healthy but incipiently affected  animals. Consequently in the older dairy regions where stock has been  improved the most by breeding, more of the disease exists than among the  western and southern cattle.    [Illustration FIG. 21: Front view of a tuberculous udder, showing extent  of swelling in single quarter.]    ~Infectiousness of milk of reacting animals.~ Where the disease appears in  the udder the milk almost invariably contains the tubercle organism.  Under such conditions the appearance of the milk is not materially  altered at first, but as the disease progresses the percentage of fat  generally diminishes, and at times in the more advanced stages where the  physical condition of the udder is changed (Fig. 21), the milk may  become \"watery\"; but the percentage of animals showing such udder  lesions is not large, usually not more than a few per cent. (4 per cent.  according to Ostertag.)    On the other hand, in the earlier phases of the disease, where its  presence has been recognized solely by the aid of the tuberculin test,  before there are any recognizable physical symptoms in any part of the  animal, the milk is generally unaffected. Between these extremes,  however, is found a large proportion of cases, concerning which so  definite data are not available. The results of investigators on this  point are conflicting and further information is much desired. Some have  asserted so long as the udder itself shows no lesions that no tubercle  bacilli would be present,[86] but the findings of a considerable number  of investigators[87] indicate that even when the udder is apparently not  diseased the milk may contain the specific organism as revealed by  inoculation experiments upon animals. In some cases, however, it has  been demonstrated by post-mortem examination that discoverable udder  lesions existed that were not recognizable before autopsy was made. In  the experimental evidence collected, a varying percentage of reacting  animals were found that gave positive results; and this number was  generally sufficient to indicate that the danger of using milk from  reacting animals was considerable, even though apparently no disease  could be found in the udder.    The infectiousness of milk can also be proven by the frequent  contraction of the disease in other animals, such as calves and pigs  which may be fed on the skim milk. The very rapid increase of the  disease among the swine of Germany and Denmark,[88] and the frequently  reported cases of intestinal infection of young stock also attest the  presence of the organism in milk.    The tubercle bacillus is so markedly parasitic in its habits, that,  under ordinary conditions, it is incapable of growing at normal air  temperatures. There is, therefore, no danger of the germ developing in  milk after it is drawn from the animal, unless the same is kept at  practically blood heat.    Even though the milk of some reacting animals may not contain the  dangerous organism at the time of making the test, it is quite  impossible to foretell how long it will remain free. As the disease  becomes more generalized, or if tuberculous lesions should develop in  the udder, the milk may pass from a healthy to an infectious state.    This fact makes it advisable to exclude from milk supplies intended for  human use, all milk of animals that respond to the tuberculin test; or  at least to treat it in a manner so as to render it safe. Whether it is  necessary to do this or not if the milk is made into butter or cheese is  a somewhat different question. Exclusion or treatment is rendered more  imperative in milk supplies, because the danger is greater with children  with whom milk is often a prominent constituent of their diet, and also  for the reason that the child is more susceptible to intestinal  infection than the adult.    The danger of infection is much lessened in butter or cheese, because  the processes of manufacture tend to diminish the number of organisms  originally present in the milk, and inasmuch as no growth can ordinarily  take place in these products the danger is minimized. Moreover, the fact  that these foods are consumed by the individual in smaller amounts than  is generally the case where milk is used, and also to a greater extent  by adults, lessens still further the danger of infection.    Notwithstanding this, numerous observers[89] especially in Germany have  succeeded in finding the tubercle bacillus in market butter, but this  fact is not so surprising when it is remembered that a very large  fraction of"]]]
