Household and similar duties soon began to claim attention in and around  the riverside dwelling. The green grass was growing rapidly under the  withered blades that arched the run-ways between the river's brink and  the woodland path; and, as the voles desired to keep these run-ways  clear, they assiduously cut off all encroaching stems and brushed them  aside. The stems dried, and in several places formed a screen beneath  which the movements of the voles were not easily discernible. Selecting  the best of the dry grass-stalks, the voles carried them home, and,  after much labour, varied with much consultation in which small  differences of opinion evidently occurred, completed, in the sleeping  chamber beneath the willow-roots, a large, round nest. The magnitude of  their labour could be easily inferred from the appearance of the nest:  each grass-blade carried thither had been bitten into dozens of  fragments, and the structure filled the entire space beyond the first of  the exposed roots, though its interior, till from frequent use it  changed its form, seemed hardly able to accommodate the female vole.    In this tight snuggery, at a time when the corncrake's nocturnal music  was first heard in the meadow by the pool, five midget water-voles,  naked and blind, were born. Brighteye listened intently to the faint,  unmistakable family noises issuing therefrom, and then, like a  thoughtful dry-nurse, went off to find for his mate a tender white root  of horse-tail grass. For several nights he was assiduous in his  attentions to the mother vole; and afterwards, his house-keeping duties  being suspended, he became a vigilant sentinel, maintaining constant  watch over the precious family within his home.    When the baby voles were about a week old, a large brown rat, that on  several occasions in the previous year had annoyed the youthful  Brighteye, returned to the pool. Wandering through the run-ways, the  monster chanced to discover the opening from the bank to Brighteye's  chamber, and, thinking that here was a place admirably suited for a  summer resort, proceeded to investigate. The vole scented him  immediately, and, though the weaker animal, climbed quickly out and with  tooth and nail fell upon the intruder. An instant later, the mother vole  appeared, and with even greater ferocity than that of her mate joined in  the keen affray in order to defend her home and family to the utmost of  her powers. But the rat possessed great strength and cruel teeth, and  his size and weight were such that for several minutes he successfully  maintained his position. With desperate efforts, the voles endeavoured  to pull the rat into the water, where, as they knew, their advantage  would be greater than on land. They succeeded at last in forcing him  over the bank, and in the pool proceeded to punish him to such an  extent--clinging to his neck by their teeth and fore-feet, while they  used their hind-claws with painful effect on his body--that, dazed by  their drastic methods and almost suffocated, he reluctantly gave up the  struggle, and floated, gasping, down the stream.    The mother vole, though she and her spouse had proved victorious, was so  unsettled by the rat's incursion, that, as a cat carries her kittens,  she carried each of her young in turn from their nest to a temporary  refuge in a clump of brambles. Still dissatisfied, she removed them  thence to a shallow depression beside one of the run-ways, where,  throughout the night, she nursed them tenderly. At daybreak she took  them back to the warmth and the comfort of the nest. Shortly afterwards,  when their eyes were opened and they were following the parent voles on  one of their customary night excursions, the mother found herself face  to face with a far more formidable antagonist than the rat.    The baby voles, like the offspring of nearly all land animals that have  gradually become aquatic in their habits, were at first strangely averse  from entering the water, and had to be taken by their parents into the  pool. There the anxious mother, firm yet gentle in her system of  education, watched their every movement, and encouraged them to follow  her about the backwaters and shallows near their home. But if either of  them showed the faintest sign of fatigue, the mother dived quietly and  lifted the tired nursling to the surface.    Late one evening, while the parent voles were busy with their work of  family training, the old cannibal trout suddenly appeared, rose quickly  at one of the youngsters swimming near the edge of the current, but,  through a slight miscalculation, failed to clutch his prize. The mother  vole, ever on the alert, plunged down, and, heedless of danger, darted  towards her enemy. For a second or two she manoeuvred to obtain a grip,  then, as she turned to avoid attack, the jaws of the trout opened wide,  and, like a steel trap, closed firmly on her tail. Maddened with rage  and pain, she raised herself quickly, clutched at the back of her  assailant, and buried her sharp, adze-shaped teeth--that could strip a  piece of willow-bark as neatly as could a highly tempered tool of  steel--in the flesh behind his gills. So sure and speedy was her action,  that she showed no sign of fatigue when she reached the surface of the  water, and the trout, his spinal column severed just behind his gills,  drifted lifelessly away.    Though the young voles, in the tunnelled buttress of the river-bank,  lived under the care of experienced parents ever ready and resolute in  their defence, and became as shy and furtive as the wood-mice dwelling  in the hollows of the hedge beside the pond, they were not always  favoured by fortune. The weakling of the family died of disease; another  of the youngsters, foraging alone in the wood, was killed by a  bloodthirsty weasel; while a third, diving to pick up a root of  water-weed, was caught by the neck in the fork of a submerged branch,  and drowned.    During the autumn and the winter the survivors remained with their  parents; the burrow was enlarged and improved by the addition of new  granaries for winter supplies, new water-entrances to facilitate escape  in times of panic, and a new, commodious sleeping chamber, strewn with  hay and withered reeds, at the end of a long tunnel extending almost  directly beneath the river-path. The supplies in the granaries were,  however, hardly needed: the winter was exceptionally mild, and the voles  were generally able to obtain duckweed and watercress for food. Often,  on my way to the ruined garden, I noticed their footprints--indistinctly  outlined on the gravel, but deep and triangular where the creatures  climbed through soft and yielding soil--along the path leading to the  pond in the pasture near the wood.    When spring came once more, and the scented primroses gleamed faintly in  the gloom beside the upper entrance to the burrow, and the corncrake,  babbling loudly, wandered through the growing grass at the foot of the  meadow-hedge, the household of the voles was broken up. The young ones  found partners, and, in homes not far from the burrow by the  willow-stoles, settled down to the usual life of the vole, a life of  happiness and yet of peril.    For still another year Brighteye's presence was familiar to me. I often  watched him as he sat at the water's edge above the buttress, or on the  stone in mid-stream, or on the half-submerged root of a tree washed into  an angle of the pool above the stakes, and as, after his usual toilet  observances, he swam thence across the reed-bed opposite the \"hover\"  where, in autumn, the breeding salmon lurked.    Then, for many months, I lived far from the well loved village. But one  winter evening, after a long journey, I returned. The snow, falling  rapidly, blotted out the prospect of the silent hills. The village  seemed asleep; the shops were closed for the weekly holiday; not a  footfall could be heard, not even a dog could be seen, down the long  vista of the straggling street. The white walls of the cottages, and the  white snow-drifts banked beside the irregular pavements, were in  complete contrast to the radiant summer scene on which my eyes had  lingered when I left the village. My feeling of cheerlessness was not  dispelled even by the warmth and comfort of the little inn. Oppressed by  the evidences of change, which in my disappointment were, no doubt, much  exaggerated, I left the inn, and, heedless of the piercing cold and the  driving snow, made my way towards the river. As I approached the stakes  below the pool, a golden-eye duck rose from beside the bank, and on  whistling wings flew swiftly into the gloom. I crouched in the shelter  of a holly tree, and waited and watched till the cold became  unendurable; but no other sign of life was visible; the pool was  deserted.    In summer I returned home to stay, and then, as of old, I often wandered  by the river. Evening after evening, till long after the last red glow  had faded from the western hill-tops, I lingered by the pool. The owl  sailed slowly past; the goatsucker hawked for moths about the oaks; the  trout rose to the incautious flies; the corncrake babbled loudly in the  long, lush meadow grass. A family of voles swam in and out of the  shallows opposite my hiding place; but none of the little animals  approached the buttress near the stakes. Frequently I saw their  footprints on the sandy margin, but never the footprints of Brighteye.  Somehow, somewhere, he had met relentless fate.          THE FIELD-VOLE.    I.    HIDDEN PATHWAYS IN THE GRASS.      The sun had set, the evening was calm, and a mist hung over the  countryside when a field-vole appeared at the mouth of his burrow in a  mossy pasture. The little grey creature was one of the most timorous of  the feeble folk dwelling in the pleasant wilderness of the Valley of  Olwen. His life, like that of Brighteye, the water-vole, was beset with  enemies; but Nature"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29420"],[0,"American Rural Highways (#15)"],[1,"time, it is likely to prove a very  satisfactory binder, but, if it becomes plastic and loses its shape,  it will be an inferior binder, as a general rule. The ball clay, as  the former is called, may be of any color common to soils, not  necessarily yellow or reddish as is sometimes supposed. Likewise,  balls of mixtures containing varying percentages of sand and the  binder to be used may be made up and immersed in water. The mixture  that holds its shape longest is of course the best combination of the  materials and indicates the mixture to use in the construction.    An ideal, or even a fairly satisfactory soil for a binder may not  exist in the vicinity of a proposed improvement, and consequently an  inferior binder is frequently the only material available.    Sometimes deposits of clay or gravel contain a considerable percentage  of gypsum which serves as a binder and is particularly effective when  used in combination with clay and sand or gravel.    In many places a soil of the type used for adobe and called \"caliche\"  may be found and this is an excellent binder for sand or gravel.    =Top-Soil or Natural Mixtures.=--Deposits consisting of a natural  mixture of sand and clay in which the ingredients happen to exist in  about the correct relative proportions for sand-clay road surfaces are  found in many localities. These mixtures are commonly referred to as  top-soil. If the deposits are somewhat deficient either in sand or  clay, they can be utilized if the proper corrections in the  proportions are made during construction. Very satisfactory road  surfaces are sometimes constructed with mixtures that appear to be far  from ideal in composition, but experience and frequent trials are  needed to determine the best way in which to handle these mixtures.    =Sand-Clay Surfaces on Sandy Roads.=--Sand-clay surfaces may be  constructed on naturally sandy roads either by adding clay and mixing  it with the sand to secure the desired composition, or a layer of a  natural sand-clay mixture, caliche or sand-clay-gypsum may be placed  on top of the sand.    The most widely used method is to mix clay or other binder with the  sand. Since there is no need to provide for ditches to carry storm  water on a deep sand soil, the sand is graded off nearly flat across  the road and no ditches are provided. The clay is dumped on the road  in a layer about 8 inches thick and is then mixed into the sand. It is  desired to mix enough sand with the clay to produce a mixture composed  of approximately 1/3 clay and 2/3 sand. The mixing is accomplished in  various ways, the most common being to use a heavy plow at first and  to follow this with a heavy disc harrow. The mixing is a tedious and  disagreeable process, but its thorough accomplishment is  indispensable. The mixing is most readily done when the materials are  saturated with water and in practice it is customary to depend upon  rain for the water, although in the final stages water may be hauled  and sprinkled on the road to facilitate final completion of the  mixing. After the mixing has been completed, the surface is smoothed  with the blade grader and is kept smooth until it dries out. Repeated  dragging will be required, during the first year especially, and to  some extent each year in order to keep the surface smooth, but the  dragging can be successfully accomplished only when the road is wet.    [Illustration: Fig. 14.--Cross Sections for Sand-Clay Roads]    In regions where several months of continued hot, dry weather is to be  expected each year, the sand-clay mixture is likely to break through  unless it is of considerable thickness and generally the surface layer  is made much thicker than for regions where the annual rainfall is  fairly well distributed. This is especially necessary when the binder  is of inferior quality. It is not uncommon in such cases to make the  sand-clay surface as much as two feet thick.    As the mixing progresses it may appear that patches here and there are  deficient in either clay or sand and the mixture in these places is  corrected by the addition of a little sand or clay as may be  required.    If the top-soil is used it is deposited on the sand in the required  quantity and is remixed in place to insure uniformity. If either sand  or clay is needed to give a satisfactory mixture, the proper material  is added and mixed in as the work progresses. The surface is finally  smoothed by means of the grader and drag.    =Sand-Clay on Clay or Loam.=--If the existing road is of clay or loam,  ample drainage will be required as discussed in Chapter IV. The  surface may be constructed of a natural sand-clay mixture or of a sand  mixed with the natural soil. If the former, the surface of the  existing road is prepared by grading so as to insure good drainage and  the natural mixture is then deposited and the surface completed as  described in the preceding section.    If the surface is formed by mixing sand with the existing soil, the  sands may be deposited in a layer about six inches thick which will  gradually mix with the soil as the road is used. A second application  of sand may follow in a year or two if it is needed. Such a road  surface will lack uniformity of composition and it seems preferable to  mix the sand with the soil by plowing and discing as previously  described.    =Characteristics.=--Sand-clay road surfaces do not have sufficient  durability for heavily traveled highways, but will be satisfactory for  a moderate amount of traffic. These surfaces have maximum  serviceability when moist, not wet, and consequently are not as  durable in dry climates as in humid areas. They are likely to become  sticky and unstable in continued wet weather and to become friable and  wear into chuck holes in long continued dry weather. At their best,  they are dustless, somewhat resilient and of low tractive resistance.    GRAVEL ROAD SURFACES    [Illustration: Fig. 15.--Cross Sections for Gravel Highways]    =Natural Gravel.=--Gravel is the name given to a material consisting  of a mixture of more or less rounded stones, sand and earthy material,  which is found in natural deposits. These deposits exist in almost  every part of North America, being especially numerous in the  glaciated areas, but by no means confined to them. Gravel deposits  consist of pieces of rock varying in size from those of a cubic yard  or more in volume to the finest stone dust, but with pieces ranging in  size from that which will pass a 3-inch ring down to fine sand  predominating. The larger pieces are usually more or less rounded and  the finer particles may be rounded or may be angular. Many varieties  of rocks are to be found among the gravel pebbles, but the rocks of  igneous origin and possessing a considerable degree of hardness  generally predominate. Intermixed with the pieces of rock there is  likely to be clay or other soil, the quantity varying greatly in  different deposits and even in various places in the same deposits.    Often there are found deposits of material which are by the layman  termed gravel, which are really clayey sand or sand containing a few  pebbles, but which are of value to the road builder for the sand clay  type of surfacing. The term gravel is exceedingly general and unless  specifically defined, gives little indication of the exact nature of  to which it is applied.

Ideal gravel is seldom encountered, but a consideration of  its characteristics serves to establish a measure by which to estimate  the probable value of any deposit.    =The Ideal Road Gravel.=--The ideal road gravel is a mixture of  pebbles, sand and earthy material, the pieces varying from coarse to  fine in such a manner that when the gravel is compacted into a road  surface the spaces between the larger pebbles are filled with the  finer material. The pebbles are of a variety of rock that is highly  resistant to wear so that the road surface made from the gravel will  have the quality of durability. The gravel possesses good cementing  properties, insuring that the pieces will hold together in the road  surface. The cementing property may be due to the rock powder in the  deposit or to earthy material mixed with the rock particles, or to  both. Table 7 shows the results of a number of tests made upon gravels  and indicates that the cementing property of the gravel does not  always depend upon the clay content.    =Permissible Size of Pebbles.=--The larger pebbles in the gravel are  less likely to crush under loads than smaller pebbles of the same sort  of rock, but if the rock is of some of the tougher varieties such as  trap, there is very little likelihood of even the smaller pebbles  crushing. If the pebbles are of rock of medium toughness, the smaller  pebbles might be crushed under the heavier loads. It is the usual  practice to permit gravel"]]]
