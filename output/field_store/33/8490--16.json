Three  times she broke away and came bounding to us, and three times the dogs  took her by the throat and dragged her back.\"    \"You stood to look!\" the Chief snarled.    \"No, master, we ran, but she vanished as we got to her; the great hounds  vanished away, and that being that seemed to be Fionn disappeared with  them. We were left in the rough grass, staring about us and at each  other, and listening to the moan of the wind and the terror of our  hearts.\"    \"Forgive us, dear master,\" the servant cried. But the great captain made  him no answer. He stood as though he were dumb and blind, and now and  again he beat terribly on his breast with his closed fist, as though he  would kill that within him which should be dead and could not die. He  went so, beating on his breast, to his inner room in the Dun, and he was  not seen again for the rest of that day, nor until the sun rose over Moy  Life' in the morning.        CHAPTER V    For many years after that time, when he was not fighting against the  enemies of Ireland, Fionn was searching and hunting through the length  and breadth of the country in the hope that he might again chance on his  lovely lady from the Shi'. Through all that time he slept in misery each  night and he rose each day to grief. Whenever he hunted he brought only  the hounds that he trusted, Bran and Sceo'lan, Lomaire, Brod, and Lomlu;  for if a fawn was chased each of these five great dogs would know if  that was a fawn to be killed or one to be protected, and so there was  small danger to Saeve and a small hope of finding her.    Once, when seven years had passed in fruitless search, Fionn and the  chief nobles of the Fianna were hunting Ben Gulbain. All the hounds of  the Fianna were out, for Fionn had now given up hope of encountering  the Flower of Allen. As the hunt swept along the sides of the hill there  arose a great outcry of hounds from a narrow place high on the slope  and, over all that uproar there came the savage baying of Fionn's own  dogs.    \"What is this for?\" said Fionn, and with his companions he pressed to  the spot whence the noise came.    \"They are fighting all the hounds of the Fianna,\" cried a champion.    And they were. The five wise hounds were in a circle and were giving  battle to an hundred dogs at once. They were bristling and terrible, and  each bite from those great, keen jaws was woe to the beast that received  it. Nor did they fight in silence as was their custom and training, but  between each onslaught the great heads were uplifted, and they pealed  loudly, mournfully, urgently, for their master.    \"They are calling on me,\" he roared.    And with that he ran, as he had only once before run, and the men who  were nigh to him went racing as they would not have run for their lives.  They came to the narrow place on the slope of the mountain, and they saw  the five great hounds in a circle keeping off the other dogs, and in  the middle of the ring a little boy was standing. He had long, beautiful  hair, and he was naked. He was not daunted by the terrible combat and  clamour of the hounds. He did not look at the hounds, but he stared like  a young prince at Fionn and the champions as they rushed towards him  scattering the pack with the butts of their spears. When the fight was  over, Bran and Sceo'lan ran whining to the little boy and licked his  hands.    \"They do that to no one,\" said a bystander. \"What new master is this  they have found?\"    Fionn bent to the boy. \"Tell me, my little prince and pulse, what your  name is, and how you have come into the middle of a hunting-pack, and  why you are naked?\"    But the boy did not understand the language of the men of Ireland. He  put his hand into Fionn's, and the Chief felt as if that little hand had  been put into his heart. He lifted the lad to his great shoulder.    \"We have caught something on this hunt,\" said he to Caelte mac Rongn.  \"We must bring this treasure home. You shall be one of the Fianna-Finn,  my darling,\" he called upwards.    The boy looked down on him, and in the noble trust and fearlessness of  that regard Fionn's heart melted away.    \"My little fawn!\" he said.    And he remembered that other fawn. He set the boy between his knees and  stared at him earnestly and long.    \"There is surely the same look,\" he said to his wakening heart; \"that is  the very eye of Saeve.\"    The grief flooded out of his heart as at a stroke, and joy foamed into  it in one great tide. He marched back singing to the encampment, and men  saw once more the merry Chief they had almost forgotten.        CHAPTER VI    Just as at one time he could not be parted from Saeve, so now he could  not be separated from this boy. He had a thousand names for him, each  one more tender than the last: \"My Fawn, My Pulse, My Secret Little  Treasure,\" or he would call him \"My Music, My Blossoming Branch, My  Store in the Heart, My Soul.\" And the dogs were as wild for the boy as  Fionn was. He could sit in safety among a pack that would have torn any  man to pieces, and the reason was that Bran and Sceo'lan, with their  three whelps, followed him about like shadows. When he was with the pack  these five were with him, and woeful indeed was the eye they turned  on their comrades when these pushed too closely or were not properly  humble. They thrashed the pack severally and collectively until every  hound in Fionn's kennels knew that the little lad was their master, and  that there was nothing in the world so sacred as he was.    In no long time the five wise hounds could have given over their  guardianship, so complete was the recognition of their young lord. But  they did not so give over, for it was not love they gave the lad but  adoration.    Fionn even may have been embarrassed by their too close attendance. If  he had been able to do so he might have spoken harshly to his dogs, but  he could not; it was unthinkable that he should; and the boy might have  spoken harshly to him if he had dared to do it. For this was the order  of Fionn's affection: first there was the boy; next, Bran and Sceo'lan  with their three whelps; then Caelte mac Rona'n, and from him down  through the champions. He loved them all, but it was along that  precedence his affections ran. The thorn that went into Bran's foot ran  into Fionn's also. The world knew it, and there was not a champion but  admitted sorrowfully that there was reason for his love.    Little by little the boy came to understand their speech and to speak it  himself, and at last he was able to tell his story to Fionn.    There were many blanks in the tale, for a young child does not remember  very well. Deeds grow old in a day and are buried in a night. New  memories come crowding on old ones, and one must learn to forget as well  as to remember. A whole new life had come on this boy, a life that was  instant and memorable, so that his present memories blended into and  obscured the past, and he could not be quite sure if that which he told  of had happened in this world or in the world he had left.        CHAPTER VII    \"I used to live,\" he said, \"in a wide, beautiful place. There were hills  and valleys there, and woods and streams, but in whatever direction I  went I came always to a cliff, so tall it seemed to lean against the  sky, and so straight that even a goat would not have imagined to climb  it.\"    \"I do not know of any such place,\" Fionn mused.    \"There is no such place in Ireland,\" said Caelte, \"but in the Shi' there  is such a place.\"    \"There is in truth,\" said Fionn.    \"I used to eat fruits and roots in the summer,\" the boy continued, \"but  in the winter food was left for me in a cave.\"    \"Was there no one with you?\" Fionn asked.    \"No one but a deer that loved me, and that I loved.\"    \"Ah me!\" cried Fionn in anguish, \"tell me your tale, my son.\"    \"A dark stern man came often after us, and he used to speak with the  deer. Sometimes he talked gently and softly and coaxingly, but at times  again he would shout loudly and in a harsh, angry voice. But whatever  way he talked the deer would draw away from him in dread, and he always  left her at last furiously.\"    \"It is the Dark Magician of the Men of God,\" cried Fionn despairingly.    \"It is indeed, my soul,\" said Caelte.    \"The last time I saw the deer,\" the child continued, \"the dark man was  speaking to her. He spoke for a long time. He spoke gently and angrily,  and gently and angrily, so that I thought he would never stop talking,  but in the end he struck her with a hazel rod, so that she was forced  to follow him when he went away. She was looking back at me all the time  and she was crying so bitterly that any one would pity her. I tried to  follow her also, but I could not move, and I cried after her too, with  rage and grief, until I could see her no more and hear her no more. Then  I fell on the grass, my senses went away from me, and when I awoke I was  on the hill in the middle of the hounds where you found me.\"    That was the boy whom the Fianna called Oisi'n, or the Little Fawn. He  grew to be a great fighter afterwards, and he was the chief maker of  poems in the world. But he was not yet finished with the Shi. He was to  go back into Faery when the time came, and to come thence again to tell  these tales, for it was by him these tales were told.          THE WOOING OF BECFOLA        CHAPTER I    We do not know where Becfola came from. Nor do we know for certain where  she went to. We do not even know her real name, for the name Becfola,  \"Dowerless\" or \"Small-dowered,\" was given to her as a nickname. This  only is certain, that she disappeared from the world we know of, and  that she went to a realm where even conjecture may not follow her.    It happened in the days when Dermod, son of the famous Ae of Slane, was  monarch of all Ireland. He was unmarried, but he had many foster-sons,  princes from the Four Provinces, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28957"],[0,"The Acts of the General Assemblies of the Church of Scotland (#15)"],[1,"persons out of their families, and such like      other points of godly conversation, and good example, & that they      at the visitation of their Kirks, try the Ministers families in      these points foresaid, and such as are found negligent in these      points, foresaid after due admonition, shall be adjudged unmeet to      govern the house of God, according to the rule of the Apostle._        \"_That Ministers in all companies strive to bee spirituall and      profitable, and to talke of things pertaining to godlinesse, as      namely of such as may strengthen us in Christ, instruct us in our      calling, of the means how to have Christs Kingdome better      established in our Congregations, and to know how the Gospel      flourisheth in our flocks, and such like others the hinderances,      and the remeeds that we finde, &c. wherein there is manifold      corruptions, both in our companying with our selves, and with      others: and that the contraveeners thereof be tryed, and sharply      be rebuked._        \"_That no Minister be found to contenance, procure, or assist a      publick offender challenged by his own Ministers, for his publick      offence, or to bear with him, as though his Minister, were too      severe upon him, under pain of admonition and rebuking._\"      Anent generall Assemblies.          \"_To urge the keeping of the Acts anent the keeping of the      Assembly, that it may have the own reverence and majestie--_\"        _The Assembly having heard the whole act read, most unanimously      alloweth and approveth this article._      X.
