They range along the eastern side of Africa, to an unknown  distance in the interior.    Sparrman says that the period of gestation is twelve months.    [Illustration: Head of Cape Buffalo.]          THE PEGASSE.    _Bos Pegasus._      [Illustration]    The above figure is copied from an engraving in the fourth volume of  Griffiths' 'Cuvier,' of which the following account is given: \"In the  collection of drawings, formerly the property of Prince John Maurice of  Nassau, now in the Berlin library, there is the figure of a ruminant  with the name Pacasse written under it. Judging from the general  appearance of the painting, it represents a young animal, although the  horns are already about as long as the head. They are of a darkish  colour, with something like ridges passing transversely, commencing at  the sides of the frontal ridge, turned down and outwards, with the  points slightly upwards; the head is short, thick, abrupt at the nose;  the forehead wide; the eyes large and full, dark, with a crimson  canthus; the neck maned with a dense and rough mane; the tail descending  below the hough, entirely covered with dark, long hair, appearing  woolly; the carcass short, and the legs high and clumsy; but the most  remarkable character appears to consist in pendulous ears, nearly as  long as the head. The mane and tail are dark; the head, neck, body, and  limbs dark brown, excepting the pastern joints, which are white; this  figure cannot be referred to a known species, and is sufficiently  curious to merit an engraving.\"    Swainson says that this animal only occurs in the interior of Western  Africa; but he does not mention on what authority.    As the exploration of the interior of Africa is becoming an object of  increasing importance and interest, we may expect, before long, to be  furnished with some authentic details of the Pegasse, if such an animal  really exist.    [Illustration: Occipital View of Horns of _Bos Caffer_, from a Specimen  in the Zoological Society's Museum.]          THE GAUR, OR GOUR.    _Bos Gaurus._      [Illustration]    The above representation of this animal was sketched from a stuffed  specimen in the British Museum, the dimensions of which are given on p.  102.    The following interesting particulars are taken from Mr. T. S. Traill's  paper on the Gour, in the 'Edinburgh Philosophical Journal,' October,  1824.    \"The Gaur is considered by the Indians as of a species totally distinct  from either the Arna or the common Buffalo. The only animal with which  it appears to have affinity is the Gayal, or Bos Gavaeus, described by  Mr. Colebrook, in the 'Asiatic Researches,' vol. viii. That animal is  said to exist, both wild and domestic, in the hilly countries of Upper  India, and to have a high dorsal ridge, somewhat similar to what we  shall immediately find in the Gaur; but the very different form of its  head, _the presence of a distinct dewlap_, and the general habit of the  Gayal, appear sufficient to distinguish it from the Gaur.    The Gaur occurs in several mountainous parts of central India, but is  chiefly found in Myn Pat, or Mine Paut, (Pat or Paut, in Hindostanee,  signifies table-land,) a high, insulated mountain, with a tabular  summit, in the province of Sergojah, in South Bahar.    This table-land is about 36 miles in length, by 24 or 25 in medial  breadth, and rises above the neighbouring plains probably 2000 feet. The  sides of the mountain slope with considerable steepness, and are  furrowed by streams that water narrow valleys, the verdant banks of  which are the favorite haunts of Gaurs. On being disturbed, they retreat  into the thick jungles (of saul-trees), which cover the sides of the  whole range. The south-east side of the mountain presents an extensive  mural precipice from 20 to 40 feet high. The rugged slopes at its foot  are covered by impenetrable green jungle, and abound with dens formed of  fallen blocks of rock, the suitable retreats of Tigers, Bears, and  Hyaenas. The western slopes are less rugged, but the soil is parched, and  the forests seem withered by excess of heat. The summit of the mountain  presents a mixture of open lawns and woods. There were once twenty-five  villages on Myn Pat, but they have long been deserted, on account of the  number and ferocity of the beasts of prey. On this mountain, however,  the Gaur maintains his seat. The Indians assert that even the Tiger has  no chance in combat with the full-grown Gaur, though he may  occasionally succeed in carrying off an unprotected calf. The wild  Buffalo abounds in the plains below the mountains; but he so much dreads  the Gaur, according to the natives, that he rarely attempts to invade  his haunts. The forests which shield the Gaur abound, however, in  Hog-deer, Saumurs, and Porcupines.    The size of the Gaur is its most striking peculiarity. The following  measurement of one not fully grown will show the enormous bulk of the  animal:--                                            Ft.  In.  Height from the hoof to the withers      5   11-3/4  Length from nose to end of tail         11   11-3/4    The form of the Gaur is not so lengthened as that of the Arna. Its back  is strongly arched, so as to form a pretty uniform curve from the nose  to the origin of the tail, when the animal stands still. This appearance  is partly owing to the curved form of the nose and forehead, and still  more to a remarkable ridge, of no great thickness, which rises six or  seven inches above the general line of the back, from the last of the  cervical to beyond the middle of the dorsal vertebrae, from which it  gradually is lost in the outline of the back. This peculiarity proceeds  from an unusual elongation of the spinous processes of the dorsal  column. It is very conspicuous in the Gaurs of all ages, although loaded  with fat; and has no resemblance to the hunch which is found on some of  the domestic cattle of India. It bears some resemblance, certainly, to  the ridge _described_ as existing in the Gayal; but the Gaur is said to  be distinguished from that animal by the remarkable peculiarity of a  _total want of a dewlap._ Neither the male nor female Gaur, at any age,  has the slightest trace of this appendage, which is found on every  other known animal of this genus.    The colour of the Gaur is a very deep brownish black, almost approaching  to blueish black, except a tuft of curling dirty white hair between the  horns, and rings of the same colour just above the hoof. The hair over  the skin is extremely short and sleek, and has somewhat of the _oily_  appearance of a fresh seal-skin.    The character of the head differs little from that of the domestic Bull,  excepting that the outline of the face is more curved--the os-frontis  more solid and projecting. The horns are short, thick at the base,  considerably curved towards the tip, slightly compressed on one side,  and in the natural state are rough. They are, however, capable of a good  polish, when they are of a horn gray colour, with black solid tips. A  pair in my possession measure one foot eleven inches along their convex  sides; one foot from the centre of the base to the tip, in a straight  line; and one foot in their widest circumference; but as they are cut  and polished, a portion of their length and thickness has been lost.  They are of a very dense substance, as their weight indicates, for even  in their dressed state the pair weigh 5 lbs. 11 oz. avoirdupois.    [Illustration]    The limbs of the Gaur have more of the form of the deer than any other  of the bovine genus. This is particularly observable in the acuteness of  the angle formed by the tibia and tarsus, and in the slenderness of the  lower part of the legs. They give the idea, however, of great strength  combined with fleetness; and the animal is observed to _canter_ with  great velocity. The form of the hoof, too, is longer, neater, and  stronger than in the ox, and the whole foot appears to have greater  flexibility.    When wounded the Gaur utters a short bellow, which may be best imitated  by the syllable--ugh-ugh.    It is said that the Gaur will not live in a state of captivity; even  when taken very young, the calf soon droops and dies. The bull-calf of  the first year is called, by the natives, Purorah; the female, Pareeah;  and when full-grown the cow is called Gourin.    Gaurs associate in herds consisting usually of from ten to twenty  animals. So numerous are they on Myn Pat, that, in one day hunting, the  party computed that not less than eighty had passed through the station  occupied by the sportsmen.    The Gaurs browse on the leaves and tender shoots of trees and shrubs,  and also graze on the banks of the streams. During the cold season they  remain concealed in the _saul_ forests, but in hot weather come out to  feed in the green vallies and lawns, which occur on the mountain of Myn  Pat. They show no disposition to wallow in mire or swamps, like the  Buffalo; a habit, indeed, which the sleekness of their skins renders not  at all probable.    The period of gestation is said to be twelve months, and they bring  forth usually in August.\"    To the preceding observations of Dr. Traill, I have to add the  important fact (which of itself will be sufficient to constitute a  specific difference between the Gaur and the Gayal), namely, that in the  skeleton of the Gaur there are only thirteen pairs of ribs, whilst the  skeleton of the Gayal possesses fourteen pairs. This fact I have  ascertained from an examination of both the skeletons; that of the Gaur  in the museum of the Zoological Society, and that of the Gayal, in the  possession of Mr. Bartlett, Russell Street, Covent Garden. (See p. 68.)    The skeleton of the Gaur just referred to, strikingly confirms Dr.  Traill's account of the elevated dorsal ridge of this animal; several of  the dorsal vertebrae measuring, with their spinous processes, upwards of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27977"],[0,"Austral English (#15)"],[1,"ll-Frog</i>.    <hw>Bell-topper</hw>, <i>n</i>.

To biddy, is to rid one of burrs, as `I'll just  biddy my clothes before I come in.'  Small birds are  occasionally found in a wretched state of discomfort in which  they appear a moving mass of burrs.  Parroquets, pipets, and  the little white-eyes, have been found victims suffering from  these tenacious burrs of the piri-piri, just moving little  brown balls unable to fly till picked up and released from  their bonds.\"    1896.  `Otago Witness,' Jan. 23, vol. ii. p. 36:    \"Yes, biddybids detract very materially from the value of the  wool, and the plant should not be allowed to seed where sheep  are depastured.

The name is used locally  for various fishes; in Australia it is <i>Eleotris  nudiceps</i>, Castln., family <i>Gobiidae</i>, a river fish.  Of the genus <i>Eleotris</i>, Guenther says that as regards  form they repeat almost all the modifications observed among  the Gobies, from which they differ only in having the ventral  fins non-coalescent.  See <i>Bull-head</i> (2).    <hw>Billabong</hw>, <i>n</i>. an effluent from a river,  returning to it, or often ending in the sand, in some cases  running only in flood time.    In the Wiradhuri dialect of the centre of New South Wales, East  coast, <i>billa</i> means a river and <i>bung</i> dead.  See  <i>Bung.  Billa</i> is also a river in some Queensland  dialects, and thus forms part of the name of the river  Belyando.  In the Moreton Bay dialect it occurs in the form  <i>pill</i> , and in the sense of `tidal creek.'  In the  `Western Australian Almanack' for 1842, quoted in J. Fraser's  `Australian Language,' 1892, Appendix, p. 50, <i>Bilo</i> is  given for <i>River</i>.    <i> Billabong</i> is often regarded as a synonym for  <i>Anabranch</i> (q.v.); but there is a distinction.  From the  original idea, the <i>Anabranch</i> implies rejoining the  river; whilst the <i>Billabong</i> implies continued separation  from it; though what are called <i>Billabongs</i> often do  rejoin.    1862.  W. Landsborough, `Exploration of Australia,' p. 30:    \"A dried-up tributary of the Gregory, which I named the  Macadam.\"    [Footnote]: \"In the south, such a creek as the Macadam is  termed a <i>billy-bonn</i> [sic], from the circumstance of the  water carrier returning from it with his pitcher (<i>billy</i>)  empty (<i>bong</i>, literally dead).\"    1865.

Howitt, `Discovery in Australia, vol. i. p. 298:    \"What the Major calls, after the learned nomenclature of  Colonel Jackson, in the `Journal of the Geographical Society,'  anabranches, but which the natives call billibongs, channels  coming out of a stream and returning into it again.\"    1880.

E. W. Hornung, `A Bride from the Bush,' p. 267:    \"If ever she went back to Australia, she'd remember my young  man, and get him a good billet.\"    <hw>Billy</hw>, <i>n</i>. a tin pot used as a bushman's kettle.  The word comes from the proper name, used as abbreviation for  William.  Compare the common uses of `Jack,' `Long Tom,'  `Spinning Jenny.'  It came into use about 1850.  It is not used  in the following.    1830.  R. Dawson, `Present State of Australia,' p. 48:    \"He then strikes a light and makes a fire to boil his kettle  and fry his bacon.\"    About 1850, the billy superseded the <i>quart-pot</i> (q.v.),  chiefly because of its top-handle and its lid.  Another  suggested derivation is that billy is shortened from  <i>billycan</i>, which is said to be bully-can (sc.  Fr. <i>bouili</i>).  In the early days \"<i>boeuf bouilli</i>\"  was a common label on tins of preserved meat in ship's stores.  These tins, called \"bully-tins,\" were used by diggers and  others as the modern billy is (see quotation 1835).  A third  explanation gives as the origin the aboriginal word  <i>billa</i> (river or water).    1835.  T. B. Wilson, `Voyage Round the World,' p. 238:    \"An empty preserved meat-canister serving the double purpose of  tea-kettle and tea-pot.\"    [The word <i>billy</i> is not used, but its origin is  described.]    1857.
