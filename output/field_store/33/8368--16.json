Who was the most to blame  amongst these four? the lover[73] the lover's friend, the girl, or the  father?\"    \"For my part I think Padmavati was the worst, she being at the bottom of  all their troubles,\" cried Dharma Dhwaj. The king said something about  young people and the two senses of seeing and hearing, but his son's  sentiment was so sympathetic that he at once pardoned the interruption.  At length, determined to do justice despite himself, Vikram said, \"Raja  Dantawat is the person most at fault.\"    \"In what way was he at fault?\" asked the Baital curiously.    King Vikram gave him this reply: \"The Prince Vajramukut being tempted of  the love-god was insane, and therefore not responsible for his actions.  The minister's son performed his master's business obediently, without  considering causes or asking questions--a very excellent quality in a  dependent who is merely required to do as he is bid. With respect to the  young woman, I have only to say that she was a young woman, and thereby  of necessity a possible murderess. But the Raja, a prince, a man of a  certain age and experience, a father of eight! He ought never to have  been deceived by so shallow a trick, nor should he, without reflection,  have banished his daughter from the country.\"    \"Gramercy to you!\" cried the Vampire, bursting into a discordant shout  of laughter, \"I now return to my tree. By my tail! I never yet heard a  Raja so readily condemn a Raja.\" With these words he slipped out of the  cloth, leaving it to hang empty over the great king's shoulder.    Vikram stood for a moment, fixed to the spot with blank dismay.  Presently, recovering himself, he retraced his steps, followed by his  son, ascended the sires-tree, tore down the Baital, packed him up as  before, and again set out upon his way.    Soon afterwards a voice sounded behind the warrior king's back, and  began to tell another true story.          THE VAMPIRE'S SECOND STORY -- Of the Relative Villany of Men and Women.    In the great city of Bhogavati dwelt, once upon a time, a young prince,  concerning whom I may say that he strikingly resembled this amiable son  of your majesty.    Raja Vikram was silent, nor did he acknowledge the Baital's indirect  compliment. He hated flattery, but he liked, when flattered, to be  flattered in his own person; a feature in their royal patron's character  which the Nine Gems of Science had turned to their own account.    Now the young prince Raja Ram (continued the tale teller) had an old  father, concerning whom I may say that he was exceedingly unlike your  Rajaship, both as a man and as a parent. He was fond of hunting, dicing,  sleeping by day, drinking at night, and eating perpetual tonics, while  he delighted in the idleness of watching nautch girls, and the vanity of  falling in love. But he was adored by his children because he took the  trouble to win their hearts. He did not lay it down as a law of heaven  that his offspring would assuredly go to Patala if they neglected the  duty of bestowing upon him without cause all their affections, as your  moral, virtuous, and highly respectable fathers are only too apt----.  Aie! Aie!    These sounds issued from the Vampire's lips as the warrior king,  speechless with wrath, passed his hand behind his back, and viciously  twisted up a piece of the speaker's skin. This caused the Vampire to  cry aloud, more however, it would appear, in derision than in real  suffering, for he presently proceeded with the same subject.    Fathers, great king, may be divided into three kinds; and be it said  aside, that mothers are the same. Firstly, we have the parent of many  ideas, amusing, pleasant, of course poor, and the idol of his children.  Secondly, there is the parent with one idea and a half. This sort of man  would, in your place, say to himself, \"That demon fellow speaks a manner  of truth. I am not above learning from him, despite his position in  life. I will carry out his theory, just to see how far it goes\"; and so  saying, he wends his way home, and treats his young ones with prodigious  kindness for a time, but it is not lasting. Thirdly, there is the real  one-idea'd type of parent-yourself, O warrior king Vikram, an admirable  example. You learn in youth what you are taught: for instance, the  blessed precept that the green stick is of the trees of Paradise; and  in age you practice what you have learned. You cannot teach yourselves  anything before your beards sprout, and when they grow stiff you cannot  be taught by others. If any one attempt to change your opinions you cry,              What is new is not true,            What is true is not new.    and you rudely pull his hand from the subject. Yet have you your uses  like other things of earth. In life you are good working camels for the  mill-track, and when you die your ashes are not worse compost than those  of the wise.    Your Rajaship will observe (continued the Vampire, as Vikram began  to show symptoms of ungovernable anger) that I have been concise in  treating this digression. Had I not been so, it would have led me far  indeed from my tale. Now to return.    When the old king became air mixed with air, the young king, though he  found hardly ten pieces of silver in the paternal treasury and legacies  for thousands of golden ounces, yet mourned his loss with the deepest  grief. He easily explained to himself the reckless emptiness of the  royal coffers as a proof of his dear kind parent's goodness, because he  loved him.    But the old man had left behind him, as he could not carry it off with  him, a treasure more valuable than gold and silver: one Churaman, a  parrot, who knew the world, and who besides discoursed in the most  correct Sanscrit. By sage counsel and wise guidance this admirable bird  soon repaired his young master's shattered fortunes.    One day the prince said, \"Parrot, thou knowest everything: tell me  where there is a mate fit for me. The shastras inform us, respecting  the choice of a wife, 'She who is not descended from his paternal or  maternal ancestors within the sixth degree is eligible by a high  caste man for nuptials. In taking a wife let him studiously avoid the  following families, be they ever so great, or ever so rich in kine,  goats, sheep, gold, or grain: the family which has omitted prescribed  acts of devotion; that which has produced no male children; that in  which the Veda (scripture) has not been read; that which has thick hair  on the body; and that in which members have been subject to hereditary  disease. Let a person choose for his wife a girl whose person has no  defect; who has an agreeable name; who walks gracefully, like a young  elephant; whose hair and teeth are moderate in quantity and in size; and  whose body is of exquisite softness.'\"    \"Great king,\" responded the parrot Churaman, \"there is in the country  of Magadh a Raja, Magadheshwar by name, and he has a daughter called  Chandravati. You will marry her; she is very learned, and, what is  better far, very fait. She is of yellow colour, with a nose like the  flower of the sesamum; her legs are taper, like the plantain-tree; her  eyes are large, like the principal leaf of the lotus; her eye-brows  stretch towards her ears; her lips are red, like the young leaves of the  mango-tree; her face is like the full moon; her voice is like the sound  of the cuckoo; her arms reach to her knees; her throat is like the  pigeon's; her flanks are thin, like those of the lion; her hair hangs  in curls only down to her waist; her teeth are like the seeds of the  pomegranate; and her gait is that of the drunken elephant or the goose.\"    On hearing the parrot's speech, the king sent for an astrologer, and  asked him, \"Whom shall I marry?\" The wise man, having consulted his art,  replied, \"Chandravati is the name of the maiden, and your marriage with  her will certainly take place.\" Thereupon the young Raja, though he had  never seen his future queen, became incontinently enamoured of her. He  summoned a Brahman, and sent him to King Magadheshwar, saying, \"If you  arrange satisfactorily this affair of our marriage we will reward you  amply\"-a promise which lent wings to the priest.    Now it so happened that this talented and beautiful princess had  a jay,[74] whose name was Madan-manjari or Love-garland. She also  possessed encyclopaedic knowledge after her degree, and, like the  parrot, she spoke excellent Sanscrit.    Be it briefly said, O warrior king-for you think that I am talking  fables--that in the days of old, men had the art of making birds  discourse in human language. The invention is attributed to a great  philosopher, who split their tongues, and after many generations  produced a selected race born with those members split. He altered the  shapes of their skulls by fixing ligatures behind the occiput, which  caused the sinciput to protrude, their eyes to become prominent, and  their brains to master the art of expressing thoughts in words.    But this wonderful discovery, like those of great philosophers  generally, had in it a terrible practical flaw The birds beginning to  speak, spoke wisely and so well, they told the truth so persistently,  they rebuked their brethren of the featherless skins so openly, they  flattered them so little and they counselled them so much, that mankind  presently grew tired of hearing them discourse. Thus the art gradually  fell into desuetude, and now it is numbered with the things that were.    One day the charming Princess Chandravati was sitting in confidential  conversation with her jay. The dialogue was not remarkable, for maidens  in all ages seldom consult their confidantes or speculate upon the  secrets of futurity, or ask to have dreams interpreted, except upon one  subject. At last the princess said, for perhaps the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24001"],[0,"The Physical Life of Woman: Advice to the Maiden, Wife and Mother (#15)"],[1,"woman is the symbol of health and a  well-controlled mind. Burke, in his _Essay on the Beautiful_, calls it  the most beauteous object in nature. It is a common observation, that a  sensual character is shown by the thick and coarse development of this  portion of the body.    The hair, also, has a significance. Fine whitish hair, like that of a  child, goes with a simple, child-like disposition; black hair denotes a  certain hardness of character; red hair has long been supposed to be  associated with a sensual constitution, but it rather indicates a  physical weakness,--a tendency to scrofula. This is, however, a tendency  merely. Thin hair is often the result of protracted mental labor, though  many other causes produce it.    Every great man, says Herder, has a glance which no one can imitate. We  may go farther, and say that every man of decided character reveals it  in his eyes. They are the most difficult organs for the hypocrite to  control. Beware of the man who cannot look you in the eyes, and of him  in whose eyes there lurks an expression which allures yet makes you  shudder. The one has something he dares not tell you, the other  something you dare not listen to.    Symmetry, strength, grace, health,--these are admirable qualities in a  man. From the remotest ages they have been the marks of heroes.  Secondary though they are to moral and mental qualities, they should be  ever highly valued. A _manly_ man! Nature designs such to be the sires  of future generations. No danger that we shall fall to worshiping  physical beauty again. The only fear is that in this lank, puny, scrawny  generation of ours, we shall, out of vanity, underrate such beauty. Let  it be ever remembered that this is the ideal, from which any departure  is deterioration.      THE ENGAGEMENT.    When our grandmothers were engaged, the minister rose in his pulpit on  Sunday morning, before the assembled congregation, and proclaimed the  'banns,' stating that if any one knew just cause or lawful impediment  why the lovers should not be married, he should state it there and then.  Sometimes a great hubbub was created when some discarded suitor rose,  forbidding the banns, and claimed that the capricious maiden had  previously promised herself to him. Perhaps it was to avoid such an  uncomfortable check on the freedom of flirtation that the ancient custom  was dropped.    Certain it is, that to be 'engaged' sits very lightly on the minds of  both young men and maidens now-a-days. We know some of either sex who  make it a boast how often they have made and unmade this slender tie. It  is a dangerous pastime. 'The hand of little use hath the daintier  touch,' and they who thus trifle with their affections will end by  losing the capacity to feel any real affection at all.    Undoubtedly there occur instances where a woman has pledged herself in  all seriousness, and afterwards sees her affianced in a light which  warns her that she cannot be happy with him,--that the vows she will be  called upon to pronounce at the altar will be hollow and false. What is  she to do?    We are not inditing the decrees of the Court of Love. Here is the advice  of another to her hand:            'First to thine own self be true,      And then it follows, as the night the day,      That thou canst ne'er be false to any man.'      CONCERNING LONG ENGAGEMENTS.    They are hurtful, and they are unnecessary. Is love so vagrant that it  must be tied by such a chain? Better let it go. True love asks no oath;  it casteth out fear, and believes without a promise.    There are other reasons, sound physiological reasons, which we could  adduce, if need were, to show that the close personal relations which  arise between persons who are engaged should not be continued too long a  time. They lead to excitement and debility, sometimes to danger and  disease. Especially is this true of nervous, excitable, sympathetic  dispositions.    If we are asked to be definite, and give figures, we should say that a  period not longer than a year, nor shorter than three months, should  intervene between the engagement and the marriage.      THE RIGHT TIME OF YEAR TO MARRY.    Woman, when she marries, enters upon a new life, and a trying one. Every  advantage should be in her favour. The season is one of those  advantages. Extreme heat and extreme cold both wear severely on the  human frame. Mid-winter and mid-summer are, therefore, alike  objectionable, especially the latter.    Spring and fall are usually chosen, as statistics show, and the  preference is just. On the whole, the spring is rather to be recommended  than the autumn. In case of a birth within the year, the child will have  attained sufficient age to weather its period of teething more easily  ere the next summer.      THE RIGHT TIME IN THE MONTH TO MARRY.    We mean the woman's own month, that which spans the time between her  periodical sicknesses, be it two or five weeks. Let her choose a day  about equidistant from two periods. The reasons for this we shall  specify hereafter.      THE WEDDING TOUR.    Custom prescribes a journey immediately after marriage, of a week or a  month or two. It is an unwise provision. The event itself is disturbance  enough for the system; and to be hurried hither and thither, stowed in  narrow berths and inconvenient carriages, troubled with baggage, and  annoyed by the importunities of cabmen, waiters, and hangers-on of every  description, is enough, in ordinary times, to test the temper of a  saint.    The foundation of many an unhappy future is laid on the wedding tour.  Not only is the young wife tried beyond all her experience, and her  nervous system harassed, but the husband, too, partakes of her weakness.  Many men, who really love the women they marry, are subject to a slight  revulsion of feeling for a few days after marriage. 'When the veil  falls, and the girdle is loosened,' says the German poet Schiller, 'the  fair illusion vanishes.' A half regret crosses their minds for the jolly  bachelorhood they have renounced. The mysterious charms which gave their  loved one the air of something more than human, disappear in the prosaic  sunlight of familiarity.    Let neither be alarmed, nor lose their self-control. Each requires  indulgence, and management, from the other; both should demand from  themselves patience and self-command. A few weeks, and this danger is  over; but a mistake now is the mistake of a lifetime. More than one  woman has confessed to us that her unhappiness commenced from her  wedding tour; and when we inquired more minutely, we have found that it  arose from an ignorance and disregard of just such little precautions as  we have been referring to.    Yet it is every way advisable that the young pair should escape the  prying eyes of friends and relatives at such a moment. Let them choose  some quiet resort, not too long a journey from home, where they can  pass a few weeks in acquiring that more intimate knowledge of each  other's character as essential to their future happiness.          THE WIFE.      _THE WEDDING NIGHT._    We now enter upon the consideration of the second great period in the  life of Woman. The maiden becomes a Wife. She is born into a new world.  She assumes new relationships,--the sweetest, and, at the same time, the  most natural of which she is capable.    The great object of the conjugal union is the transmission of life,--a  duty necessary in order to repair the constant ravages of death, and  thus perpetuate the race. In the fulfilment of this sublime obligation,  woman plays the more prominent part, as she is the source and depositary  of the future being. It is of moment, therefore, that she should not be  altogether ignorant of the nature and responsibilities of her position.  Ignorance here means suffering, disease, and sometimes death. Let us  then interrogate science in regard to these matters, among the most  interesting of all human concerns.    The initiation into marriage, like its full fruition, maternity, is  attended with more or less suffering. Much, however, may be done to  avert and to lessen the pain which waits upon the first step in this new  life. For this purpose, regard must be had to the selection of the day.  We have said that a time about midway between the monthly recurring  periods is best fitted for the consummation of marriage. As this is a  season of sterility, it recommends itself on this account, in the  interest of both the mother and offspring. The first nuptial relations  should be fruitless, in order that the indispositions possibly arising  from them shall have time to subside before the appearance of the  disturbances incident to pregnancy. One profound change should not too  quickly succeed the other. About the tenth day after menstruation should  therefore be chosen for the marriage ceremony.    It sometimes happens that marriage is consummated with difficulty. To  overcome this, care, management, and forbearance should always be  employed, and anything like precipitation and violence avoided. Only the  consequences of unrestrained impetuosity are to be feared. In those rare  cases in which greater resistance is experienced than can be overcome by  gentle means, the existence of a condition contrary to nature may be  suspected. Violence can then only be productive of injury, and is not  without danger. Medical art should be appealed to, as it alone can  afford assistance in such an emergency.    Although the first conjugal approaches are ordinarily accompanied by  slight flooding, a loss of blood does not always occur. Its absence  proves nothing. The appearance of blood was formerly regarded as a test  of virginity. The Israelites, Arabs, and others carefully preserved and  triumphantly exhibited the evidence of it as an infallible sign of the  virtue of the bride. They were in error. Its presence is as destitute of  signification as its absence; for it is now well known"]]]
