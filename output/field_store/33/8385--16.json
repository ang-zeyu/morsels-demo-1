The firs, Picea  morinda, with its grey tassels, and Abies Pindrow with its dark green  yew-like foliage, succeed the blue pine. Picea may be said to range from  8000 to 10,000 feet, and the upper limit of Abies is from 1000 to 2000  feet higher. These splendid trees are unfortunately of small commercial  value. The yew, Taxus baccata, is found associated with them. Between  5000 and 8000 feet, besides the oaks and other broad-leaved trees  already noticed, two relations of the dogwood, Cornus capitata and  Cornus macrophylla, a large poplar, Populus ciliata, a pear, Pyrus  lanata, a holly, Ilex dipyrena, an elm and its near relation, Celtis  australis, and species of Rhus and Euonymus, may be mentioned. Cornus  capitata is a small tree, but it attracts notice because the heads of  flowers surrounded by bracts of a pale yellow colour have a curious  likeness to a rose, and the fruit is in semblance not unlike a  strawberry. Above 8000 feet several species of maple abound. The  _chinar_ or Platanus orientalis, found as far west as Sicily, grows to  splendid proportions by the quiet waterways of the Vale of Kashmir. The  undergrowth in temperate Himalayan forests consists largely of  barberries, Desmodiums, Indigoferas, roses, brambles, Spiraeas,  Viburnums, honeysuckles with their near relation, Leycesteria formosa,  which has been introduced into English shrubberies. The great vine,  Vitis Himalayana, whose leaves turn red in autumn, climbs up many of the  trees. Of the flowers it is impossible to give any adequate account. The  flora is distinctly Mediterranean in type; the orders in Collett's  _Flora Simlensis_ which are not represented in the Italian flora contain  hardly more than 5 per cent. of the total genera. The plants included in  some of these non-Mediterranean orders are very beautiful, for example,  the Begonias, the Amphicomes (Bignoniaceae), Chirita bifolia and  Platystemma violoides (Gesneraceae), and Hedychium (Scitamineae). More  important members of the flora are species of Clematis, including the  beautiful white Clematis montana, anemones, larkspurs, columbine,  monkshoods, St John's worts, geraniums, balsams, species of Astragalus,  Potentillas, Asters, ragworts, species of Cynoglossum, gentians and  Swertias, Androsaces and primroses, Wulfenia and louseworts, species of  Strobilanthes, Salvias and Nepetas, orchids, irises, Ophiopogon, Smilax,  Alliums, lilies, and Solomon's seal. Snake plants (Arisaema) and their  relation Sauromatum guttatum of the order Araceae are very common in the  woods. The striped spathe in some species of Arisaema bears a curious  resemblance to the head of a cobra uplifted to strike. Orchids decrease  as one proceeds westwards, but irises are much more common in Kashmir  than in the Simla hills. The Kashmir fritillaries include the beautiful  Crown Imperial.    [Illustration: Fig. 21. Firs in Himalaya.]    [Illustration: Fig. 22. Chinars.]    [Illustration: Fig. 23. Rhododendron campanulatum.]    ~Alpine Himalaya.~--In the Alpine Himalaya the scanty tree-growth is  represented by willows, junipers, and birches. After 12,000 or 12,500  feet it practically disappears. A dwarf shrub, Juniperus recurva, is  found clothing hillsides a good way above the two trees of the same  genus. Other alpine shrubs which may be noticed are two rhododendrons,  which grow on cliffs at an elevation of 10,000 to 14,000 feet, R.  campanulatum and R. lepidotum, Gaultheria nummularioides with its  black-purple berry, and Cassiope fastigiata, all belonging to the order  Ericaceae. The herbs include beautiful primulas, saxifrages, and  gentians, and in the bellflower order species of Codonopsis and  Cyananthus. Among Composites may be mentioned the tansies, Saussureas,  and the fine Erigeron multiradiatus common in the forest above Narkanda.  In the bleak uplands beyond the Himalaya tree-growth is very scanty, but  in favoured localities willows and the pencil cedar, Juniperus  pseudosabina, are found. The people depend for fuel largely on a hoary  bush of the Chenopod order, Eurotia ceratoides. In places a profusion of  the red Tibetan roses, Rosa Webbiana, lightens up the otherwise dreary  scene.          CHAPTER VII    FORESTS      ~Rights of State in Waste.~--Under Indian rule the State claimed full  power of disposing of the waste, and, even where an exclusive right in  the soil was not maintained, some valuable trees, e.g. the _deodar_ in  the Himalaya, were treated as the property of the Raja. Under the tenure  prevailing in the hills the soil is the Raja's, but the people have a  permanent tenant right in any land brought under cultivation with his  permission. In Kulu the British Government asserted its ownership of the  waste. In the south-western Panjab, where the scattered hamlets had no  real boundaries, ample waste was allotted to each estate, and the  remainder was claimed as State property.    ~Kinds of Forest.~--The lands in the Panjab over which authority, varying  through many degrees from full ownership unburdened with rights of user  down to a power of control exercised in the interests of the surrounding  village communities, may be roughly divided into      (_a_) Mountain forests;      (_b_) Hill forests;      (_c_) Scrub and grass _Jangal_ in the Plains.    The first are forests of _deodar_, blue pine, fir, and oak in the  Himalaya above the level of 5000 feet. The hill forests occupy the  lower spurs, the Siwaliks in Hoshyarpur, etc., and the low dry hills of  the north-west. A strong growth of _chir_ pine (Pinus longifolia) is  often found in the Himalaya between 3000 and 5000 feet. Below 3000 feet  is scrub forest, the only really valuable product being bamboo. The  hills in the north-western districts of the Panjab and N.W.F. Province,  when nature is allowed to have its way, are covered with low scrub  including in some parts a dwarf palm (Nannorhops Ritchieana), useful for  mat making, and with a taller, but scantier growth of _phulahi_ (Acacia  modesta) and wild olive. What remains of the scrub and grass _jangal_ of  the plains is to be found chiefly in the Bar tracts between the Sutlej  and the Jhelam. Much of it has disappeared, or is about to disappear,  with the advance of canal irrigation. Dry though the climate is the Bar  was in good seasons a famous grazing area. The scrub consisted mainly of  _jand_ (Prosopis spicigera), _jal_ (Salvadora oleoides), the _karil_  (Capparis aphylla) and the _farash_ (Tamarix articulata).    ~Management and Income of Forests.~--The Forest Department of the Panjab  has existed singe 1864, when the first Conservator was appointed. In  1911-12 it managed 8359 square miles in the Panjab consisting of:      Reserved Forests  1844 square miles    Protected    \"    5203   \"     \"    Unclassed    \"    1312   \"     \"    It was also in charge of 235 square miles of reserved forest in the  Hazara district of the N.W.F. Province, and of 364 miles of fine  mountain forest in the native State of Bashahr. In addition a few  reserved forests have been made over as grazing areas to the Military  Department, and Deputy Commissioners are in charge of a very large area  of unclassed forest.    No forest can be declared \"reserved\" or \"protected\" unless it is owned  in whole or in part by the State. It is enough if the trees or some of  them are the property of the Government. In order to safeguard all  private rights a special forest settlement must be made before a forest  can be declared to be \"reserved.\" In the case of a protected forest it  is enough if Government is satisfied that the rights of the State and of  private persons have been recorded at a land revenue settlement. After  deducting income belonging to the year 1909-10 realized in 1910-11, the  average income of the two years ending 1911-12 was L81,805 (Rs.  1,227,082) and the average expenditure L50,954 (Rs. 764,309).    ~Sources of Income.~--In the mountain forests the chief source of income  is the _deodar_, which is valuable both for railway sleepers and as  building timber. The blue pine is also of commercial value. _Deodar_,  blue pine, and some _chir_ are floated down the rivers to depots in the  plains. Firwood is inferior to cedar and pine, and the great fir forests  are too remote for profitable working at present. There are fine  mountain forests in Chitral, on the Safed Koh, and in Western  Waziristan, but these have so far not even been fully explored. The  value of the hill forests may be increased by the success which has  attended the experimental extraction of turpentine from the resin of the  _chir_ pine. The bamboo forests of Kangra are profitable. At present an  attempt is being made to acclimatize several species of Eucalyptus in  the low hills. The scrub _jangal_ in the plains yields good fuel. As the  area is constantly shrinking it is fortunate that the railways have  ceased to depend on this source of supply, coal having to a great extent  taken the place of wood. To prevent shortage of fuel considerable areas  in the tracts commanded by the new canals are being reserved for  irrigated forests. A forest of this class covering an area of 37 square  miles and irrigated from the Upper Bari Doab Canal has long existed at  Changa Manga in the Lahore district.    ~Forests in Kashmir.~--The extensive and valuable Kashmir forests are  mountain and hill forests, the former, which cover much the larger area  yielding, _deodar_, blue pine, and firs, and the latter _chir_ pine. The  total area exceeds 2600 square miles.          CHAPTER VIII    BEASTS, BIRDS, FISHES, AND INSECTS      ~Fauna.~--With the spread of cultivation and drainage the Panjab plains  have ceased to be to anything like the old extent the haunt of wild  beasts and wild fowl. The lion has long been extinct and the tiger has  practically disappeared. Leopards are to be found in low hills, and  sometimes stray into the plains. Wolves are "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24583"],[0,"Langstroth on the Hive and the Honey-Bee: A Bee Keeper's Manual (#15)"],[1,"plane may be cut into little spaces that  shall be equal, similar and regular, without leaving any interstices.\"    An equilateral triangle would have made an uncomfortable tenement for an  insect with a round body; and a square would not have been much better.  At first sight a circle would seem to be the best shape for the  development of the larvae: but such a figure would have caused a needless  sacrifice of space, materials and strength; while the honey which now  adheres so admirably to the many angles or corners of the six-sided  cell, would have been much more liable to run out! I will venture to  assign a new reason for the hexagonal form. The body of the immature  insect as it undergoes its changes, is charged with a super-abundance of  moisture which passes off through the reticulated cover which the bees  build over its cell: a hexagon while it approaches so nearly the shape  of a circle as not to incommode the young bee, furnishes in its six  corners the necessary vacancies for its more thorough ventilation!    So invariably uniform in size, as well as perfect in other respects, are  the cells in which the workers are bred, that some mathematicians have  proposed their adoption, as the best unit for measures of capacity to  serve for universal use.    Can we believe that these little insects unite so many requisites in the  construction of their cells, either by chance, or because they are  profoundly versed in the most intricate mathematics? Are we not  compelled to acknowledge that the mathematics must be referred to the  Creator, and not to His puny creature? To an intelligent, candid mind, a  piece of honey comb is a complete demonstration that there is a \"GREAT  FIRST CAUSE:\" for on no other supposition can we account for so  complicated a shape, and yet the only one which can possibly unite so  many desirable requisites.        \"On books deep poring, ye pale sons of toil,      Who waste in studious trance the midnight oil,      Say, can ye emulate with all your rules,      Drawn or from Grecian or from Gothic schools,      This artless frame? Instinct her simple guide,      A heaven-taught Insect baffles all your pride.      Not all yon marshall'd orbs, that ride so high,      Proclaim more loud a present Deity,      Than the nice symmetry of these small cells,      Where on each angle genuine science dwells.\"                                            _Evans._          CHAPTER V.    PROPOLIS, OR \"BEE-GLUE.\"      This substance is obtained by the bees from the resinous buds and limbs  of trees; and when first gathered, it is usually of a bright golden  color, and is exceedingly sticky. The different kinds of poplars furnish  a rich supply. The bees bring it on their thighs just as they do bee  bread; and I have caught them as they were entering with a load, and  taken it from them. It adheres so firmly that it is difficult to remove  it.    \"Huber planted in Spring some branches of the wild poplar, before the  leaves were developed, and placed them in pots near his Apiary; the bees  alighting on them, separated the folds of the largest buds with their  forceps, extracted the varnish in threads, and loaded with it, first one  thigh and then the other; for they convey it like pollen, transferring  it by the first pair of legs to the second, by which it is lodged in the  hollow of the third.\" The smell of the propolis is often precisely  similar to that of the resin from the poplar, and chemical analysis  proves the identity of the two substances. It is frequently gathered  from the alder, horse-chestnut, birch, and willow; and as some think,  from pines and other trees of the fir kind. I have often known bees to  enter the shops where varnishing was being carried on, attracted  evidently by the smell: and Bevan mentions the fact of their carrying  off a composition of wax and turpentine, from trees to which it had  been applied. Dr. Evans says that he has seen them collect the balsamic  varnish which coats the young blossom buds of the hollyhock, and has  known them to rest at least ten minutes on the same bud, moulding the  balsam with their fore feet, and transferring it to the hinder legs, as  described by Huber.        \"With merry hum the Willow's copse they scale,      The Fir's dark pyramid, or Poplar pale,      Scoop from the Aider's leaf its oozy flood,      Or strip the Chestnut's resin-coated bud,      Skim the light tear that tips Narcissus' ray,      Or round the Hollyhock's hoar fragrance play.      Soon temper'd to their will through eve's low beam,      And link'd in airy bands the viscous stream,      They waft their nut-brown loads exulting home,      That form a fret-work for the future comb;      Caulk every chink where rushing winds may roar,      And seal their circling ramparts to the floor.\"                                              _Evans._    A mixture of wax and propolis is used by the bees to strengthen the  attachments of the combs to the top and sides of the hive, and serves  most admirably for this purpose, as it is much more adhesive than wax  alone. If the combs, as soon as they are built, are not filled with  honey or brood, they are beautifully varnished with a most delicate  coating of this material, which adds exceedingly to their strength: but  as this natural varnish impairs their delicate whiteness, they ought not  to be allowed to remain in the surplus honey receptacles, accessible to  the bees, unless when they are actively engaged in storing them with  honey.    The bees make a very liberal use of this substance to fill up all the  crevices about their premises: and as the natural summer heat of the  hive keeps it soft, the bee moth selects it as a proper place of deposit  for her eggs. For this reason, the hive should be made of sound lumber,  entirely free from cracks, and thoroughly painted on the inside as well  as outside. When glass is used, there is no risk that the bed moth will  find a place in which she can insert her ovi-positor and lay her eggs.  The corners of the hive, which the bees always fill with propolis,  should have a melted mixture of three parts rosin, and one part bees-wax  run into them, which remains hard during the hottest weather, and bids  defiance to the moth. The inside of the hive may be coated with the same  mixture, put on hot with a brush.    The bees find it difficult to gather the propolis, and equally so to  remove from their thighs, and to work so sticky a material. For this  reason, it is doubly important to save them all unnecessary labor in  amassing it. To men, time is _money_; to bees, it is _honey_; and all  the arrangements of the hive should be such as to economize it to the  very utmost.    Propolis is sometimes put to a very curious use by the bees. \"A  snail[10] having crept into one of M. Reaumur's hives early in the  morning, after crawling about for some time, adhered by means of its own  slime to one of the glass panes. The bees having discovered the snail,  surrounded it and formed a border of propolis round the verge of its  shell, and fastened it so securely to the glass that it became  immovable.\"        \"Forever closed the impenetrable door,      It naught avails that in his torpid veins      Year after year, life's loitering spark remains.\"[11]                                               _Evans._    \"Maraldi, another eminent Apiarian, has related a somewhat similar  instance. He states that a snail without a shell, or slug, as it is  called, had entered one of his hives; and that the bees, as soon as they  observed it, stung it to death: after which being unable to dislodge  it, they covered it all over with an impervious coat of propolis.\"        \"For soon in fearless ire, their wonder lost,      Spring fiercely from the comb the indignant host,      Lay the pierced monster breathless on the ground,      And clap in joy their victor pinions round:      While all in vain concurrent numbers strive,      To heave the slime-girt giant from the hive--      Sure not alone by force Instinctive swayed,      But blest with reason's soul directing aid,      Alike in man or bee, they haste to pour,      Thick hard'ning as it falls, the flaky shower;      Embalmed in shroud of glue the mummy lies,      No worms invade, no foul miasmas rise.\"                                               _Evans._    \"In these cases who can withhold his admiration of the ingenuity and  judgment of the bees? _In the first case_ a troublesome creature gained  admission to the hive, which, from its unwieldiness, they could not  remove, and which, from the impenetrability of its shell, they could not  destroy: here then their only resource was to deprive it of locomotion,  and to obviate putrefaction; both which objects they accomplished most  skilfully and securely--and as is usual with these sagacious creatures,  at the least possible expense of labor and materials. They applied their  cement where alone it was required, round the verge of the shell. _In  the latter case_, to obviate the evil of decay, by the total exclusion  of air, they were obliged to be more lavish in the use of their  embalming material, and to case over the \"slime girt giant\" so as to  guard themselves from his noisome smell. What means more effectual could  human wisdom have devised under similar circumstances?\"        \"If in the insect, Season's twilight ray      Sheds on the darkling mind a doubtful day,      Plain is the steady light her _Instincts_ yield,      To point the road o'er life's unvaried field;      If few these instincts, to the destined goal,      With surer coarse, their straiten'd currents roll.\"                                               _Evans._    FOOTNOTES:    [10] Bevan.    [11] Some very extraordinary instances are related of the protraction of  life in snails. After they had lain in a cabinet above fifteen years,  immersing them in water caused them to revive and crawl out of their  shells.          CHAPTER VI.    "]]]
