The sight of these people refreshing themselves  reminded me that I was beginning to feel the need of food, and I called  out to the doctor to ask if I might have something to eat and drink.  He  at once rose up and came to me, felt my pulse, looked at my tongue, and  prescribed a small quantity of broth, which Jack Keene presently brought  me, and which I found delicious.  I may here mention that several days  later I became aware that this same broth--the origin of which puzzled  me at the moment, though not enough to prevent me from taking it--had  been prepared from a kind of tortoise, the existence of which in large  numbers on the spit Hutchinson had accidentally discovered that very  morning, and in pursuit of which he had sent out two of the most  slightly wounded with a sack, and instructions to catch and bring in as  many of the creatures as they could readily find.    While I was taking my broth the worthy medico stepped to where Nugent  was lying and bent over the poor fellow, feeling his pulse and watching  his white, pain-drawn face.  Then, rising softly, he went into a dark  corner of the tent, where, it appeared, his medicine-chest was stowed  away, and quickly prepared a draught, which he brought and held to the  lips of the patient, tenderly raising the head of the latter to enable  him to drink it.  Then, having replaced the sufferer's head upon the  makeshift pillow, he bent over and murmured a few words in the dying  man's ear.  What they were I know not, nor did I catch Nugent's  response, but the effect of the brief colloquy was that Hutchinson drew  from his pocket a small copy of the New Testament and, after glancing  here and there at its opened pages, finally began to read, in a clear  voice and very impressively, the fifteenth chapter of the first epistle  to the Corinthians, reading it through to the end.  As he proceeded I  saw poor Nugent slowly and painfully draw up his hands, that had lain  clenched upon the sand beside him, until they were folded upon his  breast in the attitude of prayer.  And when at length Hutchinson, with a  steady voice, but with the tears trickling down his cheeks, reached the  passage, \"But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory,\" Nugent's  lips began to move as though he were silently repeating the words.  The  chapter ended, Hutchinson remained silent for a few moments, regarding  his patient, who he evidently believed was praying.  Suddenly Nugent's  eyes opened wide, and he stared up in surprise at the canvas roof over  his head as though he beheld some wonderful sight; the colour flowed  back into his cheeks and lips, and gradually his face became illumined  with a smile of ecstatic joy.    \"Yes,\" he murmured, \"thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory--_the  victory_--victory!\"  As he spoke his voice rose until the final word was  a shout of inexpressible triumph.  Then the colour ebbed away again from  cheeks and lips, a film seemed to gather over the still open eyes, the  death-rattle sounded in the patient's throat, he gasped once, as if for  breath, and then a look of perfect, ineffable peace settled upon the  waxen features.  Nugent's gallant soul had gone forth to join the ranks  of the great Captain of his salvation.        CHAPTER SIX.    WE FIND NEW QUARTERS.    It was about half an hour after Nugent's death that young Parkinson, who  had been engaged somewhere outside the tent, came in and said to  Hutchinson--    \"The launch, under sail, and with only about half a dozen hands in her,  has just hove in sight from somewhere up the river.  None of the other  boats seem to be in company, but as she is flying her ensign at the  peak,\"--the launch, it may be mentioned, was rigged as a fore-and-aft  schooner--\"I suppose it's all right.\"    \"It is to be hoped so,\" fervently responded the medico; \"goodness knows  we don't want anything further in the nature of a disaster; we've had  quite enough of that sort of thing already.  Could you distinguish the  features of any of the people in the boat?\"    \"No, sir,\" answered the lad.  \"I hadn't a glass with me.  Is there such  a thing knocking about anywhere here in the tent, I wonder?\"    \"Yes,\" answered Hutchinson.  \"You will find Mr Nugent's somewhere  about.  It was picked up and brought in by the fatigue-party this  morning.  You might take it, if you can find it, and see if you can  distinguish an officer in the boat.  The glass ought to be somewhere  over there.\"    Parkinson went to the spot indicated, and proceeded to rummage among the  heterogeneous articles that had been recovered from the scene of the  previous night's fight, and soon routed out the instrument of which he  was in search, with which he went to the opening of the tent, from which  the launch was by this time visible.  Applying the telescope to his eye,  he focussed it upon the fast-approaching boat and stared intently  through the tube.    \"Yes,\" he said at length, \"I can make out Mr Purchase in the stern-  sheets, with Rawlings, the coxswain, alongside of him; and there is  Cupid's ugly mug acting as figure-head to the boat.  The beggar is  grinning like a Cheshire cat--I can see his double row of ivories  distinctly--so I expect there is nothing much the matter.\"    Presently, from where I was lying, the launch slid into view, coming  down-stream at a great pace under whole canvas, and driven along by a  breeze that laid her over gunwale-to.  She was edging in toward our side  of the river; and as I watched her movements, her crew suddenly sprang  to their feet, apparently in obedience to an order; her foresail and  mainsail were simultaneously brailed up at the same moment that her  staysail was hauled down, then her helm was put up and she swerved  inward toward the beach, upon which she grounded a minute later.  Then  Mr Purchase rose to his feet, sprang up on the thwarts, and, striding  from one to the other, finally sprang out upon the beach, up which,  followed by Cupid, he made his way toward our tent.  A couple of minutes  later he stood in the entrance, waiting for his eyes to accustom  themselves to the comparative darkness of the interior.    \"Well, doc.,\" he exclaimed cheerily, \"how have things been going with  you to-day?\"    \"Quite as well as I could reasonably have expected, taking all things  into consideration,\" answered Hutchinson.  \"Poor Nugent has passed  away--went about half an hour ago--but the rest of the wounded are doing  excellently.  How have things gone with you, and where are the others?\"    \"Left them behind busily preparing quarters for you and your  contingent,\" answered Purchase.  \"We have had a pretty lively time of  it, I can tell you, since we left here this morning.  Searched both  banks of the river for a dozen miles or more, exploring creeks in search  of the gentry who attacked us from the river last night, and who  undoubtedly put the savages up to the shore attack upon the camp, and  eventually found them snugly tucked away in a big lagoon about twelve  miles from here, the entrance of which is so artfully concealed that we  might have passed it within a hundred fathoms and never suspected its  existence.  Splendid place it is for carrying on the slave traffic;  large open lagoon, with an average of about fifteen feet of water  everywhere; fine spacious wharf, with water enough for ships to lie  alongside; two spanking big barracoons; and a regular village of well-  built houses; in fact, the finest and most complete slave factory that  I've ever seen.  Well-arranged defences, too; battery of four nine-  pounders; houses loop-holed for musketry; and a garrison of about a  hundred of the most villainous-looking Portuguese, Spaniards, and half-  breeds that one need wish to meet.  They were evidently on the look-out  for us--had been watching us all day, I expect--and opened a brisk fire  upon us the moment that we hove in sight.  Luckily for us their shooting  was simply disgraceful, and we managed to effect a landing, with only  two or three hurt.  But then came the tug-of-war.  The beggars  barricaded themselves inside their houses, and blazed away at us at  short range, and then, of course, our people began to drop.  But Perry  wouldn't take any refusal; landed the boat guns, dragged them forward,  and blew in the doors, one after the other, stormed the houses, and  carried them in succession at the sword's point.  After that it was all  plain sailing, but very grim work, doc, I can tell you; our people had  got their blood up, and went for the Dagoes like so many tigers.  It  lasted about a quarter of an hour after we had blown the doors down, and  I don't believe that more than a dozen of the other side escaped.  Of  course we, too, suffered heavily, and there are a lot of fresh cases  waiting for you, but Murdoch is working like a Trojan.  And now I have  come to fetch you and your contingent away out of this; there is a fine,  big, airy house that Murdoch has turned into a hospital, where the  wounded will be in clover, comparatively speaking; so, if you don't  mind, we'll get to work at once and shift quarters before nightfall.\"    No sooner said than done.  As I had surmised, a party of twenty  unwounded men, under the boatswain, had been left behind by the skipper  to look after the camp when he had gone away early in the morning, and  these men were now called in to convey the most seriously wounded down  to the launch, while the less seriously hurt helped each other; and in  this way the whole of the occupants of the camp were got down to the  launch and placed on board her in about twenty minutes.

Two principal theories have been advanced, of which one puts the  relations in the things perceived, and the other makes them a work of  the mind. Let us begin with this last opinion. It consists in  supposing that the relations are given to things by the mind itself.  These relations have been termed categories. The question of  categories plays an important part in the history of philosophy. Three  great philosophers, Aristotle, Kant, and Renouvier have drawn up a  list, or, as it is called, a table of them, and this table is very  long. To give a slight idea of it, I will quote a few examples, such  as time, space, being, resemblance, difference, causality, becoming,  finality, &c.    By making the categories the peculiar possession of the mind, we  attribute to these cognitions the essential characteristic of being  anterior to sensation, or, as it is also termed, of existing _a  priori_: we are taught that not only are they not derived from  experience, nor taught us by observation, but further that they are  presupposed by all observation, for they set up, in scholastic jargon,  the conditions which make experience possible. They represent the  personal contribution of the mind to the knowledge of nature, and,  consequently, to admit them is to admit that the mind is not, in the  presence of the world, reduced to the passive state of a _tabula  rasa_, and that the faculties of the mind are not a transformation of  sensation. Only these categories do not supplement sensation, they do  not obviate it, nor allow it to be conjectured beforehand. They remain  empty forms so long as they are not applied to experience; they are  the rules of cognition and not the objects of cognition, the means of  knowing and not the things known; they render knowledge possible, but  do not of themselves constitute it, Experience through the senses  still remains a necessary condition to the knowledge of the external  world. It may be said that the senses give the matter of knowledge,  and that the categories of the understanding give the form of it.  Matter cannot exist without form, nor form without matter; it is the  union of the two which produces cognition.    Such is the simplest idea that can be given of the Kantian theory of  categories, or, if it is preferred to employ the term often used and  much discussed, such is the theory of the Kantian idealism, This  theory, I will say frankly, hardly harmonises with the ideas I have  set forth up to this point. To begin with, let us scrutinise the  relation which can exist between the subject and the object. We have  seen that the existence of the subject is hardly admissible, for it  could only be an object in disguise. Cognition is composed in reality  of an object and an act of consciousness. Now, how can we know if this  act of consciousness, by adding itself to the object, modifies it and  causes it to appear other than it is?    This appears to me an insoluble question, and probably, even, a  factitious one. The idea that an object can be modified in its nature  or in its aspect comes to us through the perception of bodies. We see  that, by attacking a metal with acids, this metal is modified, and  that by heating a body its colour and form become changed; or that by  electrifying a thread it acquires new properties; or that when we  place glasses before our eyes we change the visible aspect of objects;  or that, if we have inflammation of the eyelids, light is painful, and  so on. All these familiar experiments represent to us the varied  changes that a body perceived can undergo; but it must be carefully  remarked that in cases of this kind the alteration in the body is  produced by the action of a second body, that the effect is due to an  intercourse between two objects. On the contrary, when we take the  Kantian hypothesis, that the consciousness modifies that which it  perceives, we are attributing to the consciousness an action which has  been observed in the case of the objects, and are thus transporting  into one domain that which belongs to a different one; and we are  falling into the very common error which consists in losing sight of  the proper nature of the consciousness and making out of it an object.    If we set aside this incorrect assimilation, there no longer remains  any reason for refusing to admit that we perceive things as they are,  and that the consciousness, by adding itself to objects, does not  modify them.    Phenomena and appearances do not, then, strictly speaking, exist. Till  proof to the contrary, we shall admit that everything we perceive is  real, that we perceive things always as they are, or, in other words,  that we always perceive _noumena_.[26]    After having examined the relations of the consciousness with its  objects, let us see what concerns the perception, by the  consciousness, of the relations existing between these objects  themselves. The question is to ascertain whether the _a priorists_ are  right in admitting that the establishment of these relations is the  work of the consciousness. The role of synthetic power that is thus  attributed to consciousness is difficult to conceive unless we alter  the definition of consciousness to fit the case. In accordance with  the definition we have given and the idea we have of it, the  consciousness makes us acquainted with what a thing is, but it adds  nothing to it. It is not a power which begets objects, nor is it a  power which begets relations.    Let us carefully note the consequence at which we should arrive, if,  while admitting, on the one hand, that our consciousness lights up and  reveals the objects without creating them, we were, on the other hand,  to admit that it makes up for this passivity by creating relations  between objects. We dare not go so far as to say that this creation of  relations is arbitrary and corresponds in no way to reality; or that,  when we judge two neighbouring or similar objects, the relations of  contiguity and resemblance are pure inventions of our consciousness,  and that these objects are really neither contiguous nor similar.    It must therefore be supposed that the relation is already, in some  manner, attracted into the objects; it must be admitted that our  intelligence does not apply its categories haphazard or from the  caprice of the moment; and it must be admitted that it is led to apply  them because it has perceived in the objects themselves a sign and a  reason which are an invitation to this application, and its  justification. On this hypothesis, therefore, contiguity and  resemblance must exist in the things themselves, and must be  perceived; for without this we should run the risk of finding similar  that which is different, and contiguous that which has no relation of  time or space. Whence it results, evidently, that our consciousness  cannot create the connection completely, and then we are greatly  tempted to conclude that it only possesses the faculty of perceiving  it when it exists in the objects.[27]    According to this conception, the role of the consciousness in the  perception of a connection is that of a witness, as in the perception  of objects. The consciousness does not create, but it verifies.  Resemblance is a physical property of objects, like colour; and  contiguity is a physical property of objects, like form. The  connections between the objects form part of the group object and not  of the group consciousness, and they are just as independent of  consciousness as are the objects themselves.    Against this conclusion we must anticipate several objections. One of  them will probably consist in accentuating the difference existing  between the object and the connection from the dynamical point of  view. That the object may be passively contemplated by the  consciousness can be understood, it will be said; but the relation is  not only an object of perception--it is, further, a principle of  action, a power of suggestion, and an agent of change.    It might, then, he supposed that the consciousness here finds a  compensation for the role that has been withdrawn from it. If it is  not the thing that creates the relation, it will be said, at least it  is that which creates its efficacity of suggestion. Many psychologists  have supposed that a relation has the power of evocation only when it  has been perceived. The perception of resemblance precedes the action  of resemblance. It is consequently the consciousness which assembles  the ideas and gives them birth by perceiving their relations.    This error, for it is one, has long been wide-spread--indeed, it still  persists.[28] We have, however, no difficulty in understanding that  the perception of a resemblance between two terms supposes them to be  known; so long as only one of the terms is present to the  consciousness, this perception does not exist; it cannot therefore  possess the property of bringing to light the second term. Suggestion  is therefore distinct from recognition; it is when suggestion has  acted, when the resemblance in fact has brought the two terms  together, that the consciousness, taking cognisance of the work  accomplished, verifies the existence of a resemblance, and that this  resemblance explains the suggestion.    Second objection: we are told that the relations between the  objects--that is, the principal categories--must be of a mental  nature, because they are _a priori_. That they are _a priori_ means  that they are at once anterior and superior to the experience. Let us  see what this argument is worth.    It appears that it is somewhat misused. With regard to many of the  categories, we are content to lay down the necessity of an abstract  idea in order to explain the comprehension of a concrete one. It"]]]
