[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2770"],[0,"Five Little Peppers and How They Grew (#15)"],[1," old Mrs. Bascom's lap.    Home and mother! Little Phronsie slept all that night straight through.  The neighbors came in softly, and with awestruck visages stole into the  bedroom to look at the child; and as they crept out again, thoughts  of their own little ones tugging at their hearts, the tears would drop  unheeded.          NEW FRIENDS      Up the stairs of the hotel, two steps at a time, ran a boy with a big,  black dog at his heels. \"Come on, Prince; soft, now,\" as they neared a  door at the end of the corridors.    It opened into a corner room overlooking \"the Park,\" as the small  open space in front of the hotel was called. Within the room there was  sunshine and comfort, it being the most luxurious one in the house,  which the proprietor had placed at the disposal of this most exacting  guest. He didn't look very happy, however--the gentleman who sat in an  easy chair by the window; a large, handsome old gentleman, whose whole  bearing showed plainly that personal comfort had always been his, and  was, therefore, neither a matter of surprise nor thankfulness.    \"Where have you been?\" he asked, turning around to greet the boy who  came in, followed by Prince.    \"Oh, such a long story, father!\" he cried, flushed; his eyes sparkling  as he flung back the dark hair from his forehead. \"You can't even  guess!\"    \"Never mind now,\" said the old gentleman, testily; \"your stories are  always long; the paper hasn't come--strange, indeed, that one must needs  be so annoyed! do ring that bell again.\"    So the bell was pulled; and a porter popped in his head.    \"What is it, sir?\"    \"The paper,\" said the old gentleman, irritably; \"hasn't it come yet?\"    \"No, sir,\" said the man; and then he repeated, \"taint in yet, please,  sir.\"    \"Very well--you said so once; that's all,\" waving his hand; then as the  door closed, he said to his son, \"That pays one for coming to such an  out-of-the-way country place as this, away from papers--I never will do  it again.\"    As the old gentleman, against the advice of many friends who knew his  dependence on externals, had determined to come to this very place, the  boy was not much startled at the decisive words. He stood very quietly,  however, until his father finished. Then he said:    \"It's too bad, father! supposing I tell you my story? Perhaps you'll  enjoy hearing it while you wait--it's really quite newspaperish.\"    \"Well, you might as well tell it now, I suppose,\" said the old  gentleman; \"but it is a great shame about that paper! to advertise that  morning papers are to be obtained--it's a swindle, Jasper! a complete  swindle!\" and the old gentleman looked so very irate that the boy  exerted himself to soothe him.    \"I know,\" he said; \"but they can't help the trains being late.\"    \"They shouldn't have the trains late,\" said his father, unreasonably.  \"There's no necessity for all this prating about 'trains late.' I'm  convinced it's because they forgot to send down for the papers till they  were all sold.\"    \"I don't believe that's it, father,\" said the boy, trying to change the  subject; \"but you don't know how splendid Prince has been, nor--\" \"And  then such a breakfast!\" continued the old gentleman.    \"My liver certainly will be in a dreadful state if these things  continue!\" And he got up, and going to the corner of the room, opened  his medicine chest, and taking a box of pills therefrom, he swallowed  two, which done, he came back with a somewhat easier expression to his  favorite chair.    \"He was just splendid, father,\" began the boy; \"he went for him, I tell  you!\"    \"I hope, Jasper, your dog has not been doing anything violent,\" said the  old gentleman. \"I must caution you; he'll get you into trouble some day;  and then there'll be a heavy bill to pay; he grows more irritable every  day.\"    \"Irritable!\" cried the boy, flinging his arms around the dog's neck, who  was looking up at the old gentleman in high disdain. \"He's done the most  splendid thing you ever saw! Why, he saved a little girl, father, from  a cross old organ-man, and he drove that man--oh! you ought to have seen  him run!\"    And now that it was over, Jasper put back his head and laughed long and  loud as he remembered the rapid transit of the musical pair.    \"Well, how do you know she wasn't the man's daughter?\" asked his father,  determined to find fault someway. \"You haven't any business to go around  the country setting your dog on people. I shall have an awful bill  to pay some day, Jasper--an awful bill!\" he continued, getting up and  commencing to pace up and down the floor in extreme irritation.    \"Father,\" cried the boy, half laughing, half vexed, springing to his  side, and keeping step with him, \"we found her brother; he came along  when we were by the side of the road. We couldn't go any further, for  the poor little thing was all tired out. And don't you think they live  over in Badgertown, and--\"    \"Well,\" said the old gentleman, pausing in his walk, and taking out  his watch to wonder if that paper would ever come, \"she had probably  followed the organ-man; so it served her right after all.\"    \"Well, but father,\" and the boy's dark eyes glowed, \"she was such a  cunning little thing! she wasn't more than four years old; and she had  such a pretty little yellow head; and she said so funny--'I want Polly.\"    \"Did she?\" said the old gentleman, getting interested in spite of  himself; \"what then?\"    \"Why, then, sir,\" said Jasper, delighted at his success in diverting  his thoughts, \"Prince and I waited--and waited; and I was just going to  bring her here to ask you what we should do, when--\" \"Dear me!\" said  the old gentleman, instinctively starting back as if he actually saw the  forlorn little damsel, \"you needn't ever bring such people here, Jasper!  I don't know what to do with them, I'm sure!\"    \"Well,\" said the boy, laughing, \"we didn't have to, did we, Prince?\"  stroking the big head of the dog who was slowly following the two as  they paced up and down, but keeping carefully on the side of his master;  \"for just as we really didn't know what to do, don't you think there was  a big wagon came along, drawn by the ricketiest old horse, and a boy in  the wagon looking both sides of the road, and into every bush, just as  wild as he could be, and before I could think, hardly, he spied us, and  if he didn't jump! I thought he'd broken his leg--\"    \"And I suppose he just abused you for what you had done,\" observed the  old gentleman, petulantly; \"that's about all the gratitude there is in  this world.\"    \"He didn't seem to see me at all,\" said the boy. \"I thought he'd eat the  little girl up.\"    \"Ought to have looked out for her better then,\" grumbled the old  gentleman, determined to find fault with somebody.    \"And he's a splendid fellow, I just know,\" cried Jasper, waxing  enthusiastic; \"and his name is Pepper.\"    \"Pepper!\" repeated his father; \"no nice family ever had the name of  Pepper!\"    \"Well, I don't care,\" and Jasper's laugh was loud and merry; \"he's  nice anyway,--I know; and the little thing's nice; and I'm going to see  them--can't I, father?\"    \"Dear me!\" said his father; \"how can you, Jasper? You do have the  strangest tastes I ever saw!\"    \"It's dreadful dull here,\" pleaded the boy, touching the right string;  \"you know that yourself, father, and I don't know any boys around here;  and Prince and I are so lonely on our walks--do permit me, father!\"    The old gentleman, who really cared very little about it, turned away,  muttering, \"Well, I'm sure I don't care; go where you like,\" when a  knock was heard at the door, and the paper was handed in, which broke up  the conversation, and restored good humor.    The next day but one, Ben was out by the wood-pile, trying to break up  some kindlings for Polly who was washing up the dishes, and otherwise  preparing for the delights of baking day.    \"Hulloa!\" said a voice bethought he knew.    He turned around to see the merry-faced boy, and the big, black dog who  immediately began to wag his tail as if willing to recognize him.    \"You see I thought you'd never look round,\" said the boy with a laugh.  \"How's the little girl?\"    \"Oh! you have come, really,\" cried Ben, springing over the wood-pile  with a beaming face. \"Polly!\"    But Polly was already by the door, with dish-cloth in hand. \"This is my  sister, Polly,\" began Ben--and then stopped, not knowing the boy's name.    \"I'm Jasper King,\" said the boy, stepping upon the flat stone by Polly's  side; and taking off his cap, he put out his hand. \"And this is Prince,\"  he added.    Polly put her hand in his, and received a hearty shake; and then she  sprang over the big stove, dish-cloth and all, and just flung her arms  around the dog's neck.    \"Oh, you splendid fellow, you!\" said she. \"Don't you know we all think  you're as good as gold?\"    The dog submitted to the astonishing proceeding as if he liked it, while  Jasper, delighted with Polly's appreciation, beamed down on them, and  struck up friendship with her on the instant.    \"Now, I must call Phronsie,\" said Polly, getting up, her face as red as  a rose.    \"Is her name Phronsie?\" asked the boy with interest.    \"No, it's Sophronia,\" said Polly, \"but we call her Phronsie.\"    \"What a very funny name,\" said Jasper, \"Sophronia is, for such a little  thing--and yours is Polly, is it not?\" he asked, turning around suddenly  on her.    \"Yes,\" said Polly; \"no, not truly Polly; it's Mary, my real name is--but  I've always been Polly.\"    \"I like Polly best, too,\" declared Jasper, \"it sounds so nice.\"    \"And his name is Ben,\" said Polly.    \"Ebenezer, you mean,\" said Ben, correcting her.    \"Well, we call him Ben,\" said Polly; \"it don't ever seem as if there was  any Ebenezer about it.\"    \"I should think not,\" laughed Jasper.    \"Well, I must get Phronsie,\" again said Polly, running back into the  bedroom, where that small damsel was busily engaged in washing \"Baby\"  in the basin of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27713"],[0,"The Elements of Bacteriological Technique (#15)"],[1,"filter.    ~Fuchsin (Basic).~--    10. _Saturated Aqueous Solution._    Weigh out        Basic fuchsin             1.5 grammes    and proceed as in preparing the corresponding solution of methylene-blue  (_q. v._).    11. _Saturated Alcoholic Solution._    Weigh out        Basic fuchsin   3.5 grammes    and proceed as in preparing the corresponding solution of  methylene-blue.    12. _Carbolic Fuchsin_ (Ziehl).

BLOOD STAINS    When watery solutions of medicinal methylene blue and water soluble  eosins are mixed a precipitate is formed which is soluble only in  alcohol, and solutions of this precipitate impart a peculiar  reddish-purple colour to chromatin. This compound was first used by  Romanowsky to demonstrate malarial parasites, but various modifications  are now employed for staining blood films generally, and also for  bacteria and protozoa. The best modifications of the original Romanowsky  are those of Jenner and Leishman--Jenner being most suitable for the  histological study of the blood, and Leishman for the demonstration of  protozoa.      ~Jenner's Stain.~--    A. Weigh out:        Eosin aqueous yellow      6.0 grammes    Dissolve in        Distilled water (non-alkaline)      250 c.c.    This will make a thick solution.    B. Weigh out:        Methylene blue (medicinally pure) Hoechst      5.0 grammes    Dissolve in        Distilled water (non-alkaline)      250 c.c.    1. Add B to A very slowly, stirring all the time. A viscous precipitate  forms which frequently loses its viscosity when heat is applied. (This  explains the necessity of mixing slowly).    2. Evaporate slowly in a porcelain basin, stirring occasionally, on a  water bath at 55 deg. C. When a paste begins to form scrape and break up  occasionally. (On no account must the paste be allowed to fuse.)    3. Grind the resulting mass into an amorphous powder.    4. Weigh out:        Amorphous powder      0.5 grammes    Dissolve in        Methylic alcohol (Merck's puriss, for analysis)      100 c.c.    Allow time for true solution. (About three days is sufficient.)    METHOD.--    1. Prepare film, dry, but _do not fix_.    2. Flood the unfixed film with the stain, allow it to act for 3 minutes  (the methylic alcohol of the stain fixes the film).    3. Pour off the stain and wash in distilled water until the film  presents a pink colour.    4. Dry and mount.      ~Leishman's Stain.~--    _A._ Weigh out:        Methylene blue (medicinal)      1 gramme    Dissolve in        Sodium carbonate, 0.5 per cent. aqueous solution      100 c.c.    Keep at 65 deg. C. for 12 hours in either a hot incubator or a water-bath;  then stand in dark place at room temperature (20 deg. C.) for ten days.    _B._ Weigh out:        Eosin, extra B. A.      0.1 gramme    Dissolve in        Distilled water      100 c.c.    1. Mix the two solutions A and B in equal volumes, and allow the  mixture to stand for 12 hours with occasional stirring.    2. Filter, and collect precipitate on filter paper.    3. Wash precipitate thoroughly with distilled water, and dry.    4. Weigh out 0.15 gramme of the dried precipitate; rub up in a mortar  with 5 c.c. of methylic alcohol (Merck's puriss, for analysis).    Allow undissolved powder to settle, then decant the supernatant fluid to  a clean 100 c.c. measuring cylinder.    5. Add further 5 c.c. alcohol to sediment in mortar and repeat the  process, and so on until all the sediment has been dissolved.    6. Now make up the fluid in the measuring cylinder to 100 c.c. by the  addition of more methylic alcohol.    METHOD.--    1. Prepare film, dry, but _do not fix_.    2. Flood the unfixed film with stain, allow it to act 30 seconds.    3. Add double the volume of distilled water to the stain on the film,  and mix with glass rod or platinum loop.    4. Allow this diluted stain to act five minutes.    5. Wash off with distilled water.    6. Leave some water on film for thirty seconds to intensify the colour  contrasts.    7. Dry and mount.      METHODS OF DEMONSTRATING STRUCTURE OF BACTERIA, ETC.    ~To Demonstrate Capsules.~    ~1. MacConkey.~--    _Stain._--    Weigh out        Dahlia                          0.5 gramme      Methyl green (00 crystals)      1.5 grammes    rub up in a mortar with        Distilled water      100.0 c.c.    Add        Fuchsin, saturated alcoholic solution      10.0 c.c.    and make up to 200 c.c. by the addition of        Distilled water      90.0 c.c.    Filter.    Allow the stain to stand for two weeks before use; keep in a dark place  or in an amber glass bottle. Owing to the unstable character of the  methyl green, this stain deteriorates after about six months.    METHOD.--    1. Prepare and fix film in the usual manner.    2. Flood the cover-slip with the stain and allow it to act for five to  ten minutes.    3. Wash very thoroughly in water; if necessary, direct a powerful stream  of water on the film from a wash-bottle.    4. Dry and mount.         ~2. Muir's Method.~--         1. Prepare, dry and fix film in the ordinary manner.         2. Flood the film with carbolic fuchsin, warm until steam       begins to rise. Allow the stain to act for thirty seconds.         3. Wash quickly with methylated spirit.         4. Wash thoroughly with water.         5. Subject the film to the action of the following mordant       for five seconds:        Corrosive sublimate, saturated aqueous solution      2 c.c.      Tannic acid, 20 per cent. aqueous solution           2 c.c.      Potash alum saturated aqueous solution               5 c.c.         6. Wash thoroughly in water.         7. Treat with methylated spirit for about sixty seconds.       (The preparation should now be pale red.)         8. Wash thoroughly in water.         9. Counterstain in methylene blue, aqueous solution thirty       seconds.         10. Wash in water.         11. Dehydrate in alcohol.         12. Clear in xylol and mount in xylol balsam.         ~3. Welch's Method.~--         1. Prepare and fix film in the usual manner.         2. Flood the slide with acetic acid 2 per cent.; allow the       acid to remain in contact with the film for two minutes.       This swells up and fixes the capsule and enables it to take       the stain.         3. Blow off the acetic acid"]]]
