Pugnatum est ab utrisque acriter. Nostri tamen, quod neque ordines  servare neque firmiter insistere neque signa subsequi poterant atque alius  alia ex navi quibuscumque signis occurrerat se adgregabat, magnopere  perturbabantur; hostes vero, notis omnibus vadii, ubi ex litore aliquos  singulares ex navi egredientes conspexerant, incitatis equis impeditos  adoriebantur, plures paucos circumsistebant, alii ab latere aperto in  universos tela coiciebant. Quod cum animadvertisset Caesar, scaphas  longarum navium, item speculatoria navigia militibus compleri iussit, et  quos laborantes conspexerat, his subsidia submittebat. Nostri, simul in  arido constiterunt, suis omnibus consecutis, in hostes impetum fecerunt  atque eos in fugam dederunt; neque longius prosequi potuerunt, quod  equites cursum tenere atque insulam capere non potuerant. Hoc unum ad  pristinam fortunam Caesari defuit.      Hostes proelio superati, simul atque se ex fuga: receperunt, statim  ad Caesarem legatos de pace miserunt; obsides sese daturos quaeque  imperasset facturos polliciti sunt. Una cum his legatis Commius Atrebas  venit, quem supra demonstraveram a Caesare in Britanniam praemissum. Hunc  illi e navi egressum, cum ad eos oratoris modo Caesaris mandata deferret,  comprehenderant atque in vincula coniecerant; tum proelio facto remiserunt  et in petenda pace eius rei culpam in multitudinem contulerunt et propter  imprudentiam ut ignosceretur petiverunt. Caesar questus quod, cum ultro  in continentem legatis missis pacem ab se petissent, bellum sine causa  intulissent, ignoscere [se] imprudentiae dixit obsidesque imperavit;  quorum illi partem statim dederunt, partem ex longinquioribus locis  arcessitam paucis diebus sese daturos dixerunt. Interea suos in agros  remigrare iusserunt, principesque undique convenire et se civitatesque  suas Caesari commendare coeperunt.      His rebus pace confirmata, post diem quartum quam est in Britanniam  ventum naves XVIII, de quibus supra demonstratum est, quae equites  sustulerant, ex superiore portu leni vento solverunt. Quae cum  adpropinquarent Britanniae et ex castris viderentur, tanta tempestas  subito coorta est ut nulla earum cursum tenere posset, sed aliae eodem  unde erant profectae referrentur, aliae ad inferiorem partem insulae, quae  est propius solis occasum, magno suo cum periculo deicerentur; quae tamen  ancoris iactis cum fluctibus complerentur, necessario adversa nocte in  altum provectae continentem petierunt.      Eadem nocte accidit ut esset luna plena, qui dies a maritimos aestus  maximos in Oceano efficere consuevit, nostrisque id erat incognitum. Ita  uno tempore et longas naves, [quibus Caesar exercitum transportandum  curaverat,] quas Caesar in aridum subduxerat, aestus complebat, et  onerarias, quae ad ancoras erant deligatae, tempestas adflictabat, neque  ulla nostris facultas aut administrandi ` aut auxiliandi dabatur.    Compluribus navibus fractis, reliquae cum essent funibus, ancoris  reliquisque armamentis amissis ad navigandum inutiles, magna, id quod  necesse erat accidere, totius exercitus perturbatio facta est. Neque enim  naves erant aliae quibus reportari possent, et omnia deerant quae ad  reficiendas naves erant usui, et, quod omnibus constabat hiemari in Gallia  oportere, frumentum in his locis in hiemem provisum non erat. Quibus  rebus cognitis, principes Britanniae, qui post proelium ad Caesarem  convenerant, inter se conlocuti, cum et equites et naves et frumentum  Romanis deesse intellegerent et paucitatem militum ex castrorum exiguitate  cognoscerent, quae hoc erant etiam angustior quod sine impedimentis Caesar  legiones transportaverat, optimum factu esse duxerunt rebellione facta  frumento commeatuque nostros prohibere et rem in hiemem producere, quod  his superatis aut reditu interclusis neminem postea belli inferendi causa  in Britanniam transiturum confidebant. Itaque rursus coniuratione facta  paulatim ex castris discedere et suos clam ex agris deducere coeperunt.      At Caesar, etsi nondum eorum consilia cognoverat, tamen et ex eventu  navium suarum et ex eo quod obsides dare intermiserant fore id quod  accidit suspicabatur. Itaque ad omnes casus subsidia comparabat. Nam et  frumentum ex agris cotidie in castra conferebat et, quae gravissime  adflictae erant naves, earum materia atque aere ad reliquas reficiendas  utebatur et quae ad eas res erant usui ex continenti comportari iubebat.    Itaque, cum summo studio a militibus administraretur, XII navibus amissis,  reliquis ut navigari [satis] commode posset effecit.      Dum ea geruntur, legione ex consuetudine una frumentatum missa, quae  appellabatur VII., neque ulla ad id tempus belli suspicione interposita,  cum pars hominum in agris remaneret, pars etiam in castra ventitaret, ii  qui pro portis castrorum in statione erant Caesari nuntiaverunt pulverem  maiorem quam consuetudo ferret in ea parte videri quam in partem legio  iter fecisset. Caesar---id quod erat---suspicatus aliquid novi a barbaris  initum consilii, cohortes quae in statione erant secum in eam partem  proficisci, ex reliquis duas in stationem succedere, reliquas armari et  confestim sese subsequi iussit. Cum paulo longius a castris processisset,  suos ab hostibus premi atque aegre sustinere et conferta legione ex  omnibus partibus tela coici animadvertit. Nam quod omni ex reliquis  partibus demesso frumento pars una erat reliqua, suspicati hostes huc  nostros esse venturos noctu in silvis delituerant; tum dispersos depositis  armis in metendo occupatos Subito adorti paucis interfectis reliquos  incertis ordinibus perturbaverant, simul equitatu atque essedis  circumdederant.      Genus hoc est ex essedis pugnae. Primo per omnes partes perequitant  et tela coiciunt atque ipso terrore equorum et strepitu rotarum ordines  plerumque perturbant, et cum se inter equitum turmas insinuaverunt, ex  essedis desiliunt et pedibus proeliantur. Aurigae interim paulatim ex  proelio excedunt atque ita currus conlocant ut, si illi a multitudine  hostium premantur, expeditum ad quos receptum habeant. Ita mobilitatem  equitum, stabilitatem peditum in proeliis praestant, ac tantum usu  cotidiano et exercitatione efficiunt uti in declivi ac praecipiti loco  incitatos equos sustinere et brevi moderari ac flectere et per temonem  percurrere et in iugo insistere et se inde in currus citissime recipere  consuerint.      Quibus rebus perturbatis nostris [novitate pugnae] tempore  oportunissimo Caesar auxilium tulit: namque eius adventu hostes  constiterunt, nostri se ex timore receperunt. Quo facto, ad lacessendum  hostem et committendum proelium alienum esse tempus arbitratus suo se loco  continuit et brevi tempore intermisso in castra legiones reduxit. Dum  haec geruntur, nostris omnibus occupatis qui erant in agris reliqui  discesserunt. Secutae sunt continuos complures dies tempeststes, quae et  nostros in castris continerent et hostem a pugna prohiberent. Interim  barbari nuntios in omnes partes dimiserunt paucitatemque nostrorum militum  suis praedicaverunt et quanta praedae faciendae atque in perpetuum sui  liberandi facultas daretur, si Romanos castris expulissent, demonstra;  verunt. His rebus celeriter magna multitudine peditatus equitatusque  coacta ad castra venerunt.      Caesar, etsi idem quod superioribus diebus acciderat fore videbat, ut,  si essent hostes pulsi, celeritate periculum effugerent, tamen nactus  equites circiter XXX, quos Commius Atrebas, de quo ante dictum est, secum  transportaverat, legiones in acie pro castris constituit. Commisso  proelio diutius nostrorum militum impetum hostes ferre non potuerunt ac  terga verterunt. Quos tanto spatio secuti quantum cursu et viribus  efficere potuerunt, complures ex iis occiderunt, deinde omnibus longe  lateque aedificiis incensis se in castra receperunt.      Eodem die legati ab hostibus missi ad Caesarem de pace venerunt. His  Caesar numerum obsidum quem ante imperaverat duplicavit eosque in  continentem adduci iussit, quod propinqua die aequinoctii infirmis navibus  hiemi navigationem subiciendam non existimabat. Ipse idoneam tempestatem  nactus paulo post mediam noctem naves solvit, quae omnes incolumes ad  continentem pervenerunt; sed ex iis onerariae duae eosdem portus quos  reliquae capere non potuerunt et paulo infra delatae sunt.      Quibus ex navibus cum essent expositi milites circiter CCC atque in  castra contenderent, Morini, quos Caesar in Britanniam proficiscens  pacatos reliquerat, spe praedae adducti primo non ita magno suorum numero  circumsteterunt ac, si sese interfici nollent, arma ponere iusserunt. Cum  illi orbe facto sese defenderent, celeriter ad clamorem hominum circiter  milia VI convenerunt; Qua re nuntiata, Caesar omnem ex castris equitatum  suis auxilio misit. Interim nostri milites impetum hostium sustinuerunt  atque amplius horis IIII fortissime pugnaverunt et paucis vulneribus  acceptis complures ex iis occiderunt. Postea vero quam equitatus noster  in conspectum venit, hostes abiectis armis terga verterunt magnusque eorum  numerus est occisus.      Caesar postero die T. Labienum legatum cum iis legionibus quas ex  Britannia reduxerat in Morinos qui rebellionem fecerant misit. Qui cum  propter siccitates paludum quo se reciperent non haberent, quo perfugio  superiore anno erant usi, omnes fere in potestatem Labieni venerunt. At  Q. Titurius et L. Cotta legati, qui in Menapiorum fines legiones duxerant,  omnibus eorum agris vastatis, frumentis succisis, aedificiis incensis,  quod Menapii se omnes in densissimas silvas abdiderant, se ad Caesarem  receperunt. Caesar in Belgis omnium legionum hiberna constituit. Eo duae  omnino civitates ex Britannia obsides miserunt, reliquae neglexerunt.

It is therefore necessary to attend to the nipples in due time--to  begin at the fifth or sixth month is not too early. If the nipples are  sufficiently prominent, little need be done for them except to wash  them with a little boric acid solution (one teaspoonful of boric acid  to a glass of water) occasionally, and now and then to rub in a little  petrolatum, plain or borated. But if the nipples are sunken so that  they are below the surface of the breast, or if they are only slightly  above the surface of the breast, they must be treated. Gentle traction  must be made on them with the fingers three or four times a day. There  are only a few cases where persistent manipulation will not develop  the nipple and make it stand out prominently.    If the nipple is tender it should be washed two or three times a day  with a mixture of alcohol and water; one part of alcohol to three  parts of water is sufficient. In washing the nipple with this diluted  alcohol it should be dried and a little petrolatum or vaseline rubbed  in. This done two or three times a day during the last month or two of  the pregnancy will generally produce a good healthy nipple.    =The Treatment of Cracked Nipples.= If the care of the nipple has been  neglected, and it develops cracks or fissures so that the nursing of  the child causes the mother severe pain, the nursing should be done  through a nipple shield, and in the meantime between the nursings the  nipple should be rubbed with the following preparation, which is  excellent and which I can fully recommend: thymol iodide, 1/2 dram;  olive oil, 1/2 ounce. This should be applied every hour to the nipple  and covered with a little cotton; before each nursing, however, it  must be well washed off with warm water or warm boric acid solution.  When the nipples are cracked, the infant's lips should also before  nursing be carefully wiped out with boric acid solution. For the  baby's mouth contains bacteria which while harmless in themselves may  if they get into the cracks of the nipple set up an inflammation of  the breast or \"mastitis\" and cause an abscess. If the cracks are  excruciatingly painful, as they sometimes are, it is necessary to give  the one breast a rest for twenty-four hours and have the child nurse  at the other until the cracks have partially healed.    =When It Is Necessary to Dry Up the Breasts.= In case of the death of  the child, or if the mother for some other reason finds herself unable  to nurse, such as in cases where there is absolutely no nipple,  instead of the prominence of the nipple there being a deep depression,  it becomes necessary to stop the secretion of the milk, or as it is  said in common parlance, \"to dry up the breasts.\" In former days, not  so very long ago, and the practice is still common enough to call  attention to it and to condemn it, the breasts used to be tightly  bandaged, or they used to be pumped every few hours. The first causes  unnecessary pain and trouble, while the second procedure, the pumping,  does exactly the reverse to what it is intended to do. Instead of  drying up the breasts it keeps up the secretion. The best thing to do  in a case like that is to leave the breasts alone, not to pump them,  but just gently support them with a bandage and then in three or four  days the secretion of the milk will gradually disappear. There is some  discomfort the first twenty-four or forty-eight hours, but if left  alone the discomfort is less than if the breasts are manipulated,  bandaged or pumped.    =Menstruation or Pregnancy While Nursing.= Many women do not  menstruate and do not become pregnant while they are nursing. Some  women will not conceive, no matter how long they may nurse the  child--a year or two or longer. And some women take advantage of this  fact, and in order to avoid another child they will keep up the  nursing as long as possible. In Egypt and other Oriental countries  where our means for the prevention of conception are unknown, it is no  rare sight to see a child three or four years old interrupting his  work or his play and running up to suckle his mother's breast. But not  all women have this good luck. Some women (about fifty per cent.)  begin to menstruate in the sixth month of lactation, while some become  pregnant even before they begin to menstruate. It only too often  happens that a woman considering lactation her safeguard omits to use  any precautions and finds herself, to her great discomfiture, in a  pregnant condition.    When a nursing woman discovers that she is pregnant she should give up  nursing at once. The milk is apt to become of poor quality, but even  where this is not the case, it is too much for a woman to feed one  child in the uterus and one at the breast.          CHAPTER SIXTEEN    ABORTION AND MISCARRIAGE     Definition of Word Abortion--Definition of Word Miscarriage--    Spontaneous Abortion--Induced Abortion--Therapeutic Abortion--    Criminal Abortion--Missed Abortion--Habitual Abortion--Syphilis    as Cause of Abortion and Miscarriage--Dangers of Abortion--    Abortion an Evil.      The word abortion, used somewhat loosely, signifies the premature  expulsion of the fetus; the expulsion of the fetus from the womb  before it is viable, i.e., before it is capable of living  independently. Used in a stricter sense, the word abortion is applied  to the expulsion of the fetus up to the end of the 16th week; to the  expulsion of the fetus between the 16th and the 28th week the term  miscarriage is applied; and when the expulsion of the fetus takes  place after the 28th week, but before full term, we use the term  premature labor. The laity does not like the term abortion, as it is  under the impression that the term always signifies criminal abortion;  it therefore prefers to use the term miscarriage (\"miss\"), regardless  of the time at which the expulsion of the fetus takes place.    When an abortion (or miscarriage) takes place by itself, without any  outside aid, we call it _spontaneous abortion_. When it is brought on  by artificial means, whether by the woman herself or by somebody else,  we call it _induced_ abortion. When an abortion is induced for the  purpose of saving the woman's life, we call it _therapeutic_ abortion;  this is considered perfectly legal and proper. But where an abortion  is induced merely to save an unmarried mother's reputation, or because  the married mother is too poor or too weak to have any more children,  or is reluctant to have any (or any more) for any other reason, it is  called _criminal_ or _illegal_ abortion, and, if discovered, subjects  the mother and the person who produced the abortion to severe  punishment.    When the fetus for some reason dies in its mother's womb, it is  generally expelled within a few hours or days. Sometimes this is not  the case, and the dead fetus is retained for several weeks, or months  or even years; to such a phenomenon we apply the term _missed_  abortion. Some women suffer from what might be called the abortion  habit; they can hardly ever carry a child to full term, but lose it in  the same month or even in the same week of gestation during each  pregnancy; we call this habitual abortion. And this habitual abortion  may be independent of disease, such, for instance, as syphilis. The  terms _threatened_, _imminent_ and _inevitable_ abortion require no  further explanation.    =The Causes of Abortion.= Outside of the abortion habit, which may be  due partly to heredity or be caused by a diseased condition of the  lining membrane of the uterus, the principal cause of abortion and  miscarriage is syphilis. And when a woman has had two or three or four  or more miscarriages in succession we generally assume the cause to be  syphilis, and in most cases the assumption will be correct.    When an abortion is performed by an experienced physician, with the  observance of the utmost cleanliness (asepsis and antisepsis), then  the abortion is accompanied with very little or no danger; but when  performed carelessly, by incompetent, non-conscientious physicians and  midwives, the operation is fraught with great danger to the patient's  health or to her very life. And abortion is a great cause of premature  death and chronic invalidism among women. And as long as the people  will remain ignorant of the proper means of regulating their  offspring, so long will abortion thrive.    While I recognize that there are cases in which the performance of an  abortion is perfectly justifiable from a moral standpoint, for  instance in cases of rape or where the mother is unmarried,  nevertheless abortion must be recognized as an evil, a necessary evil  now and then, but an evil, nevertheless. It is never to be undertaken  lightly, or to be considered in a frivolous spirit; and it is the duty  of all serious-minded and humanitarian men and women to do everything  in their power to remove those conditions which make abortion  necessary and unavoidable.          CHAPTER SEVENTEEN    PRENATAL CARE     Meaning of the Term--Misleading Information by Quasi-Scientists--    Exaggerated Ideas Regarding Prenatal Care--Nervous Connection    Between Mother and Child--Cases Under Author's Observation--Effects    on Offspring--Advice to Pregnant Women--Germ-plasm of Chronic    Alcoholic--A Glass of Wine and the Spermatozoa--False Statements--    Cases of Violence and Accidents During Pregnancy.      By prenatal care we understand the care taken during pregnancy before  the child is born. Used in a wider sense the term includes the care  which both parents should take of themselves even before the child is  conceived.    Of course the father and the mother should be in the best possible  physical and mental condition during the time of conception and even  before conception, and the mother should take the very best care of  herself--she"]]]
