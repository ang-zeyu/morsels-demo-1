[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2126"],[0,"The Quest of the Sacred Slipper (#15)"],[1," seemed to  glow with the soft light seen in the heart of a rose.  The thick  veil was raised now and all attempts at deception abandoned.  At  bay she faced me, this secret woman whom I knew to hold the key to  some of the darkest places which we sought to explore.    \"I live there,\" she said slowly.  \"What do you want with me?\"    \"I want to know,\" I replied, \"for whom are those provisions in  your basket?\"    She watched me fixedly.    \"And I want to know,\" I continued, \"something that only you can  tell me.  We have met before, madam, but you have always eluded me.  This time you shall not do so.  There's much I have to ask of you,  but particularly I want to know who killed the Hashishin who lies  dead at no great distance from here!\"    \"How can I tell you that?  Of what are you speaking?\"    Her voice was low and musical; that of a cultured woman.  She  evidently recognized the futility of further subterfuge in this  respect.    \"You know quite well of what I am speaking!  You know that you  can tell me if any one can!  The fact that you go disguised alone  condemns you!  Why should I remind you of our previous meetings--of  the links which bind you to the history of the Prophet's slipper?\"  She shuddered and closed her eyes.  \"Your present attitude is a  sufficient admission!\"    She stood silent before me, with something pitiful in her pose--a  wonderfully pretty woman, whose disarranged hair and dilapidated hat  could not mar her beauty; whose clumsy, ill-fitting garments could  not conceal her lithe grace.    Our altercation had not thus far served to arouse any of the  inhabitants and on that stuffy landing, beneath the flickering  gaslight, we stood alone, a group of two which epitomized strange  things.    Then, with that quietly dramatic note which marks real life entrances  and differentiates them from the loudly acclaimed episodes of the  stage, a third actor took up his cue.    \"Both hands, Mr. Cavanagh!\" directed an American voice.    Nerves atwitch, I started around in its direction.    From behind the slightly opened door of No. 48 protruded a steel  barrel, pointed accurately at my head!    I hesitated, glancing from the woman toward the open door.    \"Do it quick!\" continued the voice incisively.  \"You are up against  a desperate man, Mr. Cavanagh.  Raise your hands.  Carneta, relieve  Mr. Cavanagh of his gun!\"    Instantly the girl, with deft fingers, had obtained possession of  my revolver.    \"Step inside,\" said the crisp, strident voice.  Knowing myself  helpless and quite convinced that I was indeed in the clutches of  desperate people, I entered the doorway, the door being held open  from within.  She whom I had heard called Carneta followed.  The  door was reclosed; and I found myself in a perfectly bare and dim  passageway.  From behind me came the order--    \"Go right ahead!\"    Into a practically unfurnished room, lighted by one gas jet, I  walked.  Some coarse matting hung before the two windows and a  fairly large grip stood on the floor against one wall.  A gas-ring  was in the hearth, together with a few cheap cooking utensils.      I turned and faced the door.  First entered Carneta, carrying the  basket; then came a man with a revolver in his left hand and his  right arm strapped across his chest and swathed in bandages.  One  glance revealed the fact that his right hand had been severed--revealed  the fact, though I knew it already, that my captor was Earl Dexter.    He looked even leaner than when I had last seen him.  I had no doubt  that his ghastly wound had occasioned a tremendous loss of blood.  His gaunt face was positively emaciated, but the steely gray eyes  had lost nothing of their brightness.  There was a good deal about  Mr. Earl Dexter, the cracksman, that any man must have admired.    \"Shut the door, Carneta,\" he said quietly.  His companion closed  the door and Dexter sat down on the grip, regarding me with his  oddly humorous smile.    \"You're a visitor I did not expect, Mr. Cavanagh,\" he said.  \"I  expected someone worse.  You've interfered a bit with my plans but  I don't know that I can't rearrange things satisfactorily.  I don't  think I'll stop for supper, though--\"  He glanced at the girl, who  stood silent by the door.    \"Just pack up the provisions,\" he directed, nodding toward the  basket--\"in the next room.\"    She departed without a word.    \"That's a noticeable dust coat you're wearing, Mr. Cavanagh,\" said  the American; \"it gives me a great notion.  I'm afraid I'll have to  borrow it.\"    He glanced, smiling, at the revolver in his left hand and back again  to me.  There was nothing of the bully about him, nothing  melodramatic; but I took off the coat without demur and threw it  across to him.    \"It will hide this stump,\" he said grimly; \"and any of the Hashishin  gentlemen who may be on the look-out--though I rather fancy the  road is clear at the moment--will mistake me for you.  See the idea?  Carneta will be in a cab and I'll be in after her and away before  they've got time to so much as whistle.\"    Very awkwardly he got into the coat.    \"She's a clever girl, Carneta,\" he said.  \"She's doctored me all  along since those devils cut my hand off.\"    As he finished speaking Carneta returned.    She had discarded her rags and wore a large travelling coat and a  fashionable hat.    \"Ready?\" asked Dexter.  \"We'll make a rush for it.  We meant to go  to-night anyway.  It's getting too hot here!\"  He turned to me.    \"Sorry to say,\" he drawled, \"I'll have to tie you up and gag you.  Apologize; but it can't be helped.\"    Carneta nodded and went out of the room again, to return almost  immediately with a line that looked as though it might have been  employed for drying washing.    \"Hands behind you,\" rapped Dexter, toying with the revolver--\"and  think yourself lucky you've got two!\"    There was no mistaking the manner of man with whom I had to deal,  and I obeyed; but my mind was busy with a hundred projects.  Very  neatly the girl bound my wrists, and in response to a slight nod  from Dexter threw the end of the line up over a beam in the sloping  ceiling, for the room was right under the roof, and drew it up in  such a way that, my wrists being raised behind me, I became utterly  helpless.  It was an ingenious device indicating considerable  experience.    \"Just tie his handkerchief around his mouth,\" directed Dexter:  \"that will keep him quiet long enough for our purpose.  I hope you  will be released soon, Mr. Cavanagh,\" he added.  \"Greatly regret  the necessity.\"    Carneta bound the handkerchief over my mouth.    Dexter extinguished the gas.    \"Mr. Cavanagh,\" he said, \"I've gone through hell and I've lost the  most useful four fingers and a thumb in the United States to get  hold of the Prophet's slipper.  Any one can have it that's open to  pay for it--but I've got to retire on the deal, so I'll drive a  hard bargain!  Good-night!\"    There was a sound of retreating footsteps, and I heard the entrance  door close quietly.          CHAPTER XVIII    WHAT CAME THROUGH THE WINDOW      I had not been in my unnatural position for many minutes before I  began to suffer agonies, agonies not only physical but mental; for  standing there like some prisoner of the Inquisition, it came to me  how this dismantled apartment must be the focus of the dreadful  forces of Hassan of Aleppo!    That Earl Dexter had the slipper of the Prophet I no longer doubted,  and that he had sustained, in this dwelling beneath the roof, an  uncanny siege during the days which had passed since the theft from  the Antiquarian Museum, was equally certain.  Helpless, gagged, I  pictured those hideous creatures, evil products of the secret East,  who might, nay, who must surround that place!  I thought of the  horrible little yellow man who lay dead in Wyatt's Buildings; and  it became evident to me that the house in which I was now imprisoned  must overlook the back of those unsavoury tenements.  The windows,  sack-covered now, no doubt commanded a view of the roofs of the  buildings.  One of the mysteries that had puzzled us was solved.  It  was Earl Dexter who had shot the yellow dwarf as he was bound for  this very room!  But how humanly the Hashishin had proposed to gain  his goal, how he had travelled through empty space--for from empty  space the shot had brought him down--I could not imagine.    I knew something of the almost supernatural attributes of these  people.  From Professor Deeping's book I knew of the incredible  feats which they could perform when under the influence of the drug  hashish.  From personal experience also I knew that they had powers  wholly abnormal.    The pain in my arms and back momentarily increased.  An awesome  silence ruled.  I tortured myself with pictures of murderous  yellow men possessed of the power claimed by the Mahatmas, of  levitation.  Mentally I could see a distorted half-animal creature  carrying a great gleaming knife and floating supernaturally toward  me through the night!    A soft pattering sound became perceptible on the sloping roof above!    I think I have never known such intense and numbing fear as that  which now descended upon me.  Perhaps I may be forgiven it.  A more  dreadful situation it would be hard to devise.  Knowing that I was  on the fifth story of a house, bound, helpless, I knew, too, that a  second mystic guardian of the slipper was come to accomplish the  task in which the first had failed!    I began to pray fervently.    Neither of the windows were closed; and now through the intense  darkness I heard one of them being raised up--up--up...    The sacking was pulled aside inch by inch.    Silhouetted against the faintly luminous background I saw a hunched,  unnatural figure.  The real was more dreadful even than the  imaginary--for some stray beam of light touched into cold radiance  a huge curved knife which the visitant held between his teeth!    My fear became a madness, and I twisted "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21272"],[0,"The Bibliotaph, and Other People (#15)"],[1,"he should rise to the dignity of an English classic, this will be  spoken of as his third period, and critics will be wise in the  elucidation thereof. But just at present this third period is  characterized by the terms 'pessimistic' and 'unhealthy.'    That he is a pessimist in the colloquial sense admits of little  question. Nor is it surprising; it is rather difficult not to be. Not  a few persons are pessimists and won't tell. They preserve a fair  exterior, but secretly hold that all flesh is grass. Some people  escape the disease by virtue of much philosophy or much religion or  much work. Many who have not taken up permanent residence beneath the  roof of Schopenhauer or Von Hartmann are occasional guests. Then there  is that great mass of pessimism which is the result, not of thought,  but of mere discomfort, physical and super-physical. One may have  attacks of pessimism from a variety of small causes. A bad stomach  will produce it. Financial difficulties will produce it. The  light-minded get it from changes in the weather.    That note of melancholy which we detect in many of Hardy's novels is  as it should be. For no man can apprehend life aright and still look  upon it as a carnival. He may attain serenity in respect to it, but he  can never be jaunty and flippant. He can never slap life upon the back  and call it by familiar names. He may hold that the world is  indisputably growing better, but he will need to admit that the world  is having a hard time in so doing.    Hardy would be sure of a reputation for pessimism in some quarters if  only because of his attitude, or what people think is his attitude,  toward marriage. He has devoted many pages and not a little thought to  the problems of the relations between men and women. He is  considerably interested in questions of 'matrimonial divergence.' He  recognizes that most obvious of all obvious truths, that marriage is  not always a success; nay, more than this, that it is often a  makeshift, an apology, a pretense. But he professes to undertake  nothing beyond a statement of the facts. It rests with the public to  lay his statement beside their experience and observation, and thus  take measure of the fidelity of his art.    He notes the variety of motives by which people are actuated in the  choice of husbands and wives. In the novel called _The Woodlanders_,  Grace Melbury, the daughter of a rich though humbly-born yeoman, has  unusual opportunities for a girl of her class, and is educated to a  point of physical and intellectual daintiness which make her seem  superior to her home environment. Her father has hoped that she will  marry her rustic lover, Giles Winterbourne, who, by the way, is a man  in every fibre of his being. Grace is quite unspoiled by her life at a  fashionable boarding school, but after her return her father feels  (and Hardy makes the reader feel) that in marrying Giles she will  sacrifice herself. She marries Dr. Fitzspiers, a brilliant young  physician, recently come into the neighborhood, and in so doing she  chooses for the worse. The character of Dr. Fitzspiers is summarized  in a statement he once made (presumably to a male friend) that 'on one  occasion he had noticed himself to be possessed by five distinct  infatuations at the same time.'    His flagrant infidelities bring about a temporary separation; Grace is  not able to comprehend 'such double and treble-barreled hearts.' When  finally they are reunited the life-problem of each still awaits an  adequate solution. For the motive which brings the girl back to her  husband is only a more complex phase of the same motive which chiefly  prompted her to marry him. Hardy says that Fitzspiers as a lover acted  upon Grace 'like a dram.' His presence 'threw her into an atmosphere  which biased her doings until the influence was over.' Afterward she  felt 'something of the nature of regret for the mood she had  experienced.'    But this same story contains two other characters who are unmatched in  fiction as the incarnation of pure love and self-forgetfulness. Giles  Winterbourne, whose devotion to Grace is without wish for happiness  which shall not imply a greater happiness for her, dies that no breath  of suspicion may fall upon her. He in turn is loved by Marty South  with a completeness which destroys all thought of self. She enjoys no  measure of reward while Winterbourne lives. He never knows of Marty's  love. But in that last fine paragraph of this remarkable book, when  the poor girl places the flowers upon his grave she utters a little  lament which for beauty, pathos, and realistic simplicity is without  parallel in modern fiction. Hardy was never more of an artist than  when writing the last chapter of _The Woodlanders_.    After all, a book in which unselfish love is described in terms at  once just and noble cannot be dangerously pessimistic, even if it also  takes cognizance of such hopeless cases as a man with a chronic  tendency to fluctuations of the heart.    The matter may be put briefly thus: In Hardy's novels one sees the  artistic result of an effort to paint life as it is, with much of its  joy and a deal of its sorrow, with its good people and its selfish  people, its positive characters and its Laodiceans, its men and women  who dominate circumstances, and its unhappy ones who are submerged.  These books are the record of what a clear-eyed, sane, vigorous,  sympathetic, humorous man knows about life; a man too conscious of  things as they are to wish grossly to exaggerate or to disguise them;  and at the same time so entirely aware how much poetry as well as  irony God has mingled in the order of the world as to be incapable of  concealing that fact either. He is of such ample intellectual frame  that he makes the petty contentions of literary schools appear  foolish. I find a measure of Hardy's mind in passages which set forth  his conception of the preciousness of life, no matter what the form in  which life expresses itself. He is peculiarly tender toward brute  creation. In that paragraph which describes Tess discovering the  wounded pheasants in the wood, Hardy suggests the thought, quite new  to many people, that chivalry is not confined to the relations of man  to man or of man to woman. There are still weaker fellow-creatures in  Nature's teeming family. What if we are unmannerly or unchivalrous  toward them?    He abounds in all manner of pithy sayings, many of them wise, a few of  them profound, and not one which is unworthy a second reading. It is  to be hoped that he will escape the doubtful honor of being  dispersedly set forth in a 'Wit and Wisdom of Thomas Hardy.' Such  books are a depressing species of literature and seem chiefly designed  to be given away at holiday time to acquaintances who are too  important to be put off with Christmas cards, and not important enough  to be supplied with gifts of a calculable value.    One must praise the immense spirit and vivacity of scenes where  something in the nature of a struggle, a moral duel, goes on. In such  passages every power at the writer's command is needed; unerring  directness of thought, and words which clothe this thought as an  athlete's garments fit the body. Everything must count, and the  movement of the narrative must be sustained to the utmost. The  chess-playing scene between Elfride and Knight in _A Pair of Blue  Eyes_ is an illustration. Sergeant Troy displaying his skill in  handling the sword--weaving his spell about Bathsheba in true snake  fashion, is another example. Still more brilliant is the gambling  scene in _The Return of the Native_, where Wildeve and Diggory Venn,  out on the heath in the night, throw dice by the light of a lantern  for Thomasin's money. Venn, the reddleman, in the Mephistophelian garb  of his profession, is the incarnation of a good spirit, and wins the  guineas from the clutch of the spendthrift husband. The scene is  immensely dramatic, with its accompaniments of blackness and silence,  Wildeve's haggard face, the circle of ponies, known as heath-croppers,  which are attracted by the light, the death's-head moth which  extinguishes the candle, and the finish of the game by the light of  glow-worms. It is a glorious bit of writing in true bravura style.    His books have a quality which I shall venture to call 'spaciousness,'  in the hope that the word conveys the meaning I try to express. It is  obvious that there is a difference between books which are large and  books which are merely long. The one epithet refers to atmosphere, the  other to number of pages. Hardy writes large books. There is room in  them for the reader to expand his mind. They are distinctly  out-of-door books, 'not smacking of the cloister or the library.' In  reading them one has a feeling that the vault of heaven is very high,  and that the earth stretches away to interminable distances upon all  sides. This quality of largeness is not dependent upon number of  pages; nor is length absolute as applied to books. A book may contain  one hundred pages and still be ninety-nine pages too long, for the  reason that its truth, its lesson, its literary virtue, are not  greater than might be expressed in a single page.    Spaciousness is in even less degree dependent upon miles. The  narrowness, geographically speaking, of Hardy's range of expression is  notable. There is much contrast between him and Stevenson in this  respect. The Scotchman has embodied in his fine books the experiences  of life in a dozen different quarters of the globe. Hardy, with more  robust health, has traveled from Portland to Bath, and from  'Wintoncester' to 'Exonbury,'--journeys hardly more serious than from  the blue bed to the brown. And it is better thus. No reader of _The  Return of the Native_ would have been content that Eustacia Vye should  persuade her husband back to Paris. Rather than the boulevards one  prefers Egdon heath, as Hardy paints it, 'the great inviolate "]]]
