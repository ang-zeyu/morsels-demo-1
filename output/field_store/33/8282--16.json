The rabbit shares with all mammals, and differs from all  other vertebrata (i.e., birds, reptiles, amphibia, and fishes), in having--       (a) Hair.       (b) A diaphragm.       (c) Only one aortic arch, and that on the left side of the body.       (d) Its young born alive. (But two very reptile-like mammals of     Australia, the duck-billed platypus and the echidna, lay eggs, and     certain fish and reptiles bear living young.)       (e) Epiphyses to its vertebral -centre- [centra].*       (f) The cerebral hemispheres covering the mid-brain.       (g) Corpora quadrigemina instead of bigemina.       [(h) A corpus callosum.]       [(i) A spirally coiled cochlea to the internal ear.]       [(In respect to h and i also, the echidna and platypus are scarcely     mammalinan.)]       * But certain mammals have no such epiphyses.      Section 149. The rabbit, together with the hares and conies, rats and  mice, voles, squirrels, beavers, cavies, guineapigs is included in that  order of the class of mammals which is called the rodentia, and is  distinguished by the character of the incisor teeth from other orders of  the class.        10. _Questions and Exercises_    1.

We will now study the adult anatomy of the frog, and  throughout we shall make constant comparisons with that of the  rabbit. In the rabbit we have a distinctly land-loving, burrowing animal;  it eats purely vegetable food, and drinks but little. In the frog we have  a mainly insectivorous type, living much in the water. This involves the  moister skin, the shorter alimentary canal, and the abbreviated neck  (Rabbit, Section 2) of the frog; the tail is absent-- in a fish it would do  the work the frog accomplishes with his hind legs-- and the apertures  which are posterior in the rabbit, run together into one dorsal opening,  the cloaca. There is, of course (Rabbit, Section 4), no hair the skin is  smooth, and an external ear is also absent. The remarkable  looseness of the frog's skin is due to great lymph spaces between it  and the body wall.      Section 2. If we now compare the general anatomy of the frog (vide  Sheet 11) with that of the rabbit, we notice that the diaphragm is  absent (Rabbit, Section 4), and the body cavity, or coelom, is, with  the exception of the small bag of the pericardium round the heart, one  continuous space. The forked tongue is attached in front of the lower  jaw, and can be flicked out and back with great rapidity in the capture  of the small insects upon which the frog lives. The posterior nares  open into the front of the mouth-- there is no long nasal chamber, and  no palate, and there is no long trachea between the epiglottis and the  lungs. The oesophagus is less distinct, and passes gradually, so far  as external appearances go, into the bag-like stomach, which is  much less inflated and transverse than that of the rabbit. The  duodenum is not a U-shaped loop, but makes one together with the  stomach; the pancreas lies between it and the stomach, and is more  compact than the rabbit's. There is no separate pancreatic duct, but  the bile duct runs through the pancreas, and receives a series of  ducts from that gland as it does so. The ileum is shorter, there is no  sacculus rotundus, and the large intestine has no caecum, none of  the characteristic sacculations of the rabbit's colon, and does not loop  back to the stomach before the rectum section commences. The  anus opens not upon the exterior, but into a cloacal chamber. The  urinary and genital ducts open separately into this cloaca, and  dorsally and posteriorly to the anus. The so-called urinary bladder is  ventral to the intestine, in a position answering to that of the rabbit,  but it has no connection with the ureters, and it is two-horned.      Section 3. The spleen is a small, round body, not so intimately  bound to the stomach as in the rabbit, but in essentially the same  position.      Section 4. Much that we knew of the physiology of the frog is arrived  at mainly by inferences from our mammalian knowledge. Its histology  is essentially similar. Ciliated epithelium is commoner and occurs  more abundantly than in the rabbit, in the roof of the mouth for  instance, and its red blood corpuscles are much larger, oval, and  nucleated.      Section 5. The lungs of the frog are bag-like; shelves and spongy  partitions project into their cavities, but this structure is much simpler  than that of the rabbit's lung, in which the branching bronchi, the  imperfect cartilaginous rings supporting them, alveoli, arteries and  veins, form together a quasi-solid mass.      Section 6. The mechanism of respiration is fundamentally different  from that of the mammal. The method is as follows:-- The frog opens  its anterior nares, and depresses the floor of the mouth, which  therefore fills with air. The anterior nares are then closed, and the floor  mouth rises and forces the air into the lungs-- the frog, therefore,  swallows its air rather than inhales it.
