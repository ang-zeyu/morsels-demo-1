If a dog be taught to perform  certain feats, the young of that dog will be much easier initiated in  the same feats than other dogs. Thus, the existing races of English  pointers are greatly more accomplished in their required duties than  the original race of Spanish pointers. Dogs of the St. Bernard variety  inherit the faculty of tracking footsteps in the snow. A gentleman of  our acquaintance, and of scientific acquirements, obtained some years  ago a pup, which had been produced in London by a female of the  celebrated St. Bernard breed. The young animal was brought to  Scotland, where it was never observed to give any particular tokens of  a power of tracking footsteps until winter, when the ground became  covered with snow. It _then_ showed the most active inclination to  follow footsteps; and so great was its power of doing so under these  circumstances, that, when its master had crossed a field in the most  curvilinear way, and caused other persons to cross his path in all  directions, it nevertheless followed his course with the greatest  precision. Here was a perfect revival of the habit of its Alpine  fathers, with a degree of specialty as to external conditions at  which, it seems to us, we cannot sufficiently wonder.    Such are some of the qualities of dogs in a state of domestication,  and let me hope that the anecdotes related of them will tend to insure  for them that love and gratitude to which their own fine disposition  and noble character give them a claim from us.    It is pleasing to observe that men of the highest acquirements and  most elevated minds have bestowed their sincere attachment upon their  favourite canine companions; for kindness to animals is, perhaps, as  strong an indication of the possession of generous sentiments as any  that can be adduced. The late Lord Grenville, a distinguished  statesman, an elegant scholar, and an amiable man, affords an  illustration of the opinion: It is thus that he eloquently makes his  favourite Zephyr speak:--        \"Captum oculis, senioque hebetem, morboque gravatum,        Dulcis here, antiquo me quod amore foves,      Suave habet et carum Zephyrus tuus, et leviore        Se sentit mortis conditione premi.      Interiere quidem, tibi quae placuisse solebant,        Et formae dotes, et facile ingenium:      Deficiunt sensus, tremulae scintillula vitae        Vix micat, in cinerem mox abitura brevem.      Sola manet, vetuli tibi nec despecta ministri,        Mens grata, ipsaque in morte memor domini.      Hanc tu igitur, pro blanditiis mollique lepore,        Et prompta ad nutus sedulitate tuos,      Pro saltu cursuque levi, lusuque protervo,        Hanc nostri extremum pignus amoris habe.      Jamque vale! Elysii subeo loca laeta, piorum        Quae dat Persephone manibus esse canum.\"    In the previous pages I have endeavoured to give my readers some idea  of the general character of the dog, and I will now proceed to  illustrate it more fully by anecdotes peculiar to different breeds.  These animals will then be found to deserve the encomiums bestowed  upon them by Buffon, \"as possessing such an ardour of sentiment, with  fidelity and constancy in their affection, that neither ambition,  interest, nor desire of revenge, can corrupt them, and that they have  no fear but that of displeasing. They are, in fact, all zeal, ardour,  and obedience. More inclined to remember benefits than injuries; more  docile and tractable than any other animal, the dog is not only  instructed, but conforms himself to the manners, movements, and habits  of those who govern him. He is always eager to obey his master, and  will defend his property at the risk of his own life.\" Pope says, that  history is more full of examples of fidelity in the dog than in  friends; and Lord Byron characterises him as--                            \"in life the firmest friend,      The first to welcome, foremost to defend;      Whose honest heart is still his master's own;      Who labours, fights, lives, breathes for him alone;\"    and truly indeed may he be called        \"The rich man's guardian, and the poor man's friend.\"    [Illustration]          [Illustration: DEER-HOUNDS.]        \"His bulk and beauty speak no vulgar praise.           *          *          *          *        Oh had you seen him, vigorous, bold, and young,      Swift as a stag, and as a lion strong;      Him no fell savage in the plain withstood,      None 'scap'd him, bosomed in the gloomy wood;      His eye how piercing!\"                                                POPE.    THE IRISH AND HIGHLAND WOLF-DOG.      A certain degree of romance will always be attached to the history of  the Irish wolf-dog, but so contradictory are the accounts handed down  to us respecting it, that, with every disposition to do justice to  the character of this noble animal, the task is one of no small  difficulty.    This dog seems to have flourished, and to have become nearly extinct,  with the ancient kings of Ireland, and, with the harp and shamrock, is  regarded as one of the national emblems of that country. When princely  hospitality was to be found in the old palaces, castles, and baronial  halls of fair Erin, it is hardly possible to imagine anything more  aristocratic and imposing than the aspect of these dogs, while  attending the banquets of their masters. So great, indeed, was their  height, that it has been affirmed, that when their chieftain was  seated at table these dogs could rest their heads on his shoulders.  However this may have been, it is certain that the bold, majestic, and  commanding appearance of the animal, joined to the mild and softened  look with which he regarded those to whom he was attached, and whom he  was always ready to defend, must have rendered him worthy of the  enthusiasm with which the remembrance of him is still cherished by the  warm-hearted people of Ireland.    The following anecdote, which has been communicated to me by an  amiable Irish nobleman, will at all events serve to show the peculiar  instinct which the Irish wolf-dog was supposed to possess.    A gentleman of an ancient family, whose name it is unnecessary to  mention, from his having been engaged in the troubles which agitated  Ireland about fifty or sixty years since, went into a coffee-room at  Dublin during that period, accompanied by a noble wolf-dog, supposed  to be one of the last of the breed. There was only one other gentleman  in the coffee-room, who, on seeing the dog, went up to him, and began  to notice him. His owner, in considerable alarm, begged him to desist,  as the dog was fierce, and would never allow a stranger to touch him.  The gentleman resumed his seat, when the dog came to him, showed the  greatest pleasure at being noticed, and allowed himself to be fondled.  His owner could not disguise his astonishment. \"You are the only  person,\" he said, \"whom that dog would ever allow to touch him without  showing resentment. May I beg of you the favour to tell me your  name?\"--mentioning his own at the same time. The stranger announced  it, (he was the last of his race, one of the most ancient and noble in  Ireland, and descended from one of its kings.) \"I do not wonder,\" said  the owner of the dog, \"at the homage this animal has paid to you. He  recognizes in you the descendant of one of our most ancient race of  gentlemen to whom this breed of dogs almost exclusively belonged, and  the peculiar instinct he possesses has now been shown in a manner  which cannot be mistaken by me, who am so well acquainted with the  ferocity this dog has hitherto shown to all strangers.\"    Few persons, Sir Walter Scott excepted, would perhaps be inclined to  give credit to this anecdote. So convinced was he of the extraordinary  instinct exhibited by dogs generally, that he has been heard to  declare that he would believe anything of a dog. The anecdote,  however, above related, was communicated to me with the strongest  assurance of its strict accuracy.    In a poem, written by Mrs. Catherine Philips, about the year 1660, the  character of the Irish wolf-hound is well portrayed, and proves the  estimation in which he was held at that period.         \"Behold this creature's form and state!        Him Nature surely did create,        That to the world might be exprest        What mien there can be in a beast;        More nobleness of form and mind        Than in the lion we can find:        Yea, this heroic beast doth seem        In majesty to rival him.          Yet he vouchsafes to man to show        His service, and submission too--        And here we a distinction have;        That brute is fierce--the dog is brave.          He hath himself so well subdued,        That hunger cannot make him rude;        And all his manners do confess        That courage dwells with gentleness.          War with the wolf he loves to wage,        And never quits if he engage;        But praise him much, and you may chance        To put him out of countenance.        And having done a deed so brave,        He looks not sullen, yet looks grave.          No fondling play-fellow is he;        His master's guard he wills to be:        Willing for him his blood be spent,        His look is never insolent.      Few men to do such noble deeds have learn'd,      Nor having done, could look so unconcern'd.\"    This is one of the finest descriptions of a noble dog which I have yet  met with in English poetry. Courage and modesty are well portrayed,  and contrasted.    The following anecdotes relate to an animal which must have strongly  resembled the Irish wolf-dog:--    Plutarch mentions a certain Roman in the civil wars, whose head nobody  durst cut off for fear of the dog that guarded his body, and fought in  his defence. The same author relates that King Pyrrhus, in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26556"],[0,"Myths and Marvels of Astronomy (#15)"],[1,"at that time fed his flocks about the place.'  'After Chephren, Mycerinus, son of Cheops, ascended the throne, he  reopened the temples, and allowed the people to resume the practice of  sacrifice. He, too, left a pyramid, but much inferior in size to his  father's. It is built, for half of its height, of the stone of  Ethiopia,' or, as Professor Smyth (whose extracts from Rawlinson's  translation I have here followed) adds 'expensive red granite.' 'After  Mycerinus, Asychis ascended the throne. He built the eastern gateway of  the Temple of Vulcan (Phtha); and, being desirous of eclipsing all his  predecessors on the throne, left as a monument of his reign a pyramid of  brick.'    This account is so suggestive, as will presently be shown, that it may  be well to inquire whether it can be relied on. Now, although there can  be no doubt that Herodotus misunderstood the Egyptians in some matters,  and in particular as to the chronological order of the dynasties,  placing the pyramid kings far too late, yet in other respects he seems  not only to have understood them correctly, but also to have received a  correct account from them. The order of the kings above named  corresponds with the sequence given by Manetho, and also found in  monumental and hieroglyphic records. Manetho gives the names Suphis I.,  Suphis II., and Mencheres, instead of Cheops, Chephren, and Mycerinus;  while, according to the modern Egyptologists, Herodotus's Cheops was  Shofo, Shufu, or Koufou; Chephren was Shafre, while he was also called  Nou-Shofo or Noum-Shufu as the brother of Shofo; and Mycerinus was  Menhere or Menkerre. But the identity of these kings is not questioned.  As to the true dates there is much doubt, and it is probable that the  question will long continue open; but the determination of the exact  epochs when the several pyramids were built is not very important in  connection with our present inquiry. We may, on the whole, fairly take  the points quoted above from Herodotus, and proceed to consider the  significance of the narrative, with sufficient confidence that in all  essential respects it is trustworthy.    There are several very strange features in the account.    In the first place, it is manifest that Cheops (to call the first king  by the name most familiar to the general reader) attached great  importance to the building of his pyramid. It has been said, and perhaps  justly, that it would be more interesting to know the plan of the  architect who devised the pyramid than the purpose of the king who built  it. But the two things are closely connected. The architect must have  satisfied the king that some highly important purpose in which the king  himself was interested, would be subserved by the structure. Whether the  king was persuaded to undertake the work as a matter of duty, or only to  advance his own interests, may not be so clear. But that the king was  most thoroughly in earnest about the work is certain. A monarch in those  times would assuredly not have devoted an enormous amount of labour and  material to such a scheme unless he was thoroughly convinced of its  great importance. That the welfare of his people was not considered by  Cheops in building the Great Pyramid is almost equally certain. He  might, indeed, have had a scheme for their good which either he did not  care to explain to them or which they could not understand. But the most  natural inference from the narrative is that his purpose had no  reference whatever to their welfare. For though one could understand his  own subjects hating him while he was all the time working for their  good, it is obvious that his memory would not have been hated if some  important good had eventually been gained from his scheme. Many a  far-seeing ruler has been hated while living on account of the very work  for which his memory has been revered. But the memory of Cheops and his  successors was held in detestation.    May we, however, suppose that, though Cheops had not the welfare of his  own people in his thoughts, his purpose was nevertheless not selfish,  but intended in some way to promote the welfare of the human race? I say  his purpose, because, whoever originated the scheme, Cheops carried it  out; it was by means of his wealth and through his power that the  pyramid was built. This is the view adopted by Professor Piazzi Smyth  and others, in our own time, and first suggested by John Taylor.  'Whereas other writers,' says Smyth, 'have generally esteemed that the  mysterious persons who directed the building of the Great Pyramid (and  to whom the Egyptians, in their traditions, and for ages afterwards,  gave an immoral and even abominable character) must therefore have been  very bad indeed, so that the world at large has always been fond of  standing on, kicking, and insulting that dead lion, whom they really  knew not; he, Mr. John Taylor, seeing how religiously bad the Egyptians  themselves were, was led to conclude, on the contrary, that those _they_  hated (and could never sufficiently abuse) might, perhaps, have been  pre-eminently good; or were, at all events, of _different religious  faith_ from themselves.' 'Combining this with certain unmistakable  historical facts,' Mr. Taylor deduced reasons for believing that the  directors of the building designed to record in its proportions, and in  its interior features, certain important religious and scientific  truths, not for the people then living, but for men who were to come  4000 years or so after.    I have already considered at length (see the preceding Essay) the  evidence on which this strange theory rests. But there are certain  matters connecting it with the above narrative which must here be  noticed. The mention of the shepherd Philition, who fed his flocks about  the place where the Great Pyramid was built, is a singular feature of  Herodotus's narrative. It reads like some strange misinterpretation of  the story related to him by the Egyptian priests. It is obvious that if  the word Philition did not represent a people, but a person, this  person must have been very eminent and distinguished--a shepherd-king,  not a mere shepherd. Rawlinson, in a note on this portion of the  narrative of Herodotus, suggests that Philitis was probably a  shepherd-prince from Palestine, perhaps of Philistine descent, 'but so  powerful and domineering, that it may be traditions of his oppressions  in that earlier age which, mixed up afterwards in the minds of later  Egyptians with the evils inflicted on their country by the subsequent  shepherds of better known dynasties, lent so much fear to their  religious hate of Shepherd times and that name.' Smyth, somewhat  modifying this view, and considering certain remarks of Manetho  respecting an alleged invasion of Egypt by shepherd-kings, 'men of an  ignoble race (from the Egyptian point of view) who had the confidence to  invade our country, and easily subdued it to their power without a  battle,' comes to the conclusion that some Shemite prince, 'a  contemporary of, but rather older than, the Patriarch Abraham,' visited  Egypt at this time, and obtained such influence over the mind of Cheops  as to persuade him to erect the pyramid. According to Smyth, the prince  was no other than Melchizedek, king of Salem, and the influence he  exerted was supernatural. With such developments of the theory we need  not trouble ourselves. It seems tolerably clear that certain  shepherd-chiefs who came to Egypt during Cheops' reign were connected in  some way with the designing of the Great Pyramid. It is clear also that  they were men of a different religion from the Egyptians, and persuaded  Cheops to abandon the religion of his people. Taylor, Smyth, and the  Pyramidalists generally, consider this sufficient to prove that the  pyramid was erected for some purpose connected with religion. 'The  pyramid,' in fine, says Smyth, 'was charged by God's inspired  shepherd-prince, in the beginning of human time, to keep a certain  message secret and inviolable for 4000 years, and it has done so; and in  the next thousand years it was to enunciate that message to all men,  with more than traditional force, more than all the authenticity of  copied manuscripts or reputed history; and that part of the pyramid's  usefulness is now beginning.'    There are many very obvious difficulties surrounding this theory; as,  for example (i.) the absurd waste of power in setting supernatural  machinery at work 4000 years ago with cumbrous devices to record its  object, when the same machinery, much more simply employed now, would  effect the alleged purpose far more thoroughly; (ii.) the enormous  amount of human misery and its attendant hatreds brought about by this  alleged divine scheme; and (iii.) the futility of an arrangement by  which the pyramid was only to subserve its purpose when it had lost that  perfection of shape on which its entire significance depended, according  to the theory itself. But, apart from these, there is a difficulty,  nowhere noticed by Smyth or his followers, which is fatal, I conceive,  to this theory of the pyramid's purpose. The second pyramid, though  slightly inferior to the first in size, and probably far inferior in  quality of masonry, is still a structure of enormous dimensions, which  must have required many years of labour from tens of thousands of  workmen. Now, it seems impossible to explain why Chephren built this  second pyramid, if we adopt Smyth's theory respecting the first pyramid.  For either Chephren knew the purpose for which the Great Pyramid was  built, or he did not know it. If he knew that purpose, and it was that  indicated by Smyth, then he also knew that no second pyramid was wanted.  On that hypothesis, all the labour bestowed on the second pyramid was  wittingly and wilfully wasted. This, of course is incredible. But, on  the other hand, if Chephren did not know what was the purpose for which  the Great Pyramid"]]]
