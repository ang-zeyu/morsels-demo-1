At the same time, an actual divine Maker is  sometimes postulated. The stories, again, are fashioned in accordance  with the beliefs already named: the belief in human connection with and  kinship with beasts and plants; the belief in magic; the belief in the  perpetual possibility of metamorphosis or \"shape shifting\"; the belief  in the permanence and power of the ghosts of the dead; the belief in the  personal and animated character of all the things in the world, and so  forth.    No more need be said to explain the wild and (as it seems to us moderns)  the irrational character of savage myth. It is a jungle of foolish  fancies, a walpurgis nacht of gods and beasts and men and stars and  ghosts, all moving madly on a level of common personality and animation,  and all changing shapes at random, as partners are changed in some  fantastic witches' revel. Such is savage mythology, and how could it  be otherwise when we consider the elements of thought and belief out of  which it is mainly composed? We shall see that part of the mythology of  the Greeks or the Aryans of India is but a similar walpurgis nacht, in  which an incestuous or amorous god may become a beast, and the object  of his pursuit, once a woman, may also become a beast, and then shift  shapes to a tree or a bird or a star. But in the civilised races the  genius of the people tends to suppress, exclude and refine away the wild  element, which, however, is never wholly eliminated. The Erinyes soon  stop the mouth of the horse of Achilles when he begins, like the horse  in Grimm's Goose Girl, to hold a sustained conversation.(1) But the  ancient, cruel, and grotesque savage element, nearly overcome by Homer  and greatly reduced by the Vedic poets, breaks out again in Hesiod, in  temple legends and Brahmanic glosses, and finally proves so strong that  it can only be subdued by Christianity, or rather by that break between  the educated classes and the traditional past of religion which has  resulted from Christianity. Even so, myth lingers in the folk-lore of  the non-progressive classes of Europe, and, as in Roumania, invades  religion.      (1) Iliad, xix. 418.      We have now to demonstrate the existence in the savage intellect of  the various ideas and habits which we have described, and out of which  mythology springs. First, we have to show that \"a nebulous and confused  state of mind, to which all things, animate or inanimate, human, animal,  vegetable or inorganic, seem on the same level of life, passion and  reason,\" does really exist.(1) The existence of this condition of the  intellect will be demonstrated first on the evidence of the statements  of civilised observers, next on the evidence of the savage institutions  in which it is embodied.      (1) Creuzer and Guigniaut, vol. i. p. 111.      The opinion of Mr. Tylor is naturally of great value, as it is formed  on as wide an acquaintance with the views of the lower races as any  inquirers can hope to possess. Mr. Tylor observes: \"We have to inform  ourselves of the savage man's idea, which is very different from the  civilised man's, of the nature of the lower animals.... The sense of an  absolute psychical distinction between man and beast, so prevalent in  the civilised world, is hardly to be found among the lower races.\"(1)  The universal attribution of \"souls\" to all things--the theory known as  \"Animism\"--is another proof that the savage draws no hard and fast line  between man and the other things in the world. The notion of the Italian  country-people, that cruelty to an animal does not matter because it is  not a \"Christian,\" has no parallel in the philosophy of the savage,  to whom all objects seem to have souls, just as men have. Mr. Im Thurn  found the absence of any sense of a difference between man and nature  a characteristic of his native companions in Guiana. \"The very phrase,  'Men and other animals,' or even, as it is often expressed, 'Men and  animals,' based as it is on the superiority which civilised man feels  over other animals, expresses a dichotomy which is in no way recognised  by the Indian.... It is therefore most important to realise how  comparatively small really is the difference between men in a state of  savagery and other animals, and how completely even such difference as  exists escapes the notice of savage men... It is not, therefore, too  much to say that, according to the view of the Indians, other animals  differ from men only in bodily form and in their various degrees of  strength; in spirit they do not differ at all.\"(2) The Indian's notion  of the life of plants and stones is on the same level of unreason, as we  moderns reckon reason. He believes in the spirits of rocks and stones,  undeterred by the absence of motion in these objects. \"Not only many  rocks, but also many waterfalls, streams, and indeed material objects of  every sort, are supposed each to consist of a body and a spirit, as does  man.\"(3) It is not our business to ask here how men came by the belief  in universal animation. That belief is gradually withdrawn, distinctions  are gradually introduced, as civilisation and knowledge advance. It is  enough for us if the failure to draw a hard and fast line between man  and beasts, stones and plants, be practically universal among  savages, and if it gradually disappears before the fuller knowledge of  civilisation. The report which Mr. Im Thurn brings from the Indians of  Guiana is confirmed by what Schoolcraft says of the Algonkin races of  the northern part of the continent. \"The belief of the narrators and  listeners in every wild and improbable thing told helps wonderfully in  the original stories, in joining all parts together. The Indian believes  that the whole visible and invisible creation is animated.... To make  the matter worse, these tribes believe that animals of the lowest as  well as highest class in the chain of creation are alike endowed with  reasoning powers and faculties. As a natural conclusion they endow  birds, beasts and all other animals with souls.\"(4) As an example of the  ease with which the savage recognises consciousness and voluntary  motion even in stones, may be cited Kohl's account of the beliefs of the  Objibeways.(5) Nearly every Indian has discovered, he says, an object  in which he places special confidence, and to which he sacrifices more  zealously than to the Great Spirit. The \"hope\" of Otamigan (a companion  of the traveller) was a rock, which once advanced to meet him, swayed,  bowed and went back again. Another Indian revered a Canadian larch,  \"because he once heard a very remarkable rustling in its branches\".  It thus appears that while the savage has a general kind of sense that  inanimate things are animated, he is a good deal impressed by their  conduct when he thinks that they actually display their animation. In  the same way a devout modern spiritualist probably regards with more  reverence a table which he has seen dancing and heard rapping than a  table at which he has only dined. Another general statement of failure  to draw the line between men and the irrational creation is found in  the old Jesuit missionary Le Jeune's Relations de la Nouvelle France.(6)  \"Les sauvages se persuadent que non seulement les hommes et les autres  animaux, mais aussi que toutes les autres choses sont animees.\" Again:  \"Ils tiennent les poissons raisonnables, comme aussi les cerfs\". In the  Solomon Islands, Mr. Romilly sailed with an old chief who used violent  language to the waves when they threatened to dash over the boat, and  \"old Takki's exhortations were successful\".(7) Waitz(8) discovers the  same attitude towards the animals among the negroes. Man, in their  opinion, is by no means a separate sort of person on the summit of  nature and high above the beasts; these he rather regards as dark and  enigmatic beings, whose life is full of mystery, and which he therefore  considers now as his inferiors, now as his superiors. A collection of  evidence as to the savage failure to discriminate between human and  non-human, animate and inanimate, has been brought together by Sir John  Lubbock.(9)      (1) Primitive Culture, i. 167-169.

(9) Origin of Civilisation, p. 33. A number of examples of this mental  attitude among the Bushmen will be found in chap. v., postea.      To a race accustomed like ourselves to arrange and classify, to people  familiar from childhood and its games with \"vegetable, animal and  mineral,\" a condition of mind in which no such distinctions are drawn,  any more than they are drawn in Greek or Brahmanic myths, must  naturally seem like what Mr. Max Muller calls \"temporary insanity\".  The imagination of the savage has been defined by Mr. Tylor as \"midway  between the conditions of a healthy, prosaic, modern citizen, and of a  raving fanatic, or of a patient in a fever-ward\". If any relics of  such imagination survive in civilised mythology, they will very closely  resemble the productions of a once universal \"temporary insanity\". Let  it be granted, then, that \"to the lower tribes of man, sun and stars,  trees and rivers, winds and clouds, become personal, animate creatures,  leading lives conformed to human or animal analogies, and performing  their special functions in the universe with the aid of limbs like  beasts, or of artificial"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2833"],[0,"The Portrait of a Lady — Volume 1 (#15)"],[1,"and abide. She had a friend whose  acquaintance she had made shortly before her father's death, who offered  so high an example of useful activity that Isabel always thought of her  as a model. Henrietta Stackpole had the advantage of an admired ability;  she was thoroughly launched in journalism, and her letters to the  Interviewer, from Washington, Newport, the White Mountains and other  places, were universally quoted. Isabel pronounced them with confidence  \"ephemeral,\" but she esteemed the courage, energy and good-humour of the  writer, who, without parents and without property, had adopted three  of the children of an infirm and widowed sister and was paying their  school-bills out of the proceeds of her literary labour. Henrietta was  in the van of progress and had clear-cut views on most subjects; her  cherished desire had long been to come to Europe and write a series of  letters to the Interviewer from the radical point of view--an enterprise  the less difficult as she knew perfectly in advance what her opinions  would be and to how many objections most European institutions lay  open. When she heard that Isabel was coming she wished to start at once;  thinking, naturally, that it would be delightful the two should travel  together. She had been obliged, however, to postpone this enterprise.  She thought Isabel a glorious creature, and had spoken of her covertly  in some of her letters, though she never mentioned the fact to her  friend, who would not have taken pleasure in it and was not a regular  student of the Interviewer. Henrietta, for Isabel, was chiefly a proof  that a woman might suffice to herself and be happy. Her resources were  of the obvious kind; but even if one had not the journalistic talent and  a genius for guessing, as Henrietta said, what the public was going to  want, one was not therefore to conclude that one had no vocation,  no beneficent aptitude of any sort, and resign one's self to being  frivolous and hollow. Isabel was stoutly determined not to be hollow. If  one should wait with the right patience one would find some happy work  to one's hand. Of course, among her theories, this young lady was not  without a collection of views on the subject of marriage. The first on  the list was a conviction of the vulgarity of thinking too much of it.  From lapsing into eagerness on this point she earnestly prayed she might  be delivered; she held that a woman ought to be able to live to herself,  in the absence of exceptional flimsiness, and that it was perfectly  possible to be happy without the society of a more or less coarse-minded  person of another sex. The girl's prayer was very sufficiently answered;  something pure and proud that there was in her--something cold and dry  an unappreciated suitor with a taste for analysis might have called  it--had hitherto kept her from any great vanity of conjecture on the  article of possible husbands. Few of the men she saw seemed worth a  ruinous expenditure, and it made her smile to think that one of them  should present himself as an incentive to hope and a reward of patience.  Deep in her soul--it was the deepest thing there--lay a belief that if  a certain light should dawn she could give herself completely; but  this image, on the whole, was too formidable to be attractive. Isabel's  thoughts hovered about it, but they seldom rested on it long; after a  little it ended in alarms. It often seemed to her that she thought too  much about herself; you could have made her colour, any day in the  year, by calling her a rank egoist. She was always planning out her  development, desiring her perfection, observing her progress. Her nature  had, in her conceit, a certain garden-like quality, a suggestion of  perfume and murmuring boughs, of shady bowers and lengthening vistas,  which made her feel that introspection was, after all, an exercise  in the open air, and that a visit to the recesses of one's spirit was  harmless when one returned from it with a lapful of roses. But she was  often reminded that there were other gardens in the world than those of  her remarkable soul, and that there were moreover a great many places  which were not gardens at all--only dusky pestiferous tracts, planted  thick with ugliness and misery. In the current of that repaid curiosity  on which she had lately been floating, which had conveyed her to this  beautiful old England and might carry her much further still, she often  checked herself with the thought of the thousands of people who were  less happy than herself--a thought which for the moment made her fine,  full consciousness appear a kind of immodesty. What should one do with  the misery of the world in a scheme of the agreeable for one's self? It  must be confessed that this question never held her long. She was too  young, too impatient to live, too unacquainted with pain. She always  returned to her theory that a young woman whom after all every one  thought clever should begin by getting a general impression of life.  This impression was necessary to prevent mistakes, and after it should  be secured she might make the unfortunate condition of others a subject  of special attention.    England was a revelation to her, and she found herself as diverted as a  child at a pantomime. In her infantine excursions to Europe she had  seen only the Continent, and seen it from the nursery window; Paris, not  London, was her father's Mecca, and into many of his interests there his  children had naturally not entered. The images of that time moreover had  grown faint and remote, and the old-world quality in everything that  she now saw had all the charm of strangeness. Her uncle's house seemed a  picture made real; no refinement of the agreeable was lost upon  Isabel; the rich perfection of Gardencourt at once revealed a world and  gratified a need. The large, low rooms, with brown ceilings and dusky  corners, the deep embrasures and curious casements, the quiet light on  dark, polished panels, the deep greenness outside, that seemed always  peeping in, the sense of well-ordered privacy in the centre of a  \"property\"--a place where sounds were felicitously accidental, where  the tread was muffed by the earth itself and in the thick mild air all  friction dropped out of contact and all shrillness out of talk--these  things were much to the taste of our young lady, whose taste played a  considerable part in her emotions. She formed a fast friendship with her  uncle, and often sat by his chair when he had had it moved out to the  lawn. He passed hours in the open air, sitting with folded hands like  a placid, homely household god, a god of service, who had done his work  and received his wages and was trying to grow used to weeks and months  made up only of off-days. Isabel amused him more than she suspected--the  effect she produced upon people was often different from what she  supposed--and he frequently gave himself the pleasure of making her  chatter. It was by this term that he qualified her conversation, which  had much of the \"point\" observable in that of the young ladies of her  country, to whom the ear of the world is more directly presented than to  their sisters in other lands. Like the mass of American girls Isabel had  been encouraged to express herself; her remarks had been attended  to; she had been expected to have emotions and opinions. Many of her  opinions had doubtless but a slender value, many of her emotions passed  away in the utterance; but they had left a trace in giving her the habit  of seeming at least to feel and think, and in imparting moreover to  her words when she was really moved that prompt vividness which so many  people had regarded as a sign of superiority. Mr. Touchett used to think  that she reminded him of his wife when his wife was in her teens. It was  because she was fresh and natural and quick to understand, to speak--so  many characteristics of her niece--that he had fallen in love with Mrs.  Touchett. He never expressed this analogy to the girl herself, however;  for if Mrs. Touchett had once been like Isabel, Isabel was not at all  like Mrs. Touchett. The old man was full of kindness for her; it was a  long time, as he said, since they had had any young life in the house;  and our rustling, quickly-moving, clear-voiced heroine was as agreeable  to his sense as the sound of flowing water. He wanted to do something  for her and wished she would ask it of him. She would ask nothing but  questions; it is true that of these she asked a quantity. Her uncle had  a great fund of answers, though her pressure sometimes came in forms  that puzzled him. She questioned him immensely about England, about the  British constitution, the English character, the state of politics,  the manners and customs of the royal family, the peculiarities of the  aristocracy, the way of living and thinking of his neighbours; and in  begging to be enlightened on these points she usually enquired whether  they corresponded with the descriptions in the books. The old man always  looked at her a little with his fine dry smile while he smoothed down  the shawl spread across his legs.    \"The books?\" he once said; \"well, I don't know much about the books. You  must ask Ralph about that. I've always ascertained for myself--got my  information in the natural form. I never asked many questions even;  I just kept quiet and took notice. Of course I've had very good  opportunities--better than what a young lady would naturally have. I'm  of an inquisitive disposition, though you mightn't think it if you were  to watch me: however much you might watch me I should be watching you  more. I've been watching these people for upwards of thirty-five years,  and I don't hesitate to say that I've acquired considerable information.  It's a very fine country on the whole--finer perhaps than what we give  it credit for on the other side. Several improvements I should like to  see introduced; but the necessity of "]]]
