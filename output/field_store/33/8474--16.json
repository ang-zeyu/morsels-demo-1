Her indications of  approaching womanhood were very apparent. By becoming impressed by my  words she gave up romance-reading, devoted herself to outdoor sports,  to nature studies, and the vital forces diverted from the reproductive  system were employed in building up her physical energy, her health  improved, her nervousness disappeared, and three years later her  function of menstruation was painlessly established.    A frequent cause of painful menstruation is found in habitual neglect  of the bowels. The evils of constipation are common to the majority of  women and girls, and the foundation is laid in childhood. Mothers are  not careful enough in instructing children in the need of care in this  respect, and so the habit is formed early in life, and the results are  felt later.    If the bowels are not evacuated regularly the matter to be cast out of  the body accumulates in the rectum and large bowel, and by pressure  the circulation of the blood is impeded and congestion ensues. This  extends to all the pelvic organs; the uterus and ovaries thus  congested will soon manifest disease, and painful menstruation be the  result.    One of the most frequent causes of pain is congestion produced by  displacements. People are very apt to think that the displacement of  the uterus is the main factor, but in my opinion it is a secondary  condition, and not the one to be first considered. The uterus is a  small organ, not vital to the individual, is very movable, and not  sensitive, so that its displacement alone could hardly be considered  sufficient to cause so great a train of evils as is frequently  manifest. But the liver, stomach and bowels are large, vital organs,  and their displacement leads to greater consequences. You learned at  school that the bowels are over twenty feet in length, weigh as much  as twelve or fifteen pounds, are supported in a way that makes it  possible for them to sag into the abdominal cavity and press upon the  pelvic organs. Dr. Emerson, of the Boston School of Oratory, asserts  that in most adults the stomach and bowels are from two to six inches  below their normal location; and, as I have said before, Dr. Kellogg  often finds the stomach lying in the abdominal cavity as low down as  the umbilicus. What has caused this sagging of the abdominal viscera?  They certainly must have been intended to keep their place unless  there has been some interference. We find just such interference in  the ordinary arrangement of the clothing. Tight waists and bands, and  skirts supported by the hips, are cause sufficient for these  displacements.    Just above the hips there is no bony structure to protect and support  the soft, muscular parts. They yield to pressure, and the internal  viscera, deprived of muscular support, sink until they rest on the  pelvic organs. If, when you look at your abdomen, you see depressions  or hollows on each side below the floating ribs, you may know that the  bowels have sagged down out of place. If you feel great weariness,  backache, or a dragged down feeling in standing or walking, you may  know that the contents of the abdomen are pulling on their attachments  or pressing on the pelvic organs. Thus displaced, circulation is  hindered and the organs all become congested, or filled with blood  that moves very slowly. This congested condition is increased at  menstruation, and great pain may result.    It is well to have the counsel of some good, honest physician under  such circumstances, but should you be where it is not possible to have  such counsel, you may still be able to do something to help yourself.  In the first place, you can rearrange your clothing so as to relieve  all the organs from external weight or pressure, and, in the second  place, you can support the abdominal walls by applying pressure from  below. I have known cases of painful menstruation entirely relieved by  simply supporting the bowels by a bandage, thus relieving the uterus  of pressure and allowing a free circulation through all the internal  organs.    A very simple and practical bandage can be made at home at almost no  cost, either in time or money. Buy some thin, cheap cotton flannel.  Take lengthwise of the goods a strip long enough to go around the body  at the hips, which will be a yard or a little over, and wide enough to  fit from the thighs up to the waist, perhaps eight inches. Put darts  on the sides and in the center of the back, to make it fit the figure.  Make a couple of straps four inches wide and half a yard long; cut off  one end of each diagonally. Sew these slanting ends to the lower side  of the band about four inches from the center, that is eight inches  apart, and so that the short side of the strap will be towards the  center. Do not hem either band or straps, but overcast them; then they  will not feel uncomfortable.    In order to adjust the band properly it will be well to lie down on  the back upon the bandage with the knees raised. Press the hands low  down upon the abdomen and raise the contents. Repeat this several  times; then draw the bandage around, pin with safety pins, draw the  straps up between the limbs and fasten with safety pins to the  bandage. The support thus given is found to be very comfortable, and  girls who have much trouble in walking or standing during their  menstrual periods would find this simple bandage a great help at that  time.    When the bandage is removed at night you should rub and manipulate the  abdominal walls so as to increase the circulation and stimulate in  them a better circulation and thus make you stronger.    By deep breathing in a proper standing attitude the abdominal viscera  are lifted upward, and if the firmness of the abdominal walls is at  the same time increased by exercise, the difficulties may be largely  overcome. Some exercises will be found in Chapter XXIII. which are  calculated to strengthen the walls and to lift the internal organs.    I wish to call your attention to a cause of displacement that is quite  generally overlooked, and that is, a wrong attitude.    Dr. Eliza Mosher has made a very thorough study of this matter, and  she says that the common habit of standing on one foot is productive  of marked deformities of both face and body and of serious  displacements of internal organs. It is seldom a girl or woman can be  found whose body is perfectly symmetrical. By standing on one foot,  the hip and shoulder of one side approach each other, and so lessen  the space within the abdomen on that side. On the other side a support  has been removed for the contents of the abdomen, and they sag down  until they pry the uterus out of place and press it over towards the  side where there is less pressure. The broad ligament on one side is  stretched from use and on the other side shortened from disuse, and so  the uterus remains permanently dislocated.    Dr. Mosher thinks that standing continually with the weight on the  left foot is more injurious than bearing it on the right foot, for it  causes the uterus and ovaries to press upon the rectum and so produces  a mechanical constipation, especially during menstruation.    Wrong habits of sitting will produce the same results. If the girl  sits at school with one elbow on the desk, the head will be turned to  the opposite side and the spine will be inclined from the  perpendicular, and a lateral curvature be likely to result. If she  carries her books always on the same side, it will tend to increase  the curvature. If she sits with both elbows supported, her shoulders  will be pushed up. If her body is twisted as she sits, a strain comes  upon the muscles, and some ligaments will be lengthened and others  shortened, thus producing a lateral curvature.    To sit \"on the small of the back,\" that is, slipping down in the  chair, bracing the shoulders against the chair-back, tends to injure  the nerves by pressure, and also to create a posterior curvature of  the spine.    Does it not seem unfortunate that we should allow ourselves even to  form such wrong habits of sitting and standing? And now we ask, How  shall we know when we are in a correct attitude?    We have comparatively few correct examples to imitate. I notice people  everywhere, and I see that old and young stand incorrectly. The head  is poked forward, the shoulders are rounded, the chest is flattened,  and the curve in the lower part of the back is straightened. The whole  figure is out of balance, and therefore not harmonious. Not only is  the beauty of the figure destroyed, but the internal organs are  displaced. Many a mother who sees her daughter thus growing  round-shouldered keeps telling her to throw her shoulders back; but to  follow this command only increases the difficulty. The shoulders are  not primarily at fault, but the trouble originates in non-use of the  front waist muscles. These muscles, weakened by disease because of  tight clothing and corset steels, and also by cramped positions in  school or at work, refuse to hold the body erect, and it \"lops\" just  at this point. This \"lopping\" disturbs the harmonious relation of the  weights of shoulders, abdomen, head, and the large lower gluteal  muscles with which nature has cushioned the lower part of the body,  and so they are obliged to readjust themselves to balance each other,  and the awkward, ungainly, unhealthful posture results.    What is needed is to restore the right relation of these weights and  all will again be harmonious. Do not interfere with the shoulders, but  straighten the front of the body by elevating the chest and raising  the head until it is supported directly on the spine, letting the  shoulders take care of themselves. If the abdomen is now held back and  the gluteal muscles raised, the beautiful curves of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2846"],[0,"The Life of Flavius Josephus (#15)"],[1,"his companions  on ship-board, Acts 27:38, which are 276 in our copies, are too many;  whereas we find here, that Josephus and his companions, a very few years  after the other, were about 600.]    [Footnote 6: See Jewish War, B.

See  sect. 31, and Luke 11:54.]    [Footnote 12: How Josephus could say here that the Jewish laws forbade  them to \"spoil even their enemies,\" while yet, a little before his time,  our Savior had mentioned it as then a current maxim with them, \"Thou  shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thine enemy,\" Matthew 5:43, is worth  our inquiry. I take it that Josephus, having been now for many years an  Ebionite Christian, had learned this interpretation of the law of Moses  from Christ, whom he owned for the true Melah, as it follows in the  succeeding verses, which, though he might not read in St. Matthew's  Gospel, yet might he have read much the same exposition in their own  Ebionite or Nazarene Gospel itself; of which improvements made by  Josephus, after he was become a Christian, we have already had several  examples in this his life, sect. 3, 13, 15, 19, 21, 23, and shall  have many more therein before its conclusion, as well as we have them  elsewhere in all his later writings.]    [Footnote 13: Here we may observe the vulgar Jewish notion of  witchcraft, but that our Josephus was too wise to give any countenance  to it.]    [Footnote 14: In this section, as well as in the 18 and 33. those small  vessels that sailed on the sea of Galilee, are called by Josephus, i.e.  plainly ships; so that we need not wander at our evangelists, who still  call them ships; nor ought we to render them boats, as some do, Their  number was in all 230, as we learn from our author elsewhere.

Of them, see Le Moyne on Polycarp's Epistle, page 76.

It is in the 33rd code of his Bibliotheca, and runs thus: \"I  have read [says Photius] the chronology of Justus of Tiberias, whose  title is this, [Footnote The Chronology of] the Kings of Judah which  succeeded one another. This [Justus] came out of the city of Tiberias  in Galilee. He begins his history from Moses, and ends it not till the  death of Agrippa, the seventh [ruler] of the family of Herod, and the  last king of the Jews; who took the government under Claudius, had it  augmented under Nero, and still more augmented by Vespasian. He died  in the third year of Trajan, where also his history ends. He is very  concise in his language, and slightly passes over those affairs that  were most necessary to be insisted on; and being under the Jewish  prejudices, as indeed he was himself also a Jew by birth, he makes not  the least mention of the appearance of Christ, or what things happened  to him, or of the wonderful works that he did. He was the son of a  certain Jew, whose name was Pistus. He was a man, as he is described by  Josephus, of a most profligate character; a slave both to money and  to pleasures. In public affairs he was opposite to Josephus; and it is  related, that he laid many plots against him; but that Josephus, though  he had his enemy frequently under his power, did only reproach him in  words, and so let him go without further punishment. He says also, that  the history which this man wrote is, for the main, fabulous, and chiefly  as to those parts where he describes the Roman war with the Jews, and  the taking of Jerusalem.\"]    [Footnote 25: Here Josephus, a priest, honestly confesses that he did  that at the command of Vespasian, which he had before told us was not  lawful for a priest to do by the law of Moses, Antiq. B. III. ch. 12.  sect. 2. I mean, the taking a captive woman to wife. See also Against  Apion, B. I. sect. 7. But he seems to have been quickly sensible that  his compliance with the commands of an emperor would not excuse him, for  he soon put her away, as Reland justly observes here.]    [Footnote 27: Of this most remarkable clause, and its most important  consequences, see Essay on the Old Testament, page 193--195.]    [Footnote 28: Of this Epaphroditus, see the note on the Preface to the  Antiquities.]"]]]
