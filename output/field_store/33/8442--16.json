Several times we caught  glimpses, and then lost them. We scarcely seemed to gain ground upon  them at all. An old road-mender was standing near a heap of stones, his  shovel dropped and his hands raised. As we came near he made a sign to  speak. Blantyre drew the rein a little. \"To the common, to the common,  sir; she has turned off there.\" I knew this common very well; it was for  the most part very uneven ground, covered with heather and dark-green  furze bushes, with here and there a scrubby old thorn-tree; there were  also open spaces of fine short grass, with ant-hills and mole-turns  everywhere; the worst place I ever knew for a headlong gallop.    We had hardly turned on the common, when we caught sight again of the  green habit flying on before us. My lady's hat was gone, and her long  brown hair was streaming behind her. Her head and body were thrown back,  as if she were pulling with all her remaining strength, and as if that  strength were nearly exhausted. It was clear that the roughness of the  ground had very much lessened Lizzie's speed, and there seemed a chance  that we might overtake her.    While we were on the highroad, Blantyre had given me my head; but now,  with a light hand and a practiced eye, he guided me over the ground in  such a masterly manner that my pace was scarcely slackened, and we were  decidedly gaining on them.    About halfway across the heath there had been a wide dike recently cut,  and the earth from the cutting was cast up roughly on the other side.  Surely this would stop them! But no; with scarcely a pause Lizzie took  the leap, stumbled among the rough clods and fell. Blantyre groaned,  \"Now, Auster, do your best!\" He gave me a steady rein. I gathered myself  well together and with one determined leap cleared both dike and bank.    Motionless among the heather, with her face to the earth, lay my poor  young mistress. Blantyre kneeled down and called her name: there was no  sound. Gently he turned her face upward: it was ghastly white and  the eyes were closed. \"Annie, dear Annie, do speak!\" But there was no  answer. He unbuttoned her habit, loosened her collar, felt her hands and  wrist, then started up and looked wildly round him for help.    At no great distance there were two men cutting turf, who, seeing Lizzie  running wild without a rider, had left their work to catch her.    Blantyre's halloo soon brought them to the spot. The foremost man seemed  much troubled at the sight, and asked what he could do.    \"Can you ride?\"    \"Well, sir, I bean't much of a horseman, but I'd risk my neck for the  Lady Anne; she was uncommon good to my wife in the winter.\"    \"Then mount this horse, my friend--your neck will be quite safe--and  ride to the doctor's and ask him to come instantly; then on to the hall;  tell them all that you know, and bid them send me the carriage, with  Lady Anne's maid and help. I shall stay here.\"    \"All right, sir, I'll do my best, and I pray God the dear young lady may  open her eyes soon.\" Then, seeing the other man, he called out, \"Here,  Joe, run for some water, and tell my missis to come as quick as she can  to the Lady Anne.\"    He then somehow scrambled into the saddle, and with a \"Gee up\" and a  clap on my sides with both his legs, he started on his journey, making  a little circuit to avoid the dike. He had no whip, which seemed to  trouble him; but my pace soon cured that difficulty, and he found the  best thing he could do was to stick to the saddle and hold me in, which  he did manfully. I shook him as little as I could help, but once or  twice on the rough ground he called out, \"Steady! Woah! Steady!\" On the  highroad we were all right; and at the doctor's and the hall he did his  errand like a good man and true. They asked him in to take a drop of  something. \"No, no,\" he said; \"I'll be back to 'em again by a short cut  through the fields, and be there afore the carriage.\"    There was a great deal of hurry and excitement after the news became  known. I was just turned into my box; the saddle and bridle were taken  off, and a cloth thrown over me.    Ginger was saddled and sent off in great haste for Lord George, and I  soon heard the carriage roll out of the yard.    It seemed a long time before Ginger came back, and before we were left  alone; and then she told me all that she had seen.    \"I can't tell much,\" she said. \"We went a gallop nearly all the way, and  got there just as the doctor rode up. There was a woman sitting on the  ground with the lady's head in her lap. The doctor poured something into  her mouth, but all that I heard was, 'She is not dead.' Then I was led  off by a man to a little distance. After awhile she was taken to  the carriage, and we came home together. I heard my master say to  a gentleman who stopped him to inquire, that he hoped no bones were  broken, but that she had not spoken yet.\"    When Lord George took Ginger for hunting, York shook his head; he said  it ought to be a steady hand to train a horse for the first season, and  not a random rider like Lord George.    Ginger used to like it very much, but sometimes when she came back I  could see that she had been very much strained, and now and then she  gave a short cough. She had too much spirit to complain, but I could not  help feeling anxious about her.    Two days after the accident Blantyre paid me a visit; he patted me and  praised me very much; he told Lord George that he was sure the horse  knew of Annie's danger as well as he did. \"I could not have held him in  if I would,\" said he, \"she ought never to ride any other horse.\" I found  by their conversation that my young mistress was now out of danger, and  would soon be able to ride again. This was good news to me and I looked  forward to a happy life.          25 Reuben Smith      Now I must say a little about Reuben Smith, who was left in charge of  the stables when York went to London. No one more thoroughly understood  his business than he did, and when he was all right there could not be  a more faithful or valuable man. He was gentle and very clever in his  management of horses, and could doctor them almost as well as a  farrier, for he had lived two years with a veterinary surgeon. He was a  first-rate driver; he could take a four-in-hand or a tandem as easily  as a pair. He was a handsome man, a good scholar, and had very pleasant  manners. I believe everybody liked him; certainly the horses did. The  only wonder was that he should be in an under situation and not in the  place of a head coachman like York; but he had one great fault and that  was the love of drink. He was not like some men, always at it; he used  to keep steady for weeks or months together, and then he would break  out and have a \"bout\" of it, as York called it, and be a disgrace to  himself, a terror to his wife, and a nuisance to all that had to do with  him. He was, however, so useful that two or three times York had hushed  the matter up and kept it from the earl's knowledge; but one night, when  Reuben had to drive a party home from a ball he was so drunk that he  could not hold the reins, and a gentleman of the party had to mount the  box and drive the ladies home. Of course, this could not be hidden, and  Reuben was at once dismissed; his poor wife and little children had to  turn out of the pretty cottage by the park gate and go where they could.  Old Max told me all this, for it happened a good while ago; but shortly  before Ginger and I came Smith had been taken back again. York had  interceded for him with the earl, who is very kind-hearted, and the man  had promised faithfully that he would never taste another drop as long  as he lived there. He had kept his promise so well that York thought he  might be safely trusted to fill his place while he was away, and he was  so clever and honest that no one else seemed so well fitted for it.    It was now early in April, and the family was expected home some time in  May. The light brougham was to be fresh done up, and as Colonel Blantyre  was obliged to return to his regiment it was arranged that Smith should  drive him to the town in it, and ride back; for this purpose he took the  saddle with him, and I was chosen for the journey. At the station the  colonel put some money into Smith's hand and bid him good-by, saying,  \"Take care of your young mistress, Reuben, and don't let Black Auster be  hacked about by any random young prig that wants to ride him--keep him  for the lady.\"    We left the carriage at the maker's, and Smith rode me to the White  Lion, and ordered the hostler to feed me well, and have me ready for him  at four o'clock. A nail in one of my front shoes had started as I came  along, but the hostler did not notice it till just about four o'clock.  Smith did not come into the yard till five, and then he said he should  not leave till six, as he had met with some old friends. The man then  told him of the nail, and asked if he should have the shoe looked to.    \"No,\" said Smith, \"that will be all right till we get home.\"    He spoke in a very loud, offhand way, and I thought it very unlike him  not to see about the shoe, as he was generally wonderfully particular  about loose nails in our shoes. He did not come at six nor seven, nor  eight, and it was nearly nine o'clock before he called for me, and then  it was with a loud, rough voice. He seemed in a very bad temper, and  abused the hostler, though I could not tell what for.    The landlord stood at the door and said, \"Have a care, Mr. Smith!\" but  he answered angrily with an oath; and almost before he was out of the  town he began to gallop, frequently giving me a sharp cut with his whip,  though I was going at full speed. The moon had not yet risen, and it was  very dark. The roads were stony, having been recently mended; going over "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2710"],[0,"Louise de la Valliere (#15)"],[1,"deed.\"    \"You know I was obliged to inform M. Fouquet of what had happened, in  order that he would be able to anticipate what you might have to tell  the king?\"    \"That is rather obscure.\"    \"Not at all: M. Fouquet has his enemies--you will admit that, I  suppose.\"    \"Certainly.\"    \"And one in particular.\"    \"A dangerous one?\"    \"A mortal enemy. Well, in order to counteract that man's influence, it  was necessary that M. Fouquet should give the king a proof of his great  devotion to him, and of his readiness to make the greatest sacrifices.  He surprised his majesty by offering him Belle-Isle. If you had been the  first to reach Paris, the surprise would have been destroyed, it would  have looked as if we had yielded to fear.\"    \"I understand.\"    \"That is the whole mystery,\" said Aramis, satisfied that he had at last  quite convinced the musketeer.    \"Only,\" said the latter, \"it would have been more simple to have  taken me aside, and said to me, 'My dear D'Artagnan, we are fortifying  Belle-Isle, and intend to offer it to the king. Tell us frankly, for  whom you are acting. Are you a friend of M. Colbert, or of M. Fouquet?'  Perhaps I should not have answered you, but you would have added,--'Are  you my friend?' I should have said 'Yes.'\" Aramis hung down his head.  \"In this way,\" continued D'Artagnan, \"you would have paralyzed my  movements, and I should have gone to the king, and said, 'Sire, M.  Fouquet is fortifying Belle-Isle, and exceedingly well, too; but here is  a note, which the governor of Belle-Isle gave me for your majesty;' or,  'M. Fouquet is about to wait upon your majesty to explain his intentions  with regard to it.' I should not have been placed in an absurd position;  you would have enjoyed the surprise so long planned, and we should not  have had any occasion to look askant at each other when we met.\"    \"While, on the contrary,\" replied Aramis, \"you have acted altogether  as one friendly to M. Colbert. And you really are a friend of his, I  suppose?\"    \"Certainly not, indeed!\" exclaimed the captain. \"M. Colbert is a mean  fellow, and I hate him as I used to hate Mazarin, but without fearing  him.\"    \"Well, then,\" said Aramis, \"I love M. Fouquet, and his interests are  mine. You know my position. I have no property or means whatever. M.  Fouquet gave me several livings, a bishopric as well; M. Fouquet has  served and obliged me like the generous-hearted man he is, and I know  the world sufficiently well to appreciate a kindness when I meet with  one. M. Fouquet has won my regard, and I have devoted myself to his  service.\"    \"You could not possibly do better. You will find him a very liberal  master.\"    Aramis bit his lips; and then said, \"The best a man could possibly  have.\" He then paused for a minute, D'Artagnan taking good care not to  interrupt him.    \"I suppose you know how Porthos got mixed up in all this?\"    \"No,\" said D'Artagnan; \"I am curious, of course, but I never question a  friend when he wishes to keep a secret from me.\"    \"Well, then, I will tell you.\"    \"It is hardly worth the trouble, if the confidence is to bind me in any  way.\"    \"Oh! do not be afraid.; there is no man whom I love better than  Porthos, because he is so simple-minded and good-natured. Porthos is  so straightforward in everything. Since I have become a bishop, I have  looked for these primeval natures, which make me love truth and hate  intrigue.\"    D'Artagnan stroked his mustache, but said nothing.    \"I saw Porthos and again cultivated his acquaintance; his own time  hanging idly on his hands, his presence recalled my earlier and better  days without engaging me in any present evil. I sent for Porthos to come  to Vannes. M. Fouquet, whose regard for me is very great, having  learnt that Porthos and I were attached to each other by old ties of  friendship, promised him increase of rank at the earliest promotion, and  that is the whole secret.\"    \"I shall not abuse your confidence,\" said D'Artagnan.    \"I am sure of that, my dear friend; no one has a finer sense of honor  than yourself.\"    \"I flatter myself that you are right, Aramis.\"    \"And now\"--and here the prelate looked searchingly and scrutinizingly  at his friend--\"now let us talk of ourselves and for ourselves; will you  become one of M. Fouquet's friends? Do not interrupt me until you know  what that means.\"    \"Well, I am listening.\"    \"Will you become a marechal of France, peer, duke, and the possessor of  a duchy, with a million of francs?\"    \"But, my friend,\" replied D'Artagnan, \"what must one do to get all  that?\"    \"Belong to M. Fouquet.\"    \"But I already belong to the king.\"    \"Not exclusively, I suppose.\"    \"Oh! a D'Artagnan cannot be divided.\"    \"You have, I presume, ambitions, as noble hearts like yours have.\"    \"Yes, certainly I have.\"    \"Well?\"    \"Well! I wish to be a marechal; the king will make me marechal, duke,  peer; the king will make me all that.\"    Aramis fixed a searching look upon D'Artagnan.    \"Is not the king master?\" said D'Artagnan.    \"No one disputes it; but Louis XIII. was master also.\"    \"Oh! my dear friend, between Richelieu and Louis XIII. stood no  D'Artagnan,\" said the musketeer, very quietly.    \"There are many stumbling-blocks round the king,\" said Aramis.    \"Not for the king's feet.\"    \"Very likely not; still--\"    \"One moment, Aramis; I observe that every one thinks of himself, and  never of his poor prince; I will maintain myself maintaining him.\"    \"And if you meet with ingratitude?\"    \"The weak alone are afraid of that.\"    \"You are quite certain of yourself?\"    \"I think so.\"    \"Still, the king may some day have no further need for you!\"    \"On the contrary, I think his need of me will soon be greater than ever;  and hearken, my dear fellow, if it became necessary to arrest a new  Conde, who would do it? This--this alone in France!\" and D'Artagnan  struck his sword, which clanked sullenly on the tesselated floor.    \"You are right,\" said Aramis, turning very pale; and then he rose and  pressed D'Artagnan's hand.    \"That is the last summons for supper,\" said the captain of the  musketeers; \"will you excuse me?\"    Aramis threw his arm round the musketeer's neck, and said, \"A  friend like you is the brightest jewel in the royal crown.\" And they  immediately separated.    \"I was right,\" mused D'Artagnan; \"there is, indeed, something strangely  serious stirring.\"    \"We must hasten the explosion,\" breathed the coming cardinal, \"for  D'Artagnan has discovered the existence of a plot.\"        Chapter X. Madame and De Guiche.    It will not be forgotten how Comte de Guiche left the queen-mother's  apartments on the day when Louis XIV. presented La Valliere with the  beautiful bracelets he had won in the lottery. The comte walked to and  fro for some time outside the palace, in the greatest distress, from  a thousand suspicions and anxieties with which his mind was beset.  Presently he stopped and waited on the terrace opposite the grove of  trees, watching for Madame's departure. More than half an hour passed  away; and as he was at that moment quite alone, the comte could hardly  have had any very diverting ideas at his command. He drew his tables  from his pocket, and, after hesitating over and over again, determined  to write these words:--\"Madame, I implore you to grant me one moment's  conversation. Do not be alarmed at this request, which contains nothing  in any way opposed to the profound respect with which I subscribe  myself, etc., etc.\" He had signed and folded this singular love-letter,  when he suddenly observed several ladies leaving the chateau, and  afterwards several courtiers too; in fact, almost every one that formed  the queen's circle. He saw La Valliere herself, then Montalais talking  with Malicorne; he watched the departure of the very last of the  numerous guests that had a short time before thronged the queen-mother's  cabinet.    Madame herself had not yet passed; she would be obliged, however, to  cross the courtyard in order to enter her own apartments; and, from the  terrace where he was standing, De Guiche could see all that was going on  in the courtyard. At last he saw Madame leave, attended by a couple  of pages, who were carrying torches before her. She was walking very  quickly; as soon as she reached the door, she said:    \"Let some one go and look for De Guiche: he has to render an account  of a mission he had to discharge for me; if he should be disengaged,  request him to be good enough to come to my apartment.\"    De Guiche remained silent, hidden in the shade; but as soon as Madame  had withdrawn, he darted from the terrace down the steps and assumed a  most indifferent air, so that the pages who were hurrying towards his  rooms might meet him.    \"Ah! it is Madame, then, who is seeking me!\" he said to himself, quite  overcome; and he crushed in his hand the now worse than useless letter.    \"M. le comte,\" said one of the pages, approaching him, \"we are indeed  most fortunate in meeting you.\"    \"Why so, messieurs?\"    \"A command from Madame.\"    \"From Madame!\" said De Guiche, looking surprised.    \"Yes, M. le comte, her royal highness has been asking for you; she  expects to hear, she told us, the result of a commission you had to  execute for her. Are you at liberty?\"    \"I am quite at her royal highness's orders.\"    \"Will you have the goodness to follow us, then?\"    When De Guiche entered the princess's apartments, he found her pale and  agitated. Montalais was standing at the door, evidently uneasy about  what was passing in her mistress's mind. De Guiche appeared.    \"Ah! is that you, Monsieur de Guiche?\" said Madame; \"come in, I beg.  Mademoiselle de Montalais, I do not require your attendance any longer.\"    Montalais, more puzzled than ever, courtesied and withdrew. De Guiche  and the princess were left alone. The comte had every advantage in his  favor; it was Madame who had summoned him to a rendezvous. But how"]]]
