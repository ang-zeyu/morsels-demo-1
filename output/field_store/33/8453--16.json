The same mode of reasoning is applicable to the chicken pox. See  Class IV. 3. 1. 7.    15. _Scorbutus._ Sea-scurvy is caused by salt diet, the perpetual stimulus  of which debilitates the venous and absorbent systems. Hence the blood is  imperfectly taken up by the veins from the capillaries, whence brown and  black spots appear upon the skin without fever. The limbs become livid and  edematous, and lastly ulcers are produced from deficient absorption. See  Sect. XXXIII. 3. 2. and Class II. 1. 4. 13. For an account of the scurvy of  the lungs, see Sect. XXVII. 2.    M. M. Fresh animal and vegetable food. Infusion of malt. New beer. Sugar.  Wine. Steel. Bark. Sorbentia. Opium?    16. _Vibices._ Extravasations of blood become black from their being  secluded from the air. The extravasation of blood in bruises, or in some  fevers, or after death in some patients, especially in the parts which were  exposed to pressure, is owing to the fine terminations of the veins having  been mechanically compressed so as to prevent their absorbing the blood  from the capillaries, or to their inactivity from disease. The blood when  extravasated undergoes a chemical change before it is sufficiently fluid to  be taken up by the lymphatic absorbents, and in that process changes its  colour to green and then yellow.    17. _Petechiae._ Purple spots. These attend fevers with great venous  inirritability, and are probably formed by the inability of a single  termination of a vein, whence the corresponding capillary becomes ruptured,  and effuses the blood into the cellular membrane round the inert  termination of the vein. This is generally esteemed a sign of the putrid  state of the blood, or that state contrary to the inflammatory one. As it  attends some inflammatory diseases which are attended with great  inirritability, as in the confluent small pox. But it also attends the  scurvy, where no fever exists, and it therefore simply announces the  inactivity of the terminations of some veins; and is thence indeed a bad  symptom in fevers, as a mark of approaching inactivity of the whole  sanguiferous system, or death. The blue colour of some children's arms or  faces in very cold weather is owing in like manner to the torpor of the  absorbent terminations of the veins, whence the blood is accumulated in  them, and sometimes bursts them.           *       *       *       *       *    ORDO II.    _Decreased Irritation._    GENUS II.    _Decreased Action of the Secerning System._    These are always attended with decrease of partial, or of general heat; for  as the heat of animal bodies is the consequence of their various  secretions, and is perpetually passing away into the ambient air, or other  bodies in contact with them; when these secretions become diminished, or  cease, the heat of the part or of the whole is soon diminished, or ceases  along with them.    SPECIES.    1. _Frigus febrile._ Febrile coldness. There is reason to believe, that the  beginning of many fever-fits originates in the quiescence of some part of  the absorbent system, especially where they have been owing to external  cold; but that, where the coldness of the body is not owing to a diminution  of external heat, it arises from the inaction of some part of the secerning  system. Hence some parts of the body are hot whilst other parts are cold;  which I suppose gave occasion to error in Martyn's Experiments; where he  says, that the body is as hot in the cold paroxysms of fevers as at other  times.    After the sensorial power has been much diminished by great preceding  activity of the system, as by long continued external heat, or violent  exercise, a sudden exposure to much cold produces a torpor both greater in  degree and over a greater portion of the system, by subtracting their  accustomed stimulus from parts already much deprived of their irritability.  Dr. Franklin in a letter to M. Duberge, the French translator of his works,  mentions an instance of four young men, who bathed in a cold spring after a  day's harvest work; of whom two died on the spot, a third on the next  morning, and the other survived with difficulty. Hence it would appear,  that those, who have to travel in intensely cold weather, will sooner  perish, who have previously heated themselves much with drams, than those  who have only the stimulus of natural food; of which I have heard one well  attested instance. See Article VII. 2. 3. Class III. 2. 1. 17.    _Frigus chronicum._ Permanent coldness. Coldness of the extremities,  without fever, with dry pale skin, is a symptom of general debility, owing  to the decreased action of the arterial system, and of the capillary  vessels; whence the perspirable matter is secreted in less quantity, and in  consequence the skin is less warm. This coldness is observable at the  extremities of the limbs, ears, and nose, more than in any other parts: as  a larger surface is here exposed to the contact of the air, or clothes, and  thence the heat is more hastily carried away.    The pain, which accompanies the coldness of the skin, is owing to the  deficient exertion of the subcutaneous vessels, and probably to the  accumulation of sensorial power in the extremities of their nerves. See  Sect. XII. 5. 3. XIV. 6. XXXII. 3. and Class I. 2. 4. 1.    M. M. A blister. Incitantia, nutrientia, sorbentia. Exercise. Clothes.  Fire. Joy. Anger.    2. _Pallor fugitivus._ The fugitive paleness, which accompanies the  coldness of the extremities, is owing to a less quantity of blood passing  through the capillaries of the skin in a given time; where the absorbent  power of the veins is at the same time much diminished, a part of the blood  lingers at their junction with the capillary arteries, and a bluish tinge  is mixed with the paleness; as is seen in the loose skin under the  eye-lids, and is always a mark of temporary debility. See Class II. 1. 4.  4. Where the paleness of the skin is owing to the deficiency of red  globules in the blood, it is joined with a yellowish tinge; which is the  colour of the serum, with which the blood then abounds, as in chlorosis,  and in torpor or paralysis of the liver, and is often mistaken for a  superabundance of bile.    A permanent paleness of the skin is owing to the coalescence of the minute  arteries, as in old age. See Class I. 2. 2. 9. There is another source of  paleness from the increased absorption of the terminations of the veins, as  when vinegar is applied to the lips. See Sect. XXVII. 1. and another from  the retrograde motions of the capillaries and fine extremities of the  arteries. See Class II. 3. 1. 1.    M. M. A blister, nutrientia, incitantia, exercise, oxygene gas.    3. _Pus parcius._ Diminished pus. Dryness of ulcers. In the cold fits of  fever all the secretions are diminished, whether natural or artificial, as  their quantity depends on the actions of the glands or capillaries, which  then share in the universal inaction of the system. Hence the dryness of  issues and blisters in great debility, and before the approach of death, is  owing to deficient secretion, and not to increased absorption.    M. M. Opium, wine in very small quantities, Peruvian bark.    4. _Mucus parcior._ Diminished mucus. Dryness of the mouth and nostrils.  This also occurs in the cold fits of intermittents. In these cases I have  also found the tongue cold to the touch of the finger, and the breath to  the back of one's hand, when opposed to it, which are very inauspicious  symptoms, and generally fatal. In fevers with inirritability it is  generally esteemed a good symptom, when the nostrils and tongue become  moist after having been previously dry; as it shews an increased action of  the mucous glands of those membranes, which were before torpid. And the  contrary to this is the facies Hippocratica, or countenance so well  described by Hippocrates, which is pale, cold, and shrunk; all which are  owing to the inactivity of the secerning vessels, the paleness from there  being less red blood passing through the capillaries, the coldness of the  skin from there being less secretion of perspirable matter, and the shrunk  appearance from there being less mucus secreted into the cells of the  cellular membrane. See Class IV. 2. 4. 11.    M. M. Blisters. Incitantia.    5. _Urina parcior pallida._ Paucity of pale urine, as in the cold fits of  intermittents; it appears in some nervous fevers throughout the whole  disease, and seems to proceed from a palsy of the kidnies; which probably  was the cause of the fever, as the fever sometimes ceases, when that  symptom is removed: hence the straw-coloured urine in this fever is so far  salutary, as it shews the unimpaired action of the kidnies.    M. M. Balsams, essential oil, asparagus, rhubarb, a blister. Cantharides  internally.    6. _Torpor hepaticus._ Paucity of bile from a partial inaction of the  liver; hence the bombycinous colour of the skin, grey stools, urine not  yellow, indigestion, debility, followed by tympany, dropsy, and death.    This paralysis or inirritability of the liver often destroys those who have  been long habituated to much fermented liquor, and have suddenly omitted  the use of it. It also destroys plumbers, and house-painters, and in them  seems a substitute for the colica saturnina. See Sect. XXX.    M. M. Aloe and calomel, then the bark, and chalybeates. Mercurial ointment  rubbed on the region of the liver. Rhubarb, three or four grains, with  opium half a grain to a grain twice a day. Equitation, warm bath for half  an hour everyday.    7. _Torpor Pancreatis._ Torpor of the pancreas. I saw what I conjectured to  be a tumour of the pancreas with indigestion, and which terminated in the  death of the patient.

Economic  activity is strongly linked to the US, with which American Samoa  conducts the great bulk of its foreign trade. Tuna fishing and tuna  processing plants are the backbone of the private sector, with  canned tuna the primary export. Transfers from the US Government add  substantially to American Samoa's economic well-being. Attempts by  the government to develop a larger and broader economy are  restrained by Samoa's remote location, its limited transportation,  and its devastating hurricanes. Tourism, a developing sector, has  been held back by the recurring financial difficulties in East Asia.    GDP: purchasing power parity - $500 million (2000 est.)
