To secure the effect on us that the Greek tragedians  produced on contemporary audiences, it is necessary that our music be  a sublimation along the lines we are accustomed to, as theirs was  along lines familiar to them and effective with them. Otherwise,  instead of being moved by the miseries of Oedipus, we should be  chiefly occupied with amusement at the oddity of the music, and soon  bored unendurably by its monotony and thinness.    Mendelssohn decided then to use unison frequently for suggestion's  sake, but not to carry it to a fault. His experiments along these  lines have been of evident advantage to Paine, who has, however, kept  strictly to his own individuality, and produced a work that, at its  highest, reaches a higher plane, in my opinion, than anything in  Mendelssohn's noble tragedies,--and I am not, at that, one of those  that affect to look down upon the achievements of the genius that  built \"Elijah.\"    Paine's prelude is an immense piece of work, in every way larger and  more elaborate than that to Mendelssohn's \"Antigone\" (the \"Oedipus  in Kolonos\" begins strongly with only one period of thirteen  measures). The opening chorus of Paine's \"Oedipus\" is the weakest  thing in the work. The second strophe has a few good moments, but soon  falls back into what is impudent enough to be actually catchy!--and  that, too, of a Lowell Mason, Moody and Sankey catchiness. Curiously  enough, Mendelssohn's \"Antigone\" begins with a chorus more like a  drinking-song than anything else, and the first solo is pure  _Volkslied_; both of them imbued with a Teutonic flavor that could be  cut with a knife. In Mendelssohn's \"Oedipus in Kolonos,\" however,  the music expresses emotion rather than German emotion, and abounds in  splendors of harmony that are strikingly Wagnerian--in advance.    [Music: Copyright, 1895, by Arthur P. Schmidt.    POSTLUDE TO \"OEDIPUS TYRANNUS,\" BY J.K. PAINE.]    Paine's second chorus describes the imaginary pursuit by Fate of the  murderer of King Laius. It is full of grim fire, and the second  strophe is at first simply terrible with awe. Then it degenerates  somewhat into an arioso, almost Italian. The fourth chorus defends the  oracles from Jocasta's incredulity. It is written almost in march  measure, and is full of robor.    At this point in the tragedy, where it begins to transpire to  Oedipus that he himself was the unwitting murderer and the  incestuous wretch whose exile the oracle demands before dispelling the  plague,--here the divine genius of Sophokles introduces a chorus of  general merriment, somewhat as Shakespeare uses the maundering fool as  a foil to heighten King Lear's fate. No praise can be too high for  Paine's music here. Its choric structure is masterly, its spirit is  running fire. Note, as an instance, the effect at the words \"To save  our land thou didst rise as a tower!\" where the music itself is  suddenly uplift with most effective suggestion.    The sixth chorus shows the effect of Oedipus' divulged guilt and the  misery of this fool of Fate. The music is an outburst of sheer genius.  It is overpowering, frightening. The postlude is orchestral, with the  chorus speaking above the music. Jocasta has hanged herself, Oedipus  has torn out his own eyes with her brooch. The music is a fitting  reverie on the great play, and after a wild tumult it subsides in a  resigned quietude.    From Greek tragedy to Yankee patriotism is a long cry, yet I think  Paine has not wasted his abilities on his \"Song of Promise,\" written  for the Cincinnati May Festival of 1888. Though the poem by Mr. George  E. Woodberry is the very apotheosis of American brag, it has a  redeeming technic. The music, for soprano solo, mixed chorus, and  orchestra, reaches the very peaks of inspiration. I doubt if any  living composer or many dead masters could grow so epic, as most of  this. In a way it is academic. It shows a little of the influence of  Wagner,--as any decent music should nowadays. But it is not Wagner's  music, and it is not trite academia. There is no finicky tinsel and no  cheap oddity.    Considering the heights at which both words and music aimed, it is  amazing that they did not fall into utter wreck and nauseating bathos.  That they have proved so effective shows the sure-footedness of  genius. It is all good, especially the soprano solo.    This music is exquisite, wondrously exquisite, and it is followed by a  maestoso e solenne movement of unsurpassable majesty. I have never  read anything more purely what music should be for grandeur. And it  praises our ain countree! It might well be taken up by some of our  countless vocal societies to give a much needed respite to Haendel's  threadbare \"Messiah.\"    When one considers the largeness of the works to which Paine has  devoted himself chiefly, he can be excused for the meagreness and  comparative unimportance of his smaller works for piano and vocal  solo. The only song of his I care for particularly is \"A Bird upon a  Rosy Bough\" (op. 40), which is old-fashioned, especially in  accompaniment, yet at times delicious. The song \"Early Spring-time\" is  most curiously original.    Of piano pieces there are a sprightly \"Birthday Impromptu\" and a fuga  giocosa, which deals wittily with that theme known generally by the  words \"Over the Fence Is Out!\" The \"Nocturne\" begins like Schumann,  falls into the style of his second Novellette, thence to the largo of  Beethoven's Sonata (op. 10, No. 3), thence to Chopinism, wherein it  ends, an interesting assemblage withal!    A long \"Romance\" for the piano is marked by some excellent incidents  and much passion, but it lacks unity. It is the last work in \"An Album  of Pianoforte Pieces,\" which is otherwise full of rare delights. It is  made up of opera 25, 26, and 39. Opus 25 contains four characteristic  pieces,--a \"Dance\" full of dance-rapture, a most original \"Impromptu,\"  and a \"Rondo Giocoso,\" which is just the kind of brilliantly witty  scherzo whose infrequency in American music is so lamentable and so  surprising. Opus 26 includes ten sketches, all good, especially  \"Woodnotes,\" a charming tone-poem, the deliciously simple \"Wayside  Flowers,\" \"Under the Lindens,\" which is a masterpiece of beautiful  syncopation, a refreshingly interesting bit in the hackneyed  \"Millstream\" form, and a \"Village Dance,\" which has much of that  quaint flavor that makes Heller's etudes a perennial delight.    Besides these, there are a number of motets, organ preludes, string  quartettes, concert pieces for violin, 'cello, piano, and the like, all  contributing to the furtherance of an august fame.      _Dudley Buck._    Music follows the laws of supply and demand just as the other  necessities of life do. But before a demand could exist for it in its  more austere and unadulterated forms, the general taste for it must be  improved. For this purpose the offices of skilful compromisers were  required, composers who could at the same time please the popular  taste and teach it discrimination. Among these invaluable workers, a  high place belongs, in point both of priority and achievement, to  Dudley Buck. He has been a powerful agent, or reagent, in converting  the stagnant ferment into a live and wholesome ebullition, or as the  old Greek evolutionists would say, starting the first progress in the  primeval ooze of American Philistinism.    A more thoroughly New England ancestry it would be hard to find. The  founder of the family came over from England soon after the  _Mayflower_ landed. Buck was named after Governor Dudley of the  Plymouth Colony. He was born at Hartford, March 10, 1839. His father  was a prosperous shipping merchant, one of whose boats, during the  Civil War, towed the _Monitor_ from New York to Fortress Monroe on the  momentous voyage that destroyed the _Merrimac's_ usefulness.    Buck, though intended for commercial life, borrowed a work on  thorough-bass and a flute and proceeded to try the wings of his muse.  A melodeon supplanted the flute, and when he was sixteen he attained  the glory of a piano, a rare possession in those times. (Would that it  were rarer now!) He took a few lessons and played a church-organ for a  salary,--a small thing, but his own.    After reaching the junior year in Trinity College, he prevailed upon  his parents to surrender him to music, an almost scandalous career in  the New England mind of that day, still unbleached of its Blue Laws.    At the age of nineteen he went to Leipzig and entered the Conservatory  there, studying composition under Hauptmann and E.F. Richter,  orchestration under Rietz, and the piano under Moscheles and Plaidy.  Later he went to Dresden and studied the organ with Schneider.    After three years in Germany, he studied for a year in Paris, and came  home, settling down in Hartford as church-organist and teacher. He  began a series of organ-concert tours lasting fifteen years. He played  in almost every important city and in many small towns, popularizing  the best music by that happy fervor of interpretation which alone is  needed to bring classical compositions home to the public heart. In  1869 he was called to the \"mother-church\" of Chicago. In the Chicago  fire he lost many valuable manuscripts, including a concert overture  on Drake's exquisite poem, \"The Culprit Fay,\" which must be especially  regretted. He moved his family to Boston, assuming in ten days the  position of organist at St. Paul's; and later he accepted charge of  \"the great organ\" at Music Hall,--that organ of which Artemus Ward  wrote so deliciously.    In 1875 Theodore Thomas, whose orchestra had performed many of Buck's  compositions, invited him to become his assistant conductor at the  Cincinnati Music Festival and at the last series of concerts at the  Central Park Garden in New York. Buck accepted and made his home in  Brooklyn, where he has since"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23860"],[0,"The Young Man's Guide (#15)"],[1,"offers, and such a one  may never again occur. I am confident I shall succeed.'    How often have I heard this train of reasoning pursued! But if it were  correct, how happens it that those facts exist which have just been  mentioned? More than this; why do almost all men assert gratuitously  after they have spent twenty years in their avocation, that although  they thought themselves wise when they began their profession, they  were exceedingly ignorant? Who ever met with a man that did not feel  this ignorance more sensibly after twenty years of experience, than  when he first commenced?    This self flattery and self confidence--this ambition to be men of  business and begin to figure in the world,--is not confined to any  particular occupation or profession of men, but is found in all. Nor is  it confined to those whose object in life is _pecuniary_ emolument. It  is perhaps equally common among those who seek their happiness in  ameliorating the condition of mankind by legislating for them, settling  their quarrels, soothing their passions, or curing the maladies of  their souls and bodies.    Perhaps the evil is not more glaring in any class of the community than  in the medical profession. There is a strong temptation to this, in the  facility with which licenses and diplomas may be obtained. Any young  man who has common sense, if he can read and write tolerably, may in  some of the States, become a knight of the lancet in three years, and  follow another employment a considerable part of the time besides. He  has only to devote some of his _extra_ hours to the study of anatomy,  surgery, and medicine, recite occasionally to a practitioner, as  ignorant, almost, as himself; hear one series of medical lectures; and  procure certificates that he has studied medicine 'three years,'  including the time of the lectures; and he will be licensed, almost of  course. Then he sallies forth to commit depredations on society at  discretion; and how many he kills is unknown. 'I take it for granted,  however,' said a President of a College, three years ago, who  understood this matter pretty well, 'that every half-educated young  physician, who succeeds at last in getting a _reputable_ share of  practice, must have rid the world, rather prematurely, of some dozen or  twenty individuals, at the least, in order to qualify himself for the  profession.'    The evil is scarcely more tolerable, as regards young ministers, except  that the community in general have better means of knowing when they  are imposed upon by ignorance or quackery in this matter, than in most  other professions. The principal book for a student of theology is in  the hands of every individual, and he is taught to read and understand  it. The great evil which arises to students of divinity themselves from  entering their profession too early, is the loss of health. Neither the  minds nor the bodies of young men are equal to the responsibilities of  this, or indeed of any other profession or occupation, at 20, and  rarely at 25. Nothing is more evident than that young men, generally,  are losers in the end, both in a pecuniary point of view and in regard  to health, by commencing business before 30 years of age. But this I  have already attempted to show.    As regards candidates for the ministry, several eminent divines are  beginning to inculcate the opinion, with great earnestness, that to  enter fully upon the active duties of this laborious vocation before  the age I have mentioned, is injurious to themselves and to the cause  they wish to promote--the cause of God. And I hope their voices will be  raised louder and louder on this topic, till the note of remonstrance  reaches the most distant villages of our country.    It has often occurred to me that every modest young man, whatever may  be his destination, _might_ learn wisdom from consulting the history of  the YOUNG MAN OF NAZARETH as well as of the illustrious reformer who  prepared the way for him.[5] _Our_ young men, since newspapers have  become so common, are apt to think themselves thoroughly versed in law,  politics, divinity, &c.; and are not backward to exhibit their talents.  But who is abler at disputation than HE who at twelve years of age  proved a match for the learned doctors of law at Jerusalem? Did he,  whose mind was so mature at twelve, enter upon the duties of _his_  ministry (a task more arduous than has ever fallen to the lot of any  _human_ being) at 18 or 20 years of age? But why not, when he had so  much to do?--Or did he wait till he was in his 30th year?    The great question with every young man should not be, When can I get  such assistance as will enable me to commence business;--but, Am I well  _qualified_ to commence? Perfect in his profession, absolutely so, no  man ever will be; but a measure of perfection which is rarely if ever  attained under 30 years of age, is most certainly demanded. To learn  the simplest handicraft employment in some countries, a person must  serve an apprenticeship of at least _seven years_. Here, in America,  half that time is thought by many young men an intolerable burden, and  they long to throw it off. They wish for what they call a better order  of things. The consequences of this feeling, and a growing spirit of  insubordination, are every year becoming more and more deplorable.          [4] This fact, so obvious to every student of human nature, has        sometimes given rise to an opinion that orphans make their way        best in the world. So far as the business of making money is        concerned, I am not sure but it is so.          [5] Even Timothy--_young_ Timothy as he has been often        called--was probably in his 30th year when he was ordained.      SECTION II. _Importance of Integrity._    Every one will admit the importance of integrity in all his dealings,  for however dishonest he may be himself, he cannot avoid perceiving the  necessity of integrity in others. No society could exist were it not  for the measure of this virtue which remains. Without a degree of  _confidence_, in transacting business with each other, even the savage  life would be a thousand times more savage than it now is. Without it,  a gang of thieves or robbers could not long hold together.    But while all admit the sterling importance of strict integrity, how  few practise it! Let me prevail when I entreat the young not to hazard  either their reputation or peace of mind for the uncertain advantages  to be derived from unfair dealing. It is _madness_, especially in one  who is just beginning the world. It would be so, if by a single unfair  act he could get a fortune; leaving the loss of the soul out of the  question. For if a trader, for example, is once generally known to be  guilty of fraud, or even of taking exorbitant profits, there is an end  to his reputation. Bad as the world is, there is some respect paid to  integrity, and wo be to him who forgets it.    If a person habitually allows himself in a single act not sanctioned by  the great and golden rule of loving others as we do ourselves, he has  entered a road whose everlasting progress is downward. Fraudulent in  _one_ point, he will soon be so in another--and another; and so on to  the end of the chapter, if there be any end to it. At least no one who  has gone a step in the downward road, can assure himself that this will  not be the dreadful result.    An honest bargain is that only in which the fair market price or value  of a commodity is mutually allowed, so far as this is known. The market  price is usually, the equitable price of a thing. It will be the object  of every honest man to render, in all cases, an equivalent for what he  receives. Where the market price cannot be known, each of the parties  to an honest contract will endeavor to come as near it as possible;  keeping in mind the rule of doing to others as they would desire others  to do to them in similar circumstances. Every bargain not formed on  these principles is, in its results, unjust; and if intentional, is  fraudulent.    There are a great many varieties of this species of fraud.    1. _Concealing the market price._ How many do this; and thus buy for  less, and sell for more than a fair valuation! Why so many practise  this kind of fraud, and insist at the same time that it is no fraud at  all, is absolutely inconceivable, except on the supposition that they  are blinded by avarice. For they perfectly know that their customers  would not deal with them at any other than market prices, except from  sheer ignorance; and that the advantage which they gain, is gained by  misapprehension of the real value of the commodities. But can an honest  man take this advantage? Would he take it of a child? Or if he did,  would not persons of common sense despise him for it?    But why not as well take advantage of a child as of a man? Because, it  may be answered, the child does not know the worth of what he buys or  sells; but the man does, or might. But in the case specified, it is  evident he _does not_ know it, if he did he would not make the bargain.  And for proof that such conduct is downright fraud, the person who  commits it, has only to ask himself whether he would be willing others  should take a similar advantage of _his_ ignorance. 'I do as I agree,'  is often the best excuse such men can make, when reasoned with on the  injustice of their conduct, without deciding the question, whether  their agreement is founded on a desire to do right.    2. Others _misrepresent the market price_. This is done in various  ways. They heard somebody say the price in market was so or so; or such  a one bought at such or such a price, or another sold at such a price:  all of which prices, purchases, and sales are _known positively_ to be  different from those which generally prevail. Many contrive to satisfy  their consciences in this way, who would by no means venture at once  upon plain and palpable lying.  "]]]
