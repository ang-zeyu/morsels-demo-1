[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21630"],[0,"Bibliomania in the Middle Ages (#15)"],[1,"occur in his epistles of his  begging the loan of some volume for transcription;[116] in more than one,  I think, he asks for portions of the Holy Scriptures which he was always  anxious to obtain to compare their various readings, and to enable him  with greater confidence to correct his own copies.    In the early part of the twelfth century, the monks of Canterbury  transcribed a vast number of valuable manuscripts, in which they were  greatly assisted by monk Edwine, who had arrived at considerable  proficiency in the calligraphical art, as a volume of his transcribing,  in Trinity college, Cambridge, informs us;[117] it is a Latin Psalter,  with a Saxon gloss, beautifully illuminated in gold and colors; at the  end appears the figure of the monkish scribe, holding the pen in his hand  to indicate his avocation, and an inscription extols his ingenuity in the  art.[118]    Succeeding archbishops greatly enriched the library at Canterbury. Hubert  Walter, who was appointed primate in 1191, gave the proceeds of the  church of Halgast to furnish books for the library;[119] and Robert  Kildwardly, archbishop in 1272, a man of great learning and wisdom, a  remarkable orator and grammarian, wrote a great number of books, and was  passionately fond of collecting them.[120]    I learn from Wanley, that there is a large folio manuscript in the  library of Trinity Hall, Cambridge, written about the time of Henry V. by  a monk of St. Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury, containing the history of  Christ Church; this volume proves its author to have been something of a  bibliophile, and that is why I mention it, for he gives an account of  some books then preserved, which were sent over by Pope Gregory to St.  Augustine; these precious volumes consisted of a Bible in two volumes,  called \"Biblia Gregorian,\" beautifully written, with some of the leaves  tinted with purple and rose-color, and the capital letters rubricated.  This interesting and venerable MS. so immediately connected with the  first ages of the Christian church of Britain, was in existence in the  time of James I., as we learn by a passage in a scarce tract entitled \"A  Petition Apologetical,\" addressed by the Catholics to his majesty, where,  as a proof that we derive our knowledge of Scripture originally from the  church of Rome; they say, \"The very original Bible, the self-same  _Numero_ which St. Gregory sent in with our apostle, St. Augustine, being  as yet reserved by God's special providence, as testimony that what  Scriptures we have, we had them from Rome.\"[121]    He next mentions two Psalters, one of which I have seen; it is among the  manuscripts in the Cotton collection,[122] and bears full evidence of its  great antiquity. This early gem of biblical literature numbers 160  folios; it contains the Roman Psalter, with a Saxon interlinear  translation, written on stout vellum, in a clear, bold hand. On opening  the volume, we find the first page enriched with a dazzling specimen of  monkish skill--it is a painting of our Saviour pointing with his right  hand to heaven, and in his left holding the sacred book; the corners are  occupied with figures of animals, and the whole wrought on a glittering  ground work, is rendered still more gorgeous by the contrast which the  purple robes of Jesus display; on the reverse of this fine illumination  there is a beautiful tesselated ornament, interwoven with animals,  flowers, and grotesque figures, around which are miniatures of our  Saviour, David, and some of the apostles. In a line at the bottom the  word CATVSVIR is inscribed. Very much inferior to this in point of art is  the illumination, at folio 31, representing David playing his harp,  surrounded by a musical coterie; it is probably the workmanship of a more  modern, but less skilful scribe of the Saxon school. The smaller  ornaments and initial letters throughout the manuscript display great  intricacy of design.    The writer next describes two copies of the Gospels, both now in the  Bodleian Collection at Oxford. A Passionarium Sanctorum, a book for the  altar, on one side of which was the image of our Saviour wrought in gold,  and lastly, an exposition of the Epistles and Gospels; the monkish  bookworm tells us that these membraneous treasures were the most ancient  books in all the churches of England.[123]    A good and liberal monk, named Henry De Estria, who was elected prior in  the year 1285, devoted both his time and wealth to the interests of his  monastery, and is said to have expended L900 in repairing the choir and  chapter-house.[124] He wrote a book beginning, \"_Memoriale Henerici  Prioris Monasteri Xpi Cantuariae_,\"[125] now preserved in the Cotton  collection; it contains the most extensive monastic catalogue I had ever  seen, and sufficiently proves how Bibliomania flourished in that noble  monastery. It occupies no less than thirty-eight treble-columned folio  pages, and contains the titles of more than three thousand works. To  attempt to convey to the reader an idea of this curious and sumptuous  library, without transcribing a large proportion of its catalogue, I am  afraid will be a futile labor; but as that would occupy too much space,  and to many of my readers be, after all, dry and uninteresting, I shall  merely give the names of some of the most conspicuous. Years indeed it  must have required to have amassed a collection so brilliant and superb  in those days of book scarcity. Surprise and wonder almost surpass the  admiration we feel at beholding this proud testimonial of monkish  industry and early bibliomania. Many a choice scribe, and many an _Amator  Librorum_ must have devoted his pen and purse to effect so noble an  acquisition. Like most of the monastic libraries, it possessed a great  proportion of biblical literature--copies of the Bible whole and in  parts, commentaries on the same, and numerous glossaries and concordances  show how much care the monks bestowed on the sacred writings, and how  deeply they were studied in those old days. In patristic learning the  library was unusually rich, embracing the most eminent and valuable  writings of the Fathers, as may be seen by the following names, of whose  works the catalogue enumerates many volumes:        Augustine.      Ambroise.      Anselm.      Alcuin.      Aldelm.      Benedict.      Bernard.      Bede.      Beranger.      Chrysostom.      Eusebius.      Fulgentius.      Gregory.      Hillarius.      Isidore.      Jerome.      Lanfranc.      Origen.    Much as we may respect them for all this, our gratitude will materially  increase when we learn how serviceable the monks of Canterbury were in  preserving the old dead authors of Greece and Rome. We do not, from the  very nature of their lives being so devoted to religion and piety, expect  this; and knowing, too, what \"heathen dogs\" the monks thought these  authors of idolatry, combined with our notion, that they, far from being  the conservers, were the destroyers, of classic MSS., for the sake, as  some tell us, of the parchment on which they were inscribed, we are  somewhat staggered in our opinion to find in their library the following  brilliant array of the wise men of the ancient world:        Aristotle,      Boethius,      Cicero,      Cassiodorus,      Donatus,      Euclid,      Galen,      Justin,      Josephus,      Lucan,      Martial,      Marcianus,      Macrobius,      Orosius,      Plato,      Priscian,      Prosper,      Prudentius,      Suetonius,      Sedulus,      Seneca,      Terence,      Virgil,      Etc., etc.    Nor were they mere fragments of these authors, but, in many cases,  considerable collections; of Aristotle, for instance, they possessed  numerous works, with many commentaries upon him. Of Seneca a still more  extensive and valuable one; and in the works of the eloquent Tully, they  were also equally rich. Of his _Paradoxa, de Senectute, de Amiticia_,  etc., and _his Offices_, they had more copies than one, a proof of the  respect and esteem with which he was regarded. In miscellaneous  literature, and in the productions of the middle age writers, the  catalogue teems with an abundant supply, and includes:        Rabanus Maurus,      Thomas Aquinas,      Peter Lombard,      Athelard,      William of Malmsbury,      John of Salisbury,      Girald Barry,      Thomas Baldwin,      Brutus,      Robert Grosetete,      Gerlandus,      Gregory Nazianzen,      History of England,      Gesti Alexandri Magni,      Hystoria Longobardos,      Hystoriae Scholasticae,      Chronicles _Latine et Anglice_,      Chronographia Necephori.    But I trust the reader will not rest satisfied with these few samples of  the goodly store, but inspect the catalogue for himself. It would occupy,  as I said before, too much space to enumerate even a small proportion of  its many treasures, which treat of all branches of literature and  science, natural history, medicine, ethics, philosophy, rhetoric,  grammar, poetry, and music; each shared the studious attention of the  monks, and a curious \"_Liber de Astronomia_\" taught them the rudiments of  that sublime science, but which they were too apt to confound with its  offspring, astrology, as we may infer, was the case with the monks of  Canterbury, for their library contained a \"_Liber de Astroloebus_,\"  and the \"Prophesies of Merlin.\"    Many hints connected with the literary portion of a monastic life may  sometimes be found in these catalogues. It was evidently usual at Christ  Church Monastery to keep apart a number of books for the private study of  the monks in the cloister, which I imagine they were at liberty to use at  any time.[126]    A portion of the catalogue of monk Henry is headed \"_Lib. de Armariole  Claustre_,\"[127] under which it is pleasing to observe a Bible, in two  volumes, specified as for the use of the infirmary, with devotional  books, lives of the fathers, a history of England, the works of Bede,  Isidore, Boethius,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21632"],[0,"Fame and Fortune; or, The Progress of Richard Hunter (#15)"],[1,"then a stout, red-faced man came up puffing, and evidently in no  little excitement.    \"Seize that boy!\" he gasped, pointing to Dick. \"He's got my  pocket-book.\"    Contrary to the usual rule in such cases, a policeman did happen to be  about, and, following directions, stepped up, and laid his hand on  Dick's shoulder.    \"You must go with me, my fine fellow,\" he said \"Hand over that  pocket-book, if you please.\"    \"What's all this about?\" said Dick. \"Here's the pocket-book, if it is  yours. I'm sure I don't want it.\"    \"You're a cool hand,\" said the guardian of the public peace. \"If you  don't want it, what made you steal it from this gentleman's pocket?\"    \"I didn't take it,\" said Dick, shortly.    \"Is this the boy that stole your pocket-book?\" demanded the policeman of  the red-faced man, who had now recovered his breath.    \"It's the very young rascal. Does he pretend to deny it?\"    \"Of course he does. They always do.\"    \"When it was found on him too! I never knew such barefaced impudence.\"    \"Stop a minute,\" said Dick, \"while I explain. I was standing looking in  at that window, when I felt something thrust into my pocket. I took it  out and found it to be that pocket-book. Just then that gentleman came  up, and charged me with the theft.\"    \"That's a likely story,\" said the officer. \"If any one put the  pocket-book into your pocket, it shows you were a confederate of his.  You'll have to come with me.\"    And poor Dick, for the first time in his life, was marched to the  station-house, followed by his accuser, and a gang of boys. Among these  last, but managing to keep at a respectful distance, was Micky Maguire.          CHAPTER XIII.    DICK IN THE STATION-HOUSE.      Poor Dick! If Trinity Church spire had suddenly fallen to the ground, it  could scarcely have surprised and startled him more than his own arrest  for theft.    During the hard apprenticeship which he had served as a street boy, he  had not been without his share of faults and errors; but he had never,  even under the severest pressure, taken what did not belong to him.    Of religious and moral instruction he had then received none; but  something told him that it was mean to steal, and he was true to this  instinctive feeling. Yet, if he had been arrested a year before, it  would have brought him less shame and humiliation than now. Now he was  beginning to enjoy the feeling of respectability, which he had compassed  by his own earnest efforts. He felt he was regarded with favor by those  whose good opinion was worth having, and his heart swelled within him as  he thought that they might be led to believe him guilty. He had never  felt so down-hearted as when he walked in company with the policeman to  the station-house, to be locked up for examination the next morning.    \"You wasn't sharp enough this time, young fellow,\" said the policeman.    \"Do you think I stole the pocket-book?\" asked Dick, looking up in the  officer's face.    \"Oh, no, of course not! You wouldn't do anything of that kind,\" said the  policeman, ironically.    \"No, I wouldn't,\" said Dick, emphatically. \"I've been poor enough and  hungry enough sometimes, but I never stole. It's mean.\"    \"What is your name?\" said the officer. \"I think I have seen you before.\"    \"I used to black boots. Then my name was Ragged Dick. I know you. Your  name is Jones.\"    \"Ragged Dick! Yes, yes, I remember. You used to be pretty well out at  elbows, if I remember rightly.\"    \"My clothes used to be pretty well ventilated,\" said Dick, smiling  faintly. \"That was what made me so healthy, I expect. But did you ever  know me to steal?\"    \"No,\" said the officer, \"I can't say I have.\"    \"I lived about the streets for more then eight years,\" said Dick, \"and  this is the first time I was ever arrested.\"    \"What do you do now?\"    \"I'm in a store on Pearl Street.\"    \"What wages do you get?\"    \"Ten dollars a week.\"    \"Do you expect me to believe that story?\"    \"It's true.\"    \"I don't believe there's a boy of your age in the city that gets such  wages. You can't earn that amount.\"    \"I jumped into the water, and saved the life of Mr. Rockwell's little  boy. That's why he pays me so much.\"    \"Where did you get that watch and chain? Are they gold?\"    \"Yes, Mrs. Rockwell gave them to me.\"    \"It seems to me you're in luck.\"    \"I wasn't very lucky to fall in with you,\" said Dick. \"Don't you see  what a fool I should be to begin to pick pockets now when I am so well  off?\"    \"That's true,\" said the officer, who began to be shaken in his previous  conviction of Dick's guilt.    \"If I'd been going into that business, I would have tried it when I was  poor and ragged. I should not have waited till now.\"    \"If you didn't take the pocket-book, then how came it in your pocket?\"    \"I was looking in at a shop window, when I felt it thrust into my  pocket. I suppose it was the thief who did it, to get out of the scrape  himself.\"    \"That might be. At any rate, I've known of such cases. If so, you are  unlucky, and I am sorry for you. I can't let you go, because appearances  are against you, but if there is anything I can do to help you I will.\"    \"Thank you, Mr. Jones,\" said Dick, gratefully. \"I did not want you to  think me guilty. Where is the man that lost the pocket-book?\"    \"Just behind us.\"    \"I should like to speak to him a moment.\"    The red-faced man, who was a little behind, came up, and Dick asked,  quietly, \"What makes you think I took your pocket-book, sir?\"    \"Wasn't it found in your pocket, you young rascal?\" said the other,  irritably.    \"Yes,\" said Dick.    \"And isn't that enough?\"    \"Not if somebody else put it there,\" said Dick.    \"That's a likely story.\"    \"It's a true story.\"    \"Can you identify this as the boy who robbed you, and whom you saw  running?\"    \"No,\" said the red-faced man, rather unwillingly. \"My eyesight is not  very good, but I've no doubt this is the young rascal.\"    \"Well, that must be decided. You must appear to-morrow morning to prefer  your complaint.\"    \"Mind you don't let the rascal escape,\" said the other.    \"I shall carry him to the station-house, where he will be safe.\"    \"That's right, I'll make an example of him. He won't pick my pocket  again in a hurry.\"    \"I hope the judge won't be so sure that I am guilty,\" said Dick. \"If he  is, it'll go hard with me.\"    \"Why don't you call your employer to testify to your good character?\"    \"That's a good idea. Can I write a note to him, and to another friend?\"    \"Yes; but perhaps the mail wouldn't carry them in time.\"    \"I will send a messenger. Can I do so?\"    \"When we get to the station-house I will see that you have a chance to  send. Here we are.\"    Escorted by the officer, and followed by his accuser, Dick entered.  There was a railing at the upper end of the room, and behind it a desk  at which sat a captain of the squad.    The officer made his report, which, though fair and impartial, still was  sufficient to cause our hero's commitment for trial.    \"What is your name?\" questioned the captain.    Dick thought it best to be straightforward, and, though he winced at the  idea of his name appearing in the daily papers, answered in a manly  tone, \"Richard Hunter.\"    \"Of what nation?\"    \"American.\"    \"Where were you born?\"    \"In this city.\"    \"What is your age?\"    \"Sixteen years.\"    These answers were recorded, and, as Dick expressed a desire to  communicate with his friends before trial, permission was given him to  write to them, and the trial was appointed for the next morning at the  Tombs. The red-faced man certified that his wallet contained nine  dollars and sixty-two cents, which was found to be correct. He agreed to  be present the next morning to prefer his charge, and with such manifest  pleasure that he was not retained, as it sometimes happens, to insure  his appearance.    \"I will find a messenger to carry your notes,\" said the friendly  officer.    \"Thank you,\" said Dick. \"I will take care that you are paid for your  trouble.\"    \"I require no pay except what I have to pay the messenger.\"    Dick was escorted to a cell for safe-keeping. He quickly dashed off a  letter to Mr. Murdock, fearing that Mr. Rockwell might not be in the  store. It was as follows:--         \"MR. MURDOCK,--What will you think when I tell you that I       have been unlucky enough to be arrested on suspicion of picking a       man's pocket? The real thief slipped the wallet into my pocket as I       was looking into a shop window, and it was found on me. I couldn't       prove my innocence, so here I am at the station-house. They will       think strange at the store because I am absent. Will you tell Mr.       Rockwell privately what has detained me; but don't tell Mr.       Gilbert. He don't like me any too well, and would believe me guilty       at once, or pretend he did. I am sure _you_ won't believe I would       do such a thing, or Mr. Rockwell either. Will you come and see me       to-night? I am to be tried to-morrow morning. I aint very proud of       the hotel where I am stopping, but they didn't give me much choice       in the matter.         \"RICHARD HUNTER.\"         \"_Station-House, Franklin Street._\"    The other letter was to Fosdick; here it is:--         \"DEAR FOSDICK,--I didn't much think when I left you this       morning that I should be writing to you from the station-house       before night. I'll tell you how it happened.\" [Here follows a       detailed account, which is omitted, as the reader is already       acquainted with all the circumstances.] \"Of course they will wonder       at the boarding-house where I am. If Miss Peyton or Mr. Clifton       inquires after me to-night, you can say that I am detained by       business of importance. That's true enough. I wish it wasn't. As       soon as dinner is over, I wish you'd come and see me. I don't know       if you can, not being acquainted with the rules of this hotel. I       shan't stop here"]]]
