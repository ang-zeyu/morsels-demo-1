A True History of a Great City's Wiles and Temptations (#15)"],[1,"the results of his investigation were  given, estimates that over $15,000,000 was invested in that business,  and that the yearly amount spent in those houses averaged over  $10,000,000. In this chapter, however, the reader's attention is more  particularly invited to the class of assignation and prostitution  bagnios, known as panel houses.    The name \"panel house\" was originally derived from a false impression  prevalent in the community, that the rooms occupied by the inmates were  fitted with sliding panels in the walls and partitions, through and by  means of which most of the robberies were committed. But, as will be  seen hereafter, the term is a misnomer, so far as the fact is concerned.  But they had to have some distinctive appellation, and \"panel house\" is  a convenient generic term.    The proprietors of panel houses, in years gone by, were nearly all  professional gamblers, a fact which is more or less true to-day, where  the real, genuine house of that character exists, but there are hundreds  of women who work the \"panel game\" upon their victims, who hire a simple  room in some furnished-room house. If detected the entire house has  conferred upon it the name of panel house, and is ever afterwards  described and known as such in police and court records.    The real, Simon-pure panel thief is generally a young and pretty female,  who has been initiated into the mysteries of the game by either a  gambler or a lover, and of whom she is the mistress. It is the  conception of a man's brain, needing the assistance of an attractive  woman to carry out the scheme, and was probably originally devised by  some broken-down gambler to secure enough funds wherewith to resume  play. No woman would ever have dreamt of practicing such an intricate  and bold robbery, for she could never have carried it out. There are  many women engaged in these robberies who are neither young nor  handsome, but they are adepts and make up in knowledge and experience  what they lack in charms; but the most successful are young and  attractive. They succeed better when they are winsome, for reasons which  require no explanation.    Strange as it may appear, there are instances on record in which some of  the professional females engaged in this panel game have preserved  intact their virtue, so far as men generally were concerned, and have  remained steadfast and true to their lovers, through all vicissitudes.  They have solicited and accompanied men to their rooms, yet still have  so contrived and maneuvered, as to have their male companion robbed  without indulging in any of the other apparently necessary concomitants  to the success of the undertaking. But these women are rare--very rare  indeed. The fact of their occasional existence merely proves that the  sole object of all women engaged in the nefarious game of panel thieving  is robbery--first, last and all the time.    From the well-known dislike of the victims of this game to making their  names and losses known by figuring prominently in a court of justice,  panel-house thieves escape the punishment they justly deserve and thrive  more successfully, perhaps, than other professional robbers. Besides,  the game is practiced more particularly upon the most respectable  element of the community. Men of families, strangers visiting the city,  men of advanced years, and even clergymen are sometimes caught in the  net. As may be imagined, people of this class prefer to lose their money  rather than have their names made public, and so long as such victims  are to be found, panel houses will thrive and thieves become rich.  Instances are on record where as much as eight thousand dollars have  been secured from a single victim, who, from his prominence in social  and business circles, allowed the matter to drop, although he was  acquainted with the thief.    A man and a woman are essential to the execution of the panel game. The  woman's part consists in \"cruising,\" a term applied to walking the  streets to pick up men. The man has two parts to enact, as \"runner\" and  \"robber.\" The first role consists in being on the street watching his  female decoy. If he sees a man partially under the influence of liquor,  he informs the decoy, who places herself in the way of the obfuscated  citizen. Or, in the event of the woman securing a customer herself, the  \"runner\" observes it, and when she and her new-found friend proceed  towards the house, the \"runner\" rapidly goes ahead and unobserved slips  in first to make arrangements for the second role in the drama, and  which in some cases has ended in a tragedy.    The foregoing more particularly concerns panel thieves, that is,  \"couples\" who adopt the business on their own account. There are regular  panel houses, by which is meant houses of ill-fame, with perhaps from  ten to twenty girl inmates, where nearly every room in the house is  perfectly arranged for systematically pursuing this kind of robbery, and  where the moment a girl retires to a room with a gentleman, the  proprietor is notified, and when the chance occurs, completely cleans  the unconscious victim of every cent he may have about him. These  houses, however, are not now as plentiful as they were immediately after  the close of the war. The victims of these houses were many, for  outwardly they did not differ from ordinary gilded palaces of sin, and,  being situated in streets well known to contain respectable seraglios,  were frequently visited in the orthodox way by gentlemen in search of  the \"elephant.\"    The game, however, is played in precisely the same way in all cases,  whether by a \"loving couple\" on their own account or by one of the many  girls in a regular house instituted for the sole purpose. And this is  the way it is done: A pretty female, young, with entrancing eyes, an  elegant form, richly and fashionably attired, is noticed daintily  picking her steps on a street crossing. She is more frequently noticed  in the act of crossing a street, as it affords her an opportunity of  rendering herself still more attractive and seductive by practicing  those apparently aimless little feminine arts that prove so fascinating  to the coarser sex. The skirts are just lifted high enough to discover a  beautiful foot; perhaps a glimpse of an ankle bewitchingly smothered in  lace frills is revealed; while a warm scintillant glance of invitation  is thrown at the interested beholder, who, perhaps, follows and engages  her in conversation. More than likely he is agreeably surprised to find  how lady-like and attractive her manners are, and by his own suggestion  or her invitation he readily accompanies her to her home; not, however,  without being previously warned that she is married, that her husband is  very ugly and jealous, and a big, strong, quarrelsome fellow, to boot.    The room to which she conducts him is apparently an ordinary room,  furnished in an ordinary way. It is, however, usually a front room,  separated by folding doors from the room in the rear. It is in  connection with these folding doors that mystery and danger lurk. These  folding doors are a study. Some are so constructed that instead of  opening in the center, one of them opens upon hinges which are placed on  that portion of the doors where the lock is usually situated, so that it  opens at the woodwork on the side. If a chance visitor to one of these  rooms should have his suspicions aroused by any act of his companion,  and should closely examine the doors, he would find a bolt on the inside  securely fastened, but he would not be likely to see that it barely  rested in the socket, and thinking everything was all right, his  suspicions would be disarmed. As there would be but one other door in  the room--that by which he entered--and as he locked that himself,  privacy would apparently be insured.    In the folding doors are several minute holes, through which a person  behind them can watch all that goes on in the front room. These holes,  however, are frequently dispensed with, and a cough or other understood  signal by the female gives the thief warning when all is ready for his  entrance.    After the lapse of perhaps five minutes the female coughs or makes some  understood signal, the door noiselessly opens at the side, a man enters  unseen, secures the victims clothing, disappears into the next room,  takes the money out of a pocket-book or pocket, replaces the pocket-book  in the clothes, takes the watch, the studs out of the shirt, everything,  in fact, of any value, and replacing the clothing, softly closes the  door again. Now comes the scene: A knock is heard on the other  door--that by which the victim entered. With a slight scream the female  remarks, that the person knocking is her husband, and with great haste  proceeds to dress, all the while telling her now frightened companion  that he will kill him if he sees him, hurriedly assists him to dress and  half pushing him, forces him out of the room, down the stairs into the  street.    Another phase of this trick is when, in the absence of folding doors,  the lock or bolt is so arranged that socket and bolt are both upon the  door. Another is to fill the socket with some substance, a cork for  instance, so that when the bolt is pushed forward, it fails to enter the  socket.    An instance is related of an elderly man coming into one of these rooms,  and casually remarking to his female friend, \"I hope I won't be rapped  out of this room by anyone, for I have been in two places to-night and  was rapped out of both.\" That gentleman was robbed in the first house he  entered, and must have remarked in the second one that he was \"rapped  out\" of the first, for his companion in this last affair knew what had  happened in the other cases, and that he would not have been treated in  that manner unless they had secured his money. And so his remark being  again overheard, he was unceremoniously \"rapped out\" of this third and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24726"],[0,"A History of Art for Beginners and Students: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture (#15)"],[1,"nephew, Leonardo Buonarroti,  conveyed his remains to Florence secretly, disguised as a bale of  merchandise. At Florence, on a Sunday night, his body was borne to Santa  Croce, in a torchlight procession, and followed by many thousands of  citizens. There his friends once more gazed upon the face which had not  been seen in Florence for thirty years; he looked as if quietly sleeping.  Some days later a splendid memorial service was held in San Lorenzo,  attended by all the court, the artists, scholars, and eminent men of the  city. An oration was pronounced; rare statues and paintings were  collected in the church; all the shops of the city were closed; and the  squares were filled with people.    Above his grave in Santa Croce, where he lies near Dante, Machiavelli,  Galileo, and many other great men, the Duke and Leonardo Buonarroti  erected a monument. It has statues of Painting, Sculpture, and  Architecture, and a bust of the great man who sleeps beneath.    In the court of the Uffizi his statue stands together with those of other  great Florentines. His house in the Ghibelline Street now belongs to the  city of Florence, and contains many treasured mementoes of his life and  works; it is open to all who wish to visit it. In 1875 a grand festival  was held in Florence to celebrate the four hundredth anniversary of his  birth. The ceremonies were very impressive, and at that time some  documents which related to his life, and had never been opened, were, by  command of Victor Emmanuel, given to proper persons to be examined.    Thus it is that the great deeds of great men live on and on, through all  time, and it is a joy to know that though the fourscore and nine years of  the life of this artist had much of care and sorrow in them, his name and  memory are still cherished, and must continue to be, while from his life  many lessons may be drawn to benefit and encourage others--lessons which  we cannot here write out; but they teach patience, industry, and  faithfulness to duty, while they also warn us to avoid the bitterness and  roughness which are blemishes on the memory of this great, good man.    DANIELE DE VOLTERRA (1509-1566) was the best scholar of Michael Angelo.  His principal pictures are the \"Descent from the Cross,\" in the Church of  Trinita di Monti, in Rome, and the \"Massacre of the Innocents,\" in the  Uffizi Gallery; both are celebrated works.    The next important Florentine painter was ANDREA DEL SARTO (1488-1530).  His family name was Vannucchi; but because his father was a tailor, the  Italian term for one of his trade, _un sarto_, came to be used for the  son. Early in life Andrea was a goldsmith, as were so many artists; but,  when he was able to study painting under Pietro di Cosimo, he became  devoted to it, and soon developed his own style, which was very soft and  pleasing. His pictures cannot be called great works of art, but they are  favorites with a large number of people. He succeeded in fresco-painting,  and decorated several buildings in Florence, among them the Scalzo, which  was a place where the Barefooted Friars held their meetings, and was named  from them, as they are called _Scalzi_. These frescoes are now much  injured; but they are thought his best works of this kind.    Probably Andrea del Sarto would have come to be a better painter if he had  been a happier man. His wife, of whom he was very fond, was a mean,  selfish woman who wished only to make a great show, and did not value her  husband's talents except for the money which they brought him. She even  influenced him to desert his parents, to whom he had ever been a dutiful  son. About 1518 Francis I., king of France, invited Andrea to Paris to  execute some works for him. The painter went, and was well established  there and very popular, when his wife insisted that he should return to  Florence. Francis I. was very unwilling to spare him, but Andrea dared not  refuse to go to his wife; so he solemnly took an oath to return to Paris  and bring his wife, so that he could remain as long as pleased the king,  and then that sovereign consented. Francis also gave the artist a large  sum of money to buy for him all sorts of beautiful objects.    When Andrea reached Florence his wife refused to go to France, and  persuaded him to give her the king's money. She soon spent it, and Andrea,  who lived ten years more, was very unhappy, while the king never forgave  him, and to this day this wretched story must be told, and continues the  remembrance of his dishonesty. After all he had sacrificed for his wife,  when he became very ill, in 1530, of some contagious disease, she deserted  him. He died alone, and with no prayer or funeral was buried in the  Convent of the Nunziata, where he had painted some of his frescoes.    [Illustration: FIG. 41.--THE MADONNA DEL SACCO. _By Andrea del Sarto._]    His pictures are very numerous; they are correct in drawing, very softly  finished, and have a peculiar gray tone of color. He painted a great  number of Holy Families, one of which is called the \"Madonna del Sacco,\"  because St. Joseph is leaning on a sack (Fig. 41). This is in the convent  where he is buried. His best work is called the \"Madonna di San Francesco\"  and hangs in the tribune of the Uffizi Gallery. This is a most honorable  place, for near it are pictures by Michael Angelo, Raphael, Titian, and  other great painters, as well as some very celebrated statues, such as the  \"Venus de Medici\" and the \"Dancing Faun.\" Andrea del Sarto's pictures of  the Madonna and Child are almost numberless; they are sweet, attractive  works, as are also his St. Barbara, St. Agnes, and others of his single  figures.    We will now leave the Florentine school of the sixteenth century, and  speak of the great master of the Roman school, RAPHAEL SANZIO, or SANTI  (1483-1520), who was born at Urbino on Good Friday. His father was a  painter, and Raphael showed his taste for art very early in life. Both his  parents died while he was still a child, and though he must have learned  something from seeing his father and other painters at their work, we say  that Perugino was his first master, for he was but twelve years old when  he entered the studio of that painter in Perugia.    Here he remained more than eight years, and about the time of leaving  painted the very celebrated picture called \"Lo Sposalizio,\" or the  Marriage of the Virgin, now in the Brera at Milan. This picture is famous  the world over, and is very important in the life of the painter, because  it shows the highest point he reached under Perugino, or during what is  called his first manner in painting. Before this he had executed a large  number of beautiful pictures, among which was the so-called \"Staffa  Madonna.\" This is a circular picture and represents the Virgin walking in  a springtime landscape. It remained in the Staffa Palace in Perugia three  hundred and sixty-eight years, and in 1871 was sold to the Emperor of  Russia for seventy thousand dollars.    In 1504 Raphael returned to Urbino, where he became the favorite of the  court, and was much employed by the ducal family. To this time belong the  \"St. George Slaying the Dragon\" and the \"St. Michael Attacking Satan,\" now  in the gallery of the Louvre. But the young artist soon grew weary of the  narrowness of his life, and went to Florence, where, amid the treasures of  art with which that city was crowded, he felt as if he was in an enchanted  land. It is worth while to recount the wonderful things he saw; they were  the cathedral with the dome of Brunelleschi, the tower of Giotto, the  marbles and bronzes of Donatello, the baptistery gates of Ghiberti, the  pictures of Masaccio, Ghirlandajo, Fra Angelico, and many other older  masters, while Michael Angelo and Leonardo were surprising themselves and  all others with their beautiful works.    At this time the second manner of Raphael begun. During his first winter  here he painted the so-called \"Madonna della Gran Duca,\" now in the Pitti  Gallery, and thus named because the Grand Duke of Tuscany, Ferdinand III.,  carried it with him on all his journeys, and said his prayers before it at  morning and evening. He made a visit to Urbino in 1505, and wherever he  was he worked continually, and finished a great number of pictures, which  as yet were of religious subjects with few and unimportant exceptions.    [Illustration: FIG. 42.--PORTRAIT OF RAPHAEL. _Painted by Himself._]    When he returned to Florence in 1506, the cartoon of Leonardo da Vinci's  \"Battle of the Standard\" and Michael Angelo's \"Bathing Soldiers\" revealed  a new world of art to Raphael. He saw that heroic, exciting scenes could  be represented by painting, and that vigor and passion could speak from  the canvas as powerfully as Christian love and resignation. Still he did  not attempt any new thing immediately. In Florence he moved in the best  circles. He received orders for some portraits of nobles and wealthy men,  as well as for madonnas and Holy Families. Before long he visited Bologna,  and went again to Urbino, which had become a very important city under the  reign of Duke Guidobaldo. The king of England, Henry VIII., had sent to  this duke the decoration of the Order of the Garter. In return for this  honor, the duke sent the king rich gifts, among which was a picture of St.  George and the Dragon by Raphael.    While at Urbino, at this time, he painted his first classic subject, the  \"Three Graces.\" Soon after, he returned the third time to Florence, and  now held much intercourse with Fra Bartolommeo, who gave the younger  artist valuable instruction as to his color and drapery. In 1508, among a  great number of pictures he painted the madonna which is called \"La Belle  Jardiniere,\" and is now one of the treasures of the Louvre. The Virgin is  pictured in the midst of a flowery landscape, and it has been said that a  beautiful flower-girl to whom Raphael was attached was his model "]]]
