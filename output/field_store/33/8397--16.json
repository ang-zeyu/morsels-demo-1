He kept up the uneasy crawling, putting hundred-yard  space after hundred-yard space between him and the fire, while, when he  did glance back, it was after dropping flat behind some bush and raising  his head till he could see the eland lying like a low hummock or patch  of bush, and with the lion growing less distinct.    On he went again, refreshed by the trifling rest, but far more by the  fact that he was really getting more distant from the great danger.  For  it was in vain to try to assure himself that as the lion did not molest  him before it had fed, it was far less likely to do so now.    As he crawled onward, wishing he could progress like the baboons which  haunted some of the stony kopjes in the neighbourhood, he tried to think  how long it would be before he overtook the cob, and in spite of the  danger and excitement he could not help smiling, for his position  reminded him of one of the old problems at school about if A goes so  many yards an hour and B so many, for twenty-four hours, how long will  it be before B is overtaken by A?    \"A fellow can't do that without pen, ink, and paper,\" he said to  himself.  \"It's too big a sum to do on sand, and, besides, I don't know  how fast I am going, nor B for Breezy either.  But oh, how hot I am!\"    At last he could bear it no longer; he was apparently getting no nearer  the cob, but he certainly must be, he felt, sufficiently far from the  lion to make it safe for him to rise and trot after the nag.  He had his  whistle, and if he could make Breezy hear, the horse would come to him.  But he dared not use that yet; besides, he was too far away.    At last he did rise, gazed timorously back, and then started onward at a  steady trot--a means of progression which seemed quite restful after the  painful crawl, and gaining spirit by the change, he went on with so good  effect that he saw that he was certainly gaining on the cob.  This  infused fresh spirit within him, and congratulating himself on the fact  that he must soon get within whistling distance, he had another glance  back to see that eland and lion were an indistinct mass, or so it seemed  for the moment.  Then he turned cold again in spite of the heat, for  there, moving slowly over the sand, about a quarter of a mile back, was  a tawny, indistinct something which gradually grew clearer to his  startled eyes, for unmistakably there was a lion stealthily stalking  him, taking advantage of every tuft to approach unseen, and before many  minutes had passed he felt that it would be within springing distance,  and all would be over in spite of his almost superhuman toil.    There was only one chance for him now, he felt, and that was to run his  best.    He did not pause to look, but began to run over the burning sand, his  breath coming hot and thick; but he must go on, he knew, for at every  affrighted glance behind, there was his enemy keeping up its stealthy  approach, and the cob was still so far away.        CHAPTER ELEVEN.    BEING STALKED.    Those were minutes which would have made the stoutest-hearted man feel  that his case was hopeless; and Dyke struggled along, feeling his legs  grow weaker, and as if his feet were turned to heavy weights of lead.  Still he kept on at what was no longer a good run, for his pace had  degenerated into a weary trot, and there were moments when he fancied  that the cob was disappearing in a mist of distance, while at the same  time he felt a constant inclination to check his speed, so as to be able  to gaze back at his pursuer, which every now and then sent his heart  upward with a tremendous throb, as it made a few rapid bounds to gain  the shelter of bushes, and disappeared, but, as the boy well knew, to  come into sight again much nearer.    The later part of that terrible flight was dreamlike in its strange,  wild confusion, and was dominated by a despairing feeling that he had  now done all that was possible, and must throw himself down and yield to  his fate.    But the instinctive desire for life, the horror of being seized by the  monstrous beast, and the thought of Emson and their home, which, shabby  and rough as it was, now seemed to be a glorious haven of refuge, kept  him struggling on in spite of his exhaustion.  Life was so sweet; there  was so much to do; and poor Joe would be so lonely and broken-hearted  when he found out his brother's fate.  It would be, he knew, the last  terrible blow of all to the expedition.  For himself, he was so stunned  by horror and exertion that he could not feel that there would be much  pain; all he hoped for was that the seizure would be sudden and the end  instantaneous; but still he kept up that slow, steady double over the  burning sand, with his heavy gun going jerk, jerk, giving him, as it  were, regular blows across the loins to urge him on.    Another wild glance back, and the lion growing bigger; and another weary  stare in advance, and the cob still so distant, but clearer now to his  vision, though certainly shuffling away.    Again he looked back, to see the savage beast grovelling itself along,  with its lower parts almost touching the sand, and seeming more than  ever to keep up that stealthy, cat-like approach, so as to get within  springing distance.    And now a reaction began to take place, and through his teeth Dyke's hot  breath panted out:    \"I don't care; I'll die game.  He shan't kill me for nothing.\"    His hand went to his belt, and he snatched out his keen sheath-knife,  determined to hold it with both fists before him, and face the lion when  the beast sprang.  It would not save his life, he felt; but the brute  would suffer, and that was some consolation, even then.  Then his left  hand went to his throat, to tear open his collar, so that he could  breathe more freely; but it did not reach the button, for it struck  against the big metal whistle which hung from his neck by a twisted  leather thong.    His next act was almost involuntary.  He placed the metal to his lips,  and blew with all his might a long, trilling whistle, despairing as he  blew, but still with a faint hope that the shrill sound would reach  through the clear air to where the cob was labouring along with its  hobbled feet.    The result sent a thrill through the boy, for to his great joy he saw  that the cob had stopped.    No: it was fancy.    No: it was no imagination, no fancy of his disordered brain; for the  moment before, the horse was end on to him; now, it had turned  broadside, and was gazing back; and in his excitement Dyke whistled  again with all the breath he could put into the act.    The horse still stared back.  It had heard the familiar call, and Dyke  felt another thrill of hope, for on looking back he saw that the whistle  had had a double effect: the lion had stopped short, sprung erect, and  stood at gaze with bristling mane, staring after him, its head looking  double its former size.    But Dyke did not pause; he ran on, dragging his leaden feet, till he saw  that the cob was once more moving away, and the lion crawling rapidly  along in his track.    Another shrill, trilling whistle with the former effect, and the animals  in front and rear stopped again, giving the boy a few yards' gain.    But the reprieve was very short.  The lion soon recovered from its  surprise at the unwonted sound, one which might mean danger, and resumed  its stalk, while the cob again went on.    How long that terrible time lasted Dyke could not tell, but the  whistling was resumed over and over again, always with the same effect,  and with the hope growing that perhaps at last he might reach the horse,  Dyke toiled on.    Despair came, though, in company with the hope; for at any moment the  boy felt that the cob might wildly rush off as soon as it realised how  near the lion was behind its master--fear getting the better of the long  training which had taught it to obey its master's call.  But still Dyke  was getting nearer and nearer, and the whistle did not seem to lose its  effect, always checking horse and lion as well, till to Dyke's great joy  the cob uttered a loud whinnying sound, answered by a deep muttering  growl from the lion.    \"I can go no farther,\" panted Dyke at last, and his run degenerated into  a weary stumble, as he raised the whistle once more to his lips, blew  with all his feeble might, and then began to walk.    Hope once more, for the whinnying sounded loudly now; and in spite of  the presence of the lion a couple of hundred yards behind its master,  Breezy suddenly came toward where Dyke stood, advancing in a stumbling  canter.  Dyke tried to call to it, but no words would come; and he  glanced back to see the lion gliding over the ground nearer and nearer.    How long would it be before it was near enough to make its bound?    Long before he could get down by the cob's forelegs to loosen the  hobbles from its fetlocks, and mount.    Dyke felt that as he staggered to meet the cob, and the beautiful little  animal stumbled toward him, whinnying joyfully, seeing for the time  nothing but its master, to whom it looked for protection.    \"I shall never do it!  I shall never do it!\" he panted, and he glanced  back to see the lion stealing on, with its eyes glaring in the sunshine.  And there was no friendly, playful look here, for now Dyke noticed that  this was not the lion which he had encountered by the eland, but  another, evidently one which had been following the droves of antelopes,  and, fierce with hunger, had turned aside after the first object that it  had seen.    At that moment Dyke dropped upon his knees, throwing one arm round the  fettered legs of his favourite, which had ceased its whinnying, and  began to tremble violently, snorting and starting, and, yielding to its  panic at the sight of the approaching enemy, threatened to bound away.    To get the hobbles undone was impossible, for Dyke's hands trembled from  weakness"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24852"],[0,"The Wonders of the Jungle, Book One (#15)"],[1," Arizona.    Now, do you not think it would be a good idea to get a few men from  those countries and learn from them how to manage camels? Then the  camels of Arizona also could be used in crossing the deserts there,  where there are no railroads.    Besides being the only animal that can cross the desert, the camel is  different from any other four-legged animal even in the way he walks.    You have seen how a horse walks? When his left foreleg is lifted off  the ground, his right hind leg is also lifted off the ground; then in  the next step, when his right foreleg is lifted off the ground, his  left hind leg is also lifted off the ground. That means that the two  legs which move at the same time are those placed at the _opposite  corners_ of his body. But when a camel walks, he lifts the two legs  on the _same side_ of his body at the same time. And when he takes the  next step, he lifts the two legs on the other side of his body.    Now, my dear, I have told you many things about the camel which are  different from anything in any other animal. So, before I close this  chapter, I want you to remember these things about the camel:    1. His _foot_ is _padded_ in such a way that he can walk or run on  sand.    2. He can _close_ his _nostrils_ to keep out the sand in a storm.    3. His _thick_ and bushy _eyebrows_ and _thick eyelashes_ keep the  glare of the sun from his eyes.    4. His stomach has many _cells_ like bottles, in which he can _store  up water_.    5. He can _store up food_ in his _hump_.    6. He walks by moving both legs on the _same side_ of his body at the  same time.    In another chapter I shall tell you about an animal that can also do  one of these things: he can _store up food_ in his body, though in a  different way. That animal is the _bear_. He sleeps through the whole  winter, and has to have a store of food somewhere in his body to last  all that time.          CHAPTER XII    The Camel and the Thief      Now I shall tell you a story about a camel and a thief. It is a true  story, and happened many, many years ago. The story shows what we can  learn by watching the animals.    Once upon a time, a traveler was going on foot across the country. In  his belt he had a purse full of money. One day, as the sun began to  get hot, he lay down on the grass under a tree near the roadway, and  fell asleep.    After a few hours he woke up, and what was his surprise to find that  the purse was gone! While he was asleep, somebody had quietly stolen  his purse and gone away.    The traveler ran to the nearest village, and there told the police  about it. Now, among the police there was a very clever man, and the  police brought him with them to the place where the money had been  stolen. The clever man looked all around the place very carefully to  see if he could find any marks on the ground. On the grass near the  tree he found no marks; in fact, if a person walks on the grass just  once or twice it does not leave any mark. But on the roadway near by  he found footprints.    \"They are a camel's footprints,\" he said, looking at the marks  carefully. \"And the marks of all the four feet are not quite the same.  Three of them are quite deep and clear; but the fourth one is very  faint.\"    He followed the camel's footprints along the road for a long time. But  now and again he stopped and looked at the shrubs and bushes which  grew here and there, on both sides of the road.    \"Hello, that is strange!\" he suddenly said. \"The camel has eaten from  the bushes and shrubs here and there on the left side of the road, but  he hasn't eaten at all from those on the right side of the road.\"    He went on for some time longer, then suddenly stopped to look at the  road where the camel had walked.    \"Hello, this is also strange!\" he said. \"Here are a lot of _bees_  buzzing near the ground on the _right_ side of the road. And here are  a lot of _ants_ scrambling over the ground on the _left_ side of the  road.\"    \"Never mind about the camel, and the bees and the ants,\" the  policemen said impatiently. \"We want to know about the thief who stole  the money. You have not found any other footprints except the  camel's?\"    \"That is quite true,\" the clever man said. \"But as the _camel_ could  not steal the money, there must be a _man_ riding on the camel. He  must be the thief.\"    \"But why didn't the thief leave any footprints?\" the policemen asked.    \"Because he must have ridden his camel from the roadway right to the  edge of the grass,\" the clever man answered. \"Then he must have jumped  down upon the grass, where he knew he would not leave any footprint.  He must have walked very quietly on the grass up to the tree where the  traveler was sleeping, and stolen the money. Then he must have walked  back quietly to the camel and ridden off.\"    \"But what sort of a man is the thief?\" the police asked. \"How can we  find him, if you do not tell us what he is like?\"    \"I cannot tell you a thing about the thief, or what he looks like, as  he hasn't even left a footprint,\" the clever man answered. \"But I can  tell you _all about the camel_. The camel is _blind_ in his _right  eye_, and _lame_ in his _left hind foot_. And on his back he is  carrying two packages, one on each side; the package on the _right_  side has _honey_ in it, and the package on the _left_ side has _corn_  in it. So you must search for a man who is riding a camel loaded like  that. He is the thief.\"    So the police searched for a man who was riding a camel which was  blind in his right eye, lame in his left hind foot, and carrying honey  in a package on his right side, and corn in a package on his left  side. After following the camel's footprints on the ground for a long  time, the police at last came to a village.    They searched through the village, and found many men riding camels.  But there was only one man riding a camel blind in his right eye, lame  in left hind foot, and carrying honey on the right side, and corn on  the left side. So the police knew that he was the thief, and took him  before the judge. Then the thief said that it was quite true that he  stole the money.    Afterwards the judge turned to the clever man and asked him how he  knew all that about the camel.    \"You didn't _see_ the camel at all, but only his footprints,\" the  judge said. \"Then how did you know that the camel was blind in his  right eye, lame in his left hind foot, and carrying honey on the right  side, and corn on the left side?\"    \"It was quite simple,\" the clever man answered very modestly. \"First,  about the camel being blind in his right eye. He had nibbled at the  shrubs and bushes growing on the left side of the road, for at each  bite I found the leaves cut off clean by his teeth. On the right side  of the road there were also plenty of good shrubs and bushes, but the  camel had not taken a single bite at any of them. That showed that he  did not even _see_ those shrubs and bushes on his right side. And that  of course meant that his right eye was blind.\"    \"That is very clever of you,\" the judge said. \"But how did you know  that the camel was lame in his left hind foot?\"    \"That was just as simple,\" the clever man again answered very  modestly. \"As the camel walked along, the marks of his two front feet  and right hind foot were quite deep and clear on the ground. But the  mark of his left hind foot was very faint. That showed that the camel  was limping, and the left hind foot only just touched the ground. So I  knew that he was lame in that foot.\"    \"That is also very clever of you,\" the judge said. \"But how did you  know that the camel was carrying honey on his right side, and corn on  his left?\"    \"That was the simplest of all,\" the clever man answered most modestly.  \"As the camel was limping, nearly every step he took jerked the load  on his back. So a few drops of the honey fell to the ground from the  package on his right side, and a few grains of the corn fell to the  ground from the package on his left side.\"    \"But you could not see very well here and there on the ground just a  few drops of honey or just a few grains of corn?\" the judge said.    \"_I_ could not,\" the clever man answered, \"but the _bees_ and the  _ants_ could! On the right side of the road I found a swarm of bees  here and there; so I knew that they were trying to pick up the honey.  And on the left side of the road I saw a whole lot of ants here and  there; so I knew that they were trying to pick up and carry away the  grains of corn.\"    Now was it not really clever of that man to find all that out about  the camel, without ever seeing the camel before? But, as you  understand, he knew all about the _habits_ of different animals; and  so he knew what camels and bees and ants always do.          CHAPTER XIII    Bears      _Bears_ are such funny animals, at least some kinds of bears, that you  may like to know all about them.    Bears are found in many countries, and in some countries there are  several kinds of bears.    But you must remember this: _hardly any bear lives in the tropics_;  that means countries where the sun is almost overhead all the months  of the year, so that it is very hot all the time.    But why does not the bear usually live there? Can you guess?    Because the bear is a very _hairy_ animal; and his hair is just like a  thick coat, so that he cannot live where it is very hot all the time.    Of course, once upon a time the bear lived only in places where it was  very cold, and so he grew thick hair to keep out the cold; but now  that he _has_ a thick coat of hair, he cannot go down to hot countries  to live. He does not mind living in a cold country; and the colder the  country is, the thicker is his coat of hair.    What does the bear eat? Most kinds of bears eat berries, fruits, soft  roots of trees, and fish when they can catch it. One or two kinds of  bears eat other things also, which I shall tell you about very soon.
