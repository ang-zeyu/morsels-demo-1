If people once came to know the  operations of the Lord, in souls wholly resigned to His guiding, it  would fill them with reverential admiration and awe.    I saw that the purity of my state was like to be sullied by too great a  commerce with the creatures, so I made haste to finish what detained me  in Paris, in order to return to the country. \"Tis true, O my Lord, I  felt that Thou hadst given me strength enough to avoid the occasions of  evil--but when I had so far yielded as to get into them, I found I  could not resist the vain complaisances, and a number of other foibles  which they ensnared me into.\" The pain which I felt after my faults was  inexpressible. It was not an anguish that arose from any distinct idea  or conception, from any particular motive or affection--but a kind of  devouring fire which ceased not, till the fault was consumed and the  soul purified. It was a banishment of my soul from the presence of its  Beloved. I could have no access to Him, neither could I have any rest  out of Him. I knew not what to do. I was like the dove out of the ark,  which finding no rest for the soul of her foot, was constrained to  return to the ark; but, finding the window shut, could only fly about.  In the meantime, through an infidelity which will ever render me  culpable, I strove to find some satisfaction without, but could not.  This served to convince me of my folly and of the vanity of those  pleasures which are called innocent. When I was prevailed on to taste  them, I felt a strong repulse which, joined with my remorse for the  transgression, changed the diversion into torment. \"Oh, my Father,\"  said I, \"this is not Thee; and nothing else, beside Thee, can give  solid pleasure.\"    One day, as much through unfaithfulness as complaisance, I went to take  a walk at some of the public parks, rather from excess of vanity to  show myself than to take the pleasure of the place. Oh, my Lord! how  didst Thou make me sensible of this fault? But far from punishing me in  letting me partake of the amusement, Thou didst it in holding me so  close to Thyself, that I could give no attention to anything but my  fault and Thy displeasure. After this I was invited with some other  ladies to an entertainment at St. Cloud. Through vanity and weak  compliance, I yielded and went. The affair was magnificent; they,  though wise in the eye of the world, could relish it. I was filled with  bitterness. I could eat nothing, I could enjoy nothing. Oh, what tears!  For beyond three months my Beloved withdrew His favoring presence, and  I could see nothing but an angry God.    I was on this occasion, and in another journey which I took with my  husband into Touraine, like those animals destined for slaughter. On  certain days people adorn them with greens and flowers, and bring in  pomp into the city before they kill them. This weak beauty, on the eve  of decline, shone forth with new brightness, in order to become the  sooner extinct. I was shortly after afflicted with the smallpox.    One day as I walked to church, followed by a footman I was met by a  poor man. I went to give him alms; he thanked me but refused them and  then spoke to me in a wonderful manner of God and of divine things. He  displayed to me my whole heart, my love to God, my charity, my too  great fondness for my beauty and all my faults; he told me it was not  enough to avoid Hell, but that the Lord required of me the utmost  purity and height of perfection. My heart assented to his reproofs. I  heard him with silence and respect, his words penetrated my very soul.  When I arrived at the church I fainted away. I have never seen the man  since.          CHAPTER 14      My husband enjoying some intermission of his almost continual ailments,  had a mind to go to Orleans, and then into Touraine. In this journey my  vanity made its last blaze. I received abundance of visits and  applauses. But how clearly did I see the folly of men who are so taken  with vain beauty! I disliked the disposition, yet not that which caused  it, though I sometimes ardently desired to be delivered from it. The  continual combat of nature and grace cost me no small affliction.  Nature was pleased with public applause; grace made me dread it. What  augmented the temptation was that they esteemed in me virtue, joined  with youth and beauty. They did not know that all the virtue is only in  God, and His protection, and all the weakness in myself.    I went in search of confessors, to accuse myself of my failing, and to  bewail my backslidings. They were utterly insensible of my pain. They  esteemed what God condemned. They treated as a virtue what to me  appeared detestable in His sight. Far from measuring my faults by His  graces, they only considered what I was, in comparison of what I might  have been. Hence, instead of blaming me, they only flattered my pride.  They justified me in what incurred His rebuke, or only treated as a  slight fault what in me was highly displeasing to Him, from whom I had  received such signal mercies.    The heinousness of sins is not to be measured singly by their nature,  but also by the state of the person who commits them. The least  unfaithfulness in a spouse is more injurious to her husband, than far  greater ones in his domestics. I told them all the trouble I had been  under for not having entirely covered my neck. It was covered much more  than was covered by other women of my age. They assured me that I was  very modestly dressed. As my husband liked my dress there could be  nothing amiss in it. My inward Director taught me quite the contrary. I  had not courage enough to follow Him, and to dress myself differently  from others, at my age. My vanity furnished me with pretences seemingly  just for following fashions. If pastors knew what hurt they do in  humoring female vanity, they would be more severe against it! Had I  found but one person honest enough to deal plainly with me, I should  not have gone on. But my vanity, siding with the declared opinion of  all others, induced me to think them right, and my own scruples mere  fancy.    We met with accidents in this journey, sufficient to have terrified  anyone. Though corrupt nature prevailed so far as I have just  mentioned, yet my resignation to God was so strong, that I passed  fearless, even where there was apparently no possibility of escape. At  one time we got into a narrow pass, and did not perceive, until we were  too far advanced to draw back, that the road was undermined by the  river Loire, which ran beneath, and the banks had fallen in; so that in  some places the footmen were obliged to support one side of the  carriage. All those around me were terrified to the highest degree, yet  God kept me perfectly tranquil. I secretly rejoiced at the prospect of  losing my life by a singular stroke of His providence.    On my return, I went to see Mrs. Granger, to whom I related how it had  been with me while abroad. She strengthened and encouraged me to pursue  my first design. She advised me to cover my neck, which I have done  ever since notwithstanding the singularity of it.    The Lord, who had so long deferred the chastisement merited by such a  series of infidelities, now began to punish me for the abuse of his  grace. Sometimes I wished to retire to a convent, and thought it  lawful. I found wherein I was weak, and that my faults were always of  the same nature. I wished to hide myself in some cave, or to be  confined in a dreary prison, rather than enjoy a liberty by which I  suffered so much. Divine love gently drew me inward, and vanity dragged  me outward. My heart was rent asunder by the contest, as I neither gave  myself wholly up to the one nor the other.    I besought my God to deprive me of power to displease Him, and cried,  \"Art thou not strong enough wholly to eradicate this unjust duplicity  out of my heart?\" For my vanity broke forth when occasions offered; yet  I quickly returned to God. He, instead of repulsing or upbraiding me,  often received me with open arms, and gave me fresh testimonials of His  love. They filled me with the most painful reflections on my offense.  Though this wretched vanity was still so prevalent, yet my love to God  was such, that after my wanderings, I would rather have chosen His rod  than His caresses. His interests were more dear to me than my own, and  I wished He would have done Himself justice upon me. My heart was full  of grief and of love. I was stung to the quick for offending Him, who  showered His grace so profusely upon me. That those who know not God  should offend Him by sin is not to be wondered at, but that a heart  which loved Him more than itself, and so fully experienced His love,  should be seduced by propensities which it detests, is a cruel  martyrdom.    When I felt most strongly Thy presence, and Thy love, O Lord, said I,  how wonderfully Thou bestowest Thy favors on such a wretched creature,  who requites Thee only with ingratitude. For if anyone reads this life  with attention, he will see on God's part, nothing but goodness, mercy,  and love; on my part, nothing but weakness, sin and infidelity. I have  nothing to glory in but my infirmities and my unworthiness, since, in  that everlasting marriage-union thou hast made with me, I brought with  me nothing but weakness, sin and misery. How I rejoice to owe all to  Thee, and that Thou favorest my heart with a sight of the treasures and  boundless riches of Thy grace and love! Thou hast dealt by me, as if a  magnificent king should marry a poor slave, forget her slavery, give  her all the ornaments which may render her pleasing in his eyes, and  freely pardon her all the faults and ill qualities which her ignorance  and bad education had given her. This Thou hast made my case. My  poverty is become my riches, and in the extremity of my weakness I have  found my strength.

Silvia gave an impatient ejaculation. \"How can you take it so quietly,  Miss Renner?\" she asked. \"I confess it always stirs me up.\"    \"It wouldn't if you had the ballot,\" said the smaller woman. \"It's just  amusing, or tiresome, according to how well it is done. You women are  the worried and worrying Marthas; we are the Marys, who have chosen the  better part that shall not be taken away; we know it can't be, and this  is something like hearing people laboriously argue that the world is  flat with the sun revolving around it.\"    After the opening speech there were brief addresses by Dr. David Dearson  on the disastrous results to motherhood should women participate in the  active life of the nation; by the Reverend Jayson Yerkes on the Pauline  doctrine of the subserviency of the truly feminine woman; by Mrs.  Workman Werther on the decadence of feminine charm among women aping  men's interests in life, and Crawford Dorer, a labor leader, opposed the  movement because the natural timidity of woman would, he predicted, set  back all hope of militant progress for the workers of the world. The  \"Antis\" listened with a somewhat strained and puzzled attention, and a  group of working-women, out on strike, and sitting in the balcony, gave  an angry hiss, which was instantly suppressed. The last speaker, Mr.  Reuben Rice, was one of those wandering scribes who travel through the  West and write up suffrage from a Pullman-car window, and as he exposed  the weaknesses, the failures and the pitiful spectacle that voting women  make of themselves, he galvanized the audience into a semblance of real  life and interest.    Dr. Earl found the speeches entertaining if not enlightening, and after  the second, gave himself up to the silent enjoyment of collating the  arguments presented in juxtaposition. No sooner had one speaker  convinced his hearers that women would precipitate anarchy by their  radicalism than the next proved equally conclusively that an era of  dilettantism and millinery shop legislation would be the inevitable  result of woman suffrage; no sooner were they filled with the horror of  the degradation of politics by the class of women certain to participate  in it, than another speaker assured them that politics was already so  vile that any woman would be hopelessly contaminated who had anything to  do with the gangrenous growth, and yet another showed that women  wouldn't vote anyhow. It was all he could do to control the muscles of  his face when the Reverend Mr. Yerkes told them in one sentence of the  dissension that would rend families and in the next that married women  simply voted as their husbands dictated, and he could not repress a  smile when the doctor and the professor made it clear that if woman is  to reproduce the race she must not be expected to do anything else, only  to have Mrs. Werther show how woman must be free to take part in the  ennobling activities of the world, philanthropy, charity, etc., if she  is to \"bring to motherhood that crown which is the glory of the race,\"  and much more of the same sort. He heard the ancient argument about  bullets and ballots, and in the same breath his attention was called to  Semiramis conquering Assyria, the Amazons invading Asia, the triumph of  Sappho in song, Aspasia in the salon, Deborah among the Judges of  Israel, George Eliot in literature, and a host of others who had won  distinction.    The audience was told that it was entirely proper to agitate, cajole,  coax, beseech, threaten, bully and browbeat men into voting for  candidates and measures desired by the women; anything that stopped  short of blackmail and personal intimidation bore the hallmark of  refined femininity, but to take two minutes to accomplish results for  themselves by depositing a ballot on election day meant everlasting  damnation to all feminine traits! And Leonora patted her pretty little  hands, and looked up to Earl for approval, feeling that at last he must  see that Silvia and her cohorts were routed horse and foot.    When the attack upon Western women was well under way, and Mr. Rice, a  dapper little chap, looking like a freshman from high school, was  rolling out his arraignment of Denver women in particular as typical of  the nethermost depths to which the voting female may descend, Carroll  Renner wrote a few lines on a bit of paper, and gave it to one of the  ushers, and a few minutes later she had the satisfaction of watching the  portly Mrs. Briglow-Jorliss read it. When Mr. Rice had concluded his  diatribe, the lady stated in dulcet tones that Mr. Frank Earl was said  to be in the audience, and as he lived in Denver, and was known to have  strong views on this question, there was an urgent request that he  should come to the platform, that they might know from one who had long  witnessed with regret the deteriorating effects of woman suffrage that  nothing that they had heard was in any way exaggerated. She vouched for  Earl as one whom she had known since his boyhood, a member of one of the  most highly respected families in New York, and who had never failed to  reply when she had needed statistics from the field of woman's  dethronement.    There was a bustle and stir over the audience, and John Earl looked a  good deal startled, while Leonora was openly delighted. An excellent  speaker, and a trained debater, the occasion had no terrors for Frank  Earl. In fact, he confessed to himself as he made his way to the  platform, he had not had so much fun as he expected to enjoy in the next  fifteen minutes for many a long day. He was introduced with many rather  florid expressions, and began by stating his position calmly,  unmistakably, as opposed to the extension of the franchise to women. He  then made a few complimentary references to those ladies who nobly put  aside their own devotion to the home, the sphere they adorned so  admirably, in order to save their misguided suffrage sisters from the  evil effects of their mistaken zeal.    There were a good many suffragists and some suffragettes in that  anti-suffrage meeting, and Frank saw that the chilly audience had at  last thawed, melted, warmed up and was rapidly approaching the point  where it might reasonably be expected to boil over.    \"I am unalterably against the extension of the franchise to women,\" he  repeated, and went on, \"but my reasons for this opposition are concrete  and practical rather than abstract and theoretical, and are based upon  the experience I have gained from my residence in Colorado. I am also  opposed to it because it is all too evident that the suffrage should be  restricted rather than extended. The ballot should be the reward of  intelligence, education, and a comprehension of the great political  problems of the nation.\"    \"Give us the truth,\" some one at the left of the parquet cried.    \"I shall,\" he said, \"and that necessitates correcting a few impressions  which seem to me at variance with the facts. If it were true that women  would not vote, or would vote as directed by the male members of their  families, I should not so much deprecate giving them the ballot; but  neither contention is true. Women do vote, and what is worse, they vote  in steadily increasing numbers. Out of seventy thousand votes cast at  the last election in my city a little less than half of them were cast  by women, and judging from the results, I must say that the men of their  families had very little influence with them. The possession of the  franchise has developed the secretive instinct among women; they no  longer confide their intentions to their doting husbands; they listen to  their words of wisdom and then--they vote the secret ballot as they  please.\"    There was a wave of laughter that swelled into a gleeful sort of shout  of mirth, but with an air of the most grieved surprise the speaker  turned wonderingly to Mrs. Briglow-Jorliss, who still beamed upon him,  though she was looking worried.    \"But surely, Mr. Earl,\" she said, \"when the disagreeable duty is thrust  upon them, the conservative women do what they can to protect the  interests of the State?\"    He shook his head sadly.    \"This is one of the most frightful discoveries we have made since women  began to vote. When Mr. Dorer speaks of the innate conservatism of women  he shows that he is not conversant with the woman movement. It is true  that there are a few intensely partisan women, who can be held by party  ties, but the rank and file observe no such allegiance. They read and  study, but in addition they go to the legislative halls, and there they  see that both parties make and break promises with equal facility, and  what is the result?\"    \"Well, what is it?\" cried an impatient feminine voice.    \"I hardly know how to break it to you,\" he said, \"but the result is  revolt, revolt all along the line. Yes, ladies; women, lovely, refined,  gentle, educated women utterly refuse to be dictated to by political  leaders, and openly sneer at ward bosses. They can't be kept in line.  They no longer sing the sweet strains of 'The land of the free and the  home of the brave.' On the contrary, they raise the battle cry, 'Let  independence be our boast,' and in spite of the passionate pleas of  their natural leaders, they go on record for the most radical  legislation. Why, I'm told that nearly every so-called progressive law  enacted in my State has been passed by their continued efforts.    \"They have no conception of the ideal of government laid down by  Hamilton; they will submit to neither checks nor balances, and would  subvert the whole scheme of"]]]
