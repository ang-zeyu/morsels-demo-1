N. Hughes, of  Winchester, who purchased at a sale at Leeds Castle, Kent, a box  apparently filled with old coloured paving-tiles; on removing the upper  layers he found a large mass of manuscripts of the time of the Civil  wars, evidently thus packed for concealment; they have since been  published, and add most valuable information to this interesting period  of English history.]          SKETCHES OF CRITICISM.      It may, perhaps, be some satisfaction to show the young writer, that the  most celebrated ancients have been as rudely subjected to the tyranny of  criticism as the moderns. Detraction has ever poured the \"waters of  bitterness.\"    It was given out, that Homer had stolen from anterior poets whatever was  most remarkable in the Iliad and Odyssey. Naucrates even points out the  source in the library at Memphis in a temple of Vulcan, which according  to him the blind bard completely pillaged. Undoubtedly there were good  poets before Homer; how absurd to conceive that an elaborate poem could  be the first! We have indeed accounts of anterior poets, and apparently  of epics, before Homer; AElian notices Syagrus, who composed a poem on  the Siege of Troy; and Suidas the poem of Corinnus, from which it is  said Homer greatly borrowed. Why did Plato so severely condemn the great  bard, and imitate him?    Sophocles was brought to trial by his children as a lunatic; and some,  who censured the inequalities of this poet, have also condemned the  vanity of Pindar; the rough verses of AEschylus; and Euripides, for the  conduct of his plots.    Socrates, considered as the wisest and the most moral of men, Cicero  treated as an usurer, and the pedant Athenaeus as illiterate; the latter  points out as a Socratic folly our philosopher disserting on the nature  of justice before his judges, who were so many thieves. The malignant  buffoonery of Aristophanes treats him much worse; but he, as Jortin  says, was a great wit, but a great rascal.    Plato--who has been called, by Clement of Alexandria, the Moses of  Athens; the philosopher of the Christians, by Arnobius; and the god of  philosophers, by Cicero--Athenaeus accuses of envy; Theopompus of lying;  Suidas of avarice; Aulus Gellius, of robbery; Porphyry, of incontinence;  and Aristophanes, of impiety.    Aristotle, whose industry composed more than four hundred volumes, has  not been less spared by the critics; Diogenes Laertius, Cicero, and  Plutarch, have forgotten nothing that can tend to show his ignorance,  his ambition, and his vanity.    It has been said, that Plato was so envious of the celebrity of  Democritus, that he proposed burning all his works; but that Amydis and  Clinias prevented it, by remonstrating that there were copies of them  everywhere; and Aristotle was agitated by the same passion against all  the philosophers his predecessors.    Virgil is destitute of invention, if we are to give credit to Pliny,  Carbilius, and Seneca. Caligula has absolutely denied him even  mediocrity; Herennus has marked his faults; and Perilius Faustinus has  furnished a thick volume with his plagiarisms. Even the author of his  apology has confessed, that he has stolen from Homer his greatest  beauties; from Apollonius Rhodius, many of his pathetic passages; from  Nicander, hints for his Georgies; and this does not terminate the  catalogue.    Horace censures the coarse humour of Plautus; and Horace, in his turn,  has been blamed for the free use he made of the Greek minor poets.    The majority of the critics regard Pliny's Natural History only as a  heap of fables; and Pliny cannot bear with Diodorus and Vopiscus; and in  one comprehensive criticism, treats all the historians as narrators of  fables.    Livy has been reproached for his aversion to the Gauls; Dion, for his  hatred of the republic; Velleius Paterculus, for speaking too kindly of  the vices of Tiberius; and Herodotus and Plutarch, for their excessive  partiality to their own country: while the latter has written an entire  treatise on the malignity of Herodotus. Xenophon and Quintus Curtius  have been considered rather as novelists than historians; and Tacitus  has been censured for his audacity in pretending to discover the  political springs and secret causes of events. Dionysius of  Harlicarnassus has made an elaborate attack on Thucydides for the  unskilful choice of his subject, and his manner of treating it.  Dionysius would have nothing written but what tended to the glory of his  country and the pleasure of the reader--as if history were a song! adds  Hobbes, who also shows a personal motive in this attack. The same  Dionysius severely criticises the style of Xenophon, who, he says, in  attempting to elevate his style, shows himself incapable of supporting  it. Polybius has been blamed for his frequent introduction of  reflections which interrupt the thread of his narrative; and Sallust has  been blamed by Cato for indulging his own private passions, and  studiously concealing many of the glorious actions of Cicero. The Jewish  historian, Josephus, is accused of not having designed his history for  his own people so much as for the Greeks and Romans, whom he takes the  utmost care never to offend. Josephus assumes a Roman name, Flavius; and  considering his nation as entirely subjugated, to make them appear  dignified to their conquerors, alters what he himself calls the _Holy  books_. It is well known how widely he differs from the scriptural  accounts. Some have said of Cicero, that there is no connexion, and to  adopt their own figures, no _blood_ and _nerves_, in what his admirers  so warmly extol. Cold in his extemporaneous effusions, artificial in his  exordiums, trifling in his strained raillery, and tiresome in his  digressions. This is saying a good deal about Cicero.    Quintilian does not spare Seneca; and Demosthenes, called by Cicero the  prince of orators, has, according to Hermippus, more of art than of  nature. To Demades, his orations appear too much laboured; others have  thought him too dry; and, if we may trust AEschines, his language is by  no means pure.    The Attic Nights of Aulus Gellius, and the Deipnosophists of Athenaeus,  while they have been extolled by one party, have been degraded by  another. They have been considered as botchers of rags and remnants;  their diligence has not been accompanied by judgment; and their taste  inclined more to the frivolous than to the useful. Compilers, indeed,  are liable to a hard fate, for little distinction is made in their  ranks; a disagreeable situation, in which honest Burton seems to have  been placed; for he says of his work, that some will cry out, \"This is a  thinge of meere industrie; a _collection_ without wit or invention; a  very toy! So men are valued; their labours vilified by fellowes of no  worth themselves, as things of nought: Who could not have done as much?  Some understande too little, and some too much.\"    Should we proceed with this list to our own country, and to our own  times, it might be curiously augmented, and show the world what men the  Critics are! but, perhaps, enough has been said to soothe irritated  genius, and to shame fastidious criticism. \"I would beg the critics to  remember,\" the Earl of Roscommon writes, in his preface to Horace's Art  of Poetry, \"that Horace owed his favour and his fortune to the character  given of him by Virgil and Varus; that Fundanius and Pollio are still  valued by what Horace says of them; and that, in their golden age, there  was a good understanding among the ingenious; and those who were the  most esteemed, were the best natured.\"          THE PERSECUTED LEARNED.      Those who have laboured most zealously to instruct mankind have been  those who have suffered most from ignorance; and the discoverers of new  arts and sciences have hardly ever lived to see them accepted by the  world. With a noble perception of his own genius, Lord Bacon, in his  prophetic Will, thus expresses himself: \"For my name and memory, I leave  it to men's charitable speeches, and to foreign nations, and the next  ages.\" Before the times of Galileo and Harvey the world believed in the  stagnation of the blood, and the diurnal immovability of the earth; and  for denying these the one was persecuted and the other ridiculed.    The intelligence and the virtue of Socrates were punished with death.  Anaxagoras, when he attempted to propagate a just notion of the Supreme  Being, was dragged to prison. Aristotle, after a long series of  persecution, swallowed poison. Heraclitus, tormented by his countrymen,  broke off all intercourse with men. The great geometricians and  chemists, as Gerbert, Roger Bacon, and Cornelius Agrippa, were abhorred  as magicians. Pope Gerbert, as Bishop Otho gravely relates, obtained the  pontificate by having given himself up entirely to the devil: others  suspected him, too, of holding an intercourse with demons; but this was  indeed a devilish age!    Virgilius, Bishop of Saltzburg, having asserted that there existed  antipodes, the Archbishop of Mentz declared him a heretic; and the Abbot  Trithemius, who was fond of improving steganography or the art of secret  writing, having published several curious works on this subject, they  were condemned, as works full of diabolical mysteries; and Frederic  II., Elector Palatine, ordered Trithemius's original work, which was in  his library, to be publicly burnt.    Galileo was condemned at Rome publicly to disavow sentiments, the truth  of which must have been to him abundantly manifest. \"Are these then my  judges?\" he exclaimed, in retiring from the inquisitors, whose ignorance  astonished him. He was imprisoned, and visited by Milton, who tells us,  he was then _poor_ and _old_. The confessor of his widow, taking  advantage of her piety, perused the MSS. of this great"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2162"],[0,"Anarchism and Other Essays (#15)"],[1,"began  the hounding down of the helpless wives and orphans, by ordering them  out of the wretched Company houses.    The whole country was aroused over these inhuman outrages.  Hundreds  of voices were raised in protest, calling on Frick to desist, not to  go too far.  Yes, hundreds of people protested,--as one objects to  annoying flies.  Only one there was who actively responded to the  outrage at Homestead,--Alexander Berkman.  Yes, he was an Anarchist.  He gloried in that fact, because it was the only force that made the  discord between his spiritual longing and the world without at all  bearable.  Yet not Anarchism, as such, but the brutal slaughter of  the eleven steel workers was the urge for Alexander Berkman's act,  his attempt on the life of Henry Clay Frick.    The record of European acts of political violence affords numerous  and striking instances of the influence of environment upon sensitive  human beings.    The court speech of Vaillant, who, in 1894, exploded a bomb in the  Paris Chamber of Deputies, strikes the true keynote of the psychology  of such acts:    \"Gentlemen, in a few minutes you are to deal your blow, but in  receiving your verdict I shall have at least the satisfaction of  having wounded the existing society, that cursed society in which one  may see a single man spending, uselessly, enough to feed thousands of  families; an infamous society which permits a few individuals to  monopolize all the social wealth, while there are hundreds of  thousands of unfortunates who have not even the bread that is not  refused to dogs, and while entire families are committing suicide for  want of the necessities of life.    \"Ah, gentlemen, if the governing classes could go down among the  unfortunates!  But no, they prefer to remain deaf to their appeals.  It seems that a fatality impels them, like the royalty of the  eighteenth century, toward the precipice which will engulf them, for  woe be to those who remain deaf to the cries of the starving, woe to  those who, believing themselves of superior essence, assume the right  to exploit those beneath them!  There comes a time when the people no  longer reason; they rise like a hurricane, and pass away like a  torrent.  Then we see bleeding heads impaled on pikes.    \"Among the exploited, gentlemen, there are two classes of  individuals: Those of one class, not realizing what they are and what  they might be, take life as it comes, believe that they are born to  be slaves, and content themselves with the little that is given them  in exchange for their labor.  But there are others, on the contrary,  who think, who study, and who, looking about them, discover social  iniquities.  Is it their fault if they see clearly and suffer at  seeing others suffer?  Then they throw themselves into the struggle,  and make themselves the bearers of the popular claims.    \"Gentlemen, I am one of these last.  Wherever I have gone, I have  seen unfortunates bent beneath the yoke of capital.  Everywhere I  have seen the same wounds causing tears of blood to flow, even in the  remoter parts of the inhabited districts of South America, where I  had the right to believe that he who was weary of the pains of  civilization might rest in the shade of the palm trees and there  study nature.  Well, there even, more than elsewhere, I have seen  capital come, like a vampire, to suck the last drop of blood of the  unfortunate pariahs.    \"Then I came back to France, where it was reserved for me to see my  family suffer atrociously.  This was the last drop in the cup of my  sorrow.  Tired of leading this life of suffering and cowardice, I  carried this bomb to those who are primarily responsible for social  sufferings.    \"I am reproached with the wounds of those who were hit by my  projectiles.  Permit me to point out in passing that, if the  bourgeois had not massacred or caused massacres during the  Revolution, it is probable that they would still be under the yoke of  the nobility.  On the other hand, figure up the dead and wounded on  Tonquin, Madagascar, Dahomey, adding thereto the thousands, yes,  millions of unfortunates who die in the factories, the mines, and  wherever the grinding power of capital is felt.  Add also those who  die of hunger, and all this with the assent of our Deputies.  Beside  all this, of how little weight are the reproaches now brought against  me!    \"It is true that one does not efface the other; but, after all, are  we not acting on the defensive when we respond to the blows which we  receive from above?  I know very well that I shall be told that I  ought to have confined myself to speech for the vindication of the  people's claims.  But what can you expect!  It takes a loud voice to  make the deaf hear.  Too long have they answered our voices by  imprisonment, the rope, rifle volleys.  Make no mistake; the  explosion of my bomb is not only the cry of the rebel Vaillant, but  the cry of an entire class which vindicates its rights, and which  will soon add acts to words.  For, be sure of it, in vain will they  pass laws.  The ideas of the thinkers will not halt; just as, in the  last century, all the governmental forces could not prevent the  Diderots and the Voltaires from spreading emancipating ideas among  the people, so all the existing governmental forces will not prevent  the Reclus, the Darwins, the Spencers, the Ibsens, the Mirbeaus, from  spreading the ideas of justice and liberty which will annihilate the  prejudices that hold the mass in ignorance.  And these ideas,  welcomed by the unfortunate, will flower in acts of revolt as they  have done in me, until the day when the disappearance of authority  shall permit all men to organize freely according to their choice,  when we shall each be able to enjoy the product of his labor, and  when those moral maladies called prejudices shall vanish, permitting  human beings to live in harmony, having no other desire than to study  the sciences and love their fellows.    \"I conclude, gentlemen, by saying that a society in which one sees  such social inequalities as we see all about us, in which we see  every day suicides caused by poverty, prostitution flaring at every  street corner,--a society whose principal monuments are barracks and  prisons,--such a society must be transformed as soon as possible, on  pain of being eliminated, and that speedily, from the human race.  Hail to him who labors, by no matter what means, for this  transformation!  It is this idea that has guided me in my duel with  authority, but as in this duel I have only wounded my adversary, it  is now its turn to strike me.    \"Now, gentlemen, to me it matters little what penalty you may  inflict, for, looking at this assembly with the eyes of reason, I can  not help smiling to see you, atoms lost in matter, and reasoning only  because you possess a prolongation of the spinal marrow, assume the  right to judge one of your fellows.    \"Ah! gentlemen, how little a thing is your assembly and your verdict  in the history of humanity; and human history, in its turn, is  likewise a very little thing in the whirlwind which bears it through  immensity, and which is destined to disappear, or at least to be  transformed, in order to begin again the same history and the same  facts, a veritably perpetual play of cosmic forces renewing and  transferring themselves forever.\"    Will anyone say that Vaillant was an ignorant, vicious man, or a  lunatic?  Was not his mind singularly clear, analytic?  No wonder  that the best intellectual forces of France spoke in his behalf, and  signed the petition to President Carnot, asking him to commute  Vaillant's death sentence.    Carnot would listen to no entreaty; he insisted on more than a pound  of flesh, he wanted Vaillant's life, and then--the inevitable  happened: President Carnot was killed.  On the handle of the stiletto  used by the ATTENTATER was engraved, significantly,                                VAILLANT!      Santa Caserio was an Anarchist.  He could have gotten away, saved  himself; but he remained, he stood the consequences.    His reasons for the act are set forth in so simple, dignified, and  childlike manner that one is reminded of the touching tribute paid  Caserio by his teacher of the little village school, Ada Negri, the  Italian poet, who spoke of him as a sweet, tender plant, of too fine  and sensitive texture to stand the cruel strain of the world.    \"Gentlemen of the Jury!  I do not propose to make a defense, but only  an explanation of my deed.    \"Since my early youth I began to learn that present society is badly  organized, so badly that every day many wretched men commit suicide,  leaving women and children in the most terrible distress.  Workers,  by thousands, seek for work and can not find it.  Poor families beg  for food and shiver with cold; they suffer the greatest misery; the  little ones ask their miserable mothers for food, and the mothers  can not give them, because they have nothing.  The few things  which the home contained have already been sold or pawned.  All they  can do is beg alms; often they are arrested as vagabonds.    \"I went away from my native place because I was frequently moved to  tears at seeing little girls of eight or ten years obliged to work  fifteen hours a day for the paltry pay of twenty centimes.  Young  women of eighteen or twenty also work fifteen hours daily, for a  mockery of remuneration.  And that happens not only to my fellow  countrymen, but to all the workers, who sweat the whole day long for  a crust of bread, while their labor produces wealth in abundance.  The workers are obliged to live under the most wretched conditions,  and their food consists of a little bread, a few spoonfuls of rice,  and water; so by the time they are thirty or forty years old, they  are exhausted, and go to die in the hospitals.  Besides, in  consequence of bad food and overwork, these unhappy creatures are, by  hundreds,"]]]
