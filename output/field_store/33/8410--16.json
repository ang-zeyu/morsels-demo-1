They should form a fine double  star, the Earth being a brilliant orb of first magnitude, and the Moon  of third, a charming couple, and admired doubtless as an enchanted and  privileged abode.    It is at midnight during the oppositions of the Earth with the Sun that  our planet is the most beautiful and brilliant, as is Jupiter for  ourselves. The constellations are the same, viewed from Mercury or from  the Earth.    But is this little solar planet inhabited? We do not yet know. We can  only reply: why not?      VENUS    When the sunset atmosphere is crimson with the glorious rays of the King  of Orbs, and all Nature assumes the brooding veil of twilight, the most  indifferent eyes are often attracted and captivated by the presence of a  star that is almost dazzling, and illuminates with its white and limpid  light the heavens darkened by the disappearance of the God of Day.    Hail, Venus, Queen of the Heavens! the \"Shepherd's Star,\" gentle mother  of the loves, goddess of beauty, eternally adored and cherished, sung  and immortalized upon Earth, by poets and artists. Her splendid  brilliancy attracted notice from earliest antiquity, and we find her,  radiant and charming, in the works of the ancients, who erected altars  to her and adorned their poetry with her grace and beauty. Homer calls  her Callisto the Beautiful; Cicero names her Vesper, the evening star,  and Lucifer, the star of the morning--for it was with this divinity as  with Mercury. For a long while she was regarded as two separate planets,  and it was only when it came to be observed that the evening and the  morning star were always in periodic succession, that the identity of  the orb was recognized.    Her radiant splendor created her mythological personality, just as the  agility of Mercury created that of the messenger of the gods.    We do not see her aerial chariot in the Heavens drawn by a flight of  doves with white and fluttering wings, but we follow the lustrous orb  led on through space by solar attraction. And in the beautiful evenings  when she is at her greatest distance from our Sun, the whole world  admires this white and dazzling Venus reigning as sovereign over our  twilight[10] for hours after sunset, and in addition to the _savants_  who are practically occupied with astronomy, millions of eyes are raised  to this celestial splendor, and for a moment millions of human beings  feel some curiosity about the mysteries of the Infinite. The brutalities  of daily life would fain petrify our dreams, but thought is not yet  stifled to the point of checking all aspirations after eternal truth,  and when we gaze at the starry sky it is hard not to ask ourselves the  nature of those other worlds, and the place occupied by our own planet  in the vast concert of sidereal harmony.    [Illustration: FIG. 36.--The Evening Star.]    Even through a small telescope, Venus offers remarkable phases.    [Illustration: FIG. 37.--Successive phases of Venus.]    Fig. 37 gives some notion of the succession of these, and of the  planet's variations in magnitude during its journey round the Sun.  Imagine it to be rotating in a year of 224 days, 16 hours, 49 minutes, 8  seconds at a distance of 108 million kilometers (67,000,000 miles), the  Earth being at 149 million kilometers (93,000,000 miles). Like Mercury,  at certain periods it passes between the Sun and ourselves, and as its  illuminated hemisphere is of course turned toward the orb of day, we at  those times perceive only a sharp and very luminous crescent. At such  periods Venus is entirely, so to say, against the Sun, and presents to  us her greatest apparent dimension (Fig. 38). Sometimes, again, like  Mercury, she passes immediately in front of the Sun, forming a perfectly  round black spot; this happened on December 8, 1874, and December 6,  1882; and will recur on June 7, 2004, and June 5, 2012. These transits  have been utilized in celestial geometry in measuring the distance of  the Sun.    You will readily divine that the distance of Venus varies considerably  according to her position in relation to the Earth: when she is between  the Sun and ourselves she is nearest to our world; but it is just at  those times that we see least of her surface, because she exhibits to us  only a slender crescent. Terrestrial astronomers are accordingly very  badly placed for the study of her physical constitution. The best  observations can be made when she is situated to right or left of the  Sun, and shows us about half her illuminated disk--during the day for  choice, because at night there is too much irradiation from her dazzling  light.    These phases were discovered by Galileo, in 1610. His observations were  among the first that confirmed the veracity of the system of Copernicus,  affording an evident example of the movement of the planets round the  sun. They are often visible to the unaided eye with good sight, either  at dusk, or through light clouds.    [Illustration: FIG. 38.--Venus at greatest brilliancy.]    Venus, surrounded by a highly dense and rarefied atmosphere, which  increases the difficulties of observing her surface, might be called the  twin sister of the Earth, so similar are the dimensions of the two  worlds. But, strange as it may seem to the many admirers, who are ready  to hail in her an abode of joy and happiness, it is most probable that  this planet, attractive as she is at a distance, would be a less  desirable habitation than our floating island. In fact, the atmosphere  of Venus is perpetually covered with cloud, so that the weather there  must be always foggy. No definite geographical configuration can be  discovered on her, despite the hopes of the eighteenth-century  astronomers. We are not even sure that she rotates upon herself, so  contradictory are the observations, and so hard is it to distinguish  anything clearly upon her surface. A single night of observation  suffices to show the rotation of Mars or of Jupiter; but the beautiful  Evening Star remains obstinately veiled from our curiosity.    Several astronomers, and not the least considerable, think that the  tides produced by the Sun upon her seas, or globe in its state of  pristine fluidity, must have been strong enough to seize and fix her, as  the Earth did for the Moon, thus obliging her to present always the same  face to the Sun. Certain telescopic observations would even seem to  confirm this theoretical deduction from the calculations of celestial  mechanics.    The author ventures to disagree with this opinion, its apparent  probability notwithstanding, because he has invariably received a  contrary impression from all his telescopic observations. He has quite  recently (spring of 1903) repeated these observations. Choosing a  remarkably clear and perfectly calm atmosphere, he examined the splendid  planet several times with great attention in the field of the telescope.  The right or eastern border (reversed image) was dulled by the  atmosphere of Venus; this is the line of separation between day and  night. Beneath, at the extreme northern edge, he was attracted on each  occasion by a small white patch, a little whiter than the rest of the  surface of the planet, surrounded by a light-gray penumbra, giving the  exact effect of a polar snow, very analogous to that observed at the  poles of Mars. To the author this white spot on the boreal horn of  Venus does not appear to be due to an effect of contrast, as has  sometimes been supposed.    Now, if the globe of Venus has poles, it must turn upon itself.    Unfortunately it has proved impossible to distinguish any sign upon the  disk, indicative of the direction and speed of its rotary movement,  although these observations were made, with others, under excellent  conditions.--Three o'clock in the afternoon, brilliant sun, sky clear  blue, the planet but little removed from the meridian--at which time it  is less dazzling than in the evening.    There is merely the impression; but it is so definite as to prevent the  author from adopting the new hypothesis, in virtue of which the planet,  as it gravitates round the Sun, presents always the same hemisphere.    If this hypothesis were a reality, Venus would certainly be a very  peculiar world. Eternal day on the one side; eternal night on the other.  Maximum light and heat at the center of the hemisphere perpetually  turned to the Sun; maximum cold and center of night at the antipodes.  This icy hemisphere would possibly be uninhabitable, but the resources  of Nature are so prodigious, and the law of Life is so imperious, so  persistent, under the most disadvantageous and deplorable terrestrial  conditions, that it would be transcending our rights to declare an  impossibility of existence, even in this eternal night. The currents of  the atmosphere would no doubt suffice to set up perpetual changes of  temperature between the two hemispheres, in comparison with which our  trade-winds would be the lightest of breezes.    Yes, mystery still reigns upon this adjacent earth, and the most  powerful instruments of the observatories of the whole world have been  unable to solve it. All we know is that the diameter, surface, volume  and mass of this planet, and its weight at the surface, do not differ  sensibly from those that characterize our own globe: that this planet is  sister to our own, and of the same order, hence probably formed of the  same elements. We further know that, as seen from Venus (Fig. 39), the  Earth on which we live is a magnificent star, a double orb more  brilliant even than when viewed from Mercury. It is a dazzling orb of  first magnitude, accompanied by its moon, a star of the second and a  half magnitude.    And thus the worlds float on in space, distant symbols of hopes not  realized on any one of them, all at different stages of their degree of  evolution, representing an ever-growing progress "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2527"],[0,"The Sorrows of Young Werther (#15)"],[1," put his arms  around her slender waist!    And shall I avow it? Why should I not, Wilhelm? She would have been  happier with me than with him. Albert is not the man to satisfy the  wishes of such a heart. He wants a certain sensibility; he wants--in  short, their hearts do not beat in unison. How often, my dear friend,  I'm reading a passage from some interesting book, when my heart and  Charlotte's seemed to meet, and in a hundred other instances when our  sentiments were unfolded by the story of some fictitious character, have  I felt that we were made for each other! But, dear Wilhelm, he loves her  with his whole soul; and what does not such a love deserve?    I have been interrupted by an insufferable visit. I have dried my tears,  and composed my thoughts. Adieu, my best friend!    AUGUST 4.    I am not alone unfortunate. All men are disappointed in their hopes, and  deceived in their expectations. I have paid a visit to my good old woman  under the lime-trees. The eldest boy ran out to meet me: his exclamation  of joy brought out his mother, but she had a very melancholy look. Her  first word was, \"Alas! dear sir, my little John is dead.\" He was the  youngest of her children. I was silent. \"And my husband has returned  from Switzerland without any money; and, if some kind people had not  assisted him, he must have begged his way home. He was taken ill with  fever on his journey.\" I could answer nothing, but made the little one  a present. She invited me to take some fruit: I complied, and left the  place with a sorrowful heart.    AUGUST 21.    My sensations are constantly changing. Sometimes a happy prospect opens  before me; but alas! it is only for a moment; and then, when I am  lost in reverie, I cannot help saying to myself, \"If Albert were  to die?--Yes, she would become--and I should be\"--and so I pursue a  chimera, till it leads me to the edge of a precipice at which I shudder.    When I pass through the same gate, and walk along the same road which  first conducted me to Charlotte, my heart sinks within me at the change  that has since taken place. All, all, is altered! No sentiment, no  pulsation of my heart, is the same. My sensations are such as would  occur to some departed prince whose spirit should return to visit the  superb palace which he had built in happy times, adorned with costly  magnificence, and left to a beloved son, but whose glory he should find  departed, and its halls deserted and in ruins.    SEPTEMBER 3.    I sometimes cannot understand how she can love another, how she dares  love another, when I love nothing in this world so completely, so  devotedly, as I love her, when I know only her, and have no other  possession.    SEPTEMBER 4.    It is even so! As nature puts on her autumn tints it becomes autumn with  me and around me. My leaves are sere and yellow, and the neighbouring  trees are divested of their foliage. Do you remember my writing to you  about a peasant boy shortly after my arrival here? I have just made  inquiries about him in Walheim. They say he has been dismissed from his  service, and is now avoided by every one. I met him yesterday on the  road, going to a neighbouring village. I spoke to him, and he told me  his story. It interested me exceedingly, as you will easily understand  when I repeat it to you. But why should I trouble you? Why should I  not reserve all my sorrow for myself? Why should I continue to give you  occasion to pity and blame me? But no matter: this also is part of my  destiny.    At first the peasant lad answered my inquiries with a sort of subdued  melancholy, which seemed to me the mark of a timid disposition; but, as  we grew to understand each other, he spoke with less reserve, and openly  confessed his faults, and lamented his misfortune. I wish, my dear  friend, I could give proper expression to his language. He told me  with a sort of pleasurable recollection, that, after my departure, his  passion for his mistress increased daily, until at last he neither knew  what he did nor what he said, nor what was to become of him. He could  neither eat nor drink nor sleep: he felt a sense of suffocation; he  disobeyed all orders, and forgot all commands involuntarily; he seemed  as if pursued by an evil spirit, till one day, knowing that his mistress  had gone to an upper chamber, he had followed, or, rather, been drawn  after her. As she proved deaf to his entreaties, he had recourse to  violence. He knows not what happened; but he called God to witness that  his intentions to her were honourable, and that he desired nothing more  sincerely than that they should marry, and pass their lives together.  When he had come to this point, he began to hesitate, as if there  was something which he had not courage to utter, till at length he  acknowledged with some confusion certain little confidences she had  encouraged, and liberties she had allowed. He broke off two or three  times in his narration, and assured me most earnestly that he had  no wish to make her bad, as he termed it, for he loved her still as  sincerely as ever; that the tale had never before escaped his lips,  and was only now told to convince me that he was not utterly lost and  abandoned. And here, my dear friend, I must commence the old song which  you know I utter eternally. If I could only represent the man as he  stood, and stands now before me, could I only give his true expressions,  you would feel compelled to sympathise in his fate. But enough: you,  who know my misfortune and my disposition, can easily comprehend  the attraction which draws me toward every unfortunate being, but  particularly toward him whose story I have recounted.    On perusing this letter a second time, I find I have omitted the  conclusion of my tale; but it is easily supplied. She became reserved  toward him, at the instigation of her brother who had long hated him,  and desired his expulsion from the house, fearing that his sister's  second marriage might deprive his children of the handsome fortune they  expected from her; as she is childless. He was dismissed at length; and  the whole affair occasioned so much scandal, that the mistress dared not  take him back, even if she had wished it. She has since hired another  servant, with whom, they say, her brother is equally displeased, and  whom she is likely to marry; but my informant assures me that he himself  is determined not to survive such a catastrophe.    This story is neither exaggerated nor embellished: indeed, I have  weakened and impaired it in the narration, by the necessity of using the  more refined expressions of society.    This love, then, this constancy, this passion, is no poetical fiction.  It is actual, and dwells in its greatest purity amongst that class of  mankind whom we term rude, uneducated. We are the educated, not the  perverted. But read this story with attention, I implore you. I am  tranquil to-day, for I have been employed upon this narration: you see  by my writing that I am not so agitated as usual. I read and re-read  this tale, Wilhelm: it is the history of your friend! My fortune has  been and will be similar; and I am neither half so brave nor half so  determined as the poor wretch with whom I hesitate to compare myself.    SEPTEMBER 5.    Charlotte had written a letter to her husband in the country, where he  was detained by business. It commenced, \"My dearest love, return as  soon as possible: I await you with a thousand raptures.\" A friend who  arrived, brought word, that, for certain reasons, he could not return  immediately. Charlotte's letter was not forwarded, and the same evening  it fell into my hands. I read it, and smiled. She asked the reason.  \"What a heavenly treasure is imagination:\" I exclaimed; \"I fancied for a  moment that this was written to me.\" She paused, and seemed displeased.  I was silent.    SEPTEMBER 6.    It cost me much to part with the blue coat which I wore the first time I  danced with Charlotte. But I could not possibly wear it any longer.  But I have ordered a new one, precisely similar, even to the collar and  sleeves, as well as a new waistcoat and pantaloons.    But it does not produce the same effect upon me. I know not how it is,  but I hope in time I shall like it better.    SEPTEMBER 12.    She has been absent for some days. She went to meet Albert. To-day  I visited her: she rose to receive me, and I kissed her hand most  tenderly.    A canary at the moment flew from a mirror, and settled upon her  shoulder. \"Here is a new friend,\" she observed, while she made him perch  upon her hand: \"he is a present for the children. What a dear he is!  Look at him! When I feed him, he flutters with his wings, and pecks so  nicely. He kisses me, too, only look!\"    She held the bird to her mouth; and he pressed her sweet lips with  so much fervour that he seemed to feel the excess of bliss which he  enjoyed.    \"He shall kiss you too,\" she added; and then she held the bird toward  me. His little beak moved from her mouth to mine, and the delightful  sensation seemed like the forerunner of the sweetest bliss.    \"A kiss,\" I observed, \"does not seem to satisfy him: he wishes for food,  and seems disappointed by these unsatisfactory endearments.\"    \"But he eats out of my mouth,\" she continued, and extended her lips to  him containing seed; and she smiled with all the charm of a being who  has allowed an innocent participation of her love.    I turned my face away. She should not act thus. She ought not to excite  my imagination with such displays of heavenly innocence and happiness,  nor awaken my heart from its slumbers, in which it dreams of the  worthlessness of life! And why not? Because she knows how much I love  her.    SEPTEMBER 15.    It makes me wretched, Wilhelm, to think that there should be men  incapable of appreciating the few things which possess a real value in  life. You remember the walnut trees at S--, under which I used to sit  with Charlotte, during my "]]]
