Starting with the winter view, one observes the bark,  the trend and character of the limbs, the condition of the buds. The  spring opening of growth brings rapid changes, of both interest and  beauty, to be succeeded by the maturity of summer, when, with the  ripened foliage overhead, everything is different. Again, when the fruit  is on, and the touch of Jack Frost is baring the tree for the smoother  passing of the winds of winter, there is another aspect. I have great  respect for the tree-lover who knows unerringly his favorites at any  time of the year, for have I not myself made many mistakes, especially  when no leaves are at hand as pointers? The snow leaves nothing to be  seen but the cunning framework of the tree--tell me, then, is it ash, or  elm, or beech? Which is sugar-maple, and which red, or sycamore?    One summer walk in the deep forest, my friend the doctor, who knows many  things besides the human frame, was puzzled at a sturdy tree bole, whose  leaves far overhead mingled so closely with the neighboring greenery of  beech and birch that in the dim light they gave no help. First driving  the small blade of his pocket-knife deep into the rugged bark of the  tree in question, he withdrew it, and then smelled and tasted,  exclaiming, \"Ah, I thought so; it _is_ the wild cherry!\" And, truly, the  characteristic prussic-acid odor, the bitter taste, belonging to the  peach and cherry families, were readily noted; and another Sherlock  Holmes tree fact came to me!    Of other hickories I know little, for the false shagbark, the mockernut,  the pignut, and the rest of the family have not been disclosed to me  often enough to put me at ease with them. There are to be more tree  friends, both human and arborescent, and more walks with the doctor and  the camera, I hope!    We of the cold North, as we crack the toothsome pecan, hardly realize  its kinship with the hickory. It is full brother to our shellbark,  which is, according to botany, _Hicoria ovata_, while the Southern tree  is _Hicoria pecan_. A superb tree it is, too, reaching up amid its  vigorous associates of the forests of Georgia, Alabama and Texas to a  height exceeding one hundred and fifty feet. Its upright and elegant  form, of a grace that conceals its great height, its remarkable  usefulness, and its rather rapid growth, commend it highly. The  nut-clusters are striking, having not only an interesting outline, but  much richness of color, in greens and russets.    [Illustration: The American beech in winter]    It may seem odd to include the beech under the nut-bearing trees, to  those of us who know only the nursery-grown forms of the European beech,  \"weeping\" and twisted, with leaves of copper and blood, as seen in parks  and pleasure-grounds. But the squirrels would agree; they know well the  sweet little triangular nuts that ripen early in fall.    The pure American beech, uncontaminated and untwisted with the abnormal  forms just mentioned, is a tree that keeps itself well in the eye of the  woods rambler; and that eye is always pleasured by it, also. Late in  winter, the light gray branches of a beech thicket on a dry hillside on  the edge of my home city called attention to their clean elegance amid  sordid and forbidding surroundings, and it was with anger which I dare  call righteous that I saw a hideous bill-board erected along the  hillside, to shut out the always beautiful beeches from sight as I  frequently passed on a trolley car! I have carefully avoided buying  anything of the merchants who have thus set up their announcements where  they are an insult; and it might be noted that these and other offensive  bill-boards are to others of like mind a sort of reverse  advertising--they tell us what _not_ to purchase.    [Illustration: The true nut-eater]    Years ago I chanced to be present at a birth of beech leaves, up along  Paxton Creek. It was late in the afternoon, and our reluctant feet were  turning homeward, after the camera had seen the windings of the creek  against the softening light, when the beeches over-arching the little  stream showed us this spring marvel. The little but perfectly formed  leaves had just opened, in pairs, with a wonderful covering of silvery  green, as they hung downward toward the water, yet too weak to stand out  and up to the passing breeze. The exquisite delicacy of these trembling  little leaves, the arching elegance of the branches that had just opened  them to the light, made it seem almost sacrilegious to turn the lens  upon them.    Often since have I visited the same spot, in hope to see again this  awakening, but without avail. The leaves show me their silky  completeness, rustling above the stream in softest tree talk; the  curious staminate flower-clusters hang like bunches of inverted commas;  the neat little burs, with their inoffensive prickles, mature and  discharge the angular nuts--but I am not again, I fear, to be present at  the hour of the leaf-birth of the beech's year.    The beech, by the way, is tenacious of its handsome foliage. Long after  most trees have yielded their leaves to the frost, the beech keeps its  clothing, turning from the clear yellow of fall to lightest fawn, and  hanging out in the forest a sign of whiteness that is cheering in the  winter and earliest spring. These bleached-out leaves will often remain  until fairly pushed off by the opening buds of another year.    [Illustration: The witch-hazel]    Of the hazelnut or filbert, I know nothing from the tree side, but I  cannot avoid mentioning another botanically unrelated so-called  hazel--the witch-hazel. This small tree is known to most of us only as  giving name to a certain soothing extract. It is worthy of more  attention, for its curious and delicately sweet yellow flowers,  seemingly clusters of lemon-colored threads, are the very last to bloom,  opening bravely in the very teeth of Jack Frost. They are a delight to  find, on the late fall rambles; and the next season they are followed by  the still more curious fruits, which have a habit of suddenly opening  and fairly ejaculating their seeds. A plucked branch of these fruits,  kept in a warm place a few hours, will show this--another of nature's  efficient methods for spreading seeds, in full operation--if one watches  closely enough. The flowers and the fruits are on the tree at the same  time, just as with the orange of the tropics.    Speaking of a tropical fruit, I am reminded that the greatest nut of  all, though certainly not an American native, is nevertheless now grown  on American soil. Some years ago a grove of lofty cocoanut palms in  Yucatan fascinated me, and the opportunity to drink the clear and  refreshing milk (not milky at all, and utterly different from the  familiar contents of the ripened nut of commerce) was gladly taken. Now  the bearing trees are within the bounds of the United States proper, and  the grand trees in Southern Florida give plenty of fruit. The African  citizens of that neighborhood are well aware of the refreshing character  of the \"juice\" of the green cocoanut, and a friend who sees things for  me with a camera tells with glee how a \"darky\" at Palm Beach left him in  his wheel-chair to run with simian feet up a sloping trunk, there to  pull, break open, and absorb the contents of a nut, quite as a matter of  course. I have myself seen the Africans of the Bahamas in the West  Indies climbing the glorious cocoa palms of the coral keys, throwing  down the mature nuts, and then, with strong teeth, stripping the tough  outer covering to get at the refreshing interior.    All these nut trees are only members of the great family of trees given  by God for man's good, I firmly believe; for man first comes into  Biblical view in a garden of trees, and the city and the plain are but  penances for sin!          Some Other Trees      In preceding chapters of this series I have treated of trees in a  relationship of family, or according to some noted similarity. There  are, however, some trees of my acquaintance of which the family  connections are remote or unimportant, and there are some other trees of  individual merit with the families of which I am not sufficiently well  acquainted to speak familiarly as a whole. Yet many of these trees,  looked at by themselves, are as beautiful, interesting, and altogether  worthy as any of which I have written, and they are also among the  familiar trees of America. Therefore I present a few of them apart from  the class treatment.           *       *       *       *       *    One day in very early spring--or was it very late in winter?--I walked  along the old canal road, looking for some evidence in tree growth that  spring was really at hand. Buds were swelling, and here and there a  brave robin could be heard telling about it in song to his mate (I think  that settled the season as earliest spring!); but beyond the bud  evidences the trees seemed to be silent on the subject. Various herbs  showed lusty beginnings, and the skunk-cabbage, of course, had pushed up  its tropical richness in defiance of any late frost, pointing the way to  its peculiar red-purple flowers, long since fertilized and turning  toward maturity.    The search seemed vain, until a glint of yellow just ahead, too deep to  proceed from the spice-bush I was expecting to find, drew me to the very  edge of the water, there to see hanging over and reflected in the stream  a mass of golden catkins. Looking closely, and touching the little tree,  I disengaged a cloud of pollen and a score of courageous bees, evidently  much more pleased with the sweet birch than with the near-by  skunk-cabbage flowers. Sweet birch it was; the stiff catkins, that had  all winter held themselves in readiness, had just burst into bloom with  the sun's first warmth, introducing a glint of bright color into the  landscape, and starting the active double work of the bees, in  fertilizing flowers"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2882"],[0,"The Legends of the Jews — Volume 4 (#15)"],[1,"charged the Sanhedrin to investigate  carefully the claims of the two nations. The claims of the  Philistines were shown to be utterly unfounded. In no sense were  they the descendants of those Philistines who had concluded a  treaty with Isaac; they had immigrated from Cyprus at a much later  date. The Arameans, on the other hand, had forfeited their claims  upon considerate treatment, because under the \"Aramean\" Balaam,  and later again, in the time of Othniel, under their king  Cushan-rishathaim, they had attacked and made war upon the  Israelites. (59)      AHITHOPHEL    Among David's courtiers and attendants, a prominent place is  occupied by his counsellor Ahithophel, (60) with whom the king  was connected by family ties, Bath-sheba being his granddaughter.  (61) Ahithophel's wisdom was supernatural, for his counsels  always coincided with the oracles rendered by the Urim and  Thummim, and great as was his wisdom, it was equalled by his  scholarship. Therefore David did not hesitate to submit himself to  his instruction, (62) even though Ahithophel was a very young  man, at the time of his death not more than thirty-three years old.  (63) The one thing lacking in him was sincere piety, (64) and this  it was that proved his undoing in the end, for it induced him to  take part in Absalom's rebellion against David. Thus he forfeited  even his share in the world to come. (65)    To this dire course of action he was misled by astrologic and other  signs, which he interpreted as prophecies of his own kingship,  when in reality they pointed to the royal destiny of his  granddaughter Bath-sheba. (66) Possessed by his erroneous belief,  he cunningly urged Absalom to commit an unheard-of crime. Thus  Absalom would profit nothing by his rebellion, for, though he  accomplished his father's ruin, he would yet be held to account and  condemned to death for his violation of family purity, and the way  to the throne would be clear for Ahithophel, the great sage in  Israel. (67)    The relation between David and Ahithophel had been somewhat  strained even before Absalom's rebellion. Ahithophel's feelings  had been hurt by his being passed over at the time when David,  shortly after ascending the throne, invested, on a single day, no  less than ninety thousand functionaries with positions.    On that day a remarkable incident occurred. When the Ark was to  be brought up from Geba to Jerusalem, the priests who attempted  to take hold of it were raised up in the air and thrown violently to  the ground. In his despair the king turned for advice to Ahithophel,  who retorted mockingly: \"Ask thy wise men whom thou hast but  now installed in office.\" It was only when David uttered a curse on  him who knows a remedy and withholds it from the sufferer, that  Ahithophel advised that a sacrifice should be offered at every step  taken by the priests. Although the measure proved efficacious, and  no further disaster occurred in connection with the Ark, yet  Ahithophel's words had been insincere. He knew the real reason of  the misadventure, and concealed it from the king. Instead of  following the law of having the Ark carried on the shoulders of  priests, David had had it put on a wagon, and so incurred the wrath  of God. (68)    Ahithophel's hostility toward David showed itself also on the  following occasion. When David was digging the foundations of  the Temple, a shard was found at a depth of fifteen hundred cubits.  David was about to lift it, when the shard exclaimed: \"Thou canst  not do it.\" \"Why not?\" asked David. \"Because I rest upon the  abyss.\" \"Since when?\" \"Since the hour in which the voice of God  was heard to utter the words from Sinai, 'I am the Lord thy God,'  causing the earth to quake and sink into the abyss. I lie here to  cover up the abyss.\" Nevertheless David lifted the shard, and the  waters of the abyss rose and threatened to flood the earth.  Ahithophel was standing by, and he thought to himself: \"Now  David will meet with his death, and I shall be king.\" Just then  David said: \"Whoever knows how to stem the tide of waters, and  fails to do it, will one day throttle himself.\" (69) Thereupon  Ahithophel had the Name of God inscribed upon the shard, and the  shard thrown into the abyss. The waters at once commenced to  subside, but they sank to so great a depth that David feared the  earth might lose her moisture, and he began to sing the fifteen  \"Songs of Ascents,\" to bring the waters up again. (70)    Nevertheless David's curse was realized. Ahithophel ended his  days by hanging himself. His last will contained the following  three rules of conduct: (71) 1. Refrain from doing aught against a  favorite of fortune. 2. Take heed not to rise up against the royal  house of David. 3. If the Feast of Pentecost falls on a sunny day,  then sow wheat. (72)    Posterity has been favored with the knowledge of but a small part  of Ahithophel's wisdom, and that little through two widely  different sources, through Socrates, (73) who was his disciple, and  through a fortune-book written by him. (74)      JOAB    Joab, the warrior, was a contrast to Ahithophel in every essential.  He was David's right hand. It was said, if Joab had not been there  to conduct his wars, David would not have had leisure to devote  himself to the study of the Torah. He was the model of a true  Jewish hero, distinguished at the same time for his learning, piety,  and goodness. His house stood wide open for all comers, and the  campaigns which he undertook redounded invariably to the benefit  of the people. They were indebted to him for luxuries even, (75)  and more than that, he took thought for the welfare of scholars, he  himself being the president of the Sanhedrin. (76)    It interested Joab to analyze the character of men and their  opinions. When he heard King David's words: \"Like as a father  pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him,\" he  expressed his astonishment that the comparison should be made  with the love of a father for a child, and not with the love of a  mother; mother love as a rule is considered the stronger and the  more self-sacrificing. He made up his mind to keep his eyes open,  and observe whether David's idea was borne out by facts. On one  of his journeys he happened into the house of a poor old man who  had twelve children, all of whom the father supported, however  meagrely, with the toil of his own hands. Joab proposed that he  sell him one of the twelve children; he would thus be relieved of  the care of one, and the selling-price could be applied to the better  support of the rest. The good father rejected the proposition  brusquely. Then Joab approached the mother, offering her a  hundred gold denarii for one of the children. At first she resisted  the temptation, but finally she yielded. When the father returned in  the evening, he cut the bread, as was his wont, into fourteen  pieces, for himself, his wife, and his twelve children. In allotting  the portions he missed a child, and insisted upon being told its  fate. The mother confessed what had happened during his absence.  He neither ate nor drank, and next morning he set out, firmly  resolved to return the money to Joab and to slay him if he should  refuse to surrender the child. After much parleying, and after the  father had threatened him with death, Joab yielded the child to the  old man, with the exclamation: \"Yes, David was right when he  compared God's love for men to a father's love for his child. This  poor fellow who has twelve children to support was prepared to  fight me to the death for one of them, which the mother, who  calmly stayed at home, had sold to me for a price.\"    Among all the heroic achievements of Joab, the most remarkable  is the taking of the Amalekite capital. For six months the flower of  the Israelitish army, twelve thousand in number, under the  leadership of Joab, had been besieging the capital city of the  Amalekites without result. The soldiers made representations to  their general, that it would be well for them to return home to their  wives and children. Joab urged that this not only would earn for  them contempt and derision, but also would invite new danger.  The heathen would be encouraged to unite against the Israelites.  He proposed that they hurl him into the city by means of a sling,  and then wait forty days. If at the end of this period they saw blood  flow from the gates of the fortress, it should be a sign to them that  he was still alive.    His plan was executed. Joab took with him one thousand pieces of  money and his sword. When he was cast from the sling, he fell into  the courtyard of a widow, whose daughter caught him up. In a little  while he regained consciousness. He pretended to be an Amalekite  taken prisoner by the Israelites, and thrown into the city by his  captors, who thus wished to inflict death. As he was provided with  money, which he dispensed lavishly among his entertainers, he  was received kindly, and was given the Amalekite garb. So  apparelled, he ventured, after ten days, on a tour of inspection  through the city, which he found to be of enormous size.    His first errand was to an armorer, to have him mend his sword,  which had been broken by his fall. When the artisan scanned  Joab's weapon, he started back--he had never seen a sword like it.  He forged a new one, which snapped in two almost at once when  Joab grasped it firmly. So it happened with a second sword, and  with a third. Finally he succeeded in fashioning one that was  acceptable. Joab asked the smith whom he would like him to slay  with the sword, and the reply was, \"Joab, the general of the  Israelitish king.\" \"I am he,\" said Joab, and when the smith in  astonishment turned to look at him, Joab ran him through so  skillfully that the victim had no realization of what was happening.  Thereupon he hewed down five hundred Amalekite warriors whom  he met on his way, and not one escaped to"]]]
