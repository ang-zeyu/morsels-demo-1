This here's what we call on-dress.\" \"I'm sorry, sir,\" says  the lady, \"I didn't ax you to sit down.\" \"No offence at all, marm,\" I  says, but I took a couple o' glasses of brandy as was brought in. I saw  'twas no use goin' against the young chap; so, when he asked what he'd  have to do aboard, I told him nothing to speak of, except count the  sails now and then, look over the bows to see how the ship went, and go  aloft with a spy-glass. \"Oh,\" says his mother, at this, \"I hope Captain  Steel won't never allow Edward to go up those dangerous ladders! It is  my partic'lar request he should be punished if he does.\" \"Sartainly,  marm, I'll mention it to the captain,\" I says, \"an' no doubt he'll give  them orders as you speak on.\" \"The captain desired me to say the young  gentleman could come aboard as soon as he likes,\" says I, before goin'  out of the door. \"Very well, sir,\" says the lady, \"I shall see the  tailor this same afternoon, and get his clothes, if so be it must.\" The  last word I said was, putting my head half in again to tell 'em, \"There  was no use gettin' any huniforms at present, seein' the ship's  sail-maker could do all as was wanted afterwards, when we got to sea.\"    Well, two or three days after, the captain sent word to say the ship  would drop down with the morning tide, and Master Collins had better be  aboard by six o'clock. I went ashore with the boat, but the young  gemman's clothes warn't ready yet; so it was made up he was to come  aboard from Gravesend the day after. But his mother and an old lady, a  friend of theirs, would have it they'd go and see his bed-room, and take  a look at the ship. There was a bit of breeze with the tide, and the old  Indiaman bobbed up and down on it in the cold morning; you could hear  the wash of water poppling on to her rudder, with her running gear blown  out in a bend; and Missus Collins thought they'd never get up the dirty  black sides of the vessel, as she called 'em. The other said her husband  had been a captain, an' she laid claim to a snatch of knowledge.  \"Sailor,\" says she to me, as we got under the quarter, \"that there tall  mast is the main-bowsprit, ain't it? and that other is the gallant  bowling you call it, don't you?\" says she. \"No doubt, marm,\" says I,  winking to the boys not to laugh. \"It's all right,\" I says. Howsoever,  as to the bed-room, the captain showed 'em over the cabin, and put 'em  off by saying the ship was so out of order he couldn't say which rooms  was to be which yet, though they needn't fear Master Ned would get all  comfortable; so ashore the poor woman went, pretty well pleased,  considerin' her heart was against the whole consarn.    Well, the next afternoon, lying off Gravesend, out comes a wherry with  young master. One of the men said there was a midshipman in it.  \"Midshipman be blowed!\" says I; \"did ye ever see a reefer in a wherry,  or sitting out 'o the starn-sheets? It's neither more nor less nor the  greenhorn we've got.\" \"Why don't the bo'sun pipe to man sideropes for  him!\" says th' other; \"but, my eye, Bob,\" says he to me; \"what a sight  of traps the chap's got in the boat! 'twill be enough to heel the  Chester Castle to the side he berths upon, on an even keel. Do he mean  to have the captain's cabin, I wonder!\" Up the side he scrambles, with  the help of a side-ladder, all togged out to the nines in a span-new  blue jacket and anchor buttons, a cap with a gould band, and white ducks  made to fit--as jemmy-jessamy a looking fellow as you'd see of a cruise  along London parks, with the waterman singing out alongside to send down  a tackle for the dunnage, which it took a pair of purchase-blocks to  hoist them out on board. \"What's all this?\" says the mate, coming  for'ard from the quarter-deck. \"'Tis the young gemman's traps, sir,\" I  says. \"What the devil!\" says the mate, \"d'ye think we've room to stow  all this lumber? Strike it down into the forehold, Jacobs--but get out a  blue shirt or two, and a Scotch cap for the young whelp first, if he  wants to save that smooth toggery of his for his mammy. You're as green  as cabbage, I'm feared, my lad!\" says he. By this time the boy was  struck all of a heap, an' didn't know what to say when he saw the boat  pulling for shore, except he wanted to have a sight of his bed-room.  \"Jacobs,\" says the mate, laughing like an old bear, \"take him below, and  show him his bed-room, as he calls it!\" So down we went to the  half-deck, where the carpenter, bo'sun, and three or four of the  'prentices, had their hammocks slung. There I left him to overhaul his  big donkey of a chest, which his mother had stowed it with clothes  enough for a lord ambassador, but not a blessed thing fit to use--I  wouldn't 'a given my bit of a black box for the whole on it, ten times  over. There was another chockful of gingerbread, pots o' presarves,  pickles, and bottles; and, thinks I, \"The old lady didn't know what  _shares_ is at sea, I reckon. 'Twill all be gone for footing, my boy,  before you've seen blue water, or I'm a Dutchman.\"    In a short time we was up anchor, going down with a fast breeze for the  Nore; and we stood out to sea that night, havin' to join a convoy off  Spithead. My gentleman was turned in all standing, on top o' some sails  below; and next day he was as sick as a greenhorn could be, cleaning out  his land-ballast where he lay, nor I didn't see him till he'd got  better. 'Twas blowing a strong breeze, with light canvas all in aloft,  and a single reef in the tops'ls; but fine enough for the Channel,  except the rain--when what does I see but the \"Green Hand\" on the  weather quarter-deck, holding on by the belaying-pins, with a yumbrella  over his head. The men for'ard was all in a roar, but none of the  officers was on deck save the third mate, The mate goes up to him, and  looks in his face. \"Why,\" says he, \"you confounded long-shore picked-up  son of a green-grocer, what _are_ you after?\" an' he takes the article a  slap with his larboard-flipper, as sent it flying to leeward like a puff  of smoke. \"Keep off the quarter-deck, you lubber,\" says he, giving him a  wheel down into the lee-scuppers--\"it's well the captain didn't catch  ye!\" \"Come aft here, some of ye,\" sings out the third mate again, \"to  brace up the main yard; and you, ye lazy beggar, clap on this moment and  pull!\" At this the greenhorn takes out a pair o' gloves, shoves his  fingers into 'em, and tails on to the rope behind. \"Well, dammit!\" says  the mate, \"if I ever see the likes o' that! Jacobs, get a tarbucket and  dip his fists in it; larn him what his hands was made for! I never could  bear to see a fellow ashore with his flippers shoed like his feet; but  at sea, confound me, it would make a man green-sick over again!\" If  you'd only seen how Master Collins looked when shoved his missy fingers  into the tar, and chucked the gloves o' board! The next moment he ups  fists and made slap at me, when in goes the brush in his mouth; the mate  gives him a kick astarn; the young chap went sprawling down into the  half-deck ladder, where the carpenter had his shavin'-glass rigged to  crop his chin--and there he gets another clip across the jaws from  Chips. \"Now,\" says the mate, \"the chap'll be liker a sailor to-morrow.  He's got some spunk in him, though, by the way he let drive at you, my  lad,\" says he: \"that fellow 'll either catch the cat or spoil the  monkey. Look after him, Jacobs, my lad,\" says the third mate; \"he's in  my watch, and the captain wants him to rough it out; so show him the  ropes, and let him taste an end now an' then. Ha! ha! ha!\" says he  again, laughing, \"'tis the first time I ever see a embreller loosed out  at sea, and but the second I've seen brought aboard even! He's the  greenest hand, sure enough, it's been my luck to come across! But green  they say's nigh to blue, so look out if I don't try to make a sailor of  the young spark!\"    Well, for the next three or four days the poor fellow was knocked about  on all hands; he'd got to go aloft to the 'gallant cross-trees, and out  on the yard foot-ropes the next morning, before breakfast; and, coming  down, the men made him fast till he sent down the key of his  bottle-chest to pay his footing. If he closed his eyes a moment in the  watch, slash comes a bucket full o' Channel water over him; the third  mate would keep him two hours on end, larnin' to rig out a sternsail  boom, or grease a royal mast. He led a dog's life of it too, in the  half-deck: last come, in course, has al'ays to go and fill the bread  barge, scrub the planks, an' do all the dirty jobs. Them _owners'  'prentices_, sich as he had for messmates, is always worse to their own  kind by far nor the \"_common sailors_,\" as the long-shore folks calls a  foremast-man. I couldn't help takin' pity on the poor lad, being the  only one as had seen the way of his up-bringing, and I felt a sort of a  charge of him like; so one night I had a quiet spell with him in the  watch, an' as soon as I fell to speak kind-ways, there I seed the water  stand i' the boy's eyes. \"It's a good thing,\" says he, tryin' to gulp it  down--\"it's a good thing mother don't see all this!\" \"Ho, ho,\" says I,  \"my lad, 'tis all but another way of bein' sea-sick! You doesn't get the  land cleared out, and snuff the sea blue breeze nat'ral like, all at  once! Hows'ever, my lad,\" says I, \"take my advice--bring your hammock  an' chest into the fok'sle; swap half your fine clothes for blue shirts  and canvas trowsers; turn-to ready and willing, an' do all that's asked  you--you'll soon find the differ 'twi"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21530"],[0,"The Angel of Terror (#15)"],[1,"e, so if you care to come as my guest, I shall be most happy  to chaperon you. They are bringing my yacht down to Monaco, so we ought  to have a really good time.\"    Lydia accepted the yacht and the house as she had accepted the  invitation--without question. That the yacht had been chartered that  morning and the house hired by telegram on the previous day, she could  not be expected to guess. For all she knew, Mrs. Cole-Mortimer might be  a very wealthy woman, and in her wildest dreams she did not imagine that  Jean Briggerland had provided the money for both.    It had not been a delicate negotiation, because Mrs. Cole-Mortimer had  the skin of a pachyderm.    Years later Lydia discovered that the woman lived on borrowed money,  money which never could and never would be repaid, and which the  borrower had no intention of refunding.    A hint dropped by Jean that there was somebody on the Riviera whom she  desired to meet, without her father's knowledge, accompanied by the  plain statement that she would pay all expenses, was quite sufficient  for Mrs. Cole-Mortimer, and she had fallen in with her patron's views as  readily as she had agreed to pose as a friend of Meredith's. To do her  justice, she had the faculty of believing in her own invention, and she  was quite satisfied that James Meredith had been a great personal friend  of hers, just as she would believe that the house on the Riviera and the  little steam-yacht had been procured out of her own purse.    It was harder for her, however, to explain the great system which she  was going to work in Monte Carlo and which was to make everybody's  fortune.    Lydia, who was no gambler and only mildly interested in games of chance,  displayed so little evidence of interest in the scheme that Mrs.  Cole-Mortimer groaned her despair, not knowing that she was expected to  do no more than stir the soil for the crop which Jean Briggerland would  plant and reap.    They went on to supper at one of the clubs, and Lydia thought with  amusement of poor old Jaggs, who apparently took his job very seriously  indeed.    Again her angle of vision had shifted, and her respect for the old man  had overcome any annoyance his uncouth presence brought to her.    As she alighted at the door of the club she looked round, half expecting  to see him. The club entrance was up a side street off Leicester Square,  an ill-lit thoroughfare which favoured Mr. Jaggs's retiring methods, but  there was no sign of him, and she did not wait in the drizzling night to  make any closer inspection.    Mrs. Cole-Mortimer had not disguised the possibility of Jean Briggerland  being at the club, and they found her with a gay party of young people,  sitting in one of the recesses. Jean made a place for the girl by her  side and introduced her to half a dozen people whose names Lydia did not  catch, and never afterwards remembered.    Mr. Marcus Stepney, however, that sleek, dark man, who bowed over her  hand and seemed as though he were going to kiss it, she had met before,  and her second impression of him was even less favourable than the  first.    \"Do you dance?\" asked Jean.    A jazz band was playing an infectious two-step. At the girl's nod Jean  beckoned one of her party, a tall, handsome boy who throughout the  subsequent dance babbled into Lydia's ear an incessant paean in praise of  Jean Briggerland.    Lydia was amused.    \"Of course she is very beautiful,\" she said in answer to the  interminable repetition of his question. \"I think she's lovely.\"    \"That's what I say,\" said the young man, whom she discovered was Lord  Stoker. \"The most amazingly beautiful creature on the earth, I think.\"    \"Of course you're awfully good-looking, too,\" he blundered, and Lydia  laughed aloud.    \"But she's got enemies,\" said the young man viciously, \"and if ever I  meet that infernal cad, Glover, he'll be sorry.\"    The smile left Lydia's face.    \"Mr. Glover is a friend of mine,\" she said a little quickly.    \"Sorry,\" he mumbled, \"but----\"    \"Does Miss Briggerland say he is so very bad?\"    \"Of course not. She never says a word against him really.\" His lordship  hastened to exonerate his idol. \"She just says she doesn't know how long  she's going to stand his persecutions. It breaks one's heart to see how  sad this--your friend makes her.\"    Lydia was a very thoughtful girl for the rest of the evening; she was  beginning in a hazy way to see things which she had not seen before. Of  course Jean never said anything against Jack Glover. And yet she had  succeeded in arousing this youth to fury against the lawyer, and Lydia  realised, with a sense of amazement, that Jean had also made her feel  bad about Jack. And yet she had said nothing but sweet things.    When she got back to the flat that night she found that Mr. Jaggs had  not been there all the evening. He came in a few minutes after her,  wrapped up in an old army coat, and from his appearance she gathered  that he had been standing out in the rain and sleet the whole of the  evening.    \"Why, Jaggs,\" she said impulsively, \"wherever have you been?\"    \"Just dodging round, miss,\" he grunted. \"Having a look at the little  ducks in the pond.\"    \"You've been outside the theatre, and you've been waiting outside Niro's  Club,\" she said accusingly.    \"Don't know it, miss,\" he said. \"One theayter is as much like another  one to me.\"    \"You must take your things off and let Mrs. Morgan dry your clothes,\"  she insisted, but he would not hear of this, compromising only with  stripping his sodden great coat.    He disappeared into his dark room, there to ruminate upon such matters  as appeared of interest to him. A bed had been placed for him, but only  once had he slept on it.    After the flat grew still and the last click of the switch told that the  last light had been extinguished, he opened the door softly, and,  carrying a chair in his hand, he placed this gently with its back to the  front door, and there he sat and dozed throughout the night. When Lydia  woke the next morning he was gone as usual.          Chapter XVII      Lydia had plenty to occupy her days. The house in Curzon Street had been  bought and she had been a round of furnishers, paper-hangers and fitters  of all variety.    The trip to the Riviera came at the right moment. She could leave Mrs.  Morgan in charge and come back to her new home, which was to be ready in  two months.    Amongst other things, the problem of the watchful Mr. Jaggs would be  settled automatically.    She spoke to him that night when he came.    \"By the way, Mr. Jaggs, I am going to the South of France next week.\"    \"A pretty place by all accounts,\" volunteered Mr. Jaggs.    \"A lovely place--by all accounts,\" repeated Lydia with a smile. \"And  you're going to have a holiday, Mr. Jaggs. By the way, what am I to pay  you?\"    \"The gentleman pays me, miss,\" said Mr. Jaggs with a sniff. \"The lawyer  gentleman.\"    \"Well, he must continue paying you whilst I am away,\" said the girl. \"I  am very grateful to you and I want to give you a little present before  I go. Is there anything you would like, Mr. Jaggs?\"    Mr. Jaggs rubbed his beard, scratched his head and thought he would like  a pipe.    \"Though bless you, miss, I don't want any present.\"    \"You shall have the best pipe I can buy,\" said the girl. \"It seems very  inadequate.\"    \"I'd rather have a briar, miss,\" said old Jaggs mistakenly.    He was on duty until the morning she left, and although she rose early  he had gone. She was disappointed, for she had not given him the  handsome case of pipes she had bought, and she wanted to thank him. She  felt she had acted rather meanly towards him. She owed her life to him  twice.    \"Didn't you see him go?\" she asked Mrs. Morgan.    \"No, miss,\" the stout housekeeper shook her head. \"I was up at six and  he'd gone then, but he'd left his chair in the passage--I've got an idea  that's where he slept, miss, if he slept at all.\"    \"Poor old man,\" said the girl gently. \"I haven't been very kind to him,  have I? And I do owe him such a lot.\"    \"Maybe he'll turn up again,\" said Mrs. Morgan hopefully. She had the  mother feeling for the old, which is one of the beauties of her class,  and she regretted Lydia's absence probably as much because it would  entail the disappearance of old Jaggs as for the loss of her mistress.  But old Jaggs did not turn up. Lydia hoped to see him at the station,  hovering on the outskirts of the crowd in his furtive way, but she was  disappointed.    She left by the eleven o'clock train, joining Mrs. Cole-Mortimer on the  station. That lady had arranged to spend a day in Paris, and the girl  was not sorry, after a somewhat bad crossing of the English Channel,  that she had not to continue her journey through the night.    The South of France was to be a revelation to her. She had no conception  of the extraordinary change of climate and vegetation that could be  experienced in one country.    She passed from a drizzly, bedraggled Paris into a land of sunshine and  gentle breezes; from the bare sullen lands of the Champagne, into a  country where flowers grew by the side of the railway, and that in  February; to a semi-tropic land, fragrant with flowers, to white beaches  by a blue, lazy sea and a sky over all unflecked by clouds.    It took her breath away, the beauty of it; and the sense and genial  warmth of it. The trees laden with lemons, the wisteria on the walls,  the white dust on the road, and the glory of the golden mimosa that  scented the air with its rare and lovely perfume.    They left the train at Nice and drove along the Grande Corniche. Mrs.  Cole-Mortimer had a call to make in Monte Carlo and the girl sat back in  the car and drank in the beauty of this delicious spot, whilst her  hostess interviewed the house agent.    Surely the place must be kept under glass. It looked so fresh and clean  and free from stain.    The Casino disappointed her--it was a place of"]]]
