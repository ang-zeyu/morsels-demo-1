(#15)"],[1,"DOVETAILS.--After marking out the pins on the drawer sides, we  proceed with the next operation, that is, sawing the dovetails ready for  chopping out the waste material. The drawer side is taken and firmly  secured in the bench screw and sawn as at Fig. 281; it is most important  that the saw kerf is kept _inside_ the line which has been scratched by  the marking awl. See Fig. 280, where the dotted line represents the gauge  line and the outside lines indicate the scores of the marking awl.  Failure to observe this condition will result in faulty dovetailing, and  it will also prove the necessity for using a finely-toothed and  thin-bladed dovetail saw.    To cut out the waste wood (or core), the usual procedure is to saw away  the half-dovetails as at Fig. 275. With care, this can be accomplished  with the dovetail saw, thus avoiding unnecessary labour and the use of  the paring chisel.    After sawing, the drawer side is placed flat upon the bench, one end in  contact with the bench to prevent the drawer side from slipping away; a  chisel (preferably bevelled edged) of suitable width is now taken and a  small channel is cut as at A, Fig. 282. The method of cutting this  channel is shown in the same illustration. The chisel-cut is started  about 1/8 in. from the gauge line; the cut is made right up to the gauge  line, which (when gauging) was made 1/32 in. deep so as to cut the cross  fibres of the timber. A small piece of waste wood will therefore come  away as at A.    The object of cutting this small channel is so that, when the chisel is  held vertically on the gauge line and struck with the mallet, the chisel  will have no tendency to force its way backward and overshoot the gauge  line. The waste or core is now removed by holding the chisel  approximately vertical and applying sufficient power to drive it half-way  through the timber. The drawer side is now turned over, the operation  repeated, and the core pushed out. Care must be exercised whilst cutting  away the core to ensure the chisel being held nearly perpendicular; if  too much lead (or bevel) be given, a faulty and undercut dovetail will be  the result. Undercut dovetails prevent a proper grip of the glue; they  give a weak joint, and often cause the face of the drawer side to be  splintered whilst driving up the joint. If it be necessary to ease one or  two shavings from off the drawer side whilst fitting the completed drawer  in the carcase, the joint will show a greater gap as each succeeding  shaving is removed.    In common work, especially in soft timbers, many workers allow the pins  of a drawer back to run through the sides about 1/16 in. and hammer down  the pins of the dovetail. This is called \"bishoping the dovetails,\" and  is unnecessary if the work be properly made and fitted.    An alternative method of dovetailing is that of cutting the dovetails  first, as shown at Fig. 283. Four or six drawer sides are placed in the  vice and the dovetails are sawn at one operation. A little lead (or  bevel) from front to back is given whilst sawing, and if this method be  used care must be taken to see that the parts of the drawer sides which  will be on the inside of the completed drawer are towards the worker, or  the lead will be given to the dovetails in the wrong direction.    [Illustration: Fig. 283.--Cutting several Dovetails at once.]    After sawing the dovetails in this manner the sides are placed in their  respective positions on the drawer fronts or backs, and marked with a  pounce-bag or by using the saw-blade method. The pins are then cut in the  usual way, care being taken that the saw kerf be on the outside of the  marks, otherwise the pins will finish too slack to engage with the tails.    FRAME DOVETAILS.--Fig. 284 is a sketch of a constructional frame such as  is used for building up a cornice or plinth. At the joint marked A an  edge barefaced dovetail is shown. From the separated sketches of the  joint (B) it will be seen that the dovetail can be put together either  from the top or the bottom of the framing as all its edges are parallel;  glue is relied upon to hold it in position. The centre stretcher rail at  Fig. 284 is similar, except that in this case it is a complete dovetail  in place of a barefaced one.    [Illustration: Fig. 284.--Constructional Frame (as for Plinth or Cornice)  showing application of the Dovetail Joint.]    Some workers, when making either of the above joints, prefer to give a  slight bevel to the dovetail, so that it drives tightly into the housing  when put together.    A variation of this type of dovetail is frequently used to joint internal  uprights to the horizontal shelves of writing desks, cabinets, and  bookcases, etc. The dovetailed portion is parallel for about  three-fourths of its width; the remaining part is tapered towards the  front edge and notched away at the face so as to conceal the method of  construction. An illustration of the top portion of a division 14 ins.  wide is shown at Fig. 284, C. The other portion is of course dovetailed  to fit it.    BLIND LAP-DOVETAILING.--At Fig. 285 is shown a type of blind  lap-dovetailing. This makes a good, sound joint, but it has the  disadvantage of showing a small portion of the timber of the front rail  end-way of the grain. Joints of this kind are used for cornices, boxes,  etc., and also for painted furniture.    [Illustration: Fig. 285.--Blind Lap-Dovetailing.]    [Illustration: Fig. 286.--Housed and Mitred Dovetail.]    HOUSED AND MITRED DOVETAIL.--Fig. 286 is another form of  dovetail--commonly called a housed and mitred or rebated and mitred  dovetail. In this instance we see that a small portion is mitred at top  and bottom edges, and when used in plinth or cornice work, or for making  tea-caddies, etc., the edges are (when completing the work) covered  either with the moulding, which is planted on the cornice or plinth, or  with the top and bottom of the box or tea-caddy.    The method of making a housed and mitred dovetail joint is seen in Fig.  286. The ends to be joined are planed up true and square and then  rebated as shown. The dotted lines indicate the portion which has been  worked away. The dovetails are now sawn and pared out in the usual way  and the part denoted by the arrow is afterwards cut away with a chisel  and finally finished to a smooth surface with a rebate plane; the method  of working is shown at Fig. 287, where the dovetail pins are seen with  the waste portions cut away.    [Illustration: Fig. 287.--Working a Housed and Mitred Dovetail Joint.]    Fig. 287 also shows the method of cutting away the mitred part. A  temporary piece of wood is planed to a true mitre and placed underneath  the dovetailed piece to form a template. Both pieces of the timber are  now secured to the bench with a handscrew or cramp; the template A will  form a guide for the chisel and rebate plane and allow a sharp edge or  arris to be worked on the mitre.    A SECRET MITRED DOVETAIL joint is illustrated at Fig. 288; it is used in  all the better class of cabinet and box work. Fig. 288 shows the pieces  separated; note the mitre at the top and bottom edge.    [Illustration: Fig. 288.--Secret Mitre Dovetailing.]    [Illustration: Fig. 289.--Dovetailed Keys for Wide Surfaces.]    DOVETAIL KEYING.--Fig. 289 is a method used to prevent wide boards such  as signboards, wide and shaped pediments, etc., from casting or warping.  It is called dovetail keying. Beyond calling attention to the fact that  the angles at the edges of the keys, where they are bevelled, should be  at or about 75 degrees, nothing further need be said, as the drawing is  self-explanatory. Angle dovetail keying is shown at Figs. 290 and 291.    [Illustration: Fig. 290.--Dovetail Key.]    [Illustration: Fig. 291.--Dovetail Keying on the Angle.]    [Illustration: Fig. 292.--Bow-fronted Door Dovetailed Edgeways.]    OTHER VARIETIES.--At Fig. 292 we have an everyday method of jointing  circular-fronted cabinet door frames. Great care must be taken in setting  out and making, or a twisted frame will result.    Then at Fig. 293 are shown two familiar examples of dovetailing the  bearer to the carcase end of a dressing table or washstand.    Fig. 294.--Lap-dovetailing the top of a wardrobe to the carcase end.  Other examples, such as the top of a bookcase to the sides, will suggest  themselves.    Fig. 295.--Side view of a jewel drawer with a moulded drawer front as  used on dressing tables, etc. This shows the necessity of bevelled  dovetailing in order that the drawer front may be kept as thin and light  as possible.    [Illustration: Fig. 293.--Carcase Work, showing Bearer Rails Dovetailed.]    Fig. 296.--Bevelled dovetailing when pins are at right angles to the end  cut.    Fig. 297.--Bevelled dovetailing when the centre line of the pins is  parallel to the edges of the work, used for making \"hoppers,\" food  troughs, knife boxes, etc. One corner of the box shows the joint  separated.

Fig. 299.--Method of dovetailing small boxes. The box is dovetailed in  one width and the top and bottom glued on; the sides and ends are then  cut along the dotted line, thus forming the lid. It will be noticed that  a specially wide dovetail pin must be left so as to form part of the lid  and part of the lower portion.    [Illustration: Fig. 298.--Oblique Dovetailing.]    [Illustration: Fig. 299.--Dovetailing for Small Box.]    SETTING OUT THE JOINT.--For constructing a dovetail joint at the corner  of a frame, as Fig. 300, it is necessary at the outset to trim up the  ends of the timber square and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21534"],[0,"Textiles and Clothing (#15)"],[1,"the buttonhole and not cross it.    [Sidenote: Hooks and Eyes]    The position for hooks and eyes should be marked before sewing on. The  simplest, though least desirable, method of sewing-on these fastenings  is to place the eye at the edge of the seam or facing and the hook  sufficiently far back from the opposite side to give a lap. A much  preferable method is to baste a bias strip of crinoline along the  positions to be occupied by the hooks and eyes; this gives strength to  the finish. Sufficient material should be allowed for folding over the  shanks after the hooks and eyes have been sewed on, or they may be  covered with silk ribbon, slipping the edge under the beak of each hook  and then catstitched in position.    The hooks and eyes are sewed securely through the crinoline and one  thickness, but the stitches should not show on the outside. Over and  over stitches are taken through the small rings in the line of the full  and again on each bar of the eye and on the shank of the hook so that  they may be held in position securely. In many cases, it is advisable to  have an underlap of the material. This should be slip-stitched in  position on the garment after the eyes have been sewed in place.      [Illustration: HOOKS AND EYES    Sewed on tape, Shanks covered with taffeta tape and with fold of the  goods.]      [Sidenote: Eyelets]    Eyelet holes are made with a stiletto which forces the threads aside,  but does not cut them. The edge is finished with over and over stitches  placed closely together, or with a buttonhole stitch making the purl on  the outer edge of the stitches. Loops are made by buttonholing very  closely over several foundation threads, making the purl on the outside  edge. The needle may be run under the loop eye first if preferred.      PATCHING    [Sidenote: Underset Patch]    With the underset patch have the part to be patched pressed smooth,  baste the patch on the wrong side of the garment before cutting out the  worn place. (If the garment or article to be mended is worn or faded and  shrunken by laundering, boil the piece in soap, soda and water to fade  the patch, if of cotton or linen.) After basting, cut away all the worn  cloth, making a square or oblong hole. Cut to a thread. Cut each corner,  diagonally, one-eighth or one-quarter of an inch, turn all four edges of  the garment towards the wrong side. Begin at the center of one side and  hem all around the square, taking slanting even stitches, not too close  together. Remove the basting, trim the edges of the patch, press the  patch on the wrong side and catch stitch to the garment. This shows less  on the right side and does not make a hard line as if the patch were  turned back on the edge. If the cloth has a pattern or stripe, match it  perfectly, having the warp threads of both running the same way. Cut  both hole and patch square. An oval or round patch is unworkmanlike  and does not wear well. Keep the corners square and hem down well. The  object of pressing is to keep both garment and patch flat and even.  Flannel patches should be cat-stitched on the right side. No flannel  edges should ever be inturned.      [Illustration: UNDERSET PATCH, RIGHT SIDE, EDGE TURNED AND HEMMED TO  PATCH]    [Illustration: WRONG SIDE OF PATCH, CAT STITCHED]    [Illustration: WRONG SIDE OF PATCH IN TABLE CLOTH--RAW EDGE OVERCAST]      [Sidenote: Onset Patch]    The onset patch is used on lined garments and linings. The patch should  be rectangular and larger than the worn place. Fold the four edges on  the wrong side of the patch, place the patch with its wrong side on the  right side of the garment directly over the center of the hole. This  will bring the folded edges of the patch between the two pieces of cloth  and both right sides towards the worker. Do not baste, but pin  carefully. After the garment has been folded back until there are two  folded edges side by side, overhand the seam with even slanting  stitches. See that the corners are well sewed, that warp and woof  threads run in the same direction, that pattern and stripes match.      [Illustration: LINEN PATCH; CROSS STITCH INITIAL]      [Illustration: RIGHT SIDE OF FLANNEL PATCH    Edge cat stitched but not turned, back cat stitched in the same way.]      The worn part of the garment under the patch is cut away, leaving  one-fourth of an inch on the three sides. Cut the corners diagonally and  turn back the edge quarter of an inch, overcast and press. If this patch  is sewed on a lining, the worn part is not cut away. If this patch is  used to repair skirts near the band, only three sides are oversewed, the  upper edge should be gathered into the band. A large patch is less  conspicuous than a small one.    [Sidenote: Patch for Trowsers]    An onset patch may be used for the seats of trousers by shaping the  patch like the pieces on the seats of bicycle trousers and stitching on  the machine. Heavy cloth will need no inturned edges. The same  precautions are necessary regarding warp and woof, pattern, etc.      DARNING    [Sidenote: Thread for Darning]    Darning is usually done with a running stitch, with or without a piece  of net or cloth underset. Thread for darning should be as near as  possible the size of the threads in the garment. Whenever it can be  done, a warp thread of the garment should be used. No sewing silk is  fine enough to use without separating the thread and using one of the  strands. Never use the thread as it is, as it is too hard twisted.  Cotton and linen thread of the finest quality, untwisted, should be used  for darning stockings and underwear. Linen may be darned with linen or  mercerized cotton. Cotton is preferable.    A long slender needle with a large eye should be used. Darning should  never be commenced with a knot, nor finished with a back stitch.    [Sidenote: Bias Darn]    A bias or diagonal cut and a three-cornered tear are the most difficult  to repair. If the place is badly pulled and frayed, a piece of the same  material should be basted on the wrong side of the material and darned  in even stitches. Always darning _parallel_ with the warp threads and  the woof threads. In the diagonal tear, as the threads are cut  diagonally, to prevent drawing apart, the darning threads must cross  each other.    The stitches around any darn should not end in a stiff even line; this  makes a hard edge which does not wear and is unsightly, and  uncomfortable if on underwear.    [Sidenote: Darning a Three Cornered Tear]    The three-cornered tear may be darned in two ways. Begin by darning  diagonally through the center, darning back and forth towards the end of  the tear until one-half has been finished; then begin at the center and  work in the opposite direction. At the corner, the stitches should form  the shape of a fan. The other method, which is the stronger, is done by  darning a square in the angle, first with the warp threads, then with  the woof threads and finishing each end across the tear.    Stocking darning may be done on the right side. Begin by picking up the  stitches and drawing the edges together. This should always be done in  any kind of stocking darning, but not so close as to make a wrinkle.      [Illustration: STOCKINET DARNING OVER NET    Interlaced Stitches and Chain Stitches.]      In knees and heels of stockings, or knitted underwear, a piece of net  large enough to extend beyond the thin part should be basted carefully;  then darn down the outer edges of the net and finally the hole or thin  place. This makes a strong, neat piece of mending. If the hole is large,  the net may be covered with the chain stitch, thus imitating the  knitting stitch. This should be done on the right side of the garment.    If the hole is to be filled in with the interlaced stitches, draw the  edges together, darn beyond the thin places lengthwise of the knitted  garment, making each line of stitches longer until the center of the  hole is reached, then decrease in the same manner, making a diamond in  shape. Darn across the hole in the same way, taking up every alternate  stitch as in weaving. Leave a tiny loop at the end of each row of  darning, so that the threads will not draw.    [Sidenote: Machine Darning]    Darning, satisfactory for some purposes, may be done quickly on a double  thread sewing machine. It is best done in an embroidery ring, first  drawing the edges together. Loosen the tension on the presser foot, use  fine thread with light tension. Sew back and forth, first along the warp  threads and then at right angles along the woof threads. The machine  will be sewing backwards part of the time, but if the pressure is light,  there will be no difficulty. For large holes, paper may be placed  underneath.      MITERING EMBROIDERY OR LACE    The mitering of lace or embroidery is often necessary in making collars  and in finishing corners. Before applying, plan carefully and select a  scallop or portion of the embroidery which will produce the best effects  when finished. This can be accomplished by folding the embroidery over  at various portions of the pattern until a suitable point is found.  Fold over at right angles and mark along the line to be mitered. The  triangle may now be cut, but an extra width must always be allowed for  the seam, as there is frequently a slight unevenness and one side may  have to be held a little full or stretched to make a perfect match. The  mitered seam is over-sewed.      [Illustration: MITERING AND JOINING EMBROIDERY    _A_--Finished with a stitched seam; _B_--Edge hemmed down and cloth cut  away underneath; _C_--Joined with lapped seam.]      After the corner is properly made, cut away the cloth of the embroidery,  allowing only enough for an inturned seam on the edge. This seam may be  stitched on the machine on both edges, or oversewed to the goods, or the  embroidery may be securely sewed on the plain part, after which the  underlying cloth may be cut away. This will make"]]]
