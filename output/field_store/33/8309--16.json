Louder tone is often  indicated by the clenched fist, the _fortissimo_ effect at the  climacteric point often involving a strong muscular contraction in the  entire body; while softer tone is frequently called for by holding the  left hand out with palm down, by loosening the grip upon the baton,  and by a generally relaxed condition of the entire body. Dynamic  changes are also indicated to a certain extent by the amplitude of the  beat and by the position of the hands. In calling for a _pianissimo_  effect, the conductor usually gives short beats with the hands close  together (if the left hand is also used), but in demanding  _fortissimo_ the beat is usually of much greater amplitude, and the  hands, therefore, widely separated. For the swell ([crescendo-decrescendo  symbol]) the hands are usually close together at the beginning, are  then gradually separated as far as possible, coming together again at  the end of the _decrescendo_.    Changes in quality are perhaps most frequently suggested by variation  in the facial expression, poise of body, _et cetera_, while phrasing  is often indicated by a movement of the left hand (thus signaling some  part to begin or stop) or by a lifting of the arms and shoulders at  the breathing point, thus simulating the action of the lungs in taking  breath, and causing the singers or players actually to take a breath  by instinctive imitation. The manner in which the baton is grasped and  manipulated is of course another way of indicating these various  expressional effects, this being especially noticeable in the case of  phrasing, which is perhaps most often indicated by simply raising the  baton higher at the end of a phrase, thus preparing it for a longer  sweep at the beginning of the following phrase. But all of these  things are done in different ways by various conductors, and no set  rules can therefore be formulated.    The most important point to be noted by the beginner in conducting is  that one must not direct with merely the hand and arm, but must use  the entire body from head to toe in communicating to his chorus or  orchestra his own emotion. Facial expression, the manner of grasping  the baton, the set of the shoulders, the elevation of the chest, the  position of the feet, the poise of the head--all these must he  indicative of the emotional tone of the music being rendered. But be  sure you feel a genuine emotion which leads you to do these various  things, and do not play to the audience by going through all kinds of  contortions that are not prompted at all by the meaning of the music,  but are called into existence entirely by the conductor's desire to  have the audience think that he is a great interpreter. If the  conductor does his work at any point in such a fashion that the  audience watches him and is filled with marvel and admiration because  of the interesting movements that he is making, instead of listening  to the chorus or orchestra and being thrilled by the beautiful music  that is being heard, then that conductor is retarding rather than  advancing the progress of art appreciation; in short he is failing in  his mission. One of the sincerest compliments that the writer has ever  received came when he asked his wife whether he had conducted well at  a certain public performance, and she replied that she guessed it was  all right, but that she had been so absorbed in listening to the music  that she had not thought of him at all!    The development of modern orchestral and operatic music has brought  about a tremendous change in the prominence of the conductor, and  there is no doubt but that his part in musical performance is now more  important than that of any other type of interpreter, being probably  second in importance only to that of the composer. From having been  originally a mere time-beater, he has now come to be the interpreter  _par excellence_; and as Weingartner remarks (_op. cit._, p. 9) in  referring to Wagner's conducting:         He is often able to transform as if by magic a more or less       indefinite sound picture into a beautifully shaped,       heart-moving vision, making people ask themselves in       astonishment how it is that this work which they had long       thought they knew should have all at once become quite       another thing. And the unprejudiced mind joyfully confesses,       \"Thus, thus, must it be.\"    It will soon be discovered by the amateur that in every case where an  effect such as that described by Weingartner has been brought about,  it is because the conductor has studied the music and has then made  gestures which were prompted by his sympathetic response to the  thought of the composer. In other words, the conducting was effective  because the feeling which prompted the gestures came from within, as  is always the case when an orator or an actor moves us deeply. This is  what is meant by interpretation in conducting; and we can scarcely do  better, in concluding our discussion of the whole matter, than to  quote once more from a writer to whom we have already referred.[22]    [Footnote 22: C.F.A. Williams, _The Rhythm of Modern Music_, p. 18.]         The great interpreters of instrumental music are those who       can most nearly enter into the composer's ideals, or can       even improve upon them, and who are able to give a delicacy       or force of accentuation or phrasing which it is outside of       the possibility of notation to express.... The days of cold,       classical performance of great works are practically over.       The executant or conductor now seeks to stir the deeper       emotions of his audience, and to do so he must pay homage to       the artist who conceived the work, by interpreting it with       enthusiasm and warmth.          CHAPTER VIII    THE SUPERVISOR OF MUSIC AS CONDUCTOR      [Sidenote: THE FIELD OF SCHOOL MUSIC]    The phenomenal progress which has been made during recent years in the  music departments of both the grades and the high schools of our great  public educational systems, together with the fact that a large number  of young men and women of real musical ability are entering the field  of public school music as a life work, make it seem worth while to  include a chapter upon the work of the music supervisor as conductor.  The writer has long contended that the public school systems of this  country offered the most significant opportunity for influencing the  musical taste of a nation that has ever existed. If this be true, then  it is highly important that the teachers of music in these school  systems shall be men and women who are, in the first place, thoroughly  trained musicians; in the second place, broadly educated along general  lines; and in the third place, imbued with a knowledge concerning, and  a spirit of enthusiasm for, what free education along cultural lines  is able to accomplish in the lives of the common people. In connection  with this latter kind of knowledge, the supervisor of music will, of  course, need also to become somewhat intimately acquainted with  certain basic principles and practical methods of both general  pedagogy and music education.    We are not writing a treatise on music in the public schools, and  shall therefore not attempt to acquaint the reader, in the space of  one chapter, with even the fundamental principles of school music  teaching. We shall merely call attention to certain phases of the  supervisor's work that seem to come within the scope of a book on  conducting.    [Sidenote: DIFFICULTIES INVOLVED IN TEACHING LARGE GROUPS]    The first point that we should like to have noted in this connection  is that teaching a group of from forty to one hundred children all at  the same time is a vastly different matter from giving individual  instruction to a number of pupils separately. The teacher of a class  needs to be much more energetic, much more magnetic, much more capable  of keeping things moving and of keeping everyone interested in the  work and therefore out of mischief; he needs, in short, to possess in  high degree those qualities involved in leadership and organization  that were cited in an earlier chapter as necessary for the conductor  in general. In teaching individual pupils one need not usually think  of the problem of _discipline_ at all; but, in giving instruction to a  class of from thirty to forty children in the public schools, one  inevitably finds in the same group those with musical ability and  those without it; those who are interested in the music lesson and  those who are indifferent or even openly scornful; those who are full  of energy and enthusiasm and those who are lazy and indifferent and  will do only what they are made to do; those who have had lessons on  piano or violin and have acquired considerable proficiency in  performance, and those who have just come in from an outlying rural  school where no music has ever been taught, and are therefore not able  to read music, have no musical perception or taste whatsoever, and are  frequently not even able to \"carry a tune.\" In dealing with such  heterogeneous classes, problems of discipline as well as problems of  pedagogy are bound to arise, and it requires rare tact and skill in  working out details of procedure, as well as a broad vision of the  ultimate end to be accomplished, to bring order out of such musical  chaos. And yet precisely this result is being secured by hundreds of  music teachers and supervisors all over the country; and the musical  effects of a fifteen-minute daily practice period are already  surprisingly evident, and will undoubtedly become more and more  manifest as the years go by. The outlook for the future is wholly  inspiring indeed; and no musician need fear that in taking up public  school music he is entering upon a field of work which is too small  for one"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22396"],[0,"King Arthur's Knights (#15)"],[1,"a shock that their spears were splintered. They then closed  fiercely with their swords, and hurtled about in the foaming, dashing  water, beating at each other. Suddenly Beaumains struck the other so  hard a stroke on his helm that he was stunned, and fell from his horse  into the stream, which whirled him away into the deeps, and there  drowned him.    Then Beaumains rode swiftly towards the other knight, who with his  lance dashed against him. But Beaumains parried the spear stroke, and  with one great heave of his sword, clove the other's helm in twain, so  that the knight fell like a stone.    'Alas!' cried the lady, as she came across the ford, 'that ever kitchen  knave should have the mishap to slay two such noble knights! Doubtless  thou thinkest thou hast done mightily, sir knight of the turnspit, but  I saw well how it all happened. The first knight's horse stumbled on  the stones of the ford, and the other thou didst stab from behind.  'Twas a shameful deed!'    'Damsel,' said Beaumains, quiet in words though hot of mind at her  words, 'ye may say what ye will. I only know that I fight fairly, as  God gives me strength. I reck not what ye say, so I win your lady  sister from her oppressor.'    'Thou knave of impudence!' cried the lady. 'Thee to speak of winning my  lady sister, high of rank and rich in wide lands as she is! But thou  shalt soon see knights that shall abate thy pride.'    'Whatever knights they be, I care not, so that I win good words from  you at last,' said Beaumains.    'Those thou shalt never have, thou churl,' replied the lady scornfully.  'For all that thou hast done has been by chance and misadventure, and  not by the prowess of thy hands. But if thou wilt follow me, why, then,  come, and I shall the more quickly be rid of thee, for of a surety thou  wilt soon be slain.'    Beaumains answered naught, and so they went on their way.    [Illustration: BEAUMAINS WINS THE FIGHT AT THE FORD]      Thus they fared until evensong, and then they came to a waste land,  where their way led through a narrow darkling valley. And at the head  thereof they entered upon a wide land, black and drear to the very  skies, and beside the way was a black hawthorn, and thereon hung a  black banner and a black shield, and by it, stuck upright, was a long  black spear, and beside it was a great black horse covered with silk,  and a black stone fast by it.    And upon the stone sat a knight in black armour, at sight of whom the  damsel cried:    'Now, my kitchen knight, 'tis not too late. Fly back through the  valley, or this knight will surely slay thee.'    'Nay, I will not,' said Beaumains, 'for I fear him not.'    The black knight came to the damsel and asked if she had brought this  knight from King Arthur's court to be her champion.    'Fie!' she said angrily, 'he is no knight. He is but a knave that was  fed for alms in the king's kitchen, and would follow me in spite of all  I say. And I would that you would rid me of him. To-day he slew two  noble knights at the passage of the water, and all by evil chance.'    'A strong knave, in truth,' answered the knight, 'and a saucy one. Then  this will I do. He shall leave me his horse and armour, for since he is  but a knave, my knightly hands may not harm him.'    'You speak lightly of my horse and armour,' said Beaumains, 'but I will  have you know that you get naught from me, and moreover I will pass  these lands with this lady in spite of you.'    'Thou knave!' cried the knight angrily, 'yield me this lady and thyself  without ado!'    'Let me see what thou canst do to take us,' replied Beaumains, and  laughed gaily.    At this the knight in a rage leaped upon his horse and they thundered  together. The black knight's spear broke, but Beaumains' lance pierced  him through the side and broke off short. Nevertheless, though badly  wounded, the black knight drew his sword and fought manfully, striking  Beaumains many mighty blows and bruising him sorely.    But suddenly his lifted sword fell from his hand, and turning in his  saddle, he dropped to the ground in a swoon, and shortly died.    And Beaumains, seeing that the black armour was better than his own,  armed himself in it with the aid of his dwarf squire, and rode after  the damsel.    But ever as before she railed at him, telling him he had conquered the  black knight by a cowardly blow; but Beaumains would answer her nothing  in anger.    Anon they came to the edge of a vast and dark forest, and from its  shadows came a knight in green armour, who cried to the damsel:    'Lady, is that my brother the Black Knight whom ye bring riding behind  ye?'    'Nay, sir knight, it is not your brother,' she replied. 'It is but a  kitchen knave who by treachery hath slain your noble brother, the  Knight of the Black Lands.'    'Thou traitor!' cried the green knight. 'Now shalt thou surely die, for  my brother, Sir Percard, was a most noble knight and a valiant. And to  think that he fell by the dirty hand of a knave is great shame.'    'I am no knave!' said Beaumains, 'but of lineage as high as thine,  maybe. And I slew your brother in knightly fashion.'    But the green knight stayed not to answer, and they hurtled together,  and clashed midway as if it were thunder. And Beaumains' stroke was so  mighty that both the green knight and his horse fell to the ground.    Swiftly the green knight rose to his feet, and then, Beaumains having  alighted, they rushed together with their swords, and stood a long time  hacking, thrusting and parrying. And each hurt the other sorely.    'Oh, my lord, the green knight,' cried the damsel, 'why do ye stand so  long fighting with that kitchen knave? A shame it is to see a proved  knight matched by a dirty scullion! Slay him for me and be done!'    Shamed by her words the green knight gave a fierce stroke and clove  Beaumains' shield in twain. Then Beaumains, smarting with this blow,  and in anger at the words of the lady, suddenly gave the green knight  so great a stroke that he fell upon his knees, and then was thrust  grovelling upon the earth.    Swiftly Beaumains cut the fastenings of his helm, and, tearing it off,  lifted his sword to strike off the other's head.    But the green knight prayed of his mercy and pleaded hard for his life.    'Thou shalt plead in vain,' said Beaumains, 'unless this lady shall beg  thy life of me.'    'Shame on thee, thou kitchen knave!' cried the lady, biting her lip  with anger. 'Thinkest thou I shall crave aught of thee, and be so  beholden to thee?'    'Then he shall die!' cried Beaumains.    'O lady, suffer me not to die!' cried the prostrate knight, 'when a  fair word from you will save my life. And you, sir knight, give me my  life, and I will yield myself and thirty knights to be your men and do  your commands while they live.'    'Now that is a grievous shame!' cried the lady, 'What, Sir Green  Knight, art such a coward as to crave thy life of a scullion knave, and  promise him thirty knights' service!'    'You and your thirty knights shall avail you naught,' said Beaumains  grimly, 'and since this lady will not beg thy life of me, why, now I  shall slay thee.'    With that he raised the sword, but the lady cried out:    'Put down, thou rascally knave, and slay him not, or thou shalt repent  it!'    'Lady,' said Beaumains, and bowed full gently, 'your command is to me a  pleasure, and at your desire I give him his life.'    Then the green knight did homage to Beaumains and gave up his sword.  Afterwards he took them to his castle near by, where they passed the  night.    Next morning the green knight, whose name was Sir Pertolope,  accompanied them some distance on their way, and at parting he told  Beaumains that he and his thirty knights would do service when and  where he might desire. Thereupon Beaumains told him that he must go and  yield himself and his knights to King Arthur, and this Sir Pertolope  promised faithfully to do.    And again, when they had gone some way and had reached a little town, a  knight challenged Beaumains, who, having fought with the stranger and  overpowered him, threatened to slay him unless the lady begged for his  life. This she did, after she had said many bitter and evil things, and  Beaumains commanded the knight to go, with threescore knights which  were in his service, and yield himself up to King Arthur.    Then Beaumains and the lady went on again, and the lady was full of  rage in that she had been compelled a second time to plead with him for  the life of a knight.    'Thou shalt get thy full wages to-day, sir kitchen knight,' said she,  'for in a little while there will meet us the most valiant knight in  the world, after King Arthur. Methinks thou wouldst do the better part  to flee, for the evil luck which thou hast had with the three knights  you have overcome will not avail thee upon this one.'    'Madam,' said Beaumains, 'ye know that ye are uncourteous so to  reproach me. I have done you great service these three days, but ever  ye call me coward and kitchen knave. Yet those who have come against  me, whom you said would beat me, are now either slain or have yielded  homage to me.'    'The greater shame,' said the lady, 'that so lowborn a churl as thou  art should have knights yield to thee who should have slain thee.'    Beaumains answered nothing more, but his heart was very heavy at the  thought that, do what he might, he could not win this lady to speak  fairly of him.    Towards noon, as they rode, they saw the white towers of a fair city,  and before its gates was a field newly mown, with many tents therein of  divers rich colours.    'Lo, there is the town of the man that shall cut thy comb, thou proud  varlet!' said the lady. 'A brave and proved knight is he, by name Sir  Persaunt of Mynnid. And he hath a following of five hundred knights and  men-at-arms.'    'A goodly lord, indeed,' replied Beaumains, 'and one I fain would see.'    The lady laughed mockingly.    "]]]
