Where now is wood, long ere this day    Two broad and fertile lands,  Malaja and Karusha lay,    Adorned by heavenly hands.  Here, mourning friendship's broken ties,  Lord Indra of the thousand eyes  Hungered and sorrowed many a day,  His brightness soiled with mud and clay,  When in a storm of passion he  Had slain his dear friend Namuchi.  Then came the Gods and saints who bore  Their golden pitchers brimming o'er  With holy streams that banish stain,  And bathed Lord Indra pure again.  When in this land the God was freed  From spot and stain of impious deed  For that his own dear friend he slew,  High transport thrilled his bosom through.  Then in his joy the lands he blessed,  And gave a boon they long possessed:  \"Because these fertile lands retain  The washings of the blot and stain,\"    'Twas thus Lord Indra sware,  \"Malaja and Karusha's name  Shall celebrate with deathless fame    My malady and care.\"(162)  \"So be it,\" all the Immortals cried,    When Indra's speech they heard,  And with acclaim they ratified    The names his lips conferred.  Long time, O victor of thy foes,  These happy lands had sweet repose,  And higher still in fortune rose.  At length a spirit, loving ill,  Tadaka, wearing shapes at will,  Whose mighty strength, exceeding vast,  A thousand elephants, surpassed,  Was to fierce Sunda, lord and head  Of all the demon armies, wed.  From her, Lord Indra's peer in might  Giant Maricha sprang to light:  And she, a constant plague and pest,  These two fair realms has long distressed.  Now dwelling in her dark abode  A league away she bars the road:  And we, O Rama, hence must go  Where lies the forest of the foe.  Now on thine own right arm rely,    And my command obey:  Smite the foul monster that she die,    And take the plague away.  To reach this country none may dare    Fallen from its old estate,  Which she, whose fury naught can bear,    Has left so desolate.  And now my truthful tale is told    How with accursed sway  The spirit plagued this wood of old,    And ceases not to-day.\"          Canto XXVII. The Birth Of Tadaka.      When thus the sage without a peer  Had closed that story strange to hear,  Rama again the saint addressed  To set one lingering doubt at rest:  \"O holy man, 'tis said by all  That spirits' strength is weak and small:  How can she match, of power so slight,  A thousand elephants in might?\"  And Visvamitra thus replied  To Raghu's son the glorified:  \"Listen, and I will tell thee how  She gained the strength that arms her now.  A mighty spirit lived of yore;  Suketu was the name he bore.  Childless was he, and free from crime  In rites austere he passed his time.  The mighty Sire was pleased to show  His favour, and a child bestow.  Tadaka named, most fair to see,  A pearl among the maids was she,  And matched, for such was Brahma's dower,  A thousand elephants in power.  Nor would the Eternal Sire, although  The spirit longed, a son bestow  That maid in beauty's youthful pride  Was given to Sunda for a bride.  Her son, Maricha was his name,  A giant, through a curse, became.  She, widowed, dared with him molest  Agastya,(163) of all saints the best.  Inflamed with hunger's wildest rage,  Roaring she rushed upon the sage.  When the great hermit saw her near,  On speeding in her fierce career,  He thus pronounced Maricha's doom:  \"A giant's form and shape assume.\"  And then, by mighty anger swayed,  On Tadaka this curse he laid:  \"Thy present form and semblance quit,  And wear a shape thy mood to fit;  Changed form and feature by my ban,  A fearful thing that feeds on man.\"      She, by his awful curse possessed,  And mad with rage that fills her breast,  Has on this land her fury dealt  Where once the saint Agastya dwelt.  Go, Rama, smite this monster dead,  The wicked plague, of power so dread,  And further by this deed of thine  The good of Brahmans and of kine.  Thy hand alone can overthrow,  In all the worlds, this impious foe.  Nor let compassion lead thy mind  To shrink from blood of womankind;  A monarch's son must ever count  The people's welfare paramount,  And whether pain or joy he deal  Dare all things for his subjects' weal;  Yea, if the deed bring praise or guilt,  If life be saved or blood be spilt:  Such, through all time, should be the care  Of those a kingdom's weight who bear.  Slay, Rama, slay this impious fiend,  For by no law her life is screened.  So Manthara, as bards have told,  Virochan's child, was slain of old  By Indra, when in furious hate  She longed the earth to devastate.  So Kavya's mother, Bhrigu's wife,  Who loved her husband as her life,  When Indra's throne she sought to gain,  By Vishnu's hand of yore was slain.  By these and high-souled kings beside,  Struck down, have lawless women died.\"          Canto XXVIII. The Death Of Tadaka.      Thus spoke the saint. Each vigorous word  The noble monarch's offspring heard,  And, reverent hands together laid,  His answer to the hermit made:  \"My sire and mother bade me aye  Thy word, O mighty Saint, obey  So will I, O most glorious, kill  This Tadaka who joys in ill,  For such my sire's, and such thy will.  To aid with mine avenging hand  The Brahmans, kine, and all the land,  Obedient, heart and soul, I stand.\"      Thus spoke the tamer of the foe,  And by the middle grasped his bow.  Strongly he drew the sounding string  That made the distant welkin ring.  Scared by the mighty clang the deer  That roamed the forest shook with fear,  And Tadaka the echo heard,  And rose in haste from slumber stirred.  In wild amaze, her soul aflame  With fury toward the spot she came.  When that foul shape of evil mien  And stature vast as e'er was seen  The wrathful son of Raghu eyed,  He thus unto his brother cried:  \"Her dreadful shape, O Lakshman, see,  A form to shudder at and flee.  The hideous monster's very view  Would cleave a timid heart in two.  Behold the demon hard to smite,  Defended by her magic might.  My hand shall stay her course to-day,  And shear her nose and ears away.  No heart have I her life to take:  I spare it for her sex's sake.  My will is but, with minished force,  To check her in her evil course.\"  While thus he spoke, by rage impelled    Roaring as she came nigh,  The fiend her course at Rama held    With huge arms tossed on high.  Her, rushing on, the seer assailed    With a loud cry of hate;  And thus the sons of Raghu hailed:    \"Fight, and be fortunate.\"  Then from the earth a horrid cloud    Of dust the demon raised,  And for awhile in darkling shroud    Wrapt Raghu's sons amazed.  Then calling on her magic power    The fearful fight to wage,  She smote him with a stony shower,    Till Rama burned with rage.  Then pouring forth his arrowy rain    That stony flood to stay,  With winged darts, as she charged amain,    He shore her hands away.  As Tadaka still thundered near    Thus maimed by Rama's blows,  Lakshman in fury severed sheer    The monster's ears and nose.  Assuming by her magic skill    A fresh and fresh disguise,  She tried a thousand shapes at will,    Then vanished from their eyes.  When Gadhi's son of high renown  Still saw the stony rain pour down  Upon each princely warrior's head,  With words of wisdom thus he said:  \"Enough of mercy, Rama, lest  This sinful evil-working pest,  Disturber of each holy rite,  Repair by magic arts her might.  Without delay the fiend should die,  For, see, the twilight hour is nigh.  And at the joints of night and day  Such giant foes are hard to slay.\"  Then Rama, skilful to direct    His arrow to the sound,  With shafts the mighty demon checked    Who rained her stones around.  She sore impeded and beset  By Rama and his arrowy net,  Though skilled in guile and magic lore,  Rushed on the brothers with a roar.  Deformed, terrific, murderous, dread,  Swift as the levin on she sped,  Like cloudy pile in autumn's sky,  Lifting her two vast arms on high,  When Rama smote her with a dart,  Shaped like a crescent, to the heart.  Sore wounded by the shaft that came  With lightning speed and surest aim,  Blood spouting from her mouth and side,  She fell upon the earth and died.  Soon as the Lord who rules the sky  Saw the dread monster lifeless lie,  He called aloud, Well done! well done!  And the Gods honoured Raghu's son.  Standing in heaven the Thousand-eyed,  With all the Immortals, joying cried:  \"Lift up thine eyes, O Saint, and see  The Gods and Indra nigh to thee.  This deed of Rama's boundless might  Has filled our bosoms with delight,  Now, for our will would have it so,  To Raghu's son some favour show.  Invest him with the power which naught  But penance gains and holy thought,  Those heavenly arms on him bestow  To thee entrusted long ago  By great Krisasva best of kings,  Son of the Lord of living things.  More fit recipient none can be  Than he who joys it following thee;  And for our sakes the monarch's seed  Has yet to do a mighty deed.\"      He spoke; and all the heavenly train  Rejoicing sought their homes again,  While honour to the saint they paid.  Then came the evening's twilight shade,  The best of hermits overjoyed  To know the monstrous fiend destroyed,  His lips on Rama's forehead pressed,  And thus the conquering chief addressed:  \"O Rama gracious to the sight.  Here will we pass the present night,  And with the morrow's earliest ray  Bend to my hermitage our way.\"  The son of Dasaratha heard,  Delighted, Visvamitra's word,  And as he bade, that night he spent  In Tadaka's wild wood, content.  And the grove shone that happy day,  Freed from the curse that on it lay,  Like Chaitraratha(164) fair and gay.          Canto XXIX. The Celestial Arms.      That night they slept and took their rest;  And then the mighty saint addressed,  With pleasant smile and accents mild  These words to Raghu's princely child:  \"Well pleased am I. High fate be thine,  Thou scion of a royal line.  Now will I, for I love thee so,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24873"],[0,"Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1896 to 1901 (#15)"],[1,"yes.    \"And you do not regret it?\"    He bent down a little. His sleeve brushed against her shoulder.  Something in his face arrested the answer she meant to make.    \"I--I--did not say that,\" she murmured faintly.    There was a burst of cheering. The free-for-all horses were being  brought out for the sixth heat. She turned away to watch them. The  scoring began, and seemed likely to have no end. She was tired of it  all. It didn't matter a pin to her whether \"Lu-Lu\" or \"Mascot\" won.  What _did_ matter! Had Vanity Fair after all been a satisfying  exchange for love? He _had_ loved her once, and they had been happy at  first. She had never before said, even in her own heart: \"I am sorry,\"  but--suddenly, she felt his hand on her shoulder, and looked up. Their  eyes met. He stooped and said almost in a whisper:    \"Will you come back to me?\"    \"I don't know,\" she whispered breathlessly, as one half-fascinated.    \"We were both to blame--but I the most. I was too hard on you--I ought  to have made more allowance. We are wiser now both of us. Come back  to me--my wife.\"    His tone was cold and his face expressionless. It was on her lips to  cry out \"No,\" passionately.    But the slender, scholarly hand on her shoulder was trembling with the  intensity of his repressed emotion. He _did_ care, then. A wild  caprice flashed into her brain. She sprang up.    \"See,\" she cried, \"they're off now. This heat will probably decide the  race. If 'Lu-Lu' wins I will not go back to you, if 'Mascot' does I  will. That is my decision.\"    He turned paler, but bowed in assent. He knew by bitter experience how  unchangeable her whims were, how obstinately she clung to even the  most absurd.    She leaned forward breathlessly. The crowd hung silently on the track.  \"Lu-Lu\" and \"Mascot\" were neck and neck, getting in splendid work.  Half-way round the course \"Lu-Lu\" forged half a neck ahead, and her  backers went mad. But one woman dropped her head in her hands and  dared look no more. One man with white face and set lips watched the  track unswervingly.    Again \"Mascot\" crawled up, inch by inch. They were on the home  stretch, they were equal, the cheering broke out, then silence, then  another terrific burst, shouts, yells and clappings--\"Mascot\" had won  the free-for-all. In the front row a woman stood up, swayed and shaken  as a leaf in the wind. She straightened her scarlet hat and readjusted  her veil unsteadily. There was a smile on her lips and tears in her  eyes. No one noticed her. A man beside her drew her hand through his  arm in a quiet proprietary fashion. They left the grand stand  together.          Lilian's Business Venture      Lilian Mitchell turned into the dry-goods store on Randall Street,  just as Esther Miller and Ella Taylor came out. They responded coldly  to her greeting and exchanged significant glances as they walked away.    Lilian's pale face crimsoned. She was a tall, slender girl of about  seventeen, and dressed in mourning. These girls had been her close  friends once. But that was before the Mitchells had lost their money.  Since then Lilian had been cut by many of her old chums and she felt  it keenly.    The clerks in the store were busy and Lilian sat down to wait her  turn. Near to her two ladies were also waiting and chatting.    \"Helen wants me to let her have a birthday party,\" Mrs. Saunders was  saying wearily. \"She has been promised it so long and I hate to  disappoint the child, but our girl left last week, and I cannot  possibly make all the cakes and things myself. I haven't the time or  strength, so Helen must do without her party.\"    \"Talking of girls,\" said Mrs. Reeves impatiently, \"I am almost  discouraged. It is so hard to get a good all-round one. The last one I  had was so saucy I had to discharge her, and the one I have now cannot  make decent bread. I never had good luck with bread myself either.\"    \"That is Mrs. Porter's great grievance too. It is no light task to  bake bread for all those boarders. Have you made your jelly yet?\"    \"No. Maria cannot make it, she says, and I detest messing with jelly.  But I really must see to it soon.\"    At this point a saleswoman came up to Lilian, who made her small  purchases and went out.    \"There goes Lilian Mitchell,\" said Mrs. Reeves in an undertone. \"She  looks very pale. They say they are dreadfully poor since Henry  Mitchell died. His affairs were in a bad condition, I am told.\"    \"I am sorry for Mrs. Mitchell,\" responded Mrs. Saunders. \"She is such  a sweet woman. Lilian will have to do something, I suppose, and there  is so little chance for a girl here.\"    Lilian, walking down the street, was wearily turning over in her mind  the problems of her young existence. Her father had died the preceding  spring. He had been a supposedly prosperous merchant; the Mitchells  had always lived well, and Lilian was a petted and only child. Then  came the shock of Henry Mitchell's sudden death and of financial ruin.  His affairs were found to be hopelessly involved; when all the debts  were paid there was left only the merest pittance--barely enough for  house-rent--for Lilian and her mother to live upon. They had moved  into a tiny cottage in an unfashionable locality, and during the  summer Lilian had tried hard to think of something to do. Mrs.  Mitchell was a delicate woman, and the burden of their situation fell  on Lilian's young shoulders.    There seemed to be no place for her. She could not teach and had no  particular talent in any line. There was no opening for her in  Willington, which was a rather sleepy little place, and Lilian was  almost in despair.    \"There really doesn't seem to be any real place in the world for me,  Mother,\" she said rather dolefully at the supper table. \"I've no  talent at all; it is dreadful to have been born without one. And yet I  _must_ do something, and do it soon.\"    And Lilian, after she had washed up the tea dishes, went upstairs and  had a good cry.    But the darkest hour, so the proverb goes, is just before the dawn,  and after Lilian had had her cry out and was sitting at her window in  the dusk, watching a thin new moon shining over the trees down the  street, her inspiration came to her. A minute later she whirled into  the tiny sitting-room where her mother was sewing.    \"Mother, our fortune is made! I have an idea!\"    \"Don't lose it, then,\" said Mrs. Mitchell with a smile. \"What is it,  my dear?\"    Lilian sobered herself, sat down by her mother's side, and proceeded  to recount the conversation she had heard in the store that afternoon.    \"Now, Mother, this is where my brilliant idea comes in. You have often  told me I am a born cook and I always have good luck. Now, tomorrow  morning I shall go to Mrs. Saunders and offer to furnish all the good  things for Helen's birthday party, and then I'll ask Mrs. Reeves and  Mrs. Porter if I may make their bread for them. That will do for a  beginning, I like cooking, you know, and I believe that in time I can  work up a good business.\"    \"It seems to be a good idea,\" said Mrs. Mitchell thoughtfully, \"and I  am willing that you should try. But have you thought it all out  carefully? There will be many difficulties.\"    \"I know. I don't expect smooth sailing right along, and perhaps I'll  fail altogether; but somehow I don't believe I will.\"    \"A great many of your old friends will think--\"    \"Oh, yes; I know _that_ too, but I am not going to mind it, Mother. I  don't think there is any disgrace in working for my living. I'm going  to do my best and not care what people say.\"    Early next morning Lilian started out. She had carefully thought over  the details of her small venture, considered ways and means, and  decided on the most advisable course. She would not attempt too much,  and she felt sure of success.    To secure competent servants was one of the problems of Willington  people. At Drayton, a large neighbouring town, were several factories,  and into these all the working girls from Willington had crowded,  leaving very few who were willing to go out to service. Many of those  who did were poor cooks, and Lilian shrewdly suspected that many a  harassed housekeeper in the village would be glad to avail herself of  the new enterprise.    Lilian was, as she had said of herself, \"a born cook.\" This was her  capital, and she meant to make the most of it. Mrs. Saunders listened  to her businesslike details with surprise and delight.    \"It is the very thing,\" she said. \"Helen is so eager for that party,  but I could not undertake it myself. Her birthday is Friday. Can you  have everything ready by then?\"    \"Yes, I think so,\" said Lilian briskly, producing her notebook.  \"Please give me the list of what you want and I will do my best.\"    From Mrs. Saunders she went to Mrs. Reeves and found a customer as  soon as she had told the reason of her call. \"I'll furnish all the  bread and rolls you need,\" she said, \"and they will be good, too. Now,  about your jelly. I can make good jelly, and I'll be very glad to make  yours.\"    When she left, Lilian had an order for two dozen glasses of apple  jelly, as well as a standing one for bread and rolls. Mrs. Porter was  next visited and grasped eagerly at the opportunity.    \"I know your bread will be good,\" she said, \"and you may count on me  as a regular customer.\"    Lilian thought she had enough on hand for a first attempt and went  home satisfied. On her way she called at the grocery store with an  order that surprised Mr. Hooper. When she told him of her plan he  opened his eyes.    \"I must tell my wife about that. She isn't strong and she doesn't like  cooking.\"    After dinner Lilian went to work, enveloped in a big apron, and  whipped eggs, stoned raisins, stirred, concocted, and baked until  dark. When bedtime came she was so tired that she could hardly crawl  upstairs; but she felt happy too, for the day had been a successful  one.    And so also were the days and weeks and"]]]
