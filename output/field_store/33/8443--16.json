I do not say this in any sense as a criticism. As it happens, I am  particularly fond of wood. Of all the superstitions which our fathers  took lightly enough to love, the most natural seems to me the notion it  is lucky to touch wood. Some of them affect me the less as  superstitions, because I feel them as symbols. If humanity had really  thought Friday unlucky it would have talked about bad Friday instead of  good Friday. And while I feel the thrill of thirteen at a table, I am  not so sure that it is the most miserable of all human fates to fill the  places of the Twelve Apostles. But the idea that there was something  cleansing or wholesome about the touching of wood seems to me one of  those ideas which are truly popular, because they are truly poetic. It  is probable enough that the conception came originally from the healing  of the wood of the Cross; but that only clinches the divine coincidence.  It is like that other divine coincidence that the Victim was a  carpenter, who might almost have made His own cross. Whether we take the  mystical or the mythical explanation, there is obviously a very deep  connection between the human working in wood and such plain and pathetic  mysticism. It gives something like a touch of the holy childishness to  the tale, as if that terrible engine could be a toy. In the same fashion  a child fancies that mysterious and sinister horse, which was the  downfall of Troy, as something plain and staring, and perhaps spotted,  like his own rocking-horse in the nursery.    It might be said symbolically that Americans have a taste for  rocking-horses, as they certainly have a taste for rocking-chairs. A  flippant critic might suggest that they select rocking-chairs so that,  even when they are sitting down, they need not be sitting still.  Something of this restlessness in the race may really be involved in the  matter; but I think the deeper significance of the rocking-chair may  still be found in the deeper symbolism of the rocking-horse. I think  there is behind all this fresh and facile use of wood a certain spirit  that is childish in the good sense of the word; something that is  innocent, and easily pleased. It is not altogether untrue, still less is  it unfriendly, to say that the landscape seems to be dotted with dolls'  houses. It is the true tragedy of every fallen son of Adam that he has  grown too big to live in a doll's house. These things seem somehow to  escape the irony of time by not even challenging it; they are too  temporary even to be merely temporal. These people are not building  tombs; they are not, as in the fine image of Mrs. Meynell's poem, merely  building ruins. It is not easy to imagine the ruins of a doll's house;  and that is why a doll's house is an everlasting habitation. How far it  promises a political permanence is a matter for further discussion; I am  only describing the mood of discovery; in which all these cottages built  of lath, like the palaces of a pantomime, really seemed coloured like  the clouds of morning; which are both fugitive and eternal.    There is also in all this an atmosphere that comes in another sense from  the nursery. We hear much of Americans being educated on English  literature; but I think few Americans realise how much English children  have been educated on American literature. It is true, and it is  inevitable, that they can only be educated on rather old-fashioned  American literature. Mr. Bernard Shaw, in one of his plays, noted truly  the limitations of the young American millionaire, and especially the  staleness of his English culture; but there is necessarily another side  to it. If the American talked more of Macaulay than of Nietzsche, we  should probably talk more of Emerson than of Ezra Pound. Whether this  staleness is necessarily a disadvantage is, of course, a different  question. But, in any case, it is true that the old American books were  often the books of our childhood, even in the literal sense of the books  of our nursery. I know few men in England who have not left their  boyhood to some extent lost and entangled in the forests of _Huckleberry  Finn_. I know few women in England, from the most revolutionary  Suffragette to the most carefully preserved Early Victorian, who will  not confess to having passed a happy childhood with the Little Women of  Miss Alcott. _Helen's Babies_ was the first and by far the best book in  the modern scriptures of baby-worship. And about all this old-fashioned  American literature there was an undefinable savour that satisfied, and  even fed, our growing minds. Perhaps it was the smell of growing things;  but I am far from certain that it was not simply the smell of wood. Now  that all the memory comes back to me, it seems to come back heavy in a  hundred forms with the fragrance and the touch of timber. There was the  perpetual reference to the wood-pile, the perpetual background of the  woods. There was something crude and clean about everything; something  fresh and strange about those far-off houses, to which I could not then  have put a name. Indeed, many things become clear in this wilderness of  wood, which could only be expressed in symbol and even in fantasy. I  will not go so far as to say that it shortened the transition from Log  Cabin to White House; as if the White House were itself made of white  wood (as Oliver Wendell Holmes said), 'that cuts like cheese, but lasts  like iron for things like these.' But I will say that the experience  illuminates some other lines by Holmes himself:--           Little I ask, my wants are few,       I only ask a hut of stone.      I should not have known, in England, that he was already asking for a  good deal even in asking for that. In the presence of this wooden world  the very combination of words seems almost a contradiction, like a hut  of marble, or a hovel of gold.    It was therefore with an almost infantile pleasure that I looked at all  this promising expansion of fresh-cut timber and thought of the housing  shortage at home. I know not by what incongruous movement of the mind  there swept across me, at the same moment, the thought of things  ancestral and hoary with the light of ancient dawns. The last war  brought back body-armour; the next war may bring back bows and arrows.  And I suddenly had a memory of old wooden houses in London; and a model  of Shakespeare's town.    It is possible indeed that such Elizabethan memories may receive a check  or a chill when the traveller comes, as he sometimes does, to the  outskirts of one of these strange hamlets of new frame-houses, and is  confronted with a placard inscribed in enormous letters, 'Watch Us  Grow.' He can always imagine that he sees the timbers swelling before  his eyes like pumpkins in some super-tropical summer. But he may have  formed the conviction that no such proclamation could be found outside  Shakespeare's town. And indeed there is a serious criticism here, to any  one who knows history; since the things that grow are not always the  things that remain; and pumpkins of that expansiveness have a tendency  to burst. I was always told that Americans were harsh, hustling, rather  rude and perhaps vulgar; but they were very practical and the future  belonged to them. I confess I felt a fine shade of difference; I liked  the Americans; I thought they were sympathetic, imaginative, and full of  fine enthusiasms; the one thing I could not always feel clear about was  their future. I believe they were happier in their frame-houses than  most people in most houses; having democracy, good education, and a  hobby of work; the one doubt that did float across me was something  like, 'Will all this be here at all in two hundred years?' That was the  first impression produced by the wooden houses that seemed like the  waggons of gipsies; it is a serious impression, but there is an answer  to it. It is an answer that opens on the traveller more and more as he  goes westward, and finds the little towns dotted about the vast central  prairies. And the answer is agriculture. Wooden houses may or may not  last; but farms will last; and farming will always last.    The houses may look like gipsy caravans on a heath or common; but they  are not on a heath or common. They are on the most productive and  prosperous land, perhaps, in the modern world. The houses might fall  down like shanties, but the fields would remain; and whoever tills  those fields will count for a great deal in the affairs of humanity.  They are already counting for a great deal, and possibly for too much,  in the affairs of America. The real criticism of the Middle West is  concerned with two facts, neither of which has been yet adequately  appreciated by the educated class in England. The first is that the turn  of the world has come, and the turn of the agricultural countries with  it. That is the meaning of the resurrection of Ireland; that is the  meaning of the practical surrender of the Bolshevist Jews to the Russian  peasants. The other is that in most places these peasant societies carry  on what may be called the Catholic tradition. The Middle West is perhaps  the one considerable place where they still carry on the Puritan  tradition. But the Puritan tradition was originally a tradition of the  town; and the second truth about the Middle West turns largely on its  moral relation to the town. As I shall suggest presently, there is much  in common between this agricultural society of America and the great  agricultural societies of Europe. It tends, as the agricultural society  nearly always does, to some decent degree of democracy. The agricultural  society tends to the agrarian law. But in Puritan America there is an  additional problem, which I can hardly explain without a periphrasis.    There was a time when the progress of the cities seemed to mock the  decay of the country.
