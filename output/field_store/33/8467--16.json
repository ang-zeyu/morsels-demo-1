The learned Hesiod did not say a single word  on this subject, though he was writing on the cultivation of the soil;  yet Homer, who in my opinion was many generations earlier, represents  Laertes as softening his regret for his son by cultivating and manuring  his farm. Nor is it only in cornfields and meadows and vineyards and  plantations that a farmer's life is made cheerful. There are the garden  and the orchard, the feeding of sheep, the swarms of bees, endless  varieties of flowers. Nor is it only planting out that charms: there  is also grafting--surely the most ingenious invention ever made by  husbandmen.    16. I might continue my list of the delights of country life; but even  what I have said I think is somewhat over long. However, you must  pardon me; for farming is a very favourite hobby of mine, and old age is  naturally rather garrulous--for I would not be thought to acquit it of  all faults.    Well, it was in a life of this sort that Manius Curius, after  celebrating triumphs over the Samnites, the Sabines, and Pyrrhus, spent  his last days. When I look at his villa--for it is not far from my  own--I never can enough admire the man's own frugality or the spirit of  the age. As Curius was sitting at his hearth the Samnites, who brought  him a large sum of gold, were repulsed by him; for it was not, he  said, a fine thing in his eyes to possess gold, but to rule those who  possessed it. Could such a high spirit fail to make old age pleasant?    But to return to farmers--not to wander from my own metier. In those  days there were senators, _i. e_. old men, on their farms. For L.  Quinctius Cincinnatus was actually at the plough when word was brought  him that he had been named Dictator. It was by his order as Dictator,  by the way, that C. Servilius Ahala, the Master of the Horse, seized  and put to death Spurius Maelius when attempting to obtain royal power.  Curius as well as other old men used to receive their summonses to  attend the Senate in their farm-houses, from which circumstance the  summoners were called _viatores_ or \"travellers.\" Was these men's old  age an object of pity who found their pleasure in the cultivation of the  land? In my opinion, scarcely any life can be more blessed, not alone  from its utility (for agriculture is beneficial to the whole human  race), but also as much from the mere pleasure of the thing, to which  I have already alluded, and from the rich abundance and supply of all  things necessary for the food of man and for the worship of the gods  above. So, as these are objects of desire to certain people, let us  make our peace with pleasure. For the good and hard-working farmer's  wine-cellar and oil-store, as well as his larder, are always well  filled, and his whole farm-house is richly furnished. It abounds in  pigs, goats, lambs, fowls, milk, cheese, and honey. Then there is the  garden, which the farmers themselves call their \"second flitch.\" A zest  and flavour is added to all these by hunting and fowling in spare hours.  Need I mention the greenery of meadows, the rows of trees, the beauty  of vineyard and olive-grove? I will put it briefly: nothing can either  furnish necessaries more richly, or present a fairer spectacle, than  well-cultivated land. And to the enjoyment of that, old age does not  merely present no hindrance--it actually invites and allures to it. For  where else can it better warm itself, either by basking in the sun or by  sitting by the fire, or at the proper time cool itself more wholesomely  by the help of shade or water? Let the young keep their arms then to  themselves, their horses, spears, their foils and ball, their swimming  baths and running path. To us old men let them, out of the many forms of  sport, leave dice and counters; but even that as they choose, since old  age can be quite happy without them.    17. Xenophon's books are very useful for many purposes. Pray go on  reading them with attention, as you have ever done. In what ample  terms is agriculture lauded by him in the book about husbanding one's  property, which is called _Oceonomicus_! But to show you that he thought  nothing so worthy of a prince as the taste for cultivating the soil, I  will translate what Socrates says to Critobulus in that book:    \"When that most gallant Lacedaemonian Lysander came to visit the Persian  prince Cyrus at Sardis, so eminent for his character and the glory of  his rule, bringing him presents from his allies, he treated Lysander  in all ways with courteous familiarity and kindness, and, among other  things, took him to see a certain park carefully planted. Lysander  expressed admiration of the height of the trees and the exact  arrangement of their rows in the quincunx, the careful cultivation  of the soil, its freedom from weeds, and the sweetness of the odours  exhaled from the flowers, and went on to say that what he admired was  not the industry only, but also the skill of the man by whom this had  been planned and laid out. Cyrus replied: 'Well, it was I who planned  the whole thing these rows are my doing, the laying out is all mine;  many of the trees were even planted by own hand.' Then Lysander, looking  at his purple robe, the brilliance of his person, and his adornment  Persian fashion with gold and many jewels, said: 'People are quite  right, Cyrus, to call you happy, since the advantages of high fortune  have been joined to an excellence like yours.'\"    This kind of good fortune, then, it is in the power of old men to enjoy;  nor is age any bar to our maintaining pursuits of every other kind, and  especially of agriculture, to the very extreme verge of old age. For  instance, we have it on record that M. Valerius Corvus kept it up to his  hundredth year, living on his land and cultivating it after his active  career was over, though between his first and sixth consulships there  was an interval of six and forty years. So that he had an official  career lasting the number of years which our ancestors defined as coming  between birth and the beginning of old age. Moreover, that last period  of his old age was more blessed than that of his middle life, inasmuch  as he had greater influence and less labour. For the crowning grace of  old age is influence.    How great was that of L. Caecilius Metellus! How great that of Atilius  Calatinus, over whom the famous epitaph was placed, \"Very many classes  agree in deeming this to have been the very first man of the nation\"!  The line cut on his tomb is well known. It is natural, then, that a man  should have had influence, in whose praise the verdict of history is  unanimous. Again, in recent times, what a great man was Publius Crassus,  Pontifex Maximus, and his successor in the same office, M. Lepidus! I  need scarcely mention Paulus or Africanus, or, as I did before, Maximus.  It was not only their senatorial utterances that had weight: their least  gesture had it also. In fact, old age, especially when it has enjoyed  honours, has an influence worth all the pleasures of youth put together.    18. But throughout my discourse remember that my panegyric applies to  an old age that has been established on foundations laid by youth. From  which may be deduced what I once said with universal applause, that  it was a wretched old age that had to defend itself by speech. Neither  white hairs nor wrinkles can at once claim influence in themselves: it  is the honourable conduct of earlier days that is rewarded by possessing  influence at the last. Even things generally regarded as trifling and  matters of course--being saluted, being courted, having way made for  one, people rising when one approaches, being escorted to and from the  forum, being referred to for advice--all these are marks of respect,  observed among us and in other States--always most sedulously where the  moral tone is highest. They say that Lysander the Spartan, whom I have  mentioned before, used to remark that Sparta was the most dignified home  for old age; for that nowhere was more respect paid to years, no-where  was old age held in higher honour. Nay, the story is told of how when  a man of advanced years came into the theatre at Athens when the games  were going on, no place was given him anywhere in that large assembly  by his own countrymen; but when he came near the Lacedaemonians, who as  ambassadors had a fixed place assigned to them, they rose as one man out  of respect for him, and gave the veteran a seat. When they were greeted  with rounds of applause from the whole audience, one of them remarked:    \"The Athenians know what is right, but will not do it.\" There are many  excellent rules in our augural college, but among the best is one which  affects our subject--that precedence in speech goes by seniority; and  augurs who are older are preferred only to those who have held higher  office, but even to those who are actually in possession of imperium.  What then are the physical pleasures to be compared with the reward of  influence? Those who have employed it with distinction appear to me to  have played the drama of life to its end, and not to have broken down in  the last act like unpractised players.    But, it will be said, old men are fretful, fidgety, ill-tempered, and  disagreeable. If you come to that, they are also avaricious. But these  are faults of character, not of the time of life. And, after all,  fretfulness and the other faults I mentioned admit of some excuse--not,  indeed, a complete one, but one that may possibly pass muster: they  think themselves neglected, looked down upon, mocked, Besides with  bodily weakness every rub is a source of pain. Yet all these faults are  softened both by good character and good education. Illustrations of  this may be found in real life, as also on the stage in the case of  the brothers in the _Adeiphi_.

That was where the trouble  began.    \"I was light haired, too,\" moaned old Marg, twisting her withered  fingers restlessly. \"Light-haired, and light-complected! A pretty girl,  an' a good girl, too! Not like _her_. No! How could I be? Little the  likes o' her knows what the likes o' me has to face! Lord!\"    The bit of candle guttered and went out. The cold increased. It had  ceased snowing, and a keen wind had arisen, tearing the clouds into  shreds through which the stars gleamed. And presently the moon climbed  up behind the belfry of the old church across the square, and sent one  broad white ray through the dingy window and across the floor. All at  once the great bell began to strike the midnight hour, its mingled  vibrations filling the garret with tumultuous sounds. The vision of the  fair girl faded, and old Marg was herself again, a hard, bitter,  rebellious old woman, with a burning care where her heart had been, and  only one thought, one desire, left in her desperate mind--the thought  and the desire of death.    In young and passionate days she had often thought of seeking that way  out of life's agonies, but at its worst there is always some sweetness  left in the cup--when one is young! It was not so now. The dregs only  had been hers for many a year, and she had enough. Death--yes, that was  best.    Her eyes glittered as she cast a look about the silent room. Bare, even  of the means to this end! Ah, the window!    With an inarticulate cry the woman arose and hobbled along the shining  moon-ray to the window, and threw open the sash. Awed by the stern  beauty of the heavens, the splendor of the moon tangled in the lace-like  carvings of the belfry as in a net, she leaned some moments against the  sill, looking out and down. Far below lay the deserted square, its white  bosom traced with the sharp shadow of the tower. With a keen eye old  Marg measured the distance, a sheer descent of fifty feet. Nothing to  break the fall--nothing!    One movement, a swift fall, and that white surface would be broken by a  black shapeless heap. A policeman would find it on his next round, or  some drunken reveler would stumble over it, or the good people on their  way to early mass--ah! The seamed countenance lit up suddenly with a  malignant joy.    Why not wait until they began to pass--those pious, respectable people  in their comfortable furs and wools--and cast herself into their midst,  a ghastly Christmas offering from Poverty to Riches, from Sin to Virtue?  This suggestion commended itself highly to her sense of humor. With a  hoarse chuckle she was about to close the window when a portion of the  shadow that lay alongside the chimney showed signs of life, and, rising  on four long and skinny legs, became a cat--a lean, black cat, which  crept meekly toward the window, its phosphorescent eyes gleaming, its  lank jaws parted in a vain effort to mew. Startled, old Marg drew back  for an instant; then, glancing from the animal to the pavement below, a  brutal cunning, a malicious pleasure, lit up the witch-like features.  Reaching out one skinny arm, she called coaxingly: \"Puss! Puss!\"    The cat dragged herself up to the outstretched arm, rubbing her lank  body caressingly against it.    The cruel, cunning old face softened suddenly. \"Lord!\" muttered old  Marg, \"if she ain't a-tryin' to _purr_! Wall, that beats me!\"    The poor beast continued its piteous appeal for aid, arching its  starved frame, waving its tail, fawning unsuspectingly against the arm  that had threatened.    With an impulse new to her misery-hardened heart, old Marg drew the  animal in and closed the window. Far from resisting, the cat nestled  against her with every sign of pleasure.    \"She's been somebody's pet,\" said the old woman, placing her on the  floor. \"She ain't always been like this.\"    The divine emotion of pity, so new to this forlorn creature, grew and  swelled in her bosom. The man at the hall had _not_ lied, after all.  Here was another of God's creatures as miserable as herself--nay, more  so, for she had a roof to shelter her! And she could share it with this  homeless one.    \"Poor puss!\" muttered old Marg, stroking the rough fur. \"You're  starvin', too, ain't ye? an' I ain't got nothin' to give ye, not a bite  or a sup. Ah!\"    Her eyes had fallen upon the discarded food. Eagerly she seized it and  placed it before the cat; the starving creature gnawed greedily at the  bone an instant, then looked up with a hopeless mew.    The old woman felt a keener pang of pity.    \"Poor beast!\" she said, with a bitter smile. \"Ye can't eat 'em, can ye?  No more could I! We're in the same box, puss! Old, an' toothless, an'  nobody belongin' to us. We'll have to starve together, I guess. An' it's  Christmas day! Did ye know that, puss? Christmas day! Lord! Lord!\"    The cat rubbed against her skirts, her eyes fixed upon her benefactor's.  \"Seems to understand every word I say!\" old Marg muttered. \"If only I  had a drop o' milk for her now!\"    Hobbling to the stove, she examined the battered tin can, letting the  moonlight shine into its rusty depths. A little water or tea remained in  it, and with this she moistened some of the bread and placed it before  the cat, which devoured it now eagerly. Then she took the animal in her  arms and laid herself down on the mattress, drawing the ragged covers  over them. The cat nestled against her side; the warmth of the two poor  bodies mingled, and both slept.    The moon-ray crept along and spread itself over the heap of rags, the  knotted fingers resting on the cat's rough fur, the seamed old face; it  passed away, and morning dawned, with a peal of bells and the sound of  footsteps on the pavement below, and still the two slept on.      Angela stood near the door, receiving her Christmas guests. They came  straggling in, in twos and threes, some boldly and impudently, some  shame-faced and shy, some eager, some indifferent, but all  poverty-pinched. Each one was pleasantly welcomed, and passed on to the  feast. Angela watched and waited, and at last the door opened slowly to  admit old Marg, who stopped short on the threshold, with a look at once  stubborn, appealing, suspicious, ashamed. Like a wild animal on the  alert for the faintest sign of repulsion or danger, she stood there, but  Angela only smiled, proffering her white, soft hand, destitute of  jewels, but the hand of a lady.    \"A Merry Christmas!\" she said brightly.    \"I was ugly to ye last night,\" said old Marg huskily, ignoring the  beautiful hand she dared not touch.    \"Never mind!\" Angela answered sweetly. \"You were tired.\"    \"I am a bad old woman!\" said old Marg, mistrustfully.    \"Never mind that, either!\" said Angela. \"Let me be your friend. If you  will, you shall never be cold or hungry again.\"    A profound wonder came into the old face--then it began to writhe, and  from each eye oozed scant tears, seeking a channel amid the seams and  wrinkles of the sunken cheeks.    \"You will let me be your friend,\" urged Angela.    Still old Marg wept silently, the scant tears of age.    \"You shall have a pleasant home and----\"    A swift, suspicious glance darted from the wet eyes.    \"Not a 'sylum, miss, please!\" said the old woman.    \"No,\" said Angela quietly. \"Not an asylum, A home--a bright, clean,  comfortable home----\"    \"I can work, miss!\" put in old Marg, doubling her knotted hands to show  their strength. \"I can wash, an' scrub----\"    \"Yes,\" said Angela, \"you may work all you are able, helping to keep  things clean and comfortable.\"    Still old Marg looked doubtful. Wiping her cheeks with a corner of the  shawl, she half turned toward the door.    \"Have you a family, or any one belonging to you?\" asked Angela, thinking  to have reached the root of the difficulty.    \"Yes,\" said the old woman stoutly. \"I have a cat. Where I go, she must  go, too!\"    Angela patted the grimy hand, with a laugh which was good to hear.    \"I understand you perfectly,\" she said. \"I have a cat of my own. You and  _your_ cat shall not be separated.\"      A half-hour later entered the young man Robert. Angela pointed silently  to old Marg, sitting in a warm corner, contentedly munching her  Christmas dinner. \"What have you done to her?\" he asked. \"She looks more  human already.\"    Angela laughed again, that same laugh which goes to one's heart so. \"I  have adopted her--and her cat!\" she answered. \"That's all!\"          THE FIRST PURITAN CHRISTMAS TREE.    (ANONYMOUS.)      Mrs. Olcott called her boys, and bade them go to the pine woods and get  the finest, handsomest young hemlock tree that they could find.    \"Get one that is straight and tall, with well-boughed branches on it,  and put it where you can draw it under the wood-shed after dark,\" she  added.    The boys went to Pine Hill, and there they picked out the finest young  tree on all the hill, and said, \"We will take this one.\" So, with their  hatchets they hewed it down and brought it safely home the next night  when all was dark. And when Roger was quietly sleeping in the adjoining  room, they dragged the tree into the kitchen. It was too tall, so they  took it out again and cut it off two or three feet at the base. Then  they propped it up, and the curtains being down over the windows, and  blankets being fastened over the curtains to prevent any one looking in,  and the door being doubly barred to prevent any one coming in, they all  went to bed.    Very early the next morning, while the stars shone on the snow-covered  hills--the same stars that shone sixteen hundred years before on the  hills when Christ was born in Bethlehem--the little Puritan mother in  New England arose very softly. She went out and lit the kitchen fire  anew from the ash-covered embers. She fastened upon the twigs of the  tree the gifts she had bought in Boston for"]]]
