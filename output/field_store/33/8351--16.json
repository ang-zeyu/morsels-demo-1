It was not without numerous wearying delays that Columbus at length  succeeded in getting another squadron fitted out to prosecute his  discoveries.  He at length obtained six vessels, with which he set sail  on the 30th of May, 1498.  Having heard that a French squadron was  cruising off Cape Saint Vincent, he first stood to the south-west,  touching at the islands of Porto Santo and Madeira, and then continued  his course to the Canary Islands.  As he approached Gomara on the 19th  of June, he saw at anchor a French privateer with two Spanish prizes.  The former put to sea in all haste, followed by her prizes, one of which  had only four men on board, besides six Spanish prisoners.  Though he  sent three of his vessels in pursuit, the privateer and one of the  prizes escaped, but the six Spaniards on board the other, rising on  their captors, she was retaken and brought back to the port.    Leaving Gomara, Columbus dispatched three of his ships to carry supplies  to Hispaniola, and with the three remaining vessels prosecuted his  voyage towards the Cape de Verde Islands.  Though suffering from  sickness, he continued to keep his reckoning and make his observations  with his usual minuteness.    Touching at the Cape de Verdes, he was disappointed at not obtaining the  goats, sheep, and cattle he had expected.  The weather was sultry and  depressing, and he and his crew suffered greatly.  Steering south-west  for about one hundred and twenty leagues, he reached the fifth degree of  north latitude, the region known among seamen by the name of the \"calm  latitudes.\"  Suddenly the wind fell, a dead calm commenced, which lasted  for eight days.  The air was like a furnace, the tar melted, the seams  of the ships yawned, the salt meat became putrid, the wheat was parched,  the hoops round some of the casks of wine and water shrank, while others  burst, letting out their contents.    To get out of this latitude he steered to the south-west, hoping to find  a milder temperature farther on.  In this he was not disappointed.  At  length a cool breeze filled the sails of the vessels, and they again  made good progress.    Columbus intended to have stood first to the south and then westward,  but the heat had made the vessels leak so excessively that it was  necessary to find a harbour as soon as possible.  The provisions were  also spoiled, and the water nearly exhausted.  On the 31st of July but  one cask of water remained in each ship, when about midday a seaman at  the masthead hailed that he saw the summits of three mountains rising  above the horizon.    Columbus had before determined to give the name of the Trinity to the  first land he should behold, and was struck by the appearance of these  three mountains united in one.  He therefore called the island La  Trinidad.  Steering to its eastern extremity, he saw a rock resembling a  galley under sail off a headland, which, in consequence, he called Punta  de la Galera.  No safe anchorage appearing, he coasted westward in  search of a harbour and water.  Instead of a sterile land, he saw the  country covered with groves of palm-trees, cultivated in many places,  and enlivened by hamlets and scattered habitations, while streams came  rushing down the hill-sides.    At length anchoring, abundance of water was obtained from a limpid  brook, and traces of animals were seen, which must have been those of  deer, though supposed to be those of goats.    When coasting the island, he now for the first time saw, stretching away  to the south, that mighty continent of which he had so long been in  search, it being the land near the many mouths of the Oronoco; supposing  it, however, to be an island, he called it La Isla Santa.  On the 2nd of  August he cast anchor near the south-west portion of Trinidad.  As the  ships approached this place, a large canoe, with five and twenty Indians  on board, put off from the shore.    He in vain tried to induce the savages to come on board, by offering  them looking-glasses, glass, beads of polished metal, and glittering  trinkets.  They remained gazing in mute wonder at the ships, but kept  their paddles ready to make off at the least attempt to approach them.  They were young, well formed, and naked, excepting fillets of cotton  bound round their heads, and coloured cloths about their loins.  Besides  their bows and arrows, they carried bucklers,--an article of armour now  first seen among the inhabitants of the New World.    Believing that they might be affected by music, Columbus ordered the  band to strike up; but the Indians, mistaking the sounds as a sign of  hostility, seized their bows and let fly a shower of arrows.  The  discharge of a couple of crossbows, however, put them to flight.  They  afterwards approached the other ships, but had conceived an especial  fear of that of the Admiral.    Columbus, supposing himself to be in the seventh degree of latitude,  though actually in the tenth, expected to find the inhabitants similar  to the natives of Africa, under the same parallel,--black, with crisp  hair,--and was astonished at finding these natives even fairer than  those met with farther north.    The ships brought up at Point Arenal, the nearest to the mainland,  between which and the island Columbus observed, night and day, a current  flowing at a tremendous speed, boiling and raging to such a degree that  he thought it was crossed by a reef of rocks.  From its dangerous  appearance he gave to it the name of Boca del Sierpe--the Serpent's  Mouth.  He feared that the current from the east would prevent his  return, while his ships might be lost on the supposed rocks, should he  attempt a passage.    That night, while kept awake by his illness, he heard a terrible roaring  from the south, and beheld the sea heaped up and covered with foam, like  a huge watery ridge the height of the ships, rolling towards them.  As  this furious surge approached, rendered more terrible in appearance by  the obscurity of night, he trembled for the safety of his vessels.  His  own ship was lifted up to such a height that he feared she would be  overturned, while another was torn from her anchorage.  The crews  expected to be swallowed up, but the surge passed on and gradually  subsided.    Early in the morning he sent the boats to sound the water at the  Serpent's Mouth, and to his great joy several fathoms were found; the  currents and tides setting both ways, either to enter or return.  A  favourable breeze springing up, he entered the tranquil expanse between  Trinidad and the mainland of Paria, and, to his great surprise, he here  found the water fresh.    He continued northward towards a mountain at the north-west point of the  island, and here beheld two lofty capes, one projecting from the island  of Trinidad, the other at the end of the long promontory of Paria,  which, supposing it to be an island, he named Isla de Gracia.  Between  these capes was another channel beset with rocks, among which the  current forced its way with roaring turbulence, to which he gave the  name of Boca del Dragon.    Not wishing to encounter it, he steered along the inner side of the  promontory, round which, fancying that it was an island, he expected to  get, and then to be able to strike northward for Hispaniola.    The country appeared to be cultivated in some places, and in others  covered with fruit-trees and plants, and abounding with monkeys.  He  was, however, greatly astonished at finding the water still fresh, and  that it became more and more so the farther he proceeded.  It was that  season, however, when the rivers which empty themselves into the Gulf of  Paria are swollen by rains.  He was surprised also at the calmness of  the sea, not being aware that the only two entrances were by the  Serpent's and Dragon's Mouths into this large expanse of water.    For some time no inhabitants were met with.  At length the ships brought  up at the mouth of the river, and immediately a canoe with three Indians  came off to the caravel anchored nearest the shore, when the captain,  springing in, upset her, and the people, as they were swimming, were  secured.  Being brought to the Admiral, they were presented with beads,  hawks' bells, and sugar.  The report they gave in consequence, on  returning on shore, induced many other natives to come off.  They were  tall, finely formed, and graceful in their movements, being armed with  bows and arrows and targets.  The men wore cotton cloths of various  colours about their heads and loins, but the women were destitute of  clothing.  They brought maize and other eatables, with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23495"],[0,"The Story of the Greeks (#15)"],[1,"  been quietly pulled aside.    On a beautiful throne of ivory and gold, all overshadowed by a golden  vine bearing clusters of jeweled grapes, sat the Persian king. He was  clad in superbly embroidered robes, wore a diamond crown or tiara, held  a scepter of pure gold, and was surrounded by his officers, who were  almost as richly dressed as he.    As the Athenians were plain people, Hippias had never seen such a sight  before, and stared at the garments, which were far handsomer than those  which the Greek gods were given to wear.    Invited to speak freely and make his errand known, Hippias now told  Darius that he had come to ask his aid against the revolted Athenians.  Darius listened politely to all he had to say, and then sent him away,  graciously promising to think the matter over, and giving orders that  Hippias should be royally entertained in the mean while.    Among Darius' numerous slaves, most of whom were captives of war, there  was a learned Greek doctor called Dem-o-ce'des. This man, hoping soon to  recover his freedom by paying a sum of money, was very careful to hide  his name, and not to tell any one how much he knew.    It happened, however, that the king hurt his foot; and after the Persian  doctors had all vainly tried to cure him, he sent for Democedes, saying  that he would put him to death if he did not speedily help him.    Thus forced to use his knowledge, Democedes did all he could for the  king, and treated the wound so skillfully that the monarch was soon  cured. The king, who had found out from the other captives that the man  was a doctor, now named him court physician, and even had him attend his  wives.    One of these women was A-tos'sa, the favorite queen; and when she became  ill, Democedes was fortunate enough to save her life. The king was so  delighted with this cure, that he bade Democedes choose any reward he  pleased except his freedom.    Democedes, after a few moments' thought, asked permission to visit his  native land once more; and Darius let him go under the escort of fifteen  officers, who had orders not to lose sight of the doctor for a moment,  to bring him back by force if necessary, and to spy out the land.    In spite of the constant watching of these fifteen men, Democedes  managed to escape while they were in Greece, and hid so well that they  were never able to find him. They were therefore obliged to go home  without him; and as soon as they arrived in Persia, they reported to  Darius all they had done on the way.    The Great King questioned them very closely about all they had seen; and  his curiosity was so excited by what they told him, that he made up his  mind to conquer Greece and add it to his kingdom.    He therefore sent for Hippias again, told him that he was ready to help  him, and gave orders to collect one of the largest armies that had ever  been seen. With this army he hoped not only to take the whole country,  but also to get back the runaway doctor, Democedes, who in the mean  while was living peacefully in Greece, where he had married a daughter  of the famous strong man, Milo of Croton.          XLII. DESTRUCTION OF THE PERSIAN HOST.      The Persian preparations for war were hastened by news that all the  Ionian cities had rebelled. These were, as you remember, Greek colonies  founded on the coast of Asia Minor. They had little by little fallen  into the hands of the Persians; but, as they hated to submit to foreign  rule, they had long planned a revolt.    The Athenians, who knew that the Persians were talking of coming over to  conquer them, now offered to help the Ionians, and sent some troops over  to Asia Minor. These joined the rebels, and together they managed to  surprise and burn to the ground the rich city of Sar'dis, which belonged  to Darius.    A messenger was sent in hot haste to bear these tidings to The Great  King; and when he heard them, he was very angry indeed. In his wrath, he  said that he would punish both rebels and Athenians, and immediately  sent his army into Ionia.    The first part of his vow was easily kept, for his troops soon defeated  the Ionian army, and forced the rebels to obey him once more. When  Darius heard this, he was very much pleased; and then, sending for his  bow, he shot an arrow in the direction of Athens, to show that the  punishment of the Athenians would be his next care.    As he was afraid of forgetting these enemies in the pressure of other  business, he gave orders that a slave should appear before him every day  while he sat at dinner, and solemnly say, \"Master, remember the  Athenians!\"    When the preparations for this distant war were ended, the Persian army  set out for Greece. In order to reach that country, it had to march a  long way through the northern part of Asia Minor, cross a narrow strait  called the Hel'les-pont, and pass along the coast of the AEgean Sea,  through Thrace and Scyth'i-a.    In these countries the Persian army met the fierce and warlike  Scyth'i-ans mounted on their fleet-footed horses, and was nearly cut to  pieces. The Persians were so frightened by the attack of these foes,  that they refused to go any farther, and even beat a hasty retreat.    The Persian fleet in the mean while had sailed along bravely. It soon  came to the promontory formed by Mount A'thos, a tall mountain which  sometimes casts a shadow eighty miles long over the sea. Here a terrible  tempest overtook the fleet, and the waves rose so high that six hundred  vessels were dashed to pieces.    All the rest of the Persian vessels were so damaged by the storm, that  it was soon decided that they had better return home. The soldiers of  The Great King were of course greatly discouraged by these misfortunes;  but Darius was more than ever determined to conquer Greece, and at once  began to gather a second army and to build a second fleet.          XLIII. THE ADVANCE OF THE SECOND HOST.      Darius was very busy preparing this other army to march against Greece.  While the men were being drilled, he sent two messengers to the Greek  towns and islands, bidding them surrender and give him earth and water.    By demanding \"earth and water,\" Darius meant that he wanted them to  recognize him as their king, and as master of all their lands and  vessels. The inhabitants of many of the islands and towns were so  frightened by the messages sent by The Great King, that they humbly  yielded; but when the messengers came to Sparta and Athens, they met  with a different reception.    In both cities the people proudly replied that they were their own  masters, and would not yield to the demands of the Persian king. Then,  angered by the insolent command to give earth and water, the Spartans  entirely forgot that the life of an ambassador is sacred. In their rage,  they seized the Persians, flung one into a pit and the other into a  well, and told them to take all the earth and water they wanted.    This conduct made Darius all the more angry, and he hastened his  preparations as much as he could. He was so active that in a short time  he was able to start out again, with an army of a hundred and twenty  thousand men.    The generals of this force were Da'tis and Ar-ta-pher'-nes, who were  guided and advised by the traitor Hippias. The fleet was to land the  army on the plain of Mar'a-thon, close by the sea, and only one day's  journey from Athens.    When the Athenians heard that the Persians were coming, they immediately  decided to ask the Spartans, who were now their allies, to come to their  aid, and help them drive back the enemy. As there was no time to lose,  they chose as their messenger a fleet-footed Athenian, who made the  journey of a hundred and fifty miles in a few hours, running every step  of the way, and only seldom pausing to rest.    The Spartans listened breathlessly to his tidings, and promised that  they would help the Athenians; but they added, that they would not be  able to start until the moon was full, for they thought that they would  be beaten unless they set out at a certain time.    The Persians in the mean while were advancing rapidly, so the Athenians  started out to meet them with no other help than that of their neighbors  the Pla-tae'ans. The whole Greek force numbered only ten thousand men,  and was under the command of the ten Athenian generals who were each  entitled to the leadership for a day in turn.    Among these ten Athenian generals were three remarkable  men,--Mil-ti'a-des, Ar-is-ti'des, and The-mis'to-cles. They consulted  together, hoping to find a plan by which their small army could  successfully oppose the Persian host, which was twelve times greater.    At last Miltiades proposed a plan which might succeed, provided there  was but one chief, and all obeyed him well. Aristides, who was not only  a good man, but also remarkably just and wise, at once saw the  importance of such a plan, and offered to give up his day's command, and  to carry out his friend's orders just as if he were nothing but a common  soldier.    [Illustration: Themistocles.]    The other generals, not wishing to appear less generous than he, also  gave up their command to Miltiades, who thus found himself general in  chief of the Athenian and Plataean armies. So he speedily made his  preparations, and drew up his small force on the plain of Marathon,  between the mountains and the sea.          XLIV. THE BATTLE OF MARATHON.      The Greek army seemed so very small beside the huge host of invaders,  that the Persians felt perfectly sure that it would surrender as soon as  the fight began. Imagine their surprise, therefore, when the Greeks,  instead of waiting for them, gave the signal for battle, and rushed  furiously upon them.    The daring and force of the Greek attack so confused the Persians, that  they began to give way. This encouraged the Greeks still further, and  they fought with such bravery that soon the army of The Great King was  completely routed."]]]
