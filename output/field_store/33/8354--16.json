The leader of the school rolled his white eye and ducked  under. \"My tail tingles, youngster,\" he said. \"That means there's a gale  behind me. Come along! When you're south of the Sticky Water [he meant  the Equator] and your tail tingles, that means there's a gale in front  of you and you must head north. Come along! The water feels bad here.\"    This was one of very many things that Kotick learned, and he was always  learning. Matkah taught him to follow the cod and the halibut along the  under-sea banks and wrench the rockling out of his hole among the weeds;  how to skirt the wrecks lying a hundred fathoms below water and dart  like a rifle bullet in at one porthole and out at another as the fishes  ran; how to dance on the top of the waves when the lightning was racing  all over the sky, and wave his flipper politely to the stumpy-tailed  Albatross and the Man-of-war Hawk as they went down the wind; how to  jump three or four feet clear of the water like a dolphin, flippers  close to the side and tail curved; to leave the flying fish alone  because they are all bony; to take the shoulder-piece out of a cod at  full speed ten fathoms deep, and never to stop and look at a boat or a  ship, but particularly a row-boat. At the end of six months what Kotick  did not know about deep-sea fishing was not worth the knowing. And all  that time he never set flipper on dry ground.    One day, however, as he was lying half asleep in the warm water  somewhere off the Island of Juan Fernandez, he felt faint and lazy all  over, just as human people do when the spring is in their legs, and he  remembered the good firm beaches of Novastoshnah seven thousand miles  away, the games his companions played, the smell of the seaweed, the  seal roar, and the fighting. That very minute he turned north, swimming  steadily, and as he went on he met scores of his mates, all bound for  the same place, and they said: \"Greeting, Kotick! This year we are  all holluschickie, and we can dance the Fire-dance in the breakers off  Lukannon and play on the new grass. But where did you get that coat?\"    Kotick's fur was almost pure white now, and though he felt very proud of  it, he only said, \"Swim quickly! My bones are aching for the land.\" And  so they all came to the beaches where they had been born, and heard the  old seals, their fathers, fighting in the rolling mist.    That night Kotick danced the Fire-dance with the yearling seals. The sea  is full of fire on summer nights all the way down from Novastoshnah to  Lukannon, and each seal leaves a wake like burning oil behind him and a  flaming flash when he jumps, and the waves break in great phosphorescent  streaks and swirls. Then they went inland to the holluschickie grounds  and rolled up and down in the new wild wheat and told stories of what  they had done while they had been at sea. They talked about the Pacific  as boys would talk about a wood that they had been nutting in, and if  anyone had understood them he could have gone away and made such a chart  of that ocean as never was. The three- and four-year-old holluschickie  romped down from Hutchinson's Hill crying: \"Out of the way, youngsters!  The sea is deep and you don't know all that's in it yet. Wait till  you've rounded the Horn. Hi, you yearling, where did you get that white  coat?\"    \"I didn't get it,\" said Kotick. \"It grew.\" And just as he was going to  roll the speaker over, a couple of black-haired men with flat red faces  came from behind a sand dune, and Kotick, who had never seen a man  before, coughed and lowered his head. The holluschickie just bundled off  a few yards and sat staring stupidly. The men were no less than Kerick  Booterin, the chief of the seal-hunters on the island, and Patalamon,  his son. They came from the little village not half a mile from the sea  nurseries, and they were deciding what seals they would drive up to the  killing pens--for the seals were driven just like sheep--to be turned  into seal-skin jackets later on.    \"Ho!\" said Patalamon. \"Look! There's a white seal!\"    Kerick Booterin turned nearly white under his oil and smoke, for he was  an Aleut, and Aleuts are not clean people. Then he began to mutter a  prayer. \"Don't touch him, Patalamon. There has never been a white seal  since--since I was born. Perhaps it is old Zaharrof's ghost. He was lost  last year in the big gale.\"    \"I'm not going near him,\" said Patalamon. \"He's unlucky. Do you really  think he is old Zaharrof come back? I owe him for some gulls' eggs.\"    \"Don't look at him,\" said Kerick. \"Head off that drove of  four-year-olds. The men ought to skin two hundred to-day, but it's the  beginning of the season and they are new to the work. A hundred will do.  Quick!\"    Patalamon rattled a pair of seal's shoulder bones in front of a herd  of holluschickie and they stopped dead, puffing and blowing. Then he  stepped near and the seals began to move, and Kerick headed them inland,  and they never tried to get back to their companions. Hundreds and  hundreds of thousands of seals watched them being driven, but they went  on playing just the same. Kotick was the only one who asked questions,  and none of his companions could tell him anything, except that the  men always drove seals in that way for six weeks or two months of every  year.    \"I am going to follow,\" he said, and his eyes nearly popped out of his  head as he shuffled along in the wake of the herd.    \"The white seal is coming after us,\" cried Patalamon. \"That's the first  time a seal has ever come to the killing-grounds alone.\"    \"Hsh! Don't look behind you,\" said Kerick. \"It is Zaharrof's ghost! I  must speak to the priest about this.\"    The distance to the killing-grounds was only half a mile, but it took an  hour to cover, because if the seals went too fast Kerick knew that they  would get heated and then their fur would come off in patches when they  were skinned. So they went on very slowly, past Sea Lion's Neck, past  Webster House, till they came to the Salt House just beyond the sight  of the seals on the beach. Kotick followed, panting and wondering.  He thought that he was at the world's end, but the roar of the seal  nurseries behind him sounded as loud as the roar of a train in a tunnel.  Then Kerick sat down on the moss and pulled out a heavy pewter watch  and let the drove cool off for thirty minutes, and Kotick could hear the  fog-dew dripping off the brim of his cap. Then ten or twelve men, each  with an iron-bound club three or four feet long, came up, and Kerick  pointed out one or two of the drove that were bitten by their companions  or too hot, and the men kicked those aside with their heavy boots made  of the skin of a walrus's throat, and then Kerick said, \"Let go!\" and  then the men clubbed the seals on the head as fast as they could.    Ten minutes later little Kotick did not recognize his friends any more,  for their skins were ripped off from the nose to the hind flippers,  whipped off and thrown down on the ground in a pile. That was enough  for Kotick. He turned and galloped (a seal can gallop very swiftly for  a short time) back to the sea; his little new mustache bristling with  horror. At Sea Lion's Neck, where the great sea lions sit on the edge  of the surf, he flung himself flipper-overhead into the cool water and  rocked there, gasping miserably. \"What's here?\" said a sea lion gruffly,  for as a rule the sea lions keep themselves to themselves.    \"Scoochnie! Ochen scoochnie!\" (\"I'm lonesome, very lonesome!\") said  Kotick. \"They're killing all the holluschickie on all the beaches!\"    The Sea Lion turned his head inshore. \"Nonsense!\" he said. \"Your  friends are making as much noise as ever. You must have seen old Kerick  polishing off a drove. He's done that for thirty years.\"    \"It's horrible,\" said Kotick, backing water as a wave went over him, and  steadying himself with a screw stroke of his flippers that brought him  all standing within three inches of a jagged edge of rock.    \"Well done for a yearling!\" said the Sea Lion, who could appreciate good  swimming. \"I suppose it is rather awful from your way of looking at it,  but if you seals will come here year after year, of course the men get  to know of it, and unless you can find an island where no men ever come  you will always be driven.\"    \"Isn't there any such island?\" began Kotick.    \"I've followed the poltoos [the halibut] for twenty years, and I can't  say I've found it yet. But look here--you seem to have a fondness for  talking to your betters--suppose you go to Walrus Islet and talk to  Sea Vitch. He may know something. Don't flounce off like that. It's a  six-mile swim, and if I were you I should haul out and take a nap first,  little one.\"    Kotick thought that that was good advice, so he swam round to his own  beach, hauled out, and slept for half an hour, twitching all over, as  seals will. Then he headed straight for Walrus Islet, a little low sheet  of rocky island almost due northeast from Novastoshnah, all ledges and  rock and gulls' nests, where the walrus herded by themselves.    He landed close to old Sea Vitch--the big, ugly, bloated, pimpled,  fat-necked, long-tusked walrus of the North Pacific, who has no manners  except when he is asleep--as he was then, with his hind flippers half in  and half out of the surf.    \"Wake up!\" barked Kotick, for the gulls were making a great noise.    \"Hah! Ho! Hmph! What's that?\" said Sea Vitch, and he struck the next  walrus a blow with his tusks and waked him up, and the next struck the  next, and so on till they were all awake and staring in every direction  but the right one.    \"Hi! It's me,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23609"],[0,"Searchlights on Health: Light on Dark Corners (#15)"],[1,"varied  wardrobe. He does not need a different suit for every season and every  occasion, but if he is careful to select clothes that are simple and not  striking or conspicuous, he may use the garment over and over again without  their being noticed, provided they are suitable to the season and the  occasion.    2. A clean shirt, collar and cuffs always make a young man look neat and  tidy, even if his clothes are not of the latest pattern and are somewhat  threadbare.    3. Propriety is outraged when a man of sixty dresses like a youth of  sixteen. It is bad manners for a gentleman to use perfumes to a noticeable  extent. Avoid affecting singularity in dress. Expensive clothes are no sign  of a gentleman.    [Illustration: The Dude of the 17th Century.]    4. When dressed for company, strive to appear easy and natural. Nothing is  more distressing to a sensitive person, or more ridiculous to one gifted  with refinement, than to see a lady laboring under the consciousness of a  fine gown; or a gentleman who is stiff, awkward and ungainly in a brand-new  coat.    5. Avoid what is called the \"ruffianly style of dress\" or the slouchy  appearance of a half-unbottoned vest, and suspenderless pantaloons. That  sort of affectation is, if possible, even more disgusting than the  painfully elaborate frippery of the dandy or dude. Keep your clothes well  brushed and keep them cleaned. Slight spots can be removed with a little  sponge and soap and water.    6. A gentleman should never wear a high hat unless he has on a frock coat  or a dress suit.    7. A man's jewelry should be good and simple. Brass or false jewelry, like  other forms of falsehood, is vulgar. Wearing many cheap decorations is a  serious fault. {87}    8. If a man wears a ring it should be on the third finger of the left hand.  This is the only piece of jewelry a man is allowed to wear that does not  serve a purpose.    9. Wearing imitations of diamonds is always in very bad taste.    10. Every man looks better in a full beard it he keeps it well trimmed. If  a man shaves he should shave at least every other day, unless he is in the  country.    11. The finger-nails should be kept cut, and the teeth should be cleaned  every morning, and kept clear from tartar. A man who does not keep his  teeth clean does not look like a gentleman when he shows them.           *       *       *       *       *      {88}    Dress.      We sacrifice to dress, till household joys    And comforts cease. Dress drains our cellar dry,    And keeps our larder lean. Puts out our fires,    And introduces hunger, frost and woe,    Where peace and hospitality might reign.--COWPER.           *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration]    1. GOD IS A LOVER OF DRESS.--We cannot but feel that God is a lover of  dress. He has put on robes of beauty and glory upon all his works. Every  flower is dressed in richness; every field blushes beneath a mantle of  beauty; every star is veiled in brightness; every bird is clothed in the  {89} habiliments of the most exquisite taste. The cattle upon the thousand  hills are dressed by the hand divine. Who, studying God in his works, can  doubt, that he will smile upon the evidence of correct taste manifested by  his children in clothing the forms he has made them?    2. LOVE OF DRESS.--To love dress is not to be a slave of fashion; to love  dress only is the test of such homage. To transact the business of charity  in a silken dress, and to go in a carriage to the work, injures neither the  work nor the worker. The slave of fashion is one who assumes the livery of  a princess, and then omits the errand of the good human soul; dresses in  elegance, and goes upon no good errand, and thinks and does nothing of  value to mankind.    3. BEAUTY IN DRESS.--Beauty in dress is a good thing, rail at it who may.  But it is a lower beauty, for which a higher beauty should not be  sacrificed. They love dresses too much who give it their first thought,  their best time, or all their money; who for it neglect the culture of  their mind or heart, or the claims of others on their service; who care  more for their dress than their disposition; who are troubled more by an  unfashionable bonnet than a neglected duty.    4. SIMPLICITY OF DRESS.--Female lovliness never appears to so good  advantage as when set off by simplicity of dress. No artist ever decks his  angels with towering feathers and gaudy jewelry; and our dear human  angels--if they would make good their title to that name--should carefully  avoid ornaments, which properly belong to Indian squaws and African  princesses. These tinselries may serve to give effect on the stage, or upon  the ball room floor, but in daily life there is no substitute for the charm  of simplicity. A vulgar taste is not to be disguised by gold or diamonds.  The absence of a true taste and refinement of delicacy cannot be  compensated for by the possession of the most princely fortune. Mind  measures gold, but gold cannot measure mind. Through dress the mind may be  read, as through the delicate tissue the lettered page. A modest woman will  dress modestly; a really refined and intelligent woman will bear the marks  of careful selection and faultless taste.    5. PEOPLE OF SENSE.--A coat that has the mark of use upon it, is a  recommendation to the people of sense, and a hat with too much nap, and too  high lustre, a derogatory circumstance. The best coats in our streets are  worn on the backs of penniless fops, broken down merchants, clerks with  pitiful salaries, and men that do not pay up. The heaviest gold chains  dangle from the fobs of gamblers and gentlemen of very limited means;  costly ornaments on {90} ladies, indicate to the eyes that are well opened,  the fact of a silly lover or husband cramped for funds.    6. PLAIN AND NEAT.--When a pretty woman goes by in plain and neat apparel,  it is the presumption that she has fair expectations, and a husband that  can show a balance in his favor. For women are like books,--too much  gilding makes men suspicious, that the binding is the most important part.  The body is the shell of the soul, and the dress is the husk of the body;  but the husk generally tells what the kernel is. As a fashionably dressed  young lady passed some gentlemen, one of them raised his hat, whereupon  another, struck by the fine appearance of the lady, made some inquiries  concerning her, and was answered thus: \"She makes a pretty ornament in her  father's house, but otherwise is of no use.\"    7. THE RICHEST DRESS.--The richest dress is always worn on the soul. The  adornments that will not perish, and that all men most admire, shine from  the heart through this life. God has made it our highest, holiest duty, to  dress the soul he has given us. It is wicked to waste it in frivolity. It  is a beautiful, undying, precious thing. If every young woman would think  of her soul when she looks in the glass, would hear the cry of her naked  mind when she dallies away her precious hours at her toilet, would listen  to the sad moaning of her hollow heart, as it wails through her idle,  useless life, something would be done for the elevation of womanhood.    8. DRESSING UP.--Compare a well-dressed body with a well-dressed mind.  Compare a taste for dress with a taste for knowledge, culture, virtue, and  piety. Dress up an ignorant young woman in the \"height of fashion\"; put on  plumes and flowers, diamonds and gewgaws; paint her face, girt up her  waist, and I ask you, if this side of a painted and feathered savage you  can find anything more unpleasant to behold. And yet such young women we  meet by the hundred every day on the street and in all our public places.  It is awful to think of.    9. DRESS AFFECTS OUR MANNERS.--A man who is badly dressed, feels chilly,  sweaty, and prickly. He stammers, and does not always tell the truth. He  means to, perhaps, but he can't. He is half distracted about his  pantaloons, which are much to short, and are constantly hitching up; or his  frayed jacket and crumpled linen harrow his soul, and quite unman him. He  treads on the train of a lady's dress, and says, \"Thank you\", sits down on  his hat, and wishes the \"desert were his dwelling place.\"           *       *       *       *       *      {91}    Beauty.     \"She walks in beauty, like the night      Of cloudless climes and starry skies:    And all that's best of dark and bright      Meet her in aspect and in her eyes;    Thus mellowed to that tender light      Which heaven to gaudy day denies.\"--BYRON.    [Illustration]    1. THE HIGHEST STYLE OF BEAUTY.--The highest style of beauty to be found in  nature pertains to the human form, as animated and lighted up by the  intelligence within. It is the expression of the soul that constitutes this  superior beauty. It is that which looks out of the eye, which sits in calm  majesty on the brow, lurks on the lip, smiles on the cheek, is set forth in  the chiselled lines and features of the countenance, in the general contour  of figure and form, in the movement, and gesture, and tone; it is this  looking out of the invisible spirit that dwells within, this manifestation  of the higher nature, that we admire and love; this constitutes to us the  beauty of our species. {92}    2. BEAUTY WHICH PERISHES NOT.--There is a beauty which perishes not. It is  such as the angels wear. It forms the washed white robes of the saints. It  wreathes the countenance of every doer of good. It adorns every honest  face. It shines in the virtuous life. It molds the hands of charity. It  sweetens the voice of sympathy. It sparkles on the brow of wisdom. It  flashes in the eye of love. It breathes in the spirit of piety. It is the  beauty of the heaven of heavens. It is that which may grow by the hand of  culture in every human soul. It is the flower of the spirit which blossoms  on the tree of life. Every soul may plant and nurture it in its own garden,  in its own Eden.    3. WE MAY"]]]
