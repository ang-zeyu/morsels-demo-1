She  gave me the same reply, and I read in her face the fact, that had  there been a vacancy, I should not have been chosen to fill it.    As a last resort, I applied to the managers of the Crimean Fund to  know whether they would give me a passage to the camp--once there I  would trust to something turning up. But this failed also, and one  cold evening I stood in the twilight, which was fast deepening into  wintry night, and looked back upon the ruins of my last castle in the  air. The disappointment seemed a cruel one. I was so conscious of the  unselfishness of the motives which induced me to leave England--so  certain of the service I could render among the sick soldiery, and yet  I found it so difficult to convince others of these facts. Doubts and  suspicions arose in my heart for the first and last time, thank  Heaven. Was it possible that American prejudices against colour had  some root here? Did these ladies shrink from accepting my aid because  my blood flowed beneath a somewhat duskier skin than theirs? Tears  streamed down my foolish cheeks, as I stood in the fast thinning  streets; tears of grief that any should doubt my motives--that Heaven  should deny me the opportunity that I sought. Then I stood still, and  looking upward through and through the dark clouds that shadowed  London, prayed aloud for help. I dare say that I was a strange sight  to the few passers-by, who hastened homeward through the gloom and  mist of that wintry night. I dare say those who read these pages will  wonder at me as much as they who saw me did; but you must all remember  that I am one of an impulsive people, and find it hard to put that  restraint upon my feelings which to you is so easy and natural.    The morrow, however, brought fresh hope. A good night's rest had  served to strengthen my determination. Let what might happen, to the  Crimea I would go. If in no other way, then would I upon my own  responsibility and at my own cost. There were those there who had  known me in Jamaica, who had been under my care; doctors who would  vouch for my skill and willingness to aid them, and a general who had  more than once helped me, and would do so still. Why not trust to  their welcome and kindness, and start at once? If the authorities had  allowed me, I would willingly have given them my services as a nurse;  but as they declined them, should I not open an hotel for invalids in  the Crimea in my own way? I had no more idea of what the Crimea was  than the home authorities themselves perhaps, but having once made up  my mind, it was not long before cards were printed and speeding across  the Mediterranean to my friends before Sebastopol. Here is one of  them:--            \"BRITISH HOTEL.          Mrs. Mary Seacole          (_Late of Kingston, Jamaica_),          Respectfully announces to her former kind friends,        and to the Officers of the Army and Navy generally,        That she has taken her passage in the screw-steamer      \"Hollander,\" to start from London on the 25th of      January, intending on her arrival at Balaclava to      establish a mess table and comfortable quarters for sick      and convalescent officers.\"    This bold programme would reach the Crimea in the end of January, at a  time when any officer would have considered a stall in an English  stable luxurious quarters compared to those he possessed, and had  nearly forgotten the comforts of a mess-table. It must have read to  them rather like a mockery, and yet, as the reader will see, I  succeeded in redeeming my pledge.    While this new scheme was maturing, I again met Mr. Day in England. He  was bound to Balaclava upon some shipping business, and we came to the  understanding that (if it were found desirable) we should together  open a store as well as an hotel in the neighbourhood of the camp. So  was originated the well-known firm of Seacole and Day (I am sorry to  say, the camp wits dubbed it Day and Martin), which, for so many  months, did business upon the now deserted high-road from the then  busy harbour of Balaclava to the front of the British army before  Sebastopol.    These new arrangements were not allowed to interfere in any way with  the main object of my journey. A great portion of my limited capital  was, with the kind aid of a medical friend, invested in medicines  which I had reason to believe would be useful; with the remainder I  purchased those home comforts which I thought would be most difficult  to obtain away from England.    I had scarcely set my foot on board the \"Hollander,\" before I met a  friend. The supercargo was the brother of the Mr. S----, whose death  in Jamaica the reader will not have forgotten, and he gave me a hearty  welcome. I thought the meeting augured well, and when I told him my  plans he gave me the most cheering encouragement. I was glad, indeed,  of any support, for, beyond all doubt, my project was a hazardous one.    So cheered at the outset, I watched without a pang the shores of  England sink behind the smooth sea, and turned my gaze hopefully to  the as yet landless horizon, beyond which lay that little peninsula to  which the eyes and hearts of all England were so earnestly directed.    So, cheerily! the good ship ploughed its way eastward ho! for Turkey.          CHAPTER IX.        VOYAGE TO CONSTANTINOPLE--MALTA--GIBRALTAR--CONSTANTINOPLE,      AND WHAT I THOUGHT OF IT--VISIT TO SCUTARI HOSPITAL--MISS      NIGHTINGALE.      I am not going to risk the danger of wearying the reader with a long  account of the voyage to Constantinople, already worn threadbare by  book-making tourists. It was a very interesting one, and, as I am a  good sailor, I had not even the temporary horrors of sea-sickness to  mar it. The weather, although cold, was fine, and the sea  good-humouredly calm, and I enjoyed the voyage amazingly. And as day  by day we drew nearer to the scene of action, my doubts of success  grew less and less, until I had a conviction of the rightness of the  step I had taken, which would have carried me buoyantly through any  difficulties.    On the way, of course, I was called up from my berth at an  unreasonable hour to gaze upon the Cape of St. Vincent, and expected  to feel duly impressed when the long bay where Trafalgar's fight was  won came in view, with the white convent walls on the cliffs above  bathed in the early sunlight. I never failed to take an almost  childish interest in the signals which passed between the \"Hollander\"  and the fleet of vessels whose sails whitened the track to and from  the Crimea, trying to puzzle out the language these children of the  ocean spoke in their hurried course, and wondering whether any, or  what sufficiently important thing _could_ happen which would warrant  their stopping on their busy way.    We spent a short time at Gibraltar, and you may imagine that I was  soon on shore making the best use of the few hours' reprieve granted  to the \"Hollander's\" weary engines. I had an idea that I should do  better alone, so I declined all offers of companionship, and selecting  a brisk young fellow from the mob of cicerones who offered their  services, saw more of the art of fortification in an hour or so than I  could understand in as many years. The pleasure was rather fatiguing,  and I was not sorry to return to the market-place, where I stood  curiously watching its strange and motley population. While so  engaged, I heard for the first time an exclamation which became  familiar enough to me afterwards.    \"Why, bless my soul, old fellow, if this is not our good old Mother  Seacole!\" I turned round, and saw two officers, whose features, set in  a broad frame of Crimean beard, I had some difficulty in recognising.  But I soon remembered that they were two of the 48th, who had been  often in my house at Kingston. Glad were the kind-hearted fellows, and  not a little surprised withal, to meet their old hostess in the  market-place of Gibraltar, bound for the scene of action which they  had left invalided; and it was not long before we were talking old  times over some wine--Spanish, I suppose--but it was very nasty.    \"And you are going to the front, old lady--you, of all people in the  world?\"    \"Why not, my sons?--won't they be glad to have me there?\"    \"By Jove! yes, mother,\" answered one, an Irishman. \"It isn't many  women--God bless them!--we've had to spoil us out there. But it's not  the place even for you, who know what hardship is. You'll never get a  roof to cover you at Balaclava, nor on the road either.\" So they  rattled on, telling me of the difficulties that were in store for me.  But they could not shake my resolution.    \"Do you think I shall be of any use to you when I get there?\"    \"Surely.\"    \"Then I'll go, were the place a hundred times worse than you describe  it. Can't I rig up a hut with the packing-cases, and sleep, if need  be, on straw, like Margery Daw?\"    So they laughed, and drank success to me, and to our next meeting;  for, although they were going home invalided, the brave fellows'  hearts were with their companions, for all the hardships they had  passed through.    We stopped at Malta also, where, of course, I landed, and stared about  me, and submitted to be robbed by the lazy Maltese with all a  traveller's resignation. Here, also, I met friends--some medical  officers who had known me in Kingston; and one of them, Dr. F----,  lately arrived from Scutari, gave me, when he heard my plans, a letter  of introduction to Miss Nightingale, then hard at work, evoking order  out of confusion, and bravely resisting the despotism of death, at the  hospital of Scutari.    So on, past beautiful islands and shores, until we are steaming  against a swift current, and an adverse wind, between two  tower-crested promontories of rock, which they tell me stand in Europe  and in Asia, and are connected with some pretty tale of love in days  long gone by. Ah! travel"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23033"],[0,"Classic French Course in English (#15)"],[1,"La Fontaine's productions. With something, too, of  the air of real poetry, he has undoubtedly invested his verse.    We give, first, the brief fable which is said to have been the prime  favorite of the author himself. It is the fable of \"The Oak and the  Reed.\" Of this fable, French critics have not scrupled to speak in terms  of almost the very highest praise. Chamfort says, \"Let one consider,  that, within the limit of thirty lines, La Fontaine, doing nothing but  yield himself to the current of his story, has taken on every tone,  that of poetry the most graceful, that of poetry the most lofty, and one  will not hesitate to affirm, that, at the epoch at which this fable  appeared, there was nothing comparable to it in the French language.\"  There are, to speak precisely, thirty-two lines in the fable. In this  one case, let us try representing La Fontaine's compression by our  English form. For the rest of our specimens, we shall use Elizur  Wright's translation,--a meritorious one, still master of the field  which, near fifty years ago, it entered as pioneer. Mr. Wright here  expands La Fontaine's thirty-two verses to forty-four. The additions are  not ungraceful, but they encumber somewhat the Attic neatness and  simplicity of the original. We ought to say, that La Fontaine boldly  broke with the tradition which had been making Alexandrines--lines of  six feet--obligatory in French verse. He rhymes irregularly, at choice,  and makes his verses long or short, as pleases him. The closing verse of  the present piece is, in accordance with the intended majesty of the  representation, an Alexandrine.              The Oak one day said to the Reed,        \"Justly might you dame Nature blame:        A wren's weight would bow down your frame;            The lightest wind that chance may make            Dimple the surface of the lake            Your head bends low indeed,        The while, like Caucasus, my front        To meet the branding sun is wont,        Nay, more, to take the tempest's brunt.              A blast you feel, I feel a breeze.        Had you been born beneath my roof,        Wide-spread, of leafage weather-proof,            Less had you known your life to tease;            I should have sheltered you from storm.            But oftenest you rear your form        On the moist limits of the realm of wind.        Nature, methinks, against you sore has sinned.\"            \"Your pity,\" answers him the Heed,        \"Bespeaks you kind; but spare your pain;        I more than you may winds disdain.            I bend, and break not. You, indeed,        Against their dreadful strokes till now        Have stood, nor tamed your back to bow:        But wait we for the end.\"                                  Scarce had he spoke,        When fiercely from the far horizon broke        The wildest of the children, fullest fraught        With terror, that till then the North had brought.            The tree holds good; the reed it bends.            The wind redoubled might expends,        And so well works that from his bed        Him it uproots who nigh to heaven his head        Held, and whose feet reached to the kingdom of the dead.    In the fable of the \"Rat retired from the World,\" La Fontaine rallies  the monks. \"With French _finesse_, he hits his mark by expressly  avoiding it. \"What think you I mean by my disobliging rat? A monk? No,  but a Mahometan devotee; I take it for granted that a monk is always  ready with his help to the needy!\"          The sage Levantines have a tale            About a rat that weary grew        Of all the cares which life assail,            And to a Holland cheese withdrew.        His solitude was there profound,        Extending through his world so round.        Our hermit lived on that within;        And soon his industry had been        With claws and teeth so good,            That in his novel heritage,            He had in store for wants of age,        Both house and livelihood.        What more could any rat desire?            He grew fat, fair, and round.            God's blessings thus redound        To those who in his vows retire.        One day this personage devout,        Whose kindness none might doubt,        Was asked, by certain delegates        That came from Rat United States,        For some small aid, for they        To foreign parts were on their way,        For succor in the great cat-war:        Ratopolis beleaguered sore,            Their whole republic drained and poor,        No morsel in their scrips they bore.            Slight boon they craved, of succor sure        In days at utmost three or four.        \"My friends,\" the hermit said,        \"To worldly things I'm dead.        How can a poor recluse        To such a mission be of use?        What can he do but pray        That God will aid it on its way?        And so, my friends, it is my prayer        That God will have you in his care.\"        His well-fed saintship said no more,        But in their faces shut the door.            What think you, reader, is the service,        For which I use this niggard rat?            To paint a monk? No, but a dervise.        A monk, I think, however fat,        Must be more bountiful than that.    The fable entitled \"Death and the Dying\" is much admired for its union  of pathos with wit. \"The Two Doves\" is another of La Fontaine's more  tender inspirations. \"The Mogul's Dream\" is a somewhat ambitious flight  of the fabulist's muse. On the whole, however, the masterpiece among the  fables of La Fontaine is that of \"The Animals Sick of the Plague.\" Such  at least is the opinion of critics in general. The idea of this fable is  not original with La Fontaine. The homilists of the middle ages used a  similar fiction to enforce on priests the duty of impartiality in  administering the sacrament, so called, of confession. We give this  famous fable as our closing specimen of La Fontaine:--                    The sorest ill that Heaven hath              Sent oil this lower world in wrath,--              The plague (to call it by its name),                      One single day of which                  Would Pluto's ferryman enrich,              Waged war on beasts, both wild and tame.              They died not all, but all were sick:              No hunting now, by force or trick,              To save what might so soon expire.              No food excited their desire:              Nor wolf nor fox now watched to slay              The innocent and tender prey.                              The turtles fled,              So love and therefore joy were dead.              The lion council held, and said,              \"My friends, I do believe              This awful scourge for which we grieve,              Is for our sins a punishment              Most righteously by Heaven sent.              Let us our guiltiest beast resign,              A sacrifice to wrath divine.              Perhaps this offering, truly small,              May gain the life and health of all.              By history we find it noted              That lives have been just so devoted.              Then let us all turn eyes within,              And ferret out the hidden sin.              Himself, let no one spare nor flatter,              But make clean conscience in the matter.              For me, my appetite has played the glutton              Too much and often upon mutton.              What harm had e'er my victims done?                              I answer, truly, None.              Perhaps, sometimes, by hunger pressed,                    I've eat the shepherd with the rest.                    I yield myself if need there be;                    And yet I think, in equity,              Each should confess his sins with me;              For laws of right and justice cry,              The guiltiest alone should die.\"              \"Sire,\" said the fox, \"your majesty              Is humbler than a king should be,              And over-squeamish in the case.                    What! eating stupid sheep a crime?                    No, never, sire, at any time.                It rather was an act of grace,              A mark of honor to their race.              And as to shepherds, one may swear,                      The fate your majesty describes,              Is recompense less full than fair                      For such usurpers o'er our tribes.\"                        Thus Renard glibly spoke,              And loud applause from listeners broke.              Of neither tiger, boar, nor bear,              Did any keen inquirer dare              To ask for crimes of high degree;                      The fighters, biters, scratchers, all              From every mortal sin were free;                      The very dogs, both great and small,                      Were saints, as far as dogs could be.                        The ass, confessing in his turn,              Thus spoke in tones of deep concern:              \"I happened through a mead to pass;              The monks, its owners, were at mass:              Keen hunger, leisure, tender grass,                      And, add to these the devil, too,                      All tempted me the deed to do.              I browsed the bigness of my tongue:              Since truth must out, I own it wrong.\"              On this, a hue and cry arose,              As if the beasts were all his foes.              A wolf, haranguing lawyer-wise,              Denounced the ass for sacrifice,--              The bald-pate, scabby, ragged lout,              By whom the plague had come, no doubt.              His fault was judged a hanging crime.                      What! eat another's grass? Oh, shame!              The noose of rope, and death sublime,                      For that offence were all too tame!                      And soon poor Grizzle felt the same.                Thus human courts acquit the strong,              And doom the weak, "]]]
