Manhood.    BY ROBERT BURNS.    Tune, \"Our Warrior's Hearts,\" page 128.      Is there, for honest poverty,    That hangs his head, and a' that;  The coward-slave, we pass him by,    We dare be poor, for a' that;  For a' that and a' that;    Our toils obscure, and a' that,  The rank is but the guinea's stamp,    The man's the gowd, for a' that.    What though on homely fare we dine,    Wear hodden gray and a' that,  Gie fools their silks, and knaves their wine,    A man's a man for a' that;  The honest man tho' e'er so poor,    Is king o' men for a' that;  The rank is but the guinea's stamp,    The man's the gowd for a' that.    Then let us pray that come it may,    As come it will, for a' that,  That sense and worth, o'er a' the earth,    May bear the gree, and a' that;  For a' that, and a' that,    It's coming yet, for a' that,  That man to man, the world all o'er    Shall brothers be, for a' that.         Terms explained:--       _Gowd_--gold.       _Hodden_--homespun, or mean.       _Gree_--honor, or victory.          The Poor Voter's Song.    Air, \"Lucy Long.\"      They knew that I was poor,    And they thought that I was base;  They thought that I'd endure    To be covered with disgrace;  They thought me of their tribe,    Who on filthy lucre doat,  So they offered me a bribe    For my vote, boys! my vote!      O shame upon my betters,        Who would my conscience buy!      But I'll not wear their fetters,        Not I, indeed, not I!    My vote? It is not mine    To do with as I will;  To cast, like pearls, to swine,    To these wallowers in ill.  It is my country's due,    And I'll give it, while I can,  To the honest and the true,    Like a man, like a man!      O shame, &c.    No, no, I'll hold my vote,    As a treasure and a trust,  My dishonor none shall quote,    When I'm mingled with the dust;  And my children when I'm gone,    Shall be strengthened by the thought,  That their father was not one    To be bought, to be bought!      O shame, &c.          The Flying Slave.    FROM THE BANGOR GAZETTE.    AIR:--\"_To Greece we give our shining blades_.\"      The night is dark, and keen the air,  And the Slave is flying to be free;  His parting word is one short prayer:  Oh God, but give me Liberty!      Farewell--farewell:  Behind I leave the whips and chains,  Before me spreads sweet Freedom's plains.    One star shines in the heavens above  That guides him on his lonely way;--  Star of the North--how deep his love  For thee, thou star of Liberty!      Farewell--farewell:  Behind he leaves the whips and chains,  Before him spreads sweet Freedom's plains.          For the Election.    TUNE:--'_Scots wha hae with Wallace bled_.'      Ye who know and do the right,  Ye who cherish honor bright,  Ye who worship love and light,      Choose your side to-day.  Succor Freedom, now you can,  Voting for an honest man;  Or you may from Slavery's span,      Pick a Polk or Clay.    Boasts your vote no higher aim,  Than between two blots of shame  That would stain our country's fame,      Just to choose the least?  Let it sternly answer no!  Let it straight for Freedom go;  Let it swell the winds that blow      From the north and east.    Blot!--the smaller--is a curse  Blighting conscience, honor, purse;  Give us any, give the worse,      'Twill be less endured.  Freemen, is it God who wills  You to choose, of foulest ills,  That which only latest kills?      No; he wills it cured.    Do your duty, He will aid;  Dare to vote as you have prayed;  Who e'er conquered, while his blade      Served his open foes.  Right established, would you see?  Feel that you yourselves are free;  Strike for that which ought to be--      God will bless the blows.          Hail the Day!    AIR:--\"_Wreathe the bowl_.\"          Hail the day      Whose joyful ray  Speaks of emancipation!      The day that broke      Oppression's yoke--  The birth-day of a nation!        When England's might      Put forth for right,  Achieved a fame more glorious      Than armies tried,      Or navies' pride,  O'er land and sea victorious!        Soon may we gain      An equal name  In honor's estimation!      And righteousness      Exalt and bless  Our glorious happy nation!        Brave hearts shall lend      Strong hands to rend  Foul slavery's bonds asunder,      And liberty      Her jubilee  Proclaim, in tones of thunder!        We hail afar      Fair freedom's star,  Her day-star brightly glancing;      We hear the tramp      From freedom's camp,  Assembling and advancing!        No noisy drum      Nor murderous gun,  No deadly fiends contending;      But love and right      Their force unite,  In peaceful conflict blending.        Fair freedom's host,      In joyful boast,  Unfolds her banner ample!      With Channing's fame,      And Whittier's name,  And BIRNEY'S bright example!        Come join your hands      With freedom's bands,  New England's sons and daughters!      Speak your decree--      Man shall be free--  As mountains, winds and waters!        And haste the day      Whose coming ray  Speaks our emancipation!      Whose glorious light,      Enthroning right,  Shall bless and save the nation!          (From the Globe.)    The Ballot.    BY J.E. DOW.    Air, \"Bonnie Doon,\" page 54.      Dread sovereign, thou! the chainless WILL--    Thy source the nation's mighty heart--  The ballot box thy cradle still--    Thou speak'st, and nineteen millions start;  Thy subjects, sons of noble sires;    Descendants of a patriot band--  Thy lights a million's household fires--    Thy daily walk, my native land.    And shall the safeguard of the free,    By valor won on gory plains,  Become a solemn mockery    While freemen breathe and virtue reigns?  Shall liberty be bought and sold    By guilty creatures clothed with power?  Is HONOR but a name for GOLD,    And PRINCIPLE A WITHERED FLOWER?    The parricide's accursed steel    Has pierced thy sacred sovereignty;  And all who think, and all who feel,    Must act or never more be free.  No party chains shall bind us here;    No mighty name shall turn the blow:  Then, wounded sovereignty, appear,    And lay the base apostates low.    The wretch, with hands by murder red,    May hope for mercy at the last;  And he who steals a nation's bread,    May have oblivion's statute passed.  But he who steals a sacred right,    And brings his native land to scorn,  Shall die a traitor in her sight,    With none to pity or to mourn.          The Spirit of the Pilgrims.    Tune, \"Be free, Oh man, be free,\" page 134.      The spirit of the Pilgrims    Is spreading o'er the earth,  And millions now point to the land    Where Freedom had her birth:  Hark! Hear ye not the earnest cry    That peals o'er every wave?      \"God above,      In thy love,    O liberate the slave!\"    Ye heard of trampled Poland,    And of her sons in chains,  And noble thoughts flashed through your minds    And fire flowed through your veins.  Then wherefore hear ye not the cry    That breaks o'er land and sea?--      \"On each plain,      Rend the chain,    And set the captive free!\"    Oh, think ye that our fathers,    (That noble patriot band,)  Could now look down with kindling joy,    And smile upon the land?  Or would a trumpet-tone go forth,    And ring from shore to shore;--      \"All who stand,      In this land,    Shall be free for evermore!\"    Great God, inspire thy children,    And make thy creatures just,  That every galling chain may fall,    And crumble into dust:  That not one soul throughout the land    Our fathers died to save,      May again,      By fellow-men,    Be branded as a Slave!          What Mean Ye?    TUNE--'_Ortonville_.'      What mean ye that ye bruise and bind    My people, saith the Lord,  And starve your craving brother's mind,    Who asks to hear my word?    What mean ye that ye make them toil;    Through long and dreary years,  And shed like rain upon your soil    Their blood and bitter tears?    What mean ye, that ye dare to rend    The tender mother's heart?  Brothers from sisters, friend from friend,    How dare you bid them part?    What mean ye when God's bounteous hand,    To you so much has given,  That from the slave who tills your land,    Ye keep both earth and heaven?    When at the judgment God shall call,    Where is thy brother? say,  What mean ye to the Judge of all    To answer on that day?          Hymn for Children.    AIR:--\"_Miss Lucy Long_.\"    BY W.S. ABBOTT.      While we are happy here,    In joy and peace and love,  We'll raise our hearts, with holy fear,    To thee, great God, above.    God of our infant hours!    The music of our tongues,  The worship of our nobler powers,    To thee, to thee belongs.    The little, trembling slave    Shall feel our sympathy;  O God! arise with might to save,    And set the captive free.    No parent's holy care    Provides for him repose,  But oft the hot and briny tear,    In sorrow freely flows.    The God of Abraham praise;    The curse he will remove;  The slave shall welcome happy days,    With liberty and love.    Pray without ceasing, pray,    Ye saints of God Most High,  That all who hail this glorious day,    May have their liberty.          Liberty Glee.    TUNE:--\"_The Pirate's Glee_.\"      March on! march on! we love the Liberty flag,    That's waving o'er our land;  As fearless as the eagle soaring    O'er the cloud-capped mountain crag,  Slavery in terror flies before us;    We fling our banner to the blast;  It there shall float triumphant o'er us,    We will defend it to the last.      March on! march on, &c.    Vote on! vote on, we hail the Liberty flag,    That leads us on our way;  We'll boldly vote, our country saving,    "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22096"],[0,"Stories the Iroquois Tell Their Children (#15)"],[1,"a little Indian girl was very sad and unhappy. The Great Spirit had  taken her father and mother, and she had gone to live with relatives who  did not want her. Often she went to sleep hungry, for only the scraps of  food that were left from a meal were given to her.    One day, the relatives of the little girl brought in a fine deer from  the chase, and made ready for a feast. They told the girl to get out of  the lodge, for there was neither room, nor meat for her.    The little girl ran and hid herself in a great field of corn. There she  cried aloud.    Soon a band of strange Little People gathered about her, to comfort her.  On all sides, from the folds of the green cornstalks they came.    They stroked her head, wiped the tears from her eyes, and said, \"Don't  cry, little girl. We will take care of you. You shall come and live with  us. We will make a feast for you. We know why you are sad, for we can  read the thoughts of all the earth children. Come with us, and we will  show you more wonderful things than you have ever seen.\"    At this the little girl dried her tears, and smiled at the kind Little  People.    \"You are very good to me,\" she said. \"Who are you?\"    \"We are the _Jo gah oh_,\" they replied, \"the Little People. Come, and we  will show you what we can do.\"    Then they slipped some winged moccasins upon her feet. They wrapped her  in an invisible blanket and put a magic corn plume in her hair, and the  next moment all were flying through the air.    They flew to a ledge of great rocks. At the touch of the Little People,  the rocks opened, and they passed within.    The girl found herself in a beautiful lodge. Kind _Jo gah oh_ mothers  were baking cakes and roasting meat. They welcomed the girl, and soon a  feast was spread in her honor.    Now the heart of the little girl was so light that she danced with joy.    \"What wonderful people you are! Can you go anywhere, or do anything you  wish?\"    \"Yes,\" said the little chief, \"the _Jo gah oh_ are small, but they are  great. Come with us, and you shall see what we can do.\"    Again they were flying through the air. Soon they reached the lodge  where the little girl had lived. It was night, and her relatives were  asleep, but she could see the deer that hung outside ready for the  feast.    \"Now,\" said the _Jo gah oh_ chief, \"we will call out a pack of wolves  from the wood yonder, and there will be no fat deer for this selfish  feast, at sunrise.\"    Now no wolves had been seen in that wood for many moons. But at the call  of the fairies, a pack sprang from it, ran to the lodge, seized the  deer, and tore it into shreds. Then they again disappeared in the wood.    The little girl's eyes were large now with wonder, as they flew back to  the fairy lodge in the rocks, but she was not afraid of these strange  Little People. She was so happy with them she wished she might always  live in a _Jo gah oh_ lodge.    One morning, the little chief said, \"Today we shall see more wonders.\"    This time a tiny canoe was waiting. They stepped into it and sailed  down a river until they came to a great tree.    \"In that tree,\" said the little chief, \"lives a great, black bear. Every  day he comes out that door you see high up in the bear tree. I will make  the door fast so he cannot open it. A deep sleep will fall on him. He  will sleep for many moons.\"    Then the chief threw three stones through the open door of the bear  tree. Each time, a flame spread like a blanket over the door. A growling  and scratching was heard within. Then all became still.    \"Now,\" said the chief, \"the bear will sleep until I call him in the  spring. He is locked up for the winter. Come, let us go on.\"    The little girl drew her invisible blanket closer, as the canoe went  sailing with the birds through the clouds. The birds that were swift of  wing called loudly for a race.    \"Come on!\" said the fairy chief.    Then he spread wide the invisible sails of his canoe, and they flew past  the birds like a streak of lightning. Even the eagle was left far  behind. They seemed to shoot through the sky.    And, oh, what fun it was to be a bird! The little girl would have sailed  on forever, but the little chief said, \"You shall now return to your  people. We have given them soft hearts and kind minds. They are calling  for you. They will be glad to see you.\"    And soon the little girl was again in the wigwam of her relatives,  sitting by the warm fire.    They greeted her with joy, spread a soft skin for her to sit upon, and  gave her the best food. And the little girl lived with them, ever after,  and was happy."]]]
