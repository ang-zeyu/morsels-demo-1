Then Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God; and  they stood at the foot of the mountain. Mount Sinai was entirely covered  with smoke, because Jehovah came down upon it in fire. And from it smoke  went up like the smoke of a furnace, and the entire mountain shook  violently.    Then God spoke all these words: \"I am Jehovah your God who brought you  out of the land of Egypt, from a place where you were slaves.    \"THOU SHALT HAVE NO OTHER GODS EXCEPT ME.    \"THOU SHALT NOT MAKE FOR THYSELF A GRAVEN IMAGE, nor any image of  anything that is in the heavens above, on the earth beneath, or in the  waters that are under the earth. Thou shalt not bow down before them,  nor serve them, for I Jehovah thy God am a jealous God visiting the sins  of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation, but  showing acts of kindness to the thousandth generation of those who love  me and keep my commands.    \"THOU SHALT NOT TAKE THE NAME OF JEHOVAH THY GOD IN VAIN, for Jehovah  will not leave him unpunished who takes his name in vain.    \"REMEMBER THE SABBATH DAY TO KEEP IT HOLY. Six days shalt thou labor and  do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of Jehovah thy God.  In it thou shalt not do any work, neither thou, nor thy son, nor thy  daughter, nor thy male servant, nor thy female servant, nor thy cattle,  nor the guest who is with thee, for in six days Jehovah made the heavens  and the earth, the sea and all that in them is, and rested on the  seventh day. Therefore Jehovah blessed the Sabbath day and made it  holy.    \"HONOR THY FATHER AND THY MOTHER, that thou mayest live long on the land  which Jehovah thy God giveth thee.    \"THOU SHALT NOT MURDER.    \"THOU SHALT NOT COMMIT ADULTERY.    \"THOU SHALT NOT STEAL.    \"THOU SHALT NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS AGAINST THY NEIGHBOR.    \"THOU SHALT NOT COVET THY NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE; thou shalt not covet thy  neighbor's wife, nor his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his  ox, nor his ass, nor anything that belongs to thy neighbor.\"    Then Jehovah said to Moses, \"Write down these words, for in accord with  these words I have made a solemn agreement with you and with Israel.\"      OUR DUTIES TO GOD AND MAN    Hear O Israel: Jehovah our God is the one Lord. You shall love Jehovah  your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your  strength.    Behold, the heavens, the highest heavens, the earth and all that is on  it belong to Jehovah your God. Jehovah showed his love to your fathers  more than to any other people, and he has chosen their children after  them and you out of all the nations. Therefore, open your heart to him  and no longer refuse to be guided by him. For Jehovah your God is God of  gods and Lord of lords, the great, the mighty, the wonderful God, who  shows no favors and takes no bribes, who sees that what is right is done  to the orphan and widow, who loves the foreigner and gives him food and  clothing. Love Jehovah your God and always keep his laws and his  commands.    You shall not deceive one another.    You shall not lie to one another.    You shall not swear falsely in my name.    You shall not wrong nor rob your neighbor.    You shall not curse the deaf.    You shall not put a stumbling-block before the blind.    You shall not tell stories about one another.    You shall not hate any one.    You shall not take vengeance nor bear a grudge against any one.    You shall love your neighbor as yourself.    You shall rise before the hoary head and honor an old man.    If a foreigner lives in your land, you shall do him no wrong. You shall  treat him as one of your own people and you shall love him as yourself.      THE REPORT OF THE HEBREW SPIES    Moses sent certain men to explore the land of Canaan and said to them,  \"Go up into the South Country and on into the highlands, and see what  the land is and whether the people who live there are strong or weak,  whether they are few or many, and whether the land in which they live is  good or bad, and what kinds of cities they live in, whether in camps or  in strongholds. See whether the land is fertile or barren, whether there  is wood in it or not. Be courageous and bring some of the fruit of the  land,\" for it was the time when the grapes first begin to ripen.    So they went up to the South Country and came to Hebron. When they came  to the valley of Eshcol, they cut down from there a branch with one  cluster of grapes and brought it away on a pole carried by two men. They  also took some pomegranates and figs. That place was called the valley  of the Grape Cluster because of the cluster which the Israelites cut  down there.    Then they returned to Moses and Aaron and all the Israelites at Kadesh  and brought back word to them and showed them the fruit of the land.  They reported to Moses, \"We went to the land to which you sent us; and  it indeed is full of milk and honey; and this is some of its fruit. But  the people who live in the land are strong, and the cities are very  large and have high walls about them.\"    Then Caleb quieted the people and said, \"Let us go up at once and take  it, for we are well able to conquer it.\" But the men who had gone up  with him said, \"We are not able to conquer the people, for they are  stronger than we, and all the people whom we saw there are very tall and  large. There we saw the giants; we were as grasshoppers in our own  sight, and so we seemed to them.\"    All the people wept that night and cried out, \"Why did Jehovah bring us  to this land to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will be  taken captive. Would it not be better for us to return to Egypt?\" So  they said to one another, \"Let us choose a leader and return to Egypt.\"    Then Moses and Aaron bowed low before all the Israelites who were  gathered there, and Joshua and Caleb, who were among those who explored  the land, tore their clothes and said to them, \"The land which we went  to explore is a very good land. If Jehovah is pleased with us, he will  bring us into this land and give it to us, a land which is full of milk  and honey. Only do not rebel against Jehovah. Fear not the people of the  land, for they will supply us with food. Their defense is taken away  from over them, and Jehovah is with us; fear them not.\" But the people  would not trust Jehovah.    Then Jehovah said to Moses, \"How long will this people despise me? How  long will they refuse to trust me in spite of all of the wonders which I  have performed before their eyes? I will send sickness upon them and  destroy them, and I will make you and your family a nation greater and  mightier than theirs.\"    But Moses said to Jehovah, \"When the Egyptians hear it, they will say,  'Jehovah has killed them in the wilderness because he was not able to  bring this people into the land which he solemnly promised to them.'  Forgive, I pray thee, the guilt of this people, because thy love is  great, even as thou hast forgiven them from the time they left Egypt  even until now.\"    Jehovah said, \"I have forgiven as you have asked; but as surely as I  live and as surely as the whole earth shall be filled with the glory of  Jehovah, none of the men who have seen my glory and my wonders which I  performed in Egypt and in the wilderness, and yet have tested me these  ten times and have not listened to my voice, shall see the land which I  have solemnly promised to their fathers, neither shall any of those who  despise me see it. But I will bring my servant Caleb to the land to  which he went, for he has shown a different spirit and has faithfully  followed me, and his children shall possess it. But your little ones,  who, you said, would be captives of war, I will bring in, and they shall  possess the land which you have refused. Your dead bodies shall fall in  this wilderness, and your children shall be wanderers there forty years  and shall suffer for your unfaithfulness until your bodies have all  decayed in the wilderness.\"      THE LAST WORDS OF MOSES    When Moses was old, he said to all the Israelites, \"I am a hundred and  twenty years old this day. I can no longer go out and come in, and  Jehovah has said to me, 'You shall not go over this river Jordan.'  Jehovah your God is going over before you. He will destroy these nations  before you, and you shall drive them out; and Joshua is going over to  lead you as Jehovah has commanded. Be brave and strong, do not be afraid  of them, for Jehovah your God is leading you; he will not fail you nor  forsake you.\"    Moses also called Joshua and said to him in the presence of all Israel,  \"Be brave and strong, for you shall bring this people into the land  which Jehovah has promised to their fathers to give them; and you shall  give it to them. Jehovah is going before you; he will be with you, he  will not fail nor forsake you; fear not, nor be frightened.\"    Then Moses went up on the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo to the summit of  Pisgah opposite Jericho. And Jehovah showed him all the land, and said  to him, \"This is the land which I have solemnly promised to Abraham, to  Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, 'I will give it to your children.' I have  let you see it with your own eyes, but you shall not go over there.\"    So Moses, the servant of Jehovah, died there in the land of Moab as  Jehovah had said. And Jehovah buried him in the deep valley in the land  of Moab; but to this day no man knows the place"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23593"],[0,"Lectures on Architecture and Painting, Delivered at Edinburgh in November 1853 (#15)"],[1,"things and  contemptible details; and not on essential and large things. Now, in the  first place, as soon as our architects become capable of doing and  managing little and contemptible things, it will be time to talk about  larger ones; at present I do not see that they can design so much as a  niche or a bracket, and therefore they need not as yet think about  anything larger. For although, as both just now, and always, I have  said, there is as much science of arrangement needed in the designing of  a small group of parts as of a large one, yet assuredly designing the  larger one is _not the easier_ work of the two. For the eye and mind can  embrace the smaller object more completely, and if the powers of  conception are feeble, they get embarrassed by the inferior members  which fall _within_ the divisions of the larger design.[21] So that, of  course, the best way is to begin with the smaller features; for most  assuredly, those who cannot design small things cannot design large  ones; and yet, on the other hand, whoever can design small things  _perfectly_, can design whatever he chooses. The man who, without  copying, and by his own true and original power, can arrange a cluster  of rose-leaves nobly, can design anything. He may fail from want of  taste or feeling, but not from want of power.    [Footnote 21: Thus, in speaking of Pugin's designs, I said, \"Expect no  cathedrals of him; but no one, at present, can design a better finial,  though he will never design even a finial perfectly.\" But even this I  said less with reference to powers of arrangement, than to materials of  fancy; for many men have store enough to last them through a boss or a  bracket, but not to last them through a church front.]    And the real reason why architects are so eager in protesting against my  close examination of details, is simply that they know they dare not  meet me on that ground. Being, as I have said, in reality _not_  architects, but builders, they can indeed raise a large building, with  copied ornaments, which, being huge and white, they hope the public may  pronounce \"handsome.\" But they cannot design a cluster of  oak-leaves--no, nor a single human figure--no, nor so much as a beast,  or a bird, or a bird's nest! Let them first learn to invent as much as  will fill a quatre-foil, or point a pinnacle, and then it will be time  enough to reason with them on the principles of the sublime.    65. But farther. The things that I have dwelt upon in examining  buildings, though often their least parts, are always in reality their  principal parts. That is the principal part of a building in which its  mind is contained, and that, as I have just shown, is its sculpture--and  painting. I do with a building as I do with a man, watch the eye and the  lips: when they are bright and eloquent, the form of the body is of  little consequence.    Whatever other objections have been made to this second proposition,  arise, as far as I remember, merely from a confusion of the idea of  essentialness or primariness with the idea of nobleness. The essential  thing in a building,--its _first_ virtue,--is that it be strongly  built, and fit for its uses. The noblest thing in a building, and its  _highest_ virtue, is that it be nobly sculptured or painted.[22]    [Footnote 22: Of course I use the term painting as including every mode  of applying color.]    66. One or two important corollaries yet remain to be stated. It has  just been said that to sacrifice the convenience of a building to its  external appearance is a futility and absurdity, and that convenience  and stability are to be attained at the smallest cost. But when that  convenience _has_ been attained, the adding the noble characters of life  by painting and sculpture, is a work in which all possible cost may be  wisely admitted. There is great difficulty in fully explaining the  various bearings of this proposition, so as to do away with the chances  of its being erroneously understood and applied. For although, in the  first designing of the building, nothing is to be admitted but what is  wanted, and no useless wings are to be added to balance useful ones, yet  in its ultimate designing, when its sculpture and color become precious,  it may be that actual room is wanted to display them, or richer symmetry  wanted to deserve them; and in such cases even a useless wall may be  built to bear the sculpture, as at San Michele of Lucca, or a useless  portion added to complete the cadences, as at St. Mark's of Venice, or  useless height admitted in order to increase the impressiveness, as in  nearly every noble building in the world. But the right to do this is  dependent upon the actual _purpose_ of the building becoming no longer  one of utility merely; as the purpose of a cathedral is not so much to  shelter the congregation as to awe them. In such cases even some  sacrifice of convenience may occasionally be admitted, as in the case of  certain forms of pillared churches. But for the most part, the great law  is, convenience first, and then the noblest decoration possible; and  this is peculiarly the case in domestic buildings, and such public ones  as are constantly to be used for practical purposes.    67. Proposition 3d.--_Ornamentation should be visible._    The reader may imagine this to be an indisputable position; but,  practically, it is one of the last which modern architects are likely to  admit; for it involves much more than appears at first sight. To render  ornamentation, with all its qualities, clearly and entirely visible in  its appointed place on the building, requires a knowledge of effect and  a power of design which few even of the best artists possess, and which  modern architects, so far from possessing, do not so much as comprehend  the existence of. But, without dwelling on this highest manner of  rendering ornament \"visible,\" I desire only at present to convince the  reader thoroughly of the main fact asserted in the text, that while  modern builders decorate the _tops_ of buildings, mediaeval builders  decorated the _bottom_. So singular is the ignorance yet prevailing of  the first principles of Gothic architecture, that I saw this assertion  marked with notes of interrogation in several of the reports of these  Lectures; although, at Edinburgh, it was only necessary for those who  doubted it to have walked to Holyrood Chapel, in order to convince  themselves of the truth of it, so far as their own city was concerned;  and although, most assuredly, the cathedrals of Europe have now been  drawn often enough to establish the very simple fact that their best  sculpture is in their porches, not in their steeples. However, as this  great Gothic principle seems yet unacknowledged, let me state it here,  once for all, namely, that the whole building is decorated, in all pure  and fine examples, with the most exactly studied respect to the powers  of the eye; the richest and most delicate sculpture being put on the  walls of the porches, or on the facade of the building, just high enough  above the ground to secure it from accidental (not from wanton[23])  injury. The decoration, as it rises, becomes _always_ bolder, and in the  buildings of the greatest times, _generally_ simpler. Thus at San Zeno  and the duomo of Verona, the only delicate decorations are on the  porches and lower walls of the facades, the rest of the buildings being  left comparatively plain; in the ducal palace of Venice the only very  careful work is in the lowest capitals; and so also the richness of the  work diminishes upwards in the transepts of Rouen, and facades of  Bayeux, Rheims, Amiens, Abbeville,[24] Lyons, and Notre Dame of Paris.  But in the middle and later Gothic the tendency is to produce an equal  richness _of effect_ over the whole building, or even to increase the  richness towards the top; but this is done so skillfully that no fine  work is wasted; and when the spectator ascends to the higher points of  the building, which he thought were of the most consummate delicacy, he  finds them Herculean in strength and rough-hewn in style, the really  delicate work being all put at the base. The general treatment of  Romanesque work is to increase the _number_ of arches at the top, which  at once enriches and lightens the mass, and to put the finest  _sculpture_ of the arches at the bottom. In towers of all kinds and  periods the _effective_ enrichment is towards the top, and most rightly,  since their dignity is in their height; but they are never made the  recipients of fine sculpture, with, as far as I know, the single  exception of Giotto's campanile, which indeed has fine sculpture, _but  it is at the bottom_.    [Footnote 23: Nothing is more notable in good Gothic than the confidence  of its builders in the respect of the people for their work. A great  school of architecture cannot exist when this respect cannot be  calculated upon, as it would be vain to put fine sculpture within the  reach of a population whose only pleasure would be in defacing it.]    [Footnote 24: The church to Abbeville is late flamboyant, but well  deserves, for the exquisite beauty of its porches, to be named even with  the great works of the thirteenth century.]    The facade of Wells Cathedral seems to be an exception to the general  rule, in having its principal decoration at the top; but it is on a  scale of perfect power and effectiveness; while in the base modern  Gothic of Milan Cathedral the statues are cut delicately everywhere, and  the builders think it a merit that the visitor must climb to the roof  before he can see them; and our modern Greek and Italian architecture  reaches the utmost pitch of absurdity by placing its fine work _at the  top only_. So that the general condition of the thing may be stated  boldly, as in the text; the principal ornaments of Gothic buildings  being in their porches, and of modern buildings, in their parapets.    68.
