Even in India, where transport is  comparatively easy, German goods swamp the bazaars in preference to  English goods. Much more will this be the case in Persia when the railway  comes to the Persian boundary.    The German Minister is certainly sparing no efforts to foster German  interests in Persia, and the enterprising Emperor William has shown every  possible attention to the Shah on his visit to Berlin, in order that the  racial antipathy, which for some reason or other Persians entertain  towards Germans, may with all due speed be wiped out.    To us the British Legation is more interesting at present. We may well be  proud of our present Minister, Sir Arthur Hardinge, a man of whose like  we have few in our diplomatic service. I do not think that a man more fit  for Persia than Sir Arthur could be found anywhere in the British Empire.  He possesses quite extraordinary talent, with a quick working brain, a  marvellous aptitude for languages--in a few months' residence in Persia  he had mastered the Persian language, and is able to converse in it  fluently--and is endowed with a gift which few Britishers possess,  refined tact and a certain amount of thoughtful consideration for other  people's feelings.    Nor is this all. Sir Arthur seems to understand Orientals thoroughly, and  Persians in particular. He is extremely dignified in his demeanour  towards the native officials, yet he is most affable and cheery, with a  very taking, charming manner. That goes a much longer way in Persia than  the other unfortunate manner by which many of our officials think to show  dignity--sheer stiffness, rudeness, bluntness, clumsiness--which offends,  offends bitterly, instead of impressing.    A fluent and most graceful speaker, with a strong touch of Oriental  flowery forms of speech in his compliments to officials, with an eye that  accurately gauges situations--usually in Persia very difficult ones--a  man full of resource and absolutely devoid of ridiculous insular  notions--a man who studies hard and works harder still--a man with  unbounded energy and an enthusiast in his work--a man who knows his  subject well, although he has been such a short time in Teheran--this is  our British Minister at the Shah's Court.    Nor is this faint praise. Sir Arthur Hardinge has done more in a few  months to save British prestige and to safeguard British interests in  Persia than the public know, and this he has done merely by his own  personal genius and charm, rather than by instructions or help from the  home Government.    While in Teheran I had much opportunity of meeting a great many high  Persian officials, and all were unanimous in singing the praises of our  new Minister. Many of them seemed very bitter against some of his  predecessors, but whether the fault was in the predecessors themselves or  in the home Government, it is not for me to say. Anyhow, bygones are  bygones, and we must make the best of our present opportunities. The  staff at our Legation and Consulate is also first-class.    It is to be hoped, now that the South African war is over, that the  Government will be able to devote more attention to the Persian Question,  a far more serious matter than we imagine; and as extreme ignorance  prevails in this country about Persia--even in circles where it should  not exist--it would be well, when we have such excellent men as Sir  Arthur Hardinge at the helm, in whose intelligence we may confidently and  absolutely trust, to give him a little more assistance and freedom of  action, so as to allow him a chance of safeguarding our interests  properly, and possibly of preventing further disasters.    It is not easy for the uninitiated to realise the value of certain  concessions obtained for the British by Sir Arthur Hardinge, such as, for  instance, the new land telegraph line _via_ Kerman Beluchistan to India.  Of the petroleum concessions, of which one hears a great deal of late, I  would prefer not to speak.    The Legation grounds in Teheran itself are extensive and beautiful, with  a great many fine trees and shady, cool avenues. The Legation house is  handsomely furnished, and dotted all over the gardens are the various  other buildings for secretaries, attaches, and interpreters. All the  structures are of European architecture--simple, but solid. In summer,  however, all the Legations shift their quarters to what is called in  Teheran \"_la campagne de_ Golahek, de Tejerish, de Zargandeh,\"--by which  gracefully misleading and misapplied terms are indicated the suburban  residences of the Legations, at the foot of the arid, barren, hot, dusty  Shamran range of mountains.    Golahek, where the British Legation is to be found, does actually boast  of a few green trees in the Legation grounds; and a cluster or two of  nominally \"green\" vegetation--really whitish brown--can be seen at  Zargandeh, where the Russian and Belgian Legations are side by side, and  Tejerish, where the Persian Foreign Office and many Persian officials  have their summer residences.    The drive from Teheran to Golahek--seven miles--is dusty beyond words.  There are wretched-looking trees here and there along the road, so dried  and white with dust as to excite compassion. Half-way to Golahek the  monotony of the journey is broken by a sudden halt at a khafe-khana, into  which the coachman rushes, leaving the horses to take care of themselves,  while he sips refreshing glasses of tea. When it suits his convenience he  returns to splash buckets of water between the horses' legs and under  their tails. This, he told me, in all seriousness, was to prevent  sunstroke (really, the Persian can be humorous without knowing it), and  was a preventive imported with civilised ways from Europe! The ears and  manes of the animals are then pulled violently, after which the horses  are considered able to proceed.    [Illustration: Persian Cossacks (Teheran) Drilled by Russian Officers.]    The Persian Government gives each Legation a guard of soldiers. The  British Legation is guarded by infantry soldiers--an untidy, ragged,  undisciplined lot, with cylindrical hats worn at all angles on the side  of the head, and with uniforms so dirty and torn that it is difficult to  discern what they should be like. Nearly all other Legations are provided  with soldiers of the (Persian) Cossack regiment, who are infinitely  better drilled and clothed than the infantry regiments. They are quite  military in appearance. It was believed that these Cossacks, being  drilled by Russian military instructors, would not be acceptable at the  British Legation, hence the guard of infantry soldiers.    The Russian Legation has two additional Russian cavalry soldiers.    The country residences of all the Legations are quite comfortable, pretty  and unpretentious, with the usual complement of furniture of folding  pattern, so convenient but so inartistic, and a superabundance of cane  chairs. Really good furniture being very expensive in Teheran, a good  deal of the upholstery of the Teheran Legations is conveyed to the  country residences for the summer months. Perhaps nothing is more  amusing to watch than one of these removals to or from the country.  Chairs, tables, sofas, and most private effects are tied to pack-saddles  on ponies, mules or donkeys, with bundles of mattrasses, blankets, and  linen piled anyhow upon them, while the more brittle articles of the  household are all amassed into a high pyramid on a gigantic tray and  balanced on a man's head. Rows of these equilibrists, with the most  precious glass and crockery of the homestead, can be noticed toddling  along on the Golahek road, dodging carriages and cavaliers in a most  surprising manner. They are said never to break even the smallest and  most fragile articles, but such is certainly not the case with the  heavily laden donkeys and mules, which often collide or collapse  altogether, with most disastrous results to the heavier pieces of  furniture.    On my arrival in Teheran I received a most charming invitation to go and  stay at the British Legation, but partly owing to the fact that I wished  to remain in town and so be more in touch with the natives themselves,  partly because I wished to be unbiassed in any opinion that I might form,  I decided not to accept anybody's hospitality while in Teheran. This I am  very glad I did, for I feel I can now express an opinion which, whether  right or wrong, is my own, and has not been in any way influenced by any  one.          CHAPTER XI         Visits to high Persian officials--Meftah-es-Sultaneh--Persian       education--A college for orphans--Uncomfortable etiquette--The       Foreign Office--H.E.

Perhaps the description of one or two visits to high Persian officials  may interest the reader.    Through the kindness of the Persian Legation in London I had received  letters of introduction which I forwarded to their addresses on my  arrival in Teheran. The first to answer, a few hours after I had reached  Teheran, was Meftah-es-Sultaneh (Davoud), the highest person in the  Foreign Office after the Minister, who in a most polite letter begged me  to go to tea with him at once. He had just come to town from Tejerish,  but would leave again the same evening.    [Illustration: The Eftetahie College, supported by Meftah-el-Mulk.]    Escorted by the messenger, I at once drove to Meftah's Palace, outwardly,  like other palaces, of extremely modest appearance, and entered by a  small doorway leading through very narrow passages. Led by my guide, we  suddenly passed through a most quaint court, beautifully clean and with a  pretty fountain in the centre,--but no time was given me to rest and  admire.
