[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21654"],[0,"In and Around Berlin (#15)"],[1,"oratory for two  hours held the attention of all to his own opposing views. A man of  robust physique, still in the prime of life, Richter's dark complexion  and facial expression give the impression of \"staying qualities\"  formidable as lasting. The session opened at eleven o'clock A.M., and  the veteran General and Field-Marshal Von Moltke was the first  speaker. His rising was the signal for a general hush, and for about a  quarter of an hour all listened in breathless silence. Half the width  of the hall from the observer, his more than eighty years seemed to  sit lightly on \"the great taciturnist;\" and his fair complexion, fine  brow, thin face, and singular firmness of mouth have the fascination  of genius. Later, during the long and sometimes denunciatory speech of  Richter, he seemed wearied. Rising from his seat in the front rank of  the Conservatives on the extreme right, he moved to the rear, stood in  the aisle, took a vacant seat,--resting by various changes for  fifteen or twenty minutes; but when, between one and two o'clock, the  time for Bismarck's entrance approached, he returned to his own seat  and thenceforth listened attentively. Like the aged Emperor, Von  Moltke's age was most apparent in his movements. Sitting or standing,  he was the graceful, well-bred gentleman, as well as the dignified  chief of the German army. In walking, his movement is slow, and  lacking vigor to a marked degree. The offer of the Opposition to vote  for the bill with a term of one, two, or even three years, while  declaring that they could not vote for seven, was haughtily received  by the Prime Minister, who had already given his reasons, supported by  the Emperor, by Von Moltke, and other eminent military authority, for  adhering to the longer term. \"I will not abate a hair's breadth of the  septenate,\" said he. \"If you do not vote it, I prefer to deal with  another Reichstag.\" This on the second day of the debate. On the third  day Bismarck replied to some of the positions of the Opposition, in a  speech of three quarters of an hour, immediately following his  opponent, Richter. The latter, and the members on the left included in  the three great divisions of the Liberal party, retired from the hall  at the conclusion of Richter's two hours' speech; but the centre, or  Catholic party, among whom were several priests and a number of very  keen and watchful physiognomies, remained in their seats, as well as  the Conservatives of both grades. Soon Richter was back, though  without his supporters. Fumbling a moment at his desk for pencil and  paper, he stepped forward in the aisle, so as not to lose the  sentences of Bismarck (occasionally somewhat indistinct), and refusing  to be diverted for more than an instant by the communications of  friends and officials. Cries of _Ja wohl! Ja wohl!_ and _Bravo!_ were  heard from the right during the speech of Bismarck, with now and again  a general ripple of laughter at some pleasantry accessible to the  German mind; but these were much outdone in heartiness by the applause  which frequently interrupted Richter when speaking. There is a  massiveness about this scene which rises up in memory with a vividness  greater, if possible, than the reality made on our excited and wearied  endurance during the hours we spent there. Later, Windhorst, the  leader of the Roman Catholic party, made a memorable speech. The dozen  great electric lights depending from the ceiling were extinguished  when the early afternoon sun faintly struggled with the clouds for  entrance through the skylight which forms the entire roof of the room,  except those left burning near the seats of Bismarck and Von Moltke,  which brought these foremost figures into strong relief. Prince  William--now Emperor--and the gentlemen of his party were in gay  uniforms in the Imperial box, and the diplomatic box was lighted  mainly by the diamonds of the ladies who sat there; while the crowded  ranks of the other galleries were in dim twilight. It was a picture to  remain in history. The bill was lost. In less than twenty-four hours  after we left the Reichstag, Bismarck had read his summary dissolution  of the Diet, and before another sunset the hall was closed and silent.  The Iron Chancellor had made his appeal to the country. The war-cloud  was heavy over Europe, and great was the excitement in Berlin. Under  fear of a bolt which might strike at any moment, the elections for a  new Chamber were held, and Bismarck had his will.    The Reichstag is the representative body of the whole German Empire,  with its four kingdoms, six grand duchies, and sixteen lesser  principalities and powers united under one emperor. Prussia is a  kingdom which forms but one, though the most important, of these  constituent parts. The Reichstag is a kind of Upper and Lower House in  one; the Bundesrath or Federal Council, with somewhat arbitrary  powers, has its private Council-room; but the Chancellor of the Empire  is its presiding officer, and, with the members of this Council,  occupies the elevated platform at the right of the President of the  Reichstag. The chief function of the latter as a legal Chamber of  Deputies is to check the power of the Bundesrath. It can thus reject  bills and refuse appropriations, but has no power to bring about a  change of administration.    The Prussian Diet is composed of two separate houses. The building of  the Lower House--the Abgeordnetenhaus--is near the eastern extremity  of the Leipziger Strasse, and the House of Lords--Herrenhaus--is  adjacent to the Reichstag-Gebaude. The Prussian Lower House is  somewhat larger in numbers than the Reichstag, and is of course an  elective body. It contained a number of eminent men,--as Herr  Windhorst, also the leader of the Catholic party in the Reichstag,  and Professor Virchow. On the day of our visit no business of special  importance was before the assembly, and visitors' tickets were  obtained with an ease in pleasing contrast to the most difficult feat  of obtaining entrance to the Reichstag on a great occasion.    The House of Lords is reputed a dull place, and is seldom visited. In  a dwelling formerly occupying this site (No. 3 Leipziger Strasse), and  of which some memorials remain, Felix Mendelssohn spent, with his  parents and sister Fanny, several years of his wonderful youth; and  the \"Gartenhaus\" of this estate witnessed the memorable private  performance of the work which first revealed his greatness to the  world,--the \"Overture to the Midsummer Night's Dream.\"          VII.    PROMINENT PERSONAGES.      \"I love my Emperor,\" said \"our little Fraeulein,\" laying her hand on  her heart, one day when we were talking of him.    It was on our first day in Germany that we, returning from church a  little after noon, were kindly greeted by an American lady who saw  that we were strangers. \"The Emperor lives on this street,\" she said;  \"and if we hasten, we may see him when he comes to the window to  review his Guards.\" Soon we were before the palace on Unter den  Linden, a substantial-looking building facing the north, with an  eastern exposure. The Imperial standard was floating over the palace,  denoting the presence of his Majesty. The room on the ground floor,  northeast corner, of the palace is the one used by Emperor William I.  as his study; and one back of this was his bedroom, containing the  simple iron cot which was the companion of his soldier days, and which  remained the couch of his choice to the end of life. At \"the historic  window\" we often saw him. Every day at noon, and sometimes long  before, the crowd began to gather in the street opposite this window,  for a sight of his Majesty when he came for a moment to review his  Guards at a quarter to one. It was touching to see the devotion of the  people, standing patiently in all weathers; mothers and fathers  holding up their children that they might catch a sight of the  idolized Kaiser. Rarely did he disappoint them. As the military music  of the guard drew near, and the tramp of the soldiers fell on the  pavement before the palace, the aged man would appear at the window in  full uniform of dark blue with scarlet trimmings and silver  epaulettes, returning the salutations of the guard, and bowing and  waving his white-gloved hand to the people, then retiring within the  shadow of the lace curtains. Sometimes the cheering broke forth anew  as he was lost to sight, and the welkin was made to ring with the  Kaiser-song, or some hymn of Fatherland, until he indulgently appeared  again, bowing his bald head, his kindly face lighted up with a smile.  In full-front view he did not look like a man in his ninetieth year.  Many a man of sixty-five or seventy looks older. When he turned, the  side view revealed that his form was not erect; but only when he  walked with a slow movement could one realize that this soldier of  perfect drill--this courtly gentleman--was one who had seen almost a  century of life. His earliest memories were of privation and hardship.  In his young boyhood the First Napoleon held Berlin in his grasp, and  the family of the King, Frederick William III., fled to Koenigsberg.  The beautiful and noble Queen Louise and her two little boys,  afterwards Frederick William IV. and William I., wandered at one time  in the forests, and made their food of wild berries. They amused  themselves by making wreaths of _cornblumen_,--blue flowers answering  closely to our \"bachelors' buttons,\"--which grow wild everywhere in  Germany. Thenceforward the _cornblumen_ were dear to the young  princes, and they were \"the Emperor's flowers\" to the end of his  Imperial life. So devoted was he to the memory of his mother, that  when in his later years he saw a young girl whose striking beauty of  face and form reminded him of Queen Louise, he persuaded her to allow  her portrait to be taken, that it might remind him of the mother whom  he remembered in her youth. This beautiful "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21656"],[0,"The Princess of the School (#15)"],[1,"feel really safe again, I'm afraid. We shall all be horribly  nervous for a long time.\"    Only the most striking items in Part II were selected for performance,  as it was growing late, and most of the guests would soon have to take  their leave. There was an affecting tableau of the parting of the  widowed Queen of Edward IV from her little son, Richard, Duke of York; a  charming pageant of the old street cries of London, in which dainty  maidens in eighteenth-century costumes appeared with bunches of \"Sweet  Lavender,\" and baskets of \"Cherry Ripe,\" and, after singing the  appropriate songs, went the round of the audience and sold their wares.    Noreen, who was the star of the elocution class, recited a poem  describing the sad experience of a typical little waif, and his  reception in the Home. It was a pretty piece, and had been composed  expressly for the Society by a lady who often wrote for magazines.    Then, last of all, came Carmel's Sicilian dance. Miss Lowe had  fortunately been able to obtain the score of the Pastorale, and with  music and costume complete the performance was an even greater success  than it had been on the terrace at Bradstone. People clapped the little  figure, partly for her charming dancing and partly for her pluck in  trapping the burglar, so that altogether she received quite an ovation.    \"We shan't forget the 'Waifs and Strays' afternoon in a hurry,\" said  Lilias, as she tidied her possessions afterwards, for it was _her_  drawer that the burglar had turned upside down in his search for  valuables. \"I feel I want to sleep with a revolver under my pillow!\"    \"If you did, I'd be far more afraid of you than of the burglar!\"  protested Bertha. \"I know you'd let it off at the wrong person. I don't  suppose anybody else is likely to come burgling here, so you needn't  alarm yourself!\"    \"But if they do, Miss Wiseacre?\"    \"Then I should turn them over into the dressing-room, to be dealt with  at her discretion by Princess Carmel!\" laughed Bertha. \"I believe she's  equal to catching one of them in a mousetrap if she gets the  opportunity!\"          CHAPTER IX    The Open Road      It was fortunate for Carmel that her first experience of England should  come in the spring and early summer. Had she arrived straight from sunny  Sicily to face autumn rains or winter snows, I verily believe her  courage would have failed, and she would have written an urgent and  imploring appeal to be fetched home. For the white, vine-covered house  that looked over the blue waters of the Mediterranean was still  essentially \"home\" to Carmel. She had been born and bred in the south,  and though one half of her was purely English, there was another side  that was strongly Italian. She was deeply attached to all her relations  and friends in Sicily, and from her point of view it was exile to live  so far away from them. The fact that she was owner of the Chase was, in  her estimation, no compensation whatever for her banishment from \"Casa  Bianca.\" She made a very sweet and gentle little heiress, however. As  yet she was mistress only in name, for during her minority everything  was left in the hands of Mr. Bowden and a certain Canon Lowe, who were  guardians to all Mr. Ingleton's grandchildren, and kept the Chase open  as a home for them. The three girls returned there from Chilcombe Hall  at the end of the term, and were joined by the younger boys from their  preparatory school.    For a week or two they enjoyed themselves in the grounds and the park.  There was much to show Carmel, and she was happy sitting in the garden  or wandering in the woods. She soon made friends with the people on the  estate. The gamekeeper's children would come running out to meet her,  and stand round smiling while she hunted in her pocket for chocolates;  Milner's little girl adored her, and even the shy baby at the lodge  waxed friendly. Carmel was intensely fond of children, and the affection  which she had bestowed on younger brothers and sisters at home cropped  out on every occasion where her life touched that of smaller people. To  Roland, Bevis, and Clifford she was a charming companion. She would go  walks with them in the woods, help them to arrange their various  collections of butterflies, foreign stamps, and picture post cards, and  play endless games of draughts, halma, or bagatelle.    \"You slave after those boys as if you were their nursery governess!\"  remarked Lilias one day, just a little nettled that Clifford ran  instinctively to Carmel for sympathy instead of to his sister. \"I  promised to help them with those caterpillar boxes to-morrow, and so I  will, if you'll leave them. I really can't be bothered to-day.\"    Carmel yielded instantly. Part of her intense charm was the ready tact  with which she was careful never to usurp the place of any one else. She  put aside the muslin that was to form covers for the boxes, and slipped  her scissors back into the case.    Clifford, however, who was a budding naturalist, and most keen on  collecting, was highly disgusted.    \"I want my boxes to-day!\" he wailed. \"I've no place to put my  caterpillars when I find them. They crawl out of the old boxes. Why  shouldn't Carmel make me some? I know hers would be beauties.\"    \"Lilias will make you some nicer ones to-morrow,\" urged his cousin.  \"Suppose we take our butterfly nets on to the heath to-day, and try to  find some 'blues.' You haven't a really nice specimen, you know. And I  think we might find some moths on the trees in the wood, if we look  about carefully. It's worth trying, isn't it?\"    \"Oh yes! Do let us! Shall we start now?\" agreed Clifford, much  mollified.    On the whole the three girls got along excellently, but if there was any  hint at disturbance it generally arose from Lilias, whose pride would  be up in arms at the most absurd trifles. She was annoyed that Carmel  was asked to give away the prizes at the village sports, and showed her  dissatisfaction so plainly that her sweet-tempered cousin, rather than  have any fuss, solved the situation by asking Cousin Clare to perform  the ceremony instead, considerably to the disappointment of the  committee, who had thought the new heiress was the appropriate  patroness.    Lilias and Dulcie took diametrically opposite views about the Chase. The  former stuck firmly to her opinion that it ought to have been Everard's,  that her brother was an ill-used outcast, and that it was only sisterly  feeling to resent seeing anybody else in his place. Her attitude to  Carmel was almost as strong as that of King Robert of Sicily in  Longfellow's _Tales of a Wayside Inn_ towards the angel who had  temporarily usurped his throne.    Dulcie, on the contrary, had always chafed against Everard's assumption  of superiority and authority. He had been left the same generous legacy  as the rest of the family, and had only to come back and claim his  portion when he wished. If anybody was to have the Chase, she really  preferred that it should belong to Carmel, who never obtruded her  rights, and seemed ready for her cousins to enjoy the property on an  exact equality with herself. The two girls were great friends: they  would go out riding together while Lilias went shopping in the car with  Cousin Clare; they practised duets, and both made crude attempts at  sketching the house. Their tastes in books and fancy-work were somewhat  similar, and they would sit in the shade in the afternoons stitching at  embroidery and eating chocolates.    Three weeks of the summer holidays passed rapidly away in this fashion.  Carmel was glad to have the opportunity of getting to know the Chase,  and admitted its attractions, though her heart was still in Sicily.    Towards the end of August the party broke up and scattered. Carmel had  received an invitation from English relations of her stepfather to join  them on a motor tour; the three little boys were to be taken to rooms at  the seaside by Miss Mason, their late governess; Lilias and Dulcie went  to stay with friends, and Cousin Clare had arranged to attend a  conference. She agreed, however, that when Lilias and Dulcie returned  from their visit, they should go with her in the car for a week-end to  Tivermouth, to see how the boys were getting on.    \"If you'll promise we may stay at an hotel!\" stipulated Lilias. \"I  wouldn't spend a week-end in rooms with those three imps for the world.  I'd like to see them, but not at too close quarters.\"    \"It's quite improbable that their landlady would have bedrooms for us,\"  said Cousin Clare. \"So in any case we should be obliged to stop at an  hotel. In this crowded season I shall engage rooms beforehand.\"    \"Hurrah!\" triumphed Dulcie, who was anxious for a grown-up experience.  \"I must say I hate staying with the boys near the beach; the  sitting-room's always overflowing with their seaweed and other messes.\"    \"What a joke if _I_ were to turn up at the hotel too!\" said Carmel. \"I  believe the Rogers are going down to Devonshire. I shall tell them the  date you'll be at Tivermouth. They'll possibly like to meet you.\"    \"Oh, do! It would be such fun!\" agreed Dulcie. \"We'd have an absolutely  topping time together. Persuade them as hard as you can!\"    \"I'll do my best!\" agreed Carmel.    As it is impossible to follow the adventures of everybody, we will  concern ourselves particularly with the experiences of our heroine, who  was to take her first motor tour among English scenery. The party in the  comfortable Rover car consisted of Major and Mrs. Rogers, their daughter  Sheila, their guest Carmel, and a chauffeur. Major Rogers was still  suffering from the effects of wounds, and was more or less of a  semi-invalid, a condition which made him fussy at times, and too  independent at others, for directly he felt a trifle better he would  immediately begin to break all the rules that the doctors had laid down  for his treatment. He was an amusing, humorous sort of man, who"]]]
