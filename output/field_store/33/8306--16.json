This sort of thing tickled the simple-minded peer.    George joined the procession punctually at two o'clock, just as  Keggs was clearing his throat preparatory to saying, \"We are now in  the main 'all, and before going any further I would like to call  your attention to Sir Peter Lely's portrait of--\" It was his custom  to begin his Thursday lectures with this remark, but today it was  postponed; for, no sooner had George appeared, than a breezy voice  on the outskirts of the throng spoke in a tone that made  competition impossible.    \"For goodness' sake, George.\"    And Billie Dore detached herself from the group, a trim vision in  blue. She wore a dust-coat and a motor veil, and her eyes and  cheeks were glowing from the fresh air.    \"For goodness' sake, George, what are you doing here?\"    \"I was just going to ask you the same thing.\"    \"Oh, I motored down with a boy I know. We had a breakdown just  outside the gates. We were on our way to Brighton for lunch. He  suggested I should pass the time seeing the sights while he fixed  up the sprockets or the differential gear or whatever it was. He's  coming to pick me up when he's through. But, on the level, George,  how do you get this way? You sneak out of town and leave the show  flat, and nobody has a notion where you are. Why, we were thinking  of advertising for you, or going to the police or something. For  all anybody knew, you might have been sandbagged or dropped in the  river.\"    This aspect of the matter had not occurred to George till now. His  sudden descent on Belpher had seemed to him the only natural course  to pursue. He had not realized that he would be missed, and that  his absence might have caused grave inconvenience to a large number  of people.    \"I never thought of that. I--well, I just happened to come here.\"    \"You aren't living in this old castle?\"    \"Not quite. I've a cottage down the road. I wanted a few days in  the country so I rented it.\"    \"But what made you choose this place?\"    Keggs, who had been regarding these disturbers of the peace with  dignified disapproval, coughed.    \"If you would not mind, madam. We are waiting.\"    \"Eh? How's that?\" Miss Dore looked up with a bright smile. \"I'm  sorry. Come along, George. Get in the game.\" She nodded cheerfully  to the butler. \"All right. All set now. You may fire when ready,  Gridley.\"    Keggs bowed austerely, and cleared his throat again.    \"We are now in the main 'all, and before going any further I would  like to call your attention to Sir Peter Lely's portrait of the  fifth countess. Said by experts to be in his best manner.\"    There was an almost soundless murmur from the mob, expressive of  wonder and awe, like a gentle breeze rustling leaves. Billie Dore  resumed her conversation in a whisper.    \"Yes, there was an awful lot of excitement when they found that you  had disappeared. They were phoning the Carlton every ten minutes  trying to get you. You see, the summertime number flopped on the  second night, and they hadn't anything to put in its place. But  it's all right. They took it out and sewed up the wound, and now  you'd never know there had been anything wrong. The show was ten  minutes too long, anyway.\"    \"How's the show going?\"    \"It's a riot. They think it will run two years in London. As far  as I can make it out you don't call it a success in London unless  you can take your grandchildren to see the thousandth night.\"    \"That's splendid. And how is everybody? All right?\"    \"Fine. That fellow Gray is still hanging round Babe. It beats me  what she sees in him. Anybody but an infant could see the man  wasn't on the level. Well, I don't blame you for quitting London,  George. This sort of thing is worth fifty Londons.\"    The procession had reached one of the upper rooms, and they were  looking down from a window that commanded a sweep of miles of the  countryside, rolling and green and wooded. Far away beyond the last  covert Belpher Bay gleamed like a streak of silver. Billie Dore  gave a little sigh.    \"There's nothing like this in the world. I'd like to stand here for  the rest of my life, just lapping it up.\"    \"I will call your attention,\" boomed Keggs at their elbow, \"to this  window, known in the fem'ly tredition as Leonard's Leap. It was in  the year seventeen 'undred and eighty-seven that Lord Leonard  Forth, eldest son of 'Is Grace the Dook of Lochlane, 'urled 'imself  out of this window in order to avoid compromising the beautiful  Countess of Marshmoreton, with oom 'e is related to 'ave 'ad a  ninnocent romance. Surprised at an advanced hour by 'is lordship  the earl in 'er ladyship's boudoir, as this room then was, 'e  leaped through the open window into the boughs of the cedar tree  which stands below, and was fortunate enough to escape with a few  'armless contusions.\"    A murmur of admiration greeted the recital of the ready tact of  this eighteenth-century Steve Brodie.    \"There,\" said Billie enthusiastically, \"that's exactly what I mean  about this country. It's just a mass of Leonard's Leaps and things.  I'd like to settle down in this sort of place and spend the rest of  my life milking cows and taking forkfuls of soup to the deserving  villagers.\"    \"We will now,\" said Keggs, herding the mob with a gesture, \"proceed  to the Amber Drawing-Room, containing some Gobelin Tapestries  'ighly spoken of by connoozers.\"    The obedient mob began to drift out in his wake.    \"What do you say, George,\" asked Billie in an undertone, \"if we  side-step the Amber Drawing-Room? I'm wild to get into that garden.  There's a man working among those roses. Maybe he would show us  round.\"    George followed her pointing finger. Just below them a sturdy,  brown-faced man in corduroys was pausing to light a stubby pipe.    \"Just as you like.\"    They made their way down the great staircase. The voice of Keggs,  saying complimentary things about the Gobelin Tapestry, came to  their ears like the roll of distant drums. They wandered out  towards the rose-garden. The man in corduroys had lit his pipe and  was bending once more to his task.    \"Well, dadda,\" said Billie amiably, \"how are the crops?\"    The man straightened himself. He was a nice-looking man of middle  age, with the kind eyes of a friendly dog. He smiled genially, and  started to put his pipe away.    Billie stopped him.    \"Don't stop smoking on my account,\" she said. \"I like it. Well,  you've got the right sort of a job, haven't you! If I was a man,  there's nothing I'd like better than to put in my eight hours in a  rose-garden.\" She looked about her. \"And this,\" she said with  approval, \"is just what a rose-garden ought to be.\"    \"Are you fond of roses--missy?\"    \"You bet I am! You must have every kind here that was ever  invented. All the fifty-seven varieties.\"    \"There are nearly three thousand varieties,\" said the man in  corduroys tolerantly.    \"I was speaking colloquially, dadda. You can't teach me anything  about roses. I'm the guy that invented them. Got any Ayrshires?\"    The man in corduroys seemed to have come to the conclusion that  Billie was the only thing on earth that mattered. This revelation  of a kindred spirit had captured him completely. George was merely  among those present.    \"Those--them--over there are Ayrshires, missy.\"    \"We don't get Ayrshires in America. At least, I never ran across  them. I suppose they do have them.\"    \"You want the right soil.\"    \"Clay and lots of rain.\"    \"You're right.\"    There was an earnest expression on Billie Dore's face that George  had never seen there before.    \"Say, listen, dadda, in this matter of rose-beetles, what would you  do if--\"    George moved away. The conversation was becoming too technical for  him, and he had an idea that he would not be missed. There had come  to him, moreover, in a flash one of those sudden inspirations which  great generals get. He had visited the castle this afternoon  without any settled plan other than a vague hope that he might  somehow see Maud. He now perceived that there was no chance of  doing this. Evidently, on Thursdays, the family went to earth and  remained hidden until the sightseers had gone. But there was  another avenue of communication open to him. This gardener seemed  an exceptionally intelligent man. He could be trusted to deliver a  note to Maud.    In his late rambles about Belpher Castle in the company of Keggs  and his followers, George had been privileged to inspect the  library. It was an easily accessible room, opening off the main  hall. He left Billie and her new friend deep in a discussion of  slugs and plant-lice, and walked quickly back to the house. The  library was unoccupied.    George was a thorough young man. He believed in leaving nothing to  chance. The gardener had seemed a trustworthy soul, but you never  knew. It was possible that he drank. He might forget or lose the  precious note. So, with a wary eye on the door, George hastily  scribbled it in duplicate. This took him but a few minutes. He went  out into the garden again to find Billie Dore on the point of  stepping into a blue automobile.    \"Oh, there you are, George. I wondered where you had got to. Say, I  made quite a hit with dadda. I've given him my address, and he's  promised to send me a whole lot of roses. By the way, shake hands  with Mr. Forsyth. This is George Bevan, Freddie, who wrote the  music of our show.\"    The solemn youth at the wheel extended a hand.    \"Topping show. Topping music. Topping all round.\"    \"Well, good-bye, George. See you soon, I suppose?\"    \"Oh, yes. Give my love to everybody.\"    \"All right. Let her rip, Freddie. Good-bye.\"    \"Good-bye.\"    The blue car gathered speed and vanished down the drive. George  returned to the man in corduroys, who had bent"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22345"],[0,"Memoirs of the Private Life, Return, and Reign of Napoleon in 1815, Vol. I (#15)"],[1,"I  was going to Milan in order to settle my accounts with my friend the  General, he being in my debt for money which I had advanced to him.    Having thus settled my plan, I went on to the \"prefecture de police.\"  Whilst I was stepping across the threshold of the door, my heart began  to beat so violently that I could hardly move or breathe. If at that  instant any body had cried out to me, \"Rascal, what are you about?\" I  think I should have dropped, and that I should have let out the whole  secret. It must not be thought that my confusion arose from cowardly  fear; no, it was the impression which every honest man ought to feel,  when, for the first time in his life, he commits an action which he is  under the necessity of concealing.    In a few minutes I came to myself again. In I went, and presented  myself boldly to Monsieur Riviere, the Prefect of Police. He  cross-questioned me at full length, but my answers were clear and  firm. My countenance was unabashed, and appeared to preclude all  suspicion, and he granted my passport. Yet, at all events, I thought  it prudent to ascertain whether I was watched, and to my great  surprise I found that during two days I was closely followed. I did  not give any token by which my spy could ascertain that I was aware of  his company, and, in order to mislead him, I went to the  _messageries_, where I took and paid for a place in the Lyons  diligence. But when night came I hired post-horses under a feigned  name, and set off as fast as possible, and in a few days I was at  Milan.    My friend the General was absent: I wrote to him, and he hastened to  meet me. I confessed that I intended to try to obtain employment under  Napoleon.--\"You won't get it,\" said he; \"Napoleon has not ready money  enough to pay his body guard. A good many of my old officers have  joined him, and for themselves and their families they only receive  fifty, or perhaps sixty francs a month. They are in a state of  starvation and despair.\"--\"No matter; I love the Emperor, and come  what may, I will join him. Do tell me how I can soonest put to  sea.\"--\"The thing is not easy; there is no place from whence you can  sail, except only from Leghorn or from Genoa; and those two points are  under such close inspection, that you will be sure to be taken up, if  you are known to be a Bonapartist. You might slip through with greater  ease if you could pass for a tradesman of this town. I will try to get  you a passport, but I am afraid it will be a difficult job.\"--\"Besides,  there is another difficulty, which is still greater; _ma foi_! I can't  speak a dozen words of Italian.\"--\"Is it possible?\"--\"Yes, I am in  earnest.\"--\"And you would venture on such a scheme! are you  crazy?\"--\"Crazy or not, I will venture; but can I really embark no  where but at Leghorn or Genoa?\"--\"There are very many small ports on  the coast of Tuscany, but if you go to any of them you must stop till  there is an opportunity of getting out; and in the mean time you would  be under the _surveillance_ of the authorities, who are, one and all,  exceedingly ill-disposed towards the Emperor and his people. Perhaps  you might be able to embark immediately in the gulf of Spezzia at  Lerici; but, in order to get there, you must go through Genoa, and  along the shore; and then there is great reason to fear that you may  be snapped either by the Piedmontese carabineers, or by the new consul  at Genoa, who, according to what I hear, is quite outrageous. There is  another road through the mountains of Spezzia, but it has not been  used for a long time, and you would run the risk either of breaking  your neck, or of being knocked on the head.\"--\"No matter, if there is  no danger in the victory there is no glory in the triumph. That road  suits me; and to-morrow I will set out on my expedition.\"--\"Is your  passport all right?\"--\"I will go and get it marked for Lerici.\"--\"Another  piece of stupidity; don't you know that here you have to deal with our  implacable enemies, the Austrians, who will raise all kinds of  difficulties; but I know a Tedesco Colonel (in Italy an Austrian is  called a Tedesco), who will probably be able to do the needful for us:  we will ask him to come and dine with us. Business or quarrels can all  be settled with these gentry when they are feeding.\"    Our Tedesco Colonel really got my passport through the office. I left  my \"caleche\" and my baggage at Milan, and the next day I started in a  \"seggiola,\" a kind of a little cabriolet, in which you drive along at  an infernal rate. I travelled through cross roads till I came to the  foot of the mountains. As it was impossible to ascend them in a  wheeled carriage, I was compelled, though reluctantly, to separate  myself from my \"conducteur.\" I bought two horses, one for myself, and  the other for my new guide; this new guide could not speak a word of  French. I had taken care to provide myself with a pocket dictionary,  French and Italian; but I was completely ignorant, or at least very  nearly so, of the way either of pronouncing Italian words, or of  arranging them; and thus our conversation was reduced on both sides to  a few detached phrases, which were often mutually unintelligible.    We set out at break of day. About noon the snow began to fall, and we  had the greatest difficulty imaginable in reaching a hamlet, the name  whereof I have forgotten. The next day the weather became still more  wretched; my guide's horse foundered in the snow, and we lost two  hours in hauling him out again. My guide was an Italian, and, like all  Italians, he was full of superstition, and easily discouraged. He  considered this accident as a bad omen, and he wanted to turn back; I  could only conquer his repugnance by means of a double Napoleon d'or.  Scarcely had I given it to him when I felt the extent of my  imprudence; I was exciting his avarice, and perhaps exposing myself to  become his victim. As we advanced, the road became worse and worse; at  every step we encountered pits and holes, or the road was stopped by  rocks which had fallen in, and which forced us to scramble through new  paths. So much snow had fallen in the north of Italy, and particularly  in the district which we were then crossing, that even the muleteers  had deserted the mountains: and my guide, unable to discern the beaten  road, was compelled to make a survey at every step, lest we should  either lose ourselves, or else tumble down the precipices which  bordered our road of danger. The next day we arrived at Borcetto; the  perils which I had escaped taught me caution: I hired two more horses,  and another guide; and for this addition to my train, I paid out of  all reason. I then met with a custom-house officer, who either out of  kindness, or for the purpose of alarming me, I know not which, warned  me to be particularly on my guard in crossing \"la Size,\" a very lofty  and dangerous mountain, for he told me that it swarmed with robbers. I  put fresh priming in my pistols; I turned up my eyes toward Heaven to  implore its protection, and I set out. When we had proceeded half  way up the mountain, I was accosted by a soldier, who compelled me to  enter the guard-house, and to produce my passport. This post, which  had been lately established for the security of travellers, was  occupied by a subaltern and by six soldiers, who had all served in the  imperial army. They guessed by my looks that I had seen some service,  and, after a short conversation, they asked me to come in and warm  myself by drinking the health of the Emperor Napoleon. I refused at  first, lest I should be entrapped, but they insisted so frankly that I  was compelled to yield. On taking leave I gave them a twenty-franc  piece, in order to drink the health of Napoleon, and mine too; and I  begged them to recommend my guides to take care of me. The commandant  called the guides, and at the same time that he fired a volley of  oaths and curses, he declared that if any accident happened to me, he  would shoot them both on their return. My worthy military friends also  escorted me during a considerable distance, and we separated with  feelings which no one but a soldier can appreciate or understand.    We were to sleep at Pontremoli. Our halt retarded us, and night  overtook us. In order to shorten the distance, my guides led me by a  broad path which wound round the side of the mountain. The descent  was so steep that our horses came down every moment, and we ourselves  were obliged to slide along. I found myself at the foot of the  mountain in a spot which was so dark and dreary, that I fancied my  guides had conducted me thither in order to dispatch me. After having  groped along for some time, my guides stopped. The darkness and the  snow concealed the face of the country to such a degree, that they did  not know where they were, nor which way they ought to turn: their fear  became excessive; they prayed to all the Saints in heaven in their  turn: they shook each other by the hand, and embraced each other like  sailors on the point of being shipwrecked. My _sang froid_ did not  desert me; I took one of the horses which looked like an old roadster;  I dropped the bridle on his neck, and gave him a sound cut with my  whip; he started, I followed, and a few minutes afterwards, to the  inexpressible surprise, and also to the inexpressible satisfaction of  my guides, we found ourselves in the right road, and within half an  hour's ride of Pontremoli, where we arrived towards midnight.    From Pontremoli to Spezzia there was yet a journey of four-and-twenty  hours; and four-and-twenty hours on such roads as I had gone over  are equal to four-and-twenty centuries. But how great was my delight  on quitting Pontremoli, when, instead of the frozen rocks and deserts,  which I had crossed the eve before, I saw nothing as I looked around,  but valleys clothed with verdure, and enamelled with flowers; and  hills surrounded and crowned by"]]]
