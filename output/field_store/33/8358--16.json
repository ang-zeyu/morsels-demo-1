But there is considerable feeling yet among the Katies, that they should  get all the night work, and never be seen performing. They think that  their ancestor was the original inventor of this cheap substitute for  bird song. And it is made all the worse by a division among themselves.  Some say \"she did\" and some say \"she didn't.\" If you notice in early  August, they are nearly all shouting, \"Katy-did.\" Then by the end of the  month, \"Katy-didn't\" is stronger. In September it is still mixed. In  October their work is over, the chorus ended, but you hear an occasional  \"Katy-did\" and finally as late as Indian Summer, which is Hallowe'en, I  have heard the last of the fiddlers rasp out \"she did\"; and do it in  daytime, too, as though to flout the followers of Cicada. And, if the  last word be truth, as they say, we may consider it settled, that Katy  really and truly _did_. And yet I believe next year the same dispute  will arise, and we shall have the noisy argument all over again.    If you look at the portraits of Cicada, the Hotweather-bug or Locust,  and of the Katydid, you will not see their musical instruments very  plainly, but believe me they have them; and you can hear them any late  summer hot-weather time, in any part of the Eastern States and some  parts of southern Canada.    And now let me finish with a secret. Katy is not a lady at all, but a  he-one disguised in green silk stockings, and a green satin dress.      TALE 47    The Digger Wasp that Killed the Cicada    Strange things are done in the realm of Mother Carey; strange things and  cruel. At least so they seem to us, for we do not know the plan that is  behind them. We know only that sometimes love must be cruel. I am going  to tell you of a strange happening, that you may see any hot day in  August. And this is how it came about.    At that meeting in the woods when the Cicada and the Katydid undertook  to be musicians, while the birds were on strike, there was one strong  insect who gave off an angry \"_Bizz, Bizz_\" that sounded like \"_Scab,  Scab_.\" That was the big yellow-and-black Digger Wasp, the biggest of  the wasps, with a sting that is as bad as that of a baby rattlesnake.  And that very day she declared war on the Cicada and his kind. The  Katydids she could not touch, because the Wasp cannot see at night.    But the Cicada was easy to find. As soon as the day got hot, and that  awful buzzing began in the trees, the Big Digger got her sting ready,  and went booming along in the direction of the sound.    [Illustration: The Digger Wasp (life size)]    Now Mother Carey had given the Cicada bright eyes and strong wings, and  it was his own business to take care of himself; but he was so pleased  with his music that he never saw the fierce Digger Wasp, till she  charged on him. And before he could spread his wings, she had stabbed  him through.    His song died away in a few shrieks, and then the Cicada lay still. But  not dead, for the Digger had stuck her poison dagger into the nerve  centre, so that he was paralyzed and helpless, but still living.    Now the Digger set about a plan. She wanted to get that Cicada body into  her den, to feed her young ones with it. But the Cicada was bigger and  heavier than she was, so that she could not carry it. However, she was  bent on doing it, she got all ready, took tight hold with her claws,  then swooped from the tree, flying as strongly as she could, till the  weight of the Cicada brought her to the ground within fifty feet, while  the den was fully a hundred feet away. But the Wasp dragged the Cicada  up the trunk of another tree, then took another long sloping flight as  before. One more climb and skid down, brought her to her den--a hole in  a bank that she had dug out; that is why she is called the Digger Wasp.  The passage was a foot long and had a crook in the middle. At the end  was a round room an inch and a half high. Here the Digger left her  victim's body and right on its breast, to one side, laid an egg.    This hatched in two or three days, and began to feed on the Cicada. In a  week it had eaten the Cicada and grown to be a big fat grub. Then it  spun a cocoon, and made itself into a bundle-baby, resting all autumn  and all winter in that dark den.    But when the spring came with its glorious wakening up, great changes  came over the bundle-baby of the Digger. It threw off the cocoon and its  outer skin, and came forth from the gloom into the sunshine, a big  strong Digger Wasp with a sting of its own, and a deadly feud with all  screaming Cicadas. Although it never saw its mother, or got any lessons  from her, it goes after the buzzing hotweather-bugs, when August comes,  and treats them exactly as she did.      TALE 48    How the Indian Summer Came    Wahkonda, the Great Spirit, the Ruler of the World, had found pleasure  the whole summer long in making mountains, lakes, and forests. Then when  the autumn came, and the leaves fell from the trees, He lighted His pipe  and sat down to look over the things He had made.    As He did so, the north wind arose for Cold Time was coming, and blew  the smoke and ashes of the pipe into His face. Then He said: \"Cease your  blowing, all ye winds, until I have finished smoking.\" So, of course,  there was dead calm.    Wahkonda smoked for ten days, and during all that time there were no  clouds in the sky, for there was no wind to bring them; there was  unbroken, calm sunny weather. But neither was there any wind to carry  off the smoke, so it hung, as the teepee smoke hangs at sunrise, and it  drifted over the valleys and forests in a blue haze.    Then at last when the Great Spirit finished His smoke and His  meditation, He emptied out His pipe. That was the signal, the north wind  broke loose, and came howling down from the hills, driving the leaves  before it, and warning all wild things to be ready, for soon there would  be winter in the woods.    And it hath been so ever since. When the leaves have fallen and before  yet the Ice-king is here, there come, for a little while, the calm  dreamy days, when the Great Spirit is smoking His pipe, and the smoke is  on the land. The Red-men call them the Smoking Days, but we call it  Indian Summer.          THINGS TO SEE IN WINTERTIME    [Illustration: The North Star or Home Star]          Things to See in Wintertime      TALE 49    The North Star, or the Home Star    If you are going to be a Woodcrafter, you must begin by knowing the  North Star, because that is the star which will show you the way home,  if you get lost in the woods at night. That is why the Indians call it  the \"Home Star.\"    But first, I must tell you how it came to be, and the story begins a  long, long time ago.    In those far-off days, we are told, there were two wonderful hunters,  one named Orion, and the other named Booetes (Bo-o-tees). Orion hunted  everything and I shall have to leave him for another story. Booetes was  an ox-driver and only hunted bears to save his cattle. One day he went  after a Mother Bear, that had one little cub.    [Illustration: The Pappoose on the Squaw's Back]    He chased them up to the top of a mountain so high, that they leaped off  into the sky, and just as they were going, Booetes shot his arrows after  them. His very first arrow hit the Little Bear in the tail--they had  long tails in those days--and pinned him to the sky. There he has hung  ever since, swinging round and round, on the arrow in his tail, while  his mother runs bawling around him, with Booetes and his dogs chasing  her. He shot arrows into her tail, which was long and curved, into her  body, and into her shoulder. Seven big arrows he shot, and there they  are yet, in the form of a dipper pointing always to the cub who is  called the \"Little Bear.\" The shining head of the big arrow in the end  of the Little Bear's tail is called the North Star or Pole Star. You can  always tell which is the North Star, by the two Pointers; these are the  two bright stars that make the outer side of the Dipper on the Big  Bear's shoulder. A line drawn through them, points out the North Star.    The Dipper, that is the Big Bear, goes round and round the Pole  Star, once in about twenty-four hours; so that sometimes the Pointers are  over, sometimes under, to left or to right; but always pointing out the  Pole Star or North Star.    This star shows nearly the true north; and, knowing that, a traveller  can find his way in any strange country, so long as he can see this  friendly Home Star.      TALE 50    The Pappoose on the Squaw's Back    Now that you know how the Bears and the Big Dipper came, you should know  the Indian story of the Old Squaw.    First find the bright star that is at the bend of the Dipper handle.  This is called the \"Old Squaw\"; on her back is a tiny star that they  call \"The Pappoose.\"    As soon as an Indian boy is old enough to understand, his mother takes  him out into the night when it is calm and clear, and without any moon  or any bright lights near, and says, \"My child, yonder is the Old Squaw,  the second of the seven stars; she is going over the top of the hill; on  her back she carries her pappoose. Tell me, my child, can you see the  pappoose?\"    [Illustration: Orion Fighting the Bull]    Then the little redskin gazes, and from his mother's hand he takes two  pebbles, a big one and a little one, and he sets them together on her  palm, to show how the two stars seem to him. When the mother is sure  that he did see them clearly, she rejoices. She goes to the fire and  drops a pinch of tobacco into it, for incense to carry her message, then  looking toward the sky she says: \"Great Spirit, I thank Thee that my  child has the eyes of a hunter.\"           *       *       *       *       *    These things are not new, O Woodcrafter.

Henry Fawcett, M.P., late Postmaster-General,  who died in 1884.    =The Chapter House=, which is entered from the eastern walk of the  cloisters, dates probably from the time of Edward the First; later it  may be, but certainly not earlier than the commencement of his reign,  as, during certain excavations for underpinning the walls in 1854,  several pennies of that king were found below its foundations. The  architecture is somewhat later in style than that of the cloisters,  and if it be not, as its admirers claim, the most beautiful in  England, it has few rivals. Like Westminster, Wells, and other English  examples, except York and Southwell, it has a central pillar, from  which the groining of the roof springs gracefully in harmonious  lines. A raised bench of stone runs round the interior. At its back,  forty-nine niches of a canopied arcade borne on slight Purbeck marble  shafts mark out as many seats. They are apportioned as follows: those  at each side of the entrance to the Chancellor and Treasurer  respectively, the rest to the Bishop, Dean, Arch-deacons, and other  members of the chapter.       [Illustration: THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE CHAPTER HOUSE.]       [Illustration: BOSSES FROM THE CHAPTER HOUSE ROOF.]    The plan of the building is octagonal, about fifty-eight feet in  diameter and fifty-two feet in height. Each side has a large fanlight  window with traceried head. Below these windows and above the canopies  of the seats is a very remarkable series of bas-reliefs, noticed more  fully later on. The bosses of the roof are somewhat elaborately  carved; one north of the west doorway has groups of figures on it,  apparently intended to represent armourers, musicians, and  apothecaries, possibly commemorating guilds who were benefactors to  the building; the others have foliage chiefly with grotesque monsters.  On the base of the central pillar is a series of carvings taken  probably from one of the many books of fables so popular in the middle  ages. These were reproduced from the originals, which are preserved  in the cloisters.       [Illustration: DETAILS OF SCULPTURES IN THE CHAPTER HOUSE.     _From Photographs by Catherine Weed Ward._]    The quatrefoil over the doorway has an empty niche, and it is not  possible to say with certainty whether it was originally filled by a  crucifix, as Mr. Mackenzie Walcott infers from the symbols of the  Evangelists in the angles of the panel; or, with a seated figure of  our Lord in majesty; or, as a third archaeologist has suggested, a  coronation of the Virgin. Filling the voussoirs of the arch of the  doorway are fourteen small niches containing subjects from the  Psychomachia of Prudentius, the Battle of the Virtues against the  Vices. The figures are not easily identified, but Mr. Burges, whose  \"Iconography of the Chapter House\" is the most important monograph on  the subject, suggests that on the right-hand side the figures in the  third niche from the top appear to represent Concord triumphing over  Discord; in the sixth, Temperance is pouring liquor down the throat of  Intemperance; on the seventh, Fortitude tramples on Terror, who cuts  her own throat. On the left hand in the first niche Faith is trampling  on Infidelity; in the second, a Virtue covers a Vice with her cloak,  while the Vice embraces her knees with one hand and stabs her with a  sword held in the other. This incident is taken from Prudentius:  \"Discord by stealth wounds Concord; she is taken and killed by\" Faith,  which latter incident may be represented in the next compartment. In  the fourth niche, Truth pulls out Falsehood's tongue; in the fifth,  Modesty scourges Lust; in the sixth, Generosity pours coin into the  throat of Avarice. To quote the words of the author from whom these  interpretations are derived: \"These sculptures are of the very highest  class of art, and infinitely superior to any work in the chapter  house; the only defect is the size of the heads: probably this was  intentional on the part of the artist. The intense life and movement  of the figures are worthy of special study.\" These allegories are  common in paintings and sculptures of this period; at Canterbury the  same subjects are incised on the pavement that surrounds the shrine of  St. Thomas a Becket.    On the spandrils of the continuous arcade, sculptures in high relief  once restored as far as possible in the original colours are now again  scraped clean, and with the new heads to the figures look so modern  that it is hard to believe they are contemporary with the building  they adorn, yet since on the whole the restoration has been  faithfully accomplished they may be studied as peculiarly valuable  examples of early mediaeval sculpture, showing certain naive qualities  that raise them far above the usual level of contemporary work.

Some diaper wall painting, shown in the  photograph reproduced here, which until lately decorated the back of  the arcade is now entirely cleaned off. The tiles of the floor have  been reproduced from the designs of the original Norman pavement. The  vaulted roof is re-painted in exact accordance with its original  design. The marble shafts of the arcade are re-polished, and the  central shaft has also been re-worked to a smooth surface. Gilding has  been applied freely to the bosses of the roof and the capitals of the  pillars. The ancient table, shown in the engraving, has also been  restored; it is a very interesting specimen of early decorated  furniture.

THE CATHEDRAL PRECINCTS.      The common practice of writers who are describing any one of our more  important cathedrals is to declare that altogether it may be fairly  called the most beautiful. So great is the fascination exercised by  continual study of a single mediaeval building which has escaped  destruction, or over-restoration, that such a statement may be  advanced in all good faith. In claiming, however, that the cloisters  of Salisbury are on the whole the most beautiful in England, it is  merely re-asserting what many critics of Gothic architecture have  already decided to be true. The cloisters of Gloucester are far  richer, the space they cover at Wells (like Salisbury, not a monastic  establishment) is greater, and in other details these may not be the  finest. But, as a whole, their beautiful proportion and the general  symmetry of their design make them worthy adjuncts to a building which  is pre-eminent for these special qualities.    Situated, according to the usual custom, on the south-west side of the  cathedral, with their western wall in a line with its west front, they  are exceedingly picturesque. Even so far back as the time of Leland,  we find him declaring that \"the cloister on the south side of the  church is one of the largest and most magnificent in Britain.\" Yet, as  a recent critic has observed, from a purely technical point of view,  there is \"too great a mass of blank wall above the arcade.\" The green  sward of the large garth, 140 feet square, with its covered walks, 181  feet long, on "]]]
