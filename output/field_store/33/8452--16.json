Agriculture    boomed in 2003 with the end of a four-year drought, but drought    conditions returned for the southern half of the country in 2004.    Despite the progress of the past few years, Afghanistan remains    extremely poor, landlocked, and highly dependent on foreign aid,    farming, and trade with neighboring countries. It will probably take    the remainder of the decade and continuing donor aid and attention    to raise Afghanistan's living standards up from its current status    among the lowest in the world. Much of the population continues to    suffer from shortages of housing, clean water, electricity, medical    care, and jobs, but the Afghan government and international donors    remain committed to improving access to these basic necessities by    prioritizing infrastructure development, education, housing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2759"],[0,"The Man in the Iron Mask (#15)"],[1,"ure.\"    \"It was not Loret who said so, my friend.\"    \"Well, then, whoever said so, 'tis the same to me! And so your  _divertissement_ is called the 'Facheux?' Well, can you make _heureux_  rhyme with _facheux?_\"    \"If obliged, yes.\"    \"And even with _capriceux_.\"    \"Oh, no, no.\"    \"It would be hazardous, and yet why so?\"    \"There is too great a difference in the cadences.\"    \"I was fancying,\" said La Fontaine, leaving Moliere for Loret--\"I was  fancying--\"    \"What were you fancying?\" said Loret, in the middle of a sentence. \"Make  haste.\"    \"You are writing the prologue to the 'Facheux,' are you not?\"    \"No! _mordieu!_ it is Pelisson.\"    \"Ah, Pelisson,\" cried La Fontaine, going over to him, \"I was fancying,\"  he continued, \"that the nymph of Vaux--\"    \"Ah, beautiful!\" cried Loret. \"The nymph of Vaux! thank you, La  Fontaine; you have just given me the two concluding verses of my paper.\"    \"Well, if you can rhyme so well, La Fontaine,\" said Pelisson, \"tell me  now in what way you would begin my prologue?\"    \"I should say, for instance, 'Oh! nymph, who--' After 'who' I should  place a verb in the second person singular of the present indicative;  and should go on thus: 'this grot profound.'\"    \"But the verb, the verb?\" asked Pelisson.    \"To admire the greatest king of all kings round,\" continued La Fontaine.    \"But the verb, the verb,\" obstinately insisted Pelisson. \"This second  person singular of the present indicative?\"    \"Well, then; quittest:    \"Oh, nymph, who quittest now this grot profound, To admire the greatest  king of all kings round.\"    \"You would not put 'who quittest,' would you?\"    \"Why not?\"    \"'Quittest,' after 'you who'?\"    \"Ah! my dear fellow,\" exclaimed La Fontaine, \"you are a shocking  pedant!\"    \"Without counting,\" said Moliere, \"that the second verse, 'king of all  kings round,' is very weak, my dear La Fontaine.\"    \"Then you see clearly I am nothing but a poor creature,--a shuffler, as  you said.\"    \"I never said so.\"    \"Then, as Loret said.\"    \"And it was not Loret either; it was Pelisson.\"    \"Well, Pelisson was right a hundred times over. But what annoys me more  than anything, my dear Moliere, is, that I fear we shall not have our  Epicurean dresses.\"    \"You expected yours, then, for the _fete?_\"    \"Yes, for the _fete_, and then for after the _fete_. My housekeeper told  me that my own is rather faded.\"    \"_Diable!_ your housekeeper is right; rather more than faded.\"    \"Ah, you see,\" resumed La Fontaine, \"the fact is, I left it on the floor  in my room, and my cat--\"    \"Well, your cat--\"    \"She made her nest upon it, which has rather changed its color.\"    Moliere burst out laughing; Pelisson and Loret followed his example. At  this juncture, the bishop of Vannes appeared, with a roll of plans and  parchments under his arm. As if the angel of death had chilled all gay  and sprightly fancies--as if that wan form had scared away the Graces  to whom Xenocrates sacrificed--silence immediately reigned through the  study, and every one resumed his self-possession and his pen. Aramis  distributed the notes of invitation, and thanked them in the name of  M. Fouquet. \"The superintendent,\" he said, \"being kept to his room by  business, could not come and see them, but begged them to send him some  of the fruits of their day's work, to enable him to forget the fatigue  of his labor in the night.\"    At these words, all settled down to work. La Fontaine placed himself at  a table, and set his rapid pen an endless dance across the smooth white  vellum; Pelisson made a fair copy of his prologue; Moliere contributed  fifty fresh verses, with which his visit to Percerin had inspired him;  Loret, an article on the marvelous _fetes_ he predicted; and Aramis,  laden with his booty like the king of the bees, that great black drone,  decked with purple and gold, re-entered his apartment, silent and  busy. But before departing, \"Remember, gentlemen,\" said he, \"we leave  to-morrow evening.\"    \"In that case, I must give notice at home,\" said Moliere.    \"Yes; poor Moliere!\" said Loret, smiling; \"he loves his home.\"    \"'_He_ loves,' yes,\" replied Moliere, with his sad, sweet smile. \"'He  loves,' that does not mean, they love _him_.\"    \"As for me,\" said La Fontaine, \"they love me at Chateau Thierry, I am  very sure.\"    Aramis here re-entered after a brief disappearance.    \"Will any one go with me?\" he asked. \"I am going by Paris, after having  passed a quarter of an hour with M. Fouquet. I offer my carriage.\"    \"Good,\" said Moliere, \"I accept it. I am in a hurry.\"    \"I shall dine here,\" said Loret. \"M. de Gourville has promised me some  craw-fish.\"    \"He has promised me some whitings. Find a rhyme for that, La Fontaine.\"    Aramis went out laughing, as only he could laugh, and Moliere followed  him. They were at the bottom of the stairs, when La Fontaine opened the  door, and shouted out:      \"He has promised us some whitings, In return for these our writings.\"    The shouts of laughter reached the ears of Fouquet at the moment Aramis  opened the door of the study. As to Moliere, he had undertaken to  order the horses, while Aramis went to exchange a parting word with the  superintendent. \"Oh, how they are laughing there!\" said Fouquet, with a  sigh.    \"Do you not laugh, monseigneur?\"    \"I laugh no longer now, M. d'Herblay. The _fete_ is approaching; money  is departing.\"    \"Have I not told you that was my business?\"    \"Yes, you promised me millions.\"    \"You shall have them the day after the king's _entree_ into Vaux.\"    Fouquet looked closely at Aramis, and passed the back of his icy hand  across his moistened brow. Aramis perceived that the superintendent  either doubted him, or felt he was powerless to obtain the money. How  could Fouquet suppose that a poor bishop, ex-abbe, ex-musketeer, could  find any?    \"Why doubt me?\" said Aramis. Fouquet smiled and shook his head.    \"Man of little faith!\" added the bishop.    \"My dear M. d'Herblay,\" answered Fouquet, \"if I fall--\"    \"Well; if you 'fall'?\"    \"I shall, at least, fall from such a height, that I shall shatter myself  in falling.\" Then giving himself a shake, as though to escape from  himself, \"Whence came you,\" said he, \"my friend?\"    \"From Paris--from Percerin.\"    \"And what have you been doing at Percerin's, for I suppose you attach no  great importance to our poets' dresses?\"    \"No; I went to prepare a surprise.\"    \"Surprise?\"    \"Yes; which you are going to give to the king.\"    \"And will it cost much?\"    \"Oh! a hundred pistoles you will give Lebrun.\"    \"A painting?--Ah! all the better! And what is this painting to  represent?\"    \"I will tell you; then at the same time, whatever you may say or think  of it, I went to see the dresses for our poets.\"    \"Bah! and they will be rich and elegant?\"    \"Splendid! There will be few great monseigneurs with so good. People  will see the difference there is between the courtiers of wealth and  those of friendship.\"    \"Ever generous and grateful, dear prelate.\"    \"In your school.\"    Fouquet grasped his hand. \"And where are you going?\" he said.    \"I am off to Paris, when you shall have given a certain letter.\"    \"For whom?\"    \"M. de Lyonne.\"    \"And what do you want with Lyonne?\"    \"I wish to make him sign a _lettre de cachet_.\"    \"'_Lettre de cachet!_' Do you desire to put somebody in the Bastile?\"    \"On the contrary--to let somebody out.\"    \"And who?\"    \"A poor devil--a youth, a lad who has been Bastiled these ten years, for  two Latin verses he made against the Jesuits.\"    \"'Two Latin verses!' and, for 'two Latin verses,' the miserable being  has been in prison for ten years!\"    \"Yes!\"    \"And has committed no other crime?\"    \"Beyond this, he is as innocent as you or I.\"    \"On your word?\"    \"On my honor!\"    \"And his name is--\"    \"Seldon.\"    \"Yes.--But it is too bad. You knew this, and you never told me!\"    \"'Twas only yesterday his mother applied to me, monseigneur.\"    \"And the woman is poor!\"    \"In the deepest misery.\"    \"Heaven,\" said Fouquet, \"sometimes bears with such injustice on earth,  that I hardly wonder there are wretches who doubt of its existence.  Stay, M. d'Herblay.\" And Fouquet, taking a pen, wrote a few rapid lines  to his colleague Lyonne. Aramis took the letter and made ready to go.    \"Wait,\" said Fouquet. He opened his drawer, and took out ten government  notes which were there, each for a thousand francs. \"Stay,\" he said;  \"set the son at liberty, and give this to the mother; but, above all, do  not tell her--\"    \"What, monseigneur?\"    \"That she is ten thousand livres richer than I. She would say I am but  a poor superintendent! Go! and I pray that God will bless those who are  mindful of his poor!\"    \"So also do I pray,\" replied Aramis, kissing Fouquet's hand.    And he went out quickly, carrying off the letter for Lyonne and the  notes for Seldon's mother, and taking up Moliere, who was beginning to  lose patience.    Chapter VII. Another Supper at the Bastile.    Seven o'clock sounded from the great clock of the Bastile, that famous  clock, which, like all the accessories of the state prison, the very use  of which is a torture, recalled to the prisoners' minds the destination  of every hour of their punishment. The time-piece of the Bastile,  adorned with figures, like most of the clocks of the period, represented  St. Peter in bonds. It was the supper hour of the unfortunate captives.  The doors, grating on their enormous hinges, opened for the passage of  the baskets and trays of provisions, the abundance and the delicacy of  which, as M. de Baisemeaux has himself taught us, was regulated by  the condition in life of the prisoner. We understand on this head  the theories of M. de Baisemeaux, sovereign dispenser of gastronomic  delicacies, head cook of the royal fortress, whose trays, full-laden,  were ascending the steep staircases, carrying some consolation to the  prisoners in the shape of"]]]
