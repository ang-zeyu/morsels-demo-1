Fine lesson  for them to keep sober.\"    Don looked at the men with disgust.  A few moments before he felt  indignant, and full of commiseration for them; but the bluff man's words  had swept all that away.    Then, crossing to where the man stood by the lanthorn-bearer, Don laid  his hand upon his arm.    \"You are not going to keep us, sir?\" he said quietly.  \"My mother and my  uncle will be very uneasy at my absence, and Jem--our man, has a young  wife.\"    \"No, no; can't listen to you, my lad,\" said the bluff man; \"it's very  hard, I know, but the king's ships must be manned--and boyed,\" he added  with a laugh.    \"But my mother?\"    \"Yes, I'm sorry for your mother, but you're too old to fret about her.  We shall make a man of you, and that chap's young wife will have to wait  till he comes back.\"    \"But you will let me send a message to them at home?\"    \"To come and fetch you away, my lad?  Well, hardly.  We don't give that  facility to pressed men to get away.  There, be patient; we will not  keep you in this hole long.\"    He glanced at the four sleeping men, and turned slowly to go, giving Don  a nod of the head, but, as he neared the door he paused.    \"Not very nice for a lad like you,\" he said, not unkindly.  \"Here, bring  these two out, my lads; we'll stow them in the warehouse.  Rather hard  on the lad to shut him up with these swine.  Here, come along.\"    A couple of the press-gang seized Don by the arms, and a couple more  paid Jem Wimble the same attention, after which they were led up a  flight of steps, the door was banged to and bolted, and directly after  they were all standing on the floor of what had evidently been used as a  tobacco warehouse, where the lanthorn light showed a rough step ladder  leading up to another floor.    \"Where shall we put 'em, sir?\" said a sailor.    \"Top floor and make fast,\" said the bluff man.    \"But you will let me send word home?\" began Don.    \"I shall send you back into that lock-up place below, and perhaps put  you in irons,\" said the man sternly.  \"Be content with what I am doing  for you.  Now then, up with you, quick!--\"    There was nothing for it but to obey, and with a heavy heart Don  followed the man with the lanthorn as he led the way to the next floor,  Jem coming next, and a guard of two well-armed men and their bluff  superior closing up the rear.    The floor they reached was exactly like the one they had left, and they  ascended another step ladder to the next, and then to the next.    \"There's a heap of bags and wrappers over yonder to lie down on, my  lads,\" said the bluff man.  \"There, go to sleep and forget your  troubles.  You shall have some prog in the morning.  Now, my men,  sharp's the word.\"    They had ascended from floor to floor through trap-doors, and as Don  looked anxiously at his captors, the man who carried the lanthorn  stooped and raised a heavy door from the floor and held it and the light  as his companions descended, following last and drawing down the heavy  trap over his head.    The door closed with a loud clap, a rusty bolt was shot, and then, as  the two prisoners stood in the darkness listening, there was a rasping  noise, and then a crash, which Don interpreted to mean that the heavy  step ladder had been dragged away and half laid, half thrown upon the  floor below.  Then the sounds died away.    \"This is a happy sort o' life, Mas' Don,\" said Jem, breaking the  silence.  \"What's to be done next?  Oh!  My head, my head!\"    \"I don't know, Jem,\" said Don despondently.  \"It's enough to make one  wish one was dead.\"    \"Dead!  Wish one was dead, sir?  Oh, come.  It's bad enough to be  knocked down and have the headache.  Dead!  No, no.  Where did he say  them bags was?\"    \"I don't know, Jem.\"    \"Well, let's look.  I want to lie down and have a sleep.\"    \"Sleep?  At a time like this!\"    \"Why not, sir?  I'm half asleep now.  Can't do anything better as I  see.\"    \"Jem,\" said Don passionately, \"we're being punished for all our  discontent and folly, and it seems more than I can bear.\"    \"But we must bear it, sir.  That's what you've got to do when you're  punished.  Don't take on, sir.  P'r'aps, it won't seem so bad when it  gets light.  Here, help me find them bags he talked about.\"    Don was too deep in thought, for the face of his mother was before him,  and he seemed to see the agony she suffered on his account.    \"Justly punished,\" he kept muttering; \"justly punished, and now it is  too late--too late.\"    \"Here y'are, Mas' Don,\" cried Jem; \"lots of 'em, and I can't help it, I  must lie down, for my head feels as if it was going to tumble off.\"    Don heard him make a scuffling noise, as if he were very busy moving  some sacks.    \"There!\"  Jem cried at last; \"that's about it.  Now, Mas' Don, I've made  you up a tidy bed; come and lie down.\"    \"No, Jem, no; I'm not sleepy.\"    \"Then I must,\" muttered Jem; and after a little more scuffling noise all  was still for a few minutes, after which there was a regular heavy  breathing, which told that the great trouble he was in had not been  sufficient to keep Jem Wimble awake.    Don stood for some time in the darkness, but by degrees a wretched  feeling of weariness came over him, and he sat down painfully upon the  floor, drawing his knees up to his chin, embracing them, and laying his  head upon them.    He wanted to think of his position, of his folly, and of the trouble  which it had brought upon him.  Jem's heavy breathing came regularly  from somewhere to his left, and he found himself, as he crouched  together there in the darkness, envying the poor fellow, much as he was  injured.    \"But then he has not so much on his mind as I have,\" thought Don.  \"Once  let me get clear away from here, how different I will be.\"        CHAPTER THIRTEEN.    HOW TO ESCAPE?    _Rumble_!  _Bump_!    Don started and stared, for something had shaken him as if a sudden blow  had been given against the floor.    What did it all mean?  Where was he?  What window was that through which  the sun shone brightly, and why was he in that rough loft, in company  with a man lying asleep on some sacks?    Memory filled up the vacuum directly, and he knew that his head was  aching, and that he had been fast asleep.    _Crash_!    That was a bolt shot back, and the noise which awakened him must have  been the big step ladder placed against the beam beneath the trap-door.    As Don watched he saw the trap, like a square piece of the floor, rise  up slowly, and a rough, red face appear, framed in hair.    \"Ship ahoy!\" shouted the owner of the face.  \"What cheer, messmates?  Want your hot water?\"    Just then the man, whose hands were out of sight, and who had kept on  pushing up the trap-door with his head, gave it a final thrust, and the  door fell over with a loud _flap_, which made Jem Wimble sit up, with  his face so swollen and bruised that his eyes were half-closed; and this  and his dirty face gave him an aspect that was more ludicrous than  strange.    \"What's the matter?\" he said sharply.  \"Who are you?  I--where--was--to  me.  Have I been a-dreaming?  No: we're pressed!\"    \"Pressed you are, my lads; and Bosun Jones has sent you up some hot  slops and soft tack.  There you are.  Find your own tablecloth and  silliver spoons.\"    He placed a large blue jug before them, in which was some steaming  compound, covered by a large breakfast cup, stuck in the mouth of the  jug, while on a plate was a fair-sized pile of bread and butter.    \"There you are, messmates; say your grace and fall to.\"    \"Look here,\" said Don quickly.  \"You know we were taken by the  press-gang last night?\"    \"Do I know?  Why, didn't I help?\"    \"Oh!\" ejaculated Don, with a look of revulsion, which he tried to  conceal.  \"Look here,\" he said; \"if you will take a message for me to my  mother, in Jamaica Street, you shall have a guinea.\"    \"Well, that's handsome, anyhow,\" said the man, laughing.  \"What am I to  say to the old lady?\"    \"That we have been seized by the press-gang, and my uncle is to try and  get us away.\"    \"That all?\"    \"Yes, that's all.  Will you go?\"    \"Hadn't you better have your breakfuss?\"    \"Breakfast?  No,\" said Don.  \"I can't eat.\"    \"Better.  Keep you going, my lad.\"    \"Will you take my message?\"    \"No, I won't.\"    \"You shall have two guineas.\"    \"Where are they?\"    \"My mother will gladly give them to you.\"    \"Dessay she will.\"    \"And you will go?\"    \"Do you know what a bosun's mate is, my lad?\"    \"I?  No.  I know nothing about the sea.\"    \"You will afore long.  Well, I'll tell you; bosun's mate's a gentleman  kep' aboard ship to scratch the crew's backs.\"    \"You are laughing at me,\" cried Don angrily.    \"Not a bit of it, my lad.  If I was to do what you want, I should be  tied up to-morrow, and have my back scratched.\"    \"Flogged?\"    \"That's it.\"    \"For doing a kind act?  For saving my poor mother from trouble and  anxiety?\"    \"For not doing my dooty, my lad.  There, a voyage or two won't hurt you.  Why, I was a pressed man, and look at me.\"    \"Main-top ahoy!  Are you coming down?\" came from below.    \"Ay, ay, sir!\" shouted the sailor.    \"Wasn't that the man who had us shut up here?\" cried Don.    \"To be sure: Bosun Jones,\" said the man, running to the trap and  beginning to descend.    \"You'll take my message?\"    \"Nay, not I,\" said the man, shaking his head.  \"There, eat your  breakfuss, and keep your head to the wind, my lads.\"    _Bang_!    The door was shut heavily and the rusty bolt shot.  Then the two  prisoners listened to the descending footsteps and to the murmur of  voices from below, after which Don looked across the steaming jug at  Jem, and Jem returned the stare.    \"Mornin', Mas' Don,\" he said.  \"Rum game, arn't it?\"    \"Do you think he'll take my message, Jem?\"    \"Not a bit on it, sir.  You may take your oath o' that.\"    \"Will they take us aboard ship?\"    \"Yes, sir, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21324"],[0,"Recollections of Old Liverpool (#15)"],[1,"r, 1805, the second duel was fought, which created as  great a sensation as that between Mr. Sparling and Mr. Grayson, in the  previous year.  In this encounter the principals were Colonel Bolton and  Major Brooks, the same party who had caused the mischief in the  previously-mentioned affair.    The origin of the quarrel arose in this way:--Colonel Bolton, who had  raised a regiment of volunteers, in 1803, which he had entirely clothed,  armed, and equipped, mustering ten companies of sixty men each, was held  in high respect and possessed great influence with government.  On the  death of Mr. Bryan Blundell, who held the appointment of Customs Jerker,  Colonel Bolton obtained the vacant office for Major Brooks, who had been  formerly in the Lancashire Militia.  After enjoying this place for a  time, Major Brooks applied for an increase of salary.  His application  was referred to the West India Association, of which Colonel Bolton was  President, to report upon whether an increase in the pay of the office  was desirable or deserved.  The Association reported adverse to Major  Brooks' application.  He immediately, publicly, and in the most  disgraceful manner, accused Colonel Bolton with being the cause of this  refusal, as he had learnt that the Colonel had said that \"700 pounds a  year was quite income enough for a comparatively young, unmarried man.\"  Major Brooks, forgetting that Colonel Bolton's friendship and influence  had obtained for him, in the first instance, his appointment, did his  utmost to force his benefactor into collision with him, and to such an  extent was this annoyance carried, that at length a hostile meeting was  arranged between the parties.  As a soldier and gentleman, Colonel Bolton  could no longer keep quiet.  Major Brooks possessed, unfortunately for  himself, a great amount of irritable vanity and pugnacity.  He had been  \"out,\" as it was then called, not long before with Captain Carmichael,  whose trial by court-martial I have just detailed, upon some point of  difference in military discipline.  The meeting took place on Bootle  Sands, and, to show Major Brooks's temper, on Captain Carmichael firing  in the air, he exclaimed: \"D--- it, why don't you fire at me--we did not  come here for child's play!\"  In those days duelling was very prevalent,  and small words brought out pistols and coffins for two.    The first meeting between Colonel Bolton and Major Brooks was to have  come off on the 20th December, 1804, at a place called Miller's Dam, off  the Aigburth-road, which, if I recollect rightly, was a small creek which  ran up to a mill--long and long ago swept away.  The circumstance of the  quarrel, however, having by some means got abroad, the authorities  interposed and both gentlemen were arrested on their way to the  rendezvous.  They were both bound over, in very heavy penalties, to keep  the peace to all and sundry of His Majesty's subjects, and each other in  particular, for twelve calendar months.  Brooks, on being arrested,  exhibited the utmost rage and virulence, and expressed himself in strong  language against the Colonel, accusing him roundly of being the cause of  the arrest, and the interference they had met with.  There was not word  of truth in this charge, Colonel Bolton, though forced into the matter,  according to the laws of honour, kept the meeting a secret, and it was  afterwards actually proved that the secret of the meeting oozed out from  one of Major Brooks' own friends.    During the twelve months the two gentlemen were bound over, Brooks let  slip no opportunity of insulting Colonel Bolton, as far as he dared  without coming into actual collision.  He said he was the cause of their  meeting being interrupted, although he had been frequently assured of the  truth.  As the twelve months were about to expire, Major Brooks increased  his violence.  On the day the bond ceased to have effect, the Major,  meeting Colonel Bolton walking with Colonel Earle past the shop, kept at  present by Mr. Allender, in Castle-street, then and there publicly again  insulted him, and called him by a name which no gentleman could put up  with.  A challenge was the consequence.  The report of the disturbance  soon reached the Exchange, and the authorities again stepped forward to  prevent hostilities.  Colonel Bolton was again arrested and bound over,  and Major Brooks was taken into custody.  The latter denied the right of  the authorities to arrest him, asserting that he had done nothing of  sufficient weight to break his bond, and that he could not be again bound  over until the year of bondage had expired.  The Major was some hours in  custody, but was at length released without promising anything.  He was  no sooner at liberty than he sent a friend to Colonel Bolton, who  consented to a meeting for that very afternoon.  This was on the 20th of  December, 1805.  The place of rendezvous on this occasion was in a field  at the foot of Love-lane (now called Fairclough-lane), which was skirted  by it.  The exact spot of meeting was in a field about half-way between  the present Boundary-street (then a narrow lane with hedges) and St.  Jude's Church.  It was near Fielding's nursery ground, which occupied the  land now used as a timber-yard.  It was quite dark when the combatants  arrived.  Major Brooks was accompanied Mr. Forbes.  Mr. Park, surgeon,  who resided at the corner of Newington-bridge, was taken up by Colonel  Bolton on his way to the place of meeting in his carriage.  Mr. Harris  was Colonel Bolton's second.  When the parties got over into the field it  was found that they could not see to load the pistols.  It would then be  about six o'clock.  Candles were therefore procured to enable them to  complete the necessary arrangements.    As soon as the combatants had taken the places allotted to them, Colonel  Bolton observed that, according to the laws of honour and duelling, the  Major was entitled to fire first.  To this the Major assented, and fired  immediately, the shot passing harmlessly by the Colonel, who then fired  in his turn, hitting Major Brooks in the right eye.  The Major instantly  fell and died.  Colonel Bolton was hurried off and remained in  concealment for a short time.  It was said that the firing of the pistols  was heard in Major Brooks' house at the corner of Daulby-street.  An  inquiry was held, when a verdict of wilful murder was found, but in  consequence of the strong recommendations of Major Brooks's friends,  admitting that he was entirely to blame, and that his dreadful fate was  entirely brought on by himself, the matter passed over without further  notice, everyone admitting that Colonel Bolton had conducted himself with  the utmost forbearance as well as courage, and that he deserved the  highest encomiums for his gentlemanly and straightforward behaviour  throughout this most painful affair.          CHAPTER V.      Some five years previous to this event, about the month of June, 1800, a  circumstance occurred which created a great sensation in the town, and  occupied public attention in a most remarkable degree.  It seems rather  out of chronological order to go back five years; but the reader who  favours me with his attention must be content to obtain my information as  I can impart it.  My head is not so clear as it used to be in the  arrangement of such matters.    In the year mentioned there was a merchant established in Liverpool of  the name of Wainwright, who was one of the actors in what nearly proved  to be a tragedy.  At a place called Tunstall, near Burslem, in  Staffordshire, resided an earthenware manufacturer named Theophilus  Smith.  This Smith was in difficulties and his affairs were in much  disorder.  His creditors were hostile to him, and he for some time had  been endeavouring to obtain a settlement with them.  Amongst other  creditors was Mr. Wainwright.  He, however, was not one of the hostile  party, but was very well-disposed towards Mr. Smith.  One day, in the  month of June, Mr. Wainwright received an anonymous letter, requesting  him to meet the writer at a small public-house near the \"Olympic Circus,\"  which was a temporary place of amusement erected in Christian-street,  then beginning to be built upon (the Adelphi Theatre in Christian-street  succeeded the Circus--in fact, this place of amusement was called \"the  Circus\" for many years).  Mr. Wainwright, on carefully examining the  letter, fancied he recognised Smith's handwriting, and resolved upon  keeping the appointment, supposing that Smith, fearing arrest, dared not  openly wait upon him.  An arrest was an easy matter then.  It was only  necessary to swear to a debt and take out a writ and you could arrest  anybody at a moment's notice, whether they actually owed you anything or  not.  There used to be tough swearing in olden times.  Mr. Wainwright  went to the house indicated and there, as he anticipated, found  Theophilus Smith.  Mr. Wainwright concluded that Smith was about to make  some disclosures relative to his affairs and that was the reason he had  sent for him.  But Smith only produced a printed statement of his  accounts, which had been previously circulated, and made no new discovery  of any consequence; he, however, most strongly and earnestly entreated  Mr. Wainwright to accompany him to Tunstall, where, he said, on the  following afternoon, his creditors would meet, and where Mr. Wainwright's  presence would be conducive to their coming to terms.  Mr. Wainwright at  first refused to accede to this request, having important business of his  own to attend to, but Smith was so importunate that he at length  consented to accompany him, and they set out on the same afternoon in a  chaise and pair.  On their way, Smith was very friendly with Mr.  Wainwright, and conversed with him as any man would with a friendly  traveller on a long journey.  On arriving within a mile of his house at  Tunstall, Mr. Smith ordered the chaise to"]]]
