The one brought  him from Paris the newest, most expensive, most showy toys; the other  manufactured for him the most splendid whistles from bits of elder; and,  by Jove! the Dauphin hesitated between them!    Upon the whole, among all these beings grouped as it were by force  around a cradle, the only really unhappy one was Charles d'Athis. His  elegant and patrician inspiration suffered from this life in the depths  of a forest, like a delicate Parisian woman for whom the country air is  too strong. He could no longer work, and far from that terrible Paris  who shuts her gates so quickly against the absent, he felt himself  already nearly forgotten. Fortunately the child was there, and when the  child smiled, the father thought no more of his successes as a poet, nor  of the past of Irma Salle.    And now, would you know the finale of this singular drama? Read the  brief note bordered with black, that I received only a few days ago, and  which is the last page of this truly Parisian adventure:    \"_M. le Comte and Mme. la Comtesse d'Athis grieve to inform you of the  death of their son Robert!_\"    Unhappy creatures! Imagine them all four gazing at each other before  that empty cradle!    [Illustration: p207-218]    [Illustration: p208-219]    [Illustration: p211-222]          THE CONFIDENCES OF AN ACADEMIC COAT.    That morning was the dawn of a glorious day for the sculptor Guillardin.    Elected on the previous day a member of the _Institut_, he was about  to inaugurate before the five Academies gathered together in solemn  concourse, his academic coat, a magnificent garment ornamented with  green palm-leaves, resplendent in its new cloth and silken embroidery,  colour of hope. The blessed coat, opened ready to slip on, lay spread on  an arm-chair, and Guillardin contemplated it tenderly as he arranged the  bow of his white tie.    \"Above all no hurry,\" thought the good fellow. \"I have plenty of time.\"    The fact is that in his feverish impatience he had dressed a couple of  hours too soon; and the beautiful Madame Guillardin--always very slow  over her dressing--had positively declared that on this day she would  only be ready at the precise moment--not a minute earlier, do you hear!    Unfortunate Guillardin! What could he do to kill the time?    \"Well, all the same, I will try on my coat,\" he said, and gently as  though he were handling tulle and lace, he lifted the precious frippery,  and having donned it with infinite precaution, he placed himself in  front of his looking-glass. Oh! what a charming picture the  mirror disclosed to him! What an amiable little Academician, freshly  hatched, happy, smiling, grizzled, and protuberant, with arms too short  in proportion to his figure, which in the new sleeves acquired a stiff  and automatic dignity!    [Illustration: p213-224]    Thoroughly satisfied with his appearance, Guillardin marched up and  down, bowed as though entering the Academy, smiled to his colleagues of  the fine arts, and assumed academical attitudes. Nevertheless, whatever  pride one may feel at one's personal appearance, it is impossible to  remain two hours in full dress, before a looking-glass. At last our  Academician felt somewhat fatigued, and fearful lest he should rumple  his coat, made up his mind to take it off and lay it back very carefully  on the arm-chair. Then seating himself opposite on the other side of the  fireplace, with his legs stretched out and his two hands crossed over  his dress waistcoat, he began to indulge in sweet dreams as he gazed at  the green coat.    Like the traveller who, arrived at the end of his journey, likes  to remember the dangers and difficulties that have beset his path,  Guillardin retraced his life, year by year, from the day when he began  to learn modelling in Jouffroy's studio. Ah! the outset is hard in that  confounded profession. He remembered the fireless winters, the sleepless  nights, the endless walks in search of work, the desperate rage  experienced at feeling so small, so lost, and unknown in the immense  crowd that pushes, hustles, upsets, and crushes. And yet all alone,  without patronage or money, he had managed to rise. By sheer talent,  sir! And his head thrown back, and eyes half-shut, the worthy man kept  repeating out loud to himself: \"By sheer talent. Nothing but talent.\"    [Illustration: p215-226]    A long burst of laughter, dry and creaky like an old man's laugh,  suddenly interrupted him. Slightly startled, Guillardin glanced around  the room. He was alone, quite alone, _tete-a-tete_ with his green coat,  the ghost of an Academician solemnly spread out opposite him, on the  other side of the fire. And still the insolent laugh rang on. Then as  he looked at it more intently, the sculptor almost fancied that his coat  was no longer in the place where he had put it, but really seated in the  arm-chair, with tails turned up, and sleeves resting on the arms of the  chair, the fronts puffed out with an appearance of life. Incredible as  it may seem, it was this thing that was laughing. Yes, it was from this  singular green coat that arose the uncontrollable fits of laughter by  which it was agitated, shaken and convulsed, causing it to jerk its  tails, throw itself back in the chair, and at moments place its two  sleeves against its sides, as though to check this supernatural and  inextinguishable excess of mirth. At the same time, a feeble voice, sly  and mischievous, could be heard saying between two hiccups: \"Oh dear,  oh dear, how it hurts one to laugh like this! How it hurts one to laugh  like this!\" \"Who the devil is there, for mercy's sake?\" asked the poor  Academician with wide staring eyes.    The voice continued still more slyly and mischievously:    \"But it's I, Monsieur Guillardin, I, your palm-embroidered coat, waiting  for you to start for the reception. I must crave pardon for having so  unseasonably interrupted your musing; but really it is too funny to hear  you talk of your talent! I could not restrain myself. Come, you can't be  serious? Can you conscientiously believe that your talent has sufficed  to raise you so rapidly to the point you have attained in life; that it  has given you all you possess: honours, position, fame, fortune? Do  you really think that possible, Guillardin? Examine yourself, my dear  friend, before answering; go down, far, far down, into your inmost  conscience. Now, answer me? Don't you see you dare not?\"    \"And yet,\" stammered Guillardin, with comical hesitation, \"I've.... I've  worked a great deal.\"    \"Oh yes, a great deal, you have fagged tremendously. You are a toiler,  a drudge, you knock off a great deal of work. You count your task by the  hour, like a cabdriver. But the spark, my dear boy, which, like a golden  bee flits through the brain of the true artist, and emits from its wings  both light and music, when has it ever visited you? Not once, and you  are well aware of it. It has always frightened you, that divine little  bee! And yet it is this only that gives real talent. Ah! I know many who  also work, but very differently from you, with all the anxiety and fever  of sincere research, and yet who will never reach the point you have  attained. Look here, acknowledge this much, now we are alone. Your one  talent has been marrying a pretty woman.\"    \"Monsieur!\" interrupted Guillardin, turning purple. The voice proceeded  unchanged: \"Ah well! This burst of indignation is a good sign. It proves  to me what all the world knows indeed; that you are certainly more fool  than knave. Come, come, you need not roll such furious eyes at me. In  the first place, if you touch me, if you make the least crease or tear  in me, it will be impossible to go to the reception to-day, and then,  what will Madame Guillardin say? For after all, it is to her that all  the glory of this great day is due.    [Illustration: p219-230]    It is she whom the five Academies are about to receive, and I can assure  you that if I appeared at the _Institut_ on her pretty person, still  so elegant and slender notwithstanding her age, I should cut a very  different figure than with you. Confound it, Monsieur Guillardin,  we must look facts in the face! You owe everything to that woman;  everything, your house, your forty thousand francs (sixteen hundred  pounds) a year, your cross of the Legion of Honour, your laurels, your  medals.\"    And with the gesture of a one-armed man, the green coat, with its empty  embroidered sleeve, pointed out to the unfortunate sculptor the glorious  insignia hung up on the walls of his alcove. Then, as though wishing  the better to torment his victim, to assume every aspect, and every  attitude, the cruel coat drew nearer the fire, and leaning forward on  his arm-chair with a little old-fashioned and confidential air, he spoke  familiarly, in the tone of a long-established intimacy:    \"Come, old boy, what I've said seems to upset you. Yet it is better you  should know what everybody is aware of. And who could tell you better  than your own coat? Let us reason a little. What had you when you  married? Nothing. What did your wife bring you? Nothing. Then how do  you explain your present fortune? You are going to repeat again that you  have, worked very hard. But my poor friend, working day and night, with  all the patronage and the orders from government which have certainly  not been wanting to you since your marriage, you have never made more  than fifteen thousand francs (six hundred pounds) a year. Can you for  one moment suppose that was sufficient to keep up an establishment like  yours? Remember that the beautiful Madame Guillardin has always been  cited as a model of elegance, frequenting the richest society. Of course  I am well aware that shut up as you were from morning till night in your  studio,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22523"],[0,"The History of the American Expedition Fighting the Bolsheviki (#15)"],[1,"jackies seized engines and cars at Archangel  Preestin and Bakaritza, which had been saved by the hindering activities  of anti-Bolshevik trainmen, and dashed south in pursuit. There is a  heroic little tale of an American Naval Reserve lieutenant who with a  few sailors took a lame locomotive and two cars with a few rifles and  two machine guns, mounted on a flat car, and hotly gave chase to the  retreating Red Guards, routing them in their stand at Issaka Gorka where  they were trying to destroy or run off locomotives and cars, and then  keeping their rear train moving southward at such a rate that the Reds  never had time to blow the rails or burn a bridge till he had chased  them seventy-five miles. There a hot box on his improvised armored train  stopped his pursuit. He tore loose his machine guns and on foot reached  the bridge in time to see the Reds burn it and exchange fire with them,  receiving at the end a wound in the leg for his great gallantry.    The Red Guards were able to throw up defenses and to bring up supporting  troops. A few days later the French battalion fought a spirited, but  indecisive, engagement with the Reds. It was seen that he intended to  fight the Allies. He retreated southward a few miles at a time, and  during the latter part of August succeeded in severely punishing a force  of British and French and American sailors, who had sought to attack the  Reds in flank. And it was this episode in the early fighting that caused  the frantic radiogram to reach us on the Arctic Ocean urging the  American ships to speed on to Archangel to save the handful of Allied  men threatened with annihilation on the railroad and up the Dvina River.  And we were to go into it wholehearted to save them, and later find  ourselves split up into many detachments and cornered up in many another  just such perilous position but with no forces coming to support us.    The inability of the Allied Supreme War Council to furnish sufficient  troops for the North Russian expedition, and the delay of the United  States to furnish the part of troops asked of her, very nearly condemned  the undertaking to failure before it was fairly under way. However, as  the ultimate success of the expedition depended in any event on the  success of the Allied operations in far off Siberia in getting the  Czecho-Slovak veterans and Siberian Russian allies through to Kotlas,  toward which they were apparently fighting their way under their gallant  leader and with the aid of Admiral Kolchak, and because there was a  strong hope that General Poole's prediction of a hearty rallying of  North Russians to the standards of the Allies to fight the Germans and  Bolsheviki at one and the same time, the decision of the Supreme War  Council was, in spite of President Wilson's opposition to the plan, to  continue the expedition and strengthen it as fast as possible. To the  American soldier at this distance it looks as though the French and  British, perhaps in all good faith, planned to muddle along till the  American authorities could be shown the fitness or the necessity of  supporting the expedition with proper forces. But this was playing with  a handful of Americans and other Allied troops a great game of hazard.  Only those who went through it can appreciate the peril and the hazard.    To the credit of the American doughboys and Tommies and Poilus and  others who went into North Russia in the fall of 1918 let it be said  that they smashed in with vim and gallant action, thinking that they  were going to do a small bit away up there in the north to frustrate the  military and political plans of the Germans. And although they were not  all interested in the Russian civil war at the beginning, they did learn  that the North Russian people's ideal of government was the  representative government of the Americans, while the Red Guards whom  they were fighting stood for a government which on paper at its own face  value represented only one class and offered hatred to all other  classes. When it tried to put into effect its so-called constitution  that had been dreamed out of a nightmare of oppression and hate, it  failed completely. Machine gun beginning begot cruel offspring of  provisional courts of justice and sword-revised soviets of the people so  that packed soviets and Lenine-picked delegates and Trotsky-ridden  ministers made the actual soviet government as much resemble the ideal  soviet government as a wild-cat mining stock board of directors  resembles a municipal board of public works. And the world knows now, if  it did not in 1918-19, that the Russian Socialist Federated Soviet  Republic was, and is, a highly centralized tyranny, frankly called by  its own leaders \"The Dictatorship of the Proletariat.\" The Russian  people prayed for \"a fish and received a serpent.\"        VI    ON THE FAMOUS KODISH FRONT IN THE FALL    \"K\" Company Hurries To Save Force \"B\"--Importance Of Kodish  Front--Hazelden's Force Destroyed--First Fight At Seletskoe--Both Sides  Burn Bridges--Desperate Fighting At Emtsa River--Capture Of  Kodish--Digging In--We Lose Village After Days Of Hard  Fighting--Trenches And Blockhouses.    Nowhere did the Yanks in North Russia find the fighting fiercer than did  those who were battling their way toward Plesetskaya on the famous  Kodish front. Woven into their story is that of the most picturesque  American fighter and doughtiest soldier of the many dauntless officers  and men who struggled and bled in that strange campaign. This man was  Captain Michael Donoghue, commanding officer of \"K\" Company, 339th  Infantry. He afterward was promoted in the field to rank of major and  his old outfit of Detroit boys proudly remember that \"K\" stands for  Kodish where they and their commander earned the plaudits of the  regiment.    It will be remembered that the third battalion was hurried from  troopship to troop train and steamed south as fast as the rickety Russki  locomotives of the 1880 type could wobble, and it will be remembered  that Captain Donoghue, the senior captain of that battalion, was chosen  to go with half of his \"K\" Company to the relief of a mixed force of  American sailors and British Royal Scots and French infantry who had  been surrounded, it was rumored, and were in imminent danger of  annihilation.    With his little force of one hundred and twenty men, including a medical  officer with eight enlisted medical men, transporting his rations and  extra munitions on the dumpy little Russki droskie, the American officer  led out of Obozerskaya at three o'clock in the afternoon, bivouacked for  the night somewhere on the trail in a cold drizzle, and reached  Volshenitsa, the juncture of the trails from Seletskoe and Emtsa, about  noon of the 8th of September.    Four versts beyond Volshenitsa the column passed the scene of the battle  between the Bolos and \"B\" Force. Gear and carts scattered around and two  or three fresh graves told that this was serious business. A diary of an  American sailor and the memoranda of a British officer, broken off  suddenly on the 30th of August, that were picked up told of the  adventures of the handful of men we were going to hunt. More  explanations of the genesis of this Kodish front is now in order.    Consideration of the map will show that Kodish was of great strategic  Importance. Truth to tell it was of more importance than our High  Command at first estimated. The Bolshevik strategists were always aware  of its value and never permitted themselves to be neglectful of it.  Trotsky knew that the strategy and tactics of the winter campaign would  make good use of the Kodish road. Indeed it was seen in the fall by  General Poole that a Red column from Plesetskaya up the Kodish road was  a wedge between the railroad forces and the river forces, always  imperiling the Vaga and Dvina forces with being cut off if the Reds came  strong enough.    The first movement on Kodish by the Allied troops had been made by \"B\"  force under the command of Col. Hazelden of the British army. With about  two hundred men composed of French soldiers, a few English soldiers,  American sailors from the Olympic, and some local Russian volunteers, he  had pushed up the Dvina and Vaga to Seletskoe and operating from there  had sent a party of French even as far as Emtsa River, a few miles north  of Kodish.    But before he could attack Kodish, Hazelden was ordered to strike across  the forest area and attack the Reds in the rear near Obozerskaya where  the Bolshevik rear guard with its excellent artillery strategist was  stubbornly holding the Allied Force \"A.\" Passing through Seletskoe he  left the Russian volunteers to oppose the Reds in Kodish, and guard his  rear. But these uncertain troops fled upon approach of the Bolos and  about the first of September Col. Hazelden instead of being in a  position to demoralize the Reds on the railroad by a swift blow from  behind, found himself in desperate defense, both front and rear, and  beleagured in the woods and swamps some twenty-seven versts east of  Obozerskaya.    He managed to get a message through to Sisskoe just before the Reds  closed in on him from behind. About a hundred English marines, a section  of machine gunners, a platoon of Royal Scots, and some Russian  artillery, all enroute to Archangel from their chase of the Reds up the  Dvina, were ordered off their barges at Sisskoe, were christened \"D\"  Force, and, under the command of Captain Scott, British officer, were  given the task of preventing the Reds from Kodish from cutting off the  river communications.    This force was also to help Col. Hazelden out. But as we have seen, his  force had been destroyed, and Americans hurriedly sent out. At  Volshenitsa Captain Donoghue received a message by aeroplane from Col.  Guard at Obozerskaya that \"D\" Force was held up at Tiogra by the Reds.
