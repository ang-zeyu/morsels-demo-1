It was  Marjorie who came to her friend's defense.    Even as a wee girl Marjorie Dean had possessed a temper. It was not an  ordinary temper. It was not easily aroused, but when once awakened it  shook her small body with intense fury and the object of her rage was  likely to remember her outburst forever after. Knowing it to be her  greatest fault, she had striven diligently to conquer it and it burst  forth only at rare intervals. To-night, however, the French girl's  heartless denunciation of Constance during a moment of happiness was too  monstrous to be borne. In a voice shaking with indignation she turned to  those surrounding her and said, \"Will you please go on dancing? I have  something to say to Miss La Salle.\"    They scattered as if by magic, leaving Marjorie facing Mignon, her arm  about Constance, her face a white mask, her eyes flaming with scorn.  Then she began in low, even tones:    \"I forbid you to say another word either to or about my friend Constance  Stevens. She has not taken your bracelet. She knows nothing about it. I  will answer for her as I would for myself. You have accused her of this  because you wish to disgrace her in the eyes of her friends and  schoolmates. I am not at all sure that you have lost it, but I am very  sure that Miss Stevens hasn't seen it. And now I hope I shall never be  called upon to speak to you again, for you are the cruelest, most  contemptible girl I have ever known; but, if I hear anything further of  this, I will take you to Miss Archer, to the Board of Education, if  necessary, and make you retract every word. Come on, Constance.\"    With her arm still encircling the now weeping girl, Marjorie made her  way to the dressing-room. Jerry followed her within the next five  minutes.    \"The car's here,\" she announced briefly. \"Hal and Laurie and the Crane  are going home with us.\"    \"Don't you cry, Constance,\" she soothed, patting the curly, golden head.  \"Mignon made a goose of herself to-night. The boys are all disgusted,  and everyone knows she was making a fuss over nothing. You did exactly  right, too, Marjorie, when you sent us all about our business. I'm sorry  it happened, but you remember what I tell you, Mignon has hurt herself a  great deal more than she has hurt you.\"          CHAPTER XIII    A PITCHED BATTLE      After the echoes of the dance had died away, basketball received a new  impetus that brought it to the fore with a bound. With the renewed  interest in the coming game was also noised about the report that \"Miss  Dean wasn't on the team any longer,\" and in some unknown fashion the  news that she had been \"asked\" to resign had also gone the round of the  study hall. The upper class girls were not particularly interested  either in Marjorie or her affairs. She had not lived in Sanford long  enough to become well-known to them, and as a rule the juniors and  seniors left the bringing up of the freshmen to their sophomore sisters.  The sophomores were too much absorbed in the progress of their own team  to trouble themselves greatly over what was happening in the freshman  organization. If Muriel or Mignon had resigned, then there would have  been good cause for predicting an easy victory, for both girls were  considered formidable opponents; but Marjorie was new material, untried  and unproven.    It was in the freshman class, however, that comment ran rife. Since the  night of the Weston dance the class had been almost equally divided. A  little less than half the girls had either openly or by friendly smiles  and nods declared in favor of Marjorie and her friends. The remaining  members of the class, with a few neutral exceptions, were apparently  devoted to the French girl and Muriel. Among their adherents they also  counted Miss Merton, who took no pains to conceal her open dislike for  Marjorie, and Marcia Arnold, who even went so far as to try to explain  the situation to Miss Archer and was sternly reminded that the principal  would take no part in the private differences of her girls unless they  had something to do with breaking the rules of the school.    The days immediately preceding the game were not cheerful ones for  Marjorie. She was still unhappy over her unjust dismissal from the team,  and she wondered if it had been much talked of among her classmates. At  home she had announced offhandedly her resignation from the team and  her mother had asked no questions.    Mignon was greatly disturbed and displeased with the advent of Marjorie  Dean into Sanford High School. Young as she was, she was very shrewd,  and she at once foresaw in Marjorie's pretty face and attractive  personality a rival power. To be sure, Marjorie's father was not so rich  as her own, but it could not be denied that the Deans lived in a big  house on Maple avenue, that Marjorie wore \"perfectly lovely\" clothes and  had plenty of pocket money. In the beginning she had decided that it  would be better to make friends with her, but Marjorie's sturdy defense  of Constance and utter disregard for Mignon's significant warning had  shown her plainly that she could not influence the other girl to do what  she considered an unworthy act. Therefore, she had secretly determined  to make matters as disagreeable as lay within her power for the two  girls during her freshman year. Still she was obliged to admit to  herself that her next move would have to be planned and carried out with  more discretion.    And now it was the Friday before the much-heralded basketball game which  was to be played between the sophomores and the freshmen, and the merits  and shortcomings of the respective organizations were being eagerly  discussed throughout the school. The game was to be called at half-past  two o'clock on Saturday afternoon, and from all accounts there was to be  no lack of spectators.    \"I wouldn't for anything miss that game to-morrow!\" exclaimed Jerry  Macy, as she and Constance and Marjorie came down the steps of the  school together. \"I hope the freshmen get the worst whitewashing that  any team in this school has ever had, too,\" she added, with a deliberate  air of spite.    \"You mustn't say that, Jerry,\" returned Marjorie, a faint color rising  to her cheeks. \"You must not let my grievances affect your loyalty to  your class.\"    \"Do you mean to say that you want that horrid Mignon La Salle and her  crowd to win the game, and then go around crowing that it was all  because they put you out of the team? You needn't look so as though you  didn't believe me. You mark my word, if they win you'll find out that  they'll do just as I say. Freshman or no freshman, I'd rather see that  nice Ellen Seymour's team win any day.\"    \"So would I,\" echoed Constance, her face darkening with the remembrance  of her own wrongs at Mignon's hands.    Marjorie was silent for a moment. She knew that Jerry's outburst rose  from pure devotion to her friends, and she could not blame Constance for  her hostile spirit. Still, was it right to allow personal grudges to  warp one's loyalty to one's class? If the record of their class read  badly at the end of their freshman year, whose fault would it be? She  had fought it all out with herself on the day she wrote her resignation,  and had wisely determined, then, not to allow it to spoil her year.    \"I know how you girls feel about this,\" she said slowly. \"I felt the  same way until after I had written my resignation. While I was writing I  kept hoping that the team would lose and be sorry they had put someone  else in my place. Then it just came to me all of a sudden that a good  soldier wouldn't be a traitor to his country even if he were reduced in  rank or had something happen unpleasant to him in his camp.\"    She stopped and looked embarrassed. She had forgotten that the girls  could not possibly know what she meant. She had never told any one in  Sanford High School about the pretty soldier play which she and Mary had  carried on for so long. It was one of the little intimate details of her  life which she preferred to keep to herself. Should she explain? Jerry's  impatient retort made it unnecessary.    \"The only traitor I know anything about is Mignon,\" she flung back,  failing to grasp the significance of Marjorie's comparison.    Constance, however, had flashed a curious glance at her friend, saying  nothing. When Geraldine had nodded good-bye at her street, and the two  were alone, she asked: \"What did you mean by comparing yourself to a  soldier, Marjorie?\"    Marjorie smiled.    \"I think I'd better tell you all about it. I've never told anyone else.\"    \"What a splendid game,\" mused Constance, half to herself, when Marjorie  had finished. \"Do you--would you--could I be a soldier, too, Marjorie?  It would help me. You don't know. There are so many things.\"    The wistful appeal touched Marjorie.    \"Of course you can,\" she assured. \"You'd better come to my house to  luncheon to-morrow. You can join the army then and go to the game with  me.\"    \"I'm not going to the game.\" The look of expectancy died out of  Constance's face.    \"You can't be a soldier if you balk at the first disagreeable thing that  comes along,\" reminded Marjorie, slipping her arm through that of her  friend. Constance walked a few steps in stolid silence. She could not  make up her mind to watch the playing of the girls whom she felt she  hated, even to please Marjorie. It was not until they were about to  separate that Marjorie said quietly. \"Shall I tell mother you are  coming?\" and Constance forced herself to reply shortly, \"I'll come.\"    By half past one Saturday afternoon every seat in the large gallery  surrounding the gymnasium was filled, and by a quarter to two every  square foot of standing room was occupied by an enthusiastic audience  largely composed of boys and girls of the two high schools. Marjorie's  mother had after some little coaxing consented to come to the game with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23650"],[0,"Ten Boys from History (#15)"],[1,"Dauphin did not show  as much pleasure as he expected at this and finally on questioning him  he discovered the truth.    \"I have got a beautiful everlasting in my garden,\" Louis said, \"I want  to give it to her, please, papa, it will be my bouquet and my letter  all together, for when I give it to mamma I shall say, 'I hope mamma,  that you will be like this flower.'\"    The idea was so pretty and the boy so eager, that he had his way, and  King Louis' pride in this clever child was great.    He was no prig, no saintly child, this little King Louis Seventeenth to  be, he was just a sensitive, affectionate boy, whose winning manner and  charm of person attracted all to him, and made him an especial pet of  the older people from whose conversation he gathered much information  which they never thought he understood.    One day when playing in the garden, full of excited vigour, he was just  going to rush through a hedge of roses, when an attendant stopped him  and warned him, saying:    \"Monseigneur, one of those thorns might blind you or tear your face.\"    But the Dauphin persisted, and when halfway through the hedge, called  back:    \"Thorny paths lead to glory\"--a phrase so ominous of the poor little  Dauphin's future that it has ever been remembered as one of the most  remarkable of his sayings.    For some time, the Dauphin who was quick to respond to joy or sadness  in those around him noticed many signs of distress, not only in the  faces of his father and mother, but in those of others whom he saw  daily, and many an hour when no one knew it, his childish mind spent in  wondering about the situation, trying to understand the heated words he  heard, the tears he saw, and sometimes he would creep up to Marie  Antoinette and pat her smooth cheek reassuringly, and kiss her  lovingly, and though this comforted, it added to the pain of the Queen,  who feared for the happiness of the future King of France.    The Reign of Terror was at hand. The Revolutionists, fierce and strong  in their murderous frenzy had risen, risen to kill monarchs and  monarchy. Louis Sixteenth was on the throne--therefore Louis Sixteenth  must go; Marie Antoinette was his wife; she had danced, and spent money  like water while they, the people had needed bread, so they said--and  Marie Antoinette must go. Little Louis was heir to the throne--that  throne whose power must be overthrown, and so Louis the Dauphin must  go.    The rulers of France had for generations proved so false to their trust  and to their kingly responsibility that the love of the people had at  last been changed into hate. Louis Fourteenth and Louis Fifteenth had  sinned so deeply against those whom their oath of office bound them to  protect, that now at last there was no feeling but revenge and hatred  in the hearts of the subjects of the King of France, and on the heads  of the reigning sovereigns, Louis Sixteenth and Marie Antoinette fell  the horrors of the Reign of Terror, which was now reaching a point  where only torture and bloodshed could appease the fiends who were  rapidly becoming all-powerful. It was claimed that the taxes collected  from the people for the expenses of war and government were being  misused for the extravagances and frivolities of the royal family. It  was even claimed that the people were starving for bread while the King  and Queen were living in luxury, and this because the fiends of the  revolution had caused all bake-shops to stop baking bread, so that the  cry of starvation might be raised among the people, who could then be  incited to storm the palace and demand bread of the royal family.    The very scum of civilisation, the dregs of the population of France,  were roused in fierce and unjust revolt against the royal family; yes,  in revolt and in power, and on a day of early October, 1789, a howling  mob of frenzied men, women and children swept up the peaceful avenues  of Versailles, shrieking their fiendish cries for vengeance on the  royal family, and then they invaded and took possession of the royal  apartments. Aghast at the outrages committed in the name of the French  people, the King and Queen tried in every way to restore the mob to  peace, but in vain. The leaders of the rebellion demanded the immediate  appearance in Paris, which was the seat of the revolution, of King  Louis and his family, where they could be closely watched by their  enemies, describing in alarming terms, the danger to his majesty if he  did not comply with the request. Accordingly, after hours of  indescribable horrors and humiliation and anguish, the king was obliged  to give his consent to the plan, and the royal family made ready for  their departure from Versailles. During their seven hours' journey to  Paris, they were followed by a rabble of such human fiends as had  invaded the palace at Versailles, and although throughout the whole  terrible trip, Marie Antoinette and the King bore themselves with sad  and dignified composure, yet the strain on them both was almost too  great to be borne. Through all the agony and excitement, the Dauphin  frightened though he was, seeing his mother's tears, tried to smile  courageously into her face, and to keep back words of complaint, and  the sight of his courage almost broke his mother's heart. What would  this all mean to him, the future king of France? Alas, poor little  Dauphin!    At last they reached the Tuileries, the royal palace in Paris, where no  French King had lived since Louis Fifteenth was a young man. There had  been no preparations made for the coming of the royal family. The  palace, so long uninhabited was in a state of dilapidation, and there  were no comforts in it, and very few necessities. But the travellers  were too much exhausted to heed anything but that they had reached a  temporary shelter and were relieved that death, which the day before  had seemed so imminent, had been, for the present, put aside.    Exhausted to the breaking point, Marie Antoinette slept soundly that  night, and on the next morning as she sipped her chocolate in a room  which had been hastily transformed into a sitting-room for her, she was  thinking sadly of life and its changes when the door opened and the  Dauphin ran in and flung himself into her arms.    \"Oh, mamma,\" he cried, \"please let us go back to our beautiful palace  at home. This big house frightens me with its shadows. Why have we come  here, mamma, when we have such a lovely palace and garden of our own?\"    The queen sighed.    \"My son,\" she said, \"this palace belongs to us too, as well as  Versailles, and it is considered a beautiful palace. It is where the  great Louis Fourteenth lived, you know.\"    \"Well, I don't like it at all and I wish we could go away,\" whispered  the Dauphin, casting a homesick look around the great bare room,  furnished so meagrely with faded furniture.    \"I wish so too.\" The queen scarcely breathed the words, but the  sensitive child's ears caught them, and he answered eagerly.    \"Then why do we have to stay? I thought a queen could always do what  she wanted to do.\"    In answer the poor, sore-hearted queen burst into tears, whereupon the  Dauphin's tutor tried to take the child from her, saying severely:    \"My prince, you see you trouble the queen, and her majesty sorely needs  a rest. Come with me for a walk.\"    But Marie Antoinette shook her head and clung to the child whose hand  was now gently stroking her cheek, and whose tears were mingled with  her own.    Then from the street came the dreaded sound of loud shouts and cries  and threats, and the Dauphin clung more tightly to his mother, both  shivering with dread but both brave.    \"Mamma,\" asked the Dauphin, \"is to-day going to be just like  yesterday?\"    His question was answered by the king himself, who entered the room  just then and flung himself into a chair, telling the queen that those  who had aided the mob in their violent acts were about to be brought to  trial for them, and he added his request that the queen should receive  the committee who had come to judge the people for their violence.    In stately dignity, Marie Antoinette then left the room to receive  other subjects, who still considered her the queen of France, and after  her going, King Louis and his little son were left alone.    The king, exhausted in body and mind, closed his eyes and lay back in  his chair, ready to sink into a light doze, when he was roused by a  gentle touch on his arm.    Beside him stood the Dauphin, his great blue eyes full of grave  thoughtfulness. When he saw the King's eyes open, he spoke.    \"Papa,\" he said, hesitatingly, \"I should like to ask you  something--something really serious!\"    \"Something really serious!\" replied the King, smiling in spite of  himself. \"Well, what is it? Let me hear.\"    \"Papa,\" answered the Dauphin, with an air of one who has thought deeply  on a subject. \"My governess has always told me I must love the people  of France and treat them kindly, because they love you and mama so  much. But if they do, papa, then why do the people act so badly to you?  And oh, papa, I have been told that your people owe you obedience and  respect, but they were not obedient nor respectful yesterday and they  said dreadful things I never heard before. What does it mean, papa?\"    The king drew the child on to his knee and put an arm around the grave  little questioner, telling him that he would explain it to him, but  that he would have to listen carefully if he wished to understand such  grave matters.    \"Oh, I will, I will,\" answered the Dauphin eagerly. \"I know that I am  one of your subjects, and that as your son and a subject too, I must  give a good example to the French people of loving and obeying the  king. But it seems that my example has not done any good at all yet.  How does that happen, papa?\"    In answer, the King told him that wicked men had said to the people  that he did not love them, that they had"]]]
