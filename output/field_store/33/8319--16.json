It was believed that a storm of disapproval  would greet his work, and the timid ones seriously questioned the  expediency of his nomination. The submission of the treaty had already  precipitated a crisis in the United States Senate, and while it might  not be ratified and officially promulgated before election, grave  danger existed of its clandestine publication by the press. Hamilton,  however, insisted, and Jay became the nominee. \"It had been so decreed  from the beginning,\" wrote Egbert Benson.    The campaign that followed was featureless. Chief Justice Yates  aroused no interest, and Chief Justice Jay was in England. From the  outset, Jay's election was conceded; and a canvass of the votes showed  that he had swept the State by a large majority. In 1789 Clinton  received a majority of 489; in 1792 the canvassers gave him 108; but  in 1795 Jay had 1589.[71]    [Footnote 71: John Jay, 13,481; Robert Yates, 11,892. _Civil List,  State of New York_ (1887), p. 166.]    What would have happened had the treaty been published before  election, fills one with interested conjecture. Its disclosure on July  2, the day after Jay's inauguration, turned the applause of that  joyous occasion into the most exasperating abuse. Such a sudden and  tempestuous change in the popularity of a public official is  unprecedented in the history of American politics. In a night the  whole State was thrown into a ferment of intense excitement, the storm  of vituperation seeming to centre in New York city. Jay was burned in  effigy; Hamilton was struck in the face with a stone while defending  Jay's work; a copy of the treaty was burned before the house of the  British Minister; riot and mob violence held carnival everywhere.  Party spirit never before, and never since, perhaps, ran so high. One  effigy represented Jay as saying, while supporting a pair of scales,  with the treaty on one side and a bag of gold on the other, \"Come up  to my price, and I will sell you my country.\" Chalked in large white  letters on one of the principal streets in New York, appeared these  words: \"Damn John Jay! Damn every one that won't damn John Jay!! Damn  every one that won't put lights in his windows and sit up all night  damning John Jay!!!\"[72] This revulsion of public sentiment was not  exactly a tempest in a teapot, but it proved a storm of limited  duration, the elections in the spring of 1796 showing decided  legislative gains for the Federalists.    [Footnote 72: John Jay, _Second Letter on Dawson's Federalist_, N.Y.,  1864, p. 19.]    Hamilton divined the cause of the trouble. \"There are three persons,\"  he wrote,[73] \"prominent in the public eye as the successor of the  President--Mr. Adams, Mr. Jay, and Mr. Jefferson.... Mr. Jay has been  repeatedly the object of attacks with the same view. His friends, as  well as his enemies, anticipated that he could make no treaty which  would not furnish weapons against him; and it were to have been  ignorant of the indefatigable malice of his adversaries to have  doubted that they would be seized with eagerness and wielded with  dexterity. The peculiar circumstances which have attended the two last  elections for governor of this State have been of a nature to give the  utmost keenness to party animosity. It was impossible that Mr. Jay  should be forgiven for his double, and, in the last instance,  triumphant success; or that any promising opportunity of detaching  from him the public confidence, should pass unimproved.... Trivial  facts frequently throw light upon important designs. It is remarkable  that in the toasts given on July 4, 1795, whenever there appears a  direct or indirect censure of the treaty, it is pretty uniformly  coupled with compliments to Mr. Jefferson, and to our late governor,  Mr. Clinton, with an evident design to place those gentlemen in  contrast to Mr. Jay, and, decrying him, to elevate them. No one can be  blind to the finger of party spirit, visible in these and similar  transactions. It indicates to us clearly one powerful source of  opposition to the treaty.\"    [Footnote 73: Hamilton's _Camillus_, July 23, 1795, _Works_, Vol. 4,  p. 371.]    The treaty was undoubtedly a disappointment to the country, and not  greatly pleasing to Washington. Perhaps Jay said the best thing that  could be said in its favour: \"One more favourable was not attainable.\"  The thing he was sent especially to do, he failed to accomplish,  except the evacuation of the posts, and a concession as to the West  Indian trade, which the Senate rejected. Nevertheless the country was  greatly and permanently benefited. The treaty acquired extradition  for criminals; it secured the collection of debts barred by the  Revolution, amounting to ten million dollars; it established the  principle that war should not again be a pretext for the confiscation  of debts or for the annulment of contracts between individuals; and it  avoided a war with England, for which the United States was never more  unprepared. \"As the first treaty negotiated under the new government,\"  says John W. Foster, \"it marked a distinct advance in international  practice.\"[74] In a recent biography of Andrew Jackson, Professor  Sumner says: \"Jay's treaty was a masterpiece of diplomacy, considering  the times and the circumstances of this country.\" Even the  much-criticised commercial clause, \"the entering wedge,\" as Jay called  it, proved such a gain to America, that upon the breaking out of war  in 1812, Lord Sheffield declared that England had \"now a complete  opportunity of getting rid of that most impolitic treaty of 1794, when  Lord Grenville was so perfectly duped by Jay.\"[75]    [Footnote 74: _A Century of American Diplomacy_, p. 165.]    [Footnote 75: To Mr. Abbott, November 6, 1812, _Correspondence of Lord  Colchester_, Vol. 2, p. 409.]    John Jay's first term as governor was characteristically cautious and  conservative. He began with observing the proprieties, gracefully  declining the French Consul's invitation to a republican  entertainment, and courageously remaining at his post during the  yellow fever epidemic of 1795. With equal ease he settled the growing  conflict between the severity of the past and the sympathy of the  present, by changing the punishment in cases of ordinary felony, from  death to imprisonment. Up to that time men might have been executed  for stealing a few loaves of high-priced bread to relieve the  sufferings of a hungry family. Under Jay's humane plea for mercy the  death penalty was limited to treason, murder, and stealing from a  church. A quarter of a century passed before Sir James Mackintosh  succeeded in carrying a similar measure through the British  Parliament.    In his first message Jay recommended neither the abolition of  slavery, nor the discontinuance of official changes for political  reasons, \"since the best and most virtuous men,\" he said, \"must, in  the distribution of patronage, yield to the influence of party  considerations.\" As the only important questions before him just then  involved the freedom of slaves and reform in the civil service, his  silence as to the one and his declaration as to the other were  certainly sufficient to allay any suspicion that he was to become a  radical reformer. He did recommend a legislative interpretation of the  Constitution relating to the governor's exclusive right to nominate to  office; but in the blandest and most complimentary words, the  Legislature invited the Governor to let well enough alone. \"The  evidence of ability, integrity and patriotism,\" so the answer ran,  \"which has been invariably afforded by your conduct in the discharge  of the variety of arduous and important trusts, authorise us to  anticipate an administration conducive to the welfare of your  constituents.\" This amiable answer betrayed the deft hand of Ambrose  Spencer, who, to make it sweeter and more acceptable, moved the  insertion of the word \"invariably.\"[76] Thus ended the suggestion of a  law that might have undone the mischief of Schuyler, and prevented the  scandal and corrupt methods that obtained during the next two decades.  At least, this is the thought of a later century, when civil service  reform has sunk a tap-root into American soil, still frosty, perhaps,  yet not wholly congealed as it seems to have been one hundred years  ago.    [Footnote 76: Jabez D. Hammond, _Political History of New York_, Vol.  1, p. 97.]    Jay's administration might be called the reward days of earnest, able  men, whose meritorious service became their passport to office. Upon  the retirement in 1798 of Robert Yates and John Sloss Hobart from the  Supreme bench, he appointed James Kent and Jacob Radcliff. If Jay had  never done anything else, the appointment of Kent would immortalise  him, just as the selection of John Marshall placed a halo about the  head of President Adams. Kent, now thirty-five years old, a great  lawyer and a strong partisan, had the conservatism of Jay, and held  to the principles of Hamilton. He was making brilliant way in  politics, showing himself an administrator, a debater, and a leader of  consummate ability; but he steadily refused to withdraw from the  professional path along which he was to move with such distinction.  Until Kent's appearance, the administration of the law had been  inefficient and unsatisfactory. Men of ability had occupied the bench;  but the laborious and business methods which subsequently gave  strength and character to the court, had not been applied. The custom  of writing opinions in the most important cases did not then obtain,  while the principles and foundation of the law were seldom explored.  But Kent began at once, after a most laborious examination of the  cases and the law, to bring the written opinions which enrich the  reports of Caines and Johnson, to the consultations of the judges,  thus setting an example to his associates, and opening "]]]
