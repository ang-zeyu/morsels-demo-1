[Illustration: PICKING COTTON, ALABAMA]    [Illustration: TRANSPORTING COTTON FROM WHARF, CHARLESTON, S.C.]    [Illustration: COTTON PRESS YARD, NEW ORLEANS, LA.]          CHAPTER IX    TEXTILE FIBRES      Under the term \"textile\" are included the fibrous substances that can be  spun into threads, and woven or felted into cloth. Some of these, like  the covering of the sheep, goat, and llama, or the cocoon of the  silk-worm, are of animal origin; others, like cotton furze, the husk of  the cocoanut, and the bast of the flax-plant are vegetable products.  Their use in the manufacture of cloth antedates the period at which  written history begins; it probably begins with the time when primitive  man gradually ceased to have the hairy covering necessary to protect him  from the conditions of climate and weather.    As body coverings all these substances are dependent on a single  principle, namely--they are poor conductors of heat; that is, they do  not permit the natural heat of the body to pass away quickly, nor do  they allow sudden changes of the temperature to reach the body quickly.  In other words, because of the artificial covering which mankind alone  requires, bodily heat is not dissipated more rapidly than it is created;  if it were, the covering would be worthless. A suit of clothes made of  steel wire, for instance, because it conducts heat so rapidly, might  chill, or perhaps heat the body more quickly than the open air.    With respect to warming qualities wool surpasses all other textiles. It  is employed for clothing in every part of the world and by nearly all  peoples. Cotton is used mainly also for body coverings, but it is  inferior to wool for protection against cold. It is used by practically  all peoples, savage and civilized, outside of the frigid zones. Linen  is inferior both to cotton and wool for clothing; its use is also  restricted by its great cost. Silk is used mainly for ornamental cloths.  Hemp is used mainly for cordage, and the use of ramie, jute, and sisal  hemp is confined mainly to the manufacture of very coarse cloths and  rugs.    =Cotton.=--The cotton fibre of commerce is the lint surrounding the seeds  of several species of _Gossypium_, plants belonging to the same natural  order as the marshmallow and the hollyhock. The cultivated species have  been carried from India to different parts of the world, but  cotton-bearing plants are also native to the American. A native  tree-cotton, known as Barbados cotton, occurs in the West Indies; a  herbaceous cotton-plant is known to have been cultivated in Peru long  before the discovery of Columbus.    [Illustration: COTTON-PRODUCING REGIONS]    More than four hundred years before the Christian era Herodotus  describes it and mentions a gin for separating the lint from the seed.  Nearchus, an admiral serving under Alexander the Great, brought to  Europe specimens of cotton cloth, and in the course of time it became an  article of commerce among Greek and Roman merchants.    The cotton-plant requires warmth, moisture, and a long season. It also  thrives best near the sea. It grows better, on the whole, in subtropical  rather than in tropical regions, and the difference is due probably to  the longer days and higher temperature of the subtropical latitudes. In  the United States the northern limit is approximately the thirty-eighth  parallel. The seeds are planted, as a rule, during the first three weeks  of April and the first two of May. The plants bloom about the middle of  June; the boll or pod matures during July, and bursts about the first of  August. The picking begins in August.    [Illustration: COTTON IN THE UNITED STATES]    The yield and the quality of the textile depend not only on conditions  of the soil, but on locality. In the river flood-plains of the southern  United States the yield is about two bales per acre; on the bluff lands  it is but little more than one, unless unusual care is taken in the  preparation of the land. The islands off the Carolina coast produce a  very fine long-staple variety, commercially known as _sea island  cotton_. A district in China produces a good fibre of brownish color  known as _nankeen_, named for the city of Nanking, whence formerly it  was exported. The valley of Piura River, Peru, produces varieties of  long-staple cotton that in quality closely resemble silk.    The fibre of ordinary American cotton is about seven-eighths of an inch  long; it is made into the fabrics commercially known as \"domestics\" and  \"prints,\" or calico. If the fibre averages a little longer than the  common grades it is reserved for canvas. Ordinary Peruvian cotton has a  fibre nearly two inches long; it is used in the manufacture of hosiery  and balbriggan underwear, and also to adulterate wool. The long-staple  cotton of the Piura Valley is bought by British manufacturers at a high  price, and used in the webbing of rubber tires and hose. Egyptian cotton  is very fine and is used mainly in the manufacture of thread and the  finer grades of balbriggan underwear. Sea island fibre is nearly two  inches long and is used almost wholly in the making of thread and lace.    The introduction of cotton cultivation resulted in very far-reaching  consequences both from a political as well as an economic stand-point.  The invention of the steam-engine by Watt gave England an enormous  mechanical power. To utilize this the cotton industry was wrested from  Hindustan; the mills were concentrated in Manchester and Lancashire; the  cotton-fields were transferred to the United States.    As a result, the plains of Hindustan were strewn with the bodies of  starved weavers and spinners, but a great industry grew into existence  in England. The invention of spinning machinery by Arkwright, Crompton,  and Hargreaves, and the gradual improvement of the power-loom, greatly  reduced the cost of making the cloth and, at the same time, enormously  increased the demand for it.    [Illustration: COTTON PRODUCTION]    In the United States the consequences were far more serious. The  invention of the engine or \"gin\" for separating the lint from the seed  made cotton cultivation highly profitable.[31] The negro slaves, who had  been scattered throughout the colonies and the States that succeeded  them, were soon drawn to the cotton-growing States to supply the needed  field-labor; and, indeed, white workmen could not stand the hot, moist  climate of the cotton-fields.    The cotton-mills grew up in the Northern manufacturing States. The  Northern manufacturer needed a tariff on imported goods to protect him  from European competition; the Southern cotton-planter who purchased  much of his supplies abroad was hurt by the tariff. After about sixty  years of strained relations between the two sections there occurred the  Civil War which wiped out nearly one million lives, and rolled up a  debt, direct and indirect, of nearly six billions of dollars.    The world's cotton-crop aggregates from twelve million to fifteen  million bales yearly, of which the United States produces, as a rule, a  little more than three-fourths. Egypt is rapidly taking an important  place among cotton-producing countries, and, with the completion of the  various irrigating canals, will very soon rank next to the United  States. India ranks about third; China and Korea produce about the same  quantity. There are a few cotton-cloth mills in these states, but in  Japan the manufacture is increasing, the mills being equipped with the  best of modern machinery. Brazil has a small product, and Russia in Asia  needs transportation facilities only to increase largely its growing  output.    [Illustration: COTTON]    The cotton-crop of the United States is quite evenly distributed;  one-third is manufactured at home; one-third is purchased by Great  Britain; and the remaining third goes mainly to western Europe. In the  past few years China has become a constantly increasing purchaser of  American cotton. New Orleans, Galveston, Savannah, and New York are the  chief ports of shipment. The imported Egyptian and Peruvian cotton is  landed mainly at New York. Most of the cotton manufacture is carried on  in the New England States, but there is a very rapid extension of cotton  manufacture in the South.    =Wool.=--The wool of commerce is a term applied to the fleece of the  common sheep, to that of certain species of goat, and to that of the  camel and its kind. There is no hard-and-fast distinction between hair  and wool,[32] but, in general, wool fibres have rough edges, much  resembling overlapping scales which interlock with one another; hair, as  a rule, has a hard, smooth surface. If a mass of loose wool be spread  out and beaten, or if it be pressed between rollers, the fibres  interlock so closely that there results a thick, strong cloth which has  been made without either spinning or weaving.    This property, known as \"felting,\" gives to wool a great part of its  value, and is its chief distinction from hair. Some kinds of hair,  however, have a slight felting property, and if sufficiently fine may be  spun and woven. The hair of the common goat is worthless for this  purpose, but that of the Cashmere and Angora species have the properties  of wool. The hair of the Bactrian camel, and also that of the llama,  alpaca, and vicuna is soft and fine, possessing felting qualities that  make it very superior as a textile.    [Illustration: WOOL PRODUCING REGIONS]    The quality of wool varies greatly according to the conditions of soil,  climate, and the character of the food of the animal. In commerce,  however, the fleeces are commonly graded as \"long-staple,\"  \"short-staple,\" \"merino,\" and \"coarse.\"    In long-staple wools the fibres are from four to eight inches long;  they are more easily separated by a process much "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24902"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 2, No. 4, March, 1851 (#15)"],[1,"s, we understand, to be brought out under the auspices of  Charles Kean, in London.

The _Literary World_ does not, we  believe, pretend to be an authority in such matters, but that a  \"historical society\" should receive such a gross imposition is somewhat  surprising. The letter is as much a forgery and imposture as the  \"exceedingly interesting letter from General Washington to his wife,\"  published a few months ago in the _Day Book_. Without going into any  further statement or argument on this subject, it may be sufficient to  remark, that Washington was not within two hundred miles of Cambridge on  the 24th of June, 1776.           *       *       *       *       *    THE REV. HENRY W. DUCACHET, D.D., the learned rector of St. Stephen's,  in Philadelphia, has been several years engaged upon a Dictionary of the  Church, which is now nearly ready for publication. Such a work is  properly but a system and history of doctrine and ritual, in a form  suited for the readiest consultation, and it demands, therefore, for its  successful accomplishment, the highest and rarest faculties and  acquisitions. Dr. Ducachet possesses in a very eminent degree, not only  the requisite knowledge and judgment, but he has a certain temperament  and felicity, with a love of and skill in dialectics, which promise even  to the articles for a dictionary, from his hand, the utmost raciness and  attractive interest. We understand this work will be very complete and  voluminous.           *       *       *       *       *    The Poems of \"Edith May,\" the finest artist among the literary women of  this country, are to be published in a very beautiful edition next  summer by E.

REDFIELD has in press \"The Celestial Telegraph, or Secrets of the  Life to Come, revealed through Magnetism, by M. Cahagnet,\" a book of the  class of Mrs. Crowe's \"Night Side of Nature;\" and \"The Volcano Diggings,  a Tale of California Law, by a member of the Bar.\"           *       *       *       *       *    We believe it is about six years since the Rev. WILLIAM W. LORD, then a  resident graduate at Princeton College, published the volume of poems by  which he was introduced to the literary world. That book had various and  striking merits, and though it had many defects in an artistic point of  view, upon the whole it illustrated a just apprehension of the poetic  principle, and such capacities for execution as justified the sanguine  hopes it occasioned among his friends of his future eminence in the  highest and finest of the arts. From that time until the present, Mr.  Lord has not appeared as an author; but the leisure that could be  withdrawn from professional study has been devoted to the composition of  \"_Christ in Hades_,\" (Appleton & Co.) a poem displaying his best  abilities in art, while it is a suitable offering to religion.           *       *       *       *       *    \"It was my purpose,\" he says, \"in undertaking this work, to give poetic  form, design, and history to the descent of Christ into hell; a fact  that has for so many ages attracted the curiosity of the human mind, as  to furnish occasion for surprise that the attempt has not hitherto been  made. As regards the end for which He descended, I have adhered to the  Christian tradition that it was to free the souls of the ancient saints  confined in the temporal paradise of the Under-world, embracing also in  my design the less general opinion, that it was to demonstrate His  universal supremacy by appearing among the damned.    \"A source of additional human interest was suggested by the relation  which men, as a distinct order of beings, might be supposed to sustain  to demons in the place of their common doom, and under new conditions of  existence; such, I conceived, as would make it possible in some degree  to realize even the divine fictions of the Greek mythology, under the  forms and with the attributes accorded them by ancient religions, and by  the poetry of all time. This could not fail to suggest the further  conception of introducing the divinities of our forefathers, and of  other great families of mankind, thus bringing together in action and  contrast the deified men, or various representatives of an heroic  humanity, among different races: nor did it seem too great a stretch of  imaginative probability to conceive that their general characteristics  might be adopted and imitated by beings already invested by the human  mind with an indefinite power, and inhabiting a world in which the  wonderful becomes the probable.    \"But it is, after all, the general purpose of exhibiting the triumph of  moral power over all physical and inferior spiritual force, in the  descent of Christ into hell, which gives my design the complex character  of a mythic, heroic, and Christian poem, and, at the same time,  constitutes the unity of its parts. The ancients, whose representative  types I introduce, knew and appreciated but two kinds of power, brute or  physical, and spiritual, including all occult and supernatural efficacy,  and strength of intellect and will. Virtue, triumphant by the aid of  adventitious force, or relying upon unconquerable pride and disdain to  resist it, was the highest reach of their dynamic conceptions. Moral  power is properly a Christian idea. It is not, therefore, without what I  conceive to be a true as well as a poetic apprehension of the design of  the Descent into Hell, that the heroes of profane, and the not fabulous  Titans of sacred antiquity, by their rivalries and contentions, brought  together in arms for a trial of their comparative strength, are suddenly  confronted with a common and dissimilar antagonist, and 'all strength,  all terror, single or in bands, that ever was put forth' opposed to that  novel, and, save in the Temptation, hitherto untested power, represented  by Christ, the author of the theory and master of the example.    \"He is not supposed to appear among them 'grasping in his hand ten  thousand thunders,' but endued with an equal power, the result and  expression of perfect virtue and rightful authority. His triumph is  attributed neither to natural, nor to supernatural power; but to moral  superiority, evincing itself in His aspect, and exercising its  omnipotence upon the soul and conscience. That in the conception of a  great Christian poet, His appearance among the rebel angels in Heaven  was distinguished by the former attributes, is due, perhaps, to the  heroic prejudice of a mind thoroughly imbued with the spirit of pagan  writers, and of the Hebrew Scriptures.\"    The volume opens with this noble invocation, in which there is fit  recognition of Dante and Milton, whose lips aforetime for such song had  been touched by the divinest fire:          Thou of the darkness and the fire, and fame      Avenged by misery and the Orphic doom,      Bard of the tyrant-lay! whom dreadless wrongs,      Impatient, and pale thirst for justice drove,      A visionary exile, from the earth,      To seek it in its iron reign--O stern!      And not accepting sympathy, accept      A not presumptious offering, that joins      That region with a greater name: And thou,      Of my own native language, O dread bard!      Who, amid heaven's unshadowed light, by thee      Supremely sung, abidest--shouldst thou know      Who on earth with thoughts of thee erects      And purifies his mind, and, but by thee,      Awed by no fame, boldened by thee, and awed--      Not with thy breadth of wing, yet with the power      To breathe the region air--attempts the height      Where never Scio's singing eagle towered,      Nor that high-soaring Theban moulted plume,      Hear thou my song! hear, or be deaf, who may.          And if not rashly, or too soon, I heed      The impulse, but have waited on my heart      With patience, and its utterance stilled with awe      Oh what inspired it, till I felt it beat      True cadence to unconquerable strains;      Oh, then may she first wooed from heaven by prayer      From thy pure lips, and sympathy austere      With suffering, and the sight of solemn age,      And thy gray Homer's head, with darkness bound,      To me descend, more near, as I am far      Beneath thee, and more need her aiding wing.          Oh, not again invoked in vain, descend,      Urania! and eyes with common light      More blinded than were his by Heaven's hand      Imposed to intercept distracting rays,      Bathe in the vision of transcendent day;      And of the human senses (the dark veil      Before the world of spirit drawn) remove      The dim material hindrance, and illume;      That human thought again may dare behold      The shape and port of spirits, and once more      Hear voices in that distant, shadowy world,      To which ourselves,"]]]
