[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26059"],[0,"The Ascent of Denali (Mount McKinley) (#15)"],[1,"boiling-point apparatus was put  together and its candle lighted under the ice which filled its little  cistern. The three-inch, three-circle aneroid was read at once at  thirteen and two-tenths inches, its mendacious altitude scale  confidently pointing at twenty-three thousand three hundred feet. Half  an hour later it had dropped to 13.175 inches and had shot us up another  one hundred feet into the air. Soon the water was boiling in the little  tubes of the boiling-point thermometer and the steam pouring out of the  vent. The thread of mercury rose to 174.9 deg. and stayed there. There  is something definite and uncompromising about the boiling-point  hypsometer; no tapping will make it rise or fall; it reaches its mark  unmistakably and does not budge. The reading of the mercurial barometer  is a slower and more delicate business. It takes a good light and a good  sight to tell when the ivory zero-point is exactly touching the surface  of the mercury in the cistern; it takes care and precision to get the  vernier exactly level with the top of the column. It was read, some  half-hour after it was set up, at 13.617 inches. The alcohol minimum  thermometer stood at 7 deg. F. all the while we were on top. Meanwhile,  Tatum had been reading a round of angles with the prismatic compass. He  could not handle it with sufficient exactness with his mitts on, and he  froze his fingers doing it barehanded.    [Sidenote: The View]    The scientific work accomplished, then and not till then did we indulge  ourselves in the wonderful prospect that stretched around us. It was a  perfectly clear day, the sun shining brightly in the sky, and naught  bounded our view save the natural limitations of vision. Immediately  before us, in the direction in which we had climbed, lay--nothing: a  void, a sheer gulf many thousands of feet deep, and one shrank back  instinctively from the little parapet of the snow basin when one had  glanced at the awful profundity. Across the gulf, about three thousand  feet beneath us and fifteen or twenty miles away, sprang most splendidly  into view the great mass of Denali's Wife, or Mount Foraker, as some  white men misname her, filling majestically all the middle distance. It  was our first glimpse of her during the whole ascent. Denali's Wife does  not appear at all save from the actual summit of Denali, for she is  completely hidden by his South Peak until the moment when his South Peak  is surmounted. And never was nobler sight displayed to man than that  great, isolated mountain spread out completely, with all its spurs and  ridges, its cliffs and its glaciers, lofty and mighty and yet far  beneath us. On that spot one understood why the view of Denali from Lake  Minchumina is the grand view, for the west face drops abruptly down with  nothing but that vast void from the top to nigh the bottom of the  mountain. Beyond stretched, blue and vague to the southwest, the wide  valley of the Kuskokwim, with an end of all mountains. To the north we  looked right over the North Peak to the foot-hills below, patched with  lakes and lingering snow, glittering with streams. We had hoped to see  the junction of the Yukon and Tanana Rivers, one hundred and fifty miles  away to the northwest, as we had often and often seen the summit of  Denali from that point in the winter, but the haze that almost always  qualifies a fine summer day inhibited that stretch of vision. Perhaps  the forest-fires we found raging on the Tanana River were already  beginning to foul the northern sky.    [Illustration: Denali's Wife from the summit of Denali]    It was, however, to the south and the east that the most marvellous  prospect opened before us. What infinite tangle of mountain ranges  filled the whole scene, until gray sky, gray mountain, and gray sea  merged in the ultimate distance! The near-by peaks and ridges stood out  with dazzling distinction, the glaciation, the drainage, the relation of  each part to the others all revealed. The snow-covered tops of the  remoter peaks, dwindling and fading, rose to our view as though floating  in thin air when their bases were hidden by the haze, and the beautiful  crescent curve of the whole Alaskan range exhibited itself from Denali  to the sea. To the right hand the glittering, tiny threads of streams  draining the mountain range into the Chulitna and Sushitna Rivers, and  so to Cook's Inlet and the Pacific Ocean, spread themselves out; to the  left the affluents of the Kantishna and the Nenana drained the range  into the Yukon and Bering Sea.    Yet the chief impression was not of our connection with the earth so far  below, its rivers and its seas, but rather of detachment from it. We  seemed alone upon a dead world, as dead as the mountains on the moon.  Only once before can the writer remember a similar feeling of being  neither in the world nor of the world, and that was at the bottom of the  Grand Canyon of the Colorado, in Arizona, its savage granite walls as  dead as this savage peak of ice.    [Sidenote: The Dark Sky]    Above us the sky took a blue so deep that none of us had ever gazed upon  a midday sky like it before. It was a deep, rich, lustrous, transparent  blue, as dark as a Prussian blue, but intensely blue; a hue so strange,  so increasingly impressive, that to one at least it \"seemed like special  news of God,\" as a new poet sings. We first noticed the darkening tint  of the upper sky in the Grand Basin, and it deepened as we rose. Tyndall  observed and discussed this phenomenon in the Alps, but it seems  scarcely to have been mentioned since.    It is difficult to describe at all the scene which the top of the  mountain presented, and impossible to describe it adequately. One was  not occupied with the thought of description but wholly possessed with  the breadth and glory of it, with its sheer, amazing immensity and  scope. Only once, perhaps, in any lifetime is such vision granted,  certainly never before had been vouchsafed to any of us. Not often in  the summer-time does Denali completely unveil himself and dismiss the  clouds from all the earth beneath. Yet we could not linger, unique  though the occasion, dearly bought our privilege; the miserable  limitations of the flesh gave us continual warning to depart; we grew  colder and still more wretchedly cold. The thermometer stood at 7 deg. in  the full sunshine, and the north wind was keener than ever. My fingers  were so cold that I would not venture to withdraw them from the mittens  to change the film in the camera, and the other men were in like case;  indeed, our hands were by this time so numb as to make it almost  impossible to operate a camera at all. A number of photographs had been  taken, though not half we should have liked to take, but it is probable  that, however many more exposures had been made, they would have been  little better than those we got. Our top-of-the-mountain photography was  a great disappointment. One thing we learned: exposures at such altitude  should be longer than those below, perhaps owing to the darkness of the  sky.    [Illustration: Robert Tatum raising the Stars and Stripes on the highest  point in North America.    This photograph was exposed upon a previous exposure.]    [Sidenote: The Stars and Stripes]    When the mercurial barometer had been read the tent was thrown down and  abandoned, the first of the series of abandonments that marked our  descent from the mountain. The tent-pole was used for a moment as a  flagstaff while Tatum hoisted a little United States flag he had  patiently and skilfully constructed in our camps below out of two silk  handkerchiefs and the cover of a sewing-bag. Then the pole was put to  its permanent use. It had already been carved with a suitable  inscription, and now a transverse piece, already prepared and fitted,  was lashed securely to it and it was planted on one of the little snow  turrets of the summit--the sign of our redemption, high above North  America. Only some peaks in the Andes and some peaks in the Himalayas  rise above it in all the world. It was of light, dry birch and, though  six feet in length, so slender that we think it may weather many a gale.  And Walter thrust it into the snow so firmly at a blow that it could not  be withdrawn again. Then we gathered about it and said the Te Deum.    [Illustration: The saying of the Te Deum.    This picture was snapped three times instead of once. Karstens' fingers  were freezing and the bulb-release was broken. Only three figures were  in the group.]    It was 1.30 P. M. when we reached the summit and two minutes past three  when we left; yet so quickly had the time flown that we could not  believe we had been an hour and a half on top. The journey down was a  long, weary grind, the longer and the wearier that we made a detour and  went out of our way to seek for Professor Parker's thermometer, which he  had left \"in a crack on the west side of the last boulder of the  northeast ridge.\" That sounds definite enough, yet in fact it is  equivocal. \"Which is the last boulder?\" we disputed as we went down the  slope. A long series of rocks almost in line came to an end, with one  rock a little below the others, a little out of the line. This egregious  boulder would, it seemed to me, naturally be called the last; Karstens  thought not--thought the \"last boulder\" was the last _on_ the ridge. As  we learned later, Karstens was right, and since he yielded to me we did  not find the thermometer, for, having descended to this isolated rock,  we would not climb up again for fifty thermometers. One's disappointment  is qualified by the knowledge that the thermometer is probably not of  adequate scale, Professor Parker's recollection being that it read only  to 60 deg. below zero, F. A lower temperature than this is recorded every  winter on the Yukon River.    [Sidenote: Possible Temperatures]    A thermometer reading to 100 deg. below zero, left at this spot, would,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2607"],[0,"Psmith, Journalist (#15)"],[1," comes from Wyoming!\"    With the opening of round four there came a subtle change. The  Cyclone's fury was expending itself. That long left shot out less  sharply. Instead of being knocked back by it, the _Cosy Moments_  champion now took the hits in his stride, and came shuffling in  with his damaging body-blows. There were cheers and \"Oh, you  Al.'s!\" at the sound of the gong, but there was an appealing note  in them this time. The gallant sportsmen whose connection with  boxing was confined to watching other men fight, and betting on  what they considered a certainty, and who would have expired  promptly if any one had tapped them sharply on their well-filled  waistcoats, were beginning to fear that they might lose their money  after all.    In the fifth round the thing became a certainty. Like the month of  March, the Cyclone, who had come in like a lion, was going out like  a lamb. A slight decrease in the pleasantness of the Kid's smile  was noticeable. His expression began to resemble more nearly the  gloomy importance of the _Cosy Moments_ photographs. Yells of agony  from panic-stricken speculators around the ring began to smite the  rafters. The Cyclone, now but a gentle breeze, clutched repeatedly,  hanging on like a leech till removed by the red-jerseyed referee.    Suddenly a grisly silence fell upon the house. It was broken by a  cow-boy yell from Billy Windsor. For the Kid, battered, but  obviously content, was standing in the middle of the ring, while on  the ropes the Cyclone, drooping like a wet sock, was sliding slowly  to the floor.    \"_Cosy Moments_ wins,\" said Psmith. \"An omen, I fancy, Comrade  Windsor.\"        CHAPTER XV    AN ADDITION TO THE STAFF    Penetrating into the Kid's dressing-room some moments later, the  editorial staff found the winner of the ten-round exhibition bout  between members of the club seated on a chair, having his right leg  rubbed by a shock-headed man in a sweater, who had been one of his  seconds during the conflict. The Kid beamed as they entered.    \"Gents,\" he said, \"come right in. Mighty glad to see you.\"    \"It is a relief to me, Comrade Brady,\" said Psmith, \"to find that  you can see us. I had expected to find that Comrade Wolmann's  purposeful buffs had completely closed your star-likes.\"    \"Sure, I never felt them. He's a good quick boy, is Al., but,\"  continued the Kid with powerful imagery, \"he couldn't hit a hole in  a block of ice-cream, not if he was to use a hammer.\"    \"And yet at one period in the proceedings, Comrade Brady,\" said  Psmith, \"I fancied that your head would come unglued at the neck.  But the fear was merely transient. When you began to administer  those--am I correct in saying?--half-scissor hooks to the body,  why, then I felt like some watcher of the skies when a new planet  swims into his ken; or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes he  stared at the Pacific.\"    The Kid blinked.    \"How's that?\" he inquired.    \"And why did I feel like that, Comrade Brady? I will tell you.  Because my faith in you was justified. Because there before me  stood the ideal fighting-editor of _Cosy Moments_. It is not a post  that any weakling can fill. There charm of manner cannot qualify a  man for the position. No one can hold down the job simply by having  a kind heart or being good at farmyard imitations. No. We want a  man of thews and sinews, a man who would rather be hit on the head  with a half-brick than not. And you, Comrade Brady, are such a  man.\"    The Kid turned appealingly to Billy.    \"Say, this gets past me, Mr. Windsor. Put me wise.\"    \"Can we have a couple of words with you alone, Kid?\" said Billy.  \"We want to talk over something with you.\"    \"Sure. Sit down, gents. Jack'll be through in a minute.\"    Jack, who during this conversation had been concentrating himself  on his subject's left leg, now announced that he guessed that would  about do, and having advised the Kid not to stop and pick daisies,  but to get into his clothes at once before he caught a chill, bade  the company good night and retired.    Billy shut the door.    \"Kid,\" he said, \"you know those articles about the tenements we've  been having in the paper?\"    \"Sure. I read 'em. They're to the good.\"    Psmith bowed.    \"You stimulate us, Comrade Brady. This is praise from Sir Hubert  Stanley.\"    \"It was about time some strong josher came and put it across to  'em,\" added the Kid.    \"So we thought. Comrade Parker, however, totally disagreed with  us.\"    \"Parker?\"    \"That's what I'm coming to,\" said Billy. \"The day before yesterday  a man named Parker called at the office and tried to buy us off.\"    Billy's voice grew indignant at the recollection.    \"You gave him the hook, I guess?\" queried the interested Kid.    \"To such an extent, Comrade Brady,\" said Psmith, \"that he left  breathing threatenings and slaughter. And it is for that reason  that we have ventured to call upon you.\"    \"It's this way,\" said Billy. \"We're pretty sure by this time that  whoever the man is this fellow Parker's working for has put one of  the gangs on to us.\"    \"You don't say!\" exclaimed the Kid. \"Gum! Mr. Windsor, they're  tough propositions, those gangs.\"    \"We've been followed in the streets, and once they put up a bluff  to get us where they could do us in. So we've come along to you. We  can look after ourselves out of the office, you see, but what we  want is some one to help in case they try to rush us there.\"    \"In brief, a fighting-editor,\" said Psmith. \"At all costs we must  have privacy. No writer can prune and polish his sentences to his  satisfaction if he is compelled constantly to break off in order to  eject boisterous hooligans. We therefore offer you the job of  sitting in the outer room and intercepting these bravoes before  they can reach us. The salary we leave to you. There are doubloons  and to spare in the old oak chest. Take what you need and put the  rest--if any--back. How does the offer strike you, Comrade Brady?\"    \"We don't want to get you in under false pretences, Kid,\" said  Billy. \"Of course, they may not come anywhere near the office. But  still, if they did, there would be something doing. What do you  feel about it?\"    \"Gents,\" said the Kid, \"it's this way.\"    He stepped into his coat, and resumed.    \"Now that I've made good by getting the decision over Al., they'll  be giving me a chance of a big fight. Maybe with Jimmy Garvin.  Well, if that happens, see what I mean? I'll have to be going away  somewhere and getting into training. I shouldn't be able to come  and sit with you. But, if you gents feel like it, I'd be mighty  glad to come in till I'm wanted to go into training-camp.\"    \"Great,\" said Billy; \"that would suit us all the way up. If you'd  do that, Kid, we'd be tickled to death.\"    \"And touching salary--\" put in Psmith.    \"Shucks!\" said the Kid with emphasis. \"Nix on the salary thing. I  wouldn't take a dime. If it hadn't a-been for you gents, I'd have  been waiting still for a chance of lining up in the championship  class. That's good enough for me. Any old thing you gents want me  to do, I'll do it. And glad, too.\"    \"Comrade Brady,\" said Psmith warmly, \"you are, if I may say so, the  goods. You are, beyond a doubt, supremely the stuff. We three,  then, hand-in-hand, will face the foe; and if the foe has good,  sound sense, he will keep right away. You appear to be ready. Shall  we meander forth?\"    The building was empty and the lights were out when they emerged  from the dressing-room. They had to grope their way in darkness. It  was still raining when they reached the street, and the only signs  of life were a moist policeman and the distant glare of  public-house lights down the road.    They turned off to the left, and, after walking some hundred yards,  found themselves in a blind alley.    \"Hullo!\" said Billy. \"Where have we come to?\"    Psmith sighed.    \"In my trusting way,\" he said, \"I had imagined that either you or  Comrade Brady was in charge of this expedition and taking me by a  known route to the nearest Subway station. I did not think to ask.  I placed myself, without hesitation, wholly in your hands.\"    \"I thought the Kid knew the way,\" said Billy.    \"I was just taggin' along with you gents,\" protested the  light-weight, \"I thought you was taking me right. This is the first  time I been up here.\"    \"Next time we three go on a little jaunt anywhere,\" said Psmith  resignedly, \"it would be as well to take a map and a corps of  guides with us. Otherwise we shall start for Broadway and finish  up at Minneapolis.\"    They emerged from the blind alley and stood in the dark street,  looking doubtfully up and down it.    \"Aha!\" said Psmith suddenly, \"I perceive a native. Several natives,  in fact. Quite a little covey of them. We will put our case before  them, concealing nothing, and rely on their advice to take us to  our goal.\"    A little knot of men was approaching from the left. In the darkness  it was impossible to say how many of them there were. Psmith  stepped forward, the Kid at his side.    \"Excuse me, sir,\" he said to the leader, \"but if you can spare me a  moment of your valuable time--\"    There was a sudden shuffle of feet on the pavement, a quick  movement on the part of the Kid, a chunky sound as of wood striking  wood, and the man Psmith had been addressing fell to the ground in  a heap.    As he fell, something dropped from his hand on to the pavement with  a bump and a rattle. Stooping swiftly, the Kid picked it up, and  handed it to Psmith. His fingers closed upon it. It was a short,  wicked-looking little bludgeon, the black-jack of the New York  tough.    \"Get busy,\" advised the Kid briefly.        CHAPTER XVI    THE FIRST BATTLE    The promptitude and despatch with which the Kid had attended to the  gentleman with the black-jack had not been without its effect on  the followers of the stricken one. Physical courage is not an  outstanding quality of the New York hooligan."]]]
