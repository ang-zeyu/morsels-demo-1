Sure yours flew away thayre. I saw them settle hayer and  thought I'd make sure of wan with the rifle.\"    A careful examination showed that a rifle-ball as well as a charge of  shot had struck the Pigeon. The gunners had fired on the same bird.  Both enjoyed the joke, though it had its serious side, for food as well  as ammunition was scarce in that backwoods home.    Corney, a superb specimen of a six-foot Irish-Canadian in early  manhood, now led away to the log shanty where the very scarcity of  luxuries and the roughness of their lives were sources of merriment.  For the Colts, though born and bred in the backwoods of Canada, had  lost nothing of the spirit that makes the Irish blood a world-wide  synonym of heartiness and wit.    Corney was the eldest son of a large family. The old folks lived at  Petersay, twenty-five miles to the southward. He had taken up a \"claim\"  to carve his own home out of the woods at Fenebonk, and his grown  sisters, Margat, staid and reliable, and Loo, bright and witty, were  keeping house for him. Thorburn Alder was visiting them. He had just  recovered from a severe illness and had been sent to rough it in the  woods in hope of winning some of the vigor of his hosts. Their home was  of unhewn logs, unfloored, and roofed with sods, which bore a luxuriant  crop of grass and weeds. The primitive woods around were broken in two  places: one where the roughest of roads led southward to Petersay; the  other where the sparkling lake rolled on a pebbly shore and gave a  glimpse of their nearest neighbor's house--four miles across the water.    Their daily round had little change. Corney was up at daybreak to light  the fire, call his sisters, and feed the horses while they prepared  breakfast. At six the meal was over and Corney went to his work. At  noon, which Margat knew by the shadow of a certain rampike falling on  the spring, a clear notification to draw fresh water for the table, Loo  would hang a white rag on a pole, and Corney, seeing the signal, would  return from summer fallow or hayfield, grimy, swarthy, and ruddy, a  picture of manly vigor and honest toil. Thor might be away all day, but  at night, when they again assembled at the table, he would come from  lake or distant ridge and eat a supper like the dinner and breakfast,  for meals as well as days were exact repeats: pork, bread, potatoes,  and tea, with occasionally eggs supplied by a dozen hens around the  little log stable, with, rarely, a variation of wild meat, for Thor was  not a hunter and Corney had little time for anything but the farm.      II    THE LYNX    A huge four-foot basswood had gone the way of all trees. Death had been  generous--had sent the three warnings: it was the biggest of its kind,  its children were grown up, it was hollow. The wintry blast that sent  it down had broken it across and revealed a great hole where should  have been its heart. A long wooden cavern in the middle of a sunny  opening, it now lay, and presented an ideal home for a Lynx when she  sought a sheltered nesting-place for her coming brood.    Old was she and gaunt, for this was a year of hard times for the  Lynxes. A Rabbit plague the autumn before had swept away their main  support; a winter of deep snow and sudden crusts had killed off nearly  all the Partridges; a long wet spring had destroyed the few growing  coveys and had kept the ponds and streams so full that Fish and Frogs  were safe from their armed paws, and this mother Lynx fared no better  than her kind.    The little ones--half starved before they came--were a double drain,  for they took the time she might have spent in hunting.    The Northern Hare is the favorite food of the Lynx, and in some years  she could have killed fifty in one day, but never one did she see this  season. The plague had done its work too well.    One day she caught a Red-squirrel which had run into a hollow log that  proved a trap. Another day a fetid Blacksnake was her only food. A day  was missed, and the little ones whined piteously for their natural food  and failing drink. One day she saw a large black animal of unpleasant  but familiar smell. Swiftly and silently she sprang to make attack. She  struck it once on the nose, but the Porcupine doubled his head under,  his tail flew up, and the mother Lynx was speared in a dozen places  with the little stinging javelins. She drew them all with her teeth,  for she had \"learned Porcupine\" years before, and only the hard push of  want would have made her strike one now.    A Frog was all she caught that day. On the next, as she ranged the  farthest woods in a long, hard hunt, she heard a singular calling  voice. It was new to her. She approached it cautiously, up wind, got  many new odors and some more strange sounds in coming. The loud, clear,  rolling call was repeated as the mother Lynx came to an opening in the  forest. In the middle of it were two enormous muskrat or beaver-houses,  far bigger than the biggest she ever before had seen. They were made  partly of logs and situated, not in a pond, but on a dry knoll. Walking  about them were a number of Partridges, that is, birds like Partridges,  only larger and of various colors, red, yellow, and white.    She quivered with the excitement that in a man would have been called  buck-fever. Food--food--abundance of food, and the old huntress sank to  earth. Her breast was on the ground, her elbows above her back, as she  made stalk, her shrewdest, subtlest stalk; one of those Partridges she  must have at any price; no trick now must go untried, no error in this  hunt; if it took hours--all day--she must approach with certainty to  win before the quarry took to flight.    Only a few bounds it was from wood shelter to the great rat-house, but  she was an hour in crawling that small space. From stump to brush, from  log to bunch of grass she sneaked, a flattened form, and the Partridges  saw her not. They fed about, the biggest uttering the ringing call that  first had fallen on her ear.    Once they seemed to sense their peril, but a long await dispelled the  fear. Now they were almost in reach, and she trembled with all the  eagerness of the hunting heart and the hungry maw. Her eye centred on a  white one not quite the nearest, but the color seemed to hold her gaze.    There was an open space around the rat-house; outside that were tall  weeds, and stumps were scattered everywhere. The white bird wandered  behind these weeds, the red one of the loud voice flew to the top of  the rat-mound and sang as before. The mother Lynx sank lower yet. It  seemed an alarm note; but no, the white one still was there; she could  see its feathers gleaming through the weeds. An open space now lay  about. The huntress, flattened like an empty skin, trailed slow and  silent on the ground behind a log no thicker than her neck; if she  could reach that tuft of brush she could get unseen to the weeds and  then would be near enough to spring. She could smell them now--the rich  and potent smell of life, of flesh and blood, that set her limbs  a-tingle and her eyes a-glow.    The Partridges still scratched and fed; another flew to the high top,  but the white one remained. Five more slow-gliding, silent steps, and  the Lynx was behind the weeds, the white bird shining through; she  gauged the distance, tried the footing, swung her hind legs to clear  some fallen brush, then leaped direct with all her force, and the white  one never knew the death it died, for the fateful gray shadow dropped,  the swift and deadly did their work, and before the other birds could  realize the foe or fly, the Lynx was gone, with the white bird  squirming in her jaws.    Uttering an unnecessary growl of inborn ferocity and joy she bounded  into the forest, and bee-like sped for home. The last quiver had gone  from the warm body of the victim when she heard the sound of heavy feet  ahead. She leaped on a log. The wings of her prey were muffling her  eyes, so she laid the bird down and held it safely with one paw. The  sound drew nearer, the bushes bent, and a Boy stepped into view. The  old Lynx knew and hated his kind. She had watched them at night, had  followed them, had been hunted and hurt by them. For a moment they  stood face to face. The huntress growled a warning that was also a  challenge and a defiance, picked up the bird and bounded from the log  into the sheltering bushes. It was a mile or two to the den, but she  stayed not to eat till the sunlit opening and the big basswood came to  view; then a low \"prr-prr\" called forth the little ones to revel with  their mother in a plenteous meal of the choicest food.      III    THE HOME OF THE LYNX    At first Thor, being town-bred, was timid about venturing into the  woods beyond the sound of Corney's axe; but day by day he went farther,  guiding himself, not by unreliable moss on trees, but by sun, compass,  and landscape features. His purpose was to learn about the wild animals  rather than to kill them; but the naturalist is close kin to the  sportsman, and the gun was his constant companion. In the clearing, the  only animal of any size was a fat Woodchuck; it had a hole under a  stump some hundred yards from the shanty. On sunny mornings it used to  lie basking on the stump, but eternal vigilance is the price of every  good thing in the woods. The Woodchuck was always alert and Thor tried  in vain to shoot or even to trap him.    \"Hyar,\" said Corney one morning, \"time we had some fresh meat.\" He took  down his rifle, an old-fashioned brass-mounted small-bore, and loading  with care that showed the true rifleman, he steadied the weapon against  the door-jamb and fired. The Woodchuck fell backward and lay still.  Thor raced to the place and returned in triumph with the animal,  shouting: \"Plumb through the head--one"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22849"],[0,"The History of Tasmania , Volume II (#15)"],[1,"the slipperiness of the foe gave the air of mock heroism to  the service, the watchers of the line were reminded, by frequent tidings  from homeward, that their enemy was strong enough to deal death to the  aged and the innocent. Four blacks, who crossed the line, and hung upon  its rear, inflicted terrible vengeance. One attacked a settler, who  returned a mortal wound with a pitchfork. The survivors hovered about  the place to avenge his death: they at length found a victim in an  amiable young lady, Miss Peters; who was speared in the breast. She  felt, from the first, that the wound was mortal, and calmly resigned  herself to her destiny. Others, left by their friends and dependants,  were liable to the same perils: of this, Mr. Gildas, a settler on the  Tamar, was a remarkable instance: he had sent his men to the line, and  was thus alone. He left his house to seek for fire-wood, and was  speared. The savages plundered his house, and defaced the pictures on  the walls. A pilot, calling at his dwelling, found it pillaged and  desolate. This man was at the battle of Trafalgar, and present when  Nelson fell--himself reserved to perish in Tasmania, by savage hands.    The division under Captain Donaldson, which followed up the main body of  the forces, arrived on the 31st of October. Colonel Arthur issued from  the camp (Sorell Rivulet), a statement that the final decisive movement  was at hand, and that those who had been exposed to great privations,  would soon be released to their homes. Having been compelled to await  reinforcements, the campaign had been unavoidably prolonged: to have  moved without them, would have risked the success of the enterprise; the  two dangerous tribes would attempt to escape, and the forces in charge  were exhorted to redouble their vigilance, to prevent their breaking  through the position.    These notices indicate a confidence of success, doomed to  disappointment. To the precipitation of Mr. Walpole's party, Colonel  Arthur attributed the failure of the expedition. They were instructed  not to attempt a capture, unless a considerable number could be taken;  but the sight of the slumbering enemy probably suspended the  recollection of this order, and was one of those casualties which could  hardly be avoided, in such a wide distribution of command. It was on the  22nd of October this misfortune happened: the natives were discovered  hunting, and were watched, until their evening fires were formed for the  night. No noise being heard, Mr. Walpole supposed they had taken an  alarm, and advanced at twilight towards the first hut, where he saw five  blacks, with their dogs, fast asleep. He seized one man by the feet, and  after a severe struggle detained him: a boy, ornamented with figures on  his body, about fifteen years of age, shared the same lot; but two  others were shot: the remainder fled. The quantity of spears and baskets  left behind, proved that their flight was sudden, and their numbers  considerable.    An attempt was made by the natives to cross the line on the 27th  October. The sentry had set down his piece, and was putting some wood  on the fire, when a spear was thrown at him: he threw the billet in his  hand, and was reaching his musket when he received another spear; an  alarm being given to an adjoining party, the blacks were driven back, of  whom, however, six only were seen.    A circumstance occurred, which strongly confirmed the impression, that  some treacherous whites had directed the natives. In pursuing them as  far as the isthmus, they discovered in their tracks the impression of  shoe-nails, and other evidence of the presence of white men. The reports  were soon spread, that the Oyster Bay and Big River tribes were in the  rear. The hopes of the colony rapidly gave way, and the Governor,  writing to the Secretary of State, on the 21st of November, intimated  his suspicion that the movement would be in vain.    These reports were, indeed, constantly circulated, and tended to damp  the ardour and diminish the vigilance of the line. Some scouring parties  from Norfolk Plains fell in with a tribe of forty, whom they pursued  beyond the Shannon. They followed them for three days, but were  compelled to return: the blacks, in their progress, had surprised a  settler, and murdered him. The rumours of escape were aggravated by  imagination: a party of the whites were seen by some sawyers, who ran  away and reported them as natives; and it was several days before they  could be persuaded of their error.    The settlers, worn out with fatigue and longing for their homes, were  impatient to advance, and afforded ample opportunities for concealment  and escape. Among the rest a place is noticed, which enabled the natives  to defy intrusion or discovery, near the \"Three Thumbs' Mountain,\"--an  almost impenetrable forest, of seven miles extent: the spreading  branches obscure the sky, and lofty plants grow entwined, and conceal an  object at the distance of a few feet. The attempt of the blacks to cross  the line discovered their retreat. It was resolved to assemble forces  sufficient to surround, break through, and storm this thicket: it was  penetrated by about 300 men, who kept up a constant fire of musketry. A  party, hearing the rustling of leaves like the noise of cattle, followed  the sound: they came up to an encampment, where the fires were  unextinguished, and where half-formed weapons indicated a hasty  dispersion. Here they found the impression of nails, and what were  deemed sure proofs of a superior directing intelligence. The  presumption, that some convicts were incorporated with the blacks, was  certainly strong, but it was probably but a temporary or casual  intercourse, of not much utility to the natives. The Governor had,  however, a full conviction that to this circumstance the failure might  be partly ascribed. In the middle of the march, he ordered the  publication of a report, which appeared decisive of the fact. Savage, a  servant of Mr. Bisdee, was met half naked by the Governor, near Mills'  Lagoon, to whom he stated he had been surrounded by a tribe, and rescued  from violence by a man named Brown, who was with them. This person he  had known in gaol. Savage advised Brown to bring in the natives, but he  refused: he said that he had been frequently at Hobart Town, where he  had bought clothes for the women: he had a double-barrelled gun, and  seemed to have complete control over them. They carried Savage with them  as far as Mills' Lagoon, when he was told he might go. The Governor and  his party instantly set off in the pursuit, but they discovered no  traces of the natives. The truth of this narrative has been questioned,  yet from the number of points in which a correct memory, or  extraordinary powers of invention would be requisite, the Governor might  have easily detected imposition. The man stated that fright cured him of  rheumatism; his rags were consistent with his story. It is, however, the  only clear testimony to the presence of white men with the blacks at  that period.    On the 26th of November, it was announced by the Governor, that the  first series of operations was brought to a close; and except a few,  requisite to protect the country, the colonists and their servants were  released, and the town guards replaced.[17]    Those who had condemned the plan, now censured its precipitate  abandonment: they said that hundreds of blacks were enclosed when the  troops were withdrawn. It is not likely, however, that the Governor was  deceived on this point. It is certain that many blacks were in the rear,  and the dispersion of the force was equal to a confession, that the  object was impracticable--that it had failed.    Thus closed the Black War. This campaign of a month, supplied many  adventures, and many an amusing tale; and, notwithstanding the gravity  of his Excellency, much fun and folly. The settler soldiers returned  to their homes, their shoes worn out, their garments tattered, their  hair long and shaggy, with beards unshaven, their arms tarnished;  but neither blood-stained nor disgraced. They had seen much and dreaded  more; but, in general, they met no other enemies than scrub and thorns,  and they sat down on their own hearths, happy in having escaped the  ramrods of their friends. The odd tactics, awkward movements--the  skulking and the foraging, and all the various small accomplishments of  a bivouac, were long topics of conversation and laughter. The accidents  were few, though of these some were fatal: two aborigines only were  captured, and one soldier was wounded. Yet though not very glorious,  perhaps no evening in the year passes, but some settler's fireside is  enlivened by a story of the fatigues and frolics of the Black War.    When the last movement was completing, the _Science_ sailed for England  with despatches from Colonel Arthur: they indicate his expectation of a  failure, and scarcely conceal his mortification. Either the original  impossibility of the plan, or the indolence or incaution of those who  carried it out, had exposed the government to more than ridicule. Five  thousand men had taken the field, beside the town guard. Nearly L30,000  had been expended, and probably not much less value in time and outlay  by the settlers, and two persons only were captured! Those who  prophecied the result, of course exulted in their sagacity: for the  rest, they either praised the motive or the details. An impartial  retrospect will not permit a commendation of the plan. The arrangements  were ably made, and the parties, though they encountered difficulties  unusual, reached the appointed places with considerable precision.    A public meeting was called to thank the Governor for his exertions in  the field. This assembly was summoned, says the chronicler of the times,  by the largest placard ever published in the colony! The resolutions and  addresses were nearly unanimous; Mr. Gregson "]]]
