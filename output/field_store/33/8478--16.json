[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28536"],[0,"The Astronomy of the Bible (#15)"],[1," simpler  peoples the difference between the \"light half\" of the month, from the  first quarter to the last quarter through the full of the moon, and the  \"dark half,\" from the last quarter to the first quarter, through new, is  very great. Indian astronomers so divide the month to this day.    In one passage of Holy Scripture, the description which Isaiah gives of  the \"City of the Lord, the Zion of the Holy One of Israel,\" there is a  reference to the dark part of the month.         \"Thy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon       (literally \"month\") withdraw itself: for the Lord shall be       thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be       ended.\"    The parallelism expressed in the verse lies between the darkness of  night whilst the sun is below the horizon, and the special darkness of  those nights when the moon, being near conjunction with the sun, is  absent from the sky during the greater part or whole of the night hours,  and has but a small portion of her disc illuminated. Just as half the  day is dark because the sun has withdrawn itself, so half the nights of  the month are dark because the moon has withdrawn itself.    The Hebrew month was a natural one, determined by actual observation of  the new moon. They used three words in their references to the moon, the  first of which, _chodesh_, derived from a root meaning \"to be new,\"  indicates the fact that the new moon, as actually observed, governed  their calendar. The word therefore signifies the new moon--the day of  the new moon: and thus a month; that is, a lunar month beginning at the  new moon. This is the Hebrew word used in the Deluge story in the  seventh chapter of Genesis; and in all references to feasts depending on  a day in the month. As when the Lord spake to Moses, saying, \"Also in  the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and in the beginnings  of your months, ye shall blow with your trumpets over your burnt  offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings.\" And again  in the Psalm of Asaph to the chief musician upon Gittith: \"Blow up the  trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast  day.\" This is the word also that Isaiah uses in describing the bravery  of the daughters of Zion, \"the tinkling ornaments about their feet, and  their cauls, and their round tires like the moon, the chains, and the  bracelets.\" \"The round tires\" were not discs, like the full moon, but  were round like the crescent.    Generally speaking, _chodesh_ is employed where either reference is made  to the shape or newness of the crescent moon, or where \"month\" is used  in any precise way. This is the word for \"month\" employed throughout by  the prophet Ezekiel, who is so precise in the dating of his prophecies.    When the moon is mentioned as the lesser light of heaven, without  particular reference to its form, or when a month is mentioned as a  somewhat indefinite period of time, then the Hebrew word _yar[=e]ach_,  is used. Here the word has the root meaning of \"paleness\"; it is the  \"silver moon.\"    _Yar[=e]ach_ is the word always used where the moon is classed among the  heavenly bodies; as when Joseph dreamed of the sun, the moon, and the  eleven constellations; or in Jer. viii. 2, where the Lord says that they  shall bring out the bones of the kings, princes, priests, prophets, and  inhabitants of Jerusalem, \"and they shall spread them before the sun,  and the moon, and all the host of heaven, whom they have loved, and whom  they have served, and after whom they have walked, and whom they have  sought, and whom they have worshipped.\"    The same word is used for the moon in its character of \"making  ordinances.\" Thus we have it several times in the Psalms: \"He (the Lord)  appointed the moon for seasons.\" \"His seed shall endure for ever, and  his throne as the sun before Me. It shall be established for ever as the  moon, and as a faithful witness in heaven.\" And again: \"The moon and  stars rule by night;\" whilst Jeremiah says, \"Thus saith the Lord, Which  giveth the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of  the stars for a light by night.\"    In all passages where reference seems to be made to the darkening or  withdrawing of the moon's light (Eccl. xii. 2; Isa. xiii. 10; Ezek.  xxxii. 7; Joel ii. 10, 31, and iii. 15; and Hab. iii. 11) the word  _yar[=e]ach_ is employed. A slight variant of the same word indicates  the month when viewed as a period of time not quite defined, and not in  the strict sense of a lunar month. This is the term used in Exod. ii. 2,  for the three months that the mother of Moses hid him when she saw that  he was a goodly child; by Moses, in his prophecy for Joseph, of \"Blessed  of the Lord be his land . . . for the precious fruits brought forth by  the sun, and for the precious things put forth by the months.\" Such a  \"full month of days\" did Shallum the son of Jabesh reign in Samaria in  the nine and thirtieth year of Uzziah, king of Judah. Such also were the  twelve months of warning given to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon,  before his madness fell upon him. The same word is once used for a true  lunar month, viz. in Ezra vi. 15, when the building of the \"house was  finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year  of the reign of Darius the king.\" In all other references to the months  derived from the Babylonians, such as the \"month Chisleu\" in Neh. i. 1,  the term _chodesh_ is used, since these, like the Hebrew months, were  defined by the observation of the new moon; but for the Tyrian months,  Zif, Bul, Ethanim, we find the term _yerach_ in three out of the four  instances.    In three instances a third word is used poetically to express the moon.  This is _lebanah_, which has the meaning of whiteness. In Song of Sol.  vi. 10, it is asked--         \"Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the       moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?\"    Isaiah also says--         \"Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when       the Lord of Hosts shall reign in Mount Zion, and in Jerusalem,       and before His ancients gloriously.\"    And yet again--         \"Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the       sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light       of seven days, in the day that the Lord bindeth up the breach       of His people, and healeth the stroke of their wound.\"    It may not be without significance that each of these three passages,  wherein the moon is denominated by its name of whiteness or purity,  looks forward prophetically to the same great event, pictured yet more  clearly in the Revelation--         \"And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as       the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty       thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent       reigneth.         \"Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to Him: for the       marriage of the Lamb is come, and His wife hath made herself       ready.         \"And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine       linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the       righteousness of saints.\"    _Chodesh_ and _yar[=e]ach_ are masculine words; _lebanah_ is feminine.  But nowhere throughout the Old Testament is the moon personified, and in  only one instance is it used figuratively to represent a person. This is  in the case of Jacob's reading of Joseph's dream, already referred to,  where he said--         \"Behold I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and       the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.\"    And his father quickly rebuked him, saying--         \"What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy       mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to       thee to the earth?\"    Here Jacob understands that the moon (_yar[=e]ach_) stands for a woman,  his wife. But in Mesopotamia, whence his grandfather Abraham had come  out, Sin, the moon-god, was held to be a male god, high indeed among the  deities at that time, and superior even to Samas, the sun-god. Terah,  the father of Abraham, was held by Jewish tradition to have been an  especial worshipper of the moon-god, whose great temple was in Haran,  where he dwelt.    Wherever the land of Uz may have been, at whatever period Job may have  lived, there and then it was an iniquity to worship the moon or the  moon-god. In his final defence to his friends, when the \"three men  ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes,\" Job,  justifying his life, said--         \"If I beheld the sun when it shined,        Or the moon walking in brightness;        And my heart hath been secretly enticed,        And my mouth hath kissed my hand:        This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judges:        For I should have lied to God that is above.\"    The Hebrews, too, were forbidden to worship the sun, the moon, or the  stars, the host of heaven, and disobeyed the commandment both early and  late in their history. When Moses spake unto all Israel on this side  Jordan in the wilderness in the plain over against the Red Sea, he said  to them--         \"The Lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye       heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only       ye heard a voice. . . . Take ye therefore good heed unto       yourselves; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that       the Lord spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire:         \"Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the       similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female. . . .       And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou       seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host       of heaven, shouldst be driven to worship them, and serve them,       which the Lord thy God hath divided unto all nations under the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28540"],[0,"Bibliomania; or Book-Madness (#15)"],[1,"peaceful abodes to be inlaid by the side of some  spruce, modern engraving, within an ILLUSTRATED GRANGER! Nor did the  madness stop here. Illustration was the order of the day; and  Shakspeare[53] and Clarendon[54] became the next objects of its  attack. From these it has glanced off in a variety of directions, to  adorn the pages of humbler wights; and the passion, or rather this  symptom of the Bibliomania,[55] yet rages with undiminished force. If  judiciously[56] treated, it is, of all the symptoms, the least liable  to mischief. To possess a series of well executed portraits of  illustrious men, at different periods of their lives, from blooming  boyhood to phlegmatic old age, is sufficiently amusing[57]; but to  possess _every_ portrait, _bad, indifferent, and unlike_, betrays  such a dangerous and alarming symptom as to render the case almost  incurable!         [Footnote 52: It was first published in two quarto volumes,       1766; and went through several editions in octavo. The last       is, I believe, of the date of 1804; to which three       additional volumes were published by William Noble, in 1806;       the whole seven volumes form what is called an excellent       library work.]         [Footnote 53: About two or three years ago there was an       extraordinary set of prints disposed of, for the       illustration of Shakspeare, collected by a gentleman in       Cornwall, with considerable taste and judgment. Lord       Spencer's beautiful octavo illustrated Shakespeare,       bequeathed to him by the late Mr. Steevens, has been       enriched, since it came into the library of its present       noble possessor, with many a rare and many a beauteous       specimen of the graphic art.]         [Footnote 54: I have heard of an illustrated Clarendon       (which was recently in the metropolis), that has been valued       at 5000 Guineas! \"a good round sum!\"]         [Footnote 55: One of the most striking and splendid       instances of the present rage for illustration may be seen       in Mr. Miller's own copy of the Historical Work of Mr. Fox,       in two volumes, imperial quarto. Exclusively of a great       variety of Portraits, it is enriched with the original       drawing of Mr. Fox's bust from which the print, attached to       the publication, is taken; and has also many original notes       and letters by its illustrious author. Mr. Walter Scott's       edition of Dryden has also received, by the same publisher,       a similar illustration. It is on large paper, and most       splendidly bound in blue morocco, containing upwards of 650       portraits.]         [Footnote 56: The fine copy of Granger, illustrated by the       late Mr. Bull, is now in the library of the Marquis of Bute,       at Lutton. It extends to 37 atlas folio volumes, and is a       repository of almost every rare and beautiful print, which       the diligence of its late, and the skill, taste, and       connoisseurship of its present, noble owner have brought       together.]         [Footnote 57: In the Memoirs of Mr. Thomas Hollis there is a       series of the portraits of Milton (not executed in the best       manner) done in this way; and a like series of Pope's       portraits accompanies the recent edition of the poet's works       by the Rev. W.L. Bowles.]    There is another mode of illustrating copies by which this symptom of  the Bibliomania may be known: it consists in bringing together, from  different works, [by means of the scissors, or otherwise by  transcription] every page or paragraph which has any connection with  the character or subject under discussion. This is a useful and  entertaining mode of illustrating a favourite author; and copies of  works of this nature, when executed by skilful[58] hands, should be  preserved in public repositories. I almost ridiculed the idea of an  ILLUSTRATED CHATTERTON, in this way, till I saw Mr. Haslewood's copy,  in twenty-one volumes, which rivetted me to my seat!         [Footnote 58: Numerous are the instances of the peculiar use       and value of copies of this kind, especially to those who       are engaged in publication, of a similar nature. Oldys's       interleaved Langbaine is re-echoed in almost every recent       work connected with the belles-lettres of our country. Oldys       himself was unrivalled in this method of illustration; if,       besides his Langbaine, his copy of 'Fuller's Worthies' [once       Mrs. Steevens's, now Mr. Malone's, See Bibl. Steevens,       no. 1799] be alone considered! This Oldys was the oddest       mortal that ever scribbled for bread. Grose, in his _Olio_,       gives an amusing account of his having \"a number of small       parchment bags inscribed with the names of the persons whose       lives he intended to write; into which he put every       circumstance and anecdote he could collect, and thence drew       up his history.\" See Noble's _College of Arms_, p. 420.         Of illustrated copies in this way, the Suidas of Kuster,       belonging to the famous D'Orville, is a memorable instance.       This is now in the Bodleian library. I should suppose that       one Narcissus Luttrell, in Charles the Second's reign, had a       number of like illustrated copies. His collection of       contemporaneous literature must have been immense, as we may       conclude from the account of it in Mr. Walter Scott's       Preface to his recent edition of Dryden's works. Luckily for       this brilliant poet and editor, a part of Luttrell's       collection had found its way into the libraries of Mr.       Bindley and Mr. Heber, and thence was doomed to shine, with       renewed lustre, by the side of the poetry of Dryden.]    IV. _Unique Copies._ A passion for a book which has any peculiarity  about it, by either, or both, of the foregoing methods of  illustration--or which is remarkable for its size, beauty, and  condition--is indicative of a rage for _unique copies_, and is  unquestionably a strong prevailing symptom of the Bibliomania. Let me  therefore urge every sober and cautious collector not to be fascinated  by the terms \"_Matchless, and Unique_;\" which, \"in slim Italicks\" (to  copy Dr. Ferriar's happy expression) are studiously introduced into  Bookseller's catalogues to lead the unwary astray. Such a Collector  may fancy himself proof against the temptation; and will, in  consequence, _call only to look at_ this unique book, or set of books;  but, when he views the morocco binding, silk water-tabby lining,  blazing gilt edges--when he turns over the white and spotless  leaves--gazes on the amplitude of margin--on a rare and lovely print  introduced--and is charmed with the soft and coaxing manner in which,  by the skill of Herring or Mackinlay,[59] \"leaf succeeds to leaf\"--he  can no longer bear up against the temptation--and, confessing himself  vanquished, purchases, and retreats--exclaiming with Virgil's  shepherd--         Ut vidi, ut perii--ut me malus abstulit error!         [Footnote 59: At page 8, note--the reader has been led to       expect a few remarks upon the luxuriancy of modern       book-binding. Mr. Roscoe, in his Lorenzo de Medici, vol.       ii., p. 79., edit. 8vo., has defended the art with so much       skill that nothing further need be said in commendation of       it. Admitting every degree of merit to our present       fashionable binders, and frankly allowing them the       superiority over De Rome, Padaloup, and the old school of       binding, I cannot but wish to see revived those beautiful       portraits, arabesque borders, and sharp angular ornaments,       that are often found on the outsides of books bound in the       16th century, with calf leather, upon oaken boards. These       brilliant decorations almost make us forget the ivory       crucifix, guarded with silver doors, which is frequently       introduced in the interior of the sides of the binding. Few       things are more gratifying to a genuine collector than a       fine copy of a book in its _original binding_!]    V. _Copies printed on vellum._ A desire for works printed in this  manner is an equally strong and general symptom of the Bibliomania;  but as these works are rarely to be obtained of modern[60] date, the  collector is obliged to have recourse to specimens, executed three  centuries ago, in the printing-offices of Aldus, Verard, and the  Juntae. Although the Bibliotheque Imperiale, at Paris, and the library  of Count Macarty, at Toulouse, are said to contain the greatest number  of books printed upon vellum, yet, those who have been fortunate  enough to see copies of this kind in the libraries of his Majesty, the  Duke of Marlborough, Earl Spencer, Mr. Johnes, and the late Mr.  Cracherode (now in the British Museum), need not travel on the  Continent for the sake of being convinced of their exquisite beauty  and splendour. Mr. Edward's _unique_ copy (he will forgive the  epithet) of the first Livy, upon vellum, is a Library of itself!--and  the recent discovery of a vellum copy of Wynkyn De Worde's reprint of  _Juliana Barnes's book_,[61] complete in every respect, [to say  nothing of his Majesty's similar copy of Caxton's _Doctrinal of  Sapience_, 1489, in the finest preservation] are, to be sure,  sufficient demonstrations of the prevalence of this symptom of the  Bibliomania in the times of our forefathers; so that it cannot be  said, as some have asserted, to have appeared entirely within the last  half century.         [Footnote 60: The modern books, printed upon vellum, have in       general not succeeded; whether from the art of preparing the       vellum, or of printing upon it, being lost I will not       presume to determine. The reader may be amused with the       following prices for which a few works, executed in this       manner, were sold in the year 1804:         NO.
