These joints were  satisfactory at first, but did not last; the length of the joint is  not stated.  The difficulty was finally got over by soldering very  narrow platinum tubes into the steel, and fusing the former into the  glass.    Mr. Griffiths has since used an alloy with success as a cement, but I  cannot discover what it is made from. Many years ago Professor Hittorf  prepared good high vacuum tubes by plugging the ends of glass tubes  with sealing wax merely, though in all cases the spaces to be filled  with wax were long and narrow (Hittorf, Pogg.  Ann.  1869, Sec. 5,  English translation, Phys.  Soc.  p.  113).  Again, Regnault  habitually used brass ferules, and cemented glass into them by means  of his mastic, which can still be procured at a low rate from his  instrument-makers (Golan, Paris).  Lenard also, in his investigations  on Cathode Rays (Wied.  Ann, vol.  li.  p.  224), made use of sealing  wax covered with marine glue.    Surely in face of these facts we must admit that cement joints can be  made with fair success.  I do not know the composition of M.  Regnault's mastic, but Faraday (Manipulations, Sec. 1123) gives the  following receipt for a cement for joining ferules to retorts, etc:    Resin                             5 parts.    Beeswax                           1 part.    Red ochre or Venetian red,  finely powdered and sifted        1 part.    I believe this to be substantially the same as Regnault's mastic,  though I have never analysed the latter.    For chemical work the possibility of evolution of gas from such a  cement must be taken into account, and I should certainly not trust it  for this reason in vacuum tube work, where the purity of the confined  gas could come in question.  Otherwise it is an excellent cement, and  does not in my experience tend to crack away from glass to the same  extent as paraffin or pure shellac.    This cracking away from glass, by the way, is probably an effect of  difference in rate of expansion between the glass and cement which  probably always exists, and, if the cement be not sufficiently  viscous, must, beyond certain temperature limits, either produce  cracks or cause separation.  Professor Wright of Yale has used a hard  mineral pitch as a cement in vacuum work with success.    My attention has been directed to a fusible metal cement containing  mercury, and made according to the following receipt, given by Mr. S.  G.  Rawson, Journal of the Society of Chemical Industry, vol.  ix.  (1890), P.  150:-    Bismuth         40 per cent    Lead             25 per cent    Tin             10 per cent    Cadmium         10 per cent    Mercury         15 per cent    This is practically one form of Rose's fusible metal with 15 per cent  mercury added.  It takes nearly an hour to set completely, and the  apparatus must be clean and warm before it is applied.    As the result of several trials by myself and friends, I am afraid I  must dissent from the claim of the author that such a cement will make  a really air-tight joint between glass tubes.  Indeed, the appearance  of the surface as viewed through the glass is not such as to give any  confidence, no matter what care may have been exercised in performing  all the operations and cleaning the glass;  besides which the cement  is rigid when cold, and the expansion difficulty comes in.    On the other hand, if extreme air-tightness is not an object, the  cement is strong and easily applied, and has many uses.  I have an  idea that if the joints were covered with a layer of soft wax, the  result would be satisfactory in so far as air-tightness is concerned.    This anticipation has since been verified.    In many cases one can resort to the device already mentioned of  enclosing a rubber or tape-wrapped joint between two tubes in a bath  of mercury, but in this case the glass must be clean and hot and the  mercury also warm, dry, and pure when the joint is put together,  otherwise an appreciable air film is left against the glass, and this  may creep into the joint.    Perhaps the easiest way of making such a joint is to use an outer tube  of thin clean glass, and bore a narrow hole into it from one side to  admit the mercury;  if the mercury is to be heated in vacuo, it is  better to seal on a side joint.  It is always better, if possible, to  boil the mercury in situ, which involves making the wrapping of  asbestos, but, after all, we come back to the position I began by  taking up, viz.  that the easiest and most reliable method is by  fusion of the glass--all the rest are unsuitable for work of real  precision.    I should be ungrateful, however, were I not to devote a few lines to  the great convenience and merit of so-called \"centering cement.\" This  substance has two or three very valuable properties.  It is very tough  and strong in itself, and it remains plastic on cooling for some time  before it really sets.  If for any reason a small tube has to be  cemented into a larger one, which is a good deal larger, so that an  appreciable mass of cement is necessary, and particularly if the joint  requires to have great mechanical strength, this cement is invaluable.  I have even used a plug of it instead of a cork for making the joint  between a gas delivery tube and a calcium chloride tower.  (Why are  these affairs made with such abominable tubulures?)    The joint in question has never allowed the tube to sag though it  projects horizontally to a distance of 6 inches, and has had to  withstand nearly two years of Sydney temperature.  The cement consists  of a mixture of shellac and 10 per cent of oil of cassia.    The shellac is first melted in an iron ladle, and the oil of cassia  quickly added and stirred in, to an extent of about 10 per cent, but  the exact proportions are not of importance.  Great care must be taken  not to overheat the shellac.    APPENDIX TO CHAPTER I    ON THE PREPARATION OF VACUUM TUBES FOR THE PRODUCTION OF PROFESSOR  ROENTGEN'S RADIATION    [Footnote: Written in May 1896.]    WHEN Professor Roentgen's discovery was first announced at the end of  1895 much difficulty was experienced in obtaining radiation of the  requisite intensity for the repetition of his experiments.  The  following notes on the production of vacuum tubes of the required  quality may therefore be of use to those who desire to prepare their  own apparatus.  It appears that flint glass is much more opaque to  Roentgen's radiation than soda glass, and consequently the vacuum  tubes require to be prepared from the latter material.    Fig. 39.    A form of vacuum tube  which has proved very successful in the  author's hands is sketched in Fig.  38.  It is most easily constructed  as follows.  A bit of tubing about 2 centimetres diameter, 15  centimetres long, and 1.5 millimetre wall thickness, is drawn down to  a point.  The larger bulb, about 5 centimetres in diameter, is blown  at one end of this tube.  The thinner the bulb the better, provided  that it does not collapse under atmospheric pressure.  A very good  idea of a proper thickness may be obtained from the statement that  about 4 centimetres length of the tubing should be blown out to form  the bulb.  This would give a bulb of about the thickness of an  ordinary fractionating bulb.  Before going any further it is as well  to test the bulb by tapping on the table and by exhausting it by means  of an ordinary water-velocity pump.    The side tube is next prepared out of narrower tubing, and is provided  with a smaller bulb, a blowing-out tube, and a terminal, to be made as  will be described.  This side tube is next fused on to the main tube,  special care being taken about the annealing, and the cathode terminal  is then sealed into the main tube.  After using clean glass it is in  general only necessary to rinse the tube out with clean alcohol, after  which it may be dried and exhausted.    The success of the operation will depend primarily on the attention  given to the preparation and sealing-in of the electrode facing the  large bulb.    Preparation of Terminals.  Some platinum wire of about No.  26  B.W.G--the exact size is unimportant--must be provided, also some  sheet aluminium about 1 millimetre thick, some white enamel cement  glass, and a \"cane\" of flint-glass tube of a few millimetres bore.    The electrodes are prepared by cutting discs of aluminium of from 1 to  1.5 centimetres diameter.  The discs of aluminium are bored in the  centre, so as to admit the \"stems\" which are made of aluminium wire  of about 1 millimetre diameter.  The stems are then riveted into the  discs.  The \"stems\" are about I centimetre long, and are drilled to a  depth of about 3 millimetres, the drill used being about double the  diameter of the platinum wire to be used for making the connections.  The faces of the electrodes--i.e.  the free surfaces of the aluminium  discs--are then hammered flat and brought to a burnished surface by  being placed on a bit of highly polished steel and struck by a \"set\"  provided with a hole to allow of the \"stem\" escaping damage.  The  operation will be obvious after a reference to Figs.  39 and 40;  it  is referred to again on page 96.    The platinum wires may be most conveniently attached by melting one  end of the piece of platinum wire in the oxygas blow-pipe till it  forms a bead just large enough to pass into the hole drilled up the  stem of the electrode.  The junction between the stein and the  platinum wire is then made permanent by squeezing the aluminium down  upon the platinum wire with the help of a pair of pliers.  It is also  possible to fuse the aluminium round the platinum, but as I have had  several breakages of such joints, I prefer the mechanical connection  described.    Fig.  39.
