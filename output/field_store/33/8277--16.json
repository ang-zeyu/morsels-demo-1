Here he parts company with Homer, and even with Virgil, who could  draw on no such vast and various store of history, geography, and  romance. From Herodotus to Olaus Magnus, and onward to the latest  discoveries in geography and astronomy, the researches of Galileo, and  the descriptions given by contemporary travellers of China and the  Chinese, or of the North American Indians, Milton compels the authors he  had read, both ancient and modern, to contribute to the gracing of his  work. It is partly this wealth of implicit lore, still more, perhaps, the  subtly reminiscent character of much of his diction, that justifies Mr.  Pattison in the remark that \"an appreciation of Milton is the last reward  of consummated scholarship.\"    A third device, not the least remarkable of those by which he gives  elasticity to his theme, is to be found in the tradition that he adopts  with regard to the later history of the fallen angels. A misunderstanding  of four verses in the fourteenth chapter of Isaiah, and some cryptic  allusions in the Book of Revelations are the chief Scriptural authorities  for the Miltonic account of the Fall of the Angels, which is not borrowed  from the Fathers, but corresponds rather with the later version  popularised in England by the cycles of Miracle Plays. According to the  _Divine Institutes_ of Lactantius, the nameless Angel, to whom from the  first had been given power over the new-created Earth, was alone infected  with envy of the Son of God, his elder and superior, and set himself to  vitiate and destroy mankind in the cradle. He tempted Eve, and she fell;  after the expulsion from Paradise he set himself also to corrupt the  guardian angels who were sent down from Heaven for the protection and  education of the increasing race of men. In this attempt also he  succeeded; \"the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair,  and they took them wives of all which they chose.\" And they forgot their  heavenly estate, and made for themselves a Godless dominion upon Earth.  This is the Fall of the Angels as it is narrated at greater length in the  recently recovered apocryphal _Book of Enoch_, and alluded to, perhaps in  the Epistles of Peter and of Jude, where are mentioned \"the angels that  sinned,\" and \"the angels which kept not their first estate.\" Milton's  version brings these angels to the earth, not as protectors of mankind,  but as conquerors come from Hell, to possess and occupy the spacious  world delivered over to them by the victory of Satan. From that point  forward, however, he adopts the tradition whereby Jerome, Lactantius, and  others had identified the fallen angels with the gods of the heathen.  Whether as conquerors or as corrupted guardians of the human race, they  seek the same ends,--to divert worship from the true God, and by the  destruction of man, to contrive a solace for their own perdition. They  are the inventors of astrology, sooth-saying, divination, necromancy, and  black magic; they were once the ministers of God, and still have a  presentiment of his acts, so that they can sometimes speak truly of the  future by means of oracles and magicians, claiming the while the credit  of bringing that to pass which in fact they only foresaw. Milton, in  adopting this doctrine, merely followed current belief, and did not, as  De Quincey seems to think, hit upon it by a fortunate stroke of genius.  He might have found it incidentally but fully set forth in so recent a  book as Hooker's _Ecclesiastical Polity_, I. iv. \"The fall of the angels,  therefore,\" says Hooker, \"was pride. Since their fall, their practices  have been the clean contrary unto those just mentioned. For, being  dispersed, some in the air, some in the earth, some in the water, some  among the minerals, dens, and caves that are under the earth; they have  by all means laboured to effect a universal rebellion against the laws,  and as far as in them lieth utter destruction of the works of God. These  wicked spirits the heathen honoured instead of Gods, both generally under  the name of _dii inferi_, 'gods infernal,' and particularly, some in  oracles, some in idols, some as household gods, some as nymphs; in a  word, no foul or wicked spirit which was not one way or other honoured of  men as god, till such time as light appeared in the world, and dissolved  the works of the Devil.\" The argument which Milton himself sets forth for  the support of this view was accepted as conclusive in his own age. The  Ionian gods, he says, Titan, and Saturn, and Jove, and the rest, the  youngest branch of that evil and influential family, were--                              Held    Gods, yet confessed later than Heaven and Earth    Their boasted parents.    They ruled the middle air and had access to no higher or purer heaven.  Howsoever Milton came by the doctrine, it was of enormous use to him; it  gave him names for his devils, and characters, and a detailed history of  the part they had played in human affairs; it was, in short, a key to all  the mythologies.    By these devices the author of _Paradise Lost_ escapes the impoverishment  of imagination that his subject seemed to impose upon him. On looking  once more over Andreini's list of prohibited topics, we are surprised to  find how many of them Milton has found a place for. He does introduce  points of history, sacred and profane; he relates fictions of fabulous  deities; he rehearses loves, furies, triumphs, conflagrations, and things  of a like nature. The principal conflagration that he describes is on a  very large scale; and the majestic ascent of the Son--      Up to the Heaven of Heavens, his high abode,    *      *      *      *      *    Followed with acclamation, and the sound    Symphonious often thousand harps, that tuned    Angelic harmonies,    is the grandest triumphal procession in all literature. On the other  hand, he manages to dispense with some of the institutions and implements  \"introduced by the necessities of sin.\" He has swords and spears,  trumpets and drums in plenty. But he has no knives, nor hatchets, nor  bellows; and no theatres nor exchequers. There are no urns nor funeral  piles, because there is no death; or rather, because the only Death that  there is increases the number of persons in the poem by one. Sports of  hunting and fishing there are, of course, none; and, although it is an  heroic poem, the horse takes little part in the celestial war, is hardly  known in hell, and is unheard of on earth until Adam beholds in vision  the armed concourse of his corrupt descendants. Nevertheless, the general  impression left by the poem is one of richness rather than poverty of  poetic ornament. The wealth is most profusely displayed in the books  treating of Satan and his followers, but it is not absent from Eden nor  from the empyreal Heaven, although in the one case the monotony of the  situation, and in the other the poet's evident anxiety to authorise his  every step from Scripture, prevent the full display of his power. But  Milton is a difficult poet to disable; he is often seen at his best on  the tritest theme, which he handles after his own grave fashion by  comprehensive statement, measured and appropriate, heightened by none  save the most obvious metaphors, and depending for almost all its charm  on the quiet colouring of the inevitable epithet, and the solemn music of  the cadence:--      Now came still Evening on, and Twilight gray    Had in her sober livery all things clad;    Silence accompanied; for beast and bird    They to their grassy couch, these to their nests,    Were slunk, all but the wakeful nightingale.    She all night long her amorous descant sung:    Silence was pleased. Now glowed the firmament    With living sapphires; Hesperus, that led    The starry host, rode brightest, till the Moon,    Rising in clouded majesty, at length    Apparent queen, unveiled her peerless light,    And o'er the dark her silver mantle threw.    Darkness, silence, rest, the nightingale's song, the stars, the rising of  the moon--these are all the material of this wonderful passage. Yet did  ever such beauty fall with night upon such peace, save in Paradise alone?    Once he had got his story, based on his few authorities, with hints  unconsciously taken and touches added, perhaps, from his reading of other  poets--of Caedmon, Andreini, and Vondel, of Spenser, Sylvester, Crashaw,  and the Fletchers--Milton's first task was to reduce it to the strict  relations of time and space. His blindness probably helped him by  relieving him from the hourly solicitations of the visible world, and  giving him a dark and vacant space in which to rear his geometric fabric.  Against this background the figures of his characters are outlined in  shapes of light, and in this vacancy he mapped out his local Heaven and  Hell.    Heaven, as Milton portrays it, is a plain of vast extent, diversified  with hills, valleys, woods and streams. In the Second Book he speaks of  it as--                              Extended wide    In circuit, undetermined square or round;    in the Tenth Book it is determined, and is square. It is bounded by  battlements of living sapphire, and towers of opal. In the midst is  situated a Mount, the dwelling place of the Most High, surrounded by  golden lamps, which diffuse night and day alternately--for without  twilight and dawn, his dearest memories, Heaven would have been no Heaven  to Milton. On a mountain far to the north of this great plain, Satan  erects his pyramids and towers of diamond and gold, and establishes his  empire, which lasts exactly three days. At his final overthrow the  crystal wall of Heaven rolls back, disclosing a gap into the abyss; the  rebels, tortured with plagues and thunder, fling themselves in  desperation over the verge. They fall for nine days, through Chaos. Chaos  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21687"],[0,"The Youngest Girl in the Fifth: A School Story (#15)"],[1,"orders that Grannie and  Aunt Violet almost invariably sent at Christmas. If these did not  arrive, she could not pay Netta, and then--well, any kind of  catastrophe might be expected to follow. She went about with a load of  lead on her heart, and a consequent shortness of temper highly trying  to the rest of the family. She was grumpy with the little boys,  impatient with Lesbia, and so unaccommodating over doing the  decorations in church that Beatrice finally begged her to go home,  saying she and Winnie could finish alone.    \"You two always want to get rid of me!\" flared out Gwen as she stumped  defiantly away.    It was not a very happy preparation for Christmas, and Gwen stood  rather forlornly in the church porch, her hands in her pockets,  watching a few snowflakes that were beginning to fall silently from  the heavy grey sky and to whiten the tops of the gravestones and the  outlines of the crooked yew trees near the gate. The peace and  goodwill that ought to have been present everywhere to-day seemed to  have vanished.    \"Beatrice was just horrid,\" thought Gwen, quite oblivious of the fact  that the quarrel was of her own making. We are so apt to forget that  the world is like a mirror, and if we insist upon frowning into it, it  will probably frown back. We sometimes expect other people to do all  the forbearing, and then are astonished if our much-tried friends fail  in the very point in which we ourselves are so deficient.    \"Why, Gwen, what a woebegone face!\" exclaimed Father, who hurried in  for a moment to speak to the parish clerk. \"You'd make a grand model  for an artist who wanted to paint a picture of 'Misery'. Are the  decorations finished?\"    \"Almost; at least my part of them.\"    \"Then go home and open that parcel of Parish Magazines you'll find on  my study table, and deliver those that belong to the village. You know  where to find the list. Be sure to tick the names off. And don't go  farther down the road than Marriott's farm; it's getting dark.\"    Gwen cheered visibly. She was always glad to do something for Father,  if it were only distributing Parish Magazines, so she strode off with  a swinging step, humming the carol that the school children had been  practising with Winnie that afternoon.        \"Show us, dear Christ-Child, Thy Christmas light,      Teach us the song of the Angels bright,      And the love of the Mother blest.      And help us this Christmas to learn of Thee      All we should do, and all we should be,      And how we can please Thee best.\"    Fortunately the Gascoynes were a forgiving family, and when they all  met at tea-time nobody seemed to remember Gwen's ill humour. The  evening was a busy one, for there were holly and ivy to be put up in  the Parsonage now the church was finished, and the usual mirth over a  bough of mistletoe which old Mr. Hodson, who owned the big farm by the  mill, always cut off every year from an apple tree in his orchard and  brought to them with his own hands. Gwen forgot her troubles and  romped with the rest, accepting Martin's sticky kisses in the spirit  in which they were intended. The Gascoynes did not hang up their  stockings, but laid their presents on the breakfast-table, so that  they could have the gratification of opening all their parcels  together. It was a point of honour not to take the tiniest peep inside  even the most tempting-looking package until the whole family was  assembled. Gwen had tried to make up for the poverty of her offerings  by the warmth of the greetings she wrote outside, but she did not  feel proud of her collection as she carried it downstairs. She was the  last, so she hastily made her distribution, and turned to her own  plate. She had been well remembered: a book from Father; a nightdress  case, beautifully embroidered, from Beatrice; a new purse from Winnie;  a big bottle of scent from dear little Lesbia, who to buy it must  certainly have gone without the blue-handled penknife she had coveted  so much in Bayne's window; some pencils from Giles and Basil; and a  piece of indiarubber from Martin, who had compassed seven presents on  a capital of eightpence-halfpenny. Gwen looked rather anxiously as the  others opened the packets she had addressed to them; but whatever they  thought, they all had the niceness to hide their feelings, and thanked  her as if she had given them the most expensive objects obtainable.    Father's humour, however, could not help twinkling out at the cake of  soap: \"To Darling Dad, with dearest and best love, from Gwen\".    \"I hope it isn't a hint I need washing,\" he said with mock  seriousness.    \"I thought you liked oatmeal soap!\" protested Gwen, nearly crying.    \"So I do, my dear; and I haven't had any for a long time. Like the man  in Pears's advertisement, I shall now use no other.\"    \"Here's the postman!\" shouted Giles, rushing excitedly to the door,  where that much-burdened official, with an extra man to help him, was  sorting out what belonged to the Parsonage.    \"Six letters for you, Gwen, and two parcels,\" said Beatrice, assuming  command of the correspondence, and distributing it among the eager  family.    Gwen snatched her share nervously. Would any of the letters contain  the longed-for postal orders? No, they all had halfpenny stamps, and  were clearly only Christmas cards.    Then she fell upon the parcels. The first contained a handsome knitted  coat, and cap to match, \"with love from Grannie\", and the second, a  beautiful little set of Wordsworth's poems in a cloth case, \"with Aunt  Violet's best wishes\".    Gwen sat down on the sofa, feeling as if she had received a rude  shock. That both Grannie and Aunt Violet should have sent presents  instead of money was worse than she had calculated upon. She tried to  pull herself together, and not show her disappointment too plainly,  but the thought of what she owed was paramount. It only made it worse  that the gifts were really acceptable, and that the rest of the family  persisted in considering her extremely lucky.    \"It was kind of Grannie to send that lovely coat: dark green will just  suit you. Try it on, and the cap too,\" said Winnie.    \"It looks swank!\" declared the boys.    \"They'll go with your dark green skirt,\" affirmed Beatrice.    \"The Wordsworths are scrumptious!\" said Lesbia. \"You've done awfully  well this Christmas!\"    \"Yes, but how am I going to pay my debts?\" thought Gwen, as she ran  upstairs to get ready for church.          CHAPTER X    A Prodigal      As the next term seemed likely to bring its own crop of troubles,  Gwen, with a kind of grim philosophy, determined to enjoy herself  while she could, and make the most of the holidays. She helped  vigorously at the schools, where tea parties for children and  grownups, concerts and other entertainments were in full swing, and  she even wrung a few words of appreciation from Beatrice for her  active services in the way of slicing up cake, cutting ham sandwiches,  and pouring out innumerable cups of tea. Gwen liked the village  festivities, she knew everybody in the place, and found it all fun,  from listening to the comic songs of the local grocer, to playing  Oranges and Lemons with the babies in the Infant School.    \"We've three real parties too,\" she said on December 30th, \"as well as  going to the Chambers' this afternoon.\"    \"I hardly think Mrs. Chambers will expect you,\" declared Beatrice,  looking out of the window at the dark sky. \"It's beginning to snow  already, and I believe we shall have a heavy fall.\"    \"Then it must keep off till to-morrow, for we've got to get to North  Ditton somehow!\" announced Gwen.    Dick's mother had asked the younger Gascoynes to tea, and amongst  their various invitations it was to this that Gwen looked forward the  most. She wanted to see Dick's home, and the collection of birds' eggs  and butterflies which he had promised to show her, and his magic  lantern, and his microscope, and all the Natural History books of  which he had so often spoken. She watched the weather impatiently, and  when the snow fell faster and faster, and Beatrice decided  emphatically that the visit was impossible, she broke into open  mutiny.    \"It's too bad! We shouldn't take any harm. What an old mollycoddle you  are, Beatrice!\"    \"I've a little more sense in my head than you have! With this wind the  roads will be deep in drifts. It's quite unfit to go out, especially  for you with that nasty cough. I should have you laid up with  bronchitis.\"    \"My cold's better,\" affirmed Gwen, trying not to sound hoarse; \"snow  doesn't hurt people. Father's gone out in it!\"    \"Father was obliged to go--it's quite a different thing for him. I'm  sorry you're disappointed, but really, Gwen, don't be so childish!  Look at Lesbia, she isn't making such a dreadful fuss!\"    \"Lesbia never worries about anything, so it's no virtue at all!\"  snarled Gwen, knowing perfectly well that she was unfair, for Lesbia  undoubtedly added self-control to her naturally sweet disposition.  \"You always hold up Lesbia! You've no right to say we must stop at  home, just because you're the eldest!\"    Beatrice sighed. Sometimes she thought this turbulent cuckoo of a  younger sister was the cross of her life.    \"It's no use talking in this way, Gwen! Somebody must be in authority,  and you'll have to do as you're told.\"    \"I shan't! I don't care! You're only six years older than I am!\"    And Gwen flounced out of the room in a rage. She ran upstairs, her  eyes smarting with hot tears of temper. She was disgusted with the  others for not taking the matter more to heart. How could Lesbia sit  reading so calmly, or the boys amuse themselves with their absurd  engine?    \"They don't care like I do! I wish I could go without them!\" she said  aloud.    The idea was an excellent one. What fun it would be to go alone, and  have Dick all to herself--no tiresome youngsters to claim his  attention, finger his books, and perhaps break"]]]
