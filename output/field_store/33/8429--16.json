Mr. Thiele has found a number of  casks in the cellars of the Tomati Palace at Rome, filled with letters,  addressed to Thorwaldsen, and among them a long and constant  correspondence between him and his mother, who lived part of the time in  Denmark and part of the time in Iceland, her native country. It seems  that Thorwaldsen had the habit of preserving his papers, even to the  most trifling, by flinging them confusedly into a cedar box in his room;  when that was full they were emptied into the casks where they have now  been found; these casks were not noticed when all the other contents of  the palace were removed to Copenhagen. Whatever is interesting in these  papers will, of course, be published. Mr. Thiele has also discovered in  the same cellar the model of a bas-relief by the same great artist,  representing the Muses dancing by Helicon. It will be added to the  collection of his works at Copenhagen.           *       *       *       *       *    THE artist HEIDEL has published at Berlin a series of Eight  Illustrations to Goethe's Iphigenia. He aims in them to preserve unmixed  the spirit of antique art, and thus to prove that the Germans are the  true successors of the Greeks. The subjects of his designs are:--The  Fall of Tantalus; the Departure of Agamemnon; the Sacrifice of  Iphigenia; the Death of Agamemnon; the Death of Clytemnestrae; the Flight  of Orestes; the Meeting of Orestes and Iphigenia; and the Return of  Iphigenia. The designs are praised by the German critics. They say that  in beholding the Flight of Orestes, pursued by the Furies, who dare not  enter the sacred temple of Apollo where he seeks refuge, one imagines  that he hears the fearful chanting of a chorus of AEschylus.           *       *       *       *       *    A NEW ART called _Metallography_ has been discovered by Nicholas Zack, a  lithographer at Munich, by means of which designs that have hitherto  been engraved on wood can be put directly upon metal, and in such a  manner as to be printed from. The plate is prepared beforehand, and the  artist draws his design upon it with a pencil or a needle. Without any  further labor, by means of the preparation alone, the plate will be  ready for printing. Worn-out plates may be restored with very little  expense.           *       *       *       *       *    A BOOKSELLER of Munich has published Albert Duerer's sketches from the  prayer-book of Emperor Maximilian I., with the original text, colored  initials, and an introduction. Price eight thalers, about $6,00.           *       *       *       *       *    MORITZ RUGENDAS, a German artist, who has lately spent a considerable  time in Mexico and the countries of South America, is now engaged at  Munich, in arranging the pictures for which his journeys in those  countries furnished him the materials. A work of such magnitude has  never before been undertaken by any artist. He intends to treat each  country in a continuous series of views. The Mexican series is now  nearly completed, consisting of about 100 landscapes, in oil. It begins  with Vera Cruz, where the artist landed, and goes through the whole  country to the Pacific. First is the coast seen from the sea; next we  behold the coast with the sea as it appears inland; then we mount to the  plains, noticing the gradual change of the mountain formations, and the  vegetation, with views in every direction from each interesting point;  we pass through the great plateau, ascend the volcanoes and survey their  craters, and admire the beauty of the region about the city of Mexico.  From the city there are sketches of journeys in every direction, and at  last we traverse the palm forest of St. Jago, and stand upon the heights  whence the eye reaches to the Pacific. Every picturesque scene is  finished with the greatest care and with special regard to the natural  features of the landscape. Buildings and human figures are either  avoided altogether or used as merely subordinate. When Mexico is  completed, Rugendas will use in a similar manner the sketches he has  taken in other countries. It is not known whether his pictures will be  engraved or not. They will, we believe, become the property of the Royal  Pinakothek, at Munich.           *       *       *       *       *    The painters at Vienna have formed an Art-Union, which is succeeding in  its first exhibition, which is now open. Some well-known artists of  Germany have sent pictures. Foltz, of Munich, has a landscape with a  flock of sheep; Zimmerman a landscape with effect of sunlight; Huelner,  of Duesseldorf, a boy reading the Bible to his mother, Vienna. Koeckoeck,  of Holland, has two landscapes. The artists of Vienna have also not been  backward. Among the names of the exhibitors we notice that of  Waldmueller, who is known in this country for his picture of the Children  leaving School, which was drawn a year since by one of the subscribers  to the International Art-Union, and was regarded as one of the chief  attractions of its collection.           *       *       *       *       *    We hear from Berlin that KAULBACH has painted in miniature the Four  Evangelists, in a copy of Luther's translation of the New Testament,  which is destined for the World's Fair. The book is a folio; the leaves  are of vellum, and the printing is done in Gothic letters and in various  colored inks by four accomplished masters of calligraphy. These artists  have also ornamented their work with numerous vignettes. The book is now  being exhibited at the Royal Library in Berlin.           *       *       *       *       *    MR. PRESCOTT, Mr. Ticknor, and other Boston gentlemen of high  cultivation and artistic taste, have prepared a memorial to Congress  that POWERS should be commissioned by government to put into marble his  statue of America. For less than twenty-five thousand dollars,  probably--for a sum not larger than that which was paid by the  government for the two specimens of commonplace by Mr. Persico, this  admirable production might be obtained in colossal size for the capitol.           *       *       *       *       *    The GERMAN _Arch[=a]ologische Institut_, at Rome, celebrated the  birth-day of Winckelmann on the 13th of December. Dr. Emil Braun read an  essay on the two chief groups of the frieze of the Parthenon. These  groups have hitherto been supposed to represent the twelve gods of  Olympus; Dr. Braun attempted to show that they represent, in a double  point of view, the native heroes of Attica. The physical development of  the country is expressed in the genealogy of a royal race, beginning  with Cecrops and his wife Agraulia, continued in Cranaus and Amphictyon,  and finally passing into Erichthonius, the son of Atthis, and foster son  of Pandrosos. The social organization of the state begins with  Erechtheus, who is aided by his wife Praxithea, and his daughter Creusa.  He annexes Eleusis to Athens, the former being here represented by  Demeter and Triptolemus; finally Theseus with his friend Pirithous  completes the civil organization of Athens, and establishes it upon a  firm basis. Essays on subjects connected with antique art and history  were also read by Dr. L. Schmidt, Dr. H. Brunn, and Dr. W. Heuzen.           *       *       *       *       *    The paintings of the Chapel of the Virgin in the Church of Notre Dame de  Lorette, a vast work, which has hitherto remained unknown to the public,  and which has been interrupted by the recent death of the painter, M.  Victor Orsel, are now attracting attention. M. Perrin, intrusted with  the execution of a similar chapel in the same edifice, will undertake  the pious task of terminating the work of a friend, with whom he had  lived on terms of the closest friendship, cemented by a community of  ideas and talent. Orsel was making rapid strides towards a great  reputation.           *       *       *       *       *    We had occasion lately to notice in the _International_ the  illustrations of Hood's \"Bridge of Sighs,\" by Mr. Ehninger. This young  artist has just published in a large quarto (through Putnam) a series of  Outline Illustrations of Washington Irving's \"Dolph Heyliger,\" which are  an improvement upon his first performance. Many of the scenes are  admirably rendered. We believe Mr. Ehninger is now pursuing the study of  art abroad.           *       *       *       *       *    The German sculptor, WOLFF, has added to, his many admirable works a  figure of _Paris_, which is much praised.          THE AUTHORESS OF \"JANE EYRE,\" AND HER SISTERS.[13]      Miss Bronte has just published in London the literary remains of her  sisters, \"Ellis\" and \"Acton Bell,\" with interesting sketches of their  histories, including some glimpses of her own. We copy a portion of the  reviewal of the work in the _Athenaeum_:    The lifting of that veil which for a while concealed the authorship of  'Jane Eyre' and its sister-novels, excites in us no surprise. It seemed  evident from the first prose pages bearing the signatures of Currer,  Ellis, and Acton Bell, that these were _Rosalinds_--or a _Rosalind_--in  masquerade:--some doubt as to the plurality of persons being engendered  by a certain uniformity of local color and resemblance in choice of  subject, which might have arisen either from identity, or from joint  peculiarities of situation and of circumstance. It seemed no less  evident that the writers described from personal experience the wild and  rugged scenery of the northern parts of this kingdom; and no assertion  or disproval, no hypothesis or rumor, which obtained circulation after  the success of 'Jane Eyre,' could shake convictions that had been  gathered out of the books themselves.

The camp has again assumed its condition of readiness and  watchfulness. On Saturday afternoon it was rumoured that General  Joubert, with the commando encamped at Sunday River, was experiencing  difficulty in transporting the 40-pounders across the spruit, which was  swollen after the heavy rains. Small parties of Boers are constantly on  the alert, and are harassing the British outposts.    \"Scarcely a day passes without the outlying pickets being fired upon.  The latest reports say that the enemy are gathered in considerable force  on Dewdrop Farm.    \"Great excitement has been caused in the Artillery camp by the capture  of a supposed spy, who was caught in the act of tampering with the guns.  The man had eluded the vigilance of the sentry, and had opened the  breech of one of the 15-pounders when he was noticed. He was promptly  arrested. When asked what he was doing, he said he was a lieutenant in  the 18th Battery. Questioned further, he contradicted himself, and said  that it was quite by accident that he opened the breech. He admitted  that he belonged to Johannesburg. He was marched off in custody of the  guard. The sequel of the story has not been made public.    \"No camp followers are allowed, and all here have been ordered to leave.  The enemy are now undoubtedly closing round Ladysmith. A large commando  is reported to be on the Helpmakaar road, and a large camp has been  formed between the Harrismith Railway Bridge and Potgieter's Farm. The  camp on Dewdrop Farm extends for four miles. The enemy have an  exceptional number of waggons. The Boer patrols are very venturesome;  they have approached within three and a half miles of the town, and one  party actually removed carcasses ready dressed for consumption from  within the slaughtering lines.\"    The prospect was far from cheering, particularly as Sir George White was  well aware that his field-guns were ineffective against the powerful  guns of position which the enemy were handling with unpleasant  dexterity. At this critical period the united forces of Ladysmith and  Glencoe only amounted to some 10,000 men, more than half of whom were  infantry. The General, however, put the best face he could on the  matter, telegraphed home for big guns--and waited!    General Joubert now expressed his opinions on the causes of the war. His  ideas, published in the German journals, were of interest as showing the  sentiments of the opposite camp:--         \"It was evident to our Government after the Jameson raid, that       Great Britain would be forced in time by various sordid       elements into a war of extermination with the Boers. It was       equally clear that this danger could only be averted by       armaments on a most extensive scale. We were conscious that the       impending war of annihilation would incur the sharpest       condemnation on the part of the other European Powers, but       history had taught us that not one of these Powers would be       roused to intervene in our favour. In these circumstances we       had to rely on our own strength.         \"By indefatigable zeal and heavy sacrifices to augment our       forces, and yet to secrete them from the observation of the       British--these were the objects of our noblest exertion. Well,       we succeeded, and hoodwinked the British. Spies were permitted       to obtain glimpses of our obsolete artillery, but until the war       was on the point of breaking out they had no suspicion of the       formidable extent of our stores of modern material.         \"We counted on the unreliability of the British announcements       concerning their own preparedness, and attended as little to       their cries of 'To Pretoria!' as did the Germans in 1870 to the       Parisian boasters who shouted 'A Berlin!' Without completely       denuding her colonies of troops, Great Britain cannot possibly       despatch more than about 85,000 men to South Africa. Of this       imposing force, only half will be available for the chief       battles. It may be possible for Great Britain to effect the       landing in various places of these troops by the middle of       December. I estimate, however, that the losses in prisoners,       killed, sick, and wounded will amount in the meantime to some       10,000. There will thus remain 75,000 men.         \"Even should we fail to prevent the junction of the British       troops under Sir Redvers Buller and be compelled to retreat,       the British army would become from natural causes so       debilitated that it would represent a force for operative       purposes not exceeding 35,000. The remainder would have to be       employed in protecting lines of communication extending some       700 miles.         \"Our lines of depots, on the contrary, are in home territory.       They are constructed at regular distances in three directions,       and barely 500 men are necessary to cover them.       Excellently-organised communications have been established       between them, and if any one of them be seriously threatened,       the stores--if rescue be impossible--will be destroyed.         \"Moreover, defensive warfare--to which we need not think,       however, of resorting for a long time to come--is fraught with       far greater advantages to us than offensive operations. With a       change of _terrain_ there will be a change of tactics. In Natal       and the south we have to deal with unfamiliar conditions. On       the high plains of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State we       shall be at home, and the British will meet opposition from us       and from Nature at every step of the way, and at all times be       prepared for action on two or three fronts. In this way will be       developed a guerilla warfare of a most inconceivably bloody       character, such as the British will be unable to endure for       more than a few months.\"    General Joubert then protested that the Boers were fighting merely for  the freedom of their own \"narrower\" Fatherland, and not with a view to  the destruction of British preponderancy in South Africa. He  acknowledged the bravery of the British soldiers, but imagined that  hardships and deprivations would so demoralise them that they would be  unable to hold out against an enemy superior in numbers.         \"In these circumstances,\" he continued, \"do not accuse me of       boasting when I frankly say that victory will be ours. Every       one of us is filled with the same conviction and unshakeable       faith in God, that He will remain as true to us in this as in       former wars, and that He will not allow the blood shed and to       be shed in this struggle, that will probably last yet a year,       to extinguish us and our children.\"                            THE BATTLE OF LOMBARD'S KOP    Towards the end of October Sir George White decided that something must  be done to protect his line of communication with the south. The Boers  were spreading out in crescent form and drawing gradually nearer to the  town. On the north were troops commanded by General Joubert. On the west  was a Free State commando, and on the east was General Lucas Meyer, who  owed us a grudge after the events of Talana Hill. Reinforced by troops  from General Erasmus, he now desired to press towards the railway with a  view to seizing it at some point south of the town. It was necessary at  all costs to put a stop to this scheme. Colonel Ian Hamilton with an  Infantry Brigade was therefore despatched on the 27th to Lombard's Kop,  a hill some five miles east of Ladysmith. There he bivouacked for the  night, with a view to clearing the enemy out at the point of the bayonet  on the morrow. He never brought his plan into execution, however, for  Sir George White, having been informed of the size of Meyer's force,  ordered him to fall back on the town. On Sunday the 29th it was  discovered that the Boers were intrenched in lines that extended over  twenty miles, while \"Long Tom,\" their six-inch gun, was perched on  Pepworth Hill, its big ominous muzzle being situated some 7500 yards to  the north of Ladysmith. In addition to this formidable weapon,  field-guns with a range of some 8000 yards were posted about in  well-concealed positions. For the protection of our line of  communication it was necessary that the enemy, though three times as  strong as the British force, should be dispersed, and that night, at  half-past ten o'clock, Colonel Hamilton again set out with three  battalions, the Devons, the Gordons, the Manchesters, and a Brigade  Division of Artillery. The night was dark but clear, and the troops  marched along the Newcastle Road to Limit Hill, a strong kopje some  three miles north of Ladysmith, and half-way between that town and  Pepworth Hill. There they bivouacked for the night. While this party was  moving as described, a small force under Colonel Carleton, composed of  four and a half companies of the Gloucestershire Regiment and six  companies of the Royal Irish Fusiliers and No. 10 Mountain Battery, was  moving towards Nicholson's Nek with a view of seizing it. But of Colonel  Carleton's column anon.    [Illustration: MAP OF LADYSMITH AND SURROUNDING HEIGHTS]    On Colonel Ian Hamilton's right flank, towards Lombard's Kop, was  Colonel Grimwood, with the 1st and 2nd King's Royal Rifles, the  Liverpools, Leicesters, and Dublin Fusiliers, three Field-Batteries, and  the Natal Volunteer Artillery. On the extreme right, when day broke, was  General French with a Cavalry Brigade and some volunteers. The idea was,  that while Colonel Grimwood was shelling the Boer position to the north  of Lombard's Kop, General French should prevent any attempt to turn his  right; the enemy's artillery silenced, Colonel Grimwood was to drive him  along the ridge running to Pepworth, and, under cover of the British  guns, press the Boers"]]]
