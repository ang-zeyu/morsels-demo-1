You could only see him  as he passed round from the east by the south to the west, for after  that the river ran behind high mountains, and the sun passed out of  sight to sail through the world of darkness.    Behind the sun, and appearing after he had vanished, came the moon,  sailing in its own bark. It was protected by two guardian eyes, which  watched always over it (Plate 13), and it needed the protection, for  every month it was attacked by a great enemy in the form of a sow. For a  fortnight the moon sailed on safely, and grew fuller and rounder; but at  the middle of the month, just when it was full, the sow attacked it,  tore it out of its place, and flung it into the celestial river, where  for another fortnight it was gradually extinguished, to be revived again  at the beginning of the next month. That was the Egyptians' curious way  of accounting for the waxing and waning of the moon, and many of their  other ideas were just as quaint as this.    I do not mean to say anything of what they believed about God, for they  had so many gods, and believed such strange things about them, that it  would only confuse you if I tried to make you understand it all. But the  most important thing in all the Egyptian religion was the belief in  heaven, and in the life which people lived there after their life on  earth was ended. No other nation of these old times ever believed so  firmly as did the Egyptians that men were immortal, and did not cease to  be when they died, but only began a new life, which might be either  happy or miserable, according to the way in which they had lived on  earth.    They had a lot of different beliefs about the life after death, some of  them rather confusing, and difficult to understand; but I shall tell you  only the main things and the simplest things which they believed. They  said, then, that very long ago, when the world was young, there was a  great and good King called Osiris, who reigned over Egypt, and was very  good to his subjects, teaching them all kinds of useful knowledge. But  Osiris had a wicked brother named Set, who hated him, and was jealous of  him. One day Set invited Osiris to a supper, at which he had gathered a  number of his friends who were in the plot with him. When they were all  feasting gaily, he produced a beautiful chest, and offered to give it to  the man who fitted it. One after another they lay down in the chest, but  it fitted none of them. Then at last Osiris lay down in it, and as soon  as he was inside, his wicked brother and the other plotters fastened the  lid down upon him, and threw the chest into the Nile. It was carried  away by the river, and at last was washed ashore, with the dead body of  the good King still in it.    But Isis, wife of Osiris, sought for her husband everywhere, and at last  she found the chest with his body. While she was weeping over it the  wicked Set came upon her, tore his brother's body to pieces, and  scattered the fragments far and wide; but the faithful Isis traced them  all, and buried them wherever she found them.    Now, Isis had a son named Horus, and when he grew to manhood he  challenged Set, fought with him, and defeated him. Then the gods all  assembled, and gave judgment that Osiris was in the right, and Set in  the wrong. They raised Osiris up from the dead, made him a god, and  appointed him to be judge of all men after death. And then, not all at  once, but gradually, the Egyptians came to believe that because Osiris  died, and rose again from the dead, and lived for ever after death,  therefore all those men who believed in Osiris would live again after  death, and dwell for ever with Osiris. You see that in some respects the  story is strangely like that of the death and resurrection of Jesus  Christ.    Well, then, they supposed that, when a man died on earth, after his body  was mummified and laid in its tomb, his soul went on to the gates of the  palace of Osiris in the other world, where was the Hall of Truth, in  which souls were judged. The soul had to know the magic names of the  gates before it could even enter the Hall; but as soon as these names  were spoken the gates opened, and the soul went in. Within the Hall  there stood a great pair of scales, and beside the scales stood a god,  ready to mark down the result of the judgment; while all round the Hall  sat forty-two terrible creatures, who had authority to punish particular  sins.    The soul had to make confession to these avengers of sin that he had not  been guilty of the sins which they had power to punish; then, when he  had made his confession, his heart was taken, and weighed in the scales  against a feather, which was the Egyptian sign for truth. If it was not  of the right weight, the man was false, and his heart was thrown to a  dreadful monster, part crocodile, part hippopotamus, which sat behind  the balances, and devoured the hearts of the unjust; but if it was  right, then Horus, the son of Osiris, took the man by the hand, and led  him into the presence of Osiris the Judge, and he was pronounced just,  and admitted to heaven.    But what was heaven? Well, the Egyptians had several different ideas  about it. One rather pretty one was that the souls which were pronounced  just were taken up into the sky, and there became stars, shining down  for ever upon the world. Another was that they were permitted to enter  the boat, in which, as I told you, the sun sails round the world day by  day, and to keep company with the sun on his unending voyage.    But the idea that most believed in and loved was that somewhere away in  a mysterious land to the west, there lay a wonderful and beautiful  country, called the Field of Bulrushes. There the corn grew three and a  half yards high, and the ears of corn were a yard long. Through the  fields ran lovely canals, full of fish, and bordered with reeds and  bulrushes. When the soul had passed the Judgment Hall, it came, by  strange, hard roads, and through great dangers, to this beautiful  country. And there the dead man, dead now no more, but living for ever,  spent his time in endless peace and happiness, sowing and reaping,  paddling in his canoe along the canals, or resting and playing draughts  in the evening under the sycamore-trees.    Now, I suppose that all this seemed quite a happy sort of heaven to most  of the common people, who had been accustomed all their days to hard  work and harder fare; but by-and-by the great nobles came to think that  a heaven of this sort was not quite good enough for them. They had never  done any work on earth; why should they have to do any in heaven? So  they thought that they would find out a way of taking their slaves with  them into the other world. I fancy that at first they actually tried to  take them by killing the slaves at their master's grave. When the  funeral of a great man took place, some of his servants would be killed  beside the tomb, so that they might go with their lord into heaven, and  work for him there, as they had worked for him on earth.    But the Egyptians were always a gentle, kind-hearted people, and they  quickly grew disgusted with the idea of such cruelty, so they found  another way out of the difficulty. They got numbers of little clay  figures made in the form of servants--one with a hoe on his shoulder,  another with a basket in his hand, and so on. They called these little  figures \"Answerers,\" and when a man was buried, they buried a lot of  these clay servants along with him, so that, when he reached heaven, and  was summoned to do work in the Field of Bulrushes, the Answerers would  rise up and answer for him, and take the task off his shoulders.    So, along with the mummies of the dead Egyptians, there is often found  quite a number of these tiny figures, all ready to make heaven easy for  their master when he gets there. They have sometimes a little verse  written upon them, to tell the Answerer what he has got to do in the  other world. It runs like this:    \"Oh, thou Answerer, when I am called, and when I am asked to do any kind  of work that is done in heaven, and am required at any time to cause  the field to flourish, or to convey the sand from east to west, thou  shalt say, 'Here am I.'\"    It all seems rather a curious idea of heaven, does it not? And most  curious of all is the idea of dodging work in the other world by  carrying a bundle of china dolls to heaven with you. But, even if we  think that very ridiculous, we need not forget that the Egyptians had a  wonderfully clear and sure grasp of the fact that it is a man's  character in this world which will make him either happy or unhappy in  the next, and that evil-doing, even if it escapes punishment in this  life, is a thing that God will surely punish at last.    Remember that these men of old, wonderfully wise and strong as they were  in many ways, were still the children of the time when the world was  young; like children, forming many false and even ridiculous ideas about  things they could not understand; like children, too, reaching out their  groping hands through the darkness to a Father whose love they felt,  though they could not explain His ways. We need not wonder if at times  they made mistakes, and went far astray. We may wonder far more at the  way in which He taught them so many true and noble things and thoughts,  never leaving Himself without a witness even in those days of long ago.          The End.

In 1417, Joan, second wife of Henry  IV., had been sentenced to prison, suspected of seeking the  king's death by sorcery; a certain Friar Randolf being her  accomplice and agent. The Duchess of Gloucester, wife of Humphry  and daughter of Lord Cobham, was an accomplice in the witchcraft  of a priest and an old woman. Her associates were Sir Roger  Bolingbroke, priest; Margery Jordan or Guidemar, of Eye, in  Suffolk; Thomas Southwell, and Roger Only. It was asserted 'there  was found in their possession a waxen image of the king, which  they melted in a magical manner before a slow fire, with the  intention of making Henry's force and vigour waste away by like  insensible degrees.' The duchess was sentenced to do penance and  to perpetual imprisonment; Margery was burnt for a witch in  Smithfield; the priest was hanged, declaring his employers had  only desired to know of him how long the king would live; Thomas  Southwell died the night before his execution; Roger Only was  hanged, having first written a book to prove his own innocence,  and against the opinion of the vulgar.[69] Jane Shore (whose  story is familiar to all), the mistress of Edward IV., was  sacrificed to the policy of Richard Duke of Gloucester, more than  to any general suspicion of her guilt. Both the Archbishop of  York and the Bishop of Ely were involved with the citizen's wife  in demoniacal dealings, and imprisoned in the Tower. As for the  'harlot, strumpet Shore,' not being convicted, or at least  condemned, for the worse crime, she was found guilty of adultery,  and sentenced (a milder fate) to do penance in a white sheet  before the assembled populace at St. Paul's.[70]      [69] The historian of England justly reflects on this case    that the nature of the crime, so opposite to all common    sense, seems always to exempt the accusers from using the    rules of common sense in their evidence.      [70] This unfortunate woman was celebrated for her beauty    and, with one important exception, for her virtues; and, if    her vanity could not resist the fascination of a royal lover,    her power had been often, it is said, exerted in the cause of    humanity. Notwithstanding the neglect and ill-treatment    experienced from the ingratitude of former fawning courtiers    and people, she reached an advanced age, for she was living    in the time of Sir Thomas More, who relates that 'when the    Protector had awhile laid unto her, for the manner sake, that    she went about to bewitch him, and that she was of counsel    with the lord chamberlain to destroy him; in conclusion, when    no colour could fasten upon this matter, then he laid    heinously to her charge the thing that herself could not    deny, that all the world wist was true, and that natheless    every man laughed at to hear it then so suddenly so highly    taken--that she was naught of her body.'--_Reign of Richard    III._, quoted by Bishop Percy in _Reliques of Old English    Romance Poetry_. The deformed prince fiercely attributes his    proverbial misfortune to hostile witchcraft. He addresses his    trembling council:           'Look how I am bewitch'd; behold mine arm          Is, like a blasted sapling, wither'd up:          And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch,          Consorted with that harlot, strumpet Shore,          That by their witchcraft thus have marked me.'                          _Richard III._ act iii. sc. 4.    More tremendous than any of the cases above narrated is that of  Arras, where numbers of all classes suffered. So transparent were  the secret but real motives of the chief agitators, that even the  unbounded credulity of the public could penetrate the thin  disguise. The affair commenced with the accusation of a woman of  Douai, called Demiselle (une femme de folle vie). Put to the  torture repeatedly, this wretched woman was forced to confess she  had frequented a meeting of sorcerers where several persons were  seen and recognised; amongst others Jehan Levite, a painter at  Arras. The chronicler of the fifteenth century relates the  diabolical catastrophe thus: 'A terrible and melancholy  transaction took place this year (1459) in the town of Arras, the  capital of the county of Artois, which said transaction was  called, I know not why, _Vaudoisie_: but it was said that certain  men and women transported themselves whither they pleased from  the places where they were seen, by virtue of a compact with the  devil. Suddenly they were carried to forests and deserts, where  they found assembled great numbers of both sexes, and with them a  devil in the form of a man, whose face they never saw. This devil  read to them, or repeated his laws and commandments in what way  they were to worship and serve him: then each person kissed his  back, and he gave to them after this ceremony some little money.  He then regaled them with great plenty of meats and wines, when  the lights were extinguished, and each man selected a female for  amorous dalliance; and suddenly they were transported back to the  places they had come from. For such criminal and mad acts many of  the principal persons of the town were imprisoned; and others of  the lower ranks, with women, and such as were known to be of this  sect, were so terribly tormented, that some confessed matters to  have happened as has been related. They likewise confessed to  have seen and known many persons of rank, prelates, nobles, and  governors of districts, as having been present at these meetings;  such, indeed, as, upon the rumour of common fame, their judges  and examiners named, and, as it were, put into their mouths: so  that through the pains of the torments they accused many, and  declared they had seen them at these meetings. Such as had been  thus accused were instantly arrested, and so long and grievously  tormented that they were forced to confess just whatever their  judges pleased, when those of the lower rank were inhumanly  burnt. Some of the richer and more powerful ransomed themselves  from this disgrace by dint of money; while others of the highest  orders were remonstrated with, and seduced by their examiners  into confession under a promise that if they would confess, they  should not suffer either in person or property. Others, again,  suffered the severest torments with the utmost patience and  fortitude. The judges received very large sums of money from such  as were able to pay them: others fled the country, or completely  proved their innocence of the charges made against them, and  remained unmolested. It must not be concealed (proceeds  Monstrelet) that many persons of worth knew that these charges  had been raked up by a set of wicked persons to harass and  disgrace some of the principal inhabitants of Arras, whom they  hated with the bitterest rancour, and from avarice were eager to  possess themselves of their fortunes. They at first maliciously  arrested some persons deserving of punishment for their crimes,  whom they had so severely tormented, holding out promises of  pardon, that they forced them to accuse whomsoever they were  pleased to name. This matter was considered [it must have been an  exceedingly ill-devised plot to provoke suspicion and even  indignation in such a matter] by all men of sense and virtue as  most abominable: and it was thought that those who had thus  destroyed and disgraced so many persons of worth would put their  souls in imminent danger at the last day.'[71]      [71] Enguerrand de Monstrelet's _Chronicles_, lib. iii. cap.    93, Johnes' Translation. _Vaudoisie_, which puzzles the    annalist, seems to disclose the pretence, if not the motive,    of the proceedings. Yet it is not easy to conceive so large    a number of all classes involved in the proscribed heresy of    the Vaudois in a single city in the north of France.    Meanwhile the inquisitor, Jacques Dubois, doctor in theology,  dean of Notre Dame at Arras, ordered the arrest of Levite the  artist, and made him confess he had attended the 'Vauldine;' that  he had seen there many people, men and women, burghers,  ecclesiastics, whose names were specified. The bishops' vicars,  overwhelmed by the number and quality of the involved, began to  dread the consequence, and wished to stop the proceedings. But  this did not satisfy the projects of two of the most active  promoters, Jacques Dubois and the Bishop of Bayrut, who urged the  Comte d'Estampes to use his authority with the vicars to proceed  energetically against the prisoners. Soon afterwards the matter  was brought to a crisis; the fate of the tortured convicts was  decided, and amidst thousands of spectators from all parts, they  were brought out, each with a mitre on his head, on which was  painted the devil in the form in which he appeared at the general  assemblies, and burned.    They admitted (under the severest torture, promises, and threats)  the truth of their meetings at the sabbaths. They used a sort of  ointment well known in witch-pharmacy for rubbing a small wooden  rod and the palms of their hands, and by a very common mode of  conveyance were borne away suddenly to the appointed rendezvous.  Here their lord and master was expecting them in the shape of a  goat with the face of a man and the tail of an ape. Homage was  first done by his new vassals offering up their soul or some part  of the body; afterwards in adoration kissing him on the back--the  accustomed salutation.[72] Next followed the different signs and  ceremonies of the infernal vassalage, in particular treading and  spitting upon the cross. Then to eating and drinking; after which  the guests joined in acts of indescribable debauchery, when the  devil took the form alternately of either sex. Dismissal was  given by a mock sermon, forbidding to go to church, hear mass, or  touch holy water. All these acts indicate schismatic offences  which yet for the most part are the"]]]
