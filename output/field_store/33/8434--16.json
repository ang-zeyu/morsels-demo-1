If we  attempt to catch the moment when the worm leaves the egg, we must extend  our observations beyond the interior of the hive; for there the  continual motion of the bees obscures what passes at the bottom of  cells. The egg must be taken out, presented to the microscope, and every  change attentively watched. One other precaution is essential. As a  certain degree of heat is requisite to hatch the worms, should the eggs  be too soon deprived of it they wither and perish. The sole method of  succeeding in seeing the worm come out, consists in watching the queen  while she lays, in marking the egg so as to be recognised, and removing  it from the hive to the microscope only an hour or two before the three  days elapse. The worm will certainly be hatched, provided it has been  exposed as long as possible to the full degree of heat. Such is the  course I have pursued; and the following are the results obtained.    In the month of August, we removed several cells containing eggs that  had been three days deposited: we cut off the top of the cell, and put  the pyramidal bottom, where the egg was fixed, on a glass slider. Slight  motions were soon perceptible in the eggs. At first, we could observe no  external organization: the worm was entirely concealed from us by its  pellicle. We then prepared to examine the egg with a powerful magnifier;  however, during the interval, the worm burst its surrounding membrane,  and cast off part of the envelope, which was torn and ragged on  different parts of the body, and more evidently so towards the last  rings. The worm alternately curved and stretched itself, with very  lively action. Twenty minutes were occupied in casting off the spoil;  when this exertion ceased: the worm lay down, curved, and seemed to take  that rest which it required. An egg laid in a worker's cell produced  this animal, which would have become a worker itself.    We next directed our attention to the moment when a male worm would be  hatched. An egg was exposed to the sun on a glass slider; and, with a  good magnifier, nine rings of the worm were perceptible within the  transparent pellicle. This membrane was still entire, and the worm  perfectly motionless. The two longitudinal lines of tracheae were visible  on the surface, and many ramifications. We never lost sight of the egg a  single instant, and now succeeded in observing the first motions of the  worm. The thick end alternately straightened and curved, and almost  reached the part where the sharp extremity was fixed. These exertions  burst the membrane, first on the upper part, towards the head, then on  the back, and afterwards on all the rest successively. The ragged  pellicle remained in folds on different parts of the body, and then fell  off. Thus it is beyond dispute, that the queen is oviparous.    Some observers affirm, that the workers attend to the eggs before the  worms are hatched; and it is certain that, at whatever time a hive is  examined, we always see some workers with the head and thorax inserted  into cells containing eggs, and remaining motionless several minutes in  this position. It is impossible to discover what they do, for the  interior of the cell is concealed by their bodies; but it is very easily  ascertained that, in this attitude, they are doing nothing to the eggs.    If, at the moment the queen lays, her eggs are put into a grated box,  and deposited in a strange hive, where there is the necessary degree of  heat, the worms come out at the usual time, just as if they had been  left in the cells. Thus no extraordinary aid or attention is required  for their exclusion.    When the workers penetrate the cells, and remain fifteen or twenty  minutes motionless, I have reason to believe, it is only to repose from  their labours. My observations on the subject seem correct. You know,  Sir, that a kind of irregular shaped cells, are frequently constructed  on the panes of the hive. These, being glass on one side, are  exceedingly convenient to the observer, since all that passes within is  exposed. I have often seen bees enter these cells when nothing could  attract them. The cells contained neither eggs nor honey, nor did they  need further completion. Therefore the workers repaired thither only to  enjoy some moments of repose. Indeed, they were fifteen or twenty  minutes so perfectly motionless, that had not the dilatation of the  rings shewed their respiration, we might have concluded them dead. The  queen also sometimes penetrates the large cells of the males, and  continues very long motionless in them. Her position prevents the bees  from paying their full homage to her, yet even then the workers do not  fail to form a circle around her, and brush the part of her belly that  remains exposed.    The drones do not enter the cells while reposing, but cluster together  on the combs; and sometimes retain this position eighteen or twenty  hours without the slightest motion.    As it is important, in many experiments, to know the exact time that the  three species of bees exist before assuming their ultimate form, I shall  here subjoin my own observations on the point.    The worm of workers passes three days in the egg, five in the vermicular  state, and then the bees close up its cell with a wax covering. The worm  now begins spinning its coccoon, in which operation thirty-six hours are  consumed. In three days, it changes to a nymph, and passes six days in  this form. It is only on the twentieth day of its existence, counting  from the moment the egg is laid, that it attains the fly state.    The royal worm also passes three days in the egg, and is five a worm;  the bees then close its cell; and it immediately begins spinning the  coccoon, which occupies twenty-four hours. The tenth and eleventh day it  remains in complete repose, and even sixteen hours of the twelfth. Then  the transformation to a nymph takes place, in which state four days and  a third are passed. Thus it is not before the sixteenth day that the  perfect state of queen is attained.    The male worm passes three days in the egg, six and a half as a worm,  and metamorphoses into a fly on the twenty-fourth day after the egg is  laid.    Though the larvae of bees are apodal, they are not condemned to absolute  immobility in their cells; for they can move by a spiral motion. During  the first three days, this motion is so slow as scarcely to be  perceptible, but it afterwards becomes more evident. I have then  observed them perform two complete revolutions in an hour and three  quarters. When the period of transformation arrives, they are only two  lines from the orifice of the cells. As their position is constantly the  same, bent in an arc, those in the workers' and drones' cells are  perpendicular to the horizon, while those in the royal cells lie  horizontally. It might be thought, that the difference of position has  much influence on the increment of the different larvae; yet it has none.  By reversing combs containing common cells full of brood, I have put the  worms in a horizontal position; but they were not injured. I have also  turned the royal cells, so that the worms came into a horizontal  direction; however their increment was neither slower nor less perfect.           *       *       *       *       *    I have been much surprised at the mode of bees spinning their coccoons,  and I have witnessed many new and interesting facts. The worms both of  workers and males fabricate _complete_ coccoons in their cells; that  is, close at both ends, and surrounding the whole body. The royal larvae,  on the other hand, spin imperfect coccoons, open behind, and enveloping  only the head, thorax, and first ring of the abdomen. The discovery of  this difference, which at first may seem trifling, has given me extreme  pleasure, for it evidently demonstrates the admirable art with which  nature connects the various characteristics in the industry of bees.    You will remember, Sir, the evidence I gave you of the mutual aversion  of queens, of the combats in which they engage, and the animosity that  leads them to destroy one another. Of several royal nymphs in a hive,  the first transformed attacks the rest, and stings them to death. But  were these nymphs enveloped in a complete coccoon, she could not  accomplish it. Why? because the silk is of so close a texture, the sting  could not penetrate, or if it did, the barbs would be retained by the  meshes of the coccoon, and the queen, unable to retract it, would  become the victim of her own fury. Thus, that the queen might destroy  her rivals, it was necessary the last rings of the body should remain  uncovered, therefore the royal nymphs must only form imperfect coccoons.  You will observe, that the last rings alone should be exposed, for the  sting can penetrate no other part: the head and thorax are protected by  connected shelly plates which it cannot pierce.    Hitherto, philosophers have claimed our admiration of nature in her care  of preserving and multiplying the species. But from the facts I relate,  we must admire her precautions in exposing certain individuals to a  mortal danger.    The detail on which I have just entered clearly indicates the final  cause of the opening left by the royal worms in their coccoons; but it  does not shew whether it is in consequence of a particular instinct that  they leave this opening, or whether the wideness of their cells prevents  them from stretching the thread up to the top. This question interested  me very much; the only method of deciding it was to observe the worms  while spinning, which cannot be done in their opaque cells. It then  occurred to me to dislodge them from their own habitations, and  introduce them into glass tubes, blown in exact imitation of the  different kind of cells.

He who sings premeditately, shews he  has learn'd his Lesson at Home.    Sec. 73. After having corrected several other Abuses and Defects, to the  Advantage of the Singer, he will return with stronger Reasons to  persuade him to have Recourse to the fundamental Rules, which will  teach him to proceed on the Bass from one Interval to another, with sure  Steps, and without Danger of erring. If then the Singer should say, Sir,  you trouble yourself in vain; for the bare Knowledge of the Errors is  not sufficient; I have need of other Help than Words, and I know not  where to find it, since it seems that there is at present such a  Scarcity of good Examples in _Italy_: Then, shrugging his Shoulders, he  will answer him, rather with Sighs than Words; that he must endeavour to  learn of the best Singers that there are; particularly by observing two  of the fair Sex,[108] of a Merit superior to all Praise; who with equal  Force, in a different Stile, help to keep up the tottering Profession  from immediately falling into Ruin. The one is inimitable for a  privileg'd Gift of Singing, and for enchanting the World with a  prodigious Felicity in executing, and with a singular Brilliant (I know  not whether from Nature or Art) which pleases to Excess. The delightful,  soothing _Cantabile_ of the other, joined with the Sweetness of a fine  Voice, a perfect Intonation, Strictness of Time, and the rarest  Productions of a Genius, are Qualifications as particular and uncommon,  as they are difficult to be imitated. The _Pathetick_ of the one, and  the _Allegro_ of the other, are the Qualities the most to be admired  respectively in each of them. What a beautiful Mixture would it be, if  the Excellence of these two angelick Creatures could be united in one  single Person! But let us not lose Sight of the Master.    Sec. 74. He will also convince the Scholar, that the Artifice of a  Professor is never more pleasing, than when he deceives the Audience  with agreeable Surprizes; for which reason he will advise him to have  Recourse to a seeming Plainness, as if he aim'd at nothing else.    Sec. 75. But when the Audience is in no farther Expectation, and (as I may  say) grows indolent, he will direct him to rouse them that Instant with  a _Grace_.    Sec. 76. When they are again awake, he will direct him to return to his  feigned Simplicity, though it will no more be in his power to delude  those that hear him, for with an impatient Curiosity they already expect  a second, and so on.    Sec. 77. He will give him ample Instructions concerning _Graces_ of all  sorts, and furnish him with Rules and profitable Documents.    Sec. 78. Here should I inveigh (though I could not enough) against the  Treachery of my Memory, that has not preserved, as it ought, all those  peculiar Excellencies which a great Man did once communicate to me,  concerning _Passages_ and _Graces_; and to my great Sorrow, and perhaps  to the Loss of others, it will not serve me to publish any more than  these few poor Remains, the Impressions of which are still left, and  which I am now going to mention.          CHAP. X.    _Of_ Passages _or_ Graces.      _Passages_ or _Graces_ being the principal Ornaments in Singing, and the  most favourite Delight of the Judicious, it is proper that the Singer be  very attentive to learn this Art.    Sec. 2. Therefore, let him know, that there are five principal  Qualifications, which being united, will bring him to admirable  Perfection, _viz._ _Judgment_, _Invention_, _Time_, _Art_, and _Taste_.    Sec. 3. There are likewise five subaltern Embellishments _viz._ the  _Appoggiatura_, the _Shake_, the _putting forth of the Voice_, the  _Gliding_, and _Dragging_.    _The principal Qualifications teach,_    Sec. 4. That the _Passages_ and _Graces_ cannot be form'd but from a  profound _Judgment_.    Sec. 5. That they are produced by a singular and beautiful _Invention_,  remote from all that is vulgar and common.    Sec. 6. That, being govern'd by the rigorous, but necessary, Precepts of  _Time_, they never transgress its regulated Measure, without losing  their own Merit.    Sec. 7. That, being guided by the most refined _Art_ on the Bass, they may  There (and no where else) find their Center; there to sport with  Delight, and unexpectedly to charm.    Sec. 8. That, it is owing to an exquisite _Taste_, that they are executed  with that sweet _putting forth_ of the Voice, which is so enchanting.    _From the accessory Qualities is learned,_    Sec. 9. That the _Graces_ or _Passages_ be easy in appearance, thereby to  give universal Delight.    Sec. 10. That in effect They be difficult that thereby the Art of the  Inventor be the more admired.    Sec. 11. That They be performed with an equal regard to the Expression of  the Words, and the Beauty of the Art.    Sec. 12. That They be _gliding_ or _dragging_ in the _Pathetick_, for They  have a better Effect than those that are mark'd.    Sec. 13. That They do not appear studied, in order to be the more regarded.    Sec. 14. That They be softened with the _Piano_ in the _Pathetick_, which  will make them more affecting.    Sec. 15. That in the _Allegro_ They be sometimes accompanied with the  _Forte_ and the _Piano_, so as to make a sort of _Chiaro Scuro_.    Sec. 16. That They be confin'd to a _Group_ of a few Notes, which are more  pleasing than those which are too numerous.    Sec. 17. That in a slow _Time_, there may be a greater Number of them (if  the Bass allows it) with an Obligation upon the Singer to keep to the  Point propos'd, that his Capacity be made more conspicuous.    Sec. 18. That They be properly introduc'd, for in a wrong Place They  disgust.    Sec. 19. That They come not too close together, in order to keep them  distinct.    Sec. 20. That They should proceed rather from the Heart than from the  Voice, in order to make their way to the Heart more easily.    Sec. 21. That They be not made on the second or fourth Vowel, when closely  pronounc'd, and much less on the third and fifth.    Sec. 22. That They be not copied, if you would not have them appear  defective.    Sec. 23. That They be stol'n on the _Time_, to captivate the Soul.    Sec. 24. That They never be repeated in the same place, particularly in  _Pathetick Airs_, for there they are the most taken Notice of by the  Judicious.    Sec. 25. And, above all, let them be improv'd; by no means let them lose in  the Repetition.    Sec. 26. Many Professors are of Opinion, that in _Graces_ there is no room  for the marked _Divisions_, unless mix'd with some of the aforesaid  Embellishments or some other agreable Accidents.    Sec. 27. But it is now time that we speak of the _Dragging_, that, if the  _Pathetick_ should once return again into the World, a Singer might be  able to understand it. The Explanation would be easier understood by  Notes of Musick than by Words, if the Printer was not under great  Difficulty to print a few Notes; notwithstanding which, I'll endeavour,  the best I can, to make myself understood.    Sec. 28. When on an even and regular Movement of a Bass, which proceeds  slowly, a Singer begins with a high Note, dragging it gently down to a  low one, with the _Forte_ and _Piano_, almost gradually, with  Inequality of Motion, that is to say, stopping a little more on some  Notes in the Middle, than on those that begin or end the _Strascino_ or  _Dragg_.[109] Every good musician takes it for granted, that in the Art  of Singing there is no Invention superior, or Execution more apt to  touch the Heart than this, provided however it be done with Judgment,  and with putting forth of the Voice in a just _Time_ on the Bass.  Whosoever has most Notes at Command, has the greater Advantage; because  this pleasing Ornament is so much the more to be admired, by how much  the greater the Fall is. Perform'd by an excellent _Soprano_, that makes  use of it but seldom, it becomes a Prodigy; but as much as it pleases  descending, no less would it displease ascending.    Sec. 29. Mind this, O my beloved Singers! For it is to You only, who are  inclined to study, that I have addressed myself. This was the Doctrine  of the School of those Professors, whom, by way of Reproach, some  mistaken Persons call _Ancients_. Observe carefully its Rules, examine  strictly its Precepts, and, if not blinded by Prejudice, you will see  that this School ought to sing in Tune, to put forth the Voice, to make  the Words understood, to express, to use proper Gesture, to perform in  _Time_, to vary on its Movement, to compose, and to study the  _Pathetick_, in which alone Taste and Judgment triumph. Confront this  School with yours, and if its Precepts should not be sufficient to  instruct you, learn what's wanting from the _Modern_.    Sec. 30. But if these my Exhortations, proceeding from my Zeal, have no  Weight with you, as the Advice of Inferiors is seldom regarded, allow at  least, that whoever has the Faculty of Thinking, may once in sixty Years  think right. And if you think, that I have been too partial to the Times  past, then would I persuade you, (if you have not a shaking Hand) to  weigh in a just Ballance your most renowned Singers; who you take to be  _Moderns_ (but are not so, except in their _Cadences_;) and having  undeceived yourselves, you will perceive in them, that instead of  Affectations, Abuses, and Errors, They sing according to those powerful  Lessons that give Delight to the Soul, and whose Perfections have made  Impressions on me, and which I shall always remember with the greatest  Pleasure. Do but consult them, as I have done, and they will truly and  freely tell you, That They sell their Jewels where they are understood;  That the Singers of Eminence are not of the _Mode_, and that at present  there are many bad Singers.    Sec. 31. True it is, that there are some, tho' few, very good Singers, who,  when the"]]]
