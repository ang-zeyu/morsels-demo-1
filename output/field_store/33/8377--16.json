Then stir for half an hour the sugar  with the egg-yolks and the taste of lemon peel. Beat well the white of  the eggs and pour them on the sugar and yolks. Add the flour and potato  meal letting them fall from a sieve and stir slowly until everything is  well mixed together. Add the currants and the pieces of candied fruits  and pour the mixing in a smooth mold or in a high and round cake-dish.  Grease the mold or the dish with butter and sprinkle with powdered sugar  or flour. Put at once in the oven to avoid that the currants and the  candied fruits fall in the oven.      186    MARGHERITA CAKE    (Pasta Margherita)      Potato meal, three ounces.    Sugar, six ounces.    Four eggs.    Lemon juice.    Beat well the egg-yolks with the sugar, add the potato meal and the  lemon juice and stir everything for half an hour. Finally beat well the  whites, and mix the rest, stirring continually but slowly. Pour the  mixture in a smooth and round mold, greased with butter and sprinkled  with powdered sugar. Put at once in the oven.    Remove from the mold when cold and dust with powdered sugar and vanilla.      187    MANTUA TART    (Torta Mantovana)      Flour, six ounces.    Sugar, six ounces.    Butter, five ounces.    Sweet almonds and pine-seeds, two ounces.    One whole egg.    Four egg-yolks.    A taste of lemon peel.    First work well with a ladle the eggs with the sugar, then pour the  flour little by little, still stirring, and finally the butter,  previously melted in a double steamer (bain-marie). Put the mixture in a  pie-dish greased with butter and sprinkled with flour or bread crumbs  ground. On top put the almonds and the pine-seeds. Cut the latter in  half and cut the almonds, previously skinned in warm water, each in  eight or ten pieces. This tart must not be thicker than one inch, so  that it can dry well in the oven, which must not be too hot.    Sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve cold.      188    CURLY TART    (Torta ricciolina)      Sweet almonds with a few bitter ones, four ounces,    Granulated sugar, six ounces,    Candied fruits or angelica, 2-1/2 ounces,    Butter, two ounces,    Lemon peel.    Mix two eggs with flour, flatten the paste to a thin sheet on a bread  board and cut into thin noodles. In a corner of the bread board make a  heap of the almonds with the sugar, the candied fruit cut in pieces and  the grated lemon peel. All this cut and crush so as to reduce the  mixture in little pieces. Then take a pie-dish and without greasing it,  spread a layer of noodles on the bottom, then pour part of the mixture,  then another layer of noodles and continue until there remains no more  material, trying to have the tart at least one inch thick. When it is so  prepared cover with the melted butter, using a brush to apply it evenly.      189    ALMOND CAKE    (Bocca di dama)      Granulated sugar, nine ounces,    Very fine Hungarian flour, five ounces,    Sweet almonds with some bitter ones, two ounces,    Six whole eggs and three egg yolks,    Taste of lemon peel.    After skinning the almonds in warm water and drying them well, grind or  better pound them well together with a tablespoonful of sugar and mix  well with the flour. Put the rest of the sugar in a deep dish with the  egg yolks and the grated lemon peel (just a taste) and stir with a ladle  for a quarter of an hour. In another dish beat the six whites of egg and  when they have become quite thick mix them with other ingredients  stirring slowly everything together.    To bake place the mixture in a baking-tin greased evenly with butter and  sprinkled with powdered sugar and flour.      190    CORN MEAL CAKES    (Pasta di farina gialla)      Corn meal, seven and a half ounces,    Wheat flour, five and a half ounces,    Granulated sugar, five and a half ounces,    Butter, three and a half ounces,    Lard, two ounces,    A pinch of anise seed,    One egg.    Mix together the corn meal, the flour and the anise seed and knead with  the butter, the lard and the egg that quantity that you can, forming a  loaf that you will put aside. What remains is to be kneaded with water  forming another loaf. Then mix the two loaves and knead a little, not  much because the dough must remain soft. Flatten with the rolling pin  until it becomes one quarter of an inch thick, sprinkle with flour, and  cut in different sizes and shapes with thin stamps.    Grease a baking tin with lard, sprinkle, with flour, glaze with the egg,  bake and dust with powdered sugar.      191    BISCUIT    (Biscotto)      Six eggs,    Granulated sugar, nine ounces,    Flour, four ounces,    Potato meal, two ounces,    Taste of lemon peel.    Stir for at least half an hour the yolks of the eggs with the sugar and  a tablespoonful only of the flour and meal, using a ladle. Beat the  whites of the eggs until they are quite firm, mix slowly with the first  mixture and when they are well incorporated pour over from a sieve the  flour and the potato meal, previously dried in the sun or on the fire.    Bake in a tin where the mixture comes about one inch and a half thick,  previously greasing the tin with cold butter and sprinkle with powdered  sugar mixed with flour.    In these cakes with beaten whites the following method can also be  followed: mix and stir first the yolks with the sugar, then put the  flour then, after a good kneading, beat the whites until they are firm,  pour two tablespoonfuls to soften the mixture, then the rest little by  little.      192    CAKE MADELEINE    (Pasta Maddalena)      Sugar, four and a half ounces,    Flour, three ounces,    Butter, one ounce,    Egg-yolks, four,    Whites of eggs, three,    A pinch of bi-carbonate of soda,    A taste of lemon peel.    First mix and stir the yolks with the sugar and when they have become  whitish, add the flour and stir for fifteen minutes more. Mix with the  butter, melting or softening it fine if it is hard and finally add the  whites when they are well beaten. The flour must be previously dried in  the sun or on the fire.    This cake may be given different shapes, but keep it always thin and in  little volume. It can be put in little molds greased with butter and  sprinkled with flour, or else in a baking tin, keeping it not more than  half an inch thick, and cutting it after baking in the shape of diamonds  and dusting with powdered sugar.      193    ALMOND CRISP-TART    (Croccante)      Sweet almonds, four and a half ounces.    Granulated sugar, three and a half ounces.    Skin the almonds, divide the two parts and cut each part into small  pieces. Put these almonds so cut at the fire and dry them until they  take a yellowish color, but do not toast. Meanwhile put the sugar on the  fire in a saucepan and, when it is perfectly melted, pour the almonds  hot and already slightly browned. Now lower the fire and be careful not  to allow the compound to be overdone. The precise point is known when  the mixture acquires a cinnamon color. Then pour little by little in a  cold mold, previously greased with butter or oil. Press with a lemon  against the walls of the mold, making the mixture as thin as possible.  Remove from the mold when perfectly cooled and, if it is difficult to do  so, dip the mold in boiling water.    The almonds can also be dried in the sun and chopped fine, adding a  small piece of butter when they are in the sugar.      194    WAFER BISCUITS    (Cialdoni)    Put in a kettle:      Flour, three ounces.    Brown sugar, one ounce.    Lard virgin, half an ounce.    Cold water, seven tablespoonfuls.    First dilute the flour and the sugar in the water, then add the lard.    Put on the fire the iron for waffles or better an appropriated iron for  flattened wafers. When it is quite hot open it and place each time half  a tablespoonful of the paste. Close the iron and press well. Pass over  the fire on both sides, trim all around with a knife and open the iron  when you see that the wafer is browned. Then detach it from one side of  the iron and hot as it is roll it on the iron itself or on a napkin  using a little stick. This operation must be made with great rapidity  because if the wafer gets cold, it cannot be rolled.    Should the wafers remain attached to the iron, grease it from time to  time, and if they are not firm enough, add a little flour.    These wafer-biscuits are generally served with whipped cream.      195    QUINCE CAKE    (Cotognata)    The ingredients are about six pounds of quinces and four pounds of  granulated sugar.    Put on the fire the apples covered with water, and when they begin to  crack remove them, skin and scrape to put together all the pulp. Rub the  latter through a sieve. Put back the pulp on the fire with the sugar and  stir continually in order that it may not attack to the bottom of the  kettle. It will be enough to boil for seven or eight minutes and remove  when it begins to form pieces when lifted with the ladle.    Now in order to prepare the quince-cake spread it on a board to the  thickness of about a silver dollar and dry it in the sun covered with  cheese cloth to keep away the flies. When it is dry cut it in the form  of chocolate tablets and remove each piece from the board passing the  blade of a knife underneath.    If it is wished to make it crisp, melt about three and a half pounds of  granulated sugar with two tablespoonfuls of water and when the sugar has  boiled enough to \"make the thread\" smear every one of the little quince  cakes with it. If the sugar becomes too hard during the operation put it  back on the fire with a little water and make it boil again. When the  sugar is dry on one side and on the edge, smear the other side.      196    PORTUGUESE CAKE    (Focaccia alla Portoghese)      Sweet almonds, five ounces.    Granulated sugar, five ounces.    Potato meal, one and a half ounce.    Three eggs.    One big orange or two small."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24409"],[0,"Our Common Insects (#15)"],[1,"Nuche.

Bot Fly of Ox, and Larva.]    [Illustration: 82. Sheep Bot.]    [Illustration: 83. Skin Bot Fly.]    The Bot fly of the horse, (Gastrophilus equi, Fig. 80 and larva), is  pale yellowish, spotted with red, with short, grayish, yellow hairs, and  the wings are banded with reddish. She lays her eggs upon the knees of  the horse. They are conveyed into the stomach, where the larva lives  from May until October, and when full grown are found hanging by their  mouth hooks on the edge of the rectum of the horse, whence they are  carried out in the excrement. The pupa state lasts for thirty or forty  days, and the perfect fly appears the next season, from June until  October.    The Bot fly of the ox (Hypoderma bovis, Fig. 81, and larva), is black  and densely hairy, and the thorax is banded with yellow and white. The  larva is found during the month of May, and also in summer, living in  tumors on the backs of cattle. When fully grown, which is generally in  July, they make their way out and fall to the ground, and live in the  pupa-case from twenty-six to thirty days, the fly appearing from May  until September. It is found all over the world. The Oestrus ovis, or  sheep Bot fly (Fig. 82, larva), is of a dirty ash color. The abdomen is  marbled with yellowish and white flecks, and is hairy at the end. This  species of Bot fly is larviparous, i.e., the eggs are hatched within the  body of the mother, the larvae being produced alive. M. F. Brauer, of  Vienna, the author of the most thorough work we have on these flies,  tells me that he knows of but one other Bot fly (a species of  Cephanomyia) which produces living larvae instead of eggs. The eggs of  certain other species of Bot flies do not hatch until three or four days  after they are laid. The larvae of the sheep Bot fly live, during April,  May and June, in the frontal sinus of the sheep, and also in the nasal  cavity, whence they fall to the ground when fully grown. In twenty-four  hours they change to pupae, and the flies appear during the summer.    We also figure the Cuterebra buccata (Fig. 83; _a_, side view,) which  resembles in the larval state the ox Bot fly. Its habits are not known,  though the young of other species infest the opossum, squirrel, hare,  etc., living in subcutaneous tumors.    [Illustration: The banded Lithacodes.]          CHAPTER VII.    THE HOUSE FLY AND ITS ALLIES.      [Illustration: 84. Mouth-parts of the House fly.]    The common House fly, Musca domestica, scarcely needs an introduction to  any one of our readers, and its countenance is so well known that we  need not present a portrait here. But a study of the proboscis of the  fly reveals a wonderful adaptability of the mouth-parts of this insect  to their uses. We have already noticed the most perfect condition of  these parts as seen in the horse fly. In the proboscis of the house fly  the hard parts are obsolete, and instead we have a fleshy tongue like  organ (Fig. 84), bent up beneath the head when at rest. The maxillae are  minute, their palpi (_mp_) being single-jointed, and the mandibles (_m_)  are comparatively useless, being very short and small, compared with the  lancet-like jaws of the mosquito or horse fly. But the structure of the  tongue itself (labium, l) is most curious. When the fly settles upon a  lump of sugar or other sweet object, it unbends its tongue, extends it,  and the broad knob-like end divides into two broad, flat, muscular  leaves (_l_), which thus present a sucker-like surface, with which the  fly laps up liquid sweets. These two leaves are supported upon a  framework of tracheal tubes. In the cut given above, Mr. Emerton has  faithfully represented these modified trachae, which end in hairs  projecting externally. Thus the inside of this broad fleshy expansion  is rough like a rasp, and as Newport states, \"is easily employed by the  insect in scraping or tearing delicate surfaces. It is by means of this  curious structure that the busy house fly occasions much mischief to the  covers of our books, by scraping off the albuminous polish, and leaving  tracings of its depredations in the soiled and spotted appearance which  it occasions on them. It is by means of these also that it teases us in  the heat of summer, when it alights on the hand or face to sip the  perspiration as it exudes from, and is condensed upon, the skin.\"    [Illustration: 85. Larva; _a_, Pupa-case of House fly.]    [Illustration: 86. Larva of Flesh fly.]    Every one notices that house flies are most abundant around barns in  August and September, and it is in the ordure of stables that the early  stages of this insect are passed. No one has traced the transformations  of this fly in our country, but we copy from Bouche's work on the  transformations of insects, the rather rude figures of the larva (Fig.  85), and pupa-case (_a_) of the Musca domestica of Europe, which is  supposed to be our species. Bouche states that the larva is cylindrical,  rounded posteriorly, smooth and shining, fleshy, and yellowish white,  and four lines long. The pupa-case, or puparium, is dark reddish-brown,  and three lines in length. It remains in the pupa state from eight to  fourteen days. In Europe it is preyed upon by minute ichneumon flies  (Chalcids). The flesh fly, Musca Caesar, or the Blue-bottle fly, feeds  upon decaying animal matter. Its larva (Fig. 86) is long, cylindrical,  the head being pointed, and the body conical, the posterior end being  squarely docked. The larva of a Sargus-like form which feeds on offal,  transforms into a flattened pupa-case (Fig. 87), provided with long,  scattered hairs. The House fly disappears in autumn, at the approach of  cold weather, though a few individuals pass through the winter,  hibernating in houses, and when the rooms are heated may often be seen  flying on the windows. Other species fly early in March, on warm days,  having hibernated under leaves, and the bark of trees, moss, etc. An  allied species, the M. vomitoria, is the Meat fly. Closely allied are  the parasitic species of Tachina, which live within the bodies of  caterpillars and other insects, and are among the most beneficial of  insects, as they prey on thousands of injurious caterpillars. Another  fly of this Muscid group, the Idia Bigoti, according to Coquerel and  Mondiere, produces in the natives of Senegal, hard, red, fluctuating  tumors, in which the larva resides.    [Illustration: 87. Larva of a Sargus-like fly.]    Many of the smaller Muscids mine leaves, running galleries within the  leaf, or burrowing in seeds or under the bark of plants. We have often  noticed blister-like swellings on the bark of the willow, which are  occasioned by a cylindrical, short, fleshy larva (Fig. 88_a_, much  enlarged), about a line in length, which changes to a pupa within the  old larval skin, assuming the form here represented (Fig. 88_b_), and  about the last of June changes to a small black fly (Fig. 88), which  Baron Osten Sacken refers doubtfully to the genus Lonchaea.    [Illustration: 86. Willow Blister fly.]    The Apple midge frequently does great mischief to apples after they are  gathered. Mr. F. G. Sanborn states that nine-tenths of the apple crop in  Wrentham, Mass., were destroyed by a fly supposed to be the Molobrus  mali, or Apple midge, described by Dr. Fitch. \"The eggs were supposed to  have been laid in fresh apples, in the holes made by the Coddling moth  (Carpocapsa pomonella), whence the larvae penetrated into all parts of  the apple, working small cylindrical burrows about one-sixteenth of an  inch in diameter.\" Mr. W. C. Fish has also sent me, from Sandwich,  Mass., specimens of another kind of apple worm, which he writes has been  very common in Barnstable county. \"It attacks mostly the earlier  varieties, seeming to have a particular fondness for the old fashioned  Summer, or High-top Sweet. The larvae (Fig. 89 _a_) enter the fruit  usually where it has been bored by the Apple worm (Carpocapsa), not  uncommonly through the crescent-like puncture of the curculio, and  sometimes through the calyx, when it has not been troubled by other  insects. Many of them arrive at maturity in August, and the fly soon  appears, successive generations of the maggots following until cold  weather. I have frequently found the pupae in the bottom of barrels in a  cellar in the winter, and the flies appear in the spring. In the early  apples, the larvae work about in every direction. If there be several in  an apple, they make it unfit for use. Apples that appear perfectly sound  when taken from the tree, will sometimes, if kept, be all alive with  them in a few weeks.\" Baron Osten Sacken informs me that it is a  Drosophila, \"the species of which live in putrescent vegetable matter,  especially fruits.\"    [Illustration: 89. Apple Worm and its Larva.]    [Illustration: 90. Parent of the Cheese Maggot.]    [Illustration: 91. Pupa case of Wine-fly.]    An allied fly is the parent of the cheese maggot. The fly itself  (Piophila casei, Fig. 90) is black, with metallic green reflections, and  the legs are dark and paler at the knee-joints, the middle and hind pair  of tarsi being dark honey yellow. The Wine fly is also a Piophila, and  lives the life of a perpetual toper in old wine casks, and partially  emptied beer, cider and wine bottles, where, with its pupa-case (Fig.  91), it may be found floating dead in its favorite beverage.    [Illustration: 92. Bird Tick.]    We now come to the more degraded forms of flies which live parasitically  on various animals. We figure, from a specimen in the Museum of the  Peabody Academy of Science, the Bird tick (Ornithomyia, Fig. 92), which  lives upon the Great Horned Owl. Its body is much flattened, adapted for  its life under the feathers, where it gorges itself with the blood "]]]
