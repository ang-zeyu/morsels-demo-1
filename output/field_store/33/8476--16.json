If the batter is too stiff to stir well, thin with either a  little sweet cream or boiling water, or cordial. Pour into pans buttered  and lined with five thicknesses of buttered paper, set the pans in other  pans of hot water inside a warm but not brisk oven, shield the tops with  double paper, and let rise half an hour. Increase heat then, but the  baking must be slow. Four to five hours is required, according to the  size of pans. Keep covered until the last half hour--then the heat may  be sensibly increased. Test with straws--when they come out clean, take  up, set pans on racks, cover with thick cloth and let cool thoroughly.  Frost next day, with either plain or boiled frosting. By baking the  cake in rather small square molds, set close in a larger pan, the  squares can be cut without waste and frosted to make individual cakes.    _White Layer Cake_: (Mrs. George H. Patch.) Sift two teaspoonfuls baking  powder through three and a half cups flour, measured before sifting.  Cream a cup of butter with two and one half cups sugar, add a cup of  rich milk, beat hard, then add gradually the flour, following it with  the whites of seven eggs beaten very stiff with a small pinch of salt.  Fold in lightly, and bake in three layers. Put together with orange  filling, or frosting made thick with nuts and minced figs.    _German Coffee Cake_: (Mrs. T. G. Petre.) Beat six fresh eggs very light  with one pound of sugar, and one pound flour. Add the peel of a lemon  grated, and one yeast cake dissolved in a little hot milk or water. Let  stand till very light, then roll into sheets one inch thick, spread them  thickly with melted butter--half a pound will be required, sprinkle with  two ounces bitter almonds blanched and shredded fine, mixed with four  ounces sugar, and a teaspoonful powdered cinnamon. Let rise again, and  bake in a moderate oven. Good hot or cold.    _Cream Cake_: (Betsy Vaughn.) Cream together very light two cups butter,  three cups sugar, one cup sweet cream. Add gradually four cups flour  sifted with one teaspoonful baking powder, then fold in the whites of  fourteen eggs beaten very stiff with a pinch of salt. Flavor with bitter  almonds, bake in loaves or layers, and frost with pink icing, flavored  with rose water.    _Sponge Cake_: Beat very light the yolks of seven eggs with three cups  sifted sugar, and a pinch of salt. Add to them gradually a cup of hot  water, then three scant cups flour sifted thrice with two teaspoonfuls  baking powder. Fold in last the stiffly beaten white of the eggs, pour  into greased pans, and bake in a quick oven. The batter must not be too  thin. If the eggs are large only half a cup of water may be requisite.  Flavor with vanilla, putting orange or lemon in the frosting.    _White Sponge Cake_: Beat very stiff six egg-whites, add to them  gradually a cup of sugar, and a cup of flour sifted twice with a  teaspoonful of baking powder. Do not forget a tiny pinch of salt in the  eggs.    _Angel's Food_: Beat to a stiff froth with a pinch of salt, the whites  of eleven eggs. Mix in gradually a cup and a half of powdered sugar,  then add a cup of flour sifted twice with a teaspoonful cream of tartar.  Mix smooth, add the strained juice of half a lemon, pour into a smooth,  ungreased pan, bake in a moderate oven half an hour, take up, turn pan  upside down on a cloth and let stand till the cake falls out.    _Chocolate Cake_: Sift together two cups flour, one cup corn starch, and  two teaspoonfuls baking powder, add to a cup of butter, creamed light  with two cups sugar and one cup sweet cream. Add the stiffly beaten  whites of seven eggs, flavor with vanilla, and bake in layers. For the  filling boil together to a thick syrup, three cups sugar, one cup water,  and half a cake of grated chocolate. Pour upon three egg-whites beaten  very stiff, flavor with vanilla or bitter almond, and spread between  layers.    _Orange Cake_: Cream a cup of butter with two cups sugar, beat into it a  cup of cold water, then add four cups flour thrice sifted with two  teaspoonfuls baking powder, alternate the flour with three well-beaten  eggs. Flavor to taste, bake in layers, and put together with orange  frosting made thus. Cook together till it threads the strained juice,  and grated yellow peel of a large sweet orange with one cup sugar, then  beat the hot syrup into two egg-whites whipped as stiff as possible.  Beat smooth and spread while hot.    _Dream Cakes_: Cream well half a cup butter, add a cup and a half of  sugar, half a cup cold water, two cups flour sifted twice with two  teaspoonfuls baking powder, a teaspoonful lemon extract, and the stiffly  beaten whites of six eggs. Bake in small shapes, frost, with boiled  frosting, and ornament with tiny pink candies.    _Shrewsbury Cakes_: This receipt with two that follow, comes down from:  \"The spacious days of great Elizabeth.\" They are given verbatim, from  the original version, as it seems to me the flavor of the language must  add to the flavor of the cakes. \"Mix half a pound of butter, well beat  like cream, with the same weight of flour, one egg, six ounces of beaten  and sifted loaf sugar, and half an ounce of caraway seed. Form these  into a paste, roll them thin, and lay them in sheets of tin, then bake  them in a slow oven.\"    _Queen Cakes_: \"Take a pound of sugar, beat and sift it, a pound of well  dried flour, a pound of butter, eight eggs, and half a pound of  currants, washed and picked; grate a nutmeg and an equal quantity of  mace and cinnamon, work the butter to a cream, put in the sugar, beat  the whites of the eggs twenty minutes and mix them with the butter and  sugar. Then beat the yolks for half an hour, and put them to the butter.  Beat the whole together and when it is ready for the oven, put in the  flour, spices and currants, sift a little sugar over them, and bake them  in tins.\"    _Banbury Cakes_: \"Take a pound of dough, made for white bread, roll it  out and put bits of butter upon the same as for puff paste, till a pound  of the same has been worked in; roll it out very thin, then cut it into  bits of an oval size, according as the cakes are wanted. Mix some good  moist sugar with a little brandy, sufficient to wet it, then mix some  clean-washed currants with the former, put a little upon each bit of  paste, close them up, and put the side that is closed next the tin they  are to be baked upon. Lay them separate, and bake them moderately, and  afterward, when taken out, sift sugar over them. Some candied peel may  be added, or a few drops essence of lemon.\"    _Oatmeal Cookies_: (Mrs. T. G. Petre.) Beat together until creamy, one  egg, half cup sugar, third cup butter, third teaspoonful soda mixed with  one cup sifted pastry flour, half teaspoonful each of salt and cinnamon,  then add one cup rolled oatmeal, half cup each of shredded nuts and  raisins. Mix well, drop on greased tin, and bake in a slow oven. Do not  let the stiffness of the dough induce you to add milk or water.    _Tea Cakes_: (Betsy Vaughn.) Cream together a cup and a half of butter,  and two cups and a half of sugar, add to five eggs beaten very light,  mix well, then add a cup and a half of buttermilk with a small  teaspoonful of soda dissolved in it. Pour upon flour enough to make a  soft dough, flavor with nutmeg, roll out a quarter-inch thick, cut with  a small, round cutter, and bake in a quick but not scorching oven.    _Tea Cakes_: (M. L. Williams.) Beat five eggs very light, with five cups  of sugar, a heaping cup of lard, well creamed, and two cupfuls of sour  milk, with a teaspoonful of soda dissolved in it. Mix through enough  flour to make a soft dough, roll half an inch thick, cut out and bake in  a quick oven.    _Plain Soft Gingerbread_: Dissolve a desert spoonful of soda in a cup of  boiling water, add to it a cup of rich molasses, along with three  tablespoonfuls of melted butter. Mix well through two and and one half  cups sifted flour, add ground ginger and alspice to taste, and bake in a  moderate oven.    _Mammy's Ginger Cakes_: Beat four eggs very light with a good pinch of  salt and a cup of coffee sugar. Add three cups of rich molasses, and a  cup of boiling water with two teaspoonfuls soda dissolved in it. Mix  well in two tablespoonfuls pounded ginger. Sift five pints of flour with  a teaspoonful of salt, rub into it lightly two cups sweet lard, then add  the molasses mixture and knead to a firm dough, adding more flour if  needed or, if too stiff, a little sweet milk. Roll out half an inch  thick, cut into big squares, bake in a quick oven, and brush over the  tops while blazing hot a little butter, molasses and boiling water. Let  stand in a warm place until dry. These might properly be called First  Monday Ginger Cakes, since our Mammy made them to sell upon that day to  the crowds which came to court, thereby turning many an honest fip or  picayune.    _Family Gingerbread_: Cup and a half dark molasses, half cup sugar,  small cup melted lard, cup boiling water with teaspoonful soda dissolved  in it, pinch of salt, sifted flour enough to make rather stiffer than  pound cake batter. Spices to taste--ginger, allspice, nutmeg, all in  powder, is a good mixture. Bake rather quickly.    _Solid Chocolate Cake_: (Mrs. R. Heim.) Cream together one cup butter,  two of sugar, add six egg-yolks beaten light, then add alternately one  cup sour milk with teaspoon soda dissolved in it, and three cups sifted  flour. Fold in egg-whites stiffly beaten then add half cake Baker's  chocolate melted, and three teaspoonfuls vanilla. Stir hard a minute,  pour in deep, well greased pan, and bake in moderate oven.    _Coffee Cake_: (Mrs. R. Heim.) Beat together until light, one egg, one  cup sugar, butter the size of a large egg. Add alternately one cup milk,  and two cups flour with two teaspoonfuls baking powder sifted in it.  Put in pan, and sprinkle thickly all over top with sugar and powdered  cinnamon.

As the  god dropped fainting to the ground, his hammer crashed against the  head of Hrungnir, who fell dead beside him, in such a position that  one of his ponderous legs was thrown over the recumbent god.          \"Thou now remindest me      How I with Hrungnir fought,      That stout-hearted Jotun,      Whose head was all of stone;      Yet I made him fall      And sink before me.\"                Saemund's Edda (Thorpe's tr.).      Thialfi, who, in the meanwhile, had disposed of the great clay giant  with its cowardly mare's heart, now rushed to his master's assistance,  but his efforts were unavailing, nor could the other gods, whom he  quickly summoned, raise the pinioning leg. While they were standing  there, helplessly wondering what they should do next, Thor's little  son Magni came up. According to varying accounts, he was then only  three days or three years old, but he quickly seized the giant's  foot, and, unaided, set his father free, declaring that had he only  been summoned sooner he would easily have disposed of both giant and  squire. This exhibition of strength made the gods marvel greatly,  and helped them to recognise the truth of the various predictions,  which one and all declared that their descendants would be mightier  than they, would survive them, and would rule in their turn over the  new heaven and earth.    To reward his son for his timely aid, Thor gave him the steed Gullfaxi  (golden-maned), to which he had fallen heir by right of conquest,  and Magni ever after rode this marvellous horse, which almost equalled  the renowned Sleipnir in speed and endurance.        Groa, the Sorceress    After vainly trying to remove the stone splinter from his forehead,  Thor sadly returned home to Thrud-vang, where Sif's loving efforts  were equally unsuccessful. She therefore resolved to send for Groa  (green-making), a sorceress, noted for her skill in medicine and for  the efficacy of her spells and incantations. Groa immediately signified  her readiness to render every service in her power to the god who had  so often benefited her, and solemnly began to recite powerful runes,  under whose influence Thor felt the stone grow looser and looser. His  delight at the prospect of a speedy deliverance made Thor wish to  reward the enchantress forthwith, and knowing that nothing could give  greater pleasure to a mother than the prospect of seeing a long-lost  child, he proceeded to tell her that he had recently crossed the  Elivagar, or ice streams, to rescue her little son Orvandil (germ) from  the frost giants' cruel power, and had succeeded in carrying him off  in a basket. But, as the little rogue would persist in sticking one of  his bare toes through a hole in the basket, it had been frost-bitten,  and Thor, accidentally breaking it off, had flung it up into the sky,  to shine as a star, known in the North as \"Orvandil's Toe.\"    Delighted with these tidings, the prophetess paused in her incantations  to express her joy, but, having forgotten just where she left off,  she was unable to continue her spell, and the flint stone remained  embedded in Thor's forehead, whence it could never be dislodged.    Of course, as Thor's hammer always did him such good service, it was  the most prized of all his possessions, and his dismay was very great  when he awoke one morning and found it gone. His cry of anger and  disappointment soon brought Loki to his side, and to him Thor confided  the secret of his loss, declaring that were the giants to hear of it,  they would soon attempt to storm Asgard and destroy the gods.          \"Wroth waxed Thor, when his sleep was flown,      And he found his trusty hammer gone;      He smote his brow, his beard he shook,      The son of earth 'gan round him look;      And this the first word that he spoke:      'Now listen what I tell thee, Loke;      Which neither on earth below is known,      Nor in heaven above: my hammer's gone.\"                Thrym's Quida (Herbert's tr.).        Thor and Thrym    Loki declared he would try to discover the thief and recover the  hammer, if Freya would lend him her falcon plumes, and he immediately  hastened off to Folkvang to borrow them. His errand was successful and  in the form of a bird he then winged his flight across the river Ifing,  and over the barren stretches of Joetun-heim, where he suspected that  the thief would be found. There he saw Thrym, prince of the frost  giants and god of the destructive thunder-storm, sitting alone on a  hill-side. Artfully questioning him, he soon learned that Thrym had  stolen the hammer and had buried it deep underground. Moreover, he  found that there was little hope of its being restored unless Freya  were brought to him arrayed as a bride.          \"I have the Thunderer's hammer bound      Fathoms eight beneath the ground;      With it shall no one homeward tread      Till he bring me Freya to share my bed.\"                Thrym's Quida (Herbert's tr.).      Indignant at the giant's presumption, Loki returned to Thrud-vang,  but Thor declared it would be well to visit Freya and try to prevail  upon her to sacrifice herself for the general good. But when the AEsir  told the goddess of beauty what they wished her to do, she flew into  such a passion that even her necklace burst. She told them that she  would never leave her beloved husband for any god, much less to marry  a detested giant and dwell in Joetun-heim, where all was dreary in the  extreme, and where she would soon die of longing for the green fields  and flowery meadows, in which she loved to roam. Seeing that further  persuasions would be useless, Loki and Thor returned home and there  deliberated upon another plan for recovering the hammer. By Heimdall's  advice, which, however, was only accepted with extreme reluctance,  Thor borrowed and put on Freya's clothes together with her necklace,  and enveloped himself in a thick veil. Loki, having attired himself as  handmaiden, then mounted with him in the goat-drawn chariot, and the  strangely attired pair set out for Joetun-heim, where they intended to  play the respective parts of the goddess of beauty and her attendant.          \"Home were driven      Then the goats,      And hitched to the car;      Hasten they must--      The mountains crashed,      The earth stood in flames:      Odin's son      Rode to Joetun-heim.\"                Norse Mythology (R. B. Anderson).      Thrym welcomed his guests at the palace door, overjoyed at the thought  that he was about to secure undisputed possession of the goddess  of beauty, for whom he had long sighed in vain. He quickly led them  to the banqueting-hall, where Thor, the bride elect, distinguished  himself by eating an ox, eight huge salmon, and all the cakes and  sweets provided for the women, washing down these miscellaneous viands  with the contents of two barrels of mead.    The giant bridegroom watched these gastronomic feats with amazement,  whereupon Loki, in order to reassure him, confidentially whispered  that the bride was so deeply in love with him that she had not been  able to taste a morsel of food for more than eight days. Thrym then  sought to kiss the bride, but drew back appalled at the fire of her  glance, which Loki explained as a burning glance of love. The giant's  sister, claiming the usual gifts, was not even noticed; wherefore  Loki again whispered to the wondering Thrym that love makes people  absent-minded. Intoxicated with passion and mead, which he, too,  had drunk in liberal quantities, the bridegroom now bade his servants  produce the sacred hammer to consecrate the marriage, and as soon as  it was brought he himself laid it in the pretended Freya's lap. The  next moment a powerful hand closed over the short handle, and soon  the giant, his sister, and all the invited guests, were slain by the  terrible Thor.          \"'Bear in the hammer to plight the maid;      Upon her lap the bruiser lay,      And firmly plight our hands and fay.'      The Thunderer's soul smiled in his breast;      When the hammer hard on his lap was placed,      Thrym first, the king of the Thursi, he slew,      And slaughtered all the giant crew.\"                Thrym's Quida (Herbert's tr.).      Leaving a smoking heap of ruins behind them, the gods then drove  rapidly back to Asgard, where the borrowed garments were given back  to Freya, much to the relief of Thor, and the AEsir rejoiced at the  recovery of the precious hammer. When next Odin gazed upon that part  of Joetun-heim from his throne Hlidskialf, he saw the ruins covered  with tender green shoots, for Thor, having conquered his enemy,  had taken possession of his land, which henceforth would no longer  remain barren and desolate, but would bring forth fruit in abundance.        Thor and Geirrod    Loki once borrowed Freya's falcon-garb and flew off in search of  adventures to another part of Joetun-heim, where he perched on top  of the gables of Geirrod's house. He soon attracted the attention  of this giant, who bade one of his servants catch the bird. Amused  at the fellow's clumsy attempts to secure him, Loki flitted about  from place to place, only moving just as the giant was about to lay  hands upon him, when, miscalculating his distance, he suddenly found  himself a captive.    Attracted by the bird's bright eyes, Geirrod looked closely at it and  concluded that it was a god in disguise, and finding that he could  not force him to speak, he locked him in a cage, where he kept him  for three whole months without food or drink. Conquered at last by  hunger and thirst, Loki revealed his identity, and obtained his release  by promising that he would induce Thor to visit Geirrod without his  hammer, belt, or magic gauntlet. Loki then flew back to Asgard, and  told Thor that he had been royally entertained, and that his host had  expressed a"]]]
