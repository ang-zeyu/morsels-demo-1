As to your expression,  \"considering our mutual regard\"--I don't know your idea of what is  \"mutual\" in friendship; mine is an equal interchange of good feeling.  Now if I were to mention that I passed over a province for your sake,  you might think me somewhat insincere; for, in point of fact, it suited  my convenience, and I feel more and more every day of my life the  advantage and pleasure which I have received from that decision. But  this I do say--the moment I had announced in public meeting my refusal  of a province, I began at once thinking how I might hand it on to you. I  say nothing as to the circumstances of your allotment: I only wish you  to suspect that nothing was done in that matter by my colleague without  my cognizance. Recall the other circumstances: how promptly I summoned  the senate on that day after the lots had been drawn, at what a length I  spoke about you. You yourself said at the time that my speech was not  merely complimentary to you, but absolutely a reflexion on your  colleagues. Farther, the decree of the senate passed on that day has  such a preamble that, so long as it is extant, there can never be any  doubt of my services to you. Subsequently, when you had gone out of  town, I would have you recall my motions in the senate, my speeches in  public meetings, my letters to yourself. And having reviewed all these  together, I would like you to judge yourself whether you think that your  approach to Rome the last time you came quite shewed an adequate return  for all these services.[59] Again, as to your expression, \"the  reconciliation effected between us\"--I do not understand why you speak  of \"reconciliation\" in the case of a friendship that had never been  broken. As to what you say, that your brother Metellus ought not \"to  have been attacked by me for a mere word,\" in the first place I would  like to assure you that your feeling and fraternal partiality--so full  of human kindness and natural affection--meet with my warmest  approbation; in the next place I must claim your indulgence if I have in  any matter opposed your brother in the interests of the Republic, for my  devotion to the Republic is paramount. If, however, it is my personal  safety that I have defended against a most ruthless assault of his, I  think you should be content that I make no complaint even to you of your  brother's injurious conduct. Now, when I had become aware that he was  deliberately making every preparation to use his tribunician office to  my ruin, I appealed to your wife Claudia[60] and your sister Mucia[61]  (of whose kindness to me for the sake of my friendship with Pompey I had  satisfied myself by many instances) to deter him from that injurious  conduct. And yet, as I am sure you have heard, on the last day of  December he inflicted upon me--a consul and the preserver of my  country--an indignity such as was never inflicted upon the most disloyal  citizen in the humblest office: that is to say, he deprived me when  laying down my office of the privilege of addressing the people--an  indignity, however, which after all redounded to my honour. For, upon  his forbidding me to do anything but take the oath, I pronounced an oath  at once the most absolutely true and the most glorious in a loud  voice--an oath which the people swore also in a loud voice to be  absolutely true. Though I had actually suffered this signal indignity, I  yet on that same day sent common friends to Metellus to persuade him to  alter his resolution; to whom he answered that he was no longer free to  do so. And, in fact, a short time previously he _had_ said in a public  meeting that a man who had punished others without trial ought not  himself to be allowed the privilege of speech. What a model of  consistency! What an admirable citizen! So he deemed the man who had  saved the senate from massacre, the city from the incendiary, Italy from  war, deserving of the same penalty as that inflicted by the senate, with  the unanimous approval of all loyal citizens, upon those who had  intended to set fire to the city, butcher magistrates and senate, and  stir up a formidable war! Accordingly, I did withstand your brother  Metellus to his face: for on the 1st of January, in the senate, I  maintained a debate with him on the state of the Republic, such as  taught him that he had to contend with a man of courage and firmness. On  the 3rd of January,[62] on again opening the debate, he kept harping on  me and threatening me at every third word of his speech; nor could any  intention be more deliberate than his was to overthrow me by any means  in his power, not by calm and judicial argument, but by violence and  mere browbeating. If I had not shewn some boldness and spirit in  opposing his intemperate attack, would not everyone have concluded that  the courage I had displayed in my consulship was the result of accident  rather than design? If you did not know that Metellus was contemplating  these measures in regard to me, you must consider that you have been  kept in the dark by your brother on matters of the utmost importance:  if, on the other hand, he did intrust any part of his designs to you,  then surely I ought to be regarded by you as a man of placable and  reasonable temper for not addressing a word of reproach to you even on  such occurrences as these. Understanding then that it was by no \"mere  word\" (as you express it) of Metellus that I was roused, but by his  deliberate policy and extraordinary animosity towards me, next observe  my forbearance--if \"forbearance\" is the name to be given to irresolution  and laxity under a most galling indignity. I never once delivered a vote  in a speech against your brother: every time a motion was before the  house I assented without rising to those whose proposal appeared to me  to be the mildest. I will also add that, though in the circumstances  there was no obligation upon me to do so, yet so far from raising  objections I actually did my best to secure that my enemy, because he  was your brother, should be relieved from penalties by a decree of the  senate.[63] Wherefore I have not \"attacked\" your brother, but only  defended myself from your brother's attack; nor have I been \"fickle\" (to  quote your word), but, on the contrary, so constant, that I remained  faithful to my friendship to you, though left without any sign of  kindness from you. For instance, at this moment, though your letter  amounts almost to a threat, I am writing back an answer such as you see.  I not only pardon your vexation, I even applaud it in the highest  degree; for my own heart tells me how strong is the influence of  fraternal affection. I ask you in your turn to put a liberal  construction upon my vexation, and to conclude that when attacked by  your relatives with bitterness, with brutality, and without cause, I not  only ought not to retract anything, but, in a case of that kind, should  even be able to rely upon the aid of yourself and your army. I have  always wished to have you as a friend: I have taken pains to make you  understand that I am a warm friend to you. I abide by that sentiment,  and shall abide by it as long as _you_ will let me; and I shall more  readily cease to be angry with your brother for love of you, than I  shall from anger with him abate in the smallest degree my kindness for  you.    [Footnote 58: Metellus had been employed with Antonius against the camp  at Faesulae, but was now engaged against some Alpine tribes.]    [Footnote 59: When Metellus was commanding against Catiline, it is  suggested that he marched towards Rome to support his brother, but this  is conjecture.]    [Footnote 60: Sister of P. Clodius. Of this famous woman we shall hear  often again. She is believed to be the Lesbia of Catullus, and she is  the \"Palatine Medea\" of the speech _pro Caelio_.

SESTIUS[64] (IN MACEDONIA)    ROME, DECEMBER      [Sidenote: B.C. 62, AET. 44]    Decius the copyist has been to see me, and begged me to try and secure  that no successor should be appointed to you this turn. Though I  regarded him as a man of good character and attached to you, yet,  remembering the tenor of your previous letter to me, I could not feel  certain that the wishes of a cautious man of the world like yourself had  undergone so complete a change. But after your wife Cornelia had called  on Terentia, and I had had a conversation with Q. Cornelius, I took care  to be present at every meeting of the senate, and found that the  greatest trouble was to make Fufius the tribune, and the others to whom  you had written, believe me rather than your own letters. The whole  business has, after all, been postponed till January, but there is no  difficulty about it. Roused by your congratulations--for in a letter  sometime ago you wished me good luck on the completion of my purchase of  a house from Crassus--I have bought that very house for 3,500 sestertia  (about L28,000), a good while subsequent to your congratulation.  Accordingly, you may now look upon me as being so deeply in debt as to  be eager to join a conspiracy if anyone would admit me! But, partly from  personal dislike they shut their doors in my face and openly denounce me  as the punisher of conspiracy, partly are "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21254"],[0,"In Africa: Hunting Adventures in the Big Game Country (#15)"],[1,"for busy doings. A rhino cow and half-grown calf were  discovered on a distant hillside. We stopped in a ravine to adjust the  picture machine and then crept cautiously up the hill until we were  within about seventy yards of the unsuspecting pair. Then the rhino  birds began to flutter and chatter and the two beasts began to sniff  nervously. Finally they turned toward us, with tails erect and noses  sniffing savagely. Now for the charge, we thought, for it was considered  an absolute certainty that a rhino cow accompanied by its calf would  always attack. We moved forward a few yards, clapped our hands to show  where we were, and their attitude at once became more threatening. They  rushed backward and forward a couple of times and faced us again.    By this time we knew that they saw us and our fingers were within the  trigger guards. It was agreed that, if they charged, they should be  allowed to come within forty feet before we fired, thus giving the  picture machine time to get a good record. The situation was intense  beyond description, and seconds seemed hours. When they started trotting  toward us we thought the fatal moment had come, but instead of  continuing the \"charge,\" they swung around and trotted swiftly off in an  opposite direction. As far as we could see them they trotted swiftly and  with the lightness of deer, sometimes zigzagging their course, but  always away from us. The charge had failed in spite of all our efforts  to provoke it. The whistling and hand-clapping which we had hoped would  give them our location without doubt had merely served to tell them the  way not to go.    The moving picture record of a \"charging rhino\" would have been a  brilliant success but for one thing--the rhino refused to charge.    During the following ten days we made many similar attempts to get a  charge and always with nearly the same results. Once or twice we got  within thirty yards before they finally turned tail after a number of  feints that looked much like the beginning of a nasty charge. It was  always intensely thrilling work because there was the likelihood that we  might get a charge in spite of the fact that a dozen or so previous  experiences had failed to precipitate one.    In several cases the first rush of the rhino was toward us, but instead  of continuing, he would soon swing about and make off, four times as  badly scared as we were. It seemed as though these preliminary rushes  toward us were efforts to verify the location of danger in order to  determine the right direction for escape. In all, we made between  fifteen and twenty different attempts on different rhinos to get a  charge, but with always practically the same result, yet with always the  same thrill of excitement and uncertainty.    [Drawing: _The End of the Charge_]    Comprehensive statistics on a rhino's charges are hard to obtain. The  district commissioner at Embo told me that he had been ordered to reduce  the number of rhinos in his district in the interest of public safety  and that he had killed thirty-five in all. Out of this number five  charged him. That would indicate that one rhino in seven will charge.  Captain Dickinson, in his book, _Big Game Shooting on the Equator_,  tells of a rhino that charged him so viciously that he threw down his  bedding roll and the rhino tossed it and trampled it with great  emphasis, after which it triumphantly trotted away, elated probably in  the thought that it had wiped out its enemy. A number of fatalities are  on record to prove that the rhino is a dangerous beast at times, and so  I must conclude that the rhino experiences we had were exceedingly lucky  ones, and perhaps exceptional ones in that respect.    In only one instance was it necessary for us to kill a rhino and even  then it was done more in the interest of photography than of urgent  necessity. On our game licenses we were each allowed to kill two rhinos,  and as I wanted, one of the Tana River variety it was arranged that I  should try to get the first big one with good horns. After a hunt of  several hours we found two of them together out on the slope of a long  hill. Our glasses showed that one of them was quite large and equipped  with a splendid front horn nearly two feet long and a rear horn about a  foot long. At the lower slope of the hill were two or three trees that  screened our approach so that we were easily enabled to get within about  one hundred and fifty yards of them without danger of discovery. From  the trees onward the country was an open prairie for two or three miles.    Armed with a double-barreled cordite rifle and the comforting reflection  that the chances were seven to one that the rhinos would not charge, I  slowly advanced alone toward the two rhinos. Behind me about fifty yards  was the long range camera and a second gun manned by Mr. Stephenson.  When fifty yards from the rhinos I stopped, but as no offensive tactics  were apparent in the camp of the enemy, I slowly walked forward to  thirty-five yards. Then they saw me. They faced me with what seemed like  an attitude of decided unfriendliness. Their tails were up and they were  snorting like steam engines. When the big one started toward me I fired  and it fell like a log. The other one, instead of thundering away,  according to expectations, became more belligerent. It ran a few steps,  then swung around, and I felt certain that it was going to avenge the  death of its comrade. The camera brigade rushed forward, clapping their  hands to scare it away, as there was no desire to kill both of the  animals. But it refused to go. It would sometimes run a few steps, then  it would turn and come toward us. It was evidently in a fighting mood,  with no intention of deserting the field of action. Finally by firing  shots in the air and yelling noisily it turned and dashed over the side  of the hill. The photograph, taken at the instant the big rhino was  struck, was remarkably dramatic and showed one rhino in an aggressive  attitude and the other just plunging down from the shot of the big  bullet.    The front horn of the dead rhino was twenty and three-quarters inches  long and in many places the animal's hide was over an inch thick. Strips  of this were cut off to make whips, and a large section was removed to  be made into a table top. These table tops, polished and rendered  translucent by the curing processes, are beautiful as well as extremely  interesting. The rhino's tongue is even more delicious to eat than ox  tongue and rhino tail soup is a great luxury on any white man's table;  while the native porters consider rhino meat the finest of any meat to  be had in Africa. The conscience of one who slays a rhino is somewhat  appeased by the fact that a hundred native porters will have a good  square meal of wholesome meat to help build up their systems.    [Drawing: _A Real Rhino Charge_]    Our expedition sustained only one real rhino charge. One day Mr.  Stephenson stumbled on a big cow rhino that was lying in the grass. The  meeting was as unexpected to him as to her, and before he could count  five she was rushing headlong toward him. He clapped his hands,  whistled, and shouted to turn her course, but she came on, snorting  loudly and with head ready to impale everything in its way. Stephenson  did not want to kill her, neither did he desire to be killed, so when  all other means had failed he fired a soft nose bullet into her shoulder  in the hope that it would turn her away without seriously hurting her.  The bullet seemed to have no effect and she did not change her course in  the slightest degree. By this time she was within a short distance of  Stephenson, who was obliged to run a few feet and take refuge behind a  tree.    [Photograph: The Sultan Looked Like an American Indian]    [Photograph: In the Thorn Brush on the Tana]    [Photograph: The Dummy Rhino]    The gunbearers and porters, who had fled in all directions, thought that  Stephenson was caught, but the rhino, passing him with only a small  margin of five feet, continued thunderously on her way. In a few yards  she slowed down, and when last seen was walking. She had evidently been  hit very hard by the soft nose bullet and was already showing signs of  sickness. Suddenly a terrific squealing made the party aware that the  cow rhino had been accompanied by a little rhino calf. The calf, only a  couple of weeks old, charged savagely at every one in sight and every  one in sight took refuge behind trees and bushes. Instead of trying to  escape, the animal turned and continued to attack in all directions  whenever a man showed himself. When a man leaped behind a tree the calf  would charge the tree with such force that it would be hurled back  several feet, only to spring up and charge again. His squealing could be  heard for a mile. After a long time the porters succeeded in capturing  it and they conveyed it back to camp strung on a pole. If that little  rhino was any criterion of rhino pugnacity, then surely the rhino is  born with the instinctive impulse to charge and to fight as savagely as  any animal alive.    We fed our little pet rhino on milk and then swung it in a comfortable  hammock made of zebra skin. In this more or less undignified fashion it  was carried by eight strong porters to Fort Hall, two marches away,  where it lived only a week or ten days and then, to our sorrow and  regret, succumbed from lack of proper nourishment.    [Drawing: _Retiring in Favor of Rhino_]    Sometimes, when the _safari_ is marching through bush country, the rhino  becomes an element of considerable anxiety; An armed party must precede  the caravan and clear the route of rhinos, otherwise the porters are  likely to be scattered by threatened charges. It is no uncommon sight to  see a crowd of heavily laden porters drop their loads and shin up the  nearest tree in record time. Consequently, strong protective measures  are always demanded when a"]]]
