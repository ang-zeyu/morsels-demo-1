They knew him well and loved him, and did their  best to serve him. To them he was really their commander, although they  officially recognized Colonel Wood. They were preeminently \"Roosevelt's  Rough Riders,\" and the great majority of the people of our nation call  them such to this day.    The majority of the command were rather young in years, although a few  were of middle age. But all were tough and hardy, either from athletic  training or from years spent in the open air of the great West. Some of  them could ride almost any kind of a horse, and \"bronco busting,\" that  is, breaking in a wild steed, was common sport among them. Some had  spent nearly their entire lives in the saddle, and some could exhibit  remarkable skill with their firearms while riding at full speed.    When the men began to come into San Antonio, they found but little in  the way of accommodations. But soon tents and blankets were procured. It  is said that good shoes were scarce, but some of the soldiers did not  mind going without them. The regiment was supplied with good rifles, but  the cartridges were not made of smokeless powder, which was a bad thing,  for smoke sometimes enables an enemy to locate the shooter, when, if  smokeless powder were used, nothing could be seen. Each man had also a  six shooter, and was to have had a machete, but the long knives did not  come.    \"On to Cuba!\" was the cry. And it was taken up every day. The Rough  Riders were eager for the fray. Alas! little did many of them realize  that, once in the \"bloody isle,\" they would never see their native land  again.          CHAPTER XIII    IN CAMP AT TAMPA--TO PORT TAMPA IN COAL CARS--THEODORE ROOSEVELT'S QUICK  MOVE TO OBTAIN A TRANSPORT--THE WAIT IN THE HARBOR--OFF FOR CUBA AT LAST      That the path of the soldier is not always one full of glory can easily  be proven by what happened to the Rough Riders when, late in May, they  were ordered to Tampa, Florida, where a part of the army was gathering  in readiness to be transported to Cuba.    \"We were just wild to go,\" says one of the number, in speaking of that  time. \"We were tired of staying at San Antonio and drilling day in and  day out, rain or shine. I guess everybody felt like hurrahing when we  piled on to the cars.    \"Colonel Roosevelt--he was only Lieutenant-Colonel then--had six troops  under him, and he did all he could to make the boys comfortable. But the  cars were crowded, and travelling was so slow it took us four days to  reach Tampa. Then when we got there, we found everything in confusion.  The railroad yard was chock-a-block with freight and passenger cars, and  nobody was there to tell us where to go or where to find provisions.    \"The boys were hungry and tired out, for sleeping on the railroad had  been almost out of the question. There wasn't a sign of rations in  sight, and it looked as if we would have to stay hungry. But Teddy  Roosevelt just put his hand into his own pocket and bought us about all  we wanted. Then he scurried around and found out where we were to go,  and in another twenty-four hours we were settled in camp.\" Even in camp  the Rough Riders had to put up with continued discomfort. The weather  was warm, flies and mosquitoes were numerous, and the drinking water was  not of the best. The rations were plain, but the Rough Riders did not  mind this, for many of them had often fared worse on the plains.    Although it was now a regular military camp that the Rough Riders were  in, it was rather difficult to control some of the men, especially  those who had been used to an unusually rough life. But they were held  in check as much as possible by their commanders, and on Sunday all  attended a church service held by Chaplain Brown, who spoke to them in a  manner that soon claimed their attention.    After but a few days spent in the camp at Tampa, within walking distance  of many of the fashionable hotels, the command was ordered to Port  Tampa, there to board a transport to sail for some destination not  revealed. But the soldiers knew they were going to Cuba, to fight the  Spaniards and to aid in freeing Cuba, and again there was a loud  hurrahing.    But immediately on top of this came one of the hardest blows the Rough  Riders had to endure, and one which some of them will probably never  forget.    As already stated, volunteers from all over our nation were anxious to  get into the fight, and it was no easy matter for the authorities at  Washington to decide who should go and who should be left behind.    \"Only eight troops of seventy men each of the Rough Riders will embark  on the transport,\" was the order sent to Colonel Wood. More than this,  it was ordered that the command should be on board of the transport by  the following morning, otherwise it could not go.    \"Four troops to be left behind!\" exclaimed Theodore Roosevelt.    \"Too bad,\" returned Colonel Wood. \"Every man expects to go, and wants to  go.\"    It was a hard task to tell some of the men that they could not go. Mr.  Roosevelt tells us that many of them actually cried at the news. They  were willing to go under any conditions. They did not want any pay, they  did not want any pensions if they were disabled, and some, who had  money, even offered to pay their way, just for the privilege of fighting  for Uncle Sam. After such an exhibition, let nobody dare to say that  true patriotism is dying out in this country.    But orders were orders, and as quickly as possible those to go were  selected. Then the command marched to the railroad tracks to await the  cars. None came, and they were given orders to march to another track.  This they also did; but still no train appeared.    \"We'll be left, that is certain,\" said Colonel Wood, anxiously.    \"It certainly looks like it, unless we march the boys down to the port.\"    \"Here comes a train!\" was the cry.    It was a train, but only of empty coal cars. It was about to pass by  when the Rough Riders halted it.    \"What's the matter with riding down to the port in the coal cars?\" was  the question asked by several.    \"Good enough!\" came the answer. \"Into the cars, boys, and don't waste  time!\" And into the dirty coal cars they piled, and persuaded the  engineer of the train to take them down to Port Tampa as quickly as he  could.    If there had been bustle and confusion up at Tampa, it was far worse at  the port. Everybody was in a hurry, and ten thousand soldiers stood  around, not knowing what to do with their baggage, and not knowing which  of the many transports to board.    At last the Rough Riders were told to go aboard the _Yucatan_, and  started to do so.    \"The _Yucatan_?\" exclaimed a member of another command. \"That is our  transport.\"    \"No, she has been allotted to us,\" put in an officer belonging to still  another command.    \"How many men will she hold?\" questioned a captain of the Rough Riders.    \"About a thousand.\"    \"Then she can't take the three commands.\"    Theodore Roosevelt overheard this talk, and at once made up his mind  that it would be a question of what command got aboard of the transport  first. Without the loss of a moment he ran back to where his men were in  waiting.    \"Double-quick to the dock!\" was his order. And forming quickly, the  troops made their way to the wharf with all possible speed. In the  meantime, Colonel Wood had gone out to the transport in a steam-launch  and gotten the vessel to come up to the wharf. On board went the Rough  Riders pell-mell, and not a minute too soon.    \"This is our boat!\" cried an officer, as he came up with his command a  minute later.    \"Sorry for you, sir, but it is our boat,\" was Colonel Wood's firm  answer.    Then the third command loomed up, and a three-handed dispute arose. But  the Rough Riders remained aboard of the transport, taking four companies  of another command in with them.    I have told of the particulars of this affair to show my young readers  what was needed at this time, and how well Theodore Roosevelt performed  his duties. He had been a soldier and officer only a few weeks, yet he  realized that army life on paper and army life in reality were two  different things. He felt that an officer must do much besides leading  his men in the field: that he must look after them constantly, see that  their health was provided for, see that they got their rations, see that  transportation was ready when needed, and even see to it that some were  kept away from the temptations of drink, and that they did not quarrel  among themselves.    When going on board of the transport, the Rough Riders were supplied  with twelve days' rations each. The most of the food was good, but the  canned beef was very bad, just as it was found to be very bad in many  other quarters, and it made a great number sick. Added to this, somebody  had forgotten to issue salt to the soldiers; so much had to be eaten  without this very necessary seasoning.    \"But we took matters good-naturedly,\" said one of the number, in  speaking of the trip that followed. \"Many of the boys were out for a  lark, and when they growled, they did it good-naturedly. We had all  sorts of men, and all sorts of nicknames. An Irishman was called Solomon  Levi, and a nice young Jew Old Pork Chop. One fellow who was  particularly slow was called Speedy William, and another who always  spoke in a quick, jerky voice answered to the hail of 'Slow-up Peter.'  One cowboy who was as rough as anybody in the command was christened The  Parson, and a fine, high-toned, well-educated college boy had to answer  to the name of Jimmy the Tramp. Some of the boys could sing, and they  organized the Rough Rider Quartette; and others could play, and they  gave us music on the mouth harmonicas and other instruments they had  managed to smuggle along.\"    The War Department had expected to send the troops to Cuba without  delay, but now came in a report"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22373"],[0,"Russian Fairy Tales: A Choice Collection of Muscovite Folk-lore (#15)"],[1,"night. That was a Snake's doing. Well, Ivan    undertook to kill that Snake, so he said to his father, \"Father,    make me a mace five poods in weight.\" And when he had got    the mace, he went out into the fields, and flung it straight up in    the air, and then he went home. The next day he went out into    the fields to the spot from which he had flung the mace on high,    and stood there with his head thrown back. So when the mace    fell down again it hit him on the forehead. And the mace    broke in two.      Ivan went home and said to his father, \"Father, make me    another mace, a ten pood one.\" And when he had got it he    went out into the fields, and flung it aloft. And the mace went    flying through the air for three days and three nights. On the    fourth day Ivan went out to the same spot, and when the mace    came tumbling down, he put his knee in the way, and the mace    broke over it into three pieces.      Ivan went home and told his father to make him a third    mace, one of fifteen poods weight. And when he had got it, he    went out into the fields and flung it aloft. And the mace was    up in the air six days. On the seventh Ivan went to the same    spot as before. Down fell the mace, and when it struck Ivan's    forehead, the forehead bowed under it. Thereupon he said,    \"This mace will do for the Snake!\"      So when he had got everything ready, he went forth with    his brothers to fight the Snake. He rode and rode, and presently    there stood before him a hut on fowl's legs,[76] and in that    hut lived the Snake. There all the party came to a standstill.    Then Ivan hung up his gloves, and said to his brothers, \"Should    blood drop from my gloves, make haste to help me.\" When he    had said this he went into the hut and sat down under the    boarding.[77]      Presently there rode up a Snake with three heads. His    steed stumbled, his hound howled, his falcon clamored.[78] Then    cried the Snake:      \"Wherefore hast thou stumbled, O Steed! hast thou howled,    O Hound! hast thou clamored, O Falcon?\"      \"How can I but stumble,\" replied the Steed, \"when under    the boarding sits Ivan Popyalof?\"      Then said the Snake, \"Come forth, Ivanushka! Let us    try our strength together.\" Ivan came forth, and they began to    fight. And Ivan killed the Snake, and then sat down again    beneath the boarding.      Presently there came another Snake, a six-headed one, and    him, too, Ivan killed. And then there came a third, which had    twelve heads. Well, Ivan began to fight with him, and lopped    off nine of his heads. The Snake had no strength left in him.    Just then a raven came flying by, and it croaked:      \"Krof? Krof!\"[79]      Then the Snake cried to the Raven, \"Fly, and tell my wife    to come and devour Ivan Popyalof.\"      But Ivan cried: \"Fly, and tell my brothers to come, and    then we will kill this Snake, and give his flesh to thee.\"      And the Raven gave ear to what Ivan said, and flew to his    brothers and began to croak above their heads. The brothers    awoke, and when they heard the cry of the Raven, they hastened    to their brother's aid. And they killed the Snake, and then,    having taken his heads, they went into his hut and destroyed    them. And immediately there was bright light throughout the    whole land.      After killing the Snake, Ivan Popyalof and his brothers set    off on their way home. But he had forgotten to take away his    gloves, so he went back to fetch them, telling his brothers to    wait for him meanwhile. Now when he had reached the hut    and was going to take away his gloves, he heard the voices of    the Snake's wife and daughters, who were talking with each    other. So he turned himself into a cat, and began to mew    outside the door. They let him in, and he listened to everything    they said. Then he got his gloves and hastened away.      As soon as he came to where his brothers were, he mounted    his horse, and they all started afresh. They rode and rode;    presently they saw before them a green meadow, and on that    meadow lay silken cushions. Then the elder brothers said,    \"Let's turn out our horses to graze here, while we rest ourselves    a little.\"      But Ivan said, \"Wait a minute, brothers!\" and he seized    his mace, and struck the cushions with it. And out of those    cushions there streamed blood.      So they all went on further. They rode and rode; presently    there stood before them an apple-tree, and upon it were gold    and silver apples. Then the elder brothers said, \"Let's eat an    apple apiece.\" But Ivan said, \"Wait a minute, brothers; I'll    try them first,\" and he took his mace, and struck the apple-tree    with it. And out of the tree streamed blood.      So they went on further. They rode and rode, and by and    by they saw a spring in front of them. And the elder brothers    cried, \"Let's have a drink of water.\" But Ivan Popyalof    cried: \"Stop, brothers!\" and he raised his mace and struck    the spring, and its waters became blood.      For the meadow, the silken cushions, the apple-tree, and the    spring, were all of them daughters of the Snake.      After killing the Snake's daughters, Ivan and his brothers    went on homewards. Presently came the Snake's Wife flying    after them, and she opened her jaws from the sky to the earth,    and tried to swallow up Ivan. But Ivan and his brothers threw    three poods of salt into her mouth. She swallowed the salt,    thinking it was Ivan Popyalof, but afterwards--when she had    tasted the salt, and found out it was not Ivan--she flew after    him again.      Then he perceived that danger was at hand, and so he let    his horse go free, and hid himself behind twelve doors in the    forge of Kuzma and Demian. The Snake's Wife came flying    up, and said to Kuzma and Demian, \"Give me up Ivan Popyalof.\"    But they replied:      \"Send your tongue through the twelve doors and take him.\"    So the Snake's Wife began licking the doors. But meanwhile    they all heated iron pincers, and as soon as she had sent her    tongue through into the smithy, they caught tight hold of her    by the tongue, and began thumping her with hammers. And    when the Snake's Wife was dead they consumed her with fire,    and scattered her ashes to the winds. And then they went    home, and there they lived and enjoyed themselves, feasting    and revelling, and drinking mead and wine.      I was there, too, and had liquor to drink; it didn't go into    my mouth, but only ran down my beard.[80]    The skazka of Ivan Buikovich (Bull's son)[81] contains a variant of  part of this story, but the dragon which the Slavonic St. George kills  is called, not a snake, but a Chudo-Yudo.[82] Ivan watches one night  while his brothers sleep. Presently up rides \"a six-headed Chudo-Yudo\"  which he easily kills. The next night he slays, but with more  difficulty, a nine-headed specimen of the same family. On the third  night appears \"a twelve-headed Chudo-Yudo,\" mounted on a horse \"with  twelve wings, its coat of silver, its mane and tail of gold.\" Ivan  lops off three of the monster's heads, but they, like those of the  Lernaean Hydra, become re-attached to their necks at the touch of their  owner's \"fiery finger.\" Ivan, whom his foe has driven into the ground  up to his knees, hurls one of his gloves at the hut in which his  brothers are sleeping. It smashes the windows, but the sleepers  slumber on and take no heed. Presently Ivan smites off six of his  antagonist's heads, but they grow again as before.[83] Half buried in  the ground by the monster's strength, Ivan hurls his other glove at  the hut, piercing its roof this time. But still his brothers slumber  on. At last, after fruitlessly shearing off nine of the Chudo-Yudo's  heads, and finding himself embedded in the ground up to his armpits,  Ivan flings his cap at the hut. The hut reels under the blow and its  beams fall asunder; his brothers awake, and hasten to his aid, and the  Chudo-Yudo is destroyed. The \"Chudo-Yudo wives\" as the widows of the  three monsters are called, then proceed to play the parts attributed  in \"Ivan Popyalof\" to the Snake's daughters.    \"I will become an apple-tree with golden and silver apples,\" says the  first; \"whoever plucks an apple will immediately burst.\" Says the  second, \"I will become a spring--on the water will float two cups, the  one golden, the other of silver; whoever touches one of the cups, him  will I drown.\" And the third says, \"I will become a golden bed;  whoever lies down upon that bed will be consumed with fire.\" Ivan, in  a sparrow's form, overhears all this, and acts as in the preceding  story. The three widows die, but their mother, \"an old witch,\"  determines on revenge. Under the form of a beggar-woman she asks alms  from the retreating brothers. Ivan tenders her a ducat. She seizes,  not the ducat, but his outstretched hand, and in a moment whisks him  off underground to her husband, an Aged One, whose appearance is that  of the mythical being whom the Servians call the Vy. He \"lies on an  iron couch, and sees nothing; his long eyelashes and thick eyebrows  completely hide his eyes,\" but he sends for \"twelve mighty heroes,\"  and orders them to take iron forks and lift up the hair about his  eyes, and then he gazes at the destroyer of his family. The glance of  the Servian Vy is supposed to be as deadly as that of a basilisk, but  the patriarch of the Russian story does not injure his captive. He  merely sends him on an errand which leads to a fresh set of  adventures, of which we need not now take notice.    In a third variant of the story,[84] they are snakes which are killed  by the hero, Ivan Koshkin (Cat's son), and it is a Baba Yaga, or Hag,  who undertakes to revenge their deaths and those of their wives, her  daughters. Accordingly she pursues the three brothers, and succeeds in  swallowing two of them. The third, Ivan Koshkin, takes refuge in a  smithy,"]]]
