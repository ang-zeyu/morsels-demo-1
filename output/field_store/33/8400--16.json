His arms were folded on the  sill and his straw hat was pushed back from his flushed, eager face as  he watched Nan's deft movements.    Beyond them, old Abe Stewart was mowing the grass in the orchard with  a scythe and casting uneasy glances at the pair. Old Abe did not  approve of John Osborne as a suitor for Nan. John was poor; and old  Abe, although he was the wealthiest farmer in Granville, was bent on  Nan's making a good match. He looked upon John Osborne as a mere  fortune-hunter, and it was a thorn in the flesh to see him talking to  Nan while he, old Abe, was too far away to hear what they were saying.  He had a good deal of confidence in Nan, she was a sensible,  level-headed girl. Still, there was no knowing what freak even a  sensible girl might take into her head, and Nan was so determined when  she did make up her mind. She was his own daughter in that.    However, old Abe need not have worried himself. It could not be said  that Nan was helping John Osborne on in his wooing at all. Instead,  she was teasing and snubbing him by turns.    Nan was very pretty. Moreover, Nan was well aware of the fact. She  knew that the way her dark hair curled around her ears and forehead  was bewitching; that her complexion was the envy of every girl in  Granville; that her long lashes had a trick of drooping over very  soft, dark eyes in a fashion calculated to turn masculine heads  hopelessly. John Osborne knew all this too, to his cost. He had called  to ask Nan to go with him to the Lone Lake picnic the next day. At  this request Nan dropped her eyes and murmured that she was sorry, but  he was too late--she had promised to go with somebody else. There was  no need of Nan's making such a mystery about it. The somebody else was  her only cousin, Ned Bennett, who had had a quarrel with his own girl;  the latter lived at Lone Lake, and Ned had coaxed Nan to go over with  him and try her hand at patching matters up between him and his  offended lady-love. And Nan, who was an amiable creature and  tender-hearted where anybody's lover except her own was concerned, had  agreed to go.    But John Osborne at once jumped to the conclusion--as Nan had very  possibly meant him to do--that the mysterious somebody was Bryan Lee,  and the thought was gall and wormwood to him.    \"Whom are you going with?\" he asked.    \"That would be telling,\" Nan said, with maddening indifference.    \"Is it Bryan Lee?\" demanded John.    \"It might be,\" said Nan reflectively, \"and then again, you know, it  mightn't.\"    John was silent; he was no match for Nan when it came to a war of  words. He scowled moodily at the shining tumblers.    \"Nan, I'm going out west,\" he said finally.    Nan stared at him with her last tumbler poised in mid-air, very much  as if he had announced his intention of going to the North Pole or  Equatorial Africa.    \"John Osborne, are you crazy?\"    \"Not quite. And I'm in earnest, I can tell you that.\"    Nan set the glass down with a decided thud. John's curtness displeased  her. He needn't suppose that it made any difference to her if he took  it into his stupid head to go to Afghanistan.    \"Oh!\" she remarked carelessly. \"Well, I suppose if you've got the  Western fever your case is hopeless. Would it be impertinent to  inquire why you are going?\"    \"There's nothing else for me to do, Nan,\" said John, \"Bryan Lee is  going to foreclose the mortgage next month and I'll have to clear out.  He says he can't wait any longer. I've worked hard enough and done my  best to keep the old place, but it's been uphill work and I'm beaten  at last.\"    Nan sat blankly down on the stool by the window. Her face was a study  which John Osborne, watching old Abe's movements, missed.    \"Well, I never!\" she gasped. \"John Osborne, do you mean to tell me  that Bryan Lee is going to do that? How did he come to get your  mortgage?\"    \"Bought it from old Townsend,\" answered John briefly. \"Oh, he's within  his rights, I'll admit. I've even got behind with the interest this  past year. I'll go out west and begin over again.\"    \"It's a burning shame!\" said Nan violently.    John looked around in time to see two very red spots on her cheeks.    \"You don't care though, Nan.\"    \"I don't like to see anyone unjustly treated,\" declared Nan, \"and that  is what you've been. You've never had half a chance. And after the way  you've slaved, too!\"    \"If Lee would wait a little I might do something yet, now that Aunt  Alice is gone,\" said John bitterly. \"I'm not afraid of work. But he  won't; he means to take his spite out at last.\"    Nan hesitated.    \"Surely Bryan isn't so mean as that,\" she stammered. \"Perhaps he'll  change his mind if--if--\"    Osborne wheeled about with face aflame.    \"Don't you say a word to him about it, Nan!\" he cried. \"Don't you go  interceding with him for me. I've got some pride left. He can take the  farm from me, and he can take you maybe, but he can't take my  self-respect. I won't beg him for mercy. Don't you dare to say a word  to him about it.\"    Nan's eyes flashed. She was offended to find her sympathy flung back  in her face.    \"Don't be alarmed,\" she said tartly. \"I shan't bother myself about  your concerns. I've no doubt you're able to look out for them  yourself.\"    Osborne turned away. As he did so he saw Bryan Lee driving up the  lane. Perhaps Nan saw it too. At any rate, she leaned out of the  window.    \"John! John!\" Osborne half turned. \"You'll be up again soon, won't  you?\"    His face hardened. \"I'll come to say goodbye before I go, of course,\"  he answered shortly.    He came face to face with Lee at the gate, where the latter was tying  his sleek chestnut to a poplar. He acknowledged his rival's  condescending nod with a scowl. Lee looked after him with a satisfied  smile.    \"Poor beggar!\" he muttered. \"He feels pretty cheap I reckon. I've  spoiled his chances in this quarter. Old Abe doesn't want any  poverty-stricken hangers-on about his place and Nan won't dream of  taking him when she knows he hasn't a roof over his head.\"    He stopped for a chat with old Abe. Old Abe approved of Bryan Lee. He  was a son-in-law after old Abe's heart.    Meanwhile, Nan had seated herself at the pantry window and was  ostentatiously hemming towels in apparent oblivion of suitor No. 2.  Nevertheless, when Bryan came up she greeted him with an unusually  sweet smile and at once plunged into an animated conversation. Bryan  had not come to ask her to go to the picnic--business prevented him  from going. But he meant to find out if she were going with John  Osborne. As Nan was serenely impervious to all hints, he was finally  forced to ask her bluntly if she was going to the picnic.    Well, yes, she expected to.    Oh! Might he ask with whom?    Nan didn't know that it was a question of public interest at all.    \"It isn't with that Osborne fellow, is it?\" demanded Bryan  incautiously.    Nan tossed her head. \"Well, why not?\" she asked.    \"Look here, Nan,\" said Lee angrily, \"if you're going to the picnic  with John Osborne I'm surprised at you. What do you mean by  encouraging him so? He's as poor as Job's turkey. I suppose you've  heard that I've been compelled to foreclose the mortgage on his farm.\"    Nan kept her temper sweetly--a dangerous sign, had Bryan but known it.    \"Yes; he was telling me so this morning,\" she answered slowly.    \"Oh, was he? I suppose he gave me my character?\"    \"No; he didn't say very much about it at all. He said of course you  were within your rights. But do you really mean to do it, Bryan?\"    \"Of course I do,\" said Bryan promptly. \"I can't wait any longer for my  money, and I'd never get it if I did. Osborne can't even pay the  interest.\"    \"It isn't because he hasn't worked hard enough, then,\" said Nan. \"He  has just slaved on that place ever since he grew up.\"    \"Well, yes, he has worked hard in a way. But he's kind of shiftless,  for all that--no manager, as you might say. Some folks would have been  clear by now, but Osborne is one of those men that are bound to get  behind. He hasn't got any business faculty.\"    \"He isn't shiftless,\" said Nan quickly, \"and it isn't his fault if he  has got behind. It's all because of his care for his aunt. He has had  to spend more on her doctor's bills than would have raised the  mortgage. And now that she is dead and he might have a chance to pull  up, you go and foreclose.\"    \"A man must look out for Number One,\" said Bryan easily, admiring  Nan's downcast eyes and rosy cheeks. \"I haven't any spite against  Osborne, but business is business, you know.\"    Nan opened her lips to say something but, remembering Osborne's  parting injunction, she shut them again. She shot a scornful glance at  Lee as he stood with his arms folded on the sill beside her.    Bryan lingered, talking small talk, until Nan announced that she must  see about getting tea.    \"And you won't tell me who is going to take you to the picnic?\" he  coaxed.    \"Oh, it's Ned Bennett,\" said Nan indifferently.    Bryan felt relieved. He unpinned the huge cluster of violets on his  coat and laid them down on the sill beside her before he went. Nan  flicked them off with her fingers as she watched him cross the lawn,  his own self-satisfied smile upon his face.           *       *       *       *       *    A week later the Osborne homestead had passed into Bryan Lee's hands  and John Osborne was staying with his cousin at Thornhope, pending his  departure for the west. He had never been to see Nan since that last  afternoon, but Bryan Lee haunted the Stewart place. One day he  suddenly stopped coming and, although Nan was discreetly silent, in  due time it came to old Abe's ears by various driblets of gossip that  Nan had refused him.    Old Abe marched straightway home to Nan in a fury and demanded if this  were true. Nan curtly admitted that it was.

Next day Mrs. Page and Leicester went to town on business. In the  afternoon Dorinda put on her best dress and hat and started out.  Admiral Page's fighting blood was glowing in her cheeks as she walked  briskly up the hill road, but her heart beat in an odd fashion.    \"I wonder if I am a little scared, 'way down deep,\" said Dorinda. \"I  believe I am. But I'm going to do it for all that, and the scareder I  get the more I'll do it.\"    Oaklawn, where Uncle Eugene lived, was two miles away. It was a fine  old place in beautiful grounds. But Dorinda did not quail before its  splendours; nor did her heart fail her, even after she had rung the  bell and had been shown by a maid into a very handsome parlour, but it  still continued to beat in that queer fashion halfway up her throat.    Presently Uncle Eugene came in, a tall, black-eyed old man, with a  fine head of silver hair that should have framed a ruddy, benevolent  face, instead of Uncle Eugene's hard-lipped, bushy-browed  countenance.    Dorinda stood up, dusky and crimson, with brave, glowing eyes. Uncle  Eugene looked at her sharply.    \"Who are you?\" he said bluntly.    \"I am your niece, Dorinda Page,\" said Dorinda steadily.    \"And what does my niece, Dorinda Page, want with me?\" demanded Uncle  Eugene, motioning to her to sit down and sitting down himself. But  Dorinda remained standing. It is easier to fight on your feet.    \"I want you to do four things, Uncle Eugene,\" she said, as calmly as  if she were making the most natural and ordinary request in the world.  \"I want you to lend us the money to send Leicester to Blue Hill  Academy; he will pay it back to you when he gets through college. I  want you to lend Jean the money for music lessons; she will pay you  back when she gets far enough along to give lessons herself. And I  want you to lend me the money to shingle our house and get Mother a  new dress and fur coat for the winter. I'll pay you back sometime for  that, because I am going to set up as a dressmaker pretty soon.\"    \"Anything more?\" said Uncle Eugene, when Dorinda stopped.    \"Nothing more just now, I think,\" said Dorinda reflectively.    \"Why don't you ask for something for yourself?\" said Uncle Eugene.    \"I don't want anything for myself,\" said Dorinda promptly. \"Or--yes, I  do, too. I want your friendship, Uncle Eugene.\"    \"Be kind enough to sit down,\" said Uncle Eugene.    Dorinda sat.    \"You are a Page,\" said Uncle Eugene. \"I saw that as soon as I came in.  I will send Leicester to college and I shall not ask or expect to be  paid back. Jean shall have her music lessons, and a piano to practise  them on as well. The house shall be shingled, and the money for the  new dress and coat shall be forthcoming. You and I will be friends.\"    \"Thank you,\" gasped Dorinda, wondering if, after all, it wasn't a  dream.    \"I would have gladly assisted your mother before,\" said Uncle Eugene,  \"if she had asked me. I had determined that she must ask me first. I  knew that half the money should have been your father's by rights. I  was prepared to hand it over to him or his family, if I were asked for  it. But I wished to humble his pride, and the Carter pride, to the  point of asking for it. Not a very amiable temper, you will say? I  admit it. I am not amiable and I never have been amiable. You must be  prepared to find me very unamiable. I see that you are waiting for a  chance to say something polite and pleasant on that score, but you may  save yourself the trouble. I shall hope and expect to have you visit  me often. If your mother and your brothers and sisters see fit to come  with you, I shall welcome them also. I think that this is all it is  necessary to say just now. Will you stay to tea with me this evening?\"    Dorinda stayed to tea, since she knew that Jean was at home to attend  to matters there. She and Uncle Eugene got on famously. When she left,  Uncle Eugene, grim and hard-lipped as ever, saw her to the door.    \"Good evening, Niece Dorinda. You are a Page and I am proud of you.  Tell your mother that many things in this life are lost through not  asking for them. I don't think you are in need of the information for  yourself.\"          Her Own People      The Taunton School had closed for the summer holidays. Constance  Foster and Miss Channing went down the long, elm-shaded street  together, as they generally did, because they happened to board on the  same block downtown.    Constance was the youngest teacher on the staff, and had charge of the  Primary Department. She had taught in Taunton school a year, and at  its close she was as much of a stranger in the little corps of  teachers as she had been at the beginning. The others thought her  stiff and unapproachable; she was unpopular in a negative way with all  except Miss Channing, who made it a profession to like everybody, the  more so if other people disliked them. Miss Channing was the oldest  teacher on the staff, and taught the fifth grade. She was short and  stout and jolly; nothing, not even the iciest reserve, ever daunted  Miss Channing.    \"Isn't it good to think of two whole blessed months of freedom?\" she  said jubilantly. \"Two months to dream, to be lazy, to go where one  pleases, no exercises to correct, no reports to make, no pupils to  keep in order. To be sure, I love them every one, but I'll love them  all the more for a bit of a rest from them. Isn't it good?\"    A little satirical smile crossed Constance Foster's dark, discontented  face, looking just then all the more discontented in contrast to Miss  Channing's rosy, beaming countenance.    \"It's very good, if you have anywhere to go, or anybody who cares  where you go,\" she said bitterly. \"For my own part, I'm sorry school  is closed. I'd rather go on teaching all summer.\"    \"Heresy!\" said Miss Channing. \"Rank heresy! What are your vacation  plans?\"    \"I haven't any,\" said Constance wearily. \"I've put off thinking about  vacation as long as I possibly could. You'll call that heresy, too,  Miss Channing.\"    \"It's worse than heresy,\" said Miss Channing briskly. \"It's a crying  necessity for blue pills, that's what it is. Your whole mental and  moral and physical and spiritual system must be out of kilter, my  child. No vacation plans! You _must_ have vacation plans. You must be  going _somewhere_.\"    \"Oh, I suppose I'll hunt up a boarding place somewhere in the country,  and go there and mope until September.\"    \"Have you no friends, Constance?\"    \"No--no, I haven't anybody in the world. That is why I hate vacation,  that is why I've hated to hear you and the others discussing your  vacation plans. You all have somebody to go to. It has just filled me  up with hatred of my life.\"    Miss Channing swallowed her honest horror at such a state of feeling.    \"Constance, tell me about yourself. I've often wanted to ask you, but  I was always a little afraid to. You seem so reserved and--and, as if  you didn't want to be asked about yourself.\"    \"I know it. I know I'm stiff and hateful, and that nobody likes me,  and that it is all my own fault. No, never mind trying to smooth it  over, Miss Channing. It's the truth, and it hurts me, but I can't help  it. I'm getting more bitter and pessimistic and unwholesome every day  of my life. Sometimes it seems as if I hated all the world because I'm  so lonely in it. I'm nobody. My mother died when I was born--and  Father--oh, I don't know. One can't say anything against one's father,  Miss Channing. But I had a hard childhood--or rather, I didn't have  any childhood at all. We were always moving about. We didn't seem to  have any friends at all. My mother might have had relatives  somewhere, but I never heard of any. I don't even know where her home  was. Father never would talk of her. He died two years ago, and since  then I've been absolutely alone.\"    \"Oh, you poor girl,\" said Miss Channing softly.    \"I want friends,\" went on Constance, seeming to take a pleasure in  open confession now that her tongue was loosed. \"I've always just  longed for somebody belonging to me to love. I don't love anybody,  Miss Channing, and when a girl is in that state, she is all wrong. She  gets hard and bitter and resentful--I have, anyway. I struggled  against it at first, but it has been too much for me. It poisons  everything. There is nobody to care anything about me, whether I live  or die.\"    \"Oh, yes, there is One,\" said Miss Channing gently. \"God cares,  Constance.\"    Constance gave a disagreeable little laugh.    \"That sounds like Miss Williams--she is so religious. God doesn't mean  anything to me, Miss Channing. I've just the same resentful feeling  toward him that I have for all the world, if he exists at all. There,  I've shocked you in good earnest now. You should have left me alone,  Miss Channing.\"    \"God means nothing to you because you've never had him translated to  you through human love, Constance,\" said Miss Channing seriously. \"No,  you haven't shocked me--at least, not in the way you mean. I'm only  terribly sorry.\"    \"Oh, never mind me,\" said Constance, freezing up into her reserve  again as if she regretted her confidences. \"I'll get along all right.  This is one of my off days, when everything looks black.\"    Miss Channing walked on in silence. She must help Constance, but  Constance was not easily helped. When school reopened, she might be  able to do something worthwhile for the girl, but just now the only  thing to do was to put her in the way of a pleasant vacation.    \"You spoke of boarding,\" she said, when Constance paused at the door  of her boarding-house. \"Have you any particular place in view? No?  Well, I know a place which I am sure you would like. I was there two  summers ago. It "]]]
