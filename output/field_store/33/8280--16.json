According to their methods of manufacture, soaps may, however, be more  conveniently classified, thus:--    (A) Direct combination of fatty acids with alkali.    (B) Treatment of fat with definite amount of alkali and no separation of  waste lye.    (C) Treatment of fat with indefinite amount of alkali and no separation  of waste lye.    (D) Treatment of fat with indefinite amount of alkali and separation of  waste lye.    (A) _Direct Combination of Fatty Acids with Alkali._--This method  consists in the complete saturation of fatty acids with alkali, and  permits of the use of the deglycerised products mentioned in chapter  ii., section 2, and of carbonated alkalies or caustic soda or potash.  Fatty acids are readily saponified with caustic soda or caustic potash  of all strengths.    The saponification by means of carbonated alkali may be performed in an  open vat containing a steam coil, or in a pan provided with a removable  agitator.    It is usual to take soda ash (58 deg.), amounting to 19 per cent. of the  weight of fatty acids to be saponified, and dissolve it in water by the  aid of steam until the density of the solution is 53 deg. Tw. (30 deg. B.); then  bring to the boil, and, whilst boiling, add the molten fatty acids  slowly, but not continuously.    Combination takes place immediately with evolution of carbonic acid gas,  which causes the contents of the vat or pan to swell, and frequently to  boil over. The use of the agitator, or the cessation of the flow of  fatty acids, will sometimes tend to prevent the boiling over. It is  imperative that the steam should not be checked but boiling continued  as vigorously as possible until all the alkali has been absorbed and the  gas driven off.    The use of air to replace steam in expelling the carbonic acid gas has  been patented (Fr. Pat. 333,974, 1903).    A better method of procedure, however, is to commence with a solution of  64 deg. Tw. (35 deg. B.) density, made from half the requisite soda ash (9-1/2  per cent.), and when this amount of alkali has all been taken up by the  fatty acids (which have been added gradually and with continuous  boiling), the remaining quantity of soda ash is added in a dry state,  being sprinkled over each further addition of fatty acid.    This allows the process to be more easily controlled and boiling over is  avoided.    It is essential that the boiling by steam should be well maintained  throughout the process until all carbonic acid gas has been thoroughly  expelled; when that point is reached, the steam may be lessened and the  contents of the vat or pan gently boiled \"on strength\" with a little  caustic lye until it ceases to absorb caustic alkali, the soap being  finished in the manner described under (D).    It is extremely difficult to prevent discoloration of fatty acids, hence  the products of saponification in this way do not compare favourably in  appearance with those produced from the original neutral oil or fat.    (B) _Treatment of Fat with Definite Amount of Alkali and no Separation  of Waste Lye._--Cold-process soap is a type of this class, and its  method of production is based upon the characteristic property which the  glycerides of the lower fatty acids (members of the cocoa-nut-oil class)  possess of readily combining with a strong caustic soda solution at a  low temperature, and evolving sufficient heat to complete the  saponification.    Sometimes tallow, lard, cotton-seed oil, palm oil and even castor oil  are used in admixture with cocoa-nut oil. The process for such soap is  the same as when cocoa-nut oil is employed alone, with the slight  alteration in temperature necessary to render the fats liquid, and the  amount of caustic lye required will be less. Soaps made of these blends  closely resemble, in appearance, milled toilet soaps. In such mixtures  the glycerides of the lower fatty acids commence the saponification, and  by means of the heat generated induce the other materials, which alone  would saponify with difficulty or only with the application of heat, to  follow suit.    It is necessary to use high grade materials; the oils and fats should be  free from excess of acidity, to which many of the defects of  cold-process soaps may be traced. Owing to the rapidity with which free  acidity is neutralised by caustic soda, granules of soap are formed,  which in the presence of strong caustic lye are \"grained out\" and  difficult to remove without increasing the heat; the soap will thus tend  to become thick and gritty and sometimes discoloured.    The caustic lye should be made from the purest caustic soda, containing  as little carbonate as possible; the water used for dissolving or  diluting the caustic soda should be soft (_i.e._, free from calcium and  magnesium salts), and all the materials carefully freed from particles  of dirt and fibre by straining.    The temperature, which, of course, must vary with the season, should be  as low as is consistent with fluidity, and for cocoa-nut oil alone may  be 75 deg. F. (24 deg. C.), but in mixtures containing tallow 100 deg. to 120 deg. F.  (38 deg. to 49 deg. C.).    The process is generally carried out as follows:--    The fluid cocoa-nut oil is stirred in a suitable vessel with half its  weight of 71.4 deg. Tw. (38 deg. B.) caustic soda lye at the same temperature,  and, when thoroughly mixed, the pan is covered and allowed to rest. It  is imperative that the oils and fats and caustic lye should be  intimately incorporated or emulsified. The agitating may be done  mechanically, there being several machines specially constructed for the  purpose. In one of the latest designs the caustic lye is delivered  through a pipe which rotates with the stirring gear, and the whole is  driven by means of a motor.    The agitation being complete, chemical action takes place with the  generation of heat, and finally results in the saponification of the  fats.    At first the contents of the pan are thin, but in a few hours they  become a solid mass. As the process advances the edges of the soap  become more transparent, and when the transparency has extended to the  whole mass, the soap is ready, after perfuming, to be framed and  crutched.    The admixture of a little caustic potash with the caustic soda greatly  improves the appearance of the resultant product, which is smoother and  milder.    The glycerine liberated during the saponification is retained in the  soap.    Although it is possible, with care, to produce neutral soaps of good  appearance and firm touch by this method, cold-process soaps are very  liable to contain both free alkali and unsaponified fat, and have now  fallen considerably into disrepute.    _Saponification under Increased or Diminished Pressure._--Soaps made by  boiling fats and oils, under pressure and _in vacuo_, with the exact  quantity of caustic soda necessary for complete combination, belong also  to this class. Amongst the many attempts which have at various times  been made to shorten the process of soap-making may be mentioned  Haywood's Patent No. 759, 1901, and Jourdan's French Patent No. 339,154,  1903.    In the former, saponification is carried out in a steam-jacketed vacuum  chamber provided with an elaborate arrangement of stirrers; in the other  process fat is allowed to fall in a thin stream into the amount of lye  required for saponification, previously placed in the saponification  vessel, which is provided with stirring gear.    When the quantities have been added, steam is admitted and  saponification proceeds.    (C) _Treatment of Fat with Indefinite Amount of Alkali and no Separation  of Waste Lye._--_Soft soap_ is representative of this class. The  vegetable fluid oils (linseed, olive, cotton-seed, maize) are for the  most part used in making this soap, though occasionally bone fats and  tallow are employed. Rosin is sometimes added, the proportion ranging,  according to the grade of soap required, from 5 to 15 per cent. of the  fatty matter.    The Soft Soap Manufacturers' Convention of Holland stipulate that the  materials used in soft-soap making must not contain more than 5 per  cent. rosin; it is also interesting to note that a patent has been  granted (Eng. Pat. 17,278, 1900) for the manufacture of soft soap from  material containing 50 per cent. rosin.    Fish or marine animal oils--whale, seal, etc., once largely used as raw  material for soft soap, have been superseded by vegetable oils.    The materials must be varied according to the season; during hot  weather, more body with a less tendency to separate is given by the  introduction of oils and fats richer in stearine; these materials also  induce \"figging\".    The most important material, however, is the caustic potash lye which  should average 40 deg. Tw. (24 deg. B.), _i.e._, if a weak solution is used to  commence saponification, a stronger lye must be afterwards employed to  avoid excess of water in the soap, and these average 40"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21728"],[0,"The Dog Crusoe and his Master (#15)"],[1,"it by greasing his whole person carefully and smoothly over  with buffalo-fat, until he shone like a patent leather boot; then he  rubbed himself almost dry, leaving the skin sleek and glossy.  Having  proceeded thus far he took up a small mirror, a few inches in diameter,  which he or some other member of the tribe must have procured during one  of their few excursions to the trading forts of the Pale-faces, and  examined himself, as well as he could, in so limited a space.  Next, he  took a little vermilion from a small parcel and rubbed it over his face  until it presented the somewhat demoniac appearance of a fiery red.  He  also drew a broad red score along the crown of his head, which was  closely shaved, with the exception of the usual tuft or scalp-lock on  the top.  This scalp-lock stood bristling straight up a few inches, and  then curved over and hung down his back about two feet.  Immense care  and attention was bestowed on this lock.  He smoothed it, greased it,  and plaited it into the form of a pigtail.  Another application was here  made to the glass, and the result was evidently satisfactory, to judge  from the beaming smile that played on his features.  But, not content  with the general effect, he tried the effect of expression--frowned  portentously, scowled savagely, gaped hideously, and grinned horribly a  ghastly smile.    Then our dandy fitted into his ears, which were bored in several places,  sundry ornaments, such as rings, wampum, etcetera, and hung several  strings of beads round his neck.  Besides these he affixed one or two  ornaments to his arms, wrists, and ankles, and touched in a few effects  with vermilion on the shoulders and breast.  After this, and a few more  glances at the glass, he put on a pair of beautiful moccasins, which,  besides being richly wrought with beads, were soft as chamois leather,  and fitted his feet like gloves; a pair of leggings of scarlet cloth  were drawn on, attached to a waist-belt, and bound below the knee with  broad garters of variegated bead-work.    It was some time before this Adonis was quite satisfied with himself.  He re-touched the paint on his shoulders several times, and modified the  glare of that on his wide-mouthed, high-cheek-boned visage before he  could tear himself away; but at last he did so, and, throwing a large  piece of scarlet cloth over his shoulders, he thrust his looking-glass  under his belt, and proceeded to mount his palfrey, which was held in  readiness near to the tent door by one of his wives.  The horse was  really a fine animal, and seemed worthy of a more warlike master.  His  shoulders, too, were striped with red paint, and feathers were  intertwined with his mane and tail, while the bridle was decorated with  various jingling ornaments.    Vaulting upon his steed, with a large fan of wild goose and turkey  feathers in one hand, and a whip dangling at the wrist of the other,  this incomparable dandy sallied forth for a promenade--that being his  chief delight when there was no buffalo hunting to be done.  Other men  who were not dandies sharpened their knives, smoked, feasted, and mended  their spears and arrows at such seasons of leisure, or played at  athletic games.    \"Let's follow my buck,\" said Joe Blunt.    \"Oui.  Come 'long,\" replied Henri, striding after the rider at a pace  that almost compelled his comrades to run.    \"Hold on!\" cried Dick, laughing; \"we don't want to keep him company.  A  distant view is quite enough o' sich a chap as that.\"    \"Mais, you forgit, I cannot see far.\"    \"So much the better,\" remarked Joe; \"it's my opinion we've seen enough  o' him.  Ah! he's goin' to look on at the games.  Them's worth lookin'  at.\"    The games to which Joe referred were taking place on a green level plain  close to the creek, and a little above the waterfall before referred to.  Some of the Indians were horse-racing, some jumping, and others  wrestling; but the game which proved most attractive was throwing the  javelin, in which several of the young braves were engaged.    This game is played by two competitors, each armed with a dart, in an  arena about fifty yards long.  One of the players has a hoop of six  inches in diameter.  At a signal they start off on foot at full speed,  and on reaching the middle of the arena the Indian with the hoop rolls  it along before them, and each does his best to send a javelin through  the hoop before the other.  He who succeeds counts so many points--if  both miss, the nearest to the hoop is allowed to count, but not so much  as if he had \"ringed\" it.  The Indians are very fond of this game, and  will play at it under a broiling sun for hours together.  But a good  deal of the interest attaching to it is owing to the fact that they make  it a means of gambling.  Indians are inveterate gamblers, and will  sometimes go on until they lose horses, bows, blankets, robes, and, in  short, their whole personal property.  The consequences are, as might be  expected, that fierce and bloody quarrels sometimes arise in which life  is often lost.    \"Try your hand at that,\" said Henri to Dick.    \"By all means,\" cried Dick, handing his rifle to his friend, and  springing into the ring enthusiastically.    A general shout of applause greeted the Pale-face, who threw off his  coat and tightened his belt, while a young Indian presented him with a  dart.    \"Now, see that ye do us credit, lad,\" said Joe.    \"I'll try,\" answered Dick.    In a moment they were off.  The young Indian rolled away the hoop, and  Dick threw his dart with such vigour that it went deep into the ground,  but missed the hoop by a foot at least.  The young Indian's first dart  went through the centre.    \"Ha!\" exclaimed Joe Blunt to the Indians near him, \"the lad's not used  to that game, try him at a race.  Bring out your best brave--he whose  bound is like the hunted deer.\"    We need scarcely remind the reader that Joe spoke in the Indian  language, and that the above is a correct rendering of the sense of what  he said.    The name of Tarwicadia, or the little chief, immediately passed from lip  to lip, and in a few minutes an Indian, a little below the medium size,  bounded into the arena with an indiarubber-like elasticity that caused a  shade of anxiety to pass over Joe's face.    \"Ah, boy!\" he whispered, \"I'm afeared you'll find him a tough customer.\"    \"That's just what I want,\" replied Dick.  \"He's supple enough, but he  wants muscle in the thigh.  We'll make it a long heat.\"    \"Right, lad, yer right.\"    Joe now proceeded to arrange the conditions of the race with the chiefs  around him.  It was fixed that the distance to be run should be a mile,  so that the race would be one of two miles, out and back.  Moreover, the  competitors were to run without any clothes, except a belt and a small  piece of cloth round the loins.  This to the Indians was nothing, for  they seldom wore more in warm weather, but Dick would have preferred to  keep on part of his dress.  The laws of the course, however, would not  permit of this, so he stripped and stood forth, the beau-ideal of a  well-formed, agile man.  He was greatly superior in size to his  antagonist, and more muscular, the savage being slender and extremely  lithe and springy.    \"Hah!  I will run too,\" shouted Henri, bouncing forward with clumsy  energy, and throwing off his coat just as they were going to start.    The savages smiled at this unexpected burst and made no objection,  considering the thing in the light of a joke.    The signal was given, and away they went.  Oh! it would have done you  good to have seen the way in which Henri manoeuvred his limbs on this  celebrated occasion!  He went over the ground with huge elephantine  bounds, runs, and jumps.  He could not have been said to have one style  of running; he had a dozen styles, all of which came into play in the  course of half as many minutes.  The other two ran like the wind; yet,  although Henri _appeared_ to be going heavily over the ground, he kept  up with them to the turning point.  As for Dick, it became evident in  the first few minutes that he could outstrip his antagonist with ease,  and was hanging back a little all the time.  He shot ahead like an arrow  when they came about half-way back, and it was clear that the real  interest of the race was to lie in the competition between Henri and  Tarwicadia.    Before they were two-thirds of the way back, Dick walked in to the  winning point, and turned to watch the others.  Henri's wind was about  gone, for he exerted himself with such violence that he wasted half his  strength.  The Indian, on the contrary, was comparatively fresh, but he  was not so fleet as his antagonist, whose tremendous strides carried him  over the ground at an incredible pace.  On they came neck and neck, till  close on the score that marked the winning point.  Here the value of  enthusiasm came out strongly in the case of Henri.  He _felt_ that he  could not gain an inch on Tarwicadia to save his life; but, just as he  came up, he observed the anxious faces of his comrades and the  half-sneering countenances of the savages.  His heart thumped against  his ribs, every muscle thrilled with a gush of conflicting feelings, and  he _hurled_ himself over the score like a cannon shot, full six inches  ahead of the little chief!    But the thing did not by any means end here.  Tarwicadia pulled up the  instant he had passed.  Not so our Canadian.  Such a clumsy and colossal  frame was not to be checked in a moment.  The crowd of Indians opened up  to let him pass, but unfortunately a small tent that stood in the way  was not so obliging.  Into it he went, head-foremost, like a shell,  carried away the corner-post with his shoulder, and brought the whole  affair down about his own ears, and those of its inmates, among whom  were several children and two or three dogs.  It required some time to  extricate them all from the ruins, but when this was"]]]
