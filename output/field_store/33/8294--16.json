It  lends itself kindly to all sorts of relief, either high or low, in  almost any material. It is so recognizable, even in the rudest attempts  at imitation, that its popularity is well deserved.    The hop-vine shares some of these qualities, though much less strongly  marked in character.    _The Acanthus._--This leaf was first adapted for the purpose of ornament  by the workmen of classical Greece. The inspiration was one of the few  which they took directly from nature's models. It was also freely used  by medieval carvers, but with an insistence upon the flowing and  rounded character of its surface forms; and again by the Renaissance  artists, with a return to its classical character of fluted and formal  strength of line. The graceful drawing of its elaborately articulated  surface, and the extraordinary accentuation of its outline, provide an  endless source of suggestion. It has been adapted in all manners,  according to the fancy of the carver--sometimes long and drawn out, at  others wide and spreading. Altogether it has been more thoroughly  \"generalized\" than any other natural form.    _The Oak, with its Acorns_, appears in early medieval work, but without  much attempt to represent its form with anything like individual  character. In later work it has more justice done to its undoubted  merits as a decorative feature by a clearer recognition of its beauty in  clumps and masses. Fruit, other than the grape and a nondescript kind of  berry, was seldom represented by medieval craftsmen; it formed, however,  a marked feature in Renaissance ornament, where pomegranate, apple, fig,  and melon were in constant requisition.    _Flowers_ in general were very little used in early times, and then only  in a highly abstract form corresponding to that of the foliage. The rose  and lily were the two most frequently seen, but they seldom had more  individuality about them than was sufficient to make them recognizable.  During the Renaissance flowers were treated with much more regard to  their inherent beauties, and were represented with great skill and power  of imitation, although often carried beyond legitimate limits in this  direction. When dealt with as ornaments, rather than botanical details,  they form a rich source of suggestion to the carver, and offer a ready  means of contrast with masses of foliage. The rose and lily are such  conspicuous flowers that they should, in modern times, be used in a way  consistent with our demands for individual character and likeness. They  should be fairly well defined and easily recognizable. It is quite  possible to treat these flowers in a very realistic way, without  endangering their effect as decorative details: they have both such  distinguished forms in flower and foliage.    Flowers should be chosen for their _forms_; color should not be allowed  to deceive the eye in this respect, unless the color itself is  suggestive of lines and contours.    _Foliage_ should always be studied at its prime, never when it is dried  and contorted in its forms.    Here is a short list of subjects, including those I have mentioned, all  having a sufficiently pronounced character to make them valuable as  stock in trade. Many more might be named, but these are chosen as being  commonly familiar, and as being representative types of various forms.    _For their Leaves and Fruit._--The grapevine, hop-vine, globe artichoke,  tomato, apple, plum, pear, bramble, and strawberry.    _For Fruit and Vine-like Growths (leafage too massive and smooth to be  of much value without adaptation)._--The melon, vegetable-marrow,  pumpkins, and cucumber.    _For Leafage, Flowers, or Seed Vessels._--The acanthus, oak, thistles,  teazle, giant hemlock, cow-parsley, buttercup.    _Of Garden Flowers._--The rose, lily, larkspur, peony, poppies,  columbine, chrysanthemum, tulip, Christmas rose, Japanese anemone.    _For Close and Intricate Designs._--Periwinkle, winter aconite,  trefoils of various kinds.    Many valuable hints on this subject may be gleaned by a study of  Gerrard's Herbal, which is full of well-drawn illustrations, done in a  way which is very suggestive to the designer.    A careful study of the outline forms of leaves is a schooling in itself,  so much may be learned from it. It teaches the relation between form and  growth in a way which makes it possible to use the greatest freedom of  generalization without violating structural laws. The same causes which  govern the shaping of a tree are present in the leaf, settling its final  outline, so that, however wandering and fantastic it may appear, there  is not the smallest curve or serration which does not bear witness to a  methodical development, and to every accidental circumstance which  helped or hindered its fulfilment.    You could not do better than make a collection of suitable leaves, press  them flat and trace them very carefully, keeping the tracings together  in a book for reference. Accompanying this you should have in each case  a drawing of the leaf as it appears in its natural state, always being  careful to do this from a point of view which will accommodate itself to  carving the leaf if you should have occasion to use it.          CHAPTER XVIII    CARVING ON FURNITURE           Furniture Constructed with a View to Carving--Reciprocal Aims of       Joiner and Carver--Smoothness Desirable where Carving is       Handled--The Introduction of Animals or Figures.      [Illustration: FIG. 53.]    You will find in the illustrations, Figs. 53 to 62, certain suggestions  for various pieces of furniture. They are given with the intention of  impressing upon you the fact that very little carving can be done at all  without some practical motive as a backbone to your fancies. To be  always carving inapplicable panels is very dull work, and only good for  a few preliminary exercises. It is much better to consider the matter  well, and resolve upon some \"opus,\" which will spread your efforts over  a considerable period. When you have decided upon the piece of furniture  which is most likely to be useful to you, and which lies within your  powers of design and execution, then make a drawing for it, and have it  made by a joiner (unless you can make it entirely yourself), to be put  together in loose pieces for convenience of carving, and glued up when  that is finished. You should certainly design the piece yourself, as you  should make all your own designs for the carving. The two departments  must be carried on in the closest relation to each other while the work  is in progress, otherwise their association will not be complete when it  is finished. Take, for instance, the head of the bed in the  illustration. Why should it stand up so high, like the gable of a house?  It is for no other reason than to give an opportunity for carving. A  plain board of half the height would have been just as effective as a  protection to the sleeper. Useless as carving may be from this practical  point of view, it must nevertheless be amenable to utilitarian laws. It  must be smooth where it is likely to be handled, as in the case of the  knobs on top of the posts; and even where it is not likely to be  handled, but may be merely touched occasionally, it should still have an  inviting smoothness of surface. As a matter of fact, all carving on a  bed should be of this kind, with no deep nooks or corners to hold dust.  Here, then, are a number of conditions, which, instead of being a  hindrance, are really useful incentives to fresh invention. Just as the  construction of joiner's work entails concessions on the part of the  carver, so the carver may ask the joiner to go a little out of his way  in order to give opportunities for his carving. A little knowledge of  this subject will make a reasonable compromise possible.    You will find a further advantage in undertaking a fairly large piece of  work. As it is almost certain to be in several parts, each may thus  receive a different treatment, by which means you not only obtain  contrast, but get some idea of the extraordinary power with which one  piece of carving affects another when placed in juxtaposition. Whatever  designs you may decide upon, should you undertake to carve the panels  for a bed, let them be in decidedly low relief. The surface must be  smoothly wrought, doing away with as much of the tool marking as you  can, but this smoothing to be done entirely with the tools, not by any  means with glass paper. Great attention must be paid to the drawing of  the forms, as it is by this that the impression of modeling and  projection will be expressed. A very pleasant treatment of such low  relief when a smooth and even appearance is wanted, is to carve the  ground to the full depth, say 1/8 in., only along the outlines of the  design, and form the remainder into a kind of raised cushion, almost  level in the middle with the original surface of the wood. The whole  design need thus be little more than a kind of deepish engraving,  depending for its effect upon broad lights defined by the engraved  shadows. See Fig. 54 for an example of this treatment applied to  letters.    [Illustration: FIG. 54.]    Now I expect you to make a fresh design. The illustrations in all such  cases are purposely drawn in a somewhat indefinite way, in order that  they may suggest, without making it possible to copy.    [Illustration: FIG. 55.]    Now we come to the mirror frame, Fig. 55. I should suggest that this be  done in some light-colored wood like pear-tree, which has an agreeably  warm tone, or if a hard piece of cedar can be found, it would look well,  but in no case should polish be added except that which comes from the  tool. The construction need not be complicated. Take two 3/4-in. boards,  glue them together to form the width, shape out the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22114"],[0,"A Plain Cookery Book for the Working Classes (#15)"],[1," the pips, as their bitterness would render the drink unpalatable; add  one ounce of sugar, or honey, pour a quart of boiling water to these,  cover up the jug, and allow the orangeade to stand and steep until quite  cold; it may then be given to the patient. This is a cooling beverage,  and may be safely given in cases of fever.      No. 206. HOW TO MAKE LEMONADE.    Proceed in all particulars as directed for making orangeade, using, for  the purpose, lemons instead of oranges.      No. 207. APPLE-WATER DRINK.    Slice up thinly three or four apples without peeling them, and boil  them in a very clean saucepan with a quart of water and a little sugar  until the slices of apples are become soft; the apple water must then be  strained through a piece of clean muslin, or rag, into a jug. This  pleasant beverage should be drunk when cold; it is considered beneficial  in aiding to allay scorbutic eruptions.      No. 208. HOW TO MAKE A SOOTHING DRINK FOR COUGHS.    Take of marsh-mallow roots and of liquorice roots each one ounce; of  linseed, half an ounce; shave the roots very thinly; put them and the  linseed into a clean earthen pot with one quart of hot water, cover with  the lid, and set the whole on the hob of the fire to simmer for half an  hour or more; then strain the drink into a clean jug, sweeten with  honey, and when it has become quite cold, let it be given in small  quantities several times in the course of the day. This mucilaginous  beverage is most beneficial in relieving persons who are suffering from  cold on the chest, and also those who are afflicted with gravel, etc.      No. 209. LINSEED TEA.    Put a table-spoonful of linseed into a clean earthen pot or pipkin with  a quart of water, and a little orange or lemon rind; boil this gently  for about ten minutes, and then strain it through muslin into a jug;  sweeten with honey or sugar, add the juice of a lemon, stir all  together, and give this beverage to allay irritation of the chest and  lungs--in the latter case, the lemon juice had better be omitted.  Linseed tea in its purest form is an excellent accessory in aiding to  relieve such as are afflicted with gout, gravel, etc.      No. 210. CAMOMILE TEA.    Put about thirty flowers into a jug, pour a pint of boiling water upon  them, cover up the tea, and when it has stood about ten minutes, pour it  off from the flowers into another jug; sweeten with sugar or honey;  drink a tea-cupful of it fasting in the morning to strengthen the  digestive organs, and restore the liver to healthier action. A  tea-cupful of camomile tea, in which is stirred a large dessert-spoonful  of moist sugar, and a little grated ginger, is an excellent thing to  administer to aged people a couple of hours before their dinner.      No. 211. BALM AND BURRAGE TEA.    These, as well as all other medicinal herbs, may easily be cultivated in  a corner of your garden, when you are so fortunate as to live in a  cottage of your own in the country; they are also to be obtained from  all herbalists in large towns. Take of balm and burrage a small handful  each, put this into a jug, pour in upon the herbs a quart of boiling  water, allow the tea to stand for ten minutes, and then strain it off  into another jug, and let it become cold. This cooling drink is  recommended as a beverage for persons whose system has become heated  from any cause.      No. 212. SAGE OR MARYGOLD TEA.    Put a dozen sage leaves into a tea-pot, pour boiling water upon them,  and, after allowing the tea to stand for five or ten minutes, it may be  drunk with sugar and milk, in the same way and instead of the cheaper  kinds of teas, which are sold for foreign teas, but which are too often  composed of some kind of leaf more or less resembling the real plant,  without any of its genuine fragrance, and are, from their spurious and  almost poisonous nature, calculated to produce evil to all who consume  them, besides the drawback of their being expensive articles.    Teas made from sage leaves, dried mint, marygolds, and more  particularly the leaf of the black currant tree, form a very pleasant as  well as wholesome kind of beverage; and, if used in equal proportions,  would be found to answer very well as a most satisfactory substitute for  bad and expensive tea.      No. 213. HOW TO STEW RED CABBAGES.    The use of the red cabbage in this country is confined to its being  pickled almost raw, and eaten in that detestable and injurious state,  whereby its anti-scorbutic powers are annulled.    The red cabbage, when merely boiled with bacon, or with a little butter  and salt, is both nutritious and beneficial in a medicinal point of  view, inasmuch as that it possesses great virtue in all scorbutic and  dartrous affections. On the Continent it is customary to administer it  in such cases in the form of a syrup, and also in a gelatinized state.  The red cabbage, stewed in the following manner, will be found a very  tasty dish:--Slice up the red cabbage rather thin, wash it well, drain  it, and then put it into a saucepan with a little dripping or butter, a  gill of vinegar, pepper and salt; put the lid on, and set the cabbage to  stew slowly on the hob, stirring it occasionally from the bottom to  prevent it from burning; about an hour's gentle stewing will suffice to  cook it thoroughly. All kinds of cabbage or kail are anti-scorbutic  agents.      No. 214. HOW TO MAKE TOAST WATER.    Toast a piece of bread thoroughly browned to its centre without being  _burnt_, put it into a jug, pour boiling water upon it, cover over and  allow it to stand and steep until it has cooled; it will then be fit to  drink.      No. 215. HOW TO MAKE BARLEY WATER.    Boil one ounce of barley in a quart of water for twenty minutes; strain  through muslin into a jug containing a bit of orange or lemon peel.      No. 216. HOW TO MAKE RICE WATER.    To six ounces of rice add two quarts of water, and two ounces of  Valentia raisins; boil these very gently for about half an hour, or  rather more; strain off the water into a jug, add about two  table-spoonfuls of brandy. Rice water, prepared as above, is recommended  in cases of dysentery and diarrhoea.      No. 217. HOW TO MAKE TREACLE POSSET.    Sweeten a pint of milk with four table-spoonfuls of treacle, boil this  for ten minutes; strain it through a rag; drink it while hot, and go to  bed well covered with blankets; and your cold will be all the less and  you the better for it.      No. 218. HOW TO MAKE WHITE WINE WHEY.    Put a pint of milk into a very clean saucepan or skillet, to boil on the  fire; then add half a gill of any kind of white wine; allow the milk to  boil up, then pour it into a basin, and allow it to stand in a cool  place, that the curd may fall to the bottom of the basin; then pour off  the whey--which is excellent as an agent to remove a severe cough or  cold.      No. 219. HOW TO MAKE A CORDIAL FOR COLDS.    First, prepare a quart of the juice of black currants, by bruising and  boiling them for twenty minutes, and then straining off the juice with  great pressure through a sieve into a basin. Next, boil four ounces of  linseed in a quart of water until reduced to one-third of its original  quantity, taking care that it does not boil fast, and, when done, strain  the liquid into a very clean saucepan; add the currant juice, two pounds  of moist sugar, and half an ounce of citric acid, or one pint of lemon  juice; boil all together until reduced to a thick syrup--that is, when  it begins to run rather thick from the spoon without resembling treacle;  as soon as the syrup has reached this stage, remove it from the fire,  and pour it into a jug to become quite cold. This syrup will keep good  for any length of time, if bottled and corked down tight, and kept in a  cool place. A tea-spoonful taken occasionally will soon relieve the most  troublesome cough.    This cordial may also be prepared in winter, using for the purpose black  currant jam, or preserved black currant juice, instead of the juice of  fresh-gathered currants.      No. 220. HOW TO MAKE A STRINGENT GARGLE.    Put the following ingredients into a very clean earthen pipkin:--Twenty  sage leaves, a handful of red rose leaves, and a pint of water; boil  these for twenty minutes, then add a gill of vinegar, and two  table-spoonfuls of honey; boil again for ten minutes, and strain the  gargle through a muslin rag, to be used when cold.      No. 221. A SIMPLE REMEDY AGAINST WIND ON THE STOMACH.    A few drops (say four) of essence of peppermint on a lump of sugar.      No. 222. A CURE FOR A HARD DRY COUGH.    Take of each one table-spoonful--spermaceti grated, honey, and  peppermint water; mix all together with the yolks of two eggs in a  gallipot. A tea-spoonful to be taken on the tongue, and allowed to be  swallowed slowly as it dissolves.      No. 223. A COOLING DRINK.    To half an ounce of cream of tartar, add one ounce of loaf sugar, and a  bit of orange or lemon peel; put these into a jug, pour upon them a  quart of boiling water; stir all together, and allow the beverage to  become cold.      No. 224. HOP TEA.    Pour a quart of boiling water upon half an ounce of hops, cover this  over, and allow the infusion to stand for fifteen minutes; the tea must  then be strained of into another jug. A small tea-cupful may be drunk  fasting in the morning, which will create an appetite, and also  strengthen the digestive organs.      No. 225. LIME-FLOWER TEA.    To half an ounce of lime-flowers, placed in a tea-pot or jug, pour a  pint of boiling water, and when the infusion has stood for ten minutes,  sweeten with honey or sugar, and drink the tea hot, to assuage the pains  in the stomach and chest, arising from indigestion. This beverage may  also be successfully administered in attacks of hysteria.      No. 226. HYSSOP TEA: A REMEDY FOR WORMS.    To a quarter of an ounce of dried hyssop flowers, pour one pint of  boiling water; allow the tea to infuse "]]]
