Of course  there is free egress and ingress at all times, to permit the animal to  go after its food, which consists of plants that grow in the water close  at hand.    The house being completed, and the cold weather having set in, the whole  family, parents and all, enter it, and remain there during the winter,  going out only at intervals for necessary purposes.  In spring they  desert this habitation and never return to it.    Of course they are warm enough during winter while thus housed, even in  the very coldest weather.  The heat of their own bodies would make them  so, lying as they do, huddled together, and sometimes on top of one  another, but the mud walls of their habitations are a foot or more in  thickness, and neither frost nor rain can penetrate within.    Now, a curious fact has been observed in connection with the houses of  these creatures.  It shows how nature has adapted them to the  circumstances in which they may be placed.  By philosophers it is termed  \"instinct\"; but in our opinion it is the same sort of instinct which  enables Mr Hobbs to pick a \"Chubb\" lock.  It is this:--    In southern climates--in Louisiana, for instance--the swamps and rivers  do not freeze over in winter.  There the muskrat does not construct such  houses as that described, but is contented all the year with his burrow  in the banks.  He can go forth freely and seek his food at all seasons.    In the north it is different.  There for months the rivers are frozen  over with thick ice.  The muskrat could only come out under the ice, or  above it.  If the latter, the entrance of his burrow would betray him,  and men with their traps, and dogs, or other enemies, would easily get  at him.  Even if he had also a water entrance, by which he might escape  upon the invasion of his burrow, he would drown for want of air.  Although an amphibious animal, like the beaver and otter, he cannot live  altogether under water, and must rise at intervals to take breath.  The  running stream in winter does not perhaps furnish him with his favourite  food--the roots and stems of water-plants.  These the swamp affords to  his satisfaction; besides, it gives him security from the attacks of men  and preying animals, as the wolverine and fisher.  Moreover, his house  in the swamp cannot be easily approached by the hunter--man--except when  the ice becomes very thick and strong.  Then, indeed, is the season of  peril for the muskrat, but even then he has loopholes of escape.  How  cunningly this creature adapts itself to its geographical situation!  In  the extreme north--in the hyperborean regions of the Hudson's Bay  Company--lakes, rivers, and even springs freeze up in winter.  The  shallow marshes become solid ice, congealed to their very bottoms.  How  is the muskrat to get under water there?  Thus, then, he manages the  matter:--    Upon deep lakes, as soon as the ice becomes strong enough to bear his  weight, he makes a hole in it, and over this he constructs his  dome-shaped habitation, bringing the materials up through the hole, from  the bottom of the lake.  The house thus formed sits prominently upon the  ice.  Its entrance is in the floor--the hole which has already been  made--and thus is kept open during the whole season of frost, by the  care and watchfulness of the inmates, and by their passing constantly  out and in to seek their food--the water-plants of the lake.    This peculiar construction of the muskrat's dwelling, with its  water-passage, would afford all the means of escape from its ordinary  enemies--the beasts of prey--and, perhaps, against these alone nature  has instructed it to provide.  But with all its cunning it is, of  course, outwitted by the superior ingenuity of its enemy--man.    The food of the muskrat is varied.  It loves the roots of several  species of _nymphae_, but its favourite is _calamus_ root (_calamus_ or  _acorus aromaticus_).  It is known to eat shell-fish, and heaps of the  shells of fresh-water muscles (_unios_) are often found near its  retreat.  Some assert that it eats fish, but the same assertion is made  with regard to the beaver.  This point is by no means clearly made out;  and the closet naturalists deny it, founding their opposing theory, as  usual, upon the teeth.  For my part, I have but little faith in the  \"teeth,\" since I have known horses, hogs, and cattle greedily devour  both fish, flesh, and fowl.    The muskrat is easily tamed, and becomes familiar and docile.  It is  very intelligent, and will fondly caress the hand of its master.  Indians and Canadian settlers often have them in their houses as pets;  but there is so much of the rat in their appearance, and they emit such  a disagreeable odour in the spring, as to prevent them from becoming  general favourites.  They are difficult to cage up, and will eat their  way out of a deal box in a single night.  Their flesh, although somewhat  musky, is eaten by the Indians and white hunters, but these gentry eat  almost everything that \"lives, breathes, and moves.\"  Many Canadians,  however, are fond of the flesh.    It is not for its flesh that the muskrat is so eagerly hunted.  Its fur  is the important consideration.  This is almost equal to the fur of the  beaver in the manufacture of hats, and sells for a price that pays the  Indians and white trappers for the hardships they undergo in obtaining  it.  It is, moreover, used in the making of boas and muffs, as it  somewhat resembles the fur of the pine marten or American sable  (_Mustela martes_), and on account of its cheapness is sometimes passed  off for the latter.  It is one of the regular articles of the Hudson's  Bay Company's commerce, and thousands of muskrat skins are annually  obtained.  Indeed, were it not that the animal is prolific and difficult  to capture, its species would soon suffer extermination.    The mode of taking it differs from that practised in trapping the  beaver.  It is often caught in traps set for the latter, but such a  \"catch\" is regarded in the light of a misfortune, as until it is taken  out the trap is rendered useless for its real object.  As an amusement  it is sometimes hunted by dogs, as the otter is, and dug out of its  burrow; but the labour of laying open its deep cave is ill repaid by the  sport.  The amateur sportsman frequently gets a shot at the muskrat  while passing along the bank near its haunts, and almost as frequently  misses his aim.  The creature is too quick for him, and dives almost  without making a bubble.  Of course once in the pool it is seen no more.    Many tribes of Indians hunt the muskrat both for its flesh and skin.  They have peculiar modes of capturing it, of one of which the  hunter-naturalist gave an account.  A winter which he had spent at a  fort in the neighbourhood of a settlement of Ojibways gave him an  opportunity of witnessing this sport in perfection.        CHAPTER TEN.    A RAT-HUNT.    \"Chingawa,\" began he, \"a Chippeway or Ojibway Indian, better-known at  the fort as `Old Foxey,' was a noted hunter of his tribe.  I had grown  to be a favourite with him.  My well-known passion for the chase was a  sort of masonic link between us; and our friendship was farther  augmented by the present of an old knife for which I had no farther use.  The knife was not worth twopence of sterling money, but it made `Old  Foxey' my best friend; and all his `hunter-craft'--the gatherings of  about sixty winters--became mine.    \"I had not yet been inducted into the mystery of `rat-catching,' but the  season for that `noble' sport at length arrived, and the Indian hunter  invited me to join him in a muskrat hunt.    \"Taking our `traps' on our shoulders, we set out for the place where the  game was to be found.  This was a chain of small lakes or ponds that ran  through a marshy valley, some ten or twelve miles distant from the fort.    \"The traps, or implements, consisted of an ice-chisel with a handle some  five feet in length, a small pickaxe, an iron-pointed spear barbed only  on one side, with a long straight shaft, and a light pole about a dozen  feet in length, quite straight and supple.    \"We had provided ourselves with a small stock of eatables as well as  materials for kindling a fire--but no Indian is ever without these.  We  had also carried our blankets along with us, as we designed to make a  night of it by the lakes.    \"After trudging for several hours through the silent winter forests, and  crossing both lakes and rivers upon the ice, we reached the great marsh.  Of course, this, as well as the lakes, was frozen over with thick ice;  we could have traversed it with a loaded waggon and horses without  danger of breaking through.    \"We soon came to some dome-shaped heaps rising above the level of the  ice.  They were of mud, bound together with grass and flags, and were  hardened by the frost.  Within each of these rounded heaps, Old Foxey  knew there was at least half a dozen muskrats--perhaps three times that  number--lying snug and warm and huddled together.    \"Since there appeared no hole or entrance, the question was how to get  at the animals inside.  Simply by digging until the inside should be  laid open, thought I.  This of itself would be no slight labour.  The  roof and sides, as my companion informed me, were three feet in  thickness; and the tough mud was frozen to the hardness and consistency  of a fire-brick.  But after getting through this shell, where should we  find the inmates?  Why, most likely, we should not find them at all  after all this labour.  So said my companion, telling me at the same  time that there were subterranean, or rather subaqueous, passages, by  which the muskrats would be certain to make off under the ice long  before he had penetrated near them.    \"I was quite puzzled to know how we should proceed.  Not so Old Foxey.

There were but a few families that met with  the kind treatment that mine did. The majority of the people were  censured and persecuted as much as they were able to stand and  live.    In justice to the Prophet Joseph I cannot say that I ever heard  him teach or even encourage men to steal little things. He told  the people to wait until the proper time came to take their  rights.    \"Then,\" said he, \"take the whole State of Missouri like men.\"    When the people at Adam-on-Diamond had signed the treaty and  complied with the stipulations, the committee of twelve commenced  their duties. When it came my turn to receive the property  necessary to take me out of the State I was told to fit myself  out comfortably. I told them that I had a wife and one child;  that I had two good wagons, one a heavy one-horse wagon, with  thills, and that I had a large mare which was equal to a common  span; that the mare and wagon would do me. I wanted some bedding  and our clothing, and some other traps of little value. I had a  good milk cow that I wished to give to a friend who had lost all  his cattle. His wife had died a short time before, leaving a  little babe that must have milk. I told them they could take the  rest of my property and do with it as they did with that of the  brethren. I was worth then in property, at a fair valuation, four  thousand dollars.    The officers were astonished at me, and said they did not, wish  to oppress a man who acted fairly. They told me to take my large  wagon and two of my best horses, and all the outfit that I  wanted. I thanked them for their kindness. I was permitted to  give the cow to my friend, and I had the privilege of taking such  articles as I wished. I fitted up with just what would take me to  Illinois, and left the remainder as a spoil for the enemies of  the Church. I did not regret the loss of my property; I gave it  up as the price of my religious freedom.    Before I speak of other things I will say a few words of the  country we were then in. Adam-on-Diamond was at the point where  Adam came and settled and blest his posterity after being driven  from the Garden of Eden. This was revealed to the people through  Joseph the Prophet. The Temple Block in Jackson County, Missouri,  stands on the identical spot where once stood the Garden of Eden.  When Adam and Eve were driven from the Garden they traveled in a  northwesterly course until they came to a valley on the east side  of Grand River. There they tarried for several years, and engaged  in tilling the soil. On the east of the valley there is a low  range of hills. Standing on the summit of the bluffs a person has  a full view of the beautiful valley that lies below, dotted here  and there with groves of timber. On the top of this range of  hills Adam erected an altar of stone, on which he offered  sacrifice unto the Lord. There was in our time (1838) a pile of  stone there, which the Prophet said was a portion of the altar on  which Adam offered sacrifice. Although these stones had been  exposed to the elements for many generations, still the traces  remained to show the dimensions and design of the altar. After  Adam had offered his sacrifice he went up the valley some two  miles, where he blessed his posterity and called the place the  Valley of Adam-on-Diamond, which, in the reformed Egyptian  language, signifies Adam's Consecrated Land. It is said to be  seventy-five miles, in a direct course, from the Garden of Eden  to Adam-on-Diamond. Those ancient relics and sacred spots of  earth are held holy by the greater portion of the Latter-day  Saints. These things, and much more concerning the early days,  were revealed to the Prophet Joseph.    On the 20th day of November, 1838, I took leave of my home and  the sacred ground of Adam-on-Diamond and started as a banished  man to seek a home in Illinois. We went to my farm on Shady Grove  Creek, and stayed over night. We found everything as we had left  it, nothing having been interfered with. I killed a large hog and  dressed it to carry with us to cat on the journey. The snow was  fully twenty inches deep, weather very cold, and, taken all in  all, it was a disagreeable and unpleasant trip.    We went to the settlement on Log Creek and stopped with the  family of Robert Bidwell. He had plenty of property. This man had  good teams, and had reaped where he had not sown, gathered where  he had not strewn. He was engaged in removing families of his  helpless brethren to Quincy, Illinois, who had not teams to move  themselves, but who had a little money that he was after, and he  got all they had. For some reason unexplained to me he had been  permitted to keep all of his property; none of it was taken by  the troops.    While at Bidwell's I bought a crib of corn, about two hundred  bushels, for a pocketknife. I built a stable for my mare, a crib  for the com, and hauled wood enough to do the family the rest of  the winter. I also attended to Bidwell's stock and worked all the  time for him. They had five children, which made considerable  work for the women folks; my wife worked for them all the time.    During this time we had nothing but corn to eat. The hog I killed  at my farm was diseased, and I had to throw the meat away.  Notwithstanding our constant work for Bidwell's family, they  never gave us a drop of milk or a meal of victuals while we  remained there. Mrs. Bidwell fed six gallons of milk to their  hogs each day. I offered to feed the hogs corn for milk, so we  could have milk to eat with our boiled corn, but she refused the  offer, saying they had all the corn they needed. They did have  provisions of every kind in abundance, but not a particle of food  could we obtain from them.    Prayer meetings were frequently held at their house. They had  plenty of tallow, but Mrs. Bidwell would not allow a candle to be  burned in the house unless some other person furnished it. One  night at prayer meeting I chanced to speak upon the subject of  covetousness, and quoted the twelfth chapter of Paul to the  Corinthians, where he speaks of members of the Church of Christ  being united. I was feeling bad to see so much of the covetousness  of the world in some of the members of the Church, and I talked  plainly upon the subject.    The next morning Mrs. Bidwell came into our room and said that my  remarks at the meeting the evening before were directed at her,  and she wanted me to understand that if I did not like my  treatment there she desired us to go where we would fare better.  This inhuman and unwelcome language did not sit well on an empty  stomach, and was more than I could bear. I burst into tears. Yet  I pitied the ungrateful woman. As soon as I could control my  feelings I said:    \"Sister Bidwell, I will take you at your word. I will leave your  house as soon as I can get my things into my wagon, but before I  leave you I wish to say a few words for you to ponder on when we  are gone. In the first place, you and I profess to be members of  the same Church; for the sake of our faith my family has been  broken up and driven from a comfortable home in this inclement  season of the year. We came here seeking shelter from the stormy  blasts of winter, until the severity of the weather was past,  when we intended to leave this State. You have been more  fortunate than your brethren and sisters who lived in Daviess  County. You are allowed to live in your own house, but we are  homeless wanderers. Now you drive us from the shelter of your  roof for a trivial offense, if offense it was. But I assure you  that you are only angry because my words were the truth. Woe unto  you who are angry and offended at the truth. As you do unto  others, so will your Heavenly Father do unto you. Inasmuch as you  have done this unchristian act, you will yet be houseless and  homeless - you will be one day dependent upon those that you now  drive from your door.\"    At first she mocked me, but soon her tune changed and she  commenced to cry. She then begged me not to get angry with what a  woman said. I told her I could not undo what I had said - that I  should start at once for Quincy, Illinois.    We left the house of that stingy and selfish family, intending to  go direct to Illinois. We traveled until we arrived at the house  of a man by the name of Morris; they had a much smaller house  than Bidwell's, but they would not listen to our continuing our  journey during the severe cold weather. We accepted their  invitation, and stayed there about two weeks. This family  possessed the true Christian spirit, and treated us while there  as kindly as if we had been their own children.    While staying with Brother Morris I attended several meetings at  Far West. Old Father Smith, the father of the Prophet, led the  meetings. He also directed the exodus of the Saints from Missouri  to Illinois.    Thomas B. Marsh was at that time President of the twelve  apostles, and I think Brigham Young was second and Orson Hyde the  third on the roll. The great opposition to our people and Church  caused the two pillars, Marsh and Hyde, to become weak-kneed and  turn over to the enemy. Col. G. M. Hinkle, Dr. Averard, Judge W.  W. Phelps, and others of the \"tall\" men of the Church followed  suit. I remember going with Brother Levi Stewart to some of those  fallen angels (in the days of our prosperity they had looked like  angels to me) to inquire what to do and what was to be the future  conduct of our people. G. M. Hinkle said that it was his opinion  our leaders, the Prophet Joseph and those with him in prison,  would be either hanged or imprisoned for life - that the members  of the Church would scatter to the four winds, and never gather  again in this dispensation.    We then went to Joseph's father and asked"]]]
