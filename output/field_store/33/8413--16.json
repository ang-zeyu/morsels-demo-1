In the case of  the 2nd Division the patch was diamond in shape. The 7th Brigade colour  was a light blue and the Battalion colour white. The \"28th\" therefore  wore a blue and white diamond, and by this badge was ever afterwards  distinguished.    About this time a slight change was made in the Battalion Staff. W.O. J.  Gettingby was promoted to be Quartermaster and Hon. Lieutenant. His  position as R.S.M. was filled by C.S.M. P. T. C. Bell.    On the 28th August orders were received that the Battalion would be  relieved on the following Monday and march out to camp. On the 30th  August the 5th Australian Training Battalion, commanded by Major J. S.  Lazarus, took over the garrison duties and the 28th, after being  photographed in mass formation, moved by way of the desert road, through  the Tombs of the Khalifs and Abbasia, to Aerodrome Camp, recently  vacated by the 5th Brigade. Only tents were available here, and the camp  was very dusty. As the tenancy was likely to be of a few days duration  only, these inconveniences were submitted to with a good grace.    Wheeled transport and riding horses could not, at that stage, be either  safely or profitably used on Gallipoli, so to the bitter disappointment  of Lieut. Graham and his section, the Divisional Commander ordered that  they be left behind--later on to be grouped with the rest of the  Divisional Train, exercised, and held in readiness against being  required.    On the 1st September a message from Brigade Headquarters directed that  the Battalion would proceed \"overseas\" on the 3rd September. All surplus  stores were at once got rid of, and spare baggage collected to be handed  over to the care of the Australian Base. The Regimental Orderly-room  Clerk, Staff Sergeant S. S. Thompson, was detailed and departed for duty  at the Australian Headquarters in Egypt, where he would be responsible  for the proper keeping of Battalion records.    The 2nd September witnessed the departure for Alexandria of a small  advance party, under Lieut. H. E. C. Ruddock, charged with the duty of  making all necessary arrangements for the reception of the troops when  arriving at the wharf. Tents were struck that afternoon and a bivouac  formed for the night.    After the evening meal on the following day the Battalion fell in, and a  check of the _personnel_ was made. Previously a number of sick, and the  few men in detention, had been struck off the strength and shown as  transferred to the Training Depot. It was now found that three or four  men were missing. As time did not permit of a search being made, a  report was sent to the A.P.M., and the additional names were also  removed from the roll.    Late that night the move commenced to Qubba station, where the train was  boarded. Each man was bearing a heavy burden. All ranks were fitted with  web equipment, carrying in their packs great coats and a few necessaries  and personal belongings, and bearing a blanket, waterproof sheet, three  days' rations of biscuits and preserved meat, together with an emergency  ration in a sealed tin, and (for those with rifles) 200 rounds of  ammunition. Officers carried revolvers, field glasses, prismatic  compass, and various other extras. They were also allowed to place their  valises on the train but, according to rumour, it was doubtful if they  would ever reach them on Gallipoli.    The entrainment was expeditiously carried out and, with the usual amount  of discomfort, the journey to the quay at Alexandria was completed by  daylight on the 4th September. Here Lieut. Ruddock was waiting and,  after some delay, the Battalion embarked on the transport in a similar  manner, minus the sympathetic crowd, to that witnessed at Fremantle.          CHAPTER V.    GALLIPOLI.      At this stage it is necessary, in order that the future environment may  be fully understood, to give some account of the Gallipoli Peninsula and  of the events of the 25th April, 1915, and later.    The Peninsula forms the European side to the Straits of the Dardanelles  and is about 53 miles in length. On the north-western side it is washed  by the waters of the Gulf of Xeros and on the western side by the Aegean  Sea. Near its northern end, at Bulair, it is only two and a half miles  across. At Suvla Burnu[G] it broadens out to about 12 miles, but narrows  again between Gaba Tepe[H] and Maidos to a bare four miles. Gaba Tepe is  about eight miles south of Suvla Burnu and Helles Burnu--the southern  end of the Peninsula--13 miles further. Cliffs of marl or sand, rising  very abruptly and varying in height from 100 to 300 feet, mark the  greater length of the shore. These are broken here and there by the  gullies which bring away from the interior the waters of the heavy  autumn and winter rains. From Gaba Tepe northwards to Suvla Bay there is  an almost uninterrupted stretch of beach from which, opposite the latter  feature, a somewhat marshy plain runs back to the foothills of Tekke  Tepe.    Groups of hills are marked features of the interior, the most prominent  being known as Sari Bair[I] which rises to a height of 971 feet at Koja  Chemin Tepe and is the one most familiar to the Australians. These hills  possess very steep--even precipitous--slopes which are much excoriated  by wind, rain, and frost, and broken into an amazing tangle of gullies  and hollows. Firs and stunted oaks, brushwood, oleanders or  rhododendrons, and other shrubs are thick wherever they can hold, and  form no inconsiderable obstacle--two to four feet high--to anyone's  passage.    Before the war a very small part of the land was under cultivation. A  few miniature olive and currant orchards, attempts at vineyards, and  trifling patches of beans and grain, represented the sole efforts at  tillage. There were no railways, and the few roads in existence were in  poor condition. In or near what afterwards became the British zone, the  only communities were those grouped around the fortifications near  Helles and the villages of Krithia, Kurija Dere, Biyuk Anafarta, and  Anafarta Sagir. On the side nearer Asia, Maidos, Galata, and Gallipoli  boasted the status of towns. Between these last-named points and into  the Sea of Marmara the communication and trade were mostly carried on by  means of boats.    [Illustration: SHOWING ALLIED LINES AT THE TIME OF THE EVACUATION.  _Map by Australian War Museum._]    The Gallipoli Peninsula formed part of Thrace of the ancients. Through  it Xerxes, the Persian king, after crossing the Dardanelles, attacked  the Greeks with an army and followers estimated at over 2,000,000. This  was about 480 B.C. It also lay in the route of Alexander the Great in  his march on Egypt and India commenced in 334 B.C. Later on it was  overrun by the Gauls, recovered by the Greeks, occupied by the Romans in  the 2nd century A.D., passed into the possession of the Venetians 1,000  years later, and was finally held by the Turks as a result of their  invasion of Europe in 1356. In 1807 a British naval squadron forced the  passage of the Straits but suffered considerable damage, when returning,  from large stone shot fired from the guns of the forts. Again, in 1853,  the British and French fleets sailed into the Sea of Marmara in support  of the Turks who were on the verge of war with Russia. At Bulair, in  March and April, 1854, the British troops on the way to the Crimea  landed, and, in conjunction with their allies, constructed across the  neck of the Peninsula the fortifications known as the Bulair Lines.    Following the outbreak of the great European War, Turkey, on the 31st  October, 1914, definitely threw in her lot with Germany. In order to  deal with the Ottoman, and at the same time restore communication with  Russia through the Black Sea route, the French and British Governments  decided to force the Straits. A bombardment was opened on the 3rd  November, 1914, but lasted for a few minutes only. On the 19th February  following, and succeeding days, a heavy bombardment was carried out and  small craft were engaged in mine-sweeping up towards the Narrows. Again,  on the 18th March, the attack was renewed--some ships penetrating the  Strait eight or ten miles--but the Turks loosed some large mines which  floated down and sunk three of the battleships. Now it became obvious  that the aid of land forces must be sought in order to deal with the  enemy defences. That task was committed to an army already assembling in  Egypt and on Lemnos Island. This army was under the command of General  Sir Ian Hamilton and was composed of a French Division, the 29th British  Division, the Royal Naval Division, and the Australian and New Zealand  Army Corps; the last-named formation being commanded by Major-General  Sir William Birdwood.    Very early in the morning of the 25th April, 1915, the attack was  commenced. The French troops landed at Kum Kale--on the Asiatic side of  the Strait; the 29th Division, and part of the R.N. Division, at five  places at the southern end of the Peninsula; the Anzac Corps at a cove  about 3,000 yards north of Gaba Tepe; whilst the major portion of the  R.N. Division was sent under convoy to make a feint in the Gulf of Xeros  near to the Bulair Lines.    The Australian attack was led by the 3rd Brigade (including the 11th  Battalion). After a week's heroic fighting (in which the 16th Battalion  took a prominent part) under conditions never before experienced in  warfare, and the loss of 9,000 killed, wounded, and missing, a position  was made good which extended in an arc from the foot of Walker's Ridge,  on the north, up to Russell's Top, across the head of Monash Gully, to  MacLaurin's Hill, continuing to Bolton's Ridge and resecting the beach  about 2,000 yards north of Gaba Tepe. The base of this arc measured  about 2,700 yards and the enclosed area did not exceed three-quarters of  a square mile.    During the next three months the Corps was reinforced by various"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25447"],[0,"Mysticism and Logic and Other Essays (#15)"],[1,"gic, and its propositions are  deduced from the general axioms of logic, such as the syllogism and  the other rules of inference. And this is no longer a dream or an  aspiration. On the contrary, over the greater and more difficult part  of the domain of mathematics, it has been already accomplished; in the  few remaining cases, there is no special difficulty, and it is now  being rapidly achieved. Philosophers have disputed for ages whether  such deduction was possible; mathematicians have sat down and made the  deduction. For the philosophers there is now nothing left but graceful  acknowledgments.    The subject of formal logic, which has thus at last shown itself to be  identical with mathematics, was, as every one knows, invented by  Aristotle, and formed the chief study (other than theology) of the  Middle Ages. But Aristotle never got beyond the syllogism, which is a  very small part of the subject, and the schoolmen never got beyond  Aristotle. If any proof were required of our superiority to the  mediæval doctors, it might be found in this. Throughout the Middle  Ages, almost all the best intellects devoted themselves to formal  logic, whereas in the nineteenth century only an infinitesimal  proportion of the world's thought went into this subject.  Nevertheless, in each decade since 1850 more has been done to advance  the subject than in the whole period from Aristotle to Leibniz. People  have discovered how to make reasoning symbolic, as it is in Algebra,  so that deductions are effected by mathematical rules. They have  discovered many rules besides the syllogism, and a new branch of  logic, called the Logic of Relatives,[11] has been invented to deal  with topics that wholly surpassed the powers of the old logic, though  they form the chief contents of mathematics.    It is not easy for the lay mind to realise the importance of symbolism  in discussing the foundations of mathematics, and the explanation may  perhaps seem strangely paradoxical. The fact is that symbolism is  useful because it makes things difficult. (This is not true of the  advanced parts of mathematics, but only of the beginnings.) What we  wish to know is, what can be deduced from what. Now, in the  beginnings, everything is self-evident; and it is very hard to see  whether one self-evident proposition follows from another or not.  Obviousness is always the enemy to correctness. Hence we invent some  new and difficult symbolism, in which nothing seems obvious. Then we  set up certain rules for operating on the symbols, and the whole thing  becomes mechanical. In this way we find out what must be taken as  premiss and what can be demonstrated or defined. For instance, the  whole of Arithmetic and Algebra has been shown to require three  indefinable notions and five indemonstrable propositions. But without  a symbolism it would have been very hard to find this out. It is so  obvious that two and two are four, that we can hardly make ourselves  sufficiently sceptical to doubt whether it can be proved. And the same  holds in other cases where self-evident things are to be proved.    But the proof of self-evident propositions may seem, to the  uninitiated, a somewhat frivolous occupation. To this we might reply  that it is often by no means self-evident that one obvious proposition  follows from another obvious proposition; so that we are really  discovering new truths when we prove what is evident by a method which  is not evident. But a more interesting retort is, that since people  have tried to prove obvious propositions, they have found that many of  them are false. Self-evidence is often a mere will-o'-the-wisp, which  is sure to lead us astray if we take it as our guide. For instance,  nothing is plainer than that a whole always has more terms than a  part, or that a number is increased by adding one to it. But these  propositions are now known to be usually false. Most numbers are  infinite, and if a number is infinite you may add ones to it as long  as you like without disturbing it in the least. One of the merits of a  proof is that it instils a certain doubt as to the result proved; and  when what is obvious can be proved in some cases, but not in others,  it becomes possible to suppose that in these other cases it is false.    The great master of the art of formal reasoning, among the men of our  own day, is an Italian, Professor Peano, of the University of  Turin.[12] He has reduced the greater part of mathematics (and he or  his followers will, in time, have reduced the whole) to strict  symbolic form, in which there are no words at all. In the ordinary  mathematical books, there are no doubt fewer words than most readers  would wish. Still, little phrases occur, such as _therefore, let us  assume, consider_, or _hence it follows_. All these, however, are a  concession, and are swept away by Professor Peano. For instance, if we  wish to learn the whole of Arithmetic, Algebra, the Calculus, and  indeed all that is usually called pure mathematics (except Geometry),  we must start with a dictionary of three words. One symbol stands for  _zero_, another for _number_, and a third for _next after_. What these  ideas mean, it is necessary to know if you wish to become an  arithmetician. But after symbols have been invented for these three  ideas, not another word is required in the whole development. All  future symbols are symbolically explained by means of these three.  Even these three can be explained by means of the notions of  _relation_ and _class_; but this requires the Logic of Relations,  which Professor Peano has never taken up. It must be admitted that  what a mathematician has to know to begin with is not much. There are  at most a dozen notions out of which all the notions in all pure  mathematics (including Geometry) are compounded. Professor Peano, who  is assisted by a very able school of young Italian disciples, has  shown how this may be done; and although the method which he has  invented is capable of being carried a good deal further than he has  carried it, the honour of the pioneer must belong to him.    Two hundred years ago, Leibniz foresaw the science which Peano has  perfected, and endeavoured to create it. He was prevented from  succeeding by respect for the authority of Aristotle, whom he could  not believe guilty of definite, formal fallacies; but the subject  which he desired to create now exists, in spite of the patronising  contempt with which his schemes have been treated by all superior  persons. From this \"Universal Characteristic,\" as he called it, he  hoped for a solution of all problems, and an end to all disputes. \"If  controversies were to arise,\" he says, \"there would be no more need of  disputation between two philosophers than between two accountants. For  it would suffice to take their pens in their hands, to sit down to  their desks, and to say to each other (with a friend as witness, if  they liked), 'Let us calculate.'\" This optimism has now appeared to be  somewhat excessive; there still are problems whose solution is  doubtful, and disputes which calculation cannot decide. But over an  enormous field of what was formerly controversial, Leibniz's dream has  become sober fact. In the whole philosophy of mathematics, which used  to be at least as full of doubt as any other part of philosophy, order  and certainty have replaced the confusion and hesitation which  formerly reigned. Philosophers, of course, have not yet discovered  this fact, and continue to write on such subjects in the old way. But  mathematicians, at least in Italy, have now the power of treating the  principles of mathematics in an exact and masterly manner, by means of  which the certainty of mathematics extends also to mathematical  philosophy. Hence many of the topics which used to be placed among the  great mysteries--for example, the natures of infinity, of continuity,  of space, time and motion--are now no longer in any degree open to  doubt or discussion. Those who wish to know the nature of these things  need only read the works of such men as Peano or Georg Cantor; they  will there find exact and indubitable expositions of all these quondam  mysteries.    In this capricious world, nothing is more capricious than posthumous  fame. One of the most notable examples of posterity's lack of judgment  is the Eleatic Zeno. This man, who may be regarded as the founder of  the philosophy of infinity, appears in Plato's Parmenides in the  privileged position of instructor to Socrates. He invented four  arguments, all immeasurably subtle and profound, to prove that motion  is impossible, that Achilles can never overtake the tortoise, and that  an arrow in flight is really at rest. After being refuted by  Aristotle, and by every subsequent philosopher from that day to our  own, these arguments were reinstated, and made the basis of a  mathematical renaissance, by a German professor, who probably never  dreamed of any connection between himself and Zeno. Weierstrass,[13]  by strictly banishing from mathematics the use of infinitesimals, has  at last shown that we live in an unchanging world, and that the arrow  in its flight is truly at rest. Zeno's only error lay in inferring (if  he did infer) that, because there is no such thing as a state of  change, therefore the world is in the same state at any one time as at  any other. This is a consequence which by no means follows; and in  this respect, the German mathematician is more constructive than the  ingenious Greek. Weierstrass has been able, by embodying his views in  mathematics, where familiarity with truth eliminates the vulgar  prejudices of common sense, to invest Zeno's paradoxes with the  respectable air of platitudes; and if the result is less delightful to  the lover of reason than Zeno's bold defiance, it is at any rate more  calculated to appease the mass of academic mankind.    Zeno was concerned, as a matter of fact, with three problems, each"]]]
