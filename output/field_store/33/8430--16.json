STATE OF ILLINOIS                             GOVERNOR'S OFFICE                                Springfield              Since, on viewing the past in perspective, we can            derive a lesson such as is contained in the            steady, sure advance of the world by successive            steps toward a higher moral consciousness with a            broad humanitarianism as its basis, may we not, by            virtue of this fact, find the way lighted to the            future--a future in which men and women will            combine forces and resort to helpful co-operation            in all those things which add to the sum of human            happiness. If history shows that the most rapid            strides toward a lofty civilization have been made            since both the sexes assumed this attitude of            mutual helpfulness, does it not, by that same            token, reveal the source of greatest efficiency            while indicating that feminism is humanism, and            thus foretelling the trend of human development.

[Illustration]              Customer--That was the driest flattest sandwich I            ever tried to chew into!              Waiter--Why here's your sandwich! You ate your            check.          SANDWICH RECIPES      Hawaiian Sandwiches    Chop finely one pimento, one green pepper freed from seeds, and a small  cream cheese; add a good pinch of salt and spread between slices of  buttered bread.      Chocolate Sandwiches    Butter and thinly slice white bread; make a chocolate filling exactly  like fudge, but do not allow it to boil quite to the candy stage; spread  between the slices of bread, press together and trim neatly.      Caramel Sandwiches    Melt a tablespoon of butter with a cup of light brown sugar, and a  tablespoon of water; cook for a few moments, till well incorporated,  then spread between slices of buttered bread.      Fruit Sandwiches    Chop candied cherries, dried figs and stoned dates together; make a  paste with a little orange juice, and spread between buttered slices of  graham bread.      Cucumber Sandwiches    Pare and slice cucumbers crosswise. Marinate in French dressing and  place between rounds of buttered bread.      Anchovy Canapes    Cream 2 tablespoons butter; add 1/2 teaspoon Anchovy paste; spread thin  slices of fresh toast with this; over that put slices of hard boiled or  chopped egg and on top one rolled anchovy.      Sandwiches    Another delightful way of using sardines is as a sandwich. Beat two  ounces of butter until it is soft, then add a little salt, nutmeg,  Nepaul pepper, 2 teaspoons of tomato catsup and a few drops of lemon  juice.    Remove the skin and the backbone from three sardines, and pound them to  a paste in a mortar with the prepared butter.    Pass the mixture through a wire sieve and spread it rather thickly on  fingershaped pieces of buttered brown bread, and make into sandwiches  with a little fine cress between the bread.      Filling for Sandwiches              1 cup yellow cheese            1 cup tomato juice            1/2 cup chipped beef ground            1 egg beaten separately    Cook tomato juice until it thickens, add cheese, beef and egg last; if  the mixture is too thick, add cream.      Apple Sandwiches    Take bran or whole wheat bread cut thin and spread thin with peanut  butter. Wash, pare, quarter, core and slice the apples very thin spread  between the bread. Or the bread can be buttered and thin slices of apple  put between, then the apple is dusted with a little salt.

Moisten with dressing, fill the shells, replace the tops and serve.          COLORED SALADS              A Salad to Fit in With Any Scheme of Decoration            You May Wish to Carry Out.      Yellow    To make a yellow salad use the yellower heart leaves of lettuce. On them  put diced orange pulp, dressed with French dressing and sprinkled with  chopped walnut meats. Or else scoop out the centers of small  yellow-skinned apples and fill them with a mixture of orange and apple,  dressed with mayonnaise made with lemon juice for thinning and a  flavoring of mustard.      Green    On green, but tender leaves of lettuce, put a little mound of spinach,  which has been boiled and pressed through a sieve and mixed with French  dressing. In the center of each mound, concealed by the spinach, put a  spoonful of chopped hard-boiled egg.      Green and White    Peel and boil tiny white turnips of equal size and hollow out the center  of each. Fill with cold boiled peas and mayonnaise and put on green  lettuce leaves.      White    Celery, potato, chicken--white meat only--white fish, blanched  asparagus--any or two of these may be used for white salad. Dress with  French dressing or with a white mayonnaise, to which the beaten white of  egg has been added and which has been thinned with vinegar.      Red    Scoop out the inside of tomatoes. Save the slice removed from the top  for a cover and replace it on the tomato after filling it with a mixture  of celery and nut meats, mixed with mayonnaise. Place each tomato on a  white leaf of lettuce.      Pink    Strain tomato juice and mix it with equal quantity of white stock--veal  or chicken. Thicken sufficiently with gelatin and harden in molds. Serve  on white lettuce leaves, with mayonnaise that has been colored with a  little cranberry juice.

It was made mostly of  dry grass and locust blossoms, with here and there a piece of twine  braided into the structure.  It had no special lining, but the grass  was more evenly woven on the inside of the cup than elsewhere.    From three to five eggs are deposited.  The ground color is white,  either pure or creamy, sparingly mottled with rich madder-brown and  lilac-gray, the spots being thicker and larger on the larger end.  While the nest is undergoing examination, the owners circle and hover  overhead, much after the fashion of the red-winged blackbirds,  expressing their disapproval in loud and musical calls, and displaying  their rich scarlet decorations.    My descriptions have related only to the male bird, whose beautiful  forked tail is nine to ten inches long, and whose colors are clear and  more or less intense.  His spouse resembles him, but is slightly  smaller, while her tail, though forked like her mate's, is from two and  a half to three inches shorter.  The salmon and scarlet ornaments on  the sides, flanks, and axillars are paler than those of her lord, and  the scarlet spot shows very indistinctly on her occiput.  The young of  both sexes don the dress of the mother bird during the first season,  save that they fail to adorn themselves with a scarlet gem on the crown.    Like all the members of the flycatcher group, the scissorstails capture  insects while on the wing, making many an attractive picture as they  perform their graceful and interesting evolutions in the air.    It was a year or two later that I saw a scissorstail performing his  ablutions in the northwestern part of Arkansas.  How do you suppose he  went about it?  Not in the way birds usually do, by squatting down in  the shallow water, twinkling their wings and tail, and sprinkling the  liquid all over their plumage.  No; this bird has a reputation to  maintain for originality, and therefore he took his bath in this  manner: First he perched on a telegraph wire by the roadside; then he  swung gracefully down to a little pond, dashed lightly into the water,  giving himself a slight wetting, after which he flew up to his original  perch on the wire.  A minute or less was then spent in preening his  plumes; but they were not moist enough to suit his purpose, so he  darted down to the pond again, making the spray rise as lie struck the  water; then up to his perch he swung again, to arrange his feathers;  and this was repeated a number of times, till his toilet was completed.  It would not be safe to risk saying that the scissorstail always takes  his bath in this way; but I know this one did.  I once saw a kingbird  doing the same thing, and so it may be a fashion in flycatcher circles.    I am minded, in order to make this monograph more complete, to borrow a  couple of paragraphs from Mrs. Bailey's \"Handbook of Birds of the  Western United States.\"  She has studied the bird in the Southwest, and  gives the following graphic description of the bird and its habits:    \"One of his favorite performances is to fly up and, with rattling  wings, execute an aerial seesaw, a line of sharp-angled VVVVVVV's,  helping himself at the short turns by rapidly opening and shutting his  long white scissors.  As he goes up and down he utters all the while a  penetrating scream, _Ka-quee-ka-quee-ka-quee-ka-quee-ka-quee_, the  emphasis being given each time at the top of the ascending line.    \"Frequently when he is passing along with the even flight of a  sober-minded crow, and you are quietly admiring the salmon lining of  his wings, he shoots rattling into the air, and, as you stare after  him, drops back as suddenly as he rose.  He does this apparently  because the spirit moves him, as a boy slings a stone at the sky, but  fervor is added by the appearance of a rival or an enemy, for he is  much like a _Tyrannus_ in his masterful way of controlling the  landscape.  He will attack caracaras and white-necked ravens, lighting  on their backs and giving them vicious blows while screaming in their  ears.\"          AN ALPINE ROSY FINCH*    *Part of the material used in this chapter has already appeared in the  author's work entitled \"Birds of the Rockies,\" but it is here printed  in different form, that of a monograph, with a number of additional  facts.  The writer feels that the readers of the present volume will  relish at least a taste of bird study among the alpine heights of the  Rocky Mountains.  The article is reprinted from the \"Denver Post,\"  whose courtesy is hereby acknowledged.      The common name of the subject of this sketch is the brown-capped rosy  finch; in the scientific works on ornithology he is called the  brown-capped leucosticte.  He is certainly a bird of peculiar habits  and out-of-the-way preferences.  Should he send you his card from his  summer residence, it would read something like this: \"At home in the  mountains of Colorado, from 10,000 feet above sea-level to the summits  of the highest peaks.\"  There is only one other bird in Colorado that  has so high a summer range, and that is the white-tailed ptarmigan,  usually called, in hunter's parlance, the \"mountain quail.\"    The rosy finch is slightly larger than the bluebird.  His general color  is light brown, suffused with a beautiful pink or rosy tint, the dark  shaft lines and pale edges of the feathers of the back giving it a  striped appearance.  The forepart of the top of the head is blackish,  and the cap is brown, from which he gets the qualifying adjective of  his name.  In the best nuptial plumage the rosy coloring is heightened  to an intense crimson, especially on the wings, tail coverts, and the  under parts.  The female's attire is paler and duller of tint, the pink  being sometimes almost obsolete.  Oddly enough, in summer the bills of  these birds are deep black, while in winter they become yellow, only  the tip remaining black or blackish.    My introduction to the leucostictes occurred on the summit of Pikes  Peak, at an elevation of 14,147 feet above the level of the sea.  With  exhausting toil I climbed the peak one night, and the next morning,  when I stepped out of the signal station, where I had secured lodging,  a flock of the brown-caps were flitting merrily about the garbage heap,  helping themselves to an early breakfast.  Their blithe chirping  sounded very much like conversation all among themselves, and  proclaimed two pleasant traits of character--cheerfulness and good  temper.  It was evident that they were happy and contented in their  alpine home, in the upper story of the world, the rare, cool,  exhilarating air, the majestic panoramas, and the unlimited freedom all  contributing to the blithesomeness of their spirits.  The keepers of  the signal station told me that the birds came to the refuse pile every  day for their meals.    Two years later, on the twenty-eighth of June, a friend and I clambered  up Grays Peak, which is several hundred feet higher than Pikes Peak.  It was a long and toilsome climb, winding about the snowbeds of the  mountain side.  Sometimes we scaled straight up the acclivity on \"all  fours,\" throwing ourselves down on the rocks at frequent intervals to  rest our aching limbs and fill our lungs with the rarefied air; up and  up and up, until at last, with a long pull and a strong pull, we stood  on the sky-haunting ridge above all the surrounding elevations, looking  down upon the rest of the world, which seemed to be crouching at our  feet.    Long before we reached the summit we were saluted by a new bird  voice--one that had not been heard farther down the mountain.  It was a  cordial chirp, which seemed to bid us welcome to the alpine region and  to assure us that there was no risk in climbing to these sky-aspiring  summits.  A glance proved that our little salutarian was the  brown-capped rosy finch, which I had not seen since my ascent of Pikes  Peak.  Down in the green, copsy valley at the base of the mountain we  had met with the white-crowned sparrows and Wilson and Audubon  warblers; then, as we began to climb the steep shoulder of the  mountain, the American pipits had become our comrades, accompanying us  about half way up the elevation; now all other birds had disappeared  and we entered the arctic precincts of the leucostictes, which, like a  gallant bodyguard, escorted us to the summit, cheering us on with their  friendly chirping.  The bailiwicks of the pipits and the rosy finches  slightly overlapped, as did also those of the pipits and the  white-crowned sparrows near the great mountain's base.  However, no  pipits ventured to the upper story of this elevated region--at least,  not at the time of our visit, although they may have ascended to the  summit later in the season.    How blithe and cheerful were the pretty leucostictes!  Now they darted  fearlessly about in the air over the summit and the gorges; now they  alighted on the wall of the dilapidated old signal station, and anon  hopped and flitted about over the extensive snow beds, picking up  dainties that were evidently to their taste, all the while beguiling  the time with their companionable, half-musical chirping.  So far as I  observed, they have no real song.  If they have, it is strange that  they did not furnish a sample of their lyrical gifts on so calm and  sweet a summer day in the season of courtship.    What billsome morsels did they find on the snow?  We examined their  white tablecloth and found a number of small beetles and other insects  creeping up through it or crawling around over its surface.  Thus  Nature spreads her banquet everywhere for her feathered children.    One cannot help falling into the speculative mood as one reflects on  these little birds and their remarkable habits.  Why do they, of all  birds, choose the highest mountain peaks for their summer homes?  Might  the cause be physiological?  Are their lungs, muscles, and nervous "]]]
