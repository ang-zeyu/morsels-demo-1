Happily for the United  States Navy it started with a long lead over its enemy. More happily  still it could expand with the help of greatly superior resources.  Most happily of all, the sevenfold expansion that was effected  before the war was over could be made under leaders like Farragut:  leaders, that is, who, though in mere numbers they were no more, in  proportion to their whole service, than the flag as mere material  is to a man-of-war, were yet, as is the flag, the living symbol  of a people's soul.    Commerce protection on the high seas was an exceedingly harassing  affair. A few swift raiders, having the initiative, enjoyed great  advantages over a far larger number of defending vessels. Every  daring raid was trumpeted round the world, bringing down unmeasured,  and often unmerited, blame on the defense. The most successful  vigilance would, on the other hand, pass by unheeded. The Union  navy lacked the means of patrolling the sea lanes of commerce over  millions and millions of desolate square miles. Consequently the  war-risk insurance rose to a prohibitive height on vessels flying  the Stars and Stripes; and, as a further result, enormous transfers  were made to other flags. The incessant calls for recruits, afloat  and ashore, and to some extent the lure of the western lands, also  robbed the merchant service of its men. Thus, one way and another,  the glory of the old merchant marine departed with the Civil War.    Blockade was more to the point than any attempt to patrol the sea  lanes. Yet it was even more harassing; for it involved three distinct  though closely correlated kinds of operation: not only the seizure,  in conjunction with the army, of enemy ports, and the patrolling of  an enemy coastline three thousand miles long, but also the patrolling  of those oversea ports from which most contraband came. This oversea  patrol was the most effective, because it went straight to the  source of trouble. But it required extraordinary vigilance, because  it had to be conducted from beyond the three-mile limit, and with  the greatest care for all the rights of neutrals.    By mid-November Farragut was back at New Orleans. A month later  General Banks arrived with reinforcements. He superseded General  Butler and was under orders to coöperate with McClernand, Grant's  second-in-command, who was to come down the Mississippi from Cairo.  But the proposed meeting of the two armies never took place. Banks  remained south of Port Hudson, McClernand far north of Vicksburg;  for, as we shall see in the next chapter, Sherman's attempt to take  Vicksburg from the North failed on the twenty-ninth of December.    The naval and river campaigns of '62 thus ended in disappointment  for the Union. And, on New Year's Day, Galveston, which Farragut had  occupied in October without a fight and which was lightly garrisoned  by three hundred soldiers, fell into Confederate hands under most  exasperating circumstances. After the captain and first lieutenant  of the U.S.S. _Harriet Lane_ had been shot by the riflemen aboard two  cotton-clad steamers the next officer tamely surrendered. Commander  Renshaw, who was in charge of the blockade, amply redeemed the honor  of the Navy by refusing to surrender the _Westfield_, in spite  of the odds against him, and by blowing her up instead. But when  he died at the post of duty the remaining Union vessels escaped;  and the blockade was raised for a week.    After that Commodore H. H. Bell, one of Farragut's best men, closed  in with a grip which never let go. Yet even Bell suffered a reverse  when he sent the U.S.S. _Hatteras_ to overhaul a strange vessel that  lured her off some fifteen miles and sank her in a thirteen-minute  fight. This stranger was the _Alabama_, then just beginning her famous  or notorious career. Nor were these the only Union troubles in the  Gulf during the first three weeks of the new year. Commander J.  N. Matt ran the _Florida_ out of Mobile, right through the squadron  that had been specially strengthened to deal with her; and the  shore defenses of the Sabine Pass, like those of Galveston, fell  into Confederate hands again, to remain there till the war was  over.    In spite of all failures, however, Farragut still had the upper  hand along the Gulf, and up the Mississippi as far as New Orleans,  without which admirable base the River War of '62 could never  have prepared the way for Grant's magnificent victory in the River  War of '63.          CHAPTER IV    THE RIVER WAR: 1862    The military front stretched east and west across the border States  from the Mississippi Valley to the sea. This immense and fluctuating  front, under its various and often changed commanders, was never a  well coördinated whole. The Alleghany Mountains divided the eastern  or Virginian wing from the western or \"River\" wing. Yet there was  always more or less connection between these two main parts, and  the fortunes of one naturally affected those of the other. Most  eyes, both at home and abroad, were fixed on the Virginian wing,  where the Confederate capital stood little more than a hundred  miles from Washington, where the greatest rival armies fought,  and where decisive victory was bound to have the most momentous  consequences. But the River wing was hardly less important; for  there the Union Government actually hoped to reach these three  supreme objectives in this one campaign: the absolute possession of  the border States, the undisputed right of way along the Mississippi  from Cairo to the Gulf, and the triumphant invasion of the lower  South in conjunction with the final conquest of Virginia.    We have seen already how the Union navy, aided by the army, won  its way up the Mississippi from the Gulf to Baton Rouge, but failed  to secure a single point beyond. We shall now see how the Union  army, aided by the navy, won its way down the Mississippi from  Cairo to Memphis, and fairly attained the first objective--the  possession of the border States; but how it also failed from the  north, as the others had failed from the south, to gain a footing  on the crucial stretch between Vicksburg and Port Hudson. One more  year was required to win the Mississippi; two more to invade the  lower South; three to conquer Virginia.      Just after the fall of Fort Sumter the Union Government had the  foresight to warn James B. Eads, the well-known builder of Mississippi  jetties, that they would probably draw upon his \"thorough knowledge  of our Western rivers and the use of steam on them.\" But it was  not till August that they gave him the contract for the regular  gunboat flotilla; and it was not till the following year that his  vessels began their work. In the meantime the armies were asking for  all sorts of transport and protective craft. So the first flotilla on  Mississippi waters started under the War (not the Navy) Department,  though manned under the executive orders of Commander John Rodgers,  U. S. N., who bought three river steamers at Cincinnati, lowered  their engines, strengthened their frames, protected their decks,  and changed them into gunboats.    The first phase of the clash in this land of navigable rivers had  ended, as we have seen already, with the taking of Boonville on  the Missouri by that staunch and daring Union regular, General  Nathaniel Lyon, on June 17, 1861. Boonville was a stunning blow  to secession in those parts. Confederate hopes, however, again  rose high when the news of Bull Run came through. At this time  General John C. Frémont was taking command of all the Union forces  in the \"Western Department,\" which included Illinois and everything  between the Mississippi and the Rockies. Frémont's command, however,  was short and full of trouble. Round his headquarters at St. Louis  the Confederate colors were flaunted in his face. His requisitions  for arms and money were not met at Washington. Union regiments  marched in without proper equipment and with next to no supplies.  There were boards of inquiry on his contracts. There were endless  cross-purposes between him and Washington. And early in November he  was transferred to West Virginia just as he was about to attack with  what seemed to him every prospect of success. He had not succeeded.  But he had done good work in fortifying St. Louis; in ordering  gunboats, tugs, and mortar-boats; in producing some kind of system  out of utter confusion; in trusting good men like Lyon; and in  sending the then unknown Ulysses Grant to take command at Cairo,  the excellent strategic base where the Ohio joins the Mississippi.    The most determined fighting that took place during Frémont's command  was brought on by Lyon, who attacked Ben McCulloch at Wilson's Creek,  in southwest Missouri, on the tenth of August. Though McCulloch had  ten thousand, against not much over five, Lyon was so set on driving  the Confederates away from such an important lead-bearing region  that he risked an attack, hoping by surprise, skillful maneuvers,  and the help of his regulars to shake the enemy's hold, even if  he could not thoroughly defeat him. Disheartened by his repeated  failure to get reinforcements, and very anxious about the fate  of his flanking column under Sigel, whose attack from the rear  was defeated, he expressed his forebodings to his staff. But the  light of battle shone bright as ever in his eyes; he was killed  leading a magnificent charge; and when, after his death, his little  army drew off in good order, the Confederates, by their own account,  \"were glad to see him go.\"    On the twentieth of September the Confederates under Sterling Price  won a barren victory by taking Lexington, Missouri, where Colonel  James Mulligan made a gallant defense. That was the last Confederate  foothold on the Missouri; and it could not be maintained.    In October, Anderson, who had never recovered from the strain of  defending Fort Sumter, turned over to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26490"],[0,"Lord Milner's Work in South Africa (#15)"],[1," provide a remedy, were  insignificant as compared with the more real grievances, such as the  attack upon the independence of the law courts, the injury to  industrial life caused by a corrupt and incompetent administration,  and the denial of elementary political rights, which no technical  observance of the Convention would remove. Nor did it escape Lord  Milner's notice that a policy of rigid insistence upon the letter of  the Conventions might place the Imperial Government in a position of  grave disadvantage. If any breach of the Conventions was once made the  subject of earnest diplomatic complaint, the demand of the Imperial  Government must be enforced even at the cost of war. The Conventions,  therefore, should be invoked as little as possible. For, if the Boers  denied the British Law Officers' interpretation of the text, the  Imperial Government might find itself on the horns of a dilemma.  Either it must beat an undignified retreat, or it must make war upon  the Transvaal for a mere technicality, a proceeding which would gain  for the Republic a maximum, and for the Imperial Government a minimum  of sympathy and support. Therefore, he said, \"Keep the Conventions in  the background. If we are to fight let it be about something that is  essential to the peace and well-being of South Africa, and not a mere  diplomatic wrangle between the Pretoria Executive and the British  Government.\"             [Footnote 28: Apart from the question of the validity of the           preamble to the Pretoria Convention (1881), two           Conventions--the London Convention (1884), and the Swaziland           Convention (1894)--were in force between the South African           Republic and Great Britain. The relations of the Imperial           Government to the Free State were regulated by the           Bloemfontein Convention (1854). This latter and the Sand           River Convention (1852), were the Conventions of Grey's           time.]    [Sidenote: Transvaal affairs.]    Lord Milner's hope that President Krueger might meet him half-way,  although it was shown by subsequent events to have been devoid of  foundation, had for the moment superficial appearances in its favour.  After their retreat on the question of the Aliens Immigration Law the  attitude of the Pretoria Executive remained for some time outwardly  less hostile to the Imperial Government. Woolls-Sampson and \"Karri\"  Davies were released from Pretoria gaol in honour of Queen Victoria's  Jubilee,[29] and at the same period the first and only step was taken  that offered a genuine promise of reform from within. The Industrial  Commission, appointed earlier in the year by the Executive at the  request of President Krueger, surprised the Uitlander community by  conducting its inquiry with a thoroughness and impartiality that left  no ground for complaint. Its report, reviewing in detail the  conditions of the mining industry, was published in July. It afforded  a complete confirmation of the fiscal and administrative complaints  put forward by the Uitlanders against the Government; and as Mr.  Schalk Burger, the Chairman of the Commission, was both a member of  the Executive and the leader of the more progressive section of the  Boers, there seemed to be a reasonable prospect of the recommendations  of the Report being carried into effect. Scarcely more than six months  later President Krueger proved conclusively that the hope of these, or  of any other, reforms was entirely unfounded; but so long as there  remained any prospect of the Uitlanders and the Transvaal Government  being able to settle their differences by themselves, Lord Milner  consistently pursued his intention of \"making things easy\" for the  Transvaal Government. And this although the Pretoria Executive soon  began to make heavy drafts upon his patience in other respects.[30]             [Footnote 29: These two men, now Colonel Sir Aubrey           Woolls-Sampson and Major W. D. \"Karri\" Davies, had refused to           sign the petition of appeal--an act of submission which           President Krueger required of the Johannesburg Reformers,           before he released them from Pretoria gaol. They did so on           the ground that the Imperial Government had made itself           responsible for their safety; since they and the other           Reformers, with the town of Johannesburg, had laid down their           arms on the faith of Lord Rosmead's declaration that he would           obtain reasonable reforms from President Krueger for the           Uitlanders.]             [Footnote 30: In the question of the Swaziland border, the           affair of Bunu, and the continued and increasing           ill-treatment of the Cape Boys, the Boer Government           manifested its old spirit of aggression and duplicity. All           these matters involved Lord Milner in anxious and wearisome           negotiations, which, however, he contrived by mingled           firmness and address to keep within the limits of friendly           discussion.]    If Lord Milner was prepared to make the most of Paul Krueger and the  Boers, he showed himself no less ready to see the best side of the  Dutch in the Cape Colony. As we have already had occasion to notice,  the year of his appointment was that of the Diamond Jubilee  celebration; and on June 23rd he sent home a brief despatch in which  he dwelt with evident satisfaction upon the share taken by the Dutch  in the general demonstrations of loyalty called forth by the occasion  in the Cape Colony. After a reference to the number of loyal addresses  or congratulatory telegrams which had been sent to the Colonial  Secretary for transmission to the Queen, he continued:         \"The enthusiasm evoked here ... seems to me to be of peculiar       interest ... in view of recent events, which, as you are aware,       have caused a feeling of considerable bitterness among different       sections of the community. All I can say is that, so far as I am       able to judge, these racial differences have not affected the       loyalty of any portion of the community to Her Majesty the Queen.       People of all races, the English, the Dutch, the Asiatics, as       well as the African natives, have vied with one another in       demonstrations of affection for her person and devotion to the       throne. When every allowance is made for the exaggeration of       feeling caused by the unparalleled scale and prolonged duration       of the present festivities, and for the contagious excitement       which they have produced, it is impossible to doubt that the       feeling of loyalty among all sections of the population is much       stronger than has sometimes been believed. In my opinion, the       impression made by the world-wide celebration of Her Majesty's       Jubilee has strengthened that feeling throughout South Africa,       and is likely to have a permanent value.\"[31]             [Footnote 31: This short despatch has been given practically           _in extenso_. It was not published in the Blue-books, but it           was communicated to the Press some three months after it had           been received.]    [Sidenote: First impressions of the Dutch.]    It has been urged that the opinion here recorded is inconsistent with  the charge of anti-British sentiment subsequently brought by Lord  Milner against the Dutch leaders in the Cape Colony, and the despatch  itself has been cited as affording evidence of the contention that the  unfavourable view subsequently expressed in the Graaf Reinet speech,  and more definitely in the despatch of May 4th, 1899, was not the  result of independent investigation, but was a view formed to support  the Imperial Government in a coercive policy towards the Transvaal.  This criticism, which is a perfectly natural one, only serves to  establish the fact that Lord Milner actually did approach the study of  the nationality difficulty in complete freedom from any preconceived  notions on the subject. As he said, he went to South Africa with an  \"open mind.\" So far from having any prejudice against the Dutch, his  first impression was distinctly favourable, and as such he recorded  it, suitably enough, in this Jubilee despatch. But it must be  remembered that the opinion here recorded was based upon a very  limited field of observation. At the time when this despatch was  written Lord Milner had not yet been quite two months in South  Africa, and his experience of the Dutch of the Cape Colony had been  confined to intercourse with the Dutch of the Cape peninsula; that is  to say, he had only come into contact with that section of the Cape  Dutch which is, as indeed it has been for a century, closely  identified, from a social point of view, with the official and  mercantile British population of Capetown and its suburbs.    What the Jubilee despatch really shows is that Lord Milner was  prepared to make the best of the Dutch. The contrast between its tone  of ready appreciation and the note of earnest remonstrance in the  Graaf Reinet speech is apparent enough. The despatch is dated June  23rd, 1897; the speech was delivered on March 3rd, 1898. What had  happened in this interval of nine months to produce so marked a change  in the mind of the genial, clear-sighted Englishman, who, as Mr.  Asquith said, took with him to South Africa \"as sympathetic an  imagination\" as any man of his acquaintance? _Nemo repente fuit  turpissimus._ Whether the diagnosis of his Graaf Reinet speech was  right or wrong, something must have happened to turn Lord Milner from  ready appreciation to grave remonstrance.    The circumstances which provide the answer to this question form an  element of vital importance in the volume of evidence upon which  posterity will pronounce the destruction of the Dutch Republics in  South Africa to have been a just and necessary, or a needless and  aggressive, act.
