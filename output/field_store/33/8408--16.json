I was also slightly wounded in the thigh by a  piece of shell, but I had no time to attend such matters, as we had  to retire in haste, and the wound soon healed.    The next day our forces were again in full retreat to Pretoria, where  I understood we were to make a desperate stand. About seven o'clock we  passed through Fordsburg, a suburb of Johannesburg.    We had been warned not to enter Johannesburg, as Dr. Krause, who had  taken from me the command of the town, had already surrendered it to  Lord Roberts, who might shell it if he found commandos were there. Our  larger commissariat had proceeded to Pretoria, but we wanted several  articles of food, and strange to say the commissariat official at  Johannesburg would not give us anything for fear of incurring Lord  Roberts' displeasure!    I was very angry; the enemy were not actually in possession of the  town, and I therefore should have been consulted in the matter; but  these irresponsible officials even refused to grant us the necessaries  of life!    At this time there was a strong movement on foot to blow up the  principal mines about Johannesburg, and an irresponsible young person  named Antonie Kock had placed himself at the head of a confederacy  with this object in view. But thanks to the explicit orders of General  L. Botha, which were faithfully carried out by Dr. Krause, Kock's plan  was fortunately frustrated, and I fully agree with Botha that it would  have been most impolitic to have allowed this destruction. I often  wished afterwards, however, that the British military authorities had  shown as much consideration for our property.    We had to have food in any case, and as the official hesitated to  supply us we helped ourselves from the Government Stores, and  proceeded to the capital. The roads to Pretoria were crowded with men,  guns, and vehicles of every description, and despondency and despair  were plainly visible on every human face.          CHAPTER XV.    OCCUPATION OF PRETORIA.      The enemy naturally profited by our confusion to pursue us more  closely than before. The prospect before us was a sad one, and we  asked ourselves, \"What is to be the end of all this, and what is to  become of our poor people? Shall we be able to prolong the struggle,  and for how long?\"    But no prolongation of the struggle appeared to have entered into our  enemy's minds, who evidently thought that the War had now come upon  its last stage, and they were as elated as we were downhearted. They  made certain that the Boer was completely vanquished, and his  resistance effectually put an end to. At this juncture Conan Doyle,  after pointing out what glorious liberty and progress would fall to  the Boers' lot under the British flag, wrote:--         \"When that is learned it may happen that they will come to       date a happier life and a wider liberty from that 5th of       June which saw the symbol of their nation pass for ever from       the ensigns of the world.\"    Thus, not only did Lord Roberts announce to the world that \"the War  was now practically over,\" but Conan Doyle did not hesitate to say the  same in more eloquent style.    How England utterly under-estimated the determination of the Boers,  subsequent events have plainly proved. It is equally plain that we  ourselves did not know the strength of our resolution, when one takes  into account the pessimism and despair that weighed us down in those  dark days; and as the Union Jack was flying over our Government  buildings we might have exclaimed:--\"England, we do not know our  strength, but you know it still less!\"    Nearly all the commandos were now in the neighbourhood of Pretoria,  General Botha forming a rearguard, and we determined to defend the  capital as well as we could. But at this juncture some Boer officer  was said to have received a communication from the Government,  informing us that they had decided not to defend the town. A cyclist  was taking this communication round to the different commandos, but  the Commandant-General did not seem to be aware of it, and we tried in  vain to find him so as to discover what his plans were. The greatest  confusion naturally prevailed, and as all the generals gave different  orders, no one knew what was going to be done. I believe General Botha  intended to concentrate the troops round Pretoria, and there offer  some sort of resistance to the triumphant forces of the enemy, and we  had all understood that the capital would be defended to the last; but  this communication altered the position considerably. Shortly  afterwards all the Boer officers met at Irene Estate, near Pretoria,  in a council of war, and were there informed that the Government had  already forsaken the town, leaving a few \"feather-bed patriots\" to  formally surrender the town to the English.    I thought this decision of easy surrender ridiculous and  inexplicable, and many officers joined me in loud condemnation of it.  I do not remember exactly all that happened at the time, but I know a  telegram arrived from the Commandant-General saying that a crowd had  broken open the Commissariat Buildings in Pretoria and were looting  them. An adjutant was sent into Pretoria to spread an alarm that the  English were entering the town, and this had the effect of driving all  the looters out of it. Some of my own men were engaged in these  predatory operations, and I did not see them again until three days  after.    The English approached Pretoria very cautiously, and directed some big  naval guns on our forts built round the town, to which we replied for  some time with our guns from the \"randten,\" south-west of the town;  but our officers were unable to offer any organised resistance, and  thus on the 5th of June, 1900, the capital of the South African  Republic fell with little ado into the enemy's hands. Bloemfontein,  the capital of the Orange Free State, had months before suffered the  same fate, and thousands of Free Staters had surrendered to the  English as they marched from Bloemfontein to the Transvaal. Happily,  however, in the Free State President Steyn and General De Wet were  still wide awake and Lord Roberts very soon discovered that his long  lines of communication were a source of great trouble and anxiety to  him. The commandos, meanwhile, were reorganised; the buried Mausers  and ammunition were once more resurrected, and soon it became clear  that the Orange Free State was far from conquered.    The fall of Pretoria, indeed, was but a sham victory for the enemy. A  number of officials of the Government remained behind there and  surrendered, together with a number of burghers, amongst these  faint-hearted brethren being even members of the Volksraad and men who  had played a prominent part in the Republic's history; while to the  everlasting shame of them and their race, a number of other Boers  entered at once into the English service and henceforth used their  rifles to shoot at and maim their own fellow-countrymen.          CHAPTER XVI.    BATTLE OF DONKERHOEK (\"DIAMOND HILL\").      Our first and best positions were now obviously the kopjes which  stretched from Donkerhoek past Waterval and Wonderboompoort. This  chain of mountains runs for about 12 miles E. and N.E. of Pretoria,  and our positions here would cut off all the roads of any importance  to Pietersburg, Middelburg, as well as the Delagoa Bay railway. We  therefore posted ourselves along this range, General De la Rey forming  the right flank, some of our other fighting generals occupying the  centre, whilst Commandant-General Botha himself took command of the  left flank.    On the 11th of June, 1900, Lord Roberts approached with a force of  28,000 to 30,000 men and about 100 guns, in order, as the official  despatches had it, \"to clear the Boers from the neighbourhood of  Pretoria.\" Their right and left flanks were composed of cavalry,  whilst the centre was formed of infantry regiments; their big guns  were placed in good positions and their field pieces were evenly  distributed amongst the different army divisions.    Towards sunset they began booming away at our whole 13 miles of  defence. Our artillery answered their fire from all points with  excellent results, and when night fell the enemy retired a little with  considerable losses.    The battle was renewed again next day, the enemy attempting to turn  our right with a strong flanking movement, but was completely  repulsed. Meanwhile I at Donkerpoort proper had the privilege of being  left unmolested for several hours. The object of this soon became  apparent. A little cart drawn by two horses and bearing a white flag  came down the road from Pretoria. From it descended two persons,  Messrs. Koos Smit, our Railway Commissioner and Mr. J. F. de Beer,  Chief Inspector of Offices, both high officials of the South African  Republic. I called out to them from a distance.    \"Halt, you cannot pass. What do you want?\"    Smit said, \"I want to see Botha and President Kruger. Dr. Scholtz is  also with us. We are sent by Lord Roberts.\"    I answered Mr. Smit that traitors were not admitted on our premises,  and that he would have to stay where he was. Turning to some burghers  who were standing near I gave instructions that the fellows were to be  detained.    Mr. Smit now began to \"sing small,\" and turning deadly pale, asked in  a tremulous voice if there were any chance of seeing Botha.    \"Your request,\" I replied, \"will be forwarded.\" Which was done.    An hour passed before General Botha sent word that he was coming.  Meanwhile the battle continued raging fiercely, and a good many  lyddite bombs were straying our way. The \"white-flaggists\" appeared to  be very anxious to know if the General would be long in coming, and if  their flag could not be hoisted in a more conspicuous place. The  burghers guarding them pointed out, however, that the bombs came from  their "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2520"],[0,"The Man (#15)"],[1,"p, alone.  One a feeling natural enough to any one, and  especially to a girl, of relief that a dreaded hour had been postponed;  the other of chagrin that she was the first.    After a few moments, however, one of the two militant thoughts became  dominant: the feeling of chagrin.  With a pang she thought if she had  been a man and summoned for such a purpose, how she would have hurried to  the trysting-place; how the flying of her feet would have vied with the  quick rapturous beating of her heart!  With a little sigh and a blush,  she remembered that Leonard did not know the purpose of the meeting; that  he was a friend almost brought up with her since boy and girl times; that  he had often been summoned in similar terms and for the most trivial of  social purposes.    For nearly half an hour Stephen sat on the rustic seat under the shadow  of the great oak, looking, half unconscious of its beauty and yet  influenced by it, over the wide landscape stretched at her feet.    In spite of her disregard of conventions, she was no fool; the instinct  of wisdom was strong within her, so strong that in many ways it ruled her  conscious efforts.  Had any one told her that her preparations for this  interview were made deliberately with some of the astuteness that  dominated the Devil when he took Jesus to the top of a high mountain and  showed him all the kingdoms of the earth at His feet, she would have, and  with truth, denied it with indignation.  Nevertheless it was a fact that  she had, in all unconsciousness, chosen for the meeting a spot which  would evidence to a man, consciously or unconsciously, the desirability  for his own sake of acquiescence in her views and wishes.  For all this  spreading landscape was her possession, which her husband would share.  As  far as the eye could reach was within the estate which she had inherited  from her father and her uncle.    The half-hour passed in waiting had in one way its advantages to the  girl: though she was still as high strung as ever, she acquired a larger  measure of control over herself.  The nervous tension, however, was so  complete physically that all her faculties were acutely awake; very early  she became conscious of a distant footstep.    To Stephen's straining ears the footsteps seemed wondrous slow, and more  wondrous regular; she felt instinctively that she would have liked to  have listened to a more hurried succession of less evenly-marked sounds.  But notwithstanding these thoughts, and the qualms which came in their  turn, the sound of the coming feet brought great joy.  For, after all,  they were coming; and coming just in time to prevent the sense of  disappointment at their delay gaining firm foothold.  It was only when  the coming was assured that she felt how strong had been the undercurrent  of her apprehension lest they should not come at all.    Very sweet and tender and beautiful Stephen looked at this moment.  The  strong lines of her face were softened by the dark fire in her eyes and  the feeling which glowed in the deep blushes which mantled her cheeks.  The proudness of her bearing was no less marked than ever, but in the  willowy sway of her body there was a yielding of mere sorry pride.  In  all the many moods which the gods allow to good women there is none so  dear or so alluring, consciously as well as instinctively, to true men as  this self-surrender.  As Leonard drew near, Stephen sank softly into a  seat, doing so with a guilty feeling of acting a part.  When he actually  came into the grove he found her seemingly lost in a reverie as she gazed  out over the wide expanse in front of her.  He was hot after his walk,  and with something very like petulance threw himself into a cane  armchair, exclaiming as he did so with the easy insolence of old  familiarity:    'What a girl you are, Stephen! dragging a fellow all the way up here.  Couldn't you have fixed it down below somewhere if you wanted to see me?'    Strangely enough, as it seemed to her, Stephen did not dislike his tone  of mastery.  There was something in it which satisfied her.  The  unconscious recognition of his manhood, as opposed to her womanhood,  soothed her in a peaceful way.  It was easy to yield to a dominant man.  She was never more womanly than when she answered him softly:    'It was rather unfair; but I thought you would not mind coming so far.  It  is so cool and delightful here; and we can talk without being disturbed.'  Leonard was lying back in his chair fanning himself with his wide-brimmed  straw hat, with outstretched legs wide apart and resting on the back of  his heels.  He replied with grudging condescension:    'Yes, it's cool enough after the hot tramp over the fields and through  the wood.  It's not so good as the house, though, in one way: a man can't  get a drink here.  I say, Stephen, it wouldn't be half bad if there were  a shanty put up here like those at the Grands Mulets or on the  Matterhorn.  There could be a tap laid on where a fellow could quench his  thirst on a day like this!'    Before Stephen's eyes floated a momentary vision of a romantic chalet  with wide verandah and big windows looking over the landscape; a great  wide stone hearth; quaint furniture made from the gnarled branches of  trees; skins on the floor; and the walls adorned with antlers, great  horns, and various trophies of the chase.  And amongst them Leonard, in a  picturesque suit, lolling back just as at present and smiling with a  loving look in his eyes as she handed him a great blue-and-white Munich  beer mug topped with cool foam.  There was a soft mystery in her voice as  she answered:    'Perhaps, Leonard, there will some day be such a place here!'  He seemed  to grumble as he replied:    'I wish it was here now.  Some day seems a long way off!'    This seemed a good opening for Stephen; for the fear of the situation was  again beginning to assail her, and she felt that if she did not enter on  her task at once, its difficulty might overwhelm her.  She felt angry  with herself that there was a change in her voice as she said:    'Some day may mean--can mean everything.  Things needn't be a longer way  off than we choose ourselves, sometimes!'    'I say, that's a good one!  Do you mean to say that because I am some day  to own Brindehow I can do as I like with it at once, whilst the  governor's all there, and a better life than I am any day?  Unless you  want me to shoot the old man by accident when we go out on the First.'  He  laughed a short, unmeaning masculine laugh which jarred somewhat on her.  She did not, however, mean to be diverted from her main purpose, so she  went on quickly:    'You know quite well, Leonard, that I don't mean anything of the kind.  But there was something I wanted to say to you, and I wished that we  should be alone.  Can you not guess what it is?'    'No, I'll be hanged if I can!' was his response, lazily given.    Despite her resolution she turned her head; she could not meet his eyes.  It cut her with a sharp pain to notice when she turned again that he was  not looking at her.  He continued fanning himself with his hat as he  gazed out at the view.  She felt that the critical moment of her life had  come, that it was now or never as to her fulfilling her settled  intention.  So with a rush she went on her way:    'Leonard, you and I have been friends a long time.  You know my views on  some points, and that I think a woman should be as free to act as a man!'  She paused; words and ideas did not seem to flow with the readiness she  expected.  Leonard's arrogant assurance completed the dragging her back  to earth which her own self-consciousness began:    'Drive on, old girl!  I know you're a crank from Crankville on some  subjects.  Let us have it for all you're worth.  I'm on the grass and  listening.'    Stephen paused.  'A crank from Crankville!'--this after her nights of  sleepless anxiety; after the making of the resolution which had cost her  so much, and which was now actually in process of realisation.  Was it  all worth so much? why not abandon it now? . . . Abandon it!  Abandon a  resolution!  All the obstinacy of her nature--she classed it herself as  firmness--rose in revolt.  She shook her head angrily, pulled herself  together, and went on:    'That may be! though it's not what I call myself, or what I am usually  called, so far as I know.  At any rate my convictions are honest, and I  am sure you will respect them as such, even if you do not share them.'  She did not see the ready response in his face which she expected, and so  hurried on:    'It has always seemed to me that a--when a woman has to speak to a man  she should do so as frankly as she would like him to speak to her, and as  freely.  Leonard, I--I,' as she halted, a sudden idea, winged with  possibilities of rescuing procrastination came to her.  She went on more  easily:    'I know you are in trouble about money matters.  Why not let me help  you?'  He sat up and looked at her and said genially:    'Well, Stephen, you are a good old sort!  No mistake about it.  Do you  mean to say you would help me to pay my debts, when the governor has  refused to do so any more?'    'It would be a great pleasure to me, Leonard, to do anything for your  good or your pleasure.'    There was a long pause; they both sat looking down at the ground.  The  woman's heart beat loud; she feared that the man must hear it.  She was  consumed with anxiety, and with a desolating wish to be relieved from the  strain of saying more.  Surely, surely Leonard could not be so blind as  not to see the state of things! . . . He would surely seize the occasion;  throw aside his diffidence and relieve her! . . . His words made a  momentary music in her ears as he spoke:    'And is this what you asked me to come here for?'    The words filled her with a great shame.  She felt herself a dilemma.  It  had been no part of her purpose to allude his debts.  Viewed in the light  "]]]
