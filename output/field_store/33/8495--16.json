The hero is a dweller in the  interior, a member of the tribe of Chambas, who came to Algiers, as he  says, because he had predestined him to make that journey. The general  interrogates him, and the Arab recounts his adventures. As he had thrice  traversed the desert to the negro country beyond, and had seen beside  all the usual events in the life of that savage region, the author  violates no probability in putting into his mouth the most strange and  characteristic stories. The whole are told with a fictitious  reproduction of the teser and somewhat monotonous, yet figurative style,  proper to all savages. _La Grande Kabylie_ recounts the personal  experiences of the author in that yet unconquered country of the Arabs,  whither he went with Marshal Bugeaud in his last expedition. Kabylia he  describes as a picturesque and productive region. There are deep,  sheltered valleys, where along the shores of winding streams, nature has  planted hedges of perpetual flowers, while the mountains on each side  stand yellow with the ripe and ripening grain. The people are braver and  more energetic, their habitations more substantial, and their fields  more valuable than those in other parts of Algeria. Gen. Daumas would  have France subjugate this country and add it to her African dominions.           *       *       *       *       *    M. de Conches, who is well known for his illustrations of early French  literature, is an enthusiastic admirer of La Fontaine: and he has spent  a vast sum in having printed _one copy_ only, and for himself alone, of  an edition of his works, illustrated by the first artists of the day,  accompanied by notes and prefaces of the most eminent writers, and  forming a very miracle of expensive and _recherche_ typography and  binding. Dibdin had never so good a subject for his _Bibliomania_.           *       *       *       *       *    Jules Sandeau, one of the most _spirituel_ and elegant of French romance  writers, announced a new novel, _Catherine_, to appear on the 15th of  April.           *       *       *       *       *    Another book on the _Fall of Louis Philippe_ has been published at Paris  by M. Francois de Groiseillez. It is in the Orleanist interest, and is  praised by the _Journal des Debats_.           *       *       *       *       *    The most profligate woman of whom we have any account in Roman history  was the empress Massalina, and nothing is more natural than that she  should be selected for a heroin by a Frenchman. In a new five act play  of which the Parisian journals give us elaborate criticisms, she is  represented as a very virtuous wife, by the ingenious contrivance of  giving a certain courtezan such a striking personal resemblance to her  that it was impossible to distinguish between the two, and making the  courtezan commit all the atrocities of the real Massalina. The play is  not without literary merit. It is called _Valeria_--the heroine's  _other_ name being considered too strong to figure on a play-bill.  Rachel plays the two characters of Massalina and the courtezan--of  course with the most perfect success.           *       *       *       *       *    A new Review has been established in Paris under the title of _La  Politique Nouvelle_. It comes out as the rival of the _Revue des Deux  Mondes_, and as the champion of the new republican _regime_ (as opposed  to the conservative tendencies of the older established Review), offers  battle with a promising array of names of future contributors. The  department of English criticism is confided to M. Leon de Wailly, author  of _Stella and Vanessa_ and the translator of Burns; whose name promises  a knowledge and intelligent appreciation of English literature. The  first two numbers contain contributions from the brilliant and caustic  pen of Eugene Pelletan, and a serial from Madame Charles Reybaud, author  of the _Cadet de Calubrieres, Helene, &c_.           *       *       *       *       *    Victor Hugo, since the appearance of the last volume of _Le Rhine_, four  or five years ago, has not printed a new book. The proprietor of his  copyrights, who had brought out two splendid editions of his complete  works, one in twenty-five volumes, and another, illustrated by the best  artists of France, in twelve, made a contract with him by which he has  been prevented from any original publications. The term is now nearly  expired, and it is announced that he will at once issue three volumes of  poetry, and twelve of romances. He is now engaged in finishing a novel  entitled _Misery_, which is spoken of by those who have seen portions of  it as a magnificent work.           *       *       *       *       *    M. de St. Beuve, since October, 1849, the literary critic of _Le  Constitutionnel_, a writer who has pushed himself up in the world far  ahead of his merits, has published at Paris a volume, _Causeries du  Lundi_ (Monday Gossipings), which is no great things. These gossipings  are taken from the columns of that journal, where they are regularly  published on Mondays, and where we have occasionally had the benefit of  seeing them. If they were not written by a member of the French Academy,  and an eminent _litterateur_, we should say they were rather stupid, as  far as ideas go, and not very elegant in respect of style.           *       *       *       *       *    We had recently the _Cooks of Paris_, in a handsome volume, with  portraits; _The Journals and Editors of Paris_, in another volume, and  now one Paul Lacroix, sometimes called _bibliophile Jacob_, has  announced a _History_, _Political_, _Civil_, _Religious_, _Military_,  _Legislative_, _Judicial_, _Moral_, _Literary_, _and Anecdotic_, _of the  Shoe and the Bootmakers of France_. He treats of the ancient  corporations, their discipline, regulations, and of the fraternities,  with their obligations and devices, sketching the whole history of _La  Chaussure_. Shoemakers have been well represented among the famous men  of all nations, and the craft may be proud of Hans Sachs, Jacob Boehme,  Gifford, Bloomfield, Drew, Holcraft, Lackington, Sherman, William Carey,  George Fox, and a hundred others, besides the heroes of Monsieur  Lacroix.           *       *       *       *       *    _Bibliophile Jacob_ LACROIX, we see by the Paris papers, has also  discovered a _comedie-ballet_ by Moliere, written in 1654, and never  included in any edition of his works. It is entitled _Le Ballet des  incompatibies_, and appears to have been written by order of the Prince  de Conti, and acted before him by Moliere himself and other persons of  the Prince's circle. That it remained so long unknown is explained by  the circumstance of a few copies only having been printed for the  favored spectators. The plot is described as ingenious, and the verses  not unworthy of the author. It is known that when the Prince de Conti  presided over the states of Languedoc in 1654, he invited thither  Moliere and his company. He professed so much admiration for the actor  that he offered him the confidential situation of secretary, which was  declined; but it seems natural enough that he should have shown his  gratitude by composing one of those entertainments which cost him so  little trouble. This Prince de Conti was at one time so passionately  fond of theatricals that he made it his occupation to seek out subjects  for new plays, but at a later period he wrote a treatise in which  theatres were severely condemned on religious grounds, and Moliere  himself was personally and violently attacked.           *       *       *       *       *    Among the new biographical works announced in Paris, is one on the Life,  Virtues and Labors of the late Right Rev. Dr. FLAGET, Roman Catholic  Bishop of Bardstown and Louisville, Kentucky. The author is a clergyman,  who accompanied the late Bishop in one of his last missions to Europe.  Bishop Flaget died at the age of eighty-seven.           *       *       *       *       *    M. Xavier Marmier, whose visit to the United States we noticed some  months ago, has published his _Letters on Canada, the United States,  Cuba, and Rio La Plata_, in two volumes--constituting one of the most  agreeable works ever published in Paris upon this country. We shall  soon, we believe, have occasion to review a translation of the Letters,  by a New-Yorker.           *       *       *       *       *    Guizot and Thiers--the most eminent living statesmen of France, as well  as her greatest living historians--were for a long time connected with  the Paris journals, and each made his first appearance as a writer in  criticisms on the Fine Arts. For several years the former published  series of articles on the exhibitions of the Louvre, which were  remarkable both for artistic knowledge and literary _verve_. The latter  also published in 1810 a pamphlet on the exhibition in the Louvre, which  excited great sensation--more, however, from its having a political  tendency than for its critical importance.           *       *       *       *       *    MR. MIGNET, whose condensed _History of the French Revolution_ is best  known to American readers in the cheap reprint of Bohn's Library, and  which in Paris has passed through numberless editions--will soon have  completed his History of Mary Stuart, which is destined, probably, to  supersede every other in the French language. Mignet is perpetual  Secretary of the Academy of Moral Sciences, and was for many years head  of the department of Archives in the Foreign Office. As a man of letters  and a sedulous inquirer, no French author enjoys higher reputation.           *       *       *       *       *    Lamartine has just published in Paris _The History of the Restoration,  from 1814 to_ 1830, in eight volumes. The work has been composed  hastily, and probably by several hands, for "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29270"],[0,"The Story of the Great War, Volume 2 (#15)"],[1,"e. Worn out by repeated  repulses, the Germans had suffered too heavily to continue their attacks  or to engage in an energetic pursuit. According to General French's  estimate, the British losses during the trying period from August 23 to  August 26, 1914, inclusive, were between 5,000 and 6,000 men and the  losses suffered by the Germans in their pursuit and attacks across the  open country, owing largely to their dense formation, were much greater.  The Battle of Le Cateau gave the Germans pause. Further retreat of the  British could now be resumed in orderly array; for by now General Sordet  with his cavalry was relieving the pressure on the British rear, and  General D'Amade with his two reserve divisions from the neighborhood of  Arras was attacking General von Kluck's right, driving it back on  Cambrai. Disaster to the British forces was averted, though the peril of  German interposition between the Allied army and Paris would soon compel  still further withdrawals.    Covered by their gunners, but still under heavy fire of the German  artillery, the British began again to retire southward. Their retreat  was continued far into the night of August 26, 1914, and through the  27th and 28th; on the last date--after vigorous cavalry fighting--the  exhausted troops halted on a line extending from the French cathedral  town of Noyon through Chauny to La Fere. There they were joined by  reenforcements amounting to double their loss. Guns to replace those  captured or shattered by the enemy were brought up to the new line.  There was a breathing space for a day, while the British made ready to  take part in the next great encounter.    This fourth week in August marked a decisive period in the history of  the Great War. All the French armies, from the east to the west, as well  as the British army, were in retreat over their frontiers. To what  resolution had the French commander in chief come? That was the question  on every lip. What at that moment was the real situation of the French  army? Certainly the first engagements had not turned out as well as the  French could have hoped. The Germans were reaping the reward of their  magnificent preparation for the war. Their heavy artillery, with which  the French army was almost entirely unprovided, was giving proof of its  efficacy and its worth. The moral effect of those great projectiles  launched from great distances by the immense German guns was  considerable. At such great distances the French cannons of 75,  admirable as they were, could make no effective reply to the German  batteries. The French soldiers were perfectly well aware that they were  the targets of the great German shells while their own cannon could make  no parallel impression on the enemy.    The German army revealed itself as an extraordinary instrument of war.  Its mobility and accouterments were perfect. It had over a hundred  thousand professional noncommissioned officers or subofficers, admirably  suited to their work, with their men marching under the control of their  eye and finger. In the German army the active corps, as well as the  reserve corps, showed themselves, thanks to these noncommissioned  officers, marvelously equipped.    In the French army the number of noncommissioned officers by profession  totaled hardly half the German figures. The German army, moreover, was  much more abundantly supplied with machine guns than the French. The  Germans had almost twice as many, and they understood how to use them in  defense and attack better than the French. They had moreover, to a  degree far superior to that of the French, studied the use of  fortifications in the field, trenches, wire entanglements, and so on.  The Germans were also at first better trained than the French  reservists; they had spent longer periods in the German army, and their  reserve corps were almost equal to the active corps.    In the French army, on the other hand, an apprenticeship and training of  several weeks were required to give to the divisions of reserve their  full worth. At the end of two weeks, nevertheless, thanks to the  marvelous elasticity of the French soldier and the warlike qualities of  the race, the training was completed. At the beginning of the month of  September the reserve divisions fought with the same skill, the same  keenness, and the same swing as the active army corps.    Moreover, certain incompetencies had revealed themselves in the French  high command. These General Joffre attended to without the loss of an  instant. Every general that appeared to him incapable of fulfilling the  task allotted to him was weeded out on the spot, without considering  friendships or the bonds of comradeship, or intimacy that might be  between them.    As things were seen in Paris, all may be summed up in this formula: That  the German army was better prepared for war than the French army, for  the simple reason that Germany had long prepared for the war, because  she had it in view, a thing which could not be said of France. But the  French army revealed right from the beginning the most admirable and  marvelous qualities. The soldiers fought with a skill and heroism that  have never been equaled. Sometimes, indeed, their enthusiasm and courage  carried them too far. It mattered little. In spite of losses, in spite  even of retreat, the morale of the whole French army on the entire front  from Alsace to the Somme remained extraordinarily high.    The violation of Belgian neutrality and the passage of the German armies  through Belgium had been foreseen by the French General Staff, but  opinions differed in regard to the breadth of the turning movement  likely to be made by the German right wing in crossing Belgian  territory. Among French experts some were of opinion that the Germans  would confine themselves to the right bank of the Meuse, while others  thought that they would cross the Meuse, and make a much vaster turning  movement, thus descending on France in a direction due north and south.    If the violation of Belgian neutrality was no surprise to the French  Staff, it was nevertheless hardly expected that the Germans would be  able to put in line with such rapidity at the outset all their reserve  formations. Each army corps was supported by its reserve corps, which  showed itself as quick in mobilization and preparation as the active  corps.    Germany, while maintaining sufficient forces on the Russian front, was  still able to put in the field for its great offensive against France a  more numerous body of troops than would have been believed in France.  This permitted them to maintain in Alsace, in Lorraine, and in Belgian  Luxembourg armies as numerous as those which faced them on the French  side, and at the same time to mass the major part of their troops on the  right so as to pour into the valley of the Oise their chief invading  forces.    This explains why the French left, which was exposed to the offensive of  the German right, was obliged to make a rapid retreat, permitting the  German armies of General von Kluck and General von Buelow to advance with  all speed in the direction of Paris.    The French military staff, as soon as they perceived the danger that  threatened, proceeded to a new alignment of forces. As long as this  alignment of forces could not be effected the retreat had to continue.  As soon as it was accomplished, as soon as General Joffre had his armies  well in hand and the situation of his troops well disposed, he checked  the retreat, gave the signal for the offensive, and so followed the  great Battle of the Marne.    The German plan consisted, therefore, in delivering the main blow  through the medium of the right wing of the German forces, consisting of  the army of Von Kluck, the army of Von Buelow, and the army of Von  Hausen, which were to march with all speed in the direction of Paris.    What plan had the French staff in mind to oppose to this plan of the  Germans? Its plan aimed at checking and holding the greatest possible  number of Germans by a vigorous offensive in Alsace and Lorraine so as  to prevent them from joining the three first German armies which  threatened Paris. In support of this offensive of the armies of Alsace  and Lorraine, the central French armies attacked in the direction of the  Ardennes and Belgian Luxembourg with the object of checking the center  of the German armies and then turning toward the west so as to cooperate  in the offensive of the French forces which, aided by the British army  and the Belgian army, were fighting in Belgium.    The French armies, which are numbered from the right to the left--that  is, from the east to the west--comprised: A detachment of the Army of  Alsace that was dissolved toward the end of the month of August; the  First Army (General Dubail); the Second Army (General de Castelnau); the  Third Army (General Ruffey, replaced at the end of August, 1914, by  General Sarrail); the Fourth Army (General de Langle de Cary); the  Fifth Army (General Lanrezac, replaced in the last days of August, 1914,  by General Franchet d'Esperey). At the right of this army was stationed  the British army under the command of General French.    To what resolution did General Joffre come? On that memorable evening of  the 24th, and on that morning of the 25th, two alternatives presented  themselves before him. Should they, rather than permit the enemy to  invade the soil of France, make a supreme effort to check the Germans on  the frontier?    This first apparent solution had the evident advantage of abandoning to  the enemy no part of the national soil, but it had some serious  inconveniences. The attack of the German armies operating on the right  (Generals von Kluck, von Buelow, von Hausen) were extremely menacing. In  order to parry this attack it was necessary considerably to reenforce  the French left, and for that purpose to transfer from the right to the  left a certain number of army corps. "]]]
