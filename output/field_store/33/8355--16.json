Short of turning about and fighting their way  through about a quarter of the aroused Yankee army, the fugitives did  have to cross the Cumberland and the Tennessee, and do both soon.    \"The Cumberland, suh, is not apt to give you much trouble.\" Pryor sipped  at his glass with a relish. \"If, of course, you contemplate a try at the  Tennessee--that will be a different matter. I trust your commander will  be amply prepared for difficulties there. But General Morgan is not to  be easily caught napping, or so his reputation stands. I wish you the  best of luck.\"    \"Is that your horse out there, young man?\" the proprietor of the  drugstore addressed Drew. \"That big stallion?\"    Drew put his glass on the counter and spun around. \"What's he doin'  now?\"    \"Nothing,\" Hale returned quickly. \"Ransome!\" Out of nowhere Hale's  servant appeared. \"Get the saddlebags from that horse.\"    Surprised at this highhanded demand for his property, Drew waited for  enlightenment. When Ransome returned with the bags, Hale took them,  moved quickly to a cabinet, and unlocked it. By handfulls he took small  boxes from the shelves inside, added some paper packets, and then  buckled the straps tightly over the new bulge.    \"I understand,\" he said in his dry, precise voice, \"there is a pressing  need for quinine, morphine, and the like in the South?\"    Drew could only nod as Hale held out the bags.    \"Give this to your surgeon, young man, with my compliments. There is  little enough we can do, but this is something.\"    Drew stammered his thanks, knowing that those boxes and packets crammed  into his bags meant a fortune to a blockade runner, but far more to men  in the improvised hospitals behind the gray lines. Hale waved away  Drew's thanks, adding only a last warning: \"Keep your bags dry if you  contemplate a river crossing! I would like to make sure that those drugs  do reach the right hands intact.\"    \"Rennie!\" Hart hailed him from the door. \"There's a boy here with a  mule; he says it's for you.\"    Pryor put down his glass. \"It's Hannibal. I think you will find him  acceptable, suh. An even-tempered animal for the most part, and the  surest-footed one I have ever ridden.\"    \"Then you do _ride_ him?\" Boyd spoke for the first time.    \"Naturally he has been ridden--by me. I would not offer him otherwise,  suh!\" Pryor's flash of indignation was quick. \"Hannibal's dam was Dido,  a fine trotting mare. He's an excellent mount.\"    The mule stood in the street, ears slightly forward, eyeing King warily.  He was a big animal, groomed until his gray coat shone under the sun,  wearing a well rubbed and oiled saddle and trappings. As Drew approached  he lowered his head, sniffing inquiringly at the scout.    \"Your new master, Hannibal,\" Pryor addressed the animal with the gravity  of one making a formal introduction. \"You are about to be mustered into  the cavalry.\"    Hannibal appeared to consider this and then shook his big head up and  down in a vigorous nod. Boyd laughed and Kirby offered vocal  encouragement.    \"Mount up an' see if you have to go smoothin' out any humps.\"    \"If you're goin' to ride that critter, git on!\" Hart called. His tone  expressed urgency as if he had learned something in town which should  send them out of Cadiz in a hurry.    Drew's previous experience with mules had not been as a rider. He had  heard plenty about their sure-footedness, their ability to keep going as  pack animals and wagon teams when horses gave out, their intelligence,  as well as that stubbornness which lay on the darker side of the scales.  He advanced on Hannibal now a little distrustfully, settling into the  saddle on the animal's back with the care of one expecting some  unpleasant reaction. But Hannibal merely swung his head about as if to  make sure by sight, as well as pressure of weight on his back, that his  rider was safely aloft.    Relaxing, Drew saluted Pryor. \"My thanks to you, suh.\"    \"Think nothing of it, young man. Luck to you--all of you.\"    \"That we can use, suh,\" Kirby returned. \"Adios....\"    Hart's impatience was so patent that Drew had only hasty thanks for Hale  before the trooper had them on their way out of town. When they were at  a trot Kirby joined their guide.    \"How come you workin' on your critter's rump with a double of rope? Git  sight of some blue belly hangin' out to dry-gulch us?\"    \"We ain't too welcome hereabouts.\" Hart did look worried, and Drew was  alert.    \"Yankees?\" he asked.    Hart shook his head. \"Just some of the boys; they don't want no  attention pulled this way, not right now.\"    The bank money--and the guerrillas. Yes, holding up the Cadiz bank if  and when any gold reached there, would appeal to the local irregulars,  who might be so irregular as to be on the cold side of the law, even in  wartime with the enemy their victim. Drew fitted one piece to another  and thought he could guess the full pattern.    Kirby looked from one to the other. Boyd was completely at a loss. A  moment later the Texan spoke again.    \"Me, I'm never one to argue with local talent, specially if they wear  their Colts low and loose. Doin' that is apt to make a man wolf meat.  Wheah to now--this heah river?\"    Drew nodded. The Cumberland must be scouted. And, after that, the more  formidable barrier of the Tennessee. He had not needed Pryor's warning  about the latter. Ever since they had left Bardstown and knew they were  headed for that barrier, Drew had been carrying worry at the back of his  mind.    But Pryor was also right about the Cumberland. Hart agreed to ride back  to the company with the information to direct them to the best crossing.  While Drew, Kirby, and Boyd went on to the last barrier between them and  eventual escape southwest.    Here the Tennessee was a flood, a narrow lake more than a river. As they  traveled its eastern bank Boyd halted now and again to study the waste  of water dubiously.    \"It's wide,\" he said in a subdued voice. Kirby spat accurately at a leaf  drifting just below.    \"Need us some fish fixin's heah,\" he agreed. \"You swim?\" he asked the  other two.    There had been ponds at home where both of them in childhood had paddled  about with most of the young male populations of Red Springs and Oak  Hill. But whether they could trust that somewhat limited skill to get  them over this flood was another matter.    \"Some.\" Boyd appeared to have discovered caution.    \"Me, I'm not sayin' yet,\" Kirby commented. \"Splashin' 'round some in a  little-bitty wadin' pool, an' gittin' out in this, don't balance none.  Ain't every hoss takes kindly to water, neither. I'd say we'd better see  what's the chances of knockin' together a raft or somethin'. 'Less we  can find us a boat.\"    But boats were not to be found, unless they were willing to risk  discovery by trying to cross near a well-settled district. And when  Captain Campbell joined them that afternoon he insisted on the need of  speed over a longer reconnaissance.    \"The Yankees are closing in,\" he told the trio by the river. \"If we try  to cross at a town, they'll have a point to center on. Rafts, yes, we  can try to build rafts--have to ferry over the men who can't swim, and  our gear. This is the time we must push--fast.\"    The remote section of bank which Drew had chosen became a scene of  activity as the company came in--a tight bunch--not long after Campbell.  The stragglers came later, pushing beat-out horses, one or two riding  double. They had no tools other than bowie knives, and their attempts at  raft-building were not only awkward but in the most cases futile. When  they did have a mat which would stick together after a fashion, they  were determined to put it to the test at once.    None of them had much practice in getting horses over such a wide body  of water, and there were a great many freely voiced suggestions  concerning the best methods.    Kirby stood watching the first attempt, his face blank of expression, a  sign Drew had come to recognize as the Texan's withdrawal from a  situation or action of which he did not approve. There were five men  squeezed together on the flimsy-looking raft and they had strung out  their mounts in a line, the head of one horse linked by leading rope to  the tail of the one before him.    \"You don't think it's goin' to work?\" Drew asked Kirby.    The Texan shrugged. \"Maybe, only hosses don't think like men. An' a  lotta hosses don't take kindly to gittin' wheah theah ain't no footin'.  Me, I want to see a little more, 'fore I roll out--\"    Kirby's misgivings were amply justified. For that first voyage was  doomed to a tragic and speedy end. The second horse in line, losing  footing as the river bed fell away beneath him, reared in fright, caught  his forefeet over the rope linking him to his fellow, and so jerked his  head underwater by his own frenzied struggles. Before the men on the  wildly dipping raft were able to cut the now fright-maddened animals  loose, three in that string had drowned themselves by their uncontrolled  plunges, and the others were being dragged under.    Boyd dived from the upper bank before Drew could stop him. It was  madness to go anywhere near the struggling horses. But somehow Boyd's  blond head broke water at the side of the last gasping animal. He took a  grip on the water-logged mane, his body bobbing up and down with the  jerks of the horse's forequarters, until he had sawed through the lead  cord and was able to start the mount back toward the shore, swimming  beside him.    Drew was waiting with Kirby to give Boyd a hand up the bank.    \"You could have been pulled under!\"    Boyd was grinning. \"But I wasn't. And the horse's all right, too.\" He  patted the wet haunch of the shivering animal. \"That was bad--they  pulled each other down.\"    It was a disheartening beginning. But as the hours slipped by they had  better success. One "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23626"],[0,"The Chemistry, Properties and Tests of Precious Stones (#15)"],[1,"creatures were not the  Egyptian cat, but a carniverous, long-bodied animal, after the shape of  a weasel, called \"marten,\" of the species the \"beech\" or \"common\" marten  (_mustela foina_), found also in Britain to-day. It is also interesting  to note that the various superstitions existing with regard to the  different varieties and colours of cats also exist in an identical  manner with the corresponding colours of the minerals known as \"cat's  eye.\"    Several varieties of cat's-eye have already been described. Another  important variety is that of the chrysoberyl called \"cymophane.\" This is  composed of glucina, which is glucinum oxide, or beryllia, BeO, of which  there is 19.8 per cent., and alumina, or aluminium oxide, Al_{2}O_{3},  of which there is 80.2 per cent. It has, therefore, the chemical  formula, BeO,Al_{2}O_{3}. This stone shows positive electricity when  rubbed, and, unlike the sapphires described in the last chapter, which  lose their colour when heated, this variety of chrysoberyl shows no  change in colour, and any electricity given to it, either by friction or  heat, is retained for a long time. When heated in the blowpipe alone it  remains unaltered, that is, it is not fusible, and even with microcosmic  salt it requires a considerably long and fierce heat before it yields  and fuses, and acids do not act upon it. It crystallises in the 4th  (rhombic) system, and its lustre is vitreous.    The cymophane shows a number of varieties, quite as many as the  chrysoberyl, of which it is itself a variety, and these go through the  gamut of greens, from a pale white green to the stronger green of  asparagus, and through both the grey and yellow greens to dark. It is  found in Ceylon, Moravia, the Ural Mountains, Brazil, North America,  and elsewhere. The cat's-eye of this is very similar to the quartz  cat's-eye, but a comparison will make the difference so clear that they  could never be mistaken, apart from the fact that the quartz has a  specific gravity considerably lower than the chrysoberyl cat's-eye,  which latter is the true cat's-eye, and the one usually understood when  allusion is made to the stone without any distinguishing prefix, such as  the ruby, sapphire, quartz, etc., cat's eye. It should, however, be  mentioned that this stone is referred to when the names Ceylonese and  Oriental cat's-eye are given, which names are used in the trade as well  as the simple appellation, \"cat's eye.\" One peculiarity of some of these  stones is that the \"fire\" or \"glow\" is usually altered in colour by the  colour of the light under which it is seen, the change of colour being  generally the complementary. Thus, a stone which in one light shows red,  in another will be green; the \"eye\" showing blue in one light will  become orange in another; whilst the yellow of another stone may show a  decided purple or amethyst in a different light.    A good test for this, and indeed most precious stones, is that they  conduct heat more quickly than does glass, and with such rapidity that  on breathing upon a stone the warmth is conducted instantly, so that,  though the stone is dimmed the dimness vanishes at once, whereas with  glass the film of moisture fades but slowly in comparison.      _The Topaz._    The name topaz is derived from the Greek _topazos_, which is the name of  a small island situated in the Gulf of Arabia, from whence the Romans  obtained a mineral which they called topazos and topazion, which mineral  to-day is termed chrysolite. The mineral topaz is found in Cornwall and  in the British Isles generally; also in Siberia, India, South America  and many other localities, some of the finest stones coming from Saxony,  Bohemia, and Brazil, especially the last-named. The cleavage is perfect  and parallel to the basal plane. It crystallises in the 4th (rhombic)  system; in lustre it is vitreous; it is transparent, or ranging from  that to translucent; the streak is white or colourless. Its colour  varies very much--some stones are straw-colour, some are grey, white,  blue, green, and orange. A very favourite colour is the pink, but in  most cases this colour is not natural to the stone, but is the result of  \"burning,\" or \"pinking\" as the process is called technically, which  process is to raise the temperature of a yellow stone till the yellow  tint turns to a pink of the colour desired. The topaz is harder than  quartz, as will be seen on reference to the \"Hardness\" table, and is  composed of a silicate of aluminium, fluorine taking the place of some  of the oxygen. Its composition averages 16.25 per cent. of silica, 55.75  per cent. of alumina, or oxide of aluminium, and fluoride of silicium,  28 per cent. Its formula is [Al(F,OH)]_{2} SiO_{4}, or (AlF)_{2}SiO_{4}.  From this it will be understood that the fluorine will be evolved when  the stone is fused. It is, however, very difficult to fuse, and alone it  is infusible under the blowpipe, but with microcosmic salt it fuses and  evolves fluorine, and the glass of the tube in the open end of which the  stone is fixed is bitten with the gas.    Such experiments with the topaz are highly interesting, and if we take a  little of the powdered stone and mix with it a small portion of the  microcosmic salt, we may apply the usual test for analysing and proving  aluminium, thus: a strongly brilliant mass is seen when hot, and if we  moisten the powder with nitrate of cobalt and heat again, this time in  the inner flame, the mass becomes blue. Other phenomena are seen during  the influence of heat. Some stones, as stated, become pink on heating,  but if the heating is continued too long, or too strongly, the stone is  decoloured. Others, again, suffer no change, and this has led to a  slight difference of opinion amongst chemists as to whether the colour  is due to inorganic or organic matter. Heating also produces  electricity, and the stone, and even splinters of it, will give out a  curious phosphorescent light, which is sometimes yellow, sometimes blue,  or green. Friction or pressure produces strong electrification; thus the  stones may be electrified by shaking a few together in a bag, or by the  tumbling of the powdered stone-grains over each other as they roll down  a short inclined plane. The stones are usually found in the primitive  rocks, varying somewhat in different localities in their colour; many of  the Brazilian stones, when cut as diamonds, are not unlike them.    In testing, besides those qualities already enumerated, the crystalline  structure is specially perfect and unmistakable. It is doubly  refractive, whereas spinel and the diamond, which two it closely  resembles, are singly refractive. Topaz is readily electrified, and, if  perfect at terminals, becomes polarised; also the commercial solution  of violets, of which a drop only need be taken for test, is turned green  by adding to it a few grains of topaz dust, or of a little splinter  crushed to fine powder.      _The Beryl._    The beryl is a compound of silicates of beryllia and alumina, with the  formula 3BeOSiO_{2} + Al_{2}O_{3},3SiO_{2}, or  3BeO,Al_{2}O_{3},6SiO_{2}. It differs very little indeed from the  emerald, with the exception of its colour. In the ordinary varieties  this is somewhat poor, being mostly blue, or a dirty or a greenish  yellow; the better kinds, however, possess magnificent colour and  variety, such as in the aquamarine, emerald, etc. The cleavage is  parallel to the basal plane. Its lustre is sometimes resinous, sometimes  vitreous, and it crystallises in the 2nd (hexagonal) system. It occurs  in somewhat long, hexagonal prisms, with smooth, truncated planes, and  is often found in granite and the silt brought down by rivers from  granite, gneiss, and similar rocks. It is found in Great Britain and in  many parts of Europe, Asia, and America, in crystals of all sizes, from  small to the weight of several tons. The common kinds are too opaque and  colourless to be used as gems and are somewhat difficult of fusion under  the blowpipe, on the application of which heat some stones lose their  colour altogether, others partly; others, which before heating were  somewhat transparent, become clouded and opaque; others suffer no change  in colour, whilst some are improved. In almost every case a slight  fusion is seen on the sharp edges of fractures, which become smooth,  lose their sharpness, and have the appearance of partly fused glass.  The hardness varies from 7-1/4 to 8, the crystals being very brittle,  breaking with a fracture of great unevenness. The better varieties are  transparent, varying from that to translucent, and are called the  \"noble\" beryls. Transparent beryl crystals are used by fortune-tellers  as \"gazing stones,\" in which they claim to see visions of future events.      _The Emerald._    Considering the particular emerald which is a variety of beryl--although  the name emerald in the trade is applied somewhat loosely to any stone  which is of the same colour, or approaching the colour of the beryl  variety--this emerald only differs chemically from the beryl, just  described, in possessing an addition of oxide of chromium. In shape,  crystallisation, fracture and hardness, it is the same, and often  contains, in addition to the chromium, the further addition of traces of  carbonate of lime, magnesia, and occasionally faint traces of hornblende  and mica, which evidently result from its intimate association with the  granite rock and gneiss, amongst which it is mostly found, the latter  rocks being of a slaty nature, in layers or plates, and, like granite,  containing mica, pyrites, felspar, quartz, etc.    Emeralds have been known from very early times, and are supposed to have  been found first in the mines of ancient Egypt. They were considered  amongst the rarest and the most costly of gems, and it was the custom,  when conferring lavish honour, to engrave or model emeralds for  presentation purposes. Thus we find"]]]
