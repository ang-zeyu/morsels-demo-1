In winter Jerry spends much of his time in this house,  going out only for food.  Then he lives chiefly on lily roots and  roots of other water plants, digging them up and taking them back  to his house to eat.  When the ice is clear you can sometimes see  him swimming below.\"    \"I know,\" spoke up Peter Rabbit.  \"Once I was crossing the Smiling  Pool on the ice and saw him right under me.\"    \"Jerry doesn't build dams, but he sometimes digs little canals  along the bottom where the water isn't deep enough to suit him,\"  continued Old Mother Nature.  \"Sometimes in the winter Jerry and  Mrs. Jerry share their home with two or three friends.  If there  is a good bank Jerry usually has another home in that.  He makes  the entrance under water and then tunnels back and up for some  distance, where he builds a snug little bedroom just below the  surface of the ground where it is dry.  Usually he has more than  one tunnel leading to this, and sometimes an opening from above.  This is covered with sticks and grass to hide it, and provides  an entrance for fresh air.    \"Jerry lives mostly on roots and plants, but is fond of mussels or  fresh-water clams, fish, some insects and, I am sorry to say, young  birds when he can catch them.  Jerry could explain where some of  the babies of Mr. And Mrs. Quack the Ducks have disappeared to.  Paddy the Beaver doesn't eat flesh at all.    \"Jerry and Mrs. Jerry have several families in a year, and Jerry  is a very good father, doing his share in caring for the babies.  He and Mrs. Jerry are rather social and enjoy visiting neighbors  of their own kind.  Their voices are a sort of squeak, and you can  often hear them talking among the rushes in the early evening.  That is the hour they like best, though they are abroad during the  day when undisturbed.  Man is their greatest enemy.  He hunts and  traps them for their warm coats.  But they have to watch out for  Hooty the Owl at night and for Reddy Fox and Old Man Coyote whenever  they are on land.  Billy Mink also is an enemy at times, perhaps  the most to be dreaded because he can follow Jerry anywhere.    \"Jerry makes little landings of mud and rushes along the edge of  the shore.  On these he delights to sit to eat his meals.  He likes  apples and vegetables and sometimes will travel quite a distance to  get them.  Late in the summer he begins to prepare for winter by  starting work on his house, if he is to have a new one.  He is a  good worker.  There isn't a lazy bone in him.  All things considered,  Jerry is a credit to his family.    \"But if Jerry is a credit to his family there is one of its members  who is not and that is--who knows?\"    \"Robber the Brown Rat,\" replied Happy Jack Squirrel promptly.  \"I  have often seen him around Farmer Brown's barn.  Ugh!  He is an  ugly-looking fellow.\"    \"And he is just as ugly as he looks,\" replied Old Mother Nature.  \"There isn't a good thing I can say for him, not one.  He doesn't  belong in this country at all.  He was brought here by man, and  now he is found everywhere.  He is sometimes called the Norway Rat  and sometimes the Wharf Rat and House Rat.  He is hated by all  animals and by man.  He is big, being next in size to Jerry  Muskrat, savage in temper, the most destructive of any animal I  know, and dirty in his habits.  He is an outcast, but he doesn't  seem to care.    \"He lives chiefly around the homes of men, and all his food is  stolen.  That is why he is named Robber.  He eats anything he can  find and isn't the least bit particular what it is or whether it  be clean or unclean.  He gnaws into grain bins and steals the  grain.  He gets into hen-houses and sucks the eggs and kills young  chickens.  He would like nothing better than to find a nest of  your babies, Peter Rabbit.\"    Peter shivered.  \"I'm glad he sticks to the homes of men,\" said he.    \"But he doesn't,\" declared Old Mother Nature.  \"Often in summer he  moves out into the fields, digging burrows there and doing great  damage to crops and also killing and eating any of the furred and  feathered folk he can catch.  But he is not fond of the light of  day.  His deeds are deeds of darkness, and he prefers dark places.  He has very large families, sometimes ten or more babies at a time,  and several families in a year.  That is why his tribe has managed  to overrun the Great World and why they cause such great damage.  Worse than the harm they do with their teeth is the terrible harm  they do to man by carrying dreadful diseases and spreading them--  diseases which cause people to die in great numbers.\"    \"Isn't Robber afraid of any one?\" asked Peter.    \"He certainly is,\" replied Old Mother Nature.  \"He is in deadly fear  of one whom every one of you fears--Shadow the Weasel.  One good  thing I can say for Shadow is that he never misses a chance to kill  a Rat.  Wherever a Rat can go he can go, and once he finds a colony  he hunts them until he has killed all or driven them away.    \"When food becomes scarce, Robber and his family move on to where  it is more plentiful.  Often they make long journeys, a great  number of them together, and do not hesitate to swim a stream that  may be in their path.\"    \"I've never seen Robber,\" said Peter.  \"What kind of a tail does  he have?\"    \"I might have known you would ask that,\" laughed Old Mother Nature.  \"It is long and slim and has no hair on it.  His fur is very coarse  and harsh and is brown and gray.  He has a close relative called  the Black Rat.  But the latter is smaller and has been largely  driven out of the country by his bigger cousin.  Now I guess this  is enough about Robber.  He is bad, all bad, and hasn't a single  friend in all the Great World.\"    \"What a dreadful thing--not to have a single friend,\" said  Happy Jack.    \"It is dreadful, very dreadful,\" replied Old Mother Nature.  \"But  it is wholly his own fault.  It shows what happens when one becomes  dishonest and bad at heart.  The worst of it is Robber doesn't care.  To-morrow I'll tell you about some of his cousins who are not bad.\"        CHAPTER XIV  A Trader and a Handsome Fellow    \"Way down in the Sunny South,\" began Old Mother Nature, \"lives a  member of the Rat family who, though not nearly so bad as Robber,  is none too good and so isn't thought well of at all.  He is  Little Robber the Cotton Rat, and though small for a Rat, being  only a trifle larger than Striped Chipmunk, looks the little  savage that he is.  He has short legs and is rather thick-bodied,  and appears much like an overgrown Meadow Mouse with a long tail.  The latter is not bare like Robber's, but the hair on it is very  short and thin.  In color he is yellowish-brown and whitish  underneath.  His fur is longer and coarser than that of other  native Rats.    \"He lives in old fields, along ditches and hedges, and in similar  places where there is plenty of cover in which he can hide from  his enemies.  He burrows in the ground and usually has his nest of  dry grass there, though often in summer it is the surface of the  ground.  He does not live in and around the homes of men, like the  Brown Rat, but he causes a great deal of damage by stealing grain  in the shock.  He eats all kinds of grain, many seeds, and meat  when he can get it.  He is very destructive to eggs and young of  ground-nesting birds.  He has a bad temper and will fight savagely.  Mr. and Mrs. Cotton Rat raise several large families in a year.  Foxes, Owls and Hawks are their chief enemies.    \"But there are other members of the Rat family far more interesting  and quite worth knowing.  One of these is Trader the Wood Rat, in  some parts of the Far West called the Pack Rat.  Among the mountains  he is called the Mountain Rat.  Wherever found, his habits are much  the same and make him one of the most interesting of all the little  people who wear fur.    \"Next to Jerry Muskrat he is the largest native Rat, that is, of  the Rats which belong in this country.  He is about two thirds as  big as Robber the Brown Rat, but though he is of the same general  shape, so that you would know at once that he is related to Robber,  he is in all other ways wholly unlike that outcast.  His fur is  thick and soft, almost as soft as that of a Squirrel.  His fairly  long tail is covered with hair.  Indeed, some members of his branch  of the family have tails almost as bushy as a Squirrel's.  His coat  is soft gray and a yellowish-brown above, and underneath pure white  or light buff.  His feet are white.  He has rounded ears and big  black eyes with none of the ugliness in them that you always see in  the eyes of Robber.  And he has long whiskers and plenty of them.\"    \"But why is he called Trader?\" asked Rabbit a bit impatiently.    \"Patience, Peter, patience.  I'm coming to that,\" chided Old Mother  Nature.  \"He is Trader because his greatest delight is in trading.  He is a born trader if ever there was one.  He doesn't steal as  other members of his family but trades.  He puts something back  in place of whatever he takes.  It may be little sticks or chips  or pebbles or anything else that is handy but it is something to  replace what he has taken.  You see, he is very honest.  If Trader  finds something belonging to some one else that he wants he takes  it, but he tries to pay for it.    \"Next to trading he delights in collecting.  His home is a regular  museum.  He delights in anything bright and shiny.  When he can  get into the camps of men he will take anything he can move.  But  being honest, he tries to leave something in return.  All sorts of  queer things are found in his home--buckles cut from saddles,  spoons, knives, forks, even money he has taken from the pockets of  sleeping campers.  Whenever any small object is missed from a camp,  the first place visited in search of it is the home of Trader.

Early in this century there was a furious contest between  the two classes of religionists, which lasted for some days, and was at  last quelled by the military. During the fight every conceivable insult  was offered to each other's feelings, and lives were lost. The  Muhammadans suffered most, and since that time they seem to have been  cowed, so that there has been much less fighting between them and their  Hindu neighbours than in some other cities in the North-West.    The city has two great squares, occupied as market-places, in which  goods of every description are exhibited and sold in the Eastern  fashion. They present a stirring scene of an afternoon, which is the  principal time of business.    [Sidenote: CENSUS RETURNS.]    In the census of 1872 the occupations of all males above fifteen years  of age are noted. I give some of the items--    Alms-takers                                  184  Beggars                                    3,490  Barbers                                      979  Pundits                                       96  Priests (temple or ghat)                   2,809  Purohits (family priests)                  1,273  Servants                                  14,309    I suppose the distinction between alms-takers and beggars is that the  former class deem it beneath them to ask, but have no objection to take  alms, while the latter class both ask and take. Among the latter, beside  the blind and helpless, many able-bodied men make beggary their  profession. On one occasion, in the neighbourhood of Benares, I met a  man in the prime of life who said he had just returned from a long  journey. On referring to his business he frankly said that he had never  had any other occupation than that of a beggar. This was his hereditary  profession. We have no Poor Law in India. The people, from varied  motives, are ever ready to give aid to those who cannot support  themselves, and in addition exercise an indiscriminate charity, which  has a demoralizing effect.    The census informs us there are in Benares 16,023 masonry houses, and  21,551 mud houses--that is, houses many of which are of mud moistened  and dried as the walls rise--and others of sun-dried bricks. I do not  wonder at the disappointment felt by some who have been much impressed  with the front view of the city, and have then traversed its streets.    Till recently, from the commencement of our rule, our Government has  never been at peace with all the native rulers of India. In various ways  we have come into collision with them, and the final result in every  case has been their overthrow. The deposed rajahs have as a rule been  sent to Benares, as if our Government wished to compensate them for the  loss of their dominion by conferring on them special religious  advantages.    On the opposite side of the Ganges, a little above the southern end of  the city, is the town of Ramnuggur, with a population of 10,000. It is  the residence of the Rajah of Benares, who is simply a large landowner,  and has no authority beyond that which wealth confers. His palace, or  rather fort, is close to the river. Behind the town, close to the  Rajah's garden, there is a large tank, and a temple facing it which is  remarkable for the exquisite carving on its walls illustrative of Hindu  mythology.    [Sidenote: MACAULEY'S DESCRIPTION OF BENARES.]    I end this account of Benares by an extract from Macaulay's Essay on  Warren Hastings, in which, in his own high rhetorical fashion, which so  readily yields itself to exaggeration, he describes the city. If I  remember rightly, there is no mention in his biography of his having  visited the North-West, and his description is therefore not that of an  eye-witness.    \"The first design of Warren Hastings was on Benares, a city which in  wealth, population, dignity, and sanctity was among the foremost in  Asia. It was commonly believed that half a million of human beings was  crowded into that labyrinth of lofty alleys, rich with shrines, and  minarets, and balconies, and carved oriels, to which the sacred apes  clung by hundreds. The traveller could scarcely make his way through the  press of holy mendicants and not less holy bulls. The broad and stately  flights of steps which descended from these swarming haunts to the  bathing places along the Ganges were worn every day by the footsteps of  an innumerable multitude of worshippers. The schools and temples drew  crowds of pious Hindus from every province where the Brahmanical faith  was known. Hundreds of devotees came thither every month to die, for it  was believed that a peculiarly happy fate awaited the man who should  pass from the sacred city into the sacred river. Nor was superstition  the only motive which allured strangers to that great metropolis.  Commerce had as many pilgrims as religion. All along the shores of the  venerable stream lay great fleets of vessels laden with rich  merchandise. From the looms of Benares went forth the most delicate  silks that adorned the balls of St. James's and of Versailles; and in  the bazars the muslins of Bengal and the sabres of Oude were mingled  with the jewels of Golconda and the shawls of Cashmere.\"    [Illustration]          CHAPTER VIII.    BENARES AS A MISSION SPHERE.      Hinduism, like all other religions, has its points of contact, we may  say of agreement, with Christianity; but in its main features and  tendencies it is intensely antagonistic, and this antagonism may be  conceived to have its keenest edge and greatest force in the city from  which it has for ages maintained its sway over the millions of India. If  any religion could be considered entrenched by local advantages beyond  the possibility of overthrow, Hinduism might be declared secure at  Benares, if not against assault, at least against defeat.    People in all ages, all the world over, cling with varying degrees of  tenacity to the views and practices which have come to them from their  fathers. Jeremiah said, \"Pass over the isles of Chittim, and see; and  send unto Kedar, and consider diligently, and see if there be such a  thing. Hath a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods?\"  Hinduism in its present form is comparatively modern; but the people  generally know nothing of its history, and they regard it as an  inheritance from the most ancient times. It comes to them as the gifts  of gods and sages, which it would be sacrilege to reject. There is much  in the religion itself to bind the people to it. Its numerous  ceremonies, sustained by the largest promises, give the assurance of a  great reward. In discharging their religious duties they have often to  endure toil, undergo privation, and make sacrifices; but the more they  do and suffer, the greater is the complacency with which they regard  their religious position. There is one thing Hinduism does not demand of  its devotees. It does not demand a radical change of character or of  life. Its every requirement may be met without abandoning evil  dispositions and practices. It can be easily supposed how strong a hold  a religion like this has on its votaries, and how especially strong its  hold must be in the city where it has been enthroned for ages.    In our day much is said about heredity. Facts illustrative of its power  over the features, character, and life, not only of individuals but of  communities, are patent to all. Whatever heredity can do it does in  infusing the spirit of Hinduism into the very blood of the people of  Benares, who have been so long dominated by it. The mastery it has  obtained over them is shown by the whole tone of their minds and the  whole bearing of their life. If sincerity and enthusiasm be the  essential requisites in religion, the inhabitants of this city have all  they need, for these qualities are possessed by them in a high degree.  Then, in such a city there is felt the almost overpowering influence of  thousands from day to day, and of vast multitudes on occasion of high  festival, performing the same rites, worshipping the same gods, and  animated by the same spirit. The peculiar thrill of pleasure given by a  great assembled eager host to every individual composing it; the sense  of importance it gives to each, as if on him rested the concentrated  honour of the gathering, does much to bind people to a religion which  receives such services from millions. If for a single year these daily  services and periodical gatherings were intermitted, Hinduism would be  greatly weakened.    [Sidenote: SECULAR AND SACRED INFLUENCES.]    In addition to the domestic, social, and public influences which guard  and uphold the existing state of things, there is the tremendous power  of personal gain and honour. The honour, the wealth, the very  subsistence of large influential classes, are bound up with the  maintenance of idolatry. The Pundits, the guardians and expositors of  their sacred books; the Pundas who minister in the temples; the  Gungaputrs who serve at the river side; the Purohits, the family  priests; the Gurus, the father confessors and guides of the people; and  the Jyotishees, the astrologers, with their families and relations,  would be stripped of their honour and gain, of their very means of  living, if Hinduism was at once abandoned. Benares is a great commercial  as well as religious city. If it ceased to be Hindu, we cannot suppose  its commerce would be paralyzed; but as a considerable part of its  ordinary trade is dependent on the thousands of pilgrims who resort to  it, on the money they expend on food, on gifts to the priests, and on  the purchase of articles exposed for sale, great loss would be in the  first place incurred. The many artisans now employed in making images of  stone and brass, would find no purchasers for their goods. In addition  to the pecuniary loss which directly and indirectly would fall on all  classes, the whole community"]]]
