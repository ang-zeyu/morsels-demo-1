Her astonishment was great, then, when, having opened the letter, she  found in it bitter reproaches for her conduct, an exhortation to do  penance, and an assurance several times repeated that she should never  leave her prison. He ended his letter in announcing to her that, in  spite of his distaste for public affairs, he had been obliged to accept  the regency, which he had done less for his country than for his sister,  seeing that it was the sole means he had of standing in the way of the  ignominious trial to which the nobles wished to bring her, as author, or  at least as chief accomplice, of Darnley's death. This imprisonment was  then clearly a great good fortune for her, and she ought to thank Heaven  for it, as an alleviation of the fate awaiting her if he had not  interceded for her.    This letter was a lightning stroke for Mary: only, as she did not wish  to give her enemies the delight of seeing her suffer, she contained her  grief, and, turning to William Douglas--    \"My lord,\" said she, \"this letter contains news that you doubtless know  already, for although we are not children by the same mother, he who  writes to me is related to us in the same degree, and will not have  desired to write to his sister without writing to his brother at the  same time; besides, as a good son, he will have desired to acquaint his  mother with the unlooked-for greatness that has befallen him.\"    \"Yes, madam,\" replied William, \"we know since yesterday that, for the  welfare of Scotland, my brother has been named regent; and as he is a  son as respectful to his mother as he is devoted to his country, we hope  that he will repair the evil that for five years favourites of every  sort and kind have done to both.\"    \"It is like a good son, and at the same time like a courteous host, to  go back no farther into the history of Scotland,\" replied Mary Stuart,  \"and not to make the daughter blush for the father's errors; for I have  heard say that the evil which your lordship laments was prior to the  time to which you assign it, and that King James V. also had formerly  favourites, both male and female. It is true that they add that the ones  as ill rewarded his friendship as the others his love. In this, if you  are ignorant of it, my lord, you can be instructed, if he is still  living, by a certain Porterfeld or Porterfield, I don't know which,  understanding these names of the lower classes too ill to retain and  pronounce them, but about which, in my stead, your noble mother could  give you information.\"    With these words, Mary Stuart rose, and, leaving William Douglas crimson  with rage, she returned into her bedroom, and bolted the door behind  her.    All that day Mary did not come down, remaining at her window, from which  she at least enjoyed a splendid view over the plains and village of  Kinross; but this vast extent only contracted her heart the more, when,  bringing her gaze back from the horizon to the castle, she beheld its  walls surrounded on all sides by the deep waters of the lake, on whose  wide surface a single boat, where Little Douglas was fishing, was  rocking like a speck. For some moments Mary's eyes mechanically rested  on this child, whom she had already seen upon her arrival, when suddenly  a horn sounded from the Kinross side. At the same moment Little Douglas  threw away his line, and began to row towards the shore whence the  signal had come with skill and strength beyond his years. Mary, who had  let her gaze rest on him absently, continued to follow him with her  eyes, and saw him make for a spot on the shore so distant that the boat  seemed to her at length but an imperceptible speck; but soon it  reappeared, growing larger as it approached, and Mary could then observe  that it was bringing back to the castle a new passenger, who, having in  his turn taken the oars, made the little skiff fly over the tranquil  water of the lake, where it left a furrow gleaming in the last rays of  the sun. Very soon, flying on with the swiftness of a bird, it was near  enough for Mary to see that the skilful and vigorous oarsman was a young  man from twenty-five to twenty-six years of age, with long black hair,  clad in a close coat of green cloth, and wearing a Highlander's cap,  adorned with an eagle's feather; then, as with his back turned to the  window he drew nearer, Little Douglas, who was leaning on his shoulder,  said a few words which made him turn round towards the queen:  immediately Mary, with an instinctive movement rather than with the  dread of being an object of idle curiosity, drew back, but not so  quickly, however, but that she had been able to see the handsome pale  face of the unknown, who, when she returned to the window, had  disappeared behind one of the corners of the castle.    Everything is a cause of conjecture to a prisoner: it seemed to Mary  that this young man's face was not unknown to her, and that he had seen  her already; but though great the care with which she questioned her  memory, she could not recall any distinct remembrance, so much so that  the queen ended in thinking it the play of her imagination, or that some  vague and distinct resemblance had deceived her.    However, in spite of Mary, this idea had taken an important place in her  mind: she incessantly saw this little boat skimming the water, and the  young man and the child who were in it drawing near her, as if to bring  her help. It followed that, although there had been nothing real in all  these captive's dreams, she slept that night a calmer sleep than she had  yet done since she had been in Lochleven Castle.    Next day, on rising, Mary ran to her window: the weather was fine, and  everything seemed to smile on her, the water, the heavens and the earth.  But, without being able to account for the restraining motive, she did  not want to go down into the ga den before breakfast. When the door  opened, 'she turned quickly round: it was, as on the day before, William  Douglas, who came to fulfil his duty as taster.    The breakfast was a short and silent one; then, as soon as Douglas had  withdrawn, Mary descended in her turn: in crossing the courtyard she saw  two horses ready saddled, which pointed to the near departure of a  master and a squire. Was it the young man with the black hair already  setting out again? This is what Mary did not dare or did not wish to  ask. She consequently went her way, and entered the garden: at the first  glance she took it in in its full extent; it was deserted.    Mary walked there a moment; then, soon tiring of the promenade, she went  up again to her room: in passing back through the courtyard she had  noticed that the horses were no longer there. Directly she returned into  her apartment, she went then to the window to see if she could discover  anything upon the lake to guide her in her conjectures: a boat was in  fact receding, and in this boat were the two horses and the two  horsemen; one was William Douglas, the other a simple squire from the  house.    Mary continued watching the boat until it had touched the shore. Arrived  there, the two horsemen got out, disembarked their horses, and went away  at full gallop, taking the same road by which the queen had come; so  that, as the horses were prepared for a long journey, Mary thought that  William Douglas was going to Edinburgh. As to the boat, scarcely had it  landed its two passengers on the opposite shore than it returned towards  the castle.    At that moment Mary Seyton announced to the queen that Lady Douglas was  asking permission to visit her.    It was the second time, after long hatred on Lady Douglas's part and  contemptuous indifference on the queen's, that the two women were face  to face; therefore the queen, with that instinctive impulse of coquetry  which urges women, in whatever situation they find themselves, to desire  to be beautiful, above all for women, made a sign to Mary Seyton, and,  going to a little mirror fastened to the wall in a heavy Gothic frame,  she arranged her curls, and readjusted the lace of her collar; then;  having seated herself in the pose most favourable to her, in a great  arm-chair, the only one in her sitting-room, she said smilingly to Mary  Seyton that she might admit Lady Douglas, who was immediately  introduced.    Mary's expectation was not disappointed: Lady Douglas, in spite of her  hatred for James V's daughter, and mistress of herself as she thought  she as, could not prevent herself from showing by a movement of surprise  the impression that this marvelous beauty was making on her: she thought  she should find Mary crushed by her unhappiness, pallid from her  fatigues, humbled by captivity, and she saw her calm, lovely, and  haughty as usual. Mary perceived the effect that she was producing, and  addressing herself with an ironical smile partly to Mary Seyton, who was  leaning on the back of her chair, and partly to her who was paying her  this unforeseen visit.    \"We are fortunate to-day,\" said she, \"for we are going as it seems to  enjoy the society of our good hostess, whom we thank besides for having  kindly maintained with us the empty ceremony of announcing herself--a  ceremony with which, having the keys of our apartment, she could have  dispensed.\"    \"If my presence is inconvenient to your grace,\" replied Lady Lochleven,  \"I am all the more sorry for it, as circumstances will oblige me to  impose it twice daily, at least during the absence of my son, who is  summoned to Edinburgh by the regent; this is of what I came to inform  your"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2746"],[0,"Urbain Grandier (#15)"],[1," on their arrival at Nicolas Moussant's, one of  Grandier's most bitter enemies; on the following day they went to the  superior's apartments and began their exorcisms. The first time the  superior opened her lips to reply, Pere Lactance perceived that she knew  almost no Latin, and consequently would not shine during the exorcism,  so he ordered her to answer in French, although he still continued to  exorcise her in Latin; and when someone was bold enough to object,  saying that the devil, according to the ritual, knew all languages  living and dead, and ought to reply in the same language in which he was  addressed, the father declared that the incongruity was caused by the  pact, and that moreover some devils were more ignorant than peasants.    Following these exorcists, and two Carmelite monks, named Pierre de  Saint-Thomas and Pierre de Saint-Mathurin, who had, from the very  beginning, pushed their way in when anything was going on, came four  Capuchins sent by Pere Joseph, head of the Franciscans, \"His grey  Eminence,\" as he was called, and whose names were Peres Luc, Tranquille,  Potais, and Elisee; so that a much more rapid advance could be made than  hitherto by carrying on the exorcisms in four different places at  once--viz., in the convent, and in the churches of Sainte-Croix,  Saint-Pierre du Martroy, and Notre-Dame du Chateau. Very little of  importance took place, however, on the first two occasions, the 15th and  16th of April; for the declarations of the doctors were most vague and  indefinite, merely saying that the things they had seen were  supernatural, surpassing their knowledge and the rules of medicine.    The ceremony of the 23rd April presented, however, some points of  interest. The superior, in reply to the interrogations of Pere Lactance,  stated that the demon had entered her body under the forms of a cat, a  dog, a stag, and a buck-goat.    \"Quoties?\" (How often?), inquired the exorcist.    \"I didn't notice the day,\" replied the superior, mistaking the word  quoties for quando (when).    It was probably to revenge herself for this error that the superior  declared the same day that Grandier had on his body five marks made by  the devil, and that though his body was else insensible to pain, he was  vulnerable at those spots. Mannouri, the surgeon, was therefore ordered  to verify this assertion, and the day appointed for the verification was  the 26th.    In virtue of this mandate Mannouri presented himself early on that day  at Grandier's prison, caused him to be stripped naked and cleanly  shaven, then ordered him to be laid on a table and his eyes bandaged.  But the devil was wrong again: Grandier had only two marks, instead of  five--one on the shoulder-blade, and the other on the thigh.    Then took place one of the most abominable performances that can be  imagined. Mannouri held in his hand a probe, with a hollow handle, into  which the needle slipped when a spring was touched: when Mannouri  applied the probe to those parts of Grandier's body which, according to  the superior, were insensible, he touched the spring, and the needle,  while seeming to bury itself in the flesh, really retreated into the  handle, thus causing no pain; but when he touched one of the marks said  to be vulnerable, he left the needle fixed, and drove it in to the depth  of several inches. The first time he did this it drew from poor  Grandier, who was taken unprepared, such a piercing cry that it was  heard in the street by the crowd which had gathered round the door. From  the mark on the shoulder-blade with which he had commenced, Mannouri  passed to that on the thigh, but though he plunged the needle in to its  full depth Grandier uttered neither cry nor groan, but went on quietly  repeating a prayer, and notwithstanding that Mannouri stabbed him twice  more through each of the two marks, he could draw nothing from his  victim but prayers for his tormentors.    M de Laubardemont was present at this scene.    The next day the devil was addressed in such forcible terms that an  acknowledgment was wrung from him that Grandier's body bore, not five,  but two marks only; and also, to the vast admiration of the spectators,  he was able this time to indicate their precise situation.    Unfortunately for the demon, a joke in which he indulged on this  occasion detracted from the effect of the above proof of cleverness.  Having been asked why he had refused to speak on the preceding Saturday,  he said he had not been at Loudun on that day, as the whole morning he  had been occupied in accompanying the soul of a certain Le Proust,  attorney to the Parliament of Paris, to hell. This answer awoke such  doubts in the breasts of some of the laymen present that they took the  trouble to examine the register of deaths, and found that no one of the  name of Le Proust, belonging to any profession whatever, had died on  that date. This discovery rendered the devil less terrible, and perhaps  less amusing.    Meantime the progress of the other exorcisms met with like  interruptions. Pere Pierre de Saint Thomas, who conducted the operations  in the Carmelite church, asked one of the possessed sisters where  Grandier's books of magic were; she replied that they were kept at the  house of a certain young girl, whose name she gave, and who was the same  to whom Adam had been forced to apologise. De Laubardemont, Moussant,  Herve, and Meunau hastened at once to the house indicated, searched the  rooms and the presses, opened the chests and the wardrobes and all the  secret places in the house, but in vain. On their return to the church,  they reproached the devil for having deceived them, but he explained  that a niece of the young woman had removed the books. Upon this, they  hurried to the niece's dwelling, but unluckily she was not at home,  having spent the whole day at a certain church making her devotions, and  when they went thither, the priests and attendants averred that she had  not gone out all day; so notwithstanding the desire of the exorcists to  oblige Adam they were forced to let the matter drop.    These two false statements increased the number of unbelievers; but it  was announced that a most interesting performance would take place on  May 4th; indeed, the programme when issued was varied enough to arouse  general curiosity. Asmodeus was to raise the superior two feet from the  ground, and the fiends Eazas and Cerberus, in emulation of their leader,  would do as much for two other nuns; while a fourth devil, named  Beherit, would go farther still, and, greatly daring, would attack M. de  Laubardemont himself, and, having spirited his councillor's cap from his  head, would hold it suspended in the air for the space of a Misereye.  Furthermore, the exorcists announced that six of the strongest men in  the town would try to prevent the contortions of the, weakest of the  convulsed nuns, and would fail.    It need hardly be said that the prospect of such an entertainment filled  the church on the appointed day to overflowing. Pere Lactance began by  calling on Asmodeus to fulfil his promise of raising the superior from  the ground. She began, hereupon, to perform various evolutions on her  mattress, and at one moment it seemed as if she were really suspended in  the air; but one of the spectators lifted her dress and showed that she  was only standing on tiptoe, which, though it might be clever, was not  miraculous. Shouts of laughter rent the air, which had such an  intimidating effect on Eazas and Cerberus that not all the adjurations  of the exorcists could extract the slightest response. Beherit was their  last hope, and he replied that he was prepared to lift up M. de  Laubardemont's cap, and would do so before the expiration of a quarter  of an hour.    We must here remark that this time the exorcisms took place in the  evening, instead of in the morning as hitherto; and it was now growing  dark, and darkness is favourable to illusions. Several of the  unbelieving ones present, therefore, began to call attention to the fact  that the quarter of an hour's delay would necessitate the employment of  artificial light during the next scene. They also noticed that M. de  Laubardemont had seated himself apart and immediately beneath one of the  arches in the vaulted roof, through which a hole had been drilled for  the passage of the bell-rope. They therefore slipped out of the church,  and up into the belfry, where they hid. In a few moments a man appeared  who began to work at something. They sprang on him and seized his  wrists, and found in one of his hands a thin line of horsehair, to one  end of which a hook was attached. The holder being frightened, dropped  the line and fled, and although M. de Laubardemont, the exorcists, and  the spectators waited, expecting every moment that the cap would rise  into the air, it remained quite firm on the owner's head, to the no  small confusion of Pere Lactance, who, all unwitting of the fiasco,  continued to adjure Beherit to keep his word--of course without the  least effect.    Altogether, this performance of May 4th, went anything but smoothly.  Till now no trick had succeeded; never before had the demons been such  bunglers. But the exorcists were sure that the last trick would go off  without a hitch. This was, that a nun, held by six men chosen for their  strength, would succeed in extricating herself from their grasp, despite  their utmost efforts. Two Carmelites and two Capuchins went through the  audience and selected six giants from among the porters and messengers  of the town.    This time the devil answered expectations by showing that if he was not  clever he was strong, for although the six men tried to hold her down  upon her mattress, the superior was seized with such terrible  convulsions that she escaped from their hands, throwing down one of  those who tried to detain her. This experiment, thrice renewed,  succeeded thrice, and belief"]]]
