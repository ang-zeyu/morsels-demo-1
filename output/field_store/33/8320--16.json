The number which fell by that diabolical conspiracy,  as reported by Smith, amounted to 347, and in his Generall Historie, at  page 149, he has a list of the numbers murdered at different places.  Neill copies from the Records of the Virginia Company (now in the  Congressional Library at Washington) a list of their names--see his  \"History of the Virginia Company,\" pp. 339-346--and considering that it  is proper to annex this to the list preceding we herewith give it. The  total corresponds with the statement in Smith's Historie.    The number of deaths in the census list shows a mortality amounting in  one year to upwards of twenty per cent. of the whole population,  exceeding the number which fell in the massacre by twenty-four. The  fullest details of this and many other matters relating to the Colony  while under the Virginia Company, can be found more fully shown in  Neill's History of the Virginia Company than in any other work we have  seen.           *       *       *       *       *    \"Here following is set downe a true list of the names of all those that  were massacred by the treachery of the Sauages in Virginia, the 22^{nd}  March last.    \"To the end that their lawfull heyres may take speedy order for the  inheritinge of their lands and estates there.

CONTINUOUS EXERCISES.      CLEARNESS.    The following exercises consist of extracts from Burnet, Butler, and  Clarendon, modernized and altered with a view to remove obscurity and  ambiguity. The modernized version will necessarily be inferior to the  original in unity of style, and in some other respects. The charm of  the author's individuality, and the pleasant ring of the old-fashioned  English, are lost. It is highly necessary that the student should  recognize this, and should bear in mind that the sole object is to  show how the meaning in each case might have been more _clearly_  expressed.    Occasionally expressions have been altered, not as being in themselves  obscure or objectionable, but as indicating a habit of which beginners  should beware. For example, in the extract from Burnet, _he_ is often  altered, not because, in the particular context, the pronoun presents  any obscurity, but because Burnet's habit of repeating _he_ is faulty.    These exercises can be used in two ways. The pupil may either have his  book open and be questioned on the reasons for each alteration, or,  after"]]]
