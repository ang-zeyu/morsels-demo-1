Ten francs paid the bill, and we went on our way rejoicing, after  having partaken of a lunch, as excellent as the dinner we had eaten  the night before, at the Hotel de France.    La Rochelle, the city of the Huguenots, and later of Richelieu, was  reached just as the setting sun was slanting its red and gold over  the picturesque old port and the Tour de Richelieu. If one really  wants to know what it looked like, let him hunt up Petitjean's \"Port  de la Rochelle\" in the Musee de Luxembourg at Paris. Words fail  utterly to describe the beauty and magnifycence of this hitherto  unoverworked artists' sketching-ground.    [Illustration: La Rochelle]    We threaded our way easily enough through the old sentinel gateway  spanning the main street, lined with quaint old arcaded,  Spanish-looking houses, and drew up abreast of the somewhat  humble-looking Hotel du Commerce, on the Place d'Armes, opposite the  ugly little squat cathedral, once wedded to the haughty Richelieu  himself.    The Hotel du Commerce at La Rochelle is the equal of the Hotel de  France at Niort, and has the added attraction of a glass-covered  courtyard, where you may take your coffee and watch the household  cats amusing themselves with the goldfish in the pool of the fountain  which plays coolingly in the centre.    La Rochelle and its Hotel du Commerce are too good to be treated  lightly or abruptly by any writer; but, for fear they may both become  spoiled, no more shall be said here except to reiterate that they are  both unapproachable in quaintness, comfort, and charm by anything yet  found by the writer in four years of almost constant wanderings by  road and rail up and down France.    Offshore four kilometres is the Ile de Re, an isle thirty kilometres  long, where the inhabitants wear the picturesque _coiffe_ and costume  which have not become contaminated with Paris fashions. The one thing  to criticize is the backwardness of the lives of the good folk of the  isle and their enormous _pieds plats_.    Northward from La Rochelle is a region, almost within sight of the  Ile de Re, where the women wear the most highly theatrical costumes  to be seen anywhere in modern France, not even excepting the peasants  of Brittany. The chief distinction of the costume is a sort of tiny  twisted bandanna over the head, a tight-fitting or folded fichu, a  short ballet sort of a skirt, black stockings, and a gaily bordered  apron and dainty, high-heeled, tiny shoes--in strong contrast in size  and form to the ungainly feet of the women of the Ile de Re.    We left La Rochelle with real regret, passed the fortified town of  Rochefort without a stop, and, in something over two hours, reeled  off some sixty-eight kilometres of sandy, marshy roadway to Saintes.    Saintes is noted for many things: its antiquity, its religious  history, its Roman remains, and the geniality of its toddling old  dealer in sewing-machines (of American make, of course), who, as a  \"side\" line, sells gasoline and oil at considerably under the  prevailing rates elsewhere. Truly we were in the ideal touring-ground  for automobilists.    To Cognac is sixty-seven kilometres. If we had ever known that Cognac  was the name of a town we had forgotten it, for we had, for the  moment, at any rate, thought it the name of the region where were  gathered the grapes from which cognac was made.    Cognac is famous for the subtle spirit which is sold the world over  under that name, and from the fact that it was the birthplace of the  art-loving monarch, Francois Premier.    For these two reasons, and for the bountiful lunch of the Hotel  d'Orleans, and incidentally for the very bad cognac which we got at a  cafe whose name is really and truly forgotten, Cognac is writ large  in our note-books.    The house where was born Francois Premier is easily found, sitting by  the river's bank. To-day it is the counting-house of one of the great  brandy shippers whose name is current the world over. Its  associations have changed considerably, and where once the new art  instincts were born, in the person of the gallant Francois, is now  the cradle of commercialism.    The question as to what constitutes good brandy has ever been a  favourite one among possessors of a little knowledge. The same class  has also been known to state that there is no good brandy nowadays,  no _vrai cognac_. This is a mistake, but perhaps a natural one, as  the cognac district in the Charente was almost wholly devastated in  the phylloxera ravages of half a century ago.    Things have changed, however, and there is as good cognac to-day as  there ever was, though there is undoubtedly much more poor stuff  being sold.    Down through the heart of the cognac region we sped, through Blaye to  Bordeaux and all the busy traffic of its port.    Bordeaux is attractive to the automobilist in that one enters, from  any direction, by wide, broad avenues. It is one of the great  provincial capitals of France, a great gateway through which much of  the intercourse with the outside world goes on.    It is not so cosmopolitan as Marseilles, nor so historically or  architecturally interesting as Rouen, but it is the very ideal of an  opulent and well-conducted city, where one does not need to await the  arrival of the daily papers from Paris in order to know what has  happened during the last round of the clock.    Hotels? The town is full of them! You may put up your automobile in  the garage of the Hotel du Chapon-Fin, along with forty others, and  you yourself will be well cared for, according to city standards, for  twelve or fifteen francs a day,--which is not dear. On the other  hand, Bordeaux possesses second-class hotels where, all found, you  may sleep and eat for the modest sum of seven francs a day. One of  these is the Hotel Francais, a somewhat extensive establishment in a  tiny back street. It is the cheapest _city_ hotel the writer has  found in France. There was no garage at the Hotel Francais, and we  were forced to house our machine a block or two away, where, for the  moderate sum of two francs, you might leave it twenty-four hours, and  get it back washed and rubbed down, while for another fifty centimes  they would clean the brass work,--a nasty job well worth the price.  Yes! Bordeaux is pleasant for the automobilist!    [Illustration: Bourdeaux, the Gateway to the Landes]    Two things the stranger, who does not want to go too far back into  antiquity, will remark upon at Bordeaux, the exceeding ampleness,  up-to-date-ness, and cleanliness of the great open space in front of  the Opera, and the imposing and beautifully laid out Place des  Quinconces, with its sentinel pillars and its waterside traffic of  railway and shipping, blending into a whole which inspired one of the  world's greatest pictures of the feverish life of modern activity,  the painting by Eugene Boudin, known as the \"Port de Bordeaux,\" in  the Luxembourg.    You may find a good low-priced hotel at Bordeaux, but you pay  inflated prices for your refreshments in the cafes; a _cafe-glace_  cost fifteen sous and a _glace a cafe_ twenty-five on the terrace of  the magnificent establishment opposite the Opera.    [Illustration: Map of Pyrenees]      Chapter II  A Little Tour In The Pyrenees    [Illustration: The Pyrenees]    We had been touring France _en automobile_ for many months--for  business purposes, one might say, and hence had followed no schedule  or itinerary, but had lingered by the way and made notes, and the  artist made sketches, and in general we acquired a knowledge of  France and things French that otherwise might not have been our lot.    The mere name of the Pyrenees had long had a magic sound for us. We  had seen them at a distance, from Carcassonne and Toulouse and Pau,  when we had made the conventional tour years ago, and had admired  them greatly, to the disparagement of the Swiss Alps. This may be  just, or unjust, but it is recorded here as a fact.    To climb mountains in an automobile appealed to us as a sport not yet  banal or overdone, and since Switzerland--so hospitable to most  classes of tourists--was treating automobilists badly just at the  time, we thought we would begin by making the itinerary of the  \"_Coupe des Pyrenees;_\" then, if we liked it, we could try the French  Alps in Dauphine and Savoie, delightful and little-known French  provinces which have all the advantages of Switzerland and few of its  disadvantages, inasmuch as the inhabitants of the valley hamlets and  mountain towns have not become so _commercant_ as their Swiss  brothers.    In August, 1905, was organized, by _La Vie en Grand Air_ and _La  Depeche de Toulouse_, a great contest for touring automobiles, for an  award to be known as the \"_Coupe des Pyrenees._\"    As a work of art the \"_Coupe des Pyrenees_\" is far and away ahead of  most \"cups\" of the sort. It was the work of the sculptor, Ducuing,  and the illustration herewith will show some of its charm. The  \"_coupe_\" itself has disappeared from mortal view, it having been  stolen from an automobile exposition in London.    The trials was intended to develop that type of vehicle best suited  to touring, and in every way the event was a great success. The  itinerary covered the lovely mountain roads from the Mediterranean to  the Atlantic, and was the immediate inspiration for the author of  this book to follow along the same trail. It is one of the most  delightful excursions to be made in all France, which is saying that  it is one of the most delightful in all the world.    We took our departure from Toulouse, as did the participants in this  famous trial of the year before. Toulouse, the gay capital of the gay  province of old Languedoc, has abounding attractions for the tourist  of all tastes, though"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26046"],[0,"Bird Stories from Burroughs (#15)"],[1,"with excitement. Every hour in the day he would do this. The  pressure was beginning to centre there. Then he would strike playfully  at a leaf or a bit of wood, and keep his wings lifted.    The next step was to spring into the air and beat his wings. He seemed  now to be thinking entirely of his wings. They itched to be put to use.    A day or two later he would leap and fly several feet. A pile of brush  ten or twelve feet below the bank was easily reached. Here he would  perch in true hawk fashion, to the bewilderment and scandal of all the  robins and catbirds in the vicinity. Here he would dart his eye in all  directions, turning his head over and glancing up into the sky.    He was now a lovely creature, fully fledged, and as tame as a kitten.  But he was not a bit like a kitten in one respect,--he could not bear to  have you stroke or even touch his plumage. He had a horror of your hand,  as if it would hopelessly defile him. But he would perch upon it, and  allow you to carry him about. If a dog or cat appeared, he was ready to  give battle instantly. He rushed up to a little dog one day, and struck  him with his foot savagely. He was afraid of strangers, and of any  unusual object.    The last week in July he began to fly quite freely, and it was necessary  to clip one of his wings. As the clipping embraced only the ends of his  primaries, he soon overcame the difficulty, and, by carrying his broad,  long tail more on that side, flew with considerable ease. He made  longer and longer excursions into the surrounding fields and vineyards,  and did not always return. On such occasions we would go to find him and  fetch him back.    Late one rainy afternoon he flew away into the vineyard, and when, an  hour later, I went after him, he could not be found, and we never saw  him again. We hoped hunger would soon drive him back, but we have had no  clew to him from that day to this.          THE WINTER WREN      An old hemlock wood at the head waters of the Delaware is a chosen haunt  of the winter wren. His voice fills these dim aisles, as if aided by  some marvelous sounding-board. Indeed, his song is very strong for so  small a bird, and unites in a remarkable degree brilliancy and  plaintiveness. I think of a tremulous, vibrating tongue of silver. You  may know it is the song of a wren from its gushing, lyrical character;  but you must needs look sharp to see the little minstrel, especially  while in the act of singing. He is nearly the color of the ground and  the leaves; he never ascends the tall trees, but keeps low, flitting  from stump to stump and from root to root, dodging in and out of his  hiding-places, and watching all intruders with a suspicious eye. He has  a very pert, almost comical look. His tail stands more than  perpendicular: it points straight toward his head. He is the least  ostentatious singer I know of. He does not strike an attitude, and lift  up his head in preparation, and, as it were, clear his throat; but sits  there on a log and pours out his music, looking straight before him, or  even down at the ground. As a songster, he has but few superiors. I do  not hear him after the first week in July.    The winter wren is so called because he sometimes braves our northern  winters, but it is rarely that one sees him at this season. I think I  have seen him only two or three times in winter in my life. The event of  one long walk, recently, in February, was seeing one of these birds. As  I followed a byroad, beside a little creek in the edge of a wood, my eye  caught a glimpse of a small brown bird darting under a stone bridge. I  thought to myself no bird but a wren would take refuge under so small a  bridge as that. I stepped down upon it and expected to see the bird dart  out at the upper end. As it did not appear, I scrutinized the bank of  the little run, covered with logs and brush, a few rods farther up.    Presently I saw the wren curtsying and gesticulating beneath an old log.  As I approached he disappeared beneath some loose stones in the bank,  then came out again and took another peep at me, then fidgeted about for  a moment and disappeared again, running in and out of the holes and  recesses and beneath the rubbish like a mouse or a chipmunk. The winter  wren may always be known by these squatting, bobbing-out-and-in habits.    As I sought a still closer view of him, he flitted stealthily a few  yards up the run and disappeared beneath a small plank bridge near a  house.    I wondered what he could feed upon at such a time. There was a light  skim of snow upon the ground, and the weather was cold. The wren, so far  as I know, is entirely an insect-feeder, and where can he find insects  in midwinter in our climate? Probably by searching under bridges, under  brush-heaps, in holes and cavities in banks where the sun falls warm. In  such places he may find dormant spiders and flies and other hibernating  insects or their larvae. We have a tiny, mosquito-like creature that  comes forth in March or in midwinter, as soon as the temperature is a  little above freezing. One may see them performing their fantastic  air-dances when the air is so chilly that one buttons his overcoat about  him in his walk. They are darker than the mosquito,--a sort of dark  water-color,--and are very frail to the touch. Maybe the wren knows the  hiding-place of these insects.          THE CEDAR-BIRD      How alert and vigilant the birds are, even when absorbed in building  their nests! In an open space in the woods I see a pair of cedar-birds  collecting moss from the top of a dead tree. Following the direction in  which they fly, I soon discover the nest placed in the fork of a small  soft maple, which stands amid a thick growth of wild cherry-trees and  young beeches. Carefully concealing myself beneath it, without any fear  that the workmen will hit me with a chip or let fall a tool, I await the  return of the busy pair. Presently I hear the well-known note, and the  female sweeps down and settles unsuspectingly into the half-finished  structure. Hardly have her wings rested before her eye has penetrated my  screen, and with a hurried movement of alarm she darts away. In a moment  the male, with a tuft of wool in his beak (for there is a sheep pasture  near), joins her, and the two reconnoitre the premises from the  surrounding bushes. With their beaks still loaded, they flit round with  a frightened look, and refuse to approach the nest till I have moved off  and lain down behind a log. Then one of them ventures to alight upon  the nest, but, still suspecting all is not right, quickly darts away  again. Then they both together come, and after much peeping and spying  about, and apparently much anxious consultation, cautiously proceed to  work. In less than half an hour it would seem that wool enough has been  brought to supply the whole family, real and prospective, with socks, if  needles and fingers could be found fine enough to knit it up. In less  than a week the female has begun to deposit her eggs,--four of them in  as many days,--white tinged with purple, with black spots on the larger  end. After two weeks of incubation the young are out.    Excepting the American goldfinch, this bird builds later in the season  than any other, its nest, in our northern climate, seldom being  undertaken till July. As with the goldfinch, the reason is, probably,  that suitable food for the young cannot be had at an earlier period.    I knew a pair of cedar-birds, one season, to build in an apple-tree, the  branches of which rubbed against the house. For a day or two before the  first straw was laid, I noticed the pair carefully exploring every  branch of the tree, the female taking the lead, the male following her  with an anxious note and look. It was evident that the wife was to have  her choice this time; and, like one who thoroughly knew her mind, she  was proceeding to take it. Finally the site was chosen upon a high  branch, extending over one low wing of the house. Mutual congratulations  and caresses followed, when both birds flew away in quest of  building-material. That most freely used is a sort of cotton-bearing  plant which grows in old worn-out fields. The nest is large for the size  of the bird, and very soft. It is in every respect a first-class  domicile.    The cedar-bird is the most silent bird we have. Our neutral-tinted  birds, like him, as a rule are our finest songsters; but he has no song  or call, uttering only a fine bead-like note on taking flight. This note  is the cedar-berry rendered back in sound. When the ox-heart cherries,  which he has only recently become acquainted with, have had time to  enlarge his pipe and warm his heart, I shall expect more music from him.  But in lieu of music, what a pretty compensation are those minute,  almost artificial-like, plumes of orange and vermilion that tip the ends  of his wing quills! Nature could not give him these and a song too.          THE GOLDFINCH      About the most noticeable bird of August in New York and New England is  the yellowbird, or goldfinch. This is one of the last birds to nest,  seldom hatching its eggs till late in July. It seems as if a particular  kind of food were required to rear its brood, which cannot be had at an  earlier date. The seed of the common thistle is apparently its mainstay.  There is no prettier sight at this season than a troop of young  goldfinches, led by their parents, going from thistle to thistle along  the roadside and pulling the ripe heads to pieces for the seed. The  plaintive call of the young is one of the characteristic August sounds.  Their nests are frequently destroyed, or the eggs thrown from them, by  the terrific July thunder-showers. Last season a pair had a nest on the  slender branch of a maple in front of the door of the house where I was  staying. The eggs were being deposited, and the happy pair had a loving  conversation about them many times each day, when"]]]
