I could see forms pass before the light. I wondered what could be the  matter. The horses were all safe; even Boy, Mr. Haynes's dog, was  safe, shivering and whining on his master's blankets. I could plainly  hear the hiccoughs of the wounded man: the click-cluck, click-cluck,  kept on with maddening persistence, but at last his nurses forced  enough hot water down him to cause vomiting. The blood-clots came and  the poor fellow fell asleep. A lantern was hung upon the wagon and the  two women went into the coaster to make some coffee.    It was three o'clock in the morning when the men of our outfit came  back. They put on their heavy coats and were seeing to their horses. I  asked Clyde what was the matter.    \"Hush,\" he said; \"lie still. It is Olaf.\"    \"But I want to help,\" I said.    \"You can't help. It's--all over,\" he replied as he started again to  where the lantern was gleaming like a star fallen among the sage.    I tucked the children in a little more snugly, then went over to the  coaster.    \"Won't you come to bed and rest?\" I asked Mrs. O'Shaughnessy.    \"No, I'll not. Are me children covered and warm?\"    \"Yes,\" I answered.    \"What are them fellys pow-wowing about down in the sage?\"    \"Olaf is dead,\" I said.    \"Who says God is not merciful? Now all the poor felly's troubles are  done with. 'Twas him that caused the stampede, mayhap. God send him  peace. I am glad. He will never be hungry nor cold any more.\"    \"Yes,\" said the girl; speaking slowly. \"I am glad, too. He almost  lived in this draw. We saw him every trip and he _did_ suffer. Dad  left a little for him to eat and whatever he could to wear every trip.  The sheep-herders helped him, too. But he suffered. All the home he  had was an old, thrown-away sheep wagon down beyond the last ridge  toward the valley. I've seen him every two weeks for ten years. It's a  wonder he has not been killed before.\"    \"I wonder,\" said Mrs. O'Shaughnessy, \"if he has any family. Where will  they bury him?\"    \"He has no people. If they will listen to Dad, they will lay him here  on the desert. He would want it so.\"    After breakfast Mrs. O'Shaughnessy lay down for a little rest. When  the wounded man awoke the girl gave him a little coffee.    \"You're awful good to me,\" he said. \"I'd like to have you around all  the time.\"    The girl smiled gravely. \"Ain't you got nobody to take care of you?\"    \"No. What is your name?\"    \"Amy Winters. Now you must hush. Talkin' might make you worse.\"    \"I'm not so tur'ble bad off. Where do you live?\"    \"In the coaster, somewhere on the road between Pinedale and Rock  Springs. Dad is a freighter.\"    \"Huh! Do you like to live that way?\"    \"No; I want a house and a garden awful bad, but Dad can't do nothin'  but freight and we've got Jessie to raise. We ain't got no ma.\"    \"Do women _have_ to change their names when they marry?\"    \"I don't know. Reckon they do, though. Why?\"    \"'Cause my name is Tod Winters. I know where there is a dandy little  place up on the Gros Ventre where a cabin would look mighty good to me  if there was some one to keep it for me--\"    \"Oh, say,\" she interrupted, \"that is a awful pretty handkerchief  you've got around your neck.\"    Just then the automobile came up frightening our horses. I heard no  more, but the \"awful pretty handkerchief\" was missing when the hero  left for the hospital. They used some lumber from a load the freighter  had and walled up a grave for Olaf. They had no tools but axes and a  shovel we had along. By noon Olaf was buried. Glenholdt set a slab of  sandstone at the head. With his knife he had dug out these  words--\"Olaf. The friend of horses.\"    We camped last night at Ten Trees. To-night we are at Eden Valley. The  mystery of Mrs. O'Shaughnessy's sudden change about the license is  explained. She unloaded an elk at the Sanders cabin. \"'Twas two I  aimed to bring you, but me own family has increased by twins whilst  I've been gone, so one ilk will have to do you.\"    So now, dear friend, I am a little nearer you. In one more week I  shall be home.                                  Sincerely, _thankfully_ yours,                                     E. R. S.          XIII    NEARING HOME                                    AT THE WELL IN THE DESERT,                                     October 21.    DEAR FRIEND,--    We shall reach Green River City to-night. We will rest the teams one  day, then start home. It will take us two days from Green River to  reach home, so this is the last letter on the road. When we made camp  here last night we saw some one coming on horseback along the canyon  rim on the opposite side. The form seemed familiar and the horse  looked like one I had seen, but I dared not believe my eyes. Clyde,  who was helping to draw water from the eighty-foot well without a  pulley, thought I was bereft as I ran from the camp toward the  advancing rider. But although I thought what I saw must be a mirage,  still I knew Mrs. Louderer on Bismarck.    Out of breath from my run, I grasped her fat ankle and panted till I  could speak.    \"Haf they run you out of camp, you iss so bad?\" she asked me by way of  greeting. Then, more kindly, \"Your boy iss all right, the mutter also.  I am come, though, to find you. It iss time you are home with the  _kinder_. Haf you any goose-grease left?\"    I had, all she had given me.    At camp, joy knew no bounds. Never was one more welcome than our  beloved neighbor. Her astonishment knew no bounds either, when her big  blue eyes rested upon Mrs. O'Shaughnessy's \"twins.\"    \"Frau O'Shaughnessy,\" she said severely, \"what have you here? You iss  robbed an orphan asylum. How haf you come by these?\"    Mrs. O'Shaughnessy is so full of life and good spirits and so  delighted to talk about her \"childher\" that she gave a very animated  recital of how she became a happy mother. In turn Mrs. Louderer told  how she grew more and more alarmed by our long absence, but decided  not to alarm the neighbors, so she had \"made a search party out of  mineself,\" and had fared forth to learn our fate.    We had a merry supper; even Haynes became cheerful, and there was no  lagging next morning when we started for home. When people go on elk  hunts they are very likely to return in tatters, so I am going to  leave it to your imagination to picture our appearance when we drove  up to the rear of the hotel about sundown. Our friend Mrs. Hutton came  running to meet us. I was ashamed to go into her house, but she leaned  up against the house and laughed until tears came. \"_What_ chased  you?\" she gasped. \"You must have been run through some of those barbed  wire things that they are putting up to stop the German army.\"    Mrs. Hutton is a little lady who bolsters up self-respect and makes  light of trying situations, so she \"shooed\" us in and I sneaked into  my room and waited until Clyde could run down to the store and  purchase me a dress. I feel quite clean and respectable now, sitting  up here in my room writing this to you. I will soon be at home now.  Until then good-bye.                                  E. R. S.          XIV    THE MEMORY-BED                                    October 25.    DEAR, DEAR FRIEND,--    Can you guess how happy I am? Be it _ever_ so humble there is no place  like home.    It is so good to sit in my creaky old rocker, to hold Junior, to  feel his dear weight; to look at my brave little mother. I do not  like the \"in-law.\" She is _mother_ to me. Under the east window  of our dining-room we have a flower-bed. We call it our memory-bed  because Clyde's first wife had it made and kept pansies growing  there. We poured the water of my little lost boy's last bath onto the  memory-bed. I keep pansies growing in one side of the bed in memory of  her who loved them. In the other end I plant sweet alyssum in memory  of my baby. A few pansies and a tuft of sweet alyssum smiled a  welcome, though all the rest of my flowers were dead. We have a  hop-vine at the window and it has protected the flowers in the  memory-bed. How happy I have been, looking over the place! Some young  calves have come while we were gone; a whole squirming nest full of  little pigs. My chickens have outgrown my knowledge. There is no snow  here at all. Our experiences on our trip seem almost unreal, but the  wagon-load of meat to be attended to is a reminder of realities. I  have had a fine trip; I have experienced about all the human emotions.  I had not expected to encounter so many people or to get the little  inside glimpses that I've had, but wherever there are human beings  there are the little histories. I have come home realizing anew how  happy I am, how much I have been spared, and how many of life's  blessings are mine. Poor Mrs. Louderer, childless and alone, openly  envying Mrs. O'Shaughnessy her babies! In my bedroom there is a row of  four little brown heads asleep on their pillows. Four precious  kiddies all my own. And not the least of my blessings, _you_ to tell  my happiness to. Has my trip interested you, dear friend? I _hope_ you  liked it. It will lose a little of its charm for me if you find it  uninteresting.    I will write you again soon.                                  Your happy friend,                                     E. R. S.                             THE END          TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES:    Minor changes have been made to correct obvious typesetters' errors;  otherwise, every effort has been made to remain true to the author's  words and intent."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28613"],[0,"Pioneers of Science (#15)"],[1,"now assimilated the  elements of mathematics and physics, and at twenty-six we find him  appointed for three years to the University Chair of Mathematics, and  enjoying the paternally dreaded stipend of 7-1/2_d._ a day.    Now it was that he pondered over the laws of falling bodies. He  verified, by experiment, the fact that the velocity acquired by falling  down any slope of given height was independent of the angle of slope.  Also, that the height fallen through was proportional to the square of  the time.    Another thing he found experimentally was that all bodies, heavy and  light, fell at the same rate, striking the ground at the same time.[6]    Now this was clean contrary to what he had been taught. The physics of  those days were a simple reproduction of statements in old books.  Aristotle had asserted certain things to be true, and these were  universally believed. No one thought of trying the thing to see if it  really were so. The idea of making an experiment would have savoured of  impiety, because it seemed to tend towards scepticism, and cast a doubt  on a reverend authority.    Young Galileo, with all the energy and imprudence of youth (what a  blessing that youth has a little imprudence and disregard of  consequences in pursuing a high ideal!), as soon as he perceived that  his instructors were wrong on the subject of falling bodies, instantly  informed them of the fact. Whether he expected them to be pleased or not  is a question. Anyhow, they were not pleased, but were much annoyed by  his impertinent arrogance.    It is, perhaps, difficult for us now to appreciate precisely their  position. These doctrines of antiquity, which had come down hoary with  age, and the discovery of which had reawakened learning and quickened  intellectual life, were accepted less as a science or a philosophy, than  as a religion. Had they regarded Aristotle as a verbally inspired  writer, they could not have received his statements with more  unhesitating conviction. In any dispute as to a question of fact, such  as the one before us concerning the laws of falling bodies, their method  was not to make an experiment, but to turn over the pages of Aristotle;  and he who could quote chapter and verse of this great writer was held  to settle the question and raise it above the reach of controversy.    It is very necessary for us to realize this state of things clearly,  because otherwise the attitude of the learned of those days towards  every new discovery seems stupid and almost insane. They had a  crystallized system of truth, perfect, symmetrical--it wanted no  novelty, no additions; every addition or growth was an imperfection, an  excrescence, a deformity. Progress was unnecessary and undesired. The  Church had a rigid system of dogma, which must be accepted in its  entirety on pain of being treated as a heretic. Philosophers had a  cast-iron system of truth to match--a system founded upon Aristotle--and  so interwoven with the great theological dogmas that to question one was  almost equivalent to casting doubt upon the other.    In such an atmosphere true science was impossible. The life-blood of  science is growth, expansion, freedom, development. Before it could  appear it must throw off these old shackles of centuries. It must burst  its old skin, and emerge, worn with the struggle, weakly and  unprotected, but free and able to grow and to expand. The conflict was  inevitable, and it was severe. Is it over yet? I fear not quite, though  so nearly as to disturb science hardly at all. Then it was different; it  was terrible. Honour to the men who bore the first shock of the battle!    Now Aristotle had said that bodies fell at rates depending on their  weight.    A 5 lb. weight would fall five times as quick as a 1 lb. weight; a 50  lb. weight fifty times as quick, and so on.    Why he said so nobody knows. He cannot have tried. He was not above  trying experiments, like his smaller disciples; but probably it never  occurred to him to doubt the fact. It seems so natural that a heavy body  should fall quicker than a light one; and perhaps he thought of a stone  and a feather, and was satisfied.    Galileo, however, asserted that the weight did not matter a bit, that  everything fell at the same rate (even a stone and a feather, but for  the resistance of the air), and would reach the ground in the same time.    And he was not content to be pooh-poohed and snubbed. He knew he was  right, and he was determined to make every one see the facts as he saw  them. So one morning, before the assembled University, he ascended the  famous leaning tower, taking with him a 100 lb. shot and a 1 lb. shot.  He balanced them on the edge of the tower, and let them drop together.  Together they fell, and together they struck the ground.    The simultaneous clang of those two weights sounded the death-knell of  the old system of philosophy, and heralded the birth of the new.    But was the change sudden? Were his opponents convinced? Not a jot.  Though they had seen with their eyes, and heard with their ears, the  full light of heaven shining upon them, they went back muttering and  discontented to their musty old volumes and their garrets, there to  invent occult reasons for denying the validity of the observation, and  for referring it to some unknown disturbing cause.    They saw that if they gave way on this one point they would be letting  go their anchorage, and henceforward would be liable to drift along with  the tide, not knowing whither. They dared not do this. No; they _must_  cling to the old traditions; they could not cast away their rotting  ropes and sail out on to the free ocean of God's truth in a spirit of  fearless faith.    [Illustration: FIG. 37.--Tower of Pisa.]    Yet they had received a shock: as by a breath of fresh salt breeze and  a dash of spray in their faces, they had been awakened out of their  comfortable lethargy. They felt the approach of a new era.    Yes, it was a shock; and they hated the young Galileo for giving it  them--hated him with the sullen hatred of men who fight for a lost and  dying cause.    We need scarcely blame these men; at least we need not blame them  overmuch. To say that they acted as they did is to say that they were  human, were narrow-minded, and were the apostles of a lost cause. But  _they_ could not know this; _they_ had no experience of the past to  guide them; the conditions under which they found themselves were novel,  and had to be met for the first time. Conduct which was excusable then  would be unpardonable now, in the light of all this experience to guide  us. Are there any now who practically repeat their error, and resist new  truth? who cling to any old anchorage of dogma, and refuse to rise with  the tide of advancing knowledge? There may be some even now.    Well, the unpopularity of Galileo smouldered for a time, until, by  another noble imprudence, he managed to offend a semi-royal personage,  Giovanni de Medici, by giving his real opinion, when consulted, about a  machine which de Medici had invented for cleaning out the harbour of  Leghorn. He said it was as useless as it in fact turned out to be.  Through the influence of the mortified inventor he lost favour at Court;  and his enemies took advantage of the fact to render his chair  untenable. He resigned before his three years were up, and retired to  Florence.    His father at this time died, and the family were left in narrow  circumstances. He had a brother and three sisters to provide for.    He was offered a professorship at Padua for six years by the Senate of  Venice, and willingly accepted it.    Now began a very successful career. His introductory address was marked  by brilliant eloquence, and his lectures soon acquired fame. He wrote  for his pupils on the laws of motion, on fortifications, on sundials, on  mechanics, and on the celestial globe: some of these papers are now  lost, others have been printed during the present century.    Kepler sent him a copy of his new book, _Mysterium Cosmographicum_, and  Galileo in thanking him for it writes him the following letter:--[7]         \"I count myself happy, in the search after truth, to have so great       an ally as yourself, and one who is so great a friend of the truth       itself. It is really pitiful that there are so few who seek truth,       and who do not pursue a perverse method of philosophising. But this       is not the place to mourn over the miseries of our times, but to       congratulate you on your splendid discoveries in confirmation of       truth. I shall read your book to the end, sure of finding much that       is excellent in it. I shall do so with the more pleasure, because       _I have been for many years an adherent of the Copernican system_,       and it explains to me the causes of many of the appearances of       nature which are quite unintelligible on the commonly accepted       hypothesis. _I have collected many arguments for the purpose of       refuting the latter_; but I do not venture to bring them to the       light of publicity, for fear of sharing the fate of our master,       Copernicus, who, although he has earned immortal fame with some,       yet with very many (so great is the number of fools) has become an       object of ridicule and scorn. I should certainly venture to publish       my speculations if there were more people like you. But this not       being the case, I refrain from such an undertaking.\"    Kepler urged him to publish his arguments in favour of the Copernican  theory, but he hesitated for the present, knowing that his declaration  would be received with ridicule and opposition, and thinking it wiser to  get rather more firmly seated in his chair before encountering the  storm of controversy.    The six years passed away, and the Venetian Senate, anxious not to lose  so bright an ornament, renewed his appointment for another six years at  a largely increased"]]]
